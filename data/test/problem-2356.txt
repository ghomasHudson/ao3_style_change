—amusing did you?”
“Where are you—
Were there more of these circulating through Hogwarts? If so, how many? How many students had read it? Most importantly—has Potter read it?
“Thought about dating me often then?” Draco questions with a coy smile.
—done to me? My throat feels like—
“Yes,” Harry pulls Draco in and softly presses their foreheads together. “Draco, what is it?”
Draco reaches out a shaky hand to confirm what, on some level, he already knows to be true. He gently presses his hand down on to Harry’s chest to find it was beating just as erratic as his own. They were, indeed, the same. Draco’s heart lurches with a sense of immense affection towards the man in front of him. He feels overwhelmed by the absolute need to confess every thought and feeling Harry has ever evoked from him. He needs Harry to understand just how tumultuous yet confident he was about this happening. He needs him to know everything. He just
“Well, maybe when someone tells you not to eat the spicy food because you can’t handle it you should listen.”
!” Draco pouts, sharply exhaling through his nose he crosses his arms over his chest and turns his head away from his obtuse fiancé.
“I thought I had a hero complex? Now I’m a villain?” Harry questions half-jokingly.
“Then you saw how silly it was. Or a part of it. Trust me whichever part you read—there’s a part of it even more daft that you didn’t.” Pansy says as soothingly as she’s capable of.
“Stop! Stop it! It hurts,” Draco leans over his hands clutching at his waist. His face flushes a pretty pink, tears threatening to fall from his eyes.
last night.”
“I was criticizing your attire, Potter. No one, at least no one of worth, would willingly associate with a person dressed like a slovenly guttersnipe.” Draco responds still slightly flustered but no longer willing to let Harry have the upper hand in the exchange.
Grabbing at the lapels on Draco’s jacket Harry pulls him in and crashes their lips together. It starts a little too rough and awkward but Draco quickly takes control and guides them towards something a little more slow and sensual. Harry sighs and opens his mouth wanting nothing more than the feeling of Draco’s tongue in him. As soon as he gets that long-awaited, long dreamt about sensation he is immediately denied. He feels hands push forcefully against his chest. Confused he opens his eyes to see Draco looking panicked. His mouth is hanging open, tongue hanging out and he’s swiftly waving his hand up and down as if he’s trying to cool himself.
“My throat. Oh—
“Seriously? It's bad enough I lost my self-restraint and succumbed to the allure of that sugary temptress once. I won't fit my robes. Do you want me to not fit into my robes?”
A pretty rose-colored blush flooded Draco’s cheeks, not so much at Harry’s words but because of the hand traveling dangerously higher up Draco’s thigh. Harry quirks an eyebrow and his lips pull up into a smirk waiting for Draco to make the next move.
Lips pull apart with a wet, breathy smack.
“Ugh, no, ple—
the parchment.”
Currently, however, there were other hands helping him out. Big hands, firm and absolute in their exploration one under his shirt tracing their way over his ribs. The other between his shoulder blades locking him into a solid embrace with no chance of escape (like Draco would
Draco scoffed and continued to make his way upstairs. Harry smiled, Draco was coming to movie night for him.
He headed down to the Defense room to wait.
The auror said, “I have orders to take Mr. Malfoy directly back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“Earlier tonight after the younger years went to bed. It’s not much, really.” Harry was blushing now.
Harry panted and sat up. He lit his wand and went over to the window seat. The nightmare had felt so real, aside from the way it changed over and over. He opened the curtains and sat in the window. He turned his head towards the sky, it was a stormy night and he could see lightning off in the distance. If it weren’t for the thunder, which sounded eerily like Hogwarts falling apart during the battle, the storm would be extremely relaxing. Once he thought of this, he cast a sound barrier around him to keep the noise out of his head. He fell into a restless sleep in the window seat, looking out at the lightning.
“This sounds serious, everything alright?” Ron came over and sat on a desk in the front row of the class, facing Harry who sat on his desk.
Harry led the students over to the side of the room which was allotted for practical magic. There were dueling mats with warded barriers that would prevent people from flying across the room and would alert Harry and Hermione if someone was seriously injured.
They had breakfast, and then went outside and ended up having a giant snowball fight. Well everyone but Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Fleur had just announced that she was pregnant and didn’t want to participate in the snowball fight.
They danced for what, to Harry seemed like forever, then ended up on the blanket, picking at the chocolates. Harry did his best not to stare at Draco, but was failing quite a bit, that didn’t quite matter though, Draco was staring right back.
—Appie
Harry sat down at the desk, his left side he would devote the drawers to all his student needs, blank parchment, black ink, and normal quills along with his textbooks. He kept a few defense books on the right for him to teach from. Hermione had insisted they also follow the curriculum to the letter, so the books would certainly help keep him on track. Harry also left some red ink and spellcheck and cheating detecting quills in the drawers on that side.
Hermione seemed to be wrapping up just as he and Neville were finishing. All the duels that day had ended in a draw due to time constraints so far. The class switched over so that they could finish the assessment.
“Yes.”
Why the fuck had he gone and lied to Harry? This had been the perfect opportunity to tell him the truth and he had gone and messed it up again. Would he ever cease being a coward? Probably not.
“Well I can’t say all that much because I was just assigned to a large investigation, but there have been a bunch of break ins in the wealthy sectors of the city.”
Draco sat up and pulled Harry into a kiss.
“And why exactly did I have to come along?” Draco asked, but he was grinning.
A blonde girl with giant golden hoops in her ears slung an arm around Brittany’s shoulders and slurred, “This one here is a smarty pants.” She pointed at Draco and Pansy accusingly and said, “Did you know she was valedictorian of her class?”
“Don’t be nervous, you’ll do great.” Harry reassured them.
“You can take the bathroom first.” Harry said, knowing Draco needed to shower or else he couldn’t fall asleep properly.
“Do we have to celebrate?” Draco asked exasperatedly.
—Appie
“And yes to Hogsmeade, it sounds fun.” Draco continued, “Although you need to work on your Valentine skills, I would have expected something a little more cutesy from you.”
His mother was still a bit traumatized by the death of Harry’s father when Harry was four years old. Harry did his best not to think about that though. He only had a few fleeting memories of James and a few of James’ things.
“Can anyone tell us what charm we were studying way back in March before Easter hols?” Asked Hermione, “Hannah?”
“Stop pacing,” His auror grunted.
“Tell us your most embarrassing childhood secret.”
Laughing, Draco knocked his shoulder into Pansy’s playfully. “So, have you met your roommate yet then?”
“Can I help with the tables?”
Draco found himself pacing back and forth for hours on end, despite the fact that he knew it would be days before he received any sort of return letter from Harry. If Harry wrote back to him at all. With every small sound, he found himself craning his neck in the hope of seeing an owl at the window.
“Your wand alarm went off,” Draco said coolly. He was proud of how even his voice was, how calm he sounded.
Draco’s heart leapt inside of his chest and he had the urge to put a hand on Harry’s face and kiss him until the movie ended. But, luckily for them both, Draco still had a little more self control left. So he merely shrugged off the offer with another muttered, “Idiot.”
Be sure to leave her some comments to let her know you enjoyed it!
“I dare you to run to the late night bookstore and find a disgustingly trashy romance novel and buy it, when you get back open to a random page and give us a dramatic reading.”
Another party, this wasn’t good. Not for Draco, at least, seeing as there was so much alcohol. But he was determined to remain sober... or at least sober enough to remember what went on in the morning. So, he stayed far away from the table of drinks throughout the party. That was until he saw Harry disappear from the party. He had given up on calling him Potter in his mind, but not yet in his speech.
Hermione was sitting on the bed staring off into space.
Sorry about coming in and making my changes to the notes and stuff so late, I was out of town last weekend and will be again next week.
He wondered if this auror knew that he had not been close to his cousin, never even met her really. At least not in living memory.
Also warning about half of this chapter is a list of Christmas presents!
“Yeah. They were my older cousins, haven’t really talked to Narcissa since high school, I think she married her high school and college boyfriend. That door is the bathroom.” He pointed to a door that he passed, “Andie was disowned when I was younger so I’ve had no way to contact her. I think she and Narcissa kept in touch.”
Harry knew she understood what he said, at least on a basic level, but she needed to get to a stopping point before she could really talk.
“Ah Harry, right on time.” Mr. Orange smiled, he was holding a mug and a glass.
He knocked on Draco’s door.
Draco nodded and smiled. “I’ll plan the next one. And I promise you’ll love it.”
“Good work Potter. New game! Granger and Zabini, out of the air.”
“She figured it out for herself.” Harry said.
Harry still found himself visiting the manor more than once a week despite having a full time job.
Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrated last night. If you didn’t then Happy Friday!!
Harry was pretty sure Draco wasn’t telling the truth, but he left it alone, “Ok, we’ll just chalk it up to the alcohol and forget it happened.”
Hi! I’m actually uploading my own chapter this week! Hope you like it
Draco had absolutely no idea what to say to that so he just said, “Parents are the worst.” Ron nodded agreeably and the two lapsed back into silence, albeit a far more comfortable one than they’d shared in weeks previous. Draco tried his best to focus on the eight page essay he was supposed to be writing for his photography class about what he viewed as the four most under utilized techniques, but he just couldn’t get his mind to really engage in the deep thinking necessary for writing it.
I hope you liked it! Be sure to check out Appie’s chapter, and two more chapters will be out next week. Don’t forget to leave us comments and kudos.
“Dare, you already know too many of my secrets.”
The two eventually made it down to the Great Hall. Harry practically had to drag Draco to the staff table to eat. “C’mon, if Hermione can bring Neville up here you can sit here too.”
tomorrow, actually. I might have kissed him right after the trial... in front of everyone.”
“That’s settled, I’ll be back by lunch and then you can have your time together.”
Draco nudged Harry and nodded in Longbottom and Granger’s direction. “When did they become a thing?” He asked.
He reached for it now and fumbled to unwrap it. It was bizarre to say the least. Draco wasn’t quite sure what Harry’s angle on this was. What had inspired this gift? They were cuff links, that he was sure of, but what animal was this? Draco loved them. He had to keep himself from putting them on just then. It would have looked ridiculous, as he was wearing pajamas.
By the time he came back to himself he realized he had just bolted from his boyfriend for no good reason. No, it was an okay reason, his brain supplied in a voice that sounded like the mind healer he had seen a few times this past year, mostly the previous summer.
Harry nodded and ordered the same coffee he did last night, along with a breakfast wrap.
Harry was glad to be back in close proximity to them again. Senior year had been… hard to say the least. His godparents had moved away when Remus had gotten the job at the end of Harry’s junior year, and living alone with his mother without Padfoot and Moony two streets over hadn’t been the easiest.
Draco shrugged, “I thought I was going to Azkaban. Didn’t really do a whole lot of career planning in the midst of all that.”
“Hey, love,” Draco said, gently removing the glass from Harry’s grip, “Come to bed.” Harry seemed to be about to retort so Draco continued, “If you have anymore, you’re going to feel dreadful in the morning, hell you’re already going to feel pretty shitty.”
“Dad?” Draco whispered into the deafening silence.
Harry kissed Draco’s right cheek, “You sure did.”
— Tay
Draco cast his eyes around the room, searching for anything to indicate what she had asked. “Er- sorry, what?”
“Listen Potter... Harry.” Draco had called him Harry? That was new, Draco hadn’t even called him that in class. Though Harry wasn’t sure that he minded all that much, “There’s something I need to say.”
“Watch it Potter.”
By the time he came back to himself, Padma Patil of Ravenclaw was walking up to the sorting hat. That meant it would be his turn soon.
Twenty minutes later, he couldn’t help himself. He knew they were just about to reach the pinnacle of what was considered to be scary about this movie, so he took the opportunity provided to him and snatched up Harry’s hand. Worse come to worse, he could play it off as being so utterly terrified by the movie that it left him with no other option. He was glad though when Harry didn’t react to the gesture at all.
“Yikes.” Harry said, “I’m glad we don’t live near there.”
“Oh you know, pre-med, biology, chemistry, you name it. I’ve got to do the whole lot if I ever want to actually become an anesthesiologist.” Brittany said.
Jess nodded, “Yeah, she might even be going right now.”
“Thank you, you may go, Minerva McGonagall, please.”
“You said it, not me.” Draco said, smirking.
“Not today,” He sighed out, “I think I’ve had enough of this place for a while.” She nodded again, understanding that as well.
“It’s just that I’m going to be staying by myself in London for most of the holidays, with Ginny and Ron in relationships there isn’t any room for me at the Weasly’s so writing you would at least ease some of the boredom. You sound like you could use someone as well.”
“How did Harry survive the killing curse the first time?” Called out a voice from the back.
“How’d the ferret take it?”
“Come back in five minutes!” Called Daphne’s voice.
“Aside from that.”
“Malfoy.” Potter’s voice was cool, nonchalant, and without another word, he left the room, leaving Draco all alone.
For the purposes of the tryouts, two extra sets of hoops were placed on the field, “Weasley, Corner, and Macmillan you’re up. The rest of you divide into teams of three, and find a keeper, color the tails of your brooms to keep track of teams.”
Harry turned over slowly, looking up at Draco with bleary eyes. Draco wondered if Harry had been crying. Draco waited for Harry’s response, the seconds dragging on into minutes and Draco began to fear that Harry wouldn’t respond at all.
“That makes it even worse! You’re so perfect at everything without even trying! With your hair and your eyes and your Quidditch!”
“We should get somewhere warm soon. We can walk around for now, but this little guy is gonna get cold pretty quick, even with a warming charm.” Harry turned back to Teddy, “Isn’t that right?”
“So a party huh. I guess I’ve got nothing better to do tonight. And a job? Won’t that stretch you a bit thin?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That sounds depressing.”
“You should ask him out,” Blaise suggested.
Draco zoned out very quickly, plagued by thoughts of before Voldemort’s fall. His fingers began to twitch and he hastily stuffed his hands into his pockets to avoid drawing attention to himself.
After the day of classes was done Harry would either study in his dorm or go to work. Draco would be found at the Rise and Grind by the time Harry was on shift and would stay until closing.
“Yeah but I want to see if I can find upperclassmen that have taken them and ask their opinion tomorrow before we have to have selections submitted.”
His father was arguing with Greyback now, and Draco locked eyes with Granger. Ever so slightly, she shook her head. But he wasn’t sure if he could do it. His nerve had failed him at every turn. He looked back at her with pleading eyes, silently begging her to come up with some plan, to get them all out of this. She was the smart one, after all. She had shoved him down into second best in every subject.
One by one people went up to the middle of the room and recast their animal to varying degrees of success. A few like Susan and Justin only managed mist where they had been fine earlier.
He strode into Rise and Grind and found Harry standing behind the counter, smiling at him. He’d known Harry would be there, and this time he had actually been looking for him, though he was in the mood for coffee as well. He paused directly before the register and grinned right back at Harry.
“I needed to make an entrance didn’t I? Besides the trial hasn’t even started yet.” He gave a smirk. He didn’t know when he started viewing McGonagall as a colleague over an authority figure, but she didn’t seem to mind.
It opened up into a break room that felt very much like the cafe itself, a few cushy chairs were around but there was also a table with a few more traditional dining chairs around it. There was a counter with a sink and a microwave and a coffee pot and a full size fridge stood next to it.
“Sounds like fun.” Joked Draco.
Draco made a brontosaurus and a triceratops while Harry worked on a Tyrannosaurus rex and a pterodactyl. Under the woman’s guidance the dinosaurs all turned out remarkably well and Draco bought them for him and Harry to take home. She fired up her miniature kiln and told them to return tomorrow morning to pick them up.
“I’m not.” Draco replied hastily, anxious to get back to his room. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to socialize and get to know the other freshman, but these boxes were getting heavier by the second. “My father is just at the car, getting some of my other boxes right now.” The girl squinted at him for a moment- she clearly didn’t believe him. But then she gave a shrug and strode down the hall, pulling the green eyed boy along in her wake.
“Yes! Of course I had reason for calling. My reason was to tell you to get your ass home before we disown you! There was no reason for you to choose a college so far away and especially one of such low social standing. Do you have no regard for your family and your reputation? You are tainting our family line with this- this- childishness. It’s disgraceful and embarrassing! Not to mention how badly your mother misses you.” Draco’s father shouted into the phone with rising hysteria.
“You two finish the tour, I’ll go help him.” Harry said, leaving the two alone to go help Moony.
“Honestly, Draco, this childish act has got to stop!” His father growled into the phone. “I mean really, ignoring my first twelve calls, I thought that was beneath you!”
Harry nearly dropped his phone, “You’re sure?”
“And you lived with your mother and father your whole life up until you began attending Hogwarts?”
“I know. It’s just hard.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you might have some interesting perspective, not many people grow up in the Muggle world and are aware of magic. I assume your relatives were though, since they had to know how your parents died.”
Draco hurried down to the kitchens and prepared a little picnic for the pair of them to share. The trip couldn’t have taken more than twenty minutes, but by the time he got back, Harry had pulled himself up into a sitting position. Draco slid into the bed beside Harry and pulled the comforter over top of him, snuggling in close to his boyfriend before laying out the carefully chosen meal.
“Ok the last thing you need to be able to do is do it under pressure of people watching. Vanish your patronuses, we’re gonna try it one by one.” Hermione called out, reassembling the group. Panic shot through Draco, he would be the only one who couldn’t do it!
Fifteen minutes later Draco reentered the room. He peered up into the hard faces of the Wizengamot and gulped. None of their expressions gave any indication of what the outcome would be.
“Good, it’s been rather warm here, but the breeze is nice. How are you liking your classes, it feels like we haven’t talked in a while.” She replied. Her voice was a bit raspy and Draco wondered if she was coming down with a cold. Or perhaps it was just a poor connection distorting her voice a little to give that impression.
One of the Hufflepuffs, Macmillan, was glaring at him, and in spite of himself, Draco’s heart sank a little. He figured it was a good time to retreat to his room. As he grabbed up his things, he heard Macmillan mutter, “What’s he going to do? If he’ll only take evil pure bloods, he’ll only have half a team.”
“I’m sorry I can’t tell you how I’m testifying.” Harry truly was. Right now Draco- er Malfoy needed something to comfort him. But legally Harry couldn’t say anything regarding how he was speaking at the trial to Draco, oh screw it he’s Draco now and there was nothing Harry could do about it. The alarm on Harry’s wand went off. “That’s the end of lunch. We should get to potions.”
The beginning of the week was quite nice. Harry spent his time working on odds and ends around Grimmuald Place or hanging out at the Burrow. He was still getting used to the idea of being independent and not needing to stay with anybody. He rather liked to escape to the solitude of Grimmuald place when he felt like he was exhausted from being around people at the Burrow. Though he wouldn’t mind living with another person, so long as it was one person.
He often found himself joined by Hermione who had three tests that week. She was good at keeping him focused on his work, if a bit annoying to be around when she was studying. She had a habit of tapping her pen while she worked and it sometimes made it hard to zero in on the reading.
“Yeah, whatever you need. We can go visit you parents later if you want.” Hermione’s parents were in the slow process of recovering their memories, luckily it worked backwards so they remembered their daughter and that she was a witch, the downside it it would be another six months until they could leave St. Mungos.
“And?”
“I, mean, I’ve never held a baby. Are you sure you want me to?”
They walked down and out of the common room in silence.
Once Draco had finished up his exams, there were only nine days left before Draco would ride the Hogwarts Express one final time. It felt strange to think about that, to think how he likely wouldn’t ever return to this place, this place that had raised him, and taught him and let him grow into himself.
“So, this is probably really boring for you, huh?” He asked, grinning broadly. It was as though they had never had their previous conversation at all.
“Same as usual?” Harry asked pleasantly as he pulled out a small hot coffee cup and scribbled Draco’s name on it. Draco knew there was no point in answering the question, as Harry clearly already knew what he would say, but he responded anyway.
“Yeah. I’m just not sure how to do it.” Harry said.
“But only because you two have put a ridiculous amount of thought into my love life.”
“Good. I really wanna make this work.”
“Sorry. Didn’t hear my alarm.”
—Tay <3
“I know it can be hard, especially with everything that’s happened, so how are you feeling?” She asked again.
“Those who say he was under duress and should not be considered guilty.” She paused to count, “Draco Malfoy is not guilty of use of the Unforgivables. Those who say guilty of attempted murder.” Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy seemed to be slowly starting to breathe again. “Those who oppose.” The witch paused to count again. “The opposition has it, Draco Malfoy is not guilty of three counts of attempted murder.”
Less than a week later Harry walked out of his first midterm to get dive bombed by Pansy and Blaise who dragged Draco and Hermione along behind them.
McGonagall swiftly moved around the room, placing the hat onto each student’s head, until it seemed satisfied. Then she moved to strand in front of us, once more.
“No, I can manage it.” Draco said, “And in any case, I don’t want my things just shoved into my trunk with no care for them, I’d like everything to be orderly.”
“Perfect, no need to dress super formally, and don’t worry I’m usually the only one that works the early riser shift.”
His mind trailed to Longbottom and Granger- no, if he was going to date Harry, then he ought to get used to calling them Neville and Hermione. And Ron and Ginny. He thought that Neville and Hermione would make a good couple, if they did end up going that route with one another.
“So you’re saying she is the reason you were detained in the manor?”
Hope you like it
“We could all use a little bit of quiet now.” Blaise said.
The Malfoy bit was hard to take, but Ron would come around. Wait. He didn’t really have a shot with Draco anyway. Draco had told him outright that he didn’t like him. That thought made Harry almost frown. But he still wasn’t sure how he felt about Draco anyway, or was he sure?
Whoever was on the other side of the door began banging their fist rapidly against it. Draco rose to his feet quickly and glanced around the room for anything he might be able to use as a weapon, should this be a case of breaking and entering. He was just about to cross the room in favor of grabbing up one of the desk chairs when Pansy said, “Honestly Draco? I know you’re in there! Just let me in!”
Draco sighed and collapsed onto his bed, staring up at the ceiling. If Ron wanted to be a child about this, then so be it. Either they’d become friends and put everything behind them, or they’d stay out of each other’s way. It didn’t matter all that much when Draco really thought about it.
Their hayride tickets weren’t for another half an hour so they went around looking at the craft booths and games lining the side streets. There was a local band playing music over at a gazebo in the nearby park.
Ron was going to be an auror. Neville had an apprenticeship with a herbologist. Pansy had something journalistic up her sleeve. Blaise already was getting a business up and running. Harry knew Draco hadn’t quite decided what to do yet. Harry took every opportunity to remind Draco that that was okay, every time Draco seemed to relax a little, so Harry assumed the reminders were helping.
“No. The Malfoys out on the continent want nothing to do with us, and Mother’s only family is a sister she hasn’t seen in years.”
“Not really, otherwise I would be a bit of a hypocrite.”
He entered the chamber and nodded to Hagrid. Hagrid left to take his seat at they staff table. He turned to see a group of awestruck eleven-year-olds.
It didn’t matter that Draco had cried for weeks after Harry had suddenly vanished.
“Of course you still haven’t really asked me out.” Draco said.
“Why are you being nice, er civil, to me?”
McGonagall finished her announcement and headed toward the portrait hole. Draco dashed after her, hoping to convince McGonagall to rethink this entire mess. “Professor!” He called and she paused, craning her neck around to look at him.
He had had a quiet and rather lovely Christmas with his mum. Spending so much time around her had renewed his fears regarding her trial. He knew she missed his father, but he hoped with everything he had that she would not join him in Azkaban.
Draco groaned and flopped himself onto his bed.
“Sure.” Hermione agreed.
This was as it always was, yea after year, these two schools battling it out to see who would land on top. Every year Cadence University fell just a little bit short of victory, and this year was no different.
“Why?”
But that was not a problem for now. He had to keep his thoughts to the present. A present in which he was standing beside Harry in the frigid air of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, trying to hold a conversation.
“She was also there when Voldemort’s killing curse struck me for the second time. Contrary to popular belief, I actually did die when that curse struck. Just as I came back to this side of life, I heard Voldemort order someone to check and see if I was dead. The only thing I could think to do was lie there and hope that whoever checked was stupid enough not to check for my heartbeat. Then I felt these kind hands calmly check for my heartbeat, there was a second where I thought I was a goner. But then I hear these barely audible words in my ear ‘Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?’ The last time I had seen Draco I had saved him from a fire, I assumed that as long as he wasn’t being too stupid or hadn’t gotten in Voldemort’s way he should still be alive, so I told her ‘yes.’
“Absolutely.” Pansy smiled, “Blaise, this is Harry and Hermione they live just down the hall from you and Draco. You two up for the game?”
With that said, would y’all be interested in reading a spin off of sorts? If so, what would you be interested in seeing? Let me know in the comments.
That last one was easy to write since he was in the shop, he liked the atmosphere, and could tell that the other employees were quite happy with their jobs. Mr. Orange was nice as well and seemed devoted to making the place better. He mostly just wanted to work there for money, and probably free coffee.
“You coming to the movie night?”
“Oh.” Draco sounded like he thought he said something terribly wrong.
“Trust me they’ll love you. When they’re in a good mood both Remus and Sirius Lupin have the personalities of small puppies. With just a dash of old married couple.”
Draco had read through Harry’s letter five times now, and still, his brain was struggling to process everything that had been written there.
“Hard is a relative term for this lesson, but I’m pretty sure everyone will feel better by the end of it.”
Blond guy nodded and continued down the hall.
“You know I can tell when you’re leaving something out.”
“Right.”
Slowly people started to flood in, and roughly an hour later Harry was seated in the same chair he was in in November, Andromeda on his left.
Harry draped the invisibility cloak over himself so he wouldn’t be detected on his way into town. One of the benefits of his junior teacher, and probably his war hero, status was that he could head into Hogsmeade whenever he wished.
The end of the year seemed to fly by. Before Harry knew it he was proctoring exams, and taking some of his own. Officials from whatever part of the Ministry was in charge of education came to have him and Hermione take some sort of advanced NEWT exam, it would be averaged with whatever percent better or worse students had done in his third year due to the fact that that was when they had deemed the most recent and still competent teacher. Competent meaning not on Voldemort’s side (Quirrel, Crouch), not an idiot (Lockhart), and not rotting in Azkaban (Umbridge), also they wanted it to be in a year before the pressures of Voldemort had set in on society (Snape). Harry was pretty sure they’d tie exam scores wise with Remus’s teaching so really no impact on them passing the pseudo-NEWTs.
“So, I was thinking… maybe I should plan our next date.” Draco hedged.
Draco sighed and his mind continued to drift. He had a test in Transfiguration next week and one in charms the week following. And there was that Quidditch match to prepare for. He knew he was forgetting something, but- his mum’s trial!
“Sorry, I just,” Malfoy inhaled, “I really like you Harry, like, like you, like you.”
“Sorry, I just,” Better to get right to it instead of dancing around the truth. “I really like you Harry, like, like you, like you.” Draco stammered out in a rush of hurried, nervous words.
“Those who say guilty of attempted murder. Those who oppose. The opposition has it, Draco Malfoy is not guilty of three counts of attempted murder.” Draco finally released his breath. Maybe he would be alright after all.
“I got us tickets for the hayride. We’re meeting Neville and Ron there.”
“I saw him when I got back on Halloween.”
It didn’t matter that Draco still sometimes woke from dreams in which he’d been back on the playground that was their castle, a makeshift crown on each of there heads and a sense of deep longing in Draco’s heart.
“I guess I’m also nervous about meeting your uncles.”
“Okay, fine, let’s get this over with.”
“Thank you for being so awesome.” Harry mumbled once he had finished his portion of the meal. He moved closer to Draco, and buried his face.
Draco still hadn’t come down by the time breakfast duty was finished. Harry snagged some toast, an apple, and a bottle of pumpkin juice to take up to Draco.
He would have to create some sort of practice schedule for his team and arrange for robes for everyone. McGonagall had mentioned that they could choose whatever color they wanted, aside from the other houses robes. That left them with pink, purple, orange, gray, endless options. He knew that certain members, Weasley, wouldn’t go for pink, and he, himself despised orange. Which left purple and gray. The irony in that wasn’t lost on him, as those were the colors adorning the eighth year common room. He supposed they could do some combination of colors too. Like the blue and green decorating both his and Harry’s bed hangings. He would leave the decision until he could discuss the matter with his team.
The friends chattered for a while and got plenty of sweets from the trolley witch. They were all ignoring the fact that they were headed back to a place where they had seen friends and family die. Where Harry himself had died, though only for a few minutes. Harry was glad that he dropped Care of Magical Creatures because he wasn’t quite sure if he could go back into that forest.
The Order had held onto number four as a safe house, so Harry had been able to retrieve his things over the summer. All that stayed in the trunk was the marauder’s map and the invisibility cloak. Most of Harry’s things were still back at Grimmuald place because he didn’t have a use for them during the school year. He had just flopped over onto his bed when he heard the door open.
“Harry!” She smiled and attacked him with a hug as soon as he set down the box, “It has been too long.”
He gripped Harry’s shoulders and began to shake him, “Harry, don’t be dead, don’t be dead!”
The woman was so sweet, even letting them pick what they wanted to make. After much lighthearted debate among the three of them they decided on cutesy dinosaurs. The woman showed them how to shape the pieces of clay and slip and score them, then she sent them to work, each making two dinosaurs of their choosing. She moved back and forth between them, helping whenever was necessary as they laughed and compared their blobs.
“Nothing, I think you’re just not feeling enough. You have a tendency to over analyze, when it’s your turn just feel, point your wand, and say the words. The rest will work itself out.” Harry smiled, and gently lowered Draco’s wrist.
Nothing really stood out to him though. All of it were activities that he would certainly like to try at some point with Harry, but not now, not as this big date. He needed to wow Harry with some fantastical, over the top date.
Yes, if anyone deserved the peace and quiet of having their own room, it was Potter.
“Oh how romantic, I have to stay close to you or I will get arrested. You could at least not bring it up ten minutes before we’re due to leave.”
“Neville Longbottom!”
Draco lurched forward slightly in surprise and spluttered out, “What?” He glanced quickly around the room to ensure no one else was listening in.
“That’s fine. Mother and I did our gifts this morning, so all we have are your gifts.”
The alarm he had set on his phone to remind him to go to lunch with Hermione went off scaring him out of his thoughts. He closed up his laptop and headed out towards the dining hall.
“Did you ever think he might become a death eater?”
“I’m double majoring in mathematics and anthropology.” Hermione smiled, “It’ll be a lot of work but I can’t just pick one.”
The comments especially!
“Oh.” He pulled his hand back “Sorry.”
“This.” Harry leaned down and kissed him.
“Yep.” Hermione said, “We’re freshmen.”
“Kind of. I remember seeing that line, now that you mention it, I just never thought to ask about it.”
That wouldn’t be too much of a problem if there wasn’t that part of him that wanted to impress Draco and woo him.
McGonagall sighed and pursed her lips, “Well, alright, but if you want to talk about anything, I am always here.”
“Yeah, actually. Do you remember how I didn’t tell you why Ginny and I broke up?”
They sat in a happy silence for a minute, staring at each other.
The thought sparked an idea in his mind and he immediately got to work, his fingers flying across the keyboard of his laptop. Before he knew it, the essay had practically written itself. The higher the word count climbed, the more sure he was of himself, and by extension the more complex the essay became. By the time he’d finished, he was quite proud of his work and confident enough to submit it, despite the fact that he still had three days left to get it in.
When Harry finally started to dig into the food it was nearly an hour later. He quickly realized how hungry he was from not eating all day and consumed it rather quickly. Draco sat next to him reading a book, glancing over at Harry whenever he turned the page.
“Are you sure you want to go back?” His mother asked him. Her hands were shaking and her right was clasped tightly over her left forearm. Draco unconsciously mirrored her movement, covering his mark.
They reached the bottom of the stairs, hands intertwined with one another, then Draco’s back was against the wall and Harry’s lips were on his own. And Draco was at ease for a moment, but then there was a sound and reality snapped back in. Harry hadn’t heard it, but Draco, in his ever-growing paranoia, had. He turned his head, only a little, and Harry backed off, looking a little hurt.
While Harry checked out the track Hermione went to the pool for a practice with the swim team. They had already stated practicing for the season and the freshmen only had to go an hour that day because of orientation.
“A bit. But mostly because I’ve got an interesting lesson planned for the eighth years this morning.”
“What I did see Draco do that night was disarm Dumbledore, a fact that helped me overtake Voldemort last May. You see, the elder wand was loyal to Dumbledore up until that time. Late last April, I ended up disarming Draco, leading to me being able to defeat Voldemort even though he had an ‘unbeatable’ wand in his possession.
They had his entire half of the room looking rather good within an hour and all of the boxes were soon discarded. The last thing for Draco to do was to organize the surface above his dresser that was meant for displaying personal items. Carefully he set up the few photos he had brought with him. One was from when he was little. They’d been on some camping trip in the mountains. He was perched on his father’s shoulders, his little arms wrapped nervously around his father’s head. They were both grinning ear to ear. Beside them stood Draco’s mom, her sister Andie, and Andie’s daughter Tonks. Tonks was in her early teens in the photo, her hair a vibrant neon green.
“The Wizengamot shall come to order.” The head wizard spoke, “The Wizengamot shall now decide which charges Narcissa
“Thank you.” Harry took a sip and let the coffee wake him up a bit more.

. And Draco intended to use it to its full extent. So, without another word, he stood and crossed the room, placed his hand against Potter’s chin, cupped his face, tilted it up and then they were kissing. And unless the alcohol was making him hallucinate, which could very well be the case, Potter was kissing him back.
He woke up at the crack of dawn, put on his nice Christmas pajamas in favor of his t-shirt and joggers. He headed downstairs and flooed over to the Burrow.
Please, please, please leave us comments and kudos!!!!
“Ron. What’re you doing here?”
They had escaped and the Dark Lord had shown up. He was furious, in a rage, like nothing I had ever seen. He hadn’t even been that level of terrifying when Draco’s father had failed to apprehend the prophecy.
Hermione looked relieved and Harry was off again. Just as Harry spotted the snitch for the second time about half an hour later, Malfoy called “Abbott and Patil, Padma Patil.”
—Appie
Every now and then Hermione would enquirer about the history of a building and Jennifer usually knew the answer. A few others asked questions about safety, local shops, and rumors they had heard.
The last two weeks of January were a bit of a blur. Harry and Draco hadn’t really been on any dates since the first one, but they were almost always together between having many classes together and sharing a room. It was nice, Harry thought, no one had seemed to pick up on anything, meaning they had some peace for once. It was nice, being happy like this, he had a job he enjoyed, Ron and Hermione were speaking again (though it was still mostly in monosyllables), no one was trying to kill him, the press was leaving him alone for the moment, and he had a boyfriend. He had even gotten all of the glitter from Luna out of his hair, life was most certainly good.
That night at dinner Harry was in much higher spirits. He still felt tired and worn out, but that could be due to not sleeping much lately. Both he and Hermione were eating dinner at the staff table. Most of the rest of the teachers had clocked out for the weekend, leaving the only other teacher being Professor Barlow. She and Hermione were talking animatedly about some Muggle TV show Harry had never heard of, leaving his mind to wander.
“How was Voldemort able to return?”
“How about we just go get coffee or something. I don’t feel like a whole ‘night on the town’ type thing.”
They arrived at Moony and Padfoot’s house at seven o’clock sharp that night. Draco was dressed in a crisp blue bottom down and black pants and had styled his hair to perfection. Harry was dressed in a de wrinkled plain green t-shirt and khakis.
“Ok Draco, you’re up.” Hermione said. Draco gulped and stepped forward, raising his wand with a hand that only slightly shook.
The next morning Draco’s alarm on his wand went off, shrieking and buzzing, but Draco didn’t feel like moving, Harry was so warm and soft pressed up against him. However, it seemed as though Harry had over ideas as he flung himself across the bed and smacked the wand onto the ground.

“Come in,” She called from the other side.
“I might ask him out later this week.” Harry mumbled, then shoved a bite of pasta into his mouth to avoid saying any more.
They shrugged and Daphne said, “Taking her sweet time as usual. How was your holiday?”
Harry walked over to Draco, who had been struggling, he was the only one who was left without a patronus at this point, though Harry thought he had been pretty close a few times.
Nothing had changed since they became roommates, and nothing ever would.
“Our story starts with Slughorn, and one of his then favorite students, Tom Riddle, who would later rename himself Voldemort. You see Voldemort’s main goal was not pure blood supremacy, in fact he wasn’t even pure blood himself. His father was a muggle and his mother practically a squib. His goal was life eternal.”
Harry could hear Ron asking Hermione if she was okay. Harry was glad his friends were together, but he knew a single argument could blow them apart for good.
“Nope,” Harry said resolutely, “Can’t have the others thinking you’re getting special treatment.”
“Hello Harry, nice to see you. You seem to have lost quite a few wrackspurts since the last time I saw you.” Said Luna cheerily.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was taking forever to pack the morning they had to leave. Harry had packed up everything from the bedroom and his classroom a few days before, leaving only the necessities out. It was oddly put together of him. Mature. Like he was an adult now. That was a scary thought.
Afterwards Draco headed back to the hotel room he was sharing with Harry for a shower and a bite to eat. When he stepped out of the shower he toweled himself off and pulled on a pair of jeans and a tee shirt before heading out into the bedroom. “You know,” Harry said from his place on one of the beds before Draco had even fully walked into the room, “It’s only noon.”
“And how many people have you witnessed her kill?”
“You’re my son.” His father replied.
“Very good. Teaching the subject of how he returned has been banned up until now, but since we have witnessed first hand what evil they can create, McGonagall has cleared it for us to teach to this class only.”
They did a quick demonstration then they set everyone up in a big circle facing outwards, so as not to distract each other. Harry and Hermione roamed the inside of the circle making little corrections. Ron produced it right away, as did Macmillan, though both had been able to do it before class.
One of the members announced Amycus Carrow who came in and testified, though all he said was that he threatened Draco into using the cruciatus curse. Dolohov was then led in and he basically insulted Draco the whole time.
He was up in his room grading a couple third year essays in the window seat when Malfoy came in.
She shot him a grin and said, “Yeah, probably. So, worked things out with your roommate yet? By the looks of it, I would say not, unless he’s somewhere around here with more of your boxes?”
He took a moment to gather himself, before hurrying into the showers. He showered quickly before heading to the Great Hall for some dinner. Pansy, Daphne and Blaise were already there when he arrived. Draco sat down with them and immediately began to spoon greens onto his plate. He wasn’t hungry, his insides were still a mess of nerves, but he knew he needed to eat if he wanted to maintain his skill on the Quidditch pitch.
Draco stepped forward once again and froze. Maybe that was just who Harry was. Maybe Harry just wanted to save everyone, it didn’t mean anything. But still, Harry had deemed him as something worth saving.
Harry nodded, smiling himself, “Yeah, it was alright, I guess.”
“I saw Bones, Daphne, Macmillan and the Patil twins.” Blaise said, “So that’s how many people?   Three... seven... nine... fourteen. So if we didn’t miss anyone then there will be fourteen of us.”
“You knew?” Ron asked.
“Of course.”
Draco groaned, “Why not? I’m your boyfriend, doesn’t that come with any benefits?”
When he arrived he picked up a salad and payed for it, then found Hermione engrossed in a book. Her hair was a bit wet and her swim bag was seated on the chair next to her, she had probably just come from a morning practice.
Brittany tipped her head back and laughed. “Oh honey, you and I both know that that is not true.”
The dorm room Draco stood in the doorway of was more spacious than he had originally anticipated, especially for a double. He glanced around at the large wooden desk, with identical beds on either side of it and chairs of the same wood tucked against it. A miniature refrigerator was build into the center, lined with storage drawers, for snacks perhaps. There was a large window behind each of the beds, offering a view that would surely be incredible during sunsets. The lake was visible, blue and glittering in the afternoon light. A gentle breeze glided in through the windows, filling the room with the fresh scent of pine and sand. It was a pleasant combination, and it settled Draco- made him feel more confident in his decision. Perhaps distancing himself from his parents and their plans for his future wasn’t a completely bullheaded choice after all.
Here’s Appie’s chapter, enjoy!
When he was finished, he stood to leave, but was stopped by a brisk calling of his name. It was McGonagall. She walked to him and pressed a piece of parchment into his hands, all he saw in her eyes was kindness. Odd.
—Tay <3
“Sorry, yeah, I’m good.” Draco said quickly, backing out of the touch before Harry could realize what was happening.
“Shit. I’ve got hallway duty. I put up a sound barrier to block the thunder. Thanks for waking me, I gotta go.”
“Ha!” Daphne said, in victory, and turned to face Blaise. Reluctantly, be passed over two galleons.
In his head, Draco ran through the other possibilities. He could be with either of the Ravenclaw boys, Corner and Goldstein. He couldn’t remember any interactions with either of them, but he had seen them hanging around Potter in the past, and they likely knew all about what he had done. There were the Hufflepuffs, Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley. Both of whom were also friends of Potter’s. And Finch-Fletchley was a muggleborn, so he had even more reason to hate Draco.
Harry leaned forward, grinning just as broadly and kissed his cheek. “You sure did.”
The wizard in charge of the trial called everyone to order and began. Andromeda was called up first as a character reference.
“Well, not in those words. But I overheard her talking to Bellatrix. Bellatrix was trying to convince her, talking about what a great honor it was and mum said no. And saying no to the mark is the same as saying no to the job itself.”
Harry smiled. He had moved all the long tables to the sides of the hall, and set up a picnic, mostly of sweets, in the center, with a lot of blankets and a few throw pillows for comfort. The candles up on the ceiling were out and had drifted to their resting place above the staff table, except two
TW: mentioned parent death
“I guess we could watch him. It’s not exactly what we had planned... but I don’t mind.”
“Back home. We went to visit my father’s grave.”
Hermione jetted off to her class and Harry texted Sirius to see if he was free to help grocery shop.
“Remember that we aren’t going easy on you. And that you actually have to know the theory Ronald.” Hermione reprimanded.
And together they set off, walking side by side, their fingers intertwined, the summer breeze running through their hair.
“Go home for a weekend? Maybe? I’m sorry I can’t help you other than to just listen. I know you have a complicated relationship with your family.”
“My parents and I came last week.”
“You helped me?” Malfoy said. He still sat in the chair, finally able to relax.
“Hey.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut as he scrambled up the curved staircase. He rushed into his room and collapsed onto his bed. He knew better than to expect them to forgive him, no one would ever forgive him. After several minutes, he dragged himself into a sitting position. He had to finish his homework. He sighed and got back to work, trying his best to push away all thoughts of Quidditch and the others in his year.
The next group came over. “Today for your assessment you will be dueling your roommate, I expect you to use the most complex defensive spells you know. Like I said to the other group I ask that you do not use anything lethal, illegal, or a spell that could cause severe bodily harm.”
Daphne shook her head, embarrassed. “Well, anyway, mum spent the entire holiday trying to convince her to stay. See, Trace won’t take any of my parents money, so she’s real poor. Mum and dad don’t like that she’s wandering Albania aimlessly with some random person who she’s just met and no money.”
“We all have hard days, and though I think everyone is feeling it today, you probably have the most reason to stay in bed today.” Draco said, running his fingers through Harry’s hair.
“The court is now out of session. An auror shall escort Mr. Malfoy back to Hogwarts.”
Jess’s shift had long since ended, but she had stayed anyways. “How did it go?” She asked, her eyes gentle.
That wasn’t all that great of a response to Draco’s confession, but it was better than flat out hatred, and right now, Draco would take anything he could get with Harry. The next bit made it a tad better and Harry had apologized. Draco didn’t really think he had anything to apologize for, but still...
“For one Ginny. I’m pretty sure Luna just knows, she’s like that about these inner self type things. And Draco.”
“I love you too.” Draco whispered back, looking up to the ceiling. To the stars they’d painted there on a particularly hard day over the summer. The stars that had finally made this room feel like home again.
The chains around Malfoy unraveled themselves and Harry made his way up to meet his roommate.
Here it is! The chapter that gave this fic its name!
Harry smiled, “I- thanks Ron. You’re a good friend.”
“I’ll have a chai latte with almond milk.” Hermione said, “And one of the turkey and provolone sandwiches.”
His hands started to shake from within his pockets, and he forced himself to swallow down that fear and walk in the door, knowing he might never cross over that threshold, on his own two feet, again.
“You realize I’m not going to get him until after eleven right?”
“G’morning.” Harry returned. “Hungry?”
Well, at least Draco did.
Molly was very talkative, chattering consistently as they unpacked, telling Draco about how Ron had forgotten to load up three of his boxes, and they’d been an hour from home when he’d realized the error. Then they’d had to take several stops along the trip to purchase other things Ron had forgotten, hence the lateness. By the end of it Draco was sure he knew her entire life story, along with everything there was to know about Ron. He couldn’t wait for her to be gone, even if it meant facing Ron’s anger.
Harry decided he’d take a run around campus while Hermione was swimming and went back to the dorm to change.
“No.”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, what can I do for you?” She asked, and her smile was kind, if not a little surprised.
“So, it’s not like I haven’t seen your bed head before, we have shared a living space for almost six months.”
Hermione was already asleep over on the next bed so Harry checked the lock on the door, turned off the lights and fell asleep quickly.
“We should get going, it’s almost time to meet Andie.”
“Well if you were to steal a bottle of something from the liquor cabinet to have a celebration for after midterms and invite him to join you…” Sirius trailed off.
Narcissa held her head high, “Yes.”
It was five in the morning. He showered and brushed his teeth, with haste. He dressed as silently as possible and tied his laces with nimble fingers. He took one last look at Ha- at Potter before closing the door softly behind him.
“How about you Sirius?”
“Good, does that mean I can join you?”
Harry told them about his week and how midterms had gone while he drained the pasta and set it out on the table Remus was setting. Sirius poured drinks.
“Oh my, you’re Cissa’s son? I haven’t seen you since your mother sent me baby pictures. I’ve avoided the news like the plague this past year, but I do remember Harry mentioning your trial before. I’m glad to see you’re well.”
Eventually Harry started reading over Draco’s shoulders to find it was a book of Muggle fairy tales. They fell asleep like that sometime around sunset, cuddled close and letting some of the day’s emotions wash away.
“Thank you.” Narcissa whispered into his ear when he sat down.
“The court is now out of session. An auror shall escort Mr. Malfoy back to Hogwarts.” Draco felt like crying when the chains that had been trapping him unraveled. He rubbed his arms, but didn’t stand.
It was nearly a half hour later that Harry finally spotted the snitch. It was hovering just by Malfoy, almost exactly what the snitch at tryouts, why did the snitches like Draco so much?
I would really appreciate if you left comments!
“I wasn’t going to. Midterms are coming up and I want to study.”
“I doubt anyone would sell or rent me something. Though the thought has crossed my mind.”
Now all there was to do was plan lessons and wait for Draco’s response.
“Goodnight ‘Mione.” He rolled his eyes and settled into bed.
“Yup.”
And then Harry went and said the cheesiest thing possible, almost ruining the whole thing as it nearly made Draco burst out laughing. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.”
There was something enchanting about it all. Sure he could hear the sounds of the city a few streets over, but in that handful of blocks that were set aside for the fair, it felt like a little bubble of cider scented air and almost felt like the much smaller town Harry had come from.
“Was Dumbledore’s death strategic?”
“Sorry.” Draco said.
Harry grabbed his books to study from and went to find Draco. His best bet was the coffee house, it was late enough that Draco would be wanting caffeine. He walked into the Rise and Grind, waving hello to Devin, Mr. Orange’s son who worked at the shop as well.
Thank you for all of the support you shown us on this wonderful journey!
“Andie?” Harry looked to Andromeda, who was pushing a stroller, headed towards them, “What’re you dong here?”
He was too scared to notice the hunger that threatened to turn his stomach inside out. He thought he was doing well, turning in all of his work, never missing a single class, even hosting Quidditch practices. But then he was summoned to the Headmistress’s office.
“Hang on, what?” Asked Daphne, stopping in her tracks. Pansy and Blaise both looked shocked too. Draco continued walking and the others had to run to catch up. “How did that happen?”
“People deserve second chances.” Was all he replied.
Sure enough, Potter and Granger were late to the lesson.
Ron dejectedly flew down to the field, as did Parkinson, though she just looked offended.
Draco snorted and shook his head a fraction of an inch. He padded across his room and grabbed an ink bottle, a quill and some parchment. Then he returned to his desk and set to work writing his response to Harry.
“See you then.”
“Since you’re all in one piece, I take it the visit went well?” Harry asked, as he strode into the room.
Harry had been completely oblivious to how soon the trial was, considering that he was speaking at it.
“I got some of your favorites. If you wanna talk I’m here.” Draco said, wrapping his arm around Harry and putting a piece of fruit in his mouth.
“Sure.”
Draco shrugged, thinking back to their fifth year, “The two of them lead Dumbledore’s army in fifth year. They made Longbottom really good, so I reckon they’ve got a few tricks up their sleeves.”
“Shit. I’ve got hallway duty. I put up a sound barrier to block the thunder. Thanks for waking me, I gotta go.” Harry said, before darting off.
“You know those break ins and murders that’ve been happening in the wealthy districts?” Hermione asked.
He thought for a moment. “I told him to use it on them or I’d use it on him.”
“Oh?” Remus prompted.
Harry took a look around the room. Hermione had hung up some twinkle lights and the mini fridge was off to one side. The two beds were set on opposite sides of the dorm and there was a window between the heads of both. Under the window stood two desks. By the foot of Hermione’s bed sat a squat dresser and above it hung her Black Lives Matter flag. A large calendar with photos of animals hung behind the door and the closet next to it was half filled with clothes.
“Okay, but mom, is everything alright?”
“Are you gonna get your own place once you can leave?”
“You sure I didn’t totally screw up?”
Harry passed Teddy back to his grandmother and and said his goodbyes. Then he and Hermione flooed back to Grimmuald.
“Sure.”
He kissed his mother goodbye.

Harry let out a breath as the wizard went through his concluding remarks, the last trial was over. Narcissa wasn’t going to Azkaban. Harry had stepped from behind the short barrier into the main part of the courtroom when he was crashed into by someone.
It was after class one Friday early in December that Harry decided to tell Ron. The eighth years had Defense last on Fridays and Ron usually hung out while Harry and Hermione finished off getting the room ready for the next week of classes. Today Hermione was helping out one of the second years in their office, so Harry was able to talk to Ron by himself.
“If Snape was a spy, how did he avoid detection?”
“Draco.” Hermione said, calling on him and snapping his attention away from Harry.
There were three shifts for night watch. The evening one extended from the first year’s eight thirty curfew to the eighth year’s eleven o’clock curfew, the prefects and head students covered that shift. The night one went from eleven to three, that one was the hardest to recover from. The last one went from three until the end of breakfast, the meal making up for the extra hour tacked onto the shift. Those two were covered by staff members, which meant Harry. Hermione was head girl, meaning she did the evening shift, but made up for it with more meal watches.
Draco was surviving his house arrest, not only surviving it, but actually living it. It didn’t even really feel like a punishment at all. He was closer with his mum than ever before and Harry had visited him at least once every week for a date. Best of all, he only had one more month to go before he’d be able to leave the Manor and begin the rest of his life. Nymphadora’s friend, Jess, was often the auror tasked with watching over him and his mother. She turned out to be a good friend to him.
Next up was Narcissa. She mostly spoke about her family’s actions during the battle of Hogwarts and admitted to Voldemort using the manor as a home base.
Harry had left the party in the common room early. Sure he was the one that won the game, but he had hall duty in the wee hours of the morning, so he was decidedly one of the only two sober ones at the party. The other one being Hermione who also was covering the early morning shift.
They ate in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, then Sirius asked, “So how’s Draco?”
Remember to leave comments and kudos!
He had forced Draco to use the cruciatus on both of his parents. Then they had been forced to preform in upon him. For hours and hours the agony seemed to last and then-
That being said hope you enjoy!
Granger’s eyes were wide, beginning him not to give her away. But hadn’t she realized by now, how weak I was? “I... maybe... yeah.”
The sauce was simmering and the water had finally reached a boil so he could put the pasta in.
When he left that night Harry snuck away to the liquor cabinet and found a bottle of champagne that conspicuously had his name written on it. Sometimes Moony and Padfoot missed their mischief days a bit too much.
Harry had offered to go with him, but Draco had declined, this was something he needed to do on his own. His mum understood that and stayed back too. So, when he set off for Azkaban, it was just him and Jess. He was glad to have her with him, she was not easily fazed and she would make sure he went through with it and didn’t back out. Not only that but she had seen his father since he’d been locked up and she could offer some insight as to how he’d been since he’d been sentenced to life in that prison.
The day finally came for the students to share the research questions they had come up with. Harry and Hermione sat side by side on the teacher’s desk in the defense classroom as the rest of the eighth years filed in. Before they started the class Harry had an announcement to make.
I hope you enjoyed it! I’ll admit, I got a little bit teary writing the end of it. I’m already missing it and I’ve only just finished. I really hope it has lived up to expectations! Leave your thoughts in the comments, as always, I love to read them! I’ll reply to everyone; so if you have any questions or requests, ask! Ask! Ask! If you haven’t left kudos and you’ve made it this far, please leave them for us. Thanks again for all of your support.
The day of Malfoy’s trial arrived. As it was on a Friday he and Hermione canceled all of their classes. Harry would go to the trial and Hermione could get in some time to herself, or maybe to her and Ron.
“Yes, I did. Don’t worry, I’m not planning on hurting him.”
Sunday breakfast in the great hall was always bustling. Harry and Hermione sat with Hagrid at the staff table talking about a new generation of bowtruckles that had just been born on a tree near Hagrid’s hut. He was concerned because the bowtruckles were too young to make it through the winter without help. Harry was simply glad that Hagrid’s new creature project was not dangerous this time around.
The only problem was that Harry had absolutely zero idea of what to get Draco. He shared a room with him for months, they had woken each other up from nightmares, and even successfully not killed each other. Yet, Harry’s mind drew a blank.
“Books,” Draco scanned through the titles. “Potions books, muggle novels, and is this?” Draco pulled out a rather large book, “What is this?”
Here’s my chapter! I had a lot of fun writing it, so I hope you like it! Unfortunately, Appie’s going through a bit of writer’s block, so her chapter likely won’t be out tonight. It should be out sometime this weekend though.
Surely nothing good would come of this.
Draco pulled away awkwardly. “Oh, er, hello mother.”
Draco couldn’t help his smile, “I think it went well.” He turned to Harry, silently asking what he thought.
“It’s not like that, we both decided we wanted other things. She wanted to try girls for a while, I decided I would stick with guys for the rest of time.”
“I was the boy that lived next door to you. I remember when the police showed up at your house. I wanted to go see the cool cars and I wanted to know if you were okay. My parents said no. So I stayed inside, next thing I knew you had moved away and my parents had made it clear that I would never see Prince Lion again.”
“He said yes.” Harry said blushing the tiniest bit.
“Party in the eighth year common room!” Cried Ron and the sixteen students that had gathered to celebrate on the field dispersed to celebrate elsewhere.
Harry wasn’t sure when the eighth years had found the time to decide to use the song that the Gryffindors had made improvements on when they stole it from the Slytherins. But he was glad Ron was getting some confidence from their classmates.
Draco turned his attention back to Harry’s letter. There was much there to take in and he didn’t know what to make of any of it.
“And what actions, befitting a death eater, did you witness him partaking in?”
“Okay it’s in the rec center at three.”
“Room nine!” The sorting hat bellowed, and she hopped up and disappeared up the staircase that led to the girl’s dorms.
“Good, a bit bittersweet I guess. You?”
And then it came to him, clear and wonderful, filling him with warmth.
Draco was glad to be home with his mother. He didn’t like having the auror there, tracking their every movement. He wished he could have gone somewhere else, he hated this manor. It wasn’t home, not anymore. He stared at a spot on the ground, here he had tortured countless death eaters on He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s orders. He moved into the dining room. Here, at this table, he had watched a Hogwarts teacher die. Draco moved into the back room. Here, he had been forced to feed Nagini the remains of some muggleborn child. And just there, he had been tortured for his father’s mistakes. Over there, he had learned Occlumency from
“Right,” Blaise said, “Are you worried?”
“What were your exact words?”
He probably shouldn’t ask Draco out.
“Aside from the look of utter boredom on your face? I was in the astronomy tower at the end of our sixth year and better yet I was spying on you for the entire thing. I know that you mastered both occlumency and legilimency.” He said, and was that a faint blush staining his cheeks? Perhaps it was just the lighting... or Draco’s imagination... or his mind playing tricks on him, making him see what he wanted to see. But was that what he wanted to see? Did he want Harry to be blushing at him? His mind and feelings towards the boy who lived were a jumbled mess that would take weeks, maybe even months to unravel. And even then, would he ever act on what he discovered?
The team cheered and started to make their way to the pitch. Harry gave his new purple and gray uniform a last once over before stepping onto the field. Madam Hooch stood in the middle as a referee, and Ginny and Draco shook hands. The flying Professor whistled and fourteen brooms took to the sky, Draco quickly jogged off the pitch to the sidelines where he would direct the team from.
Draco had been having a rough go of things lately.
Draco was waiting in the entryway for him, “You’re here!” Draco came up and gave him a kiss.
“Thank you.” Harry took the paper and went to pick up his order where the employee called his name at the other end of the counter.
Without giving Harry time to process what was happening next, Draco grabbed the collar of his shirt and made to pull Harry into the alcove.
“Oh, ok.” Malfoy seemed stunned, there was an awkward silence for a minute, then he said,
“I didn’t know you were good at cooking.” Draco said to his mother just after he had swallowed the last bit of food.
Sirius just shrugged and Harry went for the next box, quickly followed by Hermione.
“I see you redid your colors.” Said Harry. He had decided to try to be civil to Malfoy this year, he was going to be his teacher and wanted to treat him and the other Slytherins fairly. Harry might have a newfound respect for Snape, but he was not going to let a grudge get in the way of his teaching.
“You ready to go?” Hermione popped up behind him, she held a few books, a new box of colored pens and highlighters, and a day planner that she had already purchased.
“Hey.” Harry smiled.
“Potter,” He greeted.
“The question is, will they teach us?” Pansy asked, gesturing around to the three of them. “They certainly don’t like us. I reckon they might try and have us killed during the class.”
“Damn, Draco.” Pansy said, surveying the room that was entirely empty of any form of personalization. Unless one were to count the unmarked, standard cardboard boxes. “You’ve really just been sitting here, haven’t you?” Draco nodded, slightly embarrassed. He could have been being productive, exploring campus, unpacking his things. But instead he had sat around admiring the view and waiting for someone he had never met- or spoken to- to arrive. Pansy pulled open one of the boxes and began sifting through it. “No, I wouldn’t join a sorority. I like the idea of them, but they get such a bad reputation that I feel like being in one would negatively affect my public image. And with everything with my parents… I could do without anymore negative branding.”
“Well, I guess that’s goodnight.” Draco said, desperately hoping for Harry to contradict him.
“Yeah.”
“It will be in like half an hour. Just go with her, it’s easier than fighting.” Harry said.
The week seemed to last forever. But at last Saturday morning arrived. Draco was taking forever to get ready.
He thought back to every single Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher he had ever had. Quirrell was dead. Lockhart was living in a hospital, with no memory of who he was, still just as conceded as ever. Lupin was dead, as was his girlfriend, or wife, whatever she was, leaving their son an orphan. The next one had been Moody, or rather, Barty Crouch Junior. Which one should he consider to be his actual teacher? Oh well, it didn’t matter anyhow, both of them were dead. Umbridge, the bitch, was to live out the rest of her days in Azkaban, though granted it was without the dementors. Snape was dead and so was Carrow. It was as though the position was cursed. Some people’s fates had taken a while to catch up with them, others had died on the job, but in the end, none were ‘living the dream’ as they would say.
McGonagall stood and silence fell across the hall.
“Nonsense, you deserve something nice too.”
“Nice to meet you.” Draco smiled awkwardly.
“I was there, wearing an invisibility cloak, pinned against the wall by Dumbledore’s magic.”
He averted his eyes, unable to stomach her gaze for very long.

He was laying on a sofa in the common room, his head in Harry’s lap. Harry ran a hand through his hair and said, “Why don’t you play chaser?”
He had always thought that we would immediately recognize Prince Lion, but of course, they didn’t live in a land of fairytales and magic. There was never going to be some perfectly beautiful reunion under the stars or in the pouring rain.
“I dunno, a walk around the grounds, a raid of the kitchens, or...”
“Since when have you cared about upholding the rules?” Draco asked and he couldn’t keep the bitterness from his voice.
“That’s nice I guess.”
Classes were actually going well, though Harry did find himself up to his neck in grading and doing his own classwork. He and Hermione had spent the past few weeks taking the time to work on where students had been lacking in the upper years. They also had to teach the students to read an Auror report because it was going to be on the NEWT exam. Because of this, they hadn’t really touched the eighth year research project quite yet.
“Well, then, the aurors are likely getting antsy waiting for me, so I should get home. I will see you over the Easter holidays, Draco. Do take care of him, Mr. Potter.”
He was considering getting ahead on the reading he needed to do for next week’s poetry 101 lecture, when his phone began buzzing inside of his jeans pocket. He pulled it out to see a picture of him and his mom, both grinning into the camera. It was his contact photo for his mom. He quickly hit the answer call button and said, “Hey! Mom, how are you?”
Draco was up to his ears in homework and it was only the second week of school. He groaned as he tried to get through his twenty inch essay for ancient runes. He was at a loss as to how anyone was able to write that much about runes. He had only reached seven inches and he had already exhausted all of the topics he could think of.
“Even you know that it’s no fun to drink alone.” Draco couldn’t disagree with that so he said nothing and allowed Pansy to weave him through the crowd.
But now things were worse than ever before. Draco chastised himself internally, that wasn’t true. Things were better now, the Dark Lord was dead. He wasn’t being tortured or forced to torture others every other day anymore. He didn’t have to watch people being murdered.
She gave a sound of acknowledgment and kept reading.
They made it down to the ground floor and Pansy pulled him into a large room where a bunch of people were already gathered, red solo cups in hand and flushed smiles lighting up their faces. Some of them had certainly already had a lot to drink. “So, who organized this?” Draco asked, surveying the growing crowd. In the few seconds he stood in the doorway, more people had pushed past him to get inside.
Harry then spotted the snitch hovering just beside Malfoy. He dived, and grabbed it, but not before nearly knocking Draco off his broom.
With only mild protesting, he managed to drag Harry out the door and down the winding stairs to the ground floor. He plucked a city map from one of the pamphlet displays and flicked it open. After several wrong turns he got Harry to what had been coined the Infinite Garden. It was lined with various shops, vendors and food trucks and was surprisingly crowded for the middle of the day on a Wednesday. Draco supposed that all of these people could simply be on a lunch break, but none of them seemed to be in any kind of hurry.
Harry was shocked, first off, Malfoy seemed not to be playing favorites, by giving one of his friends another chance. Secondly he had chosen Hermione, who hadn’t shown a lick of real interest in quidditch the whole time he had known her, aside from supporting Harry and Ron when they played.
“I was under the impression that I could testify as I please. Therefore I will tell you that I do not believe Draco has committed any serious crimes.” The whole courtroom went up in utter tumult, Potter spoke over the noise and slowly it died away. “I was asked to come here to give my thoughts on Draco Malfoy, so I will do as such without interruptions if you please.” Leave it to Potter to turn an interrogation into some kind of speech. The ministry witch who had been doing all of the questioning thus far leaned back in her seat, nonplused. She waved for Potter to continue speaking.
He had not killed Dumbledore. He had not killed anyone. He had not given up Potter to Bellatrix or the Dark Lord. He had tried. But still, he had become a death eater. He had nearly murdered Weasley and Bell. He had used the unforgivable curses. Things were not looking good for him.
Together, he and Jess apparated to the island that housed Azkaban. Three more aurors were waiting for them when the arrived and they took formation, surrounding Draco, like he was the center of a diamond and they were each a corner. The November air bit at his face, and Draco pulled his scarf tighter around himself. It was protocol for the aurors to take his wand and cuff him. But they’d only done the former, opting that the latter was a bit overkill.
Enjoy! Don’t forget comments and kudos!
After eating the two headed out and followed their route back towards the dorm until they reached the bookshop Harry had seen, the Red Riding Book.
Just as he had suspected, when he woke the next morning, Harry was already gone. Draco groaned and rolled out of bed. It took mere minutes for him to get ready for the day, once he was, he padded down to the common room. Blaise and Daphne were already there, but Pansy had not yet made an appearance.
He found the best available seat to be one of the study nooks and sat down, taking out his phone to fill out the application.
Here’s Appie’s lovely chapter!
No, this was not his home. This was a prison, that he had grown to loathe over these past few years.
“Yes.”
Potter!
He’d be able to get the rest of his boxes in one final trip. Draco wanted to go right back down, but he didn’t that girl to catch him out alone again. With the way she had acted, he doubted she would let him slip by without more questions and scrutiny. After twenty minutes he poked his head out in the hallway and peered back and forth. The coast was clear of the girl, the boy and anyone else, so he hurried back down to his car before he could be intercepted by anyone. He made it down alright, but on the way back up he was not so lucky.
“You were the best candidate by far, Mr. Malfoy, now this is no longer up for debate. You will be the captain and you will run the tryouts this Saturday. Am I understood?” She asked severely.
He looked healthier than Draco had seen him in a long time, certainly healthier than he had been while serving You-Know-Who. The bags under his eyes had faded some, from the deep purple they’d been to a dull, hardly visible blue. And in his eyes, Draco hadn’t seen that in a long time- hope, pure and unfettered. It was then that he realized how much he’d missed his dad, and that he forgave him, or could forgive him with time. So, reached forward and embraced his dad. His father returned the hug without hesitation, holding him close. “I’ve missed you.” His father whispered.
The rest of the day came and went and Harry admitted that he had loved Draco’s date idea. The next morning while Harry went around the room packing up their things, Draco made the trek down to collect their dinosaurs.

“And he was found guilty of being a death eater. But Potter also said my father didn’t fight in the battle of Hogwarts. He talked about how both of my parents were just looking for me.” Draco explained, “So he was only sentenced to fifteen years in Azkaban before parole, a life sentence, monthly visits allowed. It’ll be easier for him there without the dementors.”
“I- no! He had been raised on pureblood ideals, he was arrogant and might have thought of himself as superior, but he was never a killer.”
“Those who say not guilty.” She seemed to stare directly at Harry, knowing that he was the only reason so many thought Draco innocent. Yet all the other members stood. The witch frowned. “Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is not guilty of murder. Use of the Unforgivable curses, those who say guilty please stand.” A lot more stood, but from what Harry could tell they were still in the minority.
“I’ll take a hot chocolate and whatever baked good you think goes best with it.” Hermione said, “And my girlfriend will take a decaf black coffee and a croissant.”
They ended up having three days to themselves at the end of term. Draco had been begging to know what his grade was on his defense exam. Harry refused to tell him, mostly because he had no idea what Draco had gotten. He and Hermione had made an agreement last summer that they weren’t allowed to grade essays of people they were dating. This was still when he and Ginny were trying to give it a go, just before they both realized they had completely different desires. Harry had wound up grading all of Ron’s essays that year, in the beginning because he was dating Hermione, then because they weren’t speaking and after that well, it just became habit. Neville’s essays had made their way into all of Harry’s grading stacks since March, and Draco’s had been in Hermione’s since they came back from Christmas.
“It was my father’s. But Dumbledore had it when my parents died.”
Draco was nervous to say the least, he didn’t say it, but the way he couldn’t sit still all day when usually he was the one helping Harry focus was a clear sign something was up.
“I can’t promise when I’ll visit next, but I’ll write, as often as I can.” Draco said and stepped across the threshold, closing the door softly behind him.
“And do you miss me?” Draco asked, turning the key in the doorknob of his dorm room and shouldering the door open.
“I guess I’m- I’m fine.” Draco mumbled quickly, his eyes settled upon his knees, one of which was continuously bouncing up and down, an unconscious sign of his nerves.
Sirius seemed to need the distraction too because he looked very concerned and tired when Harry had asked him about work that day. They parted ways after leaving the store, Sirius saying he needed to go back to the station and finish off some paperwork.
A while later he and Draco were on a walk around the grounds Harry was admiring the way the light reflected off some icicles on a tree when Draco said abruptly, “I can’t wait to get out of this place.”
Harry felt his heartbeat pick up a bit, he had forgotten to tell Draco when to show up. Idiot. “Oh, uh, eight? I’m not quite sure when Hermione is going out, but she’ll probably be gone by then.”
