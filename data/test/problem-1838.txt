But that would be easy to do, by engineering a “menses” crisis – Draco was sure Granger was a good enough actor to convince Molly Weasley the girl believed she might be pregnant, which would make it very clear that Ron had given her some reason to reach that conclusion, of course. Not enough to actually void Virginity, but sufficient to make it a possibility…
“What do you mean?” Potter asked quickly, grabbing Draco’s hand and pressing it against his cheek again, green eyes huge and expressive.
Harry had just snatched up the Crystal Sceptre, and said something to Weasley that left him gaping like a fish, and swept out of the Great Hall, the rose still clutched in one bloody hand.
Draco leaned forward and kissed the other thigh, a couple of inches higher this time, using his full mouth this time so his warm breath would burn Potter’s flesh, which bore goosebumps from the night air.
offspring to draw on his parent’s magic, but holds the average of his older brother’s magical potential – far above
“Well…yeah, she asked what happened in Potions…she was really interested, you know, though she did lecture about destroying school property. She won’t tell anyone, Malfoy.”
“There’s a reason it’s called Dark magic. This is the least objectionable form of that ritual that is possible to perform.” He told her.
“That’s actually…quite advanced.” Draco admitted, impressed despite himself. “And Granger understands all this?”
“It would have to be more than an opportunity…you would have to essentially offer the Dark Lord up on a platter. Lord Malfoy, I beg you to consider your limitations. Given his magical inheritances, the Lord Potter may be a worthy adversary the Dark Lord, but you are not.”
“We’ve been acting the same way for seven years, do you really think we should start being nicer now?”
“Ew, no. I mean the fighting. Father said he always supposed they must have one of those relationships where they hate each other so bad it turns backwards. Whatever that means.”
AND BE SURE TO WASH IN THE MORNINGS AS WELL, NOW THAT YOU’RE OLD ENOUGH TO BE HAVING NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS. IT’S UNHEALTHY TO HAVE THAT STUCK TO YOUR SKIN ALL DAY, DEAR.
“Most any bird can be trained, Harry. Owls are just more intelligent than most.” Granger lectured. “What’s wrong Ronald?”
eat those pancakes before you leave this table.” Molly Weasley looked like some kind of culinary executioner standing over him, legs braced, with the rather large spatula brandished in her hand like a cudgel, drops of fatty liquids dripping off of it with every gesture.
“Potter has all of Slytherin’s gifts. It really shouldn’t be such a surprise, father. We knew he was a Parselmouth in my second year at Hogwarts, and that gift is only hereditary.”
“I…I…I” Granger was, remarkably, at a loss for words for a moment. “Oh dear! Look at the time! We’ll have to table this proposition for consideration at our next meeting. Adjourned!” she huffed, and immediately started bustling about gathering her many color-coded charts and even one impressive animating graph.
A large shallow receptacle of the finest crystal dominated the left end of the table, countless tiny candles floating in the water inside it.
“Well. Regulus, James, perhaps we could have involved you more in the birthing process. I suppose it’s not every day another heir is added to the family. But to break into the nursery in the dead of night, and upset one of the family ghosts-”
“Please, I’ll do anything if you’ll put me with Regulus! Anything!” James begged piteously. “He needs me!”
“So then the people assigned to greet them on the train knew enough about them to make a good impression.”
where the line is when you’re doing it. Because these young ones need someone to look up to with trust and worship. Make sure you don’t turn that into hatred and fear. Make sure they know you’re on their side. Because if they don’t, no matter how you meant it, what
Regulus exchanged fist-bumps with his twin and then with Frankie, exchanging a smirk for Rose’s disapproving frown, and then headed up to meet the Sorting Hat.
He was immediately dropped unceremoniously on the floor, where one of the twins sat on him while the other wrestled him, protesting angrily, into his new sweater.
“Just because I’m on your side doesn’t mean I’ve stopped my scheming. Now stop asking questions about your gift, it’s very improper.”
And now, thanks to Potter’s actions, Draco had the clear mind he would need to make sure that Potter’s entry into that family happened in a way that was beneficial
Draco followed the man outside, then into a medium-sized shed. Inside was what appeared to be the elder Weasley’s workshop. Odd artifacts littered the area, some of them clearly Muggle in origin and others were just…
A ring of light glowed around a particular cubby hole. Draco moved to it quickly and started pulling the scroll out, then stopped, frowning.
The Head Auror blinked again in surprise at how accommodating the Headmaster was to their suspect, but nodded slowly.
Harry shuddered, and Draco hesitantly put a hand on the small of his back. Harry didn’t pull away, at least.
They studied each other’s faces for a long moment, expressionless, but searching for some hint of which way the other would lean. Both knew either decision would be kept secret until the moment of betrayal.
“What now! Oh. What can I do for you, Draco?” Severus Snape answered the door pleasantly enough once he realized who was knocking.
Ronald Weasley and the extremely powerful Mudblood witch Granger were a case in point. Though, disturbingly, the red-head took to his burden with an enthusiasm that was surely an unhealthy form of denial.
“Um…well…Muggles don’t usually think of ingredients in terms of their origin. Like, lacefly wings, captured during a full moon, or whatever. Everything is actually made of mixtures of less complex substances…Muggles have identified the most basic substances that everything else is made of.”
Two enormous swans, gliding in to land gracefully before the Golden Trio, each holding the end of a bright red ribbon in it’s beak, suspending the long, slender package between them.
“Don’t worry about it mother, I know where they are.” Draco said dismissively, then leaned in to kiss his mother’s ivory cheek. Her hand rested on his arm, just above the elbow, thumb tensing inward between the first and second vein.
Draco thought about that night they’d staked out the Potions classroom. Potter’s Muggle shaving potion filling the small tent with an intoxicating scent. Potter’s lustful magic stabbing at Draco when Draco’s erection brushed against his backside.
“And well you shouldn’t. One Gryffindor in the Black line is more than enough for the next few centuries.” He smirked. Then saw Jamie’s matching smirk aimed back up at him and grinned widely.
Lucius breathed a sigh as the low-level panic he’d had running in the background receded somewhat. Despite his somewhat rocky relationship with his son-in-law, Lucius knew one thing. Harry Potter-Malfoy was a wizard holding a magical heritage that was unprecedented since Merlin, and more importantly had the will to use that power to protect those he held dear. And Draco was the keenest advisor ever to stand behind such a throne. Whatever new darkness stirred, once warned they would not stop until all they had built was safe from it.
Narcissa and Bellatrix smoothly rose from their seats, and Draco led his father in bowing to the women.
“Inspiring a Romantic Revival”…might be useful after the 100-year-honeymoon charm had worn off, but not terribly helpful at this point
“Draco…I…I…” Draco cut off the Gryffindor with a kiss to his blood-flushed lips, then buried his face in Harry’s neck, moving his lips minimally in vague kissing motions against the pretty tendon he found there.
“He referred to you as ‘Malfoy’.” Blaise said with a knowing look. Professor always referred to his Slytherins as “
“So, Harry. I’ve done a bit of research about the Muggle world, and I’ve come to the realization that no matter what wizarding ritual I use, even the greatest gifts in the wizarding world aren’t going to result in a marriage contract. You’re expecting…
these days? Does the house make hateful noises at night? That line has been isolated before, it’s why Blacks tend to go insane, and it’ll go down that path twice as fast a second time if it’s not reunited with a proper blooded Lord soon.”
“Well you certainly said so. You were convinced you should have him as a pet, and then when you discovered his identity you decided he would be your best friend.”
Potter was gaining. Draco cursed his father for not buying him a better broom to match Potter’s Firebolt, then remembered he could have rectified the situation himself before the game.
Even if Scorpius wasn’t, technically, his. Tom decided he was far too attached to the squirmy bundle to allow some fruity blood-relatives take him away, wizards or no.
The atmosphere was tense as the First Year Hufflepuff boys prepared themselves for the ritual ambush and pillow fight that the Second Year boys traditionally sprung on their successor “sprogs”. It wasn’t a secret, exactly. Not even the ambush part.
A brief chatter broke out in low whispers around the room until McGonagall quelled it with a look, and Tom took his place on the stool.
“Luck, Potter. You’ve got it in spades. It’ll run out eventually, I’ll take centuries of breeding and a lifetime of the best lessons money can buy over your cheap luck any day!” Draco snarled.
“Don’t you die, you bastard. I won’t lose you!” Harry whispered fiercely, arms coming around Draco to lay him carefully on his stomach.
? The boy-who-lived? He’s just a symbol. I’ve dueled him, he’s no threat to one such as you.” Draco sneered.
Lucius obliged, glaring at the ball-point pen his son innocently offered him before pacing into the library and checking off several texts with an old-fashioned quill.
Draco leaned forward and touched those lips with his, and when he opened his eyes again Harry’s green eyes were looking back at him.
“Oh! Well…perhaps Proposition four-twenty-seven isn’t such a great idea then.” Granger said, a bit haltingly.
Draco knew he had some thinking to do. All his life, he’d been taught that the Dark Lord would one day return, and that Draco would one day take his father’s place as his right hand. Lucius had apparently believed the Dark Lord to be immortal, no doubt due to his own scrying. And he had been sure that the House of Malfoy would benefit from a close association with the powerful wizard.
than what Draco had been hoping for. And not in a good way. He frowned down at the offending headline and let himself read it carefully, word by word.
And in keeping with that determination, Potter showing up looking suddenly respectable brought on a topic Draco knew would have the advantage of putting the Gryffindor entirely off-balance, and at the same time serve as an obvious offer of peace.
plan to use them in a ritual first. Nothing that will reduce their value to their rightful owners, you understand. But very helpful to my plans.”
Muggles! Oh Merlin, a Founder’s blood could get mixed with undiluted Muggle blood and lost forever!” Daphne was hyperventilating. The Common Room was in an uproar over this conjecture, the older students properly horrified while some of the younger Slytherins looked about to cry.
Draco grabbed Potter’s shoulder, leaving his wand-arm free to move, and turned him so that they stood back to back. Then he spoke over his shoulder.
“He’s mine, I found him first! You’re not going to take him away from me!” He growled, walking around the bassinet and placing himself between them and the sleeping infant.
Well. Potter certainly hated Professor Snape. And he was also a Marauder. Perhaps it was time to turn his love of a good prank to Draco’s advantage.
“I was nearly done with the first layer of spells then. If you’ll be quiet I can finish up the last in the next five minutes.”
An hour later, Potter’s hand was noticeably shaking as he held the small sample of Confusing and Befuddlement Drought in his hand.
“I think I’ll indulge just the same.” Dumbledore popped a lemon drop into his mouth, his bearded mouth pursing at the sour taste as he sat back in his chair with a sigh.
Draco paused to think about that. If the Marauders could be said to be a group or club, and the Map was property of that group rather than the individual members…damn, then Potter was right. Well, as much as he hated to let Potter alone with his impressionable cousin, he wasn’t going to deny her access to a magical artifact powerful enough to detect animagi at a distance.
? It’s…Harry…do you not feel the magic in this? Do you have any idea what happens when something like this is knitted by a witches
“I believe we’ll be seeing Thomas quite soon. If he’s made the impression in Slytherin we expect of him, he’ll have been delayed for a few minutes for some last-minute alliances with leadership figures. Now as a Malfoy, I’m sure you realize that you are also expected to make it into Slytherin, so I want you to pay close attention to your brother as a role model, and try not to learn too much from those other three ruffians. Always remember, my son, be as wise as a serpent, so the lovable fools can be the innocent doves.”
The witch raised an eyebrow at him in query and he gave her his most serious look. She turned to her companion.
“Severus, my boy, I hope you will not repeat my mistakes.” Dumbledore chastised gently. “You of all people understand how such low expectations can back one into a corner.”
there, along with various background information on the reasons behind each item. This should be no problem, even with the rather inept Potter in the mix.
“My first gift was a legendary magical sceptre that can potentially heal lycanthropy, and my second was a near-absolute protection charm powered by my own magical core. You may have observed a pattern that I’m not taking half-measures in this courtship. Surely you can deduce my choice for a blood gift.” Draco said.
“I take from your selection of Barrister Seymour to attend the meeting, that you wish to finalize matters with the Parkinsons?” Barrister Murdoch asked…solicitously.
“No need. The bond is irreversible. You’re old. After tonight there will be no real longterm threat to the House of Potter-Malfoy.” Draco sneered.
Draco watched a slightly smug grin slip onto Jamie’s face. She’d mentioned Granger on purpose, knowing it would distract the Slytherins from the bald-faced lie she’d rather clumsily uttered. They’d have to work on that, of course. Though her misdirection was admirable. But still…better that it’s not necessary.
Potter obeyed, they turned, catching each other in almost a waltz position, and Draco shivered as he felt the singe of a spell flying past his ear – Potter casting a powerful Expelliarmus at a Death Eater that had appeared behind him.
Or so Draco had planned. And so Draco had determined. Of course, that decision had been based on incomplete information. It had based on a…well…in all honesty a rather foolish assumption that sexual play with Harry Potter would be just a better version of the sexual play he’d enjoyed with Pansy, as well as with the various desireable Slytherins of both genders, since he’d first come into his pubescent desire for such things.
He looked down at Scorpius and felt a soft smile warming across his face. What with Tom's intense protectiveness, he hadn't had the opportunities to hold Scorpius that he'd like. The drowsy warmth of the infant cradled in the carrier on his chest was a feeling he’d dearly missed since the twins had grown up.
“Lord Malfoy. Last night you used a portkey to take you to a foreign location, where your activities or continued travels are unknown until you returned to Hogwarts this morning. During that time, I’m sure you aware a notorious prison breakout involving one of your close family members occurred. I think you can see we have enough circumstantial evidence to bring you to the Ministry for questioning if we choose.” Shacklebolt began.
“Well, I guess I just have to accept that when you tell me things that sound insane, I should trust you because it’s your realm of expertise. Insanity, that is.”
“Well, I’d say we should put to use what we have…the perfect spy.” Draco said, turning to his cousin. “Jamie. You’ve gotten close with those three lately, now that they’ve accepted you as one of their Marauders. Do you think you could get the information out of them?”
“I happen to know that Potter dreams of domestic bliss with a certain rival of his.” Draco smirked. “It’s simply a matter of turning them from empty dreams to a possible reality in his mind.”
“There’s no defying about it. I’m the Lord Malfoy. It’s my decision. Father …if he ever gets out of Azkaban, will abide by the decision of the Lord Malfoy. And…what do you mean Potter can’t be attracted to a boy? Has he said so? I know there are
gives the caster extreme pleasure. Why do you think it’s so popular? Powerful spells require balance. You split your soul to kill another’s. You extend your will to imprison another’s. You fill your mind and body with incomprehensible bliss to cause incomprehensible pain to another’s. If you felt what the Dark Lord felt, of
“I think that’s our cue to leave.” Draco said hurriedly, stuffing the muggle book into his robe pocket.
old pureblood generational magic, and I know how to recognize when it’s doing something it shouldn’t be trying to do. Remember I told you how family magic goes a bit mad when it’s separated from its bloodline? This was a bit of it. Suffice to say, we’re lucky we didn’t get locked in there for nine months. You can at least bet our Chastity charms aren’t going to be very dependable.” Draco told him patiently.
Several hundred yards away a small group of people were running towards them…Dumbledore the lead. The Portkeyed wedding guests.
“We just went through the mathematical proof. It is not only possible but a necessary result.” Lucius smirked.
“Harry!” Draco protested violently. The last thing he wanted was to attract the Dark Lord’s attention to an intimate dinner between his chief lieutenant’s son and the Boy Who Lived.
has created would be child’s play to our own curse-breakers, and to many a thief as well. The level of expertise you need is simply not out there, we’ve hired all the best ones ourselves…this is how we insure that our wards are impenetrable in the first place!”
“Good then. Thank you gentlemen, I look forward to your prompt report.” Draco said, ushering them towards the fireplace.
“See? So it’s night-time, he can’t fry us!” Frederick said, standing resolutely to his feet. The others followed.
“Sorry. Muggle saying. They tend to joke about it because they don’t really remember it. I meant the parental interrogation.”
“Troublemakers.” Draco cut off the rosy picture Potter was trying to paint abruptly. “They’re the grand masters of chaos and consternation. They exist to thumb their noses at authority and propriety.”
“Well, I suppose first we should settle on a name for you. Too many people would connect your last name to Voldemort. You have a claim to the Malfoy legacy through your tie to Scorpius and your status as my adopted son. You have ties to the Black and Potter legacies as Harry’s adopted son. But since you are not a blood-heir those will grant you only secondary status if you end up in Slytherin again.” Draco said.
“I see.” Draco frowned. That would be a waste. “How do you think she would respond to an opportunity to engage in magical research instead?”
“You hate me! Why do you hate me? I’m good, I clean, I cook, I’m very quiet! I really am quiet! Why do you hate me?” Potter’s lower lip trembled, green eyes twice their normal size and filling with tears.
“Well. That’s certainly rich. I think you can keep your ‘I’m sorry’ and instead just stay the fuck away from me. Malfoys are typically very long-lived, and I’m quite happy with that.” Draco said coldly.
The portrait moved to the very bottom of the page, and a thin horizontal line extended itself just beneath the portrait.
“Professor. Zabini. I think I’ll retire to my room, now.” Draco said politely, sweeping out the door.
“Well, they do. It’s called Sorting. We’re not allowed to tell new students how it’s done yet. But you do get some say in where you’ll go. If you already know where you want to be, you’ll probably end up there.”
“Oh bravo! Yes indeed, oh very good. That’s the one for you Mister Potter. Basilisk fangs can be extremely temperamental, but it seems it’s willing to bow to your judgement. The wand chooses the wizard after all.”
“Well, as I said Potter, I’m taking you to Diagon Alley to buy your school things. We’ll apparate because it’s far easier than going through the Leaky Cauldron.”
Snape looked conflicted for a moment but soon gathered his composure again, “Harry you’ve suffered neglect and abuse from your muggle relatives, which is unforgivable of them. I want you to know that I am not your enemy and that you can talk to me about it.”
Harry was stood on another footstool next to the blond, and Madam Malkin slipped an identical robe over Harry’s head.
Harry soon realised that magic was practically the only explanation for talking snakes, that or he was completely off his rocker.
“Didn’t you get our letter?” drawled the stranger as if this was the most boring conversation he’d ever been subjected to.
Snape gave a Harry an almost sad look, but he was pretty sure that this intimidating man had never been anything but fully in control of his emotions, “Your parents are in no state to look after themselves let alone use their Gringotts account. So its control has been passed on to you.”
“The headmaster of Hogwarts made me live here?” asked Harry, immediately taking a dislike to the man who had sent him into the heart of an abusive household.
Harry put the letter out of his mind and didn’t think about it again until the early hours of his eleventh birthday.
Harry jerked his head up so fast he thought he’d jarred his neck, “But they’re still alive, why is the money mine?”
Snape tapped the door with his wand and held it open for Harry to scurry inside. He then stepped in behind him and shut the door behind them, leaving them in total darkness.
“My father is next door buying my books, and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy, he had a bored drawling voice.
Harry shrugged, “I just like them,” He didn’t want to mention the fact that he could hear them talk, and speak back to them. He wasn’t sure if that was normal.
There was a brief hush in conversation. Harry could only assume Vernon had shaken his head in reply.
Harry didn’t understand any of what Snape said, but he’d always been taught from a young age that adults didn’t like children asking questions, so Harry stayed silent.
There was an almost unnoticeable crease of sadness that made itself known in between Snape's eyebrows, but it vanished almost as quickly as it came, “Bobbin show Harry to the bathroom so he may brush his teeth and wash his face before he goes to bed.”
Harry sat down and waited for Snape to arrive, he soon made an entrance and sat down as Bobbin started serving a thick creamy soup and large chunks of fresh bread.
Opal nodded her tiny head, the light from the fireplace reflected in her pink eyes making them glow a vibrant red.
Harry grinned to himself as he watched the dying embers of the fire. Opal still appeared to be asleep curled up on her footstool. He’s been through a lot recently but it was all for the better. Soon he’d be going to Hogwarts to learn magic, and he’d never have to see the Dursley’s again!
Slipping out from under his threadbare duvet Harry swiftly dressed in his cousin’s ratty hand-me-downs. Once he was decent he peeked out from behind his cupboard door. It wasn’t uncommon for Vernon or Dudley to give Harry a good whack early in the morning when their moods were particularly foul.
Harry and Draco glanced at each other, “You’re Harry Potter?” asked the blond boy. He looked a bit shocked.
“Corn snakes only eat about once a week and mainly eat mice. But they won’t turn their noses up at quails eggs and other rodents, however, yours is only a hatchling so she’ll need to your help her find baby mice at first. But once she’s grown she’ll be able to find her own prey.”
Vernon whimpered and scurried away, Harry felt the thump of his footsteps as he went back upstairs. What could of the stranger done to scare his usually unflappable uncle?
Snape greeted his godson with a slight incline of his head and the barest hint of a smirk, “Well it looks like you both need wands, shall we make our way to Ollivanders?”
Snape stepped into the room and closed the door behind himself, “I’m afraid I only have one bed so you will have to sleep on the sofa for now, but I’ll talk to Dumbledore and sort something else out for you soon.”
Harry could only presume that Vernon had pointed in his direction, because the stranger’s footsteps swiftly approached his cupboard.
But Harry knew it was something important, not just because it had a vault all of its own but because he could feel the magic rolling off it like a thick mist. He wasn’t sure how he knew it was magic, but he could feel it buzzing deep in his bones.
“Many muggles are afraid of magic, and unfortunately your family seems to be on the more extreme end of the scale,” replied Snape with an air of disgust.
It held a single and very dead baby mouse. Harry almost felt sorry for it. It was a tiny pink thing smaller than his little finger, however, Opal seemed to appreciate it and her tongue started to flicker out and taste her meal on the air.
“So Potter,” Asked Snape, “Which one do you want? Strictly speaking snakes aren’t on the approved pet list for Hogwarts but no one ever pays any attention to that rule.”
“May I suggest you buy your school robes first, and perhaps some everyday wizarding clothes,” said Snape gesturing to a cheerful shop called
There was an exasperated sigh from the stranger, “Believe me Mr Dursley I would much rather be at home myself, but I’ve been sent to collect the Potter brat.”
“Why on earth do you want the little freak?” questioned Vernon, his voice had warmed to the stranger slightly. It seemed he approved of the stranger’s negative attitude towards Harry.
Harry’s guess was proved correct when his large cousin squeezed into the room. As Dudley passed the stove he gave Harry a sharp poke in the ribs with his elbow, nearly making him drop the teetering stack of plates.
Harry was plating up the still sizzling bacon when he heard the thunder of heavy footsteps on the stairs. Judging by the rapid speed it was Dudley.
Despite the ease of his school work the day seemed to be going so slow it almost felt like it was going backwards. All Harry could think about was the letter waiting for him under his mattress at home. Despite the slow passage of time, the end-of-school-bell finally rang and Harry hurried to collect his bags and homework. Anticipation coiled and squirmed in his stomach like a writhing snake.
“Because you didn’t send an owl with your reply back to Hogwarts, I've been sent to collect you and take you to Diagon Alley to buy your school supplies,” replied Snape.
The stranger replied rather gleefully, “Just a stinging hex, you best go back to bed because the next time my hand slips it won’t be so forgiving.”
Harry stayed in the corner of the room until he heard the familiar clink of the letter box and the flop of mail on the doormat. Harry went to fetch the post without an order, already knowing what to do after years of this routine.
Harry swallowed and forced back stinging tears, “Why did my aunt and uncle lie to me all this time?”
He’d never liked bacon or eggs they were too salty and rich for Harry’s simple stomach, but the few dregs of orange juice he’d managed to scavenge over the years had been delicious.
Harry’s bed springs bounced with every step his uncle took down the stairs and a few spiders fell from the ceiling, Harry gently fished a particularly large hairy one out of his hair.
Snape faced Harry, “That was a house elf, as you probably noticed her name is Bobbin. If you ever need anything while under my roof, so long as it is within reason, feel free to call for her. She’ll gladly fetch you anything.”
Snape answered her, “Yes, we’re looking for a breed of snake that is relatively docile and doesn’t grow too big,” He glanced at Harry, “It would also need to be non-venomous.”
Harry had never received any mail in his life, let alone an envelope that looked so regal. It was even sealed with glossy red wax. Harry’s heartbeat was in his mouth and he felt his fingers tremble under the heavy parchment.
The soft chirp of crickets and a stifling warmth greeted Harry and Snape as they stepped through the door, and Harry felt the scorch of unblinking reptilian eyes follow him around the room.
Harry listened intently and for a while he thought it was silent, but sure enough he heard softly approaching footsteps. Then the hard crunch of gravel as someone made their way up number four’s driveway.
Harry dressed swiftly and skipped brushing his teeth, fearing that his uncle would come back downstairs and try to stop him leaving with Snape.
As soon as the table was cleared and the plates were washed up, Harry rushed out of the door and tried to make it to school on time.
Harry heard the stranger step closer to his cupboard, and start unlatching the numerous locks. Harry wondered what he’d do when he got to the one that needed a key.
“Welcome to Diagon Alley, Potter,” said Snape, clearly enjoying the dumbstruck look of amazement on Harry’s face.
He tucked in with gusto but found himself unable to eat all of it. Harry was not used to this much food and it was giving him a stomach ache, but he felt awfully rude not eating Bobbin’s carefully prepared food.
Instead of going to interrogate Vernon for it, the stranger murmured a word harry didn’t understand.
So Harry made the beds, vacuumed the carpets, dusted the shelves and watered the houseplants. By the time all that was done it was nearly six o’clock and he had to make a start on dinner.
The tall graceful man practically glided over to the two boys, he had a sort of aristocratic elegance Harry had only ever seen portrayed on TV.
A few seconds after the chime went off there was the sound of scuffling upstairs, and the heavy thump of his uncle’s footsteps.
Harry and Draco both paid for their wands and left the wand shop. Harry also bought himself a small discreet wand holster for his wrist.
Harry swallowed and nearly said they were dead, when he realised that no they weren’t, not any more.
Snape seemed to notice this and consoled him, “Harry, don’t feel like you need to eat all of your food. Bobbin won’t be upset, I’ll brew you up some nutrients potions soon and we can get your appetite back on track.”
However, Harry knew better than to judge a book by its cover, and was proved right when he entered the store behind Snape.
The boy’s father was a tall man with long hair the exact shade as his son’s, and Snape was striding along at his side like a particular sinister shadow. They seemed friendly enough with each other. Well as friendly as the stern potion master could be.
The reptile witch gently held the little snake out for Harry to hold. He carefully accepted the snakeling.
“I wondered when I would be seeing you Mister Potter,” said Ollivander, gliding closer to stare at Harry, almost so close they were nose to nose.
He entered the shop feeling rather out of place. All the bright cheerful robes felt mocking next to Harry’s tatty hand-me-downs.
Harry once again gripped tightly onto Snape’s arm after making sure Opal was secure. This time round Harry was prepared for the tight squeeze of darkness, it didn’t make it any less overwhelming though.
Harry noticed that he was quaking with fear or excitement (he couldn’t tell), this definitely had something to do with the letter he’d received a few weeks ago. Was he about to be finally saved from the abusive house of the Dursleys?
The stranger didn’t seem any more annoyed than he already was, and answered, “My name is Severus Snape, I used to be a friend of your mother and I’m a teacher at Hogwarts.”
Draco even hadn't admitted it to himself until that moment, but it had to be true. This tingling, that he had already felt at their first encounter in St. Mungo, had been so real and had not subsided since then. Draco swallowed once and nodded tightly. Now Harry could joke about it, he would go through this with his head held high.
His feet stop in front of a compact brick building. Slowly he creeps in the alley between this building and the next, so that he comes to the small backyard. Draco’s eyes wander up the façade and his heart skips a beat, when he sees dim light shining out of a window on the first floor. An idea strucks his mind and he bends down.
His colleagues nodded and got to work. Draco grabbed the bottle and hurried to the lab in the back of the ER. Skillfully, he examined the red liquid and quickly realized that he was absolutely right. After all, potions and poisonings were his passion! At the small but well-equipped brewing table in the corner he quickly made a suitable counter potion and was proud of himself. He, the young healer, had known it before anyone else! He had saved Harry Potter!
“The ferret? Why the hell would he come!” Weasley burst out. Always dependable to demonstrate the Gryffindor temperament, those Weasleys.
Draco smiled and kissed him on the lips, letting his tongue just barely dance into his mouth before pulling back.
.” Draco sniffed disdainfully, as if goblins hadn’t been entrusted with the wizarding world’s wealth for millennia.
Draco snapped his fingers and the meal disappeared from the table, replaced by four crystal glasses, two half full of water, and two half full of a deep red concoction.
, the contract between the Malfoy and Parkinson families for the marriage of Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson was voided. As of today, Notice is served within the acceptable limits, as consummation of the royal union has not yet been completed.”
He was suddenly enfolded in a four-armed hug between the two men, and Harry nodded as Draco behind him said into his ear,
are not a monster, Harry. You made your choice. You made your Vow, and you’ll never go down that road.”
Three hours later, Harry woke up from his nap and found Draco still seated at the massive vanity, carefully applying the third layer of charms to his gleamingly straight hair with a silver comb and his wand.
“Ch-ch-chastity spell.” Draco told him, backing away as Harry came to him for warmth. “No. We need distance or it’ll get colder.”
“Well that’s the only thing bloodlines and money can’t buy. Time will tell. I’m done with my hair, let’s go tell our friends our news.”
“Excellent, then we may begin! Young Lord Malfoy, is the Blood gift prepared to be presented?” the Dark Lord demanded.
Potter stood on the top of a hill, which was covered in human remains. A few of them recognizable. Weasley, Granger, the little Weasley, the werewolf, everyone in the school, in fact. The Dark Lord’s fresh corpse stood discarded not far from Potter.
Draco screamed as Potter’s intense magic burned into his body, plunging angrily into his core and slicing through every nerve he never knew he possessed.
“You are out of place here, werewolf.” Draco sneered at him. “This is to be a royal wedding party, not a blood raid. Get back in the Cabinet.”
“I just don’t get why you’re…look mate, he tricked you, alright? He used the whole courtship thing to get what he wanted.”
“He read my mind? Those daydreams…that was him reading my mind?” Tom asked, seeming more interested than offended.
founders will certainly qualify as an overriding prospect for Beneficium Superus. I hope you haven’t started negotiations before consultation from counsel.” Seymour said, all business.
Draco shoved his husband in retaliaton, but could not help the lift in the corner of his mouth at the thought.
“What? Ahhh! A bat! No…a man? Look, he’s a man-bat! Eww, oh somebody my mouth is gross! Wait, what’s this stuff…I’m wearing a dress? I’m not a girl, just because I…er…I’m
you start talking like you’ve finished! You have grandchildren, now. You have a powerful son-in-law you’ve barely started to get to know. What is
Draco glared at the interfering witch before pushing the very embarrassed Harry off him so he could get out of the hospital bed.
“I told you. Draco.” Draco corrected him. “As for your question…I really think you can figure it out.”
Malfoy just sat, watching him as he finished his rant and sat back down. He let the silence stretch for a long moment, then spoke.
Of course, the latter was quite old-fashioned, as most Slytherins had evolved to more subtle ways of demonstrating their satisfaction with whatever plans they had hatched. Preferably,
, which I’ll confess I really don’t have any idea how to give you.” Draco said, playing the honesty card as Granger had suggested.
“Welcome to Merlin’s College!” Hermione Granger called out from the podium. “I’d like to remember all of our students that we have a
Draco just stared at him. His mother was one thing. If an outsider could read him that easily the secret would be out before he was ready.
my godfather, Harry. You didn’t think he’d let me walk into this completely blind, did you?” he said with a tinge of sarcasm. The thing was, his godfather
“Malfoy.” Granger said softly from behind him. “You might try talking to him. Harry values honesty above all.”
“I think we are all well aware of the copy of him that remains.” Severus put in. “Draco, you are my godson and undeniably brilliant, so I will trust you when you say that this version was purified in the ritual and is no longer the Voldemort that was. That does not mean the same boy could not go down the same path.”
“That was beautiful! For just a moment I don’t think I had any thoughts at all! I’ll have to remember this for the next Wrackspurts attack! Thank you!”
Dizzy gasped, and immediately pulled out an ancient-looking bed-warmer, the handle of which was encrusted with jewels, and began beating herself over the head with the brass coal-pan on the end.
“It’s a fairly common practice Potter. You have the Black title, and no Black blood. That has very bad magical consequences for the House of Black. There’s really only one way to fix it. I have it on good authority that you despise my Aunt. Unless you’re harboring some secret plot to steal my mother while Father is in Azkaban, Jamie is really your best candidate.”
“Go on! Open it!” Harry said encouragingly. Draco glared at his boyfriend, who seemed to find Draco’s ongoing cat-and-mouse game with Molly Weasley to be a great joke, and had in fact revealed this hilarity to his two friends, who had agreed.
And then he had his inspiration. But… well, it was Hufflepuff, it as about friendship, but Draco had been very stern to him about understanding how to make friendships work.
Lucius smiled at the man. He didn’t know how a muggle had gotten into a magical school, his son and Granger must be playing fast-and-loose with the Statute of Secrecy, but he knew he wanted to be there when Jonas found out the truth.
Potter was quickly on his knees before Draco, cupping his face in his hands and examining him anxiously.
Tom smiled at him, even as his mind churned in reaction. He had not expected it would come so soon, but he had prepared for this.
grin at her. Draco blinked his eyes rapidly to dispel the disturbing image from his retinas. Sodding Potter may be powerful, he may even be respectable and perhaps even good-looking when he decided to dress himself like a grown-up Lord. But he was not going to be fucking
“Yes my Lord, it is true. Generational magic is cumulative, and as different from an individual wizard’s power as we are from squibs.” Lucius groveled.
He turned towards Greengrass, elevating his height, for the nourishment potions Draco had plied him with had allowed him to sprout up with the delightful ability to tower over most boys. Orpheus was no exception, and Tom loomed.
no love-life, or a prospect of one, until Draco could figure out how to court the damned muggle-raised Gryffindor.
The stands erupted in a deafening roar as Draco shakily pulled himself into a sitting position…just in time to see Potter’s face flushed with victory and hear “…AND HARRY POTTER HAS CAUGHT THS SNITCH! GRYFFINDOR WINS!”
“Malfoy I…I didn’t realize this was what you intended when you said I could help her get to know Sirius. I…I don’t think I can do it.”
Draco paused for a long moment, looking up at Potter’s face with a wicked look on his face before he spoke directly at Potter’s bouncing penis.
NOW, RONALD, I’M SURE YOU’LL BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT YOUR UNCLE RON WILL BE VISITING FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR. HE’S LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN, AS YOU’RE HIS NAMESAKE, AFTER ALL. I’VE PULLED OUT ALL THE OLD PICTURES OF YOU IN YOUR CUTE LITTLE FANNY FLUBBERWORM BLANKIE THAT HE GAVE YOU AT YOUR FIRST BIRTHDAY,
“Professor McGonagall. Well, Hufflepuffs are very friendly and loyal. I’m very surprised they didn’t find you and try to befriend you already.”
“Well, one project at a time, dear Aunt. I’m currently seeing to the reunification of line-of-title to blood, next generation there will be a proper Black Heir.” Draco said.
Lysander shushed him, looking around a little at the attention his outburst had gotten. When their housemates returned to their conversations, he spoke in a lowered voice.
“Potty likes kitty, hey? Maybe you should trade notes with that old squib caretaker, huh? I bet old Filch knows some tricks that make Mrs. Norris yowl like a werecat!” he continued.
“What ever is wrong with sand-traps? Quite effective, I’d think. As much as I appreciate all the flashy effects of your wards here, I’m quite content with simpler ones that will prevent a thief from entering. In any case, the consultants I’ve hired are quite competent and trustworthy.”
“But he hassss them anywayssss, young Lord Malfoy! Why do you ssseeek to dissstract me from thisss necesssssary disssposal?”
“Dude, you are. I mean, I don’t know James. But, probably he’s like you but different, right? So, you both want the same things, but maybe you have different ideas how to do it? And maybe he’s right! Not about being separate – but, look. Lorcan and I, we threw a
“He was so…so…powerful when I met him. And happy, he was always laughing and carefree.” He remembered.
The portkey brought Draco to the gates of Hogwarts, and he entered the Great Hall just in time for breakfast.
Flint made an odd ritualistic gesture with one hand that Tom didn’t recognize. He made a mental note to ask Draco about it but then realized this was just the sort of question he’d just been given leave to ask.
One solid punch to the nose sent the boy hero reeling backwards, a satisfying fountain of blood spurting outwards as he fell. Draco was on him, following him to the ground in a tackle.
“Potter is Muggle-raised. In my interactions one thing is clear, that he knows nothing of wizarding traditions. I know nothing about the appropriate rituals and conventions he would expect. I’ve attempted to research this myself, with little success. I’ve even approached a close associate of his, receiving only very terse advice. In my dealings with Potter I know him to be quite tenacious about his Muggle values. I expect success in negotiation will depend on observation of
“It is a hybrid of the old Celtic handfastings ceremony and the Saxxon-Latin Soul-Bond Ritual, using a number of symbolic and potions-based factors to increase the influence of the bond without sacrificing identity.”
“Good evening students! I’m pleased to welcome you all to yet another wonderful year at Hogwarts! This year we have a few changes that I’m sure many of you will be happy to take advantage of. We will be offering two new elective courses, one in Ritual Magic and one in Hybrid Magic. These are available to students in fourth year and on, with exceptions made for younger students who can pass an entrance test.”
Draco retaliated for the tease by jabbing his fingers into the Gryffindor’s stomach in a tickling motion, then running for his life as his boyfriend came for revenge.
“Boys, you have to understand that you didn’t grow up being frightened every day. Afraid for your lives, or your family member’s lives. People…don’t think straight about things they’re afraid of. And Voldemort is a name that most people
from destroying my potions laboratory.” Professor Snape said, eyeing Neville Longbottom distrustfully.
Draco looked up, and was thankful for the menu half-covering his face. He was sure his impassive expression had faltered for at least a second.
Harry’s eyes were wide as the mediwitch performed a complex charm in the general area of Draco’s abdomen.
“We’ll find a way.” Draco argued, snaking a hand around Potter to cradle his lower back in his hands, pulling him subtly toward himself. “Potter, if there was a way, to get it over with and get married right away, would you do it?”
So. Granger would have to be offered a specific project. Probably put in charge of the project, considering her rather controlling personality. And…a project she would find interesting. Perhaps her interest would be snagged by a project to combine Muggle and magical theories for potions making?
Warm steam billowed out into his face, and Draco cast a quick charm to prevent the cold air outside the room from streaming in and giving him away.
“Well then. You’ve volunteered to donate the memories without compensation. I suppose it’s only appropriate, since you’re responsible for her inability to meet the man for herself. In that case, I suppose negotiation isn’t necessary. As Jamie’s guardian I’ll provide the Pensieve. I’ll warrant Granger can assist you with the necessary transfer spells. Once the Pensieve is full you can deliver it to me and I’ll handle things from there.” Draco suggested.
The whole thing tingled and itched distractingly. Certainly not the Dark Lord himself calling him, thank Merlin.
A bolt of red slammed into the shield and Harry’s voice made Draco shiver as he cast a borderline Dark spell at the attacker.
Then something very strange happened. A green line started drawing itself, stretching away from Potter’s portrait. The picture of Potter eyed the green line warily, and Draco’s stomach rebelled as he recognized the particular shade of green.
The old woman watched for a moment, drawn to the infectious sounds of happy youth as she leaned on the post that supported the roof over her porch. Ready to call the children and their exuberant guest in for dinner.
Tom scolded himself for his inappropriate Muggle slang. In wizarding culture the Inquisition was still the stuff of genuine nightmares.
Not “trust”. That would be an insult. An assumption that one’s allies were so foolish and sentimental that they would ignore a chance to increase their own fortunes if it presented itself.
“They’ll still be very close to those Weasleys though. They could still influence them.” Someone conjectured.
“Today you will be brewing a potion you learned about last year. The Confusing and Befuddlement Draught. I will be returning your essays on the subject from the last year to you, and they will be your only reference.” Professor Snape said evilly.
Draco slipped a finger along the edge of the pages, watching as they fanned past, hoping for some chart like that Periodic Table in the chemistry book.
“After reading that Chemistry for Dummies book…abominable title, by the way…I’ve decided to fund such a research project.” Draco said casually.
The noise of a hundred some students hissing under their breaths as they read this was interrupted by the “thunk” of Harry Potter’s head hitting the table in despair. Draco looked over with concern just in time to see the doors to the Great Hall slam open and the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, strode in, accompanied by several Aurors.
Nodding once in return, Draco accioed the tiny bonding knife from his pile of clothing and carefully cut the binding runes into his skin, just above the left hipbone.
“We’ll get plenty of time later. Now let’s find Ron and Hermione so we can get some kissing action in.”
Still. The place had been part of the Malfoy holdings for centuries, and as one of the family “secret places” it held a certain special force of generational magic. Severely depleted, for future generations, due to this unprecedented alien occupancy, Draco thought sourly.
“Are you sure all your books are in your trunk? I forgot my Potions book once and that didn’t work out so well...”
VERY WELL, GIVE MY LOVE TO GINNY AND HERMIONE, AND MAKE SURE HARRY IS USING THE PROPER PROTECTIVE SPELLS WHEN HE’S WITH HIS SPECIAL SOMEONE, UNDERSTAND? I’D HATE FOR SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO BE RUINED BY A MOMENT OF YOUTHFUL LUSTS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL! NOW I DON’T KNOW IF HARRY HAS BEEN SEEING A BOY OR A GIRL, BUT THERE’S DANGERS IN BOTH AND SINCE I’VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU THE BIRDS AND BEES TALK BUT NOT HARRY, I’M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST YOU TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO HIM, SO HE DOESN’T GET A GIRL PREGNANT, OR GET HIMSELF PREGNANT, OR VOID HIS VIRGINITY BY ENGAGING IN PENETRATIVE-
a true son of Slytherin! I’m sure none here could dream of a better guardian for Slytherin’s lost heir! How long has he been training you if I may ask?”
Draco stared at the shirt, reaching out a hand to trace the ‘D’ when he felt it…that tingle of magic…that odd quirky Weasley magic, of course. But why would it be in the shirt? Perhaps it had some warming charms on it…Draco pulled out his wand and tapped it to his eyes with a spell to enable magical sight.
A door appeared in the corner, the Room responding to his wish. Draco quickly pulled his robes shut as Jamie came in, gasping when she saw his hand.
But there had never been another person there either. He couldn’t hear now, the wind and the thunder too loud, but he thought he knew where his new friend was hiding.
Weasley nodded begrudgingly, recognizing the formality. Potter on the other hand was clearly not happy with the arrangement.
“Potter fancies…” his voice croaked, before he was suddenly lunging for his pensieve, enlarging it and grabbing up Snape’s vial, pulling the stopper, and pouring it in.
It had seemed a miracle, one the veteran spy had sat slack-jawed to observe, and his thankfulness had always been tempered by a kind of distrust in such a deus ex machina…left to wait for the other shoe to drop.
“In the future, Potter. If I ever am so stupid as to take you into my confidence again, I expect to be consulted before you inform anyone else.” Draco said tightly.
Draco sneered, secretly hoping that Harry would grab him by the lapels of the muggle suit he was wearing and
“Okay, we’ll have to actually make a working potion…lets see…sneezewort, scurvy-grass, and lovage are the inflammants…alihotsy and glumbumble counterbalance each other to impede the brain processes…jobberknoll and scarab effects inverted by dragon blood and hellebore…sopohorus…hmm…”
“Oh, Harry…yessssss!” Draco moaned, the pulsing length of hard flesh was burning his insides with magic and he felt swollen and full and burning with inner fire and Harry, Harry, Harry on top of him and Harry’s smell around him and Harry’s power racing through him, and Harry’s wonderful manhood buried deep, deep inside him.
“So…it needs to work when we test it. But after it’s bottled and added to his stores…” Draco let the thought hang.
Draco exhaled and held his breath to counteract the flush that rose. Somehow he felt like Lupin knew he’d blushed anyways.
“I’ve repelled the initial lemon drop incursion and the Headmaster and I are about to have tea, how are you?”
those rituals were. Muggles were hopelessly casual and unregimented about things, they had none of the careful dances that magic ingrained into wizardfolk because the consequences of each gesture had no automatic magical result.
“I think we’ve discussed the social drawbacks of overt favoritism from the teachers.” Draco chastised his sons. “In any case, you wouldn’t get much use out of them.”
“Now, if you could please act appropriately, let me remind you that the Blood sacrifice has been arranged, and my father and I will be disposing of Dumbledore momentarily ourselves. The rest of you are here only to disable the castle wards from the inside,
Draco looked at his father. The man was proud, as any Malfoy was proud. But it seemed he was capable of admitting his mistakes. The despair that came of doing so was a testament to that pride. But…in time, once that pride was knocked down a bit more it could one day be rebuilt.
AND WHILE WE’RE ON THAT SUBJECT, I’VE TOLD YOU A HUNDRED TIMES I CAN SENSE A SILENCING SPELL ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE, HAVEN’T I?
“I think I’m going to have to insist on my barrister being present before any questioning takes place.” Draco started off.
“Harry. I want you to swear an Unbreakable Oath to me that you will never use an Unforgiveable again.”
And then he heard Potter let out a roar as he finally came, surge upon surge of his magic firing into Draco in pulses, and Draco found himself collapsing on the floor under the waves of Potter’s magic, exploding in his own pants with each pulse…and then Potter was climbing out of the choppy bathwater, crawling naked towards where Draco had collapsed, dripping water and suds on him as he frantically separated Draco’s burnt hand from his wand.
Draco just smirked evilly, sparing a wink for Jaime, and putting one hand in his pocket to check on the scroll there.
The boys appeared to be slightly winded, no doubt they had run the entire way from the Slytherin dorms. Draco frowned, considering ruffled state of both boys, but decided to ignore it. Physical activity was healthy at their age, however undignified, and Draco had conceded the argument with Harry that their children should be taught how to act like adults where necessary but not forced to by habit.
Scorpius.” Draco told him. “We know you aren’t evil, but we won’t risk the life of our son. If your existence itself is a threat to him, I will do what is necessary.”
“Something like that.” The smooth, cultured drawl said. “If several years of bitter rivalry can be classed as a kind of friendship.”
Jamie turned to him, looking slightly at a loss for just a second before she realized what he really wanted. Her eyes locked on his in understanding, then shuttered into expressionlessness as he’d taught her.
“Ooohh, Drakie-pooh, don’t be cross with your Auntie Bella! But why’d Drakie have to kill the pretty werewolf? Auntie Bella liked the werewolf?” Bellatrix pouted.
Draco pulled Potter into a kiss, feeling that raw magic burning against him once again…strange that he’d been craving the uncomfortable sensation…as Potter’s tongue dueled with his.
’,” Draco let his first name drip with sarcasm, since he had no choice but to use it anyways, “we both know you’re not capable of transfiguring moss into a mouse, much less a Malfoy into a small rodent.”
Draco Malfoy!” Fenrir leered insolently at him, leaning forward into Draco’s personal space to take a deep sniff.
“Father. I know you regret your actions, and Severus was a spy for the light. But you both still bear the Dark Lord’s magic in your marks. Magic that Tom here is intimately familiar with, and not in a positive way. I could not risk your involvement, even indirectly. Bonding magic is very sensitive.”
“Gifts given as part of Heirloom, Magic, Blood are exempt unless they are unjustifiable.” Draco reminded him. His barristers had done their research.
Draco frowned at that reminder. Why had he had to be such a prat at that age? Things would be so much simpler now…
“It’s good that he laughs now, and with those close to him. There’s no dignity in needless solemnity.”
In seconds, there was a tangled mess exhausted of children, teen, and wolf on the lawn, each feebly attempting small vengeful attacks on the others. Interrupted nicely by the clanging bell that signaled dinner.
, he swiftly recoiled from a potential danger, throwing the book he’d been pretending to read into the air as a distraction as he smoothly drew his wand and settled expertly into a defensive stance.
“Take this and clean it. I want a new towel immediately. You’re to regularly clean and replace this towel every morning while the room is empty. Understand?”
“I think a small dose of Veritaserum is all that we need to establish that you were not involved in the attack on Azkaban.” Dumbledore said simply.
“Four aisles to your left, take a right, go two stacks down and take another right, they’ll be on your left at the end of the row.” Draco told her.
Draco swallowed. It had only been two generations, and she was only a Weasley by marriage. She should be the easiest to win over.
His parents had always been a tender subject for Harry, his aunt and uncle always made sure he knew about what awful people his mum and dad had been.
Snape nodded and withdrew a tiny golden key from his pocket, “I also have a letter from Professor Dumbledore.”
The desk witch smiled at Harry and informed him about his snake, “Now, as soon as you name her she’ll bond to you as your familiar. You’d best do that before you leave the shop, otherwise she might make a break for freedom.”
This time Harry managed to scavenge some toast crusts, the better half of a grapefruit and a few mouthfuls of scrambled eggs. All in all it was one of his better meals.
Harry couldn’t contain his gleeful excitement and a wild grin exploded across his face, “So will I get to leave the Dursleys for good!?” he asked jubilantly.
Harry nodded gratefully and Snape’s sofa looked a lot more comfortable than his hard, old mattress at privet drive ever did.
“I’m going to go buy some potion ingredients from Knockturn Alley, I’ll come and collect you shortly,” said Snape as he pointed to a shady looking street off to the left.
Working on auto-pilot Harry’s mind wasn’t on what he was cooking, it was firmly set on the mysterious letter hidden in his cupboard.
Snape addressed her again, “We have a guest staying, his name is Harry Potter. He will be sleeping on the sofa, please make up a temporary bed for him. We will also be needing supper, oh and see if you can find a small mouse for Potter’s snake. Thank you Bobbin, you’re dismissed.”
“Opal,” said Harry firmly, and gasped as he felt the shimmer of magic that bound him to the little snake, Opal obviously felt it too because she gave a little wriggle of contentment.
The stranger muttered something under his breath and there was a sharp zapping noise followed by a yowl from his uncle.
“Well your parents left you a small fortune so you don’t have to worry what you’ll look like at Hogwarts,” reassured Snape. He knew how important it was for a child to fit in. A luxury he never had.
He tried his best to prise it off without cracking the wax, and grinned happily to himself when he succeeded. Harry stowed it away in his rickety bedside table away from the prying eyes of his aunt, along with all his other treasures. (A mother of pearl button, a battered lego Gandalf, and a lace handkerchief Mrs Figg had given him.)
The stranger didn’t seem perturbed by Vernon’s shouting at all and calmly replied in his slick, oily voice, “You really have no choice in the matter, I’m afraid I’m taking the brat whether you like it or not. The boy has had a place at the school since the day he was born. And as for tuition, you needn’t worry about fees. That is all taken care of.”
“I seek power only to defend myself and Scorpius from people like you. How could you do that to Regulus and James!” Tom said accusingly.
Potter had, of course, been a long-absent member of this massive chess game. First James had incited controversy by marrying a mudblood, and then the two of them had gone into hiding under the Fidelius, and then been assassinated, and their only heir had disappeared into the Muggle world.
“That’s a disgusting remnant of a patriarchal concept of institutionalized possessiveness!” Granger sniffed in disgust. “If there’s no option to end the marriage, it becomes an involuntary situation and you’ll both feel trapped in it.”
“Your grandfather turned his back on his friend when he needed him most! When my father was in pain your grandfather told him he had brought it on himself…though now you say it was your grandfather’s doing in the first place! Your grandfather sought to control my father’s choices, and when thwarted, withdrew his friendship as a punishment! A friendship that was to last a lifetime! It was used as bargaining fodder for blood-politics! A brotherhood that was from the heart was made a negotiating ploy! Your grandfather murdered the greatest treasure of my father’s childhood – by throwing his friendship in the dust at his feet.”
“But I’m not a part of some evil wizard! I’m just a kid! I just found out I was a wizard today!” Tom protested.
there. Then I rode out of there through this tunnel, and met Harry and Draco like nothing had happened.”
Dizzy, like many house elves, was extremely old-fashioned, and had refused to part with the bed-warmer she had used in her early years. As house-elves were not permitted to have personal effects that served no purpose, she had adapted it to this one.
“In the meantime, let’s try to keep a cool head about this. Draco is confident the evil of Voldemort was purged. We’ve been cleaning up random pieces of his old spellwork for the last decade, and taking a cautious and unpanicked approach has always been best for that. The Dark Mark is a particularly ugly piece of magic, but I don’t see any reason we should abandon the methodology that has worked so well for it.”
“No, just a plot to marry him and have his babies.” Draco was mortified at this point, thankful that at his age the Veritaserum at least gave him the small dignity of a flat, hypnotized-sounding voice and slack face.
? Work for that meddlesome old fool? I suggest you spend more time on your books and less time concocting foolishly elaborate conspiracy theories.” Snape sneered.
“If you want to have your delusions about what is and isn’t love, well…I don’t mind waiting to hear you say the actual words if I must.” Harry finished.
Tom kept his voice warm, signaling this would be a recurring humiliation but one delivered gently, a tease that could be affectionate if his favor was maintained. For an already awed-over boy like Orpheus Greengrass, Draco had assured him, such a mixture of treatment in combination with the familial debt itself would engender a persistent desire to please him, if carefully tended.
Draco sighed “That’s why I wanted him there. My father is a proud man, and he’s taken recent revelations pretty hard. The other day he was talking in a way that made me very concerned. How is he managing with all those muggles?”
you should make a decision, it should be made wisely. You are Potter’s contemporary, you’ve essentially grown up together. And if he survives this war you will live your life feeling the atmosphere of his full potential power in the world. That can be a very good thing or a very bad thing. You have a very different set of choices than this old man.”
The slender girl made her way up to the front and sat, ducking a bit as the Sorting Hat was placed on her head.
“Harry. It’s not pain, really. It’s just so intense that’s the only way I can describe it. You’re just so powerful, and your mother…Malfoys normally don’t marry new magic. We’re very sensitive, our magic very refined, so raw power overwhelms us. Do you feel my magic when you touch me that way?”
“The fact that you exist proves there was once something good about Tom Riddle…at one point he was capable of love. That part survived. And that part is who you are, Tom.” Harry said gently.
“Tell him to bring his Cloak, then. And…oh, you should be the one to put the talisman around his neck. Make sure he wears it, then come back here. I’m sure this Room can make a pensieve.”
“I’ll have the tailor come by to get updated measurements while we’re out. You’ll need to get some Muggle clothes. You’re aware they’re integrated with the Cambridge campus, aren’t you?” Draco called over his shoulder as he walked out of the library in search of his sons.
“That’s a bit less than the Potter heir, isn’t it? Perhaps you should re-evaluate your theories, son. Clearly-”
The headmaster sagged a bit in his chair. Yet another sacrifice of principles for the old man. Dumbledore
“I have to agree with your father, sons.” Draco added. “And after you get your wands, before Hogwarts, we’re going to perform a secrecy ritual to make sure you don’t let slip Thomas’ identity to anyone. Not
“Harry, Granger told me to be honest with you. And…I really don’t think it’s a good idea, but she said it was absolutely the most important thing that I always am honest with you.”
“Zabini.” He said coolly. Blaise may have been his childhood friend, but at their age at least the minimally proper forms of address should be adhered to in public areas.
"I'm willing to step outside." the politician said. The last thing he wanted was to be a direct part of an illegal interrogation by Veritaserum.
“You’re teaching him Occlumency. And I’m pretty sure the Dark Lord doesn’t know it. You’re Dumbledore’s spy.” Draco said, stating it as a positive fact.
as his core rebalanced itself, and he could look down to where Potter’s head of sopping-wet hair (still somehow looking like a ludicrous mess) was huddled miserably on his chest, Potter pressing his face desperately into Draco’s stomach as he cried.
“The old fool is just an old fool.” He waited a long moment, watching his father try to puzzle it out.
As he spoke into the curly hair between Potter’s legs, Draco watched Potter’s penis moving…slowly…reluctantly…rising an inch with each heartbeat and falling a half-inch…rising and falling…tipping ponderously over to rest on Potter’s other thigh, hovering there on each heartbeat and coming down to rest farther along on an arc from the inside of his thigh…up the tops of his thigh…to point sideways along his hip…and then finally take its proud place pointing upwards towards Potter’s chin, bouncing an inch above his stomach.
“Good morning. You must be Jamina,” Draco said, ignoring the glares from the studious types all around.
The Lord Draco Malfoy strode through the narrow corridors of the Hogwarts Express like a young blonde god. Or so he thought of himself.
. However, the nature of my gifts are such as to not only be valuable gifts to Harry, but also to allow
A few minutes later, a breathless Frankie Longbottom joined him at the Gryffindor table to somewhat more muted greetings.
“Never mind.” Draco skimmed over Potter’s essay, and more importantly, the extensive red markings from Snape in the margins…and started thinking through the puzzle, mumbling aloud.
White phosphorous smoke drifted out of the opening, and a small crystalline platform resolved itself as a multi-faceted pyramid sticking up from the depths of the box. The top of the pyramid cracked open, the facets sliding down the sides of the pyramid revealing…the sparkling diamond ring inside.
Tom couldn’t argue with that. He walked to the threshold where Harry and Draco stood waiting for him. He looked up at the two wizards, shyly.
“Quick! Grab your hardest pillow and put the others under the covers! We’ll group up in my bed. Go-go-go-go-go!”
Harry collapsed on top of Draco, still inside him, and Draco felt the universe right itself again as the waves of pleasure receded.
And once again, Severus found himself with no option but to seek out power, make himself valuable to a slightly less objectionable Lord, in hopes that he might be protected as an asset.
“You want me to choose the Light. You don’t want me to take His Mark. You think I can still make things good with Potter. I can’t make a well-considered decision if I do not have every relevant fact at my disposal.
“Jamina, what a pleasant surprise!” he said evenly, rage boiling in his eyes “How did you find New York?”
He opened the bag and took out a small locket, a gash opening a hole in the center where the tiny bonding knife had pierced it. He dropped it in front of the stunned Dark Lord.
A blue flickering at the doorway informed Draco that he’d crossed the threshold…the magical trap was locking on and would strike in just a second…
Narcissa sat down carefully, her fear evident in her eyes. She was only Malfoy by birth, her mask was a learned thing, easy for Draco to see through.
Hermione looked down at the baby. Sure enough, the tiny face scrunched in a yawn, and then the eyes opened slowly to view the world.
“Base seven with no addition. Okay, and then we can use an iron basin for electric current transfer. The formula is going to require californium, though.”
“Now boys, don’t be getting into arguments so soon. I’m sure James will make lots of new friends here in Hufflepuff, right?” Tonks chided.
as the newest member of such a sought-after family, you will need to be as wise as any serpent when word of your existence reaches the world.”
Draco paused and looked at Blaise, annoyed. He’d hoped to get into his room without delay, as this newest section of the scroll would clear up a mystery from the last.
“Heirloom, Magic, Blood.” Weasley whispered in awe, sounding a bit sick. “Harry, you don’t think Malfoy knows about the Sword of-”
making such promises, and had access to a state-of-the-art hybrid magical artifacts laboratory, the following dialogue was able to be overheard.
But always, the sacrifice. Whether to the werewolf’s bite, because the creature had a more cherished piece as a friend, or to the burden of guilt, because the prophecy could only come to pass if it’s other subject knew enough to set it in motion.
, and they won’t tell me where they’re putting some of my favorite pieces!” Narcissa Malfoy swept into the floo atrium where Draco and Severus Snape had just arrived.
“And whether the Other issss a threat to the one called Ssssscorpiussss.” The Critic said, eyeing Tom sharply.
“I’ve told you about running in the halls, it’s not dignified. As a representative of a powerful and ancient family,
Draco walked over to the seat he’d chosen to observe the golden boy meet his fate and sat down with a self-satisfied sigh.
The sweater did in fact have a warming charm, along with several others, including protection charms, luck charms, cheering charms, and…well, of
The entire Gryffindor team and two thirds of the crowd spilled towards Potter like a wild mob, but Draco beat them to him.
“Hmm. Interesting. Yes, I suppose that would do that, he seems a bit panicky, which the sopohorus would dampen a bit. Excellent work Mr. Malfoy. Ten points to Slytherin.”
“Pretty well, I’d say. After he gave me the note for you, he had a muggle friend already waiting on him, a promising physicist out of MIT, and they seemed as thick as thieves. I think he was genuinely enjoying his company!”
Draco ran his fingers up Potter’s long, strong legs, then leaned forward to kiss him on the inside of his left thigh, just above the knee.
Harry looked back at the scepter, touching it lightly like a truly precious thing, and then looking up at Draco again.
And Draco was suddenly on the ground, gasping, feeling his magic draining as Potter let out only the smallest groan of pain, the majority of the curse deflected.
“I…I forgot…where…oh Merlin, I’m naked in the Great Hall!” Harry’s face was crimson with embarrassment.
“Now, let’s see about getting wands for these fine young wizards as well, shall we? Now, I must ask you both a question of great importance, what are your favorite foods?”
Composed, Draco took Harry’s hand again and led him along the avenue of candlesticks and rose petals back to the wide open space near where they’d eaten. He walked him to the edge of the table and the two stood staring down at the floor far, far below for a moment.
“Dumbledore can’t use it. It is a family heirloom, it can only be used by the family that owns it.” Draco said curtly.
Nodding to himself, Draco placed the vial securely in the rack at the back of his desk and unfurled the scroll.
“I…I see.” Ollivander examined the boy carefully. “You don’t look a day older than when I first met you.”
“Silence, children! You’ll all have time to talk amongst yourselves once the feast has started. But first we need to welcome our new first years to Hogwarts…let the Sorting begin! Black, Regulus Potter-Malfoy, please come up to be sorted!”
His Slytherins were in the dungeons. There was no way he could get past them to his toiletry set without being seen with blonde
But to deflect the Killing Curse…no wizard had accomplished anything remotely like that. Ever. There was no shield, no protection, no magic that could prevent it from striking its target and ripping out their soul.
Draco paused, feeling a horrid lump in his throat. He knew he was about to hurt the Gryffindor horribly and somehow the idea made him horribly sick inside.
“No they won’t, the Healer said Papa fainted when the baby was born and will need his rest, and Daddy looked really tired too.”
“If you’re not dedicated, there’s really no point in being a prefect.” Granger lectured haughtily. “There are responsibilities and if you’re not going to take this seriously I don’t want--”
Potter was more afraid of losing, or perhaps killing, everyone around him, than he was of the Dark Lord. How odd.
The gaudy Gryffindor colors had been muted down quite nicely. A very tasteful deep wine-colored vest was visible under his black formal robes. Draco decided to ignore the way the color accentuated the flush in Potter’s cheeks for now. Also, a discreet flash of gold jewelry at the neck…an elegant-looking lion pin.
“All the pretty little kiddies and the yummiest one has to be soooo hard-to-get.” He licked his lips lasciviously.
“Draco, my boy. How can I help you?” The headmaster asked, looking straight at Lucius as he came in.
“Do you think that would help? Perhaps taking a few of Granger’s classes would teach you some new instincts.” Draco countered.
Draco turned to the gold etchings, carefully wrapping them in silk coverings before placing them together into a protective box. After shrinking the box he placed it in his pocket and headed out of his room.
“Remember, being powerless makes you contemptible, which is disgraceful. That is why every visionary who has been armed has been victorious, and each one who was unarmed was killed. It is much more secure to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. But to inspire fear, if you must injure someone, be sure it is severe enough that you need not fear vengeance. So either treat men generously or destroy them.”
Dumbledore looked at him disbelievingly. Draco felt the subtle tapping of the man’s mind against his Occlumency shields.
“Yes. He…you should know that in the past, he was Voldemort’s second-in-command. I suggest you be extremely wary of him. I…do not know how he would reactu to this bit of knowledge.”
The most dreadful revenge Ron could possibly wreak on his mother would be, simply, growing up before she was quite ready for it.
And that was apparently the extent of mushiness the twins would tolerate without comment, and their chorused “awwwww” made Harry burst out into teary laughter.
“Benedict. Yes, and a few others two, I’ve seen what I’m sure are some converted Muggle artifacts as well.” Murdoch said. “Yes Lord Malfoy, we can make some discreet inquiries. From what I know of the Muggle world, their traditions seem to be divorced from their technicalities, it’s likely the answers can only be found by questioning actual Muggles.”
“Of course, of course. Quite.” Dumbledore agreed, and drawing his wand, passed it several times over Tom’s head, muttering under his breath. The others could hear a few words of these apparently invisible scrying spells, but they sounded suspiciously like ‘fiddlement’ and ‘oddment’ and ‘tweak’.
There was now an unmistakeable growling of constant thunder coming from the cauldron. Draco dragged himself wearily to his feet. The inside of the cauldron was a constant staccato of flashes as chain lightning bounced between the walls of the cauldron.
“Headmaster, I know you’re thinking he’s just a boy, but this is also a Malfoy we’re talkin’ about, don’t forget! He’s as snakey as they come, that one, and now he’s caught out we can’t be letting him slip-slide his way out of it!” Auror Moody added.
“Yeah, that’s the point. They all come in, all quiet, like ninjas with their big, hard pillows tucked under their long, hairy arms.”
“Well met, Orpheus. And, I don’t mind, Nott here had a question and I am as willing to give the answer to you as to him. Do you have a question for me? Beyond how to spare us all the sight of your cruder pastimes?”
When they arrived at Dumbledore’s office Lucius moved off under a disillusionment charm as Draco interrogated Jamie, who’d been staking out the office entrance most of the day.
Draco was suddenly drenched with freezing cold water, suddenly dampening the dangerous cycle of sex-magic they’d been caught up in.
“Well, the artifacts in question were all actually themselves stolen, and I intend to return them to their proper owners.”
“Well…I know you’re really big on pure blood, Malfoy. But I don’t agree with that. Blood isn’t that important you know.”
Lysander shook his hand enthusiastically. “Hey, I’ve heard of you, our parents know each other! You have a twin too, right?”
Jamie just looked at him for a minute, then snuck a peak at Draco. Draco kept his face expressionless. She’d have to learn how to handle awkward emotional Gryffindors in her own unique way.
Draco fished through his bag and came out with the “Chemistry for Dummies” book, holding it so Granger could see it.
“Despite our history, it’s nothing personal, you understand. But the two of you are distractions that Potter and I simply don’t need at such a crucial time.” Draco observed quietly as he walked over to inspect them.
“Tom is going to have a lot of money, Draco. And I’m concerned about an additional motive to sweeten the pot by killing off his brothers. Draco, I know Blaise is your friend, and Cloud seems like a sweet kid now, but I
Draco gaped. What the hell was wrong with the boy, surely even the Gryffindor wouldn’t be so stupidly defiant if he really thought Draco a Death Eater.
“Was he?” Draco asked sharply, pleased. Perhaps the spy was beginning to see reason and would open negotiations.
“No not really. It’s magically animated. You can do anything with magic, Jamie. You just have to learn how to use it.”
Draco made his way to his room and found the regal eagle owl waiting for him. He sighed as he retrieved the black envelope from its sharp claws.
“And this is Scorpius Hyperion Potter-Malfoy!” he said the name with some relish, lifting the blanket so that she could admire the white-blond hair and the Lily-Potter-green eyes.
“That’s all very well and good if you’re Albus Dumbledore, or the sodding Boy-Who-Lived, Potter. He already wants you dead. Surely you’re not going to advise a
Regulus rolled his eyes. As if he’d even want someone other than James at his back during any kind of adventure. Like he’d trust any of these dorks to guard his back. They probably couldn’t even talk to snakes like his brother could.
Tom looked the other boy square in the eye. The duel would be easy, of course, this was no warrior before him. But, there was an iron in Heroditus’s eye, a solidness there that Tom knew would make him a truly worthy confidant, once his honor had ensured the kind of loyalty Tom could truly trust. He looked from him to Orpheus, feeling pleased with himself. Both were works in progress, but they each would have talents and potential that would be a pleasure to unlock and exploit, building them into the kinds of deeply loyal allies Draco had informed him must be his first priority in Slytherin.
“Well it was because we were both heirs of Slytherin. Draco said the curse he used meant he could use my soul to protect himself, somehow.
Draco rolled his eyes. The idiots were still confusing the legitimate rationale of blood-politics with the ignorant group-politics spouted by the half-blood Dark Lord many of their parents followed.
“It’s…I gave it to ‘Mione so she and Ron could sneak me food in the hospital wing in the middle of the night.” Harry said confusedly.
They all ignored the fact that the Mudblood’s grades were actually better than Draco’s. It was only due to the teacher’s prejudice against Slytherins, anyways.
Harry gave a little growl of his own in return, and twisted around to face him, pushing Draco’s back against the wall as he straddled him, chest to chest.
He was sure the Malfoy family could survive such a persecution, they had before. But…three generations holed away underground would mean inbreeding and dissociation from the Wizarding world – resulting in genetic weaknesses and a complete loss of political power.
Draco looked over at the Gryffindor table, a twinge of regret sliding through him as he saw Harry’s hunted expression as he read the article. Harry hated the attention of the Wizarding World on him, especially on his personal life, and now he had it in droves. And Draco had done that to him.
“Potter has both his blood-father’s Gryffindor heritage, and his soul-father’s Slytherin heritage battling inside him. The first has been encouraged and wheedled out of him by Dumbledore, yet he retains a strong inner darkness despite all attempts to stifle it. You will recall that he was seduced by the desire to torture my mother’s sister, Bellatrix, with the Cruciatus curse.”
Draco watched a scene play itself out, himself in all his splendor, sneering and saying something witty to Potter and his friends, Granger’s lips thinning in displeasure, Weasley’s face turning purple and Potter standing there, fists clenched at his sides, hair standing on end…odd…how did Draco never notice that Potter generated energy when he was angry before?
“So, as I was saying, all those in favor of Proposition four-hundred-twenty-six raise your wand, please.” Granger continued.
“We already did a contract.” Potter said sourly, no doubt remembering Draco’s underhanded use of Placito Perago in the school halls.
he would have seen some hint if Potter were interested in either of them. As far as he could see, Potter was as exasperated with their failure to express their mutual attraction as the rest of the school was annoyed by it.
“RETURN THIS PARCEL TO ITS RIGHTFUL LORD IMMEDIATELY, YOU DESPICABLE THIEF! HOW DARE YOU TAMPER WITH MATTERS ABOVE YOUR STATION!”
“Yeah I guess. He’s kind of a thug. Him and Regulus both. I’ve chased them out of Scorpius’ room about a hundred times when they’ve pulled some stupid prank.”
“You’re right. I’ll ring Parvati tonight and see if she has any advice. Maybe we should have encouraged them to be more independent, growing up…”
“No. I did that, with our bonding ritual. It…erased what he said to you, and everything after that.”
“I apologize, young Mr. Malfoy. But I have the feeling you are not being entirely forthcoming with me.”
Harry lowered his face to rake his teeth over Draco’s exposed throat, humming something guttural from deep in his chest before his teeth worked their way up to chew on his ear.
Draco wondered if the chart of Potter’s weaknesses would be an exact replica of the one of his strengths?
“I want you to. I…I never thought you could love me, this is all so impossible I feel like I’m in a dream…” Harry whispered quietly.
“IMPOSTER! UPSTART! SCANDALOUS LITTLE PRYING BUSYBODY! INSIGNIFICANT, SIXTH-BORN PAUPER CHILD!” The pompous bellow reverberated throughout the hall as Weasley snatched his shocked hand away.
Draco drew in a sharp breath, and Harry stopped, apparently realizing what he’d said…Draco waited until Harry was breathing quick, panicked breaths.
Tom growled at the mockery and lunged at him. Cloud nimbly dodged and Tom was forced to chase his cackling friend out of the common room and down the passageways of Hogwarts.
“You should know more about your own turtle. Turtles don’t move much because their shells are so heavy. They can only move short distances, and very slowly. If you like I could lend you a book about turtles, Frankie.”
“Hmmm.” The old man hummed, his eyes twinkling merrily as he replaced his wand in the depths of his robes.
“No, no. I don’t mean your silly adolescent lusts, Dragon. You’ve always wanted him, haven’t you? It was never about Quidditch! Your fascination with Quidditch has always revolved around the Gryffindor seeker!”
“Thomas, and Zabini I believe?” Draco stepped forward offering his hand palm up, fingers spread to display no hostile magical devices.
“Is there a reason you’re running around with your robes hanging sideways like a Hufflepuff in heat?” Draco asked acidly.
Only to leap backwards in alarm as Draco launched himself at the beast, managing to snag a handful of fur and dragging the animal backwards.
Draco’s mind raced frantically back to that night. Harry entered the Dark Lord’s mind when he was angry or very pleased. He was only annoyed, not truly angered, when Lucius had barged in. And he’d seemed bored even when Draco had asserted control over the Malfoy lands…
Harry came flying backwards and landed on Draco, knocking them both back into the alcove he’d placed himself in front of. Draco immediately buried his nose into Harry’s neck and took a deep whiff of that delicious “aftershave” potion he’d become addicted to lately.
“That’s beside the point.” Granger said dismissively, “Harry has just as much right to remember Sirius as his daughter. She never even knew him, it’s not like she missed him!”
“Harry, we have to stop!” Draco hissed just as Harry started to push onward, and suddenly they were both freezing cold as the anti-penetration spell Draco had taken to placing on himself every morning activated.
Clearly, it would be something designed to make him fat. Possibly chocolates. Draco cursed as his mouth watered at the idea of fudge made by Molly Weasley. The woman was a menace.
“Ok, you take Lysander and… you can have Edgar, too.” James offered generously. “We’ll fortify my bed and Frankie’s so we’re nearby if things go wrong. Deal?”
Draco hadn't noticed the one-legged, one-eyed old Auror until now. He shivered, remembering the polyjuiced Crouch back in fourth year.
“He got himself killed saving Harry Potter, then Potter took over all his money. That’s why I’m poor. I don’t want to be in Gryffindor.” Jamie explained. “Can I go now?”
And probably, maybe, try to repair a few bridges with Potter in the meantime. He could always burn them again later, if necessary.
Two exhausting hours later, the identical wands were lying next to each other on a long bowl with a flat silver mirror in the bottom.
“Now you’ve done it, ‘Mione. Don’t you think Harry misses his parents? He knows exactly what she’s missing.” Weasley growled, throwing down his own fork. “I’m going after him.”
His housemates were a bunch of unimaginative, brash idiots who thought a prank consisted of icing the stairs or putting a Toe-Twisting-Tenticle in somebody’s slippers while they slept.
“Wait.” Granger put a hand on his arm. “You’re right. That was the wrong thing to say. But Sirius was the closest thing to a family Harry’s ever had. It’s not right to make him give that up, even if it’s selfish. I won’t let you influence him when he’s like this.”
“Granger is free to help out if she wants to reduce their workload. Though I expect the elves themselves will be upset by the invasion of their turf. Still, she’s
“Then there’s just the bit identifying the families and asking for an alliance by marriage, and the last bit is a hint to why they chose that particular heirloom. ‘Burdens lifted will rejuvenate the lifter.’ Hmmm, I wonder what it is.”
In a moment another, much larger goblin was before him, introducing it with some foolish name that sounded just like all the other goblin names.
Inside, a very panicked, very young Tom Riddle stood feeding their son from a bottle while arguing furiously with James’ Runespoor.
“On our honeymoon, I’ll take you to a small villa I know in Greece. We’ll wed in a beautiful tiny chapel with white flowers everywhere. Get on our knees in our best robes and pledge our lives to each other.”
Kreacher had settled down since, tolerating the rest of the family as long as he was permitted to follow Regulus around worshipfully.
The two of them sat tensely, waiting for Madame Pomfrey to return with their potions. Potter had a large handkerchief clamped around his nose with one hand, covering most of his face. What Draco could see was bruised up. Pomfrey had said Draco had three bruised ribs and one of his knuckle joints had dislocated with that first punch.
Harry just gave him a look as if his hair was out of place…which…actually, it might be considering he’d been in the hospital for Merlin knows how long. He’d inconspicuously checked his appearance several times in the reflection of his husband’s eyes while they had been dueling as a team, and again in the reflection of the silver blade he’d used for the bonding ritual just before he’d started it, and again (using the shiny back of Slytherin’s locket) right before beginning the
agreeing to let bygones be bygones was less important than angering the terrifying woman. In this matter, he and Arthur were victims at the hands of a mutual enemy, of sorts, which could only be positive for their negotiations between themselves, of course.
At the very least, the tactical landscape was starting to look much more favorable to the Light than it ever had. Draco frowned. Thanks to his father, and for that matter, the last several Malfoys, the family was pretty firmly entrenched as Dark. What if that turned out to be the wrong side?
“Make him promise to never cast an Unforgivable Curse again.” Draco said, not looking away from his husband’s face.
With that decision made, the boy carefully climbed the narrow stairs that led up into the strange beast, his wand clutched carefully beneath the small squirming bundle.
asking for the Hundred-Year-Honeymoon variant to make sure he gets plenty of sex, I don’t see why Harry shouldn’t ask for the Death Pact variant to make sure he can really trust the ferret.”
“Good evening, Barrister Murdock, Barrister Seymour.” Draco greeted them, seating himself behind the forboding desk comfortably.
The more disturbing thought was that the idea did not seem nearly as horrible as Draco had previously believed. Or, so said the small voice in the back of Draco’s mind. Draco wasn’t disturbed at all, at this moment.
“Well the last one…he couldn’t undo the Langlock in time to avoid the Petrificus, and then he was vulnerable to the bodybind.” Potter said.
Lucius gave her a grim look, then pointedly cast his eyes at his own forearm, meeting her eyes once again.
Lucius nodded. Draco had promised Harry he wouldn’t take personal revenge on the Dursleys, but had let that bit of family history slip to Lucius, who had taken it upon himself to arrange a subtle spell that would slowly unwind the cherished normality of the Muggles’ lives over a period of decades until they found themselves even more entangled in strangeness and oddity than the ‘freak’ they had harbored.
“You’ll do what, young man?” Madame Pomfrey glided into the room, casting diagnostic charms at Draco as she moved.
“Now, my boy. I think as the informed neutral party here I can tell you that, circumstances as they are, the Ministry can make your life difficult for quite some time if it chooses.” Dumbledore said soothingly, then turned to Shacklebolt. “And I’m also sure that this can all be explained satisfactorily and with a minimum of inconvenience for all parties if we cooperate together.”
Draco cocked his head. Placitum Perago was considered the less extreme type of magical contract. Instead of killing the one who broke his promise, it mainly just caused the original terms of the agreement to occur magically, at the breaching party’s expense. In this case, the timing of the promise could be important, however.
“Would we should take a look at it? Perhaps we could find some answers right now.” she motioned towards his arm, curiousity alive in her eyes.
“I’ve warded a little corner of Hufflepuff Heaven for myself and am resisting the urge to go check on the twins.”
“Fine. Yes. But if he’s making friends with a Muggle then, he’s found a way to change how he thinks. I just want him to learn how to live in the world again and be a part of it.”
“It sounds like we’re in all Muggle places for our honeymoon. So, we can be as anonymous as we want. How does that sound?”
“I’ve a contract, magically self-enforcing as an Unbreakable Vow. You won’t tell anyone else, or use the information in any way without informing me first and gaining my approval.”
“Don’t try that lower lip nonsense with me, young lady. Your father attempted the very same trick and he got blasted right off the family tree!”
“Indeed. Now if you could excuse me, I’d promised my fiancé I would greet him and his family for breakfast.”
“Fine then. Let me know what you decide about the research project, Granger.” He said coldly, sweeping towards the door.
“The Dark Lord told me of your plans. Do you truly intend to bluff Potter into marriage with your life?”
Draco shook his head. Weird, having another’s thoughts in his head, especially when they related to his worst enemy in such a fond fashion.
Draco snuck a glimpse over at the Gryffindors. Harry Potter was white as a sheet, staring at Jamie as if he’d seen a ghost. Draco gave a private smirk. If things went as he hoped, Potter wouldn’t even meet her until after she was well-established as a Slytherin.
The thunder grew louder, rhythmic, powerful. He dashed for the pillar, putting his back to it, knowing the other person was just on the other side. He made his decision.
Potter was furious, it hadn’t taken him long to notice Draco sniggering whenever Potter would swerve away from his search pattern to call out a warning to one of his fiery-haired friends.
Draco turned back to his trunk and, with a careful application of wand and magic, disarmed the various traps and opened it.
“Not exactly the same. But I will not oppose your use of the Island Sanctuary while you have need of it, provided your servants treat the building and grounds with the respect they are worthy of. And that any family heirlooms remain unmolested.”
“My father has seen his grave. Just an ordinary muggle who got caught by a lonely witch’s Amortentia brew.”
he could best get to the boy…and now he just had to wait a few more minutes and the hero of the wizarding world would be, quite literally, in the palm of his hand.
“Oh, I didn’t mention your name, of course. Do you take me for a fool? They’d be all over the place, poking their noses in and generally interfering with my nefarious plot if they knew it concerned their heroic little benefactor.”
He shivered and vowed to make sure no one would ever be able take Scorpius away from him, or him from Scorpius. He had a thirst for knowledge, he knew. And his new parents had cautioned him that this could transform into a thirst for power as well. Well, there it was. And he wouldn’t hold back from making himself powerful. He’d just have to trust to his motives to keep him from turning into another Dark Lord.
“They’re going to spread out, in the dark, and they’ll each be standing by one of our beds, looming, like big, hairy vampire-ninjas in the dead of night, looking down on our sweet angelic faces quietly sleeping. Except for Frankie, because he’ll be snoring. So they’ll look down at our sweet angelic faces and Frankie’s loud snoring face, and the leader will give the signal.”
“Malfoy has survived many centuries of wizarding politics, wizarding intrigue, wizarding wars. This foolish rule you’ve invented for yourself, that everyone who you love will die because of you, holds a grain of truth. The Malfoy’s have a more accurate version. ‘Attachment breeds dependency, dependency spawns vulnerability, and the unguarded vulnerability will be the first target of your enemies.’”
Harry was babbling Parseltongue at the snake on Draco’s Slytherin crest, seeming hurt that it wasn’t answering him.
“Come, I’ve just got these delightful things in from the office. They’re a very rare Muggle device, used to create a very precisely sized spark of fire at a particular rhythm of intervals.” Arthur told him, drawing him towards the workbench.
The amount of emotion present in Potter’s statement, the pure fury and agony that he’d expressed at the thought of Draco belonging to the Dark Lord, was quite shocking towards such a distant relative. But Potter didn’t seem to feel that way towards Bellatrix, although it was quite significant that he’d been unable to Crucio her – even after witnessing her shocking murder of her cousin Sirius.
“Your father was Sirius Black. My mother’s name is Narcissa Black. They were cousins.” Draco told her.
Severus Snape bored into him with his eyes, finding the shield in place and giving up the Legilmency. His head tipped slowly in a nod of respect.
Draco noted, unsurprised, as the name Gryffindor started appearing well up in the Potter line, on up to the Founder himself. He’d already observed this on James Potter’s scroll. But he
“You bargain well. And you’re right, it was wandless magic, focused. Clearly not overtly intentional. I doubt the boy even knows what he’s capable of.” Severus observed.
Draco found himself smiling softly at the Gryffindor in an entirely unMalfoyish way, but couldn’t bring himself to care. It was just Harry, he wouldn’t tell anyone.
Severus frowned, watching his godson carefully. Draco’s face would be expressionless to most anyone, but Severus had watched this boy closely since he had been born. Something was skittering behind the corners of the boy’s eyes, something somewhere between panic and disbelief.
Tom looked at him carefully. He was well muscled and his hand was well-positioned to draw his wand at a moment’s notice.
“I asked Potter to meet me by Greenhouse Five. You should signal the others to begin the assault in about fifteen minutes.”
“I think I’d rather be held to my word more solidly, actually. It’s not an easy thing to restore a family name that means “bad faith”. Better to be seen to uphold my oath than to have the object appear out of thin air if I take too long.” Draco suggested.
Draco looked up and around himself. Harry was apparently still gathering his props for lessons tomorrow. He bent down and whispered to the infant.
Draco looked at her. The girl’s face was quite white, and she was carefully avoiding any sort of eye-contact with Potter.
“Well it’s pretty objectionable anyways!” Jamie retorted, kneeling next to him to get a better look at his hand.
“Mr. Weasley. I have targeted your children for vicious hexes, unkind jokes, and I have attempted to gain trouble for them at every turn. I have sneered at their clothes. I have made cruel comments at every opportunity regarding their lack of wealth, their number of siblings, their magical prowess. I have called your daughter a slut. I have taunted your son for being unworthy of his brothers and his friend Harry Potter. I have in every circumstance made known my assessment of your family as worthless and disgusting.”
“I see. I’ve…met him. When I was…younger. I understand your feelings entirely.” Lupin closed his eyes and shuddered slightly.
“No, no dear. Trust me, I know the Zabinis’ rules. They don’t kill off their first love, and they won’t take a childhood friend for the standard Zabini death-match. Pansy and Blaise divorced after they’d made Cloud because their marriage was based on friendship and convenience and once they had an heir they both had other things, and other people, to do.”
“I think I know you better after this. Maybe your muggle romance is pretty clever, in its own way. I…I’ll send you my first proposal tomorrow.”
didn’t get it. You can’t deny, Sirius Black was the type to A.K. a fly perched on his own nose, if he got mad enough.”
“I…I think I’d like to know about my father. But,” Jaime looked up and surveyed the Gryffindors, naked distrust written on her face. “maybe if…Draco could come too?”
“Um. I’m Harry Potter. Sirius was my…my godfather. I didn’t know he had a daughter.” The last came out in a whisper.
But what he found in the Black Library was a bit…well…farther into the realm of madness than what he’d find in the pristine splendor of the Malfoy collection.
hereditary. And you are the only other known Parcelmouth living. The Killing Curse involves a close wending of souls, which normally terminates upon the death of the recipient.” Draco told him.
“They’re everywhere!” Potter shouted as a Death Eater suddenly appeared behind them and tried shooting a bright red hex at them. Draco blocked the spell while Harry issued a fast Stupify at their attacker.
“Now we turn inverse to each other. Be wary of blocking each other, we should be close and slightly to the side. Put your hand on my waist and look over my shoulder as we turn.” Draco said breathlessly.
It didn’t budge, and Draco found himself hurling his shoulder into the heavy oak door, rocking it back against the wall and bouncing back. This time his tug produced results, the massive structure teetering on an edge and slowly…slowly, falling with a crash that shook the room.
It was yellow, with a non-moving picture of a man tinkering with some concoction in a glass beaker below a gaudy black banner bearing the title.
Draco leaned back then, carefully aligning Potter’s penis with his own entrance, hissing at the stretching and the burning as that most intimate of all possible contacts caused Potter’s magic to rush powerfully into his own core.
Scrimgeour officiated the second Oath Draco had participated in today. At this rate, he was going to have to get a secretary just to keep up with his lethally-binding commitments on a monthly basis.
So, the modern, politically correct Slytherin avoided laughter, and it’s variants, and typically conducted their scheming and plotting behind the carefully dignified veneer of “brooding”.
. You’re blood-heir to the Gaunt line, such as it is. And much more importantly, you are the heir of Slytherin.”
“How did you do this to me?” Harry asked, waving a hand at himself to indicate his current condition. “I mean…I had my cloak on.”
All of this, he saw in the crafty glint of the Mudblood’s eyes as she briskly ushered Ron towards the Prefects bath.
Draco looked at the boy, trying to decide how much to tell him. He’d known Blaise for a long time, they’d been conspirators and allies, and before that, playmates. They understood each other well. The boy was the very embodiment of
“I…see. Well, as you know that contract was quite thorough. The only ways to break the contract are if Miss Parkinson is ineligible for the bond by reason of invirginity, conflicting Life Debt, or of course
“Not the Dark Lord.” Draco corrected. “He truly is vanquished. But, Harry, there’s something Dumbledore never told you about him. About his Horcruxes.”
“Hermione told me the transference only works if it’s fully voluntary. I won’t do it.” Potter said evenly.
He guided him carefully up the winding brick path, then stood behind his husband, placing his hands over his eyes.
“Very well Jamie. I take it my gift was well received? Did Harry decide to wear it?” Draco asked tensely.
“I’ll be giving you a book to read before our next lesson, I’ll expect you to choose five spells from it and be capable of casting them on a moments notice, without fail, at our next session.” Dumbledore said. “For now though, let’s start planning some spell-combinations making the best use of the hexes you already know. Each spell in the combination should insure that you’ll have time to cast the next.”
There was a very protesting noise from Weasley, which Granger promptly quashed with a hand over his mouth.
I can successfully court his contract, this union will be a powerful enhancement to Malfoys for generations to come.”
There was dead silence as the Notice-Me-Not charm Harry and Scorpius had been under melted away as all eyes were drawn to the shaggy-headed figure at the Head Table.
“Mrs. Weasley. This is…this should be an heirloom for your family, I couldn’t possibly take something like this from you. Please, give it to one of your sons!”
“Yes. Quite.” Draco took the brief pause to cut off her torrent of speech. Even if she was quite right. “Well, after looking through this book, which I understand is just barely an introduction to the subject for someone with no knowledge whatsoever, I’ve come to a decision. I think these muggle theories should be developed in a magical context. There should be a Magical Periodic Table, to start with, and a deeper analysis of the properties within each magical ingredient and how they interact.”
Draco rubbed his eyes, sure that he was seeing things, but the same little scene played itself out again.
The desk received several creative and violent spells, its magically-enriched wood absorbing their power until eventually a simple severing curse broke it cleanly down the middle, the two sides falling away from each other like a newly split cordwood.
“I think we’re hexing at shadows without more information.” Draco spoke quietly, but his voice carried all the authority of his position in Slytherin.
as well, and that our current behavior is an excellent way of getting over the embarrassment…and perhaps learn from our example!”
“Hmm? Oh! The boy. Well, I suppose he’s about as normal as you or me, near as I can tell.” Dumbledore said. “Lemon drop, anyone?”
Heroditous Nott was a rather unfortunately skinny boy with stringy, brown hair. A bit unkempt, but the House of Nott had fallen upon hard times after the war.
“With that said, I’m afraid I can give you no more details until the non-disclosures are signed. If you haven’t already done so, please join the queue here and sign the documents. These are
Muggles simply couldn’t be allowed to get away with torturing wizard children. New age of enlightenment or no.
The moon shone down benignly from a ceiling enchanted to show a starry night sky. In the center of the room, the bassinet was a gleaming white under the soft moonlight.
Draco looked at the symbols. What did he want to know about Albus Dumbledore? His magical protections were depressingly enormous, his special strengths were likely to be the same. His fears and desires…he boldly pressed his finger to the small picture of an upturned palm.
“The problem we have is, the closer we get to the truth, the better your story will hold up to any kind of magical investigation…but with a higher risk of someone guessing the truth. If you claim the Slytherin name, people will both want to verify your claim and be interested enough in your story to make guesses.”
“No, it’s not nearly that old. But for it to work inside the castle it has to be compatible with the castle’s magic.” Draco explained.
Harry shifted, and Draco pulled back so he could see his face. Harry was looking around them, at the giant candlesticks and then beyond them at the Great Hall.
“Look I…well…what I said before. I’ve hated waiting like this. Malfoys are very impatient people, you know.”
“But the idea wasn’t bad, though. So this summer, I found that the list of new first-years is available to the public. Zabini handled background checks, and we identified which ones could end up in more than one possible House.”
“It’s what all the secrecy was about. In fact, it’s been illegal to disclose to someone like you for centuries, I have no idea how Granger got authorization for this program, actually. It’s possibly the only universally enforced law in my world.” Lucius told him, holding the wand out for inspection.
Tom spun around and saw a striking boy with unusual coloring. His brilliant blue eyes and soft golden curls seemed out of place against his dusky skin. The two boys looked at each other for a long moment, sizing each other up. The boy held himself carefully, a lot like the way Draco did (and tried to make Tom and the twins do). His face was pleasant, and tipped to the side as he considered Tom.
Yes, he was clearly correct. A white, rectangular box. No doubt containing something dangerously tasty. Hopefully fudge.
“I don’t see how something like that could interact with childish admiration, the ingredients are in entirely different categories. It’s possible, but only with considerable machinations to convert between them. I don’t see how that could trigger it accidentally.”
“So, how are you going to convince me that it’ll be worth it to wait to have sex with you?” Harry asked, and Draco thanked a lifetime of training for the fact that he did
Cloud froze for a moment, his face going into that careful blank state Draco used sometimes as his mind came to grips with what he’d just heard.
Draco decided the negotiations wouldn’t be helped at all if he was the cause of domestic violence. He also felt that the impropriety of eating together
“Second, in the interests of inter-house relations and school unity, Hogwarts will for the first time field a united Quidditch team drawn from the four House teams – which will compete against other European schools.”
Another spin, and Draco took the lead again, putting them in that face-to-face position he preferred, spinning them around that way a few times until he got to feel the powerful roar of Potter’s magic traveling inches from his ear again.
