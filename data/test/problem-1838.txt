“For us,” Harry repeated, leaning over the booth and grabbing Draco’s collar before pulling him into a kiss.
Once Harry opened his flies, he paused. There were just so many ways this could go wrong. He wanted to make sure he didn’t take it too far; he didn’t even know what might be too far for Draco.
Malfoy nodded, his eyes crinkled in a smile, and Harry wondered when their scheming and common goal had turned into this. Had they actually become friends through this?
“Gin. These are way too tight,” he repeated, face flushing. Even when he’d been far younger, he’d never worn anything like this.
Draco lifted himself up, careful to not set himself off balance with his arms bound behind his head.
“I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I wasn’t myself, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Draco added, gently.
“We were all so worried—”
Malfoy looked at him for a long minute before asking, “How do you feel about skipping dinner in the Great Hall?”
Harry nodded, unsure if that was even his primary concern anymore. Maybe it would be easier if he were more obvious, really. There was something almost freeing about Draco’s reaction, him already having known. Almost validating, in its own way. That he was seen by someone. And accepted.
Draco took a deep breath and looked contemplative. “Most of them were either killed or arrested in the war, but there’s one person that you might want to start with, now that I think of it. Abner Astor. He’s never been in any kind of position of power himself, but he’s more of a… maybe… go-between? He has connections and was just always around whenever my father had meetings.
“Yeah, I’m not taking that bet,” Harry said with a laugh.
Instead, he once again found himself looking for one particular person.
“Right, okay,” Harry said, brain spinning at the implications. “Hey, Ron—be careful.”
“Really. But I’m holding you to not abandoning me the minute we walk in. Yes, I know I’m supposed to be a brave Gryffindor, but this is a big step for me.” Harry allowed himself a self-deprecating smile.
There was a long pause, and Harry rubbed his face and then adjusted his glasses before leaning back to look at his friends.
“Okay, if that’s what would make you feel better,” Harry said, reaching out and putting a hand on Draco’s arm. It took Draco’s full effort to not roll his eyes and he wondered how Harry had even managed to start a relationship given the man’s complete obliviousness to more subtle social cues. And even more obvious social cues, Draco knew, if he was honest with himself.
"Madam Pomfrey-"
he'd seen it before, nowhere good, but the Room of Requirement had made such a great bed and the covers were perfect, and the temperature was just right.
"Good evening, Draco." Dumbledore's voice was steady, if faint.
Draco nodded. "Harry got the recipe from Dobby just yesterday, here." He slid the paper over to Granger, who read over it.
"Potter…."
Har-Potter didn't come into the Great Hall for breakfast. Draco expected as much, he'd seen the way Potter had reacted, that would take a while to get over. Pansy was….oddly quiet though, and Blaise was outright shunning him. They didn't have any classes with the Gryffindors that day, but Potter didn't come in for
Yes, Draco was early. Yes, he'd been eager to meet Harry so he'd gone a little bit earlier. Yes, he was slightly miffed that Harry wasn't there yet. Still, the worried looks on Hermione and Ron's faces gave Draco pause. Whatever this was....it might be dangerous.
“Four-thirty!” Teddy exclaimed.
The waitress came and got their order. Without the menus as a distraction, they settled into an awkward silence. Draco simply raised an eyebrow at him, as if to say get on with it, and Harry remembered why he was there.
He opened the door and was hit by a blast of cold air, colder than was typical for London. Draco stood before him, wearing a thick wool coat, a pale green scarf wrapped around his neck.
Ron grimaced and nodded. “So what even happened then? Where were you?”
“Did you hear that?” Malfoy whispered, his breath tickling Harry’s ear. It was too dark to see the other man, but Harry could feel the heat radiating off his body, so close to his own.
Harry huffed a laugh and dug his heel in Draco’s thigh. Draco swatted his foot in retaliation.
Ron and Hermione were having a harshly whispered conversation off to his side; he couldn’t hear what they were saying but both sounded upset.
Harry flew off to take over from Fahima.
“Great, that sounds lovely.”
“We had a… falling out. It was primarily between his father and him. They didn’t see eye to eye on his future. We haven’t spoken in nearly fifteen years.” She took a breath and folded her handkerchief in her lap, focusing on the task.
Draco was currently leaning over one of Andromeda’s cookbooks, mouthing the words as he read the directions for the roast turkey. “There has to be a magic way to do this,” he finally said, picking up the book and looking at the back cover as if the answer would be there.
“I can meet pretty much any day before two in the afternoon.”
“Can we take this?” Mel asked.
After a particularly hard thrust, Draco goes rigid, a moan escaping his lips. He spills out his release, his hand stilling on Harry’s cock. It’s all Harry can do not to thrust into it. He might be allowed to beg and plead today, but Draco still controls his orgasm.
“They paid him and then paid him some more to keep quiet about the money. But since it wasn’t the first time I’d had an issue that had needed to be settled with the press, they decided I was too much of a liability.”
“No, I understand. I mean, we’ve come a long way since queer folks had to code messages to their lovers for fear of getting arrested by the Ministry, but there are still bigots and arseholes out there.”
Harry took a breath and ran his now long slender fingers up his pale thighs, ignoring his still throbbing cock in lieu of touching everywhere else.
At some point, it became clear to Draco that Harry had just assumed they were in a serious relationship, and Draco didn’t have the willpower to correct him. He’d considered it. Every time another backhanded comment about Draco appeared in an otherwise unrelated article about Harry, undermining the years of work Draco had done to become invisible, he thought about breaking the whole thing off, going back to anonymity and spending the rest of his evenings alone. But then Harry would look at him, his eyes sparkling with intensity and fire, and Draco would get pulled right back into the flame.
“Let me see,” she replied from the other side of the door. He’d at least been successful at maintaining a shred of dignity by forcing her to wait outside the changing rooms and not give him running commentary
Harry sat, returning a commiserating smile. It was likely going to take the whole department a month to catch up on the amount of paperwork a case like this generated. Normally, he would have cringed at the thought and immediately started looking for active cases to work on, but, at the moment, he couldn’t muster up the energy to care.
“Happy birthday!” Ginny yelled the minute he stepped over the threshold.
“Hello to you, too,” Harry said to Ron and Draco, cutting off yet another one of their never ending debates. When the two men had started to warm up to one another, Harry had expected they would make small talk over Quidditch, not argue the merits of Muggle conspiracy theories until they were blue in the face.
“Oh—” Harry looked back up at Draco and then back at his drink. “It’s—erm—really good?”
Draco nipped at his inner thigh. “Sensitive, isn’t it?” Draco leant back down and Harry felt his tongue, firmer this time, trace his rim. Harry threw his head back, body wound tight.
Teddy finally relented, sitting back on the bed and watching Draco intently.
Harry grabbed his wand and carefully walked to the door, feeling a bit dizzy from the residual spell damage and the combination of potions he was on. He seemed to only have a good couple hours between doses where he was lucid enough to think straight, something he found incredibly disconcerting every time he wound up at St Mungo’s with spell damage. He would have thought someone could have found a way to make the potions have fewer side effects. Then again, they were always getting on his case to rest, so maybe drowsiness wasn’t a side effect that they particularly wanted to fix.
"Hermione and Ron’s.” Harry leans up against their dresser, a smile spreading over his face. “For the whole night.”
Draco kissed his forehead again, more firmly this time. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“No, Harry. It was perfect.” Draco tried to gather his thoughts, his brain too fuzzy still to fully explain. “I can’t—it was perfect. I just, I don’t know—it was like this emotional release. It was—” Draco struggled to find the words before sighing. “I’m sorry, I can’t explain it right now, but I’m okay.”
Harry nodded, that familiar lump growing in his throat. He cleared his throat, trying to dislodge it. “I’m still scared that I’m going to disappoint them though. I worry about it all the time.”
Slowly and steadily, Harry continued to pull out all the way out to the tip of his cock before pressing in hard and firm. On a particularly rough thrust, Draco fell forward on his elbows with a moan.
“No one,” he replied a little too fast.
“We don’t know,” Mel replied with a sigh as she stood up and joined them. “We know there are shipments coming in. We know something is being delivered as well—they were using Floos for the majority of the transits, creating and removing connections as they needed… all off the books.”
“What on earth is that?” Draco asked.
“You need some help tomorrow?” Ron asked. “Hugo has a football game with his local Muggle friends, but I could swing by for a bit before and help you out.”
Harry’s gut twisted at the fallout that two of his closest friends were going to be dealing with for months to come. While Ron was safe from the worst of the scrutiny given that he led the team that brought down the operation, Hermione and her department were being hammered by the press. But Harry knew if anyone could weather this storm and come out stronger for it, it was Hermione. And if he knew her at all, both her department and Magical Creature rights would come out stronger in the end too.
The rope around his wrists was pulled down firmly, forcing his elbows back and his chest out as his back arched ever so slightly.
Harry nodded to Scott and a few others as they walked in. And once greetings were exchanged and everyone was settled, he got everything started.
The flush on Malfoy’s face grew, and he opened his mouth to speak, but Harry held up a hand.
Harry chuckles softly and continues kissing down his husband's lean body, biting at his sharp hips, sucking at the hollowed skin that curves towards his cock. He watches as Draco starts to squirm, his cock filling out under the sensations. Harry scoots back, tucking himself between Draco’s legs before dipping down and licking up the length of his cock, long and slender like the rest of him.
“Yes, Potter….” Draco said very slowly. He only used Harry’s last name these days when he was making fun of him. “Me and you, we’re the only ones here, so that must be why it’s showing us…” He gestured back at the mirror, his eyes sparkling with mirth.
Harry and Mel nodded and stepped through the magical screen into the interview room.
Draco sighed and joined him at the building, keeping a safe distance this time.
” He thinks he might babble “green” several more times between curses as he tilts his hips left and right trying to escape Draco’s hand. But it does no good, there’s no escape.
“Why did you quit? You were good—really good, actually. I was really surprised when I heard the news. I would have thought you had decades left of a career with them.”
“Yes, Erin?”
Harry does scramble this time, unable to stop himself, coming to a kneeling position at Draco’s feet. He looks down, forcing his eyes away from Draco’s cock.
“I think that can be arranged, love.”
“I’m taking off,” Mel said as she came around the doorway into the study. “We going to get started on this immediately?”
He crouched down to the boy, and whispered in his ear,
“So, we have no leads, no sign of any kind of magic that could kill or even mildly harm someone, no signs that he died of natural causes, and no signs of potions or even potion ingredients?” Harry looked at Scott again, hoping for any contradiction.
Draco nodded.
“The ones from the Manor?” Harry asked, his adrenaline picking up. That was all they had, their only leads.
“Fuck,” Harry said, looking at how many there were just from the stacks they’d gone through that day. There was no telling how many more there were.
Her eyebrows shot up. “Really?”
“Classes didn’t go better this week, I take it?” Malfoy asked.
*            *            *
“Except Minerva,” Harry added.
This time, when Harry ran a finger along Draco’s torso, he simply accepted the light touch. He reacted, he shivered, but he didn’t try to do anything with it. He had no expectations, no thought about what he wanted to come next.
*           *           *
“The cages—they stop all of the magic from all the creatures,” Adrastos said, pointing at a spot in the cage in front of them where the magic shimmered slightly. “It lets stuff in and out, like food when they could be bothered to give us some.”
“Potter, I’ve been rambling on for nearly an hour. Please stop me,” Malfoy said, eyes crinkling in a smile.
The pub came into view, sporting a large pride flag hung vertically in the window next to several band posters. Harry’s pulse jumped.
Harry moaned in agreement as Draco licked the bone of his ankle and started making his way back up his body, this time sticking to the inside of his leg, which was far more sensitive.
“Harry, no. I’m sorry you didn’t feel like you could come to us, to me,” Hermione said, getting up. She sat down next to him and pulled him into a hug. “You don’t have to tell us anything you aren’t comfortable with. Ever. Okay? You don’t owe us that. But I wish you’d known that you could.” Her voice sounded watery and Harry felt himself getting overwhelmed, a lump forming in his throat as he hugged her tightly.
Over the past day, Harry had started to recognise the embers of a growing crush, an obviously ill-advised crush as they’d only just begun to get along. Harry tried to remind himself that he was just feeling particularly sappy after watching the man take care of Teddy all week. And if his eyes sparkled when he laughed at Teddy’s excitement, it was likely just the fairy lights. And he was probably just feeling desperate, from the sad event his dating life had turned out to be. No need to jeopardise their newfound friendship with a passing fancy.
Harry and Malfoy both simultaneously took a large step back, while Neville gave it another tug.
“Oh god, please,” Harry cried out.
“Sure thing, say ‘hi’ to Jess for me,” Harry said.
“And this?” On the other shoulder, Harry traced a thinly-lined compass and then the swirling clouds around it.
“Yeah. She was one of the people arrested.”
“Jesus,” Harry said under his breath, as he imagined being forced into that life. Married to someone he didn’t even like, not able to be himself at all, playing a part. His stomach turned sour the more he thought about it. Was it really that different than how Harry lived now? His situation was self-imposed to be sure, but there was nothing genuine about the way Harry was living his life.
“She dated Foxley until this summer. What are the chances she suddenly joined the Neo-Death Eater cult out of the blue?”
A petite woman with short brown hair sat across the table from them. She didn’t look like she could hurt a fly, but Harry’d seen more than a few criminals that looked like upstanding members of society but did horrible things in life. Next to her sat Abe Montgomery, one of Harry’s least favourite lawyers. He tended to pick up the cases of the more terrible criminals that were arrested. More terrible and far richer, that was. Isabelle George must have some family money to have afforded him.
“Harry! Those are perfect.” She tugged him over to the mirror on the wall and turned him around, so his arse was facing the mirror.
“They went too high, Professor!” a girl cried out.
The warrant hadn’t come through until the end of the day, though, so Harry had spent the day throwing himself into other work: organising his notes and finishing up paperwork. It had made for a frustrating day, with Harry antsy to get moving on the search while also trying to stay busy enough to avoid thinking about Saturday night.
Draco sighs and then takes a deep breath before folding up his copy of the Daily Prophet. He vaguely remembers a time when he was able to read an entire article in one sitting without being interrupted every few minutes.
“With pygmy puffs?” Harry asked in confusion.
Eventually, Draco pushes a little harder, widening Harry even more. As Draco continues to work it in and out, Harry feels his cock attempting to stir back to life.
When Harry got to the staff room, he was relieved to find it empty. He just needed a few minutes to decompress before dealing with his colleagues.
At dusk, warrant tucked safely away in Harry’s robes, Harry and Mel apparated some distance away in the industrial park and slowly made their way to the warehouse. With only the two of them on the mission, Harry cast extra-strong protection spells on them both. Even after all these years, he still had some reckless tendencies, as Hermione had put it, although he was much better at assessing the danger of a situation for his partner. The idea of Mel getting hurt or worse was enough to sober him up and approach his field work carefully.
“There!” Neville lifted up the freshly potted plant and set it on a shelf to the side, putting his gloved hands on his hips and looking at them with a smile. “What are you two doing out here?”
“Sure thing,” she said, grabbing one from behind her on the counter and handing it to him.
Harry laughed and dropped a teasing kiss on Draco’s lips. “I thought there was ‘time for this later’ and that I was ‘too shaken up.’”
Draco pulled back, not wanting to wait another minute to try his new present. “Can we start now?” Draco asked, swinging a leg over Harry to straddle him before leaning over and pressing another kiss to his lips.
“So, that didn’t work.”
“Just answer the question, and then we’ll explain.” After nearly two decades as an Auror, Harry knew to not rely too heavily on instinct alone. No one was infallible. But he was sure enough that they were about to bear the news of his father’s death.
“Already? I thought you’d want more time to recover,” Draco says with a chuckle. “I suppose your third orgasm will probably still feel good.”
Just as he was about to sit down, there was a knock at his door, and then he heard it creak open. Harry made his way to the entryway of the sitting room to find Draco hanging up his coat and hat, before straightening out the cardigan he was wearing over a dark purple t-shirt. He leant toward the entry mirror and shook out his hair before starting to arrange it back into place.
“Oh, come on, you’re not even trying, Potter.” Mel laughed as she dodged another spell.
Harry grabbed Draco’s tea, setting both of the paper cups back on the bedside table before turning to him and pulling him into a soft kiss. “Not a deal-breaker. Absolutely not a deal-breaker,” Harry said, as he pulled back. “Magic is important to me, so is the community, but that doesn’t mean I need it in every part of my life.”
Harry nodded and took a long drink of his pint. It was pretty depressing, to have fought so hard just for new wizards and witches to pop up and try to restart the whole thing.
Harry laughed. “Bugger off. There’s nothing embarrassing.” That was probably true, at least.
He landed on his stoop a bit more unsteadily than normal, a bead of sweat dripping down his neck from the strain. He hoped his exertion hadn’t actually set his healing back, but there was nothing to be done about it now. So he grabbed the doorknob and pushed in.
were more likely to come to be, but he’d severely underestimated his friends.
“How was your trip?” Draco asked as he flicked his wand toward the turkey, starting the knives at carving off several pieces.
“Yes,” Harry replied slowly. “Exactly.”
“You alright?” Draco asked as he held another glass of water out to Harry, trading him for the empty one. “I really should have warned you not to take any drinks from Riley,” he added with a grimace. “They are an absolute menace with mixed drinks.”
He felt a tear spill over and quickly went to wipe it with his sleeve, clearing his throat. “No, it’s fine.”
“Go shower. I’ll keep the tea under a warming charm for when you’re done,” she said as she bounded down the stairs to the kitchen.
Harry nodded and yawned again. “Sorry for sleeping all day. I’m normally a much better host.”
“Green, sir,” Harry breathes out, closing his eyes and allowing himself to just float, enjoy the sensations, Draco’s hand in his hair, the stimulating vibrations in his arse.
Mel echoed a moment later.
Harry strode out with his game face to see two wizards talking just outside one of the offices. He vaguely recognised one of the men as Simon Crane, Sharon’s boss.
But as Harry lay there, emotionally devastated from a case, he wondered why he’d just assumed that was all his life could be. He wondered how many of his life choices had been about him at all, and how many had been about other people. About not letting people down, about living up to people’s expectations, about doing what was expected of him—even at the expense of his well-being. He’d gone into the Aurors and stuck with it even as it consumed his life. He’d kept his sexuality a secret for decades, unwilling to even consider disappointing the Weasleys, his friends, and the public. He’d kept up his public appearance, always striving to be the poster child for a respectable member of society and a perfect Auror, all so that he wouldn’t disappoint people who he’d never even met.
“Harry, m’boy! You made it.” Arthur clasped his hand on his shoulder as he walked by.
She pursed her lips and Harry could see her thinking it through.
Harry shifted in his seat. No one had ever asked him these questions before. He wasn’t sure he had ever even asked himself these questions. He’d had a fleeting thought here and there, and he certainly didn’t enjoy watching his friends and co-workers get injured and be in danger. He certainly didn’t enjoy being on bed rest from a murder attempt. In the end, the swirling thoughts became too much, and he simply shrugged.
“How are your other classes going?” Malfoy asked.
“It sounds like both of you actually managed to set some rules. Teddy didn’t seem particularly thrilled about it,” she continued, with a glint in her eye. Teddy huffed dramatically next to her. “But I’m glad to hear that my worries were unfounded.”
Harry and Mel continued to provide water for the other creatures; a few drank immediately, others continued to look at him with distrust. His gut twisted at the thought of the treatment they must have received to still be so scared.
“I’m telling you if the moon landing was faked that Muggles already had the technology at that time to make it look real enough,” Draco argued, barely noticing that Harry had joined them.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could do this. He’d take a step back and figure out where things went wrong with his classes and just plan better.
“I’ve no doubt. I saw Riley hand you at least two drinks.” Draco laughed and squeezed past the other man, who was still looking at Harry coldly, and headed to the sink.
Draco leaned forward, bracing himself on Harry’s shoulder, breathing heavy.
Draco glanced up when Harry sat down next to him; his face and eyes just a bit puffy. Not wanting to press, Harry let the silence settle over them, far off bird calls and the occasional rustling of leaves occasionally breaking the quiet.
“Pardon?” Harry asked.
“What are the chances we can get him to go to bed without a fuss tonight?” Harry asked.
“Ah yes, you’ll want to talk to Lila someday about microaggressions. She has a lot to say about the matter.” Draco quirked a small smile. “And it’s not nothing. It’s tiny little displays of bigotry that add up. Like the Muggle saying ‘death by a thousand paper cuts.’ Any one incident might not be a big deal, but then when they add up…”
Once Harry was fully hard, Draco pulled off and propped himself up on an elbow. Harry relaxed back into the pillows, watching as Draco uncapped the small bottle and poured a generous amount of lube over a couple of fingers.
Draco exhaled loudly. “I can’t believe he’d— I mean I can, but—” Draco turned on his back and looked up at the ceiling.
“That sounds great, what do you think?” Harry turned to Draco.
They still had a dead body and no leads.
Harry took a sip but continued to hold eye contact with Ewan, knowing it was absurd even as he did it. Draco wasn’t his. He was free to chat up anyone he wanted. But in Harry’s drunken state, he couldn’t quite tamp down the jealousy in the moment.
“Hey, you.”
“Yeah, absolutely. You think you might know where I can find something?”
Harry smiled as he observed the man carefully move the strands of his hair into some sort of order. After a few minutes of this, Harry cleared his throat.
Molly’s eyes lit up, and Harry wondered why he hadn’t started with that. If ever there was a woman that wanted to see the world paired off, it was her.
Harry has to think. “Two weeks, sir?” While most of their D/s relationship stays in the playroom and Draco’s office, orgasm control is one of the few things that Draco has requested to be 24/7. For Harry, that means no masturbating without permission and also that Draco controls when and if he gets to come. During busy weeks, that might mean he’s not coming at all.
“I heard you flew perfectly your first time, Professor Potter,” a Hufflepuff student next to them piped up, most unhelpfully. Harry couldn’t remember his name… something with an M? Matt? Mason?
“Stay put, put up a shield if anyone comes this way, and call through the Cogitatio if you need backup.” Harry waited for a nod of affirmation and then turned back to the fight. It was nearly over. Scott appeared to be assisting Clara in taking down an older grizzled-looking wizard, and Ron and Proudfoot were each duelling their own combatant. The others appeared to be tending to the injured, Hardy hovering over Savage with the healing supply bag.
“Well, today went better,” Draco said, handing Harry the last clean dish to put away.
“Oh, is it Margie? She’s still single right?” Percy asked.
Harry called out through the spell.
Harry skimmed the letter; there was nothing of importance in it. In fact, if he’d seen this on its own, it wouldn’t have necessarily even caught his attention given the sheer amount of random communications and letters they had to sift through. But it was addressed to L from CP.
Harry frowned as he looked down at his plate, forking a carrot. He’d never really thought about it before, but it was a little distressing that they were killed for ingredients, even if done humanely. He thought about their screaming faces from back in his Herbology days.
He held her tight, her short hair brushing up against the stubble on his chin. “Me too.”
“I’m gay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A very loud snore.
He closes his eyes. God, he loves this. He lets himself get lost in the feeling, the fullness, the pounding, the feeling of being taken for Draco’s enjoyment.
“A strong one at that. I’ve looked over the spell residue report, and Auror Potter, I’ll be frank. I don’t even know how you are alive. You and Auror Shaw had protection spells on, yes?”
Harry slowly extricated himself. Draco huffed and stretched out as more real estate became available. Even though the awkward position couldn’t have lent itself to a good night’s rest, he looked peaceful. Harry found himself staring for a minute too long and then shook his head slightly, reminding himself that staring at people while they were sleeping was creepy. As Draco stretched out fully, still asleep, Harry grabbed the afghan off the sofa back and covered him up. He might as well let him get a little more sleep.
Her lip quirked up, and she looked like she was biting back a reply.
“Or if I want to deny you until you beg me to come.”
“Nothing beyond that really. I remember before I left that my parents and most of pure-blood society had been losing their minds over the proposed changes to house-elves rights. To be honest, I didn’t really pay much attention beyond that they’d receive minimum wage.” Draco put some sugar and cream in Harry’s tea before handing it to him. “I was pretty preoccupied with the whole arranged marriage to a woman thing going on in my life.”
“I was just worried. When you didn’t respond, I thought…”
“Yeah, just for a few years there.”
“He seems really distractible.”
But even with a bit more success, Harry still found himself exhausted as he entered the staff room; he still had quite a bit of class prep left to do, as well.
“So good, Harry,” Draco murmurs in his ear as he leans up against Harry, clearly spent from his orgasm. Harry flexes his arms, bearing both their weights to keep them from collapsing forward on the desk. His vision goes fuzzy around the edges, arousal coursing through his veins.
“That can’t be a coincidence,” Harry said.
Harry leaned forward on his broom, flying to the other side of the group. The bird was running in circles just under a group of Slytherin students.
In a surprising act of openness and honesty, Malfoy had also explained during their walk to the village that no amount of apologizing could possibly repair what he’d done to Madame Rosmerta. So, out of respect, he kept clear of the Three Broomsticks. So far they’d stayed far away from the topic of the war. Harry knew if their friendship were to continue, it would likely need to be addressed eventually, but at the moment he found himself in no rush to get there. He’d seen enough proof of Malfoy’s character from the past few weeks to wait for that conversation. Instead he sat back and let himself enjoy the moment, listening to Malfoy tell story after story with a light in his eyes and a smile playing at his lips.
Harry knelt down next to the camp bed, arranging the books and papers so the rune was visible on each. Mel joined him on the floor, helping to sort the documents.
Draco spun to look at Harry, eyebrows raised, and then a laugh startled out of him. “I’ll have you know this is very different.”
a thing that happens.”
As he undresses and steps into the spray, his mind spins at what Draco might have in store for him, the options are nearly endless in the playroom. Whatever it is, though, Harry thinks as he lathers himself up, carefully cleaning every inch of his body, it’s likely to be a very good day for both of them.
Harry grabbed the drink with a laugh. “Thanks for that.”
“On top of that,” Ron continued. “We’ve got some files missing.”
Draco pulled off his own shirt, and Harry shifted off his lap so Draco could pull off his trousers and pants. They scooted down in bed until they were laying down, facing each other.
“The outfit! I’ll wear the outfit!”
“Draco, wait!” Harry reached out and grabbed his hand before he was out of reach.
Draco switched off the light and crawled into bed. The bed dipped, and Harry scooted back, trying to give him enough space. Dim light filled the room through the curtains, and Harry could just make out the other man’s features. Harry forced himself to close his eyes, even though he suddenly felt wide awake, the tension in the air too thick to ignore. Draco was too quiet, too still.
Draco narrowed his eyes briefly in Justin’s direction. “Harry, I’d really feel better if you stayed with me.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair and looked like he was biting back whatever he wanted to say. That was fine by Harry; he didn’t want to hear it at the moment.
Harry works to stand gracefully and not scramble up, trying to not further embarrassing himself with impatience. Draco’s eyes are still bright with mirth, but Harry knows that’s not going to last much longer. Once they get started in earnest, Draco will be all business. And there’s not much that Harry finds hotter than that.
Harry laughs softly. “Absolutely. Whatever you say, dear.” He lets himself relax and sleep pull him in, basking in the absolute boneless relaxation that only comes from a great orgasm. Maybe they’ll even get a few more minutes in the morning before Ron and Hermione drop the kids back off. And maybe, they’ll actually be able to finish again. It could happen.
“Flynn,” the student replied.
As he neared the Ministry entrance, he pushed it down: the worry, the envy, the fears. He was good at that by now. He’d throw himself into the case, focus on the puzzle and mystery of it all and leave no space for his personal issues. He had plenty to focus on with this case anyway.
She snatched it out of his hands, disappointment on her face to see his lock screen photo of Teddy and Harry at Teddy’s Hogwarts graduation.
Harry bit back a whimper as Draco lowered himself in front of him. He loved their relationship. He’d never want to be the one to have to come up with the plans, to have to stay in the moment and run the scenes. He loved getting lost and floaty; he loved serving and being used. In short, he’d never want to Dom. But, he’d also be lying if he wasn’t looking forward to this reversal. He had a feeling he’d be offering more bets in the future, too.
“Is it weird—” Ron started to say, before pausing to send off another offensive spell. “—that I miss this?”
“Flynn, go get Hagrid,” Harry said. As soon as the student turned to go, another loud pop sounded behind him. Harry turned to see an empty space where the Diricawl had previously been. Apparently, the rules of wixen magic didn’t apply to this creature; it had apparated, or whatever magic it was doing, right out of the trap. Harry groaned.
She pulled back. “No matter what, I still expect you to come by for dinner with me and Jess once in a while.”
Ron grimaced. “I don’t know. I’d love to say it’s fine, but I sent Hermione and the kids to the Burrow—and called in a few favours for warding the place. It’s nearly as secure as any of the Order of the Phoenix hideouts at this point. And the place is never empty, so all we can do is hope for the best. Plus, you know Hermione—she’s only become more dangerous over the years.”
“I’ve never been so sure of anything.” Harry threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair. The upcoming raid—the looming of
At least today, he was able to move around a little easier. The previous day, he could barely get himself to the bathroom. His face flushed at the memory of Draco, who had stopped by with soup as promised, helping him down the hall. Harry had been grateful for the company, bored as he was, but he hated anyone seeing him like that. And he hadn’t relished the look of concern and pity Harry had seen on his face either when Draco had realised the extent of his injuries.
“No, you don’t,” Mel said firmly. “We can handle the rest.”
After a moment, Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair. Apparently, Draco was not in the mood to give up today. “I wasn’t going to do anything—will not do anything. That would be inappropriate; it’s your body.”’
Harry found himself staring at the man, not for the first time in the past few days. Draco’s eyes were crinkled in the corners, pure joy written on his face. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever seen him so free and happy; he looked beautiful. Draco’s eyes flicked up to Harry’s and the laughter settled down. Harry could feel the tension in the air and wondered if it was possible that he wasn’t the only one whose feelings had been shaping into something new that week, something that could possibly be beyond friendship.
“We love you so much,” she said, releasing him but leaving a hand on his shoulder. “You shouldn’t ever need to wonder about that.”
Draco exhaled slowly. “Do you, I mean I know you’ve mentioned that you are still famous and all in wizarding England, but have you considered dating Muggles?”
“Harry, that’s fantastic. How did it go?”
“He said he’ll meet me at my house at eight.”
“Since around the time that he kicked me out of our home and family, actually.”
While Harry was more aware of the danger and mature enough to actually worry about it—mortality not seeming as abstract as it had in his youth—he was also a seasoned Auror. He knew how to push it all down and do the job. He cast an alarm spell with his wand for half past six in the morning and put it all away to the back of his mind.
“It had to have.”
“Beautiful.” Draco slowly walks around Harry, running a finger along the edges of the ice blue lace of his knickers.
for the conspiracy theory bonding idea for Draco and Ron.
Draco pulls himself up, sitting back on his haunches on the end of the bed, staring at his husband in disbelief. Draco bristles in indignation, his ego struggling between satisfaction that he’d helped Harry relax so thoroughly and absolute offence that Harry would fall asleep with Draco’s tongue in his arse.
Harry hadn’t seen Ron this angry in a long time, but he understood. A low simmering rage crawled under Harry’s skin at the knowledge that people he trusted, people that held the lives and safety of people he cared about in his department in their hands were involved in this. All frustration with his job and this case Harry had been feeling were gone—replaced by a single-minded need to bring these bastards down.
“I know, but he has a lot of connections here. He’s a high-profile wizard with a lot of Ministry ties. The
“Agreed,” Ron said, pressing his lips together. “Let’s see what else she knows, but we might finally have a lead. If they are somehow involved in the potions ring, we’ll need to combine teams on this, start comparing notes.”
Harry shook his head.
—too much—” he cries out.
“Friend,” Harry mumbled into the pillow that his face was half-smashed into. “Good friend.”
Mind made up, he got up and made his way downstairs. It would be just a quick trip to his office, that was all. Harry put on his shoes and then grabbed his things: his wallet, the moleskin pouch in which he still kept emergency supplies, and his phone and headed to the Floo.
“Well, you seem to think that I stole your yoghurt!” Malfoy crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes.
“He invited you to his friend’s birthday just as a friend?” she asked.
.” Harry sent a ball of light off to the far end of the room, and then repeated the spell several times illuminating the large warehouse in bright light.
“Harry,” Hermione said softly. “How long have you been keeping this to yourself?”
“Is it such a problem that we’re friends?” Harry asked, a bit defensively.
Six hours. It had been six hours since their morning Auror raid. Six uncomfortable, awkward, surreal hours.
Harry nodded and pulled out his wand, “So I would just need to say show me my inheritance?”
Draco continues running his hands up and down Harry’s overly sensitive skin. He makes his way around the ropes, dragging his fingers across the hollow of Harry’s armpit. Harry jerks to the side, but he’s too exhausted, too wrung out to put up much of a fight as Draco continues with his maddeningly light touches.
After a moment of incredulity, Draco finally sighs. He knows Harry’s been tired lately. So, Draco climbs off the bed, careful not to rouse him and grabs an afghan from their side chair. He covers him up and drops a soft kiss on his messy hair. Draco has no idea if Harry just needs a nap or if he’s tired enough to sleep straight through the night. There’s always the morning, he supposes.
Harry slid into the fray next to Ron, sending off a Blasting Curse that was dodged by the wizard.
They pull off their shirts—Harry’s glasses flying somewhere in the process with a clatter—and then struggle to get out of their trousers, their feet getting tangled up in their haste. But eventually, they manage to get fully naked and stretch out on the sofa, and Draco kisses his way down Harry’s torso.
Harry felt his face growing hot. “Well, then where is it going?”
“Are you looking for advice?” Harry asked carefully.
His husband’s eyes crinkled in a smile. “I found someone who would teach me shibari. Happy birthday, love.”
Harry glanced at his reflection in a window as they walked past and grimaced. His hair was a mess; his tan coat washed out his light brown complexion, making him look a bit sickly. He really needed some new clothes. It was something Ginny had been teasing him about increasingly as of late—particularly when she’d had a few drinks and started badgering him about “getting out there and finding someone.” He glanced over at his partner. She fitted right in with her brown leather bomber jacket layered over a check shirt and jeans, her short light brown hair stylishly dishevelled.
Harry had been too hopped up on potions the previous day to give it much thought, but he couldn’t help but get stuck on the absolute surreal quality of this moment. Of being injured and on home recovery, being taken care of by Draco Malfoy. Draco, who had dropped everything to spend every hour outside of work with Harry for two days. And, as strange as it would have sounded to his sixteen-year-old self, there wasn’t a single person that Harry would rather have volunteered for the job. As terrible as this case was turning out, he was secretly grateful it had been dumped on him at that moment.
Teddy bit his lip. “Am I in trouble?” His eyes were wide and his bottom lip looked like it was going to start quivering.
He pulled back so he could look at her, wiping his face again and feeling a bit like an idiot, crying in the back garden.
Harry sighed and tossed them on his growing stack of notes and reports, including the equally as useless autopsy report from the Ministry. It had come back clean: no traces of spell work, trauma, or a natural cause of death.
Harry summoned what was left of his courage for the day as he felt a warm flush spread over his face. “It’s Draco Malfoy. We’ve only been together for about a week. He’s been living in Muggle London, and it’s all pretty new, but, erm—if he’s welcome, I’ll bring him soon.”
Harry added a few logs to the fireplace and lit them with his wand, the fire roaring to life immediately. He then waved his wand to put out the lights in the room, leaving only the glow from the hearth and the fairy lights from the Christmas tree in the corner of the room. They’d have to remember to get Teddy’s presents out once he fell asleep
“Harry, what the fuck,” Ron said, his face turning red. “What the
*            *            *
Draco flipped another card. A Jack. Shit.
“Sounds good. Now let’s go find George and Angelina so that I can kick your arse at Quidditch.” She knocked him on the shoulder as she walked to the door, a clear bounce in her step.
Draco lowered himself, keeping his tongue moving, and then pulled back several times before pushing deeper. Harry felt his cock hit the back of his mouth, felt Draco pushing past where his throat was trying to close. After a couple more slow attempts, Draco opened up and took Harry deep. Harry groaned loudly, forcing his hips to still until he was sure Draco was ready. Another slide back, another push, Draco swallowing around his cock, and then Harry felt a tap on his thigh.
Harry stretched his arms over his head, tilting his head side to side, neck cracking and realigning. Draco hadn’t come back. While Harry wanted to give him some space, it had now been nearly an hour. He put his letters and files of interest off to the side and left the room in search of him. Once on the ground floor, Harry did a cursory glance in some of the rooms, but he had a suspicion that Draco had headed outside. He checked the rooms on the way out, and then pushed through the large solid doors, casting a warming charm as the November air cut through his clothes. The deep grey of the sky did nothing to help the chill.
Draco massaged his arse cheeks before pulling Harry back just a bit. And then Harry felt pressure, his hole stretching, as Draco slowly pushed in.
So, he set his jaw and pulled open the door, hoping he’d be back sooner rather than later.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, his face flushing in anger. The fact that people he worked with daily could do that, attack him in his own house, try to kill him… It was one thing to think about Robards, Higgins and Perry taking out someone like Lucius Malfoy after he’d threatened to expose them, but to send someone after Mel and him… It was unconscionable.
“How did Lucius get killed, by the way?” That particular piece of information was still driving Harry crazy. Even if it was the Markupo, which made the most sense now that they knew one was in the country, he still couldn’t work out how they had got it into Malfoy Manor.
He turned off the taps and wiped his hands on Draco’s expensive trousers, only a little out of spite. He got a few lingering looks on the way back to their office— earlier that morning, once word had got out, they’d had a parade of Ministry workers who suddenly needed to walk very slowly by their office door.
Harry yawns. “What time is it?”
“Yes, sir,” Harry said in an exhale. Even though the air was warm, goose pimples were spreading up his legs.
Harry felt his hackles rising at the other man’s continued presence, and never being one to back down from a challenge, particularly a direct one, he turned to the other man. “Hi, I don’t believe we’ve met."
“Looks like we’ll have to reschedule this for another day,” Harry said to Higgins and Perry, before turning back to Mel. “Okay, let’s get cleaned up and talk to some of his co-workers.”
Just as Draco’s internal strop was reaching epic heights, the bedroom door opened. Harry entered, fully dressed in jeans and a nice t-shirt and carrying a fair-sized present. Draco pulled himself to a seated position and crossed his arms across his bare chest.
Harry ruffled his hair and smiled.
Harry groaned. “Oh my god, this is a terrible idea. Are you going to be able to hold it together in the shops?”
“Fuck,” Harry breaths out, running his hands down Draco’s back.
“Odel has a few meanings, but it’s primarily ancestry or inheritance. It’s been used by both Muggle and pure-bloods alike to signal supremacy, though,” she said, giving him a meaningful look.
Harry breaks out in a sweat, his cock softening in the process as Draco drags his wand over his body. He knows it’s not doing any damage, but that doesn’t stop the sting. It doesn’t change how the pain adds another dimension to the situation, confusing Harry’s senses, further sensitising his every nerve ending.
Harry refrains from rolling his eyes as if he’d forget their simple stoplight system after all this time, but he knows Draco is only being cautious. “Green is good, yellow, pause and check-in, red for stop.”
“What Ron means to say,” Hermione said loudly, “is that we’re here for you, and we want you to know that it doesn’t make any difference to us. And we’ll accept whoever you choose to date.” She gave a pointed look to her husband, who cleared his throat and nodded.
“But as your best mate, I’m glad. I want to see you happy.”
“Sure, okay.” Bradbourn crouched down and started going through the supplies, and Harry watched his shoulders release as he focused on the task.
“So, consider yourself claimed, Harry,” she said with a giggle, and Harry felt himself relax. He knew that Lila had warmed up to him a bit over the past weeks, but this was a far cry from the woman who’d looked like she might stab him with a drink stirrer for looking for Draco that first day.
“Hey, Shaw—if I haven’t told you both enough times today—that was some excellent work. I want you to take the rest of the day off.”
“Put this in that,” Draco said, looking horrified as he pointed at the stuffing and the turkey.
Harry grabbed their used glasses and headed to the bar, taking a deep breath. He needed to order some food also—the alcohol on an empty stomach was hitting him hard, nearly as hard as the realization of just how attracted he was to the Potions professor on the other side of the pub. His feelings certainly had softened for the man over the past two weeks as they made their plans and attempted to execute them. Harry had even found himself having fun, despite their lack of any success, but he was still unprepared for just how intense his crush had got.
Harry turned to see the rest of the team frozen, eyes trailing along the far wall. He turned back, unable to stop staring in horror.
“He’s good people.” Lila nodded towards him.
“Would you like me on my knees? Looking up at you? Would you like to sit in my chair?” Draco nodded towards his armchair that he often lounged on while Harry sucked him off or held a stress position. “Would you like to lay on the bed? Thrust into my mouth?”
Restacking them with the most recent requests on the top, Harry started on the first row, running a finger down the filing cabinets as he looked for the first date in his stack. He got to the cabinet and opened the drawer, shuffling through the folders with various months.
“She’s up in Willesden Green. You okay with taking the tube?” Draco asked.
“Yes,” Harry breathed.
Harry pretended to pay attention, nodding and humming his agreement every so often, grateful when George had finally had enough and interrupted Percy’s stream-of-consciousness rant about the Accounting Department to change the topic to his new Wheezes products.
“Hi, sorry—erm—come in? I’ll just grab my coat.” Harry pulled the door wide and stepped back, giving Draco room in the entryway. Harry grabbed a wool scarf off his coat rack, busying himself with wrapping himself up so that he couldn’t stare at the other man.
“Oh, it’s good,” Harry answered, quickly taking another sip.
“Go home. Go see Jess and take the night off,” Harry said more firmly this time.
And then,
Harry landed on the pavement. The heavy wooden door landed fully on top of him, having been ripped off its hinges from the blast.
Draco sighed before continuing, “We actually haven’t spoken since. Part of it was knowing that my father would always have influence in wizarding England—knowing I wouldn’t actually be able to get away from him.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and then took a sharp breath, his demeanour shifting at once back to cool and collected. “Sorry, you’re recovering and you nearly died. It isn’t the time. I’ll go put on some tea.” He turned to leave.
“Well, maybe I want to see if I'm right,” Draco said, meeting Paulo’s irritated glare.
“Highly unlikely.” She got up and followed Harry out of their office.
“Pleasepleaseplease
So now, feeling Draco’s slender but strong body move where his own should be as Harry walked to the loos had his stomach flipping over. It was awkwardly and terribly intimate, Harry was finding, to be in another person’s body.
Draco groaned underneath him and shifted so that Harry could slide a leg between Draco’s. Any insecurity Harry had vanished when he felt Draco’s already half-hard cock pressing up into his hip. His own cock had also filled out considerably over the last few minutes.
“Hey, Teddykins. Did you sleep well?” Harry walked over and sat at the end of his bed.
“Right.” Harry took a seat in the chair opposite the fireplace, feeling a bit self-conscious at their placement. While they’d have a clear view of anyone entering or exiting the staff room, they looked a bit like they were holding court, facing out to the room. “So which do you do?”
They’d never taken it this far in the office. Draco’s teasing never went past that. Of course, it all built up to enough sexual tension that it rarely took more than a couple of drinks at the pub before one of them was pulling the other out the door and into a hasty apparition straight into one of their bedrooms. But never in the office. After a day of tempting images rotating through Harry’s mind, he was slowly losing the battle with his own professionalism.
Draco wrapped one hand around the base of Harry’s cock before leaning in and slowly wrapping his lips around the lip. He swirled his tongue pulling a loud moan from Harry. A ghost of a smirk pulled at Draco’s lips even as they were wrapped around Harry’s cock, and Harry had to suppress a snort. For all that Draco loved being able to play the part of being in control of being in a position of power, he was far too damn competitive not to make sure that he gave Harry the best damn blow job. Draco then jerked his head, signalling he was ready. With a shaky sigh, Harry threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair and gently pushed, letting Draco set the pace to start.
*          *          *
“I still have my double lesson with seventh years” Harry replied.
He hadn’t originally wanted a big party, but Draco had insisted and once Hermione agreed and also started pushing it, Harry knew it was a lost cause. They’d been right though. Seeing all of his friends and family in one place—the Weasleys, friends from Hogwarts, Auror friends—filled Harry’s heart.
“Well, suffice it to say, there are a lot of regulations around them now. Which is great, really,” Harry added. “I’d be happy to pay a reasonable salary, but it’s been a bit of a mess with older house-elves refusing pay, and I don’t know—from what Hermione’s explained, there’s just generations of damage to be undone that led to that practise in the first place —it just seemed better to stay out of it for now.”
And given the clearly gay-friendly appearance of the pub, Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Malfoy might be settled in a way that he never dared to hope for himself. Could Malfoy possibly be gay? Would Harry have noticed? He wanted to think that he would have known somehow.
“Old man, my arse,” Harry said as Mel flopped down on one of the mats once the spell wore off, holding her sides.
“We’ll get you more help,” Harry said. “We promise—you’ll be okay now.”
“They have their own houses and lives too, Teddy,” Andromeda said, before turning to Harry and Draco. “Thank you both so much for watching Teddy this week. I don’t know what I would do without you two.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, fighting back a smile. “It’s tradition.”
He loses sight of it as Draco lowers the wand below Harry’s leg.
“Didn’t you two date right after the war?” Draco asked.
Harry took a slow drink, processing that information. “What about your mother? Wouldn’t it have gone to her?”
“Oh god, Draco—” Harry cries out. “Yeah, fuck…”
Healer Roth rolled her eyes with a smile and started towards the door before stopping and turning to him again. “Be careful out there, okay? This was a close one.”
Draco looked at him, eyes searching for a moment, and then nodded. “Sure. You’d better have better taste in movies than everything else in your life.”
Harry nodded against Draco’s shoulder and neck. “I’m sorry I left without saying anything this morning.”
“Everyone else okay? Can you let Ginny know I’m alright? She’ll freak out if I don’t reply to her texts.”
Harry’s laugh was cut short by two Junior Aurors coming in to inform them they were done. Ron walked off with them, making sure the room was fully clear and stopping to talk to Draco and his counsel.
Draco chuckles. Harry knows he loves when he gets like this, when Draco so thoroughly takes him apart, reveals this part of himself that Harry keeps so well hidden—when the hardened Assistant Head Auror is nowhere to be found and it’s just Harry, in his barest form.
But when Harry stepped in front of the mirror, he only saw himself standing beside Draco.
The witch cast something strong, sending Bradbourn off balance before she began turning towards Harry. Dark magic swirled out of the tip of her wand and curled towards him. He put up a shield just before it could hit and moved in front of Bradbourn, who was clearly injured but trying to pick himself back up.
“She’s really pretty, Harry. Do you want me to ask if she’d be interested? I could even keep it vague if you want, like tell her a little bit about you but not say it’s you,” Aubrey continued.
“I don’t want to be set up, and I don’t want to use a damn wizarding dating app,” Harry finally snapped.
*          *          *
After a sharp smack on Harry’s arse, Draco steps back, and Harry forces himself not to scramble into position. God, he loves this. Being used, being of service. He already knows that he’s going to spend the better part of the day rock hard and leaking. After sinking slowly to his knees in front of Draco’s large and ornate desk, he crawls in the space underneath, turning around and getting into position.
Harry fought back a flush. His mind had been continually wandering back to Draco all morning—thinking about when he’d next go visit him at the pub. Before he could come up with some excuse, though, Higgins cried out in triumph as he pinned his partner to the mat.
Harry thrusts his hips, a sob escaping him. He feels it build, pooling in his gut, and then he comes—a cruel painful orgasm that rips through him. The pressure on his cock, on his prostate, on his perineum all become too much immediately.
“The drink—” Draco nodded at Harry’s hand.
Ron caught the motion and frowned. “Let me know before you sign out of here tomorrow, okay?”
She put her hand on his knee bringing his focus back. “Hey. You’re safe here, you know? No one is going to judge you here, not for being gay, not for being in the closet, not for being a cop,” she added with a smirk. “None of it.”
Harry let out a sigh of relief. “Higher.”
“Molly—” Arthur playfully swatted her arm with the newspaper. “Give him a minute to breathe.”
Flip. Three of Clubs.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco held up a hand.
He hears one of them huff and then melodramatic foot stomps from both of them slowly becoming quieter before a door slams.
It didn’t take long. Only a few strokes, the vibrating plug pressing up against Harry’s prostate, before Harry yelled out. Come shot in long ropes across his stomach and chest. He let out a long sigh, his body singing with the relief of finally being allowed to come.
Hermione nodded, gaining confidence. “Exactly like a vaccine, except this vaccine has the added effect of weakening the overall disease.”
Then, as he was walking out, he smacked directly into Ginny, who looked like she had something urgent. Draco looked around, there were a few people within earshot, he'd have to be careful.
a love potion. Ron just needed an out from-" Ginny paused, batting her eyelashes and pouting dramatically, "Lav-Lav." Ginny could only hold the pose for a few more seconds before she burst out laughing. Harry joined her, loud and wild, and even Luna tittered, giggling like silver bells.
Harry looked at Luna, grinning. "Are you saying I'm confused, Luna?"
he couldn't have stopped himself if he tried.
Draco looked down. "Harry...I-" He sighed. "I can't do this."
"We might need your help to brew this antidote, especially since you are the one he is attracted to. Some of these antidotes require hair or even the presence of the object of attraction. Just…I hope we,
"I missed you." Harry whispered. "I missed you so much."
Still, neither of them particularly liked contact past hand-holding and hugs. Draco hadn't exactly crossed a border today, they'd agreed that kisses would be necessary for the public, but with Pansy knowing about Draco's crush, she'd feel more uncomfortable knowing she was being used to gain revenge. Draco could understand why Pansy was upset. Draco would have to apologize properly for that and he knew he'd be forgiven, but at least he knew what was going through Pansy's head.
“We will, Harry.” Luna’s voice, usually so light and dreamy, was dead serious.
what his situation was now, and why even
Not that Harry had to observe Malfoy anymore. His every suspicion had been confirmed, and while he'd destroyed Malfoy's plan, he couldn't help but think there was more to it. Still, he knew he wouldn't get any more information out of Malfoy. Watching him now was just... a habit, a

now and he was so happy for his two best friends but...Merlin, did they have to be so...lovey-dovey?
Harry faced the sky once more, sighing. The Great Lake lapped at the shore just a few meters away, softly splashing each time it hit the shore. Harry contemplated jumping in, just to avoid this conversation, but he had no doubts that Ginny would dive in after him and drag him back out by the ear. "So, is this an intervention?"

cutting I have seen. Truly, Potter, Longbottom has done better than this." To Draco's surprise, Potter didn't even complain, and when Snape turned away, Draco even saw him...smirk?
Granger cleared her throat. "Malfoy, I think we were in the middle of something.."
“If you can wait for me while I meet someone later,” His grip on your waist is too tight, and the way his face is close to yours is nauseating. But you don’t show it. “— I wouldn’t be opposed to it.”
Cool liquid pours out from his back and your shaky hands come into contact with the knife plunged into the man’s back.
You wrinkle your nose, remembering the seas of green. Before, the colour would’ve been associated with the shade of your common room, but right now, it brings you back to memories with Him at Hogwarts — hidden corridors, the back of the quidditch pitch, and dining tables that were worlds apart.
“Ten years, Harry.” He blinks at the shift from the name you used to call him. It used to be a secret for the both of you how you say it in a tone that’s unlike any scathing word in your vocabulary. But now the name holds no value, it no longer holds any form of love between you two, and instead, there's what you can consider as hurt in your voice. You gaze at the vast nothingness in front of you. The stars are twinkling.  “Shouldn’t you be with Blaise?”
“Malfoy,” he hears someone call out to him. You realize what this means for you, and you let go of the body as you step back. “
“Yeah,” Potter says, shuffling his feet. Why he said that you have no idea. Actually, you do, but you’d rather pretend you’ve forgotten about his presence. He’s nervous by the looks of it, and he probably hasn’t outgrown the habits he had when he was younger.
"There's nothing
"Okay, okay, maybe just one or two favours then."
"The room you busted us in last year, Malfoy."
"Pansy!" Draco shoved her to the side, sticking out his tongue when she swore at him. He ignored Pansy’s rant, instead he looked at Daphne and raised his hands up in surrender. Daphne glared at him with narrowed eyes for a few moments, then nodded and turned back to her breakfast.
"Fenrir Greyback." Now the pleasant tone in Dumbledore's voice did fade, if only just slightly. "It's not the full moon tonight."
"No, but I want to. I want you to...know, especially since this potion is going to be gone soon. I'd rather….I'd rather you hear now, because...now at least I know you'll forgive me. Even if it's fake I...I need you to forgive me." Draco took a deep, shaky breath in. "The Dark Lord, he...he made me take the Mark. And he told me….I need to kill Dumbledore, or else..."
When he woke up, a few hours later according to the clock on the wall, Draco was no longer in bed. Harry had expected as much, he knew Draco was going to go back to help Hermione but...it wasn't fun to wake up to an empty bed. The pile of ash that was once the cabinet had been cleaned up, which was nice. The cabinet…..suddenly Harry remembered where he'd seen the cabinet before. Borgin and Burkes, that creepy shop in Knockturn Alley. And he'd heard of it last year too, when Fred and George had...A Vanishing Cabinet. That's what it was. And its pair was in…
Perfect. That kiss would have been perfect. Everything was already so nice, it just wasn't
" Ron's eyes were wide.
Luna smiled, placing the crown on Harry's head. It fell slightly, sitting at a crooked angle, and Luna giggled. "I'll see you then. I guess you have to go prepare for...whatever that is, hm?"
Draco kissed him again, softly, then rested their foreheads together.
"I don't want to get rid of you, ever, Draco. I just….I don't want you to lose someone you love."
Oh. His
Only then did he let himself break down, sobbing, curled into a ball, until his tears dried out and his chest felt empty.
The house put out, Hagrid stormed towards the castle, Fang following him. "Not possible, he's just fakin' it Harry, let's go, he'll be waiting'." He paused, as if waiting for Harry to join him, but when Draco shook his head, he gave a sympathetic nod and continued to the castle.
Ginny pressed a slip of paper into Draco's hand, watching carefully as the people passed them by. As soon as they did, her expression softened. "And how are you holding up, Draco?"

that had his best interests in mind. His mother, at least, was cognizant of the situation. And slowly, Draco had seen, she was becoming more and more...disillusioned with the whole of pureblood society, though she wouldn't dare admit it. No, if they couldn't both be saved, Draco would want to get his mother out of there, Malfoy Manor be damned.
Pansy smirked. "We make sure of it, don't we darling?"

Draco stroked Harry's hair, looking around the Gryffindor common room. He never thought he'd be able to see it. Perhaps in seventh year, as a final year prank, but not before that. Now, he spent as much time in there as he did his own common room. Now that Draco's mother was safely with the order, living with her estranged sister Andromeda, Draco was less afraid of who saw him where. Harry could not care less, at least after Draco had assured him that he was totally fine about everyone knowing they were together.
, Potter." Draco cupped Harry's face, turning it to him so their eyes met. He was struck by how green Harry's eyes were, bright and passionate, and Draco had to remind himself to continue. "These two would follow you to the ends of the Earth and beyond, and so would I. If you went alone, all three of us would lose our minds worrying about you. Besides, even with the message Dumbledore left, do you think the Order is going to trust me?"
"...Why?"
Harry got up. "That's not going to happen. I'm not going to nor am I going to let anyone hurt him, and I feel

in the midst of Draco's big unrequited love speech? The expression on Draco's face seemed to make Harry laugh even more, which,
Hermione's brow furrowed, and she exchanged a look with Draco. "...He can go with you."
Silence fell upon the table, until it grew too heavy for Draco to bear.
The complaints had come through the woodwork. Dumbledore's death and Ministry orders had dominated the Prophet, but Witch Weekly had picked up on it immediately. Most likely some jealous girl had sent in a tip, thinking to cause enough chaos that Draco and Harry would get fed up and split.
“I’m serious, Gin….when I go, you all take a few drops of Felix Felicis. I know Neville couldn’t make it, give him some too. I only have that much but….it’ll have to be enough. You guys keep people safe.”
He rolled his eyes, though slightly confused. Ginny wasn't really the soft-talk type, nor did she give false platitudes. She was sitting with Harry when he and Luna…. So what did she mean?
Draco shoved him. "Potter!"
confident that even if one did rise up, he could quash them. Draco sighed, pulling out his wand to cast a quick soothing charm, but before he could move something pulled him to the side, into an abandoned classroom.
are you laughing?"
Just then, Colin Creevey came running up to them. "Hey, hey Harry! Dumbledore came back and he sent a note for you."
, and perhaps Draco was imagining things but Potter even seemed to be leaning into Draco's chest.
Draco sighed, pulling Harry close. "We're going with you, Harry, and that's final. We love you too much to let you go alone."
now and Draco...Harry didn't know who's side Draco was on.
Granger grit her teeth but she seemed to come to some understanding. Her gaze too flickered over to Draco and...Merlin, he didn't think he'd seen that kind of loathing on her face since she punched him in third year. Draco had half a mind to cast a Shield charm around himself, just in case. But Granger simply flounced off, sitting next to Blaise with a sour expression. Draco sighed, he didn't get much from his reconnaissance other than something was

"Look, you two were the ones complaining that I was obsessing over him, well maybe I just passed out and now I'm actually acting on...whatever feelings I had."

and gaining several books right out of the Headmaster's library. Just another thing Dumbledore had hidden from them, something important that they should have known beforehand.
Hermione grinned at them before leaving arm in arm with Ron. While Draco sincerely hated losing that bet, he had to admit the two made a picturesque couple.
Draco exhaled sharply, holding out his hand for the container of beetles, still averting his eyes. It took a few moments, but Potter handed them over, ground to perfection. He was...quiet too, which was a first for him. "Acceptable, Potter." Draco didn't turn around this time, he didn't want to see what expression Potter would hold.
"Harry, we do, it's just-" The rest of Hermione's words were drowned out as Harry heard blood rush into his ears. Vaguely, he could hear someone calling his name, quietly at first but then with more and more urgency. He was more concerned with how it seemed that all his friends had suddenly grown taller, and why the air behind his head suddenly felt cool and hard.

Weasley looked as if he was about to argue, but he stopped as Granger set a hand on his shoulder and shook her head at him, gently. Weasley deflated, looking to the side, and Draco breezed past the both of them, giving Weasley and especially Granger a brisk nod. After all, he still had business to attend to with Granger.
Draco scanned the titles. All of them were on...love at first sight.
The kiss seemed to last ages, but when Draco pulled away for air it felt too short. Harry blinked up at him, glasses crooked and slightly fogged, red lips grinning at him in that special grin that was beautifully
It was a clear instruction, but Harry couldn't help but object. "But sir-"

Surprisingly, Weasley spoke first. "Draco, if there's-"

this expression, yet somehow Harry just...pulled it from him.
"And," Draco said, slowly, "who would that person be?"
Draco's hand found its way into Harry's curly hair, matted slightly from laying in bed without brushing it. With a few strokes, Harry found his anxiety melting away. As he drifted off, he heard Draco respond, softly.
Harry slid up to kiss Draco's lips, softly. "Mmm, but I'm your idiot."
Luna sighed, but she nodded, joining Ginny and Draco. She offered them both smiles and though the jealousy Draco had felt flared up once more he couldn't help but smile back. He couldn't ever be angry with his cousin, and if she was finding happiness...Draco was happy.
Draco rolled his eyes. "That covers hearing, not sight, and with the way your girlfriend is glaring at me right now I don't think I'm going to survive the week."

"That depends, Harry." Luna's light voice floated through the air. "Do you think you need an intervention?"
it felt but..."
Luna sidled up to Harry, who wrapped his arm around her, smiling at her softly. Luna smiled back, leaning into him, while Ginny walked off to scrounge for rocks to skip on the lake.
To their credit, Weasley and Hermione had been rather supportive. Hermione especially, with checking in with him before and after the meetings they had with Dumbledore. She wasn't aware of...the whole plan, that was between Dumbledore and himself, but she knew enough to know that Harry was just one of many things weighing on his shoulders at the moment. Overall, she seemed….resigned. Apparently, it wasn't uncommon for Harry to draw away when faced with emotional stress, and one had to just...wait for him to come back. Unless you were in Draco's position, and you had to satisfy yourself from watching Harry from afar.
too gone. This would be a problem later, but Draco could sincerely see no way out. Perhaps it would be easier to break it off when Harry himself didn't…. Draco closed his eyes, taking in a sharp breath. Once he regained his composure, he turned to face Hermione.
Harry ruffled Ginny's hair, laughing as she pulled away and dodging her attempt at a noogie. "That I did."
