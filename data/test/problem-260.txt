“Because the emergency spells were never activated. However, Gringotts is certain the ring is on a black property.”
It held him captive. Werewolves in a terribly long maze. Letter with words he couldn’t read and a cup with a glow like a will O’ the wisp and he knew if he grabbed it then nothing would be the same. He didn’t know how but there was Cedric breathless and excited. So they grabbed the goblet together.
“Neither did I.” Ron said standing up to give Harry a bear hug. “When I got my letter for school this year, this damn thing fell out on the table! Mum got all misty eyed and Fred and George wouldn’t stop calling me ‘mini Percy’ for
“Come, my pet.” Voldemort hissed reaching down to pick him up, “We have much to do today. Perhaps you’ll get a meal today if anyone displeases me.”
So...thoughts? Yeah, a bit cliche type ending but I love that kind of stuff! Leave a comment long short or just emojis to let me know your thoughts! I'll see ya'll next time! :)
“I think a hardy stew should do it, no?” She said to no one in particular and Harry smiled. He could stay for another hour or so, to rest up a little and get his fill of stew. Then he could go home and sleep, and he had to prepare Adafrid for their guest in a couple of days, because he was
“Okay…I need you to take my money pouch and buy some groceries. Bread, meat, cheese. Maybe flour milk and eggs? Not too much just enough to get by- shoot. I should probably make a list. I don’t even know if I have enough.”
“Since I’m one of the Slytherin prefects I’ll let you off with a warning.” He got up close to Harry’s face, “But next time I’ll dock points for inconsiderate space use.” Draco’s cloak was blocking most of Harry’s form from the others, he reached out and slipped a note into the pocket of Harry’s waist coat.
Ron nodded, “You look good mate. Mum’s always shoving me in the sweaters she makes. No time for me to dress up in the nicer stuff with all the work we’ve been getting up to, I suppose.”
Sidra hissed softly and rewrapped herself around Harry’s shoulders tucking her head against his throat.
He went to his room to grab his wand. Harry hadn’t used his holly wand once since he had gotten this one from Adafrid…what was he going to do when he got to Hogwarts?
The snake placed her head on Harry’s knee and Harry felt a twinge of…something in his chest and he stroked the larger body of the creature. The scales were smooth, when he touched the snake something inside him unraveled a little. Like a string coming loose.
The hallway had three doors, two at the front and one at the back of the hall. With a deep breath he walks down the hall and the door at the back the door was ornate and taller than the others. There were carvings in the door and the handle was a lever type handle that had filigree on it and unlike the rest of the house, there was no dust.
“They’re called Thestrals.” Luna supplies and also reaches up and starts to pet the creature, “They’re only visible to those who have witnessed death.” Her tone was light and wistful, but considering that Luna was younger than Harry he was certain his heart shattered.
“Oh yes, thanks.” He whispered the address to the tawny owl and it blinked once and grabbed the package  by the strings and flew off. Harry even tipped!
“Very good give me your hand Mister Potter so that you will not drip blood like a badly tuned faucet.”
“Yeah, when the defensive mechanism is activated, it spews a horribly smelling sap to fend off animals that would wand to eat it.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he was alive anymore. His heart beat, his lungs breathed but even the nightmares had stopped making his blood race. It was just another reality in his broken world.
I would really like to hear your thoughts down in the comments long, short, or just full of emojis it all makes my day that much brighter! See you all in the next one! :D
The older goblin nodded, “It is appreciated. Mister Potter, please accompany Jortook and she will take care of your lineage tracking.”
She took out her wand, and made a complicated and lengthy spell motion, when she finish with a tight flourish down, an invisible shield opened up to let them inside.
“Fantastic.” Sirius grinned, “Haven’t had to do something that stuffy in quite some time! This should be fun.”
“Hmm…a Gaunt. It has been quite some time since I’ve seen that name. Congratulations Harry Potter, you have a proper claim to the family ring you hold as well as the vaults connected to it. Is there anything else you need?”
But it was too late, a being clothed in raged torn clothes flew into view, obscuring the view behind it. Harry tried to keep his breathing even, it fed on fear. He had faced worse before he could do this. Harry barely turned his face to Dudley and tried to convey ‘stay calm’ to him but Dudley either didn’t see or didn’t care, he was white as a hospital sheet and sweating like a pig trembling from head toe.
No one in that group was particularly fit, so Harry was sure he could give them the slip. Damn if only he could hide like Sidra!
And just like she had appeared before him her form disappeared despite the fact that he could still feel her weight on his shoulders.
“-so we will take you where you need to go!” He looked up and his red rimmed eyes blinked taking in the sighy of harry. Stanley’s hat still didn’t fit properly light the rest of his baggy clothes but he had haven recently at least.
Harry glowed at the praise and they kept walking, they reached the edge of a street and they walked down, getting closer to some muggle apartment complex. But not just
Harry reached out and gently grasped the white and grey stripped wood. And warmth travelled up his arm, it kept going but stopped at his shoulder and Harry wide-eyed stood still.
Hendret nodded, “That can be arranged. Thank you for your patronage. Would you like the ancestry tapestry placed in storage?”
Harry thought about the sun beating down on his neck, about the rush of freedom at being away from the Dursleys and he wanted to make a light, a small light that would be comforting. He felt the magic curling and simmering in his hand and he closed his fist.
It was a soft tingle like his fingers had fallen asleep but it had a feeling to it- a tingle of magic that he had felt only at Hogwarts. He thought harder about holding onto this feeling until his whole hand tingled from the sensation.
While he was checking out of the book shop, he asked for directions to the food market and giddily followed the directions to an alley off the alley. Otherwise known as:
Harry repeated the message to Sirius and he took out a wand, different from the one he had seen in third year, this one was smooth with vine and leaf carvings at the handle.
And he grabbed one of his razors from his nightstand and his only set of pajamas (which were really just an old top and shorts from Dudley that were too small for him from a birthday many years ago).
Please take note of the tags! It was pretty obvious in the first chapter but self-harm will be mentioned again in the contents of this chapter! It's a mention and implication, but please take care of yourselves!
“Oh, uh, at least until the term at Hogwarts starts. It’s a little less than a month. I can clean up this place, manage the yard that sort of stuff to earn my keep here.”
“Uh- I, I don’t really get along with a powerful wizard, and a bad one at that, and he…might have sent it?”
Sidra followed Harry into the bathroom. He looked expectantly up at him and he rolled his eyes, turing the nearby bin into a rock for her to perch on and soak up the warm steam.
He didn’t have to purchase much food, in fact, he was pretty much covered on the fruit side of things. Minus bananas.
Not that the locks were ever used anymore. They hung on his door as a brutal reminder of the what if's. Despite the threats that Moody had made at the start of the summer.
The storeroom was the first door across from the stairs and he opened up and was met with the familiar smell of dust. He looked for the standing mirror and bee-lined for that, not bothering to look at anything else. Indeed, there was a chest by the mirror and Harry took a deep breath and kneeled in front of the pandora’s box of charity and he didn’t even know if he was going to
Harry looked at the plant, it looked like round lumps ontop of round lumps, like graps but a sickening shade of green with red spot that had white heads on them. Like acene ready to explode.
She hissed as Harry walked closer to take in the contents ontop of the desk and sure enough there was a wand, it was almost as long as Harry’s holly wand but it looked more elegant, it had a handle that looked carved specifically to hold and at the based appeared to be a stone embedded in the base of the handle. Sidra crawled off of harry and onto the desk circled the wand, flicking her tongue.
Dobby showed him how the quick grow seeds worked, helped Harry understand the watering procedures and such. Dobby helped organized the pantry and the wizard Ice Box. Dobby showed harry how the stove worked and even assisted with making new meals.
Harry took a deep breath and took off the ring, he then placed the ring as asked for seal down. He prepared himself for nothing to light up but the moment he took his hand away it began to glow!
of having living family, in one form or another, was a dream he had given up in his first year. He looked at the ring with its engraving on it. It was a family shield of some sort. Wings, and the image… of a little cherub holding a snake. Of course, with all the statues lining the walkway here.
Sure enough, a castle pulled into view and the buss stopped about a mile out. “Castle Arundel!” Stanley announced and Harry stood up and got his things. When he got off there no other people around. He took a deep breath waved Stanley good bye. Stanley tipped his hat walked back into the bus shouting  and the bus sped off in a blur of purple.
the Potter family. Through her, I got the Gaunt Ring. The wards protecting the house let me in on the president of me being family member and heir to the house and its assets.”
The food finished heating and he grabbed a fork and ate. It wasn’t nearly as good as it being fresh but something was better than nothing. He cleaned his plate and hand-washed the dishes then dried them before putting them back exactly where he found them. That was a good meal and now he could go to his room and relax for once.
to those laughing at him for not understanding his miss-steps. His life was basically the punchline to a terrible joke.
Harry took a deep breath, closing his eyes a little, thinking back to the kiss just after their Dance at the Yule Ball. How their kiss had tasted like hickory smoke and burnt rose petals.
“Dobby?” Harry asks aloud to the room, and with a soft crack there was the elf in his mitch matched socks.
“No more than five minutes. Don’t make me come back and get you.” She didn’t wait for an affirmative before leaving again.
“I, Sirius Black, solemnly swear to keep the secret you have given. I swear to never divulge the name of the location you have shared with me to others without magical permission. I will not divulge the location via word of mouth, written letter, pensive memory, or placing it on a map. If I break this oath, willingly or through coercion all memory I have will of this secret fade into nothingness. Do you accept my word?”
Harry walked up to them and they didn’t turn their heads to look at him. He waited but they seemed to only have eyes for one another.
The word was stuck in the back of his throat. A place without the Durlsey’s. A place where he could cook for himself. A place he didn’t feel the need to share with
Harry glared at her, and stood in front of her, waiting. She continued her screaming, and he held up a hand when Ron came up to try and get the cloth back around her.
And that’s what broke the illusion. That’s what took Malfoy away from him. But it never could have lasted right? They would have had to separate for summer anyway. He probably would’ve died. There’s no way his parents would’ve let him over to their place or vice versa.
Harry hummed and Sidra crawled into his lap, coiling herself, her weight tangible her visibility none.
“It really was. If it wasn’t thanks to her teaching me about getting a magic boost from the moon my cousin’s soul would’ve been eaten by a dementor.” And his shortly after probably.
Soooo did it bother anyone else how they would mention certain spells and then wouldn't explain how they worked like with the fidellus? Or how it seemed that the Unbreakable Vow was just plum...ineffective? So- I expanded on two other concepts!
It was the same format as the one Sirius had spoken. Minus the name, she gave her own name and Harry accepted her oath, and they completed everything. Molly didn’t look nearly as exhausted as Harry felt. He wanted to go to bed and not get out for at least 12 hours.
It was like the stag was connected to his fingers and with a shout he commanded his patronus with a wave of his arm at the Dementor.
He hissed and the Stag came to life at the entrance of the tunnel. The light coming from the stag paired with the moon tight it almost looked full.
Harry nodded and rubbed at his forehead when he sat and reached over to start grabbing a serving of the pancakes.
Harry chuckles, “I’ll have to check in with Neville and see if his dad remembers. Hey- maybe if his dad is like, not a ministry crony we could arrange for you two to meet-“
She didn’t look convinced, but she snapped back to attention, looking around again. “We better get inside. Who knows who’s out and about? Come along dears, I’ll make us all tea.”
all three of you all right. Harry stood up and Mrs. Weasley took the chance to hug him, he redirected her arms away from his neck so she wouldn’t hurt Sidra but other than that it was warm and nice and very much welcome.
He fled No.4  before Vernon even made his way back down. He ran to the small forest Vernon wouldn’t look for him there.
than happy to assist. Insisting that since Hogwarts was closed for the summer he had nothing more important to look forward to.
“That’s great Neville!” Harry praised, “I bet you’ll be one of the best herbologists out there when we get out of school.”
Harry laid on his back and Sidra coiled onto his chest, it was pretty easy to fall into sleep, and even better he wasn’t plagued with nightmares for the first time in weeks.
Harry hummed to himself and continued about his day, gathering his money and readying the hike out to the street to summon the knight bus.
He greeted her and he reached into the pocket that Malfoy had slipped the piece of paper in and Harry gently pulled it out and unfolded it.
Came a hiss from his chest and he looked down to see Sidra, who was in fact not a dream, on his chest looking at him intently.
But there was something different about the carriages. They had something in front of them. The creatures looked like horses, but they had no fur and they were
Harry hummed and looked down at himself, “Uh, consider it camouflage. I blend in easier and people don’t bother me as much.”
Ginny frowned and walked up next to Harry, “It looks like you’re holding your hand up in the air.” But she raised her hand up and gently reached out placing it next to Harry’s. She looked surprised but interested.
Harry gulped and gingerly turned away from anything too breakable. Having a little light couldn’t be to destructive could it?
Ron fist bumped Harry and the three of them continued to talk. The afternoon was becoming quite enjoyable, that is, until Mrs. Weasley bustled in with panic in her eyes scanning everyone inside. When she caught sight of them her shoulders dipped with relief and she quickly made her way over, weaving her way through the patrons like a champion.
He nodded and Hendret nodded back and snapped his fingers and items appeared in a small flourish of gold sparks.
Hermione and Ron were going to be there, especially since Hermione had made it a point that ‘since Harry had play Hermit the whole summer he must socialize before the train’ which was her own strange way of saying she missed Harry and wanted to see him before school stress got to her.
Harry kept cleaning and caring for the trees and chickens and life was honestly very peaceful. Adafrid was very helpful with homework and filling in the theory and explaining certain magical concepts.
“We weren’t anywhere near Azkaban. At least, I hope not. Surrey is a pretty odd place for a wizards prison to be.”
dark path. But that’s the past!” Sirius waved away his solemn demeanor being covered up by enthusiasm. “Tell me everything about those muggles and how you got away from them. You gave Molly a good fright, no tracking spell we used could find you, you know! Even actively tracking Hedwig was useless.”
Ron groaned and they headed out of the compartment, when Harry called out, “Don’t let the power go to your head Mini-Percy!”
I stan good Godfather Sirius who treats harry like an actual son rather than him acting like the fun uncle all the time. So what're your thoughts? Long, short, or emoji's it doesn't matter all of it makes my day just a little brighter! See you all next time. :)
Sirius blinked a couple of times his mouth a little slack, but eventually, it got through and he nodded and let out an impressed chuckle, “Sounds like you’ve been
Everyone headed into the apartment, Harry walking behind them. It seemed that the hallway they were walking into was long and dark, like there wasn’t many light sources to make it brighter, or something was soaking up the light too fast for it to properly light the area.
“I’m sorry.” Adafrid held up his hand, “I believe those two pieces of information could fill up a book alone. Actually, I think we’ll have to put this conversation on pause because I’m certain you need tea and perhaps some food to nosh on. Did you happen to bring anything with you? I’m afraid what remains in my cupboards is nothing but dust.”
The sap was a murky dirty brown and it was like sewage, sweat, and manure had a god awful baby and even Sidra was gagging and hissing.
Sirius grinned, “Sounds like a dream. A nice clean bright place to take care of chickens! You deserve something nice after all the shit you’ve been through.”
3 hours isn’t a lot of sleep but even when Aunt Petunia started pounding on the door he felt warm waking up.
Sirius nodded and placed his wand hand ontop of the tiny stone hand of the cherub and it glowed, the eyes flashed a blue and the Cherub, where it had looked solemn and serious it gave a small smile.
What was the point of living a life if everything was only going to be taken away from him? But they couldn’t take away this. The pain that he could feel that reminded him that he wasn’t as dead as he felt.
from Dudley you- FREAK!” And he pushed Harry aside and they bumbled into the car and closed the door behind them leaving Harry behind.
in front of Harry. Like taking off a cloak it was just there! The snake was black, blending in with the ground but in the moonlight, the black scales glimmered like stones. Pink or green as it slithered with its body coming closer to harry. The eyes of this snake, however, were a bright familiar green.
“This is it.” Mrs. Weasley said and took a deep breath, she looked around for other muggles watching or possibly snooping magical folk but found none. (thanks to Harry’s spell of course.)
Adafrid looked apprehensive, “I was speaking to Sidra about that. And she mentioned that there was no exchange of magic at the wards. When I designed my home I made sure to have two lines of defense. First, the guardian to accept a magical offering. Which is a loose contract of civility. Next, is registering an unfamiliar magical signature. But all you did was touch the wards.”
he chanted in his mind and the Patronus followed his command rearing its head and bolting towards Dementor antlers down to pierce its target.
Hendret grunted and exaimed the results himself, “The tapestry was treated with a potion designed to find lineages with traces of magic. Was your mother a New Blood?”
That was a thought for a different time because the clock in the hallway started to gently announce it was 10 o’clock with the ringing of a bell and harry grinned, Sirius should be at the entrance with the statue soon!
“Good.” Hendret said, “Now, take the Potter ring and press it into the parchment next to your name and the dispelling will be complete.”
“Go wash up.” Ginny waved him off, “I’m gong to see if we can get this…plant in a stable position away from trouble.”
“Right.” Sirius interrupted Harry’s train of thought, “An Unbreakable Vow is making a promise. Like killing an enemy or protecting an ally…keeping a secret. If you break that vow, you die. So, let’s say I made a vow to you to keep a secret, if I broke that vow- I would die. Hey- I know that look let me continue.
“Careful Potter.” Malfoy muttered, “Wouldn’t want your precious pretty Potter head to get cracked open would be? Watch your step next time.” Malfoy pushed by Harry and he disappeared into the sea of people.
Harry hummed and gathered up the wand. And headed for the main room of the house. A table should be safe if it goes wrong, right? Harry hummed rolling the wand back and forth in his hand.
Ron shook his head, “Being magically emancipated just allows you access to bank stuff like property or money in the bank. It allows orphans of magical families to support themselves and get
He let her soak in there for a minute or two before pulling her out and drying her off. Hopefully, by the time he got back, things would be much better and no Mimbulus mania to worry over.
Harry nodded and mumbled a thank you. He sat in the chair that wasn’t the red armchair in the painting but it was a simpler style but seemed very comfortable.
Adafrid nodded, “Good, now put it on your dominant hand’s index finger. It should resize to your hand.
With a fairy successful trip all he had left to do was spend a friendly afternoon with his friends, who should be waiting for him in the leaky cauldron.
When he finished, he put on his clothes and was toweling off his hair on his way back downstairs Sidra was comfortably wrapped around his shoulders.  Harry took in the warm sweet smell of pancakes being cooked.
Harry was not unfamiliar with food markets he wasn’t even unfamiliar with going food shopping in general but there were so many vendors and the
“Dudley? That was a dementor; we need to get you home and some chocolate in you. I’m sorry you had to deal with that, but you’ll be okay.” He hoped so anyway. Dudley was a muggle, and he didn’t know what exactly happened when a dementor leached off of a muggle, but it couldn’t be good. By the distant look in Dudley’s eyes and his slack jaw with his mouth mouthing words that didn’t make sense.
His trunk had a couple of granola bars in it, and an old chocolate frog. But there was no other food or water there.
“But it’s okay, I went to the bank and they told me I was magically emancipated because of the Tournament last year. Seriously, I’m okay-“
“Fascinating. Jortook!” He snapped his fingers and another Goblin appeared, this goblin was wearing more light greens than the other browns of the Goblin’s dress. “Are you familiar with the protocols of section 6 B of the Treasury Charters?”
The room was wide and longer than he thought the room should be and on the right side of the room there was a ladder, and Harry looked up and this room was much, much taller than he thought a place like think should be.
Harry laughed genuinely because, of course, Ron wouldn’t have known. He wouldn’t make a big deal out of it.
Harry nodded, “You’ve helped me a lot. I have faith this is something you can handle, but I would like you to make a wizard's oath to not divulge the location without my permission.”
Molly made a choking sound and Sirius nodded crossing his arms pointing his chin up “You see? Now let me get him what he’s come for and we can
Jortook spoke of a light air of curiosity as they walked and Harry just listened, unsure of how to provide more information to the conversation. He grew up in a household that condemned magic but wasn’t the most religious of places to be.
Harry slept, but he couldn’t say it was well. Because he dreamt he was a snake, a snake crawling on the ground up to Voldemort’s throne. The way he looked at the snake (harry?) made Harry want to throw up. It was twisted and fond but it was all teeth and his lips were so thing it didn’t look like there were any at all.
Ron laughed, “Nah, they don’t teach it in History. Mum likes to gossip with her friends and discuss stuff with Bill about ‘all he needs to know’ and never really know when I’m listening in. I pick up on stuff too.”
“Yeah, found her in this little nook in Surrey. She was hunting for mice and it uh, had been a long time since she had been around a wizard. Let alone a partsle tongue.
Harry agreed and just let himself be soothed to sleep with the feeling of Sidra’s weight and the pulsing marks on his legs.
and McGonigal owled these meeting schedules and the hall patrol and, mate…how am I going to have enough time to sleep
Dobby waited expectantly for Harry and he was bouncing on his feet and Harry looked at…everything that Dobby had gotten.
“To HELL with that freak! Dudley had gone through SHOCK. The doctors are keeping him another night just to make sure he won’t hurt himself! I have had enough of you this summer! Hissing when no one is there, freaky magic, you ruining EVERYTHING for my family!” Veron got closer and crowded up into Harry’s face. “You will LEAVE and I don’t want to see your freakish face until next summer boy!”
Like with the moon he tried to imagine the magic of this wand like a pool he wanted to touch to get a feel for the ‘water’. It was cool, the magic. Like rain on a hot day, and it felt welcoming. Occasionally pulsing, like a heartbeat. The magic certainly felt pleased.
Harry smiled and sat on the bed. “It’s not that complicated. Dementors attacked me n’ Dudley, the Dursley’s freaked out and kicked me out of the house. I had…a friend who showed me a place I could stay. Old, well-protected. Dobby helped me get access to food. It’s in the middle of a forest so it’s very peaceful. Oh, and I have chickens. So it’s not like I never not have something to do.”
Harry was going to ask for more, but the other side of the chamber opened up to reveal another Goblin. Harry immediately stood up.
Update 5/23/21: I've made a couple small changes to add some exposition and smooth over a couple sections! No big changes were made that will affect the overall plot of this fic!
Hendret handed it to Harry. The crest was small and compact but it was easy to spot the lion, it was surrounded by scrolling that looked like cloth and it had bustles of…
It was now Harry’s turn to look a little pensive, “I don’t know Hermione, I’ve really enjoyed the time I’ve had to myself. And I just made some delivery purchases, wouldn’t want them to get rained on or something.”
Sirius nodded and took a bite out of his sandwich. “Yes. It’s a group Dumbledore built to fight back against the Death Eaters that Mouldy Butt made to carry out his evil deeds.”
Sirius turned to Harry with a proud smile, “Just learned about Oath and already you’re thinking out of the box!”
Sirius shrugged as they walked back down the stairs, there was chattering in the kitchen area as they walked in and when they opened the door Molly Arthur and Remus were talking over a contract of some sort. Ron and Hermione were talking over some biscuits and tea Sirius popped over and grabbed a handful of the biscuits. And spun his way over to the icebox and reached and pulled out a beer.
So what did you all think? Leave a comment! You can leave a long thesis, short comment, an emoji, or a STRING of emoji's!! It's all welcome here! See you all next time!
” Hissed a wretchedly horrible familiar voice, and he tried to get to Cedric before the flash of green light. He was never fast enough.
“I’ve been able to see them since first year. My mother passed away when I was a little girl.” Luna shared, she kept a light tone, but there was something dim behind her pale blue eyes.
“Well, if he went to south France then I’m sure he had a good turnout. Not very strong potions makers.”
“Learning from past mistakes.” Harry corrected softly, “I don’t want what happened to me and my parents to happen ever again.”
He pointed his wand at the seats and cast the spell again, the spell cleaned that just as easily and Harry grinned and even let out a giggle as he continued to cast the spell at the different spaces around him. He stayed away from the mantel or anything perhaps too delicate for spell work but the fact he was doing
Harry nodded and pressed it into the parchment. The ring glowed and when he pulled the ring away there was a mark.
“They’ll need proof. And they should give you a free blood reading of your family tree and see if you are in direct line for my vaults.”
Harry helped when he could and with the two of them they got the smell under control in just a couple of minute.
“EMANCIPATED?” She shouted and glared at the people who glaced their way, her face getting meaner until the patrons looked away. Mrs. Weasley took a deep breath and she grabbed Harry’s hands, “I should’ve known that Tournament wouldn’t have finished with you when it ended. There so much- oh but that’s not why I’m here… we have to get back! Something dangerous has happened and we have to re-establish some magical protections! Harry, please come with us- I don’t want you going off again and getting hurt.”
Hendret rose an eyebrow, “On larger contracts such as marriage contracts and birth certificates for your brood it will require the marks of all your rings for there to be full magical validity.”
“Yeah! Him, he was our year at school with me and the other lot. He was always claiming we never included him in anything like pranks so…” Sirius shrugged and had a lofty chuckle, walking over to his desk, “Let’s just say Frank never complained after that.”
to their position. When they turn 17 the law recognizes their position as an adult. There was a whole thing that happened a couple of centuries ago with an old blood family was like, a 12-year-old tried to vote for something and it causes d a lot of trouble.”
Adafrid must have been very wealthy for all of these statues, especially all the snake motifs. Hopefully the house itself wasn’t too pretentious.
He moved his hand in the familiar shape, “Scourgify.” He incanted and a flash of yellow popped from his wand and spread out over the table in a line of yellow the dust was being eaten away by the spell. In less than a few seconds the wood, which had been caked in dust, shined with a new polish. Harry was a little slack-jawed and where there was a bit of a knot of anxiety, that he hadn’t he known he had, that loosened.
“It’s your portkey.” Sirius supplied and pulled on a chain pulling his own pendant out, “Adafrid let me make two of them. To activate you grasp the pendant so all of it is covered from the light and recit: Cedo nulli. It’s Adafrid’s Latin motto, it means ‘I yield to no one’ pretty fitting if you ask me.”
Sirius, as snuffles, nudged at Harry’s hand and he smiled down at Sirius and knelt onto the pavement.
“You can’t see a damn thing?” Sirius supplied and sat in the chair by his desk, “Yeah. Don’t worry there a much bigger version of the crest in the ‘family room’ a skull, some stars, an arm holding a saber…bird of some sort. All pretentious if you ask me.”
It was a few minutes before the blood clotted and he sighed getting up and going to the bathroom across the hall to clean up. He glanced over at the mirror knowing that a shadow would only remain. It was like Draco looked after because of the spell. Punished for being separated and rewarded for being close.
The further into the forest they walked the more Harry saw the cherub snake statues. None of them asked for an offering and none of them spoke to Harry. Which was fine with him, talking to more stone snakes wasn’t on his to do list and he didn’t want to be slowed down by talking to all of the statues.
Sirius rose his eyebrows and looked Harry up and down and his head tilted with his eyebrows raised like he was actually seeing
“They want the assets in that vault doing something other than gathering dust, Harry. If it isn’t complimentary, quote section 6 b in the Treasury Charters.”
Harry took a deep breath and waved the new wand gently, “Lumos.” And balls of light popped out of the end of the wand! They just floated and glowed happily like they were always meant to be there.
Harry laughed and nodded, “Understandable. How about I tell you about these fast-growing fruit trees that dobby bought for me over the summer.”
“Would you like a ‘perish not’ box sir? To put all your things in while you do your other shopping?” The dairy stall asked and he said
The place was still covered in dust, but the lights helped. Harry took a deep breath and he reached up to grab the silver lidded pot that was on the far left. Beside some photographs and other trinkets.
“I’ve been safe, and you lot? Ron told me you’ve been off cleaning some secret project. Am I allowed to know now?”
Hermione rolled her eyes and hugged him around his waist instead, “Why am I specifically not hugging your neck?”
The walk was leisurely and pleasant thanks to the shade of the trees. Harry also suspected it probably had something to do with the stone path. There were these circles carved into them looked exactly the same. Maybe Hermione would know what their purpose was meant for. Maybe he could send her a letter about it.
“Should be, the goblins said they would connect it back up with the system when I got my family rings.”
Harry didn’t think, he doesn’t remember moving but he does remember the crack of the impact of his fist on Dudley’s face. He remembers the silence of everyone and Dudley’s stunned expression afterward.
He shared. “My Aunt Agie got it for me, it’s a type of magical succulent, these leaves are round and full of a defensive sap to ward off predators.”
closed up the house. It hadn’t been quite 10 minutes yet, so everything was probably fine. He walked a little faster just in case.
The way Neville talked about this was sweet, he was gently tapping on the pot of the Mimbulus and shyly looking at Harry every once in a while.
Harry gulped, “Well. I uh, I don’t know a lot about *how* Voldemort came to power. I just know that he did. He also believed in divination, and there was a prophecy made about a child that could defeat him. He decided that was me.”
Partway through, Sidra got tired and Harry picked her up. He looked over at the main keep of the castle. The stone setup of the building made him a little wistful for Hogwarts. The structures had similar drum towers that Hogwarts had and honestly Harry hadn’t ever been to a proper castle before then. Harry wondered how much work actually went into upkeeping this place, especially with no magic.  This would make for a great Muggle Studies field trip. He might suggest it to the professor when he got back in September.
Harry’s heart was in his throat and his stomach in his vision became red. He crumpled the letter and he stomped up the stairs and he tore it to pieces before letting them fall into his pitiful cracked rubbish bin. His breathing was hard and he wanted to yell to kick and scream. He finally had something good in his life and already people were trying to take it away from him!
Harry sighed and got up, “I don’t want to deal with this. I’m going back, Aunt Petunia wanted me to cook supper.”
“Yeah, that’s me thank you for uh, taking your time for helping me.” Harry held out a hand and the Goblin stared at it, rose an eyebrow before reaching out his own hand which was also wrinkled, but mores o than Jortook’s, and shook Harry’s hand once.
She slithered into place and they headed out. The chickens clucked contented to roam about the yard. Harry walked over to the chicken feed and threw out a few hand fulls over the grass for them to find.
Harry gulped and gingerly set the wand back down. The memories of second year crawling under his skin.
Harry looked at Sidra, and Sidra nodded back. “I think that’s all. Now uh, I think I need to make a withdrawl. From my trust fund.”
“Alright Hedwig I’ll write up my responses. Don’t bother the hens okay? I don’t think they’ve forgiven me for the last time.”
Adafrid smiled gently, “It’s of no trouble to me Mr. Potter. I’ve been alone here with my books and an empty house for many years. Having a guest is a much-needed reprieve. Dust bunnies do not make good conversationalists.”
On the yard in front was a pile of garbage, which included in a broken and quite damp looking Vanity, there were other kinds of trash, picture frames and an assortment of moth-eaten clothing.
Neither Ron nor Hermione had responded to any of his letters. So, sending any more wouldn’t be worth it. Not that he had Hedwig anyway.
“Now, place the ring, seal side down, on your thumb print. If there is a genetic match, then the proper name or names will glow gold.”
Even in the blistering heat people seemed to be enjoying themselves, which was a lot better than the sullen wilted messes that Privet Drive would leave behind. Seeing the laughing kids and smiling adults and water being freely exchanged was a nice change of pace.
they had fish stands! He Grabbed three potatoes at one stand, oil at another. He bought half a pound of ground poultry some rice, and even grabbed some extra butter.
“Madame Black adored the brackled yew vanity, and it is GONE from her room!” The greying elf wailed and Sirius sighed.
Harry smiled wryly, “The place I have isn’t without its own ghosts, well, metaphorically. The owner of the house had a painting of himself set up. He isn’t loud or particularly harsh. He’s actually quite…nice. If not for him I would still be wearing oversized rags.”
The next hour or two was spent with him and Neville talking about the different plants in their garden, the different amounts of care and the mis-adventures with weeding and de-knoming.
The washroom was just as small as you’d imagine it would be on a train, but it wasn’t that bad. It gave him enough privacy to plug the sink and put warm water in the basin and Sidra slid into it with a satisfied hiss.
This information didn’t comfort Hermione, “I don’t understand did we learn this in history? Did I miss this information?”
done. But it wasn't like he could send Hedwig or Sidra out to do it. And he couldn't just snap his fingers to summon food either.
Harry and Sirius hashed out further details and eventually, they came to a good ‘contract’ for the oath.
He tried to move past them but Dudley pushed him back, “Oi! Don’t you try and piss around and slink out of the way- you’ve been acting freakish. Crying about at night at all hours. ‘Cedric not Cedric’” Dudley whimpered contorting his face into a frown and fake crying with snivelling noises. Wipping away fake tears.
“This was a ring commissioned to us quite recently within the last 200 years. My studies are of older specimens. However, if I could take a gander, then I would say it would be because over the years snakes have been vilified, and the customer wanted imagery of peace, if you notice the snake is standing sentinel in the hand of a cherub and is not aggressive.”
Sirius, again, motioned for him not to worry, “Honestly, it’s nothing important. You might get some invitations for galas and balls and charities but it’s not like the old days where you had to collect taxes and build orphanages after a war.”
Sidra squeezed gently on his arm and he allowed that comfort to soothe his ego. He wasn’t alone, she could help. So he forced his muscles to relax and looked around for something to focus on. His eyes glanced over the bark of the trees and away from the entrance to Surrey. He settled back onto Sidra and her twinkling scales, her body expanding with her gentle breaths, the soothing weight on his arm.
Sirius pet each of the girls and despite Sirius being a dog animagus (or maybe that was a point in his favor) they all flocked around him for attention.
He closed the bathroom door behind him. Someone laughed a little ways down the corridor and Harry’s blood went cold. There was only one person who laughed like that. Malfoy looked just as tall as he had in Diagon Alley, but he was in his school cloak this time and he was wearing an ugly smile. On his cloak was a prefect badge.
the words there wasn’t anything he could do to fix it. He was alone with an extended family that hated him with locks on his doors and a cat flap to feed him.
Specifically, Trevor had decided he didn’t want to be under Neville’s robe anymore and hopped out and onto the first thing that he saw.
Adafrid looked Harry over. And shook his head, “This is no way for a guest in my home to dress! My Grandmother is probably rolling in her grave. Please, have a look at my things in the storeroom. There should be a chest near a standing mirror with some of my other lounging clothes and shoes.”
He looked around the kitchen and a-ha! A spoon should do. He placed it on the freshly cleaned table nearby and grinned, “
Sirius nodded and disappeared into the library. It had only just occurred to Harry the possible dangers of an open flame in a library, but Sidra would’ve told him if there was danger and the wards seemed pretty calm in the back of his mind so he was sure everything was going to be okay.
Sidra hummed and lifted her head from her coils looking him over and she bobbed her head in approval.
Harry nodded and he went to his trunk to fish out paper or parchment and he grabbed one of his few ballpoint pens and wrote down a list:
Harry comes back to the room with aching thighs and his breathing even. He puts the cleaned razor away and he gently got into bed. Sidra crawled onto him. He adjusted himself on his back and Sidra watched him with her large unblinking eyes.
Harry kept an eye out and eventually found the statue that Sidra had mentioned. The cherub was holding a snake in its hand, and the snake looked like it was keeping careful watch for something. The muggles didn’t seem to be too concerned with it, passing it by as though…they didn’t even see it at all.
“What’s that, Harry?” Ginny asked and Harry looked back over at her and he motioned to the hairless horse.
The ride was quiet but not uncomfortable, and when they got off Harry got a look at the café. It didn’t look corporate, and there were a couple people talking over their coffee outside its doors. Harry almost wanted to take a look inside, but when the bus was out of sight Mrs. Weasley turned a little more serious and any thought of exploring flew out the window.
“Damn! What I would give to get away from this place.” Sirius professed, “I hate this place. It’s cramped, dark, and damp. So
“Yeah, not the prettiest of sights. The black family made it a point of either honor or fear for our elves. The longer the life the more ‘status’ they had. When the blacks had multiple elves this was used as a manner of…motivation. Don’t disappoint us and you’ll live longer than some. If you notice, the longer-lived elves are marked with gold, the shorter ones with black, and average with bronze. As soon as we’re done cleaning up the room
Harry stepped outside and he looked around for Hedwig, she was up in one of the oak trees by the house and Harry held up an arm for her to land on.
He woke up the next morning to a car door slamming. The front door slammed and large harsh footsteps marched their way up the stairs.
Harry was busy inside dusting and cleaning everything inside and cleaning his bedroom. The master Bedroom to be exact. Which freaked Harry out to no end but Adafrid was insistent.
He wasn’t sure how he to release the magic, but if it was a kind of physical force…. He imagined his magic like a cannon of air, pulling back and loading the weapon, and pretended that his magic was the bearing ball, what came was a gust, the trees swayed and his hair got into his eyes. Sidra was cackling head up in the air feeling the wind across her…sclaes?
It wasn’t a very long form, and it wasn’t too awful to figure out what it was about. It was partly a waver disclosure saying that if anything bad happened to anything or anyone on the property got hurt it wasn’t their fault. But that fidelius was probably old and surely Sirius would tell him if he were staying there…
Thankfully Molly drew the circle for herself reciting the same spell that Sirius had spoken earlier.
“I was asking him about high society wizard stuff. I got magically emancipated by the tournament and now I have all sort of responsibilities connected with the family rings.”
His eyes were half-lidded as he breathed, the thoughts running at a thousand miles an hour the world around him a blur as he placed the fresh razor at his thigh and he cut. Multiple shallow cuts. The blood dripped thinly and he watched it flow feeling the sting and feeling calmer.
Harry, who had been absorbed by the complications of his dill seed question, looked up and saw Adafrid with a knitted brow and standing up.
Sidra hissed in her own amused fashion, her breaths coming in and out a few times and she pulled her head up to get a better look at Harry,
Dobby noded eagerly his ears flapping wildly, “Yes mister potter, yes! All have been gotten and more! A much-needed house warming gift for Mister Harry Potter in Mister Harry Potter’s new home! A very clever place. Very well hidden! Dobby will help put these things away!”
Harry folded the parchments up and placed them back in the envelope Hermione had sent. He walked back to the living area and Hedwig was waiting and Harry offered her the letter.
Sidra hissed softly with pleasure and slithered her way onto his arm, and she did that thing that made his magic just sing and he took a deep breath in and smelled the hot concrete and car fumes from the road. He felt the sun on the back of his neck, and he visualized a little bubble around the four of them. A walking little cloud of ‘notice me not’ and the magic easily gathered, and with a small shake of his hand he released the magic with a mutter of the confundus spell and the bubble snapped into place and the people around then naturally avoided them their gazes drifting away.
Their excitement grew and they flocked to the area and began foraging for the feed. Right, he should grab the eggs from the coops before they went back inside. He grabbed the basket and one nest as a time levitated the eggs into the basket.
“It accepts you as the head of the Black family. If it hadn’t it would’ve thrown itself across the room. The one thing you’ll learn about the Blacks is that we’re pretentious and tradition is more important than sense, the good thing is that most of the family is now driving the afterlife insane.”
“New Blood.” He corrected with a nod of his head, “That is why you cannot see your non-magical family. That is a different ancestry test.”
Of course, occasionally, when Uncle Vernon needed to get a deal locked down, they would go to church on Sundays for about a month and a half but that’s as religious as things got.
Sirius patted Harry’s back, “That’s the spirit! Now, let’s see what other hoops I have to jump through, hm?”
“Huh.” She mumbled and reached for another cookie, “How much power exactly do these old families have?”
“Yes, in ancient times, the Potter family were Lords over many farms. There are three to signify the unity with their land. If you also notice the lion is not centered. They valued themselves to be a family of the people.”
That is, until someone bumped into him. Harry tripped over his own feet and he braced himself to fall onto the pavement, but no contact came. Harry opened his eyes and he looked up into the eyes of- of-
“Mister Harry Potter sir!” Dobby called out from the main space of the house. Which startled Harry out of his concentration. The spoon clattered onto the table and Harry turned on his heel to head back to Dobby.
“Malfoy?” He asked aloud and Draco- no- Malfoy looked back and the soft eyes turned hard and Harry was pulled back up.
hurt!” Petunia cried, handing her son a rubbish bin which Dudley used to his advantage to empty his stomach. Harry quietly thanked his cousin for giving him the mercy of not puking on him.
Luna nodded, “Those who have natural born abilities to speak with animals are rare. And a snake of this magical caliber even rarer. You two seem to be a perfect match!”
Harry was going to say something more, but Hermione gasped, starring at her watch, “Oh no! We’re almost late to getting to the Prefect meeting! Sorry Harry, I wish we could talk more but-“
piece of bacon and use no more than two tablespoons of syrup. Finish before Vernon and Dudley wake up.”
Hendret inclined his head, “A valuable question. It is a simple answer: your family name is Potter, that is who you were born as. The Gaunt ring, while connected to you by blood, is more distant contractually speaking. The same will apply to the Black ring once retrieved.”
“What kinds of creature are these? Are they cousins to the pegasus?” Harry asked walking to the front of the carriage to look at one of these creatures a little better.
They discussed the details and how the Fidelus was going to work, and really It was all simple. They stood inside the circle, and they each recited their part of the spell, and a circle started to glow, and then when each of them finished their part of the spell, Molly would cast a deosil circle to symbolize and activate sun magic to protect the house from view, and since Harry was stronger with the moon so he cast widdershins to invoke the moon and use the rays of the moon to cast a ‘shadow’ upon the house to conceal it from prying eyes.
All of them looked old, but none of them moved. There was Adafrid, of course, and two women. Well, one women and one girl. He frowned as he took the pot down, and took the lid off, grabbing a decent amount of the powder.
Jortook nodded, “Oh yes, quite a shame really. But when you’re raised with the idea that your boogeyman of the afterlife can possess any animal to sway your soul to damnation I can’t say I blame them.”
Harry hummed to himself looking it over and checking the dates. It should be fine if he went the week before…if not he could owl order what he hadn’t gotten while he was out.
Like Filch. He almost felt pity. Mrs. Figg wasn't the most pleasnt around with all her pets and smelly house but she at least was more decent a person than Filch.
He loaded up on the train and started looking for everyone. He saw plenty of firsties and second years. He saw Fred and George chatting up people and he was just over halfway through the train when he finally found his own group. Neville, Hermione, and Ron were in the same compartment chatting and it was just sunny enough to glint off of their prefect badges.
Sidra hissed agreeably and Harry set to work to inform his friends that Yes, he was safe but he felt like he needed some alone time and that later in the summer he would reach out again about meeting up at Diagon Alley. He added in his response to Ron that Harry’s own ‘secret get-away’ still had plenty of chores due to unforeseen circumstances, but he would definitely help Ron on the train with his homework since he had decided to get that done early.
Adafrid sat up just a little straighter, “Dementors? I hope you two weren’t footling about near Azkaban. Dementors are supremely territorial. However, I suppose no one is quite sure how they reproduce-“
“Alright, this might take the wind out of me without a wand, but here goes nothing.” Sirius took a breath and recited a spell, it was in Latin and it wasn’t very long, but he made a circle with his pointer finger and created a ring of light just below his chest.
Sirius hummed and nodded tapping his chin for a second and snapped his fingers his eyes lighting up with an idea. He crouched down and picked up a rock, “Think transfiguration will do the trick?” Harry shrugged and looked at the snake for approval.
Harry had known about talking portraits but for some reason it felt more than a little unnerving knowing that the actual person of Adafrid was dead and this was some sort of magical reflection. He was currently in the house of a dead man. But weirder thing had happened hadn't it?
There was a chime and Harry frowned, looking towards the sound and one of the side windows opened and in came- Hedwig?
“We had a disagreement.” Harry supplies, “There was an accident that wasn’t my fault, that they thought
Harry’s heart spiked in speed and he managed to fling himself out of bed and backed up against the window. The door slammed open with Vernon’s purple face.
“You’ve managed to find yourself a well protected area. I can’t remember the last time I had to offer a piece of magic to an unplottable guardian.”
Harry cocked his head and finished with the lacing and looked up at Adafrid, “Sure, what sort of errand?”
Kreature?” Sirius shouted at possibly the oldest thing Harry had ever seen. He was wearing a thin flour sack, there were hanging stretches of skin coming off his bones and one of his ears looked like someone had constantly used it for stabbing practice.
He washed his dishes and managed to put them up before Vernon came lumbering down and he helped his Aunt set the table.
Sirius nodded, and he took a breath to speak. The words caught in his throat and he looked from Harry to Sidra and back again and he rubbed his face.
material discussing any of these details. It almost felt like one fool wrote the bare bones of the culture and didn’t think that maybe, just maybe, making a system to teach him how the culture works his life might be a little easier. But no, he had to play the dumb kid trying to figure life out through trial and error. And if he died? Who cares! At least it would be
Sirius came over and wrapped Harry in a hug, “You’re just happy I’m not harping about- ‘the importance of blood family’, right? I couldn’t help you before, and I am so proud of you for taking control and finding a place away from those muggles. And now? Now I’m going to help you stay safe. From muggles and dark lords alike.”
The next few days were quite peaceful. He told Sirius about the Chicken’s routine and talking with Adafrid about the house, or listening to him and Sidra reminisce on some old memories they had.
The train reached the station in Hogsmeade and Harry was very much relaxed as he spoke with Neville, Ginny, and Luna.
Harry couldn’t help the smile he got with Ron’s letter and he folded them up and put them in his pocket.
Harry hummed at that and as they got closer the amount of people around got a little thicker. He managed to get to the gardens a little surprised about how well the gardens were being upkept but kept moving forward giving occasionally looking at the flowers and cropped hedges.
Harry shook his head, “No. Uhm, here’s the family ring?” Harry held up a shaky hand and steadied it with his right hand so the Goblin could take a look.
Ron turned right back around his face flaming red and he pointed a finger at harry and jabbed it in his direction, “Don’t. Start.” Before deflating and turning around, “This is going to be the worst year yet.”
Get the floo dust, toss it in, say the name. If it lights up, Good! Nothing: Bad. He could do this. It wasn’t like he was being asked to walk
Two wands who accepted him and one of them wasn’t attached to a homicidal maniac! Instead it was attached to someone Sidra cared about deeply. And they were in his house. A house that…had let him in because his magic tasted like ‘founders magic’.
The goblin looked him over and looked slightly interested, “And do you have a particular family in mind you are wishing to confirm? Because you are mister Harry Potter, no? Have you lost…access to your vaults?”
This place wasn’t going to disappear when he went to Hogwarts, he could still feel the wards in the back of his mind. He took a deep breath and shut the latches to his trunk. Tomorrow was a brand new day, and he was going to face it head on.
“Let’s give this a go then, huh?” And he pointed the wand at the wooden dining room table under Hedwig’s watchful eyes.
Ron nodded and swallowed his own mouthful of food, “Bill won’t get the family ring till Dad’s ready to step away from that stuff. It can be more than a little annoying with all the politics. When you become of age in 7
in sweat. A morning shower was definitely in order, especially since his head was pounding so viciously.
Sidra was wrapped around his shoulders and Sirius was stretching. “I’m going to have to go through in my animagus form, but it shouldn’t look too odd. As long as your familiar stays hidden that is.”
He stopped reading at halfway through the second principle feeling the stuff in his stomach sloshing back and forth uncomfortably. Looking out the window helped but it wasn’t much better. He could see trees, so they must be getting close.
Harry looked over the tunics and waist coats that he had to choose from. Cream tunic with dark blue waist coat? Yeah, that sounded like a good combo. Harry smiled and got dressed.
It was comforting, if only to an extent, but he looked at the wand. Adafrid’s wand. A wizards wand long since passed.
It was just as bumpy during the day at it was at night. This difference was that it wasn't as packed with beds on wheels. Those were stored elsewhere or transfigured into the booth seats that Harry was sitting in.
Ginny’s eyes were wide, but not in a way people usually react to snakes. One time Aunt Petunia had seen a garden snake and she had nearly fainted from fright. Her eyes were wide and bugged out of her head so much Harry thought that they might pop. Ginny’s eyes, instead, were wide in a way that he’d seen Aunt Petunia look at Dudley (such as the time when Dudley was Nine and was forced to wear a sailor suit for a photo session).
The waistcoats on the top of its stack had silver buttons on it, and Harry looked it over before picking up the trousers. The pair on top was black and smooth to the touch. They seemed a bit looser than he figured they would be. However, the fashion sense seemed to be more in line with what people wore in Diagon Alley.
Sidra hissed in reluctant agreement and they continued down their way. Dudley kept mumbling and Harry assured him it was going to be fine. He had to keep up the charade that he knew that everything was going to be okay because if it dropped for even a moment his Aunt and Uncle were going to
That stopped the both of them in their tracks and they turned to look at Harry their faces twisted in disgust and readying to correct him, but they stopped both of their eyes widening just a little at seeing what he was wearing. They synchronous actions were a bit barmy but sweet none-the-less. Both grinned and Hermione squealed and attempted to hug the life out of Harry.
Diagon Alley was the same as it usually was, but this time around the energy was different. In the way that no one was looking at Harry. Everyone went about their day without even giving him a second glance and he smiled.
the roost the climb up into the orange tree nearby and build a nest.She wasn’t very skilled at it so her first set of eggs landed on my
Harry swallowed thickly and tried to keep moving forward and be unnoticed; however, he seemed to be a magnet for trouble today, because Malfoy
“Mostly they’re contained in the North Sea with Azkaban.” Adafrid stood up and paced his frame, “And no authorities were on it’s tail?”
Harry took a sharp inhale of breath. He squeezed his eyes shut when they started to burn. He Took a deeper breath and let it out slow. When Harry opened his eyes, Sidra was looking at him, expectantly but with no judgment.
He forced himself out of bed and shuffled his way to the kitchen. He grabbed a slice of bread, poured some orange juice, and through the power of wheat and calories he tried to make himself less tired. He didn’t have time to lay around all day and wait for the sensation to pass.  He had to feed his chickens, pick whatever mystery fruits that had grown last night.
Okay, so it was probably a snake of some sort. The hiss was a higher pitch when translated in Harry's ear. It was very different from the lower tones of the snake from the zoo, and a much gentler hiss compared to the starving basilisk from the second year.
His breath caught in his throat. Sirius liked that Harry had a place to stay, got along with Harry’s chickens, and Sirius wanted Harry to be able to come
His breath caught in his throat and Sidra hissed, but it was low, and soothing and she bobbed her head.
Adafrid’s shoulders relaxed and he bowed his thanks to Harry and Harry made his exit with a heavy sigh. It would be rude to not at least look at what Adafrid had to offer. He headed upstairs to the storeroom. (TK check house dimensions) From the outside you would never guess this place had an upstairs but there was magic
He dug out his transfiguration book and started re-reading the section on 7 main Principles which was boring but familiar and something to do.
Harry gets on the train to Hogwarts! Featured participants are: Trevor 'chaos toad'. Oh, as well as others. Such as Luna.
“Careful, Sidra’s ego is being fueled,” Harry responded with a shaky chuckle and Jortook smiled, exposing sharp teeth.
But before she could finish there was a shout of a spell and the curtains were closed, muffling her screeching, and wailing.
“Hey,” Sirius asked after just a minute or two, “You think I could pop over and feed the chickens some time? Much better than babysitting Turkish pixies.”
“It’s quite inflamed.” Adafrid pointed out, “I’m certain that it was given to you by this, Voldemort you mentioned?”
Adafrid looked firm, “Please. I have no use for those items anymore; and if they can assist you, then I am more than willing to give you my own ‘hand-me-downs’
“I suppose so,” Hermione frowned, looking Harry up and down and tugged at one of his shirt sleeves, “Aside from that, what’s with the outfit?”
Neville perked but shook his head, “Sorry, but the Mimbulus might get caught in the crossfire and…well, better safe than sorry.”
“I’ll tell you about my day tomorrow, oh, and we’ll be having a guest.” He said and Adafrid nodded in his chair.
“Hey! This snake’s been giving me the stink eye since I got here, and it looks like you came out from a bunch a hedges.”
“This is a little too public to talk about. Why not come back with us? Mrs. Weasley knows the way, and she’s almost done with the shopping.”
His hand trembled a little and he lifted his right hand, his free hand, and he pressed the knob down revealing the room inside. It had two sides it both had cabinets built into the walls and it was all made from a warm toned wood, at the back was a window that outlook some of the property. Three window panes at the back, they looked like they could swing open but there were vines over the windows keeping them sealed shut.
Harry hummed in agreements and closed his eyes, and he didn’t see the shinning magic that made a thread between himself and Sidra. The moon seemed to glow a little brighter for just a moment, but it was about to set anyway…so maybe that had something to do with it.
Adafrid waved off the commet, “Your worry has value if you used your school wand. However, my commissioned wand has taken a liking to you. I’m sure it would take great joy in being used.”
“Say that again. Say that again after all my godson has done and been through I dare you-“ Harry shoved his way in between the two of them.
“All necessities for Mister Harry Potter! Chicken for laying eggs, a self-building coop for the chickens! Grow Fast fruit tree seeds! Oh oh oh and the most wonderful! A Forever Cooling Box!!”
He took a closer look and was met with the familiar sight of a cherub holding a snake etched onto a silver pendant. It’s magic pusled for a moment before calming down and settling into a small hum. It was about the size of a galleon and was attached to an equally silver chain.
Harry nodded and he looked around the house. It was very dirty. He sighed and headed back to the library.
He didn’t look entirely happy about that, “Do you feel that way about your brother? According to the Goblin he left everything to you if anything happened to him.”
It was the night before when he was packing up his things that he realized that he…was actually going to miss being here. He had double checked all of his summer homework to be sure it was in his trunk, he had packed up his clothes and none of it was ragged or faded.
When they saw that Harry was the only thing keeping Dudley up on his two feet both of them turned white as sheets and Pentunia cried out and Harry handed off his cousin to more caring hands.
Sure enough, Sirius was waiting by the first gate of the entrance. He wasn’t in his snuffles form but the long coat he was wearing didn’t look too strange. Aside from looking the statue up and down far too seriously.
“Who you talking to Potter?” Came Dudley’s lumbering slurs, probably affected by the heat and he was flanked by other kids from the neighborhood.
Hello everyone! This chapter is a little shorter, but it works better with the flow of how I want everything to go.
“Alright, follow me. Blend in and try to look native.” She said and Harry had to bite back a bit of a laugh. With her blazing orange hand knitted cardigan blending in wasn’t something could possibly be done.  However… the sun was burning pretty hot, and there was a slight breeze. Maybe he could make them a magical ‘cloud’ of sorts to hide them from the muggle. A…walking confundus bubble! There, he had an actual spell to work from. Now he just had to work with ‘sky’ and ‘sun’.
Harry and Sirius passed through the floo and it was as crazy as every parents shouting at their kids and kids shouting with their friends, owls on carts and cats weaving their way through people’s feet.
They approached the property and Harry felt a mental change in the back of his mind where the wards had connected with him. It was like a tensing muscle in the back of his head, and in the distance he could see the wards, awake and barring any stranger from. He felt on edge from this new situation. What could he expect from the wards? He certainly didn’t know what to do if the wards
She twittered and flew up onto the bird mount that he had pulled out from the closet. (which was bigger on the inside to his astonishment and delight!) Sidra was curled up on a rock in one of the windows.
His voice was soft and cultured. Like something out of a period film. However, unlike actors pretending authenticity. This was entirely authentic.
“What happened!” Vernon demanded getting up and in Harry’s face, Vernon’s face was quickly changing color.
Having good days was nice, and he had been having really nice days with Sidra around. But no matter how much magic you had or what friends you could confide in nightmares still came.
Harry’s quickly strode up the stairs and he started collecting his things as quickly as he could. The things in his floorboard the little amounts of muggle clothes he had. His wand. He had everything he needed and he skipped steps on the way down to gather his trunk and owl cage for Hedwig.
“It means that an orphan has the right to know where he comes from. Goblin kind never leaves one another on the street penniless if they can help it. It’s who they are.”
Hermione gave him a look, but apparently it wasn’t important enough to pry, “We were extremely worried about you, Harry! Where have you been!” She slapped his arm and Harry tried his best not to flinch. He wasn’t sure he succeeded.
she has a perfectly acceptable recreation of that damn thing in her painting! SHE ISN’T GOING TO MISS IT!” He shouted and the elf looked sourly back at Sirius.
and Harry’s sort of calm stomach dropped to his shoes. That was the mail flap. He sucked in a break and slowly headed down the hallway, slowly making his way and hoping it was the wind that caused the noise but no. On the welcome mat, there was a cream envelope with a familiar wax seal on it. He picked it up with trembling hands.
Luna smiled and looked directly at Sidra, “Why thank you, you’re a very complimentary individual yourself.”
Good to know, so he kept pushing one leg in front of the other. At some point, everyone else was going to give up but Dudley was much more stubborn, and he had Piers to act as moral support and an ego booster. It was rapidly getting darker and he was getting further away from the suburb.
Sidra was curled pleasantly around Harry. She brought her head up next to Harry's cheek and flicked her tongue out to smell him,
Harry hummed and swallowed back the bile. There was a wailing growling sound when they got to the top of the stairs and Sirius sighed.
“Indeed, and these are your keys. The trust vault, the Potter vault, the Gaunt vault, and the Black vault. Would you like me to reinstate your floo network at the Gaunt Manor as well?”
“TRAITORS!” A woman screamed with vitriol, “MUDBLOODS AND BLOODTRAITORS IN MY OWN HOME. AS THE MATRIARCH OF THE BLACK FAMILY I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS DISGRACEFUL- DIGUSTING- CURSE YOU ALL FOR DESICRATING-“
There was a tunnel up ahead that he knew that if he could get on the other side he could find a few hiding spots. Harry could see the end, slipping away was just within his reach but his foot caught on something and he fell, he tried to not hurt Sidra but she was flung off him with the force of it and it wasn’t nearly long enough for Harry to recover when he heard the heavy steps of Dudley behind him.
“You are the master of the house now, the wards have long accepted you as the new owner. The wards are very special and seldom ever make a wrong decision.”
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were sitting in the living room and they didn’t look happy. Aunt Petunia’s face was pinched in a way that Harry knew wasn’t about him, and Uncle Vernon looked uninterested in general and was probably only awake for Petunia.
Something like this felt forbidden, reaching for the doorknob and turning it, opening up the house to the darkness outside. It was cooler that night, and there were no clouds to cover the stars or the moon. It was nice. He took a deep breath and stepped out, closing the door behind him. He could’ve turned to cross Ms. Figg’s house but he didn’t feel like going deeper into the suburb. So he turned the other way to the sparse forest on the edge.
“It isn’t a secret anyway- What I told the painting is true. I’m here for the Black family ring! I own this place and in order for the ownership to be passed to me I had to get that stupid charm off of it in order to claim-“
Harry had no idea how he was going to sneak a snake into the Dursley household. The sun was close to rising and he needed to get back before anyone woke up.
him. Or worse. He shivered. Being stuck in his room with the cat flap as his only means of getting food was not a life he wanted to go back to.
Vernon grabbed harry by the collar of his shirt and dragged him down the stairs and threw Harry down the last couple. He didn’t fall but his ankle twisted in a god awful way.
His breath was coming short. His thoughts coming too quickly to make sense of much of anything other than the main goal: get out of the house as quickly as possible.
Sidra bobbed her head sadly and placed her head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry smiled at her, and gently pet her. “
for the first time. “Sounds like a hell of a guy. But doesn’t he have children or something to give clothes to?”
“Yeah.” Harry insists and even reach up to pet the horse and it snorted indifferently at his touch. “They’re right here large and have wings like a bat.”
“You think you could run from me? You’ve got another thing coming, Freak!” His breathing was hard and his steps were slower since he thought he had the advantage.
Harry grunted and held out his hand and Hendret took his and gently and examine the small wound and then muttered a spell, but the syllables weren’t the one he remembered for the usual healing spell, but it seemed to work the same regardless because his thumb was didn’t radiate pain from the pinpoint prick and Hendret brought out a handkerchief and wiped the excess blood away.
“Very good.” Hendret said and he pressed his own ring into one of the pieces of paper in the file before shuffling through the other pieces of parchment his eyes gliding over the words, “Referencing your files again, one Regulus black left the Black name and assets to one Sirius black, and considering he is a condemned criminal in the eyes of the ministry, all possessions were then given to his heir, whom he named as the heir to James Potter. That would be you.”
Which was mostly the problem. He would be having a much easier time navigating the wizarding world if there had been
Dudley was screaming and the Dementor leaning in, soaking up the fear, drowning out any happiness in his cousin. Harry’s heart was pounding and needed to act NOW. But he didn’t have his wand, he couldn’t even cast a Patronus!
Gringotts was always a strange place to Harry, the Goblins, the people talking and whispering quietly or nervously. The vast space inside and how footsteps echoed almost endlessly.
Sidra hissed softly and Harry pressed his lips together. Harry reached up and pet Sidra so she went ahead and dropped her illusion and
“For the last time it was molding, the mirror was cursed and removed before she was born, and she is
The way she hissed and her tensed up body it was so strange to see and Harry felt compelled to follow her command and picked it up. While his hand was close to the desk she climbed up his arm, but in a way that made it look like she wasn’t really crawling onto
time?” Ginny and Harry cajole at the same time. Luna giggles as she boards, and the carriage starts heading up to the castle.
Sidra coughed and hissed and Harry choked on his laugh with cough and there was a knock on the door.
The snake hissed with pride, slithering up Harry and curling the upper half around his neck and curling the lower half around his arm.
Harry nodded and ensured that there was a circle on the bottom right of the tapestry and , yes, there it was. Written in gold ink? Or perhaps liquid gold? Not important. Harry picked up the needle in his right hand and he took a deep breath. This couldn’t be worse than the time his whole arm’s bone structure had to be regrown! And he stuck the needle in his thumb. It started bleeding straight away and Harry rushed to get it pressed in the circle and a bloody thumb print was left behind, it soaked into the paper and the red of his print turned into silver and names started popping up on the cloth and spread upwards and upwards.
” Harry turns to Sirius, “She wants to ensure my safety as well as the safety of her previous companion. If you give away the location of where I’m saying, you’ll forget before you even finish saying it.”
Sidra teased softly and Harry approached the head teller. He looked unhappy staring at his paperwork as he did the last time he was here. Harry approach none-the-less.
He could hear Dudley and his gang lumbering behind him, but he knew with experience he could out run Dudley and Piers, but the rest of the gang? He had no idea, all he could do was keep on going. Get away- far away so he wouldn’t get his face smashed in.
Harry nodded and slid it onto his right hand, placing it on his pinky. The ring pulsed with magic and settled down. Sirius gave an audible sigh.
Harry was so glad that Dobby decided to stick around and help because in order to garden Harry needed a good chunk of these weeds gone, and Dobby was
“Going sight seeing then? I hear it’s beautiful this time of year.” It was stale small talk and Harry wasn’t sure if Stanley actually mean it but he finally pulled up the ticket.
He wasn’t alone in this he had to remind himself. Sirius would know what to do and if he didn’t, then Sidra could help. He took a deep breath and forced himself to relax. The final statue in front of the wards glowed a blue color and the Cherub moved this time with the snake.
He watched her breath, relaxing and feeling the tingle of the magic gather on his fingertips. He took another deep breath  and magic curled a little more around his fingers. With each deep breath magic curcled around his fingers.
” Sirius praised looking at the different pieces of furniture, “This guy must have had a hell of a fortune or a hell of a job to pay for all of this.”
“Okay, thanks!” Harry nodded. Jortook nodded and stepped back into the hall, the door closing behind her.
But all that came out was a wet huff of air. He nodded instead and tried to force himself large calming breaths focusing on her twinkling scale and breathing body. She settled herself on his lap after Harry untangled the sheets from his legs and straightened them out.
Diets and exercises have made Dudley mad with superiority, he’s gathered a group of cronies from practically three neighborhoods over in a gang, but at the center, it was Dudley and Piers wasn’t it? Couldn’t ever resist a game of
It was a young man. Older than Harry. Younger than Snape. His hair was fluffy and he was sitting in an armchair in a mirror image of the library. He wore a coat that had eight buttons keeping it shut in a grey fabric, he wasn’t wearing a hat and there was a crow on a stand.
Vernon grumbled and held his hand out for the cup of Coffee that Petunia was already handing him. Harry grabbed the trowel and the ratty gloves he was allowed to wear.
Harry unlatched the two pieces holding it closed and he lifted the lid. There was no smell of anything rotting or damp, nor did he get another strong wiff of dust. He took a better look inside and saw a few sets of clothing. Linen shirts on one side waist coats in the middle and trousers on the other side. Harry picked up the linen shirts and they felt…good. Not course and in far better condition than his own clothing.
The heat was absolutely retched, even as the sun was setting. All the little kids on the playground had gone home already, so a swing was open for him to get even a hint of a breeze. Occasionally he would curse the heat when he touched any of the metal he hadn't managed to shelter.
But this time it was Harry doing it all to himself; it wasn’t a spell making him do it he wanted this. He washed his hands and used toilet paper to clean up his thighs. He looked at the time and saw that it was just passed midnight. He could hear Dudley in his bedroom and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to be asleep. Which was unusual but suited Harry just fine. He quietly walked down the stairs and towards the front door.
“The oath is complete,” Sirius said with a smile, but the bags under his eyes looked a little deeper.
Sidra corrected, nudging her nose on Harry’s cheek and the light sensation tickled. He laughed and stroked a hand down her back.
“Yes, and it wasn’t an easy feat of magic.” Someone said behind Harry and he shouted, and he twisted around to see the intruder but there was no one. Aside, of course, from the painting beside the door, that harry hadn’t seen because the door had blocked it when he came inside.
Harry nodded and closed his eyes for a moment, visualizing the ‘cloud’ draping over the wards. He pushed his hands forward and the magic went with it, layering over the protections and seeping into it. Something snapped into place in the back of his mind and Harry yelped in surprise.
“Well, to start off I was placed with my muggle relatives. With no mentions of my magical heritage whatsoever. There was also the fact I wasn’t told my mother sacrificed herself for me until after I, uh…accidentally killed my defense professor- but in my defense he was trying to kill me first-“
The goblin was looking at one paper writing on another one, and when Harry approached he raised one wrinkled hand to signal to wait a moment and Harry nodded. The goblin finished writing and he looked over his glasses to Harry.
He wouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth and he graciously accepted the gift with thanks and he poured a small drizzle onto the cakes and gratefully ate the meal in less than five minutes.
“Alright, I figured out the food thing. Uh, do you have any rags I can use around here? I might as well get some of the dust off the tables and chairs?”
Mrs. Weasley obviously wanted to say no, judging by the defiant shine in her eye, and Harry honestly understood her feelings, but he wanted to keep what he had gained for himself.
The buzz that had once been soft came alive and burst across his hand and crawled up his arm. He held his breath and soon all of him was buzzing from head to foot until something clicked, and the gate swung inward silently.  And the house hidden behind the magic dispersed, revealing the house behind it.
Harry sighed and made his way back to the library. Hedwig decided to fly up to the mantle and she started preening. Sxz4e3
“I accept your word Sirius black.” Harry looked at the white ring and put his hand into it, and Sirius took his hand and shook, the wring expanded for a moment and split into two, wrapping one half around Harry’s wrist and a half around Sirius’s and then disappeared.
Harry turned around to leave, but Sidra didn’t climb onto him, she was twisted in an aggressive S shape starring at him from beside the wand.
Harry didn’t fully believe in murphy’s law. But Neville had a sort of bad luck around him that seemed to tempt fate.
Hendret nodded and went to one of the walls, He pressed his hand into one of the bricks and it pressed in and a larger part of the wall opened.
“I have to say,” Jortook spoke up, “It has been quite some time since I’ve seen a wizard or witch with such a strong bond with a familiar.”
Dobby snapped his fingers and the packages lifted up and bobbed their merry way into the kitchen. Dobby was humming tunelessly happier than Harry had
The air, which had been hot and all-consuming washed away in a gust. In the wake of the cold the lights of the tunnel burnt out one by one, followed by a miasma of dread. A feeling that settled low in the gut and refused to leave. Harry knew this feeling. He knew it well.
“Harry.” Someone said to him and someone sat next to him and placed a hand on his, “Harry, I see you have a new familiar. Is she shy? Is that why she’s hiding?”
“Well, it’s new to you. That’s all that really matters.” Sirius patted him on the back. “What’s the name of this place?”
“That’s even worse, Hermione!” Ron scolded and Hermione rolled her eyes, but there wasn’t really much malice.
Playful, affectionate. It was almost too similar to how Draco had been in fourth year. He sighed leaning back against his bed, staring at the ceiling and counting the cracks.
Both were ‘wells’ of magic… If he thought enough about it he could feel the familiar tingle of magic, but it was content to remain in its usual form, it wasn’t as willing to build up so he could use his own magic to attempt to make a breeze.
Harry wrinkled his nose at the smell and looked around and felt his lunch fight back. Lining the walls of the stairs leading up to the second level was plaque after plaque of heads, and there were
Adafrid noded, “That’s a legitimate concern, and one we will be discussing later, but the matter of sussetance is a tad more important as of the present moment. On the mantle in the main room should be a pot full of floo dust. Toss the dust and say ‘Pavia and Semer’s Tavern’ and a green flame should appear.”
“You speaking in tongues, freak? Finally, lost it have you? You gonna use your magic on me? We both know what’ll happen if you do that why I-“
Sidra didn’t seem convinced and the ride continued. Stanley did come by with some bottled water and crumpled muggle crisps. Harry did pay for them (not too badly price either to his surprise) and he started sipping and nibbling. Not too much because this was genuinely like sitting on a roller coaster and actually eating food under these conditions could possibly spell disaster that he definitely wanted to avoid.
Number 4 came into view and he looked back at the moon, the crescent shining in the cloudless sky. He nodded in its direction in thanks and headed inside readying himself for whatever was going to happen.
Harry shrugged, “Apparently one of my ancestors married into the Potter family, so…it survived, in a way.”
“My familiar is wrapped around there.” Not that Hermione could see Sidra with her using her invisibility magic.
It was no forbidden forest but it was preferable over the Acromantia, angry Centaurs and blast ended skrewts.  The forest itself was probably no more than an acre but it was peaceful. It was quiet and it wasn’t attacking him outright. The tree’s weren’t very tall and he could still clearly see the moon but if he angled himself just right he couldn’t see the suburb anymore.
“Merlin’s tits! What the bloody hell happened?” She asked squeezing her nose shut and branished her wand with a choked cleaning spell.
The snake finished after what felt like an hour. During that time harry had practiced a couple of other spells. Levitating a branch, making his palm glow with a Lumos. It was like having a part of himself back that had been locked away for too long.
Soon enough, Harry received a letter from McGonagall with the list for his new books and supplies for the new school year.
“Oi, you think you can talk to us like that Potter? Dudley here’s been the wrestling champ of Smelting’s two years running. I would watch your tone.”
He woke up with a shout, and sweat soaking into his bedsheet and singular blanket that was tangled around his legs.
“I do actually, I need to know a few things about this place, cause taking the Knight bus isn’t really safe, and if it’s as unplottable as I think…then I think I can make you a port key if you’re ever in danger.”
Harry held his breath for as long as he could waiting for the other shoe to drop. Aunt Petunia to come in and smack him with a frying pan or Vernon to come in and as a practice dummy for boxing.
He waved Harry off, “It’s the least I can do. You are my godson after all. Oh, and I managed to finish this for you, catch!” Sirius tossed something at Harry, and four years of learning to catch a small object took over and he caught the shinning object.
“Yeah! I’m not sorry. Got to prank Frank really good on the final night of third year, and Mother was
The snake hissed and slithered back onto Harry draping herself around his neck. He leaned back against the nearby tree.
And by girls he meant his chickens. They were free-range, sure, but they still needed a nutrition supplement every other day or so.
He looked over the list. Bread meat and some apples he could eat for a few days no problem. But he didn’t know where Dobby might go to get food. He's only left dobby instructions to get other items like milk eggs, flour, and butter if and only if Harry had enough left in his money stash. It wasn’t frivolous but it would keep him from going hungry it would give Harry enough time to figure out how to get more money. His vault? A job? Maybe he should ask Dobby to buy him rice instead of bread...it was looking more and more like he was going to have to go to Gringotts sooner rather than later...but he didn't have his
Mrs. Weasley smiled, but it was the sort of smile he assumed was one of those smiles that tried to pretend she wasn’t worried sick. Even after all the time he’s spent with this family he’s still uncertain how much concern she actually has for him, so he decided to continue.
“You were up there for a while, what were you talking about?” Hermione asked and Harry sat down next to her, across from Ron, he grabbed a chocolate biscuit to nibble on.
“Here we are, please step into the room Mister Potter.” Jortook said unlocking another door and Harry nodded in thanks before stepping through.
Despite Harry’s initial aversion the wand was quite friendly to hold, and patient as well. After Harry casting the Lumos it wasn’t too excited and didn’t seem insulted when Harry had tried to back away from it. It was like it was waiting.
“Thank you so much dobby. I’ll see you later.” Harry leaned down to hug Dobby, and he hugged back with a vigor.
Harry looked down and, yeah. He was wearing one of his older shirts. One where it was a 5xl, and it definitely looked like it was wanting to fall off at any moment.
There weren’t many images to represent whoever lived here, pictures, paintings or otherwise. However there were some nice paintings of scenery’s where the tree’s drifted in the wind or animals shifted in the frame.
Sidra hissed in agreement and Harry stroked down her back and he stood up. It turned out there was some baked lemon pepper fish and a bowl of wilted salad in the back that he remembered from about two weeks ago. He threw away the salad and looked for more leftovers and found a small helping of mashed potatoes. Alright, that would do it. He put them on a plate put the cover over it and placed it in the microwave and set the time too cook.
“Harry? What is it?” Mrs. Weasley cried coming over and steadying him. Harry shook his head and covered one of his eyes pressing the palm into the socket.
Afraid nodded, “I understand that, but I believe that there should be no trouble. You remember the wards?”
Sidra shouted. Harry turned and reached out for Sidra and she wrapped around his hand. With his outstretched hand and adrenaline, he could feel his fingers tingling and itching with magic. The moon wasn’t full, but he didn’t need it to be. Sidra was on his side, all he needed was a happy memory. Any memory He closed his eyes and searched his thoughts.
“All we have to do is put up some wards and have a chat, then you can go about your way, dear.” Mrs. Weasley assured and all of them headed out to the muggle side of the leaky cauldron to get on the knight bus. Mrs. Weasley gave Stan (was there seriously only one Knight Bus?) An address to drive to, and it was some café.
