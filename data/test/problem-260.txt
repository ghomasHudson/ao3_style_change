Hermione leaves for her business trip, telling Ronald that she will video chat with him tomorrow. She gives Harry and Draco a few more instructions, including a rundown on Ronald's attitude problem for the week and tells them that they can decide best how to punish him.
When Harry's release hits the back of your throat, it's also your release. You remember that being a submissive on the weekends is about feeling pain and releasing your wordly responsibilities.
"Do you think you've learned a lesson?" Harry asked.
"Am I permitted to come?"
"Yes sir," Draco said, lifting himself from Harry's lap and heading to the corner. Harry wanted Draco in the living room so that it was the first thing Blaise would see coming into their house.
"Yes Harry."
It can take a while to find a good fit. You were open to the idea of being a sub for a couple, but you never imagined it would be for two men! They aren't gay, Harry and Draco. They're bi. And they were trying to take turns domming and subbing within their relationship, when they realized they were both natural doms, and if they wanted a sub, they'd have to go out to find a sub.
Madame Kat's sex club became a regular hangout for Harry and Draco. They didn't go every single weekend, because they didn't want the novelty of it all to wear off. But once or twice a month was their sweet spot. They didn't even use the BDSM room all the time. Sometimes, they stayed in the main room and just joined into whatever group sex or orgy they could.
"No sir." Draco said.
You run upstairs and get ready in the loo before heading into the bedroom. You crawl into that huge bed that's made for more than two and feel so alone, missing your Masters. You just start to drift off when they come in. They move you to the side and ignore you as they wrap themselves in each other, making love like any married couple would. Only this married couple has a submissive slut watching them, hoping to be touched.
8-Draco is to treat all others with respect and kindness, and watch his attitude toward others.
"Please remember," Harry said, handing Draco back his trousers, "When I give you your chores, they need to be done properly the first time."
Saturday morning you are again awakened by a cock in your face. You're still half-asleep so you don't even open your eyes at first, though you do open your mouth eagerly. You aren't sure for a few moments whose cock it is you are sucking until you wake a little more and see it's Harry. You should have known by the tickle of pubic hair on your nose. Draco keeps himself clean shaven in that area. You really must get the feeling of difference between your two Masters.
Sunday is the day you are to leave, as well as the day Hermione comes to pick Ronald up. You are nervous because you know that you and Ronald will be telling Hermione and your Masters what you did yesterday morning. You can't even imagine the punisment that awaits you.
"You can take advantage of my three little cocksluts," the Dom said, gesturing toward his subs, who were kneeling nude on the floor and looking up at their Dom withÂ  reverence in their eyes. "They love cock worshipping."
Harry went back to his study. He left the door of the bedroom opened to listen for any sounds that might sound like Draco sneaking for a seat or shifting around too much. A few weeks earlier, Harry had caught Draco kneeling during a half-hour corner time punishment and had added fifteen minutes to the corner as well as an additional three spanks for it. He was pretty sure Draco would not try that again. After a half hour, Harry got up and quietly stuck his head in the bedroom. Draco was still standing stock still, facing the corner. Harry smiled and went back to his work.
Snape sighed. "They beat him, starved him, and raped him from a very young age. You see why we can't let this continue. The only reason it took this long for anyone else to notice was because he kept glamours up. I've also noticed he has a mental age regression at points. Dumbledore has known about the abuse from the start, yet he refused to do anything. We need to rush this adoption through and use protective measures to keep Dumbledore from being able to interfere.  We are certain he will try to meddle with this if he can.  Lucius said that you were our best bet on getting this done quickly and quietly."
Draco laughed a little at Harry's mispronunciation. While he wasn't used to seeing Harry act young like this, it didn't matter. He's still Harry, still his friend, and most importantly, still safe. "I'm glad you're safe Harry." Draco held his arms out, offering a hug. He wasn't really expecting Harry to give him one, but he was shocked when Harry threw himself into his arms.
Harry quickly downed the potion, grimacing at the taste. "Why can't they taste better?"
Harry nodded and proceeded to follow Draco. They stopped in front of a painting of a bowl of fruit. Draco reached up, and proceeded to tickle the pear, causing it to turn into a door handle. They walked in, and paused.
Snape led Harry out of the fireplace, heading straight towards the desk. He quickly checked a sign on top of it, but not finding what he was looking for. He turned towards the woman. "We need to see a mind healer and a regular healer as well. I just adopted my son out of an abusive household and want to assess the damage, but I don't seem to see which floor that is on." The receptionist nodded briskly, and consulted a chart next to her.
Neville took a deep breath. "Thank you Harry. That means a lot to me." He gave a weak, sad smile. "Are you okay after what happened in Potions? I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to mess up."
Snape quickly walked to the elevator, pressing the button for the second floor. As they descended lower, people got on. Finally a cool, female voice spoke. "Ministry of Magic, Level Two. Department of Magical Law Enforcement." Snape led Harry out of the elevator, seeking out a blond head in the crowd.
Snape's voice was hard. "Then I take matters into my own hands."
"Come on, let's go down to the kitchen. My old house elf Dobby is in there! He can get us something to eat." Draco began leading the way down to the painting.
"I am just really clumsy, Madam Pomfrey. I fall way too often." He hoped she wouldn't notice the lie.
"Yes, I was just thinking. Harry, can I ask you something?"
Snape tilted Harry's head to look at him. "Its okay son. I just want to keep you safe. Lets go inside."
They all walked back to the castle together, laughing and joking as if they never hated each other. They didn't know why they hated each other in the first place. Pansy was awesome, and she wasn't afraid to call anybody out. Blaise was quieter, but he was calculating. He was the voice of reason. And Draco was... Draco. He was a quiet flame that burns brighter in the face of the wind, full of life. And he was beautiful, not that Harry would ever admit thinking that. He had to remind himself he was just in it for the apples, which he had to admit were absolutely worth the wait. He could understand Draco's obsession after eating one. When they reached the Great Hall, they nodded once to each other, a solemn but silent promise that they would hang out again at some point, because despite the fact they spent a few years hating each other they all fit together well and enjoyed themselves. They went their separate ways, Harry to the Gryffindor table, and the trio to the Slytherin.
"Hm, alright." Madam Pomfrey nodded her head once, but she was beginning to grow worried. If he was abused, it would explain a lot. Later she would meet with Professor McGonagall to see if she knew anything about his home life. "Alright, lay down. Get some rest while you can. If you need me, I will be in the next room over." She left the room and headed to her office.
"I couldn't sleep and decided something to eat might help." Draco shrugged. "It happens."
Harry sat down and quickly drank the potion, coughing slightly. After about three seconds, he slumped against the chair he was seated in.
Upon receiving a nod from Saxton, Harry and Severus left the room.
Snape turned to Harry. "Are you hungry? You must be, its been a busy day!"
Saxton looked around the tiny cupboard, investigating what appeared to be the small child's living space. All that was in the room was a tiny bed, and approximately 17 spiders. He shuddered slightly. How anyone could live in this space, he didn't know. His thoughts were interrupted by the cupboard door slamming open.
"Harry, I want you to understand that I will never be like them. I will never raise my hand to you in anger or frustration. I will never harm you in any way." Before Snape could say anything else, the cool female voice was heard, announcing their arrival to the fourth floor. "Come on Harry, this is us."
"I was talking to Harry, I found him wandering out late at night, looking really upset. It took him a while but he told me what was going on... well, technically he didn't say anything. He was too scared. He gets abused at home. Badly. He told me that they would kill him if he said anything. After that, he started acting different. Younger. It made me worried." Draco looked down. "I tried to stroke his hair to calm him down but he got really scared, and that's when I really knew. He started begging me not to hurt him, saying he was sorry. Please, you have to get him out of there." Draco's eyes glistened with tears, and he wiped them away angrily.
"What is the real reason you were out walking?" Draco leaned in, looking into Harry's eyes.
"Yeah! That's fine! And you two... thank you for listening to me and not hating me. I'm glad you're my friends. Thank you." Harry reached out and gave them both a large hug, pouring his emotions into it.
Before Harry could say anything, he was led inside the sweet smelling shop. Harry's eyes grew wide, looking at all the bright colors and fun shapes. Upon seeing Snape's nod to go ahead, he proceeded to fill up a bag with a little bit of everything except the acid pops and blood pops. Snape's smile grew wider with each thing grabbed. He didn't care how expensive this would be. He would pay so much more if only Harry would remain this joyful and carefree. Before too long, they checked out, and started heading towards the castle.
"But dad, you said you wanted to assess the damage." Harry turned, avoiding looking at his father.
"Oh yes! I can do that." With a loud pop, Dobby vanished.
Snape looked stunned. "Nonsense! No one is EVER too old to color. Besides, Harry. You've been the grown up far too long. Let yourself be a child for once. I can see in your eyes you want to. I will keep you safe. Be as young or as old as you want to be. I just want you happy."
Harry immediately started a run for the brightly lit Honeydukes, letting his nose guide the way. Before too long, he was standing in front of the shop in awe.
"Yes, I do. Harry, just because you have damage, doesn't mean you're damaged or broken. It just makes you unique and wonderful. Even after everything you've gone through, you managed to trust new people. You aren't broken Harry. You never have been." Snape rested his arm gently on Harry's shoulder. "After this, would you like to go visit your parents' grave?"
Everyone else nodded. "We're here to help you, first by confiscating those apples. You can keep one." Blaise stated. Rolling his eyes at Draco's groan, he opened his bag and tossed an apple to everyone. "Hope this apple was worth waiting for, Harry."
Harry sat down next to Neville, noticing him alone. Hermione and Ron had each other, right now Neville needed someone. "Hello Neville. Mind if I join you?" Harry noticed something about Neville was off, he wasn't as full of life as he normally was. Harry gently touched his shoulder, and Neville jumped and fell off the bench, his eyes wide and full of fear. Harry quickly helped him up, understanding. He was positive Neville was abused. It showed in his eyes. Harry was sure his were the exact same, if only someone cared to look deep enough into them. "Neville. Are you alright?"
Snape turned to look at his son, worry creased between his brows. "You aren't broken, Harry."
The woman looked around the room. "Where is he? I expected you would have brought Harry Potter along since this involves him." Her eyes rested on Harry for a moment. "Don't tell me this is him..." Noting the silence, she gripped her quill tightly, almost to the point of breakage. "What did they do to the poor child?!"
Snape stood up and strode to the small boy, wrapping his arm around him and pulling him into a hug. He knew he wasn't technically his son yet, but he had a surge of affection towards the small child. "Harry, I promise that isn't true." Harry turned his face into the robes of his professor, clinging on to him. "I want you. I don't ever want you to be hurt again."
Ron, who had been watching Hermione's confusion with an almost amused look, jumped. "Wait, what's going on? Tell us what? You know you can tell us anything mate. We're your friends!"
Pure terror flooded the child's face. Saxton looked up into the enormous purple face of the man he finally figured was Vernon Dursley.
"Enter." Albus Dumbledore peered over the top of his half moon spectacles, wondering who it was this early in the morning. He was surprised when it was Severus, not Harry begging to get out of the household he lived in.
"Oops! I'm sorry." He quickly retracted his hand, a pink tinge across his cheeks. The awkward silence only lasted a moment, before there was a loud pop right next to them.
Harry grabbed his wand and handed it over to her. "There. Now I'm unarmed. Now can you please help me? It's about Malfoy."
The second the man was in the room, he threw a punch directly at the child's head. There was a sickening crunch, showing the man had made his mark. Still though, the child refused to make a single sound. Already he was bruising, his right cheek turning an ugly purple. Still though, the man wasn't done. In a second, the child was pinned against a wall, a giant hand wrapped around his throat. The monster, Harry's uncle, ripped his shirt off, revealing a series of gruesome cuts across the child's back, most of which looked infected. Vernon made a small noise of approval, and threw the child back down on the ground. "You deserve this, you freak. You deserve every second of this, and so much more. You're going to be my puppet, my slave. You'll never be free from me." With those ominous words, he left the room.
"Harry! Where have you been? You missed all your classes today, and I heard Snape took you into his office this morning. He didn't yell at you, did he?" Hermione asked, apparently not noticing the tall sullen man behind Harry. "Wait a minute, you look so different! What's going on?" It was at this point she noticed that Harry was holding onto Snape's robes. Confusion flashed across her face as she began connecting the dots. She remembered how back in her muggle school, a kid was being abused, and a teacher took her out of class to talk. She remembered how small she had seemed. Realization dawned on her. "Oh Harry!! Why didn't you tell us?" She resisted the urge to fling her arms around him, not wanting to startle him.
"Fine, but I'm doing this for Draco, I hope you know that! Meet me on the Quidditch Pitch before dinner. Draco likes to fly before then. I'm also bringing Blaise, he can help." With that, Pansy strode out of the closet.
They paused. "Is he going to say check mate?" Blaise asked.
Harry had Draco spend a full hour writing lines. He had to copy all of his household rules as many times as he could in that hour. After that, he was instructed to do housework, which was probably the best thing to keep his mind from worrying too much about the cage. Just as Draco was folding laundry that evening, Ted and Amy came by. They were all going to go to Madame Kat's together, as the subs who were scheduled to be caged were supposed to get there early.
"You must know we are disappointed in you."
"Yes Master Draco," you say. You take a moment to admire the long lean cock in front of you. Master Draco's cock has a greater length than his husband's but less of a girth. Master Draco is clean shaven as well, not a hair to be found where pubic hair normally is, and his balls are smooth and smell of some kind of shave cream. His cock is every bit as delicious as Master Harry's and you take it in eagerly. Master Draco too seems to be impressed by your ability to have his cock touch the back of your throat. He warns you though when he's going to come, and though you plan on swallowing his load, he pulls out and jerks a couple of times and comes on your face. And it is a LOT of come, covering you from your hairline and down to your chin, where it drips off onto your breasts.
Harry finished his glass of brandy and set the glass in the sink. He peeked in the oven to see what was cooking, it looked like a roast with some carrots and potatoes on the side. It smelled delicious. Draco's cooking had really taken off in the last few weeks. He made his way to the living room and saw his husband standing in the corner. He was standing straight up and didn't turn around at all when he heard Harry enter the room.
Draco quickly vested himself of the rest of his clothes, and Harry did the same. They faced each other, taking in the others' body, all lean muscle and large erections. The fell to the couch together, kissing and fondling the other. Their breath becoming harder, and turning into moans. "I want you to fuck me," Draco said.
"Third. You'll be nude all weekend starting now." You take the hint and remove your clothes.
Right as you are done, Hermione and Ronald are just getting to the Masters' house. Ronald is being led on a leash and is wearing nothing but a diaper. You can see even through the thick padding that his cock is huge. Hermione looks at you approvingly. "Good work on the body ink," she says to your Masters. "I'm sure it is serving as an important reminder of her proper place."
As soon as Draco's body tightened as he was coming, Harry couldn't take it anymore and his own release flooded Draco's asshole. But he didn't slow down, he kept pounding and pounding, loving the feeling of his own jizz slicking the tight asshole of his lover.
"My Masters, Ma'am."
You two submissives are given towels to dry off, and the three in charge announce that you'll both be punished since you both pissed at the same time.
You rush to the dining room just as the Masters are walking out. They ignore you as you clear the table, and take everything to the kitchen to clean it up. Now you are upset because you do hate to be ignored. But you still work to make sure the kitchen is perfect and clean.
"Yes sir," Draco said and he kneeled by the chair.
You rush to stand next to him and he has a devilish look on his face. He pulls an ice cube out from his glass and holds it against your nipple. You gasp loudly. It's so cold and your nipple immediately turns into a hard pink pebble. Harry looks at what you're doing and he is grinning now too. "Wait," he orders. Draco removes the ice and your breast begins to warm a bit while Harry is upstairs.
"Yes sir," Draco responded, still facing the wall.
Your story must have made an impression, because the spanking you get is much harder than the one Master Draco gave you yesterday. Harry's hand is firm and as he spanks he says "You will call us Master Harry and Master Draco!"
Draco cringed, but didn't argue as he took off his trousers, folded them neatly onto the Harry's desk and got to work sweeping up the dusty remains with the small hand broom. Harry watched for a few moments, enjoying the look of Draco's beautiful ass sticking into the air and his balls dangling between his legs. It took Draco more than a half hour and his knees were red and marked from being on them with no support on the stone floor.
"Second. You are not permitted to come." Well, that wasn't a surprise, you figured that'd be the case.
"Do the dishes," Harry said to Draco, "Then come meet me and Blaise in the bedroom."
"Yes Master Harry."
"This is a serious infraction," he points out. "We are going to discipline more before you leave, and next weekend is going to be all about punishment for this behavior."
"We'll have to think of something else," he says sadly. "Come into the kitchen."
You wait patiently while the Masters each sit at their own desks doing some work. You realize that you don't even know what kind of work they do! Then again, they don't know about your corporate life, except that your weekends with them are a welcome break from being in charge.
As soon as Harry gets the rice out of the kitchen cupboard, you know what is coming. Rice kneeling is the worst. Immediately you let a whine escape your throat, and Draco, still standing behind you, swats you on the butt. "Don't whine," he orders.
Carly nodded and took the condom from Harry's hand. She opened it up and slid it down his cock. He gasped and lifted his hips slightly to her touch.
You watch as Harry pulls down his trousers and knickers and kicks them to the side. He's sitting on the sofa, his legs spread and he takes a small sip of tea. You fall to your knees and crawl over to him, anxious to get your mouth on his cock.
The three of you are collapsed on the floor, breathing hard and gathering yourselves. "Well," Draco says. "Welcome back, Girl."
You nod your head. Humiliating language is something you both love and hate. It puts you in an amazing sub space, but at the same time, you recognize how worthless you really are, prostrating yourself for two men.
The kitchen timer went off, and each of the punished subs got one last very hard whack with the paddle.
"No Master," you say.
He pulled out, "Yes, Girl?"
"Yes," Harry said. "Among other things."
Harry grunted as he pushed in a little more, then a little more, until he was fully inside his lover.
Harry has a look of disappointment on his face, and you just realize what you've done. You made it almost twenty four hours calling your Masters by their full names and now you've done it. After all that ice, you're going to get another punishment.
Harry settled his cock at Ted's waiting and quivering hole and worked his way in. "Oh yes," Ted said. "Fuck me Harry!" His voice could barely be heard over the other sounds of moans and screams and requests for a hard fucking going on around them. Ted's asshole was so tight, but he enthusiastically lifted his hips higher and higher, "All the way, Harry!" he said.
Blaise laughed again, "You make him count?"
"Ignore him," Harry said.
After lunch, Harry had Draco stand in front of him, while Harry kissed him and fondled his dick over the chastity belt. Harry got naked and made Draco watch as he draped himself across the armchair and masturbated. He allowed Draco go palm his own dick over the belt as he watched. He knew it was torturous for Draco to be continually denied an orgasm."
You turn to Master Draco, who has his trousers and knickers around his knees and is sitting on the other end of the couch with his cock already hard and jutting into the air. He kicks off the clothes, but as you crawl toward him, he orders you, "Wait. Before you touch me, pick up my pants and Master Harry's pants and fold them neatly. I don't tolerate such a mess."
The Dom got a little smirk, "Oh, you little bitch, you love a golden shower do you?"
"So you'd know how important it is. That I'm willing to do it to keep my skin soft and wrinkle free."
There is a beat where there is total silence before all three of them starting roaring and yelling at you.
Harry settled himself in the arm chair to watch as Blaise made Draco work him over with his hand before lubing up, and pushing himself balls deep into Draco's asshole. Draco had never taken two dicks in one day in his asshole, but it quivered in excitement around Blaise's cock. Blaise kept up a punishing speed and spilled his load soon enough.
A whine came from the back of Draco's throat, but he swallowed it down and said, "Yes sir."
Once they've caught their breath, Draco comes over and touches your pussy lightly. He can feel how soaked you are. "I guess that turned you on, Girl."
You nod your head, deciding to start this portion immediately.
"Yes, I know. I know Master Draco. I promise, I live only to please my Masters and I will do everything I can to call you by your preferred titles."
Eventually, they put the cards away and Master Harry snaps his fingers, "Come Girl," he says. "Let's head to the bedroom."
Draco shrugged.
Draco looked relieved. He placed a couple of slices of thick turkey onto the bread and added some lettuce and a tomato. He wrapped it in paper, added an apple and a bag of crisps to a bag. He looked proud of himself. "Lunch!" he said proudly.
Harry took the parchment and wrote something out.
Draco turned to go into the kitchen, and Harry felt a swelling in his groin to see how bright red Draco's ass was.
______
"Girl," Draco barks. "What the fuck did you do?"
6-Draco is to serve Harry with a happy and servile attitude.
Amy made eye contact with Ted, Draco with Harry, as Harry pushed himself into Ted's waiting asshole. "Oh Harry," Ted said, never breaking eye contact with Amy.
"Mmm, the dress might be nice," Draco said thoughtfully. "Girl!" he barked.
Ted lay back on the floor, legs spread and his asshole lubed, waiting for Harry's cock to penetrate him. Harry took a look around and liked what he saw. Men going down on women, Men going down on other men, people of all genders fucking each other. It was the hottest thing he'd ever seen.
"Really?"
Draco had made a beautiful salad with a steak and kidney pie. "It's lovely, Draco." Harry said, "Thank you."
"Yes sir."
You've been looking for a Dom.
Harry patted Draco's cheek lightly. "That's a good lad. Maybe this weekend we'll go out shopping together and you can find a brand that is legal, and that works for you and we can work it into your budget."
You lay on the floor, legs spread. You were blushing as Draco get you settled into the diaper and sealed it aroudn your waist. Diapers are the ultimate humiliation for you, and your Masters know that. It's thick and bulky between your legs, but you know better than to argue!
"Oh fuck, Harry. God, yes! That is so good." Blaise was making direct eye contact with Draco as he shouted encouragement at Harry and fucked his mouth.
"Draco," Harry began. "I can see how this seems like an overwhelming job to you. But part of being submissive, is learning that you need to ask when something seems impossible. What kind of Head of Household would I be if my little pet couldn't come to me with things like this?"
You drop to your hands and knees immediately.
"On the bed," Blaise said to Harry.
You walk naked into the kitchen, where Harry is cooking breakfast while Draco reads the morning paper. "Good morning Master Harry, Master Draco."
"Thank you Master Draco," you say.
Draco looked pained, but he made his way down the bed and took Harry in his mouth, giving him a morning blowjob. After that, Harry sent Draco down to start breakfast, while Harry tried to devise a plan for Draco's punishment.
Draco turned and Harry and Blaise smiled at each other to see how red and painful it looked. "You can get the salve," Harry said.
"I'm going to remove the chastity device. You'll get hard almost immediately, and since you've been such a good boy who learned his lesson. We are going to allow you to decide how you want to come."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Surely that can't be true."
After finding each other through a kink site, you met with Harry and Draco in public a few times, then had dinner at their house where you had established some rules and got to know each other more personally.
"I'm interested in how he treated you."
You hang your head, disappointed. Draco leans over and grabs you by the chin, lifting your head so you are looking into his eyes. "You know you deserve it."
They are such good Masters to recognize it right away. They stroke your hair and tell you what a good sub you are, they say you're beautiful and how proud they are that you edged four times in two hours. You calm down and get a feeling in your chest. This is a feeling that is telling you that you're happy here, that you're contented. After so long looking for a new Dom after you left your last one, you weren't sure you'd get that. Things are still new-ish here, but you just know they're going to work out.
"Buy what you think you'll need for the next few days of food."
"One," Harry moaned, writhing in pleasure.
Harry and Ted would stop what they were doing every now and then to look at their subs. Both Amy and Draco were straining at their restraints, so anxious were they to get their hands all over themselves. Harry could only imagine how awful it would be to be as erect as Draco now was with no way of getting your cock touched, no way of getting that release. And Amy over there, her cunt absolutely glistening and dripping. He could practically smell her sex and desire from where he was sitting. She was trying to thrust her hips, trying for any sort of friction that just wasn't there.
That actually seemed to calm down as he nodded and swallowed audibly. "Yes, sir. Whatever you think is best," he said to Harry.
"You liked it," Draco says. "You make me sick." He grabs the food and sets it on the counter. "Serve me and Master Harry first in the dining room, then you can eat here by yourself in the kitchen and think about what a nasty little slut you are."
"Lines?" Draco sneered, "Like a common school boy?"
Draco's voice shook a little, "I was having sex with Amy," he tilted his head toward Amy in her cage, "without permission from my Dom."
Draco put his arms around Harry, "I love you babe," he slurred. "I love you so much I brought food for you."
"Yes Master Harry," You say, and you busy yourself with your task. You don't drink coffee, so you only make enough for two. "Master Harry, do you like your coffee strong?"
Some people were just clustered and talking, some were watching action and masturbating. Both harry and Draco were hard as rocks just taking it all in.
Even as he went limp, Carly seemed to be enjoying herself, because she kept bouncing up and down on Harry's cock, and she was starting to take quick loud breaths. Her dom leaned over and practically pulled her off Harry, slapping her hard across the ass. "You. Do. Not. Come!"
You hate lines, you absolutely hate them. But you know you deserve it so you get to work and in an hour you fill several pages of missives about being a dirty slut (which you ARE! You know you are!)
Draco shrugged. Harry pointed his wand at Draco and with a flick of it, every last stitch of Draco's clothes disappeared.
"Yes Master Harry!" you say.
Harry brought it up to Draco one time a few weeks after Blaise's visit. Draco's attitude had taken on an immediate improvement, and the few times he got a little spanking, Harry thought he might be acting cheeky just to get that swat on the butt.
Finally everyone was gone and Madame Kat came to get Draco and Amy. Amy looked like Draco felt. Her makeup had run from tears, her hair was mess, her ass was welted, and so were her large breasts.
By about day four, the newness had started to wear off and Harry started noticing Draco not being as compliant. He still woke before Harry and still had Harry's lunch ready for him, but it was without a smile. That day over breakfast, Harry said to Draco, "Your chore for today is to clean the toilets. Both bathrooms need to be washed and scrubbed. I noticed the bathtub is getting a ring."
"AS do I," you say, with your head hanging.
3-Draco is to awaken before Harry, and be ready to see him off to work. Monday through Thursday, he is to have a lunch ready for Harry to take.
You were panting, sweating, and completely satisfied. Once the three of you caught your breaths, you got your wits about you. "Masters, where will I be sleeping?"
After breakfast, where Harry allowed Draco to eat at the table with him, Harry decided that he wasn't going to punish Draco physically today. He would get enough of that at Madame Kat's. Instead, they sat in the parlor while Harry made Draco talk to him about his and Amy's decision to have sex the day before. This was possibly worse for poor Draco who really had to use some introspection to figure out exactly why he did it. Initially he just said he was horny and so was she and often when they had sex with Harry and Ted, that they weren't allowed to come and they were afraid that would happen again. But then Harry wanted to get deeper psychologically, and Draco finally admitted to feeling like if he didn't misbehave, Harry might lose interest in their sub lifestyle.
Sure enough, Blaise walked in, still wearing a smart and sharp looking suit and dress robes from his mother's wedding and grinned to see Draco's backside standing in the corner. "I see he's been punished more today. Corner time? And look at that red ass. My my, that must have been some spanking."
Draco gave Harry a kiss, and Harry left for work.
Harry and Draco looked at each other as though they were surprised it was even a question. They hadn't considered orgasm denial a form of dominance. They were having a conversation with their eyes that lasted approximately two seconds.
"Hmm," Harry said thoughtfully. "Is something going on to give her that attitude?" Harry had learned that sometimes there was something besides just naughtiness that would give a sub an attitude, and sometimes simple punishment wasn't going to fix it.
She was shaking, "Yes sir."
"I still think it was OK that I went over my allowance."
Harry let loose with a loud spank of his own. "Two!" Draco said. "Please forgive me."
Draco came to, and realized what he was doing. "Fuck, Harry. I feel like I need to come."
The fourth and final spank was hardest still and Draco was barely holding back his tears as he said "Four," in a quiet and wobbly voice.
"Hmmm, well you are to submit to me."
"And, may I remind you, YOU are the one who wanted me to put you on a budget."
He would constantly look over at Amy, who seemed to be getting at least as punished as he was. Her chastity device had been taken off at some point, and he could even see from his vantage point how swollen and red her pussy was. She'd probably had at least six or seven cocks in there tonight, pounding away. He wondered if she was able to come.
Draco looks angry. "Were you holding back from pissing your diaper fullly?" he asks.
You nod as you watch Harry pour some dried rice onto the floor. "Kneel," he orders. You get to your knees, the rice digging into your skin painfully. Once you are settled, looking up into your Masters' faces, Harry continues, "Tell us what you did wrong."
All of this was so erotic, that Harry said, "I'm going to come." Immediately, the cocksluts pulled off, though one kept his hands on Harry's cock and continued to jerk. As Harry came, the cocksluts had their heads together, their mouths opened to catch the semen spurting out of his dick. They lapped it up greedily, and when some of the spunk landing on one of their cheeks, another cockslut leaned over and licked it off. They were still talking, telling Harry how delicious his come was and thanking him for letting them see it and make him come.
The Dom stood on shaky legs and grabbed her sub. She walked her over to Harry. "She was masturbating. Would you spank her while your sweet little bitch makes me come?"
"You know the punishments will only get worse," Draco stated.
Harry folded his hands in front of him and looked at Draco intently. "I'm sorry, but who do you think cleaned the toilets before we started our domestic discipline situation?"
Harry waited no time at all for the sting to subside and placed the tenth spank on Draco's ass. "Ten," Draco said.
"First things first," Harry says once Hermione is gone. "Draco and i are hard as rocks from watching this Girl act like a whore for Hermione. We need our dicks sucked now."
"Will that help you learn your lesson?" Harry asked.
They give you a quick spanking before handing you back your work clothes so you can go back to your own flat and start the rest of your week tomorrow.
Harry grabbed Draco's arm and lay one loud smack across his already welted bottom. Draco stood up straight, "Sorry Harry!"
'I guess I get to spank you now."
You nod, though you'd been hoping you were going to get permission to wash your face. They set you up in the same hard-backed chair they'd used the prior weekend. Your ankles tied to the legs and your hands tied behind your back with ropes crossing between your tits.
"Just get it on with, Potter," Draco growled.
"Parlor, NOW" Draco yells.
"We are not just Master! You will refer to us properly!"
You will write this sentence over and over again for the next hour," Draco says. He hands you a pencil and a pencil sharpener and leaves the room.
He began to stroke, and stroke, and stroke some more. Draco was whining and moaning, sounds that made Harry want to nut right there, but he'd been trained. He knew that he couldn't come until Harry gave the order and though Harry was anxious for his own release, he enjoyed the torture he knew it was putting Draco through to have to wait to come.
"And I deserve every inch of punishment!" SMACK
Without thinking, you answer "Yes."
But you never are.
"Yes, Master Harry. Yes, Master Draco. I came."
"In bed?"
Instead, he places a small smack on the outside of your pussy and says, "Too bad, Girl. Now get in bed." He unties your wrists and you crawl into the bed on one side. Draco and Harry slip in and you all fall into a deep sleep.
"I want you to serve me, and sit with me, and eat with me all while you're nude, yes."
"Thank you for the punishment, sir. And thank you for allowing me to fuck you."
"Yes sir."
"Gotcha," Blaise grinned. "And of course I'll stay. I never thought I'd see the day where Draco Malfoy was willing to be put in his place."
Maybe they would learn to be rougher after all.
Draco didn't have many opportunities to lick pussy that often. He was better at sucking cock. But still, that didn't stop him from diving in enthusiastically. This Dom's cunt had a delicious musky odor and if Draco could get hard, he knew he would just by smelling her slick sex. He licked up one side and then the other, not quite diving inside yet. The Dom's clit was growing but Draco didn't give it direct attention, he simply ran his tongue in a circle around it. She began bucking her hips toward him, craving that bit of friction, but he held off.
"What are our names to you?"
"Let's talk about what you did. Why do you think you're getting disciplined?"
Harry said on a nearby chair. He watched as Ted sat on a chair across from him, ready to spank the male sub.
Back at their house, Draco and Harry were talking themselves to sleep. "Are you OK I spanked someone else?" Harry asked.
"Do you need help understanding them?"
"You can earn those back after dinner."
They are done eating and order you to eat and clean before coming back to the parlor. You make quick work of your porridge and the dishes. In the parlor, there are still more boxes of Draco's Auntie's belongings, But the Masters aren't touching them yet. They are waiting on you to suck them off again. They have to toss a coin to figure out who goes first and it's Draco who stands in front of you, pushes you down by your shoulders and forces his cock into your mouth.
"Yes Master Draco."
Several doms in a row lined up for blowjobs. The first Dom, the one with the three cocksluts, had heard how good Draco was with his mouth, and they all wanted a piece of it. For a full hour, Draco had his mouth stuffed with cock after cock. They all blended together, and though he was surviving, he was still in the back of his mind extremely proud of his ability to deepthroat.
"Okay," Harry said, putting the chess set away. "What is it?"
You start to cry, but Draco has no sympathy as he places three hard smacks on your wet and already aching butt. He forcefully leads you back into the house and marches you up the stairs where he promptly puts another diaper on you. You are so ashamed and humiliated now but not enough to use your safeword.
He pushed once hard on the clit before removing his hand. No need to torture her quite that much. Between the spanking and now watching his beautiful husband's ass turn red by another man, and all the other visuals they'd seen since coming into the club, Harry just new he couldn't last long. He grabbed Carly's bruised ass hard and buried himself as deep as he could into her hot cunt, letting his load blow.
Harry and Draco's shower was huge, the size of a small bedroom. It was stone and had a bench in it and several shower heads at all different angles. They got in the shower and Blaise used a detachable shower head to clean the lube out of Harry's asshole. They soaped each other up, laughing and talking the whole time. By the time they were done and had toweled each other off, paying close attention to their dicks, they were both ready for round two.
Draco looked thoughtful. "No sir."
"Yes sir," Draco said
They begin right away, not even warming your ass up and starting right with very hard smacks. It stings so bad and they're hitting so hard it's pushing you forward. The pain turns from a pleasurable pain into a real pain soon enough, especially when the Masters said their hands hurt and they switched over the the paddle. You began crying in earnest. Oh god the pain from the paddle over and over and over again on your backside, which had already taken a beating from the riding crop just a few hours earlier. You know your ass is going to be well and truly bruised when this is over. Your tears and snot mix with the dried come on your face and you begin moaning in pain. There's a slowdown and you know the Masters were waiting to see if you woudl use your safeword, but you don't need to. This is a hard spanking for sure, but you know you're a tough little slut. The paddling continues. "This is what you get for being a slut," they remind you. "Ronald is getting punished just as hard this weekend because he's a man-whore too. Your pussy belongs to US and to US only. It's not your pussy to decide whose cock goes in you."
"Now," Harry said. "Let's go to the dining room and you can serve me and Blaise before you get your own food."
She climbed out of the cage, inspected the work Harry did on spanking her sub, and they went off.
"Very good...uh," Harry says. "Should we cal you by your name...or?"
Ted and Amy became close personal friends of theirs, even outside of the sex club. They would often get dinner and hang out together, sometimes it would end in sex with a partner swap (or a spanking swap), sometimes they would just go out and eat as a friendly couple - no sex involved at all. It was nice that they had another couple who practiced domestic discipline to relate to.
"No!" Draco said. "It's not like that! I mean, when I act up, when I'm a little shit like I was at Ron and Hermione's that night, you get to discipline me."
"Of course, Ma'am." Ronald says agreeably.
"Quiet!" Ted roared.
Draco looked pleadingly in their direction as they came out, fresh and clean. He was thrusting his hips in the air in an almost animalistic way of trying to get friction on his cock. But there was nothing there except the air above it.
Hermione spins you around, lifts up the skirt of your dress and lays three hard smacks against your ass. "Don't you forget it."
"We need nothing from you but to stand there and look pretty," Master Draco says.
"Not until I say you can come,"
______________
Draco shook his head, his eyes closed in concentration. "Can you help me take care of my ass? It's really very painful."
"That's right," the doms all agreed, "No masturbating. Just watch us."
Master Draco takes your clothes and puts them neatly in the nearest coat closet. "You'll get those back Sunday night."
"Thank you," Harry said. "I was looking through some of these cookbooks, and I'm going to start easy with you. For dinner tonight you need to learn how to scramble eggs for me. And I think we can have bacon and fruit salad." Harry took some money out of his pocket and handed it to Draco. "Go to the markets today and buy what you need for dinner. I want you to look through the cookbooks and find other things you might want to try. They can be simple until you get the hang of cooking, OK?
"Harry, you shall never be going back to that house. I promise. I have an idea to keep you from going back, but only if you're comfortable with it." He waited for Harry's nod before continuing. "Harry, I want to adopt you."
Harry stood up and removed his shirt carefully, trying not to aggravate the raw skin. "They still hurt."
"Ready Harry?" Severus looked down at Harry, worry etched on his face. Upon receiving a nod, he began the trek to the grave he'd been to so many times. It took merely minutes, but to Harry it felt like hours.
"Well, he's certainly right about that." She pulled some parchment forms out from a desk. "This is the form you need to sign in order to get him under your guardianship immediately. Normally there would be a period of time in between, but we can't risk that. I will give my seal of approval to force this through right away." She handed Snape the forms and a quill.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco stood up and turned to leave but a sudden thought struck him. "What if he already knows? What if he knows and he left Harry there to suffer?"
Draco surprised him by laughing. "Glad you're okay Harry. I'm gonna head to Transfiguration. See you around."
"Ooh! There he is! I see him!" Harry was grinning with excitement, pulling Snape right after him. He stopped right before crashing into the tall man. "Hello Mister!!"
Harry paled, and hid slightly behind his father's tall form. Snape took notice and held up his hand gently. "I'm really sorry, can this conversation please wait? This might be a little too much for Harry right now. I promise I'll talk to you about what happened later, with Harry's consent of course. Right now I just want to help him feel better."
"Thank you Potter." Malfoy was working intently, already adding and mixing. He hadn't even noticed he thanked Harry. He quickly became absorbed in his work.
Severus and Harry landed in a field near the wizarding village of Godric's Hallow. They began making their way to the town, spotting the graveyard after a moment. However, Harry grew distracted by a house in the distance.
Harry nodded, hardly believing he was going to have a dad soon. He grabbed Snape's hand, grinning. "Let's go!"
SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG!! It's been a hectic few months! After that surgery I got in a couple abusive relationships (I wasn't allowed to do anything other than talk to them), got extremely sick, PTSD started acting up and I couldn't write about abuse, and two days ago I got rear-ended and sprained my hip and shoulder! It still really hurts to type because of my shoulder but I was desperate and wanted to update! To be honest, writing abuse still really makes my PTSD act up but I needed to for the story. (My boyfriend got upset that I forced myself to do it tbh). Don't worry guys, this boyfriend is amazing. Thanks everyone for the support! It means a lot to me. Also, sorry it's so short!
Severus released a breath he didn't know he was holding. "Are you quite positive he's going to be okay?"
Harry nearly snorted with laughter. "I don't because you always sabotage me. Well, you, Crabbe, and Goyle. But seriously Malfoy, it wasn't as horrible as I expected either. Well, until I nearly died. That wasn't pleasant, but at least I fulfilled my quota of one-near death experience per year."
Harry sighed. I think she knows... she can't know. Nobody can know. He will kill me if they know. He settled into the bed, and allowed himself to think happy thoughts, such as eating a green apple for the first time in over a year, hugging Malfoy, treacle tart. It only took him one second to shoot up, realizing he had just thought about hugging Malfoy. Shaking his head, he sunk into the blankets. It was probably just the potion he was hit with. He would never think about that normally. He closed his eyes, hoping everything would be resolved tonight before dinner. With that comforting thought, he fell asleep.
"Wait a minute, Draco. What are you doing out so late?" Harry stopped following.
Even without Harry haven eaten the sugar, he was bouncing with excitement and energy. He had never been in a candy store, except once when he was forced to watch while Dudley got all the candy he wanted. However, all too soon, they arrived back at the castle doors.
Severus knelt down next to Harry. "Yes it is. Your mother and father died to ensure you live safely and happily. I am sure they would have never wanted you to be put in the hands of your aunt and uncle, but now we can ensure they will get their wish of your safety and happiness. Would you like to go visit the house before we visit their graves?"
"The mind healers appear to be on the fourth floor. I should make a note to put on the sign for future reference. Thank you for bringing that to my attention, sir. Have a nice day!"
Severus hesitated. He knew the house was dangerous, but Harry had so little in his life. He was hoping maybe Harry could find something of his parents to keep close to him. "We can go in, but you have to be very careful. I don't want you getting hurt."
Harry mumbled something into Snape's chest, not wanting the hug to end. Snape understood quickly. "Harry, is it alright if I just picked you up and carried you? I know your legs must be tired from all the walking, and this way you can get a little bit of cuddle time too."
"I love you too sweetie." With a gentle kiss to the mess of hair, the two made their way towards the library, taking the back way to avoid any people to make Harry feel safer until he was ready to face the world as himself rather than the glamours. The library was nearly empty, except for a set of three kids, two sitting at a table reading intently, and one pacing around them.
Severus nodded quickly, and he stood with Harry to leave. "Thank you for your help, Mister Saxton. We'll be back then."
"Will he be okay, Madam Pomfrey?" The boy averted his eyes, which was unnatural for him, as he normally was full of self-confidence.
Severus turned to look at Harry briefly, who was kicking his feet absentmindedly. "And what if we can't calm him down quickly?"
Harry grabbed his arm. "I'm ready."
"But what 'bout when I'm not useful no more?" Harry turned his wide emerald eyes toward his professor. "When I get 'nnoying and too much work?"
It was obvious Draco was confused. "Harry, what are you doing down here by the Slytherin dormitories, let alone at this time?"
Blaise stood, and headed for the dormitory door to seek Pansy out. Draco quickly followed behind him, but unexpectedly ran straight into Blaise, who had paused in front of Pansy. Blaise grabbed Pansy's hand, and pulled her into the dormitory, with Draco groaning slightly, following in pursuit. "Pansy. We need to tell you something about Harry."
Harry and Severus carefully made their way into the building, Severus going first to ensure nothing would collapse on them. As soon as Harry touched the door however, a sign appeared, stating the house stays where it was to show the sacrifice made by Lily and James Potter. Harry peered closer, and noticed all sorts of writing on it, full of support for him. His emerald eyes began to fill with tears, which he quickly wiped away. The sign had given him the courage he needed to continue. He grabbed Severus's hand and continued inside.
Behind him, a familiar voice sounded. "Who's there?"
"What was your dream about Harry? Maybe talking about it will help." Draco had a small feeling of uneasiness that grew when he saw Harry trying to avoid his gaze. He knew something was wrong.
Harry followed Snape out of the elevator, sticking close by. He was worried that Dumbledore was going to show up at any moment and declare he go back to the Dursley's care, if it could be called that. He followed Snape up to a desk, waiting silently but alertly.
When Ronald and Hermione are gone, your Masters leave you to your kneeling for a while longer. Finally Harry says, "Girl, come here."
"Tell me, Girl," he says. "Things like spanking and things we consider punishments. Do they need to be punishments or are we free to do them at our leisure?"
"No sir!" Draco said. "I just...." he drifted off and shrugged.
Draco looked up at Harry and blushed from his head down to his knees.
Gods but this was magnificent. Draco's tight hole was gripping tight on Harry's cock. Harry moved in a little more.
"Stand up, Girl," Draco barks.
"I see that," Harry repeated. "I thought you'd be home in time to cook."
"Master Draco, Master Harry, I can fold the laundry. I don't mind doing chores."
Draco and Amy retired to the kitchen to start cooking the meal. Harry and Ted stayed back in the parlor. "She's had a bit of an attitude this week," Ted said. "I told her if she isn't serving with a smile, she'll be punished later."
Draco put his hand over his dick, trapped inside the chastity belt.
"Oh absolutely," Draco says, sounding delighted at the opportunity.
"Mmm-hmmm," you agree. If loving giving head makes you a dirty Girl, then that's what you are. Again, Draco pulls out and comes on your face.
You make your way back into the parlor, where the Masters are sitting on the couch, reading.
"I'm nothing and my Dom is everything!" SMACK.
"Isn't she something?" Draco asks.
Draco nodded, "Yes sir. But how do I uh....pee?"
Harry had given the task of choosing meals over to Draco. He'd become a good cook, and Harry knew he could handle that responsibility. But Harry would still order Draco to do certain household tasks each day. From cleaning out the overstuffed closets (Draco brought way too much stuff from Malfoy Manor to his and Harry's shared house) to polishing furniture, to fixing a broken handrail, there was always something that needed to be done.
"And it is Master Draco!" he shouts. That's twice in a row you just called me Master and you will PAY for it after we eat.
You don't say anything but redouble your efforts to stay as still as possible, though your arms feel like they want to give out.
"And what does that mean?" Harry asked.
"Don't mind me," Blaise said. "You do what you need to do."
Draco and Harry visit a sex club. There are scenes of punishment, but know that all punishments in this entire story are consensual. Please assume that ALL acts have been consented too, even if that consent happened "off screen."
Harry paused. It was the first time Draco had referred to him as sir, and he....well, he didn't hate it. His chest swelled with pride at being someone's sir.
Harry grabbed some parchment and a quill and ink. "You're going to do lines for me."
Draco scurried out of the room to make dinner in the kitchen while Harry went to his study to catch up on some paperwork.
Master Draco laughs, "No you may not. How cheeky of you to even ask!"
"Blaise you aren't my sub. You're allowed to come as you please." Harry could hear Draco whine from the chair.
"I didn't respect Harry's authority in the house," he said. "I was wrong and I'm sorry."
After dinner, you are ordered to clean up the dishes. When you finish, you return to the Parlor where your Masters were sitting on the couch in the nude. "It's time to do the only thing you're good for," Draco said, "And suck our dicks."
"Yes sir."
"You're too soft," Draco shot back. "You let things like this build up and you don't say anything to me. Maybe it's because your Aunt and Uncle made you think that you didn't have any control at all."
When they are done with the riding crops, you peek over at Ronald and see his balls are very red, but his cock is now rock hard. He is fully erect and you can't believe that a cock so big could get even bigger. Though your clit is aching from the punishment you just took, seeing that magnificent piece of man is making your long for it.
He made eye contact with Draco, who was frowning. He looked across to Ted who was getting his cock sucked by the male sub from the other cage. "Ted," Harry called out. "After you come, please take Draco and spank him. He disapproves of me spanking another."
"And you're going to behave from now on?"
Ted and Harry smiled. They both knew that their submissive spouses quietly loved being punished and put in their place. The next night was going to test that love. Harry couldn't wait to see what the other patrons of Madame Kat's had up their sleeves for Draco's indiscretions.
7-Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary.
Again, as you aren't a good cook, ingredients with clear instructions have been left for you to make your Masters dinner, and by the time it is done, they are waiting in the dining room already. You pour their wine and serve them with care, standing and waiting your next instruction. It's Master Harry who says, "Make yourself a plate and eat in the kitchen," dismissively.
"Yes Babe?"
Even though he'd just come, he could feel his cock swelling once again, as he made his way back up to the bedroom where he removed every last stitch of clothing and lay down face up and spread eagle on his bed, waiting for his submissive husband to come please him however he told him to.
Draco stamped his foot, "Harry, this is dragonshit and you know it!"
Now they were halfway through and Draco was breathing heavily. The pink on his asscheeks contrasted brightly with his otherwise pale skin. "Are you OK?"
Of course, once Harry has come and you've swallowed his semen, Draco must get a turn as well. He's already rock hard from watching you suck off his husband. Draco doesn't have you swallow, but pulls out and comes on your face. You know better than to wipe the come from your face until you have permission. You lay in bed and wait while the Masters get dressed. Draco turns to you, "You may clean up, and meet us downstairs in the kitchen."
Paddles were produced and you feel the hot wet tears falling down your face before the first blow lands on your ass. You can hear Ronald getting it just as hard and he is grunting with the pain of each blow.
Draco quickly walked to the living room and stood quietly facing the corner.
"Maybe tomorrow night, we take them to the sex club and give them time in the punishment cages?" Ted asked.
Draco looked queasy, as Harry grinned and said, "Brilliant. You too Draco."
"Did that hurt?" Harry asked.
"I see you eyeing the cages," Ted said. "And those poor subs aren't taking any punishment at the moment. Do you want to go over?"
Harry hurried out of the room and made it to their bedroom, pulling up his robes and vanishing his own trousers. He jerked off as fast as he could and came all over the floor. He bit his lip to keep from moaning as semen spilled from the end of his cock. When he was soft again, he quickly brought his trousers back and put them on. He pulled his robes back down and tried to look dignified as he went back into the living room and said to his husband, "You can come from the corner."
You wonder what punishment is in store for you.......
"Mmm-hmm," Draco said, his eyes closed in concentration at holding back his orgasm.
Harry nodded. "Draco, you'll make both me and Blaise come first, then we'll work on you."
"Can't I have pants?"
"Trust me," Blaise said. "I was scared to do it also, but Madame Kat made me go in the belt, and once i did, it wasn't such a big deal."
"Oh, pet. Of course I will." He never wanted Draco to live too long with his bruises and welts. They went up to the bedroom where Harry applied the magical salve. The salve worked well enough to take the edge off the pain, but leave just enough there to remind Draco what happened to naughty little boys.
She moved her sub away and lay down, spread eagle in front of Draco. "Lick me," she ordered.
"Indeed she does," Draco said. "I think she's proud of them." The three of them laughed loudly. "Well, when you're worthless at anything else, I suppose being proud of giant tits is all you've got." Your face blushes crimson.
"Why are you crying you little bitch?" called out one Dom, who wasn't in the cage with him, but was enjoying the show.Â That only made Draco cry harder. Why, oh why, had he and Amy thought they could get away with that quickie the night before. The dom who'd said that pointed and laughed at Draco. "I heard what you did, you little slut. You deserve every bit of what you're getting tonight."
Next chapter is the sex club and will likely (but not definitely) be the end.
"It's not enough to buy my face cream."
Harry had pulled the condom off, but he still felt loose and happy. "You're welcome." He watched as the dom lead her back to the punishment cage.
"OK," Harry said. "You say the word and I remove the belt."
Harry stepped outside, my God, he hoped Draco would misbehave again soon.
Draco took a deep breath, wiped his tears, and said. "I was reminded that you are the higher authority in this house and I need to submit myself to your rules."
You love it.
"Thank you," Draco said. "That actually means a lot to hear.Â  Tonight was extremely difficult."
Draco tripped trying to toe out of his shoes and giggled. "I see that," Harry said. He took Draco by the arm and led him into the parlor calling to Blaise over his shoulder, "Come on in, Blaise."
Harry dropped the paper and looked at Draco, standing naked in front of him.
"Well, right now you are going to start by finding me a white shirt, and pressing it. And I will deal with your punishment once that is finished."
"Y-yes," Draco said.
"Yes sir," Draco agreed, siting on the armchair.
Draco stuck his fingers down the front and tried to pull it down, but it wouldn't budge.
"Well, good. Shall we retire to the bedroom? All I've been able to think of think of all day, including during that blasted wedding, was getting back here."
You lay yourself across his lap, your ass facing up. Master Draco draws a hand back and smacks you across the backside. He does it three more times, each time a little harder. Your ass stings.
"I'm getting there," Draco panted.
"Actually," Harry said. "I'd like you to bring in one of the kitchen stools and sit with your legs spread so you're on display for us."
Master Harry's cock is delicious. It's soft when you first take it in your mouth, but soon enough with your talented tongue, you have him hard as a rock. You want to make a good first impression, and you show him how far down you can take a cock. You know by the way he moans that he appreciates it. You're working your tongue all over, up and down the shaft and around the glans, before going all the way down, so your nose is buried deep in the dark hair that sprouts from above his well-endowed dick. "Mmmm," you say, savouring the taste and the feel of a hard smooth cock in your mouth. It's what your mouth is made for.
It was the right thing to say, as your Masters looked at each other looking pleased with themselves. The night was glorious. Though they were fucking as equals, while you would have preferred a little more submission on your part, you couldn't help but note that they, indeed, did know how to use their cocks. Draco was between your legs, his cock balls-deep into your wet tight pussy, and he was thrusting roughly, while Harry sat astride your face and fucked your mouth. Both of your holes being filled so aggressively was everything you wanted, but you weren't sure you were allowed to come. Draco was so skilled at sex that you weren't sure you could hold off.
"Now," Draco says. "Hermione said that Ronald here was acting quite childish this week, and she's given us permission to punish him for it. Since you both are subs, you both get punished when one does something wrong."
Draco goes first, his soft cock pushing roughly into your mouth. You work him over and in no time at all, his cock grows until it fills your eager whore mouth. You slavish it with attention, petting his balls softly while he fucks your face hard. It doesn't take long before he unloads his semen into your throat which you eagerly swallow. You barely have time to catch your breath before your other Master has his hard prick between your lips. He resumes just where his husband had left off, fucking your face hard. Draco watches as Harry's cock disappears into your mouth and pounds your throat. Draco cheers his husband on, "Fuck that whore's mouth!" Harry pulls out and jerks off onto your face, his sticky thick come dripping off your eyebrows and your chin.
Ronald is ordered to make us dinner, while you are sent up to the bedroom to set up some sleeping bags on the floor of the Masters' bedroom for me and Ronald to sleep in. The four of you eat together in the dining room. Ronald seems to be a very attentive sub, always willing to jump up to fetch more wine or whatever the Masters need.
Draco turned and looked straight ahead, "Yes, sirs."
"Do the dishes," Harry commanded.
"I didn't obey your order to clean my closet, and I didn't come to you when I needed help."
Draco started to cry, "I'm very sorry Harry! I'm realizing now that I broke the rules when I didn't have to! I could have asked for more money, but I knew just what I was doing!"
"It's one thing to fuck other people, but I'm not sure I like you spanking someone else. That's our thing."
As you are leaving the Masters' house, you are feeling perfectly miserable. "Girl," Harry says, gently lifting your chin so you are looking into his kind blue eyes. "You made a mistake, but you came to us and admitted your wrong doing. We are angry with you, but once the punishment is over next weekend, that will be it. We won't continue to punsish you beyond that.
You lay on the kitchen floor and spread your legs, "Get in me."
"Go get the blue dress out of the closet upstairs and put it on."
"On the floor," Ted ordered.
Harry slapped the side of Draco's ass, causing him to yelp. "I'm in charge here," he said with a growl.
"I didn't have rules as a child," Draco pointed out. "And you had too many rules with no control over them. We're just fixing things now. So, what's one thing I do that really bothers you that you want to fix?"
"May I have her?" Hermione asks.
"You're not going to-" Draco asked faintly, looking down at his dripping hard erection.
"Yes. Basically you punish me when I break a rule. I guess we'd have to come up with some rules."
"Were you taking advantage of the fact that I feel like I can trust you now to do the things I ask and am not constantly checking up on your progress with the chores I give you?"
Master Harry is panting harder, and he doesn't warn you before he comes. A hot load of his semen hits the back of your throat, and you momentarily cough around the Master's dick, but manage to swallow most of his load. He continue to suck until his thrusting slows down and his breathing evens out.
"If we'd get a house elf-"
"Then do it," Harry said, raising his hips eagerly.
"Yes Master Draco." Master Harry looks at you and shrugged a little rolling his eyes, like he just didn't know what to do with that husband of his.
"And that's why you're wearing the chastity device, is that right?"
You look between them and chant, "Master Harry, Master Draco. Master Harry, Master Draco..." over and over. You lose count and your mind starts to wander and you're sure you've said it far more than twenty times, but the Masters don't stop you. Eventually you stop on your own and they look satisfied.
"Say it!" the Dom yelled.
"Nasty little tramp like you," Harry says, "We knew you'd be thirsty for it."
"If you uncuff me, I can use my fingers," Draco said.
They answer the door together and you step in. "Good evening, Master Harry. Master Draco," you say, kneeling in front of them.
"That's it," Harry threw down his napkin and took Draco by the hand and led him to the living room."
The Masters stand you and Ronald about ten feet apart and order you to stand with your legs spread and your hands clasped behind your back. Your tits are jutted out and you see Ronald glancing at them. Hermione sees him doing the same thing and places a slap right across his face. It stuns you because face-slapping is forbidden between you and your Masters. But Ronald only looks appropriately shamed. "I can't blame him for looking," Hermione said to your Masters, "Your little whore does have a magnificent set of tits."
For the first few days, Draco was impeccable. He was awake early, had Harry's lunches and had managed a few simple dinners. Bacon was a little burnt, and pasta a little under-cooked, but those were learning curves. He'd done a few chores, such as dusting the woodwork, and doing dinner dishes.
"Let's hear you say them," Harry ordered. "Twenty times each."
"Okay," Harry looked sidelong at Blaise. "We can work on this later."
He took a few minutes to gather himself before saying in a whisper, "I respect your authority Harry, and I willingly submit myself to whatever punishments you deem necessary for me."
"No. It's easy work, Draco and I don't want another word."
At long last, they are done reading and pull a pile of laundry between them to start folding.
Draco smacks you again. "Did we give you permission, Girl?"
"I gotta say, Harry," Blaise said. "Seeing you as a dominant has made you a lot sexier."
"Perfect," Blaise breathed.
"Oh, Harry. Draco," Hermione breathes as she takes you in. "That dress makes her look like such a tramp just begging for your dicks."Â Hermione steps closer to you and looks you over. You feel a little uncomfortable and inspected. "Her breasts are glorious," Hermione whispers.Â  "May I touch?"
"Yes, an average day."
"Go back to the chair," Harry ordered.
"Yes," Harry said. "First time."
"Lay down on your back, Girl."
"Yes," Amy said. "We were trying to be sneaky about it too."
"Yes sir," Draco said, and Harry got that same swell. Draco bent over, his elbows resting on the arm of the couch, and his ass sticking out just waiting for its punishment.
Draco came to Harry one afternoon as soon as Harry got off work. "We need to talk."
"Open the box," Harry commanded him.
Blaise whispered something to Harry, who grinned and nodded.
"Stand up, Draco," Harry ordered. Draco stood rubbing his backside. Harry noticed Draco's cock was at half-mast, which didn't surprise him because his own was already throbbing behind his robes. He'd had no idea that doing this would be such a turn-on. "Go stand in the corner for three minutes," Harry ordered, pointing to a corner of the room.
"And what?" Hermione asked icily. At that point, you know that they know what you've done.
"Yes, ma'am," Draco and Amy answered together, submissive to the very end.
Finally, the crowd started to thin a little, as people were packing up and going home. The first Dom of the night, the one with the three cocksluts, came into his cage along with the three cocksluts. The Dom attached the handcuffs higher on the cage, so Draco's back was against the bars, his arms raised above his head. "Do it," he nodded to his three subs.
Harry flicked his wands and Draco's trousers and underwear appeared in his hand. He handed them over to Draco who began to dress his bottom half.
"Then I guess you'd better hurry."
"Yes sir," she mumbled, putting the bottle of wine down between Harry and Ted, and going back into the kitchen.
"Mmm-hmm," Draco said. "But, Harry, sir?"
"Oh yeah?"
An hour before it's time for you to leave, you are giving your final blowjob of the day. The constant coming has made both of the masters last longer. Each blowjob takes a little longer than the one before it. Now, you've been going to town on Harry's cock for a good fifteen minutes, after it just took you twenty to get Draco off. Your jaw is starting to get sore, but you settle in, because you forgot how much you love this. You love being a sub and making yourself uncomfortable for the sake of your Dom. The person you want most in the world (on most weekends) to serve.
Draco stood facing Harry, their erect cocks facing each other, only an inch between them. "Repeat after me," Harry said. "Harry is the ultimate authority in this house and Draco is to submit to him."
The sub looked ashamed as she lay herself across Harry's lap, and he began to work her ass over and over with his hands. "How naughty of you," he murmured as she squirmed underneath him.
The Dom laughed in Draco's face and slapped him one more time, "I don't believe it you worthless little bitch." Then he turned around and walked away. He snapped his fingers and the cockluts crawled to their master, awaiting their leashes and hoping for another cock to worship. "Let go work on that one," he said, and they walked over to Amy's cage.
"Yes I do," Draco said, his tongue working his way over the Dom's hands, between the finger and everything. "I'm a dirty little slut."
"But nothing," Harry said sternly. "The toilets need cleaning and you are going to do them."
Their best friends, Ron and Hermione, have a normal marriage on the weekday, but on the weekends, Hermione is a Dom to Ron. She let Harry and Draco borrow her little sub a couple of weekends while she had work trips and they found they liked Domming on the weekends very much indeed.
"Yes Master Draco," you say nodding. You do know it.
"Thank you." Harry leaned in for a kiss, and though their kisses goodbye were usually just a peck on the lips, this one was much more smoldering.
"I'm sorry I keep forgetting to use your full names. And I'm sorry I acted like such a slut to the delivery man."
Once they could stand straight, Harry and Ted grabbed the chastity devices, took the restraints off of Amy and Draco's ankles and slid the devices back up their bodies.
Harry tried to concentrate on his dinner, but seeing his husband nude and submissive while eating, knowing that he has to stand because of something Harry did to him, was making him powerfully horny. They got through dinner with some mild conversation and Draco cleared the table. "Come back in here before washing the dishes," Harry said.
"Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary."
"No thank you," Draco said, trying to sound dignified. There was no dignity in his red ass, the Gryffindor colored chastity belt and his obvious need to constantly have his hands on his dick.
Back downstairs, Harry is continuing to work on breakfast and Draco fills him in on what has happened with your diaper. Harry looks at you disapprovingly and shakes his head, "What a dumb fucking cunt," he says. You want to cry.
"Better use something else for the next six minutes."
Harry lay down at the foot of the bed, so they were right next to Draco. He had a perfect view as Blaise worked his way down Harry's body, peppering kissed and licking nipples. Draco watched as Blaise opened Harry's legs, and instead of going for Harry's cock, licked a stripe up the crack in Harry's ass. He spread Harry's cheeks and kissed the entrance to Harry's asshole and let his tongue just barely breach it. Harry moaned and gasped as Blaise's tongue worked in ways that left him panting. Finally when Harry was going crazy with desire, Blaise leaned in and took Harry's dick in his mouth the entire way.
Before you could even agree, Master Harry shoved his hard cock back in your mouth and resumed getting sucked off, while Master Draco kept up the fast rhythm of his thrusts. You were so close, you knew it wouldn't be a problem, and within ten seconds, the wave of your orgasm hit. You moaned loudly around Harry's cock, which was enough for him to shoot his hot load down your throat for the second time that day. Your orgasm caused the walls of your pussy to contract, hugging Draco's cock. He grunted a few times, and while the waves of orgasm were still washing over you he pushed deeper and harder and came within the walls of your pussy.
"Yes, Master Draco. I'm very sorry."
"What was an average day with him like?" Draco asks. Then he says, "Wait, let's get Harry in here to hear this."
"You mean, without magic?" Draco asked.
Harry cut him off. "No. House elves are slaves and we aren't doing that."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Draco asked.
WHACK! Harry was hitting harder now. "Six," Draco's voice was strained, and again on "Seven."
Draco shrugged.
Harry returns with a blindfold and puts it around your head, covering your eyes. Then he orders you to stand with your legs and arms both spread. You're positively shivering in anticipation. They are taking their time, and just as soon as you let your guard down, there is one ice cube being swirled over a breast and another one on your abdomen. Chills are sent through your body and you squirm. The ice continues to move all around from one breast to the other, around your midsection and over your still-sore ass. You can't stop moving, trying to get warmth through your body in some way.
You nod, feeling very small.
Draco turned his head and met Harry's eyes. "Harry. I trust you. I can't tell you when to take it off, because you get to decide that. I'm extremely sorry for what Amy and I did, but I am submitting to you and your decision about my punishment."
Draco pulled the cover off and rolled you to your stomach, laying two quick swats on your backside. "It's Master DRACO," he said firmly.
"Yes Master Harry," you say. "Yes Master Draco."
Harry removes your diaper and Hermione removes Ronald's. You watch and are stunned all over again at the massive size of Ronald's cock. You were starting to think you were exaggerating it in your mind, but no. There it is in front of you, the largest dick you've ever seen and all over again you aren't sorry at all you took the chance to have it in your puss. The diapers, the spankings,the humiliation. All of it was worth it to you because Ronald has a glorious prick.
Within a minute of Harry coming, so did the Dom. He pulled his cock out of Draco's mouth and jerked himself off on Draco's face. The amount of come that came out of that one dick was impressive, and Draco's face was soon covered in the white substance.
This Dom had her sub wear a strap-on, which Draco had to suck like a real cock. He was on his knees, hands cuffed behind his back, with the bright pink silicone dildo sliding in and out of his mouth. It was a large dildo, but still not as big as the cock he'd just sucked a few minutes earlier. While he was sucking the strap-on, the Dom took two nipple clamps and stuck them to Draco's nipples. Harry's eyes went wide, he'd never even thought to use nipple clamps. Draco whined in the back of his throat - he had unusually sensitive nipples.
Draco stood there, drenched from the legs down in urine, wearing only his chastity device and hancuffed to the cage. His entire ass was nothing but welts, a few that had broken open. His mouth felt stretched from all the cocks it had taken, and he knew his normally set hair was probably a terrible mess. His nipples were bright red and achy and would definitely be black and blue tomorrow.
"How does it feel?"
"Ronald," Hermione says, "Come remove my skirt and panties and watch while this Girl eats my pussy.
"I am so sorry," you say, gasping and starting to cry. You don't know whose hand it is that strikes your backside several times in a row, but whoever is hitting is not holding back.
And over the next several days he tried to get the thought out of his head, but it wouldn't go anywhere. It implanted itself in his brain, and like a seed began to germinate until he had a complete picture of how to change, and how to fix his relationship with Harry.
You push him onto the floor on his back and you work him over with your mouth. You wish you could get the whole cock in there, but it really is just to big. It tastes like you and you slavishly lick and suck on him until he is biting his lip and coming all over your face and his own stomach.
"It will please us to be called by the names we agreed upon."
Harry licked his lips. "I hate that I work outside the home, and you stay home but I still do most of the cooking and cleaning."
You crawl back to him, "Master please may I suck your cock now?" you ask.
"His mum is getting married again," Draco answered. "He'll be here for a few days, and wants to meet up for lunch and drinks tomorrow."
Draco, still naked from his spanking, followed Harry wondering what was going on.
Harry sat down and turned Draco over on his knee and continued to spank the bare ass.
"Yes, sir," Draco said. He turned to go into the kitchen while Harry and Blaise went to the dining room to await their food.
"You remember the argument we had a few weeks ago, about my attitude, and how my parents spoiled me?"
You don't move and Harry smacks you hard on your bruised ass causing you to cry out. "When your Master says lie down, you lie down, Whore!" Harry said.
"I haven't had a bratty moment yet," you admit. "I'm new here, but I was with my last dom for YEARS and I had my moments."
Harry continued, "It was extremely naughty of you to not come to me, and to ignore the chore. You must have known I'd find out, right?"
"Yes Harry," Draco said. He braced himself, listening to Harry's deep and nervous breathing.
Draco came out of the dining room after a while, holding the parchment for Harry's inspection and rubbing his wrist slightly. Harry looked it over. "Very good," he said.
You make a face at the idea of being called your name. No, that is for your work life, not your weekend life. "Masters, you may call me whatever you please."
Blaise reached up one hand and took a hold of Harry's cock, all while not breaking the rhythm he had in fucking Harry in the ass. The hand on his cock was too much for HArry and he saw stars in his eyes as the orgasm took over his body.
The Dom took a few moments as the last of her orgasm washed through her. Draco kept his tongue pressed to her clit as he awaited her to be finished. Finally she stood up and ordered Draco, "lay your head on the floor."
"You know, this is why a lot of people don't like you," Harry said to his husband Draco one night. They had just gotten back from Ron and Hermione's house. It killed Harry that his husband and his best friends had trouble getting along. And even though Harry loved Draco with everything in his heart, he knew that more than half of the time, it was Draco's fault.
Draco's dick visibly twitched. "Yes Harry, I would definitely like that."
The man's mouth is slack, pracically hynotised by your breasts. Finally he looks up into your eyes, "Oh yes Ma'am." It takes a second while he glances back to your breasts before he gives the amount. You give him exact change and he looks disappointed. But then you pull out an extra bill from intbetween your breasts and lean down to place it in his hands, but you accidentally on purpose drop it. "Oh no!" You exclaim. You turn your back to him and band over to pick up the tip, knowing he can see full well you have no panties on. You pick up the bill and his hands are positively shaking. "There go." You bat your eyelashes at him.
You nod again, grateful you'll get to use a toilet in the morning. But your gratefulness is short-lived when you see Draco hold up the white thing in his hands. It's a diaper.
"Then get back to cleaning the floor," Draco orders. You drop to your knees and finish scrubbing.
"How was it?"
"Mmm-hmm," Draco agreed, still bent over the desk, his head resting on his arms and his eyes closed looking thoroughly blissed out.
"I'm ready, sir."
"You have?"
"I love it," Blaise said. "Draco, tell me what you did that was wrong."
"Are you serious?" Normally Draco did the fucking and Harry got fucked. It'd been quite a while since Draco allowed himself to be opened for Harry's cock.
"On your hands and knees," Harry said.
"No sir," Draco said, clearing his throat and trying to sound dignified.
The hardest thing for Draco to take was the verbal humiliation. He'd always been proud and had spent his entire life with his parents telling him how amazing he was. He felt like he could handle a spanking, but to take a paddle to the ass while having to hear how worthless he is, how Harry should just leave him on the street for disobeying, how the only thing he was good for was sucking cock, and he shouldn't even be allowed to use his mouth for anything but to catch come. That was actually pretty difficult.
"Yes," he agrees. "And let's try to act normal the rest of today."
Harry went quiet, "Maybe you're right."
The worst was when he had to describe what he did to earn his punishment. Because that was very humiliating. Every time he had to tell a new dom, it was like reliving the moment he and Amy had gotten caught. What he'd done was so bad, such an complete betrayal of everything he and Harry had tried to build with this lifestyle and he didn't know if he'd ever be able to express how truly sorry he was. If Harry wanted to keep him in chastity for a year, he's not sure he could blame him.
"Checkmate," Draco whispered.
You and Ronald are left on the floor on your knees gasping and crying and aching. You can hear your Masters and Hermione commisserating quietly, but you don't know what they're saying. Likely it's the punishment will continue next week for you.
"Yes Master Draco," you say.
Harry hesitated. "i know I said that I was going to punish you for a long time for what you and Amy did. But after everything you went through tonight, I feel like you've paid your price."
Blaise set the tip of his cock at Harry's entrance that was practically dripping with lube. "Relax," Blaise said, as he pushed a little further. It took a few pushes for him to breach the entrance fully.
Draco stood up and grabbed the used condom off the floor and took it to the trash can in the bathroom.
"Yes Master Harry."
"Yeah," Harry said.
"Because I was raised in a way that made me selfish and mean and this is you trying to help me."
"Tell us what you did wrong," Harry said.
"Do you do everything that seems like fun?" Harry asked.
The three of them go to the kitchen and return with a pitcher of water and two glasses. Both are filled and handed to you and Ronald. "Drink up," Hermione said. "And keep drinking until this entire pitcher is done and don't piss yourselves."
Ted nodded and within moments came all over the male sub's face. Harry urged Draco over to Ted. He began harshly massaging Carly's asscheeks. As much as he'd been spanking, she was holding off on crying. Her dom handed Harry a hairbrush, "This'll get her good," he promised. "And save your hand."
Several nights later, Harry was laughing nervously. He and Draco were at the kitchen table, a roll of parchment in front of them. "I can't believe we're doing it," he said. "Making rules for you like you're a child."
"It's house-elf work," Draco said petulantly.
The dom shrugged, "Carly, but you can call her whore if you want to."
"I'll do whatever you want," Draco said, still stroking himself, and his voice going husky.
And speaking of prominent displays, when Harry steps back from tying Ronald up to the chair, your jaw drops. Ronald is also naked by this point. His long body is surprisingly muscular. But the biggest surprise of all, is his cock, which is half hard from the attention Harry had been giving it as he was being tied. Ronald has an ENORMOUS cock. You've never seen anything like it in your life and you can't stop staring at it the same way Ronald can't stop staring at your tits. His cock in beautiful and seems to be pulsing with life. It juts out proudly demanding attention and you know as soon as you see it that you will do whatever it takes to get that cock in your pussy. Just imagining what it'd feel like to have that large phallus inside you makes you feel a little wave of moisture seep from your hole.
Draco shrugged. Harry sighed, "Draco. This is part of you having a better attitude. Instead of simply asking me for a higher allowance in a nice tone of voice, you used an accusatory tone. Then you tried to act like my giving you a higher allowance would somehow benefit me as well. Draco, I don't care how soft your skin is. I love the person behind the skin, OK? I absolutely forbid illegal cosmetics in this house. Have I made myself clear?"
"Yes," Harry said. "Draco is very servile. And he really likes to cook."
"Corner time, until Blaise gets here. I know it's a long time, but I don't think you are truly sorry for your behavior, are you?"
"I don't know," Amy said and she began crying again. "I really don't."
"I was only dripping because I was looking so hard at your cock. I was imagining your cock diving into my pussy. Imagining opening my mouth and seeing how much of this I can get down my throat."
"Let's hose them off," Draco says and they march the two of you outside.
You move into a rhythm with him and it is not disappointing. "I can't come in you," he whispers. "They'll know."
He looked over at her dom, who nodded in approval, but said, "she's not permitted to come." He threw a condom Harry's way.
Draco gasped, but didn't argue.
Harry raised his arm for the last one, knowing the last swat needs to be the hardest. With all his might he brought the belt down over Draco's exposed and sore ass causing him to writhe and yell, "Five!"
You head to the dining room where Draco is standing next to a chair. You sit down gingerly on your bruised backside. Draco hands you a piece of paper with the words
"I called you Master instead of Master Harry," you say.
Harry licked his lips. "I bought something I wanted to try out," he admitted. "Something for a new type of punishment."
"Yes Master Draco."
"Then spank me," Harry said, his voice full of authority. He stood up and removed all his clothes and bent over his desk, leaning on his elbows.
A small thought was forming in his head.
Draco just nodded to let Harry know he was OK, as the three men finished peeing and put their cocks back into the leather thongs they were wearing.
"You wanted to know what a day with Sir was like?" You ask.
________
The third spank was harder still, and now it was landing on skin that had already taken two hits. Draco's voice caught as he called out, "Three!"
Back in the cage, the Dom lay on her back in front of Draco and he continued to work his tongue around her pussy, finally sticking it in and lapping up her juices. She moaned in desire as his tongue darted from clit to her insides and soon she was squirming and tightening her legs around his head. She thrust her pelvis, getting her slick wet juices all over Draco's face, but he didn't care. He just continued to work his tongue all over her and finally as she shouted out, he could feel her pussy quivering against his tongue. Wave after wave of an intense orgasm ripped through her body, as her natural juices flowed out of her cunt and into Draco's waiting mouth.
_____
Harry laughed, "Oh hell yes."
"Why?" Harry and Ted asked at the same time.
It's shortly after breakfast when you and Ronald are again on your knees giving blowjobs to the Masters. Hermione walks in, sees what's going on and immediately drops into a chair, raising her skirt and kicking off her panties and begins masturbating to the sight that she's walked in on. You can see from the corner of your eye that her legs are draped over the chair arms and she is fucking herself with her fingers. You hope that all three of them coming will help them go a little easy on you.
Harry got his bearings and in one swoop, pushed his way until he was balls-deep in the glorious tight space. Ted screamed out, "Yes! Yes!" Harry took a few quick thrusts. He loved how open and vocal Ted was, it made him feel good, like he was great at doing this.
"Of course," Harry said.
"Yes sir."
"Ted, I'd like to fuck you in front of Draco and Amy," he said.
"Tell me what you learned," Harry said.
The three of them talked and joked and laughed while you and Ronald stood there facing each other. You are becoming more and more uncomfortable by the minute. You can still hold on, but you aren't sure how much you're going to last. You look at Ronald and see he looks as cool as a cucumber. You bite your lip. Ronald gets your attention by wiggling his fingers at you. You look at him. He glances at his Mistress and your Masters and when they all laugh at something together he mouths to you, "Let go at the same time."
"Stand up," Harry ordered.
They were greeted by Madame Kat, who took both Draco and Amy's coats. Both of them were naked but for their chastity devices under the coats. Madame Kat went over the rules for the punishment cages, which was that any Dom could do anything they wanted to the subs, as long as it was safe (no major injuries besides welts and bruises) and respected the sub's safewords. The safewords were written very clearly on each cage. Harry and Ted were to stay by the cages all evening, and had power over all the other doms to put a stop to anything they weren't comfortable with.
You nod gratefully, happy to be leaving for the week with a renewed sense of satisfaction of submissiveness.
"You're going to write down rules one and seven, one hundred times each."
Friday evening finds you outside their door, taking deep breaths to calm your nerves. You realize that you are also feeling some anticipation. It's been a while for you that you've had time where you were truly subjugated like the dirty little sub you are, and this is the time that your new Masters could give you that. Whatever they have planned, you know that you'll get through this weekend.
"Yes, Master Draco."
At bedtime, the Masters have you sit on a chair on the bedside with your wrists bound behind your back and watch as they make love. They kiss passionately, undressing each other slowly. There is so much love in their eyes and you feel outside of it all. You watch Harry kiss his way down Draco's smooth chest and cup his dick and balls lovingly in his hand. You watch as Draco peppers Harry with kisses all over his body, stopping to suck lightly on his nipples. And it's difficult to not groan as you watch Draco get on all fours while Harry enters him from behind. They are facing you, but not looking at you. You can see in their faces that there is no one else in the world besides the other as Harry whispers, "I love you," as he thrusts into his husbands ass.
"Better," Draco said. "That salve has a numbing agent that really helps. Thank you for the punishment and the reminder of how I can be a better person."
The evening of punishment has been so exhausting that you fall asleep on the floor in mere minutes, not even awakening when the Masters get in bed.
You hurry to do that, and you clean the kitchen the meet them in the Parlor.
At home that night, Harry was rubbing salve on Draco's backside. "Can I take your chastity device off?" he asked. Draco was lying face down on the bed.
"You'll stay in this corner until we're ready for you," and with that both of your Masters leave you alone in the parlor, naked and staring at a blank wall.
Harry raised his arm, belt in hand and brought it with a loud cracking sound across Draco's backside. "One!" Draco was already moaning in pain.
"I was giving Sir attitude all week."
"I think I know how to fix it," Draco said. His voice was tremulous. He was nervous.
"Draco! Ground unicorn horn is illegal! I'm an auror, why would you tell me that?"
"Out of my way everyone. Neville. What was the last ingredient that you put in?" Snape was by Harry's side, checking his pulse.
"Thank you daddy." Harry giggled at the fact the mean scary potions professor just said the word 'meanies'. He then reached his arms up in the universally understood sign of wanting to be picked up, and snuggled into his dad's neck as soon as he obliged. "I love you daddy."
"That's it, isn't it, dad." His voice seemed flat and empty, and Severus knew why. He followed his son's gaze to a destroyed house, not too far from where they were standing. "That's where my mum and dad died protecting me."
Saxton swiftly nodded. "Provided he doesn't live with them anymore, his healing should begin quickly. Now, it is possible something might trigger him, and cause him to regress rapidly and be terrified. In those instances, it is best to identify the triggers and prevent it from happening again, as best as possible. To calm him down during that, get him to a safe place. Nowhere too enclosed, as his abuse involved a cupboard, but somewhere cozy that he knows is his safe space."
"That wasn't bad at all." Harry's voice was loud throughout the quiet room. "Do you want me to take the other potion now?"
Hoisting Harry back onto stable ground, Severus took a look at what Harry had grabbed. It was a simple ring, but the engraving on the inside marked it as belonging to James Potter. Harry pocketed it as well. "Dad?" Harry paused for a moment. "Thank you for taking me here. I think I'm ready to go to the graveyard."
"And why should I trust you? We hate each other, remember?" She gave him a calculating glance, looking him over.
Saxton thought for a second. "Can you return with Harry next Tuesday?"
Saxton watched the scene unfold in front of him. A small raven haired child was scrubbing the floors in the kitchen, while an enormous man surveyed his work.
"Harry, it's okay you didn't tell us. Are you safe now? And where does Snape come in?" Hermione said, wanting to make sure that Harry wouldn't get hurt anymore.
Harry turned to look into the eyes of Draco Malfoy. He quickly took off the cloak. "Just me."
Snape watched the group with a large smile spread across his face. He had never seen him this carefree. He vowed to himself to make his little ray of sun shine every day. No matter how hard things may get, seeing Harry smile had given him hope. For the first time in years, both Snape and Harry were content.
"Can you just bring us some snacks please? Something warm and comforting would be nice." Draco's voice was kind, and Harry nearly did a double take. Draco being nice to someone beneath him was almost unheard of... at least that's what everyone said.
Malfoy did a double take when he saw Harry standing next to Pansy. "Potter? What are you doing here? I thought you were in the hospital wing?" His eyes darted to everyone present. "What's going on here?"
"A calming drought will be useful. If all else fails, send an owl to fetch me and I will try my hardest to get over there to help him through it all." Saxton relaxed a little in his seat. "Is there anything else?"
"Don't worry, I will be fine. You go to bed. I will see you tomorrow." With that Draco left, walking down to the dungeons. He was turning the corner when he ran face to face into the person he was looking for. "Hello godfather. I need to talk to you."
"Thank you, dad. I think I'm ready to go home now." He turned to get a final glimpse of the headstone. "But I'd like to come back again some day." He moved towards Severus, who took his hand, and the pair apparated back to Hogsmeade.
Harry looked up quickly, the shock of that question on his face. "You'd really take me? Aunt Petunia never let me know anything about my parents, let alone take me to see their graves."
"I see at least four apples in here. You're lying about it, which proves you have a problem. Draco, we are here to help you. Even Harry was worried." Blaise stated simply.
The giant man gave a slight nod, out of things to make a mess with. "Its decent, freak. Now get out of my sight!" With that final word, he aimed a kick at the child's rib cage. "Go on then! Get out of here!"
Harry looked up at him, beaming. He tackled his father in a hug. "Thank you. Thank you for saving me." Harry pulled away quickly, afraid that if the hug lasted too long he might bother Snape. Snape must've known exactly what was going on in Harry's head as he gently pulled him back in and stroked his hair.
"What are you smiling for Potter?" Malfoy sneered slightly.
"Hello. I was wondering where the mind healer that specializes in abuse cases is located. I just adopted my son and he was abused pretty badly in his previous household." The male at the desk nodded, his eyes passing over Harry.
"Severus, my boy. It is for the greater good. The child must know suffering in order to become strong. You, of all people, should know that." Dumbledore reached out an almost pleading hand, as if he was expecting Severus to just go along with it.
Severus Snape stood up, and walked out of his room, headed straight to the Headmaster's office. He knew something had been wrong with the old man, but now he had proof. He was sitting by, knowingly letting a child get abused. As he approached the door, he started getting more and more furious. "Sugar Quill." As the staircase forms, he climbed to the top, knocking forcefully on the door.
Draco stood and made his way to the door, intending on wandering around until he ran into his godfather. He quickly slipped out and into the common room, vowing he'd make the old man pay for all that he watched Harry go through. Nothing would hurt Harry ever again, not if Draco could help it.
The child looked at the whale of the man, terrified beyond all belief. "Yes sir!" Visibly shaking, the small boy moved his rag over to the mess made by the person Saxton assumed must be his uncle. However, as his rag moved over the shattered ceramic, the boy got cut, but made no sound. Without even showing any sign of pain, the boy picked up the rest of the ceramic, depositing it in the nearest trashcan. He quietly returned to the mess, finishing cleaning it up, a small amount of his blood mixing in with the liquid from inside the cup. The boy then peered up at the behemoth of a man, his eyes dead, but also seeking approval that he doubted he would ever receive.
Harry looked up shyly. "But what if people judge me? Won't they all think I'm a freak?"
"See you, Malfoy." Only after Malfoy left, did Harry realize that he called him Harry. A small blush spread across his face. He turned to Madam Pomfrey, who was watching the exchange with amused eyes. "When will I be released?"
"I'm glad you're my son. Thank you for saving me Harry." Snape wiped away his own tears, feeling immense love for the small black haired boy in front of him. "What do you say we go tell Draco what's going on? Seems to me he's been pretty worried. I think he'd be happy to know that a certain boy is safe."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry sheepishly nodded. Upon receiving a nod from his dad to continue, he looked to the waitress. "Erm.. Hello. Can I please have the meat pie? And a butterbeer please?" He looked back over to his dad, who was smiling.
Harry had to admit he had never seen Malfoy up close, without either of them attacking each other. He took this time to study his rival. His eyes, which he had always seen as grey, were more of a silvery blue. He quickly turned away, before Malfoy could notice him staring, and began handing ingredients when asked. Before too long, the potion was perfect. Harry couldn't hide the massive grin that spread across his face. However, he didn't hide it in time. Malfoy had turned to say something, and noticed his smile.
"You have been watching him! I knew it!" Pansy started giggling.
Snape, who had been watching this, ready to jump in if needed, finally spoke up. "Actually Harry, it wasn't me. Draco came to me last night. He told me his concerns. I wanted to look into it because I take this stuff seriously. I can't stand by and watch anything like this happen. Draco was the one who told me. He was scared for you. I know sometimes he's a brat, but he's a really good kid. He cares about his friends deeply."
"I can't tell you Draco. They will kill me." Harry's eyes widened and he covered his mouth. That last sentence alone was enough to let Draco know what was going on. Draco's eyes darkened, and he raised his hand, causing Harry to flinch and fall out of the chair. "P-please don't hurt me! I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!" His eyes were full of tears.
Severus put his arms around Harry. "They love you too. They will always be in your heart, Harry. We can come back and visit any time you want." After this, the pair sat in silence for a while, taking in the comfort of each others company. Finally, Harry rose.
Lucius turned to look at Snape with an amused yet worried smile. "Are you sure he's actually thirteen? He's so small, and he definitely does not look thirteen. He barely would pass for eight, and even eight is a stretch."
Panting, Harry woke up, doused in sweat. His back was on fire, and he wasn't entirely sure that the gashes weren't bleeding. He stood up and grabbed his invisibility cloak, intending on walking until he didn't think about it anymore. He snuck out of the dorm and walked out the door. The Fat Lady was familiar with his nighttime wanderings.
Harry shook his head vigorously, causing Snape to chuckle slightly.
Harry picked up his bag, and headed towards the blond. Throwing his stuff down, he sat next to him.
Harry mulled that over. "Okay! Does this mean I have a dad now?" He grinned, his tears drying up quickly.
Snape turned to Lucius. "Sorry about that. He's really excited today. He's also acting a bit younger than normal... I think I'm gonna have to ask the healers about that to figure out if it's normal." He turned to Harry. "Harry, Lucius is one of the good guys. So if you ever need something and can't get to me, go to him."
"Harry's being abused, isn't he?" Pansy's words were abrupt and sharp, leaving stunned silence in their wake.
"Can I please have a butterbeer too, and a Shepherd's pie?"
I'm just gonna accept I am horrible at updating. It's been a rough year for everyone, and I lost my dad on the 29th of December from covid. Please wear your masks. It keeps people safe. I want this pandemic to end, I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through.
"They do look good." Draco smiled before grabbing one, but his thoughts were more troubled. He knew something was going on with Harry, but he wasn't sure if he should ask. They hadn't been friends for very long. He took a sip of the milk, deep in thought.
"I just needed... some air." Harry tried his best to sound convincing but he noticed a flicker of concern flash in Draco's eyes.
Before too long, their food arrived and both their stomachs were satiated with the delicious fare. Snape paid and left a generous tip, making sure to grab the pictures Harry had colored before leaving. "All right Harry. Ready for Honeydukes?"
Severus led Harry to the lobby. "Are you ready? I think it's finally time you get to visit your parents."
Blaise stood and walked to his friend, who had frozen in his tracks upon realizing his voice had betrayed him. He swiftly hugged him, and felt Draco break down. Within seconds, Blaise's shirt was soaked with Draco's tears. "Draco, can you please tell me what's going on? I've never seen you this worried."
"Wait, Draco told you? I didn't know that... Dad, can we thank him? Please? I was so scared when he found out, I was scared someone would hurt me. Now I'm safe thanks to him and to you." Harry peered at Snape, eyes watery.
"Relax Neville, I'm perfectly fine. I just got to rest instead of go to class. No big deal. I am in there all the time. Just next time, make sure to double check the ingredients. I don't want anyone else getting hurt, I'm used to it." The truth was, Harry was actually hurting. His back hurt from where he took the blast. He just didn't want Madam Pomfrey fussing over him, and he definitely did not want her looking at his back. That's the one thing she never saw, because if she did, she would know. No one could know. There was only two people in this room other than him that knew... Neville... and Dumbledore. He looked up and met his icy gaze. Slowly looking away, his sights rested upon the group of Slytherins. He had to admit they were amazing people to have around. He just hoped they would stay around. Sighing, he got up and left the Great Hall, and headed up to the dormitory, mumbling the password. "Briarwood." The portrait opened and he climbed into the common room. Climbing the stairs, he walked into the dormitory to find it empty. He crawled into bed, hoping the dreams wouldn't come back. However, he was not so lucky. The moment he fell asleep, it all started.
The waitress smiled and nodded. Without being asked, she handed Harry some coloring parchment and some crayons and went to the kitchen.
Severus led him up the stairs to the room he knew was Lily's and James's room. Harry's nursery was completely destroyed, but the master bedroom was mostly intact. Harry quietly began looking around, his hands touching surfaces he knew his parents had once touched, and briefly felt their comfort. His hands roamed a dresser, and stopped upon a hair brush. Engraved into the handle was a flower. A lily, he thought. He carefully pocketed it. As he made his way over to the side of the bed, he noticed most of the floor here was decayed and broken. He decided he didn't want to risk it until he saw a glimmer of something reflected on the nightstand. He carefully crawled over the bed and grabbed it, but the momentum nearly caused him to fall through the hole. He looked back to see Severus had grabbed onto his leg just in time to prevent him from plummeting to his probably gruesome death.
Harry nodded, his eyes full of wonder. "My family didn't sign my slip so I wasn't allowed to come. Ron and Hermione told me all about the sweetshop and butterbeer though!" He looked off, not daring to ask. He had been given so much today, he shouldn't want for more.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other, each thinking the same thought. 'Draco isn't a bad guy?' Hermione gave Harry a shaky smile. "I promise Harry, we're here for you. If you need anything or anyone to talk to, we're here. That's what friends do. Thank you for telling us. Also, you mentioned thanking Draco, I saw him pacing around the library earlier. I just thought he was thinking up more ways to annoy you, but I think I got that wrong. I think he was worrying about you. I love you Harry. I'm glad you're safe now."
"I do," Draco said, but he looked nervous.
"Yes, Master Harry. I deserved that punishment."
Blaise sat in an armchair, crossed his legs and was smiling like the cat who ate the canary.
Draco didn't move, so Harry pointed his wand at Draco and vanished his trousers and underwear. "Come here," he said in a severe voice.
"No," Draco said. "I hate it."
"It's been a lot of work," Harry admitted. "But Draco was eager to try and he's very eager to please now."
"Just not on my face, please."
"No sir," Draco said, "i'm not happy about being a dirty little slut."
"Stand up," Harry ordered.
"Yes," Draco said miserable. "I was kind of hoping."
You're barely done your own food when Master Harry barks, "Girl! Clean our places!"
"Yes, Ma'am," Draco gasped, then he cried out as she pulled the nipple clamps off roughly.
Draco groans, "Oh Harry, babe. I love you too." His face is contorted in pleasure and you're imagining what it feels like to have Harry's cock up your ass. You're sure it's filling and wonderful. You're sure if Harry was fucking your ass, you'd be making the same pleasurable faces as Draco.
"The punishment cages are for subs who've done something really wrong. The Doms will put them in, and almost anything goes. Any dom can go in and punish these subs how they see fit. You know, safe words are still respected."
"Now," Draco said. "You two are going to sit here and think about your behavior."
"I thought that's they type of thinking we've been trying to spank out of you. I thought it was working."
"Fourth. You need to be reminded of what a filthy slut you are." Draco pulled out a pen with body ink on it and got to work. You looked down as he wrote the word SLUT in large letters across your enormous tits. Harry took the pen and wrote FILTHY WHORE on your stomach. They hand you the pen and order you to write something on your thighs, so when you look down, you're reminded of what you did. You think for a moment and on one thigh you write CUNT WHORE and on the other one you write WORTHLESS SLUT. The Masters nod in satisfaction.
"Yes Master."
Blaise flopped on the bed and Harry climbed on top of him, kissing him deeply. They were still clothed, and kissing deeply on the bed when Draco walked in. He didn't say anything, but stood in the doorway, awaiting his order. "Go sit in the chair and watch us," Harry ordered.
She inhaled quickly. "I sassed him. I disagreed with him in public. I started a fight over dinner."
At one point, you shift a little and Draco notices. He leans over and smacks you on your bruised backside one time. You yelp in surprise. "Footstools don't squirm," he says angrily.
"Harry is ordering Draco to spank him."
"Go in the belt," Blaise said. "The belt is magically set to detect urine and it vanishes it immediately."
You want to cry because you look at Ronald and you know his bladder must be much bigger than yours. But you set your resolve and hold onto the urine as long as you can.
When they were done with the spanking, the Dom undid Draco's handcuffs and had him kneel in front of him. "You're going to suck my cock."
Draco went to his hands and knees. He may have been expecting another spanking, but instead Harry lubed up his cock and Draco's asshole and carefully spread Draco's tender ass cheeks and fucked him.
Harry nodded, pleased with himself. "Absolutely. I also make him tell me why he deserves his punishment and I'll sometimes give a nice little lecture about his behavior."
Draco swallowed. "Dinner will be done in about twenty minutes."
"Four!" Draco was openly sobbing now.
It was a fast and punishing speed and Harry could barely stand it, how amazing it felt to have his cock wrapped in the tight warmth of his submissive husband's ass. Every breath and every quiver that came from Draco could be felt keenly in Harry's cock. He could feel his balls tighten and he leaned forward, grabbing onto Draco's dripping dick.
"Yes Master Draco," you say and you slip easily between them. You're no sooner on the bed, than Master Harry is snaking his hand up your leg and right to the nest between your legs. His fingers slip into you, gather up some of your juices, which he rubs all around your clit. You gasp at the pleasure.
He looked around and realized that almost the entire crowd of doms had come at nearly the same moment. Two women were still getting their pussies licked and everyone watched as those two women reached their climaxes at the same time.
Harry and Blaise leaned over him. Harry grabbed Draco around the cock, and Blaise cupped his balls gently. They didn't even have to move before Draco was humping frantically and shouting "Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!" Over and over. It took less than twenty seconds and he was coming. He came like he never came before, with a loud wail and semen that shot several feet in the air and landed in his own hair and on the wall behind him. And it didn't stop coming. His dick was like a fountain, spurting beautiful white semen with every stroke for what seemed like an endless amount of time.
You stand up quickly and go to him.
They all stood, whipped out their own cocks, and peed on Draco's legs.
"Yes, Harry."
You stop to think, because what was average with Sir? "Well," you say. "If it was just me there that weekend, I would awaken when he set the alarm for me. I slept in a large cage at the foot of his bed. I would shower and get myself ready for him, which meant in whatever outfit he picked out for me. Often it was leather and tight, sometimes it was nothing at all. Then when a second alarm went off, I got into bed and awoke him with my mouth on his cock. I sucked him off until he was fully awake and he would come. He sometimes had to work in his office and I would be there as decoration, sometimes I had to masturbate in front of him. He rarely allowed me to come. When work wasn't going well, he would have me do physical tasks. He liked to watch me jump rope, he would have me stand in the corner. He spanked me often. Sometimes he would just ignore me. But he also would call me names and humiliate me. If there were other subs there that weekend, he would choose one of us who would get it the worst and we would be kicked around, slapped around and told we were worthless. And always, I had to be ready to do whatever he wanted."
Draco, on shaking legs, pulled his pants off. "I'm sorry Harry," he said. "I'm so sorry, we weren't thinking. We just had time while the chicken cooked-"
"Yes please," he says. You really want him to call you girl, but you are the sub and you can't order him to do that.
The alarm goes off early and you rise, remembering all over again the humiliation of your diaper. You tiptoe quietly out of the bedroom. It takes everything in your power to walk past the bathroom. You want to use the toilet, but you know you musn't. You look down and see the writing on your legs reminding you what a worthless cunt you are and you strengthen your resolve to be the best little submissive sex slave Harry and Draco could expect.
"Oh! I'm sorry Master Harry!"
_______
"God," Harry breathed.
Draco looked stunned. He'd never been hit across the face and he glanced at Harry. Harry didn't think a little face slap was so bad and wasn't going to put a stop to it. He had to admit, last night after seeing Amy and Draco fucking, he'd almost slapped Draco across the face.
Draco sits up quickly, "What did you call me?"
Draco obeyed on shaking legs.
She falls to the side and lays there, legs splayed open for a few moments while she catches her breath.
Harry was beginning to wonder if that was it - if that was his life as a disciplinarian. One major misbehavior from his submissive husband and his attitude had improved that much? Not that Harry was looking for a reason to give another spanking, Gods that had made him nervous as hell before, but he wanted to try it again. Still, rules were rules and he wasn't going to actually hit his husband unless he flagrantly broke one of their ten written rules.
Draco grinned slowly, as his hands made their way down his front and to the button of his trousers. He unbuttoned and unzipped, and gods he was going so slowly that Harry knew he was being seduced. Draco started to work his trousers down his hips, but Harry couldn't take the wait. He leaned over and yanked the trousers and underpants beneath down and turned Draco around. His ass was perfect and white - not a mark on it.
"No sir. Not without permission."
"Yes I do!" Draco said. "Four!"
This sex club would definitely be a thing they did more frequently.
Still, you think your meal is pretty good, and you're pleased to serve it to your Masters in the dining room. They seem happy with it to and Master Harry even says, "Girl, you said you didn't cook very well, but this is very find indeed."
Harry face fucked Draco, slowly and gently at first, but as he got closer to orgasm, it became harder and more urgent. Harry had no problems coming twice (or more) in a night and this particular night had been so electric with sex He could barely hold on. He thrust harder and harder down Draco's willing throat and finally he came, his semen spilling down Draco's throat, which he swallowed no problem.
WHACK, "Nine!" WHACK, "Ten!" and WHACK "Eleven!" The last three swats were, indeed, faster, but they were also with almost all of Harry strength. Silent tears were running down Draco's face.
"Ok," Harry said. "I want you to lie on the bed."
Draco was full on humping his hand as he watched his husband's cock inside his best friend's mouth. And oh, but this was a deserved torture for Draco. He deserved every minutes of this weekend for not obeying his husband. He was a submissive and being submissive MEANT something. It meant to bow down to HArry's will and trust that Harry would know and do what was best for him. Of course he should have asked about the allowance. it was so obvious now. Not asking only showed that he didn't trust Harry, and that was something he never wanted Harry to feel again. That his own submissive husband didn't trust his authority and wouldn't do what was right for him.
They waited a moment, and Draco said, "No sirs. I'm not going to say it. I can handle more."
Harry moaned in pleasure. My god it was huge and it felt absolutely stunning to have his ass that full of another man's cock.
"How are you finding it?"
"Are these rules difficult to understand?" Harry asked.
"Make me come," Harry said.
You hang your head in shame, "I'm sorry Master Draco, Master Harry."
Draco smacks you on the leg, not too hard but just enough to sting. "Honesty."
As he was coming, pearly and white in Blaise's hand, Blaise let out an "Oh Fuck yes!" as he thrust into Harry as hard as he could and his own orgasm released.
"Look at poor Draco," Harry taunted. "I think he deserves a spanking."
Draco was lying face up, his entire body spotted with his own come, but a long lazy smile was spread across his face.
The two of them had to sit and watch while Harry and Ted took their time in bed. Their clothes came off slowly, their was a lot of slow langorious kissing, fondling of each other's cocks without jerking quickly. As much as Harry just wanted to bury his cock inside Ted's ass, he knew forcing Amy and Draco to watch with no way of allowing them to touch themselves was a delicious torture for them. Not to mention, making them sit on the hard wooden chairs on their beautifully bruised behinds was something of a marvel.
"If anyone says anything to you, tell me. I don't think they will though. Just be yourself Harry, I will keep you safe from all the meanies in the world." Snape said with a gentle tickle to Harry's side.
Harry felt the grin slide off of his face. "No reason Malfoy. Let's go hand it in." They both filled up a vial and marked it, and left it on Snape's desk. As they were walking past Neville's cauldron on the way back, they heard an ominous hissing sound. Harry made eye contact and immediately understood the situation. He yelled at everyone to get down, but Malfoy was too busy gloating about the perfect potion to anyone that would listen. Taking a deep breath, Harry flung himself at Malfoy, knocking him down to the ground, getting the full blast of the potion when it exploded.
Dumbledore's eyes held a twinkle in them. "My boy, I've always known."
Snape and Harry walked away from her, headed towards the elevator. Harry hesitated. "Hey dad? Can I press the button?"
As Harry was about to protest, the cool female voice spoke. "Ministry of Magic, Level Four. Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures."
"Wait... How did Harry even notice when you didn't?? You sit with me every day!" Draco shifted the attention to Harry. He had just started noticing everyone was using each others first names and it was throwing him off.
"Why are you here Malfoy?" Harry's voice was slowly gaining strength.
"Well, you might, if you weren't so busy staring after Zabini."
Harry chuckled slightly at that, and got up. He made sure he had his bag and headed down to the Quidditch Pitch to wait for everyone. Based on the time, Malfoy should be there soon. He grabbed his broom, deciding to fly for a bit to kill time. He was just mounting it when a voice by his ear startled him.
"Wait! You don't have any way of not being seen!" Harry looked worried, but Draco just smiled.
The child scrambled to his feet, running to a door under the staircase. He quickly pulled it open, before throwing himself on his cot, obviously fearing a beating.
"Yes. You won't have to go back there ever."
"Harry, have you used floo powder before?" Snape turned to look to the boy, who was still clutching his hand.
The man slowly started to smirk. He threw down his mug, making it shatter on the floor right next to the child. "Freak! You missed a spot." He leaned down next to the child, his face scarily close. "Clean it up, freak."
"Draco, stop pacing! Do you really think that will help Harry?" Blaise's voice rang out in the otherwise quiet room, apart from Draco's shoes hitting the floor.
"Can we sit down? I must have been walking for a while, my legs are sore." Harry gave a wary smile.
"I'm not sure. I just walked around the castle, and ended up lost in the dungeon." Harry was blushing, Draco had forgotten to let go of his hand. "Er... Draco?"
Harry cast a wary glance to those around him, who smiled sympathetically. He then followed the professor, who surprisingly was walking slow enough for him to keep up. Harry studied his face. He looked tense, and Harry was immediately on guard. The worst attacks came when Uncle Vernon had a rough day. His hand clenched on his wand.
Harry nodded. "Do I call him by Blaise or Zabini?"
"I will talk to Professor Dumbledore in the morning. He will do something about it." Despite him saying that, a heavy doubt settled across his features. He knew Dumbledore had checked up on Harry. "Draco, I want you to go back to your dormitory and try to rest for a few more hours. The moment the sun comes up, I'm going to speak to the Headmaster."
"This is what you deserve for being a freak, boy. I'm going to beat this out of you. Then you can stay around and be my toy forever because they won't want you if you aren't a freak." Vernon's voice was sickening, and he hit Harry harder. "They don't want you now, but they are stuck with you, just like I am."
"You mean I still get to go? I thought since you were feeding me that would be it. You have already spent enough money on me today." Harry looked at the professor in confusion.
Both of the grown men chuckled at that. Saxton opened up the pot and grabbed a bit of cotton, dipping it into the substance. "Okay, deep breath Harry. This will hurt a little." He waited for Harry's nod of consent before gently dabbing the medicine onto his wounds. Harry visibly tensed up underneath him, but not a sound was heard. Saxton frowned but kept his mind on his task. He knew Harry was being quiet due to his upbringing. He personally knew it wasn't pleasant, and it did hurt a bit. "Okay Harry. All done."
"I cannot believe you! I'm not going to stand for this. You're supposed to be the leader of the light, but you are worse than the Dark Lord! Since it has been made apparent that you cannot be trusted, I will be taking matters into my own hands. But first, how long have you known. How long have you known that this boy has been treated that way?"
"I-I wanted to thank you, for knocking me out of the way." Malfoy's face had a faint tinge of pink. "I also wanted to make sure you were okay. I actually enjoyed working with you in class today. You made a better partner than I expected. How come you never do that well in class with anyone else?"
Behind Draco, Blaise and Pansy watched on, unsure if Harry would want to see them too. Pansy cautiously spoke up. "Hi Harry. How are you feeling?"
Harry stood up. "Off. I don't gotta hide anymore." He smiled at Snape. "Lets go!! I'm gonna have a family!" He grabbed Snape's hand. "How are we getting to the Ministry?"
"Today we will be making a Mimic Potion. If brewed correctly, the user will repeat everything said for three hours. If brewed incorrectly, the consequences may be.... severe. This is a simple potion, and I expect even the most dimwitted of you all shall be able to brew it properly." Snape's eyes lingered on Harry, Ron, and Neville. "We are going to make this potion in pairs. Potter, you're with Malfoy." Ignoring the strangled protests, he continued on. "Zabini, with Parkinson.Weasley, you're with Bulstrode. Longbottom, with Granger." He then continued to pair up the rest of the class.
Draco looked at all the sincere faces around him. He knew he had a problem, he just didn't know why Harry cared. "Fine. I have a problem. I've become obsessed with apples for some reason. I will quit taking so many. I will cut back to three a day. That way there will be enough for everyone else. Does that work?"
Harry jumped on the subject change. "Yes, I'm safe, and yeah, Snape is my dad now. He knew the only way to keep me safe was if I was his son. He's the one who got me help. He's the reason I don't have to hide anymore."
Draco understood the dismissal. "Goodnight." He returned to his bed, leaving Snape simmering in thoughts until daybreak.
"Wait a minute. Potter. How on earth did you manage to notice that? I sit next to him every day, don't you think I would've noticed that?" Pansy was incredulous.
Harry sighed in understanding. "Neville, if you ever need anyone to talk to I'm here. It doesn't matter if I'm with Ron or Hermione or anyone else. You're more important than them. You can trust me. I know what you're going through." After that, there was a heavy silence.
Snape's expression darkened and he nodded. "I'm positive." He then began leading the group towards the elevator. Briefly he wondered what the trio looked like to all who could see them. The terrifying potions professor holding the hand of a small child who is dragging along the intimidating Lucius Malfoy. He had to suppress a small bit of laughter before they got in the elevator. Turning to Lucius, he raised his eyebrow. It was obvious that Lucius had the same thought he did.
Harry sighed, knowing he had no escape. "I had a bad dream, and when I woke up I just needed out. Walking helps me forget." He pushed himself further into the chair, trying to avoid Draco's gaze.
Pansy turned a shade of pink and looked away sheepishly. "I was headed to ask Professor Snape for some help in the potions work this morning and I heard him talking to Harry. It made sense though. I honestly wasn't too surprised."
"Draco, stop pacing." Pansy said, looking up. She noticed the small child in Snape's arms pretty quickly. Draco ignored her, almost speeding up. "Draco, seriously. Just stop and look up. Professor Snape is right there!"
Ron nodded, satisfied with that answer. "Harry, is it alright if we head up to bed? I want you to have some time with your father, and Ma-Draco tonight." He caught himself. He knew Harry needed as many friends as he could get, as much love as possible. He didn't want Harry to worry about what they thought about Draco, if he helped Harry, he was good in his books. Hermione felt the same way.
Almost immediately after Snape and Harry entered the castle, they were accosted by Hermione and Ron, who appeared frantic.
After Snape filled out the forms, both he and Harry were required to sign them. As Harry finished his signature, a small flurry of blue sparks swirled around them, signalling it official.
"Master Draco? Oh! And Master Harry! What can I be doing for the two of you?" Dobby swept into a deep bow, nearly reaching the the floor.
Draco kneeled next to him. "I'm sorry Harry, I should've thought. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise." He slowly raised his hand, watching Harry for reactions. Harry stiffened, until he felt a gentle touch on the top of his head. Draco ran his fingers absentmindedly through the boy's hair.
Dang, this chapter took forever! Sorry about that! I had a lot going on. Finally got out of the depressive slump I was in, but then I ended up bursting a tendon in my foot that I had surgery in, and was in a lot of pain and just wanted to sleep. I'm currently working on the deage Harry Potter/Neville Longbottom fanfic I've been dreaming about. I will be posting the first chapter of that soon! My birthday is on July 21st and my next surgery is on the 3rd of August, so there will be a small lapse in the hopefully more common updates. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope you enjoy!
Pansy flushed, her face turning a shade of red to rival Ron's. "I don't stare at Blaise! And... Hey! You didn't answer my question! Why did you manage to notice that Draco has a serious apple obsession? Wait... have you been watching him?" Pansy's grin widened, happy to be able to throw off the Golden Boy.
Snape studied Harry for a moment. "No. This offer is entirely serious. I want to adopt you. I don't want you to go back to that house. Ever."
"I... may have been observing you?" It nearly sounded like a question, the way he said it. His face was tinged with red. "After a while I started noticing it. I started getting worried when I realized it had gotten to the point where there were literally no apples left in the castle. I even checked the kitchens."
Snape knelt down next to Harry. "I'm so proud of you. You are incredibly brave. I wanted to thank you Harry. You gave me a chance even though I haven't been the nicest to you before. I never really realized how I must have seemed to everyone, and I have to thank Ronald for making me aware of that. I promise Harry, I'm going to try to be the best dad for you. You really do deserve the best." Snape ran his hands through his son's unruly hair.
Ron stopped for a second, and gave a wary gaze towards Snape. "Don't hurt him. You've been mean to us for years. I don't want my best mate to go through anything like what he did again."
Hello all! I'm still alive, surprisingly! I'm just horrible at updating, a lot has been going on. I no longer have a boyfriend, I have a fiance! Moving in with him soon, so I won't be around much. I love you all, and hope that you all will give me time to write a new chapter! Sorry my updates are all over the place!
The two quickly reached the door they were told to go to. Snape reached out his hand, but before he could knock, the door swung open.
"Draco, you have a serious apple addiction. Harry pointed it out to me. You always have an apple on you. Normally that wouldn't be too bad, but you've started taking all of them for yourself. None of the other students can have any because of your problem." Pansy's voice rang out, stern.
"Haven't you noticed? The school hasn't had a single green apple for about a year, and the only one ever seen eating them is Malfoy! He has a serious problem."
"Harry, we could never hate you. You're our friend, and friends stick together. Thank you so much for telling us. Goodnight, Harry." With that, Hermione and Ron headed off to the dormitory.
"It has come to my knowledge that Harry Potter has been abused by his family." His voice was blunt, and his eyes icy. "What are you going to do about that."
Saxton sat down behind his desk, and quickly drained the vial of the contents. Immediately the room began turning black. The room disappeared, and in front of him, a new scenery began to form.
"Harry, you will never be too much work. You need to actually be able to be a child, and live life happily. And it doesn't matter if you're annoying. You will still be my son. That is, if you say yes."
"You better not mess this simple potion up, Potter. I'm not taking a failing grade for you."  Malfoy opened the book to the required page. "Go get the ingredients, Potter. Surely even you can do that correctly."
"Potter. Get off me!" Malfoy struggled to push the limp body off of him. "Potter! Potter! Harry!! Get up!" Malfoy was getting frustrated with him, until he realized Harry wasn't responding. "Professor! Get over here! Something's wrong with him!"
"Of course, Harry. I will always stand by my word." With that, Snape led Harry to the Three Broomsticks and walked in, heading straight for the table he always used.
Snape had to hide a small smile. "Of course Harry. Fourth floor."
Harry knelt by the grave,  his hands gently wrapping around the statue of his parents. "I miss you guys. I think about you every day. Thank you for saving me, and thank you for loving me." His eyes were overflowing with tears, and his voice was cracking miserably as he struggled to hold in the sobs that were threatening to break free. "I love you mum. I love you dad."
"One second Harry. Let me grab the one that allows me to enter your mind." Saxton rummaged through the desk, coming up with a dark brown potion. "Here we are. Do I have both of your consent for this?" He turned to the duo. Upon receiving nods from them, he gestured to Harry. "Go ahead and drink that. It doesn't taste pleasant unfortunately, so best to get it down in one go."
Snape led Harry into the room, sitting him down in a comfy chair in front of the man. "My name is Severus Snape, and this is Harry Snape. I just adopted him today. He was from an abusive household and we want to assess the mental damage done." Snape continued standing.
Saxton examined the lash marks quietly. "Harry, when was the last time you were beat?"
Harry grinned and pressed the button, laughing slightly at the noise it made. The elevator slowly rose, and Harry started to grow worried. "Dad, what if they can't fix me?"
Harry slipped his shirt on, wincing when it hit his back. He sat back down, not bothering to reapply the glamours. "Okay Professor. I'm listening."
Saxton stood up and walked over towards him. "Harry, can I see your back please? I won't touch it, I just want to see how bad the damage is."
Severus nodded. "I promised you we would go, and I keep my promises. Are you ready Harry?"
"Nightmares again? Be careful, Filch was seen in this area a little bit ago." She bid him farewell as he left. She had begun to grow fond of him, as he almost always chatted with her.
Neville managed a weak nod. "I'm fine. Just... It's nothing. I'm fine." Neville caught himself, mentally berating himself for almost telling him. They made him swear not to tell.
I'm sorry for it being so long since my last update. On brighter news, my spouse and I found a stray kitten while walking our puppy, and we raised it from 3 weeks and now our animals are great friends. In times like these, I find myself relying on them to put a smile on my face. I hope this chapter puts a smile on yours.
Severus was close to killing someone. He took a deep breath, he needed to be calm for Harry's sake. "Harry, can you please show me your back? I won't hurt you, I promise."
Draco paced endlessly around his dormitory, wondering what happened to Harry. Blaise, who had long given up on trying to get any information out of the boy, watched with slight frustration.
"After classes. I don't really fancy you visiting me twice in one day, Mister Potter. While I do enjoy the company, you are in here way too much. I still don't know how you end up here so often, especially on the first day back at school. I still find it hard to believe you fell down stairs at your home while bringing your trunk down." She was reminiscing, and didn't notice Harry's face go dark. Harry knew she would become suspicious after a while.
I know, I know, that took forever! Been a busy year! Got married, came out as trans after literal years in denial, moved back to Oklahoma, and now things have finally settled down. I'm sorry it took so long, but I should hopefully be able to update more often! I hope you all enjoyed the chapter. I love you all!
"I won't tell anyone. You told Snape, correct?" Upon receiving a brisk nod from Draco, Blaise continued. "I trust that your godfather will do everything he can to keep Harry safe." Blaise paused, thinking. He was filled with a rage he'd never felt before. However, he knew he had to be calm. He wouldn't stand for abuse in any situation. Blaise agreed with Draco, the headmaster knew everything, which means he knew about what was happening to Harry. He turned towards Draco and took a breath. "What's the plan Draco?"
The pug-faced girl halted, and looked around. "Potter? What do you want?" Sneering, she walked over to where he was hiding.
Saxton, who had witnessed the entire scene, was as pale as a ghost. He knew Harry had gone through so much more than this, but this scene sickened him. Harry was slumped on the floor, a sickly green color. Saxton peered closer, and noticed how dead inside he had seemed. There was no life left in those eyes, no more fight. It was as if all hope had been sucked out of the child. Knowing the horrific memory was over, he drank a grey potion he had stored in his pocket, pulling him back into the present.
"Okay! C'mon! We gotta go to the fourth level now!" Harry grabbed Lucius's hand as well.
Harry was deposited on a bed in the infirmary, and Madam Pomfrey bustled out of her room, demanding to know what happened. Snape immediately filled her in. He then proceeded to ask to be excused, as he had to go clean up the classroom. Malfoy, however, stayed behind.
The two walked up to the house, which was utterly destroyed by the killing curse that failed to kill Harry. Harry instinctively grabbed Severus's hand, seeking comfort. "Is there any chance we can go in?"
"Okay, well how about this time I will pick you up so we both can go at the same time, and neither of us get lost?"
"Do not worry. I will not attack you. I promise. Follow me in here." He had stopped at the door to his office, holding it open for Harry, who walked in as if approaching his death. He waited until Harry had sat down before he started. "Potter, It has come to my knowledge that you have been abused at home. I want you to know that your family cannot hurt you in this castle, so you need not be afraid of anything said here. If they try to hurt you, I will protect you. I wish for you to tell me what happened. Take your time. I have calming droughts if you need one."
"Thank you daddy! I'm gonna be the bestest boy ever!"
"Whichever works better. Oh, look! There they are!" She stood on her tiptoes, waving to them, despite the fact that she was standing in the middle of an empty pitch and they could see her just fine without the extra height. She waved them over, and grinned.
Harry looked at Snape in hopeful confusion. "Dad, I'm way too old to color."
I'm gonna be honest. I was never expecting people to like this. I was just writing for something to do. It makes me so happy to have people enjoy this. Thank you for reading!!
Harry woke up, rubbing his eyes. Madam Pomfrey noticed and rushed over to him, checking his vitals again.
"You idiotic boy! It was newt eyes! Malfoy, help me get him to the hospital wing. Everyone else, bottle up your potions and put them on my desk. Granger, please put the exploded potion in one as well, just in case we need to identify it." With that, Harry was supported by Malfoy and Snape and swept out of the room. Ron made eye contact with Hermione. "Was it just me or did Malfoy seem worried to you?"
Draco and Blaise looked at each other in awe, then turned back to their friend. Draco quickly told her the plan, and she nodded firmly. "Are we all in agreement? We're going to protect Harry from the so called light side." Upon receiving another nod, Draco grimaced. "I just wish we didn't need to protect him."
Harry nodded, and took Severus's hand, helping him to his feet. "Let's go."
Lucius quickly maneuvered them out. "The Being division should be just around the corner. That is where we are going to get everything set in place. I can pull some strings and make it impossible for Dumbledore to meddle in this. Trust me, he will try. At this point, we shouldn't trust anyone on the supposed light side." The group turned a corner and knocked on a door titled Wizarding Adoption Services. He walked inside after hearing a quiet greeting. "Hello Madam Parkinson. I need your help. Severus here would like to adopt Harry Potter. He had discovered the boy was horribly abused and Dumbledore knew that all along."
Harry turned to Snape for reassurance. Upon seeing that he was still there, he turned back to the mind healer. "My parents were killed when I was a baby. I was put in my aunt and uncle's care, if you could call it that. Food was withheld from me from the beginning. My Uncle Vernon started beating me when I was three. He started teaching my cousin Dudley to beat me too. That continued until I was five, when he decided that it wasn't enough. He got a whip and would whip me if I messed up, which I did often. I would be whipped multiple times a day sometimes. I learned quickly that if I made any noise during the punishments that they would get much worse. When I was seven... my uncle raped me." Harry paused, clenching his fists. "All of that continued up until Hogwarts. Towards the end of my first year, I asked... er... begged Dumbledore to let me leave my aunt and uncle's forever. He told me he had to stay there for the greater good, whatever that meant. When I had gone home my uncle somehow knew I had asked for help from someone, and I got beat so much worse than before. He had poured bleach on my back. I got sick, but never got taken to the hospital, because then they would've known. I somehow managed to make it back to the school alive, but I was in bad condition. Madam Pomfrey fixed me up. She doesn't know what actually happened. I had to lie to her. The summer after my second year wasn't much worse than normal, because I left early. My uncle's sister visited, and she had insulted my parents. I accidentally blew her up... I ran because I was afraid of what would happen to me if I stayed." Harry paused, thinking. "I think that is the basics. Oh, most of the whipping was done to my back."
After waiting a brief period of time, Harry snuck out and headed down to his first class of the day. Walking into the Potions classroom, he sat down next to Ron and Hermione.
The duo arrived in Hogsmeade with a snap. Snape looked over at Harry, who was looking around with awe.
"I don't have any apples on me this time! See!" He held his hands out. He thought he got away with the lie until Blaise opened his bag.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry gaped at his professor. Surely he was delirious. "Snape, did someone slip a delirium potion into your morning tea?"
"I see." Saxton turned to Harry. "Do you mind telling me what happened in that place?"
Severus carefully led them out of the building, Harry keeping his hand in his pocket around his parent's items. As they made their way to the graveyard, he marveled at the fact that those items were still there after all that time, just waiting for him. It was like his parents knew he was going to be back. Before he knew it, they were standing at the edge of the graveyard.
Within moments after they sat down, a witch appeared with a note pad. "Hello Professor Snape! What can I get for you and this little boy here?"
It was Harry who spoke first. "Draco, this is an intervention. I noticed you had an addiction, I asked Pansy for help. She and Blaise agreed to help me help you." His voice was confident.
"I believe he will. I believe he just got knocked out. The potion exploded, right?"
Pansy stood and bid the others a farewell, as she had a little bit of homework left to complete, and ran to her dormitory, leaving the boys in an uncomfortable silence. They were both certain she had actually left because she was about to cry. Pansy may appear blunt and heartless, but they knew she cared deeply about all of her friends, and Harry had quickly made his place as one.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I... I may have been... observing?" Harry quickly turned his head, avoiding eye contact.
"Yes it does Harry. We just have to go make it official. I have a few friends that can go around Dumbledore's head for this. Then you will be my son." He spared a small smile for him. This boy had been through so much, and he had no one he could turn to. He was grateful for Draco bringing this to his attention. "Come on. Do you want to leave the glamours off or have me put them back on?"
Madam Parkinson turned to Harry and smiled. "Harry, you're now safe. Your father will protect you." Turning to Snape, she spoke. "I would recommend taking him to Mungos to see how bad the damage is. He appears to have gotten back to his actual age for the time being, so now would be a great time to do it. I'm going to go ahead and set up a few protection spells to prevent Dumbledore from meddling like he always does. You are free to go."
Harry stopped, and looked at Snape. "Really? Do you mean it? Please dad, please!" Harry was practically bouncing with excitement.
"C'mon Harry. Let's get you back to your common room." He stood up and held out his hand to help Harry up. He had noticed Harry was acting a bit different then normal, like he was younger. Harry took his hand and stood up, but didn't let go. Draco didn't mind. The duo quietly left the kitchen, slowly walking to the Fat Lady's portrait. When they arrived, Harry said the password and climbed inside the hole.
Harry blushed, never having felt that kind of affection before. He soaked it up. It made him feel safe. He slowly opened his eyes, only to see Draco's looking at him. He smiled a kind smile.
"Some of them are bleeding." He walked over towards his desk and pulled out two vials of a potion, one blue and one magenta, as well as a pot of a strange green substance. "Okay Harry, right here I have a few potions. The blue one is a pain relieving potion, and the magenta is a potion that will allow me to view the abuse while keeping your mind elsewhere, so you don't have to see it when I'm there." He gave Harry the blue potion. "Best take that now, I'm going to clean and heal up the gashes on your back to avoid any infections."
Snape nodded solemnly. "I know. I'm sorry for my past actions. I can't change the past, but I can change how I act in the future. I want to be nice to my students. I don't want anyone to be afraid to reach out to me if they need help. Thank you for holding me accountable, Ronald. Please feel free to tell me if I slip back into my old ways. I want to change for the better."
