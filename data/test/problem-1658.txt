“Oh! Er...yeah, sure. No problem.”
“Who says he can’t be here?” Harry began to get angry, and Draco put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, trying to steer him out of the pub.
Mr. Burke gave Draco a solid pat on the shoulder, making Draco have to suppress a shudder. “Of course,” he said, standing up straight as a Malfoy should.
. All of sixth year, he nearly hoped someone would notice what he was trying to do and put a stop to it. Now that he wasn’t doing anything, he was being accused. It was a horrendous way of the universe balancing.
“I’d love to send him a letter, see if an owl can find him.” Draco added.
. Draco had forgot about that entire mess. How many things was he going to have to keep track of? “I mean, of course I care since it affects you. But what I’m saying is, even if he finds out, even if it gets all over the Prophet, I still want to be with you. The last time I ended the relationship, it wasn’t really my choice. It was out of necessity, I mean who has time for all that when—well, anyway, if I’m going to end things with you it’s going to be because I want to. And right now, I don’t want to.”
finds out though, that’ll be a little bit different.”
He glanced down at his hand touching Harry’s. Though he could barely feel it physically, it warmed him inside. He was different now. “Hagrid,” Draco said suddenly. “Thank you for last night. I really appreciate it.”
Draco knew what his mother was trying to bring up.
“I feel like I won,” Harry said with a smirk.
“Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy,” Madam Hale’s voice boomed from behind the podium where she sat. “You are charged with obstruction of justice, tampering with the investigation of known Death Eaters such as Dolohov, Nott, the Carrows, and others. How do you plead?”
“I won’t go on, but the next year was the worst of my life. There is no way I would want to bring the Dark Lord back through that Time Turner. I would rather have a universe ruled only by Muggleborns than by him. I promise. I don’t know who sent me the Time Turner or why, but I want nothing more than to have it destroyed.” He finally looked up. Some people were glaring about him, surely feeling like he was making himself a victim, which was not his intent. But others looked relieved that he seemed to have no nefarious plot. The older students held his gaze evenly, not betraying anything with their eyes.
“You guys were out there a long time. What, are you becoming friends with Potter or something?” Blaise asked teasingly.
Draco finds out exactly what Harry has in store for him.
“Don’t be discouraged—that’s completely normal. We’ll keep trying, and you’ll get it somehow.”
“We’re just friends, Mother. I just wanted to get out for some air. That’s all.”
She leaned back in her chair. “Then I will not be able to let you continue to attend this school as a student.”
Narcissa sighed. “He came to our home—“
“Draco, look at me for a moment,” Harry said, his tone serious. Draco met his intense gaze. “I want you to know that you’re...I was going to say a totally different person, but that’s not it. It’s like you’ve kept all the best parts of the Draco Malfoy I knew and got rid of the little git inside. You’re still just as funny and witty, but you’re so much more kind and open. And that’s a good thing. You’re still you.”
Draco stared at her blankly. Didn’t he just say what he needed help with? “Um...with what I just told you?”
“I don’t know the exact parameters of that,” Harry said, gesturing to Draco’s manacle. “I don’t want to set off any alarm bells at the Ministry. We’re not too far away.”
“It—doesn’t matter.” Draco didn’t want to admit that it was his Aunt Bellatrix who taught him Occlumency, and that she was actually a fantastic teacher. The only fault of hers, in Draco’s opinion, was excessive punishment. “Okay, take a deep breath and close your eyes.”
“What? No, of course not. This is what friends do.”
He sighed. “Fine, I guess you’re right. We need to be a team.” He looked back at Draco. “I kind of understand what you’re saying. It’s just really overwhelming sometimes, you know? How much we did...”
“I can’t.”
Draco found that his heart was pounding as he and Harry walked to the train. “It’s um—“ he suddenly started, much louder than he intended. Harry looked at him, startled. Draco cleared his throat to try again. “It’s nice outside. Not...not too cold for October.”
. Draco slapped his hands on his thighs in frustration.
“Draco? You’re back!” Myrtle came swooping down, sending cold air through the already shaking Draco. “And crying again. What’s wrong now?”
a memory, let it fill you up inside. Instead of trying to shove everything down like you do when you empty your mind, you have to puff everything up. So, what are some of your happiest memories?”
“Oh, good,” Draco was relieved. “I would never do that, I swear. You heard me tell Weasley the other day, I’m around you because I want to be, I—“
“You didn’t have to come out here, I’m alright.”
Draco gave a rare genuine smile at that one. “I do, too.”
“Potter told us that you visited your parents today. You weren’t going to tell us about that?”
“Yeah, you’ve never been there before?” Draco hadn’t. It never would have occurred to him to interact with house elves—he saw enough of the abuse that Dobby took from his father. He didn’t want to be rude to house elves like Lucius, but he didn’t know what level of civility they deserved either.
“So I have to, what, sweet talk the house?”
Draco thought for a moment. A one-word response seemed insufficient for this type of communication.
“Ah, fantastic. I’m sure he’ll be delighted to see you. If you all could just stick out a hand for me—“ she pulled out a wand and begin doing diagnostics on the group, presumably checking for any hidden spells or glamours. She got to Draco last, and he outstretched his right arm. “Let me just check one thing really quickly,” she said, frowning and walking away.
Draco shifted in his seat. “I...I dunno. I think it’s best that he doesn’t get to know me. Wouldn’t want to corrupt him.”
His second concern was his final presentation in Defense Against the Dark Arts before the break. He still had failed to produce a full Patronus. The closest he had come, despite Harry’s amazing teachings, was the faint outline of some sort of creature. It was merely a whisp, and Draco couldn’t even ascertain what sort of an animal it was going to be. Draco did not want his poor performance to reflect badly on Harry, but his boyfriend did not seem concerned.
The journey to Hogsmeade was quite casual. Draco was silent for most of the way, and no one even mentioned his incident the previous night. The three Gryffindors chatted happily as the train pulled into the Hogsmeade station. The village was serene, with only a few shoppers milling about, and no one paying any attention to Draco or Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smiled. “I’m glad it wasn’t, it seems you’re in attack mode today. Can I walk with you?”
“You do! Oh, we knew it. You’ve been in a much better mood lately. But who?”
Draco’s first day back at school comes with a return to Defense Against the Dark Arts, and a disturbing new project...
The Great Hall was a stark contrast to how gloomy it had been the year prior. Everything was bright, warm, and welcoming. There were candles lit everywhere, and the fake sky above reflected a clear night with glimmering constellations. Most students looked almost giddy with relief, glad that the return didn’t seem as daunting as it had in the bleak summer months. Ghosts roamed the tables and joked with the students—last year they had steered clear of everyone under Professor Snape’s orders. Happy chatter and laughter filled the air, which was bursting with hope for a new year.
“Merlin, Draco, can you just be normal for one second? I’m not going to tell anyone what happened. We’re going to be roommates and therefore I care about your safety.”
“—my mum said if you need someone to look after the Manor she’d be willing—“
“Harry—I don’t think they want you to know, you can’t—“
“I—I just don’t know why I bother, no one is ever going to forgive me for anything. I don’t deserve for anyone to forgive me, I—“
Harry seemed sure about this and Draco didn’t want to discourage him so soon after he had agreed to let Draco take him on a date, so Draco slept alone. But he was not happy about it—with his parents’ trial in a matter of days, he was feeling more anxious than ever. He hoped after Saturday, Harry would agree to share his bed in the nights leading up to his next appearance before the Wizengamot.
Draco felt guilt settle deep inside of him. Though he couldn’t fault himself for Tonks and Remus’s deaths, he knew what Harry was trying to say. Teddy really only had his grandparents, and they were aging as it was. If Draco could show him why having some Black in his blood wasn’t the worst thing, he would do it.
“No,” Greg sniffed. “One thing that we promised each other is that we didn’t want to live half a life. Vince was like that anyway, it was always go big or go home. I just don’t know what I’m going to do with my life now.”
Draco felt a rush of affection for Harry but also a little embarrassed and concerned. He was telling Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom, two powerful individuals with high Ministry standing, that Draco needed to commit a crime tomorrow. Did Harry expect them to not question anything?
Harry stretched and yawned. “When do you want to leave?”
The same wizard who interrupted her before spoke again. “Are you aware that lying to the Wizengamot can land you in Azkaban for life?” Draco clenched his fist at this stranger taking this tone with his mother. He wasn’t sure if he recognized the man from his own trial or not—that entire time period had been such a blur.
Draco nodded and sighed before accepting Harry’s hand to stand up. He washed his mouth out and splashed some water on his face. When he looked in the mirror, he realized how much he had changed. His face was a little pale from the vomiting, but it was full in a way that perfectly accentuated his pointy features. His hair shined more than it had in the past year, and his hands were steady. Things had really improved, and he wasn’t going to let any stress get in the way of what he had accomplished.
“He was being dramatic,” Draco said instantly.
Harry looked mildly offended, and Draco was filled with immediate and burning regret. He didn’t want to ruin the one good part about this day. “If you say so. Let me know if you change your mind.”
Gossip may flitter back and forth, but it always seemed to center around Harry Potter in some way. Draco knew this was only the first of many negative interactions he would have about his relationship in the next few months, and he was already exhausted from it. But, students could be handled, or ignored.
Draco took a quill and wrote “
“Would you come over for Christmas?”
Ginny bit her lip, and Dean stepped forward, placing a hand on her arm. “You need to stay away from Potter,” he said, using Harry’s last name despite them being in the same house.
“I don’t care, you know.”
“No,” Ginny said. “You need to leave.”
Draco wanted to solve that particular mystery, but he had other concerns. A few days before the 31st, it was finally time for Draco to go back to Azkaban to visit his mother. Yarney came to retrieve him as he did before, but this time Draco felt less ill and better prepared. He also was incredibly relieved that he would not be seeing his father today, despite Mr. Burke’s scorn at Draco’s refusal to talk with Lucius.
Draco straightened his robes as the train came to a stop. He made sure he was fully composed before he stepped off the Hogwarts Express with his trunk—hopefully for the last time.
Potter fidgeted with his hands. “After I died...in the forest on that day...Voldemort asked Narcissa to make sure I was truly dead.” This seemed hard for him to talk about, but one look at Draco’s hopeful face and he pressed on. “She bent over—she could tell that I was still breathing. She whispered to me and asked me if you were still alive. I nodded slightly, and then she told Voldemort I was dead.”
“Exactly. So, what’s going on?” Daphne turned her attention to Blaise again.
“Additional resources will be available throughout the year to help all students readjust to a peaceful school environment. But for now, enough chitter-chatter. Let us celebrate Hogwarts in the most traditional way—by welcoming our new first years into one of our four equally prestigious Hogwarts houses.”
“Sasha!” Harry squawked in alarm, flailing with one arm and holding on to the leash and his determined dog with the other. “Sasha! No! Bad girl! Heel!”
Theo announced, wrestling a book off the shelf behind him. He ignored Draco’s groan of protest and thumbed through it. “Fascinating subject, you know. Have you heard of Sun Tzu? He’s my personal hero. I’m certain we’ll find the solution to your little predicament in here.”
“What should I do?” James asked shakily.
“My stupid, reckless boy,” Draco whispered fervently, holding him close but carefully— mindful of James’ injuries. “Thank Merlin you’re safe.”
“Not...not really, no.” He couldn’t do this. He couldn’t
the former Headmaster’s name was case for detention — it took an audacious sort of cunning to dream that up.
Draco startled and even Potter jumped as the entrance slid open again. Weasley stepped out, a broomstick hoisted over one shoulder. He took one look at them and stopped short.
Harry groaned and palmed his face. “Dad,” he moaned. “It’s Saturday.”

be out of options just yet.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Okay, let’s put aside the fact that you’re morally reprehensible for a second. Assuming your little scheme works and Godric and Helena take to each other...”
“He’s never going to hear me out now.”
And Harry. He’d missed Harry too. Now that he was here, flying with him under the light of a thousand stars, he rather wished they’d done this earlier. Just...been with each other. Before things went completely mental.
“Honestly, Harry. I just told you what’s wrong. Now stop crowding him and budge
He would have to thank Pansy later.
“It’s called a ‘busy board’,” Potter explained, and that was definitely humour lighting up his green eyes now. “And from what I saw, it’s working just fine.”
“Ron will be fine with it. I checked with him
“We’re all fine,” Draco added sharply. He gave Potter an icy glance. “Perhaps you should focus more on the movie and less on Finnigan.”
Draco’s shoulders sagged as the last of his ire deflated. He approached the bed and his eyes softened as James shrank back, apparently expecting more harsh words. But Draco was done. He had made his point, loud and clear. What he needed to do now was take care of his son.
James stared, still a little disbelieving, as the ghosts obligingly floated up and away through the ceiling. He crept out of the alcove cautiously. Were they… telling the truth? Was there really a fireplace? What if… but no, the ghosts had no reason to lie to him. If they’d wanted to get him in trouble, all they had to do was get a Prefect.
try Draco’s Pad Thai. I fed some to one of Hagrid’s Fire Salamanders once and it exploded.”
“I’m afraid I have to ask. How long have you been...sexually active?”
“You know perfectly well what you did,” Draco grumbled, rubbing his eyes viciously.
“Father,” Draco greeted stiffly. “Potter.” He raised his chin defiantly, despite the violent blush painting his cheeks.
James cringed and swiped a shaky hand over his face. He hadn’t said much since Draco had arrived. Actually, he hadn’t even looked at his father once during his mumbled explanation, choosing instead to address his sheets. Draco had a feeling that the gravity of the situation was sinking in. Good. He wasn’t letting the boy off the hook that easily though. “Answer me, James,” he ordered in a tone that brooked no argument.
“You... got me all hot and bothered and then you fell asleep again.”
Several things happened at once. The vampire lunged for his victim, Longbottom cursed a blue streak, Thomas flailed and knocked over a glass and Draco screamed in terror, flung his arms around Finnigan and buried his face in his shoulder. He thought he heard Finnigan chuckle but he was too overwrought to bother.
“I know, I missed you too!” Potter said, tickling his tummy and drawing out a happy giggle. “Did you have fun with cousin Draco?”
Hugo took over and sifted through the pile, making
Remus sighed and Sirius smirked and raised a glass. They watched as James disappeared through the fireplace.
him, and why was he always alone?
Of course, being twelve year old boys, they both thought it was hilarious and so they’d spent the remainder of the evening, slowly upping the ante. Mother was gracious enough to ignore them for a large part of it but when Draco’s peas spelled out
“You know, you actually had me worried for a second there,” Potter went on accusingly. “I thought we were past the whole
“Fine.” Potter scoffed and looked away belligerently. “Have at it then.”
“I’m not good with figuring my feelings out,” Potter admitted quietly. “I guess it was just easier for me to pretend we were friends.” Draco’s glare intensified and Potter held his hands up in a gesture of placation. “But I would have worked it out eventually!”
“Can’t fault you for timing,” he muttered, absently drifting a hand over his stomach. Now that he thought about it, he could detect a barely perceptible curve under his touch. How had it escaped his notice before? He was usually so on top of things.
She trailed off. Her eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. Her mouth snapped shut and she looked utterly stricken.
Any further musings were interrupted by a concerned whimper. Draco grunted in discomfort as a seventy pound lab clambered on the couch and proceeded to lavish him in doggy kisses. “William!” he groaned, trying to push away his furry assailant. “
It was the
“It was tolerable,” Draco replied. “He’s alright. You know, for a Weasley.”
Ultimately, Draco’s luck ran out and he found himself cornered in an alcove. Potter loomed over him menacingly, one velvet paw wrapped around his wand. His breath was coming in harsh pants and his green eyes flashed dangerously. Draco swallowed. Trust Potter to look all dangerous and sexy even when clad in a giant bunny costume.

He needed to get out of here. He needed to leave. And he had a plan, he did.
“Are you objecting on moral grounds?” Father demanded with a sneer. “A bit rich for
“How are you feeling?” Potter asked. “That was a nasty tumble.” His eyes flickered to Draco’s bare chest. Draco’s cheeks flushed and he resisted the urge to pull his blankets up. Instead he lifted his chin and met Potter’s gaze steadily.
Ah. Draco nodded in understanding. Children did love playing with the things they saw grownups using, no matter how dull they were. He couldn’t count the number of times Teddy had scampered off with his goblin crafted pocket watch.
“Well, that’s my cue then,” he announced, giving them a terse nod. “Have a good game, Potter. Perhaps we might speak when you’re

“Just a moment, Mr Malfoy.”
“You came.”
“Really?” Grange was the first to speak, and she sounded aghast. “You’re doing this with
Draco smiled. “I love it.”
It was worth the risk, he decided.
Draco raised an eyebrow and a slight smirk played on his lips. Harry had the strangest feeling he wasn’t as scared as he was letting on, but that was fine. If Draco wanted an excuse to stay, Harry sure as hell wasn’t going to deny him. Draco made the decision for both of them. He gave Harry another, somewhat exaggerated glare and settled on the couch. Harry grinned and followed without protest, sliding next to Draco and turning down the lights.
The Snitch quivered in his grip. It’s wings fluttered violently before extending and wrapping all the way around its form. A golden glowing light encased the orb, growing steadily brighter — until it resembled the stars twinkling above them. And then, when the light grew so bright that Harry blinked and Draco was sure he would have to look away, it disappeared. And the Snitch unfurled its wings, revealing itself again.
James started at the soft, cultured voice. He didn’t turn around to look, nor did he react when Draco approached hesitantly, settling beside him on the porch. Honestly, the kid even managed to make slumping on a porch look elegant.
Sirius didn’t look too broken up about it. “Reg

had something halfway decent to say about Malfoy then…
“Mate.” The bloke shook his head slowly, looking over Draco with a hint of concern. “You’re not making any sense. Are you having a stroke or something?”
Weasley took the stairs and The Notice-Me-Not Charm dissipated. Draco heaved a sigh of relief and dragged a shaky hand over his face. Thank Salazar he hadn’t been discovered. He was mortified enough.
to him.
“James.” Father pursed his lips, crouching as close to the fire as he could. “Son, I need you to talk to me, alright? Can you tell me where you are right now?”
He saw it at once. Draco’s lips twitched and he took a deep breath to compose himself.
“Hey! You promised not to peek!”
Molly clucked apologetically. “You just missed the last batch, dear. Why, a second sooner and they’d have been yours.”
“I’m sorry...”
Harry smiled and looped his arms around Draco again, pulling him down on the sofa as well.
.” Potter gave him a gentle shake. “This is really getting to you, isn’t it?” He looked so concerned now, all sweet and strong and oh gods, this was only getting
“What, this?” Harry raised an eyebrow and withdrew the Snitch, turning it in his hands.
Potter stopped short. His nose twitched with sudden surprise. In the spirit of good sportsmanship, Draco did not point out just how rabbit-y he looked. He did double up with laughter though. “Oh, this is good,” he managed between chuckles. “I’ve been trying to get you for a SHAG for ages!”
“We’d be delighted,” Draco smirked. “Now, about my clothes…”
“Against my better judgement, yes,” Draco replied. “I’m that desperate.”
“Potter,” Draco blurted out before he could reconsider. “I want to talk. To you. I mean.”
here, I’ll stake my application for the Headless Hunt on it!”
And James was going to figure his game out if it was the last thing he did.
Finnigan was a lot more forthcoming. He sidled over and swung an arm around Draco’s shoulders. “It’ll be okay, Malfoy,” he purred, brushing bold fingers against Draco’s nape. “I’ll be right here with you through the whole thing.”
“Harry? You out there?”
“I’m not!” Harry protested, grabbing him by the shoulders before he could storm off in a strop. “I’m not, love. I swear. I’m just...I’m

would certainly get Potter’s attention.
Draco snapped defensively. Potter’s lips twitched and he looked like he was valiantly trying to hold back a smile. Draco glared at him. “Well, it doesn’t matter now anyway. You should have said something and you didn’t and it hurt my feelings when you told Weasley we were just friends.”
“I need to go lie down,” Draco mumbled to himself. And to think. If he couldn’t get through to Potter with words...well, he needed to think of something. His fingers twitched involuntarily and he glanced down, belatedly realising that he was still cradling his stomach.
“Draco, listen to me.” Harry pulled him up and cupped his face in gentle hands. “I love you. I want a life with you and our child. This...this is it for me. I know we started a certain way and we have a ton of history to get past, but I’ve known how I feel about you for a really long time. And you will
He shoved the Kindle in his briefcase, picked up his half-finished cup of coffee and got up. It was time to leave anyway. Father wouldn’t appreciate him being late and...
before it was even on air. His whining about the books being out for ages notwithstanding, that was unforgivable. Draco refused to take his calls.
She had a point. He had thought about it and there were any number of ways he could have broken the news to Harry. Instead he’d been on swings and roundabouts, putting it off, weaving and dodging...all because he was scared. The idea of Harry rejecting him, rejecting
Draco smirked and gestured grandly to his new familiar. “Harry, this is Helena.”

sanity. He only had one idea left and if this was it, so be it. He grabbed Weasley’s plate, turned a deaf ear to his protests
“Goodnight, little Malfoy.” Gentle fingers tangle in his hair. “Sleep well.”
Draco’s breathy gasps quickened and moans spilt from his lips as Harry sucked gently at the head of his cock. Draco whined and his hands tightened into Harry’s hair, pushing him further. Harry obliged and took Draco in his throat in one fluid motion.
“What?!”
Enough, already! He was telling Potter. He was telling Potter as soon as he found him. And he knew exactly what he was going to say.
“Definitely the worst metaphor ever.”
Before long, he was out in the open. The goal posts rose high above him, reaching for the stars. It was so quiet out here at night. It was a strange look for a place usually thronging with screaming crowds and flying banners. Draco took a deep breath to steady himself. His hand drifted to his stomach again, and he allowed himself a moment’s distraction. It was still too soon but...sometimes, he could almost feel something shift under his fingertips. Like the baby was reaching out to him too. It was a soothing thought and it made him smile. At least he wasn’t alone.
“Um, hello?”
James stared, baffled as the Friar gave his friend a stern look. Nick trailed off, looking rather nonplussed himself. And then his expression turned to one of dawning comprehension.
“Is that what this is about?” Potter cut in. Draco’s eyes widened and his pulse was
Lucius Malfoy. The resemblance made his eyes narrow in well-founded suspicion.

needs to be taken down a notch, I suggest we move on to designing a prank of epic proportions. I’m talking stuff of legends here. Abject humiliation! Pain and misery! A...”
“Turn around! For the love of Merlin, woman! There’s a vampire in there!” Thomas yelled abruptly.
as he pointed a wand straight at Finnigan.
“No bed!” Teddy protested, his eyes going even wider. “Hawwy.”
“Any day now, Malfoy,” Potter cut in dryly.
Pomfrey raised an eyebrow. “Draco...”
“Save it,” Harry grumbled. “I know you’re not calling for me.”
Harry looked like he was trying to suppress a grin. But he stepped aside obligingly. “Come on in then,” he said. “We might as well make the most of it while we still can.”
He was up the stairs and in Al’s bedroom in record time. Al turned over as Draco tucked him in, one sleepy eye opening to look at him.
“Malfoy!”
“Me? What are
Harry nudged something forward with his left skate. Draco’s coffee cup rolled among the orange and brown leaves, his name still scrawled messily on it.
“And  you — a notorious bigot — can’t let that stand,” Potter finished.
“Don’t think so,” Draco argued. “We covered everything in BDSM and this was the best way forward. You understand, of course. All in good fun.”
There’s a faint rustle and the click of the door. He falls into a dreamless sleep.
This thing had spiralled so far out of control.
And fine, when he put it like that, his life did sound a little depressing but the fact remained that fantasy was for children. Draco lived in the real world and leaves were leaves and nothing more. The idea that some old superstition could have even the slightest truth to it...it was outlandish.
The nerve. “I don’t
Draco whirled around and his eyes landed dead on the offender. The thief was seated at a table not too far away. He was dressed sloppily— in a hoodie and jeans— as criminals are wont to do. Draco sneered. Just look at him, sitting over there in his stupid Man U hoodie and his stupid glasses, reading his stupid book.
“Hey, son!” James waved cheerfully through the flames. “Merlin, you look awful. Are you getting enough sleep?”
It took a while but finally, Draco was able to extricate himself. One more twist and then he edged away from Harry and flopped back on his pillows with a grin, revelling in his freedom. Oh, it was glorious. He could breathe and move again and Draco had never been so grateful for the simple things.
snowman.”
Ron snickered and shut the door behind him.
The child nodded and raised her wand nervously. She flicked before she swished and predictably, the target exploded. Draco winced and some of the students skittered out of wand range, but Potter barely blinked.
“Why would I bring a quill to dinner?”
“William, heel!” Draco demanded, pulling back. “Bad dog! What in the world…”
be expecting anyone else when he had a prior engagement, of course, but his business was his own. “Perhaps I should have called ahead…”
“I get it, you know.” Potter’s smile softened. “I know how complicated it is. We didn’t exactly go into this with a plan and I’m not going to lie, it will be rough when...if we…”
James gave him a blank look. “You don’t know me at all, do you?”
He wasn’t alone. He would never be alone again.
If there was a worse way to herald his child’s existence, Draco couldn’t think of it. He just dearly hoped Mother never found out about this.
There’s very little that scares Harry.
“There is no easy way to say this, I’m afraid.” She sighed and her eyes softened a little. “You’re pregnant.”
“Moan?” Potter repeated helplessly. He really did look like a poor, lost bunny.
He did know that. Deep down, he knew this was real. And yet, he didn’t dare tempt fate by saying it out loud. Some fears...they would stay with him forever. But having Harry here made it bearable.
Harry just tuned out her fretting and opened the door. He stopped short and a grin broke out on his face as he took in the sight in front of him.
Malfoy bolted up with a jerk. “Not guilty!” he blurted, looking around blearily. “Don’ want Argentina...”
There. He said it. It was out in the open now.
What, indeed. Draco sighed and leaned into Harry’s touch, letting him draw him closer. “I suppose I’m not used to good things happening to me,” he murmured. “If you didn’t...I didn’t want the baby to know how that feels, I suppose.”
. She had even threatened to take away House Points if he came to his next check up by himself. Draco didn’t even know how that worked since he wasn’t technically a Slytherin anymore, but he wasn’t eager to find out.
Draco should never have assumed it was anything more than that. This was entirely his fault. The only bright spot of the whole debacle was that he’d figured out his
“I’ll be back soon,” he promised. “Go back to bed, you look exhausted.”
of disappointment. He shared a grin with Draco and turned back to the kids. “But if you give me another minute with Draco here, we can practice the Tickling Charm.”
That being said, if Draco didn’t get a spot of Darjeeling and a serving of white chocolate raspberry scones at his favourite tea house within the next ten minutes, someone was going to die.
The blond raised an eyebrow. “I don’t really care if she watches,” he smirked, his smouldering gaze turning to the other boy. “Do you?”
“Well, a few times is all it takes. I don’t suppose either of you considered protection spells?” Her tone took on a maternal disapproving quality and Draco hunched into himself. He must have looked pretty miserable because her eyes softened and she gave him a reassuring pat. “What’s done is done. You need to focus on yourself now. Stress won’t do you or the baby any favours.”
What was that about? Draco frowned at Potter’s mumbling and shook his head. He had things to do anyway. “Well, I should go,” he declared, straightening his rumpled robes and slipping around Potter easily. “No time to waste and all. I’ll file a report and then it’s off to MOAN.”
Every eye in the room turned on Draco. He cleared his throat and tried in vain to fight the colour rising to his cheeks. The silence settled again, accompanied by confused stares from Longbottom and Thomas. Finnigan crossed his arms and adopted a sulky expression, muttering under his breath about it not being his fault. Draco wished he could just disappear into a hole in the ground.
don’t think you should.”
“So we’re back to last names again?” Harry asked quietly. He looked uncertain and sad, all of a sudden, and Draco’s determination nearly wavered. “Look, about last night. I don’t...really understand what’s going on anymore. All I know is we were, I don’t know, connecting. Then you ran off and I couldn’t find you anywhere. And okay, maybe I shouldn’t have but I was worried so I...looked you up in the Map
“You should,” Draco replied. “And that’s not all you did either.”
“What if I fail all my classes? Or I don’t make any friends? Or
Albus blinked again, evidently considering his options. “No play,” he replied finally.
The words tumbled out of him in a rush, before he could freeze up again. Potter blinked in sudden, abrupt surprise and Draco’s hands clenched against the desk.
Pomfrey’s eyes clouded over and Draco looked away as a sudden rush of guilt overcame him. Why did he feel so awful anyway? It’s not like he asked for this! Anyone in his position would consider...and he was only six weeks in, it wasn’t even an
“It’s a noble profession,” James cut in pointedly. Harry frowned and glanced uncertainly at Lily, who pursed her lips. James kept his penetrating gaze trained on Malfoy. “Funny, I had you figured for a politician. Like your old man.”
idea what this has been doing to him.”
he must have an active social life. Why, he probably had any number of fans and admirers.
“I’m afraid your first private discussion on the matter will be with
“Malfoy!” Granger snapped and snatched up the stirrer again, blocking his path quite firmly now. Honestly, what was up with her? Draco watched in disbelief as she crossed her arms and turned the full force of her indignant glare on him. “I really,
“There is no ‘us’.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” Father replied dryly. “Now. The matter at hand, if you please?”
Draco— who had been momentarily stunned by the sheer green of those eyes— recalled his mission. The scones were still sitting their innocuously and the sight did nothing to quell his temper. He turned back to the thief.
Why, another minute and we’d be giving the portraits one hell of a show. Isn’t that right, Scarhead?”
“Oh.” Draco startled, a bit caught off guard by the abrupt invitation. “That’s nice but you really don’t have to...”
“I have to tell him, don't I?” he mumbled. His hand braced against his stomach. He could feel the beginnings of a curve now, or maybe it was just his overtaxed imagination. But this child was real. They had been real for eight weeks. And they deserved better.
The clamour coming from the Hall was so loud, it almost made him falter. If it wasn’t for Granger trooping firmly at his side and whispering encouragements, he wasn’t sure he would have made it.
It was empty.
“Malfoy, stop!”
Salazar.
“That’s right, Draco,” Harry sighed, swiping a weary hand over his face. “Yell at him. That will make him like you.”
“Moving on!” Draco interrupted as he indulged in some more gratuitous gavel banging. Pansy winced and rubbed her temples discreetly. “As I was saying,” Draco continued grandly, “the first order of business is our Bi-monthly Performance Review. I think I can speak for all members of the BDSM community...”
Draco took a deep breath and focused on a bottle of Skele-Gro set out on the table.
He couldn’t stay here. He couldn’t. He would fail his classes or get laughed off the Quidditch Pitch or… or die in Herbology or something just as horrible and embarrassing. And then he would lose a thousand House Points and then he would get
The lights went on. The screen went blank. Draco blinked in confusion as he sat up, disentangling himself from an equally confused Finnigan. Longbottom and Thomas exchanged perplexed glances before turning to Potter.
Just seeing him and
They lapsed back in surprisingly comfortable silence. Harry’s fingers tangled with his and he marvelled at how...easy it all was. He’d worried and fretted over this moment for so long and now that it was here, it almost felt unreal.
“Hello, Godric,” Draco spat.
“Gosh, I wonder why,” Harry muttered. He scowled blearily at his father, still grinning in the flames. “If you don’t return my boyfriend in two hours, I’m calling Mum. And I
the Owlery was. For Merlin’s sake, it was his first day! It was dark and all the corridors looked the same! He bit back a groan of dismay and paused to take a look around. Was he supposed to go to the third or the seventh floor? Or maybe it was the...
Not a chance. Draco wasn’t giving him any quarter today. This was why
“Potter,” Pansy whispered.
“Very well,” Draco replied with a put upon sigh. “But you’re going to have to follow my lead, Harry. It’s serious business taking care of a baby, you know. You have to have a
Harry smiled proudly and laced his fingers with Malfoy’s, and that’s when James decided he had to say something.
“Oh, here we go.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Here’s a tip, Mum.
“Very well.”
Harry hummed in acquiescence and settled down. Then his brow furrowed as he realised that Draco was on the other side of the bed. “What’re you doin’ there?” he mumbled, reaching out and grabbing Draco’s arm to pull him over. “Get over here.”
Oh. Well, this was new.
“So, can Draco come out to play or…?”
“Harry likes the Cannons,” he pointed out. It was one of the few things they’d always argued about.
“Well, that explains the watermelon,” Draco mumbled. He was so tired. Merlin, he was just...tired.
He tried for a sneer but it was a weak effort. His pulse was
“Who else would I support?” Draco asked, sounding genuinely confused. “The Arrows? Or Merlin forbid, the Chudley
Draco sprang out of his hold immediately. One hand instinctively went to cradle his stomach. Merlin help him, he’d nearly tripped! That was too close. Was the baby alright? What if…
that, wouldn’t you?”
“Ah,” the Friar remarked softly.
James wasn’t sure he could take it anymore. He speared a piece of roast with his fork and choked it down, coughing around the liberally seasoned meat.
“Hey there,” he murmured. “I’m so glad to see you.”
Draco suppressed an anticipatory wince as the diagnostic spell washed over him. It left a tell-tale prickle, like Muggle electricity sparking across his skin. He could almost map its trajectory, following its trail as it poked and prodded at his insides. He kept still through it, affecting a bored expression to mask his discomfort. The last thing he needed was to be accused of being some sort of Drama Queen.
She was up and about when Draco stole out of the dorm in the early hours of morning and — even though she was careful not to ‘influence’ him — he knew his decision had gladdened her. Or at least, that’s what the bag of Bertie Bott’s Beans that she’d snuck in with his prenatal potions seemed to suggest. It was a small gesture and one that he was immensely thankful for.
And for whatever reason, that gave him the strength to get on his feet again. Granger squeezed his arm and they shared a brief smile and with that, he let her shepherd him to the Hall.
had a conversation? They’d gone straight from hurling hexes at each other to hurling themselves at each other. Talking was something they just never did and with their history, that was probably for the best. So it was hardly a surprise that Potter wasn’t hearing him now.
“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” She sighed and shook her head as he opened his mouth to argue. “Mr Malfoy, you’ve suffered a massive shock. You’re obviously distraught and while I sympathise, as your Healer, I cannot endorse any medication until you’re emotionally stable. This decision is life altering and not to be taken lightly.
“Should I have not said anything?”
James managed a shaky laugh despite himself. He actually
Remus cocked his head. “As far as I remember, Harry hexed him right back. Of course, I only taught them DADA for one term before I quit, but…they sort of reminded me of you and Lily at that age.” His lips twitched at James’s noticeably sour expression. “Sorry.”
“Hey, Seamus,” Potter greeted his friend. He sounded a little perplexed. “I thought you and Dean had a party tonight.”
He didn’t have time for this!
anymore. His heavy limbs tangle with another’s as a new wave of pleasure-pain washes over him. He jerks helplessly in an iron embrace — even as cold, possessive arms wrap around him and a dark laugh brushes his ear.
Draco was entirely out of patience. “For Merlin’s sake, you overbearing mutt! I am
Harry caught up to him with quick strides, blocking Draco’s path firmly. “Oh thank Godric,” he said. His hands flew to his hair, pushing through it in an agitated motion. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you! You just ran off and...at first I thought you went to the dorms but then you weren’t there. And then you weren’t at breakfast and then you missed class! Do you have any idea how worried...”
Pomfrey tutted. “Aren’t they all?”
“Potter.” He disentangled himself and sat up, trying his hardest to sound resolute. He just sounded tired. “I...it’s not that I don’t want to. It’s just...things are complicated right now. I wish I could explain it properly, I really do. But I just
“You,” Potter went on, “are going to ace the NEWTS. You’re smart, talented and you’ve got no reason to worry this much. With the amount of work you’re putting in, you might just give Mione a run for her money. Also, please don’t tell her I said that. I really want to live.”
be there.
In minutes, he was comfortably ensconced in an armchair at his best friends’ flat, twirling a glass of Ogden’s and watching tiny Teddy play with his blocks. Teddy gurgled happily and waved a chubby fist at the grown-ups. James couldn’t help but smile fondly. Godric, had Harry ever been this little? Every time he saw Teddy, his heart soared with happiness for his friends. It had taken years before they were even seriously considered for adoption, thanks to Remus’s affliction. But Teddy was here at last, and they couldn’t be happier. James raised his glass in a silent toast before turning to Sirius.
“Go on,” Granger whispered. “One step at a time.”
Harry frowned. Obviously, lack of sleep wasn’t doing wonders for Draco’s mood. “Maybe you should go to bed,” he suggested helpfully.
. And since that was only a step above being raised by wolves, it meant that there were still some fundamental gaps in his understanding of how things worked.
James nodded and wiped his burning face again. Embarrassing though his breakdown was, at least someone was listening now. “I don’t want to be here. I want to come home.”
With that, they departed from the corridor. Pansy emerged from the shadows, accompanied by a rather mutinous Theo.
him, it does diminish the man in his eyes. There’s a nervous quality to Father’s haughty tone. It’s embarrassing, Draco thinks. Certainly not how a man in charge behaves around his supposed underlings.
Potter turned to him, looking put out and mutinous. “Come on,” he grumbled, heading for the den. “We should probably set up for the
No matter how many times he did it, taking Teddy through the Floo always made his nerves jump.
Marina watched, utterly delighted but somewhat concerned. Surely, he was being too rough with the nice boy? Well, she would have something to say about
“No,” he declared firmly. “I don’t know what possessed you to volunteer us for babysitting duty but you are not sticking me with Ginger Junior while you and Granger traipse off to the Ministry. Believe it, Potter, when I say no, I mean
The face slid into focus, and it was Harry Potter. Draco grabbed the concerned face. “Potter! Potter please listen to me—“ Draco’s chest was heaving with sobs. “The snake, it’s going to eat her, you have to kill the snake, please, you have to do something—“
“How are you feeling, darling?”
Harry smiled and took his hand. “I guess that’s settled then. I’ll see you at dinner, yeah?” He planted a kiss on Draco’s forehead, and left the blonde man sitting shocked on the wood.
“All the time,” Greg said, sounding glad that Draco mentioned it. “He wasn’t particularly kind to Vince and I, but he never really seemed to want to follow in his father’s footsteps.”
Draco stopped and looked at Harry seriously. “I have
“Yup.” Draco got up a lot more successfully this time, with Potter right beside him ready to steady him if needed. The two walked back to their dormitory, not speaking but rather marinating in a pleasant and comfortable silence. The ability to do so was one of Draco’s greatest wishes in a companion—and it certainly wouldn’t be Potter in the end, but this would do for now.
“I know, but it’s just so...unfair. I just want to be left alone. I just want everyone to let me live my life. I’ve never even be able to—“ Harry stopped, seemingly overwhelmed with emotion. He closed his eyes and put his head in his hands, rubbing furiously at his forehead. It broke Draco’s heart to see him so upset.
,” Draco said, deeply disturbed at the use of his first name by his arch nemesis and wanted to remind Harry of his place. “Bold of you to assume that I would even want to be friendly with the likes of you. Second—“ Draco gestured to the magical band on his wrist. “If the past is in the past, why the bloody hell am I wearing this like an animal?”
“This is ridiculous,” Narcissa glowered with some of the spark that Draco had always admired gleaming in her eyes. “They are repeating their same mistakes of two years past. Making a spectacle of great wizarding families simply because they had nothing better to do didn’t help then, and it will not help now.”
“No, thank you Mother. I’ll be ready in a few minutes.” He was embarrassed to admit that he still had problems eating at times. He hoped that part of it was just being in the Manor, trying to find somewhere to eat where he hadn’t been, but he also felt like he should be over that by now. The past was the past, and he was a Malfoy. Although, he wasn’t sure what being a Malfoy meant anymore. He often found himself wishing that his father had either defied the Dark Lord or was a successful Death Eater. Draco didn’t know how to interpret the fact that his father lay cowardly in between good and evil.
“Have you been reading the
Harry glared at her, but clearly she had wanted his attention. She bounded over to them. “Oh, Harry, thank you so much for protecting us all last year. I’m sure you don’t want to be speaking with the likes of him. Do you want us to walk you to class?” She had a group of other Hufflepuff girls behind her, all looking up eagerly at the Boy Who Lived.
Draco’s brow furrowed. “I didn’t even know that was still a thing.”
“What sort of punishments?”
“But that was—that was
It was finally the end of the first week of school, and Draco had mounds of homework to do. He found a quiet study corner in the library on Friday afternoon. Greg had gone to his first session with the Mind Healer, and Blaise and Daphne were enjoying the autumn winds. He just wanted to be alone. He normally hated privacy and constantly surrounded himself with friends back in the day, but he spent his entire summer in isolation. Having all these deep conversations this week had made him realize just how much he was suffocating.
Professor McGonagall leaned back in her chair, considered. Then Dumbledore spoke up from behind her. “I’m not sure the members of the ‘army’ want to see you in Azkaban, Draco. I believe they think that would improve things and ease some of the pain they feel, but I’m almost certain they know deep down that is not true.”
“Wh—what?” Draco stammered, knowing he was caught.
“You could have been something, Draco. We hired private tutors for you, made sure you were socialized with the right people, and gave you every opportunity. And what did you do with it? You were continuously second or third in your class at school—behind a
Draco sighed. “I don’t know, he’s my father. I mean, if the retrial goes well and he gets out, I’ll have to see him anyway.”
Hale was silent for a second as she looked at Narcissa. “Why did you say no to Nott’s proposition? If you dislike the society under this Ministry, why not try for a new one?”
“Firstly, I don’t know if you could tell from
“Then I guess we both feel the same way. About that, that is. The real question is, what do you want?”
“That’s really all I want,” Draco added after a pause.
“Not really. That’s why I’m going to the Ministry myself. Maybe they have Veritaserum or something, so that they’ll know I’m telling the truth.”
“It’s your choice, Malfoy,” Ginny said, though she didn’t move from her spot. “What’s it going to be?”
“Harry, you’ve been an amazing teacher, but maybe we should just go with
Draco put his wand down, ready to be taken. “Harry, it’s not worth it.” Draco used Potter’s first name in order to get his attention, to show him how serious this was. Harry was smirking, looking almost casual as he put his left hand in his pocket. Dolohov didn’t break eye contact with Potter.
Smith sounded far too curious for Draco’s liking. “No,” Harry retorted. “It’s just very new. You could proclaim it to the whole castle if you’d like, but I doubt anyone would care.” Draco understood why Harry was saying that, but it still terrified him. Smith would love to know that Draco was scared of people knowing, and then he would do exactly that—tell the whole castle. It was best to let him know that wouldn’t affect Draco or Harry—even if that was a lie.
“I’m trying to make Wolfsbane, but I think I made a misstep—“
Harry slipped the fabric around himself and Draco, and Draco felt its cool touch of invisibility. They walked in silence to the Wizengamot court room, where they thankfully hadn’t closed the doors due to a mountain of reporters and Ministers trying to get in. They slipped inside and managed not to bump into anyone as they stood near the back, waiting for the doors to be closed before they took a seat. A woman named Ainsley Hale, Pius Thicknesse’s replacement, was presiding, and she was reading the expectations of the trial while Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy sat behind the witness chair, looking pale and thin.
Lucius stood up, the table trembling from suppressed magic. “Everything I have done, I have done for this family. I will not stand here and listen to this.” Everyone was silent for a moment. “Get out. Get out of my house. Do not come back until you are ready to end this childish behavior.”
“Um...” Draco looked around. The village seemed more busy than it had the last time he came, which was probably a good thing since the eerie silence was a foreshadowing to Dolohov’s attempted kidnapping of Draco. With all the hustle and bustle, he was sure that Madame Rosmerta would be capitalizing on business at the pub that he frequented so often over the past two years. But what were the other options, the Hogs Head?
“It wasn’t necessary. It wasn’t an attack, it was just...a scuffle.”
“I know that last time seeing him was very difficult for you. Have you heard if he’s improved at all, health-wise?”
“No—don’t—“ Draco didn’t want to be touched right now. Potter looked at him for a moment and left the room.
“Did you know that St. Mungo’s has started hiring Mind Healers?” Harry spoke up after a moment. “I’ve been seeing one, I still do. It’s really been helping.”
“For most of it, yeah,” Bill said, looking at Fleur lovingly. “Not like we could Apparate...”
“I’m fine, Potter. I just have a lot of work. None of your concern,” Draco would respond cooly.
“Well, that’ll help,” Draco drawled sarcastically. “Actually, why don’t you just cast Expelliarmus on the thing? That usually solves your problems.”
“Listen carefully to me, Potter,” Dolohov said with a sneer. Draco’s hand was shaking as he held out his useless wand. “I have others inside waiting for my signal. If you don’t do anything rash, your friends will live, and so will you.”
!” Draco let out a hiss of pain as the skin on his right arm split open. He put his hand on the wound and pushed past the two students. The hallways were extremely crowded and he was far from his dormitory. The chaos mostly covered him, but he was quite tall and caught some students’ eye. They gawked, glared, yelled at him, and a few even tripped him as he was rushing to get back to the dormitory. Blood started to drip on the floor—as much as he didn’t want to go back to his quarters, he needed to find Blaise or Daphne so they could heal his arm.
“It’s also rude to leave your guest alone at a table with people that don’t like him.” Draco said this in a sarcastic tone, but Potter looked sharply at him with guilt in his eyes.
“What?”
“Yes,” Draco lied. He couldn’t have eaten more than one or two bites of dinner, but he was far too shaken to accept food now. “Thank you for your...hospitality. I hope to not stay long.” Draco remembered his manners.
It was only later, when they were under the covers in Draco’s bed where he thought they both belonged, that Draco let himself process what had happened earlier that evening. He tried not to tense his body, not wanting to worry the sleepy Harry that was curled against his chest. Draco wondered if Harry had thoughts of his own, and wished that he could read them through the fingertips that were grazing the top of his head.
“You’re a right prat, you know.” Blaise began.
The second group of individuals were not as close to Harry and thought that Draco was just making up getting his tongue cut out to try and win sympathy. They were particularly suspicious of what Draco was doing with Harry Potter.
“Well, I’m
“I’m serious, Malfoy. Take this deal. It’s better than Azkaban.”
“I’m not crazy, Potter. I didn’t spend years having delusions, or whatever you’ve claimed to have happen to you.” Draco couldn’t work up the energy to put enough malice in his voice.
“What?”
“That would be enormously foolish,” Professor McGonagall said, but it wasn’t a ‘no’. “And complicated. I’m not sure it could even be done, and I know that it shouldn’t be done. Tell me, Mr. Malfoy, have you apologized to them?”
“You don’t know a damn thing about me or my family, Weasley. If you think the Dark Lord is terrifying, try having him in your home for a year.”
Draco and Harry go to Hogsmeade!
“Just after one.” Draco did some mental math. He was probably out in the hail and cold for about three or four hours. No wonder his fingertips were still numb. “Once I got you inside, I saw Ginny nearby. On the map. I wasn’t sure if she had something to do with your attack, but I definitely wanted to see if she was okay. She told me everything. She was pretty worked up, so I stayed with her for a while.” Harry looked at Draco sadly. “I had no idea about the new Dumbledore’s Army, or that shack. Why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
Draco was loathe to speak right now, but his curiosity got the better of him. “I did always wonder how in the world you lot managed to get into the Department of Mysteries as fifteen year olds.”
Draco gave a sad half-smile. “If all goes well, you’ll see me in a week.” Harry had invited Draco to come to dinner with him at the Burrow, where the Weasleys lived. Draco was still apprehensive, but couldn’t pass up an opportunity to see Harry. “And if things go extremely poorly, you’ll see me tonight.” Harry had also reassured Draco that he could stay at the Burrow if his parents did something so horrible as to throw him out of the house.
Draco gave a small, humorless laugh. “It’s kind of great, in a way, that these are the problems we’re facing.” He gestured to the
It was strange—even without his family’s social capital or wealth, Draco had never felt like he lived a more cushy lifestyle. Here he was at school, dating the most famous wizard in the world, in relatively good health, and with at least one parent who still loved him. That was so much more than some others had, and here he was worrying about things he couldn’t even control.
“No,” Narcissa said almost proudly.
“I’m used to being stressed when my scar hurts, I guess. It always hurt when Voldemort was around.”
“Um...” Draco wanted to test the waters while there was a pause in the conversation. “Did you know that Harry Potter is my roommate?”
“Anyway, we brought you some cookies and a sandwich. Granger said that sugar can help you body replenish blood faster, and we figured you hadn’t eaten all day.” Daphne held out the plate.
Harry seemed to be thinking about something, but then left anyway, making Draco sob even harder. However, a few moments later Harry returned—with another pillow. Without a word, Harry lay beside Draco and turned off the lights, leaving both of them side by side in the darkness.
Draco found Harry a very easy student in regards to Occlumency, and the Boy Who Lived was now able to show him nearly any memory Draco requested. After running out of specific ones to ask for, Draco let Potter come up with some on his own. This was harder, because Potter had to remember every detail unprompted. However, all the memories came through very clearly, and Draco learned more about Harry along the way. His nemesis really did have an awful childhood, with clearly abusive relatives.
“Was Crabbe a Death Eater?” Draco glared into Granger’s piercing eyes.
“You—what?”
“You can’t jump, you know.” A singsong and sickly familiar voice sounded behind him, and Draco whirled around. Luna Lovegood was standing near the hallway, sporting bright purple glasses and a headband that seemed to be made of real bumblebees that were buzzing cheerfully around her head. She looked at him inquisitively as she shuffled her schoolbooks in her hand. “There’s a protective barrier. It sounds the alarm so Professor McGonagall will know.” Draco was silent and gaping as she met his eyes. “I helped develop it, of course. Mental health is so important. I don’t want anyone getting hurt or feeling like they don’t belong. Wrackspurts can drive people to do terrible things. ”
The classroom around Draco faded away as he was sucked into Harry’s memory. How young they all looked—he could see the excitement and nervousness on the small Boy-Who-Lived’s face as he walked onto the pitch, hand shaking slightly as it held the broom. The vision wavered a few times, but for the most part, the memory played clearly. Once it ended and the vision began to blur into a cascade of Potter’s other thoughts, Draco stepped back into himself.
Draco has a nightmare and takes a walk in the Forbidden Forest. What a great idea!
Draco shrugged, feeling a little guilty. “They were mostly my...henchmen I guess. That’s putting it a little nicely as it is. Especially toward the end. I just bullied them into doing whatever I wanted. We never talked about much else. To be quite truthful, they never really talked to me, it was mostly me droning on and on...you should know, you were Greg once!”
Draco looked up—she seemed to say this last part with quite a lot of emphasis. Did she know that he had snuck out with Harry to Diagon Alley? He was worried enough that Mr. Burke had recognized him...
“There isn’t. But it doesn’t mean that there can’t be happiness.” Harry looked at Draco and smiled. Draco felt like the whole of the war-torn village of Godric’s Hollow lit up in tandem with the expression on Harry’s face.
“Do you want to be in my group?”
“No,” Draco said. “No one knows I’m out here, and even if they did, you wouldn’t get in trouble. So go ahead.” Ginny seemed to hesitate, only making Draco feel angry. “Merlin,
The next step in his life was to figure out how to become in an official relationship with Harry Potter. He knew that Harry had at least two prior relationships—a brief escapade with Cho Chang and then, of course, Ginny Weasley. He wish he knew how these came to be. He knew that Ginny and Harry started dating after a Quidditch game, but who asked whom? How public were they about their relationship? How easy was it to win the Boy Who Lived’s heart? Draco hadn’t even kissed anyone before, besides one time Pansy tried when they were kids. What if he was terrible at it?
“No! They’re mine and I can do whatever I want with them!” Draco adopted the whiny tone that he often had in their early years of school.
“Back to Defense Against the Dark Arts I see,” Blaise said next to him. The previous year it had just been called “Dark Arts.” “Let’s see if Arden can make it past a year.”
Draco sighed as he pulled on a cashmere sweater, smoothing his hands over the fabric. He really did want to make his mother happy. Maybe a trinket from a store would brighten her day. He’d suck up the painful memories and go anyway. Grabbing his bag, he opened his bedroom door and stepped into the living space. Blaise, Daphne, and Greg were nowhere to be found, but that was alright—the Slytherins all respected each other’s space and didn’t feel the need to spend every second of the day together.
...of course Potter wouldn’t care about Draco’s parents. But he did care about Draco, didn’t he? He cared enough to search for him in sixth year until he found him crying in a bathroom. He cared enough to pull Draco on his broom in the Room of Requirement last May. For Merlin’s sake, he invited him out today!
Harry nodded and was silent for a few moments. Draco noticed his teeth and fist clenched, as if he were trying not to fall apart. “You know,” he said shakily. “Everyone else has told me that. But for some reason it makes me feel good that you said it. Because you’re right, I really do feel like you’d tell me if I were to blame for anything.”
“Yes, the Time Turner that was so conveniently missing when the Aurors went to look for it the other day,” an elderly wizard spoke up.
Feeling very tired, Draco carefully climbed into bed next to Harry, and did just that. With the small kiss that Draco planted on Harry’s forehead, the man opened his eyes sleepily.
. I know he didn’t like your father. He was an odd one, but I miss him.” Harry looked wistfully at the walls.
“I think you’re being quite hard on yourself, Draco. What would seeing your father do for you? And what would it do for him? If he really is as unwell as it seems, seeing you may not be good for his mental health either.”
“Usually you at least let me finish my sentence before you object to my advice.” Draco did not miss the gentle reprimand in her voice. “Who is it, then? Is it Daphne Greengrass? Because I definitely think that could be arranged—“
Draco was dumbfounded and stared at his uneaten plate. He rubbed his chest, feeling as though his heart was breaking. Lucius’s behavior came as no surprise to him. But for his mother to suggest that he live his life as a lie? Maybe it was foolish, but he expected her to be accepting. He was her dragon. Wouldn’t she give up anything, even an heir, to make him happy?
“Jinx me. Hex me. Torture me. If it’ll make you feel better.”
Uh oh. It looks like word is getting around the school somehow that Harry and Draco are involved. How do you think the other students will react? What more do you want to see? I can’t wait to write holiday scenes in this fanfiction!
“I have no idea,” Draco replied. Harry’s mention of his parents pulled at his heartstrings. “It doesn’t really matter to them as long as I produce an heir, so I’m not sure why they would care.”
For the next half hour, Draco and Potter worked together on the potion. Draco showed him the best techniques for cutting ingredients and how to measure gases properly. Finally the potion turned the correct color. “Great, now we just need to let it sit for twenty minutes.” They both sat tiredly on the stools, wiping sweat from their brows.
Draco visits the Mind Healer and witnesses some of Potter’s anger issues.
“Yeah, fine. Think I’m gonna turn in though. Long day.” Without saying much else, Draco went to his bedroom and sat heavily on the bed. He wasn’t quite drunk enough not to feel any of the sting of Dean’s words, but he felt a little more relaxed than he knew he would have without the Firewhisky.
“Probably,” Harry admitted. “At least you’ll be out for a bit, let people focus on something else. Gossip doesn’t stay in the same place for too long at this school.”
“No,” Draco said. “There’s no need. I’m going to the Ministry tomorrow morning. I promise I’m just trying to get through the year. I have no clue who sent me the Time Turner or why.”
“That memory you were altering today. Were you trying to alter it into being me?”
“Hey! Did you hear? My mother is back at the Manor.” Draco had to work to keep pace with Harry.
Draco’s friends were relieved at the outcome of the trial, but Draco knew that his parents weren’t out of the woods yet. After the events at the Ministry, he finally decided to poke his head out from under the sand and research current events. Thanks to old copies of the
“He’s hit his head,” he heard someone say. A large figure loomed over him, and then the worst of the pain was suddenly gone with a flick of someone’s wand. Draco sat up, feeling significantly better, but the world still swimming a bit. The first face he was able to see clearly was Harry’s.
Draco fought back nausea again. It was bad enough when he had a fit on the train in front of Potter. Now the entire eighth year knew that he was wrong in the head. “Well, thanks for staying out here with me. Don’t feel the need to stick around.” Draco made to get up but he stumbled, still dizzy. Potter reached out to help steady him. “Woah, we can walk back in a bit. That was a pretty major panic attack, you should rest a little longer.” Potter waved his wand and a blanket of warmth fell around both him and Draco, easing the latter’s shivers just a little. Draco resented Potter using the Muggle term for whatever ailed him, but was too tired to argue with him about it.
Before gathering his things and reluctantly following, Draco motioned for Greg to hang back for a second. Blaise looked like he wanted to protest but Daphne took his arm and steered him toward the Great Hall. Soon it was just Greg and Draco in the classroom.
After a few moments, he opened his eyes. Christine looked at him with sympathy—he hated it. “That sounds like a lot. I’m really sorry you don’t want to be here. I understand why you don’t. Is there anything I can do?”
He saw the path where he had taken Potter’s hand just then. Tonight when the nightmares came, Potter didn’t mock him, just brought him a cup of tea and sat on the end of his bed, talking nonsense until Draco’s heart rate slowed. He saw himself able to feel comfortable at the eighth-year table, giving Potter a friendly nod once and a while. He saw himself comforting Potter when he had a nightmare—he must have them, wouldn’t he?—and making him tea, and maybe telling him that he was sorry—
“What time was that?”
Perhaps the most significant change, though, was that he was actually dating Harry Potter. It had been just about a week since their relationship became official, and Draco still felt like he was in a dream. He knew that he liked Harry from the beginning of third year, when he was attacked by the hippogriff. That injury certainly did hurt, but he did exaggerate the initial pain to see if Harry would pay attention. He laughed to himself as he paced the floors.
“Oh, right. Crabbe. Almost forgot about that. I heard he was too stupid to control his spell and killed himself. Not a bad death for such a buffoon. Good riddance, too.” Dean’s voice was ice cold and Draco could tell he chose his words deliberately.
“No mate,” Greg said, leaning against the bedpost and picking up Draco’s textbooks. “We understand, we’re all super busy. Plus, it’s amazing seeing you so happy.”
Draco looked up and met Harry’s eyes, who smiled encouragingly.
. He glanced at the clock illuminated by the moonlight—it was only two-thirty.
“I let the Death Eaters into the castle sixth year. That certainly sped things along.”
Draco took the pile of fabric from her outstretched arms. All the blankets she handed him were hand knitted and in various states of condition. “Thank you. I really appreciate it.” Draco meant it.
“Oh,” he said sheepishly. “I’ve been cut off from Dreamless Sleep, so I’ve been having some issues sleeping lately. I just wanted to take a nap before working on some papers.”
While Harry was thriving in Occlumency, Draco had made very little progress in learning how to produce a Patronus. Sometimes he would lay awake at night, racking his brain for potential memories that would lead to success. The best he did was when he thought about a family trip with his parents that they had taken when Draco was very young, maybe five or six. They had gone to Paris for Bastille Day and watched the parade, and there was a fireworks show too. Draco had this image of him holding both his parents’ hands and looking up as they leaned over him to share a kiss. That night, Lucius carried the exhausted young boy back to their villa. Draco felt safe and protected, and like he was the luckiest kid in the world to have the parents that he did.
Narcissa sat, picking at her cuticles. Draco didn’t want to scare her half to death, but he had to take his chance while he still could. He slowly slipped the Invisibility Cloak off, and the ruffling of the fabric falling to the ground make her look up.
Draco sighed and filled them in on his father’s letter. “I just don’t know what to do. I mean, we’re all going home to messed-up parents, but on top of it I’m dating the Boy Who Lived.”
“I’ll be fine, Potter. Here, it’s about time to stir the potion.” They were about a minute away from reaching that point, but Draco didn’t want to continue with the conversation. The potion turned out fine—possibly not as effective as it would have been had they waited, but enough to get Potter a good grade on Monday. Draco made a mental note to stop by to make his potion to turn in to Slughorn later.
“You know, Malfoy,” Harry said Draco’s last name good-naturedly and shoved him teasingly. “I would even say we’re halfway to being mates. What a strange world it is.” And with a smile, Harry pushed open the door and walked toward where Hermione and Neville were playing Gobstones.
“Yes,” Draco responded curtly.
“Do you have to make so much noise?” He should know better than to assume he would be alone in the night, but Granger startled him anyway.
“None of your concern, Smith. Go be a prick somewhere else.”
“Yeah but if they’re spewing this nonsense about unity and harmony and whatever, there’s no way they’re going to let us room together,” Blaise said, gesturing to Draco and Greg. “And I don’t know who you’d be living with, Daphne, but hopefully not the mudblood Granger.” Draco felt a sharp and unnatural twinge of disgust at the use of that word—come to think of it, he hadn’t said it in months.
“Well, an apology will not suffice. I thought that your father’s musings about you potentially sabotaging the Malfoy family were simply a result of being in Azkaban for too long. Now I see that there is some truth to it.”
“I still don’t really understand what you meant when you said that.”
“They’re not just going to let you replace your mother unless you actually did something. They’re not that far gone...sit back down,” Potter told him sternly but gently.
“I’m fine, Potter. And actually you’ll be thrilled—my parents are in Azkaban now.” Draco didn’t know why he was directing so much anger at his roommate. None of this was Harry’s fault, but Draco could never snap at the Ministry officials who held the blame. If he didn’t let some of these emotions out, he was sure he was going to explode.
“What exactly do you have to do?” Draco was not expecting Potter to ask this. Unfortunately he didn’t have a response prepared because he couldn’t think of a single thing to do. For once, he wished for a ton of homework. “Come on,” Potter grabbed his arm—Merlin’s balls he’s pushy—and nearly dragged him toward where he was sitting with Dean Thomas and Susan Bones.
“Professor Snape taught you, right?” Harry nodded. “He tried to teach me, too. Surprisingly, he wasn’t that good at explaining to me exactly what I needed to do. He was very skilled himself, but just couldn’t get the point across.”
“Psh. Speak for yourself, Potter,” Draco said good-naturedly. He pulled off the cloak and reached into his long trench coat. He got out some glasses with the frames cut out, a long scarf, and a beret which managed to hide his platinum blonde hair. “There. People won’t know who I am unless they look really closely, and thankfully it is perfectly acceptable to wear berets indoors.”
. Draco squirmed uncomfortably at this realization. “Therapy has become quite common in the Muggle world.” Draco couldn’t help but scoff.
“I don’t care! You’ve been through enough, mate,” Blaise said, pointing his fork at Draco. “You deserve to be happy. If Potter is what makes you happy, then he better cooperate.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Neville spoke up after the room returned to order. “This is what we’re talking about—the need for healing. That brings us to our next point.” He looked worriedly at Hermione, who continued after a brief pause.
a family, and they hate this one...”
Harry turned to his side to face Draco. “Why wouldn’t you?”
“Are you alright? You seem more out of it than usual today, and last time that happened you were nearly poisoned.”
This calmed Draco down.
Draco actually woke up for the first time in days.  The past few nights had been like a slideshow of his worst fears realized. He had both flashbacks and visions of things that thankfully never happened. He saw Potter’s dead body in Hagrid’s arms dozens of times, but in half of the dreams he never leapt out to save them all.
“No,” she said, pushing a tin of cookies toward him. “I did notice, however, that you have not signed up for a session with a Mind Healer.”
Harry looked confused. “Why not? You almost died, Draco, and everyone deserves the right to defend themselves—“
“Yes, and you know him so well from your years of tormenting him,” Ginny said cooly. Draco hated the way that made his heart feel.
“When can I see Draco?” Narcissa leaned forward, all anger gone from her face.
“Yeah, sure it did. Potter, choosing whether to share a room with you or an elephant would be a hard decision indeed, but I certainly don’t deserve to room with both.” Draco rubbed his eyes, trying to work up some energy.
“I—um...sure. Thanks.” Draco knew that it would not be polite to turn down anyone’s tea after they knew his intentions of making his own. He poured himself a cup of tea and moved toward his room. “Well. Goodnight.”
Draco put his feet on the ground, but even the solid Earth wasn’t enough to steady himself. His vision from earlier, the one that nearly produced a Patronus, came back to him now. He leaned over and touched Harry’s cheek gently. With the other hand, he brushed back Harry’s bangs, revealing his scar. It wasn’t even that big and had an almost faded quality.
He quietly crept into the room so as not to wake Potter, who was mumbling in his sleep. Draco sighed as he settled back into bed. He was exhausted and nauseated from Granger’s conversation.
Harry looked confused. “Why? And isn’t that a good thing, so you don’t have to deal with it?”
“He’s doing worse, Draco. I don’t know how much longer he has, and his only son is refusing to see him.” Mr. Burke shook his head sadly.
“Has he improved any since he’s been in Mungo’s?”
Harry may not be doing as well as he seems—and the Aurors don’t seem to have it all together either...
“Alright, now we should try—“
Draco smiled, and the rest of the dinner conversation remained light. Draco insisted on paying after a lengthy argument with Harry, but Harry insisted that they go for dessert afterward. All in all, the evening was going perfectly, to Draco’s relief. Conversation flowed naturally, and he often shelved away topics for future conversation. For example, there was clearly something wrong with the Muggles that Harry lived with—it doesn’t seem like he was treated well in the slightest. Harry had hinted at it before, but it seemed to affect him more deeply than Draco thought. But that was to be brought up at a different time, because Draco knew how touchy the subject of family could be. Seemingly in turn, Harry did not bring up the impending trial that was looming over Draco’s head like his own personal cloud.
“Harry only gave me the footnotes when he called,” she admitted, crossing her arms and leaning against the counter. “They knew each other at Hogwarts, didn’t always get along. You know, Gryffindor, Slytherin…that kind of thing. Oh!” She snapped her fingers, making James jump a little. “Do you remember that one time McGonagall called us when Harry got the bad end of a Jelly Legs Jinx? Apparently, that was him.”
“Finishing it,” Draco echoed blandly. “And is it? Finished?”
Draco swallowed against the dryness in his throat, despite the thrill curling in his chest. Sometimes, he forgot that there
are you having trouble understanding?”
Hugo blinked again. Draco blinked back.
The Great Hall. With the entire school assembled. And the teachers.
Perhaps the worst of all—not that Draco would ever admit it— was that it was Valentine’s Day and he was all alone. Adrian had dumped him the week before— something about their relationship being ‘too stressful’ and ‘needing a break’. Frankly, that had hurt a bit. Their time together had been a bit rocky but Draco wouldn’t go so far as to call it ‘stressful’. Apparently, Adrian thought differently.
The thief ran a hand through his atrociously messy black hair and flipped a page, apparently unaware of just how much danger he was in. Draco’s eyes narrowed as the bloke extended a hand and reached for the plate on his table. A plate of white chocolate scones topped with raspberry jam.
“Is there a...potion I could take?” he asked quietly. “A draught or...Muggles have those pill things, don’t they?”
They approached the table with slow, measured steps. Harry’s lips pursed as they approached and he doubled down on glaring at the table, pointedly refusing to spare a glance for Draco. His fork clenched in his fist and he looked like he wanted nothing more than to leave. Nonetheless, he stayed put.
Draco blinked in surprise. “How did you know my name?”
this.”
cinnamon sticks — to her mulled wine concoction. James felt his throat clench in protest but he managed to keep a straight face and focus on his wife.
“What?” Nick sputtered. “But that was clearly...”
Right. If he wanted a night of peaceful, uninterrupted sleep, he was going to have to be very careful and very,
Harry falls silent again. But then he leans forward and presses a kiss to Draco’s head. “Think it over,” he says quietly. “Sleep on it. If you still want this tomorrow, I will honour your choice.”
And now they were flirting. Draco’s blush deepened and he looked away. His eyes landed on the book Harry was reading. “Is that
tell me anything.”
Draco groaned in pain and rubbed his head. Christ, that hurt!
She had to restrain herself from doing a flip when the trousers were shucked off and deposited in a corner. He was wearing nothing but his pants now. Marina tried to be open-minded but she had never liked the concept of ‘legs’. They just seemed silly. However,
“Oh, well. It’s just with the NEWTS and...what have you got there?” Granger asked suddenly. She craned her neck to get a better look at his book. “A Comprehensive History of...
“Didn’t we prank Potter last year?” a brunette from Fourth Year asked.
Of course the direct approach hadn’t worked! Draco had neglected an extremely salient point in his planning. He may be a powerful wizard and a hero to the magical world but Potter had been
“Promise?”
But he was still Draco’s teacher in this new life. It’s his job to offer support.
It’s only then that Draco realises he’s been talking out loud this whole time. He attempts a scathing glare but well, that’s the downside to having a vampire lover.
Judging by the half finished carpentry projects and the worktable in the corner, it would seem the rumours were true. Home renovation seemed to be a passion, if not a lifestyle for Potter and Draco had to admit, he seemed to have a knack for it. Walburga’s portrait, for instance, was conspicuously absent from the foyer. That had to have taken some amount of magical prowess to Unstick. The rest of it was quite impressive too. Draco ran a finger down the length of a polished mahogany table. This was definitely hand-crafted, perhaps even without magic. Impressive.
Well, that was that. James withdrew and reached out to tune the wireless. If they were really doing this whole bonding thing, Quidditch scores were a good place to start. And after all this, he would be remiss not to give this boy a fair shot.
“Well, that’s the most important thing,” Father said firmly. A faint smile played on his lips as he settled down, making himself comfortable. “As long as you’re alright, we can take care of everything else together.”
Draco crossed his arms, even as an embarrassed blush rose to his cheeks again. “What exactly is it for, Potter?”
shot up the length of his spine. It took all his wherewithal — not to mention, the toddler ten feet away — to step away and out of the man’s grip.
“No one comes here much,” he commented. “You must get lonely all by yourself.”
“Fine, thanks. What…happened, exactly?”
A dark shadow moved in the corner. There was a glint of sharp fangs and thin, bloodless lips curling in a smile. The woman froze and her eyes widened. Draco swore he saw the exact moment when the horrifying realisation struck her. A scream caught in his throat as she turned around and came face to face with...
That was as far as Draco was willing to go on the subject.
should tell him.”
Harry winced. Clearly, he had a lot of making up to do. Well, no time like the present. “Come on,” he said, helping Draco up. “Let’s get you to bed.”
“What else did I do?”
Because he would be alone in this, he knew he would.
just a lunatic...
William was not convinced. He whimpered and pawed fretfully at Draco, sending him sprawling on his back. Then he settled himself on Draco’s lap, snuffling and whimpering apologetically. “Oh, so you’re sorry now, are you?” Draco grumbled. “This happens to be your fault, I’ll have you know.”
“Gryffindor,” James mumbled. “Is that okay?”
Harry nods sharply and heads back to the bedroom, leaving Lucius behind without a glance. He has a feeling Draco will afford the man the same amount of courtesy. It’s more than he deserves.
“No! You can’t do this to me, Harry! This is not happening!”
“Fine!” Harry burst out. “Whatever. Just...say what you have to say so we can get this over with!”
“What the…?” Draco blinked and leaned in to glare at the numbers. “How did you…?”
With that weary thought, he hoisted himself up, threw on his school robes in an effort to look at least halfway presentable and stashed the pregnancy books safely in the bag under his bed.
Then again, he had organised a secret defence training squad right under Umbridge’s nose so if anyone was an expert on the matter...Draco sighed and shook his head. Sometimes, he honestly wondered how he had ever mistaken Potter for a bumbling, inept fool. Running an underground fight club called Dumbledore’s Army in a time when
James gave it a good five seconds before taking the proffered hand and shaking it firmly. He took his time, sizing up this…interloper in their midst. So
Draco followed without any more protests.
As if.
“You’re telling me,” Draco drawled. “In my defence, I wasn’t thinking clearly. It was...all a bit much at the time.”
All this trouble and now he couldn’t even say what he needed to say!
“Come on,” she laughed, herding her baffled boy indoors. “Let’s get you some pudding. And we’ll make a plate for your father and his new best friend too.”
The bloke blinked again. He had long eyelashes. Draco couldn’t help but notice them behind those awful glasses. “Yeah,” he replied slowly. “Is there something I can help you with?”
maybe? That brew is full of monkshood, how can you be so careless?! It can’t be good for the…”
“Potter,” Draco groaned. “It’s...a little more complicated than that. I’m trying, I swear I’m trying but I don’t know how to do this! I just...I’ve never been so overwhelmed and...”
Granger smiled faintly and sat across from him. The Room was littered with soft, plushy cushions and he couldn’t help but notice the relief they brought to his aching back. Lately, everything seemed to hurt. His back. His head. His stupid, stupid heart. Admittedly, that last one he brought upon himself.
“Listen, you...”
“Mmhm,” Draco replied. He could hardly disagree, given the circumstances. “Do you like it?”
James gasped in relief and delight as he spotted the orange flickers of the fireplace. The gargoyle statue observed him with a stony, not entirely approving expression as he dug around behind it and retrieved the Floo Powder. He turned the jar in his hands, still considering. Did he really want to do this? Did he really want to tell his parents he didn’t want to be here, in this wonderful magical school that every wizard and witch dreamed of attending? Would they be angry? Disappointed?
“Party’s over!” he snarled. “Everybody get out
To think that he’d gone centuries without this. It’s almost enough to make him mourn.
Pomfrey pursed her lips. “I...suppose that depends on how you feel about it.”
Harry gave up. He threw his arms up in defeat and fixed Draco with an exasperated look. “You know what? Fine. I’m not even going to try. You’ll just have to figure it out on your own.”
Wait, what?
He spotted several switch buttons too — the kind Muggles used to turn on lights or answer a door. Draco pushed one, half expecting a light to go off somewhere but nothing happened. Some small mirrors...at least they were doing what they were supposed to although Draco could hardly guess their purpose on the board. A metal spring welded with a hook; it extended when he pulled it and then sprung back into place. There was also a small section with fabric swatches, buttons and zippers. A shoelace, threaded with beads and tied up to make a zig zag across the board. And that thing, in the corner of the board...he didn’t recognize it. Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. It was glued on too. Flat and squarish, with odd little buttons, numbered from 1 to 9 and the letters C and AC.
“No. Of course not,” Draco said quickly. “Why would I be nervous?”
. Draco tried to clear his head as he moved toward his friends, and then startled as he noticed that Harry was already sitting with them. There was a spot in between Harry and Blaise where Draco assumed he was going to sit. Daphne picked at her food across from Harry, and Greg also looked uncomfortable.
“Trick me?” Harry stopped and looked at him. “No, of course not! That’s not why I’m showing this to you.”
Draco immediately became defensive. “I wasn’t—I mean I was just needed some air. It’s a nice view up there. I wasn’t trying to...”
He stopped by a window—it was snowing, the first really fluffy snow of the season. It brought a smile to his face, and he tried to let thoughts about Theo blow away with the cold wind.
“Anyway, then we went to Hogsmeade and it did not go well. I was supposed to meet up with Hermione later, and I told her that, and she accused me of—“
“F—Father?” Draco said the greeting like a question—he was that unsure of the man sitting across from him.
“George and I are just trying to, you know...” Ron lowered his voice. “Spy on the competition. See what products they have that we don’t, try and make ours better.”
? The answer was that Narcissa would do whatever was best for her family. So Draco nodded and allowed Harry to pull them both back under the Cloak. As they exited the area of the courts, Draco knowingly stopped using Occlumency, opened his mind, and said a silent prayer for his mother. Though he knew that she wasn’t in his mind listening to his thoughts, he hoped that somehow she heard him.
Draco shifted so that he could lay down. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to stay awake all night and was ready to admit defeat. As per usual. So he did the next best thing he knew how to do.
He tentatively entered his bedroom, as though someone would be waiting for him on the other side. For some odd reason he was surprised to find the room empty. He almost expected his own ghost to be curled up in the bed like he was all summer, barely able to move and sick nearly every day.
“Well,” Draco said, contemplating. “I guess I don’t know. All my friends’ parents have marriage contracts, and I assume they began with relationship contracts. Betrothal contracts only ended in our families about a century ago. And I don’t have any friends who aren’t...” He trailed off. Before, not having any friends who had mixed blood was something to be proud of, but now he was ashamed.
Surprisingly, Draco had to suppress strong feelings of jealousy as he watched Harry gaze into Cho Chang’s eyes. She was crying about Cedric Diggory, and Harry appeared so moved by her grief that he leaned in to kiss her. Since his eyes were closed so early, they bumped noses a bit. Then the memory became hazy as Draco felt Harry try and alter it. Cho Chang’s dark black hair turned blonde, and her figure shrank in volume but stretched in size as her body became a man’s...
that, but it was really stupid and I didn’t mean it. Seeing him in that oaf’s arms—“ she poked him with her wand “—fine, Hagrid’s arms, was one of the scariest moments of my life. If you think I enjoyed the Dark Lord living in my house, then you’re right batty.”
Harry thought for a moment. “I guess it’s both. You cared about yourself that much to tell everyone something that was very difficult for you. That’s at least a type of bravery.”
Draco wanted to believe her—he did want to feel better. He wanted to not freak out every time something mildly bad happened to him. He wanted to fall into bed at night not afraid of the nightmares that were to come. He wanted his energy back, he wanted his spirit back. “I don’t see how sitting here and talking to you for an hour a week will help me feel better.”
Draco was silent as he gave Harry a few moments to bask in the memory. Finally, he took out his wand, which the Professor had given him access to beforehand. “
As always, let me know what you think! Love you guys.
Draco was ready to pull off the Cloak, but paused and stared at him. “How do you mean?”
Potter sighed. “Fair enough.”
Draco was frustrated by how often lately he had been speechless. “Lovegood, you shouldn’t be thanking me,” he finally said, looking down at his feet. “You were imprisoned in the dungeon. I’m—“
“Just start small,” Gregory echoed what Daphne had said earlier.
Draco found it hard to meet Hagrid’s eyes. He was grateful and embarrassed. He also couldn’t forget the fact that he tried his very best to get Hagrid fired, both in his third and fifth year. It was almost easier to confront mistakes and wrongdoings from the past few years than from before he became a Death Eater. Even though the former memories were much more traumatic, he was not one hundred percent in control of his situation. In his younger years, he was just a jerk.
“There’s been enough talk of power in the past few years. You could have been the most powerful wizard in the world for a few months there and you didn’t even know it!”
When the two arrived, Harry sighed. “I’m starved. Three Broomsticks?”
“Right, but I was with you. We were all with you. If you had gotten caught, we could have helped you, and at least I would have gotten caught with you.”
“We’ll be going now,” Daphne said discreetly, taking Draco’s arm and steering him toward the Great Hall. Draco really did want to take a nap, but he also wanted to get away from Luna.
He did not get a chance to clarify Professor McGonagall’s question as Mr. Burke appeared in the fireplace. The old man looked even more aged and tired, as he carried a bulging briefcase no doubt filled with notes, evidence, and counter-evidence. He sat heavily in the chair as Professor McGonagall took her leave, giving them some space.
“Fuck.” Draco tried to stand, drawing the attention of Hagrid’s giant dog. He stumbled and immediately sat back down, waiting to try again.
“Oof!” Someone crashed into him—he had been lost in thought and not paying attention to his surroundings. Draco went sprawling down onto the floor, but thankfully was still covered by the cloak that could contain at least two full grown adults. He scurried to the wall and pressed his back to it as the person he collided with looked confused.
Draco shoved Potter’s hand off of him, sat up straighter, and put his head in his hands, still trying to even his breathing. His stomach rolled, and he turned away from Potter to vomit into the grass.
“Draco! Draco wake up! It’s me!” Draco usually woke up unaware of his surroundings after a nightmare like that, but this time he knew exactly where he was and what was happening. He shoved Potter away and opened a drawer in his nightstand to get out the mirror he used for this express purpose. He opened his mouth—his regrown tongue was still there. He touched it—it was still there, only a light white line marking where his old tongue was sliced off. He gasped and felt as though he were choking on the tears that slid down his face. Why did he have to have that nightmare tonight? That was one of the worst ones, it made him never want to speak again, even though that’s why he received the punishment in the first place—
“It is neither of those things, Draco. It is not a condition exclusive to Muggles and it is not a disease. It merely means that you have seen things that now adversely affect you in your day-to-day life. But it is entirely treatable, and we can have you feeling so much better.”
’s quips this summer but I hate the press, and the crowds. Second, Hermione is one of the Head Girls, and Ron didn’t come back. Ginny’s a prefect, so are a lot of the others. So I’m on my own until we get to school.” Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. He wasn’t surprised that he wasn’t asked to play a leadership role for the new school year, despite his past as a prefect. He also wasn’t surprised that the remainder of “Dumbledore’s Army” were elevated to higher standing. “So...er, can I sit here?” Potter moved to sit.
“I’m your escort,” he said roughly. He wasn’t wearing Auror garb but something similar, and had his wand clenched in his fist.
Greg raised an eyebrow, looking doubtful. “I can’t give you proper advice if you don’t tell me the truth, mate.” Draco sighed, looking like he might crack. Greg leaned forward excitedly. “I promise I won’t tell anyone, I’ll even make the Unbreakable Vow if you want—“
“You won’t have to,” Draco said firmly. “The Ministry is taking care of it, it’ll be okay.”
That night, Draco and Harry both slipped on their pajamas. Draco’s hands were shaking as he buttoned his shirt, and he kept stealing glances at Harry from the side. He had known tonight would be difficult, but now that he was going to break the law tomorrow morning, he felt even worse. He wanted nothing more than to feel Harry beside him and take in his warmth. But he didn’t want to disrespect Harry’s wishes to take their relationship more slowly.
. While Yarney was making sure Narcissa’s chains were secured, Draco took the time to truly look at his mother. She had certainly lost weight, but didn’t look skeletal. Her face was the palest Draco had ever seen it, and she had dark circles under her eyes. However, Draco could still see the same spark in her as he had always been able to, even if that spark was dimmer now. He felt intense relief to actually see her and know that she was still alright.
She tilted her head, and Draco caught the smallest hint of a smile. It failed to warm him. “You
Everyone was gathered around the living space, mostly sorted by house. Blaise, Daphne, and Gregory sat at a table, talking softly. The Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws seemed somewhat intermingled, munching on breakfast pastries that someone must have brought or made. Hermione and Neville were sitting on a couch they had moved to the center, facing everyone, while Harry talked with the other Gryffindors on the floor in front of them. By a quick count, it seemed that Draco was the last one up. Potter nodded his head at Draco, who moved to sit at the table with the Slytherins.
“Apparently we’re only rooming two-by-two,” Daphne chimed in. “To give us some privacy. I don’t think it’s a terrible idea, actually.”
Lucius had mentioned Draco’s extra year as though it was his choice to go back rather than moving onto an unofficial job of lobbying at the Ministry. “I have. Blaise, Daphne, Gregory, and I have grown close.”
Harry sighed behind him and did the same, grabbing some nightclothes and leaving the room toward the restroom they shared with Neville and Gregory. After hearing the door close, Draco sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands. He grabbed strands of his hair and started pulling slightly at them, just enough to feel the ache in his scalp. He felt as though there were a second Battle of Hogwarts taking place inside of him.
Draco suppressed a shudder at Harry saying the Dark Lord’s name, but the young man used it so nonchalantly nowadays that he was nearly used to it. “I still think he would have done something. You were always his favorite.”
“Well, keep it that way. You shouldn’t be tied up in any more of this than you need to be.”
“Mother, I understand that, but I really don’t want to marry Pansy. I really don’t.”
Draco assumed that, in between these realizations, he had been sleeping, but it didn’t feel like it when he woke up. Every bone in his body protested and his head felt extraordinarily heavy. He opened his eyes, finally, to sunshine, and a sleepy Harry sitting in a giant armchair near him. Maybe he hadn’t left during the night at all.
people to stop telling him what he does and doesn’t need! He’s a human being for Merlin’s sake!”
“Would it be dangerous if I told people?”
“Why?”
Draco already had most of his work done from his week in isolation. He also knew he wouldn’t be able to focus on anything right now. “I’m alright. I’m going to try and get some rest. Here’s your blanket back.”
Lucius scoffed. “Darling, don’t you know that the universe is out to get us? Even if I manage to not get arrested again, they’re going to take the entire family fortune. They’re going to ruin any prospects the Malfoys have for redemption, and if they don’t, our son will.” Draco balked at Lucius speaking about him like he wasn’t in the room. Though his father sounded more lucid, the words coming out of his mouth did not.
“Hey, Hermione is visiting Ron tonight and I’m not sure what Neville is up to. Is there any chance I could sit with you at dinner?”
Most of the room groaned at the realization that their relationship with their roommates did not end in the dormitory. However, Draco found that he was a little relieved. He and Potter have been able to get along quite well over the past day, and at least Draco knew that he was safe with Potter.
Hagrid blinked at Draco, seeming a little taken aback. “Yer welcome. ‘S no problem, good ter have the company.”
“I’ve never actually wanted him dead.” She looked at him doubtfully. “Yeah, I
“What happened?” Harry said quietly. “You’re shaking like a leaf.”
“Great,” Draco said sarcastically, and started to pick up his bag.
or whatever—I certainly don’t like it, but I’ll make it useful when it comes to people I care about.”
“I’m sorry that happened to you. I have to go.” Luna started to say something in response but Draco pushed past her and bolted for the nearest restroom.
What exactly is this blooming relationship between Malfoy and Potter, and what does it mean for the Wizarding World? If anyone has any information, they are encouraged to contact...”
“No, Potter, you really don’t.” Justin turned to Draco, his eyes narrowed and fists clenched. “Do you know what this summer has been like for me? My sister can’t even drink a cup of tea without it spilling everywhere. She has permanent damage from you torturing her dozens of times! And yet you’re here while she’s in a long term program at Mungo’s learning how to write properly again. How can you live with yourself?” He stood, seeming ready to duel, and Draco put his hand in his robe pocket to grip his cold and unfamiliar wand.
Harry jumped. “Yeah. Yeah.”
Harry glared at him. “You know, you should learn to accept help Draco, because clearly you need it.” Harry gathered his things and left, slamming the door behind him.
“So you’re going to stay with Harry?”
Draco heard the trunk across from him slam shut and jerked awake with a groan. He sat up slowly and saw Potter grinning at him sheepishly. “Sorry about that, it slipped.”
Harry made to leave, and Draco grabbed his arm. “Please...please don’t go...” Draco lay back down in defeat.
Draco turned and buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. “I know you will.”
“No, of course not. I’ve just been trying to think of the perfect thing for us to do, that’s all. I don’t want to let you down,” he said quietly.
Having finally gotten away, Draco took one more look at Harry before he left. He actually felt pretty good. Talking to Harry about the Weasley’s had made him realize how much pain lingered in them all. If he felt as bad as he did, not having lost anyone too significant in the war, he couldn’t imagine how Ginny felt.
“There’s going to be a lot of people telling both of us that we shouldn’t do it. All I ask of you is that if you break up with me, it’s because you don’t want to be with me. Then I’d accept it fully. But if it’s because of what other people are saying, it will actually break my heart.”
“What?” Draco stopped pulling on his robes, his heart racing.
“But—they’re just in Azkaban, just like that? Why aren’t they under house arrest until a trial?”
The home had certainly seen better days, and was not being touched at all, apparently not even for preservation purposes. The window panes were shattered and the door was slightly off its hinges. Draco shuddered at the sight, almost feeling the Dark Lord’s presence.
“I don’t know what happened. I had a conversation with him a short while before he started acting oddly,” Greg whispered. “We talked about some heavy stuff, and since we were talking about Vince I told him I was gay. Do you think that’s why he’s being all weird?”
He thankfully found it empty, and began scratching his thoughts:
Noticing Draco’s discomfort, Harry changed the subject. “Could you imagine our faces a few years ago if we told ourselves that we were sitting at a restaurant together, holding hands?”
Everything was fine when he was the one walking down the hallway, able to open and close doors at will. Problems only arose when someone else tried to get in. And with Potter as a roommate, even the past twenty-four hours, Draco felt like Harry was flinging open doors left and right without a care in the world. Draco wasn’t sure how much longer he could pick up the spilled contents and put them back without one or two emotions or memories escaping for good.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I spend a lot of time with Teddy, I told you he’s my godson.”
“But, Draco, today I want to just ask you some questions and try and diagnose you so I can see how best I can help you during our time together.”
He felt like he was still arguing with himself when later he entered the Great Hall. He had spent the past hour staring at himself in the bathroom mirror with Moaning Myrtle chatting in the background. Opening up to her was easy because he knew that whatever she said, people weren’t like to believe her. However, Draco still took care to leave specific names out of the situation. Myrtle wouldn’t suspect the boy he was talking about was Harry Potter, considering she witnessed what she thought was the two of them trying to kill each other two years prior.
“Yeah mate, we heard you got attacked. They have to let you use magic now, right?” Blaise glanced at the manacle on Draco’s wrist.
“Yeah.” Harry sighed, and Draco looked at him expectantly, knowing that he wasn’t telling the truth. “It’s just...the concept of Voldemort coming back. Being brought back using a Time Turner. I just don’t want to have to do it all again,” he finished in a small voice.
Everyone seemed to ignore him as they all sat thinking. Then Greg spoke up. “What if we all just went in as ourselves?” The students looked at him. “Potter could say that he wanted to talk to the Minister about the new cooperation between Slytherins and Gryffindors, or the new memorial, or whatever, really. The Minister would listen to Potter. Then Draco would get in of his own accord, and then we could somehow slip him into the Wizengamot. It’s certainly less risky than trying to get him into the entire Ministry unnoticed.”
“What if...what if he’s right? I mean, he did tell me not to go anywhere or do anything or it may mess things up with my parents—“
“Well, no but I’m a Death Eater and I’m their son—“
“The wards were faint, as we hadn’t renewed them in a while, but unbroken,” Narcissa stated. “As far as we know, there was nothing else missing.” The murmurs of the crowd began to sound panicked. A missing Time Turner was an enormous danger, especially with so many violent Death Eaters still at large. Even Harry shifted uncomfortably beside Draco. Draco looked down and realized they were both clutching each other’s hand. He wasn’t sure when that had happened.
I’m thinking about making this a multiple series work. What do you guys think? It’s already like nearly 40k words and they’ve been through one week of school, lol. But I still have so much story to tell! Let me know.
Harry made eye contact with Draco. “She lied to Voldemort, one of the most skilled Occlumens of all time. She can handle Azkaban. I promise.”
“Er—how was your summer?”
“I DON’T HAVE IT, YOU DO! I’VE NEVER HAD IT!” Draco was shouting now, his right arm burning all the way up, just like the Mark did, as his body begged to release some of its anger in the form of magic. “This is just a fucking ruse so that you all feel better about the fact that you can’t change the past. No one can, not even with that goddamn Time Turner. The people you love are hurt and dead, and you want someone to blame. It’s not going to be me this time.” Draco stood up to leave, but a burly looking Ravenclaw blocked his path.
“Yeah. I just feel ridiculous.” He had been ill for the past few days. Harry had wanted him to go to the Hospital Wing, but Draco knew all too well what was going on. This was reminiscent of the entire summer when he fought to keep simple foods down and battled clammy hands and a nervous stomach. “I thought all this was over with. I thought I was done with this.” Draco was frustrated with himself that he regressed this far.
Nearly an hour passed with the Gryffindors and Shacklebolt chatting merrily, and the clock was ticking. Draco had to get out of here. The Invisibility Cloak brushed against his trembling hand—
Also a note about scheduling: this weekend is my anniversary with my boyfriend, so I likely won’t have a chapter out until Sunday or even Monday. After that, I’ll be going on vacation for Thanksgiving, so chapters may not be as regular for that week. Then we’ll get back on track though!
“Afternoon. I’m here for a visit to Z7I2 and Z7I3.”
Though he was adept at secrecy, his behavior did not go unnoticed by the other Slytherins. One evening he heard Blaise and Goyle talking in the hallway while he was brushing his teeth in the bathroom.
“Do I ever.” Draco had tortured many of its members over the past year.
Hermione walked over and looked at some of the crumpled papers next to Draco. “This is really sweet,” she said. “I doubt they’ll listen, but it needs to be said. I wouldn’t tell Harry, though, he’ll just tell you you’re wasting your time.”
Draco had decided not to tell Harry about his nightmare the previous night, or about the encounter he had with Ginny Weasley. Apparently she decided to also keep it a secret, because Harry didn’t mention anything to him. Time passed normally throughout the rest of the week. Draco and Harry did make a conscious effort to increase the amount of time they spent together in public to test the waters. Harry would go to dinner with his friends on the earlier side and then would stay for Draco and his friends. Draco assured Harry that his avoidance of seeing Hermione and Neville wasn’t due to dislike, but because he wanted to avoid jeers from others. Blaise, Daphne, and Greg were really coming around to like Harry, though. Harry and Greg both had a soft side, and he could bicker playfully with Blaise for the whole meal. Daphne and Harry didn’t speak much, but she was always kind to him.
“I understand that,” Draco said quietly. As much as he didn’t want to be at Hogwarts, he was glad that he had a year until he had to really decide what he was going to do with his existence. “I’m really sorry that...that he passed. I know that it’s somewhat my fault.”
“Yeah, she was trying to get me to say who it was. She just doesn’t get it though. You don’t either. And I’m not even saying that...er, what I mean is I’m not angry. You just don’t understand what it’s like to be this hated, and you never will.
The afternoon was no better for Draco. He botched all of his spells in Charms and Transfiguration, barely managing to get a passing grade on his quizzes. He was also starting to feel a little ill—not in the familiar way that he had all summer, but rather feverish. By the time he sank next to Harry into Potions, he was trembling.
Draco gripped the back of the chair in front of McGonagall’s desk and leaned on it heavily, feeling like he may pass out. Professor McGonagall stood up and helped him sit. He sat breathing heavily for a few minutes, unable to think, unable to move—he could only try his best to contain the anxiety deep inside of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
” He didn’t even have to yell. The same wisp flew out of his wand, but this time it formed fully. Draco couldn’t even concentrate on what the small creature was, but rather had to put all his energy forth into controlling the spell. It was one of the most powerful things he had ever felt. The creature rumbled around, and a few seconds later it was gone.
“To—to the house?”
One early October night, Draco was completely unable to fall asleep, even though Potter was already snuggled in next to him. He sighed as he listened to Harry’s even breathing, and quietly crept out of the room. He found Greg sitting by the fire in a similar position to how he had found him a few weeks ago. Draco poured himself a cup of fresh tea that he assumed Greg had made, and sat beside him, but further from the flames. The two sat in amicable silence for a while, until finally Draco spoke.
“Don’t—“ Harry started.
“That was...interesting. You didn’t have to scare them like that though, they mean well.”
Ron looked at Harry for a long while. Then his gaze switched over to Draco. “Harry tells me you’re trying to be a better person,” he said, as if Draco hadn’t been sitting there while Harry was talking to him. “But what exactly are you trying to do here?”
Draco sighed and sat down heavily. “It’s not so much about that, I’m not sure Lovegood wouldn’t have expected or wanted me to do anything. I’m not even sure it would have helped. I think it’s just...how we’ve treated people in the past, you know? We all called her Looney, and she is a little out there, but it was all fun and games until she was literally imprisoned. I just—“ Draco wanted to stop before he opened too many of his doors and was too vulnerable. “Nevermind. It was a stupid thing I did.”
“I need some air.”
His stomach turned—he had not eaten much at the banquet but it was certainly enough for a whole day—maybe two. He was thinking about his classes from last year—the information that is, trying to refresh himself on spells and potions before continuing his education, when he felt himself jerk awake.
It was extremely fitting to him. A Malfoy dying not a heroic death, not even a notorious death of a villain, but a completely avoidable, mediocre death.
,” he said as quietly as he could, not wanting to disturb Potter’s concentration.
“I saw Goyle. Why aren’t you sitting with him?”
“Draco, tell me what you’re feeling right now.”
Harry stroked Draco’s palm with his thumb. “I really don’t think your mother would let Lucius throw you out. She loves you more than anything.” Draco knew Harry was right, but Harry also didn’t understand the influence his father had in the household.
Draco feigned going to the library, but instead headed out to the lake to get some fresh air and think about Potter’s proposition. With his potions still in his book bag, he felt very much at a crossroads: one between physical health and weakness, and between friendship and isolation. Throwing rocks into the lake absentmindedly, he couldn’t figure out which he wanted, or which he deserved.
“I’m not sure,” Draco said. “My mother hasn’t been able to visit him yet. Since she’s on house arrest, the visits have to be Ministry scheduled.” He shifted the clothes one more time and then closed his trunk.
“Silence. We shall continue,” Hale thundered. “How did Nott Sr. react when you informed him of your decision?”
Draco didn’t really know what to say to that. His mind was filled with memories of the Death Eater meeting where the Dark Lord taunted Draco about babysitting Nymphadora and Lupin’s kids. “Didn’t they have a kid?”
“That’s good to hear. How are you finding your time back in Hogwarts?”
“It’s hard to write,” Ginny said softly. Everyone stopped murmuring to look at her. “For a lot of reasons. Mainly because of how many times you and your friends put me under the Cruciatus curse last year. My hands shake. And sometimes the words move across the page and distort themselves because of the stupid diary your father put into my cauldron when we were young. Do you know how it feels to be possessed? Every night I run through everything I did that day to make sure I remember each hour, to make sure there are no gaps.”
“I never asked him to save my life,” Draco fired back.
When Draco woke up the next morning, Potter was already gone. Draco reached his hand out and felt the part of the bed where Potter had slept—it was still warm. He was horrified with himself, not only for his various gross displays of emotions yesterday, but for allowing Potter to sleep next to him. Potter must think him such a child, so immature. Though he was alone in the room, Draco’s face glowed bright red with embarrassment.
Finally, Yarney came back. “You can go,” he said, and held the door open for Draco. Draco stood up tentatively—it was really that easy? He thought he’d better not question anything lest Yarney change his mind. Yarney led Draco back to his office where Draco floo’ed back to Hogwarts.
Draco was somehow both comforted and hurt by what Greg said. “Wow, I’m not sure I’ve ever heard you talk seriously for that long in your life,” he said somewhat jokingly.
Draco looked at her with hope. “Can—can we just sit here, and you can give me a good report? That’s the only thing that will help any of this.”
“Oh yeah,” Harry frowned at Draco’s wrist. “I had a conversation with McGonagall about what happened.”
“Now, which arm was the cut on?” Draco lifted up his right sleeve, very grateful that his left arm wasn’t attacked. The light imprint of the skull and snake still stood out to him everytime he took a shower, and so even in the summer he preferred long sleeves. “Ms. Granger healed this, yes?” Draco nodded. “She did a decent job, but you will have a small scar. It doesn’t look to be infected, so that’s good.”
Their conversation was interrupted by a crash on the window. An owl hooted disdainfully and righted itself on the windowsill. Dean Thomas opened it and took the parchment from the owl, who ruffled its feathers to ward off any snow. “It’s for you, Malfoy.”
Draco was tired now, and he desperately wanted to sleep. He tried to convey this to Harry, but his tongue felt like it was made of lead—his tongue! Is that why he couldn’t speak? Did he not have it anymore? “Harry, I left—“
Draco made eye contact with Harry, who to his great annoyance looked amused. Draco glared. “Like I said Potter, these are my last moments of peace. I don’t need stupid little Potter groupies ruining any second.”
“As you know, Draco was forced to take the Mark at the age of sixteen. He was tortured dozens of times, so much that he would stand in a room and forget where he was, that his hands would tremble when he picked up a glass. He was made to do humiliating things under the Imperious Curse. The Dark Lord forced him to torture others, both with the Cruciatus Curse and by other means.”
Finally Yarney stood back. “You have ten minutes.”
“Father, listen to me. I’m not sure you’re thinking clearly—“
“Those potions are going to make you stronger. So you can clear your name.”
Harry bit his lip. “They’re trying to bring Voldemort back. At least, that’s what Kingsley tells me.” Draco couldn’t believe Harry was on a first name basis with the Minister of Magic—actually, it made sense. He shuddered at the prospect of the Dark Lord coming back. “They suspect that Nott has a Time-Turner.”
“This past Saturday, Harry Potter was spotted at Hogsmeade village. This is not unusual, as the so-called “eighth year” Hogwarts students are able to visit Hogsmeade each weekend, and Potter is often spotted there with his friends. However, this time he was accompanied by none other than Draco Malfoy, a confirmed Death Eater who narrowly escaped imprisonment in no small part due to Potter’s testimonies in his favor in court.
Hermione, Neville, and Harry looked at Draco to see if he minded including the Slytherins, while Draco was looking at them for the same reason. He gave a nod and smile to his friends, and brought them up to speed. Surprisingly, no one tried to tell Draco that this was a stupid idea or that he was crazy. They were all supportive, and more shockingly, very willing to work together. Greg and Neville mused about different disguise options to each other while Daphne, Blaise, and Hermione worked out some of the optics. Harry and Draco smiled at each other, and Draco felt like he was a part of something bigger—a feeling he had experienced before as a Death Eater, but this time was proud of it rather than horrified with himself.
“You...you still want to spend time with me?” Harry pushed the glass of water into Draco’s hand.
Still shaky from the nightmare, Draco’s heart dropped into his stomach. He was almost back at Hogwarts, the place where he planned his Headmaster’s death and almost executed it, the place where he tortured first years—don’t think about it don’t think about it don’t think about it
Harry was silent for a few moments, and Draco reveled in Harry’s slow circles on his palms. “So...your panic attack...?”
“You could never make me proud.” Lucius glanced at Yarney. “Are we finished here?”
“That’s—that’s fair. If my grades suffer, I’ll go,” Draco said. He wasn’t sure he had ever had a conversation this long with Professor McGonagall, or this civil.
After what seemed like ages but was probably only a few minutes, Draco saw a flash of blond hair. Yarney entered the room with Narcissa and shut the door behind him, the glow of his Patronus brightening the room.
I think we deserved a very fluffy chapter! So sorry for not having updated. It has been really crazy, as I’m sure you can imagine. We only have a few more chapters in this installment before we’re done! What would you all like to see next? More of Harry and Draco, or something else? Maybe a time jump? Let me know. As always, all comments are appreciated. I love you all and I hope you’re staying safe.
“I’m just saying, I thought I saw you smile earlier and I nearly fell off my broom. It’s kind of nice to be back at it again—“
Looking around, Draco saw Gregory Goyle, also skulking near the back of the train station. He, too, was alone; his father was in Azkaban, and Draco was not sure where his mother was. He looked thinner than Draco had ever seen him—likely Vincent Crabbe’s death did a number on him. But at least Draco knew he would have one friend to help him survive the year. He mustered his face into what he hoped was a friendly and warm expression. Greg caught his eye, and Draco nodded encouragingly. Gregory Goyle glared at him and turned away.
Harry sighed in tandem. “I should have known she’d be upset. I guess it’s just so obvious to me that you’re not a threat.”
“Why aren’t you Head Boy? Saint Potter and all.”
“Oh,” Draco scoffed. “You won’t believe this—I was trapped in a compartment with Saint Potter. I boarded the train early to try and find an empty one and he goes barging in, disturbing my peace, and insisted on staying.”
Narcissa got up shakily and walked over to the looming chair in the center of the courtroom. As soon as she sat down gingerly and placed her hands on the armrests, chains engulfed her wrists. She jumped at the noise, but other than that looked quite composed. Draco felt a swell of pride for his mother, who rarely looked shaken by anything as the Malfoy matriarch. He also felt horrible at how painfully thin she looked.
Even the eighth year table was a part of this celebration. Their table was particularly adorned with fineries, and gave the recently reacquainted plenty to talk about. The only four students who didn’t seem pleased with the affair were Draco and his friends. Draco felt a guilty pit in his stomach. No one was paying him any attention, though possibly due to his being concealed at the back of the Hall.
And now, she was still showing him kindness. Even her suffering at the hands of his family did not break her spirit.
Professor McGonagall waited at the entrance where Draco, Gregory, Daphne, and Blaise were gawking at the bright scene before them. She looked better than she had last year, Draco noticed, but was still aged more than she should have been since Draco first walked through this hall as a first year. Despite the sufferings of last year, her eyes gleamed, and Draco was surprised when she met his gaze and gave him a small smile. “Ah, good to see you four. Please have a seat at the new table for eighth-years.” She gestured to the small back table.
“Er...” Draco forgot how clueless Potter could be. “I think they’re busy.”
ready to send in the morning, thinking about his conversation with Hermione Granger. He truly couldn’t believe how much she and he had talked this term, and how civil they were being toward each other. Apologizing didn’t feel so difficult anymore. Before it was as though every apology he made only had relief a long time after, and until then they smothered him. Now it felt natural to admit mistakes, it felt safe. He just wanted to stop feeling so guilty after talking to Hermione. It still felt like he was disobeying his parents. In a way he was, but he was eighteen now.
Draco Malfoy had successfully asked Harry Potter out on a date.
Finally he finished his story and was gasping, Harry still rubbing circles on his back. “Malfoy,” Harry said, causing Draco to look at him suddenly—he didn’t often use Draco’s last name. “That’s awful. I’m serious. You don’t deserve that.”
Draco sighed in frustration and finished gathering his things. He took a moment to sit on the bed and catch his breath, steadying himself against the post. It was going to be a long day.
“You’re welcome. I want to see you back in a week to check your weight and some of these deficiencies. Let me go grab your potions—oh, hello Mr. Potter!” Draco turned to find that Harry Potter walking toward them. He immediately averted his eyes, feeling embarrassed.
“Merlin, so many things.” Draco sighed. “But particularly for making such a scene. I should have warned you that if she were there she may react like that.” Draco didn’t even feel like he deserved to say Madame Rosmerta’s name.
As promised, Draco got up at around eleven the next morning to prepare to help Potter with his Potions homework—the latter of which was already gone. He stifled a yawn as he got ready for the day. The previous night had been a late one. When he and Potter returned to the common room, both boys’ groups were waiting for them. Taking advantage of Longbottom having waited with Granger in the living space for Potter, Greg pulled the other three Slytherins into his room to discuss what happened. Draco was honest with them, feeling a little more comfortable talking to his friends after practicing by talking to his former nemesis. They expressed their sympathies before the conversation turned toward Potter.
All of a sudden the world shifted beneath him, and he saw the brightest light and heard a train whistle. He giggled—maybe he was going back to Hogsmeade? He hoped his mother would be there, he needed to give her a present.
Draco finally boards the Hogwarts Express—and has a shocking compartment companion
“Tell me about one of them.”
No angst today! You guys deserve some romance. We’ll get back into sort of the “plot” next time, and we’ll see how Draco can rely on Harry now that they’re together. As always, let me know what you think! Love you guys.
“Well, yeah, we were close friends. Our parents were in the middle of deciding on a betrothal contract. But that doesn’t mean we were together.”
Then again, when was he ever good at scheming? His plans in sixth year had nearly killed two students unintentionally. Perhaps he could confide in his friends from Slytherin. Then again, they weren’t looked upon favorably by society as it was. He didn’t want to involve them unless it was absolutely necessary.
“Fine.”
“Oh, Dragon,” she sat down gingerly, as if the motion hurt her. “How are you? Are you alright?”
“I understand,” Harry said with a sad smile. “We’ll always be here for you.”
I had always wondered, what happened to like the hundreds of Death Eaters right after Harry killed Voldemort? Like there’s no way the Aurors could have rounded them all up at once—most of them had to flee. Anyway sorry to leave you on a cliffhanger, I’ll try to have the next one out by Friday! Let me know what you think. Love to all, especially my loyal readers!!!
Draco was getting more and more agitated by the second. He was also angry with himself for being so concerned about these trivial things.
“I can meet with you tomorrow, Mr. Potter. There are still many people I need to talk with tonight about what transpired today. Goodnight, you two.” Professor McGonagall shut the door, leaving Harry and Draco looking at each other blankly.
Stepping off of the train, Draco looked around frantically for platinum blonde hair. Instead he was faced with an older stranger, holding a sign that bore his name. “Mr. Malfoy? Your parents sent me to collect you.” Of course his parents wouldn’t come—Draco understood they still weren’t allowed in public. Draco allowed the man to lead him to a black, sleek car outside the station. Despite cars being a Muggle invention, Draco knew the Floo network in his house was shut down, and he was sure there were wards for apparation. Sending a car was the best option, but Draco still felt annoyance inside of him. This was just prolonging the inevitable.
Draco took a moment to think. “Sort of what you said. He’s the only one who can make everything...quieter, you know? In a good way. Everything’s just so loud inside my head sometimes, thinking about everything that happened in the past few years and everything I have left to go through. But when I’m with him I can sort of just...be. He treats me the same whether I’m having a good day or bad, and he comforts me when needed. He drives my days and my life forward. I just want to hold him and make him feel as good as I feel when I’m around him.”
Draco’s father exhaled sharply through his nose. “That is one thing that he will never have. You need to be careful, Draco. It’s fine to be close to him
“Someone knew you were going to be here today, Mr. Potter. We’re just trying to take every precaution to ensure your safety.”
Everyone sat in silence for a few moments. Draco was used to his parents occasionally bickering, but about nothing as serious as this. He almost willed the escort to come back in and announce that the half hour had passed. This was too reminiscent of what happened nearly every day for the past two years when he and his parents were together—tense silence.
Harry looked around the Hogs Head. He looked nervous. “You look nervous,” Draco said. “Don’t be nervous. They’d want me anyway, not you.” Draco hated the thought of Harry being upset or anxious in any way.
“No,” Draco shook his head. He took a peek outside—it was probably around dinner time. “I’m not that hungry, though.” His stomach filled with dread at the thought of going to the Great Hall right now.
Draco shifted in his chair, thinking about his extremely productive summer lying in bed all day doing nothing. “Probably take care of my mother. I dunno. Make sure she was alright.”
Harry’s words brought a very vague recollection to Draco’s mind. Draco had always assumed that his loving but embarrassing rant was a fever induced dream, since Harry hadn’t mentioned anything. “Oh Merlin,” he said, setting down his mug.
Hermione and Neville, who seemed to be immersed in sketches for the memorial, looked at each other. “What’s going on?” Hermione asked.
“Draco? Draco come on, we’re over halfway. Please.” Harry was panicking and Draco hated it.
He tried to summon the happiest memories of his life. Riding on his toy broom as a child with his father and mother cheering him on. The first time he played the piano. Meeting Vincent and Gregory in his primary school academy. Winter balls at Pansy’s house where the kids snuck out to go sledding at night. His pride at being sorted into Slytherin. Lazy summers in Italy and France with his parents, back when they were happy and in love.
“I can what?”
Draco took Harry’s hand—a bold move, but he was feeling good. He felt even better when Harry smiled back at him. “That went pretty well,” he said tentatively, hoping that Harry felt the same way.
“Hopefully the Wizengamot will approve this late this week. You could be seeing them as soon as next week, but it could also take as long as next month.” Draco shuddered at the thought of his mother being in Azkaban for a month.
“I’m sorry,” Professor McGonagall said after a period of silence. “I know that you were injured today and should take it easy. Do you want to spend the night in the Hospital Wing?”
“Thank Merlin, some decent food,” Blaise said, already on his second plate. “My house elves got taken away by the Ministry for questioning, and the replacements they sent couldn’t cook for their lives—almost literally. My mom went mental after the fifth night of dry chicken in a row.” Draco gave a noncommittal grunt in response as he reluctantly piled some food on his plate. “What about you mate, whatever happened to all your house elves? Did the Ministry take them away?”
“You wouldn’t have...er...done that on the side?”
I am SO sorry for how long it’s been! I’m a campaign manager, so things have been crazy with the upcoming election. But I hope everyone is staying safe. This story is almost complete! I’m still trying to decide what will be next—another part to this one, or something else entirely. But there will be something!
Draco often spent entire summers complaining to his father about Harry Potter. In his younger years, he was still dealing with the rejection of the handshake. Later, he just wanted to talk to someone about Harry’s adventures, and his friends were not only present for most of them but were also sick and tired of hearing about them. Regardless of the topic, complaining was the only way Draco knew how to talk to his father. Lucius would in turn complain to Draco about various business partners at the Ministry, and always ended with a life lesson: “never be the first to name a price in a negotiation,” “if you’re ever faced with an opportunity to conduct business with a foe, take it and deal with the repercussions later,” and  “never assume what someone knows—always ask them directly.” The last one was perhaps one that Draco should take to heart.
“Hell yes, we’re interested,” Blaise pushed past the group and poured himself a small glass. “You guys want some?” Blaise handed them some cups filled to the brim before they could say yes or no. Daphne and Gregory drank it gratefully, wincing when it burned down their throat. Draco looked at his cup. He had drank at the Manor when he could get away with it to try and numb some of the pain of what he was seeing. Drinking for enjoyment though? That was something he’d never done. He downed the liquid in just a few gulps, and poured himself another glass.
“Will it just be the two of you?” Blaise asked.
After quickly making himself presentable, Draco walked downstairs to a loud dine-in kitchen. George Weasley was talking to Arthur and Harry about the latest Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products while Ginny was eating some pancakes. Mrs. Weasley immediately straightened when she saw Draco, and shoved him into a chair that already had a full plate.
“He may look all tough on the outside, but his emotions run deep. Especially this upgraded version.” Blaise and Greg nodded along with her.
“How the bloody hell do you know that?”
“Thank you, mother. I’m sure they’ll be perfect.” And, even though Draco thought he would hate the taste forever, even though they were flat from his mother having to use a Muggle recipe for the first time, they were absolutely perfect.
. He leaned back and looked her in the eyes. “I’m going to take care of you now. I promise. You won’t have to worry about any of this happening ever again.” Now that he examined her more closely, he noticed her graying hair and the new wrinkles around her eyes.
“The same could be said for you!” Harry said combatively. “People definitely wouldn’t like you dating me. I’d be fine, at least I have some...societal protection, or whatever. It’s you who I’m worried about.”
Draco cursed, realizing how stupid he had been back in the shack. He should have made a run for it with the Time Turner. If he turned it in himself, he probably would not have gotten into much trouble. He also should have triple checked to make sure it was the one stolen from the Malfoys’—there could be others in existence. The “hows” and “whys” didn’t matter, though. What was he going to do about Harry? He tried to push down any doubt he had about his relationship with the Chosen One.
“Well, it’s honestly not too nice of a house either. We cleaned all day every day for months and it never got any better.”
be terrified of me,” she said, whether to joke with him, convince him, or convince herself, Draco couldn’t say.
Draco tensed beneath Harry’s fingertips. He swallowed thickly before answering. “They told me all their stories. Everything that happened to them because of what I did. It was just overwhelming to hear it all, I guess.” That was an understatement, but Draco didn’t feel that he had the strength to consider it any further right now.
Draco doubted that Potter wanted to be alone. He believed that Potter conveyed that with his attitude, but Draco knew how it felt to pretend to want privacy and really need comfort—or just someone to sit with and ride out the flashbacks. But how was he going to talk to Harry without the other two noticing?
“Would you be alright if I told Andromeda?”
Draco nodded quickly. “That’s—that’s all fair. I understand.”
just saw a sad woman clinging to former glory. Draco wasn’t present at his father’s trial, but he had less doubts that the portrayal of his father as delusional and paranoid was inaccurate.
. Draco was incredibly nervous and felt very unprepared to comfort Harry. What did he know about death? Sure, his grandparents died, but that was supposed to happen. He had certainly seen death over the past year, but no one he cared much about except for Vincent. What would Harry expect him to do?
“Mr. Malfoy, this is for you.” Draco took the note delicately, as if it were a Howler, but it was simply a summons from Professor McGonagall. He tried not to shake as he spoke the password and climbed the gargoyle steps. What he found in the Headmistress’s office, however, was Professor McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt deep in conversation. Draco wasn’t sure he and the new Minister had ever had a conversation. When Kingsley was an Auror, his father always complained about him, saying that he was too new age and inexperienced for the kind of work required. Draco now knew, though, that Lucius was just upset regarding where Kingsley’s loyalties lay.
Draco knew that he wasn’t entering a typical pureblood relationship, and realized with a gulp that he hadn’t entered one at all. How could it completely escape his mind that Harry was not of pure blood? The Potter side was sufficient, but Harry’s mother was Muggleborn. Not only was Draco disobeying his parents by entering in a relationship with a man—lying with the same sex was expected from time to time, but was to be done in secret—but he was going to be with a half-blood wizard. How would he ever be able to tell his parents? His friends were thankfully accepting, because to them blood purity had died with the Dark Lord, but what about his friends’ parents? How would he attend parties? How would he conduct business in the Wizarding world?
“Shhh, I know. I know. It’s alright, the snake is dead—“
As he sat back, breathing deeply, he realized that part of him expected Harry to come in and comfort him. Apparently the sound of his retching hadn’t woken Harry this time. He hugged his knees and wiped his face, wanting some comforting. He wondered if it would be okay to wake Harry up and confess his terrible thoughts. At the same time, the thought of doing so made him even more nauseous. How could he date that same person that, only a year ago, he wished dead? Why would Harry want to date him, after a confession like that?
“I certainly understand that there would be heavy consequences if you decided to date me. And if you decided to tell people that you were dating me,” Draco began, his voice heavy.
He felt like he couldn’t even be elated yet. It was only a matter of time before Potter would surely change his mind and realize what he had gotten himself into. Draco just had to savor the moments until that day came. And he vowed to himself to soak up every touch. Maybe if he gathered enough, he could put the pieces together and make a happy memory.
“That’s probably true...” Smith said, hand on his chin. “What about your parents though, Malfoy? They’re out of Azkaban—well, for now. Do they know?”
returned from home missing you.”
Potter laughed with joy. “I didn’t realize how much I missed this. You?”
“Woah, easy there Malfoy. Just because your father is a failure doesn’t mean you have to take it out on yourself,” The atmosphere cooled significantly after Dean Thomas spoke, everyone quieting down if they hadn’t already. Draco found himself looking around for Potter, but he was nowhere to be found. “Maybe that’s not the reason you’re doing it though. Maybe you’re doing it so that you can find the strength to be around so many Mudbloods, eh?” Many winced at the sarcastic use of the slur, and Draco had to work hard to keep his face unbothered and even. Dean staggered over to Draco and continued as everyone else watched. “I wasn’t imprisoned at your house for long, Malfoy, but I was there long enough to see what a coward you really are.”
“That’s quite kind, but I do not need an escort,” Harry said, confused.
For some reason, the visit to St. Mungo’s seemed to reset his mother. Her posture was different when they got back into the car. She looked confident, strong even. Draco wasn’t sure if this was because she saw a stark contrast between her own sanity and what little remained of her husband’s or something else. But he was relieved and happy to have his mother back. The more he had been thinking about it, he was not ready to become the head of the Malfoy family. He could barely figure out his own life without having to manage billions of Galleons and investments. Some would argue that Narcissa could never be the head of the Malfoy family, but Draco no longer cared about the patriarchy. If Narcissa could defy the Dark Lord, she could run the estate at home.
Finally, the carriage reached at the castle. While Hagrid ushered first years into the Great Hall—
“I definitely understand how you feel. There are things that I still haven’t talked about with my Mind Healer, and I’m not sure I’ll ever be ready. Hermione is always pushing me to talk about things, which is fine if it works for her, but I’m not sure it works for me. Keep trying, though. I’ve been surprised about how much it has helped sometimes to get things off my chest.”
Draco has an emotionally taxing evening, but comes out of it better than he has been in a while.
“Now wait just a second—“
Draco fell asleep on his couch that night—he felt like he would have been at war with himself in the bed. Though some chilly air was sneaking in through the window, he only wrapped himself in Harry’s jacket. This time, it did prevent nightmares.
“You also have family in this one,” Harry said gently. “Teddy is your family.”
“And—and they’re gone?”
“It’s not, really. He was the one who cast the Fiendfyre. Besides, I doubt we would have all made it out of the Battle alive.” Greg sighed. “Thank you though, for your apology. Everything just feels so messed up right now, I don’t know how anything is going to end up being alright.”
Soon after that conversation, Draco’s friends returned to their studies. Draco pulled on one of Harry’s Muggle sweatshirts and climbed into Harry’s bed. Blaise’s words echoed in his head. His life right now was probably the best it had ever been. Draco pretended to sleep when Harry came in, not having the words to express how he felt at that moment. As Harry’s arm settled over Draco’s chest, Draco wondered if he really deserved the treasure sitting next to him.
“I love you too. Take care of yourself, alright?” He made eye contact with his father as he said this, and his father nodded. Draco hoped he could trust his father to take care of Narcissa, trust him to do this one thing right.
Draco scoffed. “Of course not! I actually find it quite revolting how people dote over you.” He instantly regretted what he said. Why would he want to insult the boy he wanted to like him?
When Harry and Draco arrived in Hogsmeade, they then made use of the relatively abandoned Hog Head’s Floo network to travel to Diagon Alley. Harry entered the shop first, without the cloak, and made small talk with the person at the counter before Draco entered as well. The poor shopkeeper that he disturbed upon entry looked confused, as his fireplace had erupted in green flames with no floating head or person waiting to speak with him. Harry took his leave and guided an invisible Draco out the back door, both of them stifling laughs.
“I want you at this school, Draco. Please, if you ever feel—and I’m not saying you did,” she interrupted herself, noticing the protesting look on Draco’s face already. “If you ever feel like harming yourself in any capacity, please come to my office immediately. I won’t tell your parents, I won’t make you discuss anything. I’ll just...” she sighed and looked down, seeming at a loss for words. “I’ll just make you some tea. Alright?”
Draco laughed. “No poison for me anymore, I just burn letters from people I don’t know straight away now. No, I’m fine.”
Mr. Burke sighed and ran a hand over his thinning hair. “Hopefully soon. I don’t even know much, the Aurors are keeping it so under wraps. They have Dolohov now and have been trying to get information from him, but he’s been slow to give it. There’s also business going on with the Notts. Have you had any contact with Theodore Nott?”
“No way, mate,” Blaise cautioned. “You can’t risk that.”
“Look, even if you’re skeptical, it doesn’t hurt to try it. It’s just about techniques to lessen anxiety and handle situations better. I know that we all have nightmares.” Hermione paused and looked around the room for arguments. Most had their heads down in shame, and Draco’s face burned as he studied his shoes. Granger took a deep breath. “Neville, Professor McGonagall, and myself have decided that you all are required to try at least three sessions.” She had her eyes closed, apparently worried about protests, but everyone was surprisingly silent. Pleasantly shocked, she opened her eyes and smiled. “Well—er, great! You all can sign up at Professor McGonagall’s office.”
Draco entered his bedroom, where the curtains were shut and it was pitch black. The darkness reminded him of the prison somehow, and his breath caught in his throat. He began to shake even more wildly, and he couldn’t help but let a sob escape him. He had no way to turn on the lights using magic, so he tried to make his way to the curtain in the dark to let in some of the approaching moonlight. Tears were streaming down his face, and he was trying extremely hard to keep it together until he could muffle his cries with his pillow.
! “Ah goddammit, Merlin’s saggy left—“
As if Ginny could read his mind, she spoke again. “Dolohov, the Carrows—they’re in Azkaban. So we don’t have to worry about them. As for the rest...”
It was all Draco could do to not tap the man on the shoulder and ask him where his mother was now. Draco didn’t give a second thought to his father’s impending trial that afternoon—all he wanted was to be in his mother’s arms. He had been so wrong about so many things, but this he could make right. And he could likely get back to Kingsley’s office without too much questioning as to where he had been. He just needed to find the right room—
Draco cleared his throat. He wasn’t often asked direct questions like that. Draco looked at Harry, who smiled. “He’s...he makes Hogwarts interesting. He lets me make mistakes but also doesn’t let me off the hook. He encourages me to apologize and to be better. He gives me things to look forward to...” Draco stopped there because he was worried he was going to start crying.
He heard Ron murmur to Harry, “Can I talk to you outside for a second?” Harry nodded and told Draco he would be right back, leaving Draco pacing among the shelves. Thankfully the elderly shopkeeper was occupied with counting inventory and didn’t notice the former Death Eater’s skulking.
“Mrs. Malfoy, when do you think your husband will regain his sanity?”
sake,” he snarled with contempt.
“Very well. Will Narcissa Malfoy please present herself for questioning?”
One afternoon Draco was walking back from class when he was confronted by Justin Finch-Fletcher, Ernest Macmillan, and Dean Thomas. Draco’s heart leapt to his throat, as the manacle on his arm left him defenseless in the hallways.
“Mind you, it’s not pleasant. I just can’t do it alone.”
He looked down at Harry, who was now dozing peacefully in his arms. Ginny Weasley was definitely right about one thing. His plans often had horrible, horrible consequences for innocent people that he never answered for. People were forgiving him really easily, but what had he actually done for others? There was no way he could drag Harry into this mess again. He needed to figure this out—not on his own, but by asking the right people for proper help.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, no,” Harry laughed. “He’s still an infant. But maybe someday?”
“I’m not sure you ever get cured,” Harry sighed. “I think you just go into remission, you know? Get better.”
Potter stopped ruffling his clothing and gave a deep sigh. Draco suddenly felt a little guilty for being that harsh right off the bat. Maybe something truly awful had happened. “Potter.” He said, less as a question and more of a command to look at him. Potter’s eyes were red rimmed and tired. “What happened?”
Harry shrugged. “I really did want to relax and spend some time with my friends. I just finished fighting off—dark wizards for years, I didn’t want to go straight into it again.” There was silence, the space made by Harry’s hesitation growing stronger. Draco wasn’t sure he had ever had a real conversation with Harry, so he wasn’t sure how to make it continue, or why he wanted it to continue. “What about you?” Harry asked this quietly, as if Draco was delicate, which he hated. “Why are you back?”
He tried to pay attention to Professor Slughorn’s writing but the room started to sway, the chalkboard blurring together in a mess of white. Draco wondered if that liquid really was some sort of poison. He should tell Potter, he needed to see Madame Pomfrey. His chest didn’t feel right either and was tightening with each breath.
Harry Potter morphed before his eyes with a few simple incantations. His hair became a lighter brown, and his face filled out a little. With the glasses Draco could certainly still tell that it was the Boy Who Lived disguised, but it was likely that people wouldn’t notice as they would expect Harry Potter to be either at Hogwarts or in Hogsmeade, not this far away from the safe haven of school.
“Where...where’s everyone...” Draco managed to get out.
“The last thing is that it looks like there were some blunt force injuries that haven’t healed properly. Did you visit any Healer after the Battle?” Draco shook his head and Madame Pomfrey tsked. “This should help.” She waved her wand and Draco’s body tingled. Pains he didn’t even realize were there vanished.
“Dunno,” Draco said, feeling a little sick again. He recounted his afternoon, filling in gaps where rumors couldn’t supply his friends with the knowledge they wanted. The hard parts were not any easier to talk about than they were in Auror Yarney’s office, and he had to steel himself against the bedpost multiple times, trying to draw strength to finish speaking. When he finished his story, all his friends were looking forlornly at the ground.
The rest of the day passed smoothly. The Weasley’s mostly ignored Draco, which was fine with him. They even had a fun Quidditch match in the crisp winter air with spare brooms. Draco struggled a bit—he wasn’t used to the older brooms, and he got smacked with a Bludger by George, who did not look too sorry. But overall it was very fun, and Draco was able to take his mind off his family woes.
“Ah, great. You’re trying to capture Death Eaters, yeah? Well you got me, good job. It was really difficult, me choosing Hogwarts as my secret hideout and all. It’s been so hard being on the run—”
“Not just any notebook.” Harry flipped the book over, revealing the Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes logo. “These are new from the shop. Meant to make it easier to pass notes in class, but it’ll work for this purpose too.” He set both notebooks on the desk and opened them to a blank page. “Go ahead and write something in yours.”
Draco scoffed—at least Harry had been with someone before. He had never before shared closeness in a way so terrifying. “The world is so upside down that I’m not sure there’s rhyme or reason to anything anymore.”
Draco was more and more relived of the decision he had made as he walked blindfolded into the gloomy prison. He already felt heavier, the thoughts of self-doubt in his mind growing. And that was with the Patronus close at hand—how could his mother stand this?
(See the end of the chapter for
Madame Pomfrey returned with both sets of potions for Harry and Draco. They bade her goodbye and set off.
Draco glared at him. “How can you say that? You don’t even know her!”
! Now Draco was regretting that he didn’t prepare a little better. But Narcissa wasted no time. “How are you my darling? You look thin.”
Applause broke out, but Daphne rolled her eyes. “Equally prestigious my—“
“Any more than we already are? Draco over here is practically in handcuffs!” Blaise gestured to Draco’s manacle, which Draco rubbed self-consciously.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Woah—you alright? Easy...” Draco protested as Harry grabbed his arm and lowered him back into the seat—but he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think, he thought he was going to pass out. He put his hand on his chest as he hyperventilated. He was terrified and humiliated that this was happening in front of Harry Potter, of all people. The last time Harry had seen him like this did not end well.
“Application number?” The wizard got up and started poking through the file cabinet behind him.
“That’s great, mum,” Draco said, using the informal name for Narcissa in a rarity. He had seen her look happy—she had smiled when he visited her in Azkaban, when she first saw that he was safe during the final battle. He had seen her laugh politely. It wasn’t as if she had spent the past year of her life in some sort of a cloud. But for the first time in a long time, Draco realized that his mother looked proud. And if she could be proud, so could he.
“That’s it though, wouldn’t it be nice to have some sort of semblance of order? Maybe we should strictly be friends right now, you know? Not sharing a bed, not being dependent...just
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright then,” Draco said. “So we meet here, tomorrow morning?”
“Bathroom,” he mumbled, though neither Hermione nor Neville were really listening. Draco made for the restroom but took the back exit, and walked around the building to find Potter sitting on a bench, shivering a little. The village was strangely quiet—not a soul in sight even on a gorgeous autumn day.
The rest of the time passed fairly smoothly. They played chess, which Draco quite enjoyed. It was quiet, but he had to focus hard enough so that he couldn’t think about anything else. Christine attempted to bring up some other things too, mostly about how he spent his time over the summer. She also asked broad questions about his social life at Hogwarts—if he had any friends, what he enjoyed doing, his favorite classes, etc. Grateful that she was letting them play a game instead of just talking, Draco tried to answer her questions as honestly as he could in return.
“A scuffle.” It was more of a statement than a question.
“Theodore Nott Sr., correct? The elder one?”
Harry looked at Draco, amused. “I happen to have a vast fortune myself, so no worries about breaking the bank.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The journey back to the Hospital Wing was horrendous, even though it was downstairs rather than up. After a while Draco had to resort to sliding down each step on his bottom since he was too weak to stand, and the height difference between him and Harry was too much for Harry to carry him. When there were only three flights left, Draco finally closed his eyes and leaned against the railing. He could still hear, but he couldn’t move or speak.
For a long while neither of them spoke. Then, Draco had to ask. “How did you find me?”
“You’re better at Potions than she is. Also as smart as Hermione is, she isn’t that great of a tutor. I can help you with your spells in exchange,” Harry suggested.
—he gasped as his left arm suddenly burned. It
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not at all,” Draco said. “I just...listen.” He stood up. “There’s something I want to say. To all of you.”
A conflict in the hallways leads to a clarification needing to be made...
“Enough.” Harry said quietly. Draco tried to unclench his hand from his glass. “I’m done with the fighting. Ron, you’re my best mate. You’ve had a really rough summer, and I understand that. But Draco is trying to be a better person. And you’re making that a little difficult right now.”
Draco was shocked and somewhat embarrassed that his father brought up Harry. “Potter and I are roommates, Father. That’s it and that’s all we’ll ever be. I don’t like it any more than you do.”
“Yes, threatening to kill the savior of the wizarding world is a great way to help their relationship,” Daphne chided.
“I’m not for you. I’m to make sure he doesn’t try anything.” The man nodded his head at Draco, whose heart fell.
It was a few days after Draco’s date with Harry, and the day before his parents’ trial. All the emotional progress that Draco made in the past few months seemed to have disappeared.  His hands were shaking as he buttoned up his coat, and he felt irritable and nauseous. He had also spent the past few nights with unrestful sleep. Though he was extraordinarily happy that Harry had expressed interest in going on another date, he missed the warm presence beside him at night dearly.
Draco felt like his heart stopped. Flashes of that day rushed through his mind—
Dolohov laughed. “You’d really let your friends die for this worthless piece of shite?” He pointed his wand at Draco.
Draco’s heart fell and he couldn’t help but let out a small sigh, just for himself. Nothing should surprise him anymore, but this still did. Of course Gregory wouldn’t want to talk to him. His actions led to the death of Vincent, who was Gregory’s best mate. Draco certainly spent the most time around the two of them, and they were his mates, but Draco was really only around them when he needed something. Vincent and Greg were inseparable. The friendship may not have been irreparable, but Draco didn’t write Greg at all this summer, save the letter that was supposed to be sent to Greg and others after Draco’s death in prison. But Draco never sent those letters, never even wrote new ones. He didn’t think about anyone but himself as he paced around his room for months. And now he was truly alone, able to spend more time with himself than he could ever want.
“Actually, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall had gotten up from her desk and now stood behind Draco. “Would you be so kind as to walk Mr. Malfoy back to your room? He’s just received some terrible news, and he is still recovering from the head injury he received earlier today.”
“I can’t believe this. I really can’t believe this.”
“I’m not that good anyway,” Greg said. “I bet they’ll knock me off my broom first chance they get. Why are we doing this again?”
“Hello!” They all jumped and turned to find Luna Lovegood staring at Draco. Blaise stepped in front of him protectively.
“Then I suppose it would behoove you to schedule an appointment,” she handed him a quill.
“Did you get in trouble?” Harry said very abruptly, as though the words forced themselves out of him at their own accord. “When you said you didn’t recognize me?”
Draco stood in the center of the living room for a moment, expecting to feel something more than the deep ache inside of him. Finally he walked outside and faced Harry.
Truthfully, seeing Mind Healer Christine was starting to get more and more difficult. Draco had delved into some of the less horrifying events of the past year—generally what it was like to have the Dark Lord in his house, what it was like at Hogwarts, etc. However, they were running out of easy material. Christine had pushed him more and more each session to be further in touch with his emotions and trauma, but Draco wasn’t sure he was ready. Draco explained this to Harry, who listened compassionately.
“That’s alright. It doesn’t matter where we are. Even if it’s at the Weasley’s.”
Draco nodded. “You can always let me know if that changes.”
Right on cue, a pair of third, maybe fourth years walked into the bathroom, chatting happily. They were old enough to know exactly who he was and they gasped as they saw Draco’s face in the mirror. One of them glared and took out his wand.
“I—I dream about him a lot, too. That’s actually why I’m up,” Draco decided to admit. He assumed Greg was thinking about Vincent given his intense focus on the fire.
“Where are all your—little fans Potter? Don’t you want to bask in your glory?” Draco’s tone started as confusion and ended as malice. That definitely took longer than it should have. Draco couldn’t think of a proper insult for a moment, and the one he came up with didn’t have nearly as much bite as his insults used to have.
“I’m not in the mood.” Harry sat down sullenly on his bed, putting his head in his hands. It was now dark outside and Draco cursed quietly.
“Ugh,” Draco said as he leaned back against the bathroom stall, curling into Harry’s side. He wiped his mouth and gave a sigh of relief as some of the tension left his body.
Draco sat up fully and Harry moved back. Draco ran his hands through his hair, sighing shakily. “I’m fine, Potter.”
Dolohov tilted his head toward Draco. “Give up the traitor without a fight. There are still scores to be settled.”
Draco returns home and has dinner with his parents. He decides whether to hide his life or keep no secrets.
This brought Draco’s shaking hand to a halt as he took a deep breath, internalizing Harry’s words.
“It’s just after dinner time. When I didn’t see you, that’s when I came looking.”
The more negative emotions had multiple doors. Frustration, fear, anger, pain—at the end of the day he would sort through events and compartmentalize those feelings. It allowed him to access any emotion when necessary. To insult Potter, he just needed to open the red anger door, just a pinch. In his darkest days at the Manor, he spent his time looking out the window and strolling through the rooms of his pleasant memories.
A shadow flashed across her face before she spoke. “Of course. Why wouldn’t I be alright, Dragon?”
“I’m fine. It’s Potter that you should be worried about.” The last sentence just sort of slipped out, and it even caught Draco by surprise that he was confiding in Granger.
The door opened and Potter walked back in, flicking his wand to light the lamp on Draco’s side. He was carrying a glass of water, which he held out to Draco. Draco glanced at it, not wanting to reveal to Potter how badly his hands were shaking. But he wanted to settle his stomach, so he took the water. “Thanks.” Harry nodded and sat on the end of Draco’s bed, looking out the window to give him some space. “Sorry I woke you up. You should probably cast a charm to block out the noise, I can’t do magic outside the classroom, otherwise I would.”
“We need to get Draco inside the Ministry tomorrow. Particularly the Wizengamot.”
“And empty my mind, I know.” Harry already sounded frustrated.
“No, I want to know how bad it is. Plus, I need to make sure no one is actually threatening me or my family.” This was definitely true, but not the full reason why Draco wanted to open each and every letter. He took some sick pleasure out of the pain that he felt with each horrible word. It felt good to punish himself, as if with each hate note he was one step closer to the finish line of finally being redeemed for his actions.
On the other side, Draco still had not been able to produce a Patronus. Harry didn’t seem worried, which almost made things worse. He was so kind and encouraging, and he was such a good teacher. Draco was worried that Harry felt like Draco’s failure was attributed to his teaching skills.
“Well, how do you feel when you two spend time together?”
So he decided to crack open his door and try to see if there was anyone inside the common room. From his angle, it looked empty. The Gryffindors’ Exploding Snap game had been abandoned, with pillows strewn over the floor as cushions. Draco tentatively moved toward the kitchen, but it seemed he was in the clear. He sighed and turned to make himself some tea.
(See the end of the chapter for
“A good question indeed,” Professor McGonagall said as she sat down at her desk. “What can I do for you, Mr. Malfoy?”
“I just did. Get out. Sorry, Mr. Potter, of course you are welcome here. But without him.”
“I think they mind about at least four of us continuing our education,” Blaise muttered under his breath. Draco was too busy trying to keep his breathing even to speak. It was a combination of anxiety and atrophy that led him to being winded with every flight of stairs they climbed.
“But you left me...”
“So what, you’re just supposed to sit back, lock yourself in your room and do nothing? You’re eighteen Draco, you deserve to live your life.”
Ron grinned. “I wouldn’t say Bill is doing too badly—he did end up with Fleur Delacour, and their first child is due in May.”
“Because a wizard mind and a Muggle mind are the same,” Neville argued. “There’s nothing different about how we think. We just have magic and they don’t.” Murmurs of displeasure scattered about the crowd. Draco heard Daphne scoff.
Potter would enter their bedroom during a mealtime and say: “Malfoy, you’re coming with me.”
“Dragon, could you excuse us for the last few moments? I’m sure you’ll be seeing your father again soon.” Draco cursed inwardly. He was hoping to ask Narcissa the same question. He desperately needed to find out what Lucius knew so that he could control the damage as much as possible. But Lucius wouldn’t make eye contact, and his mother’s gaze was pleading. He nodded to his father, not bothering to speak a goodbye, and left.
A few more minutes passed—Draco must have fallen asleep again. He woke up to Granger shoving something into his hands and Potter hoisting him into a sitting position. “You have to drink this, Malfoy. It’ll help you feel better.”
“Sorry. You must be tired. Just rest. I’ll be in the common room if you need anything.” Harry walked out the door, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts as both his body and mind tried to compensate for what he lost.
“What makes you think I’m going to Azkaban?”
“It’s stupid.”
. “I thought that you might be too busy to stop by and sign up, so I wanted to force the issue, if you will.” She reached behind her and picked up a piece of paper. “There are appointments available on Tuesdays at 3 and 4pm, Wednesdays at—“
Draco and Harry both stopped what they were doing to make eye contact. “Pardon?” Harry said, on the defensive.
As if by an unspoken agreement, Narcissa and Draco remained silent throughout the car journey. They were both sitting in the backseat while the escort was in front, but they only touched hands once in a while and gave each other reassuring looks. It was hard to get out of the mindset that anything they said would be used against them. And Draco knew that his parents weren’t necessarily out of the woods yet, and may never be.  The journey to St. Mungo’s was brief, and they were escorted inside quickly. Unfortunately there were a few members of the Prophet waiting to snap a few pictures, but Narcissa ignored reporters’ calls, as did Draco.
“They—I was going to be retried?”
Draco didn’t respond but heard movement behind him. All of a sudden something was covering him and he tried to throw it off.
. “I’m really sorry. I understand if you don’t want to—“
“I’m going to Hogsmeade with Potter on Saturday,” Draco said suddenly at dinner the next day. The Great Hall was mostly empty, since that’s when the eighth year Slytherins would have the lowest chance of getting insults hurled at them.
“Don’t even worry,” Draco said. “Thanks for sticking up for me.”
Harry looked into Draco’s eyes for a moment, as if to see if he really meant the apology. Then his face, red from stress, broke out into a smile. “I forgive you. Thank you for apologizing. I’m sure it must have been difficult to—“ Harry frowned and reached into his pocket.
on the day of his trial) but could not place him. All in all, his first outing was not going too poorly. Draco leaned against a pillar out of sight, to lurk and people-watch.
“Well, you did get turned into a ferret, so I don’t know which is worse.”
No it wasn’t. He was in a burning room clutching onto Potter for dear life, he couldn’t breathe, he could smell the smoke, he couldn’t believe Potter was trying to comfort him—
“No,” Harry looked amused. “I blew up my Aunt Marge and they kicked me out.”
“Of course,” Greg didn’t sound as upset as he had a few weeks ago, just contemplative. “I actually like it when you bring him up. I feel like a lot of people are scared to talk to me about him, but most of the time that’s all I want to talk about. Even if it hurts.” He cleared his throat. “Anyway, it’s hard to say when I first realized it. I just realized that I was my happiest when I was spending time with him, and he made my whole world brighter. I looked forward to seeing him more than anything else. When I was around him, I felt so...safe and taken care of, like I could take on the world with him by my side.”
Christine smiled. “I’m afraid the process isn’t that straightforward. I know that as wizards and witches we always want a quick remedy—some potion to take, a healing spell...but the mind isn’t like that. And neither is all medicine, for that matter. My parents are therapists—“
Draco scoffed. “All I did this summer was lay in bed and relax. I should be over that by now.” He slumped on his bed in frustration.
, Draco replied.
“He told me you nearly died. Is this true?”
. Taking out his wand, mostly for show, Draco stepped carefully inside the Potters’ home .
Harry shook his head and took a few moments to prevent tears from coming out. He let out a mirthless laugh. “The Ministry has never taken care of anything. They didn’t believe me for a year after I said Voldemort was back, remember?”
“You did,” Granger agreed. “But I can see that you’re trying now. When’s the last time you said ‘Mudblood’ anyway?” Draco didn’t respond, but he was sure it had been nearly a year. “Exactly. I don’t have the energy to hate you anymore, Malfoy. No offense meant, but it’s not really worth it.”
Potter started to divide the players up into teams based on who had any experience playing a certain position. He and Draco were the only Seekers, so they were on opposite teams. Granger, Longbottom, Thomas, and a handful of others were sitting out, as they weren’t comfortable on a broom. Draco ended up on a team with Greg with Blaise and Daphne on Potter’s team. Greg was one Beater for Draco’s team, but Seamus was the other. Biting his lip, Draco worried that Seamus wouldn’t be too concerned about beating a Bludger away from him.

“I wish I could internalize that philosophy,” Draco said sadly.
Draco internally scolded himself for being stupid.
“That won’t be easy, they’ve implemented a lot of new security measures since we last did it.” Hermione absent-mindedly shuffled through papers as she said this. Draco was bewildered.
He was never sure if during these attacks he actually fell unconscious or just became unaware of what was happening. But the next thing Draco knew, he was shivering and his head was aching. Nausea overcame him, and he heaved into the toilet, miserably wiping his face, which was already wet with tears.
Draco wiped his nose with his sleeve and hid his eyes. He almost didn’t even care enough to be embarrassed that he was once again crying in front of Potter—why should he care what anyone thinks of him? For the rest of his life, people would look at him and see a criminal. “I just—I would rather have gone to Azkaban instead of my mother. She already suffered so much, I don’t think she could handle it. I just want her to be okay, I wish they had taken me instead—“ he stopped short and looked at Potter with hope in his eyes. “I could turn myself in, I bet it’s not too late—“ he made to stand, but Potter stopped him.
“Well, I can’t make your decision for you. All I can ask you to do is be kind to yourself. You’ve been so good about trying to be kinder to others—I think that you could do with that change as well.”
“Whatever you’re trying to do with Potter, Malfoy, it needs to stop,” Thomas began.
Draco stormed out of the Three Broomsticks—but Potter didn’t follow. Draco paced for a minute in front of the building, then stalked away. Hogs Head it was.
—and patted Draco’s shoulder with it.
“There’s a nice restaurant a few blocks from here,” Draco said. He used to go to the Italian place every year with his parents while they did his school shopping. In sixth year, he went with just his mother. He would give anything to be able to take her out to dinner again. His stomach churned at the thought of his parents and the fate they would be facing in the next few days, but he pushed the thoughts out of his mind and tried to focus on Harry’s presence next to him.
