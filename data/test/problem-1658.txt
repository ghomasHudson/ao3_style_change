“I shouldn’t have brought up your past. If I’ve learned one thing through all this, it’s that you aren’t the same person that you were when we were at Hogwarts. You were a good friend to me, and you did the right thing...eventually.”
Percy glanced sideways at Harry and nodded his head, then returned to the article. Harry took this as a sign to go on. He thought back to the list of accomplishments that Draco had given him and picked the ones that he thought would impress Percy the most.
From his new vantage point, Harry watched as panic rippled through the stands.  The overwhelming feeling of despair that suddenly filled his chest alerted him to the arrival of what was causing this mayhem: dementors. And not just one or two, which occasionally cropped up and were usually swiftly handled by the auror department. This was an entire hoard of dementors, more than Harry had seen in one place in a long time. A stag burst from his wand as he rushed towards the pitch.  The crowd raced and pushed their way towards an exit focused on saving themselves, but Harry only had eyes for the Quidditch teams who were wandless and under attack.
“I won’t be taking no for an answer, Potter. I’m prepared to sit here all day until you accept.” She crossed her arms defiantly.
“Oh come on, Malfoy let him come. You don’t have to play, Harry,” Ginny turned to him. “But I think watching some Quidditch and being outside would be good for you. Get your mind off Hottie for a little while.”
“Anyway,” Hermione eyed Ron, daring him to interrupt her again, “Ron and I have come a long way from our first year.  And we appreciate you all being here for us for the last decade.  We cannot wait to share our special day with you tomorrow.”
“It’s nearly nine, there’s not going to be much open,” Draco pointed out. But Oliver was not deterred.
“I’m a what?” Harry asked, his brain taking a moment to register what Neville had said. “Right, yeah. Me. Werewolf. Awoooooo.”
The potential for a shift in attitude regarding Draco is also established in Hagrid’s hut after the article about Hagrid being half-giant is published.  Hagrid is obviously very upset about it. Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, and Harry all try to comfort him by giving him examples of people who do like him and are happy that he is at Hogwarts. Hagrid points out that it’s okay for other people to not be universally liked, because at least they’re not half-giant. Harry immediately speaks up and reminds Hagrid that he has shitty relatives too. Dumbledore provides further evidence of shitty relatives by telling them about Aberforth and his preoccupation with goats. The point that both Harry and Dumbledore were trying to make, is that it’s possible for a person to have problematic family members without being problematic themselves. This logic, I think, could be important in Harry eventually being able to accept Draco. If he is willing to accept that he (Harry) is a decent person despite being raised by the Dursleys, he should be able to forgive Draco for having Lucius as a father (this is of course, assuming that Draco has made some life changes and is committed to becoming a better person, which I think he’s on the path to doing by the end of the series).
“Golden Snitch.” Harry muttered.  Instantly what had appeared to be merely a stone wall melted away into a somewhat ornate wooden door.  Harry reached for the door handle and walked into his new ‘home.’  The room consisted of a sitting area, a desk, and a large four poster bed.  There was a small door to his right that he assumed was for the en suite. The floors were a dark polished wood with a deep red plush carpet with matching arm chairs in the sitting area.  There was a small fireplace and overall the room was warm and everything you’d expect a former Gryffindor student turned professor to want for themselves.  Too bad it only made Harry feel more empty and alone. Memories of hanging out with Ginny in the Gryffindor Common Room swirled to the surface. Fighting Voldemort hadn’t been easy by any stretch of the imagination, but somehow that time had been easier than this.  He’d fight off a hundred dark lords if it would bring back Ginny. Or remove the issue that landed him at Hogwarts instead of the Aurors Office in the first place.
Draco and Harry don’t really interact again until their Quidditch match nearly one hundred pages later. I’d like to offer the possibility that Draco only joined the house team as a seeker to be able to guarantee time spent with Harry. During the match, Draco consistently offers snide remarks, and doesn’t seem particularly interested in actually playing quidditch.
“I sometimes can’t believe just how far we have come. To say we spent our entire childhood bickering, would be an understatement. But, I wouldn’t have wanted to bicker with anyone other than you.  Ron, you’re my fiercest supporter and you’re the only person I want by my side forever. I love you and I can’t wait for this next grand adventure.”  Hermione grabbed Ron’s hands as she finished. He tightened his around hers before clearing his throat.
"I think I found something," Harry called. Draco rolled his eyes and kept walking to a spot that he believed would have the mallowsweet. Then a scream pierced through the air.
“Then I’ll be back shortly, I’ll grab those scrolls and the antique quills I was telling you about.” Draco heard Cormac say.  Draco entered the parlor to be faced with the owner of the familiar voice.
"I've got what I need," Draco tapped the pouch. "Can we please get out of here before something else tries to eat us?"
“First, you’re going to tell Weasley all about Wood’s accomplishments and how important he is in the MInistry.” Draco explained. “Do it casually. It also probably wouldn’t hurt if you mentioned that he can get free tickets to just about any Quidditch match.”
“Was that not exactly what you would’ve ordered?  I was really saving our poor waitress the dismay of having to deal with your abysmal table manners,” Draco shrugged. “But back to your wedding...if I didn’t know you better, Potter, I’d think you were more interested in the grandeur of having a wedding rather than the actual point of it: the lasting and loving commitment of marriage.” Harry paused to let this sink in.
It’s not fair to Draco’s Book One characterization to suggest that Malfoy not seeing the snitch was because he’s a bad Quidditch player. It’s already established that he has some decent broom skills. I really think that Malfoy is not in it for the snitch, he’s in it to see Harry.
Harry caught himself walking up to the owlery to send Draco a note about the Potions job, but then he remembered that Malfoy was probably still mad at him for telling Oliver and wouldn’t be interested in anything he had to say. Instead, he wandered back to Hogsmeade and stopped in Honeydukes to buy himself some sweets. He also picked up some sugar quills for Hermione, chocolate frogs for Ron, and acid pops for Ginny as a thank you for getting him to leave the couch.
“You know that all I do is bestow greater knowledge on you,” Draco started, “My thought is that we have two bosses who are entirely too obsessed with work, right?”
“Uh, Harry,” Neville looked at Harry and then Draco. “Do you want to switch seats with me so you can continue having this conversation without me being stuck in the middle?”
Step One: read between the lines. Harry Potter is canonically a single-minded, himbo-in-training who does not understand his own feelings, so his thoughts and actions cannot be taken at face value. Consequently, we only see Draco through Harry’s bespectacled, unobservant eyes, which means the motivation behind any of Draco’s actions is up for interpretation.
We finally see Draco when he and Lucius Malfoy stroll into Borgin and Burkes (a thing that Harry is mortified of, because
Harry returned to Grimmauld Place with very little fanfare.  He had missed Ginny’s services while he was in St Mungo’s. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley had all stopped by briefly to check on him.  He turned them away so he could deal with his grief, guilt, and lycanthropy alone. It wouldn’t help them to know the role he played, or that he blamed himself for not being unable to save Ginny.
“What about Oliver?” Harry could feel the anger bubbling up inside of him. “Do you want me to stop looking at houses for the two of you?”
“I have two questions for you.” Ginny squinted her eyes suspiciously. “Why were you fighting with Harry? And why were you both looking at the same house for your bosses?”
“Well,” Draco threw back his drink. “If it’s not too late when I leave here, I’ll go over to Cormac’s for the night and we can finally have breakfast together. We’ve been talking about it for ages, but I’m always working too early in the morning.”
As if the first month of teaching wasn't difficult enough, Harry also found himself getting more and more agitated the closer it got to the full moon.
“I can’t tell you much, since you’re part of the investigation,” Robards answered. “But several wizards associated with former Death Eaters were apprehended at the crime scene. We have reasonable evidence to suggest that whoever fired the spell responsible for what happened to Ms. Weasley, also attacked you.”
“Ron! Ron!” Harry heard Hermione’s frantic whispers, and sensed movement in the corner as Hermione shook Ron’s shoulder. “He’s awake.”
“Yes, of course Miss Headmistress, Tilly will be taking care of that for the Great Harry Potter.” The little elf stared wide-eyed at Harry until McGonagall cleared her throat, prompting Tilly back into action.  She grabbed his trunk and bag and left McGonagall’s office with a loud pop. Harry shifted awkwardly, his leg hurt from carrying the trunk and he wasn’t really interested in small talk.
“I believe I owe you an apology,” Wood said, shuffling his feet uncomfortably. “I should have listened to you when you warned me about Percy in my office. I also didn’t expect Percy to fire you after I mentioned our conversation to him. Were you able to find employment elsewhere, would you like me to give you a recommendation to make up for everything?”
Harry finished sending off the memo to Draco right as Percy came back out of his office in a huff.  After having left three reports on Harry’s desk for him to finish, Percy had stormed off and shut his office door with just a bit more force than would be considered polite but short of slamming it.
“You’ll nothing, Potter. Now, I recommend you back up off me before I decide to incinerate your insides with some very intricate dark magic. As you like to point out so frequently, I’ve certainly been raised with the knowledge.” Draco was able to use Harry’s shock to his advantage and pushed his way past and out the door before Harry could respond in any way.
“You do know that I am right here. I can hear everything you’re saying about me.” Draco interrupted.
In Half Blood Prince he’s given the absurd task of killing Dumbledore.  He doesn’t do it. He’s a smart kid, and yet he uses indirect methods that are easily thwarted because he doesn’t want to be a killer. He’s only putting up a half-hearted attempt because he’s not brave enough to stand up to his family.
I’m not here to say that Crabbe and Goyle are gay. I know plenty of people who have gone to school dances with their friends and not a date, myself included. But Harry clearly has not even considered that maybe they could be. There is room for gay representation in this scene even if
Suddenly out of the forest, there was a bright light. Harry opened his eyes, expecting to see his familiar stag but instead a phoenix burst forward and the devil's snare retreated.
He also makes a comment about how ‘they make them okay at Hogwarts’ when he’s looking over at the Ravenclaw table after the Beauxbatons students arrive. She’s also the first person that Harry asks to the Yule Ball. She, of course, says no because she’s going with Cedric. This leads Harry to make this startling realization:
A wave of emotions raced through Draco as he transfigured the wooden bench into a more comfortable chair. He was frustrated that even so many years removed from Hogwarts, Harry Potter was still overshadowing him. And he was mad that winning seemed to be more important to Cormac than he was. But as he watched Potter circle around the Quidditch pitch looking for the snitch, he could tell that it was helping Potter’s mood. Although he was loath to admit it, Potter was a better Seeker than he was, and was certainly a better seeker than his opposition so at least this game would end quickly.
“Yes, yes, I do understand now how that would be unpleasant for him and all members of this house,” Draco replied, not coming up from underneath the blanket. He could hear the sound of another pair of footsteps entering his room.
“Goddamnit, Ginny” Harry muttered at the insufficient funds error on the ATM screen before looking up at Draco.
“I will show you to your rooms in a moment.  But before I do, I want you to know that this castle used to be your home and it can be again, if you only let it.”  Harry averted his eyes, lest it become clear McGonagall had reminded him quite a bit of Dumbledore with that statement. “Now, your rooms are near the Gryffindor Tower, follow me.”
had been unsuccessful.  So unsuccessful, in fact, that they had decided it was time to bring in the cavalry.   The floo firing to life barely caught Harry’s attention enough for him to loll his head to the side. Ginny walked into the living room and wasted no time in flicking Harry in the forehead.
“It’s lucky we were here though,” Ginny continued, putting the clothes down on a chair and walking over to the kitchen table where an unopened letter was laying. “This came for you a few minutes ago.”
“Now, Potter,” Draco began, very close to Harry’s ear so that he could hear him over the music, “you must be careful to Not. Touch. Anything. This place is good for picking someone up, but it isn’t exactly known for it’s sanitation.”
“I thought I heard your voice, Harry! Where were you last night?” Ron came around the corner and sat down on the floor leaning against Hermione’s legs.
"What is wrong with you two?" Neville said as his patronus circled back to rest on his shoulder. "You've probably woken the entire forest up with your screaming!"
“Uh...yes.” Harry and Draco answered in unison. Draco snuck a glance over in Harry’s direction and Harry shrugged.
“There’s always unofficially an opening for the Potions position. Professor Slughorn has been saying every year that he would love to retire, and he has yet to do so. But, I really can’t in good conscience recommend that job for you.”
“Right, thanks.” Harry sighed. “I, uh, have a lot to think about. If you don’t mind, I think I’d like to be alone right now.” Hermione went to protest, but Ron patted her shoulder and the two of them gathered their belongings and left.
“More qualified for what?” Harry asked, still not understanding where McGonagall was going.  McGonagall pursed her lips.
A few hours later, Harry walked through the door of Grimmauld Place, hung up his cloak, and toed off his shoes.  This truly had felt like the longest day, even with the interjection of Malfoy. It was somewhat weird, but also...welcome. It broke up the monotony of his usual work day.
“It could be more, couldn’t it?” Harry slammed his palm on the table and some of the parchment that Roger had so neatly stacked flew into the air. Harry reflexively reached out and caught one. As he set it down, he saw a familiar name scrawled on the top. “What’s this?”
“It looks like both of us got stood up for our work meetings,” Oliver said, finally checking the time. “I was supposed to continue my meeting over dinner at La Sirene. The reservation is pretty soon and I know it’s really hard to get in there, I’d hate to waste it. Would you want to join me?”
“I’m sorry we don’t have a gift for you,” Molly said to Draco, as she handed Harry what was clearly a Weasley sweater. “Harry, dear, didn’t tell us who he was bringing.”
On the surface this is just Harry Potter dealing with some jealousy and disappointment that Cho Chang doesn’t like him back. But we’re in this for Drarry, and so we must reinterpret lines (without ruining their integrity, of course). So, I shall propose this interpretation: maybe Harry is upset about Cho Chang. But maybe he is also upset about it specifically being Cedric Diggory dancing with her. And perhaps, him wanting to kick something has more to do with the fact that part of him knows he’s attracted to Cedric and that frustrates him.
“It would be if the work week was over. But I’m supposed to be meeting with someone, and it appears as though they aren’t able to tell time,” Percy responded.
“Thank Merlin,” the bartender muttered under his breath as he caught sight of his savior for the Savior walking up to the bar stools.
“Harry!” she exclaimed. “You’re not just getting home from work now, are you? We were worried but it wouldn’t have been the first time you slept in the office. Send an owl next time, or something, honestly.”
I, uh, didn’t read the epilogue during this reread because I don’t like it. So, I give you permission to ignore this section as well.  Looking at the series as a whole, I think there’s room for fanfiction to pick up where the books left off and finish Draco’s redemption arc, which could involve Harry becoming friends (or lovers) with Draco.  The enemies plot and the groundwork for friendship are there, so now it’s up to the shipper to seal the deal.
“It took you long enough to come to that conclusion,” McGonagall smiled sagely. “I always had a feeling that you’d end up wanting to pursue a different career.  I really believe that you would have been a great auror, Harry. You want to save the world, but there are other ways to do that.”
Harry wasn’t paying very close attention to what the officiant was saying, instead he was looking at the smile on Hermione’s face, and the tears streaming down the guests’ cheeks.  He was brought back to the ceremony when he heard Ron and Hermione begin their vows.
“While I can’t imagine anyone willingly subjecting themselves to my brother, nor him finding someone so exponentially out of his league-” Ginny faltered as Ron made a valiant effort to kick her under the table, “I am very happy for the two of you.  It’s also nice that Ron removed his head from his arse and finally realized he should lock Hermione in before she wised up and ran off with Viktor Krum.” Ginny deftly stepped to the other side of her chair before Ron could make a second attempt at kicking her. “Cheers to the happy couple!” Everyone took a healthy swig from their glass and conversation resumed around the table.
shitty.” Draco replied. “But it seems like Quidditch helped, and you know I wouldn’t have let Pansy run that article even if she wanted to.”
Draco handed Madame Pomfrey the goblet and turned to leave, but noticed that she had promptly handed the goblet to Harry who was looking at it suspiciously. He stopped in his tracks.
Over the next few days, Harry and Draco didn’t see much of each other at the Ministry of Magic. It turned out that it was harder than they anticipated to have a casual conversation with their bosses. Draco had the distinct impression that Wood was not listening to a single word he said if it didn’t have to do with Quidditch.
Harry was still distracted by Draco in the back of the row that he all but missed the officiant saying Ron could kiss the bride.  He whipped his head around in time to watch his two best friends share an intimate kiss before joyful music began to play and sparks shot off behind the altar.
“Well, it looks to me like I just bought my boss some dinner. What exactly did I order?” Draco said looking into the styrofoam container at the top of the pile. “Pancakes?”
“So, so small,” Harry kept repeating to himself while pinching his fingers to indicate to Neville just how small he felt the children were.  Neville ushered Harry out of the bar and guided him back towards Hogwarts.
“Look,” Draco continued. “I don’t know what Percy explained. But if anybody knows about Cormac it’s me. We were involved for a while, until I showed up at his house a month ago and Percy was there. They were discussing how a relationship between the two of them would be advantageous. And so Cormac left me because dating a Weasley was better for the McLaggen brand.  Percy is just waiting for the right moment to take their relationship public, he wants to make sure that it’s risk free so he’s using you as a backup.”
Curiously, Harry chooses to finally make his move on Ginny in their common room after she successfully won a Quidditch match as a seeker. And now, back to your regularly scheduled programming.
Finally, the wedding weekend had arrived.  The night before, Hermione requested that all of the Weasleys and Harry be present at the Burrow so that they could run through the schedule for the wedding.  Everything had to be perfect, and she wanted to make sure that everyone knew exactly what they were responsible for.
As McGonagall spoke, Draco continued to sip his wine. He was acutely aware of Harry’s presence a few seats away from him. He tried to focus on McGonagall’s speech but the entire situation was making him feel very antsy.
The next morning Harry rolled out of bed just in time to nick some toast from the Great Hall before his first class of the day.  Despite being rushed and a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of children in the halls, Harry made it to his classroom before the majority of his students and even managed to tuck in his shirt and look somewhat presentable.  Hermione’s voice telling him to make a good impression floated through his head unbidden and he found himself straightening his robes as the last student took his seat.
“Is everything okay out here, dumbass?” Pansy whispered harshly, sticking her head out the door and glaring in Draco’s direction.
“I’ll be quick, I promise.” Draco was beginning to wish that he had written something down. He preferred to be much more prepared than this, but there wasn’t enough time. “Oliver you’ve got to end this thing with Percy. You shouldn’t bring him to the Quidditch match, and more importantly you shouldn’t buy this house with him.”
The Third Seeker will have her turn in Half Blood Prince, spoilers, it’s Ginny. We will also give honorable mentions to Viktor Krum, as a Seeker he clearly appreciates and respects although Ron seems to be the one who has the bigger crush on Krum.
“Perfectly. Fuck off, McLaggen.” Draco said, holding his head high as he left Cormac’s flat with at least a shred of dignity left.
Harry doesn’t know that this is Malfoy yet, but he figures it out when he sees Draco’s dot in a bathroom with Moaning Myrtle later. He interrupts and they fight. Harry immediately regrets the spell that he used, even though it was in self-defense, and he falls to his knees besides Malfoy trying to save him.  The scenes after this duel are primarily about the horcrux and his trip with Dumbledore, but his main concern before he left was Draco. So yeah, sure, Harry, you
I’m not going to sit here and suggest that Draco Malfoy is innocent and didn’t say and do terrible things in the name of purebloods. He did, and I won’t deny it. But one of the cool things about human nature is that we can change and grow as we become exposed to additional world views. Draco probably never even saw a muggleborn until he went to Hogwarts, and so he would have believed every nasty thing his parents had ever said about them because he didn’t have any reason not to. Then he gets to Hogwarts and he realizes that muggleborns are smart. And half-bloods are good at Quidditch. And maybe purebloods aren’t inherently better just because of their blood status. By the end of the books, Draco Malfoy has started to show some remorse. I will analyze the specific events later in the essay. But I will offer this brief example to get your empathy juices flowing:
"I thought that I saw mallowsweet, but it was devil’s snare. And then Malfoy here wouldn't help me."
All quotations in this chapter (unless otherwise noted) come from my copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (US paperback edition, 2001)
“Thanks, doll,” Draco said, sauntering past Harry, who was glaring at him, and out the door. Harry, of course, followed Draco. He grabbed Draco’s shoulder and spun him around.
to be Christmas.” Harry responded sternly. “Ron cornered me when I got home last night.  HIs mum is insisting that I come for Christmas dinner and the engagement party they specifically planned for that night. They figured if both events were at the same time, that it would be easier for me to attend.  I’ve missed pretty much every Weasley family gathering since I started working for Percy, so I need to be there.”
“Good for you! I’m glad you’re finally getting laid.” Ron clapped and Hermione hit him with a pillow.
“I’m not normally good with words. If everyone didn’t already know, Hermione was the one who wrote a lot of my essays. But I worked really hard on this and the words are completely my own. Hermione, I love you with all of my heart.  I had no idea that when I saved the annoying, bushy-haired, bookworm from a mountain troll on Halloween that she was going to end up being the love of my life. You put up with me for years, and I’m glad that you saw something in the ginger kid with dirt on his nose.  It just goes to show that first impressions aren’t everything.”
“So it’s settled then,” Harry said, clapping his hands together. “It’s Oliver’s turn to have the “idea”. Which I think will work well, Oliver will have better luck persuading Percy to go away for the holiday than I would.”
One of my favorite theories about Harry Potter is that he absolutely has a type and that is Quidditch Seeker. You’ll remember that I’ve already theorized that Draco only joined the Slytherin Quidditch team as Seeker because it was a way to get to spend more time with Harry (and an excuse to talk to him). Draco will inevitably become the fourth seeker that Harry will be attracted to.
The pair was smart enough to nod solemnly. Draco set down his empty goblet and braced his hand on the back of his chair to stand up, trying to look less intoxicated than he felt.
Draco nodded and headed out, while Harry turned around and pushed the lift button several times, even though he knew that would not make it arrive any faster. When he finally made it back to his desk an eternity (but actually, only a few minutes) later, he noticed that Percy was in his office on the phone.
If you want to consider the epilogue as canon, though I definitely don’t blame you if you want to ignore it, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy don’t fight when they interact. Instead, they nod at each other in understanding, and Harry encourages his youngest son to not be afraid of being sorted into Slytherin house. He references Snape in that moment, but it could have also been seeing Draco. It would be believable, after this exchange, that Harry no longer hates Draco and that Draco feels similarly.
Harry is furious. He tried, for the second time in his life, to use an Unforgivable Curse, something he (has so far) only attempted when trying to avenge the death of a loved one.  But in his anger, he focuses on Snape. He doesn’t blame Draco for any of it. By being forced to watch the events on the tower frozen, Harry was able to see the entire sequence without interfering. His lack of interruption was key to allowing him to find out that Draco Malfoy wasn’t who he thought he was. This paragraph shows that Harry has it in his heart to forgive Draco, eventually. The only thing he dislikes about Draco now is the Dark Arts bit.
“Well, anyway,” Harry said, backing out of the room. “As lovely as this chat was, I better get back to the report I needed to write for Percy, otherwise I’ll never get to leave this hell hole.” And with that, Harry strode down the hallway towards the lift leaving Draco with his thoughts about how this was the second night in a row that he had a relatively civil conversation with Harry Potter that didn’t end with a hex.
“Oh good,” Percy said bluntly, when he noticed Harry was back. “I took the liberty of starting to clean out your desk for you since you won’t be needing it anymore. You’re no longer my assistant. I’m firing you.”
Earlier in the book, when Harry is complaining to Hermione about how Snape is so in love with the Dark Arts, she points out that he sounded a bit like Harry.  Harry knows that he doesn’t like the Dark Arts, so now he has to conclude that point of view matters. Hermione's wisdom, coupled with Draco eventually renouncing the Dark Arts (which is something that could happen down the road, given that Draco has already started questioning it), should probably be enough to allow Harry to forgive Draco. And if there’s no love for the Dark Arts to despise, the next logical step would be for Harry and Draco to move into the Friends phase.
“Sod off, Malfoy.” Harry punctuated the statement by tossing the vial back immediately.  Wolfsbane potion wasn’t exactly known for being pleasant. As he waited for the slightly swampy aftertaste to hit, he was surprised to be left with nothing but a faint sense of vanilla on his tongue. He couldn’t hide his shock and Draco couldn’t keep from looking smug.
Prisoner of Azkaban, though my favorite book, suffers from being the most re-read. It also doesn’t help that by book three of reading and taking copious notes, I’ve become a little bit bored. Especially because it’s more of the same vibe as the first two books. Draco and Harry are still firmly in the Enemies/Rivals phase, Harry has absolutely no idea that he’s bisexual, and Draco is still too afraid of his crush on Harry to make any real, life changes.
“Very subtle, Potter.” Draco said, but he walked over to him anyway. After a few minutes Draco waved Harry over. “I think you might remember, Roger Davies, from Hogwarts.”
Harry woke up the next morning with a smile on his face, he slept all night without any nightmares, and he was also achingly hard. He remembered the dream he was having before he woke up and he was just glad he didn't wake up a sticky mess. Draco had starred in a few of the dreams and just thinking about it made Harry groan, his cock leaking onto his boxers. He let his hand slide down his chest and under the waistband. His fingers wrapped lazily around his erection and he moaned. He started stroking himself slowly thinking about Draco's full lips, slender hips, and perfect arse. He imagined what it would be like if it was Draco's hand touching him instead of his own, and with that thought he cried out spilling over his hand as he rode out his orgasm. Harry laid there catching his breath while his heartbeat returned to normal, thinking about how far gone he was and wondering if there was any point in fighting it. "Fuck," he muttered, and rolled out of bed to take a shower.
Just as Teddy was waking up from his nap Andromeda called them into the dining room for dinner. Harry put a sleepy Teddy in his highchair. Harry had to laugh a little as the high chair was placed at the head of the table (which must go against at least one pureblood rule) with Harry and Andromeda on one side and Draco and Narcissa on the other.
"Well before this summer I was a bit busy, and after we started talking I was afraid of ruining our new friendship if you didn't feel the same. You really liked me back in Fourth year?" Harry asked shyly.
Everything was green, from the thick carpet to the silk duvet and hangings around the dark mahogany four-poster in the middle of the room. There were a few posters of wizard bands and a canvas with the crest of Slytherin painted on it. There was a desk a wardrobe and nightstand all in the same dark mahogany as the bed.
"Here for letting me help and getting me out of the Manor." Draco said handing Harry the bottle of wine.
Harry smiled back and said, "Hang on." Then offering his arm, he apparated them to the street in front of his house.
Harry was restless all day, like there was an itch under his skin he couldn't scratch. He wanted to see Draco again, but he didn't want to seem desperate, hell he didn't even know if Draco was gay. He just figured out he was so how was he supposed to know if someone else was, let alone if they liked him like that.
This started somewhat of a routine, they began writing each other three or four times a day. They decided that it was best to get the 'hard stuff' over with first, so they talked about the war and Draco's father and their regrets and how things could have been different. Harry learned that after their trial Narcissa had reconciled with Andromeda and they decided she would do her house arrest at her sister's. Harry told Draco that Ron and Hermione had gotten married and that they would be coming home just before school started.
"Harry, I don't ever want you to feel like you can't ask me something. I will always be honest with you. I don't want us to have any secrets. I didn't even know his name, it only happened once and I was drunk so I don't remember much." Draco said .
Draco walked over to the coffee table and started setting out the magazines and notes from the day before.
Before he could start panicking, Draco pulled him to his feet and kissed him again. It was just a chaste press of lips, then he pulled away smiling and went back to painting. Harry couldn't help the goofy grin that spread across his face as they finished up.
Harry shifted the sleeping baby in his arms and took Draco's hand. The moment was not lost on either of them as proverbial hands turned into real ones and there was amusement in their eyes as they shook hands for the first time.
He remembered having a dream about Bill Weasley sometime during fourth year and too many to count about Draco during sixth year. He always explained them away as stress or something out of his control, he never really had a chance to look into them in much detail as he was usually preoccupied with not dying and defeating Voldemort. Now he had all the time in the world to think and what he found didn't come as much of a shock as he thought it should.
"Just relax, I won't hurt you and if you ever need to stop just tell me and I will," Draco looked down at him with a serious expression.
"Really, you wouldn't mind? I mean, it would be more convenient, with how much work we have to do. I also really hate being in that huge Manor alone, it's incredibly dull, and I don't really like being there anyway, you know not with everything that happened..." He trailed off, then looked up expectantly at Harry.
Harry reached down and gave a few experimental strokes to Draco's cock, which was a little longer than his but not as thick, making Draco moan and close his eyes. When he opened them they had that hungry look in them again, and Harry reveled in the fact that he made Draco look like that. Draco picked up his wand and muttered a lubrication charm on his hand, then he leaned forward and kissed Harry again while his hand moved down and began messaging his entrance with a finger. He pushed the first finger passed the ring of muscle. Harry had never felt anything like it, before he knew it he was thrusting down to meet Draco's finger, "More, Draco, more."
Harry heard a quiet knock at the door and his heart took off again. 'Get it together' he told himself. He heard a muttered conversation out by the door, then Narcissa and Draco walked into the room.
"Yes Master Draco," Mim bowed and popped away. She popped back a moment later with four more elves behind her. Draco told them to unpack the painting supplies and bring them to the entrance hall (he wanted them to work their way up) and when they were done with that they could start cleaning every inch of the house.
Draco held his mother's chair our for her and walked aound his own chair and sat down. Harry hadn't noticed before, after being caught up in conversation, but Draco also had on muggle clothes. He was wearing a pair of muggle jeans that screamed designer, and a light grey buttondown shirt that he had untucked with the sleeves rolled up. Harry was glad Draco didn't try to hide the Mark, it was one of the 'hard' topics that came up when they first started writing. The fact that Draco was comfortable enough to show it made Harry, for some reason, inexplicably happy.
When dinner was over they laid down cuddled up to each other watching some bad sitcom Draco had come to like. Harry couldn't pay attention as Draco kept carding his fingers through Harry's hair. He couldn't remember anyone touching him like this, sure he would get the occasional hug from Molly or Hermione, but not this type of intimate affection he never knew he'd been missing.
Harry didn't have time to move before a brush full of paint was flying towards his face, he turned just in time for it to skim his ear and little bit of hair.
Harry had moved into Grimmauld Place the day after the Final Battle, he couldn't stand to be around everyone at the Burrow. The grief over losing Fred was like a physical presence, and they were all trying to act normal and happy whenever Harry was around which made him feel guilty. So he packed up his trunk, grabbed his rucksack, and empty owl cage then moved into his Godfather's house for good. Kreature had been splitting his time between there and Hogwarts so the cleanup was slow, but Harry didn't mind, he was just glad he didn't have to pretend here.
Harry heard Teddy crying in the other room and lept at the excuse to leave Narcissa in the entryway. He walked into the living room, gave Andromeda a quick hug, then took Teddy so she could go finish up dinner. Harry walked a fussy Teddy around the living room a couple times before he fell asleep with his face buried in Harry's neck, his hair rotating in a rainbow of colors as he dreamed.
Harry felt his stomach flip and a goofy grin spread across his face. He sent a short reply letting Draco know he would be more than greatful for any help he could get, and sent it off.
Draco took his cock all the way down to the hilt and Harry had to grit his teeth to try not to lose the last if his restraint.
"Just one during the summer before our Sixth year. He was a muggle boy from the village near the Manor and it was right before I got the Mark and I just wanted to forget. He ended up being killed shortly after when the Death Eaters raided the village." Draco said with a haunted expression.
After cleaning off all the paint, they ate dinner picnic style in the drawing room. Harry laid a blanket on the floor and put pillows in front of the couch so they could lean on them. Harry knew everything had changed, but it didn't feel any different. It was still easy they talked and laughed while they ate, there were no akward silences, just a content quiet of being in each other's company.
Draco stepped gracefully out of the fireplace. He was holding a quill and parchment in one hand and some magazines in the other.
touch it! It's like Christmas and my birthday put together except better!" Draco said with an exuberant smile.
In the days following the trial Harry couldn't get the image of shock and raw emotion that flitted across Draco's face when he was freed, out of his head. The owl squaked and brought him back to the present with a jump. He reached forward with a trembling hand and took the letter. He opened the envelope and started reading:
Harry ladled two bowls with stew, grabbed a fresh loaf of bread, and butter then placed it all on the open end of the table. He grabbed a bottle of wine that Ron and Hermione had gotten him as a house warming gift, and two glasses.
Ginny jumped off the couch and ran over to give him a hug. He smiled a little as he hugged her back. They had decided at the beginning of the summer that they were happier as friends. She had gotten close to Neville during the previous year and they started dating shortly after the Battle. Harry was happy for them, they deserved to be happy.
For the next three days the house elves cleaned, Harry and Draco worked their way through each room of the house painting and arranging furniture (some of which had been owl ordered from one of the magazines Draco brought), they ate every meal together and watched television every night before going to bed.
"Okay so it's not completely livable yet it's only been me and my one very old, house elf fixing it up and as I don't really enjoy remodeling it's taking longer than I hoped." Harry said defensively.
When Draco let go, Harry's hand was tingling where Draco had touched him. He missed the contact instantly, and he wondered what that meant. All his worries of awkwardness and falling back into old habits were unfounded. The three of them fell into an easy conversation about the upcoming school year, and how glad Narcissa was that Draco had decided to return. Andromeda called Draco into the dining room to help set the table. When Narcissa finally broke the silence she leaned close to Harry and whispered, "Thank you Harry, for everything really, but especially for accepting Draco's apology and friendship. I was worried about him being in the Manor all alone this summer but he's changed since the two of you began talking, he seems at peace for the first time in years, more like my memory of him as a child. There is nothing I can do to repay you for bringing that peace back to him."
Draco lit up, "well we only have the library, which won't take long as the walls are mostly covered in books, and the last guest room which we should be able to finish before the end of the day." As he finished, Draco's face fell a little.
Draco stepped through the floor right at ten the next morning. He was carrying a ruck sack and a bottle of wine.
“Er, thanks”, he finally managed to stammer, gesturing for Draco to follow him into the dining room.
This weekend was bitter sweet, on top of everything else it was Ron and Hermione's wedding. They had gotten engaged a month after the Battle and decided they wanted to be married before they all went back for their final year at Hogwarts. They were leaving from the wedding to go on a two month honeymoon that their parents insisted they take just for themselves now that the war was over and they could enjoy some peace and relaxation. They were hesitant, both worried about leaving Harry, but he waived off their concern and even gave them a small fortune as a wedding gift to spend on their trip.
As they were about to say goodbye and go their separate ways, Harry blurted out before he could stop himself, "Wanna come have a drink at my place?"
Much to Harry's disappointment Draco was always dressed when he came down for breakfast so he never got to see him in pajamas. He couldn't complain too much however because Draco always had on a pair of muggle jeans that fit him like a second skin with a Polo t-shirt, the sleeves snug on his arms so Harry could admire his toned biceps. Yes all of it was driving Harry mad, and he didn't know what to do. Draco hadn't hinted at or said anything to make Harry think he felt anything more than friendship towards him.
“I got a fucking lecture from my boss, who said we should have called for backup. Who said we should have put up more wards. Guess who was in charge of those two things. I don’t care how fucking arrogant you are in your own cases but not if you jeopardise my career with it!”
“You’re not protecting yourself correctly. You need to get a feel for the resistance you need to build up. Why don’t you-”
. He wanted to devour him. Harry’s skin was burning with desire, and steadily, he watched Malfoy fall apart beneath his tender touch. But oh, if only he knew how
Harry’s obsession with Draco Malfoy had never quite subsided. Despite not thinking he was a Death Eater anymore, Harry continued to observe him, study him. Malfoy did the same. What once was rivalry had turned into a sort of intense mutual respect, and though they hardly ever talked in privacy, it was often that their eyes would meet when they trained or worked in groups. Of course they insulted each other just as much as they had when they were teenagers.
“What is it, Malfoy”, Harry asked, and in a question that would usually be snapped at the other with annoyance, there was only a tone of lust and amusement, “You’re awfully responsive for someone who claims they would top.”
“You’re not protecting yourself correctly. You need to get a feel for the resistance you need to build up. Why don’t you-”
They spent the rest of their day gathering information on the cave, Malfoy reporting to Harry in regular intervals about the types of curses and hexes set up. Harry researched and compared his findings with what the information the Ministry had provided them with. Together they were able to draw some solid conclusions on the origins of the wizards who’d set the market up and Malfoy was able to break through a first layer of curses. They worked incredibly well together and even though neither admitted it out loud, they both knew it.
Rematerialising in front of him was the Room of Requirement, fire chasing up a pile of furniture, flames licking at tables and chairs, devouring everything in its heat. Then he saw Crabbe, clinging onto a chair desperately, losing his grip and falling into the fiendfyre. The last thing he saw was the fear in his eyes, the terrible, awful fear that Harry knew all too well, the type that only came from knowing you were about to die.
Harry snorted at the remark and reluctantly backtracked into his office, offering Shacklebolt a seat.
In Draco’s sixth year he was determined to save it, determined to make his parents proud regardless of the increasingly large doubt building up within him.
“We were just the same, if you think about it”, Harry reflected, smiling at Draco’s last remark, “both fighting for our parents, what we believed to be the right side. I think that’s why we’re both here right now, don’t you? Because we understand each other.”
He opened the door and was faced with Draco. Contrary to his expectations, he wasn’t overdressed at all, wearing an emerald green turtleneck and simple black trousers.
“I could hardly call it a job well done if I haven’t actually seen you do it, Potter”, Draco retorted, making sure to emphasise Harry’s surname.
Walking up to face Lord Voldemort, hearing his heartbeat drum in his ears, the trees around him keeping him cold and scared.
Late at night when he was alone with the world, Harry let himself imagine it was mutual longing, that Malfoy too had found the intensity of their relationship to be comprised of more than rivalry. That when the hate disappeared he too was left with this
Draco looked at his wand in Potter’s hand, almost incredulous. Potter cleared his throat lightly and extended his arm further.
Malfoy sighed when he heard a cap flick open, and though Harry’s arm had been released from his waist, he pushed his hips up further anyway.
“I’m sorry your godfather died, Harry”, Draco said, and for the first time in a while they made eye contact. Harry thanked him and they talked, conversation beginning to flow steadily; for a brief moment he thought back on Slughorn’s hourglass and how the sand would be in stasis right then.
“Er, thanks”, he finally managed to stammer, gesturing for Draco to follow him into the dining room.
When he was satisfied with his work he reconnected their lips, and their kiss became more forceful, more heated, and Draco’s hands found themselves at Harry’s side, pulling his body flush against his own.
Harry thought to follow him for a second, to try and convince him he could be open about how he had felt, to offer to talk it all out. But he realised that perhaps enough boundaries set up for self-preservation had been crossed for one day.
Friday afternoons in the ministry were never particularly enjoyable; typically Harry spent them trying to sift through his seemingly endless stacks of paperwork, report after report, details upon details, all there in thousands of finely printed letters in his files. More often than not he would furiously sort and correct reports until the last rays of sunshine had disappeared and London was engulfed in the dark of night, his only motivation the upcoming weekend. Not that he did much then, but really, anything was better than all this cursed paperwork. It really was the worst part of being an auror.
“Be there in a second!” he yelled, turning down the heat on his stove, wiping his messy hands on the apron he’d borrowed from Molly- “for no particular reason, Molly, I just don’t want to have to wash my clothes every time I cook”.
, the way that Harry smelled, the way his touches lingered, the way his cock felt inside him. And Draco was getting off on it, he was so close, so thoroughly fucked out, but his cock still twitched at Harry’s suggestion, and he felt a rapidly approaching orgasm pooling in his stomach.
He started pumping Draco’s cock in earnest, watching how it jumped and twitched in arousal at his every touch. Draco’s hips were still gyrating as he emitted small sounds with every stroke.
So he did. Potter explained that Voldemort’s ability to look into his mind had allowed him to be corrupted to such an extent that it had cost the life of Sirius Black. He explained that they had spent seventh year searching for Horcruxes, that Voldemort had found out because he could look into his mind. He explained that Snape had tried to teach him, that he had failed, but if there ever was to be another wizard like Voldemort, Harry wasn’t going to let anyone else look into his mind.
”s. They were barely audible, but as he fucked his tongue into Malfoy more steadily, the noises grew louder.
And then the scene disappeared and Harry was back at Hogwarts, an army of Death Eaters standing before him, Voldemort leading them to face the fighters on Hogwarts’ side- on his side- and he realised Draco was amongst them. Voldemort spoke, and it was just as Harry had remembered: arrogant, his voice drenched in the illusion of victory.
“We were just the same, if you think about it”, Harry reflected, smiling at Draco’s last remark, “both fighting for our parents, what we believed to be the right side. I think that’s why we’re both here right now, don’t you? Because we understand each other.”
So Harry got up and retrieved the nearest piece of parchment and a quill. Sitting down at his desk, the parchment faintly illuminated only by the
“We caught the dark wizards, we secured their ware, I don’t know what more you want”, Harry retorted, stepping towards Malfoy now, “Perhaps if you weren’t so bloody stuck up you’d be able to see we completed the fucking assignment”.
“I’m sorry”, Draco finished, and Potter’s eyes flit back and forth between his own. They studied each other for a second, perhaps because they needed the familiarity.
He was overcome with a sudden understanding of his feelings and it felt like a tidal wave of emotion crashing over him, enveloping him in the warm, salty water, pulling him forwards against Draco, their lips crashing together.
“Yes”, he conceded, and he sounded winded already, “Potter”. He moaned softly as he pushed his hips up in a search for friction.
“Do I smell Italian? Romantic”, Draco remarked, smirking. It wasn’t a smirk sourced in arrogance. It was a simple tease.
It was about two in the morning when his owl returned, a new piece of parchment attached. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, and he scolded himself for it. He wasn’t a bloody first year receiving their first love letter.
Harry could always decipher Malfoy, though his facial expression always emanated nonchalance and professionalism. Malfoy had always been good at controlling his body, moving and talking with an elegance that made him almost ethereal. It made many women in the ministry giggle when he talked, many stare when he trained, and Harry was well aware that he wasn’t the only one who thought him to be fascinating. But it wasn’t his body that made Harry so interested, his body wasn’t what Harry knew better than anything.
“Fuck, you can come Draco, you’ve been so good for me”, Harry groaned as he snapped his hips into Draco again and again, “you’re so fucking tight, wanna see you come”.
“I need to talk to your mother. I need to thank her as well”, he said, as if that explained anything.
Harry was coaxing him, and leaned closer as he spoke. Then his head dipped again, sucking and biting at Draco’s beautifully pale neck. He stopped, admiring the three purple splotches he’d marked his skin with, the steady rhythm of his thrusts never faltering.
, Harry thought, the Minister of Magic himself standing outside of his door right as he was getting off work was never a good sign.
“Potter-”, he starts, “don’t tell anyone. Please”. Harry nods back and with a loud crack, Malfoy is gone.
“Do I smell Italian? Romantic”, Draco remarked, smirking. It wasn’t a smirk sourced in arrogance. It was a simple tease.
He hadn’t told anyone, not Ron, not Hermione, not Ginny, but it felt right to tell Malfoy in that moment.
Rematerialising in front of him was the Room of Requirement, fire chasing up a pile of furniture, flames licking at tables and chairs, devouring everything in its heat. Then he saw Crabbe, clinging onto a chair desperately, losing his grip and falling into the fiendfyre. The last thing he saw was the fear in his eyes, the terrible, awful fear that Harry knew all too well, the type that only came from knowing you were about to die.
“You should get some sleep. And eat some food, I’ve heated up those delicious looking prepacked meals the Ministry gives us for field days”, Harry said and cracked a lopsided smile when Malfoy replied with an equally sarcastic “smells absolutely delectable”.
He was quieter around Ron and Hermione, although he brushed it off as fatigue when asked about it. It wasn’t like he could casually explain he had been round his former rival’s place a few times even though it wasn’t entirely necessary and he was thinking about him more than in sixth year.
“I came to reap what I sowed, Potter”, Draco finally said, his voice back to his haughty, usual tone, “since you so boldly stated you, and I quote you on this,
“What, were you expecting a tux? I’m sorry to disappoint”, Draco quipped, as if he had read Harry’s mind.
And he wanted to see Draco laugh. He wanted to see him giggle so hard he would hold his sides and couldn’t breathe. He wanted to see Draco be fascinated, be excited by new things he discovered and old things he was passionate about. He wanted to see Draco feel, see him as he truly was.
“Does that feel good, Draco?” Harry teased, “do you like feeling my fingers inside you? Bet you wish it was my cock instead”.
It took Harry just a few seconds too long to grasp what Draco was referring to. But when he did, he rose to the challenge.
“I’m never going to master this”, he huffed, frustrated with himself, “I told myself I wasn’t going to let anyone in. I’m not afraid. So what am I doing wrong?”
But somehow it felt right, them there, together, practising magic. It seemed to slowly bridge over the abyss of war that had separated them. It seemed to slowly mend some wounds of the war that weren’t visible.
Draco’s voice was soft and calm. It occured to Harry that this was the first time he’d ever heard Draco speak without an edge in his voice. It was surprisingly pleasant, listening to him talk.
“Besides”, he continued after Harry hadn’t said anything for a while, “my cock is bigger than yours”.
Draco kissed like a Slytherin, with ambition and control, trying to push into Harry so he could be on top of him.
Harry thinks he looks like he’s about to shatter into a million pieces so he closes the gap between their bodies and pulls him into an embrace. He doesn’t know what else to do, so he holds Draco close as he shakes and cries quietly into his shoulder.
- so hard”, he whimpered. Harry let Draco adjust for a moment or two; he knew he was ready when the blond rocked his hips and fucked himself back onto Harry’s cock. He let him do it. He looked gorgeous, his back muscles contracting and relaxing as he pushed his body back against Harry’s. And then Harry grabbed his hips, forcing him to a halt.
“Please”, Malfoy mumbled, seemingly almost ashamed. Perhaps it was how exposed he was. Draco Malfoy was always one to conceal himself. And to be there, sprawled out on Potter’s bed with his legs widened and cock hanging hard between his legs, he felt exposed. He felt vulnerable
He cocked his head sideways, studying Harry, who was catching his breath. Harry prayed he wouldn’t mention what he saw, and he didn’t.
And it worked. Harry felt the wall around him, he saw the room around him. His memories refused to reveal themselves, refused to manifest. He saw Draco in front of him, the look of equal parts shock and joy on his face. And he smiled. And the wall remained.
“You will be the only auror, yes, but you won’t be alone. We have received intel on some dark wizards hosting a black market for magical creatures. Of course the place is warded well with highly dangerous curses. I have got someone from the Curse Breakers’ department collaborating on this case. I’ve got all the relevant documents here. You will report to my office Monday morning at eight.”
Harry looked around the room. Draco’s four poster bed was in the centre of his room, headboard bordering the wall, and his wardrobe beside it. Other than that, there was nothing but a trunk that was open on the floor, half under his bed. Harry could make out several pictures of Draco and his friends- friends he had lost in the war- as well as his Slytherin robe and a few textbooks. It looked as if he had just come home from the last day of school, as if the war had never happened and he had simply left all his furniture at Hogwarts for some reason. Maybe it was intentional.
A strange feeling settled in the pit of his stomach; it was a weird concoction of anticipation, excitement, and nervousness. He’d invited Draco over on an impulse, simply because he’d felt the need to keep the conversation going, not wanting it- and by extension their correspondence and interaction- to fade away.
“In the Room of Requirement”, Potter began, and the horrid memories of the fire flashed in Draco’s mind, “I asked why you didn’t identify me. I’ve come to realise that, if you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine. But I want to thank you, regardless of the reason you did it for”.
Harry, who pulled away slightly, waiting for Draco to yell at him, to call him disgusting and weird, to get up and leave.
“In the Room of Requirement”, Potter began, and the horrid memories of the fire flashed in Draco’s mind, “I asked why you didn’t identify me. I’ve come to realise that, if you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine. But I want to thank you, regardless of the reason you did it for”.
Harry wasn’t too sure he needed it to understand how Occlumency worked, but something within him made him agree. Maybe it was a need to give Draco reassurance, maybe he wanted to show him that he cared, too.
They walked back to the living room, where Narcissa sat on the black armchair still as ever; she stood up immediately upon recognising who was in Draco’s company.
“Potter”, Draco said with a curt nod, no less surprised at Potter’s second visit than he was at his first.
They’d since moved to the much more comfortable sofa in front of the fireplace, both mostly staring into the flames. Harry told Draco about how Sirius Black had once managed to communicate with him through the flames of the Gryffindor common room’s fireplace.
Narcissa nodded, and Draco too sat down in the third armchair of the room. It was the only furniture in the room; in fact, it was almost the only furniture in the entire manor.
, Draco. Are you embarrassed to wank in front of me? Go on, Draco. I can see how hard you are for me. Show me how much you enjoy touching yourself for me.”
He circled one finger at Draco’s hole gingerly, pushing it in slowly, and Draco pushed his hips back onto it.
Narcissa formed the beginning of a sentence, but burst into tears before anything coherent came out. She rushed out of the room, ashamed, overwhelmed.
With a million thoughts racing through his head and a weird mixture of feelings settled in his stomach, Harry floo’d into the Ministry on Monday morning at 7:50 sharp and headed straight to Shacklebolt’s office.
“Fuck, please, Harry”, Draco whined, “please, let me come, I’m so hard, your cock feels so good inside me. Please, oh
“-thank you for what you did”, Potter finished his sentence at the same time as Draco interrupted him.
In the two weeks following Potter’s visit Draco and Narcissa had told each other the truth, the truth about how each of them had concealed Potter, and it felt good to be honest. Their lives continued with little change.
A strange feeling settled in the pit of his stomach; it was a weird concoction of anticipation, excitement, and nervousness. He’d invited Draco over on an impulse, simply because he’d felt the need to keep the conversation going, not wanting it- and by extension their correspondence and interaction- to fade away.
Harry’s breath hitched as he stared at Malfoy in front of him. His arch nemesis. His cock was out, and so was his own.
Backing away from the door as cautiously as he could, Ron resumed his trip to the library. The last thing he wanted is to hear his best friend shag.
He walked in long, quick strides, the hard heel of his shoe clicking on the ground with every step, the sound echoing through the empty hallways of the cold and desolate manor. From his back pocket he grabbed his wand- just in case. Draco couldn’t pretend to be a victim of the war, but its aftermath hadn’t been easy on what was left of his family. Once the proudest pureblood supremacists, the Malfoys were reduced to a whimsical duo of mother and son, their only objective survival.
Harry categorically refused to acknowledge this. He knew he would be going down a dangerous path lusting after his former rival and he knew how easily it could lead to more than that because Harry had found himself respecting and outright admiring Malfoy’s character the more he worked with him. And he also knew that Draco Malfoy was dating Pansy Parkinson and Harry didn’t feel like dealing with unrequited feelings, especially when they were as obstinate as this.
”, Harry pleaded, feeling completely drained within a matter of seconds. He was certain he would have collapsed had he not been sitting down in the first place. He expected Draco to yell, to tell him to focus, tell him that he wasn’t good enough, but Draco spoke as softly as he had before.
“And since no one can know we are working this case, we cannot risk Muggles seeing you either. We have provided you with a charmed tent in which you will stay while you work this case”, Shacklebolt finished his explanation.
“Next time I top”, Draco mumbled tiredly, his body half-covered by the bedsheet Harry had draped over them.
“Mr Potter”, she said, just as surprised as Draco had been, her voice rough and raspy as though she had not spoken in weeks.
“I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that this is very high-profile”, Shackebolt continued, “and that your utmost discretion will be required when handling it”.
He thought about their hug, how he’d wanted nothing more in that moment than to be there for Malfoy, how he had just
It was something he couldn’t ignore anymore. Not now that the waves of war had crashed over them, and all that remained was the rhythmic ebb and flow of life's ups and downs. He sought out Draco’s attention because he wanted to feel noticed by him, he wanted to spend time with him.
“Gonna come inside you, Draco”, Harry moaned in his ear, “You’re so tight, Draco, I’m so fucking close”.
Harry scoffed. Now this was the Draco he knew; yet he couldn’t help a small smile creeping up on his face.
Draco took out his wand, pointing it at the man in front of him. Then he lowered it slightly and asked, “are you sure?”
Harry wanted to tease him; he wanted to give a retort and make Malfoy say it, say that he was a bottom and wanted Harry’s cock inside him, but Malfoy lying there, flushed and his arse on full display,
They talked about the divides in wizarding ideologies and beliefs, about how deeply they were rooted in wizard culture.
“Narcissa”, he said, speaking softly, and Draco leaned slightly forwards involuntarily, “I want to thank you for saving my life”.
“Potter, I knew you were daft but I didn’t think you were this thick. Do you need me to teach you how to read so I can spell out the words ‘I’m gay’ for you until you get it? Are you really that oblivious? Really?”, Malfoy snapped and taunted.
“Fuck”, Draco said, having returned to reality. His voice wasn’t on edge like it had been only moments prior, but the crisp coolness had not returned either. His voice was warm and soft like honey, and Harry revelled in the decadence of listening to it.
“Of course I do”. Harry laughed; it was a laugh that came from his chest, he was genuinely pleased, and it was open and it once again stirred the heart of poor Draco, who had the urge to pull him into a tight hug. So he did.
“Trust me, Potter”, Malfoy replied slowly, confidently, “I know how to have fun”, and then he winked at Harry and turned around to walk back to the fire.
“Oh,” Harry stuttered. “Oh my. That’s. That’s amazing!!” He stood up and gave  them both a hug. He tried to ignore the tightness in his chest as he thought about how his two best friends were making this important life step without him. He didn’t want to be left behind, and yet, they were moving into unchartered territory and he was stagnant. Harry squirmed out of the group hug when he noticed that Ron and Hermione were focused very intently on each other, and went back to his spot on the couch. He flicked his wand and turned on his portable TV to distract himself as Ron and Hermione, still embracing, backed towards the stairs to head to the room that they shared.
“I thought perhaps the two of you were working things out,” McGonagall mused. “Or were you rekindling the flames of your schooltime rivalry? Whichever the case, I must insist that you try to at least
Harry heard the distinct pop of Draco disapparating and leaned back in his seat, very confused. He shook his head, as if that would help clear it. But the image of Draco, looking slightly disheveled and wearing his Weasley sweater, wouldn’t leave his mind no matter how hard he tried.
Satisfied with Draco’s response, Harry pushed his cock in entirely in one go, hard and fast, and began thrusting in a similar fashion.
at Harry (who nearly choked on the pasta in his mouth). It drove Harry wild, the usual confidence he knew in Draco paired with this newfound, far more amiable side of him.
The table and Death Eaters dissolved and he saw himself, his face disfigured from Hermione’s stinging jinx, a flash and he was gone, it was only Lucius left in the room. He was shouting and Harry could only make out single words- failure, disappointment, shame- but he was furious, and when he raised his wand and muttered
Walking up to face Lord Voldemort, hearing his heartbeat drum in his ears, the trees around him keeping him cold and scared.
They ate mostly in comfortable silence, making occasional small talk. And then Draco would make a remark, too obvious to be a come-on, but said with too much of a blush to be a joke. One time he’d even had the audacity to
He’d broken up with Ginny for good shortly after the war had ended, quickly realising that it had separated them significantly. He still enjoyed her friendship, and thought it was ultimately better for both of them to have the freedom to experiment and try new things. At seventeen, a life-long commitment to his high school romance wasn’t right for either of them. Ever since he hadn’t properly dated, preferring to fulfil his sexual needs with occasional one night stands sourced from muggle bars. Ultimately he enjoyed those experiences, both with men and women, and he often found the best part to be the fact that he was regarded simply as an ordinary bloke. In the muggle world, he wasn’t The Chosen One or The Boy who Lived, he was just Harry.
Their eyes met, and Harry’s fiery green determination was met with Draco’s glistening grey contemplation. Harry searched Draco’s eyes for doubt, fear perhaps, something that was making him hold back.
“You undoubtedly ensured my victory in the battle against Voldemort”, Potter continued, and both Narcissa and Draco winced at the mention of His name, “and I had to come here in person to let you know that I truly appreciate that”.
”, he whispers, voice breaking, and hundreds of narcissus flowers rain in Lucius’ face, like white-gold rain forcing him to backtrack until he stumbles back into the chest.
“You undoubtedly ensured my victory in the battle against Voldemort”, Potter continued, and both Narcissa and Draco winced at the mention of His name, “and I had to come here in person to let you know that I truly appreciate that”.
“I’d explain to you that I prefer to spend my money on things that are fun, but I don’t feel like explaining the concept of fun tonight”, Harry retorted.
“Don’t act like you don’t like this better”, he replied, and he wasn’t quite sure where the confidence came from. Just to prove his point, he shifted in Draco’s lap. Draco drew in a sharp breath in response.
Henry’s face was twisted in pain. Harry clenched his fist. “We need to get the animal that did this.”
Her creamy skin, spiced like cider, was warm where her arm touched Harry’s. The sunlight was hot on the rocks, the summer day burning off as the night tried to fall. Fireflies danced in the heavy air surrounding the burrow.
He had spoken to Kingsley and the rest of the task force that had been assembled late the previous night. It wasn’t good. This breach of information would make the investigation that much harder. The only good news was that the prophet and maybe their source didn’t know about the others.
“It’s alright. It gets easier.” The man winked. It occured to him belatedly that he was in a gay wizarding bar. Harry tried to spot women among the gyrating bodies and found none. Harry took another sip of the drink. The man with advice chuckled gently and then pulled on Harry’s arm.
Harry flinched, “is now really the time for this?” It was an obvious attempt at redirection, but it seemed to have worked when the older man simply continued.
“Lumos,” the medics said almost in unison, casting bright lights garishly over the alley. They descended in swift motions, pulling back the cloak and noting the blood splatters across the wall. One man, older than the other two, waved the younger medics closer to the body. His gloved hand reached down to check the body. Henry, Harry reminded himself, they bent to check Henry.
“Not much,” Harry exhaled, closing his eyes, but the cloak was burned onto his vision. “ His name is...was...Henry Jackobs. He was 18 years old.”
Harry gulped, he had known, but hearing the words made it as real as the cobblestones that they stood on. “I need to report back to the ministry.” He said with a nod, “I’ll leave you to write your official notes on this.” The old mediwizard dipped his head in reply.
“Relax,” cautioned Harry’s mentor, as he put his arms up in the air and began swaying with the music too.
Ginny straightened up and shifted the apple between her hands. “I...don’t know.” her smile was gone, weak as under steeped tea. “I just...need someone to talk to.”
Harry hoped he would leave then, but instead Malfoy made himself comfortable and started to dance on the spot. Draco turned away and Harry watched his shoulder blades.
Harry took a sip of coffee and watched her snoring softly. When the cup was empty he scribbled a note on a napkin, the ink smearing near the coffee ring. ‘Went to work.’
Harry had made no progress on determining the connection between the victims. The photos of them smiling lined up next to each other on his desk top. Harry stared at their faces begging them to make some kind of connection to each other. They were all young men, younger than Harry, but all were 18 or older. It was a short range of ages and seemed to be a factor in the killer’s selection.
Draco chuckled, “Don’t flatter yourself, Potter. I wouldn’t even dream of touching you. Your purity is safe from me.”
“Harry Potter”, Draco practically yelled, out of breath, “if you don’t fuck me properly right this second I will get up and-”
“My apologies, Malfoy, I’d forgotten you’re dating that stupid bint Parkinson”, Harry retorted, walking closer until they were face-to-face, daring Malfoy to take a step back and admit defeat.
He saw the Manor, the great conference table, Professor Burbage in the centre, lifeless, a single tear trickling down her cold cheek, then Nagini’s jaw unhinging to devour her, with sharp, unforgiving teeth.
A few years ago there had been a lot. When their rivalry bore no actual weight, before it was burdened with the lives of dozens. Draco had never understood why Potter would choose the poor Weasley boy over him, over power and pride. After all, Draco had been brought up to believe that those were the most important things in life and that they came with blood status. So he’d spent his childhood resenting Potter for rejecting his hand on his first day at Hogwarts, resenting him for rejecting the values he thought to be the only ones that mattered. He’d spent his childhood settling for negative attention from Potter, figuring it would be the only way he’d get it at all.
They were in Draco’s bedroom again, Harry not really making any improvement. His frustration grew until he snapped.
at Harry (who nearly choked on the pasta in his mouth). It drove Harry wild, the usual confidence he knew in Draco paired with this newfound, far more amiable side of him.
“Want to see your face when you come for me, Draco”, he breathed against the other’s lips. And Harry remembered he had a raging boner that wanted to feel the tight heat of Draco’s arse again, wanted to feel him clench around his cock.
“You’re aroused”, Malfoy breathed, barely loudly enough for Ron to hear. And then his breath hitched.
, Harry, fuck”, Malfoy moaned as his neglected erection received the touch it had been deprived from. And it was touch from Harry Potter himself, his perhaps-not-so-secret crush of a few years, and known enemy. It was glorious, and it was
“Here”, he continued, disregarding Harry’s lack of response, and handed him a bottle of wine that looked like it had cost more than every drink Harry had ever had combined.
Yet Draco was still surprised when he opened the door to be faced with none other than Potter himself.
They were in Draco’s bedroom again, Harry not really making any improvement. His frustration grew until he snapped.
It was something he couldn’t ignore anymore. Not now that the waves of war had crashed over them, and all that remained was the rhythmic ebb and flow of life's ups and downs. He sought out Draco’s attention because he wanted to feel noticed by him, he wanted to spend time with him.
, yes, right there”, Draco moaned and pushed his hips down in an effort to get Harry to fuck him faster.
He felt the heat gather in his face as he realised what he was listening to: and he really didn’t need to hear any more about his friend’s cock. Or Malfoy’s cock. Or anyone’s cock. Merlin, it was the first time that all he really wanted is to immerse himself in his Herbology textbook.
He thought about the boggart, about Lucius Malfoy stepping out of that chest, and his stomach twisted when he thought about the things that caused this to be his boggart.
The sun had been down for a good hour and it had been equally long since they’d spoken to each other. Harry sat by the fire, watching Malfoy work. He stood in front of the cave, wand and hand raised as he moved both in intricate movements, mumbling words Harry didn’t know. He listened to the soft tapping of the rain on his dome of charms as he mused on the man in front of him. The fire illuminated his back and seemed to dip his body in soft gold, the flames dancing on the fabric of his dark green jumper. Even from behind, Harry could watch him work silently for ages, but decided that he better make sure they both rest as well.
Draco and Narcissa had thrown out everything but their beds, wardrobes, and the three armchairs of the living room, along with two chairs and a table to eat on in that same room. It had brought back too many memories, too many awful flashbacks every time they saw the large conference table on which Professor Burbage had been violently tortured and murdered, every time they saw the bed Voldemort had slept in, the cabinets that reminded them of the Vanishing cabinet. Everything was just wrong and they tried helplessly to erase every last memory of the war by burning down a pyre of everything they didn’t absolutely need.
They both hissed as their cocks made contact, Malfoy leaking another bead of precum that now smeared on Harry’s stomach. It was intoxicatingly hot, and Harry spun them around tentatively, walking Malfoy backwards until the backs of his knees hit the bed and Harry was on top of him. For a second, they broke apart from the kiss. Without a second thought Harry fumbled with the pesky buttons on Malfoy's white dress shirt, while the other helplessy tugged at his own. Harry’s pupils were dilated as he raked his eyes over Malfoy, who was flushed in a raspberry pink on his cheeks and chest. He leaned down and flicked his tongue over Malfoy’s nipple, who bucked into the touch and swore.
and leave it at that, to shut Potter out of his house and mind for eternity. But he couldn’t quite do it. Too many things were left unsaid and so he looked him in the eye and replied.
“Oh fuck”, Malfoy moaned again, and any anger was gone as he pushed his hips forwards into Harry’s, who thrust right back.
Harry moved his hand, placing it behind Malfoy’s neck to pull him in close. Their lips were mere millimetres from touching. He felt the other’s hot breath against his lips, and he was sure that if he looked down he would see their cocks as close to touching as their lips were.
“Oh”, Draco exhaled, like all the air was pushed out of his lungs. He breathed heavily, his mouth hanging open as he began rocking his hips back and forth.
Sirius Black falling through the veil, feeling his body jerk as he wanted to lunge forwards, follow him into the unknown, because a world without his godfather wasn’t one Harry wanted to live in.
He’d once taken such pride in being the son of Lucius Malfoy, the heir to the Malfoy estate, and the purest of wizards in his mind. But as the years went by the façade of honour and greatness crumbled quickly; his father’s eyes sank impossibly far into his head, surrounded by dark blue rings which stood out especially against his sickly pale skin. For the better part of the last three years, he’d looked awful. The more Draco watched his father’s fruitless attempts at pleasing the Dark Lord, the more he realised that Voldemort’s faith in his father had disappeared.
Draco and Narcissa had thrown out everything but their beds, wardrobes, and the three armchairs of the living room, along with two chairs and a table to eat on in that same room.

Everything was just wrong and they tried helplessly to erase every last memory of the war by burning down a pyre of everything they didn’t absolutely need.
“Why are you here”, Draco stated more than asked, being far too surprised to even comment on Potter’s use of his first name. He tried not to stare at the man before him. He wore a clean, grey t-shirt that revealed the several bandages on his arms. Although he didn’t look as awfully malnourished, Potter didn’t look well. Draco felt stupid for thinking all would be well for Potter and his friends just because their side had won. A wave of empathy overcame him and it felt strange to stand across from him once again, yet neither insulting the other. They were both too tired.
Then, as if overcome with a sudden need for self protection, he turned away abruptly and walked to the other side of the room, staring out of his window, his arms crossed in front of him.
Harry climbed on top of him and they fumbled with each other’s clothes, Draco desperately tugging off Harry’s shirt as all the tension they’d built over the last days (or much, much longer, which neither of them were quite willing to admit to themselves) overflowed. Harry, who was far less patient, simply vanished Draco’s shirt before flicking his tongue at one of his nipples, grinning as it turned hard. Draco moaned as Harry licked it again, brushing his finger over the other one.
Draco’s chest was rising and falling rapidly with each breath, his entire chest was tinted a delightful shade of pink, similarly to his cheeks. His mouth parted and he emitted little whines with every thrust.
“I’m sorry”, Draco finished, and Potter’s eyes flit back and forth between his own. They studied each other for a second, perhaps because they needed the familiarity.
It was a strange sound to his ear, his voice so guttural. On the other hand, Malfoy seemed to enjoy it: the faint, white-blond hair on his arm stood up as he shivered slightly. They still weren’t touching, as if any move could ruin this careful balance between them, right on the verge of breaking the unspoken agreement of hatred between them. Arguably they’d already crossed that line, Harry mused, considering he was eyeing Malfoy’s now hard cock, watching a small pearl of precum form at its tip.
It was warm and soft and wonderful and Draco gasped at their initial touch, his hands rapidly finding their way back to Harry’s face again.
Harry’s apartment was small- quaint, as he liked to say. The walls were decorated with pictures of his friends that waved and smiled at him, but other than that, everything was muggle. The dining room was not much larger than the kitchen, the table just big enough to fit two people sitting at it. Accordingly, he owned exactly two chairs, two pairs of cutlery, two of everything.
It was his eyes. Harry knew exactly how Malfoy’s eyes lit up when he broke a curse, how they glistened with fiery determination when he duelled or argued, he knew how they stared into the distance when he was deep in thought. He could decipher everything about Malfoy just through his grey eyes.
Harry suddenly realised he’d felt more euphoric at Draco’s warm, soft hands on his face than he did making progress in Occlumency.
“It’s not just that, it’s...” Harry trailed off. He thought about telling Oliver everything: that he and Draco had been pulling the puppet strings behind the scenes this entire time, that Draco knew better than anyone that Cormac’s relationship with Percy was not strictly work based, that Percy was just using Oliver to get a down payment on this house until Cormac made a commitment. But then he remembered the look on Draco’s face when he walked out of the flat the day before, and he hesitated.  This hesitation was enough for Oliver to turn his attention back to the work on his desk and dismiss Harry.
"It's perfectly safe," Draco sneered. "They told me it was for a werewolf, but they left out the important detail that the werewolf was
“Now that I have your attention,” Malfoy leaned on the desk. “Why did you let them go to a concert?”
At half past seven, Percy Weasley strode up to Harry’s desk and placed a stack of papers in Harry’s inbox.

“Wow, Potter. It’s truly a wonder they didn’t promote you straight to Head Auror with those keen observational skills.” Draco drawled sarcastically.
The relaxed work environment that Harry and Draco had been enjoying since setting up their bosses came crashing to a halt the week before Christmas. Harry arrived at his desk ten minutes early, but found Percy standing in front of it with his arms crossed and a stack of papers already in his inbox. Draco found himself in a similar situation when he arrived to work that morning. The only difference was that while Percy was quietly seething at Harry’s desk, Oliver’s frustration had already boiled over. Draco had to duck as Oliver ripped a bat off his wall and hit a well aimed decorative bludger towards his head.  Oliver, having just noticed that Draco had entered the office, dropped the bat unceremoniously at his feet.
,” Draco said scathingly, “The glasses only refill themselves when left on the table. It’d hardly be safe for them to refill themselves while someone was actively in the process of drinking.”
This sounds an awful lot like Harry is at least attracted to Cedric, even if he’s not interested in him romantically (or willing to admit that he is, feelings are complicated for him).
“Well that was certainly eye-opening, Cormac. Thank you ever so much for letting me know we had apparently broken up.” Draco said pointedly.
The sun was only just beginning to rise when Harry woke up.  After weeks of taking the dreaded early-morning shift at the Auror Office, he had hoped that on his day off he would be able to sleep in, but no such luck.  The only thing that Harry had planned for the day was attending the Holyhead Harpies’ game.  He didn’t need to be at the Quidditch pitch until the late afternoon, so Harry took his time getting ready and cleaned up Grimmauld Place a little.  He wanted to invite Ginny over after the game, hopefully to celebrate her win, so he thought it was probably a good idea to put away his laundry and make sure that no unwanted magical creatures had made a home in any of the less frequented rooms.
“Yeah, you should see your face. You’ve got a few new scars now, so you won’t have to worry about your lightning scar being the first thing people notice,” Ron chuckled darkly. Hermione glared at him, but Harry gave a tight smile.
Harry and Draco reappeared in an alley a block from an Indian restaurant that was near the Ministry. Harry felt his stomach flip as he recovered from their abrupt disapparation. Their shoulders bumped into each other occasionally as they rushed to get to where delicious food was waiting for them. The thought quickly passed through Harry’s mind that the feeling in his stomach was not entirely unpleasant and he wondered if there was more to it than just the effects of side-along apparation.  He didn’t have time to dwell on it because he found himself seated at a table with a menu propped in front of him.
“Of course, any friend of yours is welcome here, there’s plenty of food.” Mrs. Weasley grinned, although it faltered slightly when Draco appeared from behind Harry. Draco stuck out his hand for a handshake, but she didn’t take it. Instead, she wrapped him up in a bear hug as well. “Happy Christmas!”
“Yeah, he’s been an utter tit the past week. You’d think that he’d be happy to be free of that twat, McLaggen. And yet…” Pansy reached down and made a grab for one of the acid pops in Ginny’s lap.
“Oh shit,” Draco stopped eating and began to dab at his shirt with a napkin. A bright orange stain had appeared on his otherwise pristine shirt. He knew he couldn’t use magic around muggles, but he also didn’t want to look like a slob in public.
the potions master at this school, I would be the most qualified." Draco explained. He was pleased to see that this seemed to impress Harry slightly. "And, it's a highly sensitive potion. Only a few professors know about it. You probably aren't one of them."
“Her name is Ginny,” Draco added. But the blush spreading across his cheeks betrayed his true feelings.
“What really brought you to Hogwarts?” McGonagall asked pointedly, her glasses slipping down her nose slightly.  “Clearly, it wasn’t just for the flying, otherwise you wouldn’t have come to my office.”
He could do this. He defeated Lord Voldemort and saved the entire wizarding world, surely he could handle a few third years. But, by the end of the week, Harry would have much rather faced a dark wizard than teach another group of teenagers ever again.
"Are you serious?" Harry caught his wand and the movement caused the devil's snare to spread farther. "I ask you to do one thing and you can't even do that?"
“I didn’t know werewolves could get this drunk,” Harry said to himself. Then he turned to Neville and said in what he believed was a whisper but was definitely not, “I’m a werewolf, Neville.”’
Malfoy. And lo and behold, he’s the same old selfish prick he’s always been.” Harry huffed. “Clearly cares more about his reputation than actual people’s happiness.” He turned on his side and away from Ginny.
“Oh for the love of- I know your breakfast order, I order toast without butter, I sit here in a diner at any hour of the day listening to you whine, because I’m in love with you, you absolute buffoon!” Draco exclaimed, finally feeling a bit of release from expressing his emotions that was immediately followed by pure dread at what he’d just revealed.
“I’m not sure about that, I heard a very different story about your level of ‘poise’ during Quidditch tryouts sixth year.” George teased.
“They’re going to keep you here for a little longer, to make sure there aren’t any other side effects and to try to heal you up as best as they can. The only people who know so far are the healers, and me and Ron since we were your emergency contacts. They’ll have to tell the head of the auror department, probably, but with the wolfsbane potion you should be relatively okay. I’m going to see if I can push some werewolf reform through the Department of the Regulation of Control of Magical Creatures.”
“Well, you’d think you would’ve grown up at all!  What good, pray tell, does the Department of Magical Games and Sports actually do for the Wizarding World, hmm? I don’t believe we would perish without your presence.” Percy retorted, his chest puffing up, all thoughts of civility leaving his mind.
"That happens sometimes, after a traumatic event," Neville said. "But you figured it out before, and you'll figure it out again."
By the time Harry arrived at the Quidditch Pitch, a crowd was already forming at the entrance. He got in line, and out of habit pulled his Holyhead Harpies’ cap down a bit to shield his scar from view.  He didn’t get recognized quite as much as he used to. His defeat of Voldemort was old news--there was always some new trouble brewing that grabbed people’s attention. It also probably had something to do with his request to keep his name out of the papers after a raid. He opted for generic descriptions like “auror” or “ministry official” if an article had to be written. He was still one of the younger aurors in the office, since he insisted that he start at the bottom and work his way up just like everyone else, so his superiors were usually the people who got credit anyway.  Harry thought it was better this way. He liked the fact that he had earned his job through hard work and not just his last name.
And then Harry blew caution to the wind, and gave into his desire since sixth year and kissed Draco.  The waitress smiled from behind the counter as she rang up their bill. She’d been watching their interactions for years, and she was so glad they had finally figured their shit out.
“Thank you for the flowers,” Percy said, twirling the note from the arrangement between his fingers. “You have very sophisticated taste.” There was a pause while the person on the other end of the phone spoke.
The music continued to play as the pair twirled around the dance floor laughing. They stopped spinning as the music slowed and Harry felt a tap on his shoulder.
“He’s not my boyfriend anymore.” A muscle in Draco’s cheek twitched as he replied. “I broke up with him. Or he broke up with me. It all happened very fast a few weeks ago when I walked into his house and Percy---” He stopped suddenly. Harry’s face was full of rage, and he knew he had said too much.
Ginny was over constantly, and this high energy muggle music was always playing, and Draco, drunk on wine, spit out his accusation to Pansy. Pansy had laughed, winked, and gone back into her room leaving Draco with his wine and his thoughts.
“Uh, thanks.” Harry was taken aback slightly. “Do you want to go to The Burrow with me?” The words tumbled out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them.
There that voice was again; and now Ron was sure. He could practically hear the snarl in Draco Malfoy’s voice, the heavy emphasis on the “P” in “Potter” giving him away. To top it off, Draco Malfoy’s voice was coming from Harry’s room.
They counted and tallied every last one, and while Harry examined the storage cabinets Malfoy checked the chests. They were all filled with various food for the creatures, all except for one.
“Harry”, Harry corrected as he bit down on Draco’s neck before sucking a purple mark on his skin, kissing and biting further down, right above his collarbone, which made Draco buck his hips and moan again.
So Harry got up and retrieved the nearest piece of parchment and a quill. Sitting down at his desk, the parchment faintly illuminated only by the
“What, were you expecting a tux? I’m sorry to disappoint”, Draco quipped, as if he had read Harry’s mind.
Harry tried to fight against his eyes fluttering shut, but as he looked up at Draco, who was already drifting off himself, he decided that an overdue talk about how they felt could wait a little longer.
Harry paused, not quite sure how to continue. He wanted to be honest without coming across as condescending, or- god forbid- like he was trying to therapise him.
, Ron thought as he tip-toed towards the wooden door. Wand perched firmly in his hand, he placed his ear right next to the coarse wood as he listened to their conversation.
Arriving at an altered King’s Cross station, knowing he was dead. Seeing the bloodied, deformed creature on the ground-
And he cut himself off with a loud moan as he felt Harry’s blunt tip stretch the rim of his hole. And he pushed back into it, relishing that burn that came with Harry being inside him. He wanted it, he wanted it so badly, and he let Harry know with every inch how

The dining room was not much larger than the kitchen, the table just big enough to fit two people sitting at it. Accordingly, he owned exactly two chairs, two pairs of cutlery, two of everything.
“You gonna come soon?” he mumbled against his lips, “I’m so close. Fuck, Draco, you’re so tight. You have no idea what you do to me. Been thinking about this for so long, your perfect hole clenched tight around my hard cock, fucking you until you have none of your smart words left, until you can’t remember your own name.”
“Not only do you need to concentrate, you need to build a wall around your mind, a wall so strong that nothing can penetrate it, metaphorically speaking of course. Do you follow?”
He said nothing for a second, simply looking into Malfoy’s eyes, still trying to decipher what Malfoy was feeling in that moment.
“You gonna come untouched Draco?” Harry urged him on, “you gonna come just from my cock fucking you so hard you’re not gonna be able to walk for a week? Hm?”
In Draco’s sixth year he was determined to save it, determined to make his parents proud regardless of the increasingly large doubt building up within him.
“I’m sorry your godfather died, Harry”, Draco said, and for the first time in a while they made eye contact. Harry thanked him and they talked, conversation beginning to flow steadily; for a brief moment he thought back on Slughorn’s hourglass and how the sand would be in stasis right then.
Harry was stuck in a trance for a few seconds, watching Draco’s movements, hypnotised. Then he snapped back to reality as he realised he was about to come, so he held onto Draco’s back and manoeuvred them so Draco was on his back again, Harry above him.
In response, Harry pushed all three fingers back inside him, thrusting them. Malfoy was beside himself in pleasure; he grabbed the bedsheet and moaned, and when he’d caught his breath, all he could say was:
