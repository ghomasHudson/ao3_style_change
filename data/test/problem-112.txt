time.”
“I’m really, really not,” said Harry.
“All your idea, Haz,” she assured him. "Luna went to spend the night with Rolf, and you said to come over, that it would be like old times. Ron turned absolutely green, it was hilarious.”
“Pure force of charisma,” Draco said cheerfully. “All learned from you, I’m sure.”
He looked up and couldn’t believe his eyes. For the first time since he had turned eighteen, Harry was looking into the splotchy purple face of his uncle Vernon.
“I’m a squid,” Harry informed him.
It is very rude of you to imply that I am in any way in agreement with a Weasley. Consider my protective instinct revoked.
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry for the infrequency and unpredictability of my updates.  Work and mental illness are a bitch.  Thank you to my returning readers for your forbearance.
“Can they remove cat hair?” Amy asked hopefully.
“Never mind.”
That hadn’t been so long ago--a few years, time in which Draco hadn’t changed much. And he still hadn’t really changed. He still loved Tom. The only difference was, he was beginning to hate him now, too. And that hatred was beginning to chip away at his fear. That was probably Harry’s influence--or maybe Draco had simply had enough. So he let the truth out.
are you mortal?” she asked Sirius.
“Well,” said Draco after setting down his glass, “now that we’ve established our mutual disdain, shall we begin?”
me,” Tom repeated slowly and clearly. “We both knew I was using you, and you let me. Are we clear now? Can we move on?”
Strangely—perhaps unreasonably—Harry hadn’t been angry at Ginny for outing him to his family. That wasn’t what set him off.
“What?” Harry demanded acidly.
“At least let me take you to dinner.”
“Interesting,” said Draco, following Theo to an out-of-the-way elevator. “Rather the opposite of the arrangement between my father and I.”
“No,” said Harry. “Despite my aunt’s constant shouting to the contrary, I’m as normal as they come. Well, except for--wait a minute. Did my aunt know my mum was a--that she could do spells?”
have known. The Muggle families of witches and wizards are always told when they get their Hogwarts letters.” At the blank looks, Draco added, “Oh, Hogwarts is England’s school of witchcraft and wizardry. Everyone with magical talent in the country gets an acceptance letter when they turn eleven.”
Another silence.
. Just this meddling idiot I met.”
Scorpius and his father were about to retire for the night when a silver stag burst through the drawing room wall.
Draco looked to Voldemort for an explanation.
“It’s a rich and varied world. There’s room for Luna’s love of stone-cold weirdos, your obsession with jocks--”
“Have you met you?” he asked. “Why would you rescue a baby Kneazle that was caught in the rain?”
“Of a sort,” said Draco with smarmy false modesty. “Anyway, around the time we were all tadpoles, there was a war. A Dark wizard called Voldemort was trying to take over.”
“I...what?”
Draco groaned, but followed Theo through a long room lined with rat cages willingly enough. The rats were sad-looking things, slender, albino, most of them huddled tearfully in corners. Draco made the mistake of making eye contact with one, and cringed.
“It--yeah--” Sirius grimaced. “Can I hug you?”
“Nothing personal,” Draco sighed to himself as he dropped his phone on the glass coffee table and collapsed onto his stylishly hostile sofa.
I’m free to talk now, if you like.
Enjoy the entrance of Pansy.
“Just don’t do it again,” said Luna in a surprisingly stern voice.
“GROSS,” said Lily pointedly.
“You’re right,” he said.
,” Al corrected his father.
. He stopped dead, spun in a frustrated circle, kicked a brick wall, and then started to run toward Amy’s place with one sore foot.
Draco merely responded with a wolfish grin.
“I’m a what?”
To: Draco Malfoy
“To recap,” Draco said, looking up, “you have been welcomed back into the Weasley family by your bitch of an adoptive mother”—
“WE MADE BISCUITS!” Victoire had a formidable shriek. She released Harry and ran giggling back to the kitchen. Harry followed slowly.
“Oh no.”
Sorry for the long wait on this one.  It's the magic of depression!  I've had this one for a while, but didn't want to put it up till I knew where I was going next, in case of changes.  Now, with the next chapter almost complete, we are ready to proceed.  This one's a bit short, and the next one's a bit long, but I like to think they're both satisfying in their own way.
him.”
Malfoy--Draco--who had looked him in the eye and said, “Not without negotiating first. For now, you’ll just have to control yourself.” Then his expression had shown a flash of uncharacteristic self-consciousness. “Er, if that’s what you want?”
“I’m not going to
“I played you. I strung you along for my own selfish purposes. You were my friend--
“Different kind of spell,” said Draco.
“More tea?” he requested of Sirius, silently begging him for a distraction. And Sirius, bless him, caught on easily enough.
Well, one, anyway. Granger.
And they were right back around to it.
,” Harry spat.
“Apparently I can. Like this.
“And that was your aunt?” Draco nodded. “Good to know I’m not the only one, I suppose,” Harry said.
what’s wrong
“Have a seat,” said Sirius, waving his hand broadly. Draco settled himself on what proved to be a pale grey canvas settee.
Harry snorted.
Voldemort gestured with his hand, as if to say, “all right, I will.” Draco went on.
“I honestly can’t tell whether you’re joking.”
Harry stared at him, and Draco stared right back. He’d felt so lost these weeks, and he’d done so many things that were alien to him, especially in the last few days. Stood up to Tom. Questioned right and wrong. Researched a business venture of his own volition.
Harry had no problem at all withdrawing a sack of Wizarding coin from the French goblin bank (and, God, his life certainly had taken a turn in the past twenty-four hours). His curiously light new coin purse contained what Draco had assured him would be “sufficient” funds, and while he still didn’t fully understand Wizarding money, Harry was fairly sure he now held in his hands more money than he had ever had in his Muggle bank account at one time. Draco led him and Amy out of the bank through a bustling reception area and onto a crowded street.
“Not true,” Draco responded instantly.
“Well, I married one.”
“Honestly, Ronald,” Hermione sighed. “You needn’t think like a policeman
“No,” Harry agreed. Draco gestured for Harry to hand over his coat, then hung it in the hall closet. He went to a marble-topped bar cart that rested against the wall.
“I went to Molly,” said Harry. “I thought about it for a while, talked to—well, just about everyone I know. Until I’d worked out what I needed to say to her.”
Harry noticed how Draco stumbled over the name, and it gave him the shivers. As ludicrous as this all sounded, he could tell Draco was deadly serious about it.
“Hold on, love. Let me just go tell whoever it is to bugger off, then you can finish your story.” Amy patted Harry’s knee, then went to the intercom.
“I don’t know,” said Harry, “but trust me, Draco. You don’t want him like that. You don’t want to pay that price.”
HP: fake concern
“You put the only copy of a picture of your sainted parents in a locket you were borrowing from your
Harry had nothing to say to that, so he stayed silent. He and Draco stared challengingly at each other until the oysters came. Draco showed Harry how to eat them, and soon Harry had the first bite in his mouth and Draco had an odd look on his face.
“Ah,” said Amy wisely, “this is about the rent thing.”
“Well then, you have a neat lesson on why some wizards hate Muggles.”
“I don’t know,” said Harry. “Maybe this is what it takes for him to finally--”
“They were.” Draco agreed. “And they were enough of a problem for him that Voldemort went after them himself. He killed them, Harry. And, as far as my world is aware, he killed you as well.”
“You’re clearly upset,” said Amy gently, “and you’ve been drinking tequila, so I’ll tell him to bugger off, at least till--”
Draco was interrupted by Amy’s slowly rising hysterical laughter. Harry simply sat back, looking gobsmacked.
“Show me your bedroom, love?” he demanded of Harry.
“I’ll see you in half an hour, then,” said his father, and left for his dressing room.
“Some of it, at least. She’d have had to.”
“Harry,” said Aberforth, “answer me this. I won’t pretend it en’t a pointed question, you’ll see it from a mile off, but answer me honestly as you can. Your Malfoy lad. He ever use you for his own gain?”
Scorpius wracked his brains. Who could his father possibly be seeing that would be affected by his relationship with Al? It was a conundrum, a paradox, a bafflement.
“Not with me,” said Mr. Chatwal, “but he left this for you, just a moment…ah!” He dug in his desk drawer and pulled out an envelope, handing it to Harry.
,” said Ginny stubbornly.
There was a young man shouting encouragements; Arthur could only see his dark hair and infer his small stature. Turning his head, he saw two other guests, about Ron or Ginny’s age, one of them a girl holding a gigantic cat, and the other--
“Too late, I’m afraid,” said Draco. “Arthur flooed while you two were having your heart-to-heart. Potterwatch wants us at Headquarters. Eleven o’clock.”
“Yeah, we’re not like that,” Harry mumbled, curling up with his nose against Lump’s forehead and reaching for Amy’s hand. “Both bottoms.”
“Yeah.”
“I’m starting to think I’ll never get my chance to just be normal, y’know? Read about someone else’s life in the newspaper...plan out names for my future children...have somebody I like buy me jewelry...that sort of thing.”
“Anyway,” said Mr. Potter, “I just wanted to let you know, Scorpius, that you’re welcome to our house any time you want to visit Al.”
Ginny drained her cup. “Tom’s a bastard. I’m sorry he ever got near you, and, when you put it that way, I guess I feel sorry for Malfoy, too. I’m glad you two fucked it out.”
“Not just that, though I still think I’m right and you’re wrong.”
Harry grinned to see Draco getting along so well. After all, if he was going to join the family, he’d have to get used to the chaos.
“It is my vocation,” Voldemort agreed solemnly.
“Will he?” wondered a raspy Scottish voice from the shadows. There were footsteps, and a face emerged. Draco barely restrained his shock. With her tight bun, tweed suit, rigid posture, and strong accent, this woman could be Professor McGonagall’s maiden aunt.
“Have you heard anything from him?” Ginny asked when they were finished, “Your ferret-in-shining-armor?”
“Splendid,” said Sirius. “Does Amy eat eggs?”
“How d’you figure?” said Harry, confused.
“You doubt my charms, My Lord?” Draco asked neutrally. Voldemort looked him up and down, which, Draco thought, felt very much like the time he had been wanking in the Slytherin dorms only to look out the window and find the Giant Squid watching.
Lucius gets involved.
“What?” said Draco, taken aback. “Why? You don’t like me.”
“Lads,” said Amy. “D’you think you can geek out later? Maybe wizards live differently, but me and Harry need to eat sometime tonight.”
“The Khan case file is almost ready for review,” Harry told him hurriedly. “I’ll be in early tomorrow, I swear. It’ll be in your desk by the time you’re in the office.”
“Pardon my asking,” said Rose, looking up from the glass of wine she’d stolen from her father, “but won’t this be a bit awkward? At least with the press? You know, all in the family and such?” she raised a positively Malfoyesque eyebrow.
“So he is,” said Harry.
“Well, this takes me back.”
Ah. Thanks, but I rather fancy a walk today.”
“Forgive me, I’m not terribly experienced with these things,” said the blond. “When one works...that workday does
“And what would you do? If your family...”
Harry swallowed. “Actually, I have something I want to talk to you about.” He paused, then added, “But...yeah, I mean. That--wouldn’t be bad.”
it is exactly that they’re testing. Granger would have a better chance of parsing the language and telling us exactly what it does.”
?” said Draco.
“Then get it off,” said Harry.
“Tom brought me coffee.”
Harry snorted. “We’re not quite at the point where he’s openly complimenting me. And if he was, I’d except something more along the lines of--” he cleared his throat and affected a posh accent-- “
And, beyond that, it felt like a betrayal as well. Because he knew he had likely opened Pandora’s box, and that this would end with him firmly pitted against Tom. And all due to his own thoughtlessness, too. All due to his not caring what deal he was making as long as it kept Tom around. He’d never been all that bothered by his own reckless behavior, but it seemed it had finally come back to bite him in the--
” the cupboard announced.
“What?”
Harry did not look up from his plate; he had been staring very fixedly at his leftover sausages for the entirety of the conversation, as Draco’s feet found his under the table and insinuated themselves around his ankles and up his calves.
“And?” Albus squeaked. “Do we know
“I don’t know what you think you’re playing at”--Ron began.
Harry, Draco, and Tom in the same room is never a good look.
By this point Draco had approached one of the goblins and was exchanging words with him in smooth, businesslike French. Amy didn’t say anything, but her wide eyes said to Harry,
Harry needn’t have worried. When he got to work the next morning, he found another email from Draco’s secretary, requesting that he meet Draco again at the same pub the following week.
When Draco emerged from the records room, it was late, the time of night when he was usually about two and a half sheets to the wind (or--and he’d kill anyone who witnessed this--curled up with a mug of tea and a cashmere blanket, watching a Monty Don gardening show). Dr. Pince had seemed unbothered by the late hour. Draco wondered if she slept here--or, come to that, if she slept at all. She seemed perfectly alert, and had continued to watch Draco like a hawk until he closed the door behind him.
“Better to keep a clear head, don’t you think?” Tom said, and began to slide the drink away from Harry. Harry let his hand fall out from under Tom’s, quickly moving it out of his reach when he could.
“Cute, aren’t they?” Sirius fished.
There was a silence as the two stared at each other from their opposite seats, taking in the enormity of what they had just agreed to. No longer could the whole of it be played off as temporary insanity, or as a hazy dream-come-true. It was real now. It was permanent.
And that...Harry was like to drown in the undertow of that memory.
“Huh.” Ron crooked a Weasley eyebrow, which in its bright orange text carried none of the dry criticism Hermione could convey without a word.
“I’m leaving now,” Ginny added, grabbing her wallet and keys from the little table by the door.
“You will.”
, that’s why.”
“Ginny yes,” said Ginny.
“You’ve said.”
“There’s a reason we call it firewhisky,” said Draco drily.
“I…” Harry wanted to deny it, but found he couldn’t. “Thanks.”
And then, incredibly, both of them were laughing. Laughing until they couldn’t breathe. Laughing until their terror shriveled, at least for the moment.
Harry sighed, defeated. “All right. Though I don’t know what’s your neighborhood pub.”
“I’ll teach it to you,” said Sirius throatily.
Sorry about the chapter title. I don’t know how I thought I’d be able to come up with an airtight communist pun every time tbh
“Watch and learn,” said Draco, because he and Blaise had just reached the entrance of the Great Hall, and his plan was about to go into action.
“Oh my,” said Amy, pouring out healthy measures of tequila into two cracked mugs. She handed Harry the “friends of the library” mug and kept for herself the one that pictured Happy Bunny in a strait-jacket.
“We Slytherins tend to hedge our bets.” They returned to the sitting area to find Arthur had busied himself with preparing a fresh pot of tea. Quietly, the three wizards settled in for a long night.
.” When Draco spoke the spell, Harry found himself slamming into the other boy all over again, chest to chest.
Ginny shook her head. “You’re too good, Haz.”
“It was a collar,” he said after a moment. “A sign of ownership.”
“Oh, not equally,” said Scorpius with conviction.
been speaking, Dad.”
, Hermione?” Harry was not going to cry. He was not.
To: Draco Malfoy
“I have a few guesses,” said Draco.
Mr. Chatwal’s eyes widened. “You mean you don’t know?”
“Lord Toffington,” Amy echoed, taking a gulp of tequila to quiet her laughter. This led to some choking and spluttering before Harry was able to continue.
All of that was new and terrifying. But staring at Harry Potter was a pleasantly familiar occupation.
“They can’t hold out on you forever,” Draco said. “Nobody could resist your ‘poor-little-savior’ act.”
“I’ll go,” said Neville, and he left the table.
“Hermione,” Ron warned gently, “You sound like my mum.”
RGW: he say anything?
“This is a tequila problem,” Harry replied.
Did you just use an exclamation?
“Harry, I couldn’t--”
, of course,” said Draco. “You’re the heir to two of the biggest fortunes in Wizarding England.”
“What were you saying?”
“Ouch.”
The boys are back in town, and by "the boys" I mean me. Welcome to another chapter of rapidly escalating socialist nonsense. So glad you could be here for it.
“Do you have the notes with you?” Hermione demanded.
Sirius frowned. “I didn’t know it did that.”
But there would be wine.
He was late, the bastard. Probably wanted to give Harry time to squirm. Well, fuck him. Harry swigged his drink and ordered another. Harry was just wondering if Draco had actually been planning to drive him to drink, when the man himself walked in, still immaculate in his slate grey business suit. He nodded to the bartender, said, “usual,” and then gestured to Harry to follow him to a booth in the corner. Harry, who had not yet received his second drink, glanced at the bartender, who waved him away. This, he supposed, was the way one behaved when they were actually raised with their wealth on hand. He supposed the bartender would bring their drinks to them. How horrible.
"Yeah, you definitely need to see Hermione. That’s what I always do when I feel that way.”
“No,” said Harry. “Decidedly not.”
“Well,” said Hermione when he had finished, “one thing is clear, at least.”
her refusing to look up from her book. “Where is he?”
“--but it’s Tom’s family fucking
Harry meets Sirius.
How Doeth Thou This Eve?
“Right.” Draco shifted in his seat, a rare show of discomfort. “It’s like this...yesterday I was accosted by Riddle’s associate, Pettigrew. He’d got wind of my, er, association with Harry and was trying to threaten me into stopping it. He made ominous hints as to the nature of a collaboration between Death Eater Pharmaceuticals and the old Malfoy Corp, which I had advanced but not particularly understood some time ago for...personal reasons. Tom reasons. Apparently, according to Pettigrew, having a social worker sniffing around the place could be bad for both companies. Well, I may be a decadent aristo parasite, but I’m not a
Draco waved the concern away. “I have a few million in trust from my mother’s side of the family,” he said. “I haven’t touched it, since I’m saving it for when Father finally cuts me loose.”
“Actually,” Harry continued, "I haven't seen any proof you

,” said Draco with a small smile. “This is the heart of Wizarding Paris.”
“But, Harry.” Neville stared him down, with what Harry had come to recognize as his professor stare. “You do need to talk to her. Even if it’s just to tell her you’re not backing down—which I hope you won’t. Nothing good comes of going in circles round this.”
“We can do this.”
“Blue,” Harry repeated.
The train pulled into the station. Scorpius grabbed Al’s hand and squeezed.
“They what?”
“All right.”
you enough.”
“Er, yeah,” said Harry, “that’s the theory.”
“Draco. What do you want?”
“How would you know?” Draco asked, looking at Pettigrew with distantly disgusted interest.
“I asked for information.”
“I’m sorry.”
Harry didn’t need to be looking at Tom to see his eyes flash, to see the way his lips tightened in warning to Draco. He knew that, if he played it right, he could allow Draco to distract Tom until Harry was able to make his escape. He also knew that he didn’t want to do that to Draco. But what were his other options? Would he even be able to act with this malignant presence looming over him, with his throat choked with rage and fear? Harry had never been a coward. He was Harry Potter. It was known across London that a home visit from Harry Potter meant a child in safe hands and an abusive guardian jailed. A magazine local to his own neighborhood had dubbed Harry the “Defender of London’s Innocent.” Well, Draco was hardly innocent, but that was the thing about Harry. He’d defend pretty much anyone. It was the principle of the thing; abuse wouldn’t be allowed to stand. He couldn’t let it, couldn’t let himself be like his primary school teachers or even Uncle Albus. And so Harry swallowed hard, and tried to convince himself he could handle Tom.
“Those things’ll kill you,” said a voice from the shadows, “not that I’d mind much.”
“But,” Neville continued, “if Gran had kicked up a fuss about my marrying Hannah, I reckon I would have told her to go to Hell. It’s not Gran’s decision. I’m the one who’s got to live with her.”
“So where were you?” Hermione asked. “We stopped by your office at lunch, and Kingsley said you’d come in feeling poorly and he’d sent you home.”
“Rebirth?” said Harry, brow furrowed.
And now? Well, all of those things still applied, but they weren’t of much use. These circles of fruitless research reminded him of nothing so much as the swimming lessons Hermione had given him during the fiasco with the inter-school triathlon. For weeks he’d fumbled about the shallows, gasping, feeling as though he’d better befriend the bottom of the lake sooner rather than later.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’ve been busy with--well, you know what with! But we can argue later, if that’s what you want to do. I just wanted to ask if you’d meet me at mine tonight.”
in it.”
Scorpius’ dad was waiting with Mr. Potter and the Granger-Weasleys. Scorpius and Al followed Rose, Hugo, and Lily over to them, trying to look as though they had nothing particularly important on their minds. Judging by the way his father raised his eyebrows when their eyes met, Scorpius was failing miserably. But his father pulled him into a restrained, one-armed “we are in public” hug, and Scorpius leaned into him. He would miss Al, and he was afraid to tell his father about them, but it would be nice to be home for a while. He took in the clean, sophisticated scent of his father’s cologne, a reminder of the luxuries of the Manor and his father’s soothing company. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad.
Her frown deepened. “It’s been done before, of course. It’s certainly illegal, but there are a lot of ways a slippery group with sufficient funds can escape charges. I’m not sure of the wisest way to proceed.”
“Well, I’ve really only got Gran, and she loves Hannah. ‘The magically competent child she never had,’ as she puts it. And I get along with Hannah’s parents too. It makes things easy.”
“Well, then, Mr. Potter, do sit.” Silvertooth waved her hand, and three chairs appeared. Harry noticed her claws were covered in what appeared to be real gold leaf.
“Well, no, that would be the English branch,” said Draco, “but I’m sure the goblins here would have no problem letting you borrow against it.” With that, he led them forward.
“Pleased to make your acquaintance,” Draco responded with great formality. They looked into each other’s eyes, sharing a moment of deep connection, then broke off simultaneously, Hari giving an awkward laugh.
Aberforth raised his eyebrows. “Was it his idea?”
“You hoped we would love you more than we hate him,” Hermione supplied.
sink in.
“Yeah,” Amy agreed, “and it makes you into a filthy slut.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Magic,” said Draco tersely, before turning back to the door, which he had been fiddling with.
“I see.” Harry gritted his teeth. “That was badly done, Lord Malfoy. You should have listened to your wife.”
“No,” Voldemort admitted, “But what about Potter?”
“Let me get this straight,” said Scorpius after taking a moment to recover. “You’re dating again—thanks ever so for warning me, by the by—and you have since making this momentous decision entered into a relationship serious enough to merit discussion with your beloved son,
Harry flushed. “Sorry, it’s just--I’ve never had anything like this before. Sorry.”
Draco shrugged. “Manor’s got two barns,” he said through a mouthful of pastry. Pansy snorted.
“Ah.” Harry reached over toward Amy to scratch between Lump’s ears. The unflappable cat was half-asleep in her arms, purring lightly. An awkward silence settled as they waited for Silvertooth to return.
“Harry dear, there you are, so pleased you’re home, we need to speak. D’you know what I found in the sink today? Dishes.
me you smoked inside your own flat, but I didn’t believe it until now.”
“So I’m sorry,” said Ron. “I’m sorry, because maybe I should have let you go then. But I didn’t. And now it’s too late. You’re stuck with us.”
“I understand why you are reluctant to believe me,” said Draco, “but my intention was not to insult you or to make trouble for you. Nor, even, to pay you to date me.”
HGW: I’m sorry. What’s happened?
have muscle,” Harry grumbled.
Amy snorted. “
. And that person is Harry Potter.”
“‘We’ is...oh, Circe. We’re going to need more drinks. Come back to mine and I’ll explain it all.”
“Granger,” Draco greeted. “Decent of you to be here. Sorry I was a racist prick to you in school. I’ve recently come to the realization that personal growth isn’t only for the middle classes, and I owe you my first apology.” He turned to Ron and nodded. “Weasley.”
“What the fuck,” said Amy. “How did you…?”
Draco had begun comportment lessons at the age of four, and had been practicing emotional repression since birth. Thus, he did not splutter. Pettigrew seemed to be imagining the splutter nonetheless. He drained his coffee blissfully, set it down with a smile, and left without paying.
“Honestly, Harry,” Amy huffed. “He knows where I live because I
Draco looked down and bit back a grin. “Of course, Headmaster.”
“He was just trying to be polite,” said Draco, “but I decided there was no need for that, as the courtesy was not returned.”
“Scorpius,” said his father before the younger Malfoy could sally forth, “There’s something I wanted to discuss with you.”
“’S my name,” Harry tried to joke.
“No you wouldn’t’ve,” said Amy.
“You’re--do you have
“Exactly.”
Draco nodded. “And balance.”
“I still don’t get why I can’t see it,” Amy protested.
Yeah, I'm still alive. It's been a rough year, friends and nemeses. I'm suffering from a temporary disability that limits my reading and writing time. Readers of 'The Locket' will be either pleased or exasperated to know that story isn't abandoned, either. It will just take time.
sorry he’s doing this, though,” she insisted. “You deserve better, Harry. You’re so
His father chuckled. “Nothing of the sort. I only wanted to tell you that I’m seeing someone as well.”
Finally, Hermione closed the file and looked up. Right at Harry.
“I did no such thing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“True, but I like the way it kills the whole world.” Harry took another swallow, then laughed a bitter laugh. “And to think, an hour ago I was drinking wine that was probably worth a week’s pay.”
“I buy them in bulk at Primark,” said Harry.
“Yes,” said Mr. Chatwal. “And, Harold?”
“Pretty much fucking everything,” Harry realized as he said it aloud.
“I don’t get it,” Harry said at last. “Why’d you come up to me in the first place?”
“Ah, you know her,” said Harry. “Yeah, she didn’t exactly go out of her way to educate me on my heritage. If she had, I think her husband’s fists would have fallen on
“What is it then?” Albus asked, nudging at his half-eaten cake with his fork.
“Are you blackmailing me?” asked Harry, astonished.
“It’s—
“My friends,” he said ponderously, “are telling me you and I should Talk.”
“What did you do, then,” asked Hari, “is there a spell for that?”
“So, Trog cornered Fang.”
“I just... I don’t know what I’m going to do. How I’m going to get through this, or escape or...whatever it is that’s done. I feel like he’ll be at my back forever.”
Harry finally looked up. “He’s going to hurt you, too.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment.
“Mama, tell me he’s exaggerating.”
Hermione elbowed Ron, who winced. Harry looked at his four friends’ inquisitive faces. He took a moment to flirt with the idea of not telling them, but he’d never get away with that. And, if he was honest with himself, he needed their help.
“Don’t be absurd,” said Draco. “I did this so you wouldn’t suffer from my actions.”
“Nobody wears pleats,” Harry grumbled, but he shrugged his thanks anyway, and they went on their way again. Harry followed easily enough as Draco turned into a little alcove that had a nondescript wooden door in it. Amy, however, stopped walking.

“Second!” Harry protested.
“...get
Draco smiled, but didn’t respond. Instead, he held out his hand.
“Both plans achieved,” said the stag. “Will floo over after breakfast. Much to discuss. Potters send love.” Then the creature vanished.
In his surprise, Draco dropped his mask for a moment. Harry had to admit that, when he relaxed slightly, Draco was beautiful. With mussed hair and a sleepy smile, he would be something astonishing to behold. He wondered, vaguely, if Tom understood the value of what he was throwing away by treating Draco as he did.
“All right,” said Harry dryly, “then what was it?”
every time you take a bite! It’s indecent!”
“Do I?” Amy perked up. “Is she single?”
“Right, here’s my card; let me write down my email…”
“I’m honored to be here, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said. He clasped her hand in both of his, and Harry watched her notice the ring. Her eyes flickered to him before she fixed her attention back on Draco.
“Explains a lot,” said Draco.
“Like I said...I’m not entirely sure. A lot of it went over my head. But, Harry, there’s something wrong about this collaboration. I think...well, it seems pretty likely that people are being hurt. The test subjects--the neighborhoods--well, I don’t think you’ll like the patterns. And I’m not sure
“I told you, Harry. Wizards.”
I hope this update amuses and edifies, and that it stands in as a token of my affection for you all, which is no less sincere for being so flighty.
“He’s just the most obnoxious, arrogant, hateful git I’ve ever had the misfortune to meet.”
people who like both.”
“Harry,” he greeted. “Summited a new peak of desperation, have we?”
Harry fixed him with an intense look.
“Perhaps,” said Draco, “but now I know for certain you will be.”
. D’you have to do everything the Muggle way? You know, you can just cast a cleaning charm and—oh.” Draco had finally come into the parlor from the hallway, and he saw the look on Harry’s face. “Bad talk?”
*dost
“I did think you liked Draco, at least,” said Harry weakly.
“S’pose I’ll find out tonight,” said Harry glumly.
killed for trying to kick him.
“What are you nattering on about, wench?” Draco asked, still trying to recover his breath.
“Now, on to the matter at hand.” Dumbledore pulled out a box of pensieve memories and began to lecture Harry about the life of a young Tom Riddle. And Harry certainly didn’t spare any further thought that evening for Draco Malfoy and his surprisingly agile feet. No, not a thought.
“Begin what?” Harry asked. He couldn’t help it--through his resentment, he was amused. It was so satisfying to see Draco out of his element, overpriced pub aside.
“Is that Sanskrit?” he asked.
might end up being the one to piece together the information for such a list.
“Thanks, Mr. Potter.”
And now, he supposed, he had another ambition to hide: the ambition to have repeated liaisons with a man who, he was absolutely
“That...doesn’t sound particularly scary, if I’m being honest, Haz.” Harry frowned at her. “If I’m being honest,” she continued, “it sounds kind of hot.”
“Don’t play dumb!” Harry exclaimed. “You offered to pay me to go on a date with you. What did you think you were doing?”
He didn’t know how long he’d been sobbing; he only realized he’d been doing it when Draco began to make quiet, soothing shushing noises. Harry sniffled and looked up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait,” said George again.
Draco shrugged. “It’s possible you were born a Squib--that is, someone with Wizarding parents who has no magic himself. Or…” Draco’s eyes lit up. “Or, whatever it is you did to cause the Dark Lord’s curse to backfire stripped you of the magical power you were born with.”
you didn’t want to date him,” said Amy to Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “sure. I do.”
“Hold on.” Harry hauled himself up and went to hug Ginny. “Thanks.”
“Ron, I’m not just going to barge in on your mum.”
Harry took a gulp of his drink and continued. “I lie awake thinking about it. What would it take for Tom to be out of my life? A restraining order wouldn’t do it. He’s too slippery for that. Maybe if he seriously hurts someone and goes to prison. But he’s so cautious. How do I lose him? London’s a big place, but people know me. They notice where I go. They’d notice if I left. I wonder, sometimes, if I’ll never be free of him, not until he finally kills me. Sometimes I wish he’d just get it overwith, truth be told.”
“Yes, well.” Pettigrew slurped his coffee, apparently trying to increase the drama of the moment. “As you know, the research interests of the Malfoy Corporation and of Death Eater Pharmaceuticals are closely tied. A mutually beneficial state of affairs.”
“Have you
George emerged from the stockroom behind him, looking dusty and concerned.
“I can’t. What did you do?”
“Just a mo.” Draco tapped his phone a few times and had a brief conversation. He looked at Harry after hanging up. “It’ll be fifteen minutes,” he said.
It was only hours later, when he had stomped back to his own flat and brooded for some time, that Harry realized he’d left the photo behind. He cursed aloud and started pacing.
“Oh Harry.”
“Ron, listen. I know things aren’t going to...go back to how they were. Of course. They couldn’t. But...I want my family back.”
“It’s so
“What I’m sorry for.” Here he almost looked Harry in the eye. “Back--then. In the battle. When we thought you were gone. It hurt more than anything. Anything, Harry, even--even Fred. I’m sorry. It’s true though. And even in all that pain, part of me knew. Part of me was happy for you, that you were with them. That you got to rest.”
“Right,” said Sirius, and turned to his guests. “Well--this is Amy.”
She huffed, creating a loud crackle of feedback on the line. “You as good as told Riddle we have something on him.”
“I’d like to have sex, too,” Harry added as an afterthought. “That's something I haven't done.  I'd like to try it.  Preferably as many times as possible, before old Snakeface gets me.”
After a long moment, Narcissa cleared her throat. “If you’re both quite finished.” Both men looked at the floor sheepishly. “There is the small matter of how to go on from here.”
“But it’s diff--”
“You can thank me any time,” said Draco after a moment.
“Good boy.” Draco unbuttoned a few of the buttons on Harry’s shirt, lightly stroking the skin there. But they were still in the entranceway of Harry’s flat, and that wouldn’t do.
“I didn’t think it was until you said so.”
“Well,” he said, “Well. Let’s get you upstairs before I start weeping in front of the patrons, yeah?”
Finally the queue dispersed, and Harry took a step back, closed his eyes for a moment, and breathed. Then he looked over his shoulder at his friend Amy, who was leaning over the counter between the kitchen and the till area. He opened his mouth to comment on the strange interaction he’d had with that blond man, but Amy just raised her eyebrows and jerked her head toward the till counter. Harry turned around to find the blond standing there again.
, but Father seems the type to have scientists.”
in that gaze, the ease with which he could turn Harry away.
so,” Harry replied.
HP: brought me coffee
Draco shrugged. “Can I take pictures with my phone?”
“I know how you feel,” said Harry. “I wish you’d believe that. I’ve been where you want to go, and I can tell you--it’ll never be enough. He’ll never
Sirius cocked his head. “Muggleborn?”
Draco was barely containing a smirk. Tom hadn’t called him by his surname in years. Almost as soon as they’d met, he’d started calling him Draco, with a casual intimacy that spoke of ownership. Draco hadn’t found it grating at the time, but somehow the name “Malfoy” on Tom’s lips sounded right and proper now.
“You have yet to explain what ‘it’ is,” Harry pointed out.
“Harry?” said Amy, “Are you all right?”
“As I thought. Then I reiterate my question. What time are you off?”
“What is it?”
“No,” said Harry with a quirk of his eyebrow, “I rather figured two world wars had been enough for Britain.”
“I could have transferred it,” Dennis muttered as Harry followed him to the reception desk. Shooing Dennis away, he picked up the phone.
How wonderfully appropriate.
A smile was creeping onto Harry’s face before he could stop it. “You’ve met him. That just might work. Stun him temporarily, at least.”
“I’m being perfectly honest. Of course, some conversation and a night or two spent fucking you until you lose your voice from screaming my name would be nice too, but really, seeing you well set up would be its own reward.”
“Scorpius,” said his father admonishingly, “heterosexual boys generally don’t perform wedding ceremonies between their toy Aurors and their toy pirates.”
“Dad!”
“This woman sounds terrifying,” said Harry. “Are all secretaries this terrifying?”
“Honestly,” said Ginny, sitting back, “this is a lot more thinking than I expected to do on this visit. I won’t tell you to be careful, because you have Hermione for that. But yeah. I think there’s a chance. As long as you’re both willing to admit that you’re idiots.”
“I can tell you’re very upset, so I will ignore that psychologically revealing cheap shot.”
, Potter, I will. It’s clear you need rest but are terrified to walk home.”
“The conversation we had when we were thirteen,” said Pansy, and walked out the door.
Draco made the call to Mr. Dobbs, his driver, while Pansy reapplied her lipstick in the mirror over his bar cart. Before leaving, she stopped and cocked her head.
Harry settled back into bed, upright this time, and called him.
looking even remotely attractive.”
To this, Draco received an almost immediate response.
At that point, Amy was calm enough that Harry could turn his attention back to them.
“True enough,” Draco agreed amiably. “It’s my father’s finest firewhisky. You can’t conjure food or drink, but you can Summon it into a different container. It’s Gamp’s Third Law of Transfiguration.” Draco sniffed poshly. “We don’t keep tequila in the Manor.”
, he thought to himself as he got to work on those trousers,
“Do you mean to say you’re a
“Industrious. How quaint. And when, pray tell, does your workman’s odyssey end?”
A heavy sigh, and Harry girded his loins. He’d have to face these strangers, and this strange world, again at some point. Might as well be now.
“Wormtail,” said Voldemort coldly, “do you disagree with the young man?”
“Traitor! Fuck, I need to get out of here. And possibly out of town. Do you think Sweden is accepting immigrants? I could be Swedish.”
“Well,” said Harry thoughtfully, “You never know. My mind could change. Maybe if I met the right person, I’d want them to buy me jewelry.”
“Rather not,” Draco agreed. “Truth be told, I’ve no idea how she tracked me. I don’t see her doing legwork in the Muggle world, nor her minions. I haven’t the contacts to discover whether the Dark Lord might have created some new method of tracking.”
think this is a Death Eater plot?”
“At your convenience, Lord Malfoy,” he responded with the transparent sarcasm Draco said marked him as incapable of true refinement.
The response was almost immediate, confirming Harry’s suspicion that Draco wasn’t getting any work done today, either. But then, Harry wasn’t quite sure if Draco
“‘S good food,” Harry said when he was finished.
, Harry told himself firmly. Because he was
“Wait,” said Ron.
“I am sorry,” she said.
“Hello Harry,” she said, “what are your plans for Christmas?”
Harry mewled, and they were both lost, adrift in a universe an inch to the left of their home. They let the heady air take them, leaving behind the scurf of sewers and wretched corners, the grime of decades between worn bricks, overtaking rooftops stained with centuries’ soot. They found a place, in that clear air, where darkness could not reach them; nor could they reach anything but each other.
“Are those
“Make me, Malfoy.”
Thanks for reading!
“Of course not,” said Draco, appearing genuinely surprised at the accusation. “Why ever would I do that?”
, that’s awful.”
“Uh, yeah, that’s the thing.” Dennis was talking even faster than usual; nervous, then. “The guy on the phone claims to be Lucius Malfoy? That’s why I’m checking with you first. Didn’t want to forward it if it was just some nutter, you know?”
“In the locket,” Draco said blankly.
“You really
“Who’s there?” Draco demanded, alarmed. Once his eyes fell on the fireplace, he relaxed infinitesimally. “Arthur.”
“Hmph,” said Dr. Pince. But she started to gather boxes.
“Yeah. As much as I hate to humor you, that’s actually relevant.”
“I’m afraid I’ve no idea who you mean,” Draco admitted at last, “but if you inform me, I’m sure the Concern can be addressed.”
“Hermione.”
“And remember, please, if you will, that I’m your only son and heir. Just, remember that before you react.”
“I could ask the same of you...Harry.”
“Good job,” Harry said, tipping his wine glass sarcastically.
“You never wear it,” Draco said with apparent surprise.
“Hello, love. What’s the matter? Is this gentleman giving you trouble?” Draco’s voice was posh and ice cold.
“Oh,” said Sirius, deflating. “Harry, your grandparents were Hindu, and your dad, and your mum converted when she married in. The last time I saw you…”
“I’m not a 'boy,'” said Harry viciously, “and I’m not pretty. What I am is tired, and probably homeless now, too, thanks to you. Please leave me alone.”
SCOURGIFY
“Scorpius,” he said cheerfully, “it’s good to see you as well. Your father tells me you’ve been excelling in classes this term.”
,” she announced.
“Draco.”
“Are you sure the stars are right for this?” Harry joked.
“We slipped them Canary Creams and hid their wands on the other side of a yard mined with dung bombs while they were distracted,” said Arthur, smiling softly at the memory. “Gave them a taste of their own potions.”
“True,” said Harry, “But in this we’re friends. Or...comrades of a sort, at least. I’ll admit there are things we did in school I’m reluctant to forgive you for, and I’m sure it’s the same for you. But we’re in similar positions at the moment. I think we should try not to be enemies.”
“You’ve lost me again.”
With all the sincerity I can muster,
Draco and Harry do not Talk. Narcissa and Draco do.
Draco looked shocked and a bit disapproving. With a sigh, Harry pushed his plate away, but Draco shook his head.
“Come on, Theo. You work too hard. Take a walk with me.”
“Yeah.”
, that was hot.
mushrooms, which meant, of course, that Harry had become quite fond of them. It sounded like a good meal. And Harry wasn’t a person who had had a lot of good meals in his life.
“All right,” said Harry, standing and looking toward the bar, “I’ll get it. What do you want?”
Only, they couldn’t afford the repairs, so he didn’t.
“Of course, yes,” said Draco lazily. “You would, of course, know better about people’s uses than I. You being a Lord and all, or rather,
“No,” Harry agreed. “When I do, everyone always comments on how it brings out my eyes. It’s bloody annoying.”
“That was humiliating to watch,” said Blaise as they sat down in Charms class.
Draco looked to Sirius and translated, “Bellatrix.”
Harry stiffened. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
“I tried to get in touch. Nothing was safe. I’ve just been
“At the
“We’re passing a window,” Lily remarked sourly. The boys immediately stopped and composed themselves. In fact, they restrained themselves to sneaking glances at each other until they stepped off the train.
“Does everyone here drink?” he asked. At the others’ nods, he enchanted the bottle to pour for all of them. With alcohol and good food in front of them, Harry and Amy went quiet and began tucking in as if they’d been living on cheese toasties and cup noodles for years--which, of course, they had. Sirius looked on with concern while Draco tried to distract him with light gossip. This being a time of war, there wasn’t much to be had, and Draco kept trailing off in the middle of stories as he remembered one or more of the participants was now dead. It was so painful that even Harry noticed.
Looking into the hate-filled faces of the man and woman who had supposedly 'raised' him, Harry forgot all the pithy remarks he’d stored up during sleepless nights, the stinging and witty things he’d have liked to say if he ever saw them again. Now that he was in their presence, he couldn’t say a word.
“Ooh, it was kinky?”
“Well,” she said, “well.”
, pup,” said Sirius. “We didn’t know, either. I’m sorry.”
“I thought you were bottoming,” said Ginny.
“It is.”
“And Petunia
“Are you okay, Uncle Harry?” asked Victoire.
For a moment, the prospect tempted Harry. The blond was more than a bit of all right, and Harry was the first to admit he was a slut. It was part of his regimen to purge all Dursleyishness from his new adult life: get his own place, grow his hair long, and be as aggressively homosexual as possible. And he’d never been with someone quite as good-looking, or quite as strange, as the blond in front of him. But it was all a ridiculous fantasy. He had bills to pay.
So Harry turned off the burner, and Sirius shoved him gently aside, pointing his wand at the range.
Harry ran a hand through his hair nervously. “Then let me.”
Draco grinned. “Oh, certainly, Papa. Two failsafes, as a matter of fact.”
“What, just because he came to you and said so? He could be lying. Slytherins are good at that!”
“Er, gay, Father? You know, queer? A homosexual? A shirt-lifter? One of Dumbledore’s lot?”
It wasn’t, yet. But it would be.
“What?”
RGW: dont drink it
“Uncle Harry,” said Victoire, tugging on the hem of his shirt, “Come try a biscuit.”
to say.
“You’ll have to go through me to get to him,” said Draco, annoyed with himself that he meant it.
“I think I will,” said Harry. “I’m getting another pint. Want anything?”
“Yeah.” He sighed. “I know it’s not...healthy to be with someone I don’t fully trust right now. And I think it’s the same for him--I mean, last week he was completely caught up in Tom’s bullshit. It’s all going really fast, and it feels like we can’t control it.”
Well,
Sirius blinked. “Sorry?”
“Salazar is a Crup.”
“Guess what Gramma and I did today.”
Harry snorted. “You’re going to try and convince me this somehow
“Mum already knows, probably,” said Lily.
“Triathlon,” said Draco.
“Those places creep me out. What do they teach you there--how to whack each other with sticks and alienate workers from the means of production? It's a wonder you can even read.”
Harry nodded, and kept nodding. “Yes. Yes, thank you. Yes.”
“I know,” said Draco smugly. “Harry, meet your new account manager.”
“I should go home,” Harry said.
“Here we are,” said Theo, bringing him around the corner to a heavy, cramped little door straight off Guillermo del Toro’s cutting room floor. When Theo opened the door, Draco was assaulted with a buzzing gray light and a smell of manila.
“I wish you wouldn’t--”
“Don’t suppose it occurred to you to knock on the door and ask.”
“Can’t a man visit an old school chum?” Draco demanded.
“Ginevra hasn’t left Luna, has she?” Draco asked with an edge to his voice.
“Albus,” he said cautiously.
right, and the effects are similar.”
Miracles never cease
“Why do you care?” asked Harry. “You seemed pretty careless before. Why should I think you did this out of some sort of sense of generosity, or even guilt? Not that I’d be okay with it in either of those cases, either.”
but i have to be here for this
Harry has an aftermath to deal with.  Luckily, he has friends to help him.  Perhaps too many friends, but still.
“You don’t mean--” Ron started.
“Pigeon,” he said. “I’m trying a new thing, making pithy comments to passing vermin. It has a sort of maudlin, Cambridgean whimsy to it, don’t you think?”
“Sure,” said Ron after a moment. “Yeah, Harry, let’s talk about this.”
“What?”
Not that there weren’t plenty of other circumstances in which he wouldn’t mind being on his knees in Severus’ office. But those were thoughts for another day. A rainy Sunday, perhaps.
Harry faced down his friend, chin high. What Draco called “sass position.”
“Let him drink if he wants,” said Draco casually. “He’s got no one to annoy with it.”
“Sir,” said the maitre’d, coming up behind him, “I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”
“I’m twenty-five!”
Please answer me, baby. I just need to know that you’re all right.
“Then...what happened? Why does everyone think that? Why--” He cut himself off, but both the others could hear the unasked question.
“Vocation,” said Draco, “Exactly. That’s what I’m here about, My Lord.”
“Or yours,” Mr. Potter sniffed. The two of them stared at each other for a moment. Scorpius and Albus exchanged a worried glance. This would be a bad time for their dads to start fighting again.
not?” Harry asked. “Why are you cooking it then?”
“I just! URGH!” Albus gave the bedframe a tiny kick to let out his impotent rage. “I! Had! Something! To! Tell! You! Too!”
Hesitantly, Harry nodded. Sirius approached cautiously, as if Harry were a horse he was afraid to spook, and the moment his arms wrapped around him, Harry found himself returning the embrace, clinging, shaking a little. Being touch-starved his entire childhood had made Harry incredibly fond of physical affection, but this felt different. It was warm and steady in a way he hadn’t ever really experienced.
I started eating meat. Prove them wrong.”
Hermione blushed. “It’s real.”
Molly, still holding Harry at arm’s length, nodded decisively. “Dinner,” she said, “this Sunday. You’ll bring your young man.”
“Have you really got scientists?” Pansy wondered.
“Good. Hands together, over your head. There’s a love. Feet apart. That’s right. Stay there.”
The woman’s cheeks were bright red with anger. Harry expected her to ask to see the manager, but it was worse than that. Still silent, the woman dug her manicured paw into the tip jar and dug out the two-pound coin she’d previously dropped in.
getting rather late. Well said, cousin.”
“Go home and rest. Stay home through the weekend; you clearly need the break. We’ll see you Monday.”
“I think I need to go to The Burrow for Christmas.”
“Of course not,” said Narcissa placidly.
“It’s not really there, I swear,” Harry assured her.
Well, not
In point of fact, they both ate their bacon. After a silent stretch of breakfast-induced bliss, Ginny took his plate.
Pettigrew smiled filthily. “Is it? I only wanted a word.”
“Well then. The man my brother loved tried, and it was his own idea.”
Scorpius nodded and tried not to look at Al. He was afraid he would betray himself if he did. He just wanted to go home and get his confession to his father overwith.
,” said Draco, “My Harry is a jewel beyond price. You, on the other hand…” Draco looked Vernon up and down. “Well, let’s just say you couldn’t pay
“All right.” Harry went to the bar. When he got back to the table, Hermione had arrived. Harry leaned down and kissed her forehead before sliding back into his own seat.
“Don’t think he ever told him,” Abeforth continued. “Imagine if he did. If they’d been at it like rabbits instead of expending all their energy trying to change the world, a war could have been avoided.”
“I can’t believe I hit Bill,” he’d said.
“What’s Lump?” Draco asked, looking to Harry for elucidation of her odd request.
“No,” said Harry, “that’s not it. I just hate the thought of anyone being in that position. If it had been me...if Draco had been like I was with Tom, and I had been on the outside...I’m not sure I wouldn’t have done the same.”
“Get out, Draco,” Harry said. “Get the fuck out of this while you still can.”
“What about?” asked Harry, nonplussed.
you,” said Ginny. “I’m telling Mum.”
“Past your bedtime,” said Harry.
“Indeed,” said Draco. “I’d like you to come to my pub to collect it, as I don’t fancy risking my neck to visit whatever slum you frequent.”
“Yeah.” Hari stepped away and leaned on the counter again, trying to conceal his tears. Judging by the arm Sirius soon wrapped around his shaking shoulders, it didn’t work.
“Harry was raised in the Muggle world,” Draco informed the goblin. “As far as we can tell, he is a squib--he was able to see the back door, but has never shown any signs of having magic of his own. Until recently, he was entirely ignorant to the existence of the Wizarding world and, therefore, to the existence of his inheritance.”
“Chelsea,” Harry grinned. “I believe it was an entire fifteen minutes’ walk.”
“It was not at all done in the proper way, you realize,” Draco sniffed. “The stars are absolutely wrong for it, you’ve not got me a single courting gift or made a formal declaration of any sort—you’ve not even given me a ring, you bloody peasant.”
“Hello,” said Arthur cheerfully, though he pointed his wand at Sirius. “What was the first thing you said to me after you were released from Azkaban?”
“That sounds like you.”
“You have my attention,” said Voldemort.
“You know what,” said Hari, “I might need a few more hours’ sleep to process that.”
“Here’s what we’re going to do,” he said, low and steady. “I’m going to play with you all I want, and you’re going to stay still. I’m not going to restrain you. You’re just going to stay still for me because you’re so good, because you want to please me, right, pet?”
*Princess Diaries wave*
“Tied up, were you?” Draco snipped, stumbling into his kitchen after Pansy.
“Yeah, that’s the part of me most don’t like. The part that grew up abused and neglected and dreadfully middle-class. The part that struggled to learn to read. The part that got into common physical scraps with the other lordlings at public school. D’you remember that bit in
Suddenly, Harry felt an arm around his shoulders. Draco’s arm.
Silence fell.
“Only polite,” Ron grunted.
He finally caught Harry’s eye, and Harry was too startled to speak.
“Did you.” Draco looked up conspicuously, taking in the winter sun as it limned the city rooftops. “Lovely day. Crisp.”
“I didn’t know I still had a godson,” Sirius replied. And for a moment, they just stared at each other, drinking each other in.
As it is, hope you all enjoy the chapter and are staying safe and masking up.
Scorpius sighed. Better out than in. “Albus Potter.”
Sorry Hermione stole my phone
Neville was back with the drinks. Harry lifted his to Aberforth and drained it.
What’s it to you?
“And nobility?” Amy said.
“Oh.” Ginny thought for a moment. “Is that bad?”
“I can’t let you--” Harry’s objection was cut off by the appearance of their waiter, who presented Draco with a bottle of wine. He tasted it, then nodded for it to be poured into his and Harry’s glasses. Harry watched in open astonishment.
“He can ask,” Harry said simply, “but I won’t.”
“Didn’t think you’d trust me to pick yours out for you.” Draco raised his eyebrows, and Harry added, “Or my own, for that matter.”
,” she said with relish. “Wait till I
Draco scoffed. “You defeated an immortal dictator when you were barely past puberty, and you’re afraid of your own children?”
Harry wanted to bang his head on the table. It was a moment before he could bring himself to speak again.
“I understand how this could be a—difficult situation for you, son. I’m sorry.”
He took his father’s archly curious expression as permission to go on.
“They have each other,” said Draco firmly.
Can I call you?
Without thinking, Hari reached out and traced the word printed on Sirius’ chest. He startled when the lion started to move, rearing up and letting out a silent roar.
was Harry, seated facing the door at a prime table in the center of the restaurant, his eyes narrowing as he spotted Draco.
HP: ur not wrong
“Mr. Potter,” oozed a voice Harry had, in his heart of hearts, still somehow hoped never to hear again. “So pleased I could get in touch with you. We have matters to discuss.”
“Hello to you too,” said Hermione, looking up from her book as Harry sat down in the armchair next to hers.
“He’ll probably expect you to speak for her as well.”
“What should we do, then, Hermione?” asked Ron.
“All right, all right. I see your point. But—isn’t that just sort of the strangeness of the modern way? You know, blended families and...what is that rot Hermione’s always going on about?”
grew up throwing money around. All I’ve ever wanted was a family and enough money to feed them. You’re the only person I love, Amy.”
“Oh! You--” Sirius shook his head as if to clear it. “Well, that’s your choice, I suppose.”
“You like that idea?” Draco asked. “Being held in here under me while I take you apart, hour after hour, stopping only to eat and sleep?”
been relieved. When you showed up. When you forgave me. When, after everything, you were still there.”
hadn’t the taste to notice,” said Draco.
On his way out, Draco steeled himself to avoid looking in the kitchen doorway. He imagined what he would see if he did: Tom hunched over a willow patterned mug, inhaling coffee fumes meditatively, the shadows of his long lashes brushing his cheeks. At peace in a way he never was with Draco present.
“That’d be a laugh,” Harry agreed.
“About what, mate?” asked Ron, coming to sit with his friends.
“Then no,” Harry said, “you know I can’t.”
Ginny immediately went to the sideboard (purchased when he’d just moved in, because years of living with Petunia Dursley had convinced him that people just
, apparently, because everyone in this fever dream was posh--to splash some water on his face. When he was done, he looked in the mirror. Yes, that was definitely Harry Evans (Potter? No. Evans. That was the name he’d chosen for himself). His own green eyes, though red-rimmed with exhaustion. His own thin face, his own brown skin, pale and wan but certainly his.
U ok 2nite?
His gaze lingered on Harry’s trembling lip, but when he leaned in he went straight for his neck, sucking and biting at the first spot he found as Harry squirmed. Drawing away, he was pleased to see a red mark there, possibly dark enough to bruise.
Is this mostly setup for the really juicy chapter tome come next? Yes! Am I happy with it anyway? Also yes!
“Gin,” said Harry, looking at her woundedly, “you didn’t.”
HP: yeah
“Well, I
“Nothing,” said Draco. “And I don’t throw money around. That would be gauche.”
Eventually his sobs died down again, and Molly patted his back.
“Honestly,” said Harry tightly, “I’m not in the mood to joke about my sex life right now. The world is upside down, my parents were murdered, we’re on the run, and I had family all the time and
“I only meant that he was a Muggle,” Draco clarified.
“Jewelry?” Hermione inquired.
“You’re blushing,” Pansy observed.
It is incredible how quickly one can shop for engagement rings in a world that contains the Re-Sizing Charm. On Thursday, Harry and Draco buried themselves in books, choosing gemstones for each other’s rings at guess-whose insistence. Draco, of course, was well versed in the symbolism of every stone imaginable, but seemed to enjoy re-reading legends, and pointing out the meanings of difference cuts and the histories of famous jewels to Harry.
“You and Harry,” Tom said through gritted teeth.
He smiled to himself as he sent it. He figured that probably counted as flirting.
“So pleased you could make time for me,” was Draco’s greeting. Harry shuddered. He sometimes forgot how much of Draco’s speech patterns were adapted from his father’s.
“Details,” she said, taking a sip. “What are you
“I understand,” said Draco politely, though inwardly he bristled at Dr. Pince’s attitude, which seemed rather to demand deference than offer it.
The blond just raised his eyebrows.
happy for you, Dad,” said Lily sweetly. Then she reached across the table and stole the rest of Albus’ cake.
“I leave here at six,” said Harry, wryly adding, “for my other job, which starts at seven.”
Wednesday was dinner at Ron and Hermione’s. Since all of relevance were in attendance, both Potter-Malfoy sets decided to announce their intentions toward each other in one fell swoop. After a few congratulations were muttered and Hermione patted Ron’s back till he stopped choking on his wine, a silence fell over the table.
Harry looked down doubtfully at the snoring, leaking beast whose head rested on his insufficient knee.
Harry swallowed and nodded, tearing up a bit. “Thank you, sir.”
“Death Eaters and who’s fucking them,” George elaborated.
home.”
It wasn’t until several seconds later, as he poured his whisky in absolute silence, that Harry realized what he’d said. He poured Draco a measure and doubled his own.
“I can only tell you what I know, and I only just found out myself.”
“What?” demanded Ginny gleefully. “What’s he done?”
“Cold as a witch’s tit,” Pettigrew revised in his charmless manner. “Come on, we’ll give you a ride wherever you’re going.”
To: Draco Malfoy
“Just trying to help, love.”
“Fuck ‘em,” Abeforth said, nodding his approval.
Heady thoughts. But what Draco was in the mood for didn’t involve such savagery
“What’s your favorite colour?” Harry blurted out. His palms were sweating, and he would do anything to get Draco to stop.
The important character was Lump, obviously.
“Not here.”
“Yes, well, Dra—I mean, I’ve been working on my letter writing.”
“I am glad we’ve run into you. I was under the impression you were dead.”
“Indeed,” said Draco, taking a sip of his own drink. “To this nightmare we’ve gotten ourselves into.”
“You’re a fucking piece of work, Malfoy.”
Harry went to calm Amy down, as she was still laughing hysterically, and Draco spoke to Sirius in a low voice.
this?” Harry spat.
“Thank you, My Lord,” said Draco. “As for the plan—simply put, I would like to offer myself as a spy. I would go to Dumbledore, proclaim to him that I want to go over to the goody-two-shoes side of things, express remorse or, well, whatever it is Gryffindor types experience when they’re overcome with their emotions.” Pettigrew gave an offended squeak, and Voldemort an appreciative laugh. Draco went on. “So I tell him I want in on his little game in exchange for the safety and security of myself and my family. We’re known to be self-serving cowards, so he’ll believe this easily enough, if my hunch is correct. Thus, our funds are restored. If I’m right in thinking he is unaware that you reside here, My Lord, then that will be that. Of course, if he is aware, then my parents will unfortunately have to be removed to Salazar knows what dreadful safe house until our vaults can be wrested out from Dumbledore’s influence. As far as I can see it, that would be the only real disadvantage of the plan.”
Harry looked down, fighting furious tears, as he walked toward the managers’ shared office. He really didn’t want to see the blond man’s face right now. Or Amy’s, for that matter.
The Headmistress, and with her every child that passed through her halls.
“I can’t believe it. Harry. I can’t fucking believe it. You were dead--Dumbledore said so--everybody thought--I mean everybody
?” Arthur couldn’t help but exclaim.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re...I was buzzing,” said Harry.
Harry put his head in his hands. No one was helping, not because they didn’t care (well,
“Have I?” Draco was nonplussed. He’d thought this meeting was about Harry, but apparently not. Apparently it was about someone with Competing Interests. Which, on the one hand, could be almost anyone he knew (except Harry). But on the other hand, it depended on what one meant by “associating.” While he spent a lot of time socializing, Draco wasn’t one for close friends, and aside from Tom, he rarely even fucked the same person twice.
“Are you sure you want to quit?” Hermione had asked for the hundredth time.
“Use your eyes, Ronald.”
a wizard,” said Harry slowly.
“And for you,” said Draco, carding Harry’s hair with his free hand, “Emerald.”
consult Hermione first.”
Ron opened his mouth to speak, then changed his mind, and drank half his pint instead. Harry waited.
“Good point.” There was a loud hiss as Ginny poured frozen happy face potatoes into the skillet. “Anyway, I think it’s good for her to have a place where she can let her excess weirdness out. Not that I mind it, but I can’t really contribute, you know?”
“I just need to pick up something that got left here,” Harry tried.
“That’s all right,” Luna assured him. “You’re still our friend, aren’t you?”
“That’s one of many reasons people sometimes stay in abusive relationships,” Luna finished quietly.
“Harry James Potter,” she hissed, “you texted ‘I’m okay. Need time.’ And then turned your mobile off!”
That was, till Harry opened his mouth and, sighing weightily, undertook to speak.
Because. Living on? That was
“It’s the locket,” Harry said with a cringe.
Reluctantly, Harry handed over the tequila bottle. Draco pointed his stick at it and muttered a nonsense word, and all the liquid inside disappeared. Before Harry could so much as protest, Draco said another word, and the bottle refilled with brown liquid.
“Oh, but there is, Professor,” Draco enthused. “You’re my savior! How can I ever thank you?”
HP: help
So Draco did. He told Harry about meeting up with Pettigrew--a name that made Harry hiss, having inherited an unexplained hatred for his godfather’s ex-friend--and about the suspicions it stirred. Then he described his journey to the Malfoy Corporation labs for research.
“Harry Potter, the father of your son’s boyfriend. Is your boyfriend.”
“Hari Evans,” he said through his tears.
“Oh, nothing of the sort,” said Draco blithely. “You know I always reach for the stars.”
With a loud belch, the cupboard messily expelled its contents in a pile on the floor. Then it popped out of existence, leaving Arthur a clear view of a stunned Sirius and a dark-haired, brown-skinned, green-eyed young man.
“Good talk, Potter,” he said, and walked away.
“‘E got meaner. Killed mos’ all of his brothers. Firs’ in the Forest to kill a unicorn, too, by my reckoning.”
The bartender did indeed bring their drinks, placing a martini in front of Draco before setting down Harry’s scotch. Draco raised an eyebrow.
And, much to the shock of the entire Weasley family and of Harry himself, Harry had socked Bill in the face.
“My family is so
“Yes! It’s still off. And has been for, by my count, twenty-seven hours!”
“Mmph,” said Albus through his faceful of pillow. Harry sighed and sat gingerly on the end of the bed. He rested a nervous hand on his son’s shoulder.
“It’s all right,” said Draco softly, taking the proffered glass. “Shall we table that for a while?”
“Boy!” Vernon spluttered, at the same time Petunia--who, Harry faintly registered, was standing nearby--hissed, “Potter!”
“I’m scared,” he whispered.
“This is far enough,” said Harry when they had stepped out of earshot of the cafe tables outside the doors. “What is it?”
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
“Nothing,” said Draco. So, with a shrug, Harry took another bite.
Subject: your slight on my honor
to Talk, Harry?”
“I love you, Dad.”
“Honestly, Harry,” Draco scoffed, “it’s public record. And even if it weren’t, Gerta would find it.”
“Meow,” said Hedwig. He looked down at the fluffy white cat.
“I don’t suppose you’ll apologize to Ron, as well?” Harry asked hopefully. Draco looked over his shoulder at him with a raised eyebrow.
“Didn’t--what?”
“Yeah,” Amy chimed in. “It was great.”
Well, you have to eat.
. You know that, right?”
“Yes,” she said, “but the sooner he knew about it, the more time he would have to prepare a defense. And possibly dispose of evidence. That’s why we were keeping it quiet.”
“What?” Harry asked, half-distracted.
Their banter winded, there was a pause.
“That’s true enough. Though they both get that ‘wounded ex’ look from time to time...”
“It’s not a race,” Draco observed.
vocation is survival, but in a certain, dare I say glamorous, idiom. To grasp with panache. To claw with aplomb. It is rather a specialty of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy. An intergenerational calling, if you will.”
Srry just took a shot.
Harry shrugged helplessly. “I didn’t think we’d break up.”
“Please, I didn’t mean to--go on. I’m sorry.”
“Well,
The goblin laughed. “Just Silvertooth, Mr. Potter. Goblins have no need for your human honorifics.”
good, Gin. Honestly, if I’m scared of anything, it’s that.”
Ron groaned. “Why do you have to choose a moment like this to be right for once?”
“And you won’t?” Draco asked.
“All right,” said Harry, and he hung up. Dennis opened his mouth to ask questions, and Harry shot him a glare. Thus, he was allowed to return to his desk in peace. He promptly called Draco.
“That’s what I put on my job application,” Harry admitted. “I changed it as soon as I turned eighteen, so they wouldn’t find me. I was born Harry Potter. Always thought it was rather unfair, you know, being called Harry without it being short for anything. And Evans was my mother’s maiden name.”
“Hmmkay,” said Harry, painfully opening his sandy eyes, “‘ll be righ’ there.”
“Why not?” Harry demanded. “What do you want?”
Voldemort chuckled indulgently. “Patience, Draco,” he said. “Perhaps, in time, as a reward for a well-executed mission.”
“You want me to take care of you, baby?” Harry whimpered and nodded. “You’ll be good for me?” Another nod. “Good.” Draco wove his fingers into Harry’s curls at the back of his head and pulled the taut. “I’ve got you, baby.”
“Fair.”
“You’re an incurable drama queen,” Tom observed, moving toward Draco but not sitting down.

Albus turned his head to the side long enough to look his father in the eye.
“Yes,” said Draco, “I’m beginning to see that.”
? But it’s January,” said Harry, blinking.
“Draco.”
“Why?” Draco repeated, longing leaking into his voice.
. I was understandably upset and not yet in full control of my emotions, Ronald.”
“Me too,” Al whispered back. “But you know what?”
“Yeah it can!” Ginny exclaimed, offering a hand for her wife to high-five. Luna did so with an indulgent smile.
“Pardon?”
Neither Amy or Harry was entirely sure what was going on, but both were fairly certain Draco was being snobby. Draco calmed their raised hackles by continuing.
method?” asked Pansy curiously. Draco shrugged. Both of them sipped their drinks.
about your family life? What’s it about, then?”
Harry snorted.
Harry took a gulp of his drink, coughed a little.
“That wasn’t my first question,” Sirius pointed out.
“You just said ‘ain’t,’” Draco responded stupidly, in apparent shock.
Harry threw his head back and laughed. “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.”
“Stop that,” Draco snapped.
“Turnabout is fair play,” he said. “You hurt me, I hurt you.”
Fingers ran through Harry’s hair in a gesture that was both comforting and attention-grabbing. Harry looked up to meet his boyfriend’s eyes.
While he was in the kitchen spooning cat food from a can, he fumed. He just wanted the fucking photo. Why was that git making him jump through all these fucking hoops? For his own twisted satisfaction? Harry shouldn’t’ve agreed to meet Draco at the pub. He should’ve just tackled him and wrestled the photo off of him right there. Now how was he going to get the photo back? He only had one other of his parents: the one that sat on the side table by his couch, of them laughing together, bundled up, in the snow. Thinking of the image, he slumped over the counter and put his head in his hands.
I now know better than to promise another chapter soon, but the next one is already in the works and I'm pretty excited about it.  Boozy lunch is gonna be ~spicy~.  Your attention feeds me.  Thanks for reading, lovelies!
, and the day can only go downhill from there.”
Harry gave Ron an exasperated look, ran his hand through his hair. “No, she’s not,” he said quietly. “And she has every right to treat me how she wants.”
“Oh, come on. Look--what is this job?”
“I look forward to it,” said Scorpius.
“Probably.” Draco sighed and stood. “I think I could use a drink after all.”
Harry choked on his beer. “Er, a bit, actually.”
“So am I,” said Harry. “I shouldn’t have been so quick to—I mean, I should have tried harder. To make you understand. To let you know that—however you feel, it’s okay. But. I need him, anyway.”
It sure would be nice if this could be resolved via due process...lol. This is a fantasy story, though, and revenge is quick and brutal.  At least, we hope. Tune in next time to find out of Narcissa is willing and able to save the day.
“Yes, My Lord. Our accounts at Gringotts have been frozen.”
“Being gay isn’t all about the sex, Ginny,” Harry deadpanned. “I can’t believe you’re trying to fetishize my kinky hookup.”
, he says. All right, Potter, I’ll be there.”
“It’s the look of disgust,” said Sirius. “Telling.”
“You’re the one who gave him my address!” Harry exclaimed in horror.
Hello again, gentle readers!  I've had some major life events since I posted the first chapter of this fic, but Malfoy Harlequin has never been far from my mind.  As I settle in, new chapters should be more forthcoming.  In the meantime, enjoy some devious plotting!
“Well, yes,” Sirius agreed, “but that’s not what I was going to say. I just--it’s strange--it used to be called the Order of the Phoenix, but ever since Dumbledore--”
“Bu’ that’s the thing. ‘E was one o’ my own, an’ in the end, I was grateful. No matter wha’, I’d’ve rather seen ‘im alive than otherwise.”
“No. But considering the number of shares you own, I’m sure not even Dr. Pince could object to your taking notes--” Theo looked at him sternly-- “
Sirius appeared to be processing the news, expression thoughtful.
Harry nodded.
“I’m not confident he knows how to light a stovetop,” said Harry dryly. “He has other talents.”
“High praise indeed,” said Sirius, a charming smile starting to emerge. “Does he have a bit of kneazle in him? Or is he just a muggle cat with good taste?”
“Look, Papa,” he said gently, “I know we can’t exactly go crying to Dumbledore over this, or--well, anyway. It was probably his idea to seize our assets in the first place. But if you trust me for just a little while, I can see this through so that we come out on top without getting dragged down by the pesky life-or-death conflict of it all. Family first, right? You trust me?”
And they did, tensely returning to their breakfasts without saying a word.
It was incredible. Harry had never been out of the country before, let alone to
Draco huffed and muttered, clear as a bell, that Harry was uncivilized to keep him standing out of doors like this. Then he said, “I have taken pity on a poor orphan boy. I have the photo.”
“Glad I called you,” said Draco.
“With your Weasley fiancé.”
Harry leaned into her. He couldn’t believe he’d been so stupid. This was his Mum. He couldn’t leave her. He would have to make her see. He wouldn’t give this up. They would all be together. They would have to.
buttons?”
Harry swallowed hard. “You knew my father?”
“What if my parents had stopped inviting me to Christmas when I told them I didn’t want to be a dentist?”
Luna glanced at the ceiling, while the others leveled him unimpressed stares.
“Except you.”
“Well, Sirius,” said Arthur, “I should very much like an explanation of this situation, if you have one to offer.”
“I think You-Know-Who’s plaything wants to talk
“Sorry?”
It would be tight for the next week, but Harry actually had just managed to scrape together his rent money for the following month. With a sigh, locked his door behind him and walked down to the office of his landlord, Mr. Chatwal. He knocked and went in.
“Yes, well.” Pettigrew smiled nastily. “It wasn’t a Concern before now.”
“I didn’t know I had a godfather,” he said to Sirius.
“Tom,” said Draco, affecting exasperation when all he really felt was mounting nausea, “don’t play stupid. You’re a clever chap. Don’t expect me to believe you’ve been stringing me along all these years without knowing what you were doing. I knew what you were doing, and I was the one being strung.”
“You wore the hideous thing over your cut-rate Benetton for
“Your cousin is my godfather?” Harry asked at the same time.
Harry fixed Ron with a steady look. That was a half-truth at best.
“But she
Thank you all so much for reading!  I've been thrilled with the response to this so far.  Your comments make me so happy!  I hope you all continue to enjoy, as it only gets weirder from here.
“Care to make a wager? I can have Potter in two weeks if you’re going to keep giving me skeptical looks like that.”
“Suit yourself,” Tom said, and walked out the door.
“You know it’s not
“I don’t see where,” said Harry, looking around in confusion.
“Er,” said Harry, “None that I’m aware of, so I really have no idea what heinous sin you think I’ve committed.”
Draco surreptitiously cast another warming charm on himself. He’d been waiting outside the cafe for nearly half an hour now; it was amazing how long it apparently took to fire someone. Which, of course, hadn’t been his intention when he began speaking to the man at the till, but it was probably for the best after all. It seemed deeply wrong to Draco that someone so attractive worked in such a menial position. Draco would have to get him a decent position before he left here. With a wand in the Muggle world and with money to boot, there was little Draco couldn’t do in that regard.
,” Hermione interrupted. “Not only did you go back, you actually spoke to him?”
For those who have been waiting for an update, thank you for your patience. For those who just found this fic, welcome. I have no idea what's going on here either.
“Thank you for having me,” Draco said. His easy smile sparked suspicion in Hermione, and she looked the two of them up and down, then groaned.
“Harry!” said Ginny in alarm.
“I was ready,” Harry continued, “to storm into her very kitchen and tell her that, while I very much wanted to be a part of the family”—Draco took in a hissing breath—“you were the most important thing to me, and I would not come back without you,” Harry finished.
“I doubt that,” said Harry. “I didn’t bother with anything as nice as you’re wearing even for Uncle Albus’ funeral.”
HP: ...yes actually
“I don’t know.” Draco leaned forward. “But I do have one theory--”
“Draco?” said Harry after several long minutes.

“We can do this.”
“Nothing. Just one of the houses at my school. I think you’d have fit right in.”
“Witch, Harry, you can say it,” said Draco. “And I don’t see how she could

easy.
“He does overnight stocking at Tesco three times a week.”
“Let’s start,” said Luna eventually, “from the beginning. It might help you to put it all in place, and anyway, Ginevra and I have only heard it secondhand.”
“Made love with Draco Malfoy, of course,” said Luna matter-of-factly.
“Harry,” said Molly. He looked up at her attentively. “Harry,” she said again. She sighed.
“I need to see the labs,” Draco admitted with little shame. “I’ve no idea where they are, but I know you have something to do with them."
“Well, hello there,” said a dazed Sirius to his sudden armful of cat.
And when are you finished with work?
“I didn’t know what I would have done without you. I still don’t. When you got up, I was so relieved." He finished his pint. "I’ve
“Your lunch is vegetarian too,” Hermione pointed out.
“I was waiting to apologize,” Draco told him.
“Quite. Now, if you’ll hold still?”
“All right,” said Harry, “you Summoned me. Now say what you wanted to say.”
“Down in the kitchen,” Ron said enticingly, “at
Harry turned to Neville. “Any way you can think of to translate that into Molly-Weasley-speak?”
“He only would have gotten in the way of our chat,” said Tom after an awkward moment. “I wished to speak with you in a professional setting, and I applied to Lord Malfoy for help.”
There was so much to sort out. Perhaps Harry’s nap could wait just a bit longer.
“Call it a hunch.” They made their way up to Amy’s apartment, which was just as much of a shithole as Harry’s, if rather more charmingly decorated with its swags of tie-dyed fabrics and bead curtains in all the doorways. Add to that the stacks of books on the floor, the actual fucking lava lamp on the coffee table, and the fat cat lying belly-up on the rag rug, and it looked like a head shop owned by a former librarian. God, he
“I promise we’ll tell you everything in the morning,” said Sirius.
“No,” Harry agreed without realizing he did so out loud. Hagrid caught his gaze.
“No,” he splutterd, “I just--I don’t trust him!”
“Looks better that way,” said Draco.
to spite him.
“You think I—” Ron cut off abruptly, took a deep breath. Instead of yelling, he said, “I don’t see how that’s relevant.”
Harry was left gaping after her as she stalked to the pick-up counter, pram in tow.
Harry took a deep breath and started his litany. “It’s all right. I’ve still got Teddy, Andromeda...Luna’s been lovely, and Neville’s been all right...we have the dogs...”
such patience. Right now, he needed control.

“George,” Angelina warned.
, right, Harry?”
“Survival,” said Harry.

Shortly after Draco’s announcement--followed by a hurried assurance that Narcissa was the best, nay,
“Wait,” said George.
“No, wait. I need to say this. Please, just, don’t give Tom any information about me, all right? I know he seems nice, but he’s really--”
So it was that he had to stop himself from smiling when the window rolled down to reveal one of his least favorite faces in London.
“Right,” said Harry slowly, “The bank with my
“What are you doing?” she asked nervously. “It says ‘danger.’”
“You’re taller than me,” Harry observed.
“Young Harry has a lot on his shoulders,” said Dumbledore. “He needs all the friends he can get. Keep an eye on him, would you?”
“Me too,” said Harry, “though you’re going to have to start calling her Molly sometime, if she’s to be your mother-in-law.”
“It’s all right if you used to be a racist prick,” said Amy, “as long as you aren’t one any more.”
she was reading. “I don’t think you’ve got to worry about Dad, either. You know he’s been quite friendly with Mr. Malfoy lately.”
Draco choked on his firewhisky. “My what?”
“Have they got an
The afternoon sun lit the Burrow in a gentle gold. Harry inhaled the scent he’d once associated with home: firewood, food, the lemony finish of Molly’s cleaning charms. (The scent of home, now, was bergamot. Draco’s cologne, the constant earl grey tea—the man was obsessed).
“How horrible,” said Draco.
“Not four hours ago,” said Harry grimly.
“You lied to me,” Tom said by way of greeting.
“Bacon,” Sirius explained, smiling guiltily, “for those of us who eat it.”
Hari gratefully did as instructed, filling the kettle with fresh water and bringing it to the range. Both Sirius and Draco jumped, however, when Hari lit the stovetop using the dial.
“I love you too, son.”
“Don’t go.”
“It’s sensitive information,” Theo chided. “Trade secrets and ongoing projects. Can’t have cloud storage with that sort of thing. Not secure enough.”
Subject: intel
“You’re Narcissa’s boy?” Sirius asked in some surprise.
“It was relevant,” said Draco.

“Doesn’t your mum know?” Harry asked, brow furrowed.
“What?”
Albus dropped his fork. “
“In a suburb. In Surrey. With my aunt and her family.”
Scorpius returned the gesture. “No, you’re great.” And then they were in a giggly cheek-kissing war.
“Who are you?” Harry asked.
“Watch your words, Granger,” said Draco. “You could offend someone.”
many of his looks,” Harry protested with a shudder.
Hitler!” Amy protested.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I suppose I can’t contradict that.”
“Quite.” Hermione sighed. “Draco isn’t going to take this well.”
“Of course it’s different,” said Harry. “
“Don’t quote me,” she said, “but I think he means a flying broom.”
“Pretty magic,” he said politely. “I don’t think I know that one.”
“Let me see,” said Arthur, and his head disappeared from the fire for a moment, before it flared up and he stepped through.
“Maybe...but I’m not sure if I wish that for

“Did I…” Draco gave a hysterical little chortle. “Did I
“I punched him and ran away,” Harry interjected proudly. Sirius laughed.
“Oh. Oh, um, what?”
“Ah yes,” said Draco. “What did they call you? ‘The aristocracy’s own feral child.’”
“C’mon,” he said from the library, “let’s go check on Harry.”
“If you’d just let me pop in,” said Harry, stepping into the light a bit. Then he added, “I suppose Tom’s in the kitchen.”
Except that things were irrevocably changed, because this was real, and Draco didn’t want to deny Harry anything. He wasn’t sure he was capable of it any more. So he gave in to Harry’s desires, and his own, cupping Harry’s face in his hand and stroking the cheekbone with his thumb.
HP: *supercilious
Harry laughed, almost silently. He had rather tired himself out. Sniffling, he drew himself away from Molly so he could look her in the eye.
“Absofuckinglutely not,” said Harry. “That would put a distinct kink in my plan to forget that the bastard was ever born.”
“Certainly,” said Draco, who had at best only a vague awareness of such a thing, and then only because he had encouraged the connection as a way of keeping himself in bed with Tom, both metaphorically and literally.
“Charming as this has been,” said Harry, still not looking up, “I’ve work to do before I turn in, so I’ve got to be going now.”
“Harry,” said Harry.
worked any more.
“He didn’t,” said Harry, puzzled.
At eight fifty-five, Harry stepped off the elevator into what looked like the waiting room for a million-pound plastic surgeon. Amongst the immaculate chairs and striped ivory wallpaper, a woman sat at an elegant wooden desk. Harry vaguely recognized her from school, the younger sibling of one of Draco’s hangers-on.
Harry laughed outright as that.
He wasn’t suited to that, was the thing. Sure, Harry understood enough about the law to navigate it to his charges’ best advantage, but his strengths were really in discovering where a child’s best interests lay and then doggedly advocating for them. He’d had to learn the diplomatic skills involved, but the implacability came naturally. Puzzle-solving and sleuthing, though? For all he and his friends had gamboled about like Harriet the Spy and the Hardy Boys at Mallory Towers, Hermione was the logician and Ron the chess champion. Harry had only ever been nosy, restless, and awash with an indeterminate righteous fury.
“That one’s called a Patronus,” Sirius explained. “We use them to send messages, but the spell was originally designed to create a sort of...er...guardian against Dementors. Which are a type of Dark creature.”
“I want to eat
Harry was starting to cry again. Molly shook her head and brought him back into her arms.
for his birthday that year. Just past the marbled endpapers, there was an inscription in her neat, practical cursive.
“Droll,” said Draco.
“Nonsense--I don’t know what gave you the idea--”
“You’ve done so yourself,” Draco agreed.
“I will be the judge of that,” said Voldemort.
Lily just rolled her eyes.
“Enter,” said the voice from inside, and Harry did. He stopped short when he took in the scene: Lord Malfoy seated behind his outrageously oversized desk, and in a comfortable conference chair pulled up intimately to his side, one Tom Riddle.
“No.” Harry scrambled out of his chair. “I’ll take the call. Here I come.”
Theo stood, resigned, and smoothed the legs of his brown suit. “What do you want, Draco?”
“Imagine being one of
“Oh,” said Ron. “Mate…”
“Yes,” said Draco patiently, “but that doesn’t mean she’s told him. Of course, I suspect she has, but even then, he may not believe it.”
“Perhaps we should sit?” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at Amy as if she were a society hostess making a gaffe.
Draco gave a small smile and squeezed Harry’s hand, hard. Garnet, the stone of passionate devotion, was as durable as it was binding.
“I really don’t,” Harry protested. “You’re not drunk already, are you?”
“I won’t let him leave anything out,” Draco added. “Get some rest, Harry.”
Harry stared for a moment at the coffee cup on his desk. Then he opened a chat window and messaged Hermione.
“Well,” she said.
Theo reluctantly looked up from his computer, where he appeared, alarmingly, to be doing actual
“What brought this on?” Hermione asked him.
“So was I,” said Draco. “I’ve been Tom’s friend since Uni, same as you. We talked. We talked about you.”
Draco swallowed. That...well, he wasn’t quite heartless enough to scorn that, even if he did hate Harry with all his might. No friend of Tom’s could take orphanhood lightly.
“It’s not,” Draco sniffed. “That had better be
family dinner.”
“This is no time to joke!” Draco protested. “D’you know how long I’ve been flying confunded on this? I need to know--”

“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I don’t know about that, but if you’re going to,
“It’s Draco Malfoy. Is Harry there?”
“Yes, yes,” said Draco, still looking at Pettigrew with loathing. “I don’t suppose, My Lord, that we could have Weasley killed?”
“Think he has poisoners?” Pansy asked.
Harry groaned.
“I’m so sorry,” he said, and the look in his face was more empathetic than pitying.
But she was interrupted by the sound of the door unbolting itself.
--I mean, humans mostly--to see. The Patronus charm is designed to frighten Dementors. Wizards and squibs can see magic
“Oh,” said Harry, “I see.”
--too many. For someone who’d had less than half a life to learn to love, Harry had acquired a surprising number of stumbling blocks.
“Need, more like.”
Thus, he burst into Theo Nott’s office (two floors below his own) at around the time most Malfoy Industries employees were going home for the day.
“You let me.”
“Not on your life,” said Blaise. “I’ll keep my money, thanks.”
“What was that?” Harry inquired, suddenly all seriousness.
“You know how Tom...was?” asked Harry. His voice was increasingly halting.
“Anyway.”
The blond laughed and cocked his head slightly to read Harry’s nametag.
“You don’t know me,” said Draco.
“Right,” said Draco resignedly. “Don’t suppose I can fall back asleep now, anyway. Say hi to Uncle Sev for me.”

that,” said Harry, freezing Draco with the intensity of his voice. “But it’s something I left in the locket, all right? I don’t want the bloody fucking thing, why would I? This is just a simple extraction.”
“Ah.” Harry laughed. “Actually, before I could get a word in, Molly was hugging me and inviting you to family dinner. Turns out she was holding up about as well as I was with the separation.”

is having a good day. Perhaps responding would brighten things up.
“This doesn’t look like going home,” Kingsley pointed out.
“He is,” Draco agreed, smug. Tom always went to the kitchen after sex to make and drink a cup of coffee. It was his way of enjoying the afterglow while simultaneously letting his bed partner know they were not welcome to spend the night. “And I won’t.”
“Right, the maitre’d who was a good bloke was calling the cops on Vernon and Petunia I think or he was threatening to, and I hid in the loo and Draco went in there to check that I was all right, which was sweet, I mean if it’d been me I think I’d have fucking run--”
I’m ok. Can I call you tomorrow?
“Thank you for informing me.” Draco took a drink.
“Ah,” said Draco.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry to Draco at once. “I was wrong. In—a lot of ways. Drink?”

“Lily Evans,” Harry confirmed, his eyes distant. “And my father was James Potter. That’s all I know about them, really--their names. That, and the fact that they died in a car crash when I was a little over a year old.”
“But you wish you had.”
“Harry, calm the fuck down and tell me what has you so worked up.”
“Thank you, My Lord. And may I say you look resplendent with serpentine, er, splendor, today.”
“Glad to hear it,” said Draco. “You’ll like them, Amy. Luna’s a very generous soul.” She caught his drift and shared a wicked grin with him, but this exchange went blessedly over poor Arthur Weasley’s head.

“Your vocation, young Draco? Are you not still in school?”
“Come now, Draco. You’re too good for such cliches.”
Sirius grinned and Draco, for some reason, grimaced.

“I told you,” said Draco, frustrated, “I can get you a job!”
“Yeah, I reckon.”
“Did you know them?” Harry asked, puzzled.
It was both a command and a threat. Normally, Harry wouldn’t have responded to such a tone. But these days had been frustrating, and Harry was chomping at the bit to do something.

, and returned the hug. And maybe he cried a little, too. After all, he’d had a long day. A long life, really. When Sirius’ sobs had worn down to sniffles, he started talking.
Harry shrugged awkwardly. Draco cleared his throat and continued.
“Actually, I usually just go to a club. I walked into that cafe intending to get a cuppa. You changed my plans.”
“All right.” Harry drained the rest of his pint in one. “Aberforth, any chance I could get a firewhisky?”
“What’s on your mind?” Hermione prompted, accepting that she was now on an official break from her homework.
Harry sighed, put down his phone, and opened up his paperwork again.
Harry thought Luna’s statement would shock Neville, but realized almost as soon as he had the thought that that wasn’t how things worked--that wasn’t how
From: Draco Malfoy
No--Draco had to admit to himself that that wasn’t true. He may not like Harry, but he oughtn’t fool himself that it was actually Harry himself that had brought on his ire. A bit creepy, a bit intense, and stubborn as hell, he was, but not a bad bloke in all. No, nowadays Draco hated Harry almost solely because of Tom. Harry had captured Tom’s attention in ways Draco never had--probably never would, truth be told. Maybe it was that desperate, self-immolating honesty of his. That was a trait Draco could never attempt to replicate.
“Those are skulls!” she exclaimed.
“What the fuck? Who’s ‘we’?”
“I understand,” said Hermione dryly.
“Nah,” said Harry. “Not me. The

“It is true that we snakes are cunning, that we thrive on silence and subtlety and sneakery and all that sibilant stuff, but, you see, it is not another snake I am attempting to woo.”
“No need for that,” said Dumbledore, patting the boy’s back awkwardly and firmly reminding himself that, while there is no appropriate time to notice a student’s attractiveness, it is especially inappropriate to do so when that student is sobbing into one’s arms.
“I shouldn’t have let it happen,” she said. “You’re ours. My son, no matter what. I shouldn’t have forgot that.”
“You’re right, Granger.”
And who had he done it for? All the people he loved.
When Harry Flooed home he felt sick to his stomach and, what was worse, not at all drunk. He braced himself against the mantle and groaned. He heard footsteps: Draco fluttering about the house. The man couldn’t keep still.
“How’d you know it was me?” Harry asked as he stepped inside.
However loose his cannonballs, it was clear enough that there was a natural first step: he would need to find the

Tom’s eyes were cold and dead, reminding Harry of the times when he’d genuinely feared Tom would kill him.
Luna put her hand over his, fixed her wide pale eyes on him. “Harry, Draco is a part of you.”
Draco laughed. “What a cliché.” But they decided to embrace it: a gold setting for the garnet, and platinum for the emerald.
“In a mo, Victoire,” he said to the little girl.
“I know it’s easy to slip.”

“What?” Al kissed his cheek. “It’ll be great.” He kissed his cheek again. “Because you’re great.”
“Sorry?” Ron inquired, nervous and nonplussed.
Draco started so badly that he dropped his cigarette, then went to stomp it out only to realize, painfully, that he was not wearing shoes. He gritted his teeth against the sizzling of his foot and glared at the shadows, where a pair of green eyes glowed like a cat’s.
Harry huffed and turned around to look at Amy with a ‘can-you-believe-this-tosser’ look on his face. She just shrugged and spoke to the blond.

“Of course.”
“You’re not helping,” Harry interrupted her.
“This is Lump,” said Amy, indicating the cat in question.
“You are no fun,” Ginny observed.
“Hmm,” said Ginny quietly, sympathetically. “I suppose you’re right that Tom wouldn’t be willing to be dominated. But as for Draco...you know, Harry, there
“You were right,” said Harry conversationally, “Kensington is quite a trek from my neck of the woods.”

“Yeah,” said Ginny.

He came to my office today. Brought coffee.
“You're a good boy. Don't get too mixed up in whatever this is.”
So he started nibbling. Trailing fingers over sensitive skin, up Harry’s sides, lightly through his armpit hair, listening to the breathy little sounds he made. So soft, so quiet Harry was for Draco, normally all roaring fire but now just...gentle as a candle flame. The feeling was overwhelming, and Draco suppressed his sudden urge to sob by biting down hard on Harry’s collarbone.
HP: tom stopped by my office
“Hopkins,” Amy supplied, adding at a mutter, “Not that it matters.”
Victoire’s little arms wrapped around his knees again, and Harry lay a hand on her head. Molly released him, grasping his shoulders instead so she could look at him, one tearful face to another.
“All shades. Well, except that dreadful generic dress shirt shade. You know the one. You wear it most days.”
And then, almost entirely unaware of his own actions, Harry had slammed Draco against the wall and started kissing him. Draco had made a tiny squeaking sound and fell still for a moment, but soon melted into Harry with a sigh that sounded like relief, wrapping his arms around his neck and giving him everything. And that was the moment everything started making sense. It was the most turned on Harry had ever been, but that wasn’t the whole of it. There was, surprisingly, comfort in touching Draco. It was right. Between the two of them, everything fell together.
“Nothing doing,” said Neville, “though he does have a point.”
“Yeah,” Harry choked out, and followed him in a daze. Amy warily joined the parade, with Draco bringing up the rear.
“And where is that?” asked Draco, sneering faintly.

“Don’t worry,” said Draco. “He’s dead.”
There was a snort from behind the chair yet again, and this time Pettigrew emerged of his own accord.

“Most assuredly,” said Draco.

Draco sighed. “I’ll call you a car.”

And all these were enough to outweigh peace. Enough to outweigh all the laws of nature, and most of its loopholes. Enough to outweigh Harry’s innumerable dead, all the arms beckoning him.
“That’s one way to put it.”
“So, mate,” said Ron, turning to him, “how’s your morning been?”
“I don’t believe you, but I’ll have more wine.”
“Yes,” Harry managed, tipping his head back to bare more of his skin.
“Found you at last, nephew,” she said. “Come with Auntie Bella. If you kill the Muggles, our Lord may have mercy.”
(This is not a mystery story, so you already know the answer).
“I ever tell ye ‘bout Trog, Harry?”
. With a suction-cup noise, a door popped into existence--a squat cupboard-door that made Harry shudder. The door opened, and the flying objects were sucked into its dark depths. Once everything was inside, the cupboard sealed itself and disappeared.
“Okay,” Harry said again, and they hung up. So he texted Ron.
“Can you put the kettle on?” he requested. “I’m a bit busy with breakfast.”
“Yes, actually.” Harry hesitated.
“Er?”
Leave it to Al to see how nervous Scorpius was, even in the chaos of a train compartment full of friends.
Draco thought for a moment and then said, “Ah yes. I can see how that would have looked.”
“Sorry,” Harry lied, and let him go. Draco stepped inside, then stopped when met with a wall of unimpressed Granger-Weasleys.
Paris, and he struggled to focus on any one thing for more than a second. People milled about in outfits that looked like crosses between magistrate’s robes and business suits, wearing oddly-shaped, gaudy hats and laughing careless French laughs. Food stalls abounded with sandwiches and hot drinks and, in one case, crepes that flipped themselves while the proprietor chatted with her customers. The storefronts varied wildly from those that seemed somewhat familiar--patisseries, clothing stores, bookstores--to those that seemed anachronistic or simply bizarre--apothecaries, menageries, a gloomy antique shop straight out of Dickens, a storefront that merely displayed a single, inexplicable silver instrument that moved on its own. When Harry looked up he found the sky filled with owls in flight, deftly avoiding columns of colored smoke coming from an array of stone chimneys. It being night-time, candles glowed in the shop windows, and globes of soft yellow light floated just above the heads of passers-by. Music was coming from just down the street, and Harry peered ahead to see a street performer playing a violin with a cello standing on its own next to him, playing itself in accompaniment. Beside him, Amy took a deep whiff of the air.
“Ye know from experience that Fang’s a bloody coward,” Hagrid conceded, “bu’ that’s the thing abou’ cowards. Ye know what ‘appens when ye corner ‘em.”

“If this is how you react to the first course,” Draco choked out, “I think I’d like to buy you dinner every night.”
“I’m going to eat my bacon now,” Harry said with what he felt was great dignity.
Harry choked on his tea. Luna patted his back.
“Well?”
“Yes, sir,” he said, and left.
“Great timing,” Harry said, “as per usual.”
Dobby pulled up and let Draco in the car, avoiding eye contact. He snickered, and watched his mobile.
Theo stopped and looked at him. “What’s got into you? You don’t even like animals, not even dogs.”
“Well,” said Draco, setting Salazar down and brushing soot off his trousers, “Here I am. You may begin your apology at your convenience.”
“Looks
Draco couldn’t help but smile when his floo rang. It was the maitre’d of Tricolore, who, though a Muggle, had a witch for a sister and therefore catered to Muggle and Wizarding clientele alike. He smiled at Draco and told him his guest had arrived. After waiting fifteen minutes to make his response time believable to a Muggle, Draco walked into the restaurant, scanning the place as he handed his coat to the hostess.
“Of course,” said Harry. “Please. I’m sorry--I didn’t mean--I mean, I didn’t even know I was thinking it until just now.”
“But--”
“MMMmmph,” said Albus.
With a sigh, Harry took out his phone and called Amy. He had some venting to do.

It was strange to see Tom in Draco’s flat. Not just because Tom hadn’t visited often, but also because of the previous night. Draco had bundled Harry out of doors quickly enough when the car had arrived, but Harry left a certain feeling behind him, something scuffed and homey, that showed no sign of dissipating. That atmosphere did not suit Tom. It didn’t make room for the dark seriousness he brought with him everywhere.
“How,” said Draco, now resurfacing, “are you keeping in contact with Potterwatch from outside the border? I couldn’t reach them from
“Make up your mind,” said Harry. “Are you trying to buy me or be my mother?”
“True,” Amy agreed. “You are ‘charismatic.’”
Harry held his gaze, eager to keep Draco looking this uncomfortable for as long as possible.
“Sorry?”
“I’m not.”
Harry snorted. “Elegant,” he said sarcastically, eyeing the martini, which Draco was lightly sipping, barely disturbing the drink’s placid surface.
“It’s all right,” said Harry. “Listen, I’ve got to go. You know, got some kittens that need saving from trees.”
“It’s about Death Eaters.”
Harry felt fury well up in him as he glared at Draco.
No, he realized after a moment. That was him. Without realizing it, he’d begun to sob. Molly tightened her arms around him.
“Well,” he said, “this has been fun. See you at lunch.” And he gathered his things and left.
“I can’t,” said Draco firmly. “It’s already spent.”
Draco shrieked. Amy had fallen heavily into his shoulder, now just as deeply asleep as the cat in her lap.
RGW: sorry mate
“They were on the other side of the war?” Harry asked cautiously, “Against Voldemort?”
“Sorry, hold on,” said Draco. He drew his wand, pointed it at the cat, and muttered something, after which Lump promptly leapt off of him and into Amy’s arms. “I had to use a Sticking Charm to carry him and Apparate both of you at the same time.”
Then, suddenly, Draco broke away and immediately retreated.

“Mine’s green,” said Harry with a sigh.
children, after all.
“All right,” Harry agreed, still baffled, “but I’d like to know anyway.”
When he knocked on Kingsley’s office door to let him know he was taking a half-day, Kingsley looked at him blankly.
“I can smell your skin burning,” said Harry.
“He’s
“Ugh,” said Harry. “I like you, too. If our teenage selves could see us!”
“It seemed prudent to approach you as a professional,” Lucius prevaricated. “I wondered if you could find time in your busy schedule to meet with me.”
Harry was so flabbergasted by Draco’s kamikaze move that it was only with his peripheral Tom-sense that he saw Tom’s dreaded calm expression.
“Anyway,” she said, “you’ve always been quick to judge. If you’d made the wrong choice, I’m sure you’d have noticed by now.”

read. Probably have servants to do it for you. Well, I'm sorry, but that's not my kind of gig."
But when they had fallen onto that bed for the first time, Harry had seen nothing at all, eyes closed as Draco pulled his jumper over his head, then unbuttoned his shirt, kissing his chest as it was exposed.
“Excellent.” Pettigrew slurped more coffee. “After all, I’m sure you can imagine how dangerous it would be to have a social worker within spitting distance of our operation. Especially one as high-profile as Potter.”
Harry’s eyes sparked. He cast a quick
“He’d better,” said Ginny, setting their plates down and joining him at the table. “Nothing less than the best for my second-favorite ex.”
“Well, then, I have only this to say.” Draco leaned in close and sneered. “Get over it, Potter.”
Things are ramping up, so I can tentatively promise another chapter soon.  The sexual tension might be partly fulfilled, but now comes the romantic tension, which has the potential (as we Good Omens fans are well aware) to extend beyond Armageddon.  And next chapter, I'll even be introducing a strange new beast called plot!

--else. In the meantime, he’d take his extensive notes home with him and try to get some sleep. He couldn’t help but clutch his bag to his side as he stood just inside the door, waiting for Dobby. With that notepad nestled inside, the whole thing felt unstable. Just because he didn’t know exactly what his notes contained, didn’t mean they weren’t dangerous.
Draco looked up sharply. “Can you? That’s--
But as he stood on shaky legs to fulfill that resolution--hmm, how long had it been since he’d eaten, then?--Dennis Creevey, the receptionist-slash-aide-slash-office-mascot, poked his head round Harry’s cubicle wall.
“Malfoy,” Harry responded.
May I suggest you make time? Before you collapse.
“Sir, if you’re going to order anything, I’m going to need you to do so now. I’m afraid you’re holding up the queue.”
Apparently he hissed it louder than he’d intended, as he looked up to see the whole cafe staring at him, including his manager, Eric, who had been speaking with the tip-revoking woman from earlier.
“Dead sure,” Harry had said.
And by ‘thinking,’ he meant ‘watching reruns of

“I’m going to arrange dinner,” said Harry. “Here, so either of you can storm off if you need to. I’ll make something good. D’you like ratatouille? Of course you do, Frenchie. But Hermione will want to know this--soon. And I want to know, too.”
“I am,” she admitted.
By the time Harry got home, his mind was all in a muddle, and he felt all his soreness catching up with him. Barely stopping to pet the cat, he made a beeline for his bedroom, stripping off his work clothes and getting into bed. The sheets and mattress were soft, the pillows pleasantly firm, the duvet fluffy and warm. This was the one luxury Hermione had been able to convince him to add to his otherwise average flat: a bed to rival the comfort of the surprisingly luxurious ones in the Hogwarts dorms. He had even got a canopy frame and, at Hermione’s suggestion, added swathes of soft grey gauze as a nod to the curtains he had become used to in school. Ron had commented that the bed looked like the set for a softcore porno, but Harry paid no mind to that. It was comfortable, and yes, maybe a bit romantic, and even though Tom had rather liked it, it still felt very much his own.
Albus finally sat up. “That’s
“I’m confident you’ll grow accustomed to it,” said Draco, hiding his annoyance with a smirk. Harry wasn’t the first Muggle to react to his name in such a way; he supposed their customs were different.

the time?”
“Get up,” Ginny commanded. “I’ve made some hangover potion. If you’re lucky I’ll do a fry-up too.”
Returning to the present, Harry blinked at Draco.
“You think his magic sacrificed itself to save him? How is that possible?”
Theo shrugged. “In name, yes. In practice, I’ve the head for management, and he prefers to slum it with the lab technicians. So we reached an accord. Your father seems satisfied, to my knowledge.”
Was this just natural for Harry? Had Tom done this to him? Or was it stress? Or maybe...maybe this was just how he reacted to Draco? What a thought that was. Probably all of the above, Draco admitted to himself as he got to his feet.
Her attention was probably the only reason he hadn’t had any sort of mental breakdown (born of fear or frustration) amidst his research. He had a distressing inkling that something criminal was afoot, but unfortunately, the style of the project notes was utterly incomprehensible to anyone without a Ph.D. in chemistry.
“Right, you lot. I think it’s time for a meeting of the Ex-Hets Club. Clear out. Ron, I’ll bring him to dinner, don’t worry.”
“No,” said Harry, shaking his head and backing away, “I don’t think so.”
Draco shrugged. “I removed the wrinkles.”
Draco laughed. “Rather, My Lord. But I mean vocation not in the sense of career, but of
“Father,” he finally said with great gravity, “you really are the most terrible embarrassment.”
Right then, Harry decided to forget, for the next few minutes, that he hated this man. He rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“The cat likes him,” said Amy, ever the tension-breaker.
“You’re a spy, I get that,” said Harry.
Draco snorted, temporarily forgetting that he was angry with Pansy for waking him up at such an ungodly hour. “You’re a scourge upon the men and women of London,” he said.
“You mean you went out with Tall, Pale, and Filthy Rich?”
? What millennium is this?”
Scorpius tried to form a sentence in response, but all that came out was, “Eh?”
Harry swallowed. Ron leaned forward, still not quite looking at him, and patted his hand.
Harry whined.
“Why did you express interest at first,” Draco drawled slowly, “and then change your mind about me so quickly?”
Sirius turned to him with sad eyes. “I’m sorry to hear that, kid.”
“You mean you didn’t…” Sirius trailed off again. “Where exactly did you grow up?”
Maybe that was about to change. But not because of anyone with Competing Interests.
“Squibs can see things Muggles can’t,” Draco informed him distractedly. Then he waved his wand in a complicated pattern and muttered something in what Harry supposed was French. It was kind of hot, Draco muttering in French with his arse on display as he leaned toward the door. Then Draco reached out and opened the door, and Harry wasn’t thinking about anyone’s arse any more.
“Why, you…” began Vernon, digging his fingers into Harry’s shoulder.
So saying, he pushed Hari away just enough so that he could see as Sirius pulled the collar of his shirt aside. There, on the left, just below his collarbone, was a fairly large tattoo of a crest featuring a golden lion rampant on a crimson field. Below it, a golden ribbon held a word that must, Hari figured, be his name.
At the mention of his father, Scorpius squeaked again. Al leaned over and kissed his cheek.
“Of course you know. In fact,

When they were in the cab, Harry took a moment to send a quick text to Draco (having exchanged numbers with him on his way out the door that morning).

Harry stared at him.
“And that is why you have come to me?” Dumbledore asked. Draco was wracked with another fit of sobs. “Now, now, dear boy, now, now, none of that. You will be all right. You have made the right choice.”
“You sound like a Hufflepuff,” Harry told him.
Draco calmed him by laying a hand on his thigh.
“It is, rather,” said Harry irritably. “I was there.”
“This--shirt--is--hideous,” Draco had muttered between kisses.
Hermione arrived first--and, to throw a spanner in the works, Ron had insisted on coming with her. Grim-faced, he presented Harry with a bottle of wine.

“That’s the mystery,” Draco said thoughtfully. “I haven’t had much time to think it over myself, but I have a few guesses. You’ve never done magic, have you? Made anything happen that you couldn’t explain?”
“O...kay?” Harry prompted.
There was another snort from behind Voldemort’s chair.
“My Lord,” Draco said, greeting Voldemort with an exaggerated courtly bow.
. I guess I want to take my time. But then I’m worried, because it doesn’t feel like we
At that, Harry slammed his drink down and stood.
“I mean to drink,” Harry clarified.
“And,” Scorpius’ father added, “the same invitation stands for Albus, and his family.” He gave a formal nod, which Mr. Potter responded to with a huge smile.
“Well?” Draco prompted after taking a sip.
“Good.”
“No,” said Harry thinly, “I mean you
It was Luna’s keening laughter that broke the silence, but they both followed after her easily enough.
“It’s just—you always have to bloody upstage me, don’t you?”
“Yeah. Don’t know what I’ll say when I see her, though.”
“Can you set it on fire?” Harry asked curiously.
In the momentary pause, Harry could hear Dennis’ scandalized gasp.
“Seems to be a lot of that going around these days,” Sirius acknowledged, still wearing a distant expression as he petted Lump, who was once again purring.
“There’s—” he cleared his throat. “There’s something I’d like to speak to both of you about.”
Hermione, and with her every windmill she tilted at.
“I know, but--”
“Has it?” said Voldemort with interest.
Subject: your very helpful advice
“Lied how?” Draco questioned casually.
“Oh,” said Amy, her laughter abruptly cutting off. “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry.”
“That’s all right, Dad,” said Lily, “It’s been ages. Do we know him?”
“It’s a...difficult situation,” said Harry. He took a sip of his tea in the manner one might create a diversion in a battle. “See, my heart is in turmoil, but so is my cock.”
Meanwhile, Draco was using his surprising flexibility (the Dark Lord was very into yoga, and made all his Death Eaters participate in daily sessions) to move one socked foot up Harry’s thigh, inching ever closer to where he most wanted to be. After a few tense moments of silence at the table, Harry let out a very small squeaking noise, and Draco withdrew his foot and slipped his shoe back on, his work done.
“Sorry.” Draco paused, then started again. “I didn’t mean that about you. I--like you, Potter.”
“Oh, Harry.”
Draco sighed. “Welcome to life on the run. It can be rather uncomfortable at times, but fortunately two of the three of us are excessively wealthy, which ought to cut down on the inconvenience.”
“You set me up?”
“I didn’t prepare a statement.”
“Um,” he said.
“Sounds delightful. Have at it then.”
“Wow,” said Ginny. “Wood owes me fifty quid.”
Oh yes. This would do. But now what? Attack, or make Harry wait?
“You will both do whatever is required,” Lucius snapped, “and the Dark Lord will provide.”
Harry took a sip of his pint. It was dreadful, as it always was at the Hog’s Head.
After that they’d go to the clubs together occasionally, never touching each other, merely talking until the drinks kicked in and they could go find someone else to get off with. Then there began to be occasional coffees during the day. That had been the status quo—an uneasy friendship—until that night at the Burrow.
“We’ve chosen our House colors for each other,” Harry pointed out.
“You think I don’t know how that feels?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, his voice too thick to be believable, “’M okay.”
But Ron wasn’t quiet, and he had nothing to hide from Harry.
“What’s wrong with that?” asked Draco.
Hagrid, and with him the beasts.
And, oh! Harry was at his mercy. Draco could do whatever he liked. He could tie Harry down and fuck him hard until he was so hoarse from screaming that no sound came out when he opened his mouth to beg. Or he could stand here and kiss him softly for hours, then leave him aching without permission to do a thing about it.
“Look, Harry, this is...this is monu-fucking-mental. We need to talk about it, however you feel about me right now.”
“It’s all I’ve ever dreamt of,” said Draco.
“That can be dangerous, though,” Hermione said to Luna, ignoring Ginny. “Sex can create affectionate feelings that aren’t necessarily warranted. In some cases, that’s why--”
Potter didn’t seem inclined to continue the conversation further. That was all right; neither was Draco. He had some thinking to do.
“Yes,” said Hermione tartly, “and while we’re at it, where have you been? All that you went through yesterday, and then hardly a word from you!”
quite late, because at that moment Sirius’ conjured cupboard felt it was an appropriate time to reappear.
Ron gave her an incredulous look. “She doesn’t?”
Draco pondered this. He’d always assumed that Potter’s little side projects in school--exposing corrupt professors, challenging ‘unfair’ school rules, campaigning for better benefits for the janitorial staff--had been animated entirely by Granger’s stubborn competence. It was, however, entirely possible that Harry’s top-heavy sense of justice and his tendency toward obsession had contributed just as much. Though Draco would persist in believing that Weasley, at least, had just been riding Granger’s coat-tails. That man was such a follower, he could toady for England.
“Oh, Harry,” she sighed, pity in her voice. “Why don’t you just tell me what happened?”
“Wait, so,” said Ron, eyebrows drawn together, “If you’re getting married...which one’s best man? Me or Hermione?”
“Sorry?”
Ron came last.
Draco examined his manicured nails. “No living with the middle classes, is there, My Lord?”
“Scorpius,” said his father, nudging his shoulder, “have you wished your friends happy Christmas?”
“It was supposed to be
So it was that on Sunday afternoon, Harry and Draco stood in the jeweler’s shop, admiring their new rings, which were simply but beautifully crafted and fit perfectly.
Nothing.
“Aye.” Hagrid looked proudly at his dog. “Fang’s nasty in a pinch. ‘E bloodied Trog more’n half to death. Jus’ not all the way.” Hagrid sipped his ale. “Nursed ‘im back myself, I did. Thought ‘e was a goner for a while there. Almos’ gave up. But ‘e found summat in him--summat that kept ‘im fightin’. It wasn’ a nice summat.”
“No, Ron! I don’t think you know how it feels when your own life doesn’t belong to you. Your own
“We’re talking about--what now? The secret organization that lost touch with Draco?” Harry asked.
“Perhaps it would be an allowable inconvenience,” Voldemort mused, “if we could be certain that Dumbledore would not discover the ruse.”
“Let’s eat,” he said. Draco led them through the streets, constantly looking over his shoulder to make certain they hadn’t lost track of him. His concerns were not unfounded. Twice Amy and Harry bumped into each other, so distracted were they by the sights, and once Amy almost lost hold of Lump when a woman passed them followed by a neat, orderly line of rats in tiny capes.
“Harold,” said Mr. Chatwal in apparent surprise, “What brings you here?”
Draco stared at Harry, his expression an insulting mix of pity and disbelief. Harry knew where Draco was coming from, though. It was hard, when one was in Tom’s clutches, to believe anything that was said against him.
“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, blushing, “I guess there are.”
“Look,” said Harry, dunking his hobnob aggressively into his tea, “You can make fun of me later, God knows I’d do the same in your position, but for now will you lot help me figure out what the
“You’re a loon,” he said, “but you’ll never get rid of us. It’s Mum you have to worry about.”
Harry could only jerk his head in some startled approximation of a nod.
Angelina came down the stairs. “Oh, are we talking about—”
“Oh,” said Harry. “If I’d realized this was an ambush, I would have dressed for it.”
“Admit it,” said Harry with a laugh, “you just want to mark your territory in front of Molly and the rest of the Weasleys.”
“‘M here,” Harry said. Sirius grasped his shoulders and stepped back to look at him. It was an intense look; Sirius’ eyes were an unyielding gray.
In which Draco goes into the office, and is only slightly tipsy.  Has he had a personality transplant, or is something darker afoot?
“Well,” said Pansy pointedly.
the time. It’s more complicated than just catching them red-handed. In this case, the victims are the marginalized, and the criminals have privilege on their side.”
“You’re the one who punched the guy,” Ron pointed out.
“If you’ll have me,” said Harry coyly.
“Jesus
“Draco,” said Theo with great disappointment, “of course I do. I run them.”
“Certainly,” Hermione responded sarcastically. “Let’s just all knock on Lucius Malfoy’s door and see if he’s suddenly developed a soft spot for the underprivileged kids whose welfare benefits he’s consistently lobbying to cut while he tries to reduce the taxation of his multi-billion-dollar corporation. I’m sure that’ll go well.”
“All right. Here, I’ll even contribute. Blaise and Pansy have not quite been complete twats.”
“--My grandmother?” Harry asked.
“All right.” Harry took a sip of his tea, and, two cups later, they were all caught up to speed.
“You!” he spat furiously.
“No,” said Harry patiently, “what it explains is how I acted the times I
“Will you write to Molly?” Neville asked.
Mr. Malfoy. Second Malfoy of Messrs Malfoy. You know.”
Tom turned and went back into the apartment with barely a further glance. Draco lagged behind a bit, then made his way to the bedroom to dress. As he did, he stared at the locket, which hung on a nail above Tom’s dresser, the only piece of decor to grace the yellowish-white walls. It was an ugly thing, really, a hunk of malformed gold inlaid with crudely cut emeralds. It was old, granted, probably the sort of thing that should be rotting in some museum’s undisplayed collections. It was all Tom had of his mother, the last inbred scion of the Gaunts, the family itself a long-rotted twig of the British nobility. She had been descended, she claimed, from the great Elizabethan courtier the Earl of Slytherin, whence the locket. Of course, it could be an erroneous claim. Probably was. The Slytherin earldom was long since disbanded, its manor absorbed into another noble family’s holdings. In fact, Hogwarts Hall now belonged to Harry’s family. Perhaps that was what Tom had seen in him, Draco mused, considering the man didn’t have many other redeeming qualities.
“Harry,” Draco said, “We can do this.”

“It just makes me wonder. Draco was fucking Tom the whole time, right? I wonder...he couldn’t have been like this with Tom, right? Tom wouldn’t...I mean…”
“Maybe,” Harry shrugged, “but so have I.”
“At first I thought Harry was only an exceptionally charismatic Muggle, but eventually it came out that he was, in fact,
“Rather,” Theo agreed, rolling his eyes. He pressed an unlabeled button and they began to descend. “So what brings you down here? You’ve never expressed an interest before.”
“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry.
“Not always,” said Draco, slightly emphasizing the latter word.
“Mate!” said Ron.
“All right,” said Harry, some smoke escaping his mouth with the words, “I think we’re nearly pissed enough to listen to whatever it is you have to say.”
“Harry,” he said, “I appreciate your dedication, but you look like shit. Go home and rest.”
