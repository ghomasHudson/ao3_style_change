"Ready?" Harry asked Draco who had made himself quite at home on the bed. Not getting an answer, Harry asked again. Draco reacted by making a noncommittal sound.
Andromeda's house wasn't big. The garden was immense but the house itself was tiny, especially considering Andromeda's upbringing. The first floor only held an entry with a closet, a small living room and the kitchen.
"It's a necessary thing, Harry. The longer we wait, the longer it take," Having said that, Draco left Harry with all the bags. "I'm going to get more stuff, goodbye."
It was true, this one, although much better hidden in such a deserted place, was merely dropped into a pile. "I told Mrs. Dell'elion. I think we'll need to do so again."
Harry laughed brightly and breathlessly happy when he saw who exactly got him out. Even if he was a blur, Harry recognised him always. There was Ron Weasley smiling, cheekily so, for the roles of saving had been reversed and Harry jumped onto him, hugging him tight.
Harry didn't answer but fumbled a bit to get the right angle and no sooner then the photo was snapped did Charlie, once again, continued to drag Harry along.
Andromeda checked the clock once more with a sigh and wished she had a way to contact them. Her old bones begged for bed and just then, she heard the heavy rumble of Draco's car and she snapped up, striding towards her front door fast.
"He's homeless," She said, a little surprised. "I'm well aware Lucius is a bastard but throwing his sons future for a mere title, that is egoistic and arrogant above all else."
Harry shook his hand, they shared introductions while Shelley and Silas slowly clapped for it finally happened. As soon as they were done, Solomon turned, flipped the bird at his family and lay back down on the couch. With a flick of his wand, the cloak settled back over him.
Harry disappeared out of the room, took the magazines from the desk and unceremoniously dropped them onto Draco's head. "That'll shut you up for a while, no?"
He meticulously went through each item and debated whether or not to bring his supply of quills, ink and parchment but decided against it. He would see what the post office at his destination had to offer and hoped they had some postcards with pretty pictures to send.
"What the hell are Aurors doing here?" Draco spoke in low tones, his blood running cold. With one word, he understood Harry's need to keep quiet. He was doubtful they were for him judging by Harry's undiluted fear. He fought the urge for silence and hiding, all the times he had been chased out of the wizarding world by Aurors flashed though his mind.
How she knew, he would never know, but the gift was most appreciated. Harry showed it to Andromeda and Draco, who too, liked it very much. Then, he opened the last gift; Draco's gift. Sure enough he'd given him the book as he said he would but also had given him a small camera. When Harry was studying it in awe, Draco grinned. "Thought a sappy Gryffindor would like to snap some photos to show back home, was I right?"
The Ministry visit was a mess. The moment they came out the floo, they noticed something was amiss. The Atrium was filled with people, shouting loud. Two small groups had formed by the fountain and they were fighting. Most of the people stagnating the Atrium were mere onlookers but Aurors kept them moving while they kept an eye out on the two groups. As it were, their fight could be classified as a loud argument and so they had no right on stepping in. Not yet anyway. It seemed as if the situation could escalate any time now.
"Ahh.. Shut it." Harry accidentally blurted out, scrambling back upon it immediately with excuses before mumbling that they survived last time falling. Under the impression that the books should be able to handle another fall he picked up a small book and showed it to Draco: "Could it be this one that managed this wreck?"
"That's it?" Harry said confused. He sort of hoped there would be immediate action taken. Who knew what those bottles held, and what it did. He felt uneasy leaving it as it was until the morning. In all honesty, Harry felt some anger rise. He never liked the hands-off attitude of not in my garden, not my problem, find someone else to bother style.
"Hey four-eyes, how's life?" The man clad in a crisp black button up and dark blue slacks said, a grin on his face. "I've brought coffee, magazines and lunch, call me perfect."
"The arsehole keeps blowing up muggle stuff, Its a pain to deal with and we're on the mission of-" Ron started.
"Throughout the years, the Sanctuary has build quite the name and every few months or so, we are approached to capture a Dragon creating havoc in some or another country."
"Oh, you wouldn't believe what it!" Charlie said, smiling brightly. He set the watering can on the table and began enthusiastically telling. "We have a rather moody dragon on our hands, the Swedish Short-Snout female is close to heat, so went searching for a male and she decided that my mate was too much a bother, and swept him off his broom with her tail."
"We can offer you am desk job in different places of our department or various short school programs to become a trainer for incoming new blood. We can help you look further past our department to find you a job," He put the clipboard aside. "That's all. We're sorry. We know you want to be an Auror but for you, it's impossible."
"What's that?" Charlie asked, taking a step to the side and crouching down. Their laughter gone, Harry went over. He looked over Charlie's shoulder and frowned while Charlie grabbed a stick to poke at it.
Draco, assigned to hand out the presents, strolled back and from the tree to create four piles. He seemed extremely pleased with his haul, the biggest pile. He received mostly books but also pair of quidditch gloves, and some sweets. Harry briefly wondered how he could stomach those peppermint quills but Draco was delighted. He immediately broke of a piece and popped it in his mouth. With only two gifts left, he made Teddy pick which to open first.
He started lightly when Draco dropped his head on his shoulder but he didn't move away, instead he leaned his own head atop of the blond and swished the blade again and again - never quite enough, never deep enough but it worked. Sort off. If only it could be more.
"Offices," Charlie waved it away and made Harry follow again. "Research, labs, those kind of things, there goes a lot into running this place. We Dragon Handlers wouldn't know what to do if there aren't people keeping track and figuring it out for us."
"Welcome." Harry smiled and opened the rest of his gifts. There were more sweets from the rest of his dorm mates, and onea from Luna Lovegood. Harry was surprised to see a gift from her, and was glad he had sent her a gift of his own in the form of a fairy snow globe. She'd send him a journal. Bound with fabric, it had a clasp with a little lock, and his first name was on the front. She'd probably done some nifty spellwork to get the ornate golden letters there. When he opened the journal, he expected blank pages but Luna left him a message on the first page.
"W-why are you bothering with the door when you can use the window?" Draco raised his eyebrow and folded his arms. "How illogic are you?"
Charlie had taken his own 'd tapped one of the glasses with his finger to have it filled up and took a hold of it when it was still floating. He absentmindedly took a sip and settled it next to his plate, scanning the menu. He was obviously looking for something. "They change it every other day," Charlie said and ran his fingers along the lines. "I was hoping they have my favorite dish today."
Many a times Harry asked himself these questions. Maybe they all asked the same things or maybe they all had a slightly different answer, he just was at a loss and failed to understand. He needed to understand. Even now, as he sat down on the ledge of the Astronomy tower, legs dropped over the edge swinging back and forth. Every once in a while Harry shook his head to try and rid the feeling of being watched and forcing himself to stay put and not plummet himself into the touching nothingness, miles and miles down to the ground.
That morning, Andromeda kept watch over Teddy as he was playing outside. She had taken a seat on the porch, smiling slightly as she saw Draco with Harry in tow step into the blonde's car and pull out, leaving her land and turning up the road. The motor roared and within seconds they disappeared out of her sight.
The door opened unexpectedly and Harry toppled backwards, only to be stopped as he tumbled into a pair of legs. He blinked and looked up: "Please?"
"Sorry," Draco said carelessly and in a more sincere tone he continued while staring down. "I am happy for you, see, you didn't need to entertain your inner-Granger this morning, I knew you would do fine."
"Oh Merlin, that again," Solomon straightened while he sighed and dropped his hand. He sounded overly bored, dragging his words. "I know. One is blue, the other purple and way too bright."
Draco had to fight the pain in his back and the needle pricking him with every odd movement. He would muscle through it. Draco took a deep breath, only opened the door far enough to slid himself through the gap and blocked everything behind him out of sight. One look at the Aurors and Draco inwardly winced but he drew on his fake smile and brought out the best sarcasm. "Aurors Weasley and Weasley," He threw open his arms as if to welcome them then folded them and sat on the edge of the desk, locking his ankles and feigning a relaxed state. The desk was obviously rifled through, Draco noted. The almost full coffee cups they abandoned earlier were put next together on the edge, the picture frame was straightened and the horn from the telephone was off its holder. He ignored it in favor of keeping his eyes on the Aurors.
Harry winced and self conscious, he looked down at his attire. He'd chosen three quarter pants in a light brown colour and a yellow tee, a cap on his head and he'd taken a handheld camera for picture taking with him. Since it was new, he was afraid to damage it he thought around his neck was the safest bet. Harry flushed, he even sported the enormous bag pack to match. He may have indeed dressed like a tourist but he was so overexcited to leave England for the first time and enjoy a sunny, hot country that his embarrassment was quickly gone and he cheekily said, "Well, I am one. Got to look the part!"
Ginny slapped a hand for her brothers mouth. "He'll be wanted for attempt of breaking the Statue of Secrecy so make sure he'll get those papers."
Most eager he was to bring his set of Auror books and some additional works related to the study, even if, he wasn't accepted and his dream was crushed. Harry still very much wanted to learn all about it just because of his immense interest of everything that enveloped being an Auror. He decided that when he came back, he would look into what directions were possible for him that would draw on the same subjects. In the meantime, he would study ahead and thus the books were first to be packed, just in case.
"I sometimes forget you grew up as a muggle." Draco answered to that. "So what are you going to do with it, you're not planning to go there?"
"I'm not," Harry yawned, not wearing a coat yet but he laughed and pointed at Teddy. "Captain One-eye is though."
"At the corner shop, dear." She said and looked at him with a small smile. "My husband started to provide the service when the shop in town closed."
"However, everyone banded together to get me off as much as possible. They love me, really," He winked and got up. "So I only have the short runs this week."
Charlie nodded and motioned Harry to follow him through a small door wedged between the bathroom wall and the kitchen. They stepped into a small glass greenhouse attached to the backside of the house over its entire length. On the right, more potted plants and a lounge chair. On the left side, stood a single bed and a dresser. The glass was covered in small strips of fabric from the ceiling along the sloped panes down to the floor. Mostly a handful of different yellow tones but also some light green and blue mixed in. It hung like bound together curtains in the opening to the small space and Harry loved it. "This is, well, unexpectedly.. Lets say, Beautiful. Yea." He muttered softly.
Reaching the house, Harry knew his plans were about to change. Charlie sat on the front step, a broom set against the wall beside him and he grinned when he spotted Harry, holding the camera he was after up in the air. Already on a jog, Harrys notched his speed up, running as fast as he could with a questionable look on his face.
Harry who had handed Teddy over, smiled and followed Andromeda, curious as to why they went into the study.
All the rooms were done in clinical white. In the front room, Harry had covered the lengthy wall in a disarray of polaroid photo's of his body art work. There were thank-you notes and even some cut-outs from where is work had been featured in magazines, the making of the wall piece took him a few years to build.
"Look like they're fixing things, darling," She whispered and handed Teddy a toy. "They're good and sometimes sweet.. Just like you."
"Well, thanks I guess," Harry his happy mood was dampened a bit by the lack of enthusiasm of the blond and went trough the house to find Andromeda.
Straight no's, hesitant no's, maybe's after opening, some after reading turned no's; endless streaks of no's and maybe's, Harry felt tousled, hoping on a yes. Book after book ended up on piles scattered around. The stacks growing slowly higher with disregarded books that couldn't be the cause. At least Draco's anger had simmered away and was just plain displeased.
Harry came in much slower and did bother to greet her as he made his way to the kitchen. She followed and they sat down, a flick of the wand had tea being made and floating onto the table.
Of course they knew that. They all knew Remus Lupin and what a lovely man he had been but those rational thoughts fell in an empty void when they had been eyewitnesses to Fenrir Greybacks' brutal slaughtering. They stood mere meters away, watching how he mercilessly clawed, ripped Lavender Brown apart. He had left her in pieces and smiled - Smiled while her blood was dripping off his face and winked, running up and towards his next victim and nobody, not even the three Aurors that engaged in fight with him could stop the beast.
Harry explained about the potion bottle circle he'd found in the front garden. "It looks about the same, not as neat though."
"I'm here to represent the owner," He answered Ginny and looked at Ron full of distain. "I am here handling the affairs for the day."
"Honestly," He sighed. "There's a lot of bad blood between us. One car ride will not correct what animosity we created between us but I can, we got to the point where we can be civil."
"I can walk myself." Harry sputtered but Charlie gave no heed. He stomped straight through the garden instead of going over the path and didn't seem to mind the loud bang when he threw open the front door.
It were six days later when Harry pulled the library door closed, saw Hermione out and vowed to himself that he never ever would set another step into the damn place.
"Registered and taxed," Charlie sighed. "I sell my harvest at the Apothecary in town, and they sell it to customers and other shops around the world."
"Its," Andromeda started and Harry cut in. "Home. Its home and thats where I want to be. Hogwarts isn't home anymore."
"If you want to take a load off, then none of us shall stop you," Bernadette got up and shuffled back to her desk, she grabbed something and came back. "Here." She handed Harry a card.
Immediately frantic, Draco rushed to Harry. Any moment, both Aurors would co e to the same conclusion as he had; Harry being responsible for the sudden storm. When he threw open the door and pulled away the sheets, he saw Harry still in the same spot. Only now, he held an odd stone in one hand and his wand in the other. The runes Draco couldn't decipher on the stone glowed bright and Harry was mumbling.
"That's Silas Soul," Charlie pointed and the guy broke his conversation briefly for a quick smile and wave. "The girl is his niece, Shelley. There are our administrators."
Harry thoroughly enjoyed eating at the employee diner. He had fun talking with Charlie over everything and nothing while they ate, had desserts and a pint of butterbeer afterwards. The room remained busy and several people stopped by their table to introduce themselves to Harry, and make small talk or exchange gossip with Charlie.
The same happened during Potions. The teacher decided to introduce them to the newest study objects within the ministry and gave note of wanting a discussing about it. The man hit home with a sucker punch to the gut when the potion in question turned out to be a liquefied form of the Cruciatus curse. They all, one by one, had seen the unforgivables, all three, but even with the numerous horrible and painful spells the Death Eaters used they all had personal experiences with the curse the teacher spoke of, mentioning it as if they barely knew what it did. As one, they stood and left the class room - only to be tapped on the fingers later.
Suddenly, someone burst through the crowd and two hands slipped under his armpits to pull him onto his feet. Harry could not see who it was, but grateful nonetheless, as he was pushed through and away from the crowd into a back alley.
"Now Harry, you can go in and out of the gate, the garden, my quarters and the public places of the building as well as some other spots I'll show you but you never, ever, ever! Can go into the Sanctuary alone, nor can you go into the nursery building alone or intrude unto other people's work spaces.. And houses obviously. I have you admitted as my long term guest and I rather not see any of my rights evoked or lose my job, you hear?"
During dinner, Draco asked Harry if he could check the maps too, as he was joining in a road trip, the might as well see if there were places that tickled his fancy when Andromeda smiled, secretly pleased.
Most Aurors had cleared the floor by now. Petrified people were dragged into a line. They worked fast and one of them came up to Harry. The man, large and broad zoned in on him, the glint in brown eyes shining determined.
Harry stood still beside the bed, hand on his bag. A little frozen and eyebrows raised as he processed what he just saw. While Charlie wasn't as tall as most men in the Weasley family, nor as broad shouldered, it still was very, very weird to see an adult men skip. Harry whispered to himself. "He did that, he did," A little louder, he answered Charlie. "No unpacking right now?"
"Think about it, alright?" The man droned on, already on his way to open up the door of his office to let Harry out. "You can owl me anytime, with any question."
Bernadette shook her head, grey curls dancing. "Come sit," She waved at the little sitting area. "Allow me to explain a little further."
Draco was about to tell Harry he had a nice place but the thunk next to him foiled it. He ran a hand over his face. Here he was, drenched and windswept completely wrecked after the ordeal he hadn't even began to process and Harry fainted.
Draco made his way inside, carefully not to step on anything and leaned over Harry who tensed at the sudden intrusion of personal space. Draco put down his hands on either side of the black-haired wizard who was seated at the desk, peering at a map and stared at it too. Harry just gave him a side-away up glance and turned his attention back on the writings he was trying to decipher before Draco came in. Sighing, he uttered, a bit upset. "Hello Mr. Chuck a congrats and shrug."
Harry huffed, leaned his head against the wall and pouted. Not fair, he had tried, he did. Stupid door just wouldn't give in. He gave the door another kick when Draco's comment came through. "Are you pouting?!"
"He did." Andromeda answered and turned to leave. "I'll leave you to it. They're yours now. Add, erase or discard as you wish, but, I do remember you saying-"
"You quit!" Draco yelled slightly frustrated. Harry on the other side glared. "After I finished the door breaking course!"
"We allow them as long as those that can keep their population under control and don't interfere with our work." Charlie said and then they were ready for kick-off.
"Erhm.. Sorry?" He winced with a deer caught in the headlight face and she winked, turning back to her tea making.
Right beneath his feet was a circle of potion vials, corks unscrewed and dripping onto the ground. The grass was sizzling and most of the insects close gave it a wide berth. He found it odd. He wondered if it was supposed to be there, it seemed so out of place. At first, he reached out but knowing how dangerous a move that could be, he resolutely turned around. He better ask Mrs. Dell'elion.
He always has the Marauders Map at the ready- rounding another corner, walking another mile, running past classes and from the lights into the shadows - nowhere to hide, yet, he keeps going all the while wondering; trying and failing to understand why he is here. Here at Hogwarts when he could be anywhere else, searching for that one place he might feel safe and secure, already knowing he can't find it in the castle. Or maybe he can, maybe he hasn't searched well enough. Still. He doesn't get why he is here or maybe he does. It was all because the school board decided they, seventh years who didn't graduate, must be back - were forced back to complete their schooling and find a place in life.
Harry let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and kissed the toddler on top of his brown curls, who was still happily gurgling in his hold and messing up his clothes in the process and Harry smiled, putting the toddler back into his seat and watched as Teddy immediately attacked the bowl again.
"Hello?" Draco tried and even gave a wave but Harry simply went through the motions and didn't reply until he presented Teddy with his bowl of mushy fruit with little chunks of baby biscuits and a dab of milk.
Harry took over feeding Teddy, Draco caught the attention of a waitress to order food and drinks for the table while Andromeda went over the bags they brought in to see if they hadn't made any mistakes.
Harry burst into the house, looking distinctively better and waving some papers with a huge smile on his face. "Made it!"
Harry wasn't. Ultimately, he was one of the very few stuck in the downward spiral he build and couldn't get out of. Some noticed, others not but he didn't accept the outstretched hands. Harry never bothered to acknowledge, never gave himself the time to watch, see, heal and Hermione reasoned that may be why he pulled closer to his once schoolyard enemy. The other broken boy in their year who couldn't seem to care, to have the will to become better.
"Thought so." Draco poked some fun at him but Harry ignored it and waited until je was done. Eventually, they agreed on the bookstore as their first stop.
"Hey!" Harry objected. Draco just smirked and settled back, pulling the wrappings off as he did. Out came a card, plastic and square. Frowning, he read it.
"You look like death." Draco Malfoy remarked when Harry stepped into the kitchen, holding Teddy freshly washed and dressed on his arm. He gave no reply and settled the toddler into his high chair and moved onto the cabinets, pulling out packs and whatnot to prepare the boy breakfast and getting the coffee machine going.
The Aurors came, Harry panicked. He took charge and putting two and two together, discovered that Harry couldn't control his magic. He never meant to run. Harry had made him an unwilling accomplice. Sure, Harry was in trouble and he cared for it but right now, his main concern was what it would mean for him.
"I do, but seeing it firsthand is something new!" Harry said. Charlie slowly sped up again and Harry kept looking over his shoulder until the unicorn flock was well out of sight.
The wireless was softly playing Christmas songs, Teddy gurgled along, very clearly not on the beat but swayed happily from his spot on the couch. He had a present in his hand but opted to just turn and shake it instead of making any attempt to get the wrapping paper off.
Harry wanted to ask why he had such, in his eyes, unnecessary series but he thought the better of it; he didn't even want to know so he scooped another book up. "This one then?"
Andromeda pulled one map out and folded it open. "The map of Europe," She pointed at the corner and pulled a parchment note spellotaped to the back off. "Notes written with either some short comments, with, for example, learn language, learn culture or dangerous travel zone at the moment or simply notes of which places he would've liked to see or roads to ride which he also marked on the map itself. Sirius planned to travel the world, but, never did."
He looked at the door but only caught a peek of a red Auror robe disappearing out of sight. They were probably inspecting the desk. He looked away.
Hearing that, and seeing Charlie so uneasy, Harry took a deep breath, apologised and didn't say much after that.
All in all though, he had a nice little, shabby apartment he called home - a body art shop he found, funded and build up himself which was running quite famous as he held the patent on needle and wire art. A process comparable to embroidery, only on skin instead of fabric. The stitches tiny and ach knotted and cut, in case of accidental pulling out. Only then, one stitch would be lost and the rest of the art work would stay intact. He had created it himself, learning with trial and error how to perfect his art and learn which placing was better and which placings unsuitable. Up until this date, He remained the sole soul in the world who was allowed to make such art, patent was a wonderful thing, and people travelled from far, just to get such an uniquely done piece stitched on their skin. It was safe to say, Harry felt quite proud.
Right now, Harry was still sitting in the kitchen, nursing his cup of coffee and his headache. Draco had refused to give him a headache potion after seeing his memory and had been in the library ever since. Harry sighed, sipping at his cup, pondering how to make this back to good. He was aware their house was a mess; worse than prank stars could manage, with no counter curses to find or so he thought for the moment. He yet had to check for actual books with solutions and he knew that Draco had started looking in the wrong corner. Standing up, he was about to make another cup of coffee when he was jolted out of thoughts by a voice that could cut through knifes.
"I never seen it looking like this, I didn't think it would be so nice!" Harry answered, eyes darting from tree to tree and noting the vast difference in colour and decoration choices. It definitely wasn't coordinated. The chaos just added to the festive sphere.
There, under the sink she hadn't seen or thought about for so long, they were crammed underneath it.
Draco gaped. It all went down so fast. He saw Ron coming at them, arm stretched out and wand pointing clearly at them. Ginny stood aside. She pressed her wand against her badge, a summons, Draco realized when the pops of apparition sounded and a team of damage control came in. He looked over at Ginny again as she hadn't moved and he recognized the wand movements she made.
She was just rooms away from Zacharias Smith, he's being hit, time and time again with face reconstruction and healing spells to undo the damage done by a nameless low ranked Death Eater who left the boy upside down for dead in the mud - his face blown away - the sight of an erupting crater a more pleasant sight.
"Not what I expected, that's for sure." Harry said with a smile as he took his seat. He kept looking around. The room was busy. Dragon Handlers talked and laughed loud, with half their gear on, the rest beside their seat on the floor creating a tripping hazard nobody fell over anymore. While many people walked around, they all were used to the stuff by now. There were men in lab coats and some in robes, while others opted for muggle wear; some were reading books floating on eye level but most were socializing. They went from table to table, the groups around the room changing with the minute as they took their plates with them.
It took a moment for Draco to grab his bearing and when he did, he noticed the room. It, oddly enough, looked very similar to his own living room. A perfect mirror of his own open kitchen installed in the very same corner across the same front door he had, bar the clutter across the surface. The same wooden floor and the same small fireplace but here, instead of sleek dark brown furniture, everything was a mismatch of colours and looking overly comfortable and worn. A broom was mounted on the wall and at once, Draco knew where he was. The broom, a firebolt, he knew all too well was Harry's and so, he was at Harry's place. He scanned the room again, faded red on the walls, books about art everywhere and a snitch floated lazily around a potted plant which stood atop of a rickety dining table for two, it all made sense.
Ron roughly shoved the papers at him. Draco ripped them from him and sat down on the desk again, still glancing up at the red heads just in case, he checked the papers. There wasn't much. One being a copy of the owners buying rights, the other the lease of rent which was, to Draco's amazement not in Harry's name but in it of one Falkner Bellstone and the third a summons to the Ministry. Draco stacked them back up and held them raising an eyebrow in question.
They stood in front of the gate, a small corner shop just of to the side and in the distance Harry could see Sanctuary village. Right through the gate there was a large garden, complete with fountain and a wide variety of small animals with and without wings fluttering and roaming through the flower perks and the freshly mowed grass; most of it in the shadows of different trees. It stretched in front of a three story high building, which was a clean box with huge windows made of white bricks and wood. Behind the building, the mountains of the Sanctuary showed themselves and by the far away tops he saw small specks of bright colours, wings moving and he was absolutely stunned he was able to see the majestic dragons from his location.
Draco wasn't so sure. In all honesty, he preferred to turn and leave but Harry's ease numbed the feeling and he decided that, if Harry deemed it safe enough to press on, he should too. Surely, Harry wasn't that bad in judging.
"Lucky you," Harry said when he watched Charlie tap the plate with his wand to place his order. Harry glanced at the menu, spotted a dish from which the description sounded like a meatloaf of sorts and chose to order that. With their food on the way, Charlie explaining it may take a minute or ten, Harry leaned forward and said softly, as to not be overheard. "What's the deal with them?"
First things first. Draco dragged Harry to the worn light blue and white striped couch. Dragged, because Harry was too heavy to carry and he didn't dare to use his wand. If he could have thought rationally, which he didn't, he knew there was no trace on either him, or his wand. It meant he could perfectly well use it. But he didn't and so, did everything manually. With all the push and pulling he did, the stone Harry carried came out and left behind on the floor. Draco was too busy manhandling his friend, he never noticed. He left Harry beside the couch for a moment, so he could sweep the gaudy sequin pillows, yellow and orange, off the couch. Nevermind Harry was wet, Draco hauled him on the couch in one heavy heave. He grabbed the throw over he spied folded neatly underneath the coffee table and carelessly dropped it over Harry. He made sure all limbs were on the couch and went to find a towel. He didn't wish to venture into Harry's bedroom, so he took the cloth he saw lying on the kitchen counter. While not prefered, it did its job to towel off his hair.
Harry promptly chucked the book in Draco's basket who raised an eyebrow at him. "I'll pay for it myself when you finally go to the till."
Harry worked on Draco's back all morning, only taking a small break to gift a tongue piercing to a twenty-one year old. He turned out to be a quite excited guy who talked so much, it made Harry's job fairly hard to do, if not almost impossible. It was only because Draco, who hadn't bothered to get up from the bed snapping at the guy to shut him up that Harry was able to get the piercing in. When the guy left after paying they both knew much more about him then either men had ever wanted to know. Some people were awkward like that and Harry was gaining a lot of experience with it.
Maybe asleep - she prayed silently to Merlin, all the gods she could think of and even the devil that for the love of magic they were asleep but she had eyes; she saw Harry's ripped clothes, the blood that had, at one point, gushed but was now dried up and crusted up over his legs, arms, neck and back. It was Harry's blood that coloured the other boy in several places.
"Thank you." Charlie said shy and promptly gave Harry a hug, a clap on the back and swiftly turned on his heels, to skip inside. He whistled a tune and when Harry didn't follow immediately he called him. "Ready to go?"
He never tucked away his wand but kept it at the ready. He used his free hand to push Harry back, who initially refused to move but the Auror much stronger kept pushing. Harry's back hit the wall, standing and still struggling in the grasp, next to Draco. "Death eater riots." The man answered. "We've two fronts fighting about whether or not it was right to pardon Death Eaters."
"Let's go check if they cleaned it?" Harry asked by lack of anything better to say now his main idea was foiled. Charlie agreed. They got onto the broom again, Harry flying this time as he remembered exactly where it was. Even in the dark, Harry flew straight to it, and to his surprise, it was still there.
Harry felt his cheeks flush as he thought back to the moment they hit the ground beside the pen and he fell on his knees where he begged Charlie for another fly, as soon as possible.
Diagon Alley was beautiful. Absolutely stunning. Harry stopped midtrack as soon as he was through the brick wall and looked his eyes out. The street was close enough to being empty and just a handful of early risers had muddled steps on the fresh snow, a light mist still hovering from the cold as the first sunrays peeked through the clouds. The early morning smell of winter still clung strong in the air.
"Back then, we still had a lot of space and could move fairly free but around the 1900's rolled around, the magical community was pushed into corners and space became limited. The further muggles progress, the less freedom there is for us," He tapped Harry's camera. "Muggles got them, right now they're trying to implement them on little handheld phones. Every muggle will carry a camera and in the future the quality will only get better and wildly used. It'll hard to hide when an obliviate wont take the evidence away."
"Thank you." Harry said his goodbyes. He made quick work of getting in and out the shop, and made the decision of a little walk through the garden when he was instructed to come back in thirty minutes to pick up his photo.
They were shoving and pulling each other and laughing along the way, when Charlie gave Harry a particular hard shove. Harry was unable to keep his balance and staggered backwards until he landed flat on his back in the bushes. He groaned. Charlie came up to help him back onto his feet. He was still laughing as he apologized.
"Mrs. Dell'elion?" Harry started when he reached the front desk and she hummed in acknowledgement but didn't took her eyes of the papers she shuffled into stacks. "Do you know where I can have my photo printed?"
Lastly, Andromeda opened her presents. Most of the gifts were subscriptions to magazines, books and other inexpensive trinkets from associates and far friends, with lovely notes and well-wishes attached to them. Harry's present made her smile brightly and she thanked him twice while Draco's was a book on craft charms she'd been wanting to get but was sold out every time she looked for it, along with a new winter coat. "It's beautiful." She kissed the blond's hair when she stood and tried it on, making a swirl through the room when she showed it off.
"Another one.. of what?" Charlie asked who stopped his attempts and turned awkwardly to look at Harry.
It was well passed dinner and Andromeda Tonks sat on the couch where she was twiddling her thumbs, staring out of the window without as much of a blink. Every once in a while, she checked the clock and the hours were ticking away. By now, she knew, the potion in Harry must have ran its course and should be gone. The boys however, still weren't back. Suffice to say, she was worried. They hadn't replaced the emergency pen yet and it scared her, thus, she remained where she was, hoping they would be back soon, preferably with Harry still alive and in no immediate danger.
She pushed the door further open and called out in the dim lit room. "Harry?" And inched closer. "Draco?"
Draco stood, drew up to his full height and looked at him down his nose, completely ignoring Ginny. "I'll ask, nicely, what brings you here?"
"Harry!" She yelped, and as fast as she could make her way over to him. Draco, who had been watching, needed a moment but he raced over to his once school yard enemy and dropped on his knees next to his head. He did beat Andromeda's speed with ease. "Potter?" He questioned but he didn't give a sign of hearing. Draco called again, louder and slapped Harry on the cheek. "Harry?"
"Well, rumor has it they aren't one hundred percent human," Charlie shrugged. "Eitherway, they're good people, they're just a close knit family and a bit out of the ordinary. Although I second Solomon is a lot to handle when you first meet him."
Harry didn't even put up a fight in the first place but forgetting was obviously enough as the blonde wizard took that as a sign to generously whack and poke the other until he dropped the memory into a pensieve. Harry sighed, all the while hearing Draco's moping with his booze induced headache and about to smack back when he heard the blonde repeat the same thing trice: "Draco! I heard you!"
"Ours? Here in England we only have two real settlements. Diagon ally and Hogsmeade. Of course, Hogwarts, the Ministry and St. Mungo's Hospital are pretty much the rest of what makes up our world, since Britain has a very small wizarding population, especially after two wars. But, yes, that's basically all we have."
"Oh! New colours." Sounded with glee. Draco hadn't seen them up until now and Harry pinched the bridge of his nose as he had to take two more down. Armed with at least a dozen of numbers already, Harry knew the other wouldn't be leaving his shop anytime soon.
Charlie laughed and told Harry not to worry, she was just stressed at the moment but a rather nice person. "Also, over there," Charlie pointed to someone covered with a cloak in the corner. "That bag of bones is Solomon, Silas' twin. He's the tour guide."
"Don't bother," Draco grinned. "I shall have it wrapped and call it a day on finding you a suitable present."
Within seconds, Draco slumped, muscles giving in - his breath grew shallow and his heartbeat slowed greatly. The thing, his heart - although he was of the thought he didn't quite own one, the heartless bastard he was - it thumped in his chest just sluggishly pumping the blood through his veins. It was dangerously slow but he felt great. A smile was upon his face, showing just how much he was enjoying the feeling as his unsteady eyes tried to focus back on Harry, who in a rapid pace slashed numerous little cuts, relishing in his own hurt and the blood red colour finally real and there to touch - not just the unreal splash tugging at the corners of his eyes all the time as a bloody curse.
"Whether we want it or not, it would make Andy happy if we could at least fit through one door together. 'Sides.. " Draco mumbled almost unheard then. "As much as we might dislike each other, with that whole 'my heart isn't working' thing you've got going on for yourself, I don't want to be responsible may that happen. So."
Draco Malfoy sat on the navy blue couch across from Harry. He twiddled with the wand he wasn't supposed to own between his fingers. He briefly glanced down, seeing the red spot that marked his ban on magic on his wrist. He sighed, and twirled the wand again. Time ticked by, the storm kept brewing outside. Draco occasionally checked the time on the small clock above the hearth.
Charlie quickly pointed, naming the main items and slowly muttered, "Don't try to feed or water anything except yourself and, well, you may feed me of course. Though, do return books to their proper place and stay out of my bedroom.. Unless.." He lilted the last word and laughed. "Joke, joke."
Feeling sad, he stepped out the doors of the Ministry and stood atop of the three-step stairs, burying his hands deep in his pockets and chin against his chest, staring at his feet. "Well, that didn't go as planned." He mumbled and sighed.
The new year was a simple affair. Naps at noon, bite sized dishes amd dessert to snack on throuh the evening, and a splendid firework show. Harry was hesitant to light the fireworks he'd gotten, but the Weasley twins had not been lying. were just regular fireworks. They'd hugged and drank some good ol' meads while they talked in the livingroom before they'd headed to bed in the early hours.
Draco realised the house elf wouldn't do such a thing and rolled his eyes, balling his fists. "Forget that, just take Harry's wand away and hide it until I say he can get it back!"
Harry nodded. He knew as much, but that wasn't truly what he meant. "I don't know. They seem so.." He scratched the back of his head, trying to find the words to explain what he tried to convey. "Silas is too proper, so formal. Solomon is like this extreme bad boy and well, Shelley seems to be the most normal although so friendly but still standoffish. Something isn't right."
The door of the shop was pushed open, the small bell above it ringing, alerting the black haired man a potential customer had come in.
"We know." The Auror roared. "It's idiotic and a waste of time but opinions can be louder then logic."
"Nahh," Charlie answered. "Nobody working here got time for that. Their team is small and there aren't much people ready to devote their life to this demanding job."
Draco gulped and ready to snap back that he had earned his freedom but Harry beat him with a cry of indignation. "You've got to be kidding me! Stupid arse-"
They received a fair few odd looks from other shoppers and even a reporter from the Daily Prophet decided to poke for information about their lack of animosity. They replied in sync. "No comment."
The constant interrupting was grating on Harry's nerves, here was Draco explaining him important thing and people who had no business with them kept breaking his attention.
"Well, try better." Draco also stood up and swatted Harry on the back of his head. Harry muttered an ouch without too much heat. It was more or less an automatic response because it hadn't actually hurt. Draco sat back down on the couch. The wand that lay there rolled into the cushions. Absent-mindedly, he put it back in his pocket. "What will happen if the Aurors come and catch us?"
Draco examined the stone, an intricate piece of work, he realized. He would say, both his latin and rune-reading was fairly well but half of the words and symbols etched into the black stone were unfamiliar. Harry walked towards the window and pushed the curtains open. He saw the storm still going strong and his heart sunk. "As long as the stone is on my person when I need to discharge the overflow of magic, I can't be found and nothing worse but the weather is affected. If it's not on me while it happens.." He let the words die out and closed the curtains. Completely devastated, Harry slipped to the floor and hugged his knees.
"You what?!" Draco nearly shouted and Harry rubbed his temples, not wanting to make the other more mad than obviously showed he moved to sit on the desk, next to Draco's wand and told what happened; how he fell, got angry and used magic to finish the job. All the while trying to keep his own temper in check; fully well understanding that if Draco wasn't currently being hold in place by a chair and Draco's wand wasn't lying beside him but in reach of it's owner, he would have had hexed his balls off.
Once finished, he ate a light meal and got ready. He taken a little too much time and suddenly found himself needing to hurry. He planned on a leisure trip to the Ministry but instead went with the floo and hurried through the halls; with mere minutes to spare had his hand on an old boot, ready to be port-keyed away.
Draco blinked once, twice and pulled all his energy together to sit up - cupping Harry's chin and forcing them to look straight at each other. "No." He answered and pressed forward, making their lips meet in a soft kiss. A kiss he didn't need, his high prevented such feelings – any feelings, but knew it was one that the other asked for without saying it. A kiss desperately wanted.
Harry merely nodded and grabbed his wand, ready to levitate the top row out of the shelf when Draco called for Kreacher; making Harry turn in surprise, having the why question lying on the tip of his tongue. He didn't asked but decided to see instead. With a plop the house elf came in and bowed. "Master, yes?"
The shop roofs had been covered in snow during the night and the shop owners took great detail in their shop fronts, each decked out with colourful lights, baubles and full of christmas scenery. Decorated garlands strung from one building to another, criss-crossing above the street. Some shop owners had put up Christmas trees by their entrance, making people walk around them, never going straight. The first street vendors were unpacking, their merchandise all winter themed. Harry saw a small child building a snowman in the far distance. The parents, he assumed, sat on the small bench by the Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour sipping from mugs with hot liquid. He loved it.
Half an hour later Harry came stomping down the stairs. He carried several rolls of wrapping paper under his arm, along with supplies in a bag and levitated shopping bags in front of him. Andromeda raised an eyebrow when he came thundering into the living room.
She explained that, while there is no official capacity to investigate, once the gardener collected the offending material, he would have it analysed by the lab. "I've already sent an inquiry around the building to see if any of our employees know of the substances." From there, she said it would be an elimination. "If none of us know about it, and once we'll know what it is, we ask the town paper to publish it and ask anyone who knows something to come forward."
"Right good smacker he got!" Charlie came to sit next to Harry. but not before he danced through the room, reenacting how exactly his colleague got swiped, and landed. Charlie had to scramble up from the floor after.
The toddler smiled and took the toy, brambling in his own language but surely so, she thought, agreeing with her.
Andromeda sat, legs pulled up next to Teddy, nursing her hot coffee and occasionally tipping the present with her feet when it threatened to fall off the couch. Harry had taken the chair, lounging, and every now and then he peered out of the window in hopes that an owl would come carrying presents from Ron and Hermione.
"Ready to fly?" Charlie asked, the biggest smile on his face and Harry nodded enthusiastically, returning the smile with an equally bright one.
Harry gasped for breath when he shot up. Draco said nothing, and neither did Harry. Several minutes passed but Harry remained white in the face. He wasn't looking too good, Draco noted and the blond didn't stop the snort that came when Harry finally broke the silence when he wryly welcomed the blond into his house. They didn't speak at all after that. They sat there, each taken by their own thoughts.
Harry glanced at Draco who shrugged and then stared at the Auror. "No, we don't. There's been garbage written about me for years, so why would I?"
"What the bloody hell happened out there?" Ron asked wide eyed once Harry let go and started tucking Harry's clothes back in place. Harry let him, his lack of sight preventing him from doing it right anyway.
They came home and settled into the living room where they updated Andromeda. She listened quietly, bouncing Teddy on her lap as the boys rattled to her. When they were done, she sighed, a decision made. "I might've to describe to the Prophet again."
"The window's fine to use, a silencing charm holds itself well and who cares what colour the kitchen is?" Harry gave a smile and hugged Draco close. "It's nothing."
"It doesn't, and on the rare occasion it's something petty kids do," Charlie shrugged. "Parents just talk it out and punish their kids accordingly. Adults breaking laws just doesn't happen, really."
Harry, taken aback by the situation, just folded his arms and listened. He couldn't help the thought that if Mrs. Weasley would've heard, she'd washed his mouth out with soap. He was fairly sure.
"Whatever I say, this behaviour does not suit an Auror and despite my status, I am still within my rights to complaints about you lot to the Auror department," He shot right back, glaring dangerously. "I don't think you'll like having such a note in your file. It can still affect your job even if it comes from me. A
"Fair enough." Draco saw that the map of Australia also had landed in the pile together with the whole of Asia, Africa as well as Italy and Spain.
Right in front of the house stood a race model car in shiny Slytherin green. Harry grumbled under his breath as he watched a very familiar blonde boy step out. He growled. "Malfoy."
"I was dismissed before the first month was over," Harry replied and shook his head. "I wasn't a good fit for the job, that's why I left for the muggle world. I had enough of not fitting in."
Harry sighed deeply. He grabbed his coat, thanked the man and bid him farewell. On his way to leaving the building, he already had to dodge several press members, one of which he really, really rather not meet. Rita Skeeter had messed up enough for him in his past, no need to add to the future. The one thing was that, everything being said rang true and he understood the Auror departments choice about him all the more.
Harry smiled. "A mobile phone. We have to read the book together, because I don't know much about them either, but each mobile phone has its own series of numbers. Its a phone number, and you can call any number with it so you have a direct connection to talk."
"I'm having my motorcycle exam today." Harry answered and pushed his cup away. "I terrified of failing! What if I haven't studied enough?" He groaned and folded his arms on the table to let his head fall onto. "Is this what exam fright feels like?"
In an instant, a mob of reporters surrounded him. They moved too quick and came a little too close for comfort as one stepped on his fingers, another trampled his glasses to shatters and a third wasn't watching his footing and thus, a fairly large booted foot connected painfully with his ribs.
"No, not really, it's interesting because once in school I learned that at that space in the ocean a lot of ships disappeared and they, including the people on it were to never be seen again."
"It is, most countries don't have any Dragons free roaming left, we luckily were able to bring in the few left in assorted countries after a plea with their Ministry to pretty please not kill them but have us take them instead.
Harry winced. That stuff was horrible and if he could life his life without ever having to taste that vile concoction he'd die a happy man. He told Charlie his thoughts and the redhead laughed. "I know, I've had a few doses myself, always wondered why no potions master ever tried to make that stuff bearable is a mystery to me!"
It suited Harry just fine, although it was odd sometimes, he acknowledged that. They were on the other side of the same coin, they could understand each other more in depth then Harry's friends ever had, even if they shared most experiences with him. It was some kind of comfort hearing the other side of his suffering. Never mind the fact that Draco and Andromeda were the only ones he now could hold a conversation with, the letters between him and his friends at Hogwarts dwindling to almost nonexistence for all the explaining Harry did fell to deaf ears.
In the morning, Harry was still bleary eyed and yawning over a cup of steaming hot coffee and also very annoyed by the exciting chatter between Andromeda and Draco. He quickly learned that Draco loved shopping and was all for it. While his father had ensured he was homeless, he kept access to his own vault filled to the brim and had more then enough to spend. He was, to Harry's surprise, looking forward to get as many gifts as possible to hand out once Christmas came and went as far as calling dips on pushing the pram.
Charlie grabbed Harry again, who didn't have the time to put the paper away and made a beeline for the door behind Bernadette's desk but Harry put on the brakes. "What's over there?" He asked, pointing to the other side.
Couldn't they see, how could not one teacher see that Seamus clenched his quill to tightly, snapped several per class and cursed without sound every time his eyes fell to Dean's empty seat?
"Now, what are we going to do?" Draco asked, thinking of the previous options he thought up. It may not be too late to leave the idiot he was friends with behind. Then, he saw Harry. The man definitely was turning his gears, thinking of a plan. He hoped it was a good one. "We don't have all day." Draco hurried him.
They slipped and shuffled their way through the alley, Harry took Teddy out the pram and in delight bustled from shop to shop with the boy in his arms, showing, pointing and explaining, even when the boy clearly didn't understand, the decorations and kept of saying how nice it looked.
He mumbled something but Draco, couldn't quite follow, didn't quite hear, brain dotted with confusion. "What did you say?" He asked softly, slow and slurred speech and out of breath but Harry could follow perfectly.
"Why did you do that?!" Draco shrieked, flailing arms. "Those books are expensive, rare and old, Potter!"
"Yeah, it's pretty." Charlie acknowledged and quickly dragged Harry through the gate, muttering the password loud enough for Harry to hear as they went.
"That's Gavriil." Charlie laughed at the bickering and before he knew it, the man was back at the door and Charlie found himself admonished for laughing, still through the door which numbed the effect a fair bit.
True to her words, Harry only spent fifteen minutes of twiddling his thumbs, listening to the soft snores of Solomon who seemed to have fallen asleep and the fast scratching of Shelley's quill. Silas settled the cardboard box with supplies Harry asked for on the table in front of him. "This is as close to the size you asked for, if you want anything bigger, I'll put the request for funds in, and, if granted, will give you the money to buy them in town, that may take a day or so, though."
He questioned Harry about it. It seemed so specific and Harry shrugged. "I want to see Spain and Italy when its sunny and I think January is hardly the time to lay on a beach or go endless sightseeing."
Drack shrugged. "I don't know but if it did, it happened when I put your sorry arse on the couch," Draco waved in the direction of the front door, not one bit concerned. "It's probably somewhere over there. Between the door and the couch. Why?"
Draco moved to the corner where the mirrors were handing so he could see his back. He ordered Harry around, having him hold the wires at different patches of his back until he was fairly sure which colour he wanted where. Talking all the while, Harry now knew what the other wanted, down to the details. Even though done, Harry was still staring at it for a while, his finger tracing a simple blue flower on the left shoulder. The stiches there weren't quite even, the leaves all slightly different in size and the stitched crosses following the outer line were uneven. Still, tracing it fondly, he was certainly proud of that particular piece. It being the very first, as Draco had signed up to be his guinea pig at the time.
Harry raised his eyebrows, sure he saw its state already and was quick to deduct a building full of dragons would do a number on the build. He did however, ask Charlie while he stated the obvious.
"I told you it was a quick run!" Charlie shouted when Harry neared. "We're going to do something fun!"
Draco looked odd at his Aunt when she too, sat down with her own cup of coffee, already made by Harry previous. "Why would he be nervous?"
Andromeda watched them as Harry went on explaining and she smiled happily when they sat side by side, heads together, bowed over a small book to figure it all out. She let it go on for a while, just enjoying the sight. Now her attention elsewhere, she didn't notice Teddy drop his gift. The loud clap had everyone jump up, and Teddy cry for the loss of his shiny toy.
Andromeda sat on the couch. She levitated a low, flat basket off the shelf and with half an eye on Teddy, she made herself ready to do some crafts. She wanted to make some tiny paper flowers for Teddy's memory books. From the kitchen, she heard the boys murmur and knew they were stalling. "Wrapping takes time boys," She called out. "Get a move on."
"Anyway," Charlie went on. "We had to wrestle her into submission and place her in a different pen, while we have no male of her breed, we hope she'll find the male Blue Double-Tooths to her taste."
"Plebeian." He said but put the card aside gently. He went back to the box. He pulled another bundle of peppermint quills out of it, and then something he was unfamiliar with. A black headband with some odd ends on them. Along with them came a few more black pieces in odd shapes. "Excuse me, but, what is this?" He held it up.
Charlie said quarters. What he actually meant was a wooden block hut, affectionately named Peony Patch. The hut the tenth in a line of twelve, on the second row of seven. The paths were sandy and Charlie's home sported the tiniest of front garden and seeing the back of the first row, Harry was quite sure he also owned a back garden, a fairly large one at that.
Harry bit his lip and tapped his knee against Draco's and he tore his gaze away to lock it with Harry. With practiced ease, Draco pulled up his sleeve, the dark mark came in sight but neither looked at it, preferring to stare at each other. In silence, Draco wrapped a well used leather strap over his upper arm, and tore it, tight, successfully pinching of the blood flow. He raised the potion bottle and held it, ready to tip over above the crook of his elbow where the skin was already littered with little black points and faint blue veins. He raised a daring eyebrow at Harry.
On the right in the front room, a two person couch stood, acting as a waiting area. Not too long ago, he purchased a coffee machine and a small table to fit it on. He created a snug little corner complete with customised mugs, the floral design on them drawn himself.
Harry looked up, and caught Draco's eyes in the mirror. He flushed, Draco smirked and when Draco was about to make a, highly likely, scattering remark, Harry bested him to it. "Let's get this show on the road."
"Oh, I know," Andromeda answered light-heartedly as she had chosen that moment to step into the kitchen and Draco supressed a yelp, not expecting her. "Harry, are you nervous?"
They moved from window to window and Harry marvelled at each and every one. They held all sorts of dragons eggs, some alone and others a whole nest. Some eggs deep within the coal, other just laying on top and every enclosure was designed to appraise the sort dragon it held. There were forests of all sort, from an average English forest to rain and tropical and even one full of pine trees. A few were styled Sahara like, dunes of sand and Harry felt the heat from inside through the glass. There was also the opposite, full of snow, some enclosures dark and dank and even one resembled after the sea, a nest of eggs on top of a small rock splashed by tiny waves.
"It's yours," she continued. "But you have to get your drivers license, Sirius had to too and then you can go around, see the world, be a silly young man, do dumb things like teenagers are supposed to do and most of all, Dear, enjoy your life."
"Trademark of a young unicorn, you know that." Charlie almost scolded, but he too was smiling happily.
"Leave Teddy with Draco." Andromeda ordered when she stepped into the living room with Harry following. The blonde annoyed from being interrupted again sighed but dutifully took the toddler, settled him in the corner of the couch and levitated a book for him over. He caught it and handed it to Teddy who squealed and opened it, immediately, a soft voice coming from the book filled the room and guided Teddy through the pages.
At that, they rolled, over the weeks, into a routine. Harry would take care of Teddy in the mornings then go to his lessons and spend the rest of the night studying until it was time for Teddy to go to bed. After, he would either continue studying or write to his friends at Hogwarts - Just catching up with some, or arguing with others. Apparently, Hermione still couldn't grasp that Harry hadn't wanted to be locked up in the castle and study for N.E.W.T.S and Ron couldn't accept his best mate had left him to attend alone. He hated being stuck with just his studious girlfriend and no Harry to have fun with.
"She definitely has a gift for ear pulling," Harry answered and smiled as he spotted Teddy slurping up some red-ish goo who, in turn, smiled and gurgled his hello as he spotted Harry. Then, Teddy waved happily still holding his spoon and thus splattering the goo all ways. He smiled toothily again, as he noticed the effect of spoon waving and did it again. Harry walked up, kissed the tiny man on top of his head and sat down. "So what did you do to deserve it?"
Kreacher still didn't move but Harry straightened himself out, being smart enough to give his wand to the house elf realizing his mistake. "That was stupid, I know.. I get it. Sorry about that."
The mention of baby dragons wiped their conversation almost entirely from Harry's mind. "I'd love to!"
The blond had his eyes closed and to Hermione they looked oddly slumped together. Sagged bonelessly.
Harry stepped in, tapping the door closed with his foot and dropped his bag beside Draco. He removed his robe, his tie and peeled the buttons of his shirt open. He let himself fall down and scooted close to the other.
And now, he stumbled into her place after being chased by the pest. There, he saw Draco Malfoy. He caught the blonde in the act he had edged him onto doing so often and he smiled. The former junior Death Eater looked lovely in Harrys' opinion.
"Well," Andromeda started, drinking the final bit of her tea. "You two better learn to get along quick then because, if he cannot go home, he's bound to stay here and if he is staying here," She stood up and levitated your cup to the sink. "You get to share the attic. Goodnight."
Harry huffed and folded his arms as Draco grinned in amusement. "I see, Hermione was who told you that."
"Don't apologise, I understand but I rather have you paying attention for a bit," She smiled and waved her wand to clean the few drops of food fallen of Harry's plate when he juggled it. "I assume you want some input, or you might agree to things you prefer not to be included in Christmas."
It took Draco a moment to process what it happened but he knew. Harry had lost the stone a while ago and his magical signature could be read and so, his location could be found. "They already know who's the cause."
"It's really beautiful," Harry said full confidence. Harry was sure Mrs. Weasley never been at Charlie's home and neither had his younger siblings. He thought maybe Bill may have visited once or twice, considering how close the eldest brothers were. Though, Harry was quick to realise the importance his words held for Charlie. "I like it!"
Andromeda stood up and took Teddy to the living room. There, the tree was set up with shiny baubles, an enchanted angel on top, and a little train making rounds on the track around the base. Some simple garlands were strung up, and she had used some spells long forgotten. If she thought about it, the last time she used them was when her daughter had been a young child. Now she used those very same charms to make snow fall from the ceiling and dissolve just above head-height to entertain her daughter's son. Teddy loved it. She suppressed a loud laugh as the toddler wiggled to grab the snow he couldn't touch.
"Magical schools around the globe." Harry murmured and raised an eyebrow. "Well, that's interesting."
"Shut up," Ginny quipped, butting in before Ron could speak. "Why should he? You're not exactly behaving at your finest either but who would expect better from a death eater, huh?"
"Nice to meet you," Shelley said politely but never took her shocking bright blue eyes, the exact same colour her nephew sported, of the paper she studied. "Hope you'll have a good time here, we're swamped right now so no time for chitchat, thank you and goodbye."
As she said, so it went. Fully packed with bags, Harry arrived at the Leaky Cauldron, Draco mere paces in front of him as they navigated between the busy tables to the corner where Andromeda, many bags of her own, was sipping coffee and feeding Teddy crust-less bread.
Harry was taken aback by that, and the discomfort was clear. Silas dispelled it however, when he walked up to his twin and slapped the back of his head without a word. He turned to Harry apologetic. "Sorry, don't mind him," He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder towards Solomon. "He had a rough tour this morning."
Hearing the fire roar in the living room Harry took a deep a breath and put up his best face, giving his partner the smile he always got.
Andromeda didn't elaborate even though she saw their confused looks. She waved them to continue. Harry searched his small pile and sat next to Draco. "Let's see what she got us."
Drace knew he needed to calm down. He lay his wand on the low wooden table, sat straight and controlled his breathing. In and out. He was too unsettled. Slowly but surely, with each breath, he overcame the fear and confusion he felt. He kept his eyes closed until his mind stilled. Totally blank, he replayed what had happened.
Harry froze. As soon as Draco had burst, he calmed down and was ready to apologise for it but Harry beat him. "The stone collects most of my magic," Harry murmured. Draco had shocked him out of the impending panic attack. He found the stone and handed it to Draco. "It's also a scrambler. It makes my magical signature unreadable and lets it bounce about so my location isn't easily found."
Harry Potter yawned, another day, another early morning. Until he saw the time. Harry cursed, left his breakfast uneaten and dashed off, running through the streets because he was late for work. He always opened his shop at eight precise. Today, for the first time in a good while, he had to hurry. Out of breath, he slid the key in its slot and turned it. He waited patiently for the wired security gate to move up and pushed the glassed door open when the gate had clicked into its place above his head. By the time he clicked the lights on, he had caught his breath and flew over to the desk, where the phone was already ringing.
"What's it?" Draco asked and tried to catch Harry's eyes, who avoided his with all his might while he was motioning for Draco to keep hush.
Harry made his way towards the elevators, Draco following and then his shocking blond hair caught the eye of a man in the left group. Given the fact many gave him a berth, it wasn't hard to miss. Suddenly, a dozen or so wands were trained on his face and the right group started flinging spells at the left group. Bystanders ducked away, Aurors were yelling and springing into action while Harry jumped in front of him, arms wide.
"Basically." Harry agreed and pointed at the pieces. "One piece to talk into, it's a microphone and the other piece is a speaker, there comes sound out."
Harry turned around to tell Charlie exactly that because he knew Charlie hadn't heard him, being nice to give him some space as he put down his bag. Harry saw that Charlie was twiddling his thumbs, nervously scuffing his feet and anxiously waiting for Harry to give a sign of approval.
Then she stood up, shuffled out the room and came back holding a small item in her fist. Placing it on the table, Harry recognised it as Sirius Blacks' motorcycle.
"Fine!" Harry braced himself, slighty ashamed he looked the other straight in the eye. "I might have used magic on your damn books!"
"No we're not, I was denied," Harry slumped to the ground and sat with his back against the wall. "It's all too much. I need a vacation!"
The little patch in the front was overgrown with plants Harry vaguely remembered seeing in plant guide of his potions lessons. He assumed the pink-ish flowers dotted all around where the peonies he named the house after. However, Harry refrained from asking as Charlie's enthusiasm doubled with each step and already had his key for the front door ready.
Hermione and Ron though, didn't know everything because Harry and Draco Malfoy both had found their own way to cooperate with their demons. They edged each other on, sharing glances throughout the day until one or the other disappeared and late at night, when the eight years' common room was empty, they sat together; one or the other giving a knowing glance and a wicked smile came in an answer that said it all - I know what you did. There were well-aimed stares under the yellow glow of the flames of the fireplace. It being another wordless dare, another challenge. One would break under the pressure of the other, then, a kiss and they each vanished once again - going to their own hide-out in the castle and to their own created special little place of hell in their minds, each well on their road to the end.
Harry and Bernadette quickly exchanged introductions and then Charlie pointed to the left. They stood on a cross path of sorts. The floors made of light wood, the walls a soft yellow, plants and pictures of Dragon in abundance. It had a very homey feel on the inside for such a sleek looking building on the outside.
As the weeks went by and the clock slowly ticked time away, Harry started or rather, fell in a pattern where he started to care less and less. In a steady pace, following the ticks, he became less attached - to people, to rhythm, to reality. He became more and more withdrawn from the works of life around him. Slowly but surely he became shallow, a shell of his former self. He lost himself, locked up in the depth's of his own mind where the gruel, the horror and pain stood up front. The longer he went like this, the further he got until there was nothing of him left. Paranoia. Just a broken boy, running, hiding and hurting.
That evening, when they came back at the main building, Charlie almost flew straight up to Mrs. Dell'elion desk. Harry almost thought he had to warn Charlie that flying inside wouldn't be much appreciated when the redhead stopped by the backdoor. They jumped off and ran inside. Charlie was fast. Harry always thought he was an experienced runner but Charlie left him well behind. Once Harry reached the desk, he was fully expecting to see the old lady again but in her place was just a man passing from adult to elderly seeing the wrinkles and tufts of grey in black hair. Judging on the off blue uniform and metal badge, Harry thought he must be the security guard for the night.
"It'll be a while before anything can be done, the Ministries, which does include the muggle men on top involved to find solutions, meanwhile, we're the last stop in order to save species."
"Ahh.." The black haired wizard sighed and scratched the back of his head. Draco in turn send him a deadly glare whilst swatting, as far as he could manage, at the curtain to stop: "It's ruining my hair, you fool! Tell me what you did!"
That night, Harry talked with Andromeda for hours about anything and everything. She had gotten him excited for plans to make and things to do. That night he settled down in her attic, on the camping bed below the roof window and fell asleep dreaming of cruising through foreign cities and alongside pretty white beaches with palm trees on the bright red bike.
Harry Potter simply didn't care. There he was, standing on platform nine and three quarters, about to board the Hogwarts express that would bring him and his two best friends back to the castle for their repeat of seventh year.
Harry sighed and put the book atop of the desk and bend to pick up another one. Realizing this was going to take a while. "I know and I'm sorry for doing so but come on.." He gave a tiny smile as he showed a thin purple book: "Is this the one?"
"Well, fine." Draco said, he too, thinking it over for a moment. "Anyway, how interesting and all this may be, dinner is ready and Andy doesn't like to wait."
Instead, he explained the easy accessible and save mode of long distance port-keys. It was fairly simple, one purchases a ticket for an exact tine and date of travel from and to designated locations, much like muggle airplanes. The downside being the extreme nausea and dizziness which could be, for an additional fee, be remedied by potions at arrival.
Harry lay on his bed, unable to sleep. He had closed the curtains on the side but opened the strips on the slanted ceiling so he could look through the glass up the starry night.
Draco tried to get a grasp on the situation but Harry was shut down completely. It had been a long time since he saw Harry in such a state. It was even longer ago his attacks were so severe and for the live of him, Draco didn't know why. As far as he knew, Harry was, excluding his war crimes, the goody two shoes, ever the law abiding citizen.
He readjusted his grip on the book to two fingers and wiggled it; making some of the pages fly loose and glide onto the floor as his head tried to wrap around the fact the most cheaply looking one of all could be it. "Are you sure?" He frowned. "This one caused all the mess?"
Harry stared at her outstretched hand, and thought for a moment. While it was obvious for him now that they did mean to do something about it, despite having him believe they wouldn't earlier. He decided to take a chance. After all, a little mystery to spice up his vacation was a desirable addition. He always had a taste for adventure. "No, I'll keep it." He eventually said.
In the elevator, Draco noticed how pale Harry looked and with a leap in his heart was reminded of Harry's condition. "Are you alright?" He asked anxious.
"Well, true enough." Charlie got up, and they left together. "It's good, because tomorrow is my day off, and we have some stuff to do."
They sat on that bench for at least another hour, Harry unwilling to let the tale go and they talked about it for a while. Charlie made it clear he told him to understand how important the shack behind them was, not to try and find a solution. Soon the air became lighter and Charlie stood up. "Now we had that little and also very uncomfortable talk, which I rather have we don't mention again, like ever.. How about we go in and see some babies?"
As he looked around, Harry spotted the Soul members, having taken a seat in the corner. Silas was eating with tiny bites, reading a floating newspaper that flipped its own pages. Solomon was fully committed to his plate, scarving down a mash with meat, with his nose almost touching the plate. Shelley though, was just drinking a hot beverage and caught Harry looking. She gave a little wave and a smile when she spotted him. Harry waved back.
The last bit was barely audible but Draco grinned. "You'll do fine, stop channelling your inner Granger."
"I'm fine," Harry said, a little out of breath. "I'm grounding, I'll be alright in a bit. I'm taking my potions and its doing its job."
The next afternoon when Harry came back from the hospital he found Draco with distinctive pink ears and dishevelled hair at the kitchen table.
Draco took the hint, whenever Harry said it in the past and he didn't comply, Harry held his foot down and didn't do any work. To not get too much on Harry's nerve, Draco pointed out a few. Harry took them down, writing down the numbers that were on their labels on a dingy note pad.
Draco had a tough time choosing, stepping back and forth, halting a hand midway whenever he was about to point out one or another until, Harry slapped him playfully on the back of his head and admonished him. "Make a choice, or I won't be doing anything for you today."
It also kept Harry up. He sighed, turned on his other side and once again, the events played by in his head. He thought his first day in Romania was a success and when he realised sleeping just wasn't in the cards for him, he got up. He rummaged through his bag, retrieved a book on magical creatures and sat himself on the lounge chair on the other side of the glass room. The stars above, the fairy lights within along with the candle he found and lit provided him enough light to read. That is were Charlie found him in the morning.
Draco had half a mind to turn himself in, spill the beans and see where it landed him, although that was a little too Gryffindor to his taste. He thought to hide. He thought to throw some money around and probably walk away unscathed. He could go on with his life as if it was nothing. After all, in political circles, his name still held weight, and he'd saved an emergency fund, just in case such an occasion may rear its ugly head.
"Eat." Andromeda barked and Harry almost flipped his plate in shock. "Once you're plate is empty and you've joined in on our conversation about our Christmas plans, you're allowed to space out as much as you want."
"The stone," Harry asked, a little frenzy. He stood up, quickly patting himself down several times. "Did I lose it?"
"Prim old man," Charlie sighed. He looked up at Harry who remained standing, arms crossed. Noticing Harry's foul mood, Charlie leaned back and raised an eyebrow. "So? What do you want to do?"
He reflected, knowing he could have done better, or differently, but, he was content. He was happy and adored what he did, having all things considered, even if he had grown to be that lonely, unsocial hermit of the block.
As if they counted off, they simultaneously moved. Draco dropped the potion and Harry swished the blade.
"I do." Draco pleaded with Harry, who refused to even look at him. "Andy and Teddy are my only family left, they are your only family left and well, that.. Makes us family, Harry." It felt odd to say his first name, but it had the desired effect. Draco caught Harry's attention.
Ultimately, it was Draco who broke the silence that had fallen between them. He restlessly went from leaning forward to pacing but eventually flopped back on the couch. He took his wand from the coffee table and settled it beside him. He'd been waiting, and thinking, and waiting some more. Truth to be told, Draco felt completely exhausted but he knew he should get it out of the way. It was important. Draco cut right to point. "What happened?"
It was stunning, small but stunning. A bathroom and a kitchenette on the opposite side of the room, nicely tucked in under the loft that was clear to be the bedroom. A large corner desk on the left and a couch with rug and fireplace on the right. The walls, loft and ceiling had never been covered and remained the dark wood the hut was made of. It only took one look to know Charlie's favourite colour is purple. Everything, the couch, the rug and dozens of flowerpots, even the cabinet doors of the little kitchen were in various tones of purple. Harry was also surprised to see a lot of bookcases which didn't held that much books but plants instead and a handful of fish bowls scattered around.
It wasn't until Harry made the dangerous move for the fifth time before he fell. When he fell, he fell hard. From the top of the ladder he went down to the floor, taking the bookshelf with him as he landed flat on his back. Books came toppling after him in fast rate. They came down like rain, landing with heavy thuds. His legs and torso were being hit a few times; one of the last books came down, right at his head. Harry saw and on reflex rolled away with a groan of minor pain escaping, hearing the loudest thud next to his head. "Damn. That would have hurt. "
Despite his vow, another day later he still found himself there. After all, who would say no to a romatic evening in front of the fireplace being read for by his lover?
"Same reasons as you just gave. You really want to go to Russia in the middle of winter? I mean, It'll be pretty but also cold as heck and I don't think you and I are equipped enough to dare snow roads."
The blonde too, cherished it. Harry had, in the past, offered to take it out, let it heal and redo it but the Draco had refused over an over again until Harry stopped offering and the flower stayed since. Harry was, secretly so, grateful for it.
He was sitting on the cold floor with his back against the kitchen door trying to read the pages in a measly light of the lone torch burning while Draco had freed himself a while ago. Harry's stomach grumbled and roared loudly and every other minute a whispered curse left his mouth as the heavenly smells of delicious chicken and other foods travelled into his nose. Obvious Kreacher's cooking as Harry guessed, knowing Draco wasn't a master in the kitchen and he was jealous because he knew how dawn well good it tasted. He was jealous because he was on the wrong side of the door and practicing the wand movements of ancient trickster spells out of a dingy old book with a wooden spoon; The wooden spoon that was handed to him before Draco had slammed the kitchen door shut in his face and he hated it. It wasn't even a metal one. Harry couldn't even pretend for a later use of scooping Draco's heart out with it, painful and slowly as wood didn't cut. Thus, Harry was, to say the least, not amused.
All in all, Christmas was a succes. They all loved their presents and had a fun afternoon in the kitchen. Harry had taken lead, and together they made an elaborate dinner to enjoy.
"Almost nobody comes up here, it's a treacherous hike. Only a few times a year a group is spotted heading this way." Charlie said.
She did not say why, which, if the boys would think about it could have had several reasons. They did not think of those. Both knew Andromeda was not the youngest anymore. She needed the hold on but refused to outright say so.
"This one?" Harry asked and was a little taken aback when he heard a triumph yes being shouted eagerly. He was holding a dingy orange leather-bound book with loose pages that stuck out of their binding with slight surprise.
"As if. I can multitask." Draco said and Harry groaned but grabbed a white coat from the back of the door and washed his hands. He sat sown on the chair, pulled the cart close and set to the tedious job of cutting of pieces and sticking them through needles. Draco stopped him after the first five minutes and ordered him to do it by magic. It was easier and faster, but Harry wasn't entirely happy. If it had been his choice, he had broken and thrown away the pieces a long time ago. It was Draco who made him keep the wand and use it whenever he came down so, as to his words, Harry would keep in touch with his magic, just in case he might need to rely on it in the future.
Seeing him however, made her tuck away the wand in her arm holster and she briskly stalked up to him, a finger waving to scold him. "Harry! I told you so," She grabbed his ear. "Do not apparate so close up, you'll set the wards of and scare little Teddy bear!"
"I never thought wizards would do such things," Harry said as he walked towards the edge. "Since we have so many ways to easily travel."
Harry's eyes snapped up, and there he was, walking in as if he owned the shop. He was, as ever, dressed like a businessman minus the jacket and he carried two foam cups, a plastic bag dangled of his arm and he had some magazines snuck under it. Harry refused to say they were friends but really, if he thought about it, Draco could be counted as one. When Harry started developing his art, Draco lend out his skin for payment so Harry could master it, but, nowadays while he didn't need him anymore, he just, never left. Sometimes he even brought snacks and ordered, not asked, Harry to do fun things with him. They forged an odd bond, one in self exile, the other exiled and by coincidence moved into apartments in the same block.
Draco mulled it over, and in the end curiosity won out. Curiosity killed the cat. He knew that of all options, this was the worst. Yet, he knew that, without a doubt, Harry was going to stick his neck out for him if he couldn't manage to save himself. It would go against everything Harry stood for to let anyone else take the fall for something he'd caused. With that, Draco took his wand and cast a rennervate at the still form of his friend.
"They do tours here?" Harry asked and Charlie nodded. "I totally forgot. We'll ask a schedule from Bernadette when we pass her, come on! We're taking ages on boring stuff, that bag must be heavy!"
Andromeda leaned over the table, taken a slight pity as she patted Harry on the head, saying soft encouragements and at that, Draco left the kitchen. He remembered well how hard Harry had studied the last three months and he thought Harry had noting to worry about.
Even if Harry had killed Voldemort, Voldemort had still killed him – the both of them, and she screamed.
The process had taken long enough, Harry shoo-ed Draco out of the room and back into the front." Wait a moment," Harry said and got behind the desk, he quickly duplicated the list and slid it into a drawer. He went into the backroom and collected his materials. "Ok. Get in there." He pointed at the other door that led to his workspace when he came back into the front.
Harry looked around and realised the rectangular building was a stable of sorts. On either side small enclosures, their fronts solid glass doors to provide easy yet save means of supervising. Each holding their own clipboard dangling on a rope from the door handle and a small but high folder cabinet right next to the door. Some cabinets drawers stood open and their folders thrown on the tables that stood in odd angles spread across the wide middle path. Large lightbulbs kept the place lit and it was messy - Besides folders and their papers there were also books, quills and other office supplies in abundance were covering every surface. Bags of coal underneath tables or forgotten by doors, bags of dirt too and Harry spotted little packets of seeds he recognized from Professor Sprout use in class on top or beside the dirt bags, some whole and others ripped open, left where it had been done.
"You panicked," Draco deadpanned and went on incredulously, as he ran a hand over his face. "A bit of panic doesn't blow an entire city block to smithereens."
He sat up, almost hitting his head against the fallen bookshelf hooked into another one that had prevented it from crashing down. Harry rubbed his back as he looked at the mess around. He cursed loudly for having to start all over again; it wasn't his favourite way to spend his time. Having to do it twice was even worse. He wanted to kick himself for repeating the same mistake he made earlier this day. He already hated being in here as much as it was.
Hermione watched from afar as she saw how her friend broke further and no matter her trying to right the wrongs, she wasn't reaching trough and neither was Ron. In the end, they gave up. Almost. They still tried to keep watching his back as they found solace in each other.
Charlie poked his head through the door opening. "Are you crazy? Course not. We finally reached the point where I can start showing you the important stuff," He spoke slow, exaggerating his next two words. "Like, dragons.."
"Why, yes. My Robert owns the shop and my son, little Richie works a part time job at the Inn as a server while he does his apprenticeship in Charms. We are from the town here."
"I assume we can. We cannot scare the child by having his uncle and godfather having a go at each other, now can we?"
Harry sighed again as he watched Draco walk away. Half his mind wanted to throw the spoon at the blonde but he knew it would only lead to more problems and settled for throwing it into the kitchen; which wasn't one of his brightest ideas. He missed hitting Kreacher by mere centimetres and instead it smashed into their porcelain cabinet. A loud crash of ceramic clatter and Kreacher let out a hysteric screech.
Draco sighed, he had been there plenty of times. Paris was one of his family hot spots during the summer vacations but Harry had never been and so, the Eiffel Tower was marked as a must go. "If we are there anyway, how do you feel about grabbing some museums to see?"
"Oh, right," Harry walked over to the desk. "I need some glass boxes, shoebox size? Uhm, about 20 or so? And some silver tongs, err, about an arm length? Also some test-tubes that can be closed off. Oh, and they need to be sterile."
He walked through a long hallway past doors and several weirdly angled stairs until he passed a receptionist. She sat facing a large dining area. Harry peeked in and it had an uncanny resemblance to the Leaky Cauldron down in London which struck him as odd considering how far away he was. He shook his head, greeted the lady behind the desk and went out the front door. Harry being to busy looking up and around, wasn't watching where he walked and smacked into someone. Ready to apologize, he was hugged and let go before his mind processed it.
Silas stumped him on the shoulder. "We know, now shut up and greet our honorary staff member politely."
Just as Andromeda was about to give the sad boy beside her some heart felt words, a heavy car engine rumbling came close to the house, the windows rattled and Harry perked up. He gave Andromeda a questioning look but she merely raised an eyebrow and a slight shake of her head, indicating she didn't know either. Harry got up, to look out the window and see what it was all about.
Draco ran a hand over his face and through his hair. It all happened so fast. The bell rang. Voices were heard that Harry recognized and panicked. He himself panicked.
"You may stay, for as long as you like," Andromeda said softly and thumbed his cheek. "But only if you smile."
"Home, hours ago." The security guard answered in a clipped tone. Harry's cheeks blossomed, he always felt awkward when reprimanded even if it wasn't obvious. He figured he might have been a bit rude, interrupting as he had. The man however, silently dismissed Harry when he turned back to Charlie. "Charles, as you were saying?"
It took awhile to get the upset Teddy calmed down. In order to do so, they opened Teddy's presents first, leaving Draco's last forgotten. Teddy's gifts were simple, some clothes, a book that read itself out loud, a ball and from Harry and Draco he'd gotten a toy car he could ride around in the garden. Teddy was immediately taken with it. Although Andromeda rather had Teddy not riding it in the home, she couldn't deny the bright-eyed toddler from playing with it. "It'll be weeks before he can play with it outside." Andromeda sighed.
His skin too pale, a greyish hue, his hair falling into his eyes and his normally clean and pressed school uniform was rumpled and saggy on his way too skinny form.
An hour later, after a happy lunch, Harry and Draco stood outside the Leaky Cauldron together. Andromeda and Teddy already left minutes before to the antique store above Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour .
Andromeda loved times like these. The living room cosy and warm, Teddy concentrated on his own play pretending with the blocks and stacking cups while she was doing the crafts she liked so much - even if the bickering coming from upstairs came out above the music she had playing calming tunes in the background.
"Don't mess around in a potions lab," Solomon said sternly and as an afterthought added. "The blue is real, I tell you, born with it, just like them." He waved at his family members.
He froze for a moment, quelling the feel and watched Harry, who didn't answer him. Harry darted through the room again, his breathing growing more erratic and finally ducking underneath the bed. He huddled into himself, hands covering his face and rocking side to side.
Still, trying and hoping she was wrong, she took another step and called out again, utter fear evident in her voice but she got no confirmation from either boy. Crouching down, she reached out a shaky hand and gently touched Harry's cheek. She slinked back, falling on her bum and her whole body shook, eyes welling up. He was ice cold.
"I'd rather say it wasn't explained completely and clearly, it was not your fault, but rather poor delaying," She smiled kindly and tapped him on the knee. "We don't say no to anyone willing to help out the Dragon Sanctuary. You must know our staff is small, and everyone is busy, overly so."
"Sorry 'bout that." Charlie chuckled and lost his grip, letting Harry tumble back again. It took them three tries and Harry still wasn't back up onto his feet. Then Charlie spotted something and abandoned his mission. That left Harry, who now was also in a fit of giggles to stand up himself.
Harry shrugged and gave it over and watched Draco open it, using a finger to scan the index and then frantically flipped through the pages. "Pick up those loose pages will you?" He asked sounding nothing like the snappy displeased tone he used earlier. "This is definitely the one."
"However he is on his downtime, Solomon is a professional. He's good at his job, charming and the only tour guide who has managed to keep his charges safe without any accidents so far." Charlie said, shrugging again. With that, the conversation died because Gavriil and Zhanna came into the room and they came over for a quick chat. Gavrill and Charlie threw jabs at one another with laughter while Zhanna invited Harry to stop by the Nursery again.
They smiled at each other and checked out the last few eggs left. When they reached the last eggs, a nest full of blue ones with a flower pattern almost invisible by the amount of sunflowers surrounding it, Charlie happily clapped in his hands. "I know its almost dinner time but really, now we seen the eggs, it's time to fly with the babies!"
When he asked what she came for she smiled sweetly. "I've been invited to watch over you redoing the library with no magic whilst your ferret is off to work. It's going to be so much fun!"
The place was small. There's the front room, narrow enough that it only took just four steps from the front door to reach the two other doors on the other side. These doors, made of one sided look through glass lead to the backroom and his work space.
Harry's mumbling broke and he dropped the stone. The effect clear when thunder clapped and rain poured down. They heard the shower beating onto the roof.
Harry closed the door. "Choose your poison." Harry said and waved his hands about. Draco moved to the wall, small bits of wire were on display, the strands carefully lined and the light above put them in a good sight, their colour combinations splashing off the white wall.
Several hours later, when Draco sat curled up on the couch with his nose in a book, he was proven right.
All was said and done with laughter and Harry was glad, very glad he'd come here. He hadn't been here long but was already feeling happy, lighter and Charlie's tongue in the cheek attitude was a welcome change of pace.
Harry is tired. Mentally and physically exhausted. He barely eats and sleeps even less. When he does sleep, he has heavy nightmares. The nightmares though, aren't restricted to when his eyes are closed. The cruelly he sees at night follow him into the light. Throughout the days he keeps seeing the worst and everywhere he looks those awful red eyes are in sight. His own eyes, never unseeing and his body always feeling the pain - it's horrible and Harry does not know what to do when his sight is always blurred with the edge of red.
Harry rolled his eyes but indeed got to wrapping. He'd only managed to wrap Andromeda's presents upstairs before Draco became unbearable and he'd moved spaces. Draco wrapped his perfectly in shiny, dark blue paper with twinkling stars and silver bows. Harry's on the other hand, done shabby but with effort in reds and greens, with too much stickers and other decorations. Eitherway, once both boys were done, they loaded Draco's car full and rode to the postal service to owl out all their presents. That evening during dinner, they finalized their plans and every now and then, they needed to let an owl in, bringing gifts for them.
Harry didn't answer. A few moments later and out of breath he sat next to Charlie who's happy grin hadn't faded and motioned his hands for the red head to explain as he gulped air.
Harry! Let me in!" Draco pounded on the door with his fists, mingled with some kicks and curses. Draco cursed, having tried to enter the house for some time now and being unable to had him gone angry.
Harry had to suppress a laugh, because there was nothing to laugh about except at how seamlessly Charlie fell into teacher mode and added facts that while on topic got nothing to do with the story on hand. "Yea, the witch hunts and all that, Binns taught it."
"We're sorry Harry," The mousy man, complete with cardigan, tie and bowl hat said, looking through thick rimmed glasses onto a shiny clipboard. "You know we would love to have you but, with the amount of media attention you gather and just the fact that you are a," He made bunny ears half heartedly, "Famous face. You cannot do much for us in the field."
It was a large room in pastel blue and dark woods. One side had ceiling high windows, giving a perfect view of the mountains and two seat tables with linen cloth underneath. There was a small buffet table with drinks, sauces and spare tableware. In the middle of the room were larger tables that could seat easily twelve persons. Floating candles were almost touching the ceiling, while water pitchers and clear glasses just hovered above head height. Each table had elaborate centerpieces of plants and flowers that hid miniature dragons within their leaves. The small dragons seemed very much alive; some slept, others flew around blowing little smoke curls from their noses and others ate or played-fight with each other. They seemed trapped in an invisible globe, never straying far from the centerpiece they belonged to. The tables were decked out with empty golden plates, menu cards and little salt and pepper sets.
This time, Harry reacted, his eyes flew open and he turned to his side. A load of vomit escaped him and he rolled back. Looking up at the worried face of the woman above him he croaked out a thanks and closed his eyes again.
"I know, dammit," Harry blurted out. He shuffled aside and stood up. He opened the curtains again but seeing the storm he closed them with a huff. "I'm blanking out."
It doesn't mean he wants too though. It's just to unnatural to be forced and then expected to life happily, cheerfully, smile and go trough the school routine as if they didn't just fought a war. As if they hadn't buried people they knew and cared about. If they hadn't seen the things war brought. They couldn't expect just because they took the child out of war, the war would be out of the child - Except they did. They just made them do, without a hand of help and expected them to succeeded in being a happy teenager who kindly went to lessons and made their homework. Twisted.
The blonde hopped of the desk. "Why, thank you, kind Sir." Draco replied, his tone perfectly on par with Harry's jab. Harry shook his head, a smile still present as he followed Draco into the room.
No sooner then he said it, Charlie continued making faces and mid-face – hands copping his ears an sticking his tongue out - the door swung open.
Within minutes, Harry found himself being hoisted into protective gear by Gavriil. It was hard to chew the sandwich Zhanna had given him – "Nobody starves on my watch"- while Gavriil tucked on him left and right , and also trying to pay attention at the safety briefing Charlie was sprouting out. He was lucky for his experience in flying, it cut Charlie's instructions short. He mainly rehearsed that claw and bite marks were hard to heal, fire hurt and to keep them at distance - "Don't let them barrel into you, their force will knock you right of your broom" - Within thirty minutes both were walking in complete gear and with borrowed brooms out the back of the building towards a large pen.
"It's pretty, isn't it, boys? A female voice broke their moment. Neither heard Zhanna come close to them from wherever she came. Harry actually yelped, so spaced out he was. He turned and gave her a once over. Zhanna was just a smidge taller then him, plump with dirty blond hair and wearing a floor length dress that seemed out of place. She had a cute smile, dimples and all. It took the attention away from mud brown eyes and wrinkles, even if it didn't look bad om her. She had aged well.
He waved the house elf away claiming he was alright and if it wasn't time to start cleaning one thing or another or something. It didn't matter really, so long the elf would leave. As soon as the house elf left, Harry fell back and propped his arms under his head with a heavy sigh. In the freedom of his mind he continued cursing as he looked around for points to start cleaning up his own created chaos for the second time.
Harry sat on the couch, watching Charlie wander around the room. He relayed what had happened. Charlie hummed through his explanation and congratulated him. "Bloody fantastic!"
"Are you boys ready to go?" Andromeda asked. She was bundled up in a thick cloak, long scarf and a stylish winter hat on her head, Draco was dressed similar and Teddy too, was bundled up warm. The poor child could barely move in the thick layers of winter clothes and Harry kept on snickering every time he saw Teddy and the little too large woollen hat that kept sagging over one of his eyes.
Bernadette Dell'elion tucked an escaping grey curl behind her ear, feeling confused. She was fairly sure potions that burned their lawn shouldn't be there. She thanked Harry for bringing it to her attention and assured him their gardener would be notified. He would see to it. Harry smiled, gave himself a clap on the back for a thing well done and left again.
"And?" She enquired. She stood up with difficulty, patting Teddy and gave a jerk of the head to Harry who stepped over and picked the toddler up. He smiled brightly, positioned Teddy on one hip and waved the papers at Andromeda.
Harry winced as he looked into the kitchen, the pieces where everywhere and he counted himself lucky that Draco hadn't reacted to the noise. Quickly he apologized to the elf and with his wand and the book he became to hate in hand he ran away; not quite up to being scolded by the creature was why he made a two second split decision on starting fixing the other side of the house first.
"Ah. Not a pen." Draco whispered when he saw the small needle at tip. Andromeda shoved Harry sleeve up, smashed it into Harry's skin and emptied it. Under her breath, she counted to ten and hit him with the spell again.
"So.. I'm out?" Harry asked defeated. The man had already explained the difficulty of the matter in length but he had a hard time believing it. He just wanted to be an Auror, had been told he would have been a great one, he would have loved it, he knew. Yet, in one swift blow, the one wish he had was gone.
Harry always got in a worried frenzy with such tales, broom accidents were dangerous. He flew a lot, so all the more aware of the deadly endings it could have. "But?"
"I can't!" Harry kicked the door once, not amused. "I've been trying for hours! None of the lock opening spells I know work!"
"These I don't want to go to. At least not yet," Harry said and added. "Some of these I want to visit on a later date, take my time. I want to go road tripping but I don't have to go and see the whole world in one go."
That Christmas morning, they collected in the kitchen for breakfast. None bothered to either dress and fix appearances in any way. Just a lazy morning in nightwear, the table full of luxury foods, coffee and laughter. Nothing prim or proper was important when presents were waiting and they once finished and moved to the living room.
Andromeda Tonks put her foot down. "I've been warning you two," She sighed as they sat gathered in the kitchen for breakfast. "Christmas is tomorrow and neither of you have even started wrapping."
Draco pouted. Actually pouted and went to clear the table but in a rush, Harry stopped him. "Thanks," Harry mumbled. "Appreciate it." He slid the coffee close and merely asked, what he could do for him on this fine day. Which it was, the sun was shining and a light breeze kept the temperature within bounds.
They indeed got the schedule from Bernadette and went through the doors behind her. Only now did Harry see that the building was a U-shape. "That's all part of the exhibit," Charlie pointed to the left and then to the right. "Over there is a swimming pool, a workout and lounge room and on the first floor is employee only diner. It's a buffet and our guest are welcome to join us for meals there but are asked to pay a small fee, I hope that's not a problem?"
"I suppose that fair enough as this is my fault." Harry answered hoping Draco would give in a bit and help but the other just shook his head and continued reading after canceling the magic on the loose pages, waving him off. "It is your fault and it suits well enough that you fix it, besides," He looked up and eyed the other. "I'm upset with you for not listening and I have to pee."
They stared at one another and tension rose in the room. Ronald Weasley looked positively murderous and Ginny Weasley didn't do much better, she even scuffed her feet over the floor and she tried to hide the grab at her wand but Draco's keen eyes noticed the movement.
"Really?" Charlie breathed out. "I mean, I did a lot of tidying up and stuff and since we don't really have guestrooms I figured I settle you in here because a couch isn't-"
"I'll try to make it happen, no promises." Charlie had said, pulled Harry up and went to take the gear off.
"Totally fine, just a good few cuts and bruises and he broke his wrist," Charlie said, taking Harry's fear away. "He's being fixed up, a dose of Skelegro will set him alright."
Letters were send, rather quickly. They flew through the fire network fast and less then a month later Harry found himself packing his bag. He had gotten to know Charlie quite well and a travel date was set. Harry debated over using his school trunk but considering he'd never once fully emptied the thing he decided against it. Harry didn't fancy shovelling through seven years worth of junk and found it would have to wait for another time. Maybe when he came back from his vacation. Instead, he visited Diagon Alley and bought a large bag pack, some clothes on insistence of Hermione and some other odds and ends to bring with him. That included a gift for Charlie in the form on Honeydukes' candy from the second store newly opened in the Alley; Candy not available in Romania.
One of the chairs had, what supposed to be, Harry guessed, Draco trapped in a loving hug. Harry thought so, and tried not to laugh because the curtain nearby was petting Draco's hair and the chair kept rocking back and forth; much like a baby in its cradle.
"Not yet, dear." Bernadette looked through her notes. "It says here, the gardener gave note he'll do so in the afternoon. He had more pressing matters to take care of."
They, Harry knew, were just the few of many, going over it by the top of his head. Yet, the greatest examples of the elder generations ignoring, letting them fend for themselves and not acknowledging what was really going on came from themselves.
"Headset, and an installation for your car." Harry walked over and pointed at the odd pieces. "We just put those in your car, and with this," He pulled a square with buttons out of the box. "We can connect it to my set, so we can talk while we ride."
She saw the potion bottle that must have slipped out of Harry's hand, it still balancing between three points; Draco's body, the other's hand nestled there and the wall.
Between Christmas and the new year, Harry and Draco had fun figuring out the mobile phones they owned. They regularly tested the system out when driving the country backroads and Draco often dared Harry for little races. Harry wasn't fond of racing, while Draco loved to push the pedal to the floor but every so often he went along with it to humor the blond.
"Somewhere at the end of next week, we'll have some time then." Zhanna said, and Harry gladly accepted. He would love to go there again, especially since he requested and expected his broom to arrive soon.
"You can come and ask me, and if I'm not there, well," Bernadette gave a sigh. "I gather Mr. Gheata can help you. But I advise you to only do so if it's of immediate concern. Otherwise I'd implore you to wait until the morning when I am back."
Half an hour later he decided grudgingly he really had to get a move on and got back onto his feet. With a wave of his wand, having learned some basic check-up medi-spells he made sure he was alright and pushed the bookshelf back up.
"You deserve it." She hummed. "You cannot sit here, live without something to look forward too. One must have things to look forward to."
"You and Harry should open the presents at the same time," Andromeda said. "While they are unique, they are the same."
Two days long she had been searching. Two days of worry and in the one moment she wasn't actually searching but merely wanted to use the loo - she found them.
He gave a lazily wave as he left. Harry gaped and wondered if the other was serious but by the time he thought of giving any retort, the blond was out of sight. Harry grumbled and collected all the bags. He went to find Andromeda and Teddy in the hopes of leaving some, if not all the bags with her and do the last of his shopping.
Before Andromeda could say a thing, even though she already had her hand up to stop the boy, Harry had already upped and left through the front door.
Draco hadn't meant to, but he had accidentally fallen asleep curled up on the armchair with a blanket haphazardly thrown around him. He had wanted to stay awake to keep an eye out on Harry, to make sure Andromeda saw no reason to kill him come morning. Yet, even while reading a book that caught and held his attention he had managed to fall asleep. Fitfully that is, his closed eye time being plagued by nightmares of him being judged by the wizardgamot and the population alike for killing their beloved savior.
The whole of making plans with Draco seemed ridiculously easy. Soon they gathered most of the maps and put them back in the box. A few remained and those were the countries they'd go to first. They decided that, if it all would work out for them and got along, they would revisit the box and continue on a journey together. One of the things that remained was something Harry immediately expressed his delight in was the party boat Sirius had mentioned that runs between England and the Netherland. Draco never one to dismiss a tiny cruise of sorts, they agreed they would go and run through straight for Deutschland. Draco wanted to hit the gas pedal and race along the Autobahn.
Harry grinned and followed her into the house to the kitchen and there sat Teddy, his godson in a high chair at the table, smudging applesauce all around, happy laughter filling the room.
"Mehh," Charlie shrugged. "Technically seen, not really, but they're trying to rebreed some extinct species so they gave this selection a pass. We don't think it'll actually happen. the mother dragon is still young, if she does manage to mate, we don't think an actual egg will be produced just yet."
"We can go to some stores together, but I doubt you want to come with me when I go on a clothing hunt."
Coming closer, it was when it hit her. The fresh gush of air in the room made another smell dwell up. A smell that tore through her senses, dragging up that what she had been so vainly trying to forget but the smell, of dusty copper, dirt and human waste was all too clear. It was the smell of death. Something she had wished to never reek again, ever.
Their classes had too many empty seats. Some were empty for a while, because their owners where still stuck for a long term stay at St. Mungo's and some chairs would stay empty because those students stayed a couple floors above the long term stayers. They were there for a life long, to never be released. Some were empty because their owners weren't coming back, gone for ever. Like Dean. The dark skinned boy wouldn't come back, ever, and Seamus couldn't cooperate with it.
Harry found her in the back garden where she sat sprawled, legs open wide on the ground. Teddy sat between her feet and they rolled a ball back and forth. Harry looked at them happily until Andromeda noticed them.
"What are you doing here?" Harry spat out, arms crossed defensively where he stood in front of the open door.
"Really? I mean I knew that he once said he build the motorcycle to travel but he actually made ,ahh, sort off a starting plan already?"
Andromeda put her glass down. The shouting match in her front yard became louder and louder and the voices became angrier with each word. She sighed, wondering if they were four year old with the way they kept on with their yes and no tug o' war.
Harry stood up and sat down next to Draco. He planned to show the stone but found his pocket empty. Harry was pale, but once he realised the stone was gone, he went ghostly white. "Where is it?" Harry whispered.
Charlie nodded. "It's just a village, everyone knows each other well around here. No other magical settlement close enough to warrant an office." He sat up and shuffled over so he sat in front of Harry. "We barely get any tourists, and the whole town together with the Dragon Sanctuary are behind magical borders. The rare visitor from another magical settlement in Romania comes through the Travellers Inn. So everyone is registered. There's simply no need."
"You're very welcome, Dear," She said and added. "Don't mind Charles to much, he's quite excited to have a close friend from home finally visit. He'll tone down the cheer soon, I hope."
Kreacher, not understanding the situation, took the wand, bowed and vanished out of the room and Harry, silently cursing, grabbed the ladder and climbed on it. Atop, he took two books and and climbed down, putting them on the desk and as if a light bulb burned above his head; he walked around the bookshelf and gave a push. The shelf only wobbled and stayed in place to Harry dismay. He repeated the push, adding one firm kick and all the books were sprawled over the floor. Harry grinned but not for long.
"This," Charlie said as they came close to the rectangular building, positively giddy of excitement. "This is the nursery! The building is old, creaky and overgrown, I know, but it's important and really, really cool!"
Soon, they found themselves back at Charlie's home, seated on the couch with a simple cold dinner. They took turns in the shower and all the while, the main topic of conversation remained their flight. It had been utter brilliance, deliberation, freedom.
He felt haunted by the people and mostly, by his own mind. The nightmares and alike shredding him piece by piece. He left the wizarding world slightly beside himself, with a mind in shambles and slightly suicidal.
Draco agreed and then rummaged to the other stack. Almost all countries further then France and Germany also were put on the stack. "Might as well not go there then too."
Andromeda gave it a fond smile and motioned Harry over to the desk. There we some leather-bound books. Andromeda having made them and still working on some, adding stories and pictures of her little family for Teddy when he would grow older and she might not be there anymore. "I refuse to let anyone forget their childhood tales, Harry. Better to record their lives then have them lost by time."
"I knew the Sanctuary saved dragons but I didn't know this was the cause nor that it is so bad." Harry muttered.
"Poor word choice," Draco said. Pure hatred and loathing was raised in one fell swoop with the one simple word of the redhead. "May I remind you, you're on the clock. Please be respectful, I haven't insulted either of you. Although," He grinned and couldn't resist a well placed jab. "Do these red Auror robes clash horribly with your hair, piss poor choice, I'll tell you."
The voice became muffled as it got dimmed, the man moving away from the door, but the fact he was still barking at the woman became clear, for her squeaky voice answered in yells back.
"Here." Harry held out the loose pages and Draco pushed the ones he ripped out in Harry's hands. "You better start learning the counters."
"If you have a hot minute, I'll come with," Charlie said as he put the watering can away and grabbed a cloth to clean any spilled water. "I reckon you've never flown with a loaded net under a broom?"
The reporters could not follow. The tell tale sign of Aurors coming down by the whistle they blew to control large crowds prevented them for doing so and Harry let out a deep breath in relief. He, thoroughly dishevelled, ran his hands over his face. He mourned his lost glasses for a second and spun around to thank his saviour.
Without much care, Harry dropped everything beside the couch. He settled down beside Andromeda's feet. "Draco claimed our room. He covered every bleeding surface, even my bed."
Luckily, Draco was a quick thinker. He grabbed the sheets from the cart, used to provide a clean bed to work on and covered both sides to the floor with them, hiding Harry in a little tent. He figured with Aurors in the building, using magic was not the greatest idea. Technically seen, he was not allowed. Long ago they broke his hawthorn and unicorn hair wand and a simple red dot on his wrist alerted every wand seller he may not carry one. Still, he aquired one. Draco's hand glided over the intricate carved piece of wood within a hidden pocket of his pants. Now however was not the time to use it.
Harry loved it, soaring through the habitats, feeling hot and cold, being splashed by waved and drops of rain and being hit by bursts of sun. He ducked and dived between trees, the hills and had his feet grace flower fields. He saw dragons, tiny and cute lazing, eating or grappling with each other and occasionally one would fly beside him. He would dance, up and down and around the small creature, a game of tag with no contact or control high up in the air. He loved every minute, every moment and then the sky went coloured, then dark and Charlie, just as reluctant as him, told them it was time to touch down and leave.
