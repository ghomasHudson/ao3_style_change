“Was Narcissa at the Battle of Hogwarts?”
“I’ve just thought of something rather brilliant!” She exclaimed. “You should bring Harry some chocolate!”
“What’d you expect me to do? Not get the snitch?”
He checked his watch, five minutes had passed.
An hour and a half later, the six of them were laughing, hands covered in pumpkin seeds and guts as they proclaimed Neville the victor of the ninth annual pumpkin carving competition.
“Let’s.” Draco smiled and stepped out into the hall.
Harry nodded.
Draco wasn’t sure what he would do when he saw his father. Hug him, shout at him, say he hated him, tell him he loved him, give him the silent treatment... Draco had no idea. He hadn’t been able to work out what he felt towards his father. He knew he was a little angry at him for all the harm his actions had caused. But Draco also knew that he loved him. He wasn’t sure which emotion would win out when he was finally face to face with his father.
They continued watching as if nothing had happened. Harry did his best to push the thought of holding hands with Draco out of his mind. At the next jump scare a few minutes later, Draco grabbed onto Harry’s hand, and didn’t let go.
“Oh. Do you like him?”
“Something funny there, miss?” The old man asked, his voice getting rough with annoyance as he rang them up.
“It’s gonna be tough. If McGonagall hadn’t made us all try out I wouldn’t have gone for it. She made Malfoy captain and he’s a good enough seeker for me not to see a need to try out. I still think we can do it though. I do agree with Neville, you should do some sort of girly bonding activity with Parkinson. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, Malfoy and I have shared a room for weeks and he and I haven’t even tried to kill each other.”
“We’ll never be back here,” He found himself whispering, as he looked out upon the grounds. “I didn’t realize how much I’d miss this place.”
In Defense Against the Dark Arts, Granger was going over an auror report and helping everyone through reading one. Harry was sitting at the desk, the last, and far more basic, auror report they’d just done. And Draco, kept glancing up at Harry as he worked. On a few occasions, Draco would look up to find that Harry was looking at him, and for the briefest moment, their eyes would meet. Then one of them would look away and the moment would end.
He looked down to Draco as he went to land, who smiled at him.
He retreated to his room, he just needed to be alone. It’s not that the eighth years were insensitive, quite the opposite compared to the other years, at least they had actually fought and had been around for every other crazy Voldemort thing that had happened. They just didn’t seem to see that it affected him so much, talking about his death like it didn’t matter. Harry supposed that from an outsiders perspective it didn’t. He was dead for a few minutes, the curse didn’t stick, within the next hour he had jumped from Hagrid’s arms and killed Voldemort.
Draco was scared to open it.

“Practical, yes, dueling, no.” Harry said, “You can either help or wait outside until class starts.”
“Yep.” She went to the door and locked it as the two headed out.
“Long.” Draco set his bag on the nearby bar stool, “Tiring.”
“And now we will hear from Mr. Harry Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and peer to Mr. Malfoy.”
Satisfied, Draco sealed the letter and passed it off to the auror. She examined it and muttered a few spells before deeming it safe to be sent away.
“Truth.”
“Special friend?” Draco asked.
“I think they’re all strong individually, I just think it will take a lot of work for them to be one unit, a team.” Draco said contemplatively.
“Did you have a reason for calling me?” Draco asked, anxious for the call to be over with. “It is rather late after all.”
Draco laughed and told them everything.
Excited murmuring burst out throughout the room. Harry grinned, but Draco was just confused. He didn’t think they had very many people who had played for their houses. There was him, Blaise, Potter and Weasley. He was unaware if any of the returning Hufflepuffs or Ravenclaws played for their houses. But there inlaid another problem. Potter and him played the same position, and Draco had to admit that Potter was better than he ever would be. He had never played another position in his life. It didn’t matter, he knew better than to join the team.
Harry fought an eye roll, “Yes, she is in fact the famous Hermione Granger,” He said with a smile as he gestured towards Hermione. “Harry Potter, nice to meet you.” He held out his hand for a shake and she took it.
“That’s why we go and buy some, you idiot!”
“I was nervous because I sitting next to you.” Draco took a deep breath, “I like you. Like a lot. Like go on a date like you.”
“Well, I just hope that the new defense teacher won’t be out to kill anyone this year. We’ve had enough of that.” Neville said.
She smiled at him as tears pooled in the corners of her twinkling eyes, “You will always be welcome at Hogwarts, Draco.” Something in those words and in her face reminded Draco of Dumbledore. And he knew McGonagall would be just as good of a Headmistress as Dumbledore was Headmaster, if not better.
“Draco,” Harry returned easily. He was sitting with his back to Draco, an essay in his lap, his gaze focused on some far off point in the Forbidden Forest.
—Appie
A calm silence settled over the kitchen for roughly the next hour, then people slowly started to trickle down the stairs to join them.
“Yes.”
“Yes, well father and I had a lot of catching up to do.” Draco said, sitting down at one of the set plates. “You’ve set the table for three.”
Brittany laughed uncomfortably and ducked out from the girl’s grasp. She was very clearly drunk. The girl reached for another drink that was sitting at a nearby table, but Brittany intercepted her. “I think you’ve had enough for the night.” The girl stumbled, only further proving Brittany’s point. Brittany turned to Draco and Pansy and muttered, “I’m going to get her back to her room.” Before she quickly began to lead the girl through the crowd. Draco watched them until they’d disappeared within the midst of people entirely.
He internally sighed as the Witch listed off his achievements. He stood up anyway and entered the witness area head held high. He chose to stand behind the chair, he had had enough of sitting to day and he needed to make an impact.
“Fine,” Draco said, offering a shrug of his own. “Rather uneventful, quiet.”
Mr. Orange pulled a sheet from under the counter, “Scan the code and fill out the form on the website. I can call you for an interview based on that.”
“Pans, I don’t have any chocolate.”
“Good morning.” He held out the small gift box he had wrapped for her.
“No one, I- she’s never killed anyone.” It was the truth, while Draco’s father had no qualms with murder, his mum had always distanced herself from it.
“Perfect.”
“Oh come on, the heart wrenching emotions will replace the fear you feel. It’s funny too, and it’s just started.”
“Should I be worried that Potter is arming you?” Asked the auror lightly.
Harry texted his aunt that he was settled in. Petunia and Lily had had a rocky relationship since high school but had made up in the aftermath of Petunia’s divorce and James’ death. He was glad his aunt could look after Lily while he was at college, his neighbor Andie had helped last year mostly because she had been suffering from empty nester’s syndrome, but he figured that she shouldn’t have to help when he wasn’t there.
Ron made the lip zip motion and Hermione nodded.
Draco collapsed onto his own bed and stared at Potter unabashedly. “How are you so hot?” He asked Potter, his voice slurred. Potter’s eyes snapped up and he squinted at Draco.
“Right. I’ve gotta put things back first.” He vanished the pillows and blankets, and put the picnic back into its basket, the candles were extinguished and they floated back to their resting place.
After Professor McGonagall introduced them to the students in the Great Hall Harry went to take his seat between Hermione and Hagrid’s currently vacated seat at the staff table, how strange that felt, and then he remembered he had something to do. He stood up awkwardly and headed into the chamber where the new first years had now gathered. Hermione gave him an odd look, but he didn’t say anything.
In fact he was so absorbed in the taste of it and the little pink flowers lining the massive fountain that he almost missed the booth an old woman was running. Her voice was what caught his notice, serene and gentle. He turned towards the sound and found her sitting under a brightly colored tent, a small wooden table before her topped with a large clay lump she was shaping. A white poster was pinned to the beam of her tent. In red letters it read ‘Free pottery class, first come first serve.’
“Then paraphrase for us.”
She strode to the door, and threw it open. She was pulling it closed behind her when she paused and said over her shoulder, “Good luck with your roommate.”
Draco laughed, “And you didn’t ask?”
Harry headed back to his room that night and fell asleep rather quickly, tired from flying all afternoon. Once he fell asleep he started seeing faces of those that were gone, hearing spells fire and rebound, screams of pain coming though the night. He was hot, the room was on fire. Flaming animals coming at him from every direction. He was flying trying to get out, but he couldn’t. The scene morphed into flash after flash of green light aimed at loved ones, and then at him. Just as it neared him he jolted awake in bed.
“Harry!” Draco called and Harry soared over to hover by his side.
“Harry? Professor Barlow just asked you something.” Hermione pulled him out of his thoughts.
Friday came quickly, Harry had his exam in the morning and worked the afternoon shift.
“To sharing a bottle of champagne.”
“Sure.”
“What’s wrong?” He asked tentatively,
He practically ran all of the way back to his dorm room and was glad to find that when he shouldered the door open- careful not to jostle the still scaldingly hot coffee- he found that Ron was not there.
Hope you like it
Why was this so hard? He had always been Potter, never Harry. Sure, Potter wasn’t driving him up the walls anymore. Sure, Potter was tolerable now, and not a terrible roommate. Sure, he was maybe just a little attractive. But he was still Potter, the chosen one, the boy who lived... twice now. And he would never pick Draco.
Instead he looked to the piece of parchment in his hands. His schedule, of course.
“Oh… right,” She said, sounding a little disappointed. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t keep you.”
“Room seven!” The hat called and he moved, jerkily, away from McGonagall, towards the boy’s stairs.
“Really? You’d think the gossip magazines would have been all over that break up.”
He paused, the Ministry witch prompted him with the question, “Didn’t his attempts to murder Dumbledore nearly kill two of your housemates, including your best friend?”
“I wonder if McGonagall managed it.” Blaise said, “And who knows if all of the others stayed.”
Please leave comments and kudos to feed our souls
“What, so you’re just going to ignore my mother?” Draco asked, his nerves showing through as irritation. He climbed into the shower with his clothes still on and pulled the curtain closed. He chucked his clothes over the side, hoping to hit the auror with though. He missed, probably for the best though, otherwise the auror could have had him charged for assault.
“Wait. An Andie Tonks moved into the house next door soon after you moved here. She’s an empty nester and sometimes helped me look after mom.” Harry said.
The two then realized they were almost late and had to run to get to class.
He looked over to where Potter lay, sleeping soundly, as though no nightmares plagued him. Potter’s hair was messier than usual (quite a feat) and his lips were parted slightly. He didn’t have his glasses on. Draco looked away, because, well, without his glasses Potter looked... vulnerable.
Once he found that he started chopping up some onions and garlic and threw them in the pan with some oil. He found some meat in freezer to brown up and added that to the pan after defrosting it. He planned to make a meat sauce and pasta, so he set a pot of water to boil.
“It’d be great if you did some grocery shopping. There’s a little stove and an actual oven downstairs so we can actually cook if we want to. But make sure to get some microwave staples too.”
Harry got back after a late dinner, he had had to take a first year to the hospital wing after they had gotten hurt on a trick staircase.
“I love you too, you git.” Harry said, damning the consequences and kissing Draco.
That couldn’t mean anything good. Hesitantly, Draco pressed the green answer button and put the phone up to his ear. “Hello?” He asked, his voice sounded small.
“Can anyone tell us what charm we were studying way back in March before Easter hols?” Asked Hermione, “Hannah?”
“Yes you are, go to sleep before you say something stupid.” Potter said.
Then his father was speaking to him once more. “There’s something there, it could be the scar, stretched tight. Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
“Draco, you’re drunk, go to sleep.” Harry said.
“I guess I should go now. Malfoy is probably done talking to his friends and looking for some alone time with you.”
Harry rang the little bell next to the help wanted sign and out came a fatherly looking man with a green apron on over a Timber Coast hoodie and jeans. “Welcome to the Rise and Grind, how may I help you?” He said.
Pansy seemed to share his thoughts, “Where will our dorms be, there isn’t any room in the dorms.”
Draco sighed, “This will do, I suppose.”
Draco watched everyone fly, contemplating who would make the best team. Of course Potter would be the seeker, he was certainly superior to everyone else, including himself. Draco knew he would make a poor keeper and an even worse beater, so that left him with the position of chaser, which he was adequate at. But he would only take up that role if he was truly desperate, he hoped he would be able to find three chasers.
“Wow, he’s a metamorphmagus?”
He made his way up the stairs and nearly ran into Draco.
Draco groaned, “Must we though?”
“S’Friday, I don’t have class until noon.” Draco murmured, still half-alseep.
But maybe he would be the boy who didn’t have to share with anyone. Maybe the sorting hat would realize that everyone hated him and grant him a reprieve by letting him be by himself. He doubted that too.
“Oh, no, nothing like that actually, we’re going to the Great Hall.”
I had an awful headache Friday night and just got around to posting!!
“Anyway, I’m meeting my friend Gretchen up here anyway, I was wondering if you’d watch Teddy for a few hours.”
“Yes I did. I believe in second chances. And if you were really one of the big bad killer Death Eaters, you likely would have killed me in my sleep by now.” Harry smirked.
Draco directed this thoughts elsewhere and leaned into his boyfriend’s shoulder. They were sitting outside together beneath a great hanging willow. It offered them both privacy and a clear view of the lake and forest beyond. The sky was a bright, brilliant blue void of any clouds. And how was it that Draco had never noticed how lush and vibrant the grass was before? It was as though in these past few weeks the world had grown ten times more beautiful.
The same ministry witch began the questioning once more, “Mr. Dolohov, you were a death eater during the time in which Mr. Malfoy was a death eater, is that correct?”
“What!?” Ron exclaimed, “How could you not tell me? Why just you two?”
Before Harry knew it Draco had wrapped Harry into a hug. For the thousandth time that day Harry felt like crying. They stood there for who knows how long.
“Fine.” He rolled his eyes sarcastically, “So we’re friends. And since we’re friends I get to tell you that I’m in a fight with my father. You happy now?”
“Yeah?”
The next few weeks were rather strange for Harry. He and Malfoy, it seemed had agreed not to interact much on purpose. They shared a room and Harry was his teacher, so there were moments where they talked, but the date seemed like an elephant in the room that neither of them discussed, at least not face to face. Instead they had fallen into the habit of leaving notes for each other to find.
They do feed my soul

“Well you found me,” Draco smiled.
“Ok, Mr. Longbottom, you’re up. Don’t look so worried, this is just like the DA, and since I’m assessing you, you will most likely win.”
Draco sighed, “I guess you’re right, I’ll give it a try, just catch the snitch fast so I don’t embarrass myself too much.”
“Father has already been on trial, Potter testified against him. About him getting the chamber opened in our second year. Him being one of those who attacked at the World Cup, returning when the Dark Lord was reborn, being in the department of mysteries, and calling the Dark Lord when Potter was at our house.” Draco said, and there was no animosity in the words. He wasn’t sure what he felt towards Potter, but he knew one thing for sure. He had let go of his hate he had once held.
Draco stood up, but didn’t seem to want to walk away.
Hey!!!! The chapter is now up! Sorry for the delay! Enjoy!
Brittany looked at Pansy and said, “All good things I hope.”
“Yeah.” Harry stood outside the compartment for a few seconds longer.
He rolled his eyes at the phone and dropped it back to the desk. Draco considered inviting Ron in an attempt to mend their relationship, but he quickly dismissed the idea. It felt rather pointless as he really had no interest in being friends with the sullen redheaded boy.
But be warned, we are both pretty busy so it might be a bit before anything with that can actually happen.
“Your house was You-Know-Who’s home base, yes?”
Harry stepped back and left the room, he now had to go tutor some fifth years who were nervous for OWLs.
“I guess I’ll have to take your word for it.” Draco grinning, giving him a soft kiss.
“Of course without us knowing. Otherwise we’d have to be responsible and take the alcohol back.”
When classes restarted the last week of April a sort of cloud swept over the castle. Everyone could feel it. It was in the haunted looks in the eyes of the upper years, the jumpiness in the lower years, the Slytherins watching their backs for ‘vengeance seekers’ more than usual. The teachers assigned less work, despite exams being right around the corner. The first years, especially Muggle borns, became more of the fans they were back in September than the students Harry had come to know.
“Not like I haven’t heard it multiple times before.” She smiled.
“You ready to let the rabble in?” Harry asked.
Draco shut him up with a kiss.
“And how are your parents?” Blaise asked, turning Draco’s own question back on him. “My mother is fine with it, as always she just wants me happy. But I can tell my dad is pissed. He hasn’t outright said it, but he got so cold and distant after he found out where I was going. And he never brought it up, just left it as an elephant in the room.” Draco shook his head, brushing away his rising annoyance at his father’s inability to properly express his emotions. “It’s whatever. How about you, Neville, how are your parents?”
“Just you and me?”
Blaise gave him an apprehensive look and Draco knew he’d been thinking the same thing.
Harry had no idea what to do so he just let Draco squeeze his hand until the movie finished. Every so often Draco would let go for a few seconds to get his napkin and wipe butter and salt from the popcorn off his other hand, but he’d immediately return his hand to Harry’s. Once the final credits rolled Draco finally seemed to notice that he was still holding Harry’s hand.
“Stop pacing,” The largest auror said, crossing his arms and giving Draco a pointed stare, “You’re going to make yourself sick if you keep that up.”
The way Sirius had been acting the past few times Harry had seen him was odd. At first he thought it was just the holiday season that was coming up, it had always been a rough time for him before he ditched his biological family. But that didn’t seem to be it, he was always more cautious when talking about his work and way more protective of Moony and Harry than usual.
But McGonagall had started speaking again, so he forced himself away from his thoughts, “Now tryouts will be held this Saturday, and they will be led by your team captain, Draco Malfoy.” It took Draco a moment to comprehend her words, but then it finally sunk in and everything made sense. Professor McGonagall wanted Draco to be murdered, there was no other explanation. He couldn’t lead a team full of people who would hate him! And he couldn’t hold trials and refuse people, he couldn’t choose. “And, everyone will be trying out... for every position. We do not have room in this house for hiding talent, so practice and try your best. The newest brooms have been donated by Bill and Fleur Weasley.”
“Hi.” Harry said, offering the bouquet of various colors of warm toned roses, nothing red though, it was a but early for that.
“Are you drunk?” Draco asked him.
“I like it.” Draco said, leaning in.
Harry had never seen his friend that dazed before.
“But one of my education classes is on a Saturday so It’s really just a trade as to which days I consider weekends.”
Harry led the way across campus and into the city. They made a right and a left and a block later they were at a quaint coffee shop of a local chain called Rise and Grind Coffee.
“Would you quit it?” Harry snapped after an hour or so of this.
“Yes. However, she was completely unarmed. When I saw her son during the battle, he was wielding her wand. She gave up her only protection in the middle of the battlefield so that her son could have a chance at surviving.” There seemed to be a pause, apparently the Mistry wasn’t prepared for him to say that.
“Hungry?” He asked and Harry nodded.
“‘Night Malfoy.” Harry climbed into his bed, but left his curtains open, it felt less constricting.
“Listen, Potter... Harry,” Draco began, and Harry turned around, looking him full in the face. His heart stuttered in his chest, but he managed to hold onto his courage. Harry’s eyes were soft, and so very kind, welcoming whatever it was that Draco intended to say. It was calming and in a sense made him braver. It was like the Gryffindor in Harry was rolling off him in waves and rubbing off onto Draco. “There’s something I need to say.”
Draco smiled politely and didn’t respond, but Pansy couldn’t hold in her snort of laughter at how absurd the statements were. “Sorry,” She muttered lowly in between her little bursts of laughter.
“I don’t really like to talk about them.”
“Oh. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”
When the session restarted, Draco was escorted in to hear the verdict. The aurors had pinned his hands behind his back, but Draco didn’t seem to care, his eyes looking up intently at the people who were to decide his mother’s fate.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, for one, we are sharing a room, apparently, and I for one would not want to blow it up in a duel. I am also going to be a teacher this year, so I want to be fair. And three, we are adults, and it is high time to bury the hatchet on a childhood rivalry.”
“Okay… why?”
Some of the class didn’t realize he had actually died. They just thought that he had been hit by the curse and played dead the whole time, at least up until today. Then came questions about what ‘the other side’ was like. Harry found himself physically unable to tell them. Not in that it was emotionally difficult to say, which it was, no, this was more like the fidelius. There was magic at work keeping him from saying. People aren’t supposed to know what happens when you die.
“They didn’t tell me because they hate anything and everything to do with magic. My aunt was jealous of my mum’s abilities when they were small and ended up carrying that hate with her. She married my uncle and they ended up having an obsession with being very normal.”
Harry got dressed in a dark gray shirt and put on a pair of gold snitch shaped cuff links Arthur had gotten him for Christmas. A pair of black pants and his nicest robes, dark red hemmed with gold completed the look.
Holy crap this one’s a whopper! Almost 2000 words, and I did it in mainly one sitting. Tay and I couldn’t not include quidditch in this, so we had a lot of fun discussing who would be on the quidditch team.
Azkaban wasn’t nearly as frightening as Draco had imagined it, nor as disturbing as renderings had depicted it. Draco chalked that up to the fact that the dementors had been removed from the premises. Draco was searched the moment he stepped inside. After several minutes, the guards seemed satisfied that he had nothing dangerous hidden away.
“Morning.” Draco said, working hard to suppress his laughter. “Feeling better?”
Forty-five minutes later, Harry and Draco headed down for Hogsmeade, their trunks levitating behind them. They had reached the border where the Hogwarts’s grounds bridged with Hogsmeade, when Draco saw Professor McGonagall seeing students off and saying their final goodbyes.
Draco shook his head. “No.”
“Bet on a what?” Asked Pansy, finally making her way down the stairs and into the common room.
“You know, Tonks’s mum is testifying,” Jess said nonchalantly.
Draco snorted and crossed his arms, leaning against the polished marble that made up this portion of the Ministry wall. He raised his eyebrows ever so slightly and a smile tugged at the edge of his mouth as he looked at Potter. “And how do you expect us to celebrate?” Draco asked, gesturing to the auror who had positioned himself a few meters behind him.
“Well, I was leading and had only had a crash course. I’d let you lead this dance. From what I’ve seen you must have had some dance lessons growing up.”
“Well done Mr. Malfoy, I think that wraps it up for now. Hermione has a special homework assignment for you, so go take your seats.” Harry went over and picked up his wand. He knew he could have blocked the last spell if he really wanted to, but he also knew that Malfoy, needed a confidence boost, and probably would gain better control over his own wand from disarming Harry. He had sent the wand back via owl post without much to say, but figured that its loyalty needed to be won back from himself.
“Why the hell does Malfoy know?” Ron asked.
Once they finally made it onto the train Draco and Harry went over their plans for the summer together.
“Relax, he’s not a newborn, he’s almost one, you just need to hold him so he can face out, make sure he doesn’t fall, or try to crawl away. He’s pretty active and can pretty much walk if he’s holding onto something. You won’t break him.”
“That was then this is now. He and I are just friends.”
Sorry we missed last week, we had some things going on.
They reached the giant doors and stepped through.
“At least your parents want you back.” Ron said from his desk, startling Draco. “My father has already turned my room into another storage space for all of his dreadful inventions. He dismantled my bed for some scrap parts and he sold the rest of my things on eBay so he could buy this thing he’s been wanting for a while to help with his ‘creative process.’ He sent me pictures and everything. Even gave me the eBay link and said I could bid on anything I wanted. As if he doesn’t know I’m a broke college student.”
“Well go on then,” Harry prompted expectantly. He crossed his arms, but it wasn’t in an imposing way nor threatening at all. Everything about Harry’s stance demonstrated openness, to Draco, who knew Harry’s body language better than he should have. Better than any roommate should have. “Anytime now.” Harry said, smiling slightly.
“A charm bracelet,” She paused to examine the charms, a dragon, a narcissus, a tree, and a charm of the andromeda constellation, “It’s beautiful, thank you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s at the coffee shop, or maybe the library.”
The rest of the class queued up, a short while later. No one looked at Draco.
“Thank you Mr. Potter.” The wizard said, his face expressionless.
Draco had been shocked these last few months to find that the articles about him hadn’t all been awful. In fact, very few of them sought to damage his reputation at all, in most cases they defended him or even said they understood.
When Draco finally made it back to the manor, the sun had sunken behind the treetops, basking the sky in a golden-pink hue. Inside, his mum was waiting for him, dinner sitting untouched on the table.
Okie doke, here’s my chapter! I’m on vacation right now, so excuse if it’s a little rough! I haven’t gone through and proof read it at all. Sorry! Hope you enjoy it anyways! Love you all!
“Hey, love,” Harry said, coming over, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist, and planting a chaste kiss on his lips. Harry slid into the seat beside Draco and asked, “So how is daddy dearest?”
“We should get going Ron, sorry to ditch you here Har, but it’s date night.” Hermione said after a moment of silence.
They walked along in a companionable silence, eventually coming and stopping at a bookstore to let Teddy in from the cold. Harry lifted Teddy out of the stroller so he could look around for a bit, he sat on one of the cushy chairs and sat Teddy in his lap.
Teddy and Andie stopped by for lunch. There was a camera that had been charmed to follow Teddy, and consequently whoever was holding him at the time, around making sure to capture all kinds of photos of his first Christmas.
He had no idea who he could possibly be rooming with.
He had been buried in books and slices of parchment, in the spot most similar to a corner, in the eighth year common room. This happened to be the little nook beneath the boy’s staircase. Granger had taken up the opposite spot on the girl’s side. Draco couldn’t help but notice that Potter was sitting off towards the side as well, with Longbottom and Weasley. Longbottom was working on something that seemingly came ease to him, Draco suspected Herbology since that was his best class by far. Potter was pouring over a long piece of parchment, with minuscule handwriting, likely lesson plans from Granger. Weasley was staring distantly out onto the grounds, a look of utter confusion plastered to his face, and his homework, long forgotten upon the table.
“You ok ‘Mione? You seem down.” Harry asked his friend as they took off down one of the halls. They really weren’t supposed to be on the same route, but they had the Marauder’s Map to lead them to any misbehaving students, so they walked together.
After lunch Harry suddenly had a nervous energy. He went upstairs and put on some of his practice quidditch robes, much lighter and conducive to a workout than the game robes.
He jumped when he heard the sound of the compartment door sliding open. His eyes snapped up. There were Blaise and Pansy, standing awkwardly before him.
A bit shorter (and later) than normal for me, but I’m glad I got this much with the way my attention span has been lately.

“Dammit!” Came a cry from the kitchen where Remus was finishing up dinner.
“We’re gonna get you ready for your date, duh.” Said Ginny, who had moved to open his wardrobe and started tearing it apart.
—Appie
“Okay, but before I go, I’ll give mine so you can keep the game going,” she looked around the group “Harry truth or dare?”
Hermione let out a small laugh, “Ron’s gonna be mad that Draco found out before him.”
Many of the others were very close, the mist almost taking shape for many of them. Eventually the circle kind of deformed due to people turning to look at whoever had just gotten their patronus.
“I thought he’d never leave.”
“Yeah, sorry, I’m just running late and I really just fucked something up I think.” He darted over to his side of the room and grabbed up his tennis things for speeding across the campus, taking care to avoid any paths Harry might have taken. He ended up going around the long way, making him very late to tennis.
“Did you ever think he might become a death eater?”
“Nice to see you too Luna.” Harry replied unsure if the wrackspurts thing was good or bad.
“Sounds good. Moony pointed out a cafe within walking distance. I think there’s a bookstore along the way in case you want to stop in.”
Rather than standing there uselessly until she returned, he decided to begin unpacking on his own. He opened up all of the boxes until he located every single one containing clothes and then began sorting them into the drawers of his dresser. He’d filled the dresser about halfway before Pansy returned with Blaise and another boy. They immediately began helping him to unpack and Draco soon learned that the other boy was Blaise’s roommate, Neville. He was quieter than Pansy and Blaise, but Draco supposed that was likely because he didn’t really know any of them all that well. Even so, he was nice and held conversation with them. He was incredibly efficient at unpacking and Draco could have sworn that he was responsible for over half of the boxes’ contents being emptied into the room.
Draco landed and found Harry, standing a ways off, the snitch clutched in his hand. He rushed over and wrapped Harry in a bone crushing hug. Moments later, Ron was there, then Hermione and Blaise, then Pansy and Hannah and the whole team was hugging and laughing. This put them at the top going into the House Cup Championship matches.
Draco tried his best to smile. He wasn’t sure if he had pulled it off, but they entered anyway. Pansy immediately plopped herself down upon the opposite bench, lying comfortably, with her head propped on a hand.
Hope you enjoyed! Remember to leave comments and kudos! We’re getting down to the final chapters here and there will be a lot of double updates coming up, so be on the lookout. :)

Harry was busy with grading all of the Defense exams, he’d started with the eighth years and begun working his way down. For obvious reasons, Draco hadn’t been allowed to help him with the eighth years, but once Harry finished up with them, he and Draco had split Harry’s work between them. Surprisingly the pair of them worked well together and finished up all of Harry’s grading before Hermione had even finished half of hers. Granted she had a few more exams than they did, even so, to Draco it felt like an accomplishment.
“Right.”
“Teachers included. We’ll need a new potions master.” Slughorn had gone back into retirement and Snape was dead. “And a transfiguration teacher.” McGonagall was the headmistress now. “Muggle Studies.” He had watched Charity Burbage die. He pushed the thought from his mind. “Defense Against the Dark Arts.” That position had been occupied by Carrow.
Occasionally he fiddled with a camera instead of studying and would take pictures around the shop. One time he even asked Harry to watch his stuff while he went out and took pictures on the street. When he came back in he was frowning down at his phone.

The whole team glared at him as the coach made them all run suicides as punishment for his tardiness.
Draco desperately needed to clear his head, so he pulled on his tennis shoes and went out for a morning run. All of the students were either still asleep or avidly studying for there last few midterms of the semester in the libraries or in their dorms.
Once everyone was seated, Harry began the lesson, “Okay, so I know we’re all feeling pretty shitty after yesterday and likely all should be seeing mind healers, so I thought it’d be nice to do a more uplifting lesson. But fair warning we are starting the real review for NEWTs tomorrow.”
“I have to know did you mean it?”
“Only when they’ve wronged me.” Draco replied and didn’t stop walking. Harry fell into step beside him, utterly oblivious to the rush Draco was clearly in.
“I’ve been curious as to how you came up with the Great Hall for a date.”
Draco decided that he wasn’t hungry and left the hall, with one final glance in Potter’s direction. Granger seemed to be worrying over something, per usual.
“I was sitting under the stairs, I tried to pull you under there with me.” Draco said, “I’m sorry, I had no idea.”
“This is the part where we would normally go our separate ways.” Draco said, trying to fill the silence.
“Do you make a habit of insulting inanimate objects in public?” A voice asked and Draco’s head snapped up. He found Harry standing there, a few feet away from him. Just his luck.
But then Harry spoke, his voice gravely and cracked. “Bring some for both of us? Eat up here with me?”
They sat together for over an hour, basking in each other’s warmth before Harry began to really eat, rather than picking at it. Fearing Harry would stop if Draco acknowledged the change in any way, he leaned over and swiped a book from the nightstand, idly flipping through the pages and pretending to read it, while secretly sneaking period glances in Harry’s direction.
A few classmates looked concerned. Ron was the only calm one, in fact he was practically asleep.
Sharing a room with Malfoy wasn’t really all that interesting, Malfoy tended to ignore him, so Harry responded the same way. He did notice though that Malfoy had taken to studying under the staircase, apparently so had Hermione. Harry himself would never be caught dead anywhere near that area, it reminded him of the Dursley’s too much. He enjoyed doing his work over on the couch or in the library, grading was exclusive to his desk.
“Good morning Harry.” She smiled.
Two days passed, and he could see more and more of her shining through to the surface.
“Yes this is him.”
“Sure.” Malfoy held out his hand. For Harry to shake and Harry took it. “Goodnight then.” Draco pulled back his hand, crawled into bed, and drew the curtains shut.
Draco sighed, long and slow. Even if his father did miss him, he’d never admit it. “That isn’t what I asked.” He snapped.
“I am.”
Harry shrugged innocently. He knew that he and Hermione were teaching the eighth years first, as a way of easing them into teaching. McGonagall was making her way around the hall passing out the Eighth year schedules, by the time she got to their table most of the students had finished breakfast.
None of it mattered. It was ancient history, long since forgotten. Or so Draco told himself.
Harry lifted the snitch into the air above his head, signaling that the game was over and the eighth years had won.
He knew there had been plenty of people who had seen the Dark Lord order Draco to kill Dumbledore. And Potter had known, that whole year, Potter had known what Draco was trying to do. For a moment, he wished Snape had just let Potter kill him in that bathroom.

“It’s the house partly, of course I’ll be glad to see my mum again, but I loathe that house. But majorly, I’ll miss this, you, us... being here together.” Draco mumbled, embarrassed with himself.
“Mom we texted yesterday. We text everyday.” Draco reminded her gently as he stood, squeezing the phone between his shoulder and ear to free up his hands so he could pack his things more easily.
Draco lifted the corner of his mouth in a half smile and went back to packing. Five minutes later he had stopped again and found himself staring out their window.
“You’re welcome.” Harry smiled, and threaded his hand through Draco’s.
He supposed he hadn’t really been a child, well, ever. But he hadn’t thought of himself as an adult until now.
“They hated me, the dark skinned, magical, orphan, dropped on their doorstep in the middle of the night one November. To them I was everything not ‘normal’ and therefore not right with the world. Didn’t help that I’m not straight, like hell I’d ever tell them that though. Until my first Hogwarts letter arrived, they made me sleep under the stairs in a little cupboard.”
Harry turned to the students and put up a sound barrier between the two halves of the classroom “Okay each of you will have a go at dueling your roommate. Use the most complex spells you know that are not lethal, illegal, or able to cause severe bodily harm. Mr. Longbottom you’ll be  with me, is that okay?” The group seemed taken aback that he used Neville’s last name. Harry too, thought it was strange calling his friends by their last names like that, but he thought it would help him get into the habit for the younger years.
“You’re not uncomfortable are you?”
“Or maybe he’s dropped out and is trying to get himself into another school. Maybe he hates you.” Pansy said, her tone mocking. “World doesn’t revolve around you, genius. He’s probably just the type that’s always running behind schedule.”
At the end of their last class for the week, Pansy came up to Harry- who was at his desk- slapped a note down, and left the room.
Harry’s mood was growing more and more sour as the night wore on, and with it went Draco’s. Though rather than becoming sour, he became anxious to the point of constant pacing around their dorm room.
Draco looked up in Harry’s eyes, trying to figure out if he was being genuine. “I’ve never been a chaser before, I have no idea if I’d be any good at it.”
Harry realized in that moment that he was utterly screwed.
The rest of his spare time was spent hanging out with friends. He had met Ron, who was actually Draco’s roommate in the athletics class he had dropped, but they hit it off and became friends and joined the frisbee club together. He also hung out with Hermione and Pansy and Pansy’s friends, Blaise Neville, and Draco.
Draco groaned and quickly changed the subject. “Aren’t we getting Blaise?”
Harry tore into the gift and found an expensive looking jewelry box. He opened it and pulled out two necklaces. “Necklaces?”
the game dwindled out close to midnight and Harry and Hermione returned to their room. Hermione passed out nearly immediately, but he noticed that she had shoved the paper with Pansy’s number into the back of her phone case. Harry laid down in his own bed and eventually was claimed by sleep.
“Hey Ron, is Draco home?”
The terror Draco was feeling made his appetite disappear. He attended most meals, pushing around the food on his plate, but never actually eating, until Pansy began to notice. So he hid out in his room during as many meals as he could, claiming to have the house elves bringing him food.
“This house is the only good thing to come of my family, well as far as I know.” Sirius started leading them through the living room, “When my mother dies she left it to anyone who could prove they were related, and if it wasn’t claimed in thirty years it was to be turned into a historical sight, something along the lines of ‘The Historic Black Family Estate.’ Since my parents hadn’t done anything to legally disown me, I was able to stake my claim when we moved here. Luckily my cousins didn’t want it, Bella is in jail for life, Andie didn’t want it, and I’m pretty sure Cissa was afraid of it. Not that I blame her, I almost decided to demolish it and rebuild when we got here.”
“Hi Har! I’m gonna go change then I’ll be right down.”
“We should get going.” Harry said and stood up. The three headed back to the dorms to get their things. When Ron was ready first, that was shocking really, Harry told him to go ahead, saying that he and Hermione wanted to show up together.
“Yes, we’re friends. That came out wrong, I’m just really kind of freaking out right now because I keep getting insanely cryptic phone calls from my parents. One telling me constantly that I need to come home and the other telling me to stay away and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what’s going on with them and I don’t know whether or not I need to be worried.”
“Well I am not a part of the people who grew up knowing about magic. My relatives knew. I didn’t until Hagrid broke down our door an my eleventh birthday.” Harry said, trying his best to end the conversation.
He got his wand checked and then made his way down to the courtrooms. He was running a bit behind that day because he had decided to dress up for the occasion. He had on a dark green button down, to show his support for the Slytherin and to make his eyes stand out, black trousers, and a matching dress robe. Even his hair had decided to behave that day.
The meeting was over just in time for a small late lunch and then Harry and Hermione set off to get their classroom ready for the new term.
Draco had absolutely no idea what that meant, but he resumed walking as he doubted Blaise and Neville would divulge anything of real use. They wished him a goodnight before vanishing into their own dorm room and leaving Draco to walk the rest of the way on his own. He had barely made it two steps when his phone began buzzing from inside his pocket. He pulled it out to see who was calling him at one in the morning, to find his father’s contact photo staring up at him.
The actual day of was on a Sunday, no classes, though he was pretty sure McGonagall would have cancelled them if it were a weekday.
Draco hadn’t yet moved to the coffee table so he was at the study nook in the corner. Harry went over and tapped him on the shoulder.

Harry waited out the fifteen minute recess in his seat. He considered going out after Draco, but since the trial was still in process they might be finicky about letting someone interact with the convicted death eater, regardless of their relationship status.
A few stood, but clearly not a majority.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered, flicking out the candle, “Lost track of time.”
He stepped inside, closing the door gently behind him with his foot and dumped the box with everything he’d brought up onto the desk. The rest was in his car, but he wouldn’t bring it all up until his roommate arrived, hopefully with a parent who would help them both with unpacking. He pulled out the packet he’d received once he’d committed to Timber Coast University and scanned it, looking for his roommates name. He always forgot things when he was nervous, and he was especially bad with names. After a minute of searching, he finally located the name; Ronald Weasley. It was a peculiar name, but no more so than his own was.
“I’m not the biggest fan of horror.”
“I swear, Har, if you lose to her, she’ll never let you live it down.”
He was still pondering it as he fell asleep that night.
It was well after ten by the time he went down to set up. He snagged the flowers from his classroom and went back up to the dorms.
“Yes, and if you don’t mind, I will say my piece and take my leave. I have a one year old grandson at home that I should get back to.”
Down the corridor, a door opened and a stout ministry witch scurried out. “Come on in Mr. Malfoy.”
“I’m sorry. When I saw you kissing Malfoy, I freaked out. I guess I never thought you two would actually like each other. I suppose I needed a bit of time to process what I saw. I want you to know I really don’t care who you date so long as they treat you well. I can tell you’re really happy with Malfoy. I noticed you and him weren’t talking though, I hope everything’s all right and I didn’t mess things up between you.”

Draco leaned in and kissed Harry’s cheek and they left the courtroom hand in hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
They also got their campus maps, student ID’s, which functioned as meal cards, and those who hadn’t requested a roommate or had not met the early deadline got room assignments.
Pansy gave a little shrug before pulling him further into the room. “I don’t know, one of Brittany’s friends I guess. She said it was an open invite. Something about trying to get people to meet each other and make new friends.” She winced as they walked past a couple who were making out a tad too passionately for such a public location. Draco quickly averted his eyes as they girl’s skirt rode up just a bit too high.
“Oh I’m sorry.”
“Thank you, that will be all.” The witch said, evening out a stack of paper. “Now for our final witness, Mr. Harry Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and peer to Mr. Malfoy.” Draco gulped, this was what he was most nervous for, Potter had a lot on him. This could go very poorly.
“How was practice?” Harry asked.
Draco was a little anxious about being alone with Harry, especially when there was going to be drinking involved. An entire bottle of champagne between the pair of them could go a long way if Draco let himself be carried away. If he let himself lose control, he might say something damning… something he wouldn’t be able to take back. But who was he to deny Harry? And anyway, he had no excuse to do so without Harry picking up on the fact that he was purposely avoiding him.
Potter was there, in his house. And so were Potter’s friends, Granger and Weasley. But Potter didn’t quite look like himself, he had been hit with a stinging jinx. Perhaps Draco could lie, say it wasn’t Potter, nor his friends. They would be released, Potter would leave. And then there would be no reason for the Dark Lord to come. Draco hated it when the Dark Lord came.
The male auror spoke then, turning Draco’s attention, “You didn’t read the paper you signed in order to testify, did you?”
“What do you think Harry?” She asked
He regretted not getting to the cultural clubs area that day, he’d wanted to see if there was an Indian cultural club. He’d always felt distanced from that part of his identity with his dad gone since he was little and the high school he went to wasn’t much for cultural clubs like that.
“Aww that’s cute. You’re really good with him.”
“Would Hermione come back with you?” Draco asked, glad to have a distraction from his own thoughts.
OoOoOo Draco made some breakthroughs this week with his feelings towards Harry!!!!! What do you think Harry’s response will be?
and he had been made quidditch captain because of that, even though he felt like one of the older girls should have had it. He never wanted his name to have been put in the goblet of fire. No one asked him if he wanted to be the one who had to kill Voldemort, though he wouldn’t have said no. And of course his teaching was based on stories McGonagall had heard from the members of the D.A.
Harry smiled as Draco led him into the sitting room where Narcissa was sitting on the couch sipping some tea.
Draco got three more inches out before he was interrupted yet again. This time it wasn’t because of his own wandering mind, but rather an announcement from McGonagall.
He leaned back and stared ahead, waiting for the trial to start.
But he couldn’t skip out on Defense Against the Dark Arts, it could be bad for his record, he didn’t need a detention. So, though Draco didn’t want to, he entered Defense Against the Dark Arts for class that Friday. And even worse, Harry would see through any lie he managed to concoct. There would definitely be a confrontation as a result, something Draco was desperate to steer clear of.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course I remember. What do you say? Want to give it a go?”
Draco took it and stood up. They exited the room, tailed by an auror.
Once he served Draco his drink and his muffin the rest of the afternoon went well. He bought a sandwich before he left so he could eat dinner before Draco came over.
Hermione’s face lit up, “Harry and I are teaching defense!” she blurted.
“Well?” Pansy asked, her voice ringing throughout the otherwise silent room.
By the following night, Ron still was refusing to speak to Harry, something Draco could tell that Harry was really bothered by. His reassurances that ‘everything would be alright’ and ‘Ron would come around eventually’ did nothing to convince either of them. For, they both knew, Ron could be quite stubborn when he wanted to be.
Draco smiled then stared down to where Teddy had gripped one of his fingers. “He’s squeezing a bit tight.”
Of course Draco thought it had something to do with him, Harry hated himself for making Draco feel that way “It has nothing to do with you.”
“I texted you!” She said, glaring. “This is the twenty first century! You could do to check your phone every once in a while!”
“It’s got to be awkward playing your girlfriend.” Malfoy said in an awkward attempt at conversation.
“Well, I guess that’s goodnight.”
Before he knew it it was already six thirty, meaning breakfast was opening up. Harry realized how hungry he was and made his way up from where the patrol route had landed him in the dungeons to the Great Hall. He still had a while to go before he was off duty, then he had Transfiguration right after, not to mention Delacroix was probably going to be tired and snappy today because of Harry’s lateness to patrol. He also had second years to teach. That was the worst year, because they all remembered him showing up at the battle, and then them being promptly sent home, but were too young to know any decency regarding personal questions. The first years were at least too wary to ask questions. He also couldn’t forget quidditch practice, Malfoy would probably have his hide if he missed the first one.
“Ahem.” A voice called from behind them.
“If by ‘let’ you mean she didn’t stop him, then yes, she let him set his base at our house. But do not be mistaken, she did not want him there. At that point, even my dad was sick of him. But there was no stopping him, not if you wanted to live.”
Another step. And this time, he forced himself to keep on walking. Before he could lose the little courage he had, he opened the door to their dorm and strode inside.
“Well, since we’re friends, it’s my job to pry a bit more and ask what’s the fight about?”
Draco sighed, long and slow. He watched Harry’s chest rise and fall and rise again, in that gentle rhythm. Draco began to match it and then finally, he drifted into a restless sleep.
There was a long bout of silence between the two of them, in which time the villain of this particular film appeared suddenly directly behind the protagonist and several of the girls watching screamed. Just as enough time had passed for Draco to think the conversation was over, Harry blurted out, “You can hold my hand if you need to.”
Someone’s wand alarm went off the next morning, likely Draco’s. Harry reached across Draco and slapped it onto the floor making it shut off.
Pansy devoted herself wholeheartedly to flirting with Hermione, a task that surprisingly involved little drinking on Pansy’s end. Draco didn’t mind though. When she wasn’t looking he kept sneaking sips from her cup, rather than getting himself another. The four of them made light conversation- just surface level stuff- and Draco found that Harry was rather pleasant company.
He went to a little jewelry shop to buy some nice, but not overly expensive earrings for Hermione, who had decided to get a second set of piercings over the summer. He also got a nice pin for Mrs. Weasley, and an everblooming flower crown for Luna. Next he meandered towards Zonko’s for something for Ron. He had already ordered a Muggle dart board for Ginny, a set of watercolors for George who had taken up painting in the wake of Fred’s death, and some Muggle records (including ones in French) for Bill and Fleur who already had a record player. He had gotten both Mr. Weasley and Charlie Muggle radios. Though Mr. Weasley’s was the most modern design so he could have fun picking it apart and Charlie’s was more similar to the design of a Wizarding wireless.

As he laid down and looked up at the stars he had charmed onto his ceiling. Draco’s letter sat on his bedside table, he had read it through about a million times, but he still had no idea how to respond.
“Now, Slytherin and Gryffindor are in need of new heads of house. So, Professor Barlow and Professor Delacroix have graciously volunteered to take up the positions. Professor Barlow will be the head of Gryffindor and Delacroix for Slytherin. Now, we are in the process of bringing the houses together. The houses and the sorting will remain for purposes of Quidditch, dorms and heads of house. However, class schedules will be different. All classes will be mixed with all four houses. Now, without further ado, onto the sorting!”
When they got back into their dorm Harry decided to ask Hermione about it.
“That’ll be right up.” Harry made the drinks quickly and plated the pastries, giving Hermione a chocolate cookie. He gave them their orders and proceeded to start closing the cafe.
Malfoy is found guilty of. For the crime of the use of the Unforgivable curses, those who say guilty please stand.”
“Oh right, that.”
“I brought chocolates.”
Harry was astounded that no one had interrupted her. She returned to her seat and then it was his turn.
He read it through once more before deciding it was high time to construct a response. Then he remembered Harry’s gift to him. He had been so focused on the words themselves that he had forgotten about the gift entirely.
“You alright mate?” Ron asked, raising his eyebrows from where he sat on his bed, his legs crossed and a book settled in his lap.
Short one this week. :) I hope you like it!
He was a Death Eater. Even now he couldn’t believe it sometimes. That he had really let it happen. Why hadn’t be fled or asked for help? Draco knew the answer to that though. Because he had thought that the person whom he trusted most at Hogwarts had been the Dark Lord’s greatest supporter. He had desperately wanted Snape’s help, but his pride... and his fear, had gotten in the way. And now, finding out that Snape had been good after all, it hurt more than he had wanted to admit.
“Oh stop it,” Draco said, laughing.
“What’s new in the city today?” Asked Harry.
Harry reached for the door and let Draco step inside.
“Could you show me?” Malfoy asked. Harry assumed that this willingness to talk coming from the ex-Slytherin was probably due to sleep deprivation and decided to go along with it. Harry used his magic to position his bed nearer to Malfoy’s.
Molly turned around from where she was working, “Oh, good morning Harry, dear. You’re here awfully early, would you like some tea?”
“Okay, so I know we’re all feeling pretty shitty after yesterday and likely all should be seeing mind healers, so I thought it’d be nice to do a more uplifting lesson. But fair warning we are starting the real review for NEWTs tomorrow.”
They both turned their attention to Draco. “Do you want to add anyone in?” Maybe he’d be able to invite Harry…
The Great Hall filled with applause as the hat finished. Harry turned to his sheet “Allen, Lexi.”
“Find that damn snitch.” Harry nodded, “It’s time to end this.” And with that, Harry flew back into the air, swiveling on the spot in search of the snitch. Draco turned to face the rest of his team and said, “Pansy, Hermione, keep up what you’re doing, you too Ron, Blaise, Hannah, we’ve got to get a margin over 150 in case Ginny gets the snitch.” The pair of them nodded and Madam Hooch sent us off again.
It had started with Draco’s response to Harry’s note from the first night of the new term. It had been a day or two later and Draco had talked about how his friends had had a bet on them. That had made Harry laugh for a good ten minutes. Draco had also asked for specifics about the date. Harry had told him that it would be after hours on Saturday, a week from when he had replied. They would head out at eleven thirty, since the area they were going to was checked first after the eighth year curfew. It seemed late, but it was a Saturday so they had Sunday to catch up on sleep.
“You teach world history 101 right?” She asked.
Draco nodded and looked relieved “One question, what is a hatchet and why are we burying it?”
Harry got up to stretch his legs about halfway through the day. He wandered through the hallway that had students running to and from their compartments. When he got to the back of the car he noticed an auror standing outside the last compartment, out of which came Draco a moment later, Harry nearly running into him.
Harry remembered getting the summons from Professor McGonagall over the summer. He had been living in Grimmuald place with Andromeda and baby Teddy, they had decided that once Harry had gotten a full time job they would split custody of his godson. He was in the middle of cleaning out one of the spare rooms when he got the owl. He had flooed over to McGonagall’s office in Hogwarts soon after and was a bit surprised to find Hermione there, she and Ron had recently gotten back from Australia with her parents, and she had decided to make up for lost time and stay with them.
“Bullshit!” His father shot back, “You never go anywhere without that thing.”
“Speaking of that day, the reason I even encountered Draco, was that my friends and I were captured by the snatchers. Draco was asked to identify us, I had been hit with a stinging hex that made me less recognizable. I was terrified that we had just been made, that I would have to fight Voldemort then and there. But then, he looked me in the eyes and said ‘It’s not him.’ I knew we were saved, at least long enough to make a plan.”
Draco nodded, “He saved me from Crabbe’s Fiendfyre and from a death eater just after, though that may have been Weasley.”
I think this is actually my favorite chapter of all of the one’s I have written for this fic so I hope you like it!
Draco sighed, “I know,” He flopped on his bed, “It’s just- I don’t want to go.”
“Okay thanks.”
There was something romantic about it too. But Harry chose to ignore that while Draco was leaned against his shoulder.
“Oh really? Please don’t make it too hard, I’m pretty sure no one has the brain capacity for that.”
“Oh, she’s positively ecstatic, she can finally move to someplace warmer, now that she doesn’t have to worry about staying with me.” Blaise replied wryly and Draco laughed. “I think she’s about to move on to husband number eight, it’ll be easier for her to find someone in a different place, you know, where no one knows her reputation.”
Draco froze, still as a statue, as Potter stood and made his way over to the window. It wasn’t until he sat, that Draco noticed that Potter was shaking. Potter stared out the window for several long moments before rubbing his eyes and casting a silent charm. Draco could only guess what spell had been cast, Potter had gotten so good at the silent ones.
Please check out our other fics! If you liked this one you’ll love Tay’s Emma Evans universe.
“Potter?” Draco’s voice was raw, with shock and apprehension. He was confused, why was Potter here? Why had they been paired together?
Tay <3
Harry went to open it to find Ron on the other side.
Draco shook his head, clearing the thought. He had more important things to worry about now. His trial was a week away and he was terrified. Who would be testifying and would they be for or against him. He feared that the majority would do the latter and he would be forced to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban. No one alive had been in the astronomy tower when Dumbledore had been killed, at least not anyone who would tell the truth.
“That’s fine. I’ll get back to you soon, do some other interviews, you can take the cup and return it when you inevitably come back again.” Mr. Orange stood up, that was apparently all he needed to hear.
Harry knew it was bad if Hermione was swearing, “You know you’re one of the best players we’ve got right? You and Pansy are almost as good as the twins were.” Not the best reminder at the moment, but it was all he had to go off of. “You okay?”
But the next part is where the letter became most troubling.
But when the morning came around, neither remembered what had happened when they woke. The only thing they had to show from the night was a pounding headache and a terrible hangover.
That was enough for Sirius to turn around and follow Draco’s line of thought. He studied Draco for another few seconds.
The initial questions like name, date of birth, and things like that were easy. Then there was work experience, he had worked in a local restaurant as a waiter during junior and senior year. There was a spot for awards and volunteer experience, and finally why you want to work at Rise and Grind, and what you would bring to the team.
“A women’s studies class I signed up for on a whim. I might actually end up keeping it if the teacher is any good.”
“Yes, I taught him transfiguration for the first seven and now I am his Headmistress and the head of his house.” She said calmly.
“I know he was marked, and doesn’t have a perfect past, but I don’t think that Draco Malfoy deserves a sentence in Azkaban. He deserves to finish the school year. As his roommate I have never felt uncomfortable sharing a space with him, as one of his teachers this year, he seems to show remorse and is one of the best students I have.” Harry finished and returned to his seat.
“That’s good.” Sirius smiled, “You haven’t been on a date since, when? Your Sophomore year?”
“Hey. I’ve got something to tell you.” Draco said.
“Thank you, that will be all. We will now have a brief recess to discuss the verdict. We will reconvene in fifteen minutes.”
“Why did Pansy keep looking back at me and Draco?”
The fall festival was beautiful, the whole town was decorated in fall colors and twinkle lights. Draco made them stop at the Rise and Grind for coffee and they all ordered fall themed drinks. Pansy got the cliche pumpkin spice latte, as did Blaise. Hermione got some sort of warm apple cinnamon drink, and Draco got a cinnamon hot chocolate. Harry hadn’t been sure what to order, all the fall drinks smelled amazing, so he picked the easiest think to make and went with a caramel latte with a dusting of cinnamon on top.
Harry hummed in response.
Hands shaking, he moved forward, closer to Potter. Come on, say no. Just say no! Lie! Be strong! Be brave!
Draco smiled.
“Well done, Potter.”
“Ron!” Draco exclaimed, then screamed when he received no response. Ron looked around, pulling the headphones off his head and ending that horrible sound. He brightened a little when he saw Draco and even more so as Draco invited him to join in on their little competition.
Finding a group was easy, since Harry was standing with the right amount of people anyway. They colored the ends of their brooms a Gryffindor red and took to the air, Neville was actually decent at flying, for being so nervous.
“Pansy,”
“What else?” Hermione’s interest seemed piqued.
Harry was met with Draco giving him the face of a stubborn child.
All of the Death Eaters that had been rounded up last June were placed under a tracking spell, or house arrest until their trial. House arrest wasn’t exactly feasible with the Malfoys since their home was being picked apart by the aurors. The tracker wasn’t to be removed, if it was and the person was found they would be placed in Ministry custody. There were certain boundaries that if breached would warrant a house arrest apparently, but Harry had no idea what they were.
“What was your last name before you got married?”
“Is there anyone else you’d like to visit while we’re here?” She asked as they reached the lift.
“You wanna hold him?” Harry asked after he noticed Draco staring.
“Nope. I am invoking my Professor powers, and being a listening ear for your problems until lunch is over. I need to forget some of my own for now anyway.”
“Yeah, Neville actually helped me talk him down. He’s come quite far in terms of confidence.” She stared off, her face going to its most natural state, the Hermione thinking face, “I noticed Draco headed up early too.”
Half an hour later, the cafe just needed to be locked, Draco was done with his paper and Hermione and Pansy had finished their drinks.
“See you later.” Ron gave a small wave and left.
“Still. How’ve you been? How was your summer?”
“Come say hi Draco.”
Blaise sat beside Draco and seemed to be scrutinizing him. Draco shifted uncomfortably.
Harry gave a nod and dug into his salad.
“C’mon, our friends are likely waiting to hear the verdict.”
Harry’s mind froze, images of his childhood flashing through his mind.
“Oh?”
“Snape.”
“That’s good. You ever make coffee before?”
“I guess that’s true.” Hermione thought for a second and got up.
“I’ll take a decaf iced coffee with one sugar, no cream.” Harry told the man, “And I suppose the same sandwich.”
The two gave a little cheer from across the table.
“She then went and told Voldemort that I was dead. I assume she was using some of the best occlumency in the world, as he would most certainly have used legilimency to check if she was lying on such an important matter.”
Finally, when it neared lunchtime, Draco plucked up the courage to go and talk to Harry, console him if he could, maybe even get him to eat something. “Love? You okay? It’s almost lunch, I was gonna go down and get some food, do you want any?”
“I don’t have a condensed list of all of the eighth year students quite yet. So we will be going alphabetically through the each of the houses. This means Gryffindor first, then Hufflepuff, followed by Ravenclaw and ending with Slytherin. Hermione Granger!” McGonagall called out.
Harry looked back to where the snitch had been and it was gone.
“I’msorryIwasatotalidiotIshouldhavetrustedyouIloveyou.” Draco said without a breath, almost too quickly for Harry to comprehend the last part.
“Draco, this is so sweet.” Harry leaned over and kissed him, “Now open yours.”
“Yes.”
“Now we match,” Harry pulled out a rainbow flag from the same box and tacked it in the same place above his bed.
“So, Draco,” Daphne began, leaning forward, “How do you feel about the people you chose?”
“Right.” Draco drawled. “I doubt anyone here is going to remember enough of tonight to form any lasting friendships.”
Harry only glared and glared and glared. The minutes stretched on into hours... into days or maybe weeks. Finally, Ron scoffed and went up the stairs, being quite sure to ram his shoulder into Draco on the way up.
Harry stumbled into bed and fell asleep within a few minutes.
A little under two hours later, Draco and Harry had finally made it to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
“My mum’s moved on to husband number eight. She really knows how to pick them, rich and old... or sick. I can’t see this one lasting very long.” Blaise said, his expression souring.
“Thanks for being able to come.” He smiled, and motioned to the door.
Eventually they opened presents, Mr. Weasley’s face lit up when he unwrapped the muggle wireless, and Hermione had put the new earrings on before lunch. Luna immediately had Ginny put the flower crown on her head and she had not taken it off since.
Draco walked in carrying a duffel bag and his tennis racket.
Harry had left the bottle in the mini fridge in his room when he got back. He decided not to put it off any longer, he would study after asking Draco.
“Mr. Potter has too much on his plate, already and Weasley, well, he’s more of a follower, I feel he would not make a good leader.” McGonagall explained evenly.
Harry got a call just as soon as he figured out how to fit all the groceries into their designated food storage shelf and fridge. It was a local number he thought he recognized so he answered it.
“Seriously?”
Draco had not expected such a long answer, and could think of no appropriate response, so he merely nodded his head in vague agreement.
She took the box and neatly unwrapped it, in a way that didn’t rip the paper. She pulled out a simple silver chain with a few charms.
Hermione had written something on the whiteboard on the outside of their door. Gone to the club fair, meet up for lunch in the west dining hall. He also saw something stuck to the whiteboard, a sticky note saying that there was going to be a party down in the game room that night, advising anyone who wanted to steer clear to be in their dorms by eight o’clock and anyone attending to be there at eight thirty.
He ended up buying a pack of playing cards themed after his favorite sci fi series and a few pads of sticky notes to support the business.
“They are roommates Ronald! It makes sense that Harry would share his sexuality with someone he shares a living space with.”
“We moved into a smaller house as soon as the investigation was over. She wanted to be out of the place where her husband died. The killer didn’t take anything or destroy anything, either. We don’t know what they wanted. I think the worst part that came out of that was moving away from my best friend, I never saw him again. I lost my dad and my best friend in the span of two weeks, the one person my age who could have helped, too. I don’t even remember his name, he wanted to be called Prince Dragon whenever we played princes so that’s what I called him. He called me…”
“Maybe I was gonna let you do the asking.”
He wanted desperately to prove them wrong, to show them, he had not had the life he had envisioned for himself. He had never, truly, wanted to be a death eater, a murderer, despite the fronts he put up. He had even boasted about his task to his friends, on the Hogwarts Express before sixth year.
A couple days later were the quidditch tryouts. Harry was, frankly, a bit nervous. He was trying out for all the positions, though he had really never played many of them before. Aside from that he had never actually tried out for anything. He had been volunteered by McGonagall for the Gryffindor team and turned out to be a natural,
When they arrived to class the rest of the eighth years were waiting by the door.
“How’d he die?” Draco paused, “If that’s not too personal, don’t feel like you have to answer that.”
“Well, she wasn’t there the night Voldemort returned. The only Malfoy in that cemetery was Lucius. The next time I saw her she was minding her own business in Madam Malkins the summer before my sixth year.” Harry said
Draco realized he had been staring and quickly looked away, refocusing on his ancient runes essay,
The team walked together down to the quidditch pitch. Blaise and Hannah were discussing something together and had been since breakfast. Padma was in her own little bubble of solitude. Hermione and Pansy were drilling each other on plays leaving Harry and Malfoy walking beside each other at the back of the group.
Now that he thought about it, he remembered Ron saying something about going off to study with some friends at the largest library they had on campus. Good. That meant he would have a few more hours to himself.
The first week of real classes began and the semester was in full swing. Hermione had swim practices every day and had her first meet coming up soon, she had also started seeing Pansy Parkinson. Harry ended up getting the job at Rise and Grind.
“And finally, those who say Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater. And those who believe he is innocent. Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater.” That wasn’t a surprise, he had the mark after all, he had sat in all of the meetings, followed the Dark Lord’s orders.
“Fine.”
Sure he had yet to officially tell even his closets friends about that one. Hermione, Luna, and Ginny knew, but that was of their own devices. He and Draco seemed to have an unsaid agreement not to be obvious about their relationship, but also not overt. It seemed to be working well.
“Good.”
After lunch Harry, Sirius, and Remus drove back to Timberland. Harry joined them for the afternoon and then dinner. By the time Harry felt normal enough to walk back to his dorm it was dark out.
“I have no reason to object, though I expect a bit more of a formal greeting of your new boyfriend sometime in the future. Preferably the near future.” She smiled.
“Sounds good. Also…” Draco trailed off, “Never mind. It’s fine.”
Fortunately he found the answer to his troubles sitting on the edge of his bed and bobbing his head to some very loud music playing over his headphones.
Harry nodded.
“Your drink will be right up.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief, at least he didn’t embarrass himself that much.
“Oh. I still think that the gossip magazines would have been all over that.” Draco smirked.
Draco stood and was led out by his aurors and the witch who had originally fetched him. With a glance over his shoulder he saw a group of aurors leading his mum through the door that led to the holding cells.
“Okay, then what about Longbottom or Granger?” Draco tried.
“Well, Draco?” His father was asking him and he could do it! He could lie and this would all be over. Potter could go back to trying to find a way to kill the Dark Lord and Draco could be free. “Is it? Is it Harry Potter?”
“Yes. We actually discussed it yesterday on our way down to the match, we were talking about Ginny and it just kind of came up.”
If anyone deserved their own room, it was Potter. Potter, who had defeated the Dark Lord. Potter, who had hunted Horcruxes, broken into Gringotts, escaped on a dragon, defeated a basilisk, earned the philosopher’s stone, warded off hundreds of dementors with a single patronus, led a secret club to teach others how to defend themselves, how to fight. Won the TriWizard Tournament, saved his life, despite everything that had happened between them, and done about a million other things, that Draco didn’t know about.
“Nothing, I think you’re just not feeling enough. You have a tendency to over analyze, when it’s your turn just feel, point your wand, and say the words. The rest will work itself out.” Harry said, wrapping his hand around Draco’s wrist to lower it.
“Yes.”
—Tay <3
“Right, but I guess we both have to go in there.”
Draco laughed, but managed to play it off as a cough to keep Harry from glaring at him. Sometimes Draco forgot that Harry was rather oblivious to everything around him. It only made him more fond of him.
“You okay?” Harry whispered.
The two weeks leading up to the trial were utter shit. Draco wasn’t talking to him, and neither was Ron, though Ron seemed to be heading towards some sort of reconciliation. Draco, however, was on edge all the time. Worse than back in the fall when it was his trial. Though, Harry supposed, most were more concerned for their loved ones rather than themselves in times of crisis.
Since she was a halfblood, with a muggle father, she’d grown up with muggle things. Draco had to admit, some of the muggle’s inventions weren’t all that bad. She’d introduced him to some of her favorite movies, books with muggle authors and characters, football, and best of all, music. Of course the wizarding world had music, but it was no where near as advanced or diverse as what the muggles had.
The wizard prompted him before he had even sat down completely, “Mr. Potter, can you begin by telling us all the times you interacted with Mrs. Malfoy beginning with the night you-know-who returned.”
Nymphadora’s friend, who turned out to be named Jess, offered him a reassuring smile when she’d met up to collect him, but it did little to calm his nerves.
“Oh.” Harry smiled and blushed some more. “Well, I don’t know if I like Draco or not. Even if I do, I’m not sure that Draco would want to act on his feelings. We’ve shared a room for almost a whole term and he only said it after he was extremely drunk.”
Harry kissed Draco’s temple, “Hey, love, I’m not going anywhere, I’ll visit as much as you like and we can write and its only six months, then you’ll be free- we’ll be free to do whatever the hell we want.”
Hey everyone! Hope you like the chapter!
Harry lifted up the stool, that was situated off in a corner with the sorting hat. He carried it into the Great Hall and set it down. He turned to the students and pulled the list of names from his pocket as the hat began to
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry this is a bit late! I have not seen Tay face to face in a couple of weeks and we were on different pages (haha i made a pun) when we started writing the chapters for this week so if there are any inconsistencies that’s why. But please KINDLY bring them to our attention down in the comments.
Then the doors opened and Draco was brought in escorted by three aurors.
Harry remembered the conversation he had had with Malfoy, “Yeah,” Harry then tried to distract himself by checking the Marauder’s map.
” Harry murmured as he waved his wand in a star pattern. A beautiful starry sky spread between the canopies of the two beds.
. Cryptic much?
Potter. Potter. Potter. Not Harry. Not Harry.
“Put me on the list, self defense couldn’t hurt.”
So sorry this is late! I fell asleep mid afternoon yesterday and got like 14 hours of sleep.
They clinked glasses and drank. The two moved to sit with their backs against the wall and their legs dangling off the other side of Harry’s bed. Harry’s laptop was between them and they were working on choosing a cooking show.
Once they were sure he was gone, Harry turned to Draco, rubbing the back of his neck and said, “That went well.”
“Azalea Vasven,” She said.
“Have you ever noticed that none of our Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers lasted longer than a year?” Draco asked Harry, still looking at Hermione. For, he knew it he looked at Harry, made eye contact with him, stared into those bright green eyes, he would never be able to look away, never be able to let go. And he desperately needed to let go.
They rode in a comfortable silence watching the lights turn on in the city as the sun set. The lights that were in the trees lining the city streets turned on one by one as the light dimmed, and the band switched over to a slightly less specifically fall themed set.
“I’m sorry Harry, I can’t let you go on your date with this many wrackspurts around you.”
Harry sat impatiently as the wizard paused to count the vote.
A bell chimed two.
“Nothing.”
Draco returned twenty minutes later with a bundle of food. He climbed into the bed next to Harry and laid the little picnic bundle on both their laps.
“That means you must be Sirius.”
“What am I doing wrong?” He asked desperately.
As everyone filed in Harry went over to the teacher’s desk, fighting the natural urge to sit with the rest of the class. He sat back onto it, Hermione standing off to the side.
“That’s because you haven’t. We might not have been speaking, but I still noticed you were awake.”
It didn’t matter that he had always hoped that one day he would be reunited with his long lost friend and now he had been.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand the moment they had crossed over the threshold of the room he had been tried in. It was as though he was only just coming back to his senses, as the relief that had been clouding his judgment cleared away. It was like being doused in freezing cold water, leaving him numb and painfully aware, all at the same time.
Short chapter this week... hope you like it! :)
So they were safe then. No one else would be bothering to pay them any attention. But still, Draco felt like he needed to let go. “Oh.” He said, trying to make it seem like he was only just noticing that his hand had crept into Harry’s. He pulled it away hastily. “Sorry.”
I’m going to miss this...
“You know you can tell me right?”
“The Patronus Charm.” Hannah said.
Draco waited with baited breath as the head wizard who had questioned him cleared his throat and began to speak.
By the time they had reached the changing rooms, the rest of the team was already in their gray and purple Quidditch robes. The team went in to change and gathered in the middle for Draco to give them a pep talk.
Everyone gathered around the TV in the game room, Harry distributed bowls of popcorn and took his seat between Draco and Hermione. Brittany cued up the movie and the opening titles began to play.
The rest of March and April passed with a blur. Draco had gone home for the Easter holidays and Harry had made a visit in the middle of the break, to fulfill that ‘proper meeting’ Narcissa had wanted. Going to the Manor was a bit daunting, but it was that or wait out the next eighteen months until Narcissa could leave, which was a terrible idea for many, many reasons.
Half an hour later the eighth years were up; 70-20, but it was still anyone’s game. Twice Harry had almost reached the snitch, only for Ginny to intercept his path and make them both lose it. Once Ginny had seen it and Harry hadn’t, it had been an arm’s length away when Hermione had sent a Bludger her way, knocking her from her broom. She had been fine, and flying again within a minute, but at that point, the snitch had once again disappeared from sight.
Draco’s problems with his dad suddenly seemed so very small and insignificant in the face of Neville being orphaned before he could so much as walk. Draco opened his mouth to speak but before he could form the words, they heard a car door slam outside. Draco turned to the window and watched as Ronald stepped out of an old minivan, an older woman who couldn’t have been anyone but his mother hobbled out of a slightly newer minivan beside him.
“You got a problem with them Potter?” Draco asked, almost defensively.
Harry went and joined his mother, aunt and cousin. A few minutes later they were joined by Sirius and Remus. The two cars caravanned over to the diner that James had always liked.
“Oh, right. Andie this is my boyfriend,” He paused tentatively to wait for any sort of reaction from either of them, “Draco. Draco this your Aunt Andromeda.”
“We should go out to celebrate moving in.” Harry says.
P.S. For those of you who are in school(or literally just alive in this cursed year), I know things are super stressful right now (for Appie and I as well) so just remember to step back and take a breath every once in a while. We love you all. <3
“What? He saved your life twice?” Pansy whisper yelled.
He could tell some of the kids had heard of the Slytherin reputation. “No house is better than any other and you will have classes and be able to eat with friends from different houses.”
There was a short line of people, mostly college students ordering breakfast and coffee. A tv that wasn’t on the previous night was now on and playing the local morning news, something about a break in and a murder, just like his dad, Harry did his best to block that out and focus on getting his coffee.
“Looks like Potter’s our new seeker everyone!” Malfoy called “Meet the rest of you new team.” Malfoy said motioning to the people he had called down. “Weasley is keeper, Granger and Pansy are beaters, and the rest are our chasers. Now you all smell go take a shower and get your homework done.”
“Sorry we’re late!” Hermione said as Harry went to undo the spell that locked the door.
“And Mr. Malfoy was one of your students, was he not?”
“Couldn’t you tell me what you’re going to say, you know, about her?”
“Careful,” Harry said, “Your Malfoy is showing.”
Not someone, Draco.
Luckily that was right on his usual lap around the top of the playing area. He put on just a hair more speed than usual and as he passed by he reached out and plucked the unsuspecting snitch from the air. He made Ron nearly fall off his broom in the process, because Harry had had to get closer to the goals than usual.
“’Kay, have fun Pans.” Blaise said, giving her a quick hug.
Harry had started to head back to his own bed when he heard, “Why’d you wake me up?”
Draco was scrunched between Pansy and Blaise, the latter was asleep with his head on Draco’s shoulder, drool pooling in the corner of his mouth. After an indiscernible amount of time, Pansy hauled Blaise up and half dragged, half carried him to his dorm room, leaving Draco alone.
They sat down and looked through the course books they received at orientation while they ate. Hermione took a pen out of her purse and started circling classes she wanted to look into more.
Harry felt his heart do a flip. He had finally done it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Go on without me, I’ll catch up.” Draco said. Harry gave him a questioning look, but still made his way towards the Hogwarts Express. Draco stood there for a moment watching his boyfriend go before he turned and headed in the direction of McGonagall.
“Ah yes, Mr. Malfoy, please sit.” She said.
“Yep. And you’re Remus right?”
Draco smiled, then grabbed his bathroom bag and left the room, leaving Harry to finish the grading he had started the night before.
Soon enough into the game Harry heard the familiar tune of ‘Weasley is our King’ coming from where he knew the remaining eight eighth years sat. They must have sonorused their voices, or maybe were joined by one of the other houses rooting for the eighth years because they were loud enough to be heard over the crowd of students.
“A bit. But mostly because I’ve got an interesting lesson planned for the eighth years this morning.” Harry replied ominously.
The eighth years trudged to the common room, specially made for them. Draco was surprised to find it, pretty. A bright purple was balanced out with gray to fill the room. Plush armchairs and sofas were strew about and a fire danced in the hearth. Portraits and tapestries, befitting all four houses, adorned the walls. The only thing that threw Draco, was the fact that, the room was circular. Sure, he knew it made sense, they were inside of a circular tower, but even so, it made him uneasy. There were no corners to lurk in, hide in the shadows of. He would not be able to survive this year, if he couldn’t go unnoticed.
Ginny and the other Gryffindors came over and congratulated them on their win and then they headed their separate ways to the changing rooms.
“Ready to admit that you’re stalking me yet?” Harry asked pleasantly, as though he was merely remarking on the fine weather they were experiencing.
“Okay.”
“Cool.” She said absentmindedly.
Harry made to dive for the snitch, a moment later Layla noticed and followed. The snitch had buzzed around towards the Gryffindor goal posts and Harry made a sharp turn and followed. Layla, who was earlier in her dive, was able to pull away quicker and had nearly caught up by the time he reached the goal posts where the golden ball had started hovering. Or at least Harry had thought it had. It had disappeared once more.
“I’ve picked up a few things in solitude, experimented. By the time you come back, who knows, maybe I’ll be able to bake too.” She joked. And there she was, Draco’s old mother. The one he had known when he was little. The one who joked, and laughed and read him stories before tucking him into bed. The one who didn’t have a thousand regrets lying behind her eyes.
“Watch out there Harry!”
Harry was so sad, and Draco inwardly kicked himself for forgetting what today was another anniversary of. Harry’s father had died on this day fourteen years ago. His friend had been ripped from his life fourteen years ago. The experience had been traumatic for him, so he could only image how much worse it had been for Harry.
“And will you?” Draco asked, “Stay, I mean.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Harry asked. “I can try to help you figure out what’s up with them if you want.”
“Only you Potter.”
Then he was being asked about Granger. “Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?”
Draco followed the witch into the circular room and took the empty seat beside his mother. She was bound to the chair, just as he had been during his trial. When he sat, he expected the chains to entrap his as well, but they remained dormant. He sighed, a little relieved.
“Hello Draco, Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter, I’d like to thank you for what you said today. I don’t like to think what would have happened today if not for you.”
Aside from the gold buttons and glitter, those were a little much, he looked good.
Harry smiled and ran a hand through Draco’s hair. “Should we talk about what we said. Before your mother interrupted us?”
“Right. That was today.”
“Yeah, I’ll just go.”
It took him a moment to regain his voice. “Yes.”
“Okay, now that everyone’s here I’m gonna start tryouts.” Draco said, “I- er, I’m gonna- Merlin, how do Potter and Granger do this everyday?”
Pansy smirked and said conspiratorially, “That isn’t what Mione said. She was quite excited that you two were finally making things official.” She flopped backwards so she was laying on the bed, looking directly upward. She squinted at the ceiling for a moment before she shot back to a sitting position, her eyes wide.
And the third photo depicted Draco holding up a little black lab puppy- his dog Zoe. She was four now and an absolute menace. His heart jolted with a sudden sadness at the thought of having left her behind. It wasn’t as though he could have taken her here with him though. He knew it, but a part of him still felt so very guilty about it. He missed her terribly and it hadn’t even been twenty four hours yet.
Draco opened the large package that Harry had given him.
“Yeah, well, you had already done to the end of February. You okay?”
Draco thought there were some things that the Hogwarts staff needed to work out.
“No, she didn’t want to be a death eater.”
“Oh, it’s just you. Sorry. Where’ve you been all day?”
Harry sighed. “We’ll talk in the morning, Draco. Go to bed.”
“Narcissa Malfoy, you are hereby charged with allowing a terrorist residence in your home and playing part in his schemes. You shall be sentenced to eighteen months on house arrest and three years probation with regular ministry check ins. Do you understand?”
After a brief recess, it was time for the verdict. Draco stopped breathing. He wouldn’t begin again until it was over, one way or the other, it would be over soon.
“No you won’t.”
By the time they finished Hermione had shown up and was sitting side by side with Neville on the front desk.
Draco was working in the little nook that he liked to work in in the common room. Harry gave a little wave and headed up to their room. He had just left the bathroom and was about to collapse onto his bed when Draco pulled him into a kiss.
“What?” He faltered, somehow surprised by the question.
And with that Pansy lead the group out of the building. Harry followed along, unsure of what just happened.
Potter.
Harry had always enjoyed the thrill of scary movies; not much actually frightened him, and they never really gave him nightmares. He really just enjoyed the suspense of a well written horror movie.
Harry showed off his stag and Hermione, her otter and then they were off all trying to produce their own. Ron of course got his Jack Russel Terrier to make an appearance without issue, followed almost immediately by Ernie Macmillan’s boar.
Not difficult at all. (/s)
He went out to the pitch and ran a lap around the field before running some drills on his broom. He went in for dinner, then decided it would be smart to go take a shower.
Harry snorted and stood up, stretching his limbs and offering Draco a hand. Draco took it and Harry pulled him into a standing position. “I’m not enough of a benefit then?”
Leave comments I’m sure she’d love to hear them!
“I’m tired. Are you okay with that?”
“Voldemort cursed the position, the curse broke when he died, so Hermione and I could stay as long as we wanted.” Harry explained.
Hope you like it!
While he roamed the halls looking for threats or out of bounds students Harry couldn’t help but let his thoughts wander to Draco. He had woken Harry up, that had never happened before. Draco always seemed too afraid to do anything so bold, Harry guessed would be the correct word even though what Malfoy did wasn’t all that bold. Malfoy had seemed subdued this year, not wanting attention like had almost every other year. Though that might have something to do with his upcoming trial.
Harry headed into the common room after he finished proctoring the final exam of the day, the sixth years. His boyfriend was holed up in the little seat that had been put under the stairs to the boys dorm. Draco really hadn’t sat there a lot as of late, it seemed to have been his hiding place at the beginning of the year more than anything.
“Yeah?”
Harry pulled himself away from Draco and continued past the stairwell to his dorm where he collapsed into his bed.
Beside him, Harry leaned over and muttered, “Are you okay?”
They got through the entire rest of the movie like that. Once it was over and the lights came back on and everyone started to get up and head upstairs, Draco felt like it was time for him to release Harry’s hand. The last thing he needed was for Pansy or Hermione to see them like that.
“I brought you some food.” Harry said.
“Am not.” Draco retorted, scrunching up his nose.
The day finally came. October thirty first. Halloween. The fourteenth anniversary of his dad’s death.
“Throughout your childhood, did Narcissa ever express interest in You-Know-Who’s revival?”
Draco nodded and slid out of bed, stretching his arms above his head and arching his back. When they reached the Great Hall, they arrived at a bit of a problem. Where to sit? Draco wasn’t sure if Harry would eat with him, they hadn’t really discussed going public. And if Harry did want to eat with Draco, where would they sit? With Harry’s friends or with Draco’s? Or entirely separate from everyone else?
Murmurs had broken out among the Wizengamot and Draco’s stomach churned. He wasn’t sure what to think.
Harry waved and stepped back out into the alley, his half drunken coffee in hand.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts by Ginny “So, are Professors Granger and Potter gonna go easy on us this year?”
Did Malfoy just tell him that he was gay? Why did Harry’s heart flutter at that thought?
When they reached the common room, all of the eighth years were waiting for them. Food and drinks littered the circular room, strewn across desks, tables and sofas. Everyone stared at them expectantly and Draco froze, unsure of what to do. His eyes darted across the faces and he soon realized that it wasn’t only eighth years filling the room. He saw Ginevra Weasley there, Lovegood too, Astoria, and many others from every house.
“Really?”
“It’s fine.” Draco said, using his fingers to neaten Teddy’s hair, “This isn’t exactly disastrous. And it’s not like our little third wheel does much talking yet.”
“Thank you for being so awesome.” Harry said, leaning his face into Draco’s side so it came out muffled.
“Do you know anything that would help?”
“Sure.” Hermione said.
The rest of the week went by fast. Harry ended up dropping his athletics class and one of the history courses that he decided to take the next semester, but kept the rest. Sunday he and Hermione attended the self defense class and Harry picked it up surprisingly fast.
There it was, room seven. It was time for him to find out who his roommate was. His insides roiled in trepidation and his hand shook as he reached out for the doorknob. He swallowed hard as he pushed open the door, to find-
McGonagall went after Narcissa. She strode over to the chair Narcissa had just vacated and sat down. “You have been Mr. Malfoy’s teacher for the past eight years?” The Ministry witch prompted.
“Yeah, his mother was one too.”
“You’ve played chaser with us at practices,” Harry countered, “And think, you’re probably the only eighth year who’s in shape to play with us.”
“Again?” She cut him off.
The two headed out of the room holding hands and grinning like idiots.
Draco rubbed his chilled fingers and moved closer to the fire raging within the hearth. “Where’s Pans?” He asked the other two.
Though that didn’t mean there weren’t hard days. He usually ended up at the manor with Draco those days.
She marched over to the table where Parkinson and the other 8th year former Slytherins sat and spoke with her. Harry’s eyes wandered over to Malfoy, who was sitting next to Parkinson. He looked worried, and like he hadn’t gotten enough sleep. Though Harry knew that to be true, in truth neither of them were sleeping enough. He had decided to put up a permanent star charm on their whole ceiling, Malfoy didn’t seem to mind, though once that was up he changed the colors on Harry’s drapes to match his own.
“We should get moving, I want to drop off my blanket before breakfast.” She smiled and the two made their way back to the dorms in silence.
“For the beater tryouts, you will be playing a bit of ‘pass the bludger’ with three other people. I will only have one group at a time, because the bludgers, are essentially attempting to kill anyone in the air. The orange group is up first.”
“Don’t worry, I was planning on heading to Hogsmeade to get some Christmas shopping out of the way before the crowds came in, otherwise too many people will want to give their loved ones autographs instead of thoughtful gifts.” Harry winked.
He laid there, staring up at the blank, off-white ceiling for less than ten minutes before he was interrupted by the doorknob jangling. He sat up, his eyes trained wearily on the door. Ron never had this much trouble with it. Had he lost his key somewhere?
Draco nodded.
“It’s only been two month longer than normal ‘Mione. We both chose not to go to Camp Evergreen this year.”
“We should probably connect our calendars once we have our activities schedule set. That way we can figure out when we’ve got free time to do stuff like groceries together. Also its easier to know where we’re supposed to be when.” She paused for a minute, “There’s a self defense class on Sundays for a few weeks that we could probably sign up for. I’m going to. I don’t quite trust being the only girl on a boys floor.”
He watched as the chasers flew, shooting over and over, passing between themselves and he soon realized, he would have no difficulty finding chasers. He had no idea there was so much Quidditch talent within his year. He immediately knew that Pansy and Longbottom were not suited to the position. Both of their flying was good, the scoring part was the issue. Perhaps they could take up another position.
She leaned forward, resting her clasped hands upon her desk. “So, with your trial coming up, how are you feeling?”
“She’s just as smart as you’ve said, Harry.” Sirius smiled, “Oh! We got something for you.” He reached in the box Remus had just set down and pulled out a pink orange and white striped flag and handed it to her.
Within minutes, he was fast asleep.
“Maybe, what do you mean by something?”
Harry scoffed. “I’m confused. Are we friends or not?”
“You really were bored, you’ve done out to May. Smart move you made with the patronus lesson.” She said.
On the first day of classes, Harry woke up early for once in his life. Okay not early, but he didn’t snooze his alarm charm at all. His brain registered that Malfoy had gone down to breakfast already, but it was too early for him to care. He headed down to the great hall and sat down at the ‘Gryffindor’ table. While there officially weren’t any house tables anymore, but most students still sat at their old house table with the rest of their house. It was habit more than anything. Hermione was already halfway through her breakfast when he got there.
“What sort of things was he told to do?” Asked the ministry witch.
“They’re a charmed set. You wear one and I wear one. They read your mood and transmit it as a color to the other’s necklace.”
“Well I’m about to get quite busy with classes starting up again, but I enjoy teaching.” Remus said, he worked as a professor at the university.
“Okay I’ll go first.” Blaise said, “Pansy, truth or dare?”
“What?” Harry moved his chair closer and took Draco’s hand.
After that Harry and Hermione wandered through the campus gardens and libraries, attempting to find the good study spots. Harry also took a more detailed look around the athletic center and gym. He would run track in the spring and had regular workouts to train and keep in shape during the off season, he wasn’t there on scholarship or anything and was probably one of the slower runners on the team, but he had mostly been there for the exercise anyway.
“Okay.” She smiled weakly.
“So shall we?”
“Do I have to move?”
“Sure, yeah, I suppose I could find someone to ask.” Draco said.
“No, he never killed anyone.” It was true, Draco had never killed anyone, though Weasley and Bell had nearly died because of him.
Malfoy seriously didn’t still think that Harry could testify against him right? After they had shared a room for two months, and Harry being his teacher? Harry looked off to the table that used to be the Slytherin table, and saw Malfoy. At least he hadn’t skipped this meal. Malfoy still looked worried. Harry found himself wanting to hug Draco. Now that was a strange thought. And run his hands through Malfoy’s hair. Where did that come from?
All my love
“What I did see Draco do that night was disarm Dumbledore, a fact that helped me overtake Voldemort last May. You see, the elder wand was loyal to Dumbledore up until that time. Late last April, I ended up disarming Draco, leading to me being able to defeat Voldemort even though he had an ‘unbeatable’ wand in his possession.” That bit, Draco had known, Potter had explained that to the Dark Lord in front of everyone, and then again during Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Everything about college began to feel comfortable. Harry had more friends than he did in high school and liked his classes. He was able to see Sirius and Remus whenever he wanted and did video calls with his mom regularly.
He first tried thinking of his seventh birthday, then when he had received his Hogwarts letter, when he’d been sorted into Slytherin, when he had made it onto the Quidditch team. But nothing worked. All were tainted with bad memories now. His seventh birthday, often regarded as his best one,
We will be trying to update weekly. We will be adding two chapters (one for Draco and one for Harry) every Friday!
“You spend hours each night studying. I know, I serve you the coffee that keeps you awake. You really deserve a break sometimes.” Harry carefully measured a portion of popcorn as he talked.
So he sat himself down in the seat of the accused with his head held high. And it stayed that way, even as the chains wound themselves up and around him, even as his heart faltered. They wrapped themselves around his arms and legs, trapping him, pinning him to the chair. He knew he was shaking, but there was nothing to be done for it.
Harry laughed and bumped him right back.
Everything was all set up and ready to go when Pansy said, “Listen guys, I know we have the very strict rule of no allowing new people into this, but that’s such a high school rule. And we’re in college now… so I think we should branch out a bit and let new people join the tradition.”
Hermione seemed to be leaning towards going into healing the next year, though she did have a bunch of social-justice-like offers from the Ministry that she liked as well.
“Potter.”
Draco’s stomach roiled as one of the higher up death eaters came in. He had four aurors surrounding his and was more heavily chained. Even so, he was unfazed and had a lazy, almost bored expression on his face. Draco shrunk back a little as Dolohov came nearer, in spite of himself.
But that couldn’t be real, why would Harry be disappointed? It was more likely that Draco was projecting disappointment at his own cowardice on Harry.
Draco was extremely excited when Halloween arrived, despite the fact that with tennis and all of his class work, he hadn’t had any time to get himself a costume.
The bird flew off, leaving Draco to wait with a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“Seems is the keyword there. She’s still bitter that I wasn’t a girl. You know, she only wanted one daughter. Instead she ended up with six sons first. My younger sister was all she ever wanted, and she likes each of us less and less the further down the line you go. I bet she’s loving having Ginny as her only child now.”
Harry sat up, it was Draco Malfoy. He was supposed to be roommates with his rival. The sorting hat definitely had a cruel sense of humor.
“Please come.” Harry asked again.
I totally forgot to write the chapter this week until I woke up today so that’s fun.....
“Thank you.” Harry whispered into Draco’s shoulder.
Draco had to admit, he was exceedingly nervous for the official start of term. He had to be careful, control himself. One false step could be his downfall. He knew everyone would keep one eye locked on him, waiting for him to do something to prove he was who they thought he was; a death eater.
“I didn’t catch your name last night.”
He pulled back, “What’s wrong?” Draco asked.
“Punish the Dark Lord’s supporters who had failed him, mostly. He was ordered to kill Dumbledore too.” Dolohov drawled, quieter now, less angry.
“And a fellow death eater?”
“Sorry,” Draco muttered and leaned against the wall opposite the three of them.
“Of course.” Harry leaned over and kissed the side of Draco’s head “Was there anything else?”
“And you could do to announce your presence instead of going full boxer on someone’s door!” Draco snapped, turning his back on Pansy.
“Yeah, there are like four clocks in this hotel room.” Draco said, giving Harry a little smile.
Harry nodded and let him into the room.
Here it is!!
Harry gave him a sympathetic look and sat down beside him, snaking an arm around Draco’s waist and pulling him in close. Instinctively Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Is it the house? Or just that you’ll miss being here?”
“Once you get it you can let it wander around the room, but if you get tired banish it. I will not be responsible for anyone collapsing from depleted magical energy in this class.” Harry called out.
He knocked on the door that would lead to her office.
Before Harry knew what was happening Draco was kissing him. First tentatively, and then with passion. Then it was over and Draco had retreated to the bathroom.
Ron was standing on the dueling mat fooling around with cool dueling poses, none of which were the least bit practical.
“Miss Parkinson and Miss Abbott, you’re up first.” The two girls both seemed adept at defensive magic, Pansy needed help with her stance, and Hannah needed to work on her speed. Both were quite good nonverbally as well.
As always please leave comments and kudos! We love to see what you think!
“Of course I did.”
Hey everyone! Hope you're having a great summer thus far. Though Appie and I are writing fan fiction for JKR’s books, this does not mean we condone her recent comments or actions. The things she has said as of late are absolutely appalling and go against the things we believe in. With that said, we do still love the world and characters she created during her prime. We will not let her bigotry destroy the Harry Potter books. With that said, please enjoy!
Harry turned around.
They decided to go to St. Mungos for dinner that night. Hermone spent the afternoon pouring over the lesson plans
“You are Mr. Malfoy’s mother, correct?”
Draco paused, and slowly turned back to face his father. “Yes, I am, for the first time in a while.”
He hoped desperately to be placed with Blaise, but he knew it was impossible. McGonagall had said that no one would be placed with anyone from their same original house. Could the sorting hat have made a mistake though, and placed him with Blaise anyway? He highly doubted it, things never went his way. It just wasn’t in the cards for him to be happy.
And then, their were the Gryffindors themselves. Longbottom, Potter and Weasley. Weasley would likely relish in the opportunity to murder Draco, and Draco couldn’t stand him either. Longbottom had changed, quite a bit in these last couple of years. He was a force to be reckoned with, and if Draco was remembering correctly (everything from the battle was a blur), Longbottom had destroyed one of the Dark Lord’s Horcruxes. He didn’t know how Longbottom would act around him, how Longbottom would treat him. He didn’t think Longbottom would hex him or try to murder him, so that was something.
When it became clear that neither would give in, Draco climbed into his bed, waving his wand and plunging the room into darkness.
But he hated the dark mark that remained, faded into a scar, but there nonetheless. He had spent countless days trying to siphon off or conceal the mark to no avail. Perhaps Granger would come up with some way to remove them. Draco could only hope.
With each passing day, Draco’s father got worse and worse, angrier and angrier. “I like it here, father! I am not going back home and I am certainly not transferring!” He screamed into the phone before smashing his thumb against the red end call button.
“Draco, why didn’t you tell me?”
“Okay,” Harry paused, “Draco Malfoy, would you like to go on a date with me on Sunday night?”
Harry nodded and headed to the door, almost running into Sirius who was bringing the microwave as the college did not provide those.
“Sounds good.” Draco said with a nod as Harry turned back towards the coffee machine. Now was his chance, to ask the thing he had been wanting to since Harry had asked him to split the champagne bottle- was this a date? “Also…” He trailed off as Harry turned back around to look him in the eye. Draco knew it was just Harry being a polite and attentive conversationalist, but he still wished Harry hadn’t looked away from the brewing coffee. Those green eyes locked on his made Draco lose all of his nerve. “Never mind. It’s fine.” He finished lamely, and Harry looked a little disappointed.
He sent it in and quickly finished his breakfast. He headed back to his room, accidentally running into the cute blond guy he’d tried to help the previous day.
Potter looked so peaceful, sitting there, his knees tucked up against his chest, his cheek rested against the window pane. His lips were parted ever so slightly and his hair, untamable as ever. He looked younger in sleep, without the weight of the world resting on his shoulders. Draco understood that, he was sure he looked like that too, that is, when his dreams weren’t plagued by nightmares.
“Yes, but I am perfectly capable of getting ready on my own.”
They ended up choosing an intense and hilarious new cooking show that was framed with a sports concept.
“First floor couch.”
Harry just nodded, “You ready to go?”
Draco did his very best to avoid Harry at all costs. He had risen before Harry every morning, which was quite a feat considering that Harry had to wake up at incomprehensible, ungodly hours of the morning to patrol the corridors in search of unruly students. He would hide himself way, usually beneath the staircase that led up to their dorm rooms. He waited to enter the Great Hall until Harry had already seated himself, so as to be sure to sit as far away as physically possible. He sat on the opposite side of the room for every lesson and waited to enter their dorm for the evening, until he could be sure that Harry was asleep.
He ate quickly and in silence. Professor McGonagall sat at the head of the staff table, with the new head of Slytherin, Professor Delacroix. Someone else was there, a younger Hufflepuff, but that was all. It was better this way, Draco thought. If he kept out of everyone else’s way, he had a higher chance of surviving this year.
Pansy gathered up the group and led them to the ride area when the time came and they all climbed aboard the hay lined flatbed that was being pulled by a tractor.
Draco’s favorite season was the fall. He loved the leaves, in all of their bright reds and oranges and golds, he loved the crisp chilled air. He loved the pumpkins and corn mazes and lattes. He loved that sweaters were once again acceptable. But best of all, he loved Halloween. He loved the movies and the music and the costumes, he loved it all. Halloween had always been his favorite holiday. He had seen every single horror movie ever made… twice, if not three times through.
Now he had to hope that those writers would feel the same way when his house arrest was lifted and he was out in the Wizarding World looking for work. And he was sure that should he and Harry break up, the prophet would have a field day bashing him.
Once the two finished their duel it was Harry and Malfoy’s turn.
“How were your Christmases?” Draco asked them, more out of a need to pass the time than anything else.
“That’s great. What are you doing for your date? When is it going to be?”
Sirius answered the door, introduced himself to Draco, and offered up a tour.
He curled into his little spot in the common room and touched up his homework before heading off to his shared dorm room.
Harry was unprepared for Ron to spend the majority of dinner complaining about Hermione. He did spot Draco sitting at the old Slytherin table across the hall. Harry was seated at the Ravenclaw table, but on the far end compared to where Draco sat, so it was hard to see him much less talk to him.
Hey all! It’s Appie again, here is a chapter I actually wrote.
“Good. I’ll make sure to save you some popcorn.”
“Did Mr. Malfoy fight?”
The thoughts fled Harry’s mind as Hermione brought out the second year and escorted her to the hallway.
“No. I’m not great at reading people all the time.”
“I cannot believe you picked Granger and me to be beaters.” Pansy scoffed. “I was joking and Granger hasn’t got a clue what the rules of Quidditch are. We’ll be a mess.”
After his room number was assigned Harry went up to room seven and settled in. The new eighth year dorms were decked out in the year colors, purple and grey, but the students were allowed to change the colors if they wanted. Harry still hadn’t decided what to do for his colors. He knew for sure he wouldn’t be rooming with another Gryffindor, so his default colors of red and gold were off the table. Harry went over to his trunk and started to unpack. His clothes went into the wardrobe, and his books went to stack on his desk. Hermione insisted that if they were going to teach together Harry would have to be more organized this year.
Harry frowned, “I never wanted to get into trouble you know. It just came with the title. And giving an eleven year old absolute freedom for the first time, especially when the headmaster gives you an easy way to sneak around.”
Harry nodded.
“What’s wrong Dragon?” Harry asked him the third time he had gotten up, walked around the study table and sat back down.
“That is true, but you have to be extra careful Harry. Like super careful, lock the windows and door, don’t go out at night alone.” Harry had never heard Sirius sound this, well, serious.
“Mr. Malfoy, you are the son of Narcissa and Lucius, are you not?” The head wizard asked, his voice booming and echoing around the room.
“This is bigger than breaking a couple of school rules and you know it.” Harry fired back.
Just then, it began to rain. It didn’t come on slowly, but rather abruptly and all at once. One minute it was clear skies, the next, it was pouring harder than it had in a long while. And Draco knew they were in trouble, his team hadn’t been rained on during any practices, Ginny’s had. In fact, they’d practiced straight through a snowstorm on several occasions. They had the advantage now.
“I told you it wasn’t working out and that’s because...” Harry trailed off for a minute to take a breath, “I’m gay.”
But then he saw what Harry was looking for and he knew he needed to object, if only for the sake of his personal image. Yes, it was true, he loved horror movies. Like really, really, loved horror movies. Like, if he could only watch one genre of movie for the rest of his life, it would be horror movies- or psychological thrillers. But, his favorite movie- shockingly enough- was not a horror movie, not by a long shot. His favorite movie was Big Hero 6. But Harry couldn’t have possibly known that as he turned it on, somehow right at the beginning.
Not that Draco had much to worry about. Harry hated that he couldn’t tell him anything, but the form he had signed for each trial had been spelled so he couldn’t talk about it until after the trial.
Remember to leave comments and kudos!
“Some sweet Christmas bread to go with breakfast. Here you go dear.” She said, setting the cup of tea down in front of him.
“And yet, you’re still here.” Blaise pointed out.
“Of course,” Pansy said with a laugh. “There isn’t anything bad to tell anyway.”
“The shop isn’t even closed.” Draco muttered.
Hey everyone! Not sure if Appie updated y’all. We will be doing one chapter each week, alternating POVs. This week (obviously) is Draco’s week. I’m sorry that you won’t be getting as many chapters now, but I hope you like the content anyway!
He was shaken awake the next morning. It was Malfoy. Malfoy’s mouth was moving, but no sound was coming out of it, Harry remembered the sound barrier and took it down. Harry looked out the window and noticed it was still dark out.
Just then, the crowd erupted in a cacophony of cheers and boos. The announcer was shouting, and all Draco managed to catch was that the match was over, the snitch had been caught. But who had caught it? Draco froze in the air, hovering in line with the goal posts, listening hard for the final score. The rain was pounding around him, but between the splashing drops he heard it, “470-240.” They had done it! Harry had done it!
Draco plopped his bag in his chair then came over to where Harry was setting up the mats.
After unpacking they headed to orientation where they received course books that they had to submit some selections from to test out this week by noon the next day. They would have to finalize their class schedules by the end of the week.
“What’s going on here?” He asked.
“Really small world.” Sirius concluded.
,” He gave his wand a slight wave and out bounded a great silver hyena.
“Any luck with him?” Pansy asked sympathetically as they headed down the stairs.
“Fine.” Draco’s worry didn’t leave him, but it did ebb slightly. He let out a long calming breath and watched as the others made their patronus’s appear and move around the room before fading into air and mist.
So, Draco leaned a little further into Harry’s warmth and said, “I’m not the biggest fan of horror.” He ought to take up a career in acting, for that slight tremble to his voice sounded almost genuine.
Comments are much appreciated!
Enjoy!
“Yes.”
“Well, it happened so recently and you had today to focus on, and I didn’t know how you would react, so I just kind of left it out of my letters.”
“We should get back.” Draco said.
“The matter of his actions during sixth year, I’ll let you know that he wasn’t the only person that almost killed someone that year. If you were to convict him of attempted murder you’d do well to convict myself as well.” That was fair too, Potter had almost made him bleed out on the bathroom floor that year. “We were young and stupid, still are. He was coerced by Voldemort, his father was in prison, and Voldemort had taken up residence in his home. He hated that he was ordered to kill Dumbledore, the stress left him alone and unable to reach out for help.” More like his pride.
“Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.”
Aside from the threat at the end, which Harry figured would have gone for anyone Draco dated, (he would have made similar threats to people dating Ron and Hermione, if they hadn’t dated each other) the note seemed to imply that Pansy was helping Draco get ready for the date, and it was rather sweet of her to help her friend like that.
“I’m so sorry, I never should have involved you in any of that, you were a child, I thought I was protecting you, but really I was just making everything worse.”
After making quick work of the tables, they escaped back up to the eighth year dorms.
“Oh, well, I knew you liked the stars, but the astronomy tower was out. It’s too cold and there are too many bad memories there. I’m also a bit scared to check if the Room of Requirement still works. That left this or sneaking into the library, though Filch and Mrs. Norris guard that like hawks at night.”
P.S. Sorry this is late. I had Sectionals last night and Appie fell asleep at like 4pm. 😂
“That was when me and my friends were captured and taken to Malfoy manor. She didn’t say or do much there. She identified my friend Hermione to the others, but that was it.”
—Appie
And standing before him, seeing him looking so… beaten down as he did… Draco’s instincts took over and he wrapped him in a hug, pulling him in close and trying to offer him any semblance of comfort.
“Bye.”
Harry popped the champagne and poured it into the drinking glasses he had.
Potter entered the room, confident as always. He didn’t sit, but rather stood behind the chair, resting his forearms on the back of it.
Occasionally they passed a professor who Jennifer pointed out and said what they usually taught if she knew them.
Harry had arranged a meeting with McGonagall a week after exam results were expected to come out to discuss him returning to be a full time teacher the next year. He was excited about the prospect of becoming a teacher, even more so than he had been about becoming an auror in previous years.
Harry took the stroller as Andie walked away to where ever she was netting her friend. He reached in and cooed at Teddy, “Hey pup, you ready to spend a few hours with your Uncle Harry? I have a new friend for you too, your cousin Draco’s gonna join us.”
Harry sighed and ventured out to the club fair. Some of them looked interesting so he picked up flyers, but still had no clue how much time he’d have to spend on extracurriculars. After deciding he needed coffee before he could do anything else that morning, he went to the Rise and Grind coffee shop he and Hermione had found the previous night.
“After you left the party Ron and I had a big fight over me being on the quidditch team. He was being drunk and stupid, he thought I wasn’t good enough and that I should ‘stick to the books’ or some shit.”
Neville nodded.
Draco snatched his phone up off of the desk and sent a quick reply;
Pansy nodded her agreement. “Hey, don’t look at me. I just came here for the free alcohol.”
“And now onto the matter of you kissing my son.”
The newly minted Headmistress of Hogwarts was desperate for someone to fill the Defense Against the Dark Arts position. The other open positions had been filled in a heartbeat, but with Snape’s death, the curse on the position had, as far as the public was concerned, been confirmed as cursed. Harry had said yes in an instant when he was asked, as did Hermione. Their former Transfigurations professor had offered them pay, Harry had almost turned it down, until he saw the conflicted look on Hermione’s face. She didn’t have a Gringotts vault full of galleons like he did, yet he could tell she didn’t want the money. They had ultimately decided to get half pay and Hermione flooed right to Gringotts to set up an account.
“Do you need me to pack for you?” Harry asked, his trunk filled, and his side of the room utterly bare.
“Thanks.” She looked around and found a dish of thumbtacks on her bedside table and proceeded to hang it above her bed.
“Thank you, that will be all for now. Our next witness is Narcissa Malfoy.”
Once they were in the hall, Jess turned to Draco and said, “I think that went well.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Not even thirty seconds later Draco came into the room and collapsed onto Harry’s bed.
Harry climbed into the first carriage with his friends. It took off before the others, he and Hermione had to get there to settle in at the staff table for the night and he had a sorting hat to dust off.
He submitted his form, and then drew up a mock schedule for the rest of his week. It would be a bit tight, but once he dropped like two or three of the classes he’d be golden. He looked through some of the flyers he got from the club fair and decided that he’d join the school’s gay pride club at least, probably one of the sports clubs like indoor frisbee or something to make friends.
He also knew that he was going to testify on their behalf. They had both done things that had kept him alive, and while he wasn’t sure how much good it would do, he would at least try to let Malfoy finish off the year at Hogwarts.
“Oh.” Draco blushed and took the flowers, “These are nice.”
Pansy came to the rescue, waltzing up to them and loudly saying, “Harry, could you come check over my analysis of our last auror report? I’m not sure if I got it entirely right.”
“What’re you doing?”
“Why do you figure that?” Draco asked, trying for nonchalance and failing spectacularly.
Harry wasn’t sure where to start.
So that is why Harry hadn’t told Draco, it wasn’t because he didn’t want to, it was because he physically couldn’t. Maybe there was hope after all!
“That’d be cool, you ready to go?”
and him getting his Hogwarts letter, had both taken place in the Manor, a place he could hardly bare to enter now. Slytherin house reminded him of He Who Must Not Be Named, making him wish he’d ended up in any other house. And he had only made the Quidditch team because his father had been pulling the strings, a father that he couldn’t stand to visit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron stared at Harry for a minute, as if he was trying to see if Harry was lying. Then Harry saw the wheels turning in Ron’s head, like he was trying to piece together something.
“Thank you Mrs. Tonks.” The wizard paused, “Up next we will be hearing from Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, Order of Merlin First Class, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“So long as you don’t mind my tail.” Draco frowned, tilting his head at the auror.
“Thank you.” Sirius hung up.
He had been so distracted by happiness that he had completely forgotten about his mum’s trial. His gut churned painfully, overwrought with worry and guilt. He would have to write to his mum sometime this week or the next to check in on her, see how she was feeling. Though, he highly doubted that she would be honest with him. After all, she was his mother, and though he was of age now, she still made it her duty to protect him from everything, even the truth.
“Not really, they would’ve kept us as prisoners regardless of whether we were who they were searching for or not. Bellatrix would have likely kept us as playthings for her to torture. And Lucius recognized Ron pretty quickly.”
He was visited by Macmillan’s jeering face in his dreams. Macmillan laughed at him incessantly and then hexed him so he couldn’t move. The rest of the dream was a blur, but whatever had happened was awful and had left him in a shaky, cold sweat.
“I know,” Draco said, just as softly, the slur punctuating his statement.
Enjoy!!!!!!!!!
“He is an incredibly bright student. He always turned in all of his work on time, if not early. He was always rivaling Miss. Granger for the top spot. That is until his sixth year, in which he became distant, distracted and neglectful of his work. He frequently missed classes and looked rather sick. He skipped many of his detentions too and many other teachers saw his grades plummeting. In his seventh year, everyone’s grades were poor, so that isn’t anything to judge by. He returned to school this year to redo the previous one and once again he is back to his previous standards, rivaling Miss Hermione Granger for top spot. He has been quiet and respectful is even the Quidditch captain. He has caused me no trouble and demonstrated none of the Death Eaters’ ideals.”
“Oh, come on.” Neville said with a laugh, “Anyone could see the way you two kept looking at one another when you thought no one was watching.”
“Defense first! I’m glad we’re starting off easy.” Ron said.
“It’s not a problem, I’m sure I’ll do the same at some point throughout the year. You’ll have to throw a pillow at me when that happens, I get so wrapped up in whatever I’m doing.” Har- Potter rambled, then added, “Oh, er, congratulations on becoming the Quidditch captain by the way.”
“This is for you, on the house, I figured you’d need it since it’s so early. It’s the same order you wanted last time you were here.” Mr. Orange passed him the glass that was filled with iced coffee.
“Do you want us to come with you?” Pansy asked.
“Yes, we must.” Potter insisted.
“That’s why it tasted odd?” Harry asked as though he was experiencing some great revelation.
He hated dancing around it like this, pretending everything was fine, when it very clearly was anything but. Molly took a long time saying goodbye, though from what she had told Draco, this was far from the first time she’d said goodbye to a child.
Harry planned to spend every Sunday at the manor until Draco was free to roam. Sure he’d probably make visits in between if and when he felt like it, but having the set plan of a full day to themselves felt good. It gave him some structure.
Harry hummed in response.
“Right. A room full of eighteen-year-olds can’t be any scarier than facing a three headed dog.” She stood up, “Thanks.”
Hermione must have been tuned into Harry’s internal dialogue because she then said, “Harry, everyone else, including Ron, may be oblivious to the fact that you are not straight, but I figured it out back in fourth year, you had a crush on Krum and one on Cedric. Also it didn’t work out with Ginny and neither of you seemed bothered by it. Also, just for the record, I don’t care, you’re still you, Harry.”
“I really want to kiss you right now.”
Draco walked with Pansy back to her dorm before heading to the boy’s floor with Blaise and Neville. “So,” Blaise asked with raised brows and a smug expression, “You and Harry? Gonna be a thing?”
They had had this conversation before, several times in fact. And he had gone back and forth in his mind, having the same argument with himself. But he needed to finish his education. So here he was, walking through the barrier and onto platform nine and three quarters.
Then they asked him about Weasley, and Draco, yet again, pretended to be unsure.
TW: alcohol consumption, intoxicated characters, intoxicated kissing, poor parental relationship/conversation
They walked around Hogsmeade for about twenty minutes before Harry heard a familiar voice call his name.
Then there was that last bit. That bit that made Draco’s heart want to leap straight from his chest. Harry had asked him to go on a date! A date! As in the two of them! Together!
Draco wondered if Harry would be testifying for her as he had done for him. He was just about to ask when breakfast ended and everyone began to file out of the Great Hall and into the corridor beyond. Reluctantly Draco split off from Harry, for while he had History of Magic, Harry had to go with Hermione and teach the third years.
The Great Hall was silent. Harry smiled and started clapping. As the girl went to take her seat, the rest of the staff and the current Slytherins had joined in. By the time she was seated, the whole hall was applauding, like normal. Harry read the next name, “Anderson, Hale.”
“What if I’m a bad teacher?”
While he worked he considered telling Moony and Padfoot that he planned to ask Draco out after his last midterm. Maybe. If he could find the courage to do it. He had avoided Draco after Halloween, trying to not think about nearly breaking down in his arms. Every time he thought about he just felt awkward, like he should have just kept moving to his room.
“Fine.” He mumbled.
“How were Death Eaters still being actively fought, when the Aurors had been corrupted?”
But if he was being honest with himself, his life had always been rather difficult, despite his luxurious family estate.
She had gone there tonight to visit his father, and Draco had been meant to go along too but he hadn’t been able to manage. He couldn’t face his father, not yet. If he was being honest with himself, he blamed his father for much of what had happened in these past years. His father had been the one so eager to join up after all. And his father had been the one to fail in the hall of mysteries, pushing the Dark Lord’s wrath onto Draco.

“You wanna play a game or something?” He passed Draco a cup of something, “Truth or dare?”
Quite graciously, (and very Gryffindorly) Harry offered to grade half of Hermione’s remaining exams. Draco, though he complained throughout the entire thing, assisted Harry in completing them too. In all, it took six days for them to get it all done, leaving them with the final three for themselves.
On Monday he made good on his promise to write to Draco,
So, when Pansy arrived to drag Draco off to the party, he didn’t say a single word to Ron, who was lying in his bed, sending pictures of his forehead to some poor girl on Snapchat.
While the man made the coffee and put the sandwiches together, he made conversation with Harry and Hermione. “So are you two here for the new semester?”
“Hello?”
Sorry for the cliffhanger! Hope you liked the chapter though and stay tuned to find out what happens to Narcissa. Comment what you think the verdict will be!
Draco tapped his fingers restlessly against the glass of the display as he waited for his coffee, while also trying to summon that courage again. But Harry set his coffee on the counter with a tight smile before turning to help the next customer and Draco had missed his chance. He grabbed up the coffee and hurried out of the coffee shop, inwardly cursing himself the whole way.
“Oh. Well he’s fine I guess. I haven’t really talked to him this week.”
“Yes, I feel like I haven’t slept in a week.”
He glanced over at the pair of them and saw that Hermione was pulling Pansy up from the couch and leading her from the room. They were completely focused on one another and didn't have a single thought to spare on anything else- on anyone else.
He settled himself onto his bed and stared up at the stars charmed across their ceiling. Potter had made them stay, permanently, after having to recast them several nights in a row of ceaseless nightmares. Draco didn’t mind them, he found comfort in them.
Harry’s group went next, both Harry and Neville were knocked off their brooms within the first few minutes. Hermione did surprisingly well, considering she had never played before. Ron was also doing well, though Harry didn’t think much of that, he was one of the youngest in a huge family, deflecting blows like that seemed to be a survival instinct.
“Same as usual?” Harry asked, already writing the name on the cup.
“I was four or so. I didn’t really hear much of what was happening when it happened, but I’ve managed to piece the story together from what my uncles and the police have told me. I’ve tried to ask my mother about it, but she just shuts down part way into the story.
“Hi dad. I still miss you. I started college this year. I’m almost done with midterms too. You remember that boy who I used to play with next door? He lives in the dorm down the hall from me, we’re friends again. I think. Maybe there’s more there. I can’t tell yet. Sirius and Remus look ready for their moment alone with you. I’ll come back and talk to you next year.” He paused for a second and rested his head on the tombstone, letting his tears fall, “I love you.”
Draco scoffed. “Hasn’t shown yet. Maybe he’s speaking to the Dean right now, trying to get switched out with someone else.”
Harry survived the test on Monday with little fanfare, it wasn’t an easy test, but Harry was sure he had done well enough to pass. He went over to Sirius and Remus’s house for dinner, he had made a sort of habit of seeing them at least once a week, whether it was for dinner, or weekly grocery shopping, or whatever else they could do together.
Harry rolled over and looked up at Draco, he looked to be barely holding it together himself.
“So,” Harry said after a moment of silence. “What do you plan to do after Hogwarts?”
“I mean it’s not like we haven’t cohabitated before, and we’ve been together for nearly a year now, and I finished cleaning up the townhouse in the summer, it does get a bit lonely there sometimes, I just thought...” Harry rambled.
“And did you tell him to do it?”
A few times over the past five months, Jess had offered to bring him and his mum to see his dad in Azkaban, but while his mum had gone, Draco had always declined. Until today. Draco had finally plucked up the courage to go and visit him.
The party was small, whoever organized it had limited it to the two floors of their building. Harry and Hermione ended up spending time with a group that consisted of cute blond guy, his name was Draco, and dark haired girl named Pansy that Hermione hit it off with immediately. Around ten a guy named Blaise came up to the group with another guy, intorducing him as Neville.
“It’s fine. Well, what they did to me isn’t, but you had no reason to know better.”
Well he supposed he did, but the prospect was a bit daunting. Malfoy liked him, he had written proof.
“You like him, I know it.” Daphne said.
Harry, though technically not a prefect or a house quidditch team captain, the eighth years didn’t have a house team, was allowed to use the prefects bathroom as he was a ‘junior teacher,’ which was what the position had been officially named. He made his way down to the fifth floor, and by the time he returned to eighth year dorm seven, Malfoy was in the last stages of getting ready for bed.
“Pretty much the same. My parents were sad to let their ‘little girl’ go.”
He headed to the makeshift study, as the real one was still to eerie to get anything done in, and found Hermione staring at the lesson plans.
He sighed and scrolled through his instagram for a bit, finally making a post of a picture of him and Hermione together from earlier that day, saying he was settled in. He set an alarm for seven am the next day, planning to get in a morning run before the campus truly woke up.
He spent the next two weeks getting trained by Mr. Orange’s high school aged son, Maxwell, and Mr. Orange himself. The shifts were pretty manageable with his coursework and he was still able to find time to hang out with Hermione. They had started watching a show on her parents’ Netflix account together in the early evenings, since Harry had started working nights at the cafe.
“Only if you don’t want someone with an eight am class to find you down here.”
The ministry witch nodded and scribbled something down. “Was Mr. Malfoy ever forced to kill anyone?”
He collapsed onto his bed and dropped the coffee onto his bedside table along with the bag containing his muffin.
Harry gave her a look.
One memorable night Pansy and Hermione were headed back to campus after a date and passed the Rise and Grind just before closing, it was a Friday night so the place was open until midnight to try to catch some of the party crowds and hydrate them before everything got too wild.
Before Draco could ask what the hell that meant, the phone beeped and the line went dead. His father had hung up on him without so much as a goodbye. Draco had half a mind to call him back, he wanted to rage at him, but he was so tired and his mind was swimming from all of the alcohol in his system, so instead he left his phone on the desk, sat atop a wireless charger and laid down on his bed, not even bothering to draw back the covers.
As Harry piled his plate with food he resigned himself to the long day.
“I, er, I can’t be the team captain, everyone hates me and- what about Potter or, or Weasley?” He asked, pleadingly.
“Sure.” Hermione hopped off the desk and let the others in.
Was Harry avoiding him? Or was Draco just being paranoid? Draco wouldn’t put it past himself to be being absurdly paranoid. It wasn’t as though he hadn’t done it before.
“Harry!” Harry turned to look, letting go of Draco’s hand.
Harry went over to the bed and sat down next to her. “Hermione Jean Granger, smartest witch in her year, key person in the defeat of Voldemort, a bad Defense teacher? That thought never crossed my mind.”
Harry couldn’t even get out of bed.
“Wait.”
Harry was set to testify at nearly every trial, though he refused to do all of them. There were most certainly Death Eaters he had not encountered. He only saw Voldemort’s inner circle since he was their main target. Plenty of the dangerous ones had already been put away for long sentences if not life. Harry really only had two trials left to attend, Draco’s and Narcissa’s.
Something in his dad’s shoulders seemed to loosen, relax. “How have you been? Your mother has only told me the bare minimum. I know you went back to Hogwarts to redo your final year, but the rest, she said was up to you to tell me.”
Enjoy!
“No party this time?”
The courtroom went up into chaos.
Potter laughed, “No, I’ve got enough to do already, I’ll tryout, of course, but I am far to busy to be in charge of something else.”
“Trust me it’s bad. And the only real time I’ve spent around them is when we moved Harry in.” Hermione added.
He wondered if the dorm rooms would circular too. And would each room be its own floor?
Draco was happier than he had been in a long time, happier than ever before, if he was being honest with himself. He had been operating under a heady bliss ever since the conclusion of his mum’s trial. The feeling was so strong that he had been able to ignore all of the articles speculating about his and Harry’s relationship.
Potter wheeled around to face the auror and said silkily, “I’ve got him from here.” Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline.
The game continued. Harry dared Hermione to down a glass of the alcoholic drink of questionable contents that was being served on the other side of the room. Hermione asked Draco about his first crush, a male celebrity Harry had never heard of. Pansy returned and did her dramatic reading, Neville got dared to let Pansy write on his back in sharpie. The game got interesting when it got back to Blaise.
Don’t blame Tay too much for it being late she’s got a lot going on right now.
They all settled in and got the movie going and Draco was a little jittery with excitement. He pulled up a blanket around himself since the room was a bit chilly and began munching on his popcorn as the movie started to play.
“Thanks.” Draco said, “You’ve got glitter in your hair.” When did he get so close?
“Well, let’s just say I owe Kingsley a big favor sometime in the future. And you still have to stay within ten feet of me the whole day, and they’re tracking you.”
Okay guys, here we are; the end! I can’t believe it’s here already. Thank you so much for joining Appie and I on this journey. Before I go off on a tangent, here’s the chapter!
“I, er, Draco? What do you think?” Harry asked.
“You’re welcome.”
Draco had to physically hold back the scoff that threatened to bubble to the surface. Did Harry honestly think he was scared? Draco was about to tell him just how wrong he was when Harry slid a little closer to him, pressing right up against his side and Draco’s brain just… stopped. It was like he was short circuiting or something. It took him a moment to draw back his thoughts and then he realized something. If he could make Harry think he was genuinely scared, then maybe they could end up like Pansy and Hermione, limbs tangled together, happy in their relationship with one another. Secure in the knowledge that they cared for each other.
“Morning Pads, you usually don’t call this early.”
Quite a few stood, enough that Harry couldn’t tell whether or not they were declaring her innocent or guilty.
—Appie
Suddenly a loud buzzing sounded from Potter’s side of the room. Draco jumped violently and was immediately embarrassed. He glanced back to Potter, to see if he had awoken. But he hadn’t. Cautiously, Draco stood and walked towards the sound. Then he thought better of it and returned to his bed. But the sound was unceasing. So, Draco began to pace, his stomach a knot of anxiety, his head scattered. What was he meant to do?
“Woah. Chill.” Neville said, grinning and putting his hands up in a placating gesture. “He was looking at you the same way you were looking at him, that’s all.”
“Er, yeah, sure.” Harry said, trailing behind Pansy as she hurried back to where Blaise and Daphne were already seated. Conveniently, Draco noticed that two seats had been left open. Draco narrowed his eyes at the back of Pansy’s head and as she resumed her original place, he could almost feel the smugness drifting off of her.
