Quickly, Draco tried to smooth it out, but it was no use without a mirror, and Harry just laughed. ‘Piss off, Potter.’
They sat down behind Pansy and her friends. The stands looked out over another enclosure, looking like an arena. As they watched the stands fill up with students – all talking excitedly, laughing, joking – the first dragon was lured in. Five of the dragon tamers carried a clutch of huge granite-grey eggs between them in a blanket. They laid them in a nest, next to an equally huge golden egg.
‘Well, so far I’ve been better than you at everything,’ Nott pointed out. Draco let out an indignant yowl. ‘I’ll improve it. Watch me.’
Malfoy sniggered and leaned all the way across the desk to reach a journal. ‘Let’s see...’ Instead of getting back up, he made himself comfortable and flipped through it while lying stretched out. He inhaled sharply. ‘Ooh, picked a bad week, Potter. I have so many interesting guests… Don’t think I can drop any of them.’
Grinning, Pansy defiantly raised her chin. ‘And if you’re too chicken to ask Potter, you will have to do all my homework for a month.’
Potter had named Draco’s father as one of the Death Eaters. Other names were there too: Goyle, Crabbe, Nott… He’d outed them all.
‘Then for our next item: letters from listeners. We have received lots of reactions on the interview we did with the local Auror Department and the subsequent short special we had on him last night. Thank you all for giving us your opinion. I am glad to know you've enjoyed the show, or sad to hear you didn't, depending on the letter. I was, however…’ He trailed off and huffed. ‘No, I shouldn’t say.’
Draco had slid out from behind the door, closely followed by Crabbe and Goyle, revelling in his new position of power. ‘Afraid I’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,’ he drawled.
After yet another failed attempt to go, he fell back into a chair with a heavy sigh. ‘I want to know what happened!’
Draco screamed at the voice coming out of nowhere, then furiously pointed his wand in the direction of it. ‘Potter, I will hex you.’
Draco refused to give him the satisfaction of a response, even if he was dying to know what Snape meant.
Draco scowled, and he looked so much like Malfoy-from-Hogwarts again all of a sudden that Harry whirled around and took off in a hurry. He did mind the curb this time.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh and his mother sourly glanced at them. ‘I am glad you two can always bond over making fun of me.’
Montague wasn’t the type to play hooky, and Warrington wasn’t the type to attack a fellow Slytherin or to show his emotions at all, the way he’d done just now.
His friends looked at Professor Umbridge, taking in her fluffy, pink cardigan and the pink Alice band in her mousy brown hair.
Bellatrix snorted. ‘Oh?’ Her eyes started gleaming. ‘You know who else used to hiccup? Severus Snape. All the time. Remember that weak little flunky, Cissy?’
Crabbe and Goyle were going over their plans for the day when Draco spotted Harry Potter stalking back up the stairs. ‘Staying here, Potter?’ he shouted impulsively. ‘Scared of passing the Dementors?’
‘Anyway, during those days, we were strongly – fervently – opposed to the Statute of Secrecy, you know. For, you see, it would take away a big part of our lifestyle, of our influence. Why, it would force us to withdraw from a highly enjoyable sphere of social life!’
‘It’s only teachers who can dock points from houses, Malfoy,’ said Ernie Macmillan, the Hufflepuff prefect.
Snape had glided over to Granger and Potter’s desk. The whole class was now looking around at them. The whole class, except one: Harry stared at Draco.
Draco scowled and bit his tongue. He had at least six insults ready and that was only from the top of his head, he was sure he could think of more.
When he’d handed it in and returned to their table, Draco’s shoe slipped in a large puddle of muck. ‘Potter! Yuck, what did you do?!’
‘No, madam.' He shook his head, then changed his mind. 'Well, yes, obviously.’ He ran his hands through his hair a bit more, ignoring how awful it must look. ‘My friends, you see, and the exams… The war.’
‘Want one, Granger?’ offered Draco, holding out a badge. ‘I’ve got loads. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up.’
For a second, Draco was dumbfounded. He took in the neat handwriting, spotlessly clean fingers and silky hair, which all stood in such stark contrast to Draco’s previous Potions partner, and decided to hand the list to his friends. ‘Crabbe, get our ingredients too, will you?’ When he looked back, Nott was smirking at his parchment.
Watching the quizzical frowns on the faces of his house mates, he tried to focus on the words of her speech, but it was all gibberish to his tired mind. He drifted off, his gaze involuntarily drawn to a certain boy at the other end of the hall, who was looking equally glassy-eyed.
To make up for his blunder in front of the Slytherins, Draco increased his efforts to make fun of Harry Potter. There was no denying that it was pretty hilarious that The Boy Who Lived – Saviour of the Wizarding World, a guy who’s back looked so toned, who won every match and defeated the Dark Lord time and again – kept fainting because of a few cloaked figures. Sure, they looked scary, but not nearly enough to
‘Yes,’ said the boy. ‘Amazing, isn’t it?’ His voice sounded like he just got out of bed; slow and a little croaky.
The arms were still holding Draco when relief washed over him. ‘Not dead.’ He breathed heavily now as if to catch up for lost time, clasping the arms when black spots appeared before his eyes. ‘Years of my life…’
Harry was so heavily surrounded by Weasleys that he didn’t notice Draco in time. His head bopped forward, Draco jeered, and at once, all the gingers stepped aside, pointing their wands at Draco. None so accomplished in the art of self-defence as Harry, he easily beat them all to it. Whirling around, he made the ink of Granger’s ink pot float out, hurling it at Draco.
‘That Umbridge woman really is rather dim, isn’t she?’ Draco drawled morosely. ‘As our Headmistress she should have known that the entirety of fifth year would be witnessing her sneaky little midnight visit.’
‘Madam Pomfrey, I need something against the aftereffects of a Patronus curse, please,’ he demanded as soon as swaggered through the doors of the hospital wing and spotted Pomfrey.
And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, wide enough to keep the manor dry in a snow storm – and Harry dived, as Draco and the crowd screamed in excitement.
Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch – and only as he did, Draco saw the flash of gold, floating right next to his head. He’d been so busy following Harry’s comic act that he hadn’t even seen the Snitch when it flew next to his face. As Harry’s fingers curled around the Snitch right in front of his face, Draco could do nothing but watch.
! Maybe he doesn’t understand what he saw yet, but he will! Or that infuriating Granger will explain it! Before tomorrow, the whole school will know, and it will all be on you!’ His hands were clenched in fists of rage. ‘And the worst thing,’ he bellowed, ‘is I can’t even tell my father!’
Granger huffed indignantly, and further down the dungeon, Snape turned to raise an eyebrow at Draco, who just smirked and shrugged.
Nott’s notes were a jumble of information, seemingly copied from numerous sources, but as Draco watched, Nott drew lines to connect them with Draco’s outline for the essay. Doing that, they had a pretty decent first draft within minutes.
Draco shook the Minister’s hand, trying his best to smile. As he did, he heard his father softly talk to Mr. Weasley.  ‘Good lord, Arthur, what did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn’t have fetched this much?’
Tonight, Draco thought miserably, that was ages away. Potter would have forgotten all about him by then.
Boggart-Harry showed up again, but this time he was wearing an oversized, black cloak. An evil smirk crossed his face as his eyes locked on Draco.
Draco laughed triumphantly and swerved towards them to sing loudly along. ‘Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King! He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!’
Thankfully, Draco discovered it was easy enough to avoid him these days, since his father was humming everywhere he went. It had the same effect on Draco as tick-tocking sounds had on Captain Hook.
?’ mouthed Pansy as they followed their professor, and Draco tapped his forehead. She muffled her laughter while Umbridge spoke.
Without even looking at her, Draco ripped the wrapping paper off, and Pansy burst out into laughter as he read the title of the book she got him: ‘Magic For The Hopelessly Romantic.’
Her head shot up. ‘Oh no,  Malfoy, come on! The guy left you hanging! He might be busy, but that’s no excuse! Either you make him talk to you or you let him go. I will not support stalking him.’
Draco yanked a little too furiously at the violin strings and Pansy didn’t quite reach the high note.
There was no way he could pretend to sleep through this. Irritated, he slammed the blanket away. ‘What?! You’re the
‘It's behind the dumpster,’ he explained to Harry. ‘So on rubbish pickup day they move it for you and you can see it, but I don’t know what time they’ll be there.’
Startled, Potter sat up straight and looked over his shoulder to see if anyone was listening. His face became a marvellous shade of red and a warm glow ran up Draco’s spine and spread through his body, right up to the tips of his fingers.
Pansy shrugged elaborately. ‘Beats me. I guess they think you swing both ways, if they’re thinking at all. They reckon we’re scared to ruin our friendship.’
Pansy Parkinson was afraid of no one. Snape towering over her with his most deadly stare did not make her falter in the slightest.
Draco tailed Harry, who stretched out his hand. He couldn’t let this happen, there had to be a way –
Ron Weasley walked like a monkey: O-legs, swaying shoulders, dangling arms. He looked sluggish and dumb, Draco thought.
Father sat up straight again. ‘We have done very well for ourselves in the past, especially in the Golden Days, when the Dark Lord reigned. Wealth and pure blood have always made people jealous. That is why the right connections are important. It is the reason we surround ourselves with likeminded people.’
Draco burst out laughing. Granger turned on her heel and ran up the corridor and out of sight. Both Potter and Weasley started shouting at Snape.
Furious, Draco inched forwards, but Harry already rolled back his shoulders, glaring at the woman like he was picturing the perfect jinx for her. The only reason he didn’t murder their teacher on the spot was the Mudblood pulling him away.
The smell of the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake pricked Draco’s nose. It was the smell of an exciting new year.
Draco snatched it out of her hands to flip to the interview, scanning Potter’s words until he saw it. His own name, in one of Potter's answers.
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. A delighted Mr Weasley told the Daily Prophet, ‘We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.’ The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hog warts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend.
too. Finding joy in a life tormented by disease, truly incredible. If even you can do it, with all of those handicaps thrown at you, then we certainly should!’ Nott was looking daggers at Draco, who decided to kick it up a notch. ‘Oh! You know what, they should put us two in the Daily Prophet! Imagine the headline we’d make: “Pureblood community accepts chronically ill student with open arms.” With a picture of me, of course, for allowing you to be my friend, you see.’
Before he could decide, Draco pursed his lips and opened his mouth. With his eyes fixed on the Ministry posters on the walls, he drawled, ‘I’ve been a bit foolish.’
Fixing Harry with a disgruntled frown, Draco leaned his arms on the chair's armrest. ‘Excuse me, Auror Potter, but I’m trying to run a wireless show here. Can you save your interrogation for later?’
‘Ooh, yes, I am in agony,’ Draco moaned, adding a little theatre to the merely slight discomfort he felt. ‘Only apple pie will help, I am sure. With whipped cream and ice cream. Three scoops at least. Ooh, the pain is unbearable!’
‘Is it true you killed the monster with a sword?’ Draco wrote, messing up his handwriting in his eagerness.
Every single Slytherin had bought one from him, earning Draco twenty Knuts profit each. He’d already made over two Galleons profit – on the first day of selling them.
Draco pulled off one side of the headphones to press the other one to his ear as he focussed on the levers. ‘Yes, all day long, what do you think about that?’
This alone angered Draco to his core. If that were true, Draco thought, then Potter was a careless, arrogant boy who took everyone’s attention for granted, as if it was only natural for people to love him as much as Draco did. Who knew, he thought, maybe Potter was expecting Draco to patiently wait around until the big Gryffindor celebrity got bored again. It made Draco’s blood boil.
‘You’re going to pay,’ said Draco in a voice barely louder than a whisper. ‘I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done to my father…’
Draco exploded. All his bottled up fear came out. ‘You stupid, dim-witted, dung-brain oaf!’ he shouted. ‘I thought no Professor could ever be worse than the ones we already had! I cannot believe I was wrong!’ His voice echoed between the classroom walls. ‘Potter will tell
When the train arrived at the station, the prefects were the first to step out, avoiding the usual shuffling through the corridors. Feeling the cool sting of the night air on his face, Draco neglected his duty supervising the crowd to collect his friends and conquer a coach for themselves.
‘Draco, Draco! Did you hear?!’ Tracey was leaning over the back of one of the sofas in the common room later that afternoon, stretching her arm to try and get Draco’s attention.
They were startled by the sudden sound. Draco glanced at Nott, but saw his own question reflected back at him. None of them knew.
Draco let out an exasperated sigh and slowly made his way back to the group. Warm fingers touched his hand. The sensation shot through Draco’s spine like hot water in the shower.
‘Oh come on, Draco, it’s made perfectly clear that you two…’ Pansy’s voice trailed off and she didn’t seem intent on picking it up again. She made a show of staring at her textbook.
A hint of desperation appeared in Malfoy's eyes. ‘Tell me my mother’s lawyers cleared my name, Harry.’
‘We’ll have to, Harry, she’ll force it out of you anyway, what’s… what’s the point…?’ And Granger began to cry into the back of Bulstrode’s robes. Bulstrode stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted.
When Potter reached the Gryffindor table, he let the handle go. It hung in mid-air, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it.
He led Crabbe and Goyle back into the library, where they tried to pick up their Transfiguration homework as if nothing had happened, but all Draco could think about was what Warrington had been talking about.
‘I booked the field!’ said their Team Captain, Oliver Wood, positively spitting with rage. ‘I booked it!’
Harry’s hair had crackled again, and glancing at it, Draco noticed it looked even worse than usual. ‘Merlin, Harry, you've got caterpillar in your hair.’ Before he could stop himself, Draco leaned across the table to pick it out. Only when he was doing it, he realised he was actually touching Harry Potter’s magical hair. Flicking the caterpillar away, he quickly regrouped: ‘You disgust me.’
Potter began telling him about the dementors, and his cousin. Going as far back to tell Draco what had happened before the incident with the dementors.
In times like this Draco really questioned himself and his entire life’s existence, the fact he had healed fucking Harry Potter was on the top of his reasons to want to throw himself away.
“Mister Malfoy.” Professor McGonagall called, “Please pay attention and get your head out of the clouds this is transfiguration not divination”
“I think he was telling the truth at the end of the tournament, I mean when has Potter ever lied successfully, and also why the fuck would he murder Diggory. There’s no bad bone in Saint Potter’s body. Except maybe his intolerable face…”
The feeling inside him never left as he reflected on what Potter had told him, he wanted to protect Potter from harm, make it so he never cried a single tear in his life. He wished he could keep Potter up in this tower, with only him and the faint burning stars. Potter looked so vulnerable at that moment, far too innocent to have had faced what he did last year.
Draco held the gaze for a few moments before he narrowed his eyes at Potter who seemed to be ignoring whatever Granger was whispering into his ear.
Draco knew the situation was completely out of hand if oblivious Potter was aware of how strange this whole thing was.
His eyes roamed around the hall before spotting the bane of his existence, Potter. And if he could sense Draco’s eyes on him, Potter glanced up from his conversation with one of the terror Weasley twins and met his eyes across the hall.
Well if Draco was thinking like the clever man he believed himself as, he really didn’t think there was a spell involved which caused Draco’s head to go into complete disarray… it was probably the fact that Potter was acting weirdly. Yes, that’s it.
Potter momentarily looked shocked that Draco was really talking to him, “ I have Malfoy, I told McGonagall but she told me just stick my head down.” Potter rolled his eyes as Draco had finished healing him, pulling his hand back to the safety of his lap.
However, before he could even utter a single word, Draco stood, downing the remainders of his water before strolling out of the Great Hall without a second look back. He could feel the eyes of numerous people on his back as he reached the doors including those of Harry motherfucking Potter.
“Oh.” That did make sense now that Draco thought about it. Merlin he really needed to start irritating Potter again.
In the next few moments of silence, the three of them stared at each other. Well in actual fact both Pansy and Blaise were staring at Draco while he took turns glancing at either of them.
“When I was young Mother always used to hold me when I cried, she used to tell me that there was nothing to worry about. That I was the brightest star, and it was okay if I was dim that day and didn’t want to shine brightly. She used to whisper into my hair, that tomorrow would come and I would get another chance at shining and it would all be okay.”  He smiled softly at the thought of those times.
“Oh be quiet Draco,” Pansy replied, running her fingers through Blaise’s hair, “Maybe we will have a normal year this year.”
Bizarrely, he wanted to talk to Potter, to tell him that this was all he had for himself too. But that felt far too open for Draco. His head wasn’t that fucked, he knew that it would be so strange to indulge Harry Potter in his secrets.
A few silent seconds went past before he dared look at Potter again, Potter, however, was already looking at Draco. The sadness in his eyes was gone, he shook himself from whatever thoughts he was stuck in when he noticed Draco had turned to him.
“Why does he look confused?” Pansy questioned Draco, meeting her eyes as he turned away from Potter’s, “What did you do to him, Draco?”
Rolling his eyes at their antics and names, Draco flicked his wand at the door opening so they could take their leave.
i prenamed the chapters when i planned the story, i say planned is rly basic. BUT this one seems to fit really well and what draco is thinking at the end ties to it too mmmm genius i am
Ever since Draco was a child he craved routine, every morning when he woke up and every evening before bed he would do the exact same thing and even at Hogwarts, he followed the same routine. No one dared to ruin this routine Draco had, unsurprisingly this routine included taunting Potter at any moment possible.
Maybe jumping off the astronomy tower would be a cool way to go or perhaps he could order Crabbe or Goyle into casting the killing curse at him.
A snicker came from his left side which sat Blaise, the evil bastard just grinned at Draco like Draco had just told him the greatest news of his life.
“I could say the same Potter, it's not like I hope to find you every damn evening on my prefect round” He moved to stand in front of Potter who was now looking up at Draco, eyes flashing in the light of the stars.
so i was writing this, and i got up to the bit in the library with theo and draco and i was like why this sounds like the start of a draco and theo fic; rest assured this IS a drarry fic. well duh, the tags say so. please idk how to tell the difference between platonic and romantic relationships irl so how am i meant to do it when IM THE ONE WRITING THE BLOODY RELATIONSHIPS.
“Hey hey, Potter.” Draco raised a hand to touch Potter, hesitating as he did so, unsure of how he would react.
“Okay Draco, just let us know if you need anything. There’s no need to keep things from us.” Pansy gently spoke, obviously dropping the situation.
“Zabini. Parkinson.” He nodded at them, grabbed a slice of toast, and walked out of the Great Hall. Emphasis on the word walked, as much as they would later ridicule Draco for running. He walked at a normal pace which any normal person would’ve done, on a normal Wednesday morning.
Potter’s face turned from tan to pale in a matter of seconds, “Don’t be ridiculous Malfoy.” He hissed, “And you still haven’t told me what you’re up to, meeting up with other junior death eaters are you?”
“Potter,” He began, “I know what it’s like to feel the pressure, even if it’s not in the same way as you. I know also that it’s so fucking tiring putting up an act for the whole world to see.”
Draco was only young when he realised that nothing was ever as it seems. The light doesn’t hate the dark, the fire craves the water, love grows off of pain. Why he thought this happened, was an entirely different matter, perhaps one day he’ll understand that burning passion, the longing for something that he shouldn’t have. But all he could think of is the look in Potter’s eye earlier that night and he knew he would come to know. Eventually.
Draco stood from his perch on the ledge beside Potter and began heading back to the safety of the dorm room, he stopped as he reached the corner, and turned back to Potter who was still gazing out of the window,
Her presence was chilling, there was something in her eye that made Draco wary, he knew of her power in the Ministry was rising due to her relations to the Minister of Magic himself, there was definitely something suspicious happening there, and anyone with a grasp in the ministry immediately made Draco on edge, his father did always tell that a Malfoy’s trust should always be earnt and not gave freely.
“Yeah it is, Mother’s family has always named their children after the stars.” His lips quirked up as he looked at Potter, “I blame her for my need to be great, telling me I was the brightest star when I was younger did nothing to help.”
The expectations lying on both Draco and Potter’s shoulders were greater than ever before, Draco knew it was completely selfish to liken the two situations but he could not, not. Draco’s father was bound to start pressuring him into being the perfect pureblood heir who only listened to their father rather than take action themselves, Draco understood his role in his family and how he had to uphold the perfect image for all the purebloods to see but it was rather tiring at points when Draco was constantly punished for not beating the Mudblood Granger’s scores in class. And well for Potter he had the entire Wizarding World’s lie upon his scrawny, tanned shoulders. No matter if literally, half of the world believed that Potter was insane and a liar, he still had it upon him. Draco knew it was like to feel this pressure in a way most definitely opposite to Potter’s.
As he reached the bottom, Draco realised that he had in some way enjoyed talking to Potter. It was a different company than he was used to, the retorts were still the same and it was sort of like the old interactions Draco had had with Potter but there was this new underlining friendliness to it. Which surprisingly Draco didn’t oppose, he almost longed for another chance to talk to Potter in that way.
“There is nothing out there, dear! Who do you imagine would want to attack children like yourself?” She replied, the glint in her eye growing as the interaction progressed.
“Bloody hell woman why don’t you shout it out for the whole fucking hall to hear!” Draco replied before she could do any more damage to his ego.
Blaise and Pansy shared a look, communicating in the silent way most couples do. They did the same exact thing whenever Draco brought up Potter for even just the slightest second.
Potter cursed, “Bloody Prophet.” Sighing he continued, “Maybe but what was she meant to do, there’s not much she can do considering the amount of power Umbitch has over the school right now,”
He truly loved his friends, but Salazar he would never tell them that their ego was far too large already.
Fortunately for Draco, he made it in time, with not a single hair out of place. That level of precision really took skill, he thought as he strolled into the Great Hall for breakfast.
Just as he finished the Great Hall doors swung open as Potter, Granger, and Weasel walked through. The hall filled with whispers grew loud and the entire school was focused on the three, well specifically Potter. Weirdly Potter was still holding himself as he was at the station when Draco saw him earlier, but he did not once glance at anyone, not even his adoring crowd at the Gryffindors table and the concerned headmaster sat at the front. His eyes stayed focused on the back of the Weasel’s ghastly ginger head as they approached their table. Longbottom gave them a strained smile as the remaining students parted so they could sit.
“For starters, why was my father mysteriously busy every time I uttered the name, Dark Lord. And further, HE WAS GONE MAJORITY SUMMER... If that isn’t suspicious I don’t know what is” He concluded his rant placing his cold mask back after losing his composure a little during it, which caused a few older snakes to glance his way.
“You do realise curfew was an hour and a half ago, Potter?” Draco realised that Potter was in fact out late for someone who had detention, “What was she doing to you? Torturing you?” Draco snorted.
Potter raised his head from where it had been buried, his eyes drier than they had been but still held a shine to them.
“Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class.” She paused, “ It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient to get you through your examinations, which after all, is what school is all about.”
This leads Draco to question why on God’s green earth did he not mess with Potter earlier. Pansy and Blaise kept throwing Draco questioning glances throughout the day that he never once acknowledged purely because he didn’t have the slightest clue on what he would say, and in his head, he just didn’t have justification for his weird behaviour.
As suspected the only house that wasn’t that interested was Slytherin, as most dark families were aware of the events that occurred last year, and well as the stereotypes say those families have children in the Slytherin. That being said Pansy and Blaise were as nosy as usual and kept pestering Draco for information he didn’t have.
It shouldn’t be so hard to be mean to Potter’s terrible face and then be some degree of nice to him when they were alone. Even when he said it in his head, Draco knew how utterly ridiculous it was.
Draco rolled his eyes at the dramatics, nudging the arm from his shoulders and entering the library.
The colour bled from Potter’s face in a way Draco had never seen before, he had never been scared of the green-eyed boy until that very moment. The power of his magic was visible in the air, the crackling of his pure rage increasing the intensity of it. The usually clear green eyes were now darkened in his fit of aggravation,
Draco stood amused as Pansy hissed at a grumbling Blaise “Not helping Zabini.” Before she dragged him out the door, not until she had blown a kiss towards Draco.
mhm anyway I love theo with my entire heart, in my head he's so cute please. and more pansy, blaise, draco as I should
He walked up to Theo who was sitting by a window, gazing out onto the Forbidden Forest, the light of the sun casting shadows onto his pale features. He glanced up at the approaching footsteps of the trio.
Casting a tempus charm, Draco realised he did in fact have thirty minutes to get himself to perfection. He really did have to hurry if he didn’t want Pansy and Blaise to be even more suspicious of his behaviour. Nosy shits.
“Later.” Came Draco’s reply, his mind too busy with what he just witnessed. The remainder of the Slytherins flooded into the room, followed shortly by the Gryffindors, excluding Finnegan. Potter caught Draco’s eye for a split second before Granger pulled him into a chair beside her. Draco knew Potter didn’t understand why he hadn’t made a scathing remark when there was clearly space for Draco to do so. And well really the only excuse Draco could make in his head as to why he didn’t attempt to get under Potter’s skin was the idea that Draco could understand what Potter was feeling in that split second.
“Ahhhhh Draco, just the guy I wanted to see,” Pansy drawled being the first to compose herself, “We’ve been looking for you all evening since herbology” She smirked.
Draco’s eyes flashed in the light still beaming through the glass windows, of course, that’s what Potter thought he was doing, Potter is just as prejudiced as he remembered. Just like the rest, believing that the Slytherins were up to no good twenty-four-seven.
“Pansy, dearest Theodore.” He grumbled at his full name, “It's about time we were on a first-name basis. Since you’ve been keeping sweetest Draco company through his ever so hard times” Pansy smiled devilishly as Theo, who was looking back at her like he had never seen anything like it.
Lying in his bed in the fifth-year dormitory later that day, Draco reflected on it all. The warmth from the self-heating cover contrasted the chill radiating from the window next to his bed, the October water lapping against the glass filling the room with comfort and security but also coldness and uncertainty. It was all so normal, it felt like it should be like any other day in Draco’s routined life. So why was today so different from the rest? Once again like so many times today, he felt conflicted, confused at the way he acted. Had there always been some kind of underlining understanding between him and Potter, or was it just at that moment he felt it.
Merlin, he knew he wasn’t thinking straight recently but why on earth did he act so horrendously Gryffindor.
oh and i changed the name of story, i think it'll be more fitting now. i will be referencing the moon a lot in the story, probably far too much to be normal BUT
this is really short also i didn't know what else to include it felt right to end it with draco being sappy as fuck.
He stood, dusting the dirt and stones off his robes as he glared down on Potter's far too happy face.
“Potter.” Draco cut in, raising his silver eyes to meet astonished green for a split second before nodding and turning down the hall to get away from Potter as quickly as possible. He left behind a  speechless Harry Potter in his waking.
“Now now Draco, you’ve been gone all afternoon,” Blaise’s voice followed him, “And now we see you, you storm off.”
Dinner arrived quickly after they had left Draco to his own accord, he walked into the common room to find both of them missing. The traitors had already left for dinner, the only company Draco had was that of Crabbe and Goyle who could barely form a functioning sentence between them.
The word trial rang through Draco’s head as he tried to remember what Potter had been trialed for, oh yes. Underaged magic.
As he stood, Draco caught green eyes for half a second, before he strolled out of the hall. At the moment he had locked eyes with Potter, he saw exactly what Pansy was talking about, there was obvious bewilderment there. Gryffindor’s weren’t known for being subtle about their emotions, which is how Draco ended up with Blaise snorting about Potter’s confusion the whole way down to the common room.
“And Potter. Five points from Gryffindor for being out after curfew,” Draco called behind him as he walked around the corner to the staircase down to the dungeons.
Draco’s first class of Transfiguration dragged on, the clock hung on the far side of the wall ticked mockingly as he wished for his untimely death. He knew he was being dramatic but really he could transform a mouse into a fine china teacup with his eyes shut, so really death was the most suitable option at that point in time.
“That being said, Hobble, Gobble, Cobble enjoy your year!!!” Dumbledore concluded with a mighty clap.
“It’s so clear every time I close my eyes. It’s so-” The words cut off as tears flooded out of his eyes, and Draco pulled him into his side. Potter leaned into the warmth of Draco, his tears soaking into the cloak covering Draco's body. Draco didn’t know how to comfort someone, he had never really dealt with emotions, usually, there was someone else around who knew what to do. Pansy was an expert, she knew all the right things to say to help, but she wasn’t here. It was just Potter and him alone on the tower.
Draco turned to Pansy, raising an eyebrow at the amused look in her eyes, she raised an eyebrow, eyes flickering to the side and back multiple times. He glanced back to where she was obviously trying to make him look, and spoke into the newfound silence that fell again after Finnegan ran away, “Well that was entertaining.” Turning his gaze onto Potter, grey meeting green in the corridor for a moment before he spun away from his eyes and strolled down the hall without a second glance at Potter, Pansy, and Blaise following behind him not at all surprised at his dramatics.
Potter glanced at Draco out of his eye, the light catching the multiple shades of green hidden, “It’s a good job you’re here then, isn’t it?  he smirked.
The first time the three of them got to witness the drama first hand was walking to potions one afternoon in October, Potter and his crew were a few places ahead of Draco when Finnegan started rather loudly talking about the letters his mother had sent that morning, claiming to want to pull him out of Hogwarts due to the claims Potter had been making and sticking to this year and the fact that Dumbledore was supporting Potter in his usual weird way.
“It’s okay to cry, and not feel up to anything. Tomorrow will come and you will get another chance to face the world and your past. You’re not defined by your nightmares or your errors.”
Brilliant Draco congratulated himself, this is exactly why he was sorted into Slytherin. Pansy and Blaise would not know what hit them.
“Yes anything at all,” Blaise barely covered the smirk that was appearing over his face, “Even if you need assistance on wooing a certain dark-haired, green-eyed Gryffindor whose name is Har-” He cried in pain as Pansy’s elbow made contact with his ribs.
Draco ignored him, glancing back towards Potter catching his gaze again, a confused look written all over the tanned face. Draco raised an eyebrow at the confusion before turning back to his friends who were now staring contemplatively at Draco, Blaise opened his mouth to most likely make a ridiculous statement towards him, which would probably involve Potter like it did most times.
“I never cry.” Potter murmured into the tear-soaked fabric of Draco’s cloak, “I’ve told anyone anything about that night. It’s too hard to speak of and remember.”
Draco often found himself looking forward to the quiet nights up in the tower with only the moon witness to the weird little secret they had. Pansy and Blaise were, of course, still looking like Draco was doing something they found rather odd. But after the first week of unrelenting questions, they finally had taken the hint that Draco wasn’t letting up on the true reason for his disappearances, and that was that.
Draco kicked the wad of paper out of Harry's reach. ‘It wasn’t, but I have to be mindful of the time, you see. It is a heavy burden to be the host of a wireless show, Potter, you wouldn’t understand.’
, in the ashes of my wireless station! Who fucking cares, right?! Ding-dong, the Death Eater's gone! Put me out of my misery!
Draco glared at her, for no particular reason, so she got up, saying, ‘Alright, alright. Come on, Dacey Travies. We’ve better things to do than poking our nose in Draco’s love life.’
‘Lies,’ muttered Draco. ‘House points don’t matter anymore, and when could we get punished? We’ll be gone tomorrow.’
‘That trollop,’ Draco growled from the bottom of his heart, and he found himself storming over. Without looking at anyone, Draco pushed the potion in Potter’s hands and threw the blanket around his shoulders. ‘Drink,’ he snarled.
‘Seven hundred Galleons,’ jeered his father, ‘and it makes the newspaper! Next time I find a Knut on the street we’ll make the front page!’
‘Idiots,’ he growled at Vincent and Gregory as they watched Potter walk past in the East Wing, getting foul looks from nearly everyone. ‘If he did this on purpose, wouldn’t he be boasting about how he managed to do it? I would! As if he could have tricked Dumbledore. They’re always claiming he’s the most powerful wizard of our time, and now they all expect fourteen-year old Potter to have hoodwinked him? It’s ridiculous. They're all ridiculous, always have been.’
Potter stopped dead; so did Draco and his friends. The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
Draco would watch Harry frantically looking up new spells in the library, and practising them with Granger. Then Draco would check out the books and learn the spells himself, remembering the things he’d overheard Granger say about them.
‘DAD!’ Tripping over guy-lines and slipping on wet patches of grass, Draco’d started running before he realised.
Draco leaned back in his chair. ‘A Malfoy does not need to do anything, professor,’ he smugly quoted his father.
‘Well, you see, your friend Potter here brought along your first cousin once removed. Perhaps we should do the polite thing and introduce you two.’
‘Lots of letters!’ yelled Pansy. ‘Not what you’re looking for, I reckon. Some are… spicy, though. Oooh, mmm! Draco, come look at this!’
Malfoy tapped the ash off his cigar and his eyes followed its drop to the ground. ‘You know the way out.’
He waited impatiently until the staircase reached him, then sneaked up a few steps and casually arranged himself against the banister.
‘Ah, there he goes… That’s just perfect. Really ties the analogy together.' he sighed. 'Anyway… Tomorrow night, eight o’clock, The Boy Who Lived, live on News Treat Wireless Station.’ He’d regained his usual velvety radio-voice. ‘Now for the
Draco glared at Nott and leaned back in his chair. Behind him, Crabbe and Goyle were trying to multiply a cookie. ‘Crabbe, Goyle,’ hissed Draco, ‘go find out what Umbridge did to Weasley and Potter.’
Draco, face feeling red-hot, fired his most vicious slapping jinx her way, while the entirety of the Slytherin table roared with laughter.
‘Oh, him… He meant the Snitch.’ Draco felt like one of Taylor's Cassettes on repeat. ‘And I don't know what to say.’
Draco was peeking in each one of the boxes as if they were on public display. Harry was glad he put the recordings in a box in his bedroom. Most of these ones were empty, others were full of impractical things like photo albums or wall decorations. Harry didn't bother unpacking those anymore.
It was heavenly... and far too quiet. No one was laughing or cheering or yelling at his antics; there was no one to splash, throw in by their arms and legs or to try and drown for a laugh. The whole point of taking showers was to throw sponges and to empty gallons of shampoo on heads and threatening to hide clothes and all that, right? Where was the fun in having a swimming-pool like this if no one laughed?
‘Right…’ Potter pulled away and picked up where he left off, unbothered. ‘We could go to Filch. And then we can check all the classrooms, just to be sure.’
Harry gaped at him, and Draco slid further down into the chair, pressing his lips together in a cheeky smirk.
Draco absolutely adored dragons. When he was in his mother’s belly, Aunty Bel had painted a huge one on his wall, with metallic paint and glitters. It followed him around through the room and when he was sad or overexcited it breathed fire or winked at him.
‘And with this last piece of information, everything is in place to execute our plan.’ Draco’s father smirked.
Before anyone could spot him, Draco pulled the covers over his head. He was sound asleep, not to be disturbed.
Harry shifted a little, then suddenly lost his balance and jerked away, slamming his head into Draco’s nose.
‘Oh yeah?’ said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall.
who you are talking about,” because it sounds fun. And… er… oh, and, and “I assure you I – I…”’ Pansy chewed on her lip, thinking hard. ‘”I would not shed a
to believe the rumours. It did sound farfetched, Draco admitted – so he went in search of proof. Karkaroff had left the castle on the day before the final task, so Draco made up an excuse to meet with Snape.
One of the most obnoxious people in their year - a Gryffindor with a bossy voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth - was Hermione Granger. Pansy'd found out she was a Mudblood. All of them agreed it was terribly embarrassing, and Draco reckoned someone with a bloodline like that would keep her head down... but not Hermione Granger.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s –”
‘It’s not smitten,’ he snapped at Vincent and Gregory, who weren’t even paying attention. ‘Just… embarrassment.’
On Draco’s right, Potter was a red and gold blur lying flat on his broom, inching closer, until he and Draco were neck and neck…
Vincent and Gregory had lifted him back on his feet, and before Draco could stop them, they had spotted the sweets and were stuffing several pieces of it into their mouths. At once, Vincent began to itch like a madman, while his tongue seemed to be stuck to the roof of his mouth, while Gregory started jumping from one foot onto the other like he was standing on hot coals. ‘Ouch, ouch, ouch!’ he squeaked, with a voice sounding like he inhaled helium.
It was Diggory, wearing the same ridiculous bubble on his head as Fleur Delacour had been wearing. As he lifted Cho Chang out of the water, she started gasping and coughing and came to from unconsciousness.
‘It really isn’t that hot,’ said Harry apologetically. He pushed the cup a bit further away to keep himself from shocking the townspeople even more by gulping another cup of boiling liquids down his lead pipe. ‘Anyway, I’m really on duty, so do you have any leads for me on this supposed suspicious activity?’ Feeling quite hopeless, he played with the little stirring stick in the cup and accidentally broke it. ‘You know, I’m starting to think there is nothing going on around here at all. I’ve been here for days and nothing even remotely suspicious ever happens. I have no idea what I’m doing in this town. Except, apparently, getting my heart broken…’
Remembering their attic filled with magical heirlooms, Draco ran up the stairs, through the corridor, up another set of stairs and through yet another corridor. There he could climb the spiral staircase through the East Tower that lead to the attic of the manor.
Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she snored.
Regretting his words immediately, Draco closed his mouth and looked away. In the darkness outside he could only see streetlights and the vague outlines of pine trees against the night sky.
‘You almost gave him a heart attack!’ Draco snarled, slapping Crabbe on the shoulder. He whirled around to Pansy and the other prefects while pointing at Nott. ‘He tried to burn down our common room!’
As often as he’d bumped into Potter before, so difficult was it to find him now. Draco was certain the boy was avoiding him; there was no way he just happened to be somewhere else than Draco every minute of every day, especially when he’d been nearby almost every minute of every day a week earlier.
He took the book to his parents’ potions cabinet, but scanning the ingredients, his heart sank. There was stuff on the list he’d never even heard of before – and even if his parents had them, the potion still also required "a part of the other individual’s body”, like a nail clipping or a hair.
The cut didn’t seem to be deep, as Potter zoomed around the back of the Horntail, who wasn’t eager to take off, she was too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them.
‘Shut up, you weak little wanker. I’m going home on the day of the Yule Ball; I bullied Primrose into coming over from France to fetch me. And
She was right, he knew she was; it would all be alright. He could ponder about winning or losing, but in the end there was no way to control the outcome anyway. His teammates were counting on him; the entire house of Slytherin was counting on him. Harry Potter be damned, he should at least give it his best shot.
Snape ignored Granger’s hand. ‘Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?’
‘Look!’ she yelled while turning the pages and pressing them into Draco’s face until he snorted and pushed her away. It was a clear sign of how happy he was that he didn’t hex her.
He looked down at the clutch of eggs and Draco followed his gaze, spotting the golden egg gleaming against its cement-coloured fellows, residing between the dragon’s front legs.
Before Draco could stop him, he had seized the pendant and ran off with it. Draco was too shook to respond.
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Draco felt his hair fly back. His nerves left him in the thrill of the flight. This was and always had been his favourite pastime. He started looking around for the Snitch right away, but only found Harry Potter beaming at him, looking excited. Draco felt himself smiling back before he could prevent it.
He felt sick. His hands were clutching the arm rests of the chair as he swallowed away the panic that was rising like bile in his throat.
‘Then he did something like this, look at me –’ Draco was standing to re-enact the Bulgarians’ fifth goal, when he heard a hoarse, low voice coming from the compartment next to them.
Immediately, Father lashed out. ‘No! I will not hear the name of that blood-traitor anymore! Not now, not ever, not at this house, do you hear me? Especially not at the breakfast table!’
The snake clock on the wall hissed once. Draco shut his books and got up to drag himself to the Astronomy Tower. He’d gotten a lot better at sneaking around since first year and arrived unnoticed by anyone. He was fifteen minutes early, but he wanted to use all the time he could get from Potter. The guy had some serious explaining to do, Draco reminded himself. They really needed to talk this time; there should not be any snogging or undressing before they had talked. Draco scratched the lightning bolt wound on his wrist a bit more to keep his mind on track. No snogging.
Draco scowled at him. ‘Yes, well, that’s beside the point, isn’t it? Because, you see, Malfoys have standards.’
Slowly, Pansy’s entire face lit up and she started laughing louder than he ever heard her laugh before. Nimbostratus took off. ‘Darling, please, I beg you, no,’ she said as soon as she calmed down enough to breath. ‘Oh, you idiot. I was talking about The Boy Who Lived, my dear, whom you have been ardently pining for since you first laid eyes on him.’
‘Among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the employment of werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid and delusional ex-Auror, “Mad-Eye” Moody.’
Spitting anything out to his banshee of a friend did not come naturally to Draco, let alone spitting out the incredible hurt he felt. He didn’t want to spit out his petty worries at all, to nobody.
He breathed into his lungs – and he felt like he inhaled a handful of smouldering ashes. The smoke burnt his throat and his windpipe, rendering him gasping for oxygen, and, for a moment, Draco made peace with his untimely demise. Choking on calming herbs; he considered it a fitting way to go.
‘Right…’ Snape stretched the word as if he was pondering something. ‘Sit down for a moment, Mister Malfoy.’
‘Do you hear that, boys?’ He leered at Crabbe and Goyle, guffawing behind him. ‘The Mudblood thinks we owe him.’ He lifted and dropped his hands in mock reverence. ‘Oh, thank you, great Jason of the Taylor-tribe.’
Draco grumbled in agreement. They’d been staring at the Great Lake, smooth as glass, with nothing to entertain them in sight. This show simply wasn’t for him, so he went back to the castle to do his homework, only to take it back to the stands and continue spending the entire hour fixated on the surface of the Great Lake, mindlessly tearing up a piece of parchment.  Pansy, Vincent and Gregory were sharing food, cracking jokes, making bets and chatting about the contenders and their chances, but Draco hardly heard them. He couldn’t stop imagining Harry deep, deep down in that lake, abandoned by everyone, gasping for breath and choking on dark, icy water…
As he’d suspected, Potter remained at the doorway of Snape’s dungeon. He would never openly talk to him, Draco knew by now. Either because Draco embarrassed him or because Harry had a dozen other girl- and boyfriends he couldn’t risk exposing Draco to.
All through the evening, Harry forced himself and his friends not to think about Draco Malfoy. It was the normal thing to do, not thinking about him. Harry’d spent a good decade doing exactly that and should be able to continue that way.
with me.’ Draco tried to leave the subject, but the words kept coming. ‘Honestly, I don’t understand what he expected. I was bleeding on the ground from his assault. My blood was literally on his filthy hands. What did he think? That I’d jump in his arms to elope on the spot?’
The next morning, when the owls arrived, his parents sent him their reply. To his disappointment, they did not agree with him. Apparently, dragons were illegal. Hagrid risked huge repercussions to keep a dragon.
While Draco read the instructions, Potter shoved his stool as close to him as physically possible. He glanced around at the class and back at Draco, and whispered, ‘I dare you to kiss me.’
So Draco seized one of the boy’s hands, placed it around his waist and held the other in his own, trying very hard not to think about how close he was to Harry Potter – or about the fact that he was dancing with a
‘I can’t watch this,’ he mumbled, shifting nervously in his seat. He pressed his fingers into his cheeks so hard they probably left markings.
The worst thing about Weasley’s assault wasn’t even the black eye; it was the fact that they’d missed out on Harry’s spectacular catch. Since then, after every single Gryffindor match Pansy would say: ‘Not as good as that catch he did in first year against Hufflepuff.’
They sniggered as they made their way into the forest, following their world-weary Gryffindor counterparts for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground.
Draco tried not to laugh when Tracey and Daphne told him. They were crying and in a state, so he promised them everything would turn out alright and visited the hospital wing at once. Personally, he loved the antlers. They looked incredible and made Pansy look badass, like a mythological godess. He told her this, but she only cried louder and Madam Pomfrey kicked him out.
Grinning, Pansy put her thumbs up and Draco smugly swept an invisible speck of dust from his shoulder.
The boy scratched his head while sucking at the wound on his finger, allowing everyone to catch a glance of his forehead. A white scar stood out, bright as day, against his skin. It was shaped like a lightning bolt, just as the books described. There were tiny lines meandering from it, just like a real lightning bolt had. It looked amazing – and… painful. Draco wondered how much it had hurt when he got it and if it still hurt now.
Potter shot up, bent the frame of his glasses back into shape and ruffled through his hair to shake out most of the grass, leaves and twigs. He granted Draco a half-smile. ‘Course I am.’
Most of their Sunday was spent revising for their Potions exam on Monday and their Care of Magical Creatures exam on Tuesday, which both went well enough. Draco’d never doubted his performance at Potions, and he couldn’t be bothered about Care of Magical Creatures at all, but thought he passed it anyway.
‘What’s doing it?’ Patil demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree. ‘What’s eating it?’
Pansy sighed. ‘But it feels weird to think about kissing you. I would prefer not to. Maybe I’m broken.’
Draco frowned, but quickly pulled a straight face when he saw Blaise Zabini looking over the group at him. ‘You knew about this?’
‘Babe, Potter’s fine,’ Pansy assured him while Crabbe and Goyle pressed Draco firmly back in the chair. ‘You’re having a panic attack, silly boy. Breathe.’
Draco looked up to see a lot of his house mates watching him. Theatrically clearing his throat, he repeated the first part to them, and followed up with the rest of the article:
Apart from the gasps of the other students, it was awfully quiet. Nobody talked, nobody shouted or screamed.
The good news was that Gryffindor lost. The bad news was that Draco had jumped up and screamed when Harry Potter fell off his broomstick as Dementors had flooded the field –
‘Gather roun’, gather roun’,’ Hagrid encouraged. ‘Now, they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ the meat, but I’m goin’ ter give ‘em a call anyway, ‘cause they’ll like ter know it’s me.’ He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird.
‘Ron, stop, he’s just messing.’ Harry stepped between them, protecting Draco, who immediately took advantage of it to make rude gestures at the Monkey-Weasley.
‘That’s because it’s colourless,’ Draco drawled. Losing his patience, he stepped aside with a flourish. ‘You know what? Please, carry on, be my guest! Then we’ll have your body as proof for the next dunce who doesn’t believe their prefect – Oh, come on, don’t back down now! Davies, you seemed so sure! Don’t wanna try?! Your gene pool could use a bit of Garrotting Gas!’
‘I am proud to have suffered,’ said Bellatrix, her head held high while her sister brushed her hair. ‘I will gladly do it again. I never doubted for a moment that the Dark Lord would come back to save us all.’
to mention Potter’s parents, so he braced himself when Harry’s eyes almost shot fire. ‘Oh of course, and you can do nothing to stop them of course. Powerless against mummy and daddy.’
‘He’ll be sorted into Slytherin, you know,’ Draco said, while students craned to see how the Sorting Hat dropped over Potter’s eyes. ‘There’s no point in sorting him anywhere else really.’
As Zabini dived again, Draco tensed up. ‘Oi, where’s Nottingham?’ he asked over the girls’ screams and Zabini’s booming laughter.
Draco tuned out when realization hit him. He bet it wasn’t a coincidence that all this happened right after Draco’s last exam. The operation had been his father's plan. He must have considered the option of failure and hadn’t wanted to ruin Draco’s marks, his future.
Potter and Weasley were still missing when the students arrived at the castle. They weren’t present at the Sorting Ceremony, nor at the feast.
The train was going slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.
Draco was stumbling about like a drunk bumblebee. He bumped into Harry’s shoulder while rummaging haphazardly through the heap of papers on the table, making Harry’s whiskey slosh over the edge of the mug, so Harry sipped faster.
Draco Malfoy, who had banished Harry from his studio in a wild rage only minutes ago, was slouching a few feet away from Harry’s doorstep.
They all sat down, took out their books, quills and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He looked as shabby as ever.
Draco doubted that he existed in Harry’s memory as long as he wasn’t physically in his primary field of vision at real-time. Potter’d screwed him over on the Quidditch field. Would one do that to someone one liked?
Feet from the ground, Draco lifted his hand from his broom, stretching towards the Snitch… To his left, Potter’s arm extended too, was reaching. The back of Potter’s hand was swollen, fiery red, with deep cuts running across it –
Somehow, everything went downhill from that moment on. All of a sudden, Dumbledore got back, as if being suspended meant nothing anymore. Rumour had it that the other eleven governors did not voluntarily suspend the Headmaster in the first place. They all turned on Draco’s father, saying he threatened and blackmailed them.
‘And... why was this Muggle person riding it?’ Draco added smartly, and he looked so proud it made Harry chuckle.
Draco hadn’t meant to shout, the name just flew out as soon as he’d spotted the Head Boy, who had been talking to a first year in the Entrance Hall.
‘I know this and I do not care,’ Draco drawled. The judges, the Champions, the sounds of the crowd, they were all one big blur somewhere in the back of his consciousness, pressed to the back by his fear for Harry.
“In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall from power – thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend – but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.”
He decided to write to Nott and Zabini with an invitation to Yaxley’s lesson. It was rather short-notice, with the lesson being that same night, but he gathered it would add to the exclusivity. He already talked to them about his tutor, letting them in on the “secret” using the same lines he’d fed Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy. The club basically sold itself now though, since Umbridge had banned any practice for their exams on school grounds. Zabini and Nott accepted eagerly and without hesitation. If Draco wasn’t mistaken, Nott even seemed slightly impressed, or maybe he only saw what he wanted to see.
With every burn the older students suffered, Draco got increasingly more nervous. They hadn’t been taught any of the magic the other Champions performed yet. How could Potter ever survive? He would be grilled in an instant, and there was no way the professors could prevent something that happened in an instant.
Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy was talking animatedly with Hermione in the living room, as if there was nothing out of the ordinary about that. Truly, Draco-from-the-Wireless-Show was worlds different from Hogwarts-Malfoy on every front.
‘What’s going on?’ he inquired loudly, but nobody answered, so he had to elbow his way to the front of the crowd.
He threw a loose lamp through the ghost from one of the many piles of rubbish lying around, but they were both laughing.
He decided to get dressed. If his parents got back for him, he reckoned he’d better be prepared to leave.
That was the last straw. Raising his hands in the air, Draco flopped back in his seat and gave up. ‘You are so dumb.’
He wished Madam Pomfrey was here, so he could ask her if it was possible to die from a broken heart, and if there was a cure for it. He’d sell the manor for a single drop of potion if it meant he could stop hurting, longing for arms, smiles or for stupid things that used to make him laugh.
‘Four people a dorm; form groups and pick a bed. No fighting or I will decide for you. You have ten minutes.’
‘Lucius, dear, what about the Trace?’ Draco’s mother softly asked his father, now that their friends were out of earshot.
Draco was sniggering when he heard a voice next to his ear. Nott was leaning over to him. ‘Maybe his family’s poor because they saved up all their money to buy his place in the team.’
‘What are you doing?’ asked Potter, quite loudly and still with that weirdly high voice. He edged closer, fervently rocking his knee now.
‘Draco, dear, I still have some of my old Healing books here,’ Madam Pomfrey cut into his thoughts, ‘the ones we used during our training. Would you like to read them?’
‘– was cut short. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to schedule another interview with Mr Potter, but I’m sure
Snape shot him an exhausted look. ‘Just… head my words, Mister Malfoy. Consider the option before wearing it.’
After ages of non-stop ringing the bell and shouting, Harry went to the kitchen window to knock loudly. ‘I just want to talk to you! Please, open up! Or do you want me to shout it through the whole damn town? Cause I will! DRACO!’ Harry tried to look inside, through the window and the closed curtains behind it. ‘Give me a chance to explain! I
Stirring awake, Harry shook his head and turned back to bite into his toast. ‘It’s fine. I’m eating anyway.’
After a while of sulky silence, Draco got bored. There was nothing to be scared of in here. The woods were just trees, and the trees were just wood. Hagrid had said not to wander off the tracks. Draco wondered why.
‘NO!’ shouted Granger in a cracked voice from behind Bulstrode. ‘No — Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her!’
‘I told you, madam, happy,’ he snarled in disgust. ‘Restless. Everything seems hilarious to me. I can’t focus for even a second, madam, and I keep bloody smiling.’
, Draco,’ he told him, adding in a sneer, ‘Wasn’t your father supposed to be the Dark Lord’s second?’
Inside the office were Professor Snape and Harry Potter, facing each other with Snape’s desk between them. On top of the desk was a stone basin filled with silvery lights.
Draco, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott followed him through the castle. Zabini nudged Draco in the right direction two or three times and after a while, he found himself sitting in between Crabbe and Goyle on his bed, while Nott and Zabini sat on Crabbe’s bed, facing them.
Barney heaved a sigh, winked at Draco, and floated out of the room. ‘Superior orders! What can one do…’
As the wizards marched past, a hand grabbed his shoulder. ‘What did we tell you!’ his father boomed.
From then on, Potter was marking Draco so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn’t going to let Draco anywhere near the Snitch.
‘You are so important, Mr Potter,’ said Miss Daisy. ‘Lots of people care about you, you should know that. Your life matters.’
As Draco rattled off his goodbyes, Harry moved to the bed, stretching out with a moan and a long sigh.
There was a second loud BANG and immediately a wild feeling of curtailment boiled under Draco’s skin. Panicking, he noticed his body shrinking quickly. Within seconds, he was on all fours, on the tiles of the entrance hall, looking at the points of people’s shoes. Terrified ,he tried to look at himself, but the only thing he saw was fur. FUR!
‘You didn’t see how he looked at me that night of the World Cup… I suppose in his circle abusing Muggles is frowned-upon.’
A loud splash echoed across the lake. Harry had flung himself forwards into the water and disappeared.  Draco fell down on the steps of the stands. ‘Oh Merlin – he’s in…’
spotted, would you?’ He nodded at Granger, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.
Draco tucked his hands under his armpits. In an effort to regain a bit of dignity, he decided to simply keep quiet.
When he got a surprising lack of retort to that, he whirled around to show his baffled nemesis a theatrical wink, and with his hands in his pocket he made his way to the Slytherin Common Room, whistling a tune of the Weird Sister’s latest album and feeling very proud for a change. Somehow, he’d managed to get The Boy Who Lived hooked on his search! Now, he could just lay back and wait.
Draco snorted, and Harry smiled. He smiled and smiled and smiled, and the silliest little sprinkle of hope started to grow in Draco’s chest. No one had ever smiled at Draco like that… and he didn’t remember Harry ever smiling like that at anyone else – right? Did he smile like that at Cho Chang? Did people smile like that at their enemies?
For a moment, Draco froze, stuck between Vincent and Gregory, staring at the monster. Then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it was trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings. An intense cold swept over them. The cold went deeper than Draco’s skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart…
Abashed, Draco put the wand back, as a faint heat crept up his neck. ‘No, sir. Just thought you’d like to know, sir.’
Granger’s and Potter’s faces didn’t show any sign of distress as they read the article. In fact, Granger giggled when she was done reading, and she threw the magazine on the empty chair beside her. She gave Pansy a sarcastic smile and a wave, before starting on their Wit-Sharpening Potion.
‘He punched me,’ Draco snarled over the roar of the Gryffindors as the three Slytherins hurried down the steps of the stands. His eye throbbed.
It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon’s Potions class that Draco saw Harry again. The boy stopped Draco on his way out. ‘Can we talk?’
‘“The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch,” said Weasley.’
Worrying his lip, Draco blamed Potter. Or actually, he blamed Weasley for leaving that note in that book. No, Draco realised, of course it was Hagrid’s fault. He was the one who got that dragon in the first place. Hagrid was an irresponsible adult.
‘He’s going to get Potter, Professor!’ Pansy blabbed with a panicky voice, while still holding onto Draco’s sleeve to pull him back.
Then his eye fell on Potter, standing quite forlorn in the middle of the clearing. While Granger hugged him, The Boy Who Lived gazed at Draco.
‘All done,’ the nurse said after the footsteps of the students outside had faded away. ‘You’ll be okay, deary. It’s healing well and it’s certainly not infected.’
When he looked up, the Gryffindors were marching onto the field. Potter followed at Weasley’s shoulder with the familiar intimidating gaze in place. Pansy once said he looked like that because he was as blind as a bat, but Draco wasn’t so sure. A blind bat could never find a Snitch, he’d expect.
Draco bit back a nasty retort. ‘I do, sir,’ he stiffly replied. His face felt hotter every second, but Snape went diligently to work regardless of any malicious mirth.  At first, Draco wondered why Snape seemed so eager to help, but he soon realised Snape simply enjoyed making the potion. At a certain point, Draco would not have been surprised if his professor had started to hum or whistle.
The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle, then – crack! – became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before – crack! – becoming a single, bloody eye ball.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. He wondered if it was a coincidence. Could his father talking about Potter’s godfather as part of the Dark Lord’s plan, and Potter shouting “He has Padfoot” be completely unrelated to each other?
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
‘What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him,’ said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Potter’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most. Draco silently begged her to ask him for suggestions.
Draco’s eyes darted over to Harry’s neck and he spotted his own necklace. It made him huff. ‘Glad to know at least one of us is sleeping well…’
Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Theo gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Blaise eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
It was an uncomfortable sort of evening. Everyone was trying to do a bit of last-minute revising, but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Draco went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. He remembered his careers consultation. Even though he kept reminding himself that he didn’t
Even though Draco walked up to them in full sight, Harry didn’t notice him coming. His eyes were glued at his book.
Meanwhile, Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Potter managing to stay on that bucking broomstick. It had looked darn impressive.
Hagrid’s probation wasn’t a big topic of conversation those next few days, as it was overshadowed by the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumours were flying that a few of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done.
Draco told himself he didn’t care. He was not going to get distracted by any Gryffindors anymore. He was tired and did not skip sleeping to watch whatever charade their dim-witted, half-bred gamekeeper had going on. Draco wanted all the O.W.L.’s. He would hear what happened later.
Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t. All he knew was that when he opened his eyes again, nothing had changed – except for the looming figure of their Head of House, towering over the couch. It startled Draco so that he bolted upright.
Reading the chapter again, he gasped: Sirius Black betrayed Potter’s parents! He was the one who told the Dark Lord where to find them.
His father was watching him with folded hands and an amused look, bordering mocking. ‘What made you change your mind, Dragon-child?’
At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet.
‘No, you buffoon, my father says he accidentally set it free. Something to do with Potter, he says.’ Draco frowned. ‘It involved a filthy sock – Potter is disgusting… They keep saying Slytherins are foul, but the Wizarding World’s brave Gryffindor Wonderboy is at least as cunning.’
She was laughing now too, albeit watery. Their friends had been standing around them, but seemed to relax. Shaking their heads and rolling their eyes, they went back to their practice.
His idiotic friends laughed, but Draco saw the fire behind his ex-homeboy’s battered glasses. Draco had clearly touched a nerve, and wanted to relish in it. ‘Tell me, Potter, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley?’
‘I want to know how he did it,’ said Draco. ‘Pansy says it has to do with the Riddle of his Existence.’
‘McGonagall loves to make a little late night stroll,’ said Nott, drawing a dotted line along the corridor outside McGonagall’s room. ‘Through here… and to… here.’ He drew a careful last dotted line in front of Professor Sprout’s room.
Draco was sitting on the edge of his bed in just his briefs, enchanting his skin to glow as preparation for the Yule Ball that evening. The tip of his tongue stuck out in concentration, when Pansy burst into the room.
Pomfrey huffed. ‘You’ll be alright. Spend time with your friends, distract yourself. It will pass when you don’t give it any attention. It’s a proven remedy.’
Painting the nails of her other hand, Pansy tried very hard not to smirk. ‘Alright, fine… I don’t think he knows. If he knows, he is even more of an arse than I thought.’
Father was looking like he was handing Draco the keys to his own palace instead of imposing more schoolwork on Draco during his sparse free time. It wasn’t even a question.
Only the old Parkinsons seemed troubled. ‘Shouldn’t we check on those Muggles?’ said Mr. Parkinson. ‘If the Ministry finds out –’
As if Draco didn’t know that. It wasn’t Harry he was less than fond of, it was those sodding teachers.
‘Everyone here?’ barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. ‘Let’s crack on then. Who can tell me what these things are called?’ She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her.
‘It might only be another prize on the wall to him,’ said Draco, ‘but every Hero of The Day gets a chance to win a private dinner with the News Treat Wireless Station’s host of their choosing. Brilliant, isn't it? I just came up with it last night.’
Almost as quickly as it came up, the aching faded. Madam Pomfrey’s hands wiped his face dry. ‘Brave boy. The worst is over. Here, drink this.’
As he turned away, a white hot feeling of frustration surged through Draco – and before he could think, he had fired a jinx at The Boy Who Abandoned Draco Malfoy To Be With A Bleeding Weasley.
every time. Oh, he’s painfully perfect to look at, Harry Potter, in both face and form. And so very polite. Not a word of complaint about my lack of proper food, my lack of milk. I don’t think he even noticed I ran out of tea. He just took whatever I gave him. With his boots and his lashes and his penchant for maybe chewing a little more loudly than some might prefer.’
It was indeed a beautiful day for a jog. So, going back home to change into his joggers and a t-shirt, Harry made his way to the park for a jog around the pond (and back to the entrance to stretch his auror muscles).
Pansy shrieked with laughter and waved her hand dismissively. ‘Yeah, so you’re a little self-destructive – who cares?’
By Thursday, Draco was fed up. He’d been in the hospital wing for over a week. He’d read all there was to read. He’d done his homework for the next three months
Harry gloomily listened, lying on his back on his couch in his desolate, shabby condo above Little Rico’s Pizza. It was a form of self-harm to keep listening to the show, Hermione might have said if she knew. Still, he couldn't stop himself.
The spikes on its tail were larger than Draco was. The dragon had its back turned towards him and was lying perfectly still. It was probably fast asleep.
For a second he lay still, groaning in pain, with the heavy cloak smothering him. The sounds of Flint’s angry roars and Madam Hooch’s whistle resounded painfully through his head. When the air underneath the cloak became difficult to breath, he tried to remove it, but it seemed he and Goyle were tangled up in it, and their struggles to break free only worsened the knot they’d made.
‘Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,’ retorted Draco. ‘I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.’
While Madam Pomfrey wrapped up his arm again, the bell rang and Crabbe and Goyle left. Crabbe never returned. He said later that he didn’t like the hospital wing; he was scared they would keep him there, for whatever reason.
A soft whimper escaped Pansy. She put her head on his shoulder and this time Draco didn’t stop her when she took his hand.
Draco tried not to smirk. “Superior orders” was a code word between the two of them, meaning Draco should look the ghost up later in the attic.
‘Sirius wasn’t a criminal. Anyway, you were on the family tapestry, that's how I know. He pointed you out to me.’
The full weight of the Boy Who Lived yanked Draco down. Clinging to Harry’s wrist for dear life, Draco got thrown off his Nimbus when Harry plunged towards the ground – only at the last second, Draco wrapped his leg around the broom, his heart pounding in his throat.
to me, he begged him in silence, flicking another pufferfish eye in their direction. Both Potter and Weasley flinched, but didn’t react.
Harry’s eyes were wide. ‘Yes!’ he hissed back. ‘I did exactly as Draco told me to: I went there yesterday, on a Wednesday morning, like he said. I watched for ages and nothing happened!’
She looked up at him with a wistful smile. ‘You have grown so quickly… Back then your father could hold you in one hand. I used to swaddle you into his old Slytherin scarf.’ She smiled again, watching Draco’s hands with faraway eyes. ‘So he'd be with you.’
For a split second, Draco thought it was another leprechaun formation like they saw during the Quidditch game. Then he realized that it formed a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.
Draco couldn’t breathe from laughing. He felt Harry’s heartbeat racing in his ring and rolled over to see him.
After a few minutes, a whistle blew and Ludo Bagman’s voice sounded through the enclosure, telling the crowd about the dragons and the task the champions had to carry out: steal the golden egg from the dragon’s nest.
‘I contribute!’ Harry scoffed. ‘I’m trying to get rid of the suspicious activity here. It’s Brookley’s citizens who don’t contribute to me!’
A low rumble sounded from the dragon’s body. Draco felt his eyes grow to the size of saucers as he froze in fright. The gigantic tail of the Hungarian Horntail dragged gouge marks in the ground big enough for Draco to fall into.
‘Draco, you embarrass us,’ snapped his father, who was still standing around restlessly. ‘At the very least use a napkin. Were you raised by Muggles?’
Not wanting to hear her words couldn’t deny the fact that Draco knew they were true. He told himself he was okay with it, that he had known this was going to happen when he started writing with Harry Potter, and that he had been totally prepared to be dropped like a stone. Sometimes he even fooled himself well enough to put his many emotions in check for a while.
She let him go and he hid his face in his hands, peeking through his fingers to stare at Harry’s words.
‘He said he can’t feel his legs,’ said Pansy quietly. She seemed a lot less gleeful now than she'd seemed at the marble staircase. ‘Will he be alright?’
‘Darling,’ Pansy hissed over Draco’s shoulder, ‘better stretch your legs somewhere private for a bit.’
It made both Draco and his mother laugh, as it was one of the few things Draco and Bella did not have in common: a love for music. Bellatrix claimed to detest music, and Draco couldn’t wrap his head around that. Ever since she’d said it, he'd been determined to change her mind. She simply hadn’t heard the
Draco’s eyes snapped away from Taylor to glower at their team captain, who was elbowing towards them.
The best lesson was when they focused their attention on Unforgivable Curses. In fourth year, Professor Moody had taught them something about them, but it was nothing compared to the things they learned from Mr. Yaxley.
, on the clarinet, and then he would try something French to please his mother, Father always said she had a weakness for French. Perhaps
‘No can do, darling!’ her father cheerily called. ‘It is the best kept secret in the Ministry. Only Dumbledore knows.’
‘Silence! SILENCE!’ Snape roared. ‘Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft – when I find out who did this – ’
‘She’s crazy,’ said Pansy gleefully on their way back to the common room. ‘This undermines the entire prefect system.’
Scowling, Draco did as he was told. With a heavy thud he put the book on a table and lifted it open. While Draco got a coughing fit from the dust, Barney launched into a laughing fit.
‘Dra!’ scoffed Draco. No one had ever shortened his name before. If anything, they lengthened it, to add some weight. Dra! ‘How dare you? For you I’m Mister Malfoy.’
We start the chapter with Draco joining the Inquisitorial Squad. Graham Montague goes missing and turns up in a tight spot. Someone else who turns up is Draco's favourite aunt, free from the dementors in Azkaban. As the O.W.L. exams draw near, the Hogwarts students have to think about their future careers, and people go slightly insane under the pressure of studying. Not as insane, though, as their Professor Umbridge, after Harry and his army use her fireplace and manage to escape, leaving the Inquisitorial Squad in shambles after a heated duel. That night ends with a party for the Slytherins, but the chapter ends with the news that Draco's father was sent to Azkaban.
Draco burst out laughing. ‘Oh, Merlin! Are you joking?’ He looked past his tall friend to shout, ‘Pansy, get this!’ and at once, a wand was pointed at his face.
His mother, holding his hand. His father, pacing around the bed, circling her and Draco like a shark. He was muttering under his breath, ‘It is simply a matter of time, my heartbeat. Rest assured, I will personally make sure –’
‘Of course I have,’ Draco sneered. ‘But it’s horribly last season. I want the comet 290. It’s the best on the market right now. Not counting the Nimbusses of course, or the Firebolts.’
Both Draco and Harry were laughing now – and with the loudest crack the Boggart exploded, bursting into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke.
‘Pretty awkward,’ agreed Barney. He looked at Draco like he expected him to say more and Draco shrugged.
The first night was a long one. He didn’t dare lie on his arm, afraid he would make it worse if he moved in his sleep, so he slept terribly lightly and kept waking up at every move he made. When he did sleep, his dreams were filled with steely talons, cold hippogriff eyes and blood splattering on grass.
As he slammed the compartment door close behind him – hearing another round of Exploding Snap hitting the floor – he kept one hand firmly around Nott’s weedy arm as the boy kept trying to shake him off. ‘Keep
Zabini’s dark eyes were fixated on Nott. His stare reminded Draco of Nimbostratus on a hunt, and the moment Nott opened his mouth, several things happened at once.
The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look grey. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head.
Harry decided to try it out by recording all the things he had heard Malfoy say so far. Because between the lines – those many, meandering lines – Malfoy
‘You’re so bloody full of yourself!’ screamed Malfoy, practically spitting fire at this point. ‘You want to know more?! I don't even give a fuck! Just
There was a commotion outside and the other Slytherins entered, each gripping one of Potter’s confederates: Monkey Weasley, Weasley Girl, Loony, and Longbottom, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had been gagged and all of them were struggling to free themselves. All of them, except for Loony, who stood limply by Pansy’s side, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings. Pansy had her arm loosely around the girl’s waist; it looked less restricting, per se, and more… protective.
Unfortunately, Harry still couldn’t figure out how to listen back to what Malfoy had said before “I fear for Harry,” even after reading the booklet back to back twice. He was afraid that information was forever lost.
Draco-from-the-wireless-show was a very flattering man. He made Harry feel good. A starker contrast with the Malfoy-from-Hogwarts Harry knew and hated could not have been possible.
She was painting her nails in one of the secluded alcoves along the common room window. 'Who knows what?'
‘Didn’t feel the need,’ Pansy repeated incredulously, ‘to defend yourself when they were beating the living dung out of you? Two against one?’
Draco’s head shot in the direction of the voice. It had come from Mad-Eye Moody. ‘No,’ Draco mumbled, trying to free himself from the arms. ‘Not him.’
Gingerly, he glanced to his left, catching a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. Settling himself at the empty seat besides Vincent, was Viktor Krum.
After ages and ages, wrinkles appeared on the surface of the lake. Someone broke through it and Draco jumped up –
‘Ah, Professor Snape,’ said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up. ‘Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.’
It had been a week since Draco had last met Harry in private. A full week. When he watched him cross the courtyard, green eyes fixated on that rotten golden egg, Draco hurt in places he didn’t know the name of.
With Harry, he had absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. Potter had no dance skills whatsoever, yet enough self-confidence for the both of them. Draco absorbed the music and allowed his body to do what it felt like, and when he glanced at Harry, he too seemed to be letting it all go. It wasn’t exactly dancing what he was doing – shaking his head and waving his arms and jumping around – but he seemed to be having as much fun as Draco. Within minutes, they were laughing and screaming and Harry looked happier than Draco’d seen him in a long time.
“As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not – as he has always pretended – a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.
‘Oh Draco, dear, me and your daddy just had a lovely fire call,’ Umbridge simpered, as soon as he swaggered into her office. ‘There appears to be a little misunderstanding. Of course, I do not expect
Some Gryffindor leaned over to borrow Harry’s brass scales. ‘Hey, Harry,’ he said, ‘have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning – they reckon Sirius Black’s been sighted.’
'We don’t have to be friends,' said Taylor. 'Just don’t try to kill me or anything, I know Krav Maga.’
‘The only solution,’ Hagrid was telling the class when Draco and Harry joined their friends again, ‘is to take them for a short walk.’
Listening closely, Draco could hear him making furious humming noises in protest. He tried not to, but smirked with malicious glee.
His father lay a hand on Draco’s head, his mother kissed his cheek. They looked proud. His father had boasted about Draco starting Hogwarts to all their friends; how he would follow in his father’s footsteps, that he would get the highest grades of his year without even trying, that he’d surely be chosen to be prefect and then head boy and achieve O.W.L’s in every class. Draco couldn’t wait to start this new chapter of his life. Pansy’s sister had made Hogwarts sound incredible, and so had
‘A bad idea, Professor Lockhart ,’ said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. ‘How about Malfoy and Potter?’
Weasley tried to stop Harry from coming towards Draco, but The Boy Who Lived was an unstoppable force and got closer anyway. Draco swaggered over to meet him in the middle.
‘How long have I lived here now? Hm? How long have I appeared on this wireless show? Reporting tirelessly on all the goings-on in this town! Who stood by you when Bernie, the town’s mascot, died of old age? Who was here the day that lone bush near the creek caught flame in the long Dreary Drought? Well? What did Auror Potter ever do for you? Why, apart, maybe, from dying for all of us – or perhaps sacrificing a year of his life and education to get rid of the Dark Lord… And even if he did sort out the Ministry almost single-handedly so our system of government is a lot less vulnerable to a coup – Aside from all of that – What did Harry Potter ever do for you?’
They hung in the air with only Draco’s leg and his hand to keep them from falling into the depth. In a fearful, high pitched voice that Draco hardly recognized, he heared himself sprinkle the Quidditch field with every foul word he knew.
The assistant forcefully put the robes over his head. Draco was fuming. ‘My mother will hear about this! She would not appreciate me walking around with second-rate clothing.’
A smile stretched Umbridge’s wide, slack mouth. ‘Indeed, clever girl, indeed. The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students, it seems, was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim is to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age.’
For as long as Draco remembered, his dad had a stale, greyish tattoo on his forearm. It had been hardly noticeable. Aunty Bel had the same one, and so had Vincent and Gregory’s fathers. It was a matching tattoo they had gotten when they were young; that was at least what they had told their children. Everyone who had a tattoo like that was part of their friend group, a sort of secret club.
In a great rush Potter dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too, at last. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch – all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.
Draco lost the ability to form words. His hands fluttered over Harry’s body as if they couldn’t choose the best place to land, but when Harry pressed their foreheads together and Draco felt the warmth of Harry’s breath on his cheeks, Draco’s muscles relaxed. His hands rested on Harry’s chest, and he closed his eyes, feeling like he could finally breathe again.
It is a shame the Tournament Committee did not consider me for the event organisation; I had no control over it whatsoever. Things could have worked out a lot better if they had just asked my advice. You know how much experience us Malfoys have in these matters.
Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to look up at Hagrid. ‘Well, Hagrid,’ she spoke once more in that loud, slow voice, ‘I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with. You will receive,’ she mimed taking something from the air in front of her, ‘the results of your inspection,’ she pointed at the clipboard, ‘in ten days’ time.’ She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile wide beneath her green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving Draco and Pansy in fits of laughter.
‘Maybe she had other plans,’ Pansy said, and they all had a hearty laugh about that. They couldn’t think of anything a Mudblood might be busy with, not even as a joke.
That night the halls of the castle were dimly lit by the half-moon present in the sky, the faint noise of the rustling trees fed into the stone walls as Draco walked around on the same route he took every night for his prefect duty. He had already witnessed a fourth-year Ravenclaw and Slytherin couple making out in the alcove behind the painting on the west wing of the second floor and was hoping to find no more horny teenagers roaming the castle. Draco desperately needed his sleep.
Draco did what any wise person would’ve done in that situation, he ran. Running is always the best option when you want to get out of a situation you know you can’t charm yourself out of.
Draco scuffed the end of his black pointed-polished on the steps of the astronomy tower, climbing up was not worth his time when there was literally one person up there all week, he doubted anyone would dare be up in the cold tower during October.
“Well, when you come up with what you think the reason I'm doing this is, is. Let me know so I can laugh hysterically at what I know will be a stupid idea.” He chuckled at what things Potter could come up with.
The words, ‘I must not tell lies’ were engraved into the back of Potter's calloused hand, the letters shining with something which was so clearly blood. Potter’s blood. Draco felt sick, is this what Umbridge was doing to children. Draco did not dare to look at Potter in fear of his emotions being on display.
His friends knew he was trying to divert their attention away from the situation at hand, they weren’t his best friends for seven years for nothing.
“Well for starters my prefect duty  needs to be taken very seriously, Father would not be amused if I was slacking at my role.” Good start, Draco thought, nice idea of throwing his terrifying father in there. “And further, my studying is more important than frolicking around in the common room and winding up Potter in the corridors. Father would curse me if I achieve lower grades than the Mudblood.”
Oh, and to top things off, the combination of Draco’s past weird behaviour and NOW Potter’s erratic ways, meant Pansy and Blaise to be highly suspicious.
“I know, it’s like I have nothing for myself. I mean all I have is these weird-ass meetings with you, literally the person who I’ve hated for the past five years.” Potter, glanced at the sky, the light reflecting in his eyes like a million little stars were held captive in them.
“As Blaise so kindly said, what is up with you today?” Pansy continued, “You have not messed with Potter once today, you even had the perfect opportunity earlier outside potions when that god-awful Gryffindor went at him.”
Draco shot her a look. ‘Ah right, the way I like to bully my future husband, you mean? It means you need to try harder, you dumb sissy.’
In the soft morning glow of the Hospital Wing, Harry's flush looked almost pink. He was chewing his bottom lip.
Scowling, he crossed his arms, watching Nott roll up his sleeves to stir. He was doing everything exactly like Draco would have done it, and it was insufferable.
‘Of course I can,’ said Draco, ‘but I don’t want to. I will find out, you know, one way or another.’
So Harry chewed on his toast and shrugged once more. ‘I just think you’re being negative about the tulips.’
Potter's Firebolt hurtled around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopped dead in mid-air beside Potter, waiting for him to mount. Relief washed over Draco as Harry swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. Draco made a great deal of noise; as did the rest of the crowd, seeing Harry exactly where he belonged, safely in the sky. He looked entirely confident.
The Slytherins continued to chant in victory as the Gryffindors trailed back into the changing rooms.
There was a shop in Hogsmeade that sold sheet music. Draco wanted to buy as much as possible there, since it had proven difficult to simply guess the notes of some songs.
A large hand grabbed Draco’s arm and he got yanked aside as a jet of fire shot from the dragon’s nostrils. He barely escaped, feeling the heat graze his skin.
They were having Snape over for dinner and Draco was forced to attend at least three courses. He’d rather have sent one of the house-elves up with a bit of soup or noodles and called it a day. He certainly didn’t feel like dressing up in uncomfortable dress robes to entertain adults. Especially not adults who happened to also be teachers who knew exactly what had happened between Draco and a certain celebrity.
Draco laughed scathingly and tapped the skin where Nott’s peevish mouth had been. The boy slapped him away so furiously his feathery, brown hair fell into his eyes. It only made Draco laugh more. ‘Ooh, such peace and quiet… Lovely.’ He settled back down between his friends, gesturing lazily. ‘Alright, turn him back now.’
Judging from Crabbe and Goyle’s faces, Draco would not have been surprised to find out Moody got beaten to death the next morning. He hoped so.
! I have my own reasons to hate him! I was angry with him even before the war started, not just after, like everyone else. I know him better than anyone else, and I hate him for
Draco straightened his back, scowling. He couldn’t believe Potter’s nerve, still using that nickname after all this time, as if he’d done absolutely nothing wrong.
Harry flung his arms over his eyes. Shame, frustration and disappointment battled inside him on top of the constant confusion he'd been feeling the past days.
Harry leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down – next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball. Draco’s gasp mingled with the screams of people watching as Harry Potter stretched out his hand – and a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight. He toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
Old Mildred Worple had a brother, Eldred Worple, whom Draco used to have a slight obsession with back in the day. He didn’t think anyone could blame him, though: Eldred was the coolest, nicest and most magnetizing man Draco had ever known. Whenever Draco’s parents invited the Worple siblings, or whenever Eldred visited his sister’s Magical Skills and Abilities lesson, he would tell amazing stories about vampires, and Draco had simply been all over him.
It was Harry’s sleepy voice that snapped Draco back into the reality of what was going on. His father – his cool, calm, collected father – was rolling on the floor… with a bleeding Weasley of all people.
Draco rolled his eyes at Crabbe and Goyle, and decided to ignore him, if only for his own well-being.
.’ Harry nodded angrily at Draco’s arm. ‘Why are you trying to get Hagrid sacked? Buckbeak didn’t harm anyone before you came along. You shouldn’t have insulted him. If you didn’t talk every minute of every day, you would have heard Hagrid tell us you shouldn’t insult them.’
There was no way Dumbledore could keep him safe when he was down there, Draco thought. They couldn’t even see him. They didn’t know what was going on down there at all.
Pansy plopped down on the bed, laughing, but Draco did not allow her to ruin the best part of the song with her sodding
Draco shot him a look, but Potter seemed frank. As if he actually, genuinely wanted to help. The guy was an utter mystery to Draco, and, if he was being honest with himself, it fascinated him deeply.
Following Navigator Nott, they reached their destination without any further trouble, and as soon as the door closed behind them, they started cheering and screaming.
Smirking, Draco bent over the map. It took him a while to figure out where their common room was and how many ways there were to get up to the next floor – and then he cursed, because Filch’s office was directly opposite the only stairs they could use.
Potter ruffled through his hair, still nervously moving in his seat. ‘I got angry,’ he grumbled, ever so softly. ‘Why am I your Boggart, Malfoy?’
Draco felt absolutely miserable. Before noon people would be walking past the Hospital Wing to look at him, whispering and pointing. They would be waiting for him to leave, so they could taunt him at best, or beat him to death at worst…
‘You mean like… this?’ said Harry, stepping back, and he started to headbang like he was in a metal band; his hair magically grew a few inches to help.
Draco desperately straightened his back and tried to act cool. It was very difficult with his heart racing out of his chest and his hands trembling.
And so Harry and Draco crawled under their table, surrounded by muck, to give their fellow students a head-start at leaving the dungeons. It took a long time, but that didn’t matter, as it gave them a nice opportunity to release a bit of the built-up tension.
Straightening his back, Draco put on his smuggest face. ‘Well, let’s say I gave the baby a free flying lesson. And the woman –’ He couldn’t help but laugh at the memory and had trouble screwing up his face into a frown. ‘The woman had terrible manners! Right, Vinciento? She kept burping!’
Malfoy’s face snapped towards him, wearing such a derisive look, Harry almost winced. ‘You think I, personally, want to know anything about you, Potter?’
‘Aunty Bell cannot wait to meet you, Draconius,’ she said as she opened the gate to the manor’s driveway. ‘She is still recovering from... the circumstances, so you should be easy on her. Do not remark badly on her looks–’
Draco didn’t answer. He knew his silence would only fuel Pansy’s curiosity, but he couldn’t come up with any excuse. His mind was filled to the brim with Harry; wonderful, stinking Harry. It made him nauseous and sweaty, and he hated being sweaty.
Draco had not thought this through; Potter clearly expected a reason for Draco’s shouting. Thinking fast, he motioned at the first year. ‘Why are you harassing the poor kid?’
‘Zabini's a drag,’ said Draco. ‘The only thing going for him is his height and his bone structure. I’ve never heard him say anything exciting.’
He hadn’t seen anyone around, and through the dark he still couldn’t make out who the voice belonged to.
‘There he is!’ Draco slapped Crabbe and Goyle on the arms as Potter crossed the lawn towards the entrance hall with a posse of listeners at his feet. ‘Come on.’
Draco bit back a smirk. He kept trying to come up with names for the owls that Agatha would struggle to pronounce, but her mind worked in mysterious ways: she took hours to finish a word like “brown,” yet “Agamemnon” presented no problem.
‘All students to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers return to the staff room. Immediately, please.’
Father leaned back in his chair, scrutinizing him for a moment before gesturing at the chair in front of him. ‘Sit down, Draco. Let me ring for tea.’
‘A professor?’ Bellatrix leered at Draco. ‘Well, Draco, I can tell you some funny things about your favourite professors. Do you want to hear them?’
With a mortifying crash, his entire being seemed to miss a stair step as soon as he realized what he was about to say.
An E was always 5, Draco reasoned while absentmindedly kissing Harry, but the T could mean 2 or 4 or 100… He ran the three different options in his mind. The first one meant a zeppelin would crash, which was oddly specific. The second one pointed to a tall, dark stranger, which was not specific enough. But the third…
Draco scowled, but when Hagrid looked the other way, Harry pulled up his sleeve to show Draco a messy wound on his wrist.
His mind kept going back to Potter’s fixated gaze, the sounds he'd made and the way the snake obeyed at once. It intimidated the living daylight out of him.
‘Really? How presumptuous.’ Harry grinned. ‘If you keep your mouth shut, you might even make it to the first course.’
Barney let out a barking laugh. ‘Just remember, son: pornography sets unrealistic expectations. You should always use a good lu–’
Suddenly, right in the middle of their conversation, people started to scream way worse than before. Someone pointed at the forest behind the group, and whirling around, they saw something vast, green and glittering erupting. It flew up over the tree tops and into the sky.
Stanley grabbed a cup by throwing it in the air and catching it. ‘I reckon so, mate. Sorry. Draco kept leaving the mic on, and well… most of us don’t have anything to do other than listen to the soapstory he turned us all into. It’s quite entertaining. My boy, Keith, was listening to your interview with his ear practically glued to the wireless, I couldn’t get him to bed with a stick.’
Other times, the prefects had to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels. Draco loved to catch students, chide them and send them off to their Head of House. He tried to take points from them too, but Filch bitterly told him that wasn’t allowed. They could only report the kids and hope for the best.
She abandoned the Christmas tree to sit behind her piano. The one in the parlour was hers; she’d taken it with her from her parents’ home; it was the one she learned how to play on from her grandfather when she was little.
Meanwhile, Pansy had picked up her cat and slammed open the compartment door. ‘I’m telling the girls!’
‘Let’s go,’ Draco snarled as he shouldered through the clique. A hush fell over them and Draco could almost feel his friends exchanging glances.
When Malfoy's careless eyes finally drifted forwards and upwards, he froze. In a move blurry with speed, he pulled the spoon out of his mouth, spilling even more coffee and quick-stepping away from the mess. ‘Fuck. Potter.’
Crabbe, Goyle and Draco had just gotten permission from Snape to go to Hogsmeade and buy something for their mothers. They were walking into the entrance hall, just as Potter descended the last step of the marble staircase.
Harry wanted to inch closer, but Malfoy's glare made him keep his distance. ‘Yes, Potter, I’m sure. Why ask me if you don’t trust my answer anyway?’
She flipped through the book to show him the right chapter. ‘If you want to listen to Muggle music, we have a collection at the Audiovisual Corner.’
‘Let’s see,’ Snape said, in his silkiest voice. ‘Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of detentions.’
‘Good.’ Snape narrowed his eyes. ‘I like to remind you that you are also welcome to talk to Madame Pomfrey about anything.’
Pansy pulled back her hand like he’d said something filthy. ‘Really, Draco, why?’ she snarled. ‘He hexed you senseless.’
After a confused moment, Father’s eyes lit up. ‘Oh! Well? What is it? Tell me at once, do we have news? Anything from the war effort?’
‘You’re a loony,’ she said fondly. ‘Why do you always want to look like vampires? Does Potter even like vampires?’
‘Tell that to Moaning Myrtle,’ Draco mumbled, as a thick blanket and a bottle of Pepper-up Potion were pressed into his hands.
Fleur Delacour bent down to Harry and as Draco watched, she kissed him, twice, on each cheek – and Harry’s face burnt as if
The class followed her, but Harry kept looking back over his shoulder at Hagrid’s cabin. His growing anger was almost tangible. ‘What’s wrong with Hagrid?’ he pressed on, hurrying to catch up with their professor.
In a quick glance, he saw it was about Potter and Granger. Startled, he looked away. ‘I don’t want to know.’
Girls were screeching in his ears, sobbing hysterically. The frightened crowd was gasping, screaming and shouting.
‘The Weasleys are all on the Quidditch team,’ Draco said loudly, stretching the truth slightly in his advantage. ‘I’m sure Slytherin could beat them easily if I were on the Quidditch team too! They are acting as if I’m a second-year student like any other – like that Weasley-scum! They lump me together with the trash, dad!’
Five minutes later, Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor Binn’s desk.
‘It’s all right, Draco,’ said Snape, lowering his wand. ‘Potter is here for a little remedial Potions.’
Sniggering, no less than Harry Potter fell sloppily on top of him. ‘Hey Dra,’ he whispered, planting his knees in Draco’s sides as he kissed Draco’s nose and mouth and hands until he had Draco gasping for breath.
‘Riddikulus!’ Potter shouted too, and the Boggart tripped over the cloak, falling face forward on the floor.
‘One of Potter’s friends tipped me off that Potter will be meeting his illegal society tonight at a room on the seventh floor,’ she told them, with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice. ‘That isn't allowed. We need to catch them red-handed. Now, my informant couldn’t say exactly where this room is, so I want you to spread out over the floor.’
After a sigh, Harry made his way to the windowsill. ‘Sounds like someone’s little medicine is wearing off.’ He picked up the wet joint, pointed his wand for a quick drying spell and lit it up. ‘There you go, sweetie.’
Draco huffed. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and hooked his chin on the tangling, black hair. Then he grabbed the excuse of Potter neither knowing the book nor the song Wuthering Heights to start singing, supposedly to himself, supposedly out of boredom.
Gregory nodded at Potter and Draco pushed him with both hands, as if that had any effect. ‘Don’t look, idiot! What do you mean, “What did I do that for?” He was bleeding!’
‘PARTY!’ roared Miles Bletchley, and – somewhere at the back of the crowd – Pansy too. ‘Teach us the song, Draconius!’ she bellowed.
Draco frowned at his own question. Pansy wasn’t his girlfriend. She was his girl friend. Two words. And she’d gone to bed, he’d watched her leave. Get it together, he told himself.
Draco blinked in the dark and could vaguely spot the see-through outline of his Uncle Barney. He groaned, pulling his pillow over his head. ‘
It lasted over a minute; she took breaths in between. Crabbe wailed, pressing his fingers in his ear, but being quite used to it, Draco stepped closer to see what the fuss was about.
The few seconds he’d been shirtless in the cold hospital wing were enough to make Draco shiver. If only his own hands were as warm as Potter’s… In a split second, Draco decided – it couldn’t hurt; Harry Potter was too dumb to think anything of it anyway.
His immediate reaction was that the prefect bathroom was even better than the master bathroom in the manor. The bathroom was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool’s edges, each with a differently coloured jewel set into its handle. There was even a diving board.
Malfoy had been closing the door, but when he spotted Harry watching, he left it ajar, tipping his head in curiosity.
‘Hush, dear.’ She pattered towards him. ‘After effects? Silly boy, a Patronus doesn’t leave after effects.’
Draco and Gregory sat down on either side of her. Vincent leaned against the wall behind them and kept eyeing their surroundings as if there was some imminent threat. His mother always said he had anxiety issues, which Vincent didn’t like to discuss.
‘It’s technically impossible. Whatever.’ Harry inched still closer. From up close, Draco’s shirt had tiny birds on them, faintly yellow against the white cotton. ‘What is this town keeping from me? What is everyone afraid of?’ Harry inspected Malfoy's pointy face for hints at what he was hiding. ‘Are you being threatened?’
The second Pansy reluctantly turned away from Nimbostratus and her gang of Slytherin girls, Draco fired a new spell he learned, at Vincent who was sitting with Gregory on the couch, eating leftover chicken they took with them from dinner. At once Vincent’s legs stuck together. Draco did the same thing with Gregory.
‘Was afraid he’d say that,’ came a voice from the other end of the dorm. Potter’d just sauntered in. ‘Do you think I enjoy solving other people’s problems, Malfoy?’
‘I don’t know what Flint wanted to accomplish, but he’s been letting you slack off for way too long.’
‘I know,’ said Lupin. ‘Boggarts have a knack for knowing exactly where it hurts and exploiting it to the fullest. Do you want something before we go again? Water? Chocolate?’
Being part of the Inquisitorial Squad turned out to be more of a chore than anything else. It was all fun and games to freely punish people, but all the other stuff that came with it just brought him down. It got infinitely worse when the Weasley twins decided to leave Hogwarts with a literal bang and blew up a bucketload of fireworks while inviting the entire student body to follow their example and wreak havoc. The school obliged and Draco and his friends were forced to clean up after them. As if Draco wasn’t wildly overqualified to be an unpaid janitor.
A tall, thin, and gangling boy, with freckles, a long nose, and big hands and feet sat across from Draco’s new friend. He had flaming red hair.
Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either of the Weasley children. ‘We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizards, Malfoy,’ he said.
‘You’re – ’ Draco shook his head and bit his tongue. He’d almost uttered a compliment, at Harry sodding Potter. Quickly, he straightened his back. ‘Who’d have guessed? Now, what’s the plan, Stan?’
‘Go on, then, Weasley,’ said Draco quietly, drawing out his own wand. ‘Moody’s not here to look after you now – do it, if you’ve got the guts.’
Draco’s insides jolted and a hotness spread from his chest all through his body. He did not know where to look. The feeling was hard to shake.
Banshee Pansy took a breath, and together with Draco they continued in a deafening cry: ‘EVERYWHERE WE GO-O!’
They reached the prefect bathroom, and as they changed back into their swimwear, Draco pondered Nott’s predicament.
him – like I would ever – and my parents can’t even say his name.’ Scowling, Draco crossed his arms. He felt miserable.
‘I can’t give you a passing grade if you don’t do the assignment,’ said Lupin. ‘Especially if you can’t give me a solid reason.’
Professor Sprout cleared her throat looking at them. Apparently, everyone was listening to her except Draco and his friends.
One of the marchers below flipped the Muggle woman upside down with his wand; her night dress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee. Draco cried from laughing: that was the ugliest underwear he had ever seen.
Draco took off the lid of the Slush Crup to gulp down the last bit, then threw the cup down the stairwell. ‘For the house-elves.’
Draco couldn’t remember a time he didn’t know the two boys. Him, Vincent, Gregory and Pansy grew up like brothers and sisters. Even before stepping on the train, Draco already had friends. It felt like an advantage on everyone else.
Harry doubled over from laughing, then he grabbed Draco’s arm to get his attention and started doing the weirdest dance with his hands and arms, pointing to the sky and to the sides, with his other hand on his hip. He looked so dumb, Draco wanted to kiss him.
After Draco’d practiced his scales, as well as a composition by his great aunt Tiffany Malfoy III, he reckoned he’d practiced long enough to convince his dad he forgot Barney. He sauntered out of the library, then ran upstairs to the attic as fast as he could.
‘Perhaps your mother and I,’ Father drawled, ‘will enjoy our next fifteen minutes of peace and quiet so much, we might – ah – hesitate to come back.’
She’d always been unsupportive of Draco’s aesthetic. For instance, every summer she would try to convince him to get out of the shade, to get some vitamin D or – oh horror – “grab a tan”. It was infuriating how adamant she was on cramping his style.
Draco traced the lines of his hands, wishing half and half he was still at the uncomplicated Goyle household.
Pansy crossed her fingers. As Harry stepped forward, whispers broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
He heard footsteps – running footsteps, and lots of them. Maybe his parents were assessing the situation. They would come back in a second to take Draco somewhere safer.
‘Look… Malfoy,’ Nott whispered as they stalked back to the prefect’s bathroom. ‘It’s not – like… I’m not an easy target or, I don’t know, inferior, or anything, but just… well, can you try not to slip this information to the Dark Lord? Knowledge is power, my mum says…’
When they got back to his bedroom, a white owl sat on his windowsill. Draco caught his breath. ‘That’s Potter’s owl! Where’s Ulysses?’
He grabbed his wand, knowing full well it wouldn’t get him anywhere. Instead, he breathed in and out and put on a smile. ‘Miss Parkinson… lovely, clever girl… my best friend in the whole wide world, you know I would die for you without hesitation. So, hey, bestie, please, just for me, shine your eternal light on the whispers I’ve been hearing about a certain person who
Frustration rose in Harry’s bones and he advanced at Malfoy. ‘You see, I think you’re lying... I could take out the Secrecy Sensor to prove it.’
‘Good morning listeners and a warm welcome back to the day. This is News Treat Live From New Street – Treating you well.’
Girls were screaming, Weasley was swearing and the crowd bellowed all around them. Low roars and growls escaped Potter with every punch, and Draco cried and whimpered in pain. Harry’s knees were pressing Draco into the grass while the Gryffindors hit Draco’s chest, arms, stomach, sides, jaw –
Draco’s heart skipped a beat as he immediately pictured Harry’s countless powerful moments. He tried to distance himself.
Draco couldn’t even look at the guy anymore. He’d simply hated him before, but everything got infinitely more annoying and complex since he’d failed to rat Potter out to the Dark Lord, and even more after Potter’d saved Draco’s damned life in return. Spending years thoroughly burning all bridges for a war Draco’d eventually lost, did not aid in their connection either. It had taken him far too long to realise he’d been a right jackass, and now each time he looked at Potter, he felt a wave of guilt, shame and discomfort.
He would ask his friends, but knowing them they would share a look of something Draco could not yet work out and then pat him on the head in something along the lines of sympathy? They had started making even less sense since they became a couple than they had originally.
Draco frowned before he turned around to see Potter looking his way. Their eyes met across the room like they had done so many times over the last few days, the hatred that used to burn in Potter’s gaze had dimmed slightly, it was obviously still there but it didn’t seem to be at the main thing at the forefront of his eyes as he stared at Draco.
He sat up and stared at Draco for what seemed like hours, his eyes holding Draco’s grey captive making him not want to look away.
He piled the books onto the table and shoved them in his bag in a way that would have had Madam Pince crying. On the other side of the table, Theo stood calmly, amused as he watched Draco panic pack all his stuff away,
“Draco,” Nott spoke in parting as he headed to the end of the Slytherin table where Daphne Greengrass and the other girls were giggling away.
The door to the dungeons swung open to uncover Pansy and Blaise with identical looks of annoyance written all over,
Blaise decided to join the ‘make Draco as embarrassed as physically possible trend’ and remind Draco of his words from last night, “Don’t forget about his sad-looking hair Pans.”
“ENOUGH! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter, in my office.” Umbridge giggled as the words left her mouth into the nearly silent room which was full of students holding their breath and Potter’s jagged breathing as he stood leaving his belongings on the desk in front of him.
“I didn’t know if you wanted company or not, but the common room was far too loud to work,” Theo sat down, pushing Draco’s shit aside to place his book down,
“I didn’t realise the time,” He mumbled as they both head out the common room, “Was too engrossed in the potions book we needed for the essay Snape set, he knows how to set hard stuff I’ll say that”
Draco reached for Potter’s hand that lay rested on the stone, over the few times he had healed the hand Potter resisted less and less. Just letting Draco get on and heal it. The words were still clear in the light of the half-moon, but they were far from the red and angry looking marks they were the first time Draco healed them. But although Draco’s healing was helping, it was obvious that it was the only healing that was happening, Potter hadn’t had any other help with his injury. And so for the first time, Draco spoke more than one word to Potter during their interaction.
Pansy sat on the sofa the three of them claimed in the third year, “ I don’t even know love, your expectations for the bugger are too high.”
“Draco.” He corrected, “And so absolutely much, I was wallowing in self-despair and loneliness without you.” He clutched at his heart, as they turned the corner to where the doors to the Great Hall were located,
Draco was unaware of the fact that many hours had passed since he first came to the table, all of the books and work lay untouched for most of those hours.
Oh Merlin, how Draco wanted to scare Potter and take points away for being out after curfew but the look on his face turned him against the first option.
“Anyway, thank you for earlier. Umbridge has been on my back all fucking term.” Potter faced Draco sincerity held in his eyes,
“Well yes Potter, I do. They are my best friends after all.” Draco ever so slightly smiled thinking about them.
The great hall was just as Draco remembered, so fucking loud. But this year there was heavy anticipation in the air which Draco could only narrow down to being Potter. Of course. The majority of the Hogwarts houses kept throwing glances at the doors as if the answer to all their questions would walk through it at any moment, Draco couldn’t blame them he was also waiting for answers in the form of Harry Potter and his crew.
If the first few weeks were an indicator of how the year was going to pan out then Blaise was entirely correct. Everyone was acting highly suspicious, Potter and his crew included. Pansy being the ever-most gossiper in Hogwarts, got all the drama from the houses. And this year surprisingly as ever, Potter was the center of the drama, and this year is the fact the Gryffindors are calling Potter a liar, including the explosive Seamus Finnegan who went at Potter in the common room. Hilarious if you asked Pansy, typical Gryffindor behavior if you asked Blaise, and well if you asked Draco he would just roll his eyes and mutter, “Fucking Potter.” So nothing out of the blue.
The castle was quiet at night, the darkness seeped through the walls casting chills along Draco’s spine as he crept up towards the astronomy towers after he had finished his prefect rounds that night.
Draco could spot the black hair of Pansy right away in the crowd of green, red, yellow, and blue. Sat along with Blaise, they were engaged in some kind of heated discussion of some sort, that Draco really didn’t want to be involved in.
All Draco could see for that brief amount of time was green, Potter’s eyes were really truly fucking green.
also yes this is love story for the chapter name. taylor's version only... APRIL 9TH IS LEGIT LIKE NEXT WEEK, don't touch me.
Was it wrong to compare the situations? Oh most definitely yes, but Draco wasn’t known for being kind. Especially when it came down to Hogwarts resident Golden Boy. Okay well ignoring that morning’s out-of-character behavior, Draco had never once been anything remotely near nice to Potter, really it was Potter’s fault… Draco did offer his hand in friendship in their first year and what did Potter do? Laugh in Draco’s bloody face and deny him. So yes it was completely Potter’s fault they hated each other’s guts.
Looking around Draco searched for anyone at all who could accompany him down to the Great Hall so he wasn’t alone with the idiots. There sat in the corner with his nose in a book, as usual, was Theodore Nott, Nott was a quiet kid who didn’t care for the dramatics or drama that surrounded Blaise and Pansy. That being said Draco had spoken to him on numerous occasions, he had the intelligence levels that matched Draco’s quite well and that made for conversations Draco enjoyed. And even aside from those conversations, Nott was just generally a nice guy, and well he wasn’t bad on the eyes which was always a playing factor.
“That’s fair.” The doors to Great Hall were insight now as Theodore rambled about the uses of Moonstone.
Draco slapped the dark hand rudely placed on his head, smoothing out his hair that was messed up in the process, Blaise really didn’t understand beauty.
“Yeah,” Draco blurted out, “Hiding it from Pansy and Blaise is harder than I thought.” He glanced at Potter out of the corner of his eye to see that he had turned to face Draco as he spoke, “They keep questioning me about where I go and why I’m being so weird.”
She began to open her mouth most likely to give Potter detention for something random and out of his control when Draco acted. He didn’t know why he kept acting so rash when it came to Potter, Draco's idiocy really showed during these times. He cast a discreet tripping jinx on Potter and watched as he tumbled. Appearing as if he just tripped over nothing. Granger and the Weasel stopped as Potter reached down to pick up the books that had fallen out of his bag when he stumbled. Pansy snickered at his side, and Draco placed a well-practiced smirk on his face, calling to Potter as they walked by.
Crabbe and Goyle didn’t answer. Gregory’s face contorted in confusion as he put an extra raspberry donut on Draco’s plate. ‘Here.’
‘So?’ said Barney. ‘What’s the issue? Go have fun with him. Life is far too short to worry about what your silly parents would think, believe you me. Keep it secret, for all I care, but you would be surprised–  Oh, your owl is back. I am out, bye.’
Draco picked up his letter, used his wand to rip the envelope open, and jumped back when something heavy dropped on the floor. His friends gathered around to look.
Bumping into a table, Draco backed away. ‘Ri-rid…’ he mumbled, his wand pointed at the figure – who was not real.
‘Prefects, make sure all Slytherin students are packed and ready to go first thing tomorrow morning. Every student leaving this common room before that time will risk serious consequences.’
‘Crabbe, get going!' he snarled as he wrote. 'Come on, get dressed! Something is wrong, alright?’ Draco had a bad feeling. A terribly, ominously bad feeling. ‘Oh, and Goyle, if we don’t come back, pack our things. Pack Nott’s things too. Or make Zabini do it. Don't forget to – No, ask Pansy to –’ He shook his head and added a line in his letter to Pansy, so she’d make sure all their things were packed if they didn’t return.
‘What? No,’ Draco said. ‘No! Well, I don’t think so…’ He considered it, then put his arms on his head in despair. ‘I don’t know!’
Draco did not have a solid answer to that. He gathered he’d better keep quiet about trying to lure Potter to him. Best to change the subject: ‘You want revenge?’
Harry lingered, watching Draco Scorgify. It encouraged Draco. Mustering up the nerve, he took a deep breath and in his most bored drawl he asked: ‘Fancy a game of Quidditch later?’
At half-past nine the next morning, they were called forwards class by class to enter the Great Hall, where the four house tables had been replaced with many tables for one. When they were all seated and quiet, Professor McGonagall said, ‘You may begin,’ and turned over an enormous hourglass on the desk beside her. Draco took a breath, focused on the parchment in front of him – and started.
‘Fine,’ said Granger, now sobbing into her hands again, ‘fine… let them see it, I hope they use it on you! Oh, I’d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was, and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them, they’ll be able to s-sort you out!’
A little known fact about Vincent Crabbe was that he was an avid drawer. Whenever he was nervous – which was always – he took to sketching. His favourite subjects were gruesomely violent scenes or women with disproportionate bodies, but still, he was quite good.
‘I should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm… about how I couldn’t use it for three months. I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself… “There’s no ’arm in ’im , ’on est“… That hippogriff’s as good as dead –’
‘You are on probation!’ shrieked Professor Umbridge at once, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. 'You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better! Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!’
‘Oh,’ said Bellatrix. She blinked heavily a few times, trying to look casual. ‘Oh, well… that’s – that’s good. I suppose.’
Right at that moment, a murmur broke out. Draco craned to see why and saw a tall figure in the doorway. Their Head of House had arrived.
‘I’m sure it is, you Malfoys always have everything worse, my mum says. But let’s try it anyway, alright? Just come along now, I’ll get you cleaned up. We’ll impress the heck out of those miserable Gryffindors. I learned a few mean make-up spells over the summer that’ll make your eyes pop. Ancient Parkinson secret.’ She winked. ‘You know we need it. Well, Primrose doesn’t of course, but daddy says she was delivered by the milkman.’
They found the Golden Trio in no time at all. A hot feeling of spite boiled under Draco’s skin as he slid open the door of their compartment. The conversation inside lagged.
One of their very first classes at Hogwarts was Potions. It took place down in one of the dungeons. On their way through the arched, stone corridors, Draco started whistling – and his whistling echoed back at him.
Tapping his forehead at Vincent and Gregory, Draco continued doing his homework at a table in the library that they’d been occupying for over an hour now. It was the best table – the one in the corner out of everyone’s way – and they should not give it up just for a walk.
Staring across the pond, Neil scrunched up his nose. ‘Not that I recall.’ Harry ran his hands through his hair, still panting loudly. ‘Sorry.’
‘He was provoked, Professor Snape,’ said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. ‘Malfoy was insultin' his family.’
Sometimes when Harry Potter laughed, it seemed to Draco like his hair crackled; as if it was charged with magic. It might have to do, Draco figured, with the Riddle of his Existence.
Draco let his eyes wander over to Harry, bracing himself to stay cool. ‘I suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?’
Through the haze of panic, he heard laughter, cheers and a shout of ‘They’re heading for the forest!’, followed by the slamming of a door – and then silence. Apart from Draco’s screams of pain and horror, and the terrible flapping of bat wings, no one made any sound.
‘Turn over your papers,’ said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Great Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. ‘You may begin.’
Draco shuffled over like a cautious animal. Glancing calculatingly from the joint to Harry, he took it. ‘Fine. You may continue.’ Merrily puffing his joint, he climbed on top of the desk with his feet up on the club chair.
Instead of chiding him, Snape asked where Potter had gone. It threw Draco off for a moment. After he answered, Snape said he’d deal with the Slytherins later and dashed out.
When he peeked through the umpteenth window, Draco’s heart skipped a beat, as he finally noticed the messy hair and broken glasses he’d been searching for.
‘Of course I am,’ Draco snarled, pressing his eyes closed against an inexplicable dizziness. ‘So… what, Zabini? You fancy me?’
On the first day of September, the Malfoys met up with the Crabbes and Goyles on Platform 9 3/4 as usual, when Goyle nudged Draco’s arm. ‘Oh Malfoy, look,’ he hissed. ‘Can I go pet it?’
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemort’s; their achievements during the days of Voldemort’s reign were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors.
‘Well, I need to talk to you,’ he said, ‘and it’s now or never apparently.’ He pointed at Draco’s letter.
The benefits of owning a dragon far outweighed any objections his parents could come up with, he was sure of it.
Draco wrinkled his nose looking at it. The elf looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, bat-like ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snout-like. Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked.
Gathering his thoughts, Draco put a comforting hand on the boy’s arm. ‘Hey, of course, little fighter, that’s the spirit. Look at you, staying so strong! You’re an absolute inspiration to all of us, buddy, showing us how blessed we are to be healthy. The way you handle your chronic illness – with such
Snape, however, was not pleased.  ‘Sit down,’ he snapped at Granger. ‘For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death.’
Her entire gang of Slytherin girls laughed at his startled face. Backing away, he saw the cover of the Evening Prophet.
Watching the miracle that was Harry’s smile, Draco felt every inch of his body relax. A sigh got stuck somewhere in his nervous tummy.
Crabbe snatched the wand from Taylor and while Draco stretched his painful arm, Taylor jumped on Crabbe like a pitbull to get it back and Pansy shrieked with laughter.
Viktor Krum was carrying Hermione Granger, and Draco felt sick. ‘If that Mudblood lives and Harry dies… Well, I’m gonna be so freaking pissed.’
Harry stared at him as if there was something weird on Draco's face. Then he seized his hand to put a Chocolate Frog in it.
The Quidditch season started with Crabbe and Goyle being chosen as the new Beaters. Draco’d put in a good word for them, saying they’d kept him from harm for the past four years at Hogwarts, so they could keep the Slytherin players from being hit by a Bludger too. They would replace Lucian Bole and Peregrine Derrick, whom Draco would miss; especially Derrick, who used to stick up for Draco without exception when Flint got angry with him.
‘Me neither. Did you see that dive though?’ Draco gestured wildly to re-enact the moment, while Harry raved on, ‘I’ve never seen anyone dive like that! He seemed to be weightless, as –’
‘Jenny from Steps & Fitness wants to know if Harry likes tea or coffee, and how he drinks it.’ Draco snorted. ‘Well, Jenny from Steps & Fitness, Harry doesn’t seem to care much about taste so long as whatever you put in front of him is boiling hot. As soon as you put a mug of tea under his nose, he starts gulping it down without restraint. It is honestly inspiring to watch. I could – from the bottom of my heart – recommend each of you to invite him for tea. Oh, and with just a splash of milk, to answer your question, Jenny… Next one: Desirée, our local Herbology student, wonders what fragrance Harry Potter likes to wear.’
Lupin looked even paler than usual. ‘Listen, I understand now why you didn’t want to do this in class – and if you don’t want to continue, it’s okay.’
First things first, however, and he went to the Library to find out what Sirius Black had done. How did someone kill thirteen people in one blow? He must have been incredibly powerful.
Somehow they reached the astronomy tower, eventually. Draco used his parent’s picnic spell to make the tiles feel soft and warm, and they laid down – the invisibility cloak still safely covering them both – to watch the stars.
When he mentioned the new Gryffindor Keeper, Draco lost it. ‘You’ve got to be joking! Are they collecting every Weasley in the castle?’
Her father - a balding man with a moustache, a cheerful face and a round belly - strolled leisurely out on the veranda. ‘Don’t shout, daughtermine. Think of the neighbours.’
Harry leaned unnecessarily over to the mic – Draco's eyes tracked the movement with a derisive lift of his nose. ‘No, thank you, Mr Malfoy. Excuse me for interrupting, but I was just noting that the Firebolt Pros aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. It’s a common misconception, actually. As I was saying, the original Firebolts are much more nimble, because they were made for Quidditch. The Firebolt Pros, however, are more durable, more stable, but it makes them less wieldy. They’re weighed down by safety spells. Which is for the best too, really. The Ministry’s Auror Department has a few of them and mine saved my neck dozens of times already.’
‘Did you know the Head Girl might have entered her name?’ said Pansy. ‘I don’t know her, but they’re saying she makes a good chance.’
Draco pointed his binoculars on Snape, who was moving his lips, looking concentrated – and he saw the Mudblood, creeping underneath the stands.
Draco let out a low, sneering laugh. ‘Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,’ he taunted. ‘Want to leave it to the Dementors, do you? If it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.’
‘Not too far from here,’ said the Gryffindor, who looked excited. ‘It was a Muggle who saw him. ’Course, she didn’t really understand. The Muggles think he’s just an ordinary criminal, don’t they? So she phoned the telephone hotline. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.’
To his amazement, Potter only slightly stumbled – as though being hit with the force of a saucepan was child’s play to him.
‘He was my dad’s friend,’ Harry said, scratching his armpit and following a bird’s flight with his eyes. ‘He taught me how to do a Patronus. And he’s pretty close to my godfather. We write sometimes.’
