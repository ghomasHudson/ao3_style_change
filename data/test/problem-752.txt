"I know.  But you're here, tasked with killing Dumbledore, because I lived.  Which means that to me, you're in danger because of me.  And I need to help you."
Harry realized all at once that this really wasn't a dream.  Wasn't a replay of the memory he'd seen.  It was a test.  A very BIG test.   "I do recognize you.  I've stood in this room before.  Seen you before."
"We couldn't find it in the day light anyways.  If you'd been paying any attention in class you would have realized that it only flowers at night."
He didn't want to be a Death Eater.  Once again a tool to be used in the war, just on a different side.
“Yes.  And Scorpius’ as well?”  Harry turned to look at the train, his eyes landing on each of his children before straying to Draco’s pale blonde son.  “Strange to think they’ll be in the same year like we were.”
"Paul looked like he was going to implode when he walked away from you."  She said with a laugh.  "Oh I wish I could put that sort of look on his face."
"It might be as simple as a new owl to start with.  A new owl and a late night delivery right to her room while she's asleep.  He, and no one, ever went into my parents bedroom.  And while I wouldn't trust that long term, it would be enough to start things."
"I smelled like lavender for days.  Ron said it was like being friends with a little old lady's purse."
Not like this was the first time in almost the full seven years since the war that they had seen each other.  Which was, actually, the truth.
Now they were extremely infrequent and until now had been completely untroublesome.  There were never names on them he recognized as intruders.  And what did it matter who went into the Manor- or tried to- anyways?  He should just stop opening them...
“Come off, Draco.  You saw him...  Don't tell me you wouldn't like to get 'creative' with Tom Riddle.”
"I suppose you're right."  Harry bobbed his head a couple of times slowly, his eyes turned down to look at Draco's hand on his knee.  "And now we're both.. Well I suppose you're still married but you're also not."
"See, that's the problem."  Draco said, straightening himself up in his chair a bit.  His shoulders set back and his chin raising a slight bit.  He looked every bit the arrogant boy he was in school though he didn't know it and couldn't control it even if he'd wanted to.
"Draco..."  Harry's voice was quieter and there was a soft thump against the door and then a slide and Draco knew Harry had just pressed his back against the door and slid down to sit on the stone front step.  "Please talk to me.  Please just tell me you're okay..."
"Snape."  Harry snorted, rolling his eyes a bit before he got to his feet.  "I should get back before Ron and Hermione turn up.  But that's another project right there."
What's an Unbreakable Vow?"  Harry asked curiously, half of him thinking Snape was out for glory with Voldemort, wanting to prove himself capable of anything for his Dark Lord.  And half of him thinking that he really did want to help Draco and that somehow his intentions were honourable.
Draco laughed and the tiny smirk grew into a proper one.  “They didn't have anything to do with it. Well... maybe indirectly.  They left me alone at Aunt Walpurga's years ago.  They thought she was home and they were in a rush so I was dumped and off they went.  She had a lot of books and an entire shelf that I had been told since I was a child I must never look at, so...”  Draco raised one shoulder in a shrug as he smirked even more.  “Most weren't that interesting, but one was full of the darkest spells you could imagine.  Horcrux creation was in there.”
He opened it carefully, sliding what seemed to be some squishy sort of material to keep it safe off the top before pulling the silvery square out.  It didn't really... look like anything he had seen in the window of the shop...  But he seemed to recall that you had to open them.  They unfolded to show the screen and what he was pretty sure was called a keyboard.
“Good luck..”  He said as he tipped his hand up at the open window and Mimir soared off into the night.
He stopped walking, tracing his fingers along the lines in his skin and smiled, realizing this was a nod, a pat on the shoulder almost, to say he wasn't alone.
"Are you CRAZY?" Draco asked with a surprised laugh.  "That's not exactly keeping things normal and not suspicious..."
Draco took in a sharp breath when he saw it, his hand instinctively reaching before stopping and pulling back again.  “My wand..” He said quietly, his eyes glued to the slender piece of wood that had been set down.  “That’s my original wand.”
He set it on the desk and pushed it across to Harry, nodding slightly.  "Just don't read it until you go home.  I don't want you to read it in front of me..."
"Kingsley is going to wait for it to happen, and see who it is that goes to Azkaban to release Lucius.  But you won't be without protection.  The Ministry will be standing by, Aurors will be discreetly placed all through your area.  24 hours a day, Draco...  Someone will always have eyes on your house."
“Something wrong?”  Harry ventured, leaning one arm against the counter and propping his head in his hand.  “You feeling okay?”
But instead he pulled a piece of parchment towards himself and started trying to write Harry a letter.  Tried to think up good reason for his silence that wasn't the truth... Tried to find reasons to keep him at arms length.
"Once is an accident."  Harry said, tilting his head enough to catch the edges of his now sore lips against Draco's that were red and puffy and looked rather enticing.  "Twice is coincidence.  It's that third time that's a problem..."
It should have been a wonderful day, as it had been the one scheduled for his internet installation, and it had started off really well.  Started off very promising.  But then the Auror that was assigned to be present while the muggle person was there knocked on the door.  And it was the one that wouldn't meet his eyes when he had handed over his Gringott's withdrawal form.
“Harry... I don't suppose Draco told you anything he had thought to fix it, has he?”  Hermione asked, running pages of the new book between her fingers as she looked at the other boy uncertainly.
“Always has to be a trial with him, doesn't it.  He can't just be forthright...”  Tom chuckled darkly, pushing a hand through his hair before turning his eyes over to Draco.  “Are you joining us or just staring?  I don't mind the staring, I just don't want to not include you in the conversation if you do wish to be part of it.”
Draco let out a bitter sort of laugh then, it slipped out without him realizing it or meaning to and he sighed, realizing he'd have to talk now.  He then turned and did the same as Harry, sliding down the door to sit on the floor, his back against the door.  "I'm not okay."
Harry smiled at the blonde, getting to his feet and stretching his arms over his head, the shirt he was wearing lifting enough to give the blonde and unintentional look at his stomach and hips.
Harry turned the scroll for Draco over his his hands, then carefully tucked it into the pocket of his jeans, looking back to Dumbledore with a nod.  "I will, sir.  And thank you."
"Can we meet day after tomorrow?"  Draco asked Harry, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
But he only did it to stop everyone from thinking he was mad.  Nothing would change his mind about the importance of finding Draco.  But if he was going to do it, he had to make sure everyone had forgotten he ever cared about it in the first place.
Draco smiled as the dark haired man got up to go to the sink and wash his hands as well.  "It's not fancy to wash your hands before you eat.  It's actually the most basic of hygiene."
Draco shook his head, keeping his hands behind his back.  “No.  I already told you, I didn't need all this coddling and neighbourhood tours.  I'm an adult, I am reasonably resourceful, I could have figured it out.”
Draco moaned, he couldn't help it.  The feeling of Harry's bare skin, slippery under water and hot as fire above it as he pressed into him was too much not to react to.
Draco jerked his head around to look at Harry in shock, making the dark haired boy realize that he'd just implied something he hadn't meant to.
Narcissa made a noise somewhere between 'mouse' and 'strangled cat', her pale cheeks getting two very bright spots of red on them.  "If you're lying to me.."
Harry, maddeningly, chuckled at him, which just made him more angry and he struggled harder against the magical bindings.
"Lots.  You can get Chinese or pizza or curry or.. just about anything really.  It's a big business, people use it instead of cooking for themselves."
“It's not though.”  Harry said, nodding as he curled his fingers around Draco's.  “Everything has changed but the way it's changed... It hasn't made it easier.”
Harry just chuckled, turning around to lean his back against the wall so he was facing the other boy.  "So the location was my idea but you wanted to meet tonight.  Something up?"
Harry smiled at that.  He couldn't help it, there was something so strange and delightful about speaking to 'Tom'.
After they had brought the food back to his flat (walking up three flights of stairs while lugging the bags like a fucking MULE...) Harry dragged him back out again, ignoring all his protests, and brought him to the restaurant.
"What else happened in here?"  Tom asked the question with such a bite, his eyes sharp and focused so intensely on Harry it was like he was trying to peer inside of him.
"No..." Draco said warily, shaking his head a bit.  "She hasn't been to see me or sent any owls since she turned up at the Manor unannounced.  .... Why?"
"It was really no trouble."  Draco said, taking off the work gloves he had put on (and endured a bit of teasing from Harry over) and brushed his hands off.  "You should have an easier time with the house in general now."
Draco's gaze faltered, but to his credit, he didn't look away.  He kept his eyes trained on Harry's, looking within the green depths as if trying to find something, some reason, some other way.  But he nodded, a small and slightly pained smile curving at his lips.  "I think it has to be.  But Harry..."
"All of it?"  Draco asked incredulously, looking at everything spread out.  There was so much, so many different stacks, so many forms, so many letters...
"Funny thing.  He goes missing, everyone assumes he's with family or dead or what have you, but maybe he isn't."  Ron spoke with a mouthful of food and smiled when Hermione swatted the back of his head.
Draco nodded first, then paused his brow furrowing and his head tilting.  “What ARE we working towards?  My.. task... isn't the full end goal here.  We do that, but.. then what?”
Harry laughed, leaning forward a bit as he watched Draco eat another one.  "I know.  It's the places that look the absolute WORST that have the best chips.  A place that looked like Honeydukes for chips like you were thinking would probably be all pretty and fun to see but wouldn't have anything that tasted this good."
"Oh no. Not at all."  The dark haired boy smiled a little more genuinely.  "You know what's really mad?"
Harry groaned, thumping down onto the floor.  He tossed his wand to the side and ground the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Draco leaned back against the couch, letting out a very long breath that seemed to come from the soles of his feet.  "I hope you're right."  He said quietly.
He learned about 'phone numbers' and watched as Neville put his and Harry's and a few other of the Auror's names and numbers into his phone.  He explained what to press to open his 'texts' and showed him how to send one.  Then sent one of his own to Draco so he knew what the phone would sound like when a text came in.
"Scrumptious."  Prue pronounced it as she tasted it, shaking her head with a smile, going in for another bite.  "Remarkable."
Harry had started smiling as Draco spoke, nodding his head slowly as he realized what the other boy was saying was everything that Snape had failed to impart to him the year before.  Probably because Snape made it out like he WAS attacking Harry.  That he was coming at him fast and hard and it seemed like he was trying to harm him.  What Draco said framed it better.  This wasn't an attack, it was someone looking at something he didn't want them to.  A book...  He just had to close it and then whoever it was couldn't see it no matter how much they tried to peer over his shoulder.
“You didn't really get your coffee.”  Draco eventually said, looking over at Neville.  “You can take some down to the street, I'm not fussed about the mugs.”
They where THERE.  The three of them were IN Malfoy Manor.  And if they were there, they weren't safe.  They were going to be turned over to Voldemort, they would be killed and then Draco didn't know if his own life ended or begun when the final blows were made.
They broke apart, after several long full minutes had passed, Draco taking in a sharp breath that was half need of oxygen and half shock at the sudden loss of heat and tingling sparks from everywhere their mouths had been touching.
"That would be even better."  Draco sighed softly, shifting under Harry who took that as a cue to slide away from the other boy.
Harry stayed quiet, watching Draco carefully.  He didn't want to pry too much, but he wanted to make sure Draco knew he was interested and invested in this.  “How awful?”
"We'll find a way."  He said firmly, looking straight into Draco's silver grey eyes.  And he meant it.
"Sorry, I didn't think it was that important.  Not like you didn't know we would need a new teacher for Defence Against the Dark Arts.  We do every year."
The fourth day he got a letter from Harry, short and to the point, asking him to come to Grimmauld Place.
“Hey...”  Neville said, leaning forward against the counter where he was sitting on one of the stools, his hand stretched out towards Draco but stopped just short of touching him.  “What are you thinking about?”
Harry stopped, figuring they were far enough away now that no one could see or hear them.  He smiled as he held up the pair of socks he was holding.
“I have to kill someone.”  Draco looked back at Harry as he spoke, watching and gauging his reaction in minute detail.
"The bottom tier is a french toast inspired cake, the middle is two half layers of raspberry with cream between them and the top tied is a coffee cake flavour."
His breathing came short and hard as he looked around wildly, twisting when he heard a twig snap, his heart rising to his throat as he heard a soft muttered noise behind Him and he turned again to try and see what it was.
"Then we get plans in place to keep you safe.  And once we know that without a shadow of a doubt, you're covered.  Then we start trying to save Dumbledore, too."
Much further away Draco gets another letter through his fireplace.  One he always thought he would be relieved to get, but now that it's in his hands, he just feels kind of sick...
"How did you know they would be here?"  He normally didn't plague his customers with questions but given the circumstances he felt he was owed at least a few answers.
Draco moaned, his hips pressing towards the slide of Harry's hands.  He loved the feel of it, loved that he could feel the other boy twitch, feel the catch in his breath, feel so much more of him than he could when they were bundled against the cold in the woods.  He was lost in the heat between them, the pull from deep inside of him that made his hips flex harder, that made Harry groan when he did it, made the dark haired boy's hands move faster.
They both got up, trying to move slowly and like they really didn't want to leave.  Which was true, but also Harry knew that both of them kind of wanted to bolt out of there and separate from the conversation they'd been having that was clearly of interest.
He was still smiling as he sat down at the Gryffindor table and fell into conversation with Ron while Hermione read The Daily Prophet.
Draco stayed silent as Harry spoke, and after he was finished, wrestling with this new knowledge that was clearly the truth.  He'd always thought Harry liked the attention and the spotlight, but now he wondered if perhaps it had just been said to him so many times by other people that it took over his own opinion.  Or lack there of.  "I didn't know that."
“And I wouldn’t hesitate to tell someone if I thought they were involved in something nasty again.  You know that and they know it too.”  Draco smiled a little more softly, closing his eyes as he leaned into Harry’s palm.  ”I just can’t believe this...  I thought for sure even with you speaking out for us we’d all end up in Azkaban.”
“Well I appreciate the honesty.  I suppose.  But could you listen please, this is important..”  Harry exhaled a sharpish breath of air, clearly nearing his threshold for putting up with Draco's bullshit.
Part of him thought he should be surprised like Dumbledore thought he should have been as well.  He thought maybe he should be surprised that Dumbledore was not intending to live past the end of the year.  But with it laid out the way it was in the letter he saw how everything that had happened so far that year added up to that.  That somewhere inside of himself, the pieces clicked in and he saw it perfectly and sensibly laid out.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
"Yes."  Harry said, having to work just as hard to swallow his own animosity.  "I know it seems completely unlikely, but Draco's not exactly enjoying the task he was put up to.  He doesn't WANT to follow through with it and never did.  He's doing it because he doesn't have a choice, and I'm not exactly unfamiliar with that side of things.  I don't care where Draco's allegiances were before this, I know where he stands now."
"Mm..  I never cheated on her.  Never.  I wouldn't do that..  But I couldn't help seeking out new male friends.  That I could have been into if it wasn't for her.  And I'd never tell them anything.  Ever... But you can just tell sometimes with the right people and so we'd get really close and get really... borderline obsessive, to be honest.  One day, during one of these friendships, she was so angry at me for focusing so much on him and not on her.  She said 'Why don't you just go and marry HIM then!?' And I just..."
"No, certainly not."  Hermione shook her head and seemed to relax entirely when Harry spoke so easily about Draco.  "Are you going?"
"Well he has reason, I guess, given my father was an asshole to him when they were in school.  But I don't like him either so fair is fair."  Harry turned his head and smiled back at Draco.
Now he's agreed to try and talk to Theodore if Harry allowed it.  Not just agreed to TALK to him, but try and convince him to go into hiding under the care of the Ministry Aurors.  Truly impossible and yet he'd said YES...
Draco ducked his head a bit, smiling and going slightly pink.  "I told you, the arrogant prick still exists.  Just not quite the same way."
"Why do you care?"  Draco asked quietly and hesitantly, like he was scared that Harry would reply that he didn't.
"It'll hurt.." Harry breathed the words out above Draco, his hips between his thighs and the blonde boy's hand around his cock, urging him forward.
Harry grinned as he waved his hand a bit.  "He collects people he thinks will have connections for him later in life.  I met him this summer, Slughorn, he didn't waste any time in telling me he could get Holyhead tickets whenever he wanted and the Editor of the Daily Prophet always wanted to hear his opinion on the news.  Or that Honeyduke's send him a hamper every Christmas.  He likes influential people, we were there being vetted for him to decide if he wanted to keep us or not."
“I knew there was a reason I loved you.” Draco peeled back the lid, and the smell of Harry’s chicken casserole filled the room, to quite a few hungry groans. Not saying a word, Harry just handed him a fork and watched as Draco dug into the meal right there. Grinning, Harry steered him down the corridor towards his office. He pushed Draco into his chair and cleared some room on his desk. He had heard about sauce stains on Draco’s patient files for weeks. Arguing that he was not to blame, he had not even been there didn’t make any difference.
Harry had never been with such a vocal lover before but it was turning him on something fierce. There was something about being with someone who told you exactly what they wanted. Muttering the spell, Harry found his hand covered in a slippery lube and he easily slid two fingers into Draco’s passage to his guttural groan. Giving him time to adjust Harry started to finger fuck him in time to sucking on that gorgeous cock. It was thick and firm under his lips, he was forced to take it deeper as Draco could not keep his hips still, a sure-fire sign he was close to coming. Twisting his hand, Harry stroked his fingers over Draco’s prostate to his howl of pleasure.
“Well, he certainly got your looks,” Harry asked looking up to catch Draco’s smile at the thought of his son.
Somehow, over the years, they had all ended up as friends of a sort. So Harry couldn’t avoid Draco nearly as much as he would have liked.
“I thought that was you, Draco?” Harry queried taking a beer from Ron. The glare he received brightened Harry’s mood significantly. They may not be children any longer but some things never changed and riling up Draco Malfoy was one of life's simple pleasures.
In their competitiveness to outdo each other, neither paid all that much attention to where they were going and they ended up miles away from the others. They only realised once they had finally come to a stop at the bottom of the mountain. Harry pushed his ski goggles up on the top of his head.
Draco grabbed Harry’s waistband and tugged him further into his lap, not wanting the dark-haired man to end up on the floor, well not unless Draco was down there with him but alas, the carpet didn't have the same appeal as the large comfortable bed in the other room but was that taking things too far, too fast. Hell, right now Draco didn’t care, he was swept away with the feeling of Harry in his lap, kissing him back and knowing there was no way they could be disturbed.
Harry couldn’t help feeling a little jealous of the look Blaise gave Ginny, it was clear he adored the fiery redhead. Not that he ever told her, - he didn’t have a death wish - but Harry, Ron and her other brothers had a stern talking to Blaise when he and Ginny had first started dating. From experience, Harry knew exactly how terrifying the Weasley boys could be when they faced a common goal. Blaise had been smart enough to take their not-so-subtle threats to heart. He had proposed on Ginny’s birthday earlier in the year although they had not yet set a wedding date.
“You can tell them that at Sunday lunch, and don’t bother arguing, you will be attending with me, not right now, but one day,” Harry told him forcefully, to Draco’s slight shudder. There was something about being ordered about that clearly his body enjoyed.
“Yes fine, I don’t suppose there’s any food in this place? I need food, I’m not drinking on an empty stomach.” Not waiting for an answer, he walked over to the cupboard and he had admitted to himself that yes, he was being a coward
Harry hated to admit it but Draco was a bloody good skier, but then it stood to reason he would be as fearless on skis as he was on a broom. It was similar, the feeling of flying down the mountain, the wind whipping past them, the trees flying by as they weaved and ducked between them. Harry could see Draco’s grey ski jacket just out to the side and crouched lower over his skis, hoping to gain more speed.
“I’ve told you things that I’ve never told anyone before, and it's not just the Firewhisky talking, you’re easy to talk to,” Draco admitted. “I used to see a mind healer for a few years after the war, she saved me.” Draco laughed bitterly, “I couldn’t talk to my parents or my fiancée yet could blurt out everything to a stranger.” Harry grabbed his hands to stop him playing with the sheets.
“I was fit to murder you at first,” Harry admitted getting to his feet. “Changed my mind though,” he again pulled each twin into a rough hug. Besides Ron, who would always be his best friend, Harry was closest to these two.
“Well, it ain’t much o’ a bird, normally they be 10 galleons but 7 will do?” the little bird screeched in indignation at hearing that, much to Draco’s amusement. He lightly stroked its head, and it settled again. Draco also purchased everything any self-respecting owl could need. Shrinking everything but the owl and his cage Draco walked to the nearest apparition point and soon found himself in the front room of his and Harry’s flat.
Harry pulled back slightly, mostly to breathe, but happily swallowed Draco’s cock to the base again, reaching up and fondling his balls, making the man beneath him squirm and gasp in delight.
“You’re so bloody bossy!” Draco complained, grinning, even though he knew Harry couldn’t see him. However, it was true, Harry was a bloody bossy lover and had the filthiest mouth Draco had ever come across, but fuck if that didn’t turn him on too. Draco would never have been able to guess, when they’d started dating, that Harry was the kinkiest man he’d ever dated. The filthy things he’d convinced Draco to do were numerous, and now it appeared ladies’ lingerie was next on that list. Draco knew without a shadow of a doubt he was going to wear those knickers for Harry, hell he’d even wear full Gryffindor robes if Harry asked.
Draco stared up at the sign above the door. He’d discussed his plan with Ron, Hermione and even Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Ginny. They’d all assured him that for all of Harry’s stubbornness, this was the right thing.
Knowing full well what Harry was getting at, and knowing him well enough, Draco knew Harry could take him quickly like this, and it had been a while since they’d played this game. Roughly dragging Harry where he wanted him, to his laughter, Draco pinned him face down, shoving his legs open and lined himself up. Harry squeezed their joined fingers to let him know he was okay, and Draco pushed in one long constant thrust to Harry’s moan as his body was breached.
“I know Gin, I’m really happy for you, he’ll be a far better husband than I ever was,” Harry admitted with a small, sad smile. He did love Ginny, he had since he was a boy. Unfortunately, they had grown apart and had decided to divorce five years ago. Not that it made the slightest bit of difference to the Weasley’s. Harry was still part of the family and he considered Ginny one of his best friends. He knew for a fact that she and Hermione were trying to set him up with someone. He could do without that, his two best girlfriends setting him up on a blind date. It was the stuff of nightmares. He shuddered lightly at the thought.
Harry hadn’t mentioned the knickers again, he didn’t have to. Draco could not get them off his mind. A few times he found himself standing in their bedroom, knickers in hand and rock hard, somewhat inconvenient when his boyfriend wasn’t due home for hours. Stripping off his healer’s robes and underclothes, Draco stood naked in their room, caressing the soft silk. Bending over, he slipped them over his feet and tugged them up.
“Yep,” he stammered on a gasp, his whole-body shuddering in pleasure. “But we can discuss it much later.”
“You’re my Christmas present Malfoy, you’re not going anywhere, yet!” He was right, they were too old to be fucking on the floor, however, it had been fun. Grinning Harry couldn’t wait to horrify Hermione and Ron at their New Year’s Eve party. Maybe he’d even bring Malfoy.
“Well, we have known each other since we were eleven, even if most of that was childhood arch enemies.” Draco’s drunken grin made Harry laugh.
“Probably this,” Draco said before pushing Harry hard against the door and kissed him. There was nothing soft and sweet about it. The kiss was rough and demanding, all teeth and tongue. There was no way Harry was letting Draco win this battle, so he effortlessly pushed off the door and, still kissing him, backed Draco to the bed. With a wicked smirk, Harry shoved Draco backwards onto the bed and following him down, he continued their passionate kissing, which soon led to Harry peeling those leather pants from Draco’s body to their mutual satisfaction.
Striding off down the short hall, Draco found the cabin did have a loo, a basin and an old claw foot bathtub. Taking care of business, Draco washed his hands and braced his hands on the old chipped sink and stared at himself in the mirror. Draco had never really paid much attention to his looks but the man staring back at him from the mirror looked old and tired.
“Harry, it’s stunning,” Draco could not take his eyes off the beautiful dark blue corset. The body of it was a heavily embroidered satin, topped by sheer gathered fabric, Draco wasn’t exactly sure what it was called, and a sheer frill at the top and bottom with small bows.
“Anti-tampering charm. Hands off until we open it together, I want to see your reactions.” Harry walked over and picked up the bag, removing the spell and handing it to Draco.
“It won’t be easy, you know, that right? But then again when have we ever done easy?” he grinned at Draco’s huff of laughter.
He was over the moon for his friends however; it made the fact he was lonely harder to hide. He wanted his own special someone. He and Ginny had called it off last summer, realising that though they loved each other, they weren't in love the same way Ron and Hermione were. Ginny was one of his best friends and therefore had no hesitation pointing out the cute men in the pub, at least until he’d threatened to hex her. He may no longer be dating the only Weasley girl, but he was still an honorary Weasley.
“To bed, night,” Harry said having difficulty stifling his grin. He knew damn well the state he’d left Draco in and knew without a doubt he’d do something about it. Sometimes teasing his boyfriend was one of the best parts of his day, well that and when Draco took his revenge and made Harry bend to his will. Not that it took much bending. That was half of the fun of it.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hips to steady him, not sure he could manage much more right now at the incredible sensation of his cock slipping into Harry. He was tight and snug, the slippery lube easing the way, and Draco had to start reciting potions ingredients to get his body back under control.
“Come here you!” Harry growled grabbing his hand and roughly dragged Draco back into his lap as the blonde wrapped his hand around their cocks, pumping them together to their mutual moans, spreading their pre-come to make the slide easier. The slight callouses on Draco’s wand hand adding extra stimulation.
“Fuck, I need you naked,” Harry whined, not caring how that sounded and with a wandless spell vanished the last of their clothing to their mutual moans. “Better?” he questioned, grinning at the look on Draco’s face.
Draco had never been so turned on and frustrated before in his life. He badly wanted to come, unsure if he could continue to hold back.
“We got married thanks to James, he decided to make an early appearance.” Harry smiled at the memory, “Ginny said it didn’t matter if we were married or not but I knew it would have mattered to Molly and Arthur. I’d never been so terrified having to face the people who had been like parents to me and admit I’d got their daughter pregnant.”
By midnight, everyone decided it was time for bed as they had to be up early to get ready to hit the slopes. Choruses of
All too soon, just as the first lighter shades of blue lightened the sky, Harry was rudely dragged from his slumber, by a very grouchy Draco. Sleepily Harry couldn’t understand what Draco was grouchy about, he had tea already.
“I thought we were celebrating on Saturday?” Draco asked, filling a crystal vase with water and unwrapping the roses, setting the beautiful paper and ribbon aside for their nieces.
“I have a far better idea for this,” he said stroking it, “Fuck me, Potter, it’s my turn to see stars!” with that Draco flopped on his stomach beside Harry, spreading his legs and making himself quite comfortable.
As Ginny had predicted, Seamus was cooking something amazing if the appreciative groans from the hungry adults were any indication. Harry kept his grin to himself as Dean thrust a stack of plates into Draco’s hands and told him to help set the table. The look on the former Slytherin’s face was priceless. However, with their combined efforts, the table was soon set and even with candles. Seamus came out of the kitchen carrying a huge pot of something that smelt damn good. Dean had a bowl full of mashed potatoes and Ginny the vegetables.
Harry’s roughness was exactly what Draco needed as he covered his stomach with his release, gasping through it and feeling like he had been in a Quidditch final. He was totally wrung out.
Instinctively, Draco grabbed Harry’s hips to prevent him toppling to the floor and tipped his head back, staring up into those vivid green eyes that had haunted more than one of his dreams. Harry’s face was flushed from the heat in the cabin and the amount of Firewhisky they had both consumed. Even though it was highly inappropriate, Draco was in no hurry to let the other man off his lap. He was a comforting weight, and he smelt bloody fantastic too. A mixture of Firewhiskey, vanilla and sandalwood.
“That bastard Zabini is in trouble when I get my hands on him!” Draco growled, for show than anything else. Blaise had threatened months ago to do something about Draco’s very inconvenient attraction to Harry but he’d never thought his so-called best friend would act on his evil plan. Draco had underestimated the dark-skinned Italian, he’d not do that again.
The sting of Draco’s entry made Harry gasp, the pleasure-pain making him whimper, but it was so good. Draco was by far the biggest lover he’d ever had. Long and thick, he split Harry open on a very regular basis. He could feel the heat radiating off Draco’s body as he sprawled on Harry’s back. His hips are making a slow dance as Harry gasped and moaned under him. Those little hip swivels made Harry even crazier than Draco’s fast thrusting did.
Sleepy mutterings of “Merry Christmas” and “Morning” echoed through the house as excited kids and sleepy adults descended the stairs.
“Come for me, I want to feel you fill me,” Harry whispered as he clenched around Draco’s girth. “Please?” that was all it took for Draco to start to move again, hard strong thrusts into the willing body above him.
“So, Draco, signed, sealed and delivered it seems?” Harry commented, holding the tag between two fingers and waving it to the Slytherin’s scowl. Tossing it aside, Harry reached out, trailed his fingers down Draco’s chest between the ribbons, and watched as a plethora of goosebumps erupted in their wake.
“In the bathroom, come on, a soak with do us both good,” Harry helped Draco to his feet, hiding his small grin at how wobbly Draco was, and led him into the bathroom. Steam was still rising from the water and the smell of Patchouli mingled with the sweet smell of hot chocolate. Harry had put two large towels beside the mugs and carefully stepped into the hot water and made himself comfortable.
’, Draco vaguely thought, but it was true. Draco had envied Harry’s friendships, even now he still had a large group of close friends he could rely on. Draco had friends but, being typical Slytherin's, it was more for what they could get out of each other than true friendship.
“Not bad so much as busy, spells backfired, and charms cast wrong. Potion poisoning. That sort of thing.” Draco sipped his tea, sighing in appreciation. “Healer Donovan floo called in sick, so we’re down as well.” Understaffed was an issue Harry knew well. They chatted about mundane things until Patricia stuck her head in the door.
“That’s right, haven’t got a girl, so different from bringing up boys I can tell you. Lily is so different from her brothers, not just that she’s a girl but her whole personality. She’s far more loving and loves to bake with Nana Molly and spending time with her cousin Rose. She loves nail polish and ribbons. Merlin helps the boy who wants to date my little girl.” Harry said, his protective father instincts coming forth.
“Do you… fuck… want me to pull… out?” Harry managed to choke out, he was so close to losing control. He hoped not, but it was polite to ask.
Draco handed over the massive tray of chicken they had been asked to bring and followed Harry into the front room. Even with the reduced presents, the tree was hardly visible. Draco wasn’t sure who was more excited - the kids or Harry.
“Well, I did play Seeker,” Harry quipped to Draco’s eye roll as he returned to bed, crawling in and settling against the pillows, finally looking around their little love nest.
“Our betrothal was announced when I came of age, we married three years later. Astoria loved the thought of being the next Mrs Malfoy, I’m still not sure I was part of that excitement.” Draco drained half his drink, staring into the flames. “It was a disaster from the beginning. I knew all my father cared about was the Malfoy line continuing but it took six long years for her to get pregnant. I was so relieved when she made the announcement and I could remove myself from her bedchamber to both our relief, and wait for our son to be born.” Draco finished his drink and poured another. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to blurt all that out.”
on the table and the little owl hopped over to the bag and knocked it over. However, no treats fell out, much to his clear disgust evidenced by the loud squawk he directed at the bag. Which set both men chuckling. It seemed he didn’t much care for that either and his next squawk was directed at them.
“Better?” Draco asked sipping his tea, he was curious about Harry’s nervousness. It was in stark contrast to the man Draco knew from work. He had seen Harry stand up and argue his case in front of the whole Wizengamot without notes and not hesitate once, truly it was a sight to behold, Harry Potter arguing his case. Honesty Draco thought he was wasted as an Auror, Harry would have made a first-class Wizengamot member.
“Are you going to corrupt me on the lounge, again are you?” he asked grinning as Draco took his glasses off and put them out of harm's way, this close Harry could still see him clearly enough to see that wolfish grin that never failed to turn his insides to mush.
“Oh, it has its moments, but they are pretty good kids and Molly and Arthur helped a lot. You never know, you may meet someone else and give Scorpius brothers and sisters.” Draco’s inelegant snort was so out of character, Harry nearly choked on his Firewhisky.
Outside, in the night sky, two shooting stars finally crashed into each other in a spectacular display of sparks.
“Don’t give me that rubbish, whatever is in that bag is just as much for your enjoyment as mine.” Draco correctly guessed. “Well go and put it away, dinner is going to be ready soon.” Draco knew damn well he’d not be able to concentrate on anything else except that bag all night. “Bloody Potter!” he muttered under his breath as Harry disappeared down the hall.
Draco tried to stay awake, but the room was warm from the fire Harry had started. With the warm room and the fantastic sex soon had him drifting off to sleep, far too relaxed and sated to bother moving.
“Astoria, you’re looking well,” Harry replied kissing her cheek. “So, this is your place is it?” Harry knew he was stating the obvious, but it had thrown him finding her here. He’d lost track of what had happened to the Greengrass sisters.
“It goes this way,” he turned it around and held the elastic up against Draco’s waist. “The straps should go under the knickers, that way you can keep it on when I drag them off.” Harry wasn’t going to admit he’d been just as confused until Astoria had shown him how it was worn.
only known each other for a few days? Yes. Does that diminish the fact that we know this could be something strong? Not at all! Now I don’t know what the cause of your concerns are, and I understand that it’s personal but if I may offer some advice?” Harry asked, looking for a green light from Draco.
Through all this, Voldemort could hear, feel and experience every little thing in Harry's dream. Even though he was only partly aware that he was Voldemort and not Harry, the conspiring didn't stop.
Harry sighed. “I know what you’re trying to get at Elena but what is prompting you to say all this? Your approach has never been to let me know what I was doing wrong. I was getting used to that.” His voice was light but the implication of his words were not.
Shortly after the two had finished their lunch, determining what to do after was a difficult decision to make. Mostly because Pansy wanted to shop for shoes and Draco wanted to shop for mugs.
Every step felt like one in the right direction. Harry gave Draco the room he needed to make breakfast and twiddle around, while Draco paid attention to what Harry was doing but seemed to give him the benefit of the doubt that Harry would not mess up the order in his kitchen (Harry wouldn’t dare attempt such a thing). The music moved their feet around in rhythmic patterns, and slowly but surely Harry found himself swaying to the sounds created by Draco’s radio. Walking backwards to where Draco was, he took hold of his hands from behind and tried to slow dance with their bums gently pressing against each other. Soon enough Draco spun him around and took the lead, the sounds of the Beatles filling the tiny kitchen as the two of them found a rhythm they could both swing to. The moment was so perfect, it almost looked like it was out of a Hallmark movie.
“I’m sorry I don’t think our conversation covered that last night, thank you for clarifying. I’ll add it to my resume,” Harry expressed, with a cheeky wink at the end of it.
as to how they haven’t blinded themselves with their inefficient lighting options.” Not wanting to go on any more about her design pet peeves, Pansy switched the conversation over to Harry. “Enough about me, do you have any particular colours you want to add to your home Harry? Or were you confused about that as well?”
Deciding it was now a conversation and being unable to take a hint, Jerry continued making small conversation, the worst kind of conversation Draco decided.
Normally, Harry found solace in roaming the aisles of Ikea, fluttering about the lamps and different light switches or testing any sofa that looked comfortable (so all of them) but today having both Pansy and Draco “helping” him shop for things he needed in his apartment only made him want to set a silencing charm on them but that would be too obvious and he couldn’t risk it.
Harry crawled up Draco's body, grabbing his tie and carefully wrapping and knotting it around Draco's delicate wrists and the headboard. He grinned down at Draco, who was glaring at him with lust blown eyes. "Do you mind?" Draco said through clenched teeth, eyes dropping to his erection.
Music played in the background as Draco fiddled with the sugar and flour, stirring the batter with a metal whisk to the tune of the music, swinging his hips absentmindedly. Soft lyrics about love accompanied by a deep rhythm of synchronised drums floated through the kitchen as the shower turned on across the apartment. No one had dared to spend the night before, much less shower the next day in Draco’s house, but that was also because they were driven away by some crazy story Draco would tell them after they’d reached completion. Harry seemed to have been a first in many ways; most importantly, his first non-sexual one night stand.
“I’m sorry to hear that.” Harry paused. He wanted to know more but understood how Draco felt. He did have another question, or really a proposition. One that might have an answer he didn’t like, but he sure hoped Draco would comply with.
Harry twined his fingers in soft blonde hair, eyes fluttering closed as he melted into Draco's kiss. His fingers traced Draco's sharp jaw, thumbing at his chin and gently tugging him away.
The absence of a reply dropped Draco’s heart to the ground and his anxiety seemed to be knocking with a new rhythm. Harry'd had a change of heart, he didn't want to be around Draco anymore - maybe he had gotten tired of being around him. Soon, Draco began spiralling, every type of worst case scenario filling his head as he paced around his bedroom, not only unable to decide what he was going to wear but do for the day as if subconsciously, he let his day rely on what Harry wanted to do. It had only been two days, for goodness’ sake!
“Shh!” Draco was always easily embarrassed in public places but Pansy had simply waved him off, silently asking him to continue, “Don’t even remind me about that. Well, I couldn’t just leave right? So I stuck it out for an hour or so and just said goodbye to Juliana when he wasn’t around. It threw me off so badly I almost forgot that Harry existed and how wonderful he is.”
As he walked out the door, Harry decided dropping a small but surprising bomb on Elena would only do her some good.
Harry smiled at the thought of how he and Draco met. It was a proper movie moment and he would probably never get over it.
Normally, Draco would tell someone to go fuck themself if they tried to give him any advice but he could tell that Harry was only trying to help, the least he could do was comply.
Of course, Harry will do whatever Draco wants. So, he carried Draco to the bed, letting him drop down onto the soft mattress.
The group walked back towards the lights section as Pansy continued conversing with Harry, leaving Draco to intently listen.
Dragging this would only be painful for him so Draco had simply told her in one long rambling speech: “Well, I went to the coffee shop next to my apartment after a week or so mostly because I was busy with this man, yes the one I mentioned earlier, and he was absolutely wonderful. We just talked all night and day two nights in a row, and we didn’t even do anything besides that!” Draco nodded rapidly at Pansy’s shocked face and continued. “Yeah, I know! And as I was reeling in the happiness of that and meeting Jul after so long, out of nowhere, pops up Nicolas, who I haven’t heard a peep of in the last six months when I caught him practically cheating on me in our bedroom and just gives me my order while talking to me about his shift change! All happy and cheery like nothing happened! Like we were just two pals catching up!”
no less, Draco frowned. “Harry, I don’t remember there being any ice cream. I’m positive I finished it last week over dinner with a friend of mine.” Just as Draco made that observation, the faint light from the bathroom window showed that Harry had stopped all movement.
. Most of the time, they were about Draco. In fact, a lot of them were about Draco. Different forms each time. Going into detail would be quite tedious let's get to that, later shall we?
While Draco was freshening up, Harry threw their blankets into the laundry, put on his clothes, and began searching around for a piece of pen and paper. As much as he didn’t want to leave like this, it was getting late and he had only so much time before he had to go to work. Moreover, he didn’t want to interrupt Draco’s bathroom concert. Once the items were acquired, Harry tried to make his handwriting as legible as he could and simply wrote:
Quickly enough, Jerry was out of Draco’s sight and the lift attendant hadn’t said anything but Draco could feel the judgement radiating off of him so he'd sprinted off the elevator too hoping to never see either of them again.
“Eh, we’ll see about that.” Harry’s playful smirk appeared to do nothing to reassure Draco and yet he seemed unable to help himself from attempting to kiss it off Harry’s face.
Harry sits up, green eyes sparking with veiled irritation. Who did Draco think he was? Well; Draco knew exactly who he was. Harry couldn't stop his low chuckle. He would forgive Draco for virtually anything...as long as he was taught a little lesson.
“Now tell me, what was so important that you had to awkwardly cut our call this morning?” Pansy just asked the question Draco had been dreading the most, but he also wanted to talk about it so he was glad she brought it up otherwise they would have been here longer than necessary.
The broken-souled man looked down to his, or rather Harry's, hands. They were no longer slim, like a skeleton. They were a healthy brown with ragged and torn nails, a clear sign of how nervous Harry was when alone. In his hands was a self-inking quill and Harry was writing at a lightning speed. He was pouring his complete thought process in that small, frayed notebook; little did the 16-year-old know, Tom caught most of what was written before Harry closed the notebook and locked it into the bottom of his trunk.
By the time they woke it was closer to sundown than it was to sunrise. Harry wasn’t surprised by this, the nap was quite wonderful. Draco feigned shock and irritation as he leapt up from the couch exclaiming, “Harry, I
the boy. He was sure he would find a way soon. He was now sure of how Harry felt about this war, he was afraid but confident.
Draco’s hair looked so smooth. It took too much willpower to not run his hands through it so he gave in, making his smile grow wider. Harry felt himself smile in a way that could only be compared to the one of a child at the sight of candy. Not that Harry wanted to lick Draco all over, then again, he would if asked. In a heartbeat. Probably.
Harry grinned, and his hands slid down to Draco's silky black boxers. Calloused thumbs teasing Draco on his thighs and hipbones and, finally, his hard cock. Draco was on the verge of squirming off the bed, cheeks red (a flush that spread down to his neck and chest). Harry smirked because he knew exactly what he was doing to Draco, the Slytherin in him utterly enjoyed this.
Harry's hands drag over the silk sheets as he pushes himself up. "Draco..." he murmurs. He ambles over to where Draco sat, dark, green eyes warm and amused.
Draco hissed, and then he was suddenly pinned to the wall. Harry's dark eyes were boring into Draco's. "Do you want this?" A smile graced the dark-skinned boy's face. "Do you want...Me?"
Harry’s shock at her words had to have been evident on his face. It never even occurred to him that therapy wasn’t working as well as he wanted it to. Nonetheless, he supposed Elena was right. The sessions were starting to get repetitive recently and her input today was helping him look at things in a different light but also help him be more sure of his own decisions.
“Oh is it? If either of us had to be Edward it would surely be you, you’ve got the skin colour, the intense eyes. All you’ve got to change is the hair. I could make you an appointment for a hair dye with my friend for sure.”
“I…uh… Need a carpet!” Hoping the sudden request startled the two bumbling bees long enough that Harry could run away and have only his own confusion to sort out.
It was a week before December and the Dark Lord had some killing to do- even if he had nightmares about Godric's Hollow...he had to go back. This was just the beginning of everything.
“Well you know I’m terrible at predicting the future of your relationships but more importantly, do you think you’re ready for a relationship after what Nicolas did?”
Voldemort was pleasantly surprised when Draco resisted the unforgivable curses, it meant that he was strong enough to carry out the plans Voldemort organized for Hogwarts and the students who were present for their last year [they were more important to the Dark Lord than any of the younger students], Draco had unknowingly proved himself to the Dark Lord. With Lucius gone, Voldemort thought he'd give Draco one more chance even if he did fail to kill Dumbledore and had Snape do it for him instead. The only reason the Dark Lord was being this kind was because Draco was his last hope to make either boy [Harry or Draco] to do his bidding.
“You aren’t wrong, I have been feeling like our sessions haven’t been fulfilling me as much as they used to in the beginning. And I do like the input and feedback you’ve been giving me today. I feel like I have a lot to work with, if I’m being completely honest.”
“Well, I needed to get some new cups since I broke mine last week and the last time I came here, a boy seduced me and we went to my house so there hadn’t been time to buy more,” Draco replied casually. Harry could feel some underlying irritation at him in that statement and since passive-aggressive responses weren’t his favourite responses in the world, Harry chose to follow his intuition. Pulling Draco’s arm, taking him to the side where his friend was out of earshot and for good measure, quietly put a silencing spell over their conversation.
Before Harry could ramble any longer, Elena slightly raised her hand to stop him from spiralling any longer. It was a way that worked best since interrupting Harry often left him confused as to where he was going with his own speech.
“You texted me, ‘there will be loads of shopping involved, so dress comfortable’! And to think I might have wasted my cutest pair of comfortable heels for Ikea.” Pansy griped.
“Harry! Wait up,” Draco called out, sprinting after him. Harry cursed himself for not taking better care of his health when Draco was able to catch up to him without breaking a sweat.
“Alright, I suppose. No nightmares this week.” He slightly chuckled at this, so many of his appointments surrounded his nightmares but whenever he didn’t have them, the sessions seemed more generic.
Harry was always the one to take charge, so naturally, he was on top of Draco in two seconds. Draco smirked (his plan had succeeded, as he'd known it would) as he lifted his head to deepen the kiss. The more they kissed, the more clothes came off; all through this, it was lust: passionate and desperate. With each pair of cloth that came off, Draco and Harry exchanged endearments and insults topped with even more endearments.
Creating the horcruxes had been easy- knowing that they might get destroyed one day was a little harder to deal with, which is why Voldemort kept one of his souls in his snake, Nagini. She was always close to him, making the chances of her getting killed by anything a lot more difficult.
“It isn’t about whose fault it is, just that bringing up any of those memories back up would bring about feelings I don’t want to feel right now. Can we just get on with helping him?”
Harry couldn't keep his hands-off Draco, hands shoving up Draco's shirt, grabbing at his hips, his ass, trying to get him as close as humanly possible. Draco shoved right back, pushing towards Harry, arms wrapped tightly around his neck, practically stepping on his toes as he presses towards him.
“So I went to Ikea to find inspiration as to how to design my new home and I loved it. I even helped this lovely older couple decide on a dining room layout. Now, I’m not an interior designer by any means, I don’t even see the need for a pair of hundred pound jeans, they all look the same! But I can see myself helping people with their homes and advising them on how to make their homes more functional and beautiful.”
He could make out skin, pale, but bathed in warm light. A head of messy hair (Though Harry hadn't ever seen it anything but slicked back), white-silver strands dusting across high cheekbones and soft eyebrows like starlight.
Within a few hours, Pansy had been able to convince Harry to make three important decisions: pillow type, carpet colour and the most important, growing his assorted plant collection. To cheer Draco up, Harry picked up an emerald green single sofa-chair which worked so well, Harry was convinced he could have even cheered Draco up with a cheaper item but love didn’t come cheap, unfortunately.
Draco was trapped. Either he could let Harry in and be unwontedly vulnerable with him at the worst possible time or keep the door closed for a few more minutes with the hope that Harry would eventually give up, although it didn’t seem like that was going to be the case anytime soon.
“Hi Draco! It’s been a few days - did you get busy?” She asked as she raised her eyebrows suggestively. While Julianna was a lovely person she also loved gossip and so did Draco. As a result, it wasn’t a surprise when they found themselves becoming the fastest of friends.
Harry's hand stroked at the base of Draco's cock, his mouth occupied with sucking on his head- Draco's back arched, his lips opened in a high moan, and-
Bellatrix and Lucius had insisted that the Dark Lord to go to his quarters and sleep or as they put it: 'get some rest before going to check if the mission was complete.' They did not understand that he was
Draco kissed back, letting himself get dominated for the moment, until he was hazy, blushing and panting.
my hair.” Draco scrambled a little farther from Harry as he said this, consciously patting his blond locks.
“It wasn’t a problem. I’d like to help out with your house, here’s my card call me anytime,” Pansy offered, holding out her card for Harry to take.
He admired Draco's features up close- soft pink lips that were currently pursed at him- Draco didn't like being pulled. He admired the high cheekbones and sharp jawline in front of him, fingers tracing the regal figure who simply rolled his eyes...
Draco bit his lip. It wasn’t like he hadn’t asked himself this question but with all that Harry was and the way he cared for Draco, only knowing him for a couple of hours, how could he not be ready for a relationship with this man? Who else would leave a reassuring message even when they were in a hurry?
worth all the trouble he would go through? Could he tell anyone about it or was this something he would have to keep under wraps? The Daily Prophet would have a field day with this and Harry didn’t know if he could ever be ready for that kind of magnified observation in his life again.
sleep, sleep was a sign of weakness. Nonetheless; Tom walked over to the king-sized bed which was covered in porpoise sheets with alternate grey and ivory pillows, got under the blankets, and closed his eerie red eyes soon falling into a deep slumber.
“The weather has been lovely, hasn’t it?! Ah, perfect for cycling around the lake. You know I recently moved down the corridor a few weeks back. Come over sometime, I’d love the company!”
Draco gasped audibly, “Oh that is disastrous! Do they have blond or red-haired children? Please, tell me more!”
“Let me reassure you by saying that this isn’t advice I have come up with, rather advice I’ve been given by a very wise friend of mine. ‘For every thought you have that seems irrational, but you may not be able to tell the difference between rational and irrational in the moment, find two reasons to deflect your doubts. So let’s try it now. Suppose my brain is telling me, hey you are terrible at conversation, I should find a way to reply with two reasons for why that thought isn’t true. Those reasons here would be, I am great at asking people questions and if I was bad at conversations, I wouldn’t have had a headmaster for a friend. Does that make any sense? I can’t tell.” Harry finished with a laugh.
He wondered what Harry would think of his opinion. ‘The cherub likely thought it would be wonderful getting to know his neighbours,’ Draco thought with a smile. Since he’d met Harry all he could see were the different ways he would make Draco a better person, and he couldn’t wait for when that time came.
“That sounds perfect! Let me find where this lamp is so we can be on our way.” Harry thought it would be best for Draco and Pansy to be left alone for a few minutes and so went on his way to find his new lamp.
All these clues, Draco has hoarded, and slowly, he has begun to piece together a terrible, terrible image.
Draco holds out his arm without a word, and his mother takes it. Together, they tear away, carrying the man they loved between them.
With the sun gone, the cold quickly encroaches - the last breath of winter - but the men lay comfortably, basking in their warming charms. It’s the last night of their trip, so they’ve brought out the liquor and the wine.
"I knew you wanted to do it." The blonde briefly looks back at him with one eyebrow raised and a smirk playing on his lips. "I know how competitive you are."
"Here," Arthur cuts off a pretty decently-sized chunk, and plops it onto Draco's plate. "Tell me more, I'm utterly fascinated by Muggle music - especially jazz." More eye-rolls.
"Wonderful." Arthur shakes his head while smiling. "I wish I could learn, but I've heard that, if piano is difficult, then jazz piano is even more so. Especially improvisation!"
Clenching and unclenching his hands slowly, gritting his teeth, and curling his toes, Harry manages to approach Robards without screaming.
“You’re going to do great.” She and Teddy are beaming. “Harry, do bring me back some souvenirs. I’ve always wanted to visit Austria.”
But the inside isn't too stimulating. The ceiling lights strobe the blue and purple that he saw spilling outside just moments before, there are small round tables placed here and there on the main floor, a bar runs along the far side, and the stage is front and center - but only raised a foot or two off the floor. A whole crowd of Muggles are seated already, and they contribute to the light, ambient conversation and gentle clinking of glasses.
The men thaw, too. Draco teaches them how wizardkind used to walk with dragons, and how dragonkind taught their ancestors numerology and a crude form of alchemy. How wizard tongues used to know the sounds of Draconic, but, with generations and generations of strife, the muscles have atrophied, and the knowledge lives in them no longer.
A few minutes later, he’s running down Handel Street in the middle of Muggle London, sweating under his jacket. 54 Handel Street turns out to be a small cafe nestled between a fancy-looking hotel and some unmarked corporate building. The sign in front is chipped, but the words
The woman drops his credit card and disappears under the bar, scrambling to find it again. She pops back up within a few seconds, and a lock of hair has escaped from her hijab. While tucking it back under the fabric, she asks Harry, wide-eyed, "You know him? Personally? Do you work at the orphanage?"
His voice comes out several octaves higher and more strained than Harry’s ever heard it. “I know that!”
Audrey nods at Draco. "I'm sorry we won't been able to make it this time, but I'm definitely interested." She nudges Percy and he stutters out his agreement, but it’s obviously half-hearted.
“By the end, me and Ginny weren’t even sleeping in the same bed,” Harry continues. “I-I think I knew, deep down, but didn’t want to say it. I thought I could wait it out.”
“Yes, Glyder Fawr is the forebearer of all the dragons in Snowdonia. And she has been sleeping for a millennia.”
Malfoy gets several facefuls of snow and drops to his knees while he tries to spit it all out. Harry runs up to him. Kicks down the fort. Grabs the wands. And runs.
“Okay, okay, fine.” Harry, who has just been standing in his boxers, pulls on the trousers she forced onto him. It feel surprisingly good on his body - no extra fabric around his crotch or ankles.
Defeated, Robards has no choice but to collapse in his chair in defeat. Harry watches him try to make eye contact with Edwards, but the man is still sitting in the exact same position as he was before, unmoving and staring at the table. It doesn't even look like he heard any of the exchange that just happened.
Teddy scoffs and moves one of his own knights in retaliation. “I’m just not a little kid anymore. You were at my twentieth this year!”
One-by-one, they file into the club. Harry's excited, but a little anxious - and his hands can't stop shaking. He doesn't know what to expect, not only because he has never been in a Muggle jazz club before, but also because he simply hasn't been in any sort of club in years.
Not answering immediately, Malfoy brushes back the strands of hair that had shaken loose from his usual slicked-back style. “I’ll...see. I’m only here for a week more, after all, the curriculum is tight, and I have my own research taking up all my freetime.”
It all starts when he tells Harry before he goes to work that he wants to have a serious talk after dinner that night. For the rest of the day, Harry can barely stomach any of his food, can't concentrate on work, can't muster up a smile for when Ron takes him out to lunch. The possibilities for what he wants to talk about swirl in Harry's head, but he's no fool. Neither is Ron.
He seems startled at her question. "Yes? To an extent. I am in touch with a few key members, and I attend their monthly socials every now and then - I'm part of their association, the Magicians for Muggle Music Movement," he pauses and clears his throat, "but with a disguise, of course."
Draco turns back around to face the cake. The candles burn bright, their flames, a rainbow of different colors. Now blue, now green, now red. Slowly, the wax beads, and snakes down, threatening to fall into the icing.
“A bit of spontaneity is good,” Harry says, hypocrite that he is, knowing full well that his own weekly and daily routines haven’t changed in nearly a decade.
When Harry steps out the door and kicks off, what was only a slight, playful breeze on the ground becomes a full blown windstorm high in the air. Even with all the visibility-enhancing charms on the broom and his glasses, Harry can barely see past the tip of his nose. But still Harry flies on, hunched over his broom and casting
He stops at the piano, places a hand on the side, and bows deeply to the audience. The audience reacts to this by screaming even louder. Draco picks up a microphone that Harry didn't notice was placed strategically on the piano and begins speaking. "How are you all doing tonight?" Somehow, his voice is deeper, huskier than normal.
“Dinner’s ready!” Andromeda calls, sending everyone scrambling to get to the kitchen. “Oh! Harry!” She says she Harry walks in. “I didn’t even notice you coming in. Sit down, sit down. Tonight’s your favorite! I’m trying a new recipe based on what you told me.”
Sophia coils up - which vaguely reminds Harry of baseball, the muggle sport that he vaguely remembers is a favorite of Americans - and her arm lashes out almost like a whip, sending the snowball in a painful trajectory right into the head of the fort-builder who's already endured so much at her hands already.
The Auror Office doesn’t think they’re planning any kind of widespread takeover soon, given the size of the group, but the possibility grows alongside their recruitment efforts. Ron told him over lunch the other day that, in the past month alone, they’ve acquired a few hundred members. It seems that, with each passing year, the terror felt from Voldemort’s reign slips further and further from people’s minds. Blood purity sentiments are slowly, but surely, resurfacing.
“Coming,” she calls back. A moment later, she wheels into view and stops to watch with Draco. “Right on time.” Draco hears the smile in her voice.
They only receive visitors sporadically, especially in wintertime, and not all of them are assigned to Draco, but the ones that are...There is a particular campsite that is still uninhabitable. Amira was almost impressed by the level of destruction.
They chat about name possibilities for the rest of dinner, though it seems that not much has changed since last time - when they were naming Rose. Hermione leans towards names of famous wizards, authors, and Muggle scientists, while Ron seems set on naming the child after some ancient Weasley to, as he claims, “make Mum happy.”
The blonde man simply groans underneath Harry and doesn’t open his eyes. Frantic, Harry feels around the back of Malfoy’s head for any blood or other signs that his skull might have just smashed into the ice, but finds nothing. His hair is, indeed, as soft as it looks.
Thankfully, it's not a long ride to reach their floor. The lift dings open and the voice announces, "Department of Magical Law Enforcement, incorporating the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services."
Harry can’t help imagining himself growing up here instead of with the Dursley’s; he would have had friends - siblings, almost - a caretaker, and food in his stomach. No Dudley, no Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, and no cupboards.
"Are you ready to leave now?" The blonde's better dressed than usual, which is really saying something. He's wearing a fitted, collared maroon shirt with a black overcoat, slacks, and polished shoes. His hair is coiffed and swept back in an elegant swoop gathering at the back of his head, but still allowing for some volume in the front. Harry swallows.
But he’s a fool. Hermione catches up easily and takes both his hands into her own. “Harry,” her voice catches with hesitation for a moment, “I think you need to see someone. I’m-” Harry groans. “-worried about you.”
Draco bites his lip and looks around. All is quiet, the lights in the other two cottages are off. The moon, shrouded - air, thick with anticipation.
"Well," Draco down at the table and starts tracing the pattern in the tablecloth. "It was the first time I have ever applied my research. About the magical capabilities of music. But I feel like-." He stops and takes a deep breath. "I feel like it didn't work too well."
Around the room, all the Aurors nod their heads solemnly. They all realize that the meeting has been mostly inconsequential, which means there haven't been concrete updates to the investigation. The haggard, sleep-deprived faces twist in frustration as they realize that their efforts aren't leading anywhere yet.
Just one simple noise, one finger to his lips, and Harry obeys without question. Harry doesn’t know if he can bring himself to say anything even if he wanted to.
not 2 be banned from ao3 or anything but.... ACAB, fuck c*ps, and abolish I** No I will not be taking any bad faith arguments. Google is free.
The piano is beautiful, too. Even from the back, Harry can tell how shiny the paint is, how easily it reflects the spotlight. Even the bench is nice. Harry vaguely remembers the one from the orphanage being a flat wooden one with chipping black paint, but this one looks more comfortable - the seat itself seems to be a cushion rather than just pure wood.
He shakes his leg so hard that the quills on his desk vibrate. After spending a dozen or so minutes feeling as if he isn’t quite himself, isn’t quite in his body but rather levitating out his door and out the Ministry altogether, he takes the picture frame that used to house him and his friends and tosses it facedown into his desk drawer. Watching picture-Harry shift from foot to foot and look so profoundly uncomfortable and
Malfoy doesn’t budge and instead continues to breath heavily directly into Harry’s ear - he can even feel his fluttering heartbeat where he’s pressing his chest to Harry’s back.
Draco glances at Ron, whose eyebrows haven't returned to their normal, low position on his forehead, and back at Hermione, before hugging her back. "Thank you, Ms. Rose. I appreciate your concern."
heroes here are you all - the original activists. The original organizers. Yousef, Tammie, Aria - you three laid the groundwork. You were fighting for werewolf and non-magical rights when I was in the womb-” This elicits a few laughs. “-and you were doing a damn good job of it, too. I’m just here to design the merch and plan brunch.” More laughter.
A white piano rolls into view in the next second, answering his question. Size-wise, it's bigger than the one Draco plays at the orphanage and even the one at Andromeda’s place - longer, mostly.
“Ye-yeah. I can do that.” Harry pretends to leave and make a call, but really sends a Patronus Draco’s way, wincing at what his response might be. He tries to make his message seem like everything is alright, but he can’t stop his voice from sounding panicky.
Harry wants to reply. Wants to tell him “Of course I’ll invite you again - in fact, I want to invite you every year from now on not only because I want to but also because the Weasleys would probably kill me if I don’t,” but he can’t. Because, before he knows it, he’s asleep.
“Wh-when is she going to wake up?” Thomas asks, seemingly so stunned that he forgets who he is speaking to.
Malfoy gives Harry a strange look before saying, “I don’t think I could take it.” He carefully climbs to his feet and offers a hand to Harry. “Let’s skate some more before it gets dark.”
“It probably would’ve made more sense to me if I had done the reading. I wish I had known about it earlier.”
“Yes,” Rose answers quite seriously. “You said last time that you were going to teach me how to fly!” Hermione groans; Harry had gotten Rose a toy broomstick for her fourth birthday earlier this year and she hasn’t stopped talking about it since.
The blonde turns around and only has a split-second's notice to prevent the package from smacking him full in the face, but he does it - barely. "Merlin, Harry. What is this?"
As they’re trudging through the snow-covered grounds, heading towards a suitable location, Lucas approaches Harry.
The fourth and final present seems to be a joint one from Ginny and Luna. It comes in a small box with yellow stars hand-painted on the outside; inside, it’s a smooth gray rock with flecks of white.
Suddenly, Draco, in a last-ditch effort to grab the Snitch before Harry, takes one last swipe at it, but leans too far forward. He wobbles on his broom for a gut-wrenching moment, before beginning to fall, a panicked-yelp escaping his open mouth.
Harry’s in the process of rubbing his bleary eyes and making his way to the Great Hall for breakfast when he glimpses a tall, blonde man turn the corner in front of him. He whips around to see Malfoy practically jogging down the hall with his head down.
"Greetings. It's about time you took that off. It was extremely distasteful to look at. Such a garish color." When he talks, his moustache quivers.
It's Harry's turn to laugh now, and right as he begins to, he spots a glint of gold in the distance and almost chokes.
Their thighs are touching, but the couch can easily seat another two people. When he looks over, Malfoy is immersed in the text and seems wholly unaffected by the same thoughts that insist on dominating Harry’s conscience.
At Harry's voice, Edwards spins around and draws his wand. Harry only has a split second to react, and even though it's been a while since he dueled, his reflexes are still pretty good.
She starts when she hears her name and turns. Faint recognition flickers in her features. “You’re...Draco’s friend?”
His coat is gone, his green collared shirt is untucked, and his hair is even messier than it was at the beginning of the night when Ginny purposely messed it up. Below his dark eyes lie a darker-than-usual set of bags, and his lips are cracked and dry. He moistens them, a little bit self-consciously, even though no one is there to see him anymore. Except for maybe Kreacher. But he’s seen him at his worst anyways, and is probably used to it.
The cord wraps them both up, now - a hot wire. And it still sings. When Draco presses close, he hears it, rising from Harry’s skin.
The house is too quiet. Now that Kreacher isn't preparing food any longer, Harry doesn't even have the ambient noise from the kitchen to vaguely keep track of time. His perceptions seem altered, unstable, and Harry feels his stomach slowly tie into knots as his heartbeats beat by.
True to his word, once the last of the dishes are cleaned and stowed away, Harry dashes into their bedroom and comes out with a box - simply wrapped, with a poor attempt at a ribbon bow on top. He holds it out to Draco. Draco takes it.
Harry Potter feels nothing. Because he wills himself not to. But still, mutinous tears stream down his cheeks and every sob brings him lower and lower, smaller and smaller, until he’s curled up on the couch.
And even though he must be tired from the straight two hours that he's been performing, he still doesn't lose his composure in the face of everyone begging for his attention. He gives them what they want - picture, autograph, hug - without ever letting the smile slip from his face.
Harry waves goodbye to Molly and Arthur and proceeds to lead the remaining group to meet up with Draco. Something akin to a line has formed, directed by what seems to be the same person who rolled the piano onto the stage, and Harry and the rest of his friends stand in the very back.
“...I’ll send you an owl. Later.” He raises his eyebrows and jerks his head. Harry takes the hint and leaves quickly, and the crowd of reporters promptly swarm back around Robards, and their group shouting match begins again.
Longbottom manages a nod. “I’ll go let the others know, then.” He starts back towards the entrance, and, after a brief, hushed conversation with Harry, they two of them leave and go toward the argument outside that hasn’t subsided in the slightest.
Intrigued, Harry obeys. As soon as his fingers make contact with the unassuming little rock, he’s reminded of happy moments in his life - looking out the window of the Hogwarts Express and admiring the view of the countryside, late night study sessions with Ron and Hermione, kissing Ginny after they were married, holding Rose for the first time, taking Teddy to a Muggle amusement park, ice skating with Draco…
“Sorry to bother you.” It’s his supervisor, Amira Felding, robes still as neat as Draco had seen it that morning. “There’s been a changeup. The tour group tomorrow changed their plan to a camping trip last minute. Walker can’t do it - her knee - so it will have to be you.”
Voices float in from the outside - raised voices. Draco is certain the one yelling the most is Weasley, though the individual words cannot breach the walls.
look like she was the one who was raised by Muggles. Ginny’s ready already - dressed in a full black tuxedo with a blue-green - or “turquoise” as Ginny would call it - vest and a matching bowtie while sporting an impressive, slicked back mane of red hair. Her date for the night, Luna, is adhering to a couple-coordinated color scheme; she’s currently seated at the window seat and looking out the window in a form-hugging blue-green (turquoise!) dress with her long blonde hair styled in a high ponytail.
“Please.” Hagrid pours. “How’s Madame Maxime?” There’s a clink and a splash as Hagrid’s hand falters, the tea landing outside the cup.
Following the address written for Harry, the group find a nearby apparition point and walk the rest of the way to the club. The street it's located on - Ravel Avenue - seems to be a hub for music clubs of all kinds - jazz, blues, and some others that Harry doesn't recognize or remember ever hearing about. It's a niche place for sure, and most likely even more so for the Wizarding community. Harry wonders how Draco learned about it.
“I di-did this...I did th-this…” Draco begins to repeat the phrase over and over again as he cries. Harry says nothing. Harry has nothing to say.
It’s a simple space, Draco knows it. Not much decoration, and only the bare minimum of furniture: a loveseat, a coffee table, a dining table, and two chairs. In their shared bedroom stand two queen beds, separated by a nightstand. They face a large bureau, which Draco supposes they will have to share, and the far wall opens to the back deck, where two metal chairs stand, overlooking the communal vegetable garden.
Harry splutters, “I have! Of course I have. I just-” Harry has to break eye contact with Malfoy; he’d forgotten since Hogwarts how intense his eyes could get. “-was surprised, that’s all. I didn’t know you liked music.”
“I empathize. But hopefully this will be a distraction for both of us.” Now that Harry looks closely, he realizes that Draco isn’t doing that much better than he is. The bags under his eyes look darker than they were at Christmas, making his eyes look sunken into his face.
Harry flicks his wand, and a wordless spell yanks his bags from his car like on a string. They step inside the cabin.
“Oh, uh, yes. Please. One coffee, extra cream.” Harry hands her a few bills he finds stuffed in his back pocket.
The orphanage itself seems to be a repurposed house, complete with faded marks where furniture or picture frames used to exist. Normally, the house would be too cramped to hold this many children, but the lack of proper furniture allows for more room. It seems the main expenses in the orphanage are, from the look of the enormous fridge and the toys scattered everywhere: food and toys.
With a few minutes to spare, Harry apparates over and runs down Ravel Avenue toward The Amber Tap. He quickly realizes that he should have lined up earlier.
The snow is freshly fallen here, unbroken and thick. Little vegetation. Far from anything that could be broken. In other words, the perfect snowball fight battleground.
Harry whips his head around to look and sure enough, the one remaining offensive member of the other team - Lucas - has gathered up their bundle of wands and is sprinting for his life back across the field. Their fort has collapsed in on itself, and under its crumbled structure lie both what looks to be Gordon and Robin. Stella is also covered in snow, but she's not out yet - trying to scramble to her feet while making snowballs at the same time.
But now that it's the next day, the prospect of facing the entire Weasley family plus their spouses and children during Christmas is daunting, even for Harry, who's known them for most of his life. He can't even imagine what Malfoy must be feeling right now.
Malfoy relinquishes his hold on Harry’s stomach, and he immediately misses the warmth. Now that he’s on the ice - which seems to be Malfoy’s greatest challenge - Malfoy has little problem skating on his own. He only seems rusty at the most. “Thanks.” Is it Harry’s overactive imagination, or do Malfoy’s cheeks look too red to be attributed to just the cold?
But now, when he looks around, he sees through Harry’s eyes: the rock paths worn smooth by both ancient and modern feet, the grass and brush and forests cultivated by unknown hands. The mountains that used to take to the sky. The river down below, and how it ebbs and flows even over the span of a week.
Something rises in Draco, then, as it often did these days. A rushing, daring feeling that only came when Harry was around.
And Harry suspects that Draco would've happily taught late into the night, had Arthur not poked his head out of the door and called them in: "Food's ready!"
Harry takes Draco’s hands, which are trembling, and says, “That’s...understandable. Family can be illogical, sometimes.”
of water on grass, water on rock, water on the snaking rivers. In the summer, Draco sits on the hillsides and lets the world crowd in.
“I talked with this young gentleman and this lovely lady during intermission,” she says, gesturing to Harry and Hermione - not with a point of a finger, but with a wave of her hand.
Hours of light banter with Ginny, Luna, Hermione, and Ron and impromptu and highly unorganized flying lessons later, Harry's trying to get ready for Draco's performance. Keyword: trying.
Arthur, Molly, Ginny, and Luna end up going to use the restroom while Ron gets more drinks for them. When it's just Harry and Hermione at the table, a tall woman approaches their table.
On the opposite wall, the bar seems to be closed and Ava, the bartender is nowhere to be found. Harry wonders why for a second before immediately spotting a group of children seated a table near the front. The orphans. Pat is sitting with them, chatting and looking after them. Ava is talking to Dan with a wide smile on her face. Draco isn't with them, but Harry assumes he's busy preparing backstage.
Stella and Sophia immediately dash not forward, but sideways in opposite directions. From the corner of his eye, Harry spots Gordon and Robin disappearing behind him to begin the fort.
When he opens it, she flies in and perches on his shoulder. He unties the piece of parchment attached to her leg and it reads:
He thinks to himself furiously, dumping the scrolls onto the coffee table. What sound like cups clinking, a murmured
They reach the cafe from before, and a glance inside tells Harry that it’s just as quiet and empty as before. The barista notices them and gives them a slight wave.
"Yes, please." Harry sits up, takes the tray, and places it in his lap. The food smells good; Kreacher's baking has always been a point of pride for him, and anyone who tries his wares immediately knows why.
He opens his mouth. “I don’t know why Snape and Dumbledore and your aunt and uncle did those things to you. If I did, I would tell you. I promise you I would.” Draco closes his eyes. “But I do know that Snape and Dumbledore had to carry the consequences with them for the rest of their lives, and your aunt and uncle will have to do the same.”
Harry doesn’t respond verbally, just waves his hand at them. The door closes, a minute passes, and Harry hears the roar of the fire as they Floo away. But Harry doesn’t leave the bathroom yet, just faces the mirror and regards his reflection.
Malfoy takes in a deep breath and puffs out his chest, perhaps in an effort to make himself look less like a man who just sprinted through the halls of a castle to make breakfast. Harry makes no such effort and simply steps forward and opens the door.
Adore, as it turns out, is an extremely upscale Muggle French restaurant complete with real plants hanging from the rafters, tables lit by candles, and unlimited, fresh baguettes.
“We’re gay. I mean I’m gay. Technically bisexual. Fuck. I shouldn’t have outed her-” Harry’s mouth snaps shut when he sees the expression on Draco Malfoy’s face.
Both of them had woken up late for breakfast. They dash down the halls of the castle, passing the rows of portraits peering curiously at them from their frames. The mid-morning sun shines through the windows and cast long shadows in vaguely Harry and Malfoy-esque shapes on the walls.
He wakes Harry, his body is still warm with sleep. Wordlessly, they get ready; Draco pulls their clothes out of the dryer, passes them over. Harry takes them, mumbles something, and ducks out of the cottage to return to his own.
” Hermione stresses every single syllable and her voice rises an octave, “You’ve broken our trust before! It happened just like this last time too - you drew more and more into yourself and pushed all of us out when you were really suffering! I had half a mind to take you to St. Mungo’s right then and there that day!”
“You alright, mate?” A hand waves in Harry’s face, and he snaps out of a daze and blinks his eyes and realizes that he’s no longer at the club. He’s in a bathroom. Specifically, he’s in
It takes some time - time that Draco fears they don’t have - but he does it. Eventually, it’s just him in the center of the crater, eggs as big as his torso scattered at his feet, and everything he should need beside him.
Draco remembers learning about hibernation as a child, from his mother at bedtime. He remembers asking:
Without any hesitation, Malfoy gives them the same gentle smile that Harry saw yesterday at the orphanage.
The conversation can easily end there, but something in Harry is encouraging him to press further, to find out more. “And once you find something…” He trails off, expecting Malfoy to jump in, but he doesn’t.
“See? It’s nice, isn’t it?” Malfoy’s breath comes from him in puffs of steam. When Harry looks over, he can see each individual snowflake that has gathered on Malfoy’s eyelashes.
But now, nearly two hours later, it’s 6:35PM and Harry still has a whole section to go. Or maybe several. It isn’t his fault that he’s unused to working on Fridays. Or working much at all, for that matter.
“Jenny, I appreciate your opinion on the matter.” She nods in acknowledgement. “But unfortunately, since the Second War, relations between the British Prime Minister and the Ministry have been...fraught. And even through the years, they haven’t recovered much. Some of you probably already know this.” Harry and Ron make eye contact. The only reason they know is because Kingsley accidently let it slip after one too many drinks at an Order of the Phoenix reunion once. Apart from them, the only ones in the room with recognition in their eyes are Jenny, Robards, and another senior Auror - who happens to be Jenny’s partner - Ash.
Draco suddenly shoots up so he’s sitting, turns, and waves at the Weasleys. "I'm alright!" The children, who had been looking on worryingly, some even closing their eyes in terror, smile and cheer in relief. "Help me up?" Draco mutters to Harry, and the latter obliges.
They get settled. If Harry notices the vial still standing on the nightstand, he doesn’t comment, and Draco relaxes a little bit.
Draco waves his hand. "No problem at all. I'm there every night of the week, so you could just stop by anytime you'd like. The one tomorrow is just the Christmas special."
, Harry thinks as he straightens some mistletoe hanging in the arched hallway entrance. He's spent nearly the entire day in this portion of the castle now, and the sun is setting, turning the hallway orange.
Harry and Ron bristle in their seats at this, both of them ready to open their mouths and speak, but Jenny says it all for them, and less aggressively, too: "Why is that? From the neo-Death Eater and frankly, from the original Death Eater threat that I've seen and that most of us here has lived through, it seems pretty clear that the danger isn't toward the Wizarding community. Wouldn't it make more sense to warn the possible victims so they can actually take precautions?"
That couldn't be farther from the truth; Harry's still almost breathing too heavily to be able to speak, and he can already tell where his muscles will be aching tomorrow.
” White sparks fly out of Harry’s wand and arrange themselves into ‘6:33 PM’ in the air. After a moment, they melt away.
"But it's not a bad effect, right?" It doesn't seem to be, at least. Harry feels pretty good at the moment - but not in an addicting, enchanted way that makes him want to listen to the music forever or something like that. No, it feels gentle and non-malicious - like a blanket warmed by a loved one's body heat, or a spot on the rug close to the fire.
“Draco…” Belle and Ava and Pat have already given Harry the rundown of how to deal with Draco when he gets like this - so focused on his work that he forgets to eat, to sleep, and to talk to anyone. The key is that Harry needs to be firm.
Waiting a bit before answering, Malfoy turns his head slightly to regard Harry out of the corner of his eye. Harry shivers. “It’s a Clementi Sonatina. And it’s a
His brain taunts him by bring back the fantasies he used to have when he was still dating Ginny, or even when he was hunting Horcruxes. A big family. Ginny by his side. Their children would be friends with Rose, of course. They’d all meet at the Burrow for Christmas and the children would play together with their presents while the adults would chat and drink in their new sweaters.
"You must have quite a talent for it, especially since they hired you. What's the name of the club? I'd love to come and watch you sometime."
Harry rolls his eyes. She's right that Ava is extremely attractive - sporting a somehow aristocratic and commanding face - but if Ginny knew the real reason he was talking to her, he would never hear the end of it.
Steeling himself, Harry throws himself out of bed and stalks over to his window. His barn owl, affectionately known as Spotty, blinks her eyes at him in confusion.
Summer in Snowdonia is green, lush as this far north can allow. The skies are light and the dragons play in the clouds up high, their tails whipping and wings snapping. The ravens make their nests in the birch forests, and the otters build their homes on the tributaries. When it rains, the foxes go to their holes and the wild owls burrow into their hollows, and the only sound across the valley and mountain sides is the
“I’ve been shopping!” Harry said holding up the bag. The look that crossed Draco’s face was one he’d never forget, a mixture of both arousal and curiosity.
“You’ll love the Weasley’s I promise you. The Burrow is always crowded and busy but smells amazing and is full of my favourite people. I’m not saying it will be easy, Draco.” Harry warned, “but hell we overcome a megalomaniac wanting to take over our world as children, dealing with our families should be easy after that - right?” Draco’s snort of laughter echoed around the room.
He had felt a stab of envy when Ginny had shown no hesitation in hugging Harry when he had arrived. Draco would have rather liked to have done the same thing, hug Harry Potter. Lost in his thoughts he jumped slightly as Harry put a mug of hot, black tea on the coffee table in front of him.
The next morning Draco woke to a cold empty bed, light spilling into the room from the window. Rolling over puzzled, he glared at the open bathroom door. Harry would normally tell him if he’d been called into work overnight, but he had clearly been out of bed for a while, his side was icy. Grumbling about missing husband’s, Draco climbed out of bed, pulling on his pyjamas and walking out into the flat.
“I’m not a girl, Potter,” Draco mock grumbled, but secretly he was thrilled. Harry had bought him roses the first time he’d arrived at the Manor to collect him for their first date. Six years later, and he still regularly bought his husband flowers.
“What about the girls, or boys, who want to date your sons?” Draco asked, the bottle was just about finished and they were both well and truly feeling the effects, no way they would be having such a personal conversation otherwise.
In contrast to previous years, the Great Hall is surprisingly full. It looks as if almost a fourth of the school had elected to stay, when only a handful did last year. Very few are sitting segregated by House. A mixed group of Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors, and Ravenclaws are playing what looks to be a very tense game of Exploding Snap at the end of the Hufflepuff table.
Robards jumps in eagerly, his voice powerful and confident, "Since he escaped - which we know occurred yesterday night sometime between 9 PM and 2 AM - we've gotten several reports from our field agents posted in the at popular neo-Death Eater hangouts that their group has not only doubled in membership in a week, but is currently on the move. Several of the members have stayed in their safe houses but most of the top brass have escaped from our detection. We don't know what exactly they're planning, but we know it's coming soon. And we need to prepare. And to find Jack Willows and all of his friends."
The group is quiet as they begin the hike, which leaves Draco no other choice but to fill up the empty space by himself. He introduces the Refuge to them, their history, their mission:
Never once, in all the years that Harry's been working with the Auror's, has Kingsley ever called a meeting after hours. Harry knows that he should be worried or even excited at the prospect of some potentially breakthrough update to the Death Eater situation, but instead dread sits in his stomach, making him want to eject all of the food that Draco just treated him to. Pity, he decides as he patiently waits for the elevator to deliver him to the correct floor, is probably what spurred Kingsley to call for him. Maybe he thought Harry would feel jealous if he weren't invited to the meeting. Why else would he call in someone who is wholly un-involved in the entire investigation?
But then he realizes that he actually has to walk outside if he gets one and promptly drops the idea.
“Oh, I know you’re all male,” Harry reached down and cupped Draco through his pants “But I think you’d look hot in the soft, sheer silky knickers. They’d be nice and loose, and I could probably just push them to the side and slide right into you. Oh, you like that idea, don’t you?” Harry couldn’t keep the smirk from his voice as Draco’s cock twitched under his hand. Draco couldn’t do more than nod, just the thought of it was turning him on more than he wanted to admit. They’d not played around with clothing, yet.
and stepped into the dim interior. A voice called from a back that they’d be with him shortly and to have a look around, so Draco did as he was bid and slowly started to inspect the various owls on display.
“Now we will meet back here on Christmas eve. Everyone will bring their dish and present. The minimum amount is ten galleons.” Molly explained. With the size of the Weasley clan, these days Christmas was a well-planned exercise. Draco had a month to come up with the perfect present.
“I don’t care who my kids date or marry, so long as they are loved and treated well. I can hardly be a hypocrite and tell them no, now can I? I’ve hardly put myself out there since the divorce. Hermione nags me about it, but hell, dating is hard enough at the best of times, add my past into the mix and the
“Oi!” Harry broke into Draco’s musings “You were offering!” he said nodding to where he was stroking his cock and grinning up at Draco with a look of pure mischief on his face.
“Yes, Daphne and I opened it a few years ago. We spent some time in France, and we both always loved fashion. The undergarments are as important as clothing.” Harry couldn’t help but think that sounded somewhat like a well-rehearsed sales pitch, but he nodded in agreement.
“No, not really.” The light puff of breath on the back of Draco’s neck made him shudder in pleasure and the dark, wickedness Harry’s voice promised.
“I envied you too,” Draco whispered, not wanting to break the quiet. “You succeeded at everything you did, had good secure friends you could rely on.” ‘
’ Draco wondered before his brain turned to mush. Eventually, the men had to pull apart due to a lack of oxygen. Harry ran his finger over Draco’s swollen lips and gave him a wicked grin.
“I love you,” Draco whispered in his ear, making Harry shudder at his possessive tone. “I’m not going to last much longer though,” Draco admitted, he could feel his balls tightening, he knew that telltale tingle, “Fuck Harry going to come.” With that, he exploded and filled his boyfriend’s willing body.
He pulled open the door to a tingle of the overhead bell and stared in amazement at the array of colour.
“Yes, thanks.” Unable to keep still, Harry finished his tea and walked over to the window, staring out into the white nothingness. The blizzard had set in and he could only see a foot or so through the glass. Lost in his own thoughts Harry had no idea the picture he presented to the man sitting behind him.
“We were a bit worried about your reaction. We were rather drunk at the time.” Fred admitted, grinning.
“So… what is it?” Harry asked, not taking his eyes off that box. Draco picked it up and shook it, but he couldn’t hear anything. Tugging on the red ribbon, it unravelled, and he pulled the lid off, dropping it on the bed. It was full of black tissue paper, peeling it back until it revealed sheer red fabric. Tugging it out of the box, they both gasped. It was a pair of sheer bright red silk French knickers.
Picking up the slightly more substantial package Draco also carefully unwrapped it to reveal the black satin knickers and the suspender belt, the satin was so soft, he could imagine wearing it. Holding up the suspender belt, he hoped he didn’t look as confused as he felt. It was a somewhat confusing array of straps.  Harry took it from him with a light laugh.
“Happy Valentine’s Day, Harry,” Draco sat on the coffee table in front of Harry and put the box into his hands, feeling like Luna’s nargles had taken flight in his stomach. “You can open your eyes now.”
“Need some help with that Potter?” Boldly looking down at Harry’s hardening cock, Draco smirked and quirked an eyebrow at Harry. Those unsightly clothes that Harry usually wore, clearly his fashion sense had not improved since school, hid a gorgeous body. Harry was all toned, solid muscles. He’d shot up since school too, they both had, but Draco had never expected this.
That month was the busiest he could remember at St Mungo’s, so he found himself shopping on Christmas Eve. Something his prat of a boyfriend was still gloating over. Nothing seemed right, and as the “rules” stated it had to be opened in front of everyone, Draco didn’t want to appear to be showing off. He settled on a new watch and some green cufflinks.
Three hours later, saw them back at the top of the mountain hungrily tearing into the lunches Hermione and Ginny had packed for them. Sandwiches, fruit and mugs of hot chocolate. No-one cared about standing up to eat, the view making it more than worthwhile. Of course, the conversation soon turned to the various runs the men wanted to try. Naturally, it was the black and double black runs they were challenging each other to attempt.
Dinner was much like any other, they sat and discussed their week, offered solutions to problems and the like. Not that Harry was anywhere as skilled at potions as what Draco was but sometimes it was the little things that changed the way he was working on a problem. Right now, he was trying to come up with an antidote to dragon pox. It had nearly been eradicated but Draco was part of a team to clear it up once and for all.
“Less talk, more action, Potter!” Draco grumbled as they reached the bed and he forcefully shoved Harry down onto it so he fell in a sprawled heap across the mattress. Taking full advantage of the situation Draco dragged his socks off, grateful Harry had taken his snow boots off earlier and attacked his clothes until Harry lay there in just his red boxers, a cheeky grin and nothing else.
“Hey Gin, Blaise, thanks for the invite,” he said as he shook Blaise’s hand. Harry had been sure he would not like Ginny’s fiancé but surprisingly enough, they got on well.
“In tight leather pants!” George added, and Harry’s face flushed at the provocative image that popped into mind. His friends immediately picked up on it, and the teasing was ramped up higher.
The last few years had been hard. Professionally, Draco was at the top of his profession, he was often asked to consult on various cases at other Wizarding hospitals. He was developing a range of potions to help cure Dragon-Pox among other things.  Personally, his life was a mess. Divorced, part-time father to a son he hardly knew and trying to manoeuvre his way around the adult dating scene which was not working out at all.
Inadvertently they had started their own new tradition, sitting in the bath on Christmas night, drinking hot chocolate and chatting about the day.
At first, Harry couldn’t pinpoint the sound of the noise, as the room was quiet again but then he heard it, a low growl coming from the Christmas tree. Stepping further into the room Harry gasped as he located the reason for all the noise.
Even though Harry hadn’t had much to do with the Greengrass girls in school, he found himself quite liking Astoria. Not many women would take this situation quite so well.
“You alright there Malfoy?” Harry asked, the amusement in his voice evident as he slid all the way down to their mutual moans of pleasure. Draco was bigger than his other lovers, the stretch enough to make Harry gasp at the sting but it was not enough to make him regret this. He’d have to thank Ron, Hermione and Blaise when he saw them next.
“I’m not interested in anyone else, Potter, well not anyone who could give Scorpius siblings.” Before Harry could argue again Draco got to his feet, “I hope there is a loo in this place,” putting his glass down he walked off, clearly to avoid the topic but Harry’s old habit of finding out what Draco Malfoy was hiding was far too entrenched to let the matter go. He waited patiently for the other man to reappear.
Harry loved giving head, love the sensation of making someone lose control under his teasing. Besides the actual fucking it was his favourite thing to do and the fact that Draco was tied up and couldn’t touch just added that extra spice. Harry had been accused of being a kinky fucker in the past and it was not something he could deny.
“If you wake Draco you’re going to be in trouble!” Harry told the little owl as he pulled back his cage cover. The sight that greeted him broke his heart. He was sitting on the bottom of the cage, sad little eyes looking up at Harry and sad, soft little hoots.
fondness for reporting on every time I have a bloody piss and it’s no wonder, I just don’t bother with dating at all.”
“Tell Mademoiselle we sent you; it's rather… high end.” Fred told Harry as he wrapped his scarf around his neck again and pulled on his coat, waving to the twins. He set off down the street to the apparition point.
Draco couldn’t help thinking fondly as, without warning, he knocked Harry’s hand out of the way and engulfed half of his length, to Harry’s started gasp of pleasure. There had only ever been two men who had been able to swallow all of Harry’s length, neither he’d ever been able to tell Ron about. Even though he’d taken Ginny’s virginity, Charlie Weasley had taken his on a hot, drunken night in Romania.
“Thanks, Patricia, I brought his dinner, figured he’s not stopped to eat?” her grin indicated he was correct. Harry was not surprised. They were having a nice chat when Draco arrived at the medi-witch station. He looked exhausted but gave Harry a small smile.
“Well, I’m not saying no, if you’re offering!” Harry smirked, stroking himself, making his cock jerk to his touch.  Not saying a word, Draco grabbed him, he’d tease Harry later about his very girlish squawk, and pushed him onto his back on the bed. Sprawled in naked abandon against dark blue sheets, Draco was hit with a bolt of lust. It was probably a good idea that they’d not hooked up in school, Draco had no doubt his grades would have suffered terribly. Unable to contain his smirk, he could just imagine telling old Lucius the reason his grades were slipping.
“Fuck Harry,” Draco gasped as Harry gripped his hips and dragged him closer, slipping in that last little bit until Draco could feel how close Harry was to him, balls deep in his arse and at that perfect angle that each thrust dragged the head of Harry’s cock over Draco’s prostate to his gasps and moans of pure pleasure.
“I’d say turnabout is fair play, however, I spend as little time with my parents as I possibly can.” He admitted, snuggling closer to Harry. “The constant disappointment is just too much. I often think they would have preferred me to be trapped in a miserable marriage than dare to divorce.”
” over breakfast, seems they are both rivals for first place in Potions, where on earth Albus gets that from is totally beyond me. Besides the year I was using Snape’s book I was rubbish, it was my worst subject. Still, I think a lot of that had to do with the teacher, he damn well terrified me.”
“I see you made it, mate,” Ron grinned as he put his arm around Hermione’s shoulder, tucking her protectively against his side.
“I always liked Fred and George, their pranks and clever ideas,” Draco admitted. He had never told anyone that he admired the Weasley twins. To be honest, he envied all of them, more than anything else he would have loved a sibling but it seemed that the Malfoy’s were destined to only have one child each generation.
“Fuck me please,” Draco couldn’t keep the whine out of his voice, and honestly, he didn’t care. He could not remember ever being this horny. The rope he was gripping was rough under his fingers, but the silk knickers were so soft. His cock was hard and leaking, but the plug up his arse kept him right on edge. It was both highly arousing and damn frustrating. He needed Harry in him now.
“A heads up that Malfoy was going to be here this weekend would have been appreciated though, Gin!” Harry lightly scolded only to receive a cheeky grin. Even though they all got on far better now than when they were children, and he was Blaise’s best friend, who was engaged to his ex-wife, Harry still wasn’t sure if he put Malfoy himself the “
Cheeky bastard Draco thought fondly as he straddled Harry’s lap, quickly pinning his arms to the back of the lounge as he leaned in and lazily kissing him, taking his time, making Harry whimper in both pleasure and frustration. Harry had changed a lot from the skinny, underfed boy from school, and had turned into a gorgeous man who had a kinky streak a mile wide. They had an active and varied sex life, and Draco loved it, loved this sexy man underneath him.
The kids were so excited, and Arthur didn’t help, he was telling them stories of ghosts and goblins. The older kids were trying to be unimpressed, but Harry knew they were. Arthur was a great storyteller. By ten o’clock all the kids were in bed, and the adults were heading off too.
“You’re overdressed Malfoy, strip!” Harry ordered in his Head Auror voice that normally had people jumping to obey. It was completely lost on Draco though, who even though he did start disrobing it was at a much slower pace as to what he had stripped Harry.
“Merlin Harry you startled me,” Draco tried to hide the knickers, but it was too late, Harry had seen them.
It was remarkably comfortable, small, but warm and dry, which was all either man cared about right now. After being out in the elements, frostbite and hypothermia were both very real concerns. Pulling his wand, Draco started a fire in the fireplace as Harry looked through the small kitchen. Plenty of tinned provisions and thank Merlin there was a kettle.
“No, I’ll give it a while, wait for his personality to come through,” Harry said, walking into the kitchen, the owl perched on his forearm. Draco smirked, satisfied at how well he knew his husband, and slid a few pieces from the chopping board onto a plate. Draco watched amused as Harry tried to teach the owl which vegetables were good for him. Carrots, apparently, were not acceptable, but snow peas were alright. It didn’t take long until their new companion had figured out which ones he liked, even if Harry kept trying to give him the others.
“What are you doing in my room, Potter?” Draco asked sleepily, “You didn’t come clubbing with Blaise and me.” sitting up, Draco rubbed his eyes and looked around the bedroom. “This is not my room.”
“I’d say it is a rescue lodge or similar but it’s fancier than most, maybe someone’s winter hideaway?” Draco sipped his tea. “They aren’t normally so… comfortable?” or normally have just one large comfortable bed he thought to himself.
“Albert Einstein was a squib, he contributed heavily to Arithmancy," Harry informed him loftily, “He was a very smart man, and so is my owl.”
He had never seen anything as gorgeous as the sight of Draco Malfoy shamelessly enjoying his lovemaking, no his fucking, Harry corrected himself. This wasn’t love, it was just pure lust, that was all.
They sat and discussed their day, as they always did, but with added chirps and hoots to their conversation. It was rather relaxing listening to him and as the meal wound down, Harry stole some leftover steak from Draco’s plate and cut it into smaller pieces, carrying it over to the owl.
“I bought you something too,” Draco admitted, arranging the final rose to his satisfaction and moving the vase to the side table where they wouldn’t get knocked over.
Creeping downstairs, avoiding the creaking tread on the third last step, he crept into the kitchen to find it empty, as was the dining room. A low moan caught Harry’s attention, and he crept towards the front room. Pushing the door open, he muttered nox, distinguishing his wand. Harry knew he knew he would not need it, not with the number of lights that decorated the Christmas tree.
“Well, well, well,” Harry smirked as Draco glared at him “Looks like I must have been a good boy last year," Harry dropped to his knees and plucked the Christmas tag off Draco’s chest “
Shutting off the water, he dried off and pulled on a pair of flannelette pants and a t-shirt, grinning at how much Harry had rubbed off on him. He’d hated to admit his boyfriend was right. This was much more comfortable than his silk pyjamas, and he could steal Harry’s clothes too.
“Look!” he pointed through the trees to a small cabin that was just visible through the snow. It wasn’t very large but it would at least protect them from the rapidly worsening blizzard outside, so they wearily trudged towards it. With a quick
“Just give him a chance, he’s a friendly little guy, just has some growing up to do.” Harry looked down at the little bird again who hooted again, a little louder this time. Glaring at his husband again, Harry reached into the box and the little bird jumped up onto his hand, chirping as Harry lifted him out.
Afterwards, the group of men quickly make their excuses and retire early: Thomas and Finnigan into the left cottage, and Longbottom and Weasley into the right. Only Harry remains.
"Yes, I know, I know," Robards snaps, irritated. Harry suspects he's more angry that Edwards got snot on his robes on the way over than anything else. "Stay on topic."
Draco stands so quickly the chair topples over. The glass vial in his pocket weighs like stones. When he speaks, he only manages a whisper: “That’s quite enough. I must ask you to leave now, Potter, so we both may get some sleep.”
Draco Malfoy has always been inclined towards brooding. In the half-dark, flame in his face, he sits by the fireplace in a swirl of his own thoughts. Sometimes with wine in hand, catching red in the light. Other times with nothing.
"No," Harry glances back at his group and catches Hermione's eye, which gives him a wink, "It's okay. Do you want to sit down somewhere?"
It’s bright and loud here. Both natural sunlight and the lights in the shop illuminate the surface, and Harry can hear the ambient noises of the coffeeshop through one ear and the busy London street through the other. It’s a strange pick for Malfoy, Harry feels. Not one that Harry would have guessed or even chosen for himself, but it’s still nice.
Around dinnertime, the students file out, stomachs rumbling, leaving just Harry and Malfoy alone in the living room together.
When the picture frame is mostly dust-free, Harry puts it back down on his desk and picks up the folder laying on top of dozens of unfinished reports. He peels back the front flap and the escaped Neo-Death Eater, Jack Willows, stares up at him with his dull blue eyes. Harry inspects his file with a small spark of interest, but quickly finds after thumbing through his information for a few seconds that there's nothing too interesting to be found.
He could play this game. Draco fancies he could even play it well. And they were on his home turf, now. He hoists his pack higher on his back. “Good. Follow me.”
Work, surprisingly, is as much as a reprieve as it is a nightmare. On one hand, it gets Harry out of his bed only because he couldn't stand to see Kingsley's or Ron's or Hermione's disappointed faces if he stopped going for good. On the other hand, it and the people there are a constant reminder of the orphanage. Of the Death Eaters. Of Draco.
“Perfect.” He announces before marching back to his desk and gathering up his belongings. “You’ll have to help me, then.”
“Though we oversee twenty adult dragons in Snowdonia, a brood this plentiful only comes once a decade. The eggs themselves take up to two years to hatch, and once they do, the Wyrmlings inside reach adolescence after fifty years, and adulthood fifty years after that.”
The wind grows warm, and the days lengthen, and before Draco properly stops to take it in, spring passes into summer. The tour groups come - families and couples fleeing the cobblestoned Wizarding world. Draco takes them up and down the mountains. He leads them wading through the rapids, and he shows them the best, shadowy respites from the beating sun.
“Draco!” The sound of shifting sand, the rustling of clothes. A thump at Draco’s head. Harry Potter leans over him, his eyes like morning rays. “Draco, you did it!” He exclaims.
"Go!" Sophia yells as she scoops up an armful of more snow and begins sprinting toward the opposing team’s half-finished fort, giving Malfoy a wide berth.
“Nothing,” Harry responds as he watches the snow fall gently from the window. It’s looking to be a very white Christmas this year, as the snow from the storms the past week haven’t even gotten close to clearing up yet.
Potter,” Malfoy snaps in between labored breaths. They’re both a bit breathless after the two flights of stairs they practically flew down.
Draco looks at Harry with a fondness in his eyes so intense that Harry thinks he might just break in half. Wordlessly, they gather each other into their arms and don’t let go.
“I shouldn’t have pushed you out. You didn’t deserve that. You’re my friend, and I care about you. I did something awful.”
And a few minutes of walking through the Ministry, ducking his head whenever anyone passes by to avoid conversation, Harry’s settled in his office chair again, in his empty cubicle. His desk is just as messy as he left it when he dashed off to dinner at Andromeda’s the Friday before last.
Only after Harry’s taken a shower, brushed his teeth, and climbed into bed does he think about Malfoy again. He remembers how he treated him - and now, hours later, Harry no longer understands why he reacted so violently. It was
Harry Potter wakes up covered in sweat. He tries to use a hand to wipe some of it away from his face, or at least get his matted, greasy hair off his forehead, but his entire right arm has gone numb. In fact, his entire right arm is currently in use. By Draco.
A blonde eyebrow lifts and the hint of a smile play on his lips. “Are you sure? Don’t you have something better to be doing with your time?”
Robards, who has been silently sulking behind Kingsley this whole time, adjourns the meeting, "That's all we have for you this morning. Remember, stay focused and report anything - and I mean anything - suspicious directly to me. Don't wait. We need to get them before they do real damage, got it?"
Harry would think that stage lights would make Draco look even paler, more gaunt, but it's doing quite the opposite. The light gives him a healthy glow; it dances on his high, prominent cheekbones, slides down the bridge of his nose, and graces the hint of collarbone peeking out of the window formed by the unbuttoned top buttons of his black collared shirt underneath his suit jacket. When Draco beams at the ocean of faces - his audience - he almost literally glows. It could be a subtle magical effect, and Harry doesn't doubt that it's well within Draco's magical capabilities, but Harry doubts it for some reason. It seems real. Natural. Harry can't explain it.
Harry kisses him - the press of their lips hot and passionate. "Yes," he breathes before kissing him again. "Yes, I agree. I want that. I want you, Draco."
Though the sun has long set at this point, when Harry apparates to the scene, he has to momentarily shield his eyes from the sudden influx of light. Fire. The building in front of him is on fire and looks like it has been for quite some time; the entire right half has caved into itself and ash and soot and sparks shower onto the street below.
"Haha!" Malfoy shouts in triumph as he runs past him to man the fort. He sends another two snowballs at Harry while he's down, and they hit his gloved hand and his back.
“And the Dursley’s, too.” Harry lets out a little chuckle, laced with bitterness. “Maybe Dudley, my cousin, I could forgive, since he was so young, but my aunt and uncle…I just...don’t understand why they would-” He stops.
They enter, and step inside. “I think we’re ready to go now, Malfoy,” Longbottom calls. Weasley, Finnigan, and Thomas avoid eye contact. Harry’s gaze is starting to feel like a brand, searing Draco’s skin.
“Articulate as ever, Potter,” Malfoy quips, but without much bite. He drums the side of his coffee mug with his fingers and alternates between meeting Harry’s eyes and watching the pedestrians outside.
“How is it?” Draco asks Harry as he takes a break from eating and wipes his mouth with the corner of his cloth napkin.
"Please, call me Ginny. There are too many Weasley's in this house - you'll even confuse yourself. Come on in. The food's almost ready."
"It's fine," he mumbles. "If he wants to break up, then it's his choice. I have to respect that." He gathers his trash and stands up. "Let's go back."
Harry stops struggling now and takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. He listens for any further movement from within Malfoy’s room, but only hears what seems like the creak of his bed springs as he climbs in and no further noise.
Harry knocks. He waits for a full minute. There is no sign of movement from within, and the piano music continues. He tries the door and his heart drops when the knob turns easily. He dashes in, blood rushing to his head and right hand going for his wand.
They apparate home - a squat two-story in a fishing village not too far from London. Harry still owns 12 Grimmauld Place - he doesn’t think he could ever bring himself to sell it - but he never wants to live there again. It’s a chapter of his life that has closed.
“I know, I know.” Little by little, Hagrid comes out of the shell he’s retreated into. “I was thinkin’ this summer would be good. I’ll take her down ter the sea or sommat.”
They fall asleep like that, on the soft moss that grows between the scales of Glyder Fawr, face to face, holding hands.
The waitress comes back with the wine and pours them two glasses before Draco can reply. When she leaves, he takes a sip from his glass and Draco does that same, but not before swirling it around a bit and taking a whiff.
Only then does Harry dare to meet Kingsley's gaze. He's smiling with no trace of disappointment or pity in his face. "That's all. Good work so far."
The first thing Harry does when he wakes is send a Patronus to the Burrow, and to all the other people he knows will be attending tonight - Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. Hagrid wakes up just as the last silvery stag is bounding out the hut, and he asks while rubbing the sleep from his eyes, “What was that for?”
Five years. Five years worth of hard work and forging connections with Muggles from all walks of life. Five years worth of studying music, composing, and conducting research. Five years of rebuilding his life from scratch and this isn't even all he has to show for it.
“Good job! Now the other one-?” Before Harry even finishes his question, Malfoy’s completely on the ice.
“Sorry, I remembered I had left some readings in there.” Suddenly, Malfoy’s standing in the doorway of his bedroom, a pyramid of scrolls stacked in his arms. “I have to have all of these prepared by tomorrow.”
Harry trudges up to the front and plunks the books down on the desk. Without thanking Harry, Malfoy picks up the first textbook of the top and wastes no time in launching into his lecture.
But nothing comes. Life goes on much as it did before; Kreacher gleefully makes him breakfast, Harry throws his scarlet Auror robe on top of a worn T-shirt and jeans combo and heads to his office.
The rest of the evening passes peacefully and thankfully Malfoy-free. Andromeda continues knitting the amorphous mass of yarn in her lap, adding a little silver into the purple towards the end - all while gushing about Teddy and his spectacular marks in school. Harry leans back in the cushy couch and listens to her and the faint hoots of her two owls, Sherman and Bedelia, as they perch in their cages in the kitchen.
"I think so," Ginny ventures, ignoring George and answering Angelina’s question, "Unless anyone else has any other objections." No one does.
Hermione doesn’t drink for obvious reasons, but Charlie, and Ion are the only other ones who abstain, partly because a Burrow Christmas without any sober adults is a disaster that no one wants to remember or repeat ever again, but mostly because Ion doesn’t drink because he’s Muslim, and Charlie has sworn it off as well since they first started dating. “I never did like the taste, anyways,” Charlie once confided in Harry the first time he introduced Ion to the family.
Harry half-laughs with relief. “That’s an understatement. Don’t worry, okay? He wasn’t mad at me about that.”
Without even turning around, Harry steps to the side to block Draco from the sink. The smile in his voice shines as he speaks. “It’s your birthday, Malfoy. Just let me do this for you.”
Slowly, gingerly, Draco extracts himself from the hug after a few minutes. He’s now speaking to the children in tones so hushed that Harry can’t hear, but his face is earnest and serious, and the children’s faces reflect his.
“Actually,” Ron continues, “I should probably tell her that you’re sane again-” He opens the door and Harry sees her; she’s sitting on his bed, reading a book. It’s not one of his, he knows that for sure since he threw out most of his, so she must have been carrying one around in her purse the entire time. Classic Hermione. “He’s conscious,” Ron announces.
"Hello everyone. How have you all been?" He picks up Lucy first, who's the youngest of Percy's children and also happens to be the most emotionally needy. Every time he sees her, she insists on either being near him or held by him at all times, and if she doesn't get her way, she screams.
The fourth day of the trip, Draco runs them ragged, showing them the steepest slopes and most difficult hikes, hoping pure exhaustion manages to deter Harry and Weasley, but that night, his eyes once again fly open to the deep purple of the dark and murmuring voices out back.
Neither men hesitate; it's like seeing that flash of gold ignites something old inside of them, some kind of muscle memory or instinct that they'd forgotten about until now. They push their brooms forward faster and faster and faster, until they're neck and neck. The Snitch flutters ahead of them still, but the gap between it and them grows smaller and smaller, until Harry's fingertips are brushing against its smooth metal body.
Laughing, Arthur replies, "That's going to be quite a big wedding then." After a moment, he adds, "That was a good pun."
"Thank you, I'm glad you found it interesting. I look forward to seeing you all in class tomorrow - I have something fun planned. And my 'lab' is currently my apartment."
"Uncle Harry!" "Finally!" "Harry!" They crowd around him and chatter in excitement. Most of them are practically teenagers -  Victoire, Dominique, Molly II, Lucy, Fred II, and Roxanne - but for some reason their enthusiasm and outright preference for Harry have remained through the years. Harry is pretty sure he's not that interesting; all he ever does is tell them stories about Hogwarts and the War and Quidditch, but they eat it up eagerly every year without fail.
He can hear the smile in Draco's voice. "You're a Saviour without even trying. You should have expected this."
Prasad and Walker skid down the slope and run over. Amira’s levitating wheelchair flies her down, and Dr. Julie Khanyile follows her wife. They crowd close, smiling and laughing, and don’t flinch for a moment at the stench of birth fluid that has no doubt soaked to Draco’s innermost layer.
The entire Ministry buzzes with activity around Harry; after such a high-profile event like the orphanage burning, it was impossible to keep the investigation a secret any longer. The media - save for The Quibbler, which has kept its reporting serious and unbiased - has gone mad from pure glee. They revel in every attack. They rejoice at every failed arrest. But most of all, they salivate at any and all sightings of Harry Potter, the Auror they believe to be at the front of the entire investigation.
The "kids" look around at each other. "I think I want to stay a little while longer," Ginny voices her opinion. Luna, seated beside her, nods in agreement.
But Draco doesn’t crack. “I was just telling Gran-Hermione what I’ve been doing since the War, Ma’am.”
“I don’t know much about all of this. I didn’t get out much as a child. And the last time I went camping…” Harry trails off. “Well. It was a long time ago.”
Draco stares at his gift. The craftsmanship is sublime, and the charm work is complex. With his thumb, he rubs the inside lining, and it’s smooth as cream.
Malfoy’s blushing. He’s turning increasingly redder by the second and his voice rises an octave higher: “Well I….certainly don’t think that’s a
“Harry Potter! It’s Harry Potter!” Some kind of commotion breaks out from behind Harry, and when he turns to look, a groan escapes his lips, unbidden. A growing group of wizards with enchanted notepads try to huddle forth to speak with Harry, to get the Savior’s comment on the whole situation, and are stopped only by Robards’ level glare. Harry scurries away, ducking his head and hoping no one else will notice him.
And with that, Draco carefully sets the microphone on the piano and sits on the bench. His hands are piled in his lap and his eyes are closed.
They don’t walk very far. Draco opts to take them to Llyn Trawsfynydd, instead of his originally planned, more treacherous hike.
Shaking his head, Draco replies, “No, you don’t understand. Then Mother started to talk about her childhood and what it was like growing up with Bellatrix and Harry, it was
The other nod in agreement. "He's not as bad as he used to be," Ginny muses. "I didn't want to hex him every second he continued talking, for example."
but his mouth refuses to open. Everyone around him has frozen: Hermione, the members of Wizengamot, the old man who delivered Malfoy’s sentence - everyone except for Malfoy and the men dragging him away. Malfoy’s eyes snap up to meet Harry’s just as the doors slam shut in front of his face.
Harry sneaks a look at Malfoy. He’s still hunched over the desk with a few strands of blonde hair hanging over his eyes. Underneath his robes, he’s wearing a light tan sweater with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Harry’s eyes linger there, and when they look back up again they meet Malfoy’s.
The game of House that the children have been playing seems to be winding down as well - Victoire, the oldest of them all, is reading a bedtime story to the rest, who are laying perfectly still on the floor. Harry can’t tell if they’re playing bedtime, or actually going to bed.
Harry chuckles and takes Rose from Hermione as he emerges fully from the fireplace. She immediately latches onto him, clutching at the collar of his faded T-shirt. “Did you miss me?” He asks, teasing her.
Climbing the horizon, a glint of metal - a familiar car. It approaches slowly, the air around it wavering like Draco’s heart.
Noticing his discomfort, Sophia begins to profusely apologize. “Oh I’m so sorry sir! I just meant that it would be fantastic to include your class officially, but I completely understand if you wouldn’t want to stay.”
"I agree! I never knew jazz could be so uplifting," Hermione enthuses while coming around Harry's other side.
The next day, Draco wakes more refreshed than he’s been in a long time. Outside, the rain continues, a tapping at the window and on the roof.
Harry’s voice, when he speaks, parts the heavy summer air. Half-proclamation, half-confidence, all melody: “Because it’s you.”
Everyone knows the Malfoy vaults were emptied after the War. Apparently, Harry was too busy courting Ginerva Weasley to read the tabloids. Draco tries to control his breathing.
His coworkers - M. Prasad and Lin Walker - flit in and out, helping him here and there, but he scarcely sees them. Amira comes by, too, giving him direction. Bringing him the lunch he’s been neglecting:
After swallowing her water, she continues, "What I suggest is a combination of both Wizarding and Muggle outreach. Of course, Muggles can't yet protect themselves from magical forces, but Wizards can. What's stopping a collaboration between the two communities? Our histories are marked with so much strife already - I think more teamwork and mutual understanding, especially from the Wizarding side, is long overdue."
Draco watches Harry watch him. He hasn’t changed all that much in the years since the War. Same tangled hair, crooked glasses. Same deft hands. Same eyes, the green pinning Draco down as it always has.
"To a degree. I primarily use that and Muggle physics as a basis for my research." Draco takes a sip from his glass of water.
In the end, Harry takes a mostly unintentional nap while trying to pass the time. The owl with instructions from Robards never comes, but Harry doesn't care. As soon as it's 5:00PM, Harry heads out his office, not even bothering to spell it locked behind him.
Harry looks up, then, and it’s only then that Draco realizes how close they are - Harry, leaning in, and Draco with his back to the doorframe. Those eyes of his, so very green. And in their depths, Draco sees himself reflected - small and nervous.
“I know. Shh.. It’s alright now. It’s going to be alright.” He soothes while trying and failing to mask the own fear in his voice.
It takes him a long time to fall asleep that night; the knot in his stomach refuses to unravel enough to let him slip away.
“In the myths, it was one of the giants who tried to overthrow the gods. Ultimately, Athena - or Minerva - slew it, and threw it into the sky - freezing it in its coils forever.”
Harry nods and takes the baby from his arms. An hour passes in relative peace. While Malfoy chats animatedly with the children and show them the proper hand form, Harry sits the baby on his leg and watches the two toddlers as they play some sort of wobbly game of tag through the rooms.
“Harry.” Malfoy takes a deep breath in, as if preparing to say something important, but he doesn’t have a chance to before it all goes to shit. Rain begins smacking into the roof in big, fat droplets. They bleed through the ceiling, through the walls, through everything.
The other, a boy dressed in black robes with a green trim also introduces himself. “I’m Lucas. He, him, his. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
Slowly, Harry nods, but says nothing. No longer does he trample through, thinking he can save Draco from himself with the force of his words alone. Now, he waits. And waits. And when he does touch the glass, the fragile petals at his feet, he does so how he touches all of Draco: like something beloved.
“Hm.” Malfoy turns his head and regards the world out the window. The snow has stopped, but plenty of it remains on the ground in icy piles. Harry prepares himself for flat, resolute rejection, but it never comes. “Okay,” Malfoy decides, “But it’s Muggle, so be careful what you say. They don’t know the whole story of the War - or even that there was a war at all. To them, terrorists killed their parents.”
Desperation creeps up on Harry, but he doesn't quite know why. "But you two are his friends, right?"
After a long moment: “Your position is an interesting and valuable one…” Kingsley begins, slow and hesitant as if he is choosing his words carefully. “...and I will endeavor to put it into action either today or tomorrow. But for now, we have these following orders for you all.” At that, he stops talking and looks to Robards expectantly.
He stands tall among the students and talks to them with a tone of confidence that Harry can hear even from far away, though he can't catch the individual words.  Harry supposes that Malfoy has always been a natural leader; his gang of Slytherins only ever listened to him back in the day, an accomplishment that none of the professors or even Dumbledore could claim.
“...Thank you for reaching out, Harry.” Neville’s suddenly all sobered up, looking intently at Harry.
"You two went to school together?!" Sophia gapes at them. The look on her face suggests that she has finally connected all the dots.
"I hope you all had a good time tonight," Draco says into the microphone, trying to hold it in a way that the flowers of the bouquet don't end up tangled in it. "The bar will close in half an hour, and the club an hour, so please stay with us for a little bit more. And Happy Holidays." And with that, Draco walks off the stage, followed close behind by Belle, the spotlight dims, and the house lights come back out with bright ferocity.
Draco gathers the cards and fits them neatly back into the box. He tucks them into his pack, and when he’s done, he stares out the dark window, refusing to make eye contact. If Harry Potter has something to say, then he can say it first, and Draco will wait. He has learned to be quite good at it.
McGonagall leans forward at her desk and motions for them to sit. "Draco, I want you to come back to teach sometime. If not next school year, at least something small like this during the break again. I've been looking to expand Hogwarts as an institution in recent years, and I believe my judgement is correct that your work will be key to that end."
A simple statement. So simple, it’s almost bare of any feeling, like branches in winter. From anyone else’s mouth, the words would drop to the floor - a stone - but from Harry’s, they bud and unfurl. Draco hears the blooms open; he hears them gather on the ground. Then, he hears the way the tree swells with summer.
in number, in volume, in everything. Harry swears he sees Headmistress McGonagall choke a little on her pumpkin juice.
be sitting with Andromeda at her dining room table right now, enjoying whatever delicious meal she’d prepared today. Mashed Potatoes? Sauteed asparagus? Harry’s stomach rumbles with yearning and he pats it sympathetically.
They make their way back to the house, and while walking Hermione asks Draco with awe on her face, "Draco, I didn't know you were so good with children."
“Mm. Goodnight.” And with that, Draco slips off into sleep. Harry knew he was too tired for his own good.
Draco’s namesake seems to twinkle in greeting. Most other constellations come and go, depending on the time of year, but Draco never sets. Always and forever, whether Draco looks up or not, the dragon twists on in the dark.
While moving his knight, Draco complains, “Teddy’s become too smart for his own good - that’s what happened.”
"I see." She moves closer and extends her hand to him; when he takes it and shakes, he feels its softness and the smooth golden rings on her fingers. "I'm Belle, his boss."
Only a few people are seated at the bar, to Harry's surprise. The bartender, a young, fresh-faced woman dressed in a flowy blouse and a white hijab greets him as he walks up.
Longbottom bobs his head, looking back out at the view: the mountains tall and jutting, the valleys dizzying. Over the edge of the path they walk is a steep drop, leading to a river, curving around a distant hill and out of sight. The sun has begun its fall, though its light remains strong. Something calls across the valley, its echo lonely and small.
Draco hums in response and falls silent. Harry crawls into bed with him and hugs him from behind. “Thinking about kids, huh? Who’s the father?”
And that's all, folks! Hope you enjoyed this little sequel. If you want to learn more about the process of writing this fic, check out my tumblr @Inofaro!
They sit in silence for a little bit, and during that time a gaggle of teens enter the cafe, order, and settle noisily in a booth in the far corner. Harry wears away at his bottom lip and all the while Neville continues staring out the window at nothing, not meeting his eyes.
They’ve prepared for this. They knew the call would be coming any time - in the recent week, the once-flawless obsidian surface of each of the five eggs has begun to show small, white cracks.
"Yes - I just needed to pick up my pay from McGonagall. Care to walk with me?" As he's in the process of saying that and fiddling with his sleeve cuffs, he glances up and sees the mistletoe hanging innocuously above his head.
Puffing out her chest, she takes his hand and shakes it heartily. The rest of his team has gather around him now, and Harry's team has done the same. The line they've stopped at seems to be the halfway mark between where their wands now lie in two heaps at the two ends.
Draco answers readily, his words flowing smoothly off his tongue and into the ears of the some dozen Weasleys gathered around the table, "Volunteering at a Muggle War orphanage, sir."
Ava opens her mouth as if to respond to that, closes it, but then opens it again after a moment of hesitation. "Sorry - I don't mean to presume, and I know that Belle and I hate when people do that - but are you two...together?"
They take a right and Malfoy stops in front of the tall brown building on the corner. “This is it.” He rings the bell and they wait.
They walk in silence for another corridor before Malfoy interrupts it. “Please extend my sincerest apologies to Longbottom. And reassure him of the truth.”
Harry also vaguely remembers Ron talking to him about it too, but as Harry didn't really give a shit whether or not the Ministry of Magic's research department matched up to others, he wasn't really listening.
“Did you expect to be sleeping in the bed?” Malfoy’s perched at the end of the couch now, smiling mirthfully down at Harry as he struggles to untangle himself from the blankets.
She thinks for moment and answers, “I think that should be okay.” Then, she places a hand on Rose’s head and asks her, “Is next Saturday okay with you? Christmas Eve?”
It's just Harry again. Just Harry Potter buried in his bed with the windows drawn in his empty bedroom at Grimmauld Place. The house is mostly silent, save for the occasional groaning of the infrastructure as it settles in. And the neighborhood is usually quiet as well, even though Harry seems to have a lot of families with children for neighbors.
She continues. "I've gotten multiple requests for you to stay - practically an entire petition, in fact." A dramatic pause. "And I seek to honor their requests - but only if you're obliging."
Rose’s upper lip quirks, bringing Harry back to his Hogwarts days when frequently saw her very same expression on Ron’s face every time he tried to bullshit an essay. “I have to check my schedule,” Rose announces before scrambling out of Harry’s arms and running into the hallway, presumably heading to her room.
He's nervous about breaking up with me, probably, Harry thinks as he sullenly stabs at a piece of chicken.
After Hermione secretly uses her wand and summons an impressive bunch of flowers, she gives them to Harry. "Bring those up to him."
The two men trudge through the grass and funnel into Draco’s cottage. Draco’s coat, nightshirt, and pajama bottoms are soaked through, and Harry isn’t much better off. Draco lends Harry some clothing, and the pair take turns taking hot showers.
It’s strange: without the distorting flow, Draco can see the twists and drops of the river more clearly. The piles of gravel, deposited along the sides during slow flow. The twigs and branches piled up, forming natural dams. Dozens of times Draco has walked this stream - washed his hands and face with its bounty - and all this while he didn’t know it at all.
Harry and Draco take the brooms back to the shed before joining up with their friends, who're still huddled in the corner of the yard, waiting on them. "Let's go?" Draco asks them while adjusting his coat and smoothing down his hair.
The chatter from inside stops all at once. Harry can hear a muffled "Is that-" before the voice is shushed by what sounds like several people at the same time. There are footsteps, and suddenly the door is flung open and it’s Ginny standing before them in the doorway.
Draco scoffs at this. "I suppose I have Teddy, but other than that, no." He shrugs off his coat, folds it, and rolls up the sleeves of his shirt. "Part of my sentence after the War was community service, and I chose to serve a Muggle War orphanage. And I've been there ever since." He says it so casually, almost in a throw-away line, an
He doesn’t answer, and reaches for the trowel. “You should go back.” The sunlight beats down on them both. “It’s hot out.”
Almost immediately after he finishes, a line forms at the donation table. Both Belle and Ava are running it now, along with one of bouncers, but even between the three of them they can't accept the checks and cash fast enough.
“To your marital bliss!” Weasley had toasted, sloshing his drink. The other men raised their glasses, and Harry did, too, his face pale in the firelight.
Once they gather their breath and quench their thirst, Draco watches them begin to take notice of their surroundings. Their eyes trace the sloping mountainside, to their unattainable culmination. Then, they slip down, and follow the range as it rises and falls, curves and straightens. They suspect nothing, Draco knows this. No one ever does.
Arthur seems to be at a complete loss for words, opening and closing his mouth repeatedly but not a sound escaping it.
“Wha-? No, I’m not disappointed.” Gently, Harry lays a hand atop the bureau. “Really, this is great. Better than I imagined.”
One by one, he goes through the rest of the clutch the same way, until finally, when the fifth baby is drooling over its food, he lets himself fall to the ground, body outstretched and chest heaving. The shards of broken eggs lay around him, like black snow, and the babies stumble through them and sniff at Draco’s head.
The tea warms Harry’s hands as he chuckles and reflects on his time in Hagrid’s class, trying not to die by Flobberworm. “I heard Neville’s working here now?” Hermione had told him, obviously hopeful that they would reconcile.
Sophia laughs nervously, looking between Harry and her friend. “Sh-shouldn’t we get started on the project? At this rate, we won’t finish.”
But before either Harry or Ron can react, Draco adds, looking Harry up and down, "Oh, and you may need to lose the Muggle blue jeans before tonight, Harry."
Harry looks over to Draco. He’s smiling, but it's tight-lipped. "Fantastic. But I am sorry to say that the children cannot join us, as the bar is still 18+." This elicits a round of disappointed groans from the children.
“It was….amazing.” The flavor was perfect. “Just like what my dad used to make.” Harry’s gone a little choked up without him realizing it. Teddy and Draco and Andromeda give him warm looks, and Harry steals the last bit of fish.
“Want to grab drinks sometime? To properly catch up. Sorry - I’ve got to dash over to meet my boyfriend right now.”
“When did-” When Harry begins talking, he grimaces, realizing that his mouth tastes of vomit. “When did I get here?”
Hermione and Ron are beaming, practically glowing with happiness. This is basically what happened when they announced they were pregnant with Rose - only Molly had actually fainted then. Progress.
"As you all know," Kingsley begins, "Jack Willows, one of the main leaders of the recent neo-Death Eater movement has escaped from custody after he turned himself in claiming the
“I wouldn’t want to be a constellation,” Draco admits. “With just one person, on display to the world, but unable to reach down.”
“You wouldn’t get lonely if you were trapped under a sheet of ice for several months out of the year?”
Kreacher has dinner waiting for him when he gets back, but even though the aroma of chicken curry, his favorite food, would usually get him salivating before even reaching the kitchen, Harry feels nothing. He bites into his food and tastes nothing. He vaguely registers Kreacher off the side, eyeing him with concern and asking him questions - is it not to Master's liking? Would Master like a glass of water? Milk? Juice? - but he doesn't care enough to respond with more than grunts. After dinner, as he sinks into the squished couch he bought at a Muggle yard sale a few years ago and fires up the television, he feels nothing.
“Look, Draco.” His gaze follows to where Harry is pointing. Through a thicket, it’s where one of the main tributaries in this area should be. “It’s dried out.”
Draco’s hand goes into his jacket pocket, and he clutches the smooth vial within. Hearing the shuffle of his clothing, Prasad looks up again. “A Muggle vehicle? That’s a first.”
After work, he apparates home, shrugs off his robes and shrugs on a Muggle coat, and spells his hair blonde to lessen the chances that someone will recognize him. It's worked a few times before when he wanted to run errands unbothered or play in public with Rose, so he figures it's worth a shot. The fact that it's apparently an all-Muggle event helps his chances at anonymity greatly.
“Oh fu-really?!” Almost as if the sheer force of Harry’s words has thrown himself off balance, Harry accidently skates too fast in the wrong direction and collides into Malfoy, who manages to catch him without falling himself.
Harry glares at him. “I can walk back, just cast an Impervious.” Apparently, he had left his own wand in his cottage.
“That sounds fun. I've always wanted to go ice skating.” She yawns. “I’ll leave you to it, Draco. Going to lie down for a bit. Nice to meet you Harry.” With a wave of the hand, she’s gone, leaving Harry alone in the kitchen with Draco Malfoy, a baby, and a few small children who’ve been tinkering away at the piano during their conversation. Harry is beginning to sweat a little.
“I lasted until the day of the wedding. I thought I could do it.” Harry’s voice is torn, raw. “Then I remembered what you said. About not wanting to disappoint anyone.”
Stella's screaming something, but Harry can't hear. As he runs past the midpoint line of the field, he also runs past Lucas, who makes eye contact with Harry before charging on, desperate to be the first to deliver the wands to his team.
“Are you going to be alright going by yourself?” Hermione’s looking at the pair with her brows furrowed. Behind her, Bill and George have gotten into a heated debate with Audrey and Percy over Quidditch, which the latter pair has only recently gotten into.
So when it becomes clear that something is bothering Draco, one week in November, when the chill of fall begins to turn icy and brutal, Harry lets him stew. And stew. And stew some more. Because Harry knows Draco will come to him eventually - but only when he’s ready and not a second before.
“This is an amazing honor. Thank you. But I can’t accept this alone.” She looks out at the audience - specifically at the row of people in front of Harry.
"Great. Meeting adjourned," Robards practically growls at the end before storming out the room. Kingsley lifts an eyebrow at the aggressive display, but gives no other indication that Robards is acting strangely in any way. Harry wonders what their one-on-ones must be like. Perhaps it's better if he didn't know.
The Lake is quiet. No birds, who have wisely decided to travel South, and no students - not even any wind. The only movement is the falling snow and the sun moving across the sky. Oh, and of course, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter skating across the ice.
It's Draco, but once Harry turns around and looks at him expectantly, he quickly drops his hand and turns red. "S-sorry. I'm not sure-I don't know why I did that. You can go on the tour if you want."
"Thank you. Coming, Harry? Or would you like to forfeit now?" His voice is taunting, teasing, and he's saying and doing all of this knowing full well what Harry's reaction will be. It's at times like these that Harry fears that Draco is actually fully aware of the effect that he has on Harry - and is playing it to his advantage.
Though Harry groans in protest, he still picks himself off the floor - an action that he doesn't remember being quite so difficult when he was young - and obeys. With the two men levitating five mugs each, they make it in one trip.
So they hurry, levitating the supplies halfway, then opting to carry them by hand. Though human lives are short, dragon memories live on, and they remember what magic has brought unto their kind. Even bringing out a wand in their presence is enough to scatter them into the sky, soaring and skittish.
The two teams meet in the middle, like in the beginning, and congratulate each other - no feelings lost at all. Malfoy pats Harry on the back and says, "Nicely played. It seems you've stayed in shape."
idea, necessarily, But um.” He pauses. “Isn’t it strange for the….the f-first date to be a family Christmas?”
"Shh. I have more to say." Draco clears his throat. "I hope you want the same. Because even though we're both... a little fucked up-"
After, they squeeze onto the two-seater in the living room, and listen to the song of rain. The dryer hums in the background, and their clothes tumble around together. Draco could dry them with a flick of his wand, but there is no rush, and he’s grown quite used to doing it all the Muggle way.
He's right. Since most of Harry's job is just copying the same information on thousands and thousands different forms, the Copy Quill - which he's been eyeing himself for a few months now - will make it far less depressing. "Thank you - hopefully this will shut Robards up about 'efficiency' for a while." He tries to joke, but it comes out half-hearted. The gift only reminds him that he has to go back to the Ministry, to his small desk and his small cubicle tomorrow.
When he speaks again, his voice is thin and weary. “What bothers me is what the adults in my life did to me. How Snape took out his grudge on an eleven-year-old. How Dumbledore kept everything from me, until it was almost too late. How-” He stops to swallow. “How he gave me over to the Dursleys, knowing who they were. What they were.”
"So it's settled then?" Angelina asks. "Because I'll have to let my parents know that we're leaving early from dinner tomorrow."
He holds it up; it’s an unmarked notebook, and Harry knows that the inside is blank too, but it’s the function that makes it so unique.
For lunch, they picnic on the beach. The wind that blows is warm, today, and it carries brine and salt. The storm has completely dissipated now, unhindering the sun’s shine. Draco watches the men stretch out in the afternoon light. Thomas takes off his jacket and lays it on Finnigan’s dozing body. Weasley begins to snore openly, his head a mop of red in Harry’s lap.
was the one who grow up with Muggles. Baggy dress pants means they don't fit right! That's a basic rule of Muggle formal wear! Plus the color was all wrong."

"Cut the bullshit Harry. You and Draco? Sneaking off?" She playfully digs an elbow into his ribs and he winces.
He looks away and off behind Harry, at the rest of the club. "Saying things like that so...seriously."
"Okay, okay. Basically, we’ve been hanging out all this week while he’s been teaching his class and he didn’t have any other plans for Christmas so it just...happened. Sorry for not giving you all an earlier notice."
"Very well." George puffs out his chest a little. "We're looking to opening our first store in America in a month, actually."
Harry can tell that he and Draco have the same thought at the same time, from the looks of the blush tinting the blonde’s cheeks.
While Draco busies himself with the extensive looking list of wine on the back of the menu, Harry scans the food items for something he recognizes only to quickly fail because the entire menu is in french.
The Ministry is quiet Monday mornings; many of its workers take their time coming in after a weekend of relaxation and fun. Harry used to be one of them, but he's trying not to be any longer. His department needs all active Aurors now more than ever - the public is growing antsy and desperate for some kind of concrete progress in the neo-Death Eater case. Harry doesn't blame them. Just this last week alone, there were two failed bombings in London. Failed only because the field teams efficiently tracked them down and disarmed them before any more Muggle lives were claimed. The hunt for the bastards behind it all has reached a fever pitch, both in the Wizarding and the Muggle worlds.
Harry, sounding abashed, says, “We didn’t really think about it when we booked the trip. The wedding just happened to be scheduled for the spring.”
He smiles slightly, and turns toward Draco again, his face like ash. “How did you do it? Know me like that?”
Harry remains at the entrance, staring at Draco. The latter feels sweat begin to prick at his collar.
Draco feels Harry struggle to find words for a moment, before he settles on a weak: “I didn’t know you were in touch.”
And judging from the hectic state of the entire department, no one would notice if Harry were to slack off a little bit, cut some corners. In fact, they still might not even notice if Harry left work altogether.
"I don't know!" Harry flounders. "You said you wanted to talk about ‘us,’ and that it was serious. I just assumed-"
Big, big thanks to everyone who left kudos + all the nice comments on my work - I see you, I've read them all, and I appreciate you more than you know.
“Well if you were keeping up, you would’ve caught that we’ve lost the Manor. My mother’s living in a quaint little cottage in the English countryside, now.” He pauses before changing the subject, “I remember the press was in an uproar around that time about you, now that I think about it.” Harry quirks an eyebrow at him and Draco hastily adds. “More so than the usual - ‘Harry Potter spotted having a spot of tea at half past three instead of three, his usual time!”
Ron suddenly looks even more serious than he did earlier - if that's even possible. "I wish. We need you back in the office. We're having an emergency staff meeting in an hour, and it's a big one this time. Robards'll seriously be pissed if you skip."
He falls asleep like that, and when he rises in the morning, puffy-eyed and sore, he notices that Kreacher had thrown his comforter over him sometime in the night.
Harry places his other foot on the ice, which elicits a squeal from Malfoy. His hands feel pleasantly warm on Harry’s stomach. “I’m on the ice now.”
“No,” Malfoy admits, “But I wasn’t straight either,  so I could tell.” He’s still lying on the ice, completely ignoring Harry’s extended hand. “Lie down with me.”
Draco buries his head into Harry’s chest so forcefully that it knocks him breathless. Slow and heavy breathing, then - sobs. Like a shower of stars, Draco’s tears come rare and fast and shining.
- the Auror department’s number one priority, and it shouldn’t ever matter again whether or not they’re Muggle or magical.” Jenny snaps at that, and the two intertwine their hands at the table.
Once he's fully on his feet, Draco walks over to Rose and bows his head. "My apologies. I don't think either one of us caught the Snitch this time."
The papers strewn on his desk rustle violently before flying everywhere and suddenly Harry's being drenched by all the papers and files raining down in his office. His hands clench and unclench. Wandless magic tends to get away from him in moments of high emotion. One of the spare quills on his desk splits neatly in half, longways.
In comparison, Percy just isn't even on the same level as her. He's not particularly ugly, but he's undeniably dull as a person, and kind of a prick - at least in Harry’s opinion. For Audrey, however, he's obedient and compromising and loving, so perhaps Harry is only opposed to their couplehood not because they're bad for each other, but because he's a bit jealous.
Malfoy throws his hands up in frustration. “He was angry! It’s the right thing to do?! I don’t know! If you don’t want to fix your relationship, then nevermind! Forget I asked.” He speeds up.
A strong flush has risen to Ron's cheeks now, almost turning him as red as his robes. "Don't you dare blame her for your own mistakes."
Draco clenches his jaw. He flings back the covers, grabs his coat, stamps across the cottage, and throws the back-porch door open. By the light creeping out from behind him, he sees a figure - just one - sitting a little ways off in the distance. It turns and faces him.
The crowd is quiet now, and expectant. Hermione reaches over and squeezes Harry's hand, but when he looks back at her, his face questioning, she avoids his gaze and trains her eyes instead on the stage.
His feet has a mind of its own. Harry protests, tries to leave the room, but he ends up on the bed and in Draco’s arms anyways. His pale, bare, exposed chest stares at Harry, taunting him.
“See you tomorrow then? Don’t tell Hermione I told you this but,” Ron pauses to look around for eavesdroppers, “We have something to tell you. A surprise.”
In the end, Malfoy leads his students to his living quarters for hot chocolate. They ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ at his place, even though it's fairly plain and modest. For some reason, seeing eight teenagers piled on the couch Harry had crashed on earlier in the week is a strange sight.
Draco settles in, as he has so many times before. He takes out the cooking supplies and the ingredients. He places the vial on the bed stand. He regards it for a moment, then turns and goes to start on the cooking.
There is much to be done, tomorrow. And the day after, and the day after that. But one of the hardest parts of the process is already over with, and Harry knows that Draco, as he does in the face of all challenges - cooking, Dragon Handling, loving Harry - will learn quickly, excel, and still manage to teach Harry a thing or two.
A few hours pass, and the shadows outside deepen. One by one, Longbottom, Weasley, Thomas, Finnigan retire for the evening - the latter two pounding Draco on the back on their way out (the last game ended with Draco being the Old Maid).
“Thank you.” Draco says, the sincerity in his voice surprising him. He looks up, and there Harry is, suddenly. Watching him, his face intense. And very close.
Harry leans over and presses a kiss to his cheek. "Thanks." Without waiting for his reaction, Harry sweeps out the restaurant, finds an alleyway, and apparates.
“Neville-” Harry pauses, gathering his words. He’s the one who invited Neville here. He has one chance to make everything right. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I don’t think I can say it enough.”
Suddenly, Harry can't take it anymore. He knows he has to be the one to put himself out of his misery. "Draco. Listen. It's okay. If you want to break up, we can break up. You don't need to ex-"
He savors their looks of confusion. It has always been his favorite part: the drawing back of the curtain.
“I’ve...never thought about that before.” Malfoy’s hands are carefully folded in his lap, and he’s staring intently down on them.
On cue, the lights dim and people begin to find their seats. Harry slips into a small table at the very back of the club; he knows he should greet Belle, Ava, Pat, and the children, but he convinces himself that there's no time. That they're busy right now and he shouldn't bother them.
Draco looks away. He squints against the falling sun instead, and says, “We should return. It will be good weather, tonight, for stargazing.”
“Yeah, of course. And not really. Even if I don’t understand the topic, I could at least organize them or something,” he finishes lamely.
Ion nods to confirm. "The Wizarding community there is very accepting toward Muggles. And their technologies." He digs around in his pocket and pulls out a small flip phone. When he flips it open, the screen lights up, but instead of numbers on the buttons, there are only letters. "Instead of Portkeys now, we use this. Type in any location, and you will go there. Perfect for those who can't apparate, like me."
An owl does come, in the end, but when Harry unties the letter from its leg and unfurls again, he perks up as soon as he realizes it's not from Robards, but Draco.
Just as Draco predicted, they reach the cottages just as the sun is slipping into the mountain’s pocket and casting the sky in orange and the hills in gold.
Ron just smiles and shakes his head, "This is just like when Hermione snips at me for wearing trainers with dress robes, even though no one can see them. Sometimes, in a relationship, you just have to learn to compromise."
