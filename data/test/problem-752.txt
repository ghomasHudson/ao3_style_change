Shaking his head slightly, he makes his way out the doors and they walk side by side, hands in their pockets to keep out the cold. Potter shoots him furtive glances every so often as they walk down the snowy paths, but Draco ignores them, wondering vaguely if his strange new behavior is a byproduct of the War.
Potter does, pulling the covers almost up to his chin, and Draco most definitely does not find it cute.
Observation: Potter isn’t with them.
There’s blood.
“Among other things,” Potter huffs, picking at the scar on his forearm idly. Draco knows that move: Potter’s on the verge of a breakdown, and he’s trying to act casual to cover it up. “I suppose we’ll get to talking about them. The… the War and everything. Eventually. If you want.”
he can faintly make out - and grasps Draco’s hand in his own.
The blood is coming from his arm, and Draco watches, transfixed, as the pool of blood vanishes into the tip of Pomfrey’s wand and the wound slowly stitches into one long scar. It looks strange, a single scar marring an otherwise smooth surface. Potter hadn’t harmed his forearms before, as far as he knew; he’d stuck to his upper arms, chest, stomach, even his shoulders.
Draco sat next to his boyfriend and cut to the chase. “McGonagall said I can see my parents this weekend. I’m leaving for St. Mungo’s early on Saturday by Portkey.”
“Draco.”
“I have little control over that, but I’ll be sure to let them know,” Antigone said dryly.
Harry tilted his mug to one side, formulating a reply. “There’s still give and take, though,” He said finally.
that you came to me. Really, I am. However, there’s not much time until my next class, especially not to go into detail about this complicated topic. See me after class today, will you? And we can set up an appointment to chat.”
“Involve the Ministry?” Draco’s voice was damp with suspicion. “Absolutely not. They’re more the ‘lock people up, ask questions later’ type. And I’d rather not let them toss me in Azkaban just yet.”
George patted the pockets of his plum-colored robes then made an exaggerated face of dismay. “Darn it, Ted, I think I left it at home.”
“I figured it was in June, but I asked Henrietta to be sure.”
Snow fell, silent as a fox, upon Hogwarts castle. The Whomping Willow shook cottony drifts off its spindly branches every once in a while. Friends huddled together for warmth, walking briskly from class to class between cold stone hallways. Only one person dared to stay outside for longer than was necessary, and he relished the frozen silence and aloneness more than anyone else would.
“Hey, Ginny,” Ron and Harry both replied, oblivious to her ill-disguised sneakiness.
Harry nodded firmly. “Got it.”
“I wasn’t exactly forced into it if that’s what you’re wondering.” Draco laced his fingers with Harry’s, their knees and shoulders touching, and rubbed his thumb soothingly on the back of his hand.
Draco scolded himself as he combed his damp hair. He didn’t want to think about Lucius Malfoy right now. Not until they were face-to-face.
“Lemon drop?” Harry guessed hopefully, but the statue did not budge. Though he could have sworn, its expression became slightly more mocking than before. “Damn. I thought that one might-”
I'm pretty sure this is the shortest chapter so far. I couldn't resist digging around in Draco's mind at least a little bit; his character has so many layers that can't all be discovered within the span of one fanfiction. I also put a bit of a sinister spin on the Room of Requirement - after all, people have died in there...
“Please…” The woman begged, and her voice was the voice of many, each soul inside her speaking over the others. “
“Oh, all right,” Harry relented. In truth, he would have let Draco teach him a million old, complicated dances if only to be close to him. Warmth radiated off him like dusky sunlight, emanated through his content smile and the shine of his hair; Harry couldn’t stop staring.
Joey had no wish to answer that question. She could only imagine and doing so scared her. “We’ll help him,” Joey said, though her conviction faltered. She wanted badly to pull off an epic rescue with wands blazing. “We’ll save Draco, I promise you.”
He dripped dittany on the lower cuts first, and though the wounds didn’t close entirely, the blood loss slowed. Draco carefully cut open her bra with a quick spell and continued the process.
by your fit figure,” Draco says teasingly, poking Harry’s stomach, “There’s not enough for me to hug.”
“I’m a little late, I realize.”
“And you? Have you anything else to say?”
Draco gave a start. “How did you-”
“England, yes, I could tell from this one,” Nikki interrupted, jerking her head at Harry. “Well, Ben - and company. Want to see a dragon?”
The smoke from Draco’s explosion had dissipated completely. Rain pattered gently on the overstory of leaves, many of them making their way through and dampening Harry’s shoulders. He crept forward carefully, keeping his head on a swivel and listening for any signs of movement.
Potter doesn’t look angry anymore; maybe he still is, but is too tired to show it. Draco can’t tell, but when he perches himself on the chair next to the bed, Potter doesn’t protest.
He’s walking back from his bi-weekly Mind Healer session - the ones McGonagall forced him into - when he runs into Granger and Weasley on the stairs. It’s his first reaction to nod politely and step around them, like he’s been doing all year.
“Oh, no,” Potter backtracks. “No, I just thought - actually, um great.” He looks absolutely mortified, and the sight almost makes Draco laugh. “I’ll meet you in the Entrance Hall at seven tomorrow?”
Draco shifts so the tear leaking out of his eye hits Potter’s shirt instead of his bare skin. “If Granger doesn’t force you to go to a Mind Healer, I will.”
Draco sighs and takes pity on him. “Give me those.” He reaches for the flowers, transfigures a vase, and places them on the nightstand. To Potter’s credit, they are rather lovely, and they smell delightful.
His hand, shaking and pale, reaches out to lock the door. The dorms are on the other side - he can’t have his roommates walking in on him.
(There’s no use trying to stop himself when he’s already made up his mind.)
He washes it away, but it keeps coming. Part of him believes the pain will wash away with the blood like it’s traveling downstream, like it’s a tangible thing, but most of him watches in detachment. Rivulets run down the sink, red to pink to a faint brown residue until he clears it away with a charm.
“He’s really not that subt-”
He doesn’t normally make a habit of looking at newspapers, but he catches sight of the Prophet during breakfast that morning. It’s laying underneath a plate of toast, as if someone had left it there for safekeeping.
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” Potter says, and deja vu swoops through Draco again when he remembers telling Pansy the exact same thing.
He expects them to snap at him, but Granger bites her lip and some silent exchange passes between the two. “Just… come with us, mate,” Weasley sighs, and Draco does a double take.
“Aren’t you gonna put up a fight?” he asks, bewildered.
Harry laughs, and he’s still laughing when Draco takes his arm and rubs a salve - a gift from Pansy, one that she’d been giving since sixth year when she found out - into the cut. It wasn’t even that funny; he’s pretty sure Harry’s just laughing for the sake of it, forcing joy into existence. The sound of it is loud and annoying and he wants to kiss him.
Draco closes his eyes, appalled and panicked. “What the fuck? If you’re planning on assaulting me, just know that-”
Fourth Year: scratching and picking.
“Draco, look at these,” Harry tugs his sleeve excitedly, like a little kid, and the spell is broken. “They have, like, twenty new flavors.” He’s holding a box of Sugar Quills in his hand, a multicolored array of delicate treats. Draco doesn’t have the heart to tell him he hates Sugar Quills.
They lead him to the hospital wing and barrel through the doors without a second of hesitation. Potter’s in the bed closest to the door and Draco skids to a stop the second he sees him.
Problem: he can’t remember the last time he got a full night’s rest.
“You really do have a way with words.”
They meander through the streets for a while, stopping at colorful storefronts and cracking jokes as if they’d been friends for - well, as if they were friends. Draco side-eyes Potter every now and then, searching his face for clues about what the fuck is going on. Every time, he’s met with a small smile or a quip, or the intentional bumping of Potter’s shoulder into his. By the time they reach Zonko’s, Draco stops overthinking and relishes in the warmth of the sun on his back, on Potter holding the door open for him instead of slamming it in his face with a sneer.
Most people probably assume he covers his forearms to obscure the Mark. They wouldn’t be wrong… they wouldn’t exactly be right, either.
“Please just untie me, Draco,” Potter says, and he sounds tired. Draco falters, caught off balance. Potter’s not the type to lay down -
Draco smiles in self satisfaction.
“I didn’t think you-”
“Merlin, it’s depressing looking at you. Just come fucking sit already. God.” Why is Potter looking at him like that? He’s supposed to be brash and annoying; now he’s just meek and annoying. It’s off putting.
Pansy rolls her eyes and places a roll on his plate. She’s been awfully protective of him since the War. It’s less embarrassing for them both if they just pretend it’s not happening. “He’s always like, five paces behind you, while you’re sneaking off to wherever the fuck it is you get off to all the time.” A pause. “Get off, haha.”
Except it has.
A wave of deja vu crashes over him, from the sight of Potter’s graveyard of a torso, only last time Draco had been the one in the bed, and this time - this time, the roles are reversed.
There’s no blood. He suspects the scratches might bruise, but he doesn’t mind. If he’s lucky, they might obscure the Mark.
A sound halfway between a laugh and a sob escapes Potter, and he keels over on Draco’s legs, still sob-laughing. A small smile comes to Draco’s face, despite everything.
Potter clears his throat when it becomes clear that Draco isn’t going to respond. “And, um…”
It’s been years since he’s even thought about Hogsmeade in this context, as a place to go for fun. He rather misses it. “I’m not sure.”
At least his dramatic exits remain magnificent.
“Hey.” Potter sidles up to him in the library, smiling because this is what they do now, apparently.
It’s no big deal. There’s no blood.
“It’s not as good as the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,” Potter leans in towards him as if he’s telling a secret. “But it’s the next best.” Draco’s momentary joy slides away and leaves him cold.
From that day on, he learns to trade one kind of pain for another.
she repeats, and he opens the covers for her to climb in next to him.
A roped-up and thrashing Potter falls onto the ground beside him. Draco allows a moment to envy Potter’s brown skin, because he’s as red as a tomato, and he rather hates the way Pansy is winking at him.
“Do you think you’re going to Hogsmeade this weekend?”
He blinks, still trying to catch up. “Obviously I want, Harry, don’t be daft. You’re so dramatic. Even a Weasley could see that we can’t keep carrying on the way we have.”
Pomfrey bustles busily around his bedside, bottles of colorful potions covering the nightstand. “No visitors, please,” she says briskly, but none of them move. She must be too busy to argue, because she sighs, “Just stay out of the way and let him rest, the three of you.”
“You sound awfully Slytherin.”
Potter, keeping his head down, focusing on studies. In all honesty, he’s been too preoccupied trying to stop being a piece of shit to spare Potter more than a passing thought. Most of the time.
The two other patrons of the shop gape at him, but he shoots them both a filthy glare. His ears are still ringing. He’s certain he’s never hated Potter more than he does at this moment.
She pats Potter on the back and leaves with a single look over her shoulder. It’s entirely in character for her, changing her mind within two minutes and then never explaining herself. He figures she’s only comfortable leaving because she plans to return in an hour when Potter’s gone.
Potter snickered, though not unkindly. “Good one, Malfoy. You’re a real comedian.”
Standing so close to her, Harry felt a wave of awkwardness settle over him. Remembering how he used to hold her, how sweetly he’d kiss her…it seemed almost silly now to backpedal into being friends.
“Do the honors?”
Harry thought so forcefully that Draco might have heard it. “My father was a Death Eater during the First Wizarding War, and Mum joined near the end of the Second, to stay close to us and protect me. Maybe I believed in what we were doing at first. I believed in the ideals, at least.” Draco bowed his head. “I regret every minute I spent with the Death Eaters. But believe me when I say that the reasons I left are far more important than the reasons I joined.”
The pause was heavy with possibility.
“Oh…I kind of tune out when the bell rings,” Harry said sheepishly.
Draco shook his head. “I…I don’t know. Maybe. I think I just need some fresh air.”
As the two owls dove back out the window, Harry unrolled the smaller piece of parchment and read it aloud. “‘Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are hereby invited to The Cambridge Auror Academy Annual Graduation Banquet, taking place from six to nine PM on Wednesday, nineteenth June, along with their class of 2002.’ Class of 2002,” He repeated, grinning. “We did it, Draco!”
The final few minutes of breakfast were spent in scattered, hushed conversation. Harry let the friends carry on, suddenly struck by how much he’d missed having company. Being around Draco was overall pleasant but exhausting at times. Harry found himself glancing across the hall at Ron and Hermione, who seemed engaged in similar discourse with Parvati, Dean, and Seamus. He missed them more than he could possibly articulate - if he’d let himself admit it.
“The fabric’s stuck to me,” Draco said irritably. As he reached to detach himself, his hand accidentally brushed Harry’s neck, and all of a sudden, Harry realized that the Slytherin’s body was indecently close to his - he could feel the heat coming from him through the layers of their uniforms. Draco seemed to have realized their proximity as well; he bit his lip subconsciously, then remembered that they were in a crowded classroom and immediately rolled away, stood up quickly, and adjusted his robes.
“Thanks,” Draco mumbled, though who he was thanking, he wasn’t sure. He looked around for mint, spotted a patch nearby, and quickly plucked a few sprigs. “
•   •   •
Harry hears Justin’s voice, echoing about the room. He glances at him, but the young man slouches, typing away, mouth not moving.
“Absolutely not.” Anubis turned her stern gaze on the younger wizards. “You’ve done your job. I suggest that you
Ice shards as sharp as knives flashed through the rain in hundreds, straight towards Harry. “No!” Someone screamed, and whether it was Draco himself or Dahlia, he didn’t know, only watched as Harry’s body was torn to pieces…
“You’re still sweaty,” Draco observed.
“So, um…” Harry began cautiously as they headed toward the Tower. “Is-is there a word for a feeling that’s greater than friendship?”
"Fascinating," She muttered, dropping it back into Harry's shirt. "Has it warmed up yet?"
In front of her stood another woman, her hair braided, her blouse a familiar shade of crimson.
“Jo-anne Clarke.” Amélie Vernier dragged out the name with grandeur as she plopped onto the cafeteria bench, next to her twin brother, Max.
“Maybe so. But I’m your idiot.” Harry wrapped his arms around him, and Draco let him.
Joanne raised an eyebrow at this vague explanation, but she nodded. “In that case, call me Joey. It’s what my friends call me.”
“I’m not afraid of my enemy’s weapon,” Joey had said softly as she held a gun to her partner’s head.
Draco smirked triumphantly, but then he envisioned Potter’s frown at his sharp behavior. “Thank you,” He added politely, and the Healer threw him a curious look over his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Harry seemed relieved for the break. He tapped the first photo, an image of two people embracing on church steps. One was a woman with thick brown hair, wearing an intricate, flowing white gown with lacy detailing. The other was a tall, lanky, redheaded bloke, who wore an expression that said,
Draco looked at him then, their faces close. “Oh? And why might one say that?”
“All right,” Molly closed her eyes and furrowed her brow. After a moment, small purple blooms, followed by green stems, edged out of the vase’s top. A small bunch of irises unfurled, opening in glorious violet bursts. “How pretty!”
“Who…are you?” Joey croaked, veins bulging against her neck with effort. “What do you want from us?”
is an order of animals, not a family. Number three is
“Tried the incantation yet?” Harry asked.
“He still hates me,” Draco remarked resentfully as he poured hot water. “You’d think he’d gotten over one little spat from ages ago.”
” Draco stutters, his pronunciation unpracticed.
“Um…” Joey’s brow furrowed. “I don’t think so. Should they?”
“I agree,” Harry said, and he turned to his companion, whose brows were knitted together in worry. “Ron and Hermione will be fine with it, sooner or later. Ginny was.”
that’s been happening, but friends share what’s going on in their lives.”
After Harry’s conversation with Professor Dahlia a few days ago, Draco Malfoy had vanished from the halls of Hogwarts. At first, Harry thought Draco was avoiding him specifically, but Harry had asked Pansy if the other Slytherins had seen him, and she admitted they hadn’t. Even more perplexing, Draco had taken his trunks but left most of his possessions. Was he traveling? Had he fled?
“Anything related to him at all, really.”
“It’s easy,” Luna said airily. “Just…Lose yourself to it.” Bobbing her head to the music, she lifted her arms, closed her eyes, and swayed into the crowd, her yellow blending into the rainbow.
“I did think it was strange,” Hermione relented, “But I’ve been thinking…maybe we jumped to conclusions. It would be hard for Malfoy to keep the charade up for all this time. Maybe they just genuinely like each other.”
“I’m transgender,” Joey said with difficulty, and it was difficult because no matter how much she knew it was true, she’d grown accustomed to what came next. The confusion, the outright horror that accompanied that word when other people heard it, the names and poisonous labels. Her eyes had dipped to the table despite her best efforts. “I had every right not to tell you, but... I’m telling you now.”
But then, Joey had taken the time to listen to Draco’s story. She realized, now, her awful mistake, that despite Draco’s past wrongs, she had no right to hold his life in the balance. Still, Joey had no intention of letting the cold steel go, either in the barrel of the gun or in her own heart. So, she loaded its chambers and promised herself to pull it only to protect someone. No more threats, no more force. Joey had nearly become her worst enemy tonight.
“Scared, Potter?”
Joey nodded. “It was, in a way. It would have been much more fun if I hadn’t been fighting for my life more than half the time.
“This is the killer running loose a continent away. Light will always rise against the darkness, no?”
“By the power vested in me by the English Ministry of Magic, under the eyes of the law and the gods you choose to worship, I now pronounce you wed.” A third thread wound around their hands, and all three glowed gold. “You may kiss the bride.”
“We’ll be there if anything happens,” Ginny said fiercely. “We won’t let anyone hurt you.”
Draco rolled his eyes, and the familiar gesture showed Harry that he had relaxed a bit. “Of course not, Potter. We’re not stupid.”
He almost said but held his tongue. Harry knew how Draco felt about public displays of affection - Merlin forbid he say something so sentimental, even in front of only Luna and Ginny.
Beneath it all, like any city with a mix of old and new, hummed magic. Powerful, urgent magic, as if all the inhuman creatures dwelling in the hidden corners were waiting for more fearsome beasts to grab them.
“Stop me if I get something wrong,” Harry told Draco. “During the holidays, Draco received a letter from Narcissa Malfoy…”
The sliding glass door of the compartment suddenly opened with a bang. Ginny’s face was slightly flushed, her chest puffed out in righteous anger.
“You’re not British?” Harry asked, bemused. Her accent was near-flawless Londoner.
“Okay. Yeah, that’s fine.”
is told chiefly through Harry Potter’s perspective, so I had to take Draco Narcissa Malfoy, once a post-preppy femme and now a rainbow-haired, indecisive extraordinaire, and view him through rose-colored glasses. Combine that with the late 2000s small town setting, and the story became a bit of a challenge, at least compared to the southeast Asian, gore-lined Auror quest fic I’d been (and still am!) working on.
Are you happy, my little dragon?]
Pansy tosses her hair over her shoulder, though it’s not long enough to have the desired effect. “I have ten years to catch up.”
“Nothing that we haven’t seen before,” Justin replies. “Erasing a memory in a snap isn’t natural. The brain is bound to rebel.”
Harry slowed, shivering in the sudden cold, turning to look behind him, but the tangle of trees was too thick. It was Joey’s turn to yank him, her words garbled in a cold, hopeless haze. Where was Draco? Why wasn’t he with them? Tears threatened to spill from Harry’s eyes; the dementors were closing in.
Yes, there it was, sneakily spiraling up the Ravenclaw goalpost. It would be hard for Harry to safely get to it, especially since Gryffindor was going more on the offensive. Draco clapped politely when his boyfriend’s team scored, ignoring the dirty looks he got from other Slytherins, who were there simply to heckle. “Forward, Potter,” He muttered, knowing Harry wouldn’t hear him, but miraculously, his broom dipped in the right direction.
“I don’t doubt your beau will have similar questions,” Connors said gruffly. “Take this while I revive him.” She handed Draco a pink vial of Energy Draught.
Harry was almost afraid to follow. He took another breath of the heavy air to prepare himself and Apparated to the foyer.
As Dahlia arrived, chaos broke across the clearing. She and nearly a dozen Aurors emerged from the forest, meeting the red-robed wizards in swift attack. Draco saw hardly any familiar faces - he took this to mean that these were senior Aurors with years of experience under their belts.
“Yes, I suppose it is,” Draco’s chin tilted upwards proudly. “They’ll die if you take them out, unfortunately. But the spells I placed should last a long while.”
“Thank you,” He managed. They looked pleasing, standing together; he was the midnight sky to her daylight.
Deciding this strange turn of events demanded his attention more than the smoky smell coming through the door, Harry said, “Sorry, I…Ron, can we…?”
“He’s been cursed,” Harry cut in when Draco stopped.
“I’m going to get changed,” Harry says. “Just um…be careful. Lots of things to trip over in here.”
Harry looked up from their Potions textbook and peered into the cauldron. “…Neither?” He offered, shrugging. “Fuchsia? I dunno.”
Harry sighed heavily and flipped through
Joey realized she was standing nose to the grate, hands hanging limp at her sides. “Yes,” she mumbled, too preoccupied with her thoughts to apologize as she stepped out of the lift.
Draco looked around to see that all the Weasley kids, plus Harry, Hermione, and Luna, sported similar garments. An expression of exceptional gratitude and pleasure spread across his face, and he pulled the sweater on immediately. “Thank you, Mrs. Weasley,” He said, and Harry thought he glimpsed tears in the Slytherin’s eyes. “That reminds me…I’ll be right back.” Draco stood and briskly left the room, and his footsteps were heard bounding up seven flights.
“As you like it,” Malfoy said stiffly, sitting next to Harry, across from the other two.
Ray nodded gravely. He touched the sides of the basin, shaping it into a closed, narrow container. “How do you feel?”
Pale purple heather, viridescent basil, snow-white carrot blossoms, the dark blush in Harry’s cheeks. Color bloomed in the scenery, and Draco finally started to let himself believe the words from his lover’s lips, persuasive as they were.
“You’d look pretty with or without a scar,” Harry commented, then blushed as he realized what he said.
“Ron and Hermione? I don’t know,” Harry sighed, uncovering his head as well. “I want to believe that they will. For my sake, at least. But you…”
“I suppose.” Draco reached into his robes for his wand. “We had a lot of Dark creatures on our - on the Death Eater side. They didn’t let me on the front lines often, so I did a lot of healing. I don’t know if I’m better than the average wizard, though.”
Draco, who’d been slumped against the window, looked up irritably. “Don’t involve me in your little…” He waved his hand about. “Spat.”
“Your life’s more important than your modesty right now,” Draco told her firmly. “Harry can turn around if you like.”
“It’s going to be fine,” Harry reassured him, but his words sounded hollow. “Your paper’s really well done, and your grades are perfect. There’s no way they won’t let you in.” He knew that getting into Cambridge wasn’t what Draco worried about, but he couldn’t think of anything else to say.
“The teleportation potion.”
Harry waved away the blunder with one large, sun-dark hand. “Well, I’m always up for a challenge. In any case, I’m glad you came to me directly. Most people would push the work on an assistant who can’t make head or tail of the thing they’re having me sign.” He sounded almost impressed, eyes gazing straight into Draco’s with an X-ray-like quality.
In no time, two sides had formed: George, Ron, and Hermione stood on one side of the yard while Harry, Draco, and Ginny held their ground on the other. Luna drifted between teams, giggling whenever snow got in her hair and making snow angels.
Buttered toast and steaming mugs of coffee separate two people on opposite sides of the tiny dining table. Draco, crunching, doesn’t even look at Harry as he reaches into his pocket. Harry’s hand clenches, relaxes, and he watches it, wondering how long he and Draco had been growing apart for. If he saw the signs this early, could they have fixed things?
“You seemed comfortable.”
Beyond that, I doubt I’ll be writing anything full-length, but oneshots set in the same universe are definitely a possibility.
“Voldemort,” Harry said.
Harry realized. He had to move on, as much as possible.
“Does she know where the Owlery is?” Harry wondered aloud.
The scent of ginger soon filled the air as Harry steeped tea in a couple of mugs. Draco took a dose of potion, washed the remaining gel from his hair, brushed his teeth, and immediately felt better.
“You’ve been telling them too many stories,” Draco scolded, glaring at his lover before pulling Teddy from their imaginary stage by the scruff of their robes. “You got my eye color wrong, by the way.”
A spirited Hufflepuff with wide eyes the color of the ocean and a faint Irish accent leaped in front of them. It took Harry a moment to place her name: Erin.
opens. Harry lets out a sigh as the pain of a headache throbs in his temples. He won’t be looking forward to this conversation.
"Good morning, children," Professor Slughorn greeted them as a dozen students walked in. He stood in front of his desk, hands crossed over his portly frame. "Ah, well, I should say, young
“I was trying to get you alone.”
“Yes, I was, but… I’m fine. I was thinking-” A loud scraping noise and an almighty jerk beneath their feet caught Harry off balance, and he teetered on the edge of a step as the flight of stairs began to move, swinging to the opposite side of the building. Draco, smartly holding onto the banister, swiftly placed a hand on the small of Harry’s back, steadying him. The touch filled Harry with warmth, but it disappeared as quickly as it had come, and Draco smoothly withdrew his hand, acting as if nothing had happened. “Thanks,” Harry murmured, his voice hidden by the surprised screams and gasps of younger students as the staircase came to an abrupt halt.
sort of rude of him to talk over Professor Dahlia. Though I agreed with what he said, of course. Regardless, I think Harry wouldn’t mind time alone with you after that little outburst,” She told Draco meaningfully.
“That’s that, then,” Ron yawned, inching towards the stairs, “I want to try out that new thingamajig George gave me-”
Outside, a particularly loud crack of thunder startled all three men and caused the hut to shake slightly. Athena woke for a moment, clicking her beak worriedly for a few seconds before tucking her head back down.
“I overheard something interesting just now,” She said casually.
“Way to change the subject,” Harry muttered under his breath.
“Don’t I know it,” she replied, voice fading as the door closed behind him. Draco turned on the spot, and when the blackness faded away, he emerged in a crowd.
“I bought it in Diagon Alley the other day,” Draco explained, “And then I charmed it. Think of your favorite flowers while holding it.”
[Translations from Thai:
Draco pressed his lips into a line, unwilling to apologize. Connors did not seem irked at this; she pressed on.
“Stay right here,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s hand. “I’ll make you some tea, okay? And we’ll get you healed up.”
“Oh, sure, Just Harry,” Cassandra giggled, “And please, call me Cass.” She winked flirtatiously.
“What?”
“No problem.”
“Who’s the one to
The chairs began to fill with more and more redheads, as well as familiar faces from Hogwarts: Oliver Wood, Lee Jordan, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and other Quidditch players were huddled while whispering to each other. Angelina held a swathe of red fabric that Harry could only guess were Quidditch robes, tears rolling off her cheeks in waves.
Joey wanted to grab Harry by the shoulders and shake some sense into him. Instead, she sighed, rubbing her face. “Consider this, Harry: Maybe Draco doesn’t want to be found.” Harry opened his mouth to argue, and Joey talked over him. “He can take care of himself. He doesn’t need a babysitter.”
“I know that,” Draco said quietly, and Joey blinked, taken aback by the sudden softness in his eyes. “I know that better than anyone.”
Draco nibbled his lip, then placed the letter gingerly on the counter. “All right.”
Shame’s hot sting pricked at Draco’s eyes before he could stop it. All his years as a child, he’d groveled, bent himself over backward, hidden his own emotions, to please his father. And where had it gotten them? Draco miserably marked with evil and Lucius in prison. All his efforts were worthless.
Draco took another sip, then shook his head, focusing on the matter at hand. “Anyway, who
“Yes,” Hermione replied, a faint blush dusting her cheeks. “Um, if that’s all right with you, Harry? Just the two of us?”
Draco grabbed Harry’s wrist as he made to pour the cubes. “Don’t you dare.”
Harry hummed in affirmation, the vibrations making Draco’s fingers clamp the side of the desk. The rhythm increased. Draco felt his dick twitching - shit, he was going to come…but he had to keep his eyes open…he wanted to see if the indomitable Harry Potter would choke…
“Well, I - um.” His face felt warm. “Yes.”
“What do you mean, Draco?” Harry asked quietly.
The next week passed with agonizing slowness as they waited anxiously for a reply. Pigwidgeon, the fluffy grey feather ball within Ron’s and Ginny’s joint custody, delivered the small letter in only a couple of days, but came back empty-handed - or rather, empty-beaked. When Harry returned the owl to Ron with an expression of gratitude, Draco only stood silently by, his face waxy and disquieted from the lack of a responding letter.
The lively, tense conversation slammed into a dead end. For once, Draco was stumped, and looking at his colleagues’ faces, he reckoned they were, too. It seemed that their enemies’ intentions were just as masked as their faces.
As the trio walked, Joey felt pairs of eyes following them - no, following
“The truth is… I’m gay.”
Harry shakes his head vehemently. “Never.”
Draco gave him a curious look. “I never thought anyone would use that word to describe me.”
“If they’re well-behaved.”
for another human being? This is astounding! Luna, are you seeing this?”
“You’re no son of mine.”
"What's that letter for?" Ginny's brown eyes zeroed in on the envelope in Harry's hand.
“Hey, that’s cheating,” George pointed out, already molding another snowball. “No magic allowed.”
“You’re blue, like a blueberry.” The words are robotic, recited, nothing like they sounded the day Harry spoke them.
Draco, who was not used to being addressed thus, flushed red. He opened his mouth to argue, thought better of it, and pushed past Hyacinthe to enter.
Harry laughed, catching Joey’s eye, and she nearly smiled.
Light gray fog swirled thickly below, rising slowly. Condensation began to collect on Harry’s glasses, and he muttered a spell to clear them. Fiona’s black eyes squinted through the sky, and she flew forward purposefully. Harry trailed carefully after her in case she had spotted the Snitch, but it turned out to be a false alarm, and he continued scanning their surroundings.
Draco eyed the towering, haphazard structure with a mix of criticism and bewilderment. The Weasley’s abode was vastly different from his own family’s lavish estate, and Ron detected Draco’s instinctual disdain at once.
Joey nodded, tilting her chin up bravely, though Draco could tell by her flitting eyes that she was not keen to put herself in danger again. “I agree.”
Ron actually yelped at Luna’s appearance at his elbow, which was sudden enough to startle. “Hello, Ron,” Luna said, quite unperturbed at his reaction. “Harry, Hermione.”
“I’ll start on that side, I suppose,” Harry told Draco with a shrug, nodding to the robes, and the teens drifted to different parts of the store.
•     •     •
He glanced down at Harry’s lips before leaning forward and catching them with his own. Long fingers brushed Harry’s jaw and entangled themselves in his jet-black hair, tugging him ever closer. Draco’s lips, dry yet soft, parted, and their tongues met with all the clumsiness and vigor of teenage desire. Harry’s senses became overwhelmed with Draco, who smelled of flowers and musky undertones of sweat and the recent bonfire.
Hermione took a deep breath, squeezing Ron’s hands. “Ron…If you told me eleven years ago that I would be marrying you, I probably would have hit you with a book and told you to shut up.” Ron chuckled at that. “I used to think that we were opposites in every way. I used to think you hated me and that we would never even be friends. But look where we are now.” She grinned, eyes crinkling as they gazed into Ron’s. “I guess I have a stray troll and a brave best friend to thank for that.” She exchanged a companionable glance with Harry. “These past few years have been interesting, to say the least, and I’m relieved and happy to have spent them with you. You’re the kindest, most compassionate, thoughtful person I’ve ever met, Ron. I’m grateful for every precious second I’ve spent being your friend. And I hope that we can spend many more together.”
“All right.” Theodore shoved his hands in his pockets. “Hey - thanks, Malfoy. I mean that.”
to understand.”
“You look so pretty, darling,” Luna cooed, pressing a kiss to Ginny’s lips. She turned to the others, smiling dreamily. “You all, too.”
Without thinking, Harry raises a hand, and his fingertips brush Draco’s forehead as he pushes the hair back into place. The silence that follows between them is louder than the crowd. Draco’s eyes flash in anger, then surprise, then his lips part.
One night, Harry stands near the pullout couch, both hands resting on the windowsill. It must be past midnight; he spots only two cars, on either side of the intersection, soon pulling out of sight, their headlights dim in the blur of snow.
As the door swung open into the deserted hallway, Draco’s heart sped up at the promise of sneaking around with Harry. As much as he disliked hiding, there was something indescribably thrilling about doing something they weren’t supposed to, walking briskly down the hallway after hours, the torchlight flickering across Harry’s face, hands entwined. They found an empty classroom soon enough and slipped inside, Harry laughing and Draco shushing him as he locked the door with his wand.
“Yeah, could you imagine caring about who dates who?” Harry said dryly.
. And repeat.”
Ron’s mouth hung open, and his expression had grown dreamy. “You’re brilliant,” He stated softly.
"Fred Weasley, you will be missed. By a whole lot of people. But you're not gone. Not while your memory lives on." George stepped out from behind the podium and sat down, wiping at his eyes.
Harry curiously looks upwards, then back down to the scene. The Justin Finch-Fletchley in Harry’s head still isn’t speaking, concentrating as he places a painted clay dragon on the table. Draco loved making them.
It’s nothing new, so it really shouldn’t shake him like it does. The family deserved their fallen grace after the War, after centuries of bribery and hatred. A single bead of nervous sweat rolls down his side.
He counts down in his head, examining his nails idly: three…two…
It’s a decent plan, but in the post-war chaos, he’s forgotten one important, infuriating detail: Potter’s chronic nosiness.
In reality though, he’s alone in the bathroom, surrounded by solitude so crushing he can barely breathe. The overwhelming need to destroy tears through his veins.
True to his word, once Potter is discharged the next day, Draco marches him straight to McGonagall’s office and pushes him in. “Go.”
“Fuck you,” she says.
He just gapes, like Weasley when he’s called on in Potions. “What?”
And so, Pansy is still the only person aware of Draco’s self-inflicted injuries, and he’s willing to keep it that way.
Four hours pass and he’s in front of the bathroom mirror.
Granger probably just tried to nag him into submission. What Potter needed was a real push, a physical one.
There’s blood.
Problem: his limbs are shaking and it takes most of his effort to stand upright, to hold himself together instead of tearing off his skin.
He pulls his sleeves back down when they slide up as he raises his arms to drink. He chases away Pansy’s concerned looks with a joke. He ignores the empty space where Vincent used to sit. It’s almost like nothing’s changed.
get the joke. Draco’s face, if possible, grows even hotter.
“But… what about-”
Cautiously, he peeks one eye open, then the other. The sight that meets his eyes leaves a gasp stuck in his throat, painfully lodged there until tears prick behind his eyes. “What have you done to yourself?” he whispers.
A part of him is reminded of his Sectumsempra scars, but he pushes the rising bitterness away. The scars look different, somehow, when they’re on another person.
On days like these, he remembers the Fiendfyre: all-consuming, a roaring wave of terror so hot his eyes burned. The sight of his own body, falling into a fiery snake’s mouth had flashed before his eyes, almost like a prophecy. But then: a single hand, outstretched and sweaty, and cold air rushing into his lungs.
The implications of Potter’s statement seem to dawn on him after a moment. “Oh, um,” he scrambles as if to adjust his glasses, but his arms are still bound to his sides, and he ends up flopping around like a fish. “Not that I was stalking you. Obviously.”
Eighth year: scratching and picking and cutting.
“Granger. Weasley,” he says, and they stop. They’re three steps above him, and he has to look up at them awkwardly. “Is - where’s Potter?”
Except-
The deadliness in his voice is diminished by the shaking of his shoulders, but he doesn’t care. As long as Potter sits there, pinning him down with his hesitant looks and frowns, Draco’s lungs won’t fill with air.
Draco seriously can’t tell if Potter’s getting the joke or not.
“Sometimes you just say things, Potter,” Draco drawls, “as if everyone else finds them normal too.”
Rationally, he knew other people would notice. Morbid curiosity and the need to judge always drew people’s eyes to his left arm. Potter’s realization was inevitable.
Potter scratches the back of his neck. “Oh! Uh, no, Neville did, actually.”
“Hilarious,” Potter responds drily. His eyes flicker awkwardly to Pansy, but she raises an eyebrow in response and doesn’t budge. “Right, um.” He clears his throat awkwardly.
“Whore,” he responds, and now he’s crying too. “I’m sorry.”
“Did Granger help you with this?” he asks. Pansy snorts beside him.
“Puns are tacky,” he scoffs, but the effect is ruined by his scarlet cheeks. “Wait, did you say he’s been following me?”
“We make quite a sight,” Draco says faintly. “All cut up and shit.”
“There, he’s all ready for you now, Draco!” Her voice is a suggestive sing-song, and he shoots her a look as sharp as broken glass. She’s flouncing back to the castle before he even gets the chance to strangle her.
“I didn’t think you did, Potter,” he says, then rethinks. “Actually, no, you definitely do, but that’s not the point. Either you’re following me around because you think I’m going to bring the next Dark Lord into the castle, or your bizarre Gryffindor senses are tingling again and you think if you don’t rescue me your dick will fall off.”
Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans - the novelty of those wore off by fourth year - and when Draco pulls out his money to pay, Harry pushes his arm down.
“They stopped healing, alright?”
, not because Potter told him to, but purely because he was bored. “Are you gonna tell me why you’re following me or am I gonna have to steal your wand? Like you stole mine.” Spite forces the last line out. He only half regrets it. If Pansy were here, she’d roll her eyes and call him petty, but she isn’t, so he mentally applauds himself.
The anger he’s grown accustomed to since their Hogsmeade weekend is gone in Potter’s slumber. He’s drooling a little, with his wild hair splayed across the pillow. What really draws Draco’s attention, though, is the blood on the white sheets.
His torso is shredded with long scars, over his chest, his upper arms, his stomach; every inch of his skin that could be hidden under a shirt seems to be scarred over. Directly over his heart is one shining, red, oval. Draco’s chest aches at the violence of it, of something long dead but still visible. If there’s any anger left in Draco now, it leaves in the form of a long, shuddering breath.
Silence stretches between them, expanding with every second. “Malfoy, I don’t have a hero complex,” Potter responds dully. Draco wonders if they’re dancing around the real meanings of their words on purpose. He’s not sure he even knows what they
“So I could be your fucking charity case,” he snaps. “Or maybe so you don’t tell the whole school I’m plotting murder again. Yeah, I said it. We both know what happened.” He steps towards Potter, towering over him. He’d forgotten how short Potter really was. It always felt like he was below him, always a few steps behind. “Is that why you’re always around, acting nice? Trying to catch me in the act?”
“Why don’t you heal them?” she hissed, still taking in the sight of his scarred upper body with something akin to horror.
are the only words he can make out from his angle, and he doesn’t even want to read the rest of the headline. Naturally, he scoots closer so he can see.
“It’s going to scar,” Draco calls out unprompted. “My head. I’ll be hideous. Do tell me Potter, how do you deal with it?”
Potter flounders for a moment, as if he’s been knocked off course, but he regathers himself. “Why did you come then?” The question is buried underneath a mountain of anger, but the words are tame. Draco’s smothered by the question.
Pansy knows, of course. She’d figured it out in Sixth Year, when she visited him in the hospital wing after the
He clears his throat. “Oh.”
“-you’re always going off alone to random places, and it’s hot as hell out but you only wear long sleeves and-” He’s cut off by Draco’s sharp intake of breath.
He slams the door shut behind Potter and nods in satisfaction. He shakes his head, thinking to himself as he walks back to the dungeons. There’s no doubt Granger tried to get him treatment, but was too Gryffindor about it. That was the thing about Gryffindors: they were too
Harry felt so happy that he could die - but he didn’t want to. He wanted to live forever, not just at this moment, but in the minutes and hours and decades after and before, in the garden, in the kitchen, at Hogwarts, over bridges, and under the stairs, by the window as the sun shone and thunder raged.
he needed, but he was determined to help.
"The wrong thing?" Harry regarded the empty space with a raised eyebrow. "So, you didn't really mean to be a prat all those years?"
Lost in his own thoughts, as he often was, Harry gave a start once he noticed Luna at his elbow. “Oh! Good morning, Luna.”
“Good. I shall wait eagerly by the telephone,” Draco exclaims dramatically. He slams the door, gives a friendly wave, then promptly bounds back inside.
“We’re
“I add my own love to the history of people who have loved beautiful things, and looked out for them, and pulled them from the fire, and sought them when they were lost…” - Donna Tartt,
With a silken rustle of emerald sheets, Harry slipped into bed and took off his glasses, setting them on the nightstand. The night cradled him in its embrace, and he inched towards unconsciousness, hoping for no dreams but expecting nightmares. But sleep was a long time coming, his mind unable to keep off the grey-eyed boy only a few feet away.
Draco, who had fallen silent, stared at the ground, his face utterly blank. The rest of the students stayed in place, not leaving the Slytherin behind but equally reluctant to defend him. Cold anger reared its head within Harry’s chest - hadn’t McGonagall began the year with a speech mentioning inter-house friendship?
Luna smiles, embracing him. The two, entangled in the warmth of their joint solitude, are oblivious to a wretch’s world crumbling a few feet away.
?” Pansy asks, wandering back in with a glass of red wine.
He held the word to his chest like a precious jewel, falling asleep with a smile still lingering on his lips.
“Sounds good,” Ron agreed.
Draco doesn’t hear him. He stumbles in, trembling legs in skinny black jeans, olive-green shirt partially unbuttoned. He’s flushed, pink cheeks and reddened chest, grey eyes ringed in red. Draco runs a shaking hand through his pale blue hair, though it’s already so mussed that it doesn’t make a difference.
might be the Chosen One, but he’s still got a dead Mudblood for a mother.”
“I outed you without your blessing,” Harry said guiltily. “I’m sorry.”
They watched the rabbit sniff about in the vegetation, its ears and fluffy tail twitching with its movements. Harry and Draco remained stone-still, trying not to scare it, but the animal eyed them beadily, froze in place, then resolutely bounded away.
“Yeah, of course! Follow me.” Erin turned and strolled away, weaving between the tables and moving crowd of students.
“I have no reason to give it.”
Harry was quiet for a moment. His thumbs brushed gently over Draco’s knuckles. “For three years, I thought you were ready. I thought you wanted this. I’m not accusing you of anything, I just….”
“Patronuses, Harry, remember?” Hermione said, gesturing exasperatedly. “Professor Dahlia mentioned it at the end of class last time.”
“Let’s check out the new sweets,” Ginny suggested, and Harry followed her to the wall of glass drawers that held all the different kinds of candy.
“I wouldn’t use these after lunch,” Harry advises as they enter the front stairwell, footsteps echoing loudly. “It gets too crowded.” He leans over Malfoy’s shoulder, momentarily distracted by his perfume. It’s musky, subtle, as if Malfoy had spritzed himself with his father’s cologne rather than doused himself in Eau de Cheap Flowers, as Harry finds schoolgirls are wont to do. “Take these instead,” Harry continues, pointing at the map, “Otherwise you’ll…”
•   •   •

“Yes, please.” Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and kissed him. His lips tasted faintly of sweet firewhiskey, and Draco let out an involuntary sigh, slipping a hand into his hair, thumb brushing against his unshaven face.
Dao’s power was waning. Harry felt it, felt sure that if there were no dementors around, he could break through her spell, make a desperate leap for their wands and potions, buy more time for Joey.
Pansy groans, throwing a cushion at Justin, who catches it right before it knocks over his beer can. “Hey, watch it,” He says seriously. “This equipment isn’t cheap, you know.”
(c. September 2020) I want to take this time to thank everyone who's kept up with WTSC so far. It's been nearly a year since I started publishing! It's harder to work on this fic now that I've started the IB, but I'll do my best :)
? You just keep it on you at all times? That’s… that’s bloody insane!”
,” Dahlia coaxed, and Draco realized she was speaking Thai, but he could understand every word. “
“Er…” Harry glanced at Draco, read him perfectly, and replied, “Maybe later.”
“Dropped this,” Henrietta said, picking up a folded sheaf of parchment.
Harry shrugs, trying to come off as nonchalant. “Maybe.”
“Tabitha and Cass?”
Draco took a deep breath. “Okay.” He blew out his sage, the sparks fading. “Leave it by the door,” He told Harry, and they set their bundles at the edge of the threshold.
“Potter, don’t even
Draco glanced away from Hermione, taking a peek at Ron. His mouth had fallen open, blue eyes wide with awe at the sight of his future wife. Draco had never been as close to Ron and Hermione as Harry was, but as the smiling couple joined hands beneath the fragrant trellis, Draco felt a swell of sympathetic joy for the both of them.
“Hello, Mr. Potter.” Luna smiles dreamily, leaning against the receptionist’s table that has somehow squeezed itself into the small room. “How are you this morning?”
“Blimey, you sound like Hermione,” Ron remarked, genuinely concerned at this proof of their similarities.
“You wouldn’t happen to be related to Charon, would you?” Harry asked, apparently thinking the same thing Draco was.
“I knew you’d get pissed off,” Ginny was saying, her forehead scrunching in dismay.
Professor Dahlia looked back and forth between the boggart and her student, realizing their resemblance. She raised her wand as a safeguard.
Professor Slughorn patted Draco on the shoulder, which the young man flinched at. "Of course you do, m'boy. And now," He continued, addressing the whole class. "One per pair must administer the potion to the other. Er…Misses Patil, you should trade partners with Blake and Roswell. The effects will be too, ah, disastrous between siblings. There we are. Take just a sip, everyone. We wouldn't want half the class clinging to the other
[Translations from French:
Draco had no idea what this mysterious Faraday woman looked like, but his gaze flicked to the window anyway, absently trailing over the summer-dressed Muggles that strolled and drove past.
did Harry choose that slimy, no-good Slytherin? Besides being straight as a white oak wand, Ron didn’t know Malfoy terribly well - not that he wanted to - so he couldn’t say he was attractive. His personality was awful, to say the least. True, he did become a bit nicer this year…
“Bunny,” Harry whispered, nudging Draco.
“It really is too bad. Malfoy’s a pretty good Seeker.”
Draco was too tired to feel angry as he watched his classmate leave. He caught his breath, grabbed a towel from the side of the arena, and slung it over his neck, wiping the sweat off and resisting the instinct to cover his scars.
Joey, Draco, and Harry - still sore about being useless for the entire fight - sat huddled in fresh clothes around a cooking fire. A girl, no more than sixteen, stirred a pot of creamy, white fish curry over the flames. She’d introduced herself as Chanlina and let them in when she saw they’d gotten rid of the spirit.
“Think we ought to fill Ron in?” Hermione asked Harry as the three of them lifted their luggage onto the designated rack.
“No time.” Harry flings the door open with one hand and holds Draco with the other. “Jump!”
Harry repeated the phrase in his head while he paced back and forth with his eyes closed. On the third recitation, he opened his eyes to a polished wooden door set in the cobblestone.
As Harry poured them all bowls of soup and rice, Joey spread the mission notes over the kitchen counter. Charon added a map on top of it, detailing the labyrinthic streets of underground Manila. He took out a surprisingly thin, delicate wand and began to trace glowing, colored lines upon the inked parchment.
“She had purple eyes. Like shattered glass,” said Draco. “I don't suppose this was…?”
Astoria made an apologetic face, then tapped her wrist. Draco looked at his own watch, then cursed. He gestured for Astoria to come in, pulling off his gloves.
“Well-worded, Hermione. Three points to Gryffindor.” Dahlia nodded approvingly. “Yes, that’s more or less what I’m getting at. Humans, Muggle or no, inherently have light and dark parts, our wistful hopes and tendency to kindness constantly at war with our nightmares and thirst for revenge.” Professor Dahlia swept her wand through her Patronus, which dissipated, leaving the chamber slightly darker. “As magic users, we are able to channel our souls, in their entirety, through our wands. But we cannot treat this responsibility lightly. Let your lightness, your kindness, shine through your magic. ‘Cast with compassion,’ as one of my own teachers used to say. Because doing the opposite can have destructive results.” Her warm eyes landed on someone. “Draco, would you like to share your thoughts on this?”
“It’s the Ministry. They’re mental,” Draco said with a shrug. “Ooh, Muggle skincare coupons.” He set those aside. “Congratulations card from Dudley. I suppose he does read our letters, after all.” Draco arrived at a slate-gray envelope, labeled with a typewriter-printed address. “Marisa Brighton-Ortega.”
Fear throttled Draco’s heart involuntarily, and he soon realized why - Joey looked a bit like an Inferi, a corpse being brought back to life. Harry made a slight noise of alarm, hand reaching in his pocket for a wand that wasn’t there.
“Nothing that’s any of your business,” Draco replied, letting his wet hair partially cover his face. Harry’s gaze drifted to his bottom lip, which was busted open.
“Why?” Hermione asked.
“You sound like my mother,” Ron grumbled, but he shuffled to the boys’ dormitory anyway.
"Thanks, Mrs. Weasley," Harry replied, his chair scraping back as he sat down next to Ron. He looked towards George, wanting to say some words of comfort but having no idea what to say.
“Pansy,” Henrietta chided weakly, but she didn’t step forward, still eyeing Draco and Harry as if they were about to explode.
“This isn’t so ordinary anymore. I’ve changed it.” Dahlia sighed heavily. “I killed someone, only once. Something good came out of it, if you’ll believe it.”
For once, Harry did not feel the instinct to search for Draco’s white-blond head within the crowd. He felt, for the moment, satisfied and fulfilled with just Ron and Hermione’s company, though their hands were entwined and his empty. Harry wanted to fool himself for a little while longer, telling himself that he didn’t need Draco - it’d be safer for them if they found other, more suitable partners. But at the same time, Harry knew the tug of his heartstrings would overcome logic, just as it always had, and he’d be in Draco’s arms at nightfall. Harry only hoped he’d never have to choose between his two friends and the former Death Eater - he wasn’t sure he could.
“I’ve forgiven you.”
“M’kay. I’ll just go grab some stuff. Wait here.” Draco opens the door, leaves his jacket on the seat.
“We didn’t go as far as Thailand,” Hermione said, then gave their teacher a curious look. “How did you know about the Horcruxes?”
“There are much easier ways to do that. Something like,” Harry cleared his throat, raised his voice slightly, and made a haughty face, “‘Potter, I
(See the end of the chapter for
“You think I haven’t forgotten?” Molly chided, whipping out a piece of paper from her robes, “Boxing Day chores, as usual, Ron.”
His relationship with Hermione developed just as quickly; Ron no longer saw her as the bookish know-it-all, nor the plain but friendly girl who paled in comparison to the rest of his peers. If he were honest with himself, Ron would admit that Hermione was not extraordinarily pretty by society’s standards. But with each passing day, both her physical self and her actions seemed beautiful to him. Her delight at learning new things, the way she tucked her thick brown hair behind her ear to read, her soft lips as they pressed against his cheek…Ron couldn’t fathom how he had ever believed Hermione to be anything less than exquisite.
“My parents set me up more times than I care to remember. Only rich pureblooded girls, of course.” Draco’s tone was tinged with bitterness. “We’d go to fancy restaurants like you said, or operas, the theater, typical elitist nonsense. The girls themselves weren’t all bad, I suppose. You know Henrietta Carrow, in our year,” He assumed, and Harry nodded, picturing the pale, freckled Slytherin, “We went out a couple of times in third year, she was all right. Didn’t go on and on like a lot of the others did about the importance of blood. Merlin, they were all obsessed with blood, keeping magic in the old families, and using it to attain money and status.” Draco’s grey eyes were stormy, and Harry was beginning to regret instigating the discussion. “But I’m like them, too. A pureblooded puppet.”
A few eyes strayed to Draco’s left forearm, visible beneath his rolled-up sleeves. He didn’t blame them; moving images of colorful, swaying flowers wasn’t something he’d expected to tattoo on his skin, either. But it was preferable to the alternative, and this way, he could carry a little bit of the Malfoy garden with him.
“What? That I could love someone like him?”
“Pity me.”
“What’s happening?”
“We’ll start first thing in the morning. You need to rest.”
Luckily, most of Hogwarts still attended to breakfast, and their trek remained uninterrupted all the way to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey, spotting a feeble student in the doorway, immediately rushed from her office to aid them.
“There’s only one way to find out,” Draco mutters grimly.
, you will all be awarded a grand prize.”
“Oh…Thanks,” Draco managed a faint smile as he watched Athena nibble at a stale slice of bread.
“Draco!” Harry pulled him away from the dragon, nearing the ledge, and Draco realized that it wasn’t the first time he’d called his name. “The potion!”
How could you do this to me? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME.
"You mean the same thing they’re doing to me?” Harry replied, searching for the end-of-year essay in his satchel. “Pretending like I don’t exist?”
A woman stands at the end of an aisle. She smiles. Perhaps Draco sheds a tear. He’s set the scene up in his mind often, not as a daydream, but as practice. To prepare himself. And each time, his wife has no face.
Draco and Harry both chuckled at that. Draco raised his left arm to wipe away some of Harry’s blood with his sleeve, then he remembered that it had been torn off.
Justin shrugs, his posture slumped and defeated. “We both have a lot to apologize for.” He purses his lips, looks at her like she’s the answer to all his problems. Luna’s suddenly very sure that this is the last time he’ll look at her like that. “Where do we go from here?”
Her eyes shone with love, loyalty. Her hand reached out as if to curl around Dao’s wrist, but Dahlia couldn’t do it. Joey blushed, suddenly feeling like she was seeing and hearing something that ought not to be witnessed.
with you?” Harry exploded, whirling on Joey. “You didn’t even let us explain anything! For fuck’s sake, you had a
“Doctor?” Luna opens the door and pokes her head in.
.” Nothing. Harry clenched his jaw, but he shouldn’t have been surprised. The spell was hard to pull off, even with a wand.
“You’re the one who told me to,” Draco replied irritably. “It’s for emergencies only.”
I really tried to be hardcore and dramatic to some degree in this chapter, but I couldn't resist adding some imagery and bird symbolism...
“For wh-”
George was by far the best gift-giver out of the whole company, delighting his family and friends with customized Weasley’s products. Harry especially loved the model Snitch that spun dizzyingly around his head, disappearing and reappearing whenever it pleased. Ron gave Hermione a gorgeous yet simple silver necklace with a tiny, book-shaped pendant. It was in excellent taste, and both Hermione and Ginny oohed and ahhed over it.
But despite Harry’s discomfort, his gaze was still alight with righteous fire, pupils dilated with adrenaline. Fighting to his last breath on the side of good - whether they liked it or not, that was Harry’s element. That was what he’d been conditioned for since he was a fresh-faced child.
“I could say the same about you and Amélie,” Draco shot back. “You sure you’re not conjoined?”
Too late, he tried to school his expression, but Draco caught the jagged flash of panic across his lover’s face. “What?” Draco demanded, and forgetting his own apprehension, peered over the edge of the parchment.
But even if Draco had convinced Potter to stay with him, why should he oblige? Draco didn’t want his pity - nor did he deserve it. He didn’t even deserve to be here, with the family that the Malfoys had ridiculed and scorned for years.
Patil nods solemnly. “Poof.”
Draco snickered and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, bending his head until their mouths were scarce inches apart. “All right, I get it, Potter.”
Draco wondered, but he knew what it was. Lately, he’d heard those voices in the back of his head again, like his conscience speaking, except that particular voice sounded eerily like- “I saw your lips move for that last Shielding Charm,” Draco said sternly, pushing the thought cleanly from his mind. “Mouthing doesn’t help for a spell that common, Potter. You have to
The shorter, rabbit-masked, shifted uncomfortably, hands clasped at their waist in a position of submission. When they spoke, their voice was soft, every syllable enunciated, every tone pronounced. “Dao. It’s time.”
“Ah.” Harry nods sagely, but he can’t pretend to remember all the football stats Ron makes a point of rattling off any time they’re together. Harry is more interested in the game itself.
“Still, I would not stoop to being friends with seventeen-year-old you,” Draco says firmly. “So, I suppose my question is…have you changed?”
Padma slowly nods. “I think so. We should give it an hour, let it settle into autopilot again.”
“What about us two?” Draco said defensively, and it was with a sinking feeling that Harry remembered he never told him that Luna had found out.
Dao smirked, retrieving a folded newspaper from her pocket. She tossed it onto the concrete, and a bolt of ice shot through Joey as she recognized the mark seething beneath the headline:
“Then why the hell,” Joey picked it up, at least having the foresight not to shake it, “Did you bring it?”
I’m not all right, didn’t you hear them? Didn’t you hear them, Potter?” He looked up, silver eyes hollowed with shame.
As she talked, Draco raised his tankard to his lips, shielding his face from the couple across the table. He gave Harry a questioning glance that clearly said,
“But she wouldn’t.” Harry’s eyes widened, and he lowered his voice. “The Imperious Curse?”
Draco clumsily tossed the lightheaded gnome over the garden wall, and it landed about ten feet away. “Damn,” The Slytherin said, lowering his outstretched arm. Behind him, a group of curious gnomes edged out of the bushes to see what was going on.
“I was thinking,” Harry continued, “They have to make a decision sometime. And I don’t see any reason why Wizengamot would vote against it. It’s not like it affects them.”
Joey was already there, dressed in a plain white blouse and jeans, the edge of her bandages poking out from her collar and short sleeves. Her legs were crossed, and she had been leaning back, but when Harry and Draco entered the room, she stood immediately.
“There.” Draco’s hands fell to Harry’s chest.
“Ready?” Draco asked.
“Sweet. Okay, take a look, everyone,” Professor Dahlia pointed her wand at Owen, who raised his own weapon defensively. “Owen, I want you to Stun me. Go on, right now.”
Out of curiosity, Draco leaned toward his boyfriend, trying to catch his scent. Harry smelled of sweat, soot, and cheap chamomile hotel shampoo. Draco bit back a smile. He could breathe in Harry for hours - in a decidedly not peculiar way.
A fellow Auror-in-training, dressed in violet robes, let out a noise of surprise, leaning their hand against the wall to keep from stumbling.
Draco rolled his eyes irritably. “It’s rather different when you’re in the middle of a constantly moving game, isn’t it?”
“Muggles are so strange,” Draco said as they walked back out into the sunshine.
“Oh, I know,” Draco admits, clumsily maneuvering it between his feet. “That’s why I’m not letting you have it.” He aims a kick, and the ball sails off a good ten yards past the edge of the tattered goal, rolling into the dying grass beyond. “Would you look at that,” He remarks drily, “I ought to play for England.”
“I used to work in potions for a living,” Draco said smoothly. “I would have expected an intra-scale injection.”
Harry sighed sharply, but he joined Draco on the bench.
But seeing as the Gryffindor v. Hufflepuff match was in mid-March, Harry wasn’t all that concerned. “It’ll probably be too warm for it then.”
“My thoughts exactly!” Ginny flashed a smile at him, then made a few marks on her clipboard.
“You poor thing,” Ginny teased. “That the excuse you’re planning to use if Cass catches the Snitch before you do? ‘Oh, Ginny, my hand hurts from writing, I couldn’t get a proper grip,’” She moaned, flopping her limp arm onto the table. Ron laughed, and Hermione’s mouth twitched, but she remained focused on proofreading.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco stand and begin to stumble forward. “What could you possibly have to gain?” He spluttered, keeping Dao’s attention.
“I…” Harry quailed under Ginny’s stare, which was growing more outraged by the minute. He nodded.
to have only one son to pass on the family name? You think I
Somewhere between now and 1995, riddled bodies lay abandoned in the mud, the survivors bleeding as they sprinted out of reach. The children that ran were defenseless.
At one point, a stranger cloaked in midnight-blue came forward and uttered a command. Both the mother and son pulled up their left sleeves. The standing wizard pressed a wand to their forearms in turn. The mother’s mark was flat, pale, and unresponsive. The son’s writhed and smoked, and he winced, but he spoke through the pain.
“Thank goodness for that.” Slowly, Harry slid his hand upward, his thumb brushing the edge of Draco’s ribcage. He leaned forward and began pressing light kisses on Draco’s skin, trailing from his jawline to that gorgeous collarbone. Draco’s breath hitched audibly, and Harry paused. “You okay? Do you want me to stop?” He murmured.
The stranger, a dark-haired boy, ducked his head apologetically. “Pardon me,” He said in perfect English and scurried off before Harry could get a good look at his face. He sounded about Harry’s age - a student, he figured.
. Potter?” He got to his feet unsteadily, then without another moment’s hesitation, he sprinted towards his prone boyfriend.
“No…” Rabbit hadn’t spoken until now, the fear in their voice crumbled their aura of invincibility - they lowered their hands, eyes widening through their mask.
Harry watched this exchange with increasing anxiety. He hadn’t moved, but Draco slowly detangled their limbs, turning to face Pansy. Harry wanted to glance at him to check to see if he was okay, but the possibility of Draco leaving him to protect himself suddenly seemed much too tangible, and he couldn’t bear to consider it. Besides, he felt like he was missing something…the way Henrietta looked at Draco as if she’d betrayed him, Pansy’s knowing smirk. The disaster happening now was bigger than just him and Draco, but Harry couldn’t figure out exactly how.
Harry gave the question a few moments of thought, forcing his busy hands to rest on the counter. He turned to Draco and kissed him, long and soft; both were breathless when he pulled away. “Losing you.”
“Ron! Hermione!”
"It doesn't have anything to do with Voldemort," Harry said, sitting up. The warm colors of Ron's room lit up by the morning sun, put him at ease. "My scar hasn't been hurting. I just keep…reliving the battle in my sleep."
When Harry kissed him, Draco was caught off-guard by the soft press of his mouth, the gentleness that spoke less of needing than he expected. Harry broke off quickly.
“I just wish I could talk to Ron about it,” Harry confessed as they continued on their way, as calm and collected as the rest of the older students, who were used to the castle’s many shenanigans. “He seemed down this morning.”
“Draco Malfoy.” At his name, Caroline immediately stiffened. “He’s another junior Auror I worked with on a mission that ended about a week ago. He attended Cambridge Auror Academy with a focus on potions and healing, yet our mission saw much more combat than intended.”
“You didn’t listen to me,” Draco repeats.
Harry nods in understanding. Dr. Patil presses the record button.
“The last bad one was around September.”
Leaving no room for second thoughts, Harry took the knife from Malfoy’s blood-slicked hand. Malfoy’s chest rose and fell shallowly -
Harry paused for a second, taken aback. “Rhetorical question. I came to apologize for my overreaction to
"He was my second half," George was saying, holding back tears. "His optimism helped us run a joke shop business, even as the world was collapsing. Fred could always see the bright side, and I'm going to continue that legacy. Starting today."
“Does all this cheek mean you feel better?”
“I’ve got something for you,” She says. Draco tilts his head. “Early Valentine’s gift.”
“Hey!” Harry shouts as she bends to kiss Draco’s cheek. He runs towards, them but the couple is lost in their own little world, in each other’s arms. The distance between Harry and Draco lengthens with every step he takes.
“Cool,” Harry breathed, grinning at the setting they had created. He’d never done anything like this before, and guessed Draco hadn’t either - Luna and Hermione were better at the beautiful, subtle works of magic.
Something in those eyes has melted, like silver over a blue-hot flame. “Please leave me alone,” Malfoy mutters, and takes the steps two at a time, vanishing at the top before Harry can gather his wits.
“Are you suggesting I wouldn’t win?” Ginny dared.
“Honestly, I wasn’t expecting presents…” Ron trailed off, his smile shrinking slightly as he spotted someone emerging from the boys’ dormitory.
The hotel’s mezzanine glowed with opulence, even more so than the lobby. Plush, maroon velvet sofas were flanked by gilded end tables on either side, set with bowls of questionable but fragrant potpourri or vases overflowing with flowers. The carpet, soft, patterned with red-and-gold paisley, held the faint, telltale streaks of a vacuum.
“Let’s go look.” Harry slipped his hand into Draco’s, tugging him to the back door. “You can show me all your old hiding places.”
“Oh,” Ginny said, looking a bit dismayed. “Er, well, I suppose you still have some authority. To the younger years, at least. You see, there’s been some incidents recently in the boys’ dormitory - I heard about it from a few classmates. I think a fourth-year got a hold of some bootleg Wheezes products, and they’ve been turning their dorm mates into animals in their sleep by force-feeding them Creature Creams.”
“Am I really that transparent?” Draco groaned, rubbing his temple with one hand.
Harry shuddered, looking wildly around. He must have imagined Draco’s voice - he was a whole country away.
,” Harry intoned, casting the Silencing Charm around them.
“Are we staying there tonight?”
annoying. Oh, they’re over there.” Teddy skipped ahead, arms gleefully swinging by their sides.
“Then I’ll be drunk in peace,” Draco replies, and his voice is still low, and close, hissing like water on hot pavement. He downs the whiskey in one go, shuddering as it sears his throat. The crowd shifts abruptly as another party crowds in, and Draco’s suddenly pressed against Harry, face nearly buried against his neck.
Draco wrung his hands as Harry’s quill began to scrawl across the parchment. “I wish I could ask him if I could visit my parents. But seeing as Mother wasn’t supposed to send letters-”
He didn’t think he could Apparate back to England without Joey with a good conscience, but for Merlin’s sake, he wanted to go home.
“That’s fine,” Harry said, but he was barely listening. He stopped his pacing to gaze through an enchanted window that showed the grounds above the lake. Outside, freezing sleet poured down in unforgiving sheets. Doubtless, the strange, masked wizards wouldn’t attack in this weather. They must have retreated. Or maybe they were close, biding their time…Harry strained to peer through the heavy precipitation for a bit of red, but he couldn’t see a thing.
“That’s very sweet of you to say, Luna. Thank you.”
“Hair of the dog,” Draco remarks sardonically, and takes a defiant swig of the spiked coffee.
All three Aurors glared at this request. Ray took one look at their expressions and said, “I must know your intentions first.”
The academy students rose at dawn, so the trio did as well, donning their gray uniforms and condensing their supplies in preparation for the return to Cambridge. Joey had been Apparating in short bursts all around the academy, to Draco’s and Harry’s great relief. She popped before them at the door, braids tightly coiled in a bun, eyes bright.
Only the gentle lapping of waves broke the moment of silence.
“You thought I wouldn’t find out about your dirty little secret?” The pseudo-Lucius whipped out his wand threateningly. Draco stepped backward, fear sharp on his face. “My own son, a filthy-”
“You’re still here?” Harry asked, unlacing his outer robes with one hand.
Both Harry and Draco blanched. The Mark twinged as if sensing that death was near. “Kill…?” Draco began.
Pansy glances at her backpack, propped against the bed. She remembers what she has rattling around.
A fourth person whispers indistinctly from behind Draco’s chair. The young man tries to twist and look behind him, but the ropes tighten. In front of him, Lucius’s face goes slack, and he immediately puts his wand away.
“She’s awake,” She heard Draco say, and he gently shook her. “Joey? Are you all right?”
Mum, that’s all I was going to say...”
She took the Tube to London for the novelty of it, and despite folding up her shrinkable outer robes, earned a few strange looks from the Muggles for the military-like outfit.
He tried not to think about how long that feeling would last.
Muttering profanities under his breath, Harry reached beneath the cauldron as Malfoy carefully performed the last step. As soon as Malfoy finished, Harry extinguished the fire with a flick of his wand, and the potion’s surface immediately calmed, the steam’s flow ceasing.
“Oh, fuck me,” Harry gasped, and Joey looked at him sharply. “A Horcrux.”
“Potter!” One of them calls and kicks the ball over. Harry takes it with ease, dodging one opponent, passing off the ball when he can’t handle the next. The sun begins to peek through the clouds, and Harry uses the extra visibility to his advantage, watching, waiting for an opening.
“I can’t handle myself out there like you can,” Draco said, talking over him, “I’m not built to fight, I don’t want to fight anymore, I’m sick of it….”
Hermione watched this interaction with a sort of affable curiosity, then turned away pointedly to give them privacy.
“The power might’ve come back,” Ron said with a shrug.
“Oh, let me guess. Eternal life? Enough magic to conquer a nation?”
[Reader’s Warning: The following scene contains non-explicit sexual content.]
“The Chosen One?” Cassandra, a bright-eyed, black-haired girl, reached her hand out. Harry took it a bit hesitatingly, and she shook his whole arm vigorously. Tabitha, a more reserved, bespectacled brunette, only nodded to him in recognition.
“Oh - Thank you.” Padma takes it and sips. It’s nearly black, with a dribble of milk, and no sugar. “It’s just how I like it. How did you know?”
Joey pointedly cleared her throat, and Harry and Draco followed her gaze to the man standing with his hands in his pockets, surveying the moving crowd with his back to the portal - an attempt at being inconspicuous, Joey supposed.
No, Padma decides. It’s pity.
“Yup.” Theodore looked slightly amused at being addressed with such affability but shook Ron’s and Hermione’s hands.
“Is it working?” Justin asks, twisting his hands. He’s been pacing restlessly over Harry’s sleeping form for the past half hour, listening attentively to the clacking of the keyboard and occasionally peeking over Padma’s shoulder.
A tear rolls down his cheek and drops onto his skin. Only one. He’s controlled today, a statue, splintering stone.
“Do you not want to be here?” Potter says flatly. Draco stuffs his hands into his pockets and clenches a determined jaw. Potter hasn’t talked to him like that in weeks, but the tone is still familiar.
The hot shame that spread through him still clings to him years later.
The truth is, Draco sees the same pool of unrest draining into Harry’s lungs as he sees in himself. He wants to coax it out, or light a flame there until the ocean evaporates and Harry can breathe again. It’s calming, in a sick way: he’s floating on the surface of the water, seconds away from sinking back into the Earth.
“Yes, here.” He pats the spot where Pansy once was when Potter gives him yet another hesitant look.
Redness falls out, sticky and warm. He keeps going.
“Piss off. That’s not what I - please, just open your eyes.”
Only a few phrases are clear enough for him to see:
Potter shakes his head disbelievingly, turns, and slams the door on his way out without so much as a last glare back at Draco. The bell on the door swings wildly in his wake and Draco slumps against the shelves, deflating the minute Potter stomps out of sight.
“Merlin-”
He rests his forearms against the sink, avoiding looking at himself in the mirror. A single flick of the wand: a bandage. Another flick: it’s fastened on his wrist. He leaves the bathroom.
“I just…wanted to apologize. For, you know.”
Draco sets his textbook down. “Hello.”
Potter bites his lip, which Draco resents, because it’s distracting and uncouth. “Do you wanna go with me?”
“Oh,” Draco echoes, and turns his face away in embarrassment. Of course he fucked it up right as things were starting to feel natural. Potter and him weren’t designed to be friends, and it was naïve of him to believe it could happen after seven years of hostility if they brushed everything under a rug.
His head lands onto the wall with a loud
“So Parkinson could tie me up,” Potter spits back defiantly. “It’s my favorite hobby.”
Draco thinks of the conversation by the lake, where he lost his shit at Potter’s observation of his sleeves.
He picked up the habit halfway through Fourth Year when the stress of school had finally begun to take a toll on him.
Then Draco catches sight of a box of edible Dark Marks and wonders if he might throw up.
“No,” Draco turns and fixes him with the coldest look he can muster. “No, I don’t actually.”
He’s woken up what feels like five minutes later by the opening of the hospital wing door and the sound of frantic voices. He stirs groggily, met with the sight of Harry Potter rushing over to his bed with a bouquet in hand and Madam Pomfrey looking disproving from ten feet away.
His breathing quiets.
“Draco, is that…?”
He shrugs. “That’s why I got so upset. I dunno. I was embarrassed.”
In hindsight, it makes sense why he was apparently suspicious. Always in large - but still highly fashionable - clothing, jumping at noises, sneaking off by himself every night. Draco thinks it’s just the trauma but Potter’s brain is hard-wired to save people, so what can you do.
“What?”
Draco rolls his eyes and releases the
“What?”
Draco doesn’t realize how drastically things have changed between him and Potter until he looks over at the Gryffindor table and Potter doesn’t look back. He scoots a few inches to the left until Greg’s face is obscuring Potter from view.
By the time he wakes up in the hospital wing, his memory is too foggy to tell him which.
Potter only laughs, eyebrows furrowed slightly. “We’re not glued to each other’s sides, contrary to popular belief... Well, actually it happened once but we got unstuck. Erm, you ready?”
He has the strangest urge to touch, to comfort. Instead, he pushes down the blankets and, with a shaking hand, pulls up his own sleeve.
He comes back later that night, when everyone is asleep and Pomfrey won’t make him leave. Potter is sitting up wide awake, covers kicked to the foot of his bed. He doesn’t seem fazed when Draco walks in.
Except-
He pulled the sheets over his chest and turned to face the window. He had tried to heal them the first few times, but eventually the continued reopening of wounds overwhelmed his rudimentary healing skills.
“Hogsmeade was supposed to be a date.” Potter’s voice comes out hollow, and Draco’s head snaps up.
, alone. Can’t he see that the War is over? That Draco is done?
A loud snort escapes from Potter’s lips. “Just untie me,” he says.
“I’m not allowed in the Weasleys’ joke shop,” he says stiffly, and Potter stops walking.
Within a few minutes, he falls asleep, head drooping against Pansy’s shoulder. The hospital wing had been lonely without her, all blank white walls and stifling silence. The buzz of loneliness was tangible, crawling through his ears and plugging them until he felt the familiar itch in his arms. The silence was broken when she walked in.
The rest of his brain doesn’t seem to get the memo though, judging by the deep panic tearing through his stomach and up his throat.
Draco turns his nose up to remind her that Malfoys do not engage in such plebeian activities when a noise nearby catches his attention. His hand inches towards his wand. McGonagall enforced strict anti-violence protocols, but the stray vigilante occasionally slips through the cracks. It’s almost funny how his heart is hammering. He lived with fucking Voldemort for over a year, yet the rustle of a bush triggers his fight or flight response.
incident and found long scars all up and down his forearms, visible near the still healing wounds painting his chest and torso.
It’s almost cute, the deer-in-headlights look Potter adopts. “I just heard that you were in the hospital wing,” he mumbles, fiddling with the flowers in his hands.
Potter shrugs, as if anything about this is casual. “The same thing I suspect you have.”
It’s painfully awkward. Potter’s still averting his eyes like a kicked puppy, Pansy is now smacking her chewing gum, and Draco can’t take his eyes off Potter.
Draco is knocked off balance, not only by the abrupt change in subject, but by the mundane excuse coming out of The Savior of the Wizarding World’s mouth. He sounds like… he sounds like a regular teenager.
“I said
He tries to stop, he really does. All throughout Transfiguration, he holds a cube of ice tight in his hand. The harder he squeezes it, the more pain he wrings out, until it’s melted, and he’s shivering, and it’s just
It takes five minutes after he wakes up for Pansy to storm into the room, two minutes for her to stop yelling at him, one minute for the hug to end, and another two minutes for his cheek to stop stinging when she slaps him. Gray streaks run down her face from where tears mixed with her mascara.
Granger and Weasley step to his bedside, and when Granger starts to cry, Weasley wraps an arm around her. They don’t even notice when Draco leaves.
Even worse, Potter’s looking at him in pity. This ignites a flame in Draco’s chest, kindled by the pride still drilled somewhere deep down inside of him. “Draco, I’m sorry, I just-”
” This is just ridiculous. Stupid fucking Potter and his inability to leave anything - to leave
He really should’ve known it couldn’t last.
Eighth Year: to be determined.
The lake is a pale blue sheet of glass, matching the chill in the air. Standing side by side with Pansy, staring out into the distant mountains, Draco feels more at peace than he has in years.
Potter laughs like he’s not sure if he’s allowed to, and the anger in his chest hissing at Potter relaxes at the sight. He’s too tired to pick fights anymore.
“Fuck you, I was worried, okay?” The words burst out of Potter’s mouth in one continuous line, a single angry breath. “Is that what you want to hear?”
It takes Draco a total of two weeks to realize something is off.
Draco flips off Pansy and her ridiculous kissy faces on the way out of the Slytherin Common Room, then meets Potter in the Entrance Hall at seven, as promised.
The War must have addled his brain because even
A minute later, Potter pulls the Invisibility Cloak off his head. “How did you know I was here?” He looks slightly put out.
him, I hate him,” Draco says vehemently, setting his goblet down with a loud clatter.
Potter ignores the cheap jab and sighs, stretching out on the grass. The green is patchy, broken up by the sand from the beach. Draco takes a moment to wrinkle his nose in distaste at the dirt getting on Potter’s trousers, before transfiguring a nearby rock into a blanket, and sitting down a few inches away from Potter.
The entrance to the Common Room opens and closes, but no one is there. Draco rolls his eyes, knowing who it is immediately. “I’ll be back in a few.” He presses a kiss to the top of Pansy’s head and walks up the stairs to his dorm.
Potter reaches out his own hand, marred with scars -
- and take it.
That night, Draco catches a glimpse of his Dark Mark in the shower. It’s marred by thin scars, distorting the ugly gray lines, not enough to hide it, but enough to bring bile to the top of Draco’s throat at the very sight.
Potter probably doesn’t even get the joke. And his clothes are dirty.
Potter reaches a hand towards Draco, but he flinches away. Hurt spreads all across Potter’s face, but hardens after a moment.
His hands twitch. He shoves them into his pockets, and squeezes them into fists.
Harry shifts slightly, throwing an arm across Draco’s waist. Draco cards his hands gently through the dark curls strewn across his chest. They’re soft, despite their unruly appearance.
She blinks.  “You’re fucking… again?”
Staring at his scars in the mirror feels like being consumed by Fiendfyre.
“Let me,” he says, and hands the Galleons to the clerk before Draco has the chance to do anything. Draco shakes his head as they leave the store. He’ll just buy Potter a hot chocolate or something to make up for it.
Since he isn’t planning on offing himself anytime soon, he figures the largest problem at hand is the issue of the scars: long sleeves and the wide berth most people gave him would surely be enough to make this a non-issue.
Being branded by the Dark Lord had taught him an important coping mechanism: stoicism. If he held completely still, he could meet those horrible red eyes and pretend it was what he wanted, even as tears of pain swam in his eyes. It was like playing dead - distancing himself from reality was a necessity when the Dark Lord was sleeping three rooms away.
It’s a full week before he does it again.
“What does it bloody matter?”
The blade of the knife pokes against Draco’s skin, innocent in the stillness before he drags it down sharply. He’s a coward. It’s barely a scratch, only a thin white line and dry skin peeling around it.
Draco wonders how he got to be so fond of someone so hopelessly dumb. “How did you get in here?”
He turns back to his textbook, but Potter is still there. “Really?” he says, shock displayed across his face.
“I’m worried, okay?” The words burst out of Potter like it was killing him to hold them in. Draco smirks in satisfaction, moving back to rest on his elbows and allow the light breeze to massage his scalp. “You barely eat at meals, you’re so quiet all the time, and you’ve lost weight-”
Draco speaks Harry’s thoughts aloud. “Central Park. That was a nice trip.”
“I don’t understand what you’re asking me to do.”
The thought stopped Harry cold in the middle of the Slytherin common room. A few younger students pushed past him, muttering, “Out of the way, fag.”
The words, the Valentine’s gift - they are not her own. Shame and anger at herself rises in Pansy, but she squashes it down. This is what she does, after all. Anything to get - and keep -what she wants.
“No, no…it’s fine. It’s just been a while since I’ve performed a spell like that. I’ll be all right in a minute.”
“I’m human, aren’t I?” Draco pushed back his unfinished salad and stood from the table. “I just remembered that I have a paper to write. I’ll see you all later.”
“Sectumsempra!”
Harry hesitated to touch it, remembering that the last necklace he had known Malfoy to give had been cursed.
“Cup!” He exclaimed, distressed, hair turning gray. Harry made the container, which hadn’t spilled, fly right back into place with a flick of his wand. Teddy giggled, eyes flashing the same emerald shade as Harry’s.
“You’re just saying that to make me feel better.”
Misery rolled off Draco in waves - Harry had felt it from him since sixth year, ever since he’d been tarnished with the Dark Mark. But this was wildly different, having Draco’s desperate hands cling to him. Harry was now aware that he had become partially, if not completely, responsible for Draco’s well-being…and that scared the hell out of him. Harry Potter, both the Boy Who Lived and the boy who died, held captive by a prophecy for eighteen years - how was he any less broken than the child forced into a life of crime and hate?
One minute later, Draco was perched atop the Shadow Dragon’s now-gray scales, wand pointed beneath him, focusing all his magical power on keeping them afloat while Harry shot Propulsion Charms behind them. “How’s it going, love?” Harry asked casually, raising his voice over the air whooshing past them.
“Malfoy?” Harry said tentatively, and Draco looked up abruptly. “Um, hi.”
Harry firmly refused. The witch’s eyes narrowed, and Draco’s hand shot to his wand. But the witch only bowed her head and stood, robes cascading to the floor. “We have faith that we will meet you again. Even if fate’s hand must drag you.”
“What does?”
Draco’s brow furrowed, and he looked away from the broken shell of a father.
Two bright-haired students, wearing light robes appropriate for summer, and nervous expressions, sat with two others, whose faces were striped in red paint.
“We’ve got loads of protective spells up,” Harry said around his mouthful. “Muffling, magic camouflage, the whole bit.”
“Would you like to take anything?” Mrs. Weasley offered.
Ron blinked, bemused. “Er…” He looked to his friends, but even Hermione was stumped. “Agatha?” He guessed. The Fat Lady frowned and sniffed in response.
∞ ∞ ∞
Harry relaxed under her touch. “Thanks, Gin.”
“No, I like it,” Draco said seriously. “And I came to say…good luck, I suppose.”
Burnt ramen, questionably orange macaroni and cheese, liquidy soup, and a smoking chicken casserole lay in small microwavable containers on a table pulled into the middle of the cabin. Draco sat at the head of it, his expression somehow both proud and sheepish. About half of the food looked edible.
Despite all that was on his mind in the late hour, Harry did his best to focus on Draco’s teaching. The Slytherin, in addition to being almost as naturally intelligent as Hermione, knew this particular Potions unit inside out. Perhaps he wasn’t as patient as Harry would’ve liked, but Draco’s blunt style worked well enough for the circumstances.
Fate’s hand had succeeded. Draco had no idea why the return of the masked wizards scared him so, but the fear was there, prickling into his heart. He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Harry, and the nearness of him made Draco feel less alone.
“That’s enough, Harry,” Dahlia said softly. Harry sat down hard, chest heaving, and fists balled. Draco tensed when he did so; he’d completely forgotten how much of a temper Harry could have. Righteous anger rolled off him in waves, and Draco counted himself lucky not to be on the receiving end of it. Pansy wasn’t crying - he’d seen her cry only once -, but she had her head bowed in embarrassment, her arms folded tightly.
“Did you let them in?”
“Summer already,” Draco says. He pushes back lilac hair with the sunglasses, and his eyes are rimmed with red. “Is it going faster now?”
“Forward, please, and stop talking,” Professor Dahlia commanded as she strode to the front of the room. At her tone, the students obeyed, glancing at each other nervously and bringing their hushed conversations to a halt. “It’s come to my attention that some people think it’s okay to bully others for the things they cannot change.” Her eyes were bright and livid. “But let me make this crystal clear. If I hear
“She didn’t love me, then,” Harry said thickly.
I'm delving into Draco's perspective more and more often, as though the story is becoming both his and Harry's - which it is, I suppose. They're still very different characters, but as they become more involved in each other's lives, the story's perspective shifts. Look forward to more of that later!
. “No.” Draco’s voice sounds weak, even to himself, and he takes a step back, his calves bumping against the chair. “No. You can’t make me.”
“Apparently this time it did,” Hermione answers for Ron, raising a brow at the candy. “So, we have a new student? Anyone interesting?”
The gun wasn’t loaded.
Soon enough, two voices crackle through the stillness. Luna slumps in Padma’s chair, catching a whiff of her chamomile perfume. She sighs, every breath, every recorded word, splintering the cracks in her heart.
“Good.” Harry pulled the drawstring on their bag of wizard money tight. “Unforeseen disaster? I’m sure nothing like that will happen.”
“We know you’re good,” Harry said. “Properly
As the trio continued to converse, Harry noticed how alike his partners were. Joey had obviously donned a façade of cold indifference to talk to them, just like Draco did with any stranger. Harry could only hope that, in time, he could break through her hard exterior. It would make working together a hell of a lot easier.
Ron told himself firmly. Maybe Harry was attracted to Malfoy’s talent? Ron wouldn’t dare admit that Malfoy was smart, but he knew things about potions that went over
Harry glanced to his left, and sure enough, Malfoy had disappeared again.
“Same here,” said Harry.
Draco watched Harry’s hands move the items with practiced precision, replacing everything in the metamorphosizing trunk-slash-backpack from biggest to smallest. Harry didn’t need to be very focused on his work, and he caught the uneasy look in Draco’s eyes.
“He’s dead,” Weasley says harshly. A few moments of silence pass, Draco looking down at his hands and leaning tiredly against the wall. He has half a mind to thank Potter for saving his life - but what’s the point?
“You didn't let anything happen,” Harry interjected. “Someone out there,” He jerked his head, “Did this to you. Don’t apologize. We’re your teammates; we’re honor-bound to stay. And…Well, you’re our friend, too.”
Draco snorted. “You think any of this is normal? Oh, please. A Death Eater and The Boy Who Lived go on a date. That sounds like the beginning of a joke.”
“I wish my boyfriend weren’t so famous. Kidding,” Draco said quickly when Harry bristled. “Sore subject?”
“Here goes nothing.” He guided Harry’s jaw open and poured the whole thing down his throat.
Padma nodded at both of them - she seemed to be in a good mood, all smiles, her long hair plaited back to reveal silver-ensconced, teardrop sapphires dangling from her ears. By contrast, Gavin tapped the table impatiently, eyes narrowing as if they’d been waiting a long time.
Later, when his muscles were sore, and a thin sheen of sweat covered his body, Draco lay curled next to Harry in their bedroom, the only source of light streaming in from the crescent moon. So content and exhausted was Draco that he nearly didn’t recognize the Dark Mark on his skin in the dimness. He frowned when he did, tracing its shape with his fingertips, both grateful for the faintness of the outline and dismayed at its unrelenting presence.
“Memories, not so much. Only if they’re deliberately brought to the surface. But we can basically talk to each other without speaking, yeah.”
“Wait.” Pansy grabs his arm as he sits up. She catches a whiff of whiskey. “You’re not making any sense. Just stay there.” She takes his hands in hers, rubbing her thumbs gently over his knuckles. “It’s okay. Breathe.”
“Well…” Harry pensively ran a hand through his hair. “I think you’re right about it being more powerful. But what do you mean, alive?”
“I ought to have asked Ginny more often,” He grumbled. “Look, can’t you let us in this once? You know us!”
“That’s a…long and complicated story,” Harry said, exchanging a look with Draco. “It all started when he wrote to me during the summer. I guess I gave him a second chance, and we finally managed to get along. It’s been weird, but…interesting. In a good way.”
“Look,” She said, and that was all it took to get Draco’s and Harry’s attention, and they both stood, following her gaze.
Slughorn checked the golden pocket watch hanging off a chain on his waistcoat. "Shouldn't be more than five minutes more. As long as your partner
Draco was staring, trying to read him. Harry looked away uncomfortably. If there was one thing Draco and Albus Dumbledore had in common, it was their x-ray vision, the ability to see emotions like a view through a crystal-clear window. At least, when it came to Harry.
did,” Draco corrected. “And me,” He added as an afterthought. Harry started at this new piece of information, but barely had enough time to process it before the Slytherin pressed on. “Tell you what. Let’s test your ‘whole school’ theory, Potter, shall we?” He nodded at Ron and Hermione, who were returning with two tankards of butterbeer each.
the Commander pick Joey? She’s younger than us and less educated.”
Harry’s not sure he has any idea, either.
“It’s not stupid,” Draco said quietly, and his hands came down to his sides before slipping into Harry’s. How long had Draco blamed himself for things that weren’t his fault? His parents’ dissolving marriage, Lucius becoming a Death Eater, Crabbe’s death.
Flushed, and breathing deeply, the pair locked eyes as Malfoy undid the belt with a clink of metal. He slipped his fingers down the hem, tugging Harry’s trousers and underwear down in one swift move.
Harry blinked, unsure at first. “Bring it on, Malfoy.” He raised his wand gamely.
“Potter, shut your pretty mouth,” Draco muttered to him, and Harry clammed up, blushing.
“Dr. Patil, no one will hear this but you and me, right?” Tape-Harry asks.
“So, what do you want us to do?” Ron said, who lit up at the mention of Creature Creams.
When Ray finally opened it, Draco gasped audibly. Under cover of Ray and Joey standing in front, Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and gripped it tight. Harry responded in kind, protectively pulling him closer. His breathing had become shakier.
Athena greeted her companions the second they walked in the door in a flurry of feathers, hooting so loudly that Harry was grateful for the Muffling charms they’d placed around their flat - the neighbors would have been curious otherwise.
. Before Harry could open it, Dahlia handed him another leaflet, this one charcoal-gray, and embossed with the Ministry of Magic insignia.
“A Malfoy,” Lucius spat with rage, speaking over him, “Shacking up with a half-blood.”
Hermione walked over to Harry's potion station with a lovestruck Ron following closely behind. "Gosh, this is rather interesting, isn't it?" She said grinning. The rest of the class visited with each other, and Slughorn watched the chaos, chuckling to himself.
,” Hermione said in a tone that made it clear it wasn’t the first time she had called his name. “Ron asked, what’s your favorite color?”
“Malfoy’s your boyfriend? Like Ron is ter Hermione?” He asked.
Draco gets himself another splash of whiskey and holds up the glass, saying something unintelligible. Harry shakes his head again, and Draco grabs the top of his jacket, pulling him close to speak in his ear. The move sets Harry’s heart alight, and its only over the sound of its beating that he can hear him. “Cheers to another year together.”
“Harry is twice the man you ever dared dream to be!” Draco shouted, clenching his fists.
“A letter,” Harry said, and as he spoke, his hand dipped into his robes, pulling out a worn envelope, its dark green seal broken. Draco’s eyes widened.
Luna, sweet and kind Luna, giggled heartily at this. “How could I? I’m just lucky to be with her.”
“Yeah, I might’ve just played a Quidditch match or something,” he teased, and Draco smirked.
“Don’t leave,” Luna says suddenly, moving to kneel on the car seat. “I’m sorry, Justin. I didn’t mean to…” Kiss our boss. Break your heart.
“Um…” Harry peered down the row of students, pretending to watch the teacher, but his eyes slid over to Hermione. Surreptitiously, she rolled her head in a slow circle and went cross-eyed, miming the potion’s effects. “Dizziness…Er, Dizziness Draught?”
As they neared the hut, the sod turned to steppingstones, slippery in the rain. Harry stumbled on one, but Draco caught him by the arm before he fell.
“Yes, and what about it?” Draco growled, growing increasingly anxious.
“There’s more to it than that,” Harry said. “There’s something you’re not telling me.”
The Hogwarts train was crowded with students from all houses heading home for the holidays. Owls hooted curiously, and children chattered excitedly as they settled into their chosen compartments.
Surprised, but nevertheless relieved, Draco respectfully inclined his head. “Thank you, Professor.”
Draco was so focused on trying to push his father from his mind as he left the dressing room that he ran smack-dab into someone else.
Malfoy scowled. “It was already half-empty when I found it.”
Dao replied sharply in Thai, but the meaning was apparent as she gathered crackling, ash-black energy between her fingertips. She would not back down.
“Are you not coming with us?” Joey insisted. “I was told we’d have a more experienced Auror as a guide.”
Teddy shook their head, and their hair lengthened, darkening to a chestnut. Freckles emerged across their nose, skin settling in a shade between Draco’s and Harry’s. They blinked, their left eye a wolfish yellow, and their right a dark brown.
The content itself may be short, but I think it's important to provide a little window into Draco's mind. His perspective will prove helpful to the reader's understanding of the story going forward.
Harry glanced at her in confusion. “Like the brown of a door?”
“Good.”]
As they pulled apart, Draco leaned down, pressing his mouth to Harry’s. The kiss was filled with all the things he couldn’t say, the emotions he held in his magic, and Harry took them in gladly, lips parting, hands warm and gentle on his neck.
Draco caught Harry’s eye and mouthed,
“Ow! What?”
Draco hesitated. “Sure.”
Draco pursed his lips, then immediately regretted it, getting a mouthful of dust. He spat on the ground and began to clean off with a charm, the slow, methodical magic calming his racing heart. “Are you sure?”
, my friend.”
“Just go, Draco,” Andromeda pleaded. “Talk to him. I’ve told him you’re here. No more hiding.”
“You’re not Harry without it,” He’d said fondly.
Harry sat up immediately, feeling his skull for blood; he thought he’d heard it thunk between the cushions as he fell. Fortunately, his fingers came away dry. “Thanks.”
“We’ve got career meetings today,” Hermione informed her classmates as she poured milk into her porridge. “They’ll take the place of first period, but it’s with our head of house, so we’re with Professor Dahlia anyway. And you with Slughorn,” She added for Draco’s benefit, and he nodded as he buttered his toast.
“I told them a week ago, but they didn’t write back,” Harry said, brow furrowed.
“Draco, love, this might be news to you, but everyone at the wedding knows you used to be a Death Eater,” Harry told him, slightly amused. “They’re all okay with you being there. Ron and Hermione
“Behold, the fruits of your labor!” She cried, eyes wild with happiness. “This was thanks to all your hard work, everyone! Savor it!”
Draco swatted at him, half-heartedly, then grew still, his eyes sliding closed. Harry smiled, leaning against the trunk of the lemon tree. Malfoy Manor stood at the top of the slope, so he could some of Wiltshire’s countryside, peppered with expansive roofs of expensive houses, leafy trees, and stone-walled courtyards between them. The sun had nearly touched the edge of the horizon.
“Um…” Draco thought his complexion may be ruined forever if he didn’t stop blushing. “Well, that’s…I…that’s a conversation for another day,” He finished, flustered.
did you take so long this morning?”
Grey eyes turn on him without an ounce of friendliness. But there’s no enmity either, so Harry presses on.
“Yes, I- wait. How did you know that?”
For the first time, Joey let her gaze linger on Dahlia’s neck, where the skin had burned and blackened like a splash of ink. She looked over at Dao, whose eyes were closed - she still appeared to be breathing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But you didn’t!” Henderson pointed out with force joviality. “You are undoubtedly a credit to your team.”

“Such a flatterer. I’m blushing,” Draco said, deadpan, but his pale cheeks did seem to darken a bit.
“Come on,” He said shakily, “Let’s fetch the others.”
“I ran into Luna,” Harry said truthfully.
The infirmary wing turned out to simply be the hotel’s bottom floor, patrolled by a handful of Healers that tended to injured or Stunned Aurors and civilians in shock. Henderson wordlessly unlocked the door and let them into one of the hotel rooms.
A thread of silver shot from the tip of the officiator’s wand, winding around their hands. “Hermione Jean Granger, do you take this man, Ron, and promise to love, cherish, and protect him in times of war and peace, sickness and health, prosperity and poverty?”
Harry has repeated this, gazing at Draco, many times. He believes it. He wants to be cherished, like he never has been since he was thirteen years old, wants to be possessed and held until the tiny apartment crumbles to dust.
Draco gritted his teeth, pushing down the wave of fury that had risen up in him.
“No. Is that what you’re doing?”
Ginny Weasley, a hand on her hip, raised an eyebrow at being addressed with such familiarity. “We haven’t met,” She said decidedly. She’d grown, somehow, since Draco had seen her two Easters ago. She wore a simple, sleeveless, lavender silk dress that accentuated her muscular, freckled arms. Her long, flaming hair was plaited back from her face, embellished with lavender eyeshadow.
“I’m going to give you two options,” Harry began slowly. “One, you pass through that door and go home. Two, I fuck you until you can’t walk straight.”
Then, after a pause in which Ginny did some swift thinking, she said loudly, “Hermione, Ron, are you two still prefects?”
The bathroom, like most rooms in Malfoy Manor, is too exquisitely enormous for its own good. But after a near-decade of taking perfumed, extravagant baths in the pool-sized tub every night, the room feels homey to Draco. Blue and yellow light from the enchanted chandelier above dances and reflects off the marble surfaces and mirrors. The Malfoys’ house-elf has already run the bath, so the water sits at the right temperature, and Draco slips in without hesitation. Reaching for a bar of chamomile and lavender soap, he begins to wash, albeit clumsily. But he leaves his hair untouched, sinking into the bubbles and waiting.
like you.
“That’s accurate,” Draco agreed.
“Thank you.” Draco took a single bit of crunchy, salt-and-pepper deliciousness and immediately scarfed down half the food; he hadn’t realized how hungry he was. He glanced up to compliment Harry on his cooking.
•    •    •
. For the second time since Ho Chi Minh City, she got her hopes up - and instantly squashed them back down again. She had no way of knowing for sure she’d get a cure there.
Joey switched back to an American accent. “Caroline doesn’t know what’s good for me.”
There was a long stretch of silence, and though Draco knew Harry might have fallen asleep or was simply thinking, teardrops inexplicably slipped out one after another, dripping across Draco’s face and onto the bedsheets.
“Your eyes look like emeralds,” Draco murmured, seemingly to himself, looking up from Harry’s lips to his gaze. Realizing he’d said that audibly, he continued, “Ah, sorry…Must be the firewhiskey talking.”
“So did my family. Fair’s fair.”
Draco sighed, from exasperation or bashfulness, Harry couldn’t decide, but the blush in his pale cheeks was telling. “You’re still the biggest sap I know, Potter.”
“Have fun, Harry,” Hermione smiled, and Harry wondered at her choice of words, but he swept up his things and didn’t give it much thought.
“Copperhead,” Draco said at the stone door, which slid open with a muted grating noise. The sound of music, laughter, and chatter immediately drifted out, and the two young wizards exchanged a look. “Party time,” Draco said tepidly, and they walked into the vibrant common room.
“Don’t be,” Draco shrugged, “I had it coming.”
∞ ∞ ∞
The pair Apparated twice more before they reached their destination, a quiet town drenched in moonlight, turning the earthen walls, thatched and concrete roofs, all the same shade of silver. Trees rustled in a summer breeze, their gnarled roots beckoning and human-like in the shadows.
Draco nodded quickly. “I don’t even know
Did he know something Harry didn’t?
“The second one, obviously,” Draco said, giving him a look. “I think everyone here is used to having a ‘celebrity’ around by now.” He punctuated the statement with ironic air quotes.
“What’s that?” Ron asked casually, nodding at the folded letter in Harry’s hand.
The stone walkway turns to smooth tile. A clatter sounds as Draco hurriedly drops the handle of his suitcase. This must be when we went to Philadelphia to visit Dudley, Harry realizes. The train station’s monitors for departures and arrivals flash aberrantly, from white to green to red.
“Rabbit, subdue him,” The witch instructed sharply, and her comrade obliged, raising their hands, and the air around Harry seemed to turn to molasses. He decided it was best to stall.
Joey nodded slowly. As she moved to the passenger side, boots treading lightly on asphalt, she stared at the side mirror. Joey slid into her seat and saw in the glass colorful silhouettes, cars, a couple of dogs panting underfoot. And there was a figure, stiller than the rest, dressed in loose jeans and a black tank top, face partially obscured by a hazy, black veil. Eyes blacker than night moved restlessly, just inches from meeting Joey’s; she quickly looked away, heart pounding.
Draco laughed as quietly as he could, then abruptly stopped. Rabbit had begun to march over, red robes swirling like an unending fall of blood. “Shit. Go.”
Hermione, a bit uncharacteristically, was already waiting for them in the common room. Unsurprisingly, she had her nose in a book, a slim volume of poetry. Harry wondered when she’d gotten into poetry, and if Draco had finished the collection she’d lent him.
If only I knew how much love I’d have for you. I would have held you much sooner.
“‘Melancholia is, I believe, a musical problem: a dissonance, a change in rhythm.’” Luna stops her recitation, suddenly, and her brow furrows with the bluntness of it. “I don’t know the rest. It’s beautiful, though. By Alejandra Pizarnik.”
“No,” said Draco in a small voice. He seemed embarrassed. “I thought…After third year, you, I don’t know, went to live with my mother’s cousin. Sirius.”
“This place has good cake.”
“It’s late, Doctor. And we, um…” Justin trails off.
“Your deduction skills,” Harry said, sitting down next to him, “Are impeccable.”
“An unfortunate oversight, to be sure,” Henderson said gravely. “I would appreciate it if you wouldn’t mention it to Antigone.”
Joey’s eyes traced the floor in thought. It was up to her, in the end.
Pansy can handle an angry, sad, tired, or confused boyfriend. Only a few weeks into their relationship, however, she doesn’t think she could handle all those emotions at once.
"Draco does have a big mouth, so that makes sense," Ron agreed. "But the content is weird. He regrets? How can you feel regret if you don't have a heart?"
Harry stepped forward, footsteps rustling in the grass. He wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist, and they leaned into each other, standing side by side in the muted sounds and sights of the clearing. Draco’s eyes fixed on a birch tree, just ahead, its thin leaves fluttering with a ghostlike lack of intensity. The trunk bent slightly to the left, its pale bark marred with dark gouges and circular marks.
“Ben, Harold, and Esme,” Charon said, looking at Harry, Draco, and Joey in turn. “They’re from-”
“Gemma, do I look all right?” Lucius continued as if he hadn’t heard her. “I don’t want to be too intimidating, you understand, but they must be able to take pride in Slytherin! Ah, there they are!” And his shattered eyes suddenly locked on Draco, who became stiff, fearful, and unsure. “Severus Snape, is it? Yes, I’ve heard from Professor Slughorn you have shown
“That’s not what I…” Joey muttered, then coughed. Reluctantly, she let her hands fall to her sides.
“When he shall die,” Joey began softly as if musing to herself, “Take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine-”
"That didn't sound like Malfoy at all," Hermione suddenly said, and at the same time, Ron wondered, "People call us the Golden Trio?"
,” Faraday said with a slow, elegant shrug. “He can be a little… Henderson Melo
Harry tripping and cutting his head in the dark was only one item on Joey’s very long list of problems she could have solved with a wand. She heard him slip, a loud crack, then him inhaling through gritted teeth.
“Oh, no. I don’t study for non-practical tests,” Luna said airily, “Especially if they’re multiple choice. I’m a good guesser.” She beamed.
” Ron lifted up the cover and read the title. “Hermione, is this a book about civil rights? I didn’t know the library had those.”
“I’m going to find Ginny,” Luna announced. “Harry, Draco, I’ll come for you after lunch. I want to show you something.”
After nearly an hour of tense leaf-picking, Draco’s and Harry’s jar was nearly full. They made a bit more conversation, but mostly worked in silence, focusing on the task at hand. By the end of class, the pair had switched places twice and were covered in a sheen of sweat from the stifling warmth of the greenhouse.
“Schiza, what now?”
Harry sighed and watched the steam rush from the kettle’s spout. “It’s nothing.” Draco’s hand in his hair, his naïve and ardent lips. He was becoming rapidly obsessed.
He tosses his blazer to Ron and makes an effort to straighten his tie, but he doesn’t think it’ll make much of a difference anyway. Harry’s untidy black hair speaks troublemaker whether he wants it to or not, so he resolves to rely on his charisma to convince Malfoy he’s leadership material.
Although this chapter is a bit shorter, it does contain significant plot bits that focus mainly on the characters and their relationships. Draco and Harry sort of have their first "falling-out", and though it is a minor one, their making up is ultimately what is important about this chapter. There is something I would like to make note of going forward: this fanfiction is obviously based on the Harry Potter books, but does take inspiration and some quotes from the movies. As you may have noticed, characters like Grawp or Winky have not been mentioned. Like the movies, the universe of this fanfiction is more simplified, and altered to my discretion for the story. I will try to keep the personalities and actions of the characters true to the way JKR wrote them, but there will be mistakes. I am human, after all :) A similar disclaimer applies for the formatting of the fanfiction itself.
Draco shrugged, tiredly and elegantly. “If you want.”
“Who knows,” Draco muttered. The Following’s movements were so unpredictable that at this point, he wouldn’t be surprised if their masks waited on the other side of the Cambridge portal.
“Can I keep going?” Harry asked, and Draco nodded mutely, eyes widening. “Tell me when to stop.”
Draco’s eyes glittered in the setting sun as they focused on Ginny. “What are you implying?”
“Nice one,” They managed to chuckle, and before Harry could Stun them, vanished with a faint
“Never beg for mercy,” said one of the blue-clad figures in English, voice oozing disdain. Their covered face turned to the woman, then back to the man. “You know the price.
“Boston is my home now,” Dahlia replied. “It’s good for me, being around wizards who aren’t so… radical.”
“I told you already, I’m going out with some friends.” Draco strides by him, rolling up his sleeves, apparently in a hurry. Harry catches a whiff of cologne. “Ugh, where are my boots? I left them here.” Draco crosses his arms, glaring at the space next to his side of the couch.
Joey’s fingers brushed absently against her lips. “I don’t know if I’m better. I don’t feel bad, I guess.”
“Yes, well, it’s always good to get a head start, isn’t it?” Hermione stood up and closed her book with a resolute slam. “I think I’ll have a chat with Professor Dahlia. She doesn’t have a class now, does she?” Without waiting for an answer, she strode off. Deciding they didn’t have a better way to fill up their morning, the other three followed.
“How charming!” Professor Flitwick, who was passing by, stood to his full one hundred and six centimeters to peer into their bowl. “A bit simple, but nice work, Potter and Malfoy. A point each to Gryffindor and Slytherin.” He continued walking along the rows of desks, handing out similar words of praise to the rest of the class.
“Or all of us,” Draco amended. “In any case, from a logistical standpoint, it wouldn’t make sense to split up. Someone would have to come and help you eventually, and we’re already here.”
The world came back into focus. On one side lounged an arrogant, painfully pureblooded former Death Eater. On the other sat the Chosen One, vanquisher of the Dark Lord. “Oh. Yeah, of course. I’m getting rather tired as well.” It wasn’t a lie, and Harry found himself yawning.
And then he’s in the Toyota, the gash in the metal not quite the farthest thing from his mind as he cruises next to Draco, a bag slung over his shoulder, angrily stalking the sidewalk. “Draco, love, I’m sorry. Let me take you home, at least.”
When the warning bell rang, Luna gave Ginny a comforting kiss - chaste, and certainly nothing to be scandalized about, though full on the lips. Harry glanced worriedly at Cassandra and Tabitha, but they didn’t bat an eye, which heartened him somewhat. He was glad that Ginny and Luna had found dependable, non-judgmental friends.
“Half a kilometer from here,” Joey began, “Is the ambassador we’ve been instructed to escort. Commander Danjuma is expecting him in an hour, accompanied by at least one Auror.”
Draco’s gaze flitted to the living room, which was clean and filled with sunlight but still achingly empty and lifeless. “Too many hard surfaces for a child” was his excuse, and he took a bite of his sandwich to keep from talking.
“Are you sure about this?”
The silence that accompanies them to Harry’s apartment is a strange one. He blushes every time he meets Draco’s eyes in the rearview, but for the life of him, Harry cannot understand why. It isn’t the first time he’s had people over at his apartment. He’s not a child, for Pete’s sake.
Joey leaned forward, her body still halfway in the glittering blue. “Auror Melocotones?”
Draco chanted in his head, or perhaps under his breath.
The three wended their way through the district, through the crowd, ignoring tantalizing smells and powerful waves of magic both. Interest nagged at Joey’s mind - how many wizards like them could safely practice their gifts around here?
“About that, I do not know much,” Danjuma admitted, sliding a teacup towards him. “Have some.” Only then did she sit, the fabric of her robes draping elegantly around the tall, cushioned chair.
“Or looking for you, Potter,” McGonagall said gravely. “Professor Dahlia, you have connections in Thailand. Provide a description of the perpetrators to the magical offices there. Perhaps they will know why their wizards are attacking schools so far from home.”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, I thought you knew what you were signing up for.”
“Staying here, I expect,” Draco said evenly, but Harry could see the bitter look in his eyes; of course, Draco would stay at Hogwarts if his own family didn’t welcome him.
Malfoy Manor had grown even dustier in the months since Christmas, the must and mold making Harry wrinkle his nose. He pointed his wand rapidly at the large windows, and they all swung open, letting light stream in. All the furniture, including four couches, a few armchairs, and half a dozen ottomans -
“Maybe we should be trying to make this last,” Draco murmurs. “Before it all goes away. Do you really think you can stop something going on outside your body, while you’re asleep?”
“I’m sure she’ll be here any minute now,” Hermione reassured him. “Your parents came with her later as she doesn’t have her Apparating license yet.” Harry squirmed; even though it’d been a whole month since Ginny dumped him, he hadn’t talked to her yet and had no wish to.
Between Here and the Stars is going on a brief hiatus. The story will return on March 4, 2021, with chapter 9.
“Same year, then,” Malfoy’s lips briefly press into a thin line, but it doesn’t distract from their fullness. Harry mentally kicks himself. He’s had enough of pretty girls; he focuses on Malfoy’s gaze, which grows steelier with each passing moment.
“It’s Christmas, isn’t it?” Harry replied as he tore open a gift from Hermione, revealing
“As the sun and moon,” said Max, in an unexpected burst of poetry. “Ah, you must be Ron’s sister!” He greeted over Draco’s shoulder, and Draco turned.
Half the students shouted, “Hey!” back, including Ron. “What’s happening?” Harry asked, looking around in bewilderment.
Draco thought giddily as Harry rested his head on his shoulder, catching his breath. He drew his cock out, the motion eliciting a rather wet noise that made Draco blush.
“Didn’t say
Joey chuckled before she could stop herself. “Nothing that hasn’t been going on my whole life, really.” She paused, the incoming words making her feel warm and uncomfortable as if the pub’s lights were heat lamps.
“Cream puff,” Draco mutters near Harry’s ear, and Harry snorts at the insult, which he thought he’d left behind on a distant shore along with the words.
“It’s freezing out here, Potter. What are you on about?”
And just like that, Harry knew they were properly friends again. Ron put his arm around Hermione, and Draco kissed Harry’s cheek without checking to see if anyone was watching. The four -
“Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?” Joey asked suddenly, and it came out harsher than she meant it to.
“I agree,” Antigone said, puzzled at Draco’s intense gaze, and Joey could admit she was confused too. Draco turned the look on Harry, who only sighed and wiped futilely at his damp cheeks. Joey felt that she was missing something again; her partners seemed to have an infinite number of secrets they shared only with each other.
Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry’s request. “I just came out to you, Potter. What more do you want from me?”
“For being honest with me. If you don’t want kids, that’s fine with me. If you change your mind later on, that’s fine, too.” Harry paused, then laughed. “Took you a while to think about it, huh?”
“How much of that did you hear?” Harry muttered to Draco as the three boys hurried down the many flights of stairs.
The stadium erupted into a cheering mass of green and gold. But above it all, the shrill voice of Pansy Parkinson screamed, “Help him! For Merlin’s sake, someone
“Can’t hear you, honey.” Harry pumped his fingers in and out, increasing the pace.
“Not really,” Harry confessed as he placed the bag on the smooth, white marble countertop. The sunlight from the window above the sink, overlooking the overgrown vegetable garden, bounced off the shiny surfaces. The crystal glasses sparkled within the glass-paneled, dark wood cabinets. “I just didn’t want you to get crumbs on the couch.”
"Oh, nothing. You just seem surprisingly comfortable. Especially considering that I'm technically a Death Eater and you're the man who killed the Dark Lord. I could have my wand pointed at you right now."
He retrieves his wand and waves it over the tabletop. Draco blinks in surprise; his father has always had a strict no-magic-at-the-dinner-table rule. This must be serious. As a long sheet of crisp, white parchment unfurls onto the dark wood, the family house-elf places a slice of tiramisu by Draco’s elbow. He forces himself to ignore it.
A few miles away, Luna moves across the street, her flushed face tucked into a scarf. She steps gingerly, careful not to slip on patches of ice, but her mind is working a mile a minute.
“No, of course not.” Not for you, Ms. Lovegood, Justin imagines she might add, but Dr. Patil doesn’t. She wouldn’t - the boundary between her and Luna is firm, and she doesn’t dare cross it.
Harry grinned. “Fine by me.”
“Do I? Because this is the first time I’m hearing about you wanting me to push out your little brats.” Draco’s come closer now, invading Harry’s space like he does when he’s furious. Maybe that’s one of the reasons they weren’t right for each other, Harry thinks, because it’s difficult to love someone when intimacy and anger feel the same in their closeness, Draco’s loving fire and wretched permafrost the same in their biting pain.
“I’ve never seen a rabbit in the wild before,” Harry said, satisfied. “Maybe we ought to…oh…” He trailed off as Draco’s pale hand brushed his cheek, pulling him close.
“I could charm it to float instead if you’d like.”
Draco fell silent, but he kept his senses primed as they strolled leisurely around, looking for all the world like a couple of foreign college students on vacation.
“Objectively,” Ron adds quickly. “I prefer brains over beauty anyway. Not that you don’t have both,” He stammers. The tips of his ears turn red.
“There is more than one type of magic, Joanne,” Faraday replied and nodded encouragingly as Joey began to bring the cup to her lips, then turned her head away, gagging. “One swallow. That’s all it takes.”
Madam Rosmerta swallowed nervously, but she led them to a small booth near the bathroom. As soon as they were seated and she had left, Draco nudged Harry with his elbow.
Before Harry could figure out precisely what the Slytherin meant, a third person clearing their throat startled them both. Harry hadn’t realized he had been staring into Draco’s silver eyes, but he tore his gaze away to see Ron standing at the other end of the dining table. The redhead looked back and forth between the other two; Draco stood behind and to the right of Harry, the shorter young man instinctively leaning into the taller. Their faces, due to the quiet conversation, were closer together than usual. Realizing how intimate the scene might look to an outsider, Harry stepped away from the Slytherin.
Inside the room were three twin-sized beds, over which hung a tapestry of a gold-embroidered elephant drinking from a lake. Draco thought it might have been Muggle made until Harry touched the edge, and the elephant’s trunk lifted in a tired wave.
“I don’t know.”
“Shit, I’m close,” Harry groaned, his thrusts becoming more erratic and desperate. Knowing his own body had nearly brought the porn star to orgasm somehow turned Draco on even more, and he felt himself twitching in Harry’s jerking hand. He grinded his hips against Harry as hard as he could, feeling every inch of flesh fill him, riding his length as if his life depended on it.
Ray did not flinch. “That will not work. Unless you are willing to be more diplomatic, sister,” the word dripped with irony, “Your presence is not welcome here. Leave.”
Harry clenched his jaw at the mention of Ginny. “She dumped
Joey didn’t answer for a minute, but she put her plastic chopsticks down, and Harry knew she’d heard the question. “Have you heard things about me already?” She asked, clearly deflecting, but they let it slide.
Draco tiptoes to the seat on Potter’s left. His heart pounds with apprehension. Surely Potter hadn’t agreed to this meeting only to attack Draco and turn him in? Not here? Draco wants terribly to believe the best of the Chosen One in the same way that he believes the worst of himself.
It was a shame, really. He’d begun to really trust her.
“By yourself.”
Harry's blood ran cold at the sound of his name, but a split second later he wondered if Draco was really an enemy any more.
“Professor Dahlia!” Headmistress McGonagall called immediately. “You understood that language?”
is radical?” Dao spat, stepping back as if Dahlia had insulted her. “The fire-wielders who killed your family -
The gun concealed in her cloak told a different story. Joey refused to part with it because that would mean that she trusted Draco and Harry with her life. She didn’t trust anyone with her life.
Luna moves mechanically after that, tamping down her fear and letting her curiosity take over. She finds a player and pushes in the tape.
Dahlia dug around in her jeans pocket, pulling out an amulet made from gold, its charm dangling with a ruby that glistened as if on fire.
“What are those for, anyway?” Ron asked, grabbing one before it knocked over a tureen of gravy.

Narcissa falls silent for a moment. This must be how it begins, the separation of mother and son. She’s seen it coming. It only stings a bit. “Of course, Draco. It’s nice to see you’re taking some responsibility.”
“Not to you,” Draco said, a bit ominously. Ginny squinted at him. “Well, if I did have a mind to attack you, which I don’t, I’m sure you’d put up a good fight anyway.”
Draco picked up one of the twigs and plopped it into the water, sending a bit of it splashing over the edge. “So? What’s the plan?”
Harry knew Ron made valid points, but he elected to ignore them. “Hermione,” Harry said beseechingly, turning to her, “I thought you and Draco were getting along.”
“You sound incredulous.” Draco raises an eyebrow. “Men don’t hit on you?” He reaches forward, picks a bit of fluff or something off of Harry’s shoulder and flicks it away.
Nikki ignored him, knelt by the dragon’s head, and reached for its snout, opening its mouth to reveal a row of glistening, pale-yellow teeth, each as long as Joey’s arm. Draco yelped in alarm as Nikki pried the sleeping creature’s mouth open. Kevin sidled beside her, procuring a large bottle filled with a bright green potion. As it splashed upon the dragon’s tongue, Joey exchanged a meaningful look with Draco. They had brought the same potion, but Antigone had told them it was best to inject it.
Presently, Professor Dahlia poked her head out and waved in her students. “Last day to show me your Patronus if you haven’t already,” she told them. The desks were in their usual formation, but Dahlia had pushed her own back to make a bit of room at the front. “Non-corporeal is totally fine,” She continued, eyes resting on Draco. “Do your best. Henrietta, why don’t you start?”
“That I’m trans.” The words are very small, curled up and shivering at Draco’s feet. “I made sure that everyone who knew never saw me again. I left England so I could put all that shit behind me. I told myself I’d never be an outsider again.”
“You’re getting better at lying,” Joey told him as Harry came in, closing the door quietly behind him. He figured the statement was a compliment in terms of the game. “I’ve been playing this game for years, anyway.”
“Oh, hush,” Draco whispered, and kissed him, just as Harry had hoped for. Time turned to honey, and the ruckus of the lightning-embroidered tempest faded to background noise. For a moment, Harry could imagine that it was just the two of them, living in their own bubble of happiness while the world raged futilely outside.
“Clarke?” The smooth, tinkling voice of an older woman called softly down the alley.
But the now-unmasked woman lay unaccompanied beside them, her bare brown face slack and unmoving.
A ray of hope, weak yet present, tiptoed through the sleet.
Draco said none of this, but the thought tumbled about in his mind as he held Harry’s unwavering gaze.
Fear tingled down Harry's spine until he realized who he was talking to. "You're not going to kill me, Malfoy," Harry scoffed.
“All in good time, Potter.” The blond’s jaw was clenched. His eyes strayed towards the door.
“Slytherins.” With just one word, the air in the Great Hall changed into something more venomous. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw the formerly still Dahlia tilt her head towards the table of renegades. Three girls glared at the Headmistress while Draco merely stared at her impassively. “We shall not speak of the circumstances that kept you from attending last year. But if you’re going to get along with the others, you must abandon the values of your Death Eater parents.” McGonagall peered at the four of them over her glasses, making eye contact with each one. “Are we clear?” Three stiff nods. One pair of silver eyes sliding to the side, almost meeting Harry’s, then looking back again. “Fantastic. The four of you will lead your year to the Slytherin dungeons. Seeing as there are so few students, all four houses may fit in one section of the dorms. Perhaps some inter-house interaction will pacify any young Slytherins that may wish to…cause trouble.”
“Like what?” Ron asked, almost suspiciously.
“Backpacking,” Joey said, patting her bag for emphasis. Tourists without suitcases were bound to draw suspicion, so the trio had decided that backpacking across Asia was the best cover. Foreign students did it all the time. “Y’know, enjoying my summer.” Her casual attitude was plenty convincing.
“She’ll be heaps better than any other Ministry employee they could send,” Hermione muttered to Ron and Harry.
Ron shrugged and plopped his bag down next to a curly-haired, bright-eyed Ravenclaw. As Harry settled into the seat next to Anaya, she glowered at him and purposefully moved her books between them. The stone on Harry’s chest grew slightly warm, to his lack of surprise.
Besides the cloud of distrust that surrounded the outsider, dinner passed with its usual chatter. Ginny told a story about seeing Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, getting a bucket of water dumped on it by a pair of brazen Ravenclaw sixth years, to her family’s great amusement.
Draco didn’t turn, even as Joey moved to stand beside him. He slouched, unmoving, staring with disbelief at the witch.
Then, the Pensieve brought them back to a city again, in front of an old, brick and white stone building dwarfed by skyscrapers; all the facades were blurred in torrential rain.
“I don’t know,” Harry says helplessly.
“You’re here now,” Draco says gently, reading his mind, and he takes his hand. “
“Malfoy, I think I’m bisexual.”
Dahlia, in a bright yellow slicker, found Dao huddled beneath the old building's overhang. A few years had passed; Dahlia’s hair had grown to just above her shoulders.
“You’re injured,” Joey reminded again.
See y’all again soon.
“I wish. Pansy and Anaya invited me to talk about ‘something important,’” She said, the quotes puncturing the air even without hand signals. “I don’t know what, but it’s probably another one of Pansy’s petty schemes.” She raised an eyebrow at Draco.
“September first, nineteen ninety-one,” Lucius says smoothly, tapping an entry near the parchment’s top. “Attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” a disapproving glance at Narcissa, “
“I’ve got to hand it to you,” Harry says, voice deep with age, “I think we’ve done it.”
“Am I dreaming?” Draco blinked hard.
then,” Hermione said, a bit clumsily, but she beamed at the attempt. Ron and Harry stared, not understanding. “I mean, sit down; I have tea.”
“You should not say these things to me,” Caroline said in English. “Not here.”
“No, no,” Harry said reassuringly, and he explained to Draco his coming-out plan.
“At least, I think it is. Truth be told, I’ve never met a Harry. I’m not making fun of you, by the way.” He talks like rain, fast yet soothing. “Christ, I couldn’t do that, could I? Not with a name like Draco.”
“Thanks.” Harry placed the cake box on the kitchen counter, and Draco fixed his gaze upon it. “When do you want me to pay you back?”
Joey had been traveling with Harry and Draco for scarcely a month, but she could tell how much they depended on each other; their lives were linked. Joey knew such a connection wasn’t possible, but she had the eerie feeling that if one of the couple died, the other would go with them. Joey almost wished she could feel that way about someone. Perhaps the strength between loved ones was merely disguised as weakness.
“The wizards out there. They didn't have any wands.”
The same girl that had grown white blossoms earlier sidled into the room. She glanced wide-eyed at the three Aurors, then said something in Thai.
“Well…” Harry lost his words for a moment. He cast a nervous glance to his companion, who appeared more and more uncomfortable by the minute.
The elephant’s ears flicked, its expression as serious as an animal’s could be. It stared at all three of them, trunk swinging absently as if waiting. Then it turned slowly and began to lumber away.
Laden with sweets, the quartet stomped once more through the snow. Flurries, tossed about by the strengthening wind, danced in their faces. They headed through the nearest door, The Three Broomsticks, wanting to spend as little time in the cold as possible.
Draco fought to keep a smile hidden beneath his cold demeanor; they were in a crowd of students, after all, nearing the packed dining hall. “That’s the best idea you’ve had all week, Potter.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything,” Draco said in an unreadable tone. “You invited me here, after all,” He added, which seemed to satisfy Ron.
“It’ll be easier to kiss you,” Draco says breezily. “I want to see if we feel anything.”
Five people stood near the display window of DeWit’s Boutique, a relatively high-end clothing shop that Draco used to browse in when he was younger. Luna, Cassandra, and Tabitha all smiled politely when they approached.
“Thank you,” Harry said as Joey set down his cup. She nodded in reply, sat back down, and reached for her cake. She chewed in silence, crossing her legs and watching passerby out the window.
“I know, Potter,” Draco said brusquely, but Harry remained patient, reaching to touch Draco’s right wrist, lifting it higher.
Clarke,” Joey corrected. Melocotones’s wavy black hair, warm brown eyes, and broad smile were movie-star handsome. She disliked him immediately.
“Very well.”
Joey hadn’t known Draco for very long, but she figured even a complete stranger could sense how the air around him turned to ice. He stood, walking a wide circle around Dahlia’s body to lay a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “This is something we can discuss back home, Commander.”
Harry, Hermione, and Ron all exchanged meaningful looks. Of course, they remembered what had happened at Malfoy Manor the previous year, but this was their first time hearing about anything in particular happening between Draco and Luna.
I’m shocked.”
“Oh - thanks. No, I suppose not.” Draco walked over to his nightstand, picking up a mirror and a comb.
“Yes, well, I’m talking to you.” Draco took a deep breath. “I have something to confess.”
“Not for the night,” Draco decided. “Let’s explore the garden some more.”
Under cover of the chatter and downing of butterbeer, Draco quietly excused himself and slipped away towards the house. Harry didn’t realize he was gone until a few minutes later and flinched at the realization of his friend’s absence. Looking up, he saw the light glowing from behind drawn curtains on the seventh floor. A silhouette moved restlessly beyond it, pacing.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, mostly. My mother’s parents were Muggles.”
“‘There is much speculation about the nature of the Chosen One’s relationship with whom young wizards are calling the Heir to Evil,’” Pansy read loudly, practically waltzing through the common room, bringing as much attention to herself as possible. “‘One thing is for sure: Harry Potter has no idea what he’s gotten himself into. Hogwarts’s star pupil may have defeated the most powerful Dark wizard of this lifetime, but apparently, his combat skills don’t translate into common sense.’” Pansy threw a simpering look over her shoulder at Harry, who glared back.
“She’s not
Then, Lily, rich auburn hair matted with death’s sickly stench. The beautiful eyes that hovered over his crib, by his side after a football game, in the driver’s seat, stare like lifeless jewels.
, which sets Harry to wondering, as he rummages in his closet and heads for the bathroom, if Draco is being flirty on purpose. Part of Harry hopes that’s just his personality. Another part is warming up to the idea that Draco could, in fact, be interested in him. It’s nice to be wanted, even if he can’t want him back.
“Stunning, huh?” Harry smiled warmly at Draco, and he nodded.
“Mhm.” Ginny smelled of blossoms and sweat - similar to Draco, Harry realized, and he figured he must have a type. For a fleeting moment, Harry wondered if she still had feelings for him, even if she didn’t realize it. But Ginny’s touch held no sensuality; she was only helping out a friend. Perhaps last summer, Harry would have found this disappointing, but it pleased him to find that he didn’t care anymore.
“Hey.” Harry walked over to him and pressed a swift kiss to Draco’s lips before moving to his own bed, gently tucking the Nimbus beneath it. “How was your day?”
“So, you do that every night?” Draco asked.
“Oh, hold on to your pants,” George rolled his eyes and chuckled. He was dressed to the nines in his new WWW uniform, which consisted of a plum-colored suit, a lime-green undershirt, and an orange-banded top hat that curiously emitted smoke . “I’m sure Lee can keep the store from catching on fire in all the wrong places while I’m away. I’m just here to see you lot off.” He leaned to the side to look around their group. “Where’s Ginny?”
old wizarding families have had their run-ins with the Malfoys. And everyone knows the things Draco has done. The crimes he’s committed as a Death Eater.”
In the ensuing silence, the Slytherins dispersed, some still muttering about the article, others glancing at Hermione as if she either impressed or scared them. She settled back into the couch, next to her boyfriend, satisfied with herself.
“Yeah, kinda. I mostly just follow the Harpies, though. Had a crush on Ginny the second I saw her picture,” Lily confessed, and Ginny grinned at her.
“Do you want to talk about it?” A long pause. Draco, tight-lipped, looked as if he regretted speaking. “Keep no-”
“You’re close,” Harry purred into Malfoy’s ear. The Slytherin only moaned in response - his slicing had slowed, and his eyes seemed to be glazing over. Harry grazed his teeth down Draco’s neck. “Wait for me.”
It was Harry’s turn to feel flustered, his breath growing shallow as Draco shifted slightly, not-so-subtly raising his thigh to press between Harry’s legs.
She looked at the hut again, at the crags and thick forest surrounding it, teeming with beasts and providing plenty of places to hide. A dangerous place, despite its beauty. Untamed.
“I dunno about that. We’ve practically won already.”
“It’s not supposed ter be. ‘S not fair either, if you ask me. People oughta be able ter love who they want,” Hagrid’s expression hardened, and Harry wondered if he was talking about someone else. “Point is, you got ter get used to it. Toughen up, rely on your friends.”
Joey lowered her voice, furtively glancing around the wall of the next cubicle to make sure no one was listening. “The indentureship.”
“Could’ve been better, but it turned out okay. Come on, let’s not stand around and chat.”
Draco’s eyes were bright in the moonlight. A little over a year ago, they’d stood in this same spot, just graduated, arms laden with flowers and gazes full of stars. Hopeful, perhaps a little naïve, despite their battle scars. The youthful shine of happiness gleaned from the Hogwarts ball and their friends’ engagement hadn’t yet left them. Now, Harry couldn’t honestly say that they were filled to the brim with incandescent love and mirth. Moving to a new apartment, meeting new people, adjusting to more demanding coursework, all while coming back to the Manor, its halls stained with dark memories – it was hard. It had tested their relationship more than Harry thought it would. But he felt as head-over-heels with Draco as he did the snow-covered morning of their first kiss. If anything, he loved him even more.
“Wait, Luna.” Harry touched her arm in a companionable gesture. “Are you just going to talk to Malfoy like normal? Even after what his family did to you?”
In the end, Harry decided to walk around Cambridge by himself. He wasn’t sure if being alone with his thoughts was the best idea, but the city provided plenty of distractions. Magic and Muggle ingenuity breathed life into every corner. Storefronts glittered with touristy trinkets and expensive clothes, a tiny troll or two lurked beneath the beautifully arching bridges over the river Cam, and faeries joined the swans, pigeons, and sparrows fluttering about Cherry Hinton Park. Harry took the long route to the King’s College chapel, blending in with the crowd of young university students in his jeans and a light jacket, wand tucked securely inside.
As Luna moves away and the tap runs, Pansy plops back down on her armchair. She taps her chin thoughtfully.
“Help!”
“I will do my best,” Lucius was saying, tugging up his sleeves.
“Have you got a player or not?” Draco presses irritably. “Cover your ears, if you like. I want to hear what’s on it.”
“It was, um… Salisbury Prep. Back in England,” Tape-Harry continues, “God, I remember that first day so clearly. He was a new kid, so I talked to him to be friendly. He was really beautiful.” A rueful chuckle. “I can admit that now.”
“Potter, don’t you have class?” Madam Pomfrey materialized behind them, precariously holding three various-colored bottles. She glanced down at their entwined hands but made no comment.
Lily walks back in again, unperturbed that the nine-year-olds have aged twenty or so years, and Harry’s breath catches at the sight of her. His mother, as beautiful and comforting as a candle flame, lights up the familiar dining room. Harry’s memory blurs the edges, but he remembers the smell of turmeric and cardamom, the smooth, dark wood of the table, the view of the sleepy gray city outside.
As for the Dark Mark…
The guilt was killing him.
“I…” Yes, I do, Harry wants to say, but instead he shuts his eyes. Another beep sounds, and when he opens his eyes again, it’s another evening in the living room, the couch pulled out and the sheets unmade.
“Let’s go into your room,” Harry said quietly, and the pair moved to Bill’s old bedroom. Draco anxiously perched on the edge of the bed while Harry sat cross-legged near the pillows, setting down the bottle of ink on the nightstand. “We’ll keep it short,” Harry decided, “Just tell him what we know and how we found out. But I won’t mention your mum’s letter.”
“Yeah,” Harry replied.
“This?” Draco gestured, indicating the two of them. “How could I forget…”
“May I have this dance?” Harry asked, though their hands were already intertwined.
Joey felt Harry’s hand on her shoulder, a brief but reassuring touch. “Good luck, Clarke.”
“Found it!” Draco cried presently; they had finished cleaning the house and were rummaging in the attic. Compared to the rest of the house, it was positively cramped, dusty, and completely disorganized. Harry had anticipated running across a few Dark objects, maybe an enchanted mirror, or worse, preserved body parts. Instead, the items deemed unworthy for the modern Malfoy household were pleasingly ordinary: a gramophone, and a stack of records -
“Who’s good with children?” Draco asked. “One of you two can do it. I’m a terrible authority figure.”
The dim moonlight is watered-down milk, and Draco watches for only a moment before turning away, struck speechless.
know him?”
More so now, Luna reflects, because through multiple mail slots she’s pushed little nuggets of truth. The world will change, she believes, if only very slightly. With every tape that’s played.
“Nope.”
Ron exchanges a look with Hermione. She mutters something under her breath and goes back upstairs, obviously wanting no part in this. The corgi in Ron’s lap lets out an excited bark, sensing a change in the air. “Go on, Pig,” Ron says genially, pushing the dog onto the floor. It lands with a happy thump and goes scurrying into the kitchen. “Come here.”
Finally, the witch sighed contentedly, rolling up her sleeves to reveal deeply tanned, wrinkled skin. She leaned forward, letting her short gray hair spill over her shoulders.
overreaction, and I am sorry, I suppose, but you need to know that Draco isn’t a Death Eater anymore. You need to know he’s on our side.”
she offered, the name that lived inside her. Silver hands scooped it up, inspected it, and handed it back as a mask. She put it on.
Draco smirked. “Oh, yes.”
“Hey!” Hermione greeted. “Draco, that eyeshadow looks amazing on you.”
“I said, screw that. You’re not going to Azkaban. I’ll vouch for you, if I can; my say might mean something. The Ministry let you go to school one more year, they’re not going to send you to prison. You were just a kid.”
Joey stared at him. “All right. What game are we playing?”
” Harry pointed his wand at the dragon, and a red-hot spark bounced off its scales. The dragon roared in pain, its pinkish-black maw opening wide. “Now!”
Something immensely substantial and rock-hard crashes on Draco’s head. His eyes roll back, and he collapses onto the dusty floor.
A rogue Bludger suddenly whooshed past Draco’s head, and he jerked his broom reflexively. Draco’s side was shoved into Harry’s torso, and the Chosen One was so caught off guard by the contact he nearly forgot he was supposed to be mad at his friend. “Watch it yourself, Malfoy,” Harry managed. Draco only narrowed his eyes and flew off through the rain. Cursing his own hesitation, Harry zoomed off in the opposite direction.
did you call me?” Draco inquired, annoyed, but then he saw it too and smiled. “Oh. How cute.”
“No. This is not your fight. We’re going.”
Malfoy muttered to himself, one pale hand resting on his chin in a thoughtful gesture. He didn’t look up until Harry was right next to him, giving the young man a polite nod.
“What are you talking about? We just met.”
“Are you jealous or something?” Harry asked. “You seem to really hate her.”
The class stared at her in silence, slightly taken aback by her colorful personality.
It doesn’t take long to reach it, the lettering illegible in the darkness, Luna’s keys clinking from her coat pocket and into her hand. The motions are familiar, but the rooms are alien in the darkness, the dark angular shapes of the waiting room hostile in shadow. Luna heads straight for Padma’s office, striding past doors that hide beeping machinery.
“Ice cream, of course.”
Harry laughed. “Anytime, Malfoy.”
“Yeah, alright. Good luck.”
Even Pansy recognized that Hermione had thoroughly trounced her with razor-sharp remarks. Face furiously red, she lifted the magazine from the ground with a flick of her wand and seized it from the air. “I’ll get you back,” She muttered darkly at Draco and stalked away.
“She needs to know if she wants to trust us.” Draco’s grey eyes were commanding.
“Piss off, Malfoy,” Harry said with a grin.
Harry watched him work with fascination. Draco didn’t look up once, his pale hands fluttering over the potions with intense precision. He stirred the mixture slowly, which rapidly changed from dark gray to a forest green.
By the time Draco had finished, the Great Hall had been filled, and the food cooled. The mist outside had dissipated somewhat, and morning rays of sunshine streamed into the castle. Other students at the Gryffindor table glanced at the lone Slytherin within their midst, but no one dared to approach.
,” Harry pressed, picking up the pitcher full of it, “Which we have, and drink the lemonade before it melts.”
“I like apples.”
“Professor!” Harry gasped. He was focusing on the spell, too, but his green eyes flickered fearfully to her.
“Hiya, you three,” Luna said as they approached. Her long blue-and-bronze striped scarf was looped several times around her neck, and she carried a large white poster that was nearly as wide as she was tall. “Look at what Ginny made,” She said excitedly, turning the sign around for them to see.
“Just because I’m bi doesn’t mean I throw myself at every man I see. I adore Luna, if you must know.”
“I see. Let’s talk about the mission,” Joey said, all business-like again. “What would you say your strengths and weaknesses are?”
There was an awkward silence for a few minutes as three students glanced at each other and silently scrambled for conversation topics. Gavin didn’t seem interested in saying anything and focused on draining his butterbeer. Harry thought he wouldn’t mind speaking first, but couldn’t think of anything besides Quidditch, which seemed ill-timed since Ginny hoped to destroy the Ravenclaw team in about a month.
The kitchen activities continued as usual; Harry flipped a pancake, and it gave a hiss while Draco rummaged about in the fridge, bottles clinking against each other. Suddenly, Harry was hyperaware of how both of them stood, almost back-to-back in the small kitchen. He felt Draco without touching him, without seeing him, and a tiny, intrusive part of him planted an image of them in this exact position, facing away from each other, wands up, each protecting the other as violence waged a senseless tantrum around them.
Harry bit down a smile at their interactions, which were nearly as adorable as Ron’s and Hermione’s. He wondered how he didn’t notice Luna and Ginny were dating before; now that he knew, it seemed obvious.
Hermione nodded in agreement. “Not to mention all the shit you’ll go through now that Parkinson’s outed you,” She added grimly. “I think you’ll need allies now more than ever.”
He couldn’t stop himself from crying, so he didn’t even try.
“This is a nicer date than I expected, Potter,” Draco said as his gazed roved across the landscape. “I’m impressed.”
A tapping noise on the glass startled Draco, and he looked up to see Astoria Greengrass, another Hogwarts alumni he’d recently promoted to be assistant manager of his independent potions shop, The Sparrow’s Elixir. The employee’s workshops in the back were separated by unbreakable glass - total transparency in case anyone needed help.
Draco couldn’t tell how much time passed within the Room of Requirement. From the moment he stepped in, the chamber was steeped in pitch-black, as if someone had just thrown Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. He’d felt his way into a warm space, knees knocking against a bed-like shape; it was soft and cushy, and covered in plump pillows.
“I admit I’m not familiar,” Faraday mused, “But it seems to be working.” She hid the Dark Mark once more, and Draco immediately retrieved his wrist, redoing the buttons.
It would have been easier for Harry to push Draco away and leave him to his own devices. Perhaps, Harry wondered, he’d be better off doing so, as Draco would forever be a living reminder of the enemies that made his childhood a traumatizing quest against evil. But Harry knew that mercy was an option. There was always mercy and hope and forgiveness. “It’s okay,” Harry whispered, refusing to let go. “I’ve got you.”
“Hope you can feel like one of us, now, mate,” Ron said, clapping Draco’s shoulder, and he smiled hesitatingly.
As for Draco…
“I’d like you to call me.”
“Today was supposed to be his birthday,” Harry said as they started up another flight. “Him and George.”
“It’s a long and complicated history,” Harry said. A bloodstained school rivalry turned secret romance - it had been enough to draw judgment from Harry’s best friends. He couldn’t imagine what Joey’s reaction would be.
“Um, Professor Dahlia?” Ginny raised her quill. “This isn’t a final draft, right?”
“I must know you from there, then. I’m the assistant manager,” Draco says with an air of knowingly false superiority.
Harry’s lungs are filling with memories. Eyes the color of an overcast sky sink beneath the surface. Draco’s pale hand reaches out; Harry, callous, doesn’t take it.
“And these?” Harry placed the white blossoms into the water.
•    •    •
The air was still. Feeling discombobulated and guilty that he hadn't adequately listened to George's eulogy, Harry trailed after the others in their sea of black. He joined Ron and Hermione and watched with them as Fred's coffin landed with a soft bump in the deep grave. When the tufty-haired wizard sealed the hole with loose dirt, Harry was reminded of Dobby's grave by the shore. The sea lavender Luna had placed by it was surely dead by now, and Harry hoped Bill and Fleur remembered to put new ones in the jar.
Ginny, ever the diligent Chaser, continued trying to score, keeping her opponents engaged, but everyone’s attention was on the two Seekers. Hermione gasped; they looked to be on a collision course.
“Next week?” Harry’s eyebrows shot into his damp hair, and he took a moment to register the news. He didn’t much fancy dances, but Draco appeared so excited at the prospect that he didn’t even consider not attending. “Do you want to…?”
That was different. Harry crossed his arms over his chest in an apprehensive gesture. It almost sounded like Draco had betrayed his father in some way.
“Language,” The man chides. “There are young ears nearby.”
But Ginny’s question went unanswered, and the six students spent the remainder of the train ride in uneasy silence. The arrival at King’s Cross did little to quell their worries. Only once the group had Apparated just outside the Burrow, trunks and cages in hand, did Harry begin to relax. The house’s many lopsided roofs were covered in a fine powder of snow.
Nearly a year since they’d met in the alleyway, faces lit by the shy moon and stray lamplight. Silver eyes turning away even as they crinkled at the edges with gratitude. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Draco had loved him, just a little, even then.
“You’re the resident American.”
“Do you make it a habit to accost young women?”
Adrenaline raced through Joey’s veins as the monster lurched again, blood spattering across the dirty ground as Draco slashed it with a well-placed Gouging Hex. The krasue snarled, its guts spilling into the dust, its terrible head bowing.
“You fell asleep,” Draco stated, giving him a strange look, “And you missed some of the view, but nothing really happened. Why? What's the matter?”
” He asked, a bit clumsily. “Tell us.”
But it didn’t matter, not really, because Draco was still Draco no matter what he did in the past, and Harry had already fallen this deep. He might as well stay by his side, continue to help him grow, teach him how to forgive himself. For however long they were together, whether that be months, or years, or…
Harry reminded himself. Just because they’d gotten sidetracked as junior Aurors didn’t mean it wouldn’t happen five or ten years from now. He had to be prepared, emotionally and physically, for anything.
Luna drifted towards a large rock. With a twirl of her wand, she transfigured it into a carved stone bench. It was straightforward but lovely magic, and Harry couldn’t help but be impressed by it.
“That was quick. Why can’t you do that against us?” Harry teased.
Hermione’s lips were pressed into a thin line until she spoke. “I did like him,” She admitted, “But he’s gone too far. I believed he was truly changing, but he’s only been trying to gain our trust. I never thought he’d stoop so low as to seduce you.”
“Eighth years aren’t taking exams, sir,” Draco said, confused.
“I like girls, too,” Harry said, not looking at either of them. “What I’m trying to say is…er, I’m…”
“You didn’t tell me Ginny was…of your persuasion.”
“Oh, hush,” Draco said, biting back a laugh as he gave Harry a shove.
"A few have started to, yeah," Harry addressed Ron first, then turned to Hermione. "I agree. It sounded very strange.
; Padma often spots her flipping through it when things are slow in the reception room.
“I haven’t,” Harry said finally. “But I can see it’s hurting you. Let me help you, Draco. Talk to me about your day, let me know if anyone’s been bullying you. I want you to be happy.”
“What did you say to me?” Pansy looked at Harry as if sizing him up for a fight.
“Malfoy’s not playing, actually. He told me, when we were in the hospital wing, that he quit the team after his injury.”
“Tell me what?” The pitch of Draco’s voice had gone up a few increments, as it did whenever he got anxious.
There were a few tense, frustrated moments of silence, then Ron shook his head again, more relieved this time, and Hermione sighed before kissing Harry’s cheek and squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
“Harry.” Dawn’s already broken, bleeding gold through the window. Draco’s face is ethereal in the light, sky-blue hair mussed from sleep, treasured eyes gleaming with worry. “I wish you’d talk to me, my love.”
Luna recognizes it immediately, pale blue eyes widening. “Oh, my.” She takes the card, frowning. “I assume you are Mr. Potter?”
“Funny you say that,” Pansy simpered, “Because I don’t give a flying rat’s arse about you.” Despite her statement, the necklace grew intensely hot. He gripped his wand firmly and gritted his teeth against the pain. “Stand aside.”
“Potter - I…Sorry, I didn’t mean to…”
“And do either of them know you’re dating Draco Malfoy?”
“Pulled strings, huh? I’m sure she didn’t have to pull very hard.” Joey couldn’t keep the ice from her voice; she hadn’t quite forgiven Caroline for abandoning her sister and niece, rooting herself in England’s Ministry of Magic, of all places. Old history, but Joey often thought about how different everything would have turned out if Aunt Caroline had stayed. She thought about it every day, actually. “Head Auror has its perks.”
“She left her conclusion open because the Ministry of Magic hadn’t yet made a decision on approving same-sex marriage,” Harry went on. He surprised himself at how many details he could recall. “And they still haven’t.”
“Official since October, I believe?” Ginny looked at Luna, who nodded.
A few minutes later, the company of six brushed the ashes off their clothes as they stood by Diagon Alley’s main grate. Crowds of witches and wizards doing last-minute Christmas shopping thronged about the streets, arms laded with brightly colored bags and packages.
“That’s a shame. It would’ve been nice to get to know the talent for next year.”
Draco takes the gift. “What is it?”
“I do, but that’s not why I fell in love with her,” Justin insists. “And-and not to mention,” He adds, stammering with disbelief, “Your ‘boyfriend,’ or whatever, was getting his damn memory erased! Kind of seems like taking advantage of a guy in a vulnerable position.”
Cheers erupted throughout the stadium as Harry landed back on the grass, golden Snitch gripped tight in his fingers.
“I want to tell you something. Something I’ve never told anyone before. And I need you not to tell anyone else.”
A beat of silence.
“I’m scared, Potter,” Draco said. He stood before Harry, more emotionally vulnerable than he ever had been. For a single jarring moment, Harry saw past the snobby façade to the helpless, trapped child beneath. “You promise not to tell
Utter blackness met him at the threshold. A shiver ran through Harry as he realized that beyond it, the sunlight didn’t pierce the shadow, as if the entire Room of Requirement was filled with unmovable ink. “Draco?” He called cautiously, reluctant to step inside.
“Start with that, then,” Ginny suggested. “Come out to them as bi first, so they’re not completely surprised when you tell them you’re dating. Small steps.”
Harry joined him not long later, looking perfectly at ease in a green T-shirt and khaki shorts. His emerald eyes followed Draco’s to the pier, where their ship, the
“I’m talking about the memory erasure. What are
.” She chuckled, but none of the others moved a muscle. Draco wasn’t in the mood to laugh; he wanted to get this over with, and from Harry’s tired expression, he did, too. “But he’s right to remain vigilant,” Faraday continued. “Having wands out in the open will get you into more trouble than you can handle.”
“Hey.” A familiar hand slid warmly over Draco’s shoulder, and he jumped.
“I’m all right, thanks.”
in his mind.
sounded behind him. Draco spun around immediately, wand outstretched, and came face to face with Harry Potter.
“Can you shut up? I’m too tired for that shit.”
Dahlia gave him a searching look, then shrugged. “Right on. You guys can go in if you want. I’ll be back in a mo’, just need to send a letter.” She held the door open for them, and the trio filed in with murmured thanks. “Oh, hey,” Professor Dahlia added, “Could you stack the desks? Just to clear a space.”
Harry and Draco saw rabbits quite frequently in the hours whiled away at parks or during holidays spent in woodsy places. He decided dreaming of them meant nothing.
Harry let the silence linger, his mind simultaneously running through the tape as well as figuring out what to say. Like Draco, he tried to keep his past at an arm’s length. But Hermione, Ron, and even Ginny, despite how much he loves them, make it hard to forget everything. Harry watches as Draco, a complete stranger, sits up, wipes his eyes, and puts on a face of determination.
It was Draco’s room. Three times the size of Harry’s old bedroom back at the Dursley’s, with a high ceiling, an adjoining balcony, a large four-poster bed draped in an emerald-colored comforter, a walk-in closet, a neatly organized desk and a fireplace on one end. A bulletin board took up about half of one wall, and Harry approached it curiously. He spotted a few newspaper clippings with bold headlines like
•   •   •
“Go on,” Carraway said, flapping his hands. “I’ll watch.”
Harry’s eyes ache with unfallen tears at the thought of how much he wants Draco. Funny how he never stopped wanting him. Yet Draco hadn’t felt the same.
“You could ask the same question about blood purity,” Joey interjected, and Draco immediately shut up, lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m not discussing this.”
Dr. Patil raises her brows. Her beringed hands are folded on her desk, scattered with documents, folders, photographs, and a cassette player. Despite the disarray of her workspace, the doctor herself has rigid posture, a neat black bun, and a demeanor that lets Harry know that she means business. “That is unfortunate. Please, have a seat, Mr. Potter.”
“Came in last night,” Harry told him, smiling. “George’s mail-order system operates with the speed of light, honestly…”
“What?” Harry said, caught off guard by the suggestion. “What, no, I stopped being a Parselmouth when…you know.”
“How did you get the Aurors here? Were you warned? Have you got any healing potions?”
and numerous question marks floated haphazardly within the writing. Harry, who had only come up with a tentative thesis for his own essay, felt woefully underprepared compared to Draco’s research.
“Oh, don’t start that again,” Gavin griped at his girlfriend. “I told you I was sorry, didn’t I? Can’t you let it go?”
Draco held up his wand, still marveling at the magic it had performed only moments before. “Yes,” He replied, and he wasn’t lying, not even to himself. “I know I can.”
“Don’t you?” Draco said incredulously.
What? The word flits across Harry’s mind without time to say it aloud, and he marches up to Draco with a racing heart and a strange feeling of foreboding. He looks over his shoulder, and there it is in black ink, Harry Potter over Draco Malfoy.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, I could tell. So,” He regrettably drew away, retrieving his own mug. “How’d it go?”
“You want to know the best part of this?” Lucius says with relish, still holding his son’s arm. “He can make it disappear and reappear at will. Go on, Draco. Try it.”
“That sneaking little-”
He mentally kicked himself for even caring about that now, as her breathing grew shallower by the minute.
Not long later, a few sharp raps came at the front door. Harry skidded across the tiled foyer in his haste to open it; he got the feeling that Joey was someone who despised anything less than promptness. She stood before the doorway, face completely neutral, wearing the same Muggle collared blouse and jeans she’d worn to that morning’s meeting, minus wizard robes. Joey held a large, white cardboard box and as it came into view of Draco, standing in the kitchen, Harry could almost hear him perk up in interest.
“Cool. Oh, that was a good save,” Ginny whistled appreciatively, and placed a checkmark next to a name on her clipboard. “Group two, swap out!” She called, and the players obliged. “I’ll have you join them in a minute, so you can get a feel for the play.”
“Time to go,” Hermione said, and the group hastily stood to leave, Luna and Hermione flanking their friends from the watchful eyes of their fellow students. Luna walked with them all the way to Professor Dahlia’s classroom, said goodbye to each of her friends in turn, and twirled away to her own class, humming the same tune from before.
“It’s not that simple. I’m mad at them too.”
Hermione nodded and read the article aloud to them.
Joey nodded, wiping her cheeks. Harry let go. “I told you both all this because I want you to trust me,” She said. “I want you to know why I became an Auror. This is where I feel I’m needed, and I have the tools to fight.”
Dao suddenly grew very still, her eyes fluttering shut. Draco’s stomach lurched at the sight of her face, all at once terribly young with girlish features and full lips, yet old with deep forehead and frown lines, as well as snow-white hair at the roots.
Lockhart’s facilities are narrow and messy. Luna, white lab coat swishing in her wake, takes up most of the hallway despite her slender frame. She knocks at the door of an office labeled with a bronze plaque: Dr. Padma Patil.
, Harry, quit being queer for two seconds,” Ron says good-naturedly, ruffling his hair.
Harry’s heart leaped at Ron’s statement. Small victory though it seemed, Harry felt that he was one step closer to getting Ron and Draco to be real friends. Perhaps one day before they left Hogwarts, the four of them could sit together in the Slytherin common room as they did now.
The barrel of a small, silver pistol was pressed to the side of Draco’s head.
“Time out, time out,” Ginny said after a while. Breathless, she collapsed onto the ground. The other six knelt down as well, warm and panting.
Immediately, the rabbit-faced witch stepped back, her dark eyes wide. For the first time, she looked unsteady, caught off guard.
“Maybe we can have a bit of space,” Draco says. “You’re still looking for another job, right? I know you’ve got loads to worry about.”
His face turned ashen, gaze fixed upon the same line that Harry could not look away from.
In which Draco begins to recover.
“You don't have to do anything,” said the second woman, and Joey realized with a jolt that it was Dao, her eyes wide and young, her face smooth save for the crinkled brow. “Only come back home. Please.”
“Bit late, isn’t it?” Draco sipped, the warm beverage making him feel like himself again.
“He’ll take it much better than anyone else,” Harry said, and somehow, he felt sure about that. “And I can tell him what happened when I told Ron and Hermione. You want to know what happened, don’t you?” He asked slyly.
“Bullying you.”
"Why are you here?" Harry whispered as quietly as he could.
“Probably not with Dahlia.”
“You will succeed.” Snape sounds utterly sure. “The task will be completed, and the Dark Lord will be satisfied. Trust me on this.”
Harry picked up the painstakingly detailed notes, which seemed to record some sort of experiment. Phrases like
"When we're alone," Hermione admitted. Ron planted a kiss on her cheek, and she giggled. "Oh, you little flirt."
“Really?” Draco sat forward eagerly. “Did it work? Is she all right?”
It’s been a while since Harry’s been in England. But he recognizes it right away, the shift in the air, the velvet green, fog-shrouded moor that heads off beyond the football field. The sky is comfortably overcast. Chilly, Harry rubs his arms, and finds them clothed in tight black spandex, worn underneath his red and white striped jersey.
“If you get caught,” Draco said with a smirk. He finished off the apple and tossed its core to the ground.
Crabbe’s Killing Curse misses Hermione Granger only by a few feet, and Draco spots the furious look on Potter’s face. He sees for himself the raw, unwavering loyalty that Potter has for his friends, and it’s that same loyalty that moves his wand to send a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head.
“Shh.” Harry rested a hand on his arm to stop him, and they both came to a standstill. Luna continued forward, palming a chunk of bloody meat. She hummed, soft and slow, and Harry recognized the tune.
“Of course, we can fit you in on the twentieth of March.” She spots Harry, gives him a brief smile, and flips through a calendar as he approaches. “Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Thank you so much, Ms. Doolittle. Goodbye.” The receptionist tosses back a sheet of hair, revealing bright purple and green earrings made of seaglass, and a name tag: Luna Lovegood. “Yes, how may I help you?”
“I didn’t realize you changed your stance on this, Ron,” Hermione said, pleasantly surprised.
“I was thinking,” Hermione began, turning to Harry, “Remember when we ran into those dementors? And I couldn’t get my Patronus at first?” Harry nodded. “Usually, I, you know, think of a happy memory. Something that’s already happened.
Joey didn’t thank him. Instead, she leaned forward, and Draco caught a flash of silver. A necklace, one that hadn’t been visible earlier, swung from her neck. “We won’t tell Commander Connors. I assume, in time, you’ll tell her yourself.” Henderson was too stunned to answer. Joey calmly threw back the rest of her tea. “We’ll be leaving now.”
Draco thought fiercely.
“…I was thinking, maybe it would help to have more people around you. Not necessarily to share your wildest hopes and dreams with, but you know. More people to talk and listen to.”
“So…are you lesbian, too?” Harry asked cautiously.
Narcissa nodded sagely and pursed her lips. “Are you and he…?”
A gust of wind, blowing stray litter down the street, shook Harry from his thoughts. They were out in the open, on solid ground now. He went through the trained motions, keeping his bag close, looking over his shoulder every once in a while, taking note of any strange eye contact. Harry wished fervently for his wand, usually settled safely in a concealed holster on his forearm. But it, along with the other supplies, bumped around somewhere in his backpack. If someone attacked with magic - Harry’s blood grew cold at the realization - they’d have no way to defend themselves.
“That you know of,” Ron corrected, standing comfortably with the water at his knees. “If you come out, maybe others will follow. You’re the Chosen One, after all. Or shall I call you Desirable Bachelor No. 1?” He suggested with a mischievous grin, and Harry snorted.
Harry just barely noticed a jet of red light leaving his opponent’s hands, and he threw up a charm just in time to block it. Harry returned the Stunning Spell before the other wizard could react, and he fell over, stiff as a board.
Molly set the vase in the kitchen, where a shocking bouquet of irises, roses, and daisies had grown. Everyone gathered their haphazard stacks of presents, and Percy swept the torn wrapping paper and scattered ribbons into the bin with a flourish of his wand.
The woman sniffled, and as her head bent in sorrow, something fleshy and pink, stretching from just behind her chin, came into view. It extended as she moved slowly forward, her body widening in damp twists of shiny tissue.
After the whole “I-think-I-killed-someone” debacle, Harry was sure Draco had run out of secrets. But perhaps his Death Eater past was shrouded in more layers of shadow than he anticipated. Harry wondered how long this would go on for, the self-doubt, the guilt, the whispering of secrets in the dark.
