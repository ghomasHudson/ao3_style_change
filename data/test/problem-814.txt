"Okay." We laid down and cuddled and I eventually fell asleep.
The Weasley twins came over and sat on either side of me and Harry.
He then allowed her to fly in and he left. I did not allow him to see me and walked in. "Hedwig," I said.
I smiled and said, "love you to." We then came to a nice lake. The sun has began to rise making the lake look stunning.
Ron looked back at Blaise and said, "it's all my foult. I should have done somthing."
"I'm not sure. Not exactly what I expected." Harry said.
But Harry smiled brightly and hugged me saying loudly. "Thank you Draco I love you!" Gaining every ones attention.
He began kissing me again and continued to touch me.
I reached out for the snitch since I am so close, but the bludger hit my arm.
"Well if he does I'll kill him." I said, hoping to God he won't.
When I did not see Harry in the room, I opened the bathroom one and saw him passed out with a potion bottle in hand.
"It will be the best plan-"
I got up and walked out. I went to the Slytherin common room and sat down on a couch next to Draco. "Hey, are you alright?" He asked, putting an arm around my shoulder.
"Fine," Draco relented.
Harry and I walked up. "I'm so sorry. I'll leave you three alone." Ms. McGonagall said. And we heard her really leave.
After classes, my Harry was called up to dumducks office. Now I miss him so much.
Then he sent one back saying that he wishes he was there to and that he needs to go to sleep so good night.
He groaned and said, "Harry get off me. And we have time."
"But Draco." I said and frowned.
"Okay Draco. Love you." I said.
"We can go to Diagon ally tomorrow." Remus said.
Draco then thrusted himself inside of me, causing me to gasp. He moved really slow and I began to pant and moan.
So after the dreadful hours of studying with Hermione, we went to watch everyone sign up for the tournament.
"I don't want the potion. I think it makes fake feelings." I said.
Harry smiled sheepishly as dad took my other arm and mom took his. We apparate in front of my home.
"But I walked out and because of that I got kidnapped." Harry sobbed.
We stood at the doors as the music began playing. We slowly walked down the isle till we got to Mason. Thats when I realised that all my ideas were the same  as me and Draco's. When stood in front of each other as the guy began talking.
Draco grabbed my hand and began dragging me away from the Weasleys, the Malfoys and Hermione following.
He got to the front of the room. "That is how you make a entrance. Now in this class I will allow the foolish wand waving. Turn to page three hundred and ninety four." Snape said.
We went to Ron's room and Hermione said, "What did Draco say to you, Harry?"
I feel like some one is watching me, but I just shrugged it off.
"Harry is out of the closet." Ron informed her.
"Sorry love." I sighed, not meeting his eyes.
"Draco wake up," I said getting on top of him and hitting him with a pillow.
In the morning I could feel Draco's body next to mine. I turned over and he is sleeping silently next to me.
"But Dray. I'll kiss you if you do." He said, pouting. I think the snake is laughing.
"Well it's my job. So love, what are you wanting to do for your birth day?" I asked, hugging him.
Now, next step on getting Harry to like me. Ugh, what is it?
"Why do you have the cloak?" I asked.
"Night Blaise." Draco said, leading me up to his room.
After dinner and telling Mason about our adventures, Ron and Hermione left as me and Mason went up to our room. A few months ago Mason and I got our house and moved in together.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"I am good Harry. I am so happy for you. Draco is treating you great right?" Mason said.
Draco say next to me and Hermione winked at him. I blushed a bit and began eating. "So Harry did you have a good night." Ron said wiggling his eyebrows.
"Thank you for trying to cheer me up. But it's not working." I said and sobbed some more.
Then I sent one back saying good night and fell asleep.
"How?" I asked.
"But it's the break and I don't want to," I said and Ron nodded in agreement.
"Remus lupin." Dumbledore said.
After they talked for a bit mad eye said something and licked his lips. Then Harry started to go to Hagrids.
Once we got to his office we walked in and he is doing some work. "Hello boys what can I help you with? Lemon drop?" He said.
"Your Welcome draco!" Harry said beeming.
"Harry, what happened?" I asked.
I was halfway in the car when Uncle Vernon grabbed my foot.
"A sip every morning should work." I answered.
I groaned. "You know what I mean. Get up Harry. Its time for school." I shook him more.
Hagrid looked at my neck and nodded. "I see yeh marked Harry. Yeh know, t'night's the full moon. Yeh ready for it?" Hagrid said.
"Well then I guess that's fine. I'm sure lots of people can," he said trying to make himself feel better.
Then we saddly had to go to classes. Draco kissed me good bye and we went to classes.
I looked over at his friends. Hermione looked shocked and Ron was seething. He was very mad.
Draco p.o.v
As I passed Harry's and Ron's room I heard moaning. But I just passed the room and went to the kitchen. I sat next to Harry and Ms. Weasly said, "we're is Ron and Blaise?"
"Well, you don't have any feelings for me so why not?" Ron said.
We went to the great hall and began to eat. Remus came in. "Did you sleep good harry?" He asked.
I leaned down and kissed him, putting my tongue in his mouth and exploring every inch and crevasse. I then began biting and leaving love bites all over his neck and chest.
We all have our wands out and we took Lockheart out. "Harry where is the chamber of secrets?" Draco asked.
"No." I said.
When it was time to get ready I felt like a boy so I got on a male dress shirt and jeans. Then I went to the front doors to meet Draco. He is dressed in a white long-sleeved shirt and dress pants.
Both Draco's start fighting, one of them slowly getting red hair and shorter.
"Harry. You amaze me." Hermione said shaking her head.
"No. No it would have not. I mean, then you won't be here. What would life be like with out my great and famous Harry Potter with his great scar and broomstick? Go to sleep and I'm sure that it's all just fine." He reassured. He pulled me impossibly closer and I fell asleep.
I took a deep breath. "She was harassing Harry. So yes, I attacked her and threatened to kill her. So under mate law, what I done was legal." Draco said.
"It doesn't matter." I stated abruptly, and pried her off of me. Suddenly we heard a scratching sound at the portrait of the Fat Lady. Ron sighed and got up, heading to the portrait hole. We all turned our heads so we could see what was going on.
Ron came over and grabbed his arm to look at it. "Bloody Hell harry!" Ron said and dropped his arm.
I nodded as Mr. Weasley came in. I decided that he will walk me down the isle since he is like a father to me.
I saw Harry being pushed into the wall by Ginny who was practically rubbing herself on him.  Harry was trying to push her away. She grabbed his face and went in for a kiss.
When I woke again, and hear snores throughout the room. I look over at Draco who is sound asleep. I quickly checked the time and see that it's almost time to get up, and get ready for breakfast. I shake Draco awake and he looks at me sleepy. "Morning, Harry," he said, cuddling more to me.
"That's great!" I said.
After relaxing I  grabbed shampoo and began rubbing it into Harry's hair massaging his scalp. Then we both got up and I rinsed it off Harry. Then I did the same with conditioner. I then soaped up the rest of his body and rinsed him off.
We all sat down. "I don't know what she is planning. She won't tell me. She says that this is all your fault and that it is wrong and she will fix it. Make you not gay and not to worry about it."
"Why are you so concerned about him?" I asked.
We walked into the store and there are baby clothes, toys, and other essentials. "Are you sure this is a good idea?" Ron asked.
"I'm fine. Ron is just being a jerk." Harry replied.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
Flash back
Draco p.o.v
He laughed and we decided to go to bed. So Draco carried me up to our room and we went to sleep.
I hate life.
"I am very much a boy. Ask Draco." Harry said.
Then before I knew it it is wedding day. The Narcissa and Luciuas took care of the kids as me and Draco got ready. I am wearing a white flowing dress as Draco should be wearing a tux. Of course we are not able to see each other until it is time to walk down the isle.
The next day I was mentally preparing myself for what will happen. Though that is quite hard when not knowing what will happen. Draco has kept me close all day knowing that I am nervous.
"Okay love. Chop these up." Draco said, handing me a knife.
So we all grabbed a hand full of power and went to Saint Mungo's.
Hermione came over to us and sat down. "So, what did Hagrid say?" She asked.
"I always wanted to see the Malfoy house. I bet it's dark and scary." Ron said.
"Well I don't want to know in the future. I want to know now!" I yelled, getting madder by he minute.
"Are you sure this will be good to do with your parents home?" I asked, moving my hips to get more friction.
Harry frowned for a second, but then smiled again. "It was fine. Just went back to some bad memories." He said.
Remus p.o.v
So I began to eat. Not caring any more.
I can not believe that Blaise Parents beat him. But I guess that there is nothing that we can do now. Ron hugged Blaise and kissed his cheek.
The next morning I woke up and Harry's scent is back to normal, but still as good as ever.
"The answer is yes," Harry said turning his head to Ron.
"Thank you, Draco I love you," Harry said as he finished writing the last word.
"No we did not snog. Geez Pansy." Harry said, smiling and blushing.
He pulled out of me and collapsed beside me. I cuddled into him, the fire gone from my body.
I nodded and opened my arms so he can come and cuddle me. He slipped into the bed and cuddled me up to him. "How did you get here?" I asked.
"It's great Draco." He said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"Hm. Well I think you would have done well in there." Father said.
Harry p.o.v
"Cedric's death was a tragic acsadant."
"I'm sure it will be alright Draco. I'm sure something would be done sooner or later." Harry said taking my hand.
When we got to D.A.D.A, Lockhart talked about himself and only himself. Then, he gave us a quiz that is all about himself.
"Yeah. Well, who cares. Just as long as he doesn't mess with me." I said and Draco agreed.
The Minister shook his head. "It will only be for a year, then she will be out. Good bye." He said and Ginny then went through the floo and went away. The Weasley's then left, leaving Draco, Ron, Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, and I. I am sorry about this." Ms McGonagall said.
I looked at the teachers, but every thing seems normal there to.
After classes me Blaise and pansy wen to the griffendore common room to do hw with the golden trio.
I woke up and I'm holding Harry to me. I kissed his forehead and he woke up. "Morning Draco." He mumbled.
Time skip.
"Sorry." I said, looking back at my hand.
Then both Ron and Blaise slowly woke up blushed a little. Then began laughing at each other. We laughed with them then Ron said through his laughter, "okay who drew on us?"
"How did you get two?" I asked.
"And bring Draco." They exclaimed, in proper Weasley twin action.
My parents had left me at the loading station like every other year, saying their parting words before I left, along with the werewolf stuff that I had to know and remember. That wasn't the 'life changing part.' In fact, it almost seemed expected.
"But harry don't you think it's cheating?" Hermione asked.
"Thank you, Harry. I am forever in your dept." Dobby said and bowed.
I saw the snitch go straight up so I followed it going straight up.
"Thanks pans." Ron said.
"Draco be nice. Plus she is not that bad and was chosen from the ministry." Lucius said.
"And how am I going to do that?" Harry asked.
I woke up unusually warm and wrapped in a tight embrace. "Morning Harry." I heard Draco say.
"See, this is why I think of them as older brother and sister. Both so overprotective," I explained.
When I stepped back, I kissed his cheek and he looked confused.
Harry p.o.v
The next day it is time to go back to school and I think Harry feels depressed even with the potion.
Harry p.o.v
"Alright." He said.
The arena is now all rocky. And a Hungarian Horntail.
"Harry is not in heat, so no." Draco said.
"It's almost curfew. Let's go." Draco said and we got up. Blaise said bye to Ron and we all left.
Harry p.o.v
"Draco get off of ron!" I yelled grabbing draco's arms and dragging him off.
I tried but he just smiled at me.
"Take as much as you need." Harry said barring his neck.
In defense Mr Lupin asked Harry to stay behind and I made sure to glare at him. He just smiled at me.
He took me to an abandoned corridor and said, "Voldimort. Me and my family don't want to be with him. We want protection. So do Pansy and Blaise."
"Good. Now let's get ready for bed, then get some sleep. You need it." I said.
"You just allowed him to keep it?" Hermione said.
"Well the diary is magic and I can have a conversation with it, apparently. So I asked about the chamber and it showed me fifty years ago. Hagrid had a monster in the school and it attacked people. Tom killed it and got Hagrid in trouble though Hagrid did not know that it was hurting anyone. And some girl died in the bathroom." Was Harry's answer.
"I missed you. I really wanted you to come over." I said, pulling him closer.
He looked surprised. "That sounds horrible. How did he escape?" Harry said.
"Don't hurt him. It's fine just calm down. It's okay don't hurt him." I said.
Draco hugged me. "I will not leave you. But I will have them killed." He said.
Narcissa looked at me and I shrugged. So Narcissa and I went and Lucius showed up.
Our friends laugh and Ron said, "Mine was great. I got to spend time with Blaise." Blaise nodded in agreement.
It felt so good as he played around with me. I couldn't help myself, so I started moaning and he stopped and started kissing my neck. He slowly went up to my mouth and kissed me. Then he put his right hand next to my head and his left hand on my penis and squeezed. I moaned and groaned. "Yes." I whispered to Draco. He smiled and continued. I didn't want to feel like a doll, being played with, so I used my hands to feel him. I felt his neck and chest. It was strong, yet, fragile. Like glass. He smiled and stared at me. He looked right through me. I wanted him to feel the same, but I could see it in his eyes. He wanted more. I got up and layed on my stomach and he layed on top of me.
He blushed and said, "well. Um. I don't know."
"You'll never find him," he said.
He took his head off my chest. "No. He will warm up to me again." Harry said.
Draco took out his wand and said, "You're not going anywhere Lockheart. And what about all those things you said you done?"
Harry nodded. "The potion is good. Don't worry Draco I am fine." He said.
He tossed me onto our bed and straddled my waist. "What are you doing?" I asked, moving a bit to get comfortable.
"I'm always going to spend summer with Draco." Harry said, smiling.
When we got to the doors I kissed his cheek and went to sit with Pansy, Blaise, Goyle, and Crabbe.
"I wander what amazing stuff he will teach today?" Hermione said dreamily.
"Harry you are actually wearing a dress?" Ron said.
We walked inside and it's full of animal noises and smells like animals. We went up to the counter were there is a rat cage and the rats are doing tricks trying to be interesting. I watched them as Ron talked to the store lady then she gave him a potion and a cat jumped onto the counter. It has a squished looking face and ragged fur.
"Morning Draco." I said.
We went to her and she heals my scars, then went to our first class.
"Um well. You know. Um." Ron said not sure what to say. Then again Blaise and he have been dating for a week. Draco and I have been dating for two years and have not kissed like that.
"You can't just ask somebody like that. You have to at least sound like you mean it." I said earning another tap on the head and Ron was forced to look at his paper.
But all of that does not matter. As long as Harry is happy that's all that matters. I heard some one walking in the hallway so I pretended to sleep. The door opened and it's just Remus. He walked in Sirius behind him. "Of course he is here," Remus said.
"But Draco I don't want to worry Dumbledore. Especially if he has other things to. Snape has better things to do then worry about me." He said.
"Can we lay here for a bit?" He asked.
After we finished eating we went to our classes.
Harry p.o.v
"Want to know the truth? I dont know." I said, trying to sound as serious as I can.
Draco came down stairs. "Alright I have sent my letter. Something should be done soon." He said.
"I'm am not a puppy or dog." I said.
"Ron it's not your foult. You have nothing to be sorry for. Plus this is only somthing that will affect me once a month." Blaise said and kissed Ron.
"What?" I asked.
He smiled and leaned his head on my shoulder.
"Come one kids. Let's go it's about to start!" My mom said. So we ran out to our seats and watched the wedding.
"You're lying." He said.
"I'm sorry. But Harry Potter must leave." Dobby said.
The next morning i woke up tired since I got no sleep. Even with draco comforting me I was still to scared to sleep. At breakfast I ate silantly and slowly.
"Why can't we do something fun? I mean why do we need to?" Ron asked.
I now have two betas one is cs68127
I gave a small smile and the camera flashed. He then started boasting and gave me books. Then, I was able to walk away.
"Cedric is, but Umbridge is not yet." Blaise said.
"He only spends every minute of every day with him." May said, standing up to stand next to Ron.
Draco came over grabbed me and growled at Ginny.
"I don't want you to see me with out clothes." He said, blushing.
"Um....maybe later Harry. We have classes." I said, moving his hand down to rest on my knee.
"Draco dear, dinner time!" Mom yelled up stairs.
Draco smiled and said, "I can not wait tell Harry has my children."
Then we ridden them to the ministry.
"I still need to get dressed," I said.
"No i wont." He said.
"Yes. Everything is good today." I said as Draco nodded in agreement.
Harry nodded. Okay Lucius and Narcissa." He said.
"It's an invisibility cloak. Let's go." Harry said rapping it around me himself and Ron.
Draco p.o.v
"Remus is going to be focusing more on the order so he is quiting. Severus is going to be the new D.A.D.A teacher." Harry said.
Then, we finally made it to the station, and got off to see Hagrid calling the first years over to the boats. Hermione, Ron, and I, waved to him as we got onto the carrige.
I flipped through the pages a few times. I then closed the book and leaned back in the chair. I then got a amazing idea.
Then I woke up. My dick hard and me horny. Draco is asleep and it's almost time to get up. "Draco. Wake up." I said turning to face him. But he is awake smirking at me.
"You will find out Ron." He said rolling his eyes.
Me and Ron just walked to our table sitting next to Hermione. "Morning boys." Hermione said eating.
I held him to me and said, "you sire your okay?"
I hugged him. "Please don't leave. I need you." I said.
He turned over and just curled up to me and we fell alseep.
I looked at Draco who is staring off into space smiling. "Oh this is so grate. I can be a grandma." Narccisa said clapping her hands jumping a bit.
I lean down and kiss Harry and touch him. Harry would moan and pant, asking me to go harder and faster, until we both came.
I went to the bleachers as Dumbledore gave a pep talk. I guess to the Champions. Harry then walked into a Maze and looked at me before the wall closed.
"It's still cold." I said laying next to him.
That's when I saw the most scary thing ever. A black, almost skeletal like horse with wings. "Don't worry I can see them too." A girl with pale blonde hair, much like Malfoys said. She must have seen my scared expression. "You are just as sane as I am."
"Well, we were assigned homework we should get it done," Hermione said.
"Hey its okay. Your just fine. Come on, let's go tell Dumbledore. Maybe Snape can give you a potion to heal your hand." I said and tried to lead him, but he pulled away. "No. It's fine. It's not like he'd care." He said and I noticed his eyes are tearing up.
I can't believe I was making Draco think I don't love him. I thought he doesn't love me. What if he doesn't?
"Well that's next month and every one might forget by then. And I'm not leaving so you should want to stay here." I said pulling him closer.
"I'm not part of this conversation," Harry said walking out.
"Everyone but Mr. Malfoy out. Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley please go get something for Mr.Potter to eat. It's almost lunch." Ms. Pomfrey said.
The adults walked outside. "Alright Draco let's see why your mate is better than you." He teased.
"It's a bloody demon." Ron said disgustedly.
I scoffed. "No. You belong to me Harry. I will not be jealous of a bloody Hufflepuff!" I said.
"Yes somthing like that, much darker though." The elf replied thoughtfully.
"Hello, Harry and Draco," they said.
After the feast, we all went to the Gryffindor common room(yes including Blaise and Draco). There trunks sitting at the foot of our beds. So, we got ready for bed and fell asleep, me cuddling with my draco. I'm so happy I can have him again.
"Hell hounds, Basilisks, crazy murderers. You know, normal stuff." I said.
Sirius came in and shooed him away. "Harry! It's great to see you again. I hope Draco had taken good care of you." He said and hugged me.
"I said your name three times. Are you okay?" She asked.
He ordered and fed me then it was time for us to sleep.
I kissed his forehead and held him closer. hey no PDA in the common room." Hermione said walking in.
"Well I think that it would be nice of us to go visit if he thinks of us as friends." Hermione said.
"I want to marry you. If I did not I would have said no when you asked. I love you. Do I need to spell it out for you?" I said.
We all went back to what we were doing.
When we went downstairs Draco's mom said, "what took you two so long?"
"Well it's fun. Fetch!" Harry said, throwing the toy again.
"I'll ask Dumbledore." Harry said, smiling at me. "Your my little puppy. Yes you are. Yes you are." He said and hugged me.
I fell into the space almost instantly, and nodded fast. Ginny grabbed my hand, and we ran over. Ron and Hermione close behind.
"Take Hermione." I said.
"Why wouldn't I be. I mean my already overly famous friend got into the tournament." Ron replied bitterly.
She has tears falling down her face and began pleading for this not to happen. The Weasley's both look mad and slightly upset. "Please don't do this. She is only a child." Mrs Weasley said.
He eagerly kissed back but we did not go fast because it's not a good Idea to when we are sharing a tent.
"Well at least we go back tomorrow." Draco said.
After getting fitted we went out for ice cream and talked about the upcoming wedding. "I wonder what I would of done for mine and Harry's wedding. That'll be fun." I said, smiling to myself.
I shook her off, just wanting Harry right then. He couldn't do this. Many had died and he might too. He was way to young for this.
Snap sneard and said, "okay Mr. Potter. Let's get this over with." He then shouted the spell taking me back into my memorys. It showed my first year. Mettinh fluffy. Faceing voldimort. Then it skipped to second year. Draco claming I am his mate. Talking to me after o broke my arm. First time wearing a dress.
And of course, Harry's simplicity made it more embarrassing.
"Good for you Harry. What are they?" I asked as Hermione,Ron, Blaise, and Pansy seem to not believe him.
We went inside as a new house elf grabbed every thing and took it to my room. "New house elf?" I asked.
"I thought you have to be bitten to become a werewolf." Harry asked looking up to me.
"Malfoy tried killing himself because he hurt me and I don't love him." I said and shook my head.
We went to the great hall and Draco kept trying to hold my hand our put an arm around my waist, but I did not let him. We then sat down and Hermione looked at us both sceptically.
We stayed by the lake for the rest of the night then went back to the Castle.
"Okay. sorry." I said.
The next day we walked into the great hall and sat with Harry. Blaise sat next to Ron across from me and Harry. Then Pansy next to Ron. And Hermione next to Harry.
Harry p.o.v
So I mostly carried him from class to class and cooed over him.
"But packing is to much work and I'm tired." Harry said.
"You promise? You love me?" He asked.
"Hi, Ron. How was your trip in Egypt?" Draco said.
Both me and my brother are on our way to our first year of hogwarts. Then Blaises and Ron's kid Hugo came in and say with us. Along with Hermione's and Pansy's Rose.
I held my arms out. "Up." I said and made a grabbing motion with my hands.
"You're welcome..." I trailed off unsure what to call him. He kissed my cheek and left me there blushing and staring at my feet, embarrassed .
She got into Ron's face and yelled, "OH YES LET'S ALL THROW BOOKS AT MYRTLE BECAUSE SHE CAN'T FEEL IT! TEN POINTS IF IT GOES THROUGH HER STOMACH!!" she put her arm in Ron's stomach, "AND FIFTY IF IT GOES THROUGH HER HEAD!" And she put her arm in his head.
Harry blushed as I smirked giving them the answer. The girls just rolled there eyes as Ron and Blaise laughed at Harry's misfortune.
"No you're amazing Ron," Blaise said smiling at me.
The next day when I woke up Draco is already awake and looking at me. I just cuddled up to his chest and said, "morning Draco."
Draco p.o.v
"So since I'm dating you and gay I'm not under their spell?" I said. He nodded as the team came out and the game began.
Harry walked over to the sink and looked at it. He then spoke in parcel tung and the sinks opened up to a slide.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Well, technically it's my family's. But same thing." Draco said. "Plus it's safer for him then Mudbloods." He added.
"It's definitely not what you all do every year." Pansy said.
When we calmed down we sat in our chairs and began our homework. "Tomorrow we should go to the library and look up things for our next task," Hermione said.
"Morning Draco," I said as we sat down.
After checking Harry for cuts it is time for dinner.
"Godammit Ron! Can't you take a bloody hint!" He yelled standing up.
"I attacked no one I was with Draco the whole day. And I'm not gendered confused." He said.
"Hmm, good thing you did not anyways." Blaise said, smirking.
I nodded and began getting ready for class.
Draco ran at me and hugged me tight. "I missed you so much. Why did you leave me?" He asked.
"Okay my harry." I said.
"You can't do anything you want with him," Ron said.
We danced for a bit. When the song stopped we went back and sat with Ron and May. May is talking non stop and Ron is siting there scowling at Hermione and Krum. "Are you listening Ron?" She asked.
"Told him the task. Why? You jealous?" He said, smirking.
"So Draco do you know what the great surprise is?" Ron asked Draco.
When I walked out Draco came over. "So what happened?" He asked.
"Hello sir. Harry we heard what happened. We came here as quick as possible." Sirius said.
"Harry pleas. Will a kiss make it better?" He said putting a hand on my shoulder but I brushed it off.
At the end of the day we ate dinner no one asking Harry a thing about his gendernutral actions.
"Yeah, but I wish she would hurry up. And how were you able to get into the girl's dorms?" Ron said.
"Yea. I guess that would be very hard." Ron said.
"No harry. This is not your fault it's Voldimort." I said.
"I'm sure we will have a fine teacher next year," Ron said.
"I'll give you my blood. I accept you." He said.
"He went to go and get changed. You should too." She said.
I then used a spell so I won't feel pain and so that Draco will not know I'm hurting myself. Then I used a spell to cut at my skin. I smiled as I done so a few times at each arm. I watched as my blood leaked through my skin and onto the counter. After a few minutes I got out the medical kit and wrapped my arms with cloth and taped it up.
"Yes. Right on the lips." Then Harry began giggling again.
Everyone crowded around us as he opened it. When he did, however, it started screeching. I covered my ears, probably being the most affected, being a werewolf and all. Harry finally closed it.
Me and Harry went to the Gryffindor common room.
"No. I need to get dressed and everything." I said.
"Cuddle me?" I asked holding my arms out.
Me and harry laughed as Ron and Blaise scowled at us and cursed at them.
Draco, I can tell is worried. I smiled at him and three men came in. They went to the counter acting normal. But both Ron and Blaise must have served danger since the both took out there wands.
"I don't care what Mr. Potter wears. Just as long as it's school appropriate and does not disturb my teaching." Snape drawled.
•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~• Draco p.o.v
Sirius smiled. "Why exactly did Draco use that spell anyway?" He asked.
"By Harry." Pansy said and left.
We walked into the great hall were Cedric is sitting at the hufflelpuff table and Dumbledore is talking to him.
"Alright let's go study," Hermione said.
I gasped at the new feeling but quickly got used to it. He began moving in and out terribly slow.
He began kissing me and pushed me onto my back. He ripped of my shirt and jeans as I done the same to Draco.
"He is not good looking and decently not smart," I said.
"Um. Hi, and yes but I don't know how to make them." I said a little confused.
"Morning boys," Pansy said.
We ran and looked back just as the executioner killed Buckbeak. Hermione leaned into Harry and cried. Harry stood there in shock and hugged Hermione.
So now at dinner I of course only told them the first bit. Not Draco telling me he loves Harry and our conversation after that.
"Cornish Pixies," she said smiling smugly.
"Oh come on. I am sure he will like you. Especially if you are dating me." I said.
"You're just jealous," Hermione said.
"I know that, but can he at least say he is coming over or be invited." Remus said and they walked out.
I glared at Harry. "Why did you not bother to tell me this before?" I said. He looked at Sirius as I started to stalk forward.
"He needs rest." Hermione said.
"What about me?" Ron said I guess felling left out of the conversation.
I laughed and said, "okay true I'm sorry. But we just needed to make sure Harry was okay. We were quite worred when we did not see Harry in bed when we woke up. Then we saw he was in your room. So we had to come and check on him."
He opened the door and said "yes Draco?"
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Honestly Ron, Snape does have emotions you know." She scolded.
Me and Harry laughed. "Why not ask one while she is with her friends. You're one of Harry's best friends. I'm sure she'll say yes." I said.
I have waited for almost all my time. So I quickly took both Draco and the girl and began swimming up. Slowly everything began to change.
"Stop bloody teasing and open the egg." I said.
"Draco why?" Pansy asked.
"No one will mess with McGonagall." Blaise said.
"Harry, do your homework," Draco said nudging me.
What?" Mr. Malfoy said.
"I'm fine Hermione. I just want to cuddle Draco." Harry said.
I read them over and they are filled with nasty words. I ripped them up. "She is wrong. I love you. You are beautiful, strong, smart and every thing I can hope for in a mate." I said, hugging him and kissing his forehead.
"Alright. Put back on your shirt. Its time to go to your occlumency lesson." I said.
Then the girls chased us out of the room. "Don't hurt my Harry!" Draco yelled to us.
Harry blushed some more and said, "I'm sorry."
I then cuddled up to Harry guessing there not mad.
He cuddled to me and said, "I love you to my Draco."
Draco p.o.v
"It's okay Harry. I'll be here, I'll always be here." Mason said rubbing my back.
The more I thought about this the more angry I got. Harry woke up. "Hey Draco. Is it dinner time yet?" He asked.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
The next day I met Harry at his table for breakfast with Pansy and Blaise. "Hello, my Harry. How was your night?" I asked.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Harry, what are you dressed as?" Hermione asked.
After my practice, we went to the library and started our research.
But Ron freaked out and passed out. So harry calmly got up and got Lucif off Ron's neck.
We got up and I found my parents, Lucius and Narcissa. "Hey Draco and Harry." Mom said.
I even think I heard Draco scream.
Die. I thought. "We can go get some candy." I said.
He then began kissing me again and I tangled my hands into his hair and pulling on it a bit.
"Good." He said.
"I'm just scared Draco," Harry said.
Harry p.o.v
"Harry would you like silk or linen?" Draco asked me, looking through racks of clothing.
We went down stairs and sat at the table.
I began nipping at Harry's neck, causing him to gasp. Then I bit into his neck hard, making him moan. "Dracooo." He whined.
"Think of your happiest memory, and say expecto patronum." I said. "Then a misty animal will appear and ward them off." I added.
Then I went. Draco stayed next to me while I grinning like an idiot and I have no clue why. I first opend the presents from every one but Draco.
I froze. Then I slowly got up and went to were the teachers three wizards and the headmasters are.
Dumbldore then walked in with Remus and Dumbldore said, "good morning every one there is no classes today. But Remus Lupin has come back and is going to be teaching defence against the dark arts again."
"Just sleep." I said smirking.
His breathing eventually slowed down and his body relaxed.
We all laughed at Ron and Harry said, "It takes practice. But don't worry, it's not like you are going to ever wear them," and she took back the shoes.
"But Draco. It's hard." Harry said leaning against me.
"Yes I'm sure you men are." Hermione said.
"Who wants me to open it?" He said and every one cheered. "You want me to open it?" He said.
Draco p.o.v
"I'm fine. Just don't want to sleep." I said.
I shrugged and said, "I will give him some. And he can give me some to. Harry so just so cute."
Harry p.o.v
"I made him take vertuseriom." Hermione said grinning.
Time skip to 30 minutes until the Yule Ball.
"That's what you're worried about?" I asked incredulously.
"Mine was normal." Hermione said, shrugging.
"You two sound like children." Draco said, tightening his hold on me.
"You should not say his name." Ron said.
Ron, Blaise, and Pansy came up as Dumbledore gave us the scores, Harry gaining second place. "Good job my Harry," I said and kissed his cheek.
"Well he is your soul mate and soule mates are able to chose familiar's for eachother." Lucif said.
"Morning." I replied.
"That sounds like a good plan." I said and kissed the top of his head.
I stayed in Draco's room cuddled to him and we fell asleep.
"You. Only you Harry can probably be the most dangerous person to hang out with." Ron said.
Madam Poppy ran scans and I asked her about it but she said it'll be hard to tell this far in if he is. So she ran scans and said that it is a big possible. And to bring him back in a week if this continues.
He began grinding against me and sucking at my chest and neck.
All day he has not let me out of his sight. He even tries to go inside our bathroom with me.
"Good morning Draco. What can I do for you?" He asked.
We got out of the memory. "Did you have a crush on me?"  Draco asked.
"Are you okay?" Draco asked. I want to say no, but I don't want to worry him. "Yes. A little sad that Cedric died but I'll be fine." I said.
"And what is this plan?" Hermione gazed at the two with suspicion before shaking her head.
"I love you to Draco. Night." He said back and we both fell asleep.
Eyyyy! I hoped you enjoyed! BYEEEEEEEE!
He shook his head and I said, "you'll be fine." And we apparated.
I told him bye, kissed his cheek, and walked away with Pansy and Blaise to charms. "You sure Harry will be fine with Umbridge?" Pansy asked.
"I'll be fine Hermione. Ron is a prefect and trying out to." I said.
"Well maybe because you like to put yourself in danger. Or find it." Ron suggested.
He sent an astonished gaze my way. "If you don't want to, you don't have to Harry." Draco said shaking his head.
"Yes. What are we going to do?" Draco asked.
"Aww. Is my poor little Harry sleep deprived?" I asked.
"We should probably get up and go to Dinner or, Hermione and Ron will come in her,." Harry mumbled, cuddling to me.
After our bath we went down to the great hall for breakfast. "We're have you two been!?" Hermione yelled.
"Hey I ate a bit." Draco said.
"No." I said, deciding to talk to him, since when I don't bad things happen. "I think Dumbledore thinks I'm a lost cause now. Since I tried suicide twice and thanks to me every one thinks we are crazy." I buried my face in his chest. "I should have died. It would have made everything better." I said.
"Don't worry I am sure that you will one day." Hermione said and patted Blaise's arm.
"Oh come on Harry you are very good at this. I mean Luna and her father look super foolish and there not worrying about it." I said indicating to the father and daughter waving  there hands around and moving in circles.
"There. There is something pulling the carriges." I said.
I sighed as I cuddled closer to Mason. My boyfriend/fiancee.
"And I'm guessing that you want to have some fun in your bed room." I said and kissed his neck.
"But Draco-" I was about to complain, but Draco interrupted me. "Harry this is important. Just drink." He said. I took it and took a sip like he said.
"How exactly do you plan on that?" He asked.
"I'm sorry Harry. I love you. But if we don't go Hermione will kill us for being late." He said and kissed my cheek getting up.
"I'm not a puppy." I said.
"Well we can't think of anything." Hermione said, shrugging.
*Harry's P.O.V.*
Since Professer Lupin did not want to speak with us me and Blaise went to the comments room and Blaise pushed me into the bed closed the curtens and began kissing me.
I rolled my eyes. "We need to stop drawing so much attention to ourselves." I said.
"I thought I was your most favorite. What about Draco." Harry said, pouting.
"Why him?" Ron questioned, probably astonished that she wouldn't go to the headmaster.
I stormed into the Slythren common room all the way to my room.
"Who cursed you?" Ron asked, earning a glare from harry and an elbow to the side from Hermione.
The first place we went to is a jewelry shop and Draco started to look at rings. "Oh my God! Are you going to propose to him?" I asked.
We are standing outside a restaurant and the sun is soon going to set. We walked in and Draco told them that we have a reservation under Drarry, which made me laugh. But they took us to a seat not questioning a thing.
I just took his chin in between my pointer and thumb and kissed him. "See still did." I said.
"I will find out." Hermione said. She got up and walked out of the hall.
I felt a little hurt but understood.
Draco p.o.v
"Now tell me. What's it like to walk in heels?" I said.
"Sure." We walked up quietly without Pansy and Hermione. We heard moaning and Draco smirked.
I went back to the common room, wishing I could be there with Harry.
He smiled and said, "fine I'll ask him. Just because you are so adorable." And he pinched my cheek.
"Fiiiine." He said and got up.
"Harry, Draco that will be bad he's a teacher," Hermione protested but we ignored her.  We then signed up for the dueling club and walked out.
"Girls are so strange." Ron said staring at Pansy like she is the most insane person in the world.
I woke up me and Harry cuddled together on a soft bed. For just a minute I almost forgot about the war and the danger that Harry is in. Harry moved a bit and opened his bright green eyes. I smiled down at him and he grinned back up to me. I leaned down and began kissing him rolling on top of him and rubbing up against him. He groaned and rubbed back as I broke the kiss to start nipping at his neck. He gasped and I can feel his aroused. I bit down on his neck and began drinking up the blood.
"Sorry love, but I will never let you beat me." I said.
"Okay harry. I'll not try and kill Ron again." Lucif said.
"Draco pay attention." Pansy said to me sharply.
"He killed them and he was their friend," he cried.
Of course, this was normal for me with the Gryffindors since I told them I was gay. Every time a boy looked at me for too long they started teasing. Though Ginny wouldn't give up. She was even coming over right then.
"Don't worry Harry. He is just trying to look out for you." Hermione said.
"You better not. Or I'll kill you." Ron said.
We went there Lockheart still at wand point. When we walked in Myrtle was there. "Hello, what are you all doing here?" Myrtle said looking at us.
"Draco what did you do?" Ron asked angerly.
"Naaa." Me and Ron said as I pouted again.
"I'm sorry master but Harry can not be here it's unsafe. The chamber is open." Dobby said.
"Oh don't worry Ron. I'll sure it'll all be fine." I said reassuringly.
Ron did the same and we walked into the building planning our payback.
I pouted back and said, "but Harry!"
I hugged him and kissed him them there is a bright flash.
"Ya it was okay." I said, hoping Draco does not force me to sleep again.
As we walked back, I was thinking about Draco: if I accept him, he might be able to save me from Dursleys and he will love me unconditionally. But this could be a prank and I know nothing about vampires.
Draco p.o.v
"Yes. How about you?" He asked.
For the rest of the day we stayed in and at night I got Harry to sleep in my bed and we fell asleep with Harry cuddled into me.
Draco grinned and said, "there will be room for them to."
"Harry are you okay?" I asked on our way to breakfast.
I rolled my eyes and licked the wound close. "Harry, not with your godparents here." I said.
I was beaten with the metal end of a belt, which cut me to the point that I knew the marks would scar. Bars were put on my window and three, large locks were put on my door.
After lunch I decided to take Harry to the room of requirement and we fell asleep there. Nobody messed with us for the rest of the day.
"Yes I did. Did you have fun?" I asked as he put his arms around me.
"I don't know. I mean I have no idea what it is." I said looking at my lap.
"Love you, too, Draco." I said, laughing.
When we went to our common room, I went to my room - Slytherins have their own rooms.
We got up and fixed ourselves and walked out.
"I think it's cute."I said grinning.
"No that could not have happned. I mean he is a werewolf and a grown adult." Draco said.
The next day at potions I could very strongly smell Harry as we sat down.
I moaned as Draco kissed and bit me.
Mason followed and said, "so who was that Malfoy person?" Mason asked.
"Draco." I said and swam as quickly as possible to him. I looked besides him and saw Hermione, Cho, and some little girl.
Hermione glared at Harry and said, "I don't care. Do your work."
"No thank you." We said.
As we sat at our tables I looked at my hand suprised no one has noticed the writing. I just placed both my hands under that table as Umbrige came in and began class. This time I made no comment and done as told.
"Harry this is important. Ginny is not good to have around you." Blaise said.
We stopped and I immediately smelled blood. I looked at the wall and said out loud, "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir beware."
I hugged him close. "Yep. Our last year. Are any of you planing on getting a job here?" I said.
I woke up from a nap being shaken awake by Ron."mm what?" I said sitting up rubbing sleep out of my eyes.
"It's to normal for us." Harry said.
We went to the Ravenclaw common room there house ghost said we can find the diadem there. The painting then said, "what walks on four legs in the morning two legs in the eavning and three at night."
For the rest of the break, we hung out and did our homework the last day.
I sighed and ran my hand up and down his side. "Don't worry Harry it'll be fine. I am sure Snape won't judge you for me and you having sex or anything. Don't worry about it my Harry." I said and kissed the top of his head.
The strange thing is though that this was not happening before.
After dinner we went to our dorm room and went to sleep in peace.
He nodded he flew fast toward me. I doged and he kept going. That's when I noticed the snitch. I flew after both Harry and the snitch.
I went to the loo and when I was done, I saw Malfoy. He turned around and said, "Granger may we talk?"
Draco p.o.v
"O-Okay." He said, baring his neck.
When we got done I went to bed trying to think of quidditch and not  Malfoy.
"I am sorry, but Narcissa could not make it. What was so urgent." He said.
So we got up and got ready me feeling like a boy today got dressed in the boys uniform.
"Yes he did. I'm sure every one is fine with that. He is my mate, so he can." I said, somewhat defensive.
A black figure passed by the door and slowly opened it. There is a flying black cloak that reminded me of death. He came closer and I heard Draco growl as I felt myself grow weak and tired. I heard a woman screaming and saw a flash of green light as I passed out.
"No your not Harry. You are to nice to be turning into Voldimort. And when we get back from our now early Christmas break you will start iclomency. That is the reason why you saw what Voldimort is doing. He used a spell so you need to learn iclomency." I said and kissed him.
We went back to the house and every one left.
"That you called her a lier?"
"Okay," was my reply.
Then. The pink lady came in.
"You're cute when you're flustered," Blaise said smiling.
I nodded and he began moving in and out of me. I moaned and tried pushing back to make it feel better. Draco laughed and kissed my neck.
"I'm sorry Draco." I said.
"But Draco. It tastes bad." I said.
We then pulled up to Hogwarts and hopped off. I kept glancing back at the horses until I could not see them. Those are some scary looking things. I want my stuffie.
Me and Harry sat down and he cuddled to me.
"I'm telling you, Harry, it will not be good for you to accept him. I don't care if he bloody dies." Ron said taking another bite of food.
Hermione and Pansy ran up to the girl's dorm. And amazingly I was able to follow as the others fell down the stairs as it turned into a slide underneath their feet.
After we both laid on the bed cuddling each other exusted.
"But you can use that one spell. It's hilarious." I said, smiling.
I started pacing and heard the door open and three pairs of feet walk in.
We laughed. "Those two are worse then rabbits." Hermione said.
"I'm not a dog." I said.
"Never. Ha-ha... Draco please stop!" He said.
"I want you to write. I will not walk out of class again." Harry picked up his quill, but I snatched it from him. "This is illegal you bitch!" I yelled.
I shook my head and began eating.
"No its alright. We were just about to leave. Have a licorice snap. Though be careful. There rather sharp." Dumbledore said and they all left.
I was taken aback and said, "what do you mean?"
"I know right. I can't wait." Pansy said.
He then had us say it and line up. And Draco was all like, "this class is ridiculous." So I lightly hit him.
"Well let's apparate. Harry, you can hold Draco's arm." Father said.
"See you dad's. Love you both." He said joined Blaise's kid. And Hermione and Ron's kid.
"Harry pleas talk to me." Draco pleased.
After everyone was seated, Dumbledore got up. "As you all know, two schools will be visiting. One is Durmstrang. May the Durmstrang students come in." They put on a show  with smoke bombs and Flags marching around the Great Hall with random sparks, then sat down by the head master sitting at the table.
"We should go. Come on to my room!" Harry said and started pulling me to his room.
"Thank you, Mrs. Weasley," I said.
"I love you to." I said.
"No I did not break up with him, nor will I ever in the foreseeable future. So please just leave me alone." I said and went to walk past her. But she grabbed my wrist.
I can't belive I was so stupid. I can't take it. He does not deserve me. I got off his lap. "We should get ready."  I said.
"He's back... Voldemort's back!" Harry said and began sobbing again.
"That's what you said about Remus but he was good," I replied.
"No problem." He said.
Vernon fell out the window and let go of me, so I climbed all the way in and closed the door. "Happy birthday Harry," Ron said.
We got ready, separately, and walked out. "So you two ready for the day?" Sirius asked.
When me and Harry got back to the room of requirement, I pushed Harry against the wall, closed the door and began kissing him.
"Hermione has a good taste in people. I'm sure he is great." Harry said.
He got up and said, "no I mean it I'll kill him just like he killed them." And he put on his cloak and started going to the castle.
"I don't know. But that's not important." I said.
Draco got up. "Eat." He said.
"Your my Godson. I am supposed to like you. But since Draco is dating you I don't know what to say of him. " Sirius said and sat down. "Hello to the others to." He added.
"Draco there was nothing that you could have done. How about us four will get a dream less sleep potion and you can get Harry to be nice to you again." Pansy said and they left.
"That was different." I mumbled.
There was two popping sounds and the twins are sitting on eather side of us. "No this is interesting."
Harry's P.O.V.*
"Of course," I said smiling. I mean it may seem hurtful but it actually feels great.
Time skip to Christmas. (So after the dream of attacking Mr Weasley.)
"I'll be right back, stay here love," Draco said walking out. When he came back he gave me a long green skirt and a silver dress shirt.
In the morning we woke up and Harry seemed really tired.
"Come on dinner is done." I said and led everyone to the kitchen.
"Why did Harry and Ron say ew." Mom said.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
I nodded and Hermione got up saying, "I'll be back." And walked out.
"Leave him alone. He has been through enough." I growled.
Harry apparated away. I cannot believe this. Mason looked shocked and said. "Where did he go?"
I walked Harry to his first class of today which is defense with Hufflepuff.
It is valentine's day and Dumbledore came up with a stupid idea on how we can get our valentines. Harry and I agreed to give each other our presents in person.
After we read it, we learned nothing .
"Oh, okay. Ron will go first to show you." Ron stepped in taking some powder out of a bowl.
"Now why are you trying to suffocate Ron?" I asked Lucif.
"You. And what kind of snake Lucif is." I said.
Harry p.o.v (two hours before the ball.)
"To study for owls." Pansy said like that was obvious.
"You're so adorable. No wonder why every boy wants you." I said and kissed his nose.
Harry p.o.v
"I am not. I mean do you two think he is hot?" Ron asked.
I had finally gotten on the train after scrambling around with Ron and a laughing, but worried Hermione, who was thinking we would miss it, and found our own compartment. "So Harry, have you spoken to Sirius?" Hermione asked, breathing heavily, after she closed the door.
"I am buying some clothes for my friend. We will look around." Draco said, leading me over to some clothes.
I sat at the Gryffindor table and everyone looked at me strangely. "You're sitting here now Malfoy?" Ron asked and I nodded. "Well, welcome to Gryffindor. And good morning Harry." He said and started to stuff his face.
"Can we go take a bath?" I asked.
We read the wall and Lockhart said, "don't worry I will save her. I just need to go to my office and... get something."
I set it back on the night stand and layed back down with Draco cuddling up to him.
"How do you know I have nighmares?" I asked.
"Well, I'm sure that I will do well. I mean, I passed the first two tasks. I could do this one just as easily." I said smiling with confidence.
We looked at her. "What the bloody Hell are you doing here? Your suposed to be dead!" Blaise said. "I have my ways." She said.
"Well we are getting changed in separate   rooms." He said.
I leaned down and bit into Harry's neck and began drinking his blood. Harry moaned and rolled his hips against mine.
I flipped us over and said, "you are a bad boy."
"Welcome back gentlemen. Have you made your decision?" The nice lady at the counter asked.
Once I got the potion I ran back to the ROR and closed the door. Then I saw Harry laying on the bed, naked.
"Madam Pomfrey allowed us to have the rest of the day off." Harry said, smiling and sitting into my lap.
"Did you boys have a good sleep?" Hermione asked.
It's not that hard. But what if he does not care? What if he lets me die? I don't want to die.
"Why not? What did severus do?" I asked.
Draco p.o.v
I just shrugged and began to feed him,which  he done unwillingly.
I pushed him off. "Why did you kiss Hermione?" I asked and started crying.
"Have you guys even started dating." Hermine asked.
"It's okay. It's almost time to get up anyway." I said and we got ready for the day.
"More werewolves? Why?" I asked.
He then stoped that and sat up, straddling me. He then put himself inside of me and began thrusting inside of me.
Blaise and Ron came to me and told me what happened, so when I got to Harry's and Draco's room, Draco is passed out on the ground in front of the door and I quickly opened their door.
We went to the kitchen for breakfast. "The ministry found out about what happened and Hermione had a potion in her system. Ginny was the one to make it and she was taken home with mother." Ron said.
I slid the book I was reading over. "This was the first thing I flipped to." I said.
"Draco. You love me right?" He asked.
"To bad. I'm going to wear heels." I said and stood up.
"That your fiancée Potter? Thought you had better taste." Malfoy said.
"Draco stop kissing Harry and do the work." I heard Hermione say, but I ignored her.
I nodded and we began walking to the common room since its free period. "I still don't like him," I said.
"Because you are never here and its to hard to explain." Ron said.
he tried it one more time, then broke the door down.
"Hey, Harry. You alright?" I said.
Once we finished Harry decided to cuddle me. He just crawled onto me and cuddled me. "I Harry." I said and kissed his nose.
"No ,I would know, you can be cursed." I quickly rushed trying the muffle low laugh coming from me.
I growled at him. Some people oooed. "Possessive boyfriend much." someone said.
"Yes let's go meet the man that has tried countless times to kill Harry." Ron said.
"I promise." I said, crossing my heart.
"You know. While I was going to marry him I realized all my ideas were the ones I made with you." I said.
"Your doing great Harry." I said and quit my counting as Harry leaned closer, resting his head in my chest. We slowed down with the music as I wrapped my arms around him just holding him and swaying while turning in slow circles.
So we went and got everything that we needed.
"What did he say about her?" Hermione asked.
He smiled and said, "it's okay I would have done the same thing. If I was a wizard."
I got up and said, "okay. Then I'll just wear normal clothes then." And pulled on a pink frilly shirt and girl jeans that have designs on the butt. Because if you all have not guessed I'm feeling like a girl today.
I nodded grinning.
I laughed. "True. After strange things happen every year it is hard to know what normal is." Harry said.
"You ignored me all day then leave me horny." He said.
Hermione glared at him harder and said, "we are doing what I say we are doing. Got it!"
I sighed and said, "She didn't feel bad when she drew on you guys' faces."
Draco p.o.v
I nodded, then grinned. Maybe if I can get Potter to be my boyfriend, all will be better. I have a crush on him. So, It's not even fake love! I'll get two birds with one stone. "I won't let you down." I said, and ate happly.
Dumbledore came in and was hinting to saving him. Then he walked out locking the door. "I know what we need to do. You know how I have been every weird lately." She asked and we nodded. "Well, that is because of this." She said holding an hourglass thing.
"Well, it's a good thing. Um. May I have some blood?" Draco said.
"I killed the dark lord." Nevill said suprised.
Ron stiffened and said, "oh well. You see. Um. Harry has this magic item to see we're ever one is in hogwarts."
We talked a little bit untill Hermione decided that it is time for bed.
"Harry listen. Dumbledore does care. He, I think, is just having a hard time right now. This Harry is not good. Blood quills are horrible." I said, gabbing his hand.
We heard a knock at the door, but we just ignored it. Sadly though when it did not go away and became more aggressive, I sat up. "What do you want? We are busy." I yelled.
At lunch we sat down and began talking about our next class. Wich is DADA One of the twins then said, "We have had her. And she was horable. Won't even let us use magic."
"No harry." He replied.
"Well it may be normal but some people may think bad things if they see you in a sexual position," Pansy said like she is talking to children.
"The Maurauders map. It shows where everyone is in Hogwarts and on its ground at all times of the day. It's very useful for sneaking around." He said tiredly.
"I would never do such a thing. How dare you say that!" Ginny exclaimed.
"Hermione!!" Ron said.
Draco p.o.v
"I'll see you tomorrow Harry. Thank you for accepting me." Malfoy..Draco?said gratefully , looking at me and smiling.
The next day I woke up Draco cuddling me from behind. I turned over cuddling to him. When cold water splashed over us startling Draco awake and making me turn my head so fast I got win lash.
Harry's friends caught up to us.
They looked at Draco and he shook his head. "So you ready for the last task mate?" Ron asked me.
After a few minutes, I pulled away both of us breathing deeply.
I got back to Draco and Hermione. Ron went with hermione they can get me somthing.
We all knew what he meant. He now knows Sirius Black is his Godfather and was good friends with his parents. "When I find him I'll kill him." He said.
Ron looked at him, his eyes widened, "What if he's possessed?" Ron said meekly.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Yeah but I don't like the fact that another man wants you," Draco said.
Draco shrugged and I decided to try it. "Kreacher!" I yelled.
"Good job. Now I want you all to make amortentia and whoever does the best gets this liquid luck." Slughorn said.
"I'm your best man." He said all serious like.
Then I realized that I'm in the hospital wing. And what is next to me is Draco.
"Great now you can ride him," Hagrid said.
I picked one up and went back to the common room. I thought about the day and remeber that after every meal Harry went to the bathroom.
Afterwards, I went to the common room and sat next to Draco, across from my friends.
"Can you demonstrate?" He asked.
I nodded and glanced at Draco who is still staring at me. "But how are you so sure of it?" Ron asked.
"Are we sure he even exist?" Ron said.
"Thank you professor." He said.
I then sat on the couch with Harry on my lap.
"Don't call Dumbledore names." Harry chided
"Don't make fun of Hagrid," Harry said disapprovingly.
After we finished them I looked at Harry in the eyes, then I leaned in to kiss him. He leaned in and closed the gap quickly.
Hermione began getting me ready. I smiled since this time I really am getting married and it feels right. "I can't believe your marrying Draco. But he makes you happy." She said.
Harry p.o.v
"Hello, Ron where is Hermione?" Harry asked.
I ran over and hugged her tight. "Thank you." I said, and went back to Harry. I kissed him and we finished up the night and we decided to go to bed. Sadly, we didn't shower together, but we cuddled when we went to bed.
"Yeah. sure." I said, done with my food.
When they were done they both are red faced as Blaise looks sheepish and Ron mad.
Then Cedric came up in a bubble thing and took Cho. After pointing at his watch. Then a few moments later Victor as a shark came up and took Hermione.
"Not sure." I answerd.
I cuddled Harry and placed lightly kiss his forhead every once and a while. We did not talk or anything, we just enjoyed each other's presence, but then I felt the need to drink his blood. So, I laid him on his back, and got on top of him. I smiled, and he tilted his head to the side, giving me full access to his neck. I leant down bit into his neck, and began to drink his blood. He moaned and pushed his hips into mine.
I got up and hit the horcrux. The smoke disappeared and my friends woke up... but I continued to hit it. Draco and Blaise took the sword and Blaise hug me. "Okay, Ron, it's dead. What's wrong? Why are you crying?" Blaise said turning me to him.
I nodded and said, "thank you Ron. I was worried that. You know. Malfoy would get in-between you guys."
"No you don't. I love you too Harry." Mason said and kissed me. I kissed back as he pushed me against the counter.
Ginny p.o.v
He then began nipping and kissing my neck and jaw till he got back to my lips and began kissing me there again.
After classes we went to the library and I found as much books as I can about the depressing potion.
"Draco I don't like the book. Book bad." Harry said.
We then peacefully fell asleep.
Harry glanced at me and Ron asked, "Since when were you on first name basis with Hermione?"
He turned to me this green eyes showing anger and hate. "What do you want Malfoy."
"What ever you say Harry." Ron said and started eating again.
Draco smiled as I blushed.
"That's why I found a dead lizard in my bed that one time." Ron said.
"So? Well we are going to leave now. Don't forget to use protection." I said and pulled Draco out.
"Draco has told me you are acting strange. Does this have anything to do with the Ginny incident and Prophet?" I asked.
"I wish I could stay with you longer to Dracy poo." I said, cuddling more to him.
"I will never do such a thing. I love you. What happened was not your fault. This is not the answer Harry." Draco said and hugged me. "Please don't die Harry. I love you." He said.
"This is May. May it it seems like you know Ron already." I said.
"I don't think any of that. Ginny is an lying B***." I said, which made him laugh a little. "How has she been telling you this stuff?" I asked.
"Hey Harry," Draco said and came up to me. "I hope you don't try to eat the ground again." He said and laughed a little.
"Yah. But I would really want to spend more time with you." I said cuddling up to him.
"I don't feel like doing anything today." Harry said and leaned against me. I began to feed Harry and myself.
I picked him up and apparated to the hospital.
Draco p.ov
"So your mate is a boy?" Goyle asked.
When I got in, there were all sorts of magic going on: food cooking on its own, dishes cleaning themselves and a clock that says where everyone was.
"Well. You were great friends with my parents. When they died you disappeared. Every one thought you were dead. You came back long ago and you were crazy. Then you got hit by a spell and forgot every thing." Harry said.
"I forced him to sleep when he did not want it. It's obvious he is having night mares." I said.
"Thank you, Draco," I said hugging him.
"I don't know. But it's also a little funny." Draco said and poked me.
As we were about to leave Diagon Alley, we ran into none other than Malfoy. "Went to that baby shop, did you? Getting another sibling Weasley?"
Harry had him wrap around one of the post then came into bed and cuddled to me.
I hate this! Draco thinks I'm pregnant but, I'm not sure. I do remember being told that I can but, that does not mean I am!
"Okay. Well, have fun at Hagrid's. I will go and get started on homework." I said sadly, before walking away.
Hermione is looking out the side in shock or something. Harry asked what's going on. She said it's nothing as another rock hit a vase. We looked outside and saw the ministry so we snuck out the back.
Harry laughed. "Well Malfoy-Potter. I think it is the same as dating." He said. I laughed and continued kissing him. Harry began panting. "Draco. I-I feel hot. Please touch me." Harry begged. His sent became sweeter and stronger. "Are you alright with getting pregnat?" I asked. "Yes Draco. I'm fine with having our children." Harry said.
"Why now?" Ron asked.
Draco p.o.v
"Damn I thought he would never guess," Crouch Jr said.
I gasped and said, "but Draco I was kidding you're fun please don't change your mind."
I snuggled into Draco's side as he put an arm around my shoulder.
If I truly am crazy and Umbrige was sent to Azkaban then all of this was for nothing.
"Fine. You better." Ron said.
After lunch we went back to the Griffindore common room and went back to the seats.
"What do you want?" I said annoyed at her recent behavior.
Harry was about to say something but then said "Ow!" and held the back of his head.
I nodded and said, "sounds good."
Harry p.o.v
Mason shook his head and said, "if you marry me you will never be truly happy. I know you won't. Don't marry me for me. Do it for you. Don't worry about me. I will be okay. As I said. I knew this would not last."
"If he loved me he would not have broken up with me." I said and went to find Malfoy.
"Nothing. Don't worry I did not do a thing to get into truble." I said and grabbed some food to begin eating. Though I need some blood.
I just smiled. I don't like Remus. He is another male werewolf on my territory and he makes Harry smile. Only I should do that.
He kissed my cheek and people around us awed. It made me blush and Draco just pulled me closer to him.
"I love you too Harry." Draco then brought me in for a kiss.
"Go away whichever twin you are," I growled.
Ron and I looked at each other and began laughing.
"How did you see he was in my room before you came?" Draco asked.
"Oh your going to get it Weasl!" Draco yelled and jumped at Ron.
"Love you too." I said cuddling Draco.
"We destroy it. " Hermione said, rolling her eyes.
Harry p.o.v
A shrill voice cut through the room saying, "I'M COMING FOR YOU HARRY! I WILL HAVE YOU AS MINE!" It yelled and the letter then tore itself up.
I laughed a little and Harry rolled his eyes. "Come on its time for class. First off is defense with Slytherins." Hermione said standing up and we followed along with everyone else.
"Yes. Ron's okay. But he thinks it's his fault." Draco said. He looked at Harry and said,"Should we wake him?"
The painting opened and we walked in. The raven claw room is much like the griffendor. Just difrent colors. "So we're would  we find a diadm?" Pansy aske.
"All this time I have not had any blood. I'm so hungry." I said and kissed his neck.
"A time turner," Draco said.
"Great until I woke up to see Harry and Draco in a position - Draco sucking Harry's blood," Ron said glaring at us.
"I don't know. He is cute. Should I?" I said.
"Harry the answer is no," Ron said.
"I'm hoping for a normal year," I said.
"Do you ever stop thinking about Draco?" Ron asked.
I smiled and said. Yes can't wait.
I smiled. "Yes. Are you good enough to walk or should I carry you?" I asked.
"We're not shagging!" I yelled.
He shook his head and said,"No, but Dumbledore would like for me to go every day and help him."
Draco p.o.v
"I can put it out of its misery for you." Draco said his eyes turning red and showing his fangs.
When me and Mason got home we set all the wizarding things we got and I went to make lunch.
We then both fell into a peaceful sleep.
When we got there we waited a couple minutes and Draco did not show up. When it was time to jump in, I took one last look around, ate the Gilly weed and jumped in.
"I guess we can go. Come, Harry to the big oaf's we go." I said earning a light tap on my shoulder from Hermione.
"You... You don't see the horse? Pulling the carrige..." I said as it began to walk.
"How do we get Neville down?" I asked.
"Yeah. She was smart." I said. I then saw a piece of paper in her hand. I took it and unfolded it. "Guys look." I said and showed them the paper, "I bet this is the monster."
"I always am. It's just I got to show it." I said as we sat down.
I nodded and got up. I did what I've always done and a stag appeared.
"Thank you Harry." He said and kissed me.
Draco led the way and when we got there he bought me almost anything I looked at for longer than a minute. And a few things for himself.
"That is unless Harry wants me to." Draco said. He then started nibbling on my neck and Ron walked out quickly.
He climed into bed and cuddled me. "Good night my Harry." He said
"I will have to ask. Are you sure? He is Sirius Black. I am not sure my parents will like that." I said, scared of meeting his God father slash murderer.
Ron then took my hand and we went to the great Hall. Running into nun other than Draco Malfoy. "Hello Harry... Weasly."
"Some people find it kinky." Ron said and laughed.
Ginny nodded and left. "Hey Draco what do you say about a double date. You two and me and ron?" Blaise  asked.
I shook my head and said, "not until he is completely married and says I do is it over." I said and stormed out of the place.
"Yes. Though I bet Hermione will take over." Harry said.
I think Harry will like them. They are beautiful just like him.
"You just did." I said Jokingly.
Remus went to his seat as Ron and Blaise came in.
"So I think that after classes we should go to the library." Hermione said and Pansy agreed with her.
"So how do we get out?" Ginny asked.
After we apeareated I almost fell but thanks to Draco I stayed up we went around buying our things and then went to get ice cream.
"Whatever," Ron said. He held out his arm and said, "would you like for me to escort you to the hall, my dear friend."
"I heard that Skeeter is a horrible cheat." A first year said. I rolled my eyes. "I heard that she twists stories." another said. "I haven't heard of her." Harry said. "Maybe when we get back to my dorm you could read a newspaper article of hers." I said. He nodded and continued to eat.
Ginny huffed and walked away. Harry cuddled into me, burying his face into the crook of my neck.
Ron went first opening all his presents and was happy with what he got. Especially the owl.  It was Draco's turn next. I laughed when I saw that Hermione got him a werewolf book and the whole twilight book series. He also got dog toys from the twins, Ron and Sirius. Though he seemed fine with it. Next it was Hermione. All she got was books, but was ecstatic.
As I ran through the halls people are looking at me strangely. I just ignored them, only worried about my Harry. But where the scent leads, he is not there. There is a familiar sent over lapping his but they apparently teleported since it leads no were.
"I don't know." He said frowning.
So I looked at our friends. Harry is eating silently beside me. Ron and Blaise are talking to each other. Pansy and Hermione are talking about boys.
We walked in and Hagrid is crying a bit. "You should not be here." He said.
"Wow! Are your friend wizards to?" He asked and poked the lamp.
"True though," Pansy said shrugging.
I could not help but to laugh. "I'm sorry Harry. But you asked me to go harder."
I smiled and Ginny said, "well guess what."
"I love Harry." Draco said.
So now here I am feeling as happy as ever. Though I could fell the dark thoughts lingering in the back of my mind.
He set the fork down and said, "What do you mean and how?"
At dinner both mine and my mother's owl came in and we got letters. Harry smiled as he looked at the letter and a still photo. He showed me and said, "can we keep them Draco?" And I saw his rabbit with a bunch of baby rabits.
"Hey Harry. You alright?" Mom asked, not getting to close because Draco is glaring at us and his eyes are yellow.
"I said leave me alone!" He yelled.
"Correct. It's time to leave." Malfoy senior said. Malfoy looked like he was about to protest but followed anyways, taking one last look.
We then walked into the great hall. "Morning Harry and Draco." Hermione said.
"I'm sure he is fine. Just has a few screws loose." Hermione said.
"Don't worry I'm sure he will be fine," Dumbledore said.
Draco p.o.v
Draco p.o.v
"Good sir. You?" I said.
"Yes. Now get off of me." I said.
"Okay get ready my love." He said and went into the bathroom.
"Yes I did. What time is it?" I asked.
The rest of the day we stayed in his room. We only went out for dinner and then we fell  asleep.
They shook there head and let us be.
Blaise smiled at him and said, "yah I'm fine. What happned though?"
Then Dad walked in. "Draco there are two boxes at the door from hogsmead. They have your name on it." Dad said.
"Sounds like a you problem." I said.
"Only when wearing dresses and skirts. But other than that it's the same." I said shrugging.
Harry sighed and looked at the heels. Then he took out his wand and transfigure them into flat shoes. He put those on and we went to our next class.
Hermione dropped her book, while the other three gave us a look of shock. "You've got to be joking." Hermione said.
We finished shopping and got ice cream and went back to the Leaky Cauldron.
When school finally got over we said goodbye to Remus and Hagrid and got on the train.
After we continued to make plans. "We have one and one was destroyed. So now what. How do we even destroy one?" Ron said thoughtfully.
Harry's P.O.V.*
Ron and I went to buy stuff together while Draco and Hermione went some where else. "So Harry, what should I get Draco? I was thinking a dog toy." Ron said.
"I am sure that he will like to know that Draco and Harry are now together. Draco could tell him everything." She said in her know-it-all voice.
"I'm going to go to the loo I'll be back." She said.
"Yes, I will." I kissed him quickly and went over to Hagrid's hut.
"Yes come on!" I said, excited going over to the toys.
"Harry!" Hermione and I yelled as Harry got hit by a branch and fell. Hermione and I went over but we got hit too. We all crawled away.
"Do we have to," Harry whined and leaned against me.
"I actually got permission from the ministry this time." She said, showing me a piece of paper.
When we got to the field, Madam Hooch said her normal stuff, then we were off. I looked for the snitch, flying around the pitch. Draco is staring at me, not paying attention.
"Does that mean he needs to go to school?" Dobby asked and I nodded.
"Well if you say he is good Harry I am sure he is." Hermione said.
"I feel fine, but my butt hurts like hell." Harry said, burying his face in my neck.
"Ginny. I am sorry but you are like a sister to me. Please just leave me alone. Plus I don't like girls that way and I have liked him for awhile! And he's my mate!" I said, kinda fed up with her attitude.
They all looked at me and Hermione said, "no there is not Harry. They move on there on just like always."
"Yes." He replied.
"Then why is Dumbledore practically ignoring me? Is he ashamed of me? Is it because i me Cedric die?" He asked.
So I walked out of the room and into the living room part of the ROR. I sat on the couch as Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Pansy came in. "How is harry?" Hermione asked.
"It is a love potion. It smells different for each person because it smells like things they really like or are attracted to. It does not work if someone has a mate, like a werewolf or veela." She said.
Our freinds rolled there eyes and we continued to eat.
I stared in horror at the horse, and Hermione said, "What are you looking at?"
Me and harry went back to the camp hand in hand. When we got there pansy and Hermione turned to us. "Did you two go and have sex in the woods?" Hermione asked.
"N-no, sir. I don't know how this happened," I said getting a little nervous.
"Harry are you sure your okay?" Draco asked me.
"Yes, but I got used to it. They are nice to talk to." I said.
Draco looked up at me and said quietly, "would you like to hold one of them?" I nodded and Narcissa handed me the one She was holding.
"I'm fine. Just. You two. It's obvious. Why." And she hit her head on the table one more time and kept her head there slowly shaking it.
"I know right." Hermione said.
Harry p.o.v
"Draco said that Harry did not want to bother anyone with it. So Draco just asked his parents if Harry could live with them." Hermione answered.
I blushed as he kissed me, then got up. I done the same, and got dressed in some gender neutral clothes.
"Bu-"
Draco looked at the rabbit and said, "no."
"Well whatever is going to happen I'm sure we will get through it as always." Harry said, smiling.
"Draco we could finish later. We should speak to him." Harry said and pouted.
"How did you know I am here?" Draco asked.
"We heard you talking in snake language," I pointed out.
Draco smirked and said, "believe me I will." We then got on the train. Me blushing like a tomato.
Cornelius Fudge walked in and started talking to Hagrid. Then my father did too. Then Dumbledore. They took Hagrid away but not before he said, "if any one is looking for any answers just.. follow the spiders. And feed Fang." Then Hagrid left.
But instead me, Harry, Blaise, Ron, Hermione, and Pansy turned and walked out.
I looked up at Snape to see amusement in his eyes before the sides of his mouth slightly lifted at seeing us. "Whoa is Snape grinning? I never knew he could do that." Harry snorted ,pulling me down to sit next to him.
"Draco is my alpha. I listen to him." Harry said, smiling.
Snape came in and tried to attack so I knocked him out. I ignored Ron Hermione and Draco yelling at me and said, "if you don't start explaining you will be worse off then him." And I'm quite sure Draco said I'm hot.
"Um sure." I said. " I am Harry Potter, heir of slytherin and mate of Draco." I said in parseltongue.
"We need to get rid of Wormtail. Probably make sure that he does not take Voldemort from Saint Mungo's." Harry answered.
"Wicked!" They said at the same time. People started crowding around us and Draco started to stalk forward. Almost as if he was hunting Fred and George. "Alright enough acting!" They said in sync.
"Well we did not really break any rules, though we did get in trouble." Hermione said, sounding disappointed.
"What the bloody hell are you doing here?!" Ron asked.
Draco p.o.v
When we walked out we met up with the others.
Yeah. Well harry I think is more gay then Ron. That's why he is the girl." I said.
Harry nodded and said, "yah. Um. Can we go now?"
He drank it down, but obviously did not like it. She then gave him a pain potion, then came over to me.
When I finished, I felt much better and went over to Harry. "Thank you, Harry," I said and smiled.
We then walked out and went to the clothing store. I can't wait! The wedding will be perfect.
Draco and Blaise went to the Slytherin's table and me and my friends to the Gryffindor's. We watched people get sorted and I noticed that the DADA teacher is not here yet.
"This is insane." Draco said.
"Yes. I should get a letter back soon." I replied. "I also ran into Umbitch." I added.
"Yeah. Let's go give this to Ginny." I said.
"Because I said so. Now turn to page three hundred and ninety four!" Snape yelled.
"I already ate thanks." He said.
Pansy and Hermione came over. "Draco what did you do?" Hermione said.
I waved them off and continued to kiss him. I put my tongue in his mouth. He moaned and I started kissing his neck.
When we got into the great hall Draco sat with me like normal along with his friends.
We went into a book store and the assistant looked at us. "Pleas don't tell me all of you need the Monster Book of Monsters," he said warily and I noticed his hands are badly bitten.
Ron and Hermione came over and Ron said, "So this is where you two were."
I hugged him. "No reason. You smell so good." I said. I then smelled his neck and he shivered.
I looked up at him and said, "I get that a lot. Um. I will think about your offer. See you tomorrow professor."
"Okay. Maybe tomorrow during our free time." Draco said, looking at it.
I sighed and said,  "But... how? We don't have anything to destroy it with. "
I ran quickly to the owlery and called my owl. I tied the letter and told him that I'll give him some treat. Then Headwig came over and said, "long time no speak Draco. How are you?"
The next day we are at breakfast and Ron said, "I so badly want to ask Fleur. But how?"
"Professor Quirrell had Voldemort on the back of his head," Harry answered like that's normal.
"But. I must have been really bothersome." I said feeling tears fall onto my cheeks. I looked at my hands and noticed that my wrist have scars.
"They are strange." I said and the Trio agreed.
"You have been spending way to much time with Draco." Ron said, then walked out.
"Just fine. I promise I slept." He said, smiling.
"Stay here and cuddle." I said.
He went back to kissing me as he grinded his hips into mine. After a few moments he stopped kissing me and sat up. He then lined himself up with my entrance and slowly pushed in.
"Shove off Malfoy." Ron said, and we began to walk away.
I then felt fear come from Harry and my promise ring heat up. "We will continue this later." I growled and ran to my common room.
I ran out after him, telling his friends to stay there. "Harry!" I yelled.
"I dreamt that you left me." He whispered.
"You are my mate. Why should we listen to her?" I said.
"How did you know that was there?" I asked.
"He is annoyed with you." I asnwered simply.
I tried getting away, but it's not working. "Harry look at me. Look at me Harry." I looked and saw Draco.
"Will it be noticeable?" He seemed to be conflicted so I tried to reassure him.
I leaned down and kissed him. I began going faster and harder. I also grabbed Harry's member and began stroking it, causing Harry to moan louder. I then came inside Harry as he did into my hand. I pulled out and laid next to him, Harry cuddling you me.
Draco licked my bottom lip, asking for entrance which I did not give. He then bit my lip, so I gave it to him.
"Why? He seems nice," I said.
When he pulled away to start sucking on my neck not breaking the skin I said. "Love you to draco."
"No its fine. Let's go." I said and we got up and changed. We then went down to the dining hall.
We all began cheering as Luna went up and kissed Neville cheek. The deatheaters fled as our side began celebrating. Snape stayed behind and ask Draco to forgive him.
"Alright." Ron said and went back to glaring.
"What was that noise?" He snapped.
Ginny came over and sat down, leaning against me. "I'm bored and I need something to do."
Draco p.o.v
Real Harry p.o.v
I sighed and done as asked. "Okay are we done here?" I said.
"Okay tell." I said eagerly.
"Here you go Harry. One sip." Draco said, handing me the potion.
I walked in and saw them reading.
Draco looked and shrugged. So in the end Hermione got the cat and we left.
"Everyone calls us that. Thought it would be funny." I said.
We got up and dressed and wondered if we should wake Ron and Blaise. We decided not to.
"I know hunny. We have told Dumbledore about your predicament and he will allow you to go to school. Snape will have to keep a close eye on you though" she said.
The trio showed up and Ron and Hermione gave me there presents Harry saying he wants to wait. I can tell he is in little space thing acting like he is not.
I got dressed in the male uniform and kissed Draco's cheek.
"If you want, Blaise is bi and you can ask him to date you. If he ask why the sudden change in gender tell him you want to try dating men. He will understand." I said
"Harry. let's go." I said and tried to grab his arm, but he backed away more, begging me not to touch him.
"That's not much of a plan." Blaise pointed out.
I growled at him making him pull back and I said, "I'll take Harry to the hospital wing. You all stay here," and I walked away keeping Harry close. Though Moody followed, not getting the hint.
"Are you going to be watching?" I asked.
"That is not important." James said.
I woke up and felt another warm body beside me. I sat up and saw Draco. He opened his eyes, got ontop of me, and began kissing me. He pulled away. "I was so worried Harry. I love you so much. I was looking for you. I love you." He said.
"Yea but, you don't need to worry about him. The Aurors will take care of him." I said and smiled.
"I want to stay here." I said getting impossibly closer with my head right under his chin.
"No." I said and began eating again.
I turned and looked at the water. Just as I was about to jump in Harry shot out of the water and landed at my feet.
"He wants me to because he found out about my aunt and uncle." I said.
I tried reaching out with my other hand, but I slipped and fell right in front of the rings, catching the snitch. The bludger tried crushing me so I rolled to the left, then the right, then spread my legs so it won't break them too.
Draco then came back minutes later with a doctor and nurse. And they quickly went to work.
"Your friends are strange." Draco said to me.
"Harry please explain to me what is going on!" I said.
"Your crying." He said.
"Thanks," I replied.
"Alright. I hope your better than these two." Ron said, pointing at me and Hermione.
We both laughed Harry nodding. Then Blaise, Pansy, Ron, and Hermione joined us.
"Mum's going to kill me," Ron whimpered.
I saw Harry run upstairs. I got up and ran after him. He closed our bedroom door and locked it.
I shook my head and said, "Maybe one more?"
"See ya." I kissed his forehead and went to my dorm.
The rest of the week Hagrid came back. And everyone forgot about me being Slytherin's heir and focused on me Draco and Ron saving Ginny. The ones attacked woke up and Hermione was better than ever. She even hugged Draco.
"Hey Draco. Hey Harry. How was your night?" Hermione said.
"Did you have a good day Harry?" I asked. Harry nodded frowning a bit. "What's wrong Harry?"
I glared at Ron and remembered the potion that Snape said could take away Harry's depression.
"Your welcome." We both said.
Harry p.o.v
I went to change then we went down stairs to get our presents.
"Great, we'll have another bed moved in for you during lunch."
"I have no clue," I replied as the post came. Hedwig came over and gave me a letter. She nipped my finger and flew over to Malfoy, who gave her a piece of bread.
"So how is professer Snape going to teach you?" Hermione asked.
"I'm a wizard. You know I can do magic." I said taking out my wand.
"He tastes delicious." I said and licked his neck.
"Okay, I'll show Harry around," I said and took Harry's hand. After showing him around it is lunch time so I took him to the dining room.
He smiled and blushed. He hugged me and said yes of course. And the day went on as usual.
"Tomorrow we should start looking up stuff on werewolves. Especially the type that Draco is because werewolves are normally not able to change at will." Hermione said.
"Not sure. Though I'm sure it will be fine. I'm sure that Snape won't hurt me since I'm dating Draco." I said, smiling.
"I promise." I said.
I was shocked. And decided to ask the important question. Can you tell me about the chamber of secrets?
Pansy and Blaise came over. "It is. You will sneak down here at night or Draco will sneak out if you have a nightmare." Pansy said.
"These are all about him," Ron said in disbelief.
"Yes. Harry is coming with this time." Draco said, smirking.
Draco seemed to think of something.
"So what did you think Harry?" I asked Harry, putting an arm around his shoulders.
"Aww, your so cute!" Draco said, hugging me to him. When he lets go of me, we continued eating and our friends grin at us.
"Harry Potter. I have absolutely no idea what to do." I rushed out, unable to control the sudden feeling of panic sink in, showing also through my voice and undoubtably my facial expression.
"Well, then I guess now it's not only the school that knows," Ron said.
The next day me, Ron, and Draco went to visit Hermione.
"Well you can but will you?" Dumbledore said.
"We are going to go get some air. We will be back." Harry said and we went outside.
"Morning Draco." I said getting up.
And this is one of those night. I am in bed tossing and turning not able to sleep. I turned over on my side again and saw Draco standing over me. "Can't sleep?" He asked.
"But Ron. It will be bad on both of us if I don't accept...the reason why I am waiting is because I think that he has really changed. Don't you think he would have forced me if he hasn't?" I said.
"Did he kiss ya or somthing?" He asked jokingly.
"Draco that hurts," I whined.
Harry p.o.v
"Harry what happened?" Hermione asked.
"You're welcome," I said and we just laid there, Draco on top of me holding me to him nuzzling his face to my neck.
"Hey its alright. I should be more upset. I had no faith in you." He said.
"Dray I mean real food. Please let me go." I said moving.
Draco walked up to it and wrang it's neck. "You will serve all of us! And you will give us what we ask for! Or you will serve as painfull death!!!"
"But draaacooo, please!!!" I said, pouting up at him.
Ron turned to us red cheeked and stiff.
"I'm a vampire that's what I do," Draco growled at him.
The rest of the day I and Harry stayed in our room and talked. The bed was even put in there. At night we both fell asleep in our own beds.
"Um. Sure." I said getting a little uncomfortable.
"Why what's wrong?" I asked rubbing his back.
"Good job Harry." Draco said and resumed eating.
"I'm joking Ron. Don't get your panties in a twist." I said.

That night me and Harry fell asleep cuddling. This time not getting eather of us aroused. Just cuddling.
"Well we may not have had sex but we have been close. So out of that, I can tell." I said Harry blushing more and me smiling even more.
We walked out of the room, a little disappointed that we could not finish and went to McGonagall's office. "We are sorry that we had to interrupt you, but it sounded pretty urgent. So suck it up and deal with it." Pansy said.
"Yes. Just feeling hot." He said.
"I should be allowed to once in a while. Plus I think that it is fair." I said and got off him and helped him up.
"Draco is right. You do nearly get killed and you do get hurt every time you play. Anyways we win!" Ron said.
He then pulled them out and thrust his penis inside of me. I moaned loudly as he paused for a minute allowing me to get used to it. So now i am just laying here gasping. I heard some more moans from Ron's bed and a few curses. Draco laughed leaned down and kissed real quick and began thrusting in and out. I moaned loudly and was about to tuch myself buy Draco grabbed my hands and pinned me down. "No no harry." He said and bit into my neck making me gasp and moan loudly.
"Okay hunny. Be back by dinner." Mum said. I nodded and flooed away.
I began sucking harder, making him moan loudly. He then pulled my head away and made me stand up. He took off my pants and pulled me over to a bed room pushing me onto the bed on my hands and knees. He licked my butt which felt a little weird. He then rolled me onto my back and made me suck on his fingers. When he pulled those away he began pushing his fingers up my butt. I began moaning as he found a pleasurable spot. Draco then pushed his member in. I moaned loudly as he began thrusting in and out, hitting the pleasure spot. He was going to slow. I moaned and wiggled under him, wanting, no needing him to go faster and harder. Though all I can get out of my mouth is non comprehendible moans. So now I am going to try and form words, "Dr-Draco! Oh please! Ah Draco! Please g-oh-go faster! Draco!" I moaned.
