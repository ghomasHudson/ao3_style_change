Instead of doing the "sorry I haven't updated" I'll just give an extra long chapter, shall I? If you're actually interested, post a comment and I'll explain.
“We wanted you to come, but Dumbledore said that you were safer there!” Harry choked, then threw his hands up as he started laughing. It was deep and devoid of humor.
“Kiss me,” Draco demanded again, barely pulling back before he was back. Harry still didn’t move his lips. Draco pulled him closer, “
“I will never leave you. Not even death can separate us. I love you too much.” Harry sniffled, and Draco started rocking them.
“Your cute little pet name: baby. Not a baby: baby, Baby.” Harry put on his most winning smile as Draco’s eyes became large.
Harry woke up very late the next day, so late in fact that it was no longer morning. He swore when he saw the clock, falling back on the bed again. “Well, good morning to you, too.” Draco chuckled, giving him a kiss on the cheek.
Draco hummed deep in his throat, it pulled deep within Harry, who moaned in response and pulled Draco closer.
Finally, Draco was stretched enough to accommodate the dildo. Harry cast a quick cleaning spell on Draco’s opened passage and reached for the dildo. Harry lubed it and placed it against Draco’s hole. “Are you ready, Baby?” He asked, as Draco had done.
Harry felt a burst of happiness through the Bond, and it made his heart melt. Draco was thanking him for being happy.
“Does this mean you don’t want my number?” The hostess asked as they passed her. She recoiled from Draco’s glare.
He very slowly turned around, and Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s perfect arse. Draco had taken a fancy to jeans, liking how he looked in them, and Harry was definitely a fan.
“I will never doubt you again.” Harry said lowly. “Is it just me, or did they both want both of us?”
“Kreacher knew Masters don’t want anyone knowing about Master Draco,” Kreacher croaked. “Kreacher protected Masters. Kreacher protected family secrets. And Kreacher thought hospital would be unsafe for bloodtraitor.”
“Ah, here it is!” She said as if it had been a challenge for her. “Right this way, if you’ll follow me,” she looked at both of them in turn over her shoulder, swaying her hips more than was absolutely necessary.
“Why are you feeling embarrassed?” Draco asked. “Harry, you can tell me anything, anything in the world.” Harry snorted; he should have known Draco would be able to decipher the emotions swirling around inside him better than he could himself.
“Are you calling me a liar?” Harry was angry now. He didn’t want to compete, and he shouldn’t have to prove it to some cheese-eating surrender monkey.
“Yeah, mate,” Ron said, scratching the back of his head. “You’re still our friend. That’s not about to change just for Malfoy.”
They hugged for a long time, Harry soaking up the comfort like a sponge. When he pulled back, he was still feeling a little raw, but definitely much better. It was so incredible having someone to be there for him. He knew he’d never take it for granted.
How did 1/3 of the year take 2/3 of the chapters to convey and 2/3 of the year stretched out over 1/3 chapters? I guess they (I) had a lot of internalized feelings to sort though. I think showing the struggle strengthens the story, however.
Harry smiled, or tried to, and said, “you too, Sirius. They’re probably not going to be too happy with you. Actually,” he realized. “Sirius, I’m Voldemort’s number one target, and you’re my godfather. There’s no way they’re not coming after you. I don’t want you to go.” He felt some anxiety grip him.
It was the Slytherin vs. Gryffindor match, and the Slytherins were playing dirty. They had just won the match, despite Harry being thrown from his broom by a rogue bludger when Draco landed pretty close to Harry. They had decided on having a fight the last time they saw each other.
“A long time. I had a crush on boys and girls at my grade school, so it wasn’t that hard to figure out once I realized there was a reason for it.”
Other times, when Dumbledore wasn’t there, it resembled more of a party. Occasionally they would all sit together in the circle of chairs and talk about their week, or their fears. Sometimes Mandy would have a prompt, other times they just talked about whatever they wanted.  Every now and then it would break off and they would all have separate conversations about anything in small groups, socializing. Harry preferred the big group, so it wasn’t unusual if he stared at Draco, should he talk.
Draco’s first year…mostly sucked. He felt like he put on a mask, what was expected of him, and lived up to it. It was wonderful being away from home, making new friends, exerting his authority as a Malfoy.
Of course, the Slytherin Prince was ready for being taken prisoner in his own home. Harry shook his head fondly.
“Er, I like the dungeons. For going on a walk. There’re so many places to go, you know? Just wanted some quiet before I go up to Gryffindor.” Cedric nodded, not looking convinced, but Harry didn’t blame him, that was a mediocre excuse. They came to a fork in the halls and each chose one.
It was a lot quieter without Fred and George. It was just the seven of them, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bill and Fleur, Ron, Ginny, and Harry, and it was still louder than dinner at Sirius’s house, but he found himself missing Draco. The Burrow still had all the charms it had when Harry had first seen it, Harry had just gotten used to something different.
Harry stood there for a minute with his hand over his cheek before he was able to move again. In a slight daze, he made his way to the bookstore. Surely, that had to mean Draco had feelings for him. People didn’t just kiss their friends goodbye, did they? He went over every goodbye he could remember witnessing. Families did sometimes, and girls did on occasion, but Harry couldn’t remember ever seeing a boy kissing another goodbye. That had to mean something.
He was special to Harry. He knew that, looking at him. But how special? And would something that might only last a short time be worth it?
And they're married! Maybe not in the eyes of the Ministry, but in the eyes of magic itself. A much higher authority if you ask me.
“How was your homework this week?” Harry raised an eyebrow. They did talk about homework on occasion, but this was the first week back, Draco usually wanted to gossip about people’s summers. Yet another odd thing.
Someone gave him a shove, and Harry was standing. Another shove, and he was moving forward. He was really stunned, and he had no idea what to do. He felt numb.
There was the sound of rustling, and then Ron snoring. Harry fell asleep quicker than he had all summer.
“Congratulations, Sirius!” Harry got up, rushing to give Sirius a hug. “I’m so happy for you.” Sirius chuckled.
“A few bits here and there. Apparently, Gwenog Jones is retiring as coach at the end of the season, and there’s going to be a shake-up of the team. According to Lucasta, Harris may be benched, and Larkin may become first Beater.”
“Anyway, I’m going to head back and finish my homework, then I’ll get the Christmas decorations down. We can probably get everything up before dinner.”
“He’s an amazing chef!” Said Draco eagerly as he waved his empty fork around. “He once made a roast duck with a pomegranate glaze, and it was superb!” Draco smiled, eyes hazy as if remembering. “And what this man can do with chocolate-”
“It wasn’t publicised much, to be honest. Malfoy left not long after that,” Ron replied after he took a sip of his mead.
“Even here we are familiar with the legend of Harry Potter and well-” he paused looking at him and Harry found himself blushing.
“About a week ago, before I left Romania. He was perfectly unharmed when we parted.” Draco bit his lip and rested his face on his knee’s” He tried not to think of Charlie Weasley. He didn’t need any more complications right now.
“You don’t have to give me an answer now, of course. Just drop us a fire call before you come over, or send an owl if you’re unable to make it. We’ll leave a space set at the dinner table for you, in any case.”
“It was pleasant enough. Did you and Granger enjoy yourselves?” He countered and watched as the redhead grasped for words.
It was a completely absurd and ridiculous notion after everything they had been through. Their differences and history seemed insurmountable. He would understand if Malfoy could never think of him in that way, after what he’d done to him with that stupid curse. He sighed heavily as he pulled his thoughts away from that dark place.
“Got a headache”, Harry mumbled, not ready to have that particular talk with his now ex-brother-in-law.
She smiled but shook her head in despair as she went to wave her wand. The plate suddenly levitated towards Ron, who grinned. Molly tutted but smirked as she walked back to the other end of the table.
Draco shook his head. “No, I’m a trained Occlumens; However, one of my colleagues was stupefied by the cat’s gaze for a few hours after our interaction.”
“Luna has told me much about you and your initiative and ingenuity. She also regaled me with your adventures, and I am struggling to think of anyone better suited. Your work in Romania has been highly commended by the supervisors there. I even have several personal commendations from some of your co-workers from the reserve. Misters Torren MacFusty and Charlie Weasley and also Ms Mihaela Dalca all speak very highly of you.”
“I tire of these games Mr Potter. We did not bring you here for information. You’re the entertainment.”
“Absolutely not. I find that, in the field, it’s easier to use magic; however, the effect is never the same nor as accurate. Also, I’ve had some instances where the magic can disturb the creature. The muggle way is a better way,”
“Of course I was,” Blaise smirked as he wiped at his mouth, throwing his napkin down on the plate with a satisfied sigh. “About what in particular, though? I do like to keep score.”
“It was organised with Patrik last week.” He smirked as he popped the cork on the wine. He began pouring out their glasses before holding one out to Draco.
“It took me a long time to realise that some people could do that; Help people without expecting a reward. I never understood that people were capable of such compassion.” Malfoy looked at him with such intensity that Harry wanted to look away. There was such a rawness in the gaze that he felt transfixed. “I don’t think you realise how rare that sort of kindness has been in my life” Malfoy looked at him again. There was something in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite put into words, a vulnerable but determined look. It was a look he didn’t think he had ever imagined seeing on his face. The blond opened his mouth as if to say more but decided against it and closed it again.
“I am nothing, if not persistent.” He joked before standing to kiss her. “So, Harry, Are you ready to help me?”
“Oh, that?” Harry dismissed with a wave of his hand. The surprised look on Malfoy’s face confused him. Surely he couldn’t be thanking him for something that happened so long ago. It was a lifetime ago; Harry had nieces and nephews now, younger than that.
Peppin hadn’t returned yet, and Harry was struggling to stay up any longer. His mind darted between Malfoy’s letter and Ginny. He could see it now, Ginny and Orion, enjoying their time together, in each other’s arms. He didn’t begrudge her, but he felt envious.
“What-?” He started, squeezing the words around the heart in his throat. It occurred to him, belatedly, that he should reach for his wand.
They all watched as the punch bowl floated up and slowly tipped over onto the lover’s unsuspecting heads.
When Draco had heard the words uttered: “Potter is looking at you.” His heart nearly jumped out of his chest. He felt his hands start to sweat as he looked up. Their eyes met across the crowded, great hall, and Draco felt the longing in his heart that he’d carried since long before they met at school. He pushed and smothered the feeling as he tried to regain his composure. Had Harry looked longingly at him? Or had it been wary or confused? It was difficult to read after so many years, and the idea that Harry could be gay too was beyond laughable. Draco couldn’t have been that lucky.
“What makes you think I never did?” He quirked an eyebrow as the corner of his lip twitched perceptibly. “Goodnight, Harry Potter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a fortuitous new year.“
He fought to keep his thoughts at bay as he waited for the comforting warmth of a fire and the safety of somewhere to break down and crash. He focused on inconsequential thoughts like how the weeds, despite the incantations in place, still managed to grow through the gravel, causing the once neat and regulated driveway to become unkempt and shabby. Ivy had woven around the stone pillar and gates, giving the once-grand entrance to the house a neglected and abandoned aura. He slashed his wand abruptly, causing the gate to disappear momentarily, only to reappear again once he was on the other side. He tried to ignore the tingling in his fingers, of the dizzying haze at the edges of his vision.
He looked up into his godson’s face and realised that it had been a challenging and needlessly lonely year. The reality of everything dawned on him, dragging his mood down.
“I just told the truth about your actions, and it was so long ago,” Harry felt sick with nerves as Malfoy laughed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He shivered at the sound.
He threw down his quill and pushed himself up from the desk. He needed a break from the tension and possibly a cup of coffee. He turned from the offending parchment and left the room, ignoring the gaps in the bookcase and the missing ornaments on the mantelpiece.
“Where did you have in mind?” Draco asked, rising out of his bed, gripping his blanket to his waist for modesty’s sake.
He offered his hand into the space between them, causing Malfoy to look down. His face seemed to pale further as he stared at the offered hand. Harry realised the significance of the gesture as he held it firmly out to the blond.
He felt a swell of sadness when he realised that the manor would be devoid of all the fanfare this year, and he couldn’t bear to enter most of the rooms, let alone decorate them. There would be no tree this year nor presents. He might be able to convince Binky to make something festive, but he would get no joy from eating it alone.
Movement from the doorway distracted them both. Weasley leant against the doorframe and nodded in encouragement. Draco gave him the once over and was surprised at the confidence which he exuded, so at odds with his younger self.
“I took muggle lessons a few years ago, and it became a bit of a hobby,” He smiled at Draco then, “Which, apparently, is quite surprising because my potions leave a lot to be desired.”
“Volunteered for what?” He asked suspiciously. She giggled at that, like high pitched chiming bells.
Draco nodded as he lit his wand and watched as Patrik disappeared back to the houses. He watched as the light of the other wizard’s wand disappeared before turning around. Taking a deep breath he began to walk, his eyes darting everywhere and listening out to the night for signs of dragons. As he approached the cluster of trees, he saw lanterns dancing and swaying through the bracken. He wandered closer until he was at the foot of the jetty. Towards the end, only just visible was what looked like a picnic set out with cushions and blankets. Draco stepped tentatively closer, confusion thrumming around his head.
Between grading, classes, exams and sleep, there seemed to be very little time for anything else. So in return for covering for Harry, Neville got the week off, and Harry was on hallway duty. He did have one advantage, though, and that was the Marauders map. So he could stay within his office and glance at the map between grading his papers, something which was very fortunate indeed.
“Sign.” He demanded abruptly, throwing a clipboard in his direction rudely. Draco nodded and picked up the abandoned quill and scrawled his name. Then, before he’d finished the final cursive swirl, the mediwizard snatched back the clipboard and threw a paper bag at him. Draco caught it, hearing the glass vials inside clink.
Harry looked down at his drink and sighed again. He wished he could be angry with her, but he couldn’t find it in him. Even catching them in the middle of their passionate infidelity had proved it. He had seen them, naked and hungry for each other, as her body pressed against his. He had lingered as long as it had taken his brain to comprehend before he had turned tail and retreated to the kitchen. He had waited, not as long as he had expected, for Ginny to emerge. Orion had left shortly after, sheepishly apologising before disappearing into the night.
“He probably brought it upon himself, like-as-not,” Molly muttered as she busied herself with the dessert.
They were all sat in the kitchen again, around the pine table, talking as Harry entered. He placed his bag down as they turned to him. He smiled at them all before his eyes went to Draco’s. He watched as Draco’s dove-grey eyes did their usual cycle, lingering over the slim peek of flesh where his t-shirt rode up as he continued to rub his hair. He watched as Draco’s fine, pink tongue whipped out to wet his lips before disappearing again. Harry smirked as Draco’s eyes found his again. The pale berry blush had already appeared along his cheeks before he turned his head with a smirk at being caught.
“Nothing like that.” Ron dismissed with a wave of his hand. “She would react the same if it were Ginny. It’s just Malfoy. She doesn’t like or trust him.”
“Hello, We’re here to collect the prescription for Draco Malfoy, please,” Blaise announced confidently with a smile. The wizards stern look seemed to turn into a glare as he looked at his paperwork briskly.
“Thanks,” Ted replied with a smirk. “I know you’re just getting me to shut up, but you are right. There is just too much homework to do before we go back. Are we still eating at the Burrow tonight?”
“You need to let the family know cause when it does hit the headlines, people will be annoyed that you didn’t warn them,” Harry could hear the word ‘Again’ hang in the air.
Shit! He thought again as he tried to gather his thoughts. What had they been talking about before he’d spotted the blond? Harry opened his mouth to speak when he noticed that Malfoy was moving -towards them. He felt hyperaware of his every movement. He couldn’t deal with this right now. He would not make a fool of himself in front of Draco Malfoy.
There was a blast of activity as his left arm was grasped by someone, halting his movement. The taut pull at the cool band at his wrist returned, and all calmed around him. The adrenaline still bubbled within his gut as panic threatened to take hold.
“It’s all he ever talks about; I swear,” She complained, a smirk pulling at the corner of her lips. Harry knew that as much as she might protest, she wouldn’t have her life any other way. Silence fell between them for a moment as he pondered whether to let slip about his feelings or apparent ‘lack of’ on the matter. “Are you alright?” Hermione asked before he could speak. “You could have spoken to us at any point, you know? We love you both.” Harry nodded, avoiding Hermione’s gaze. He took a deep breath before he felt his words pour out in what would be the closest to a confession, he could bear
He considered some of the other Malfoy properties dotted around the country but kept rejecting the idea. He was back in the land where people knew him as the arrogant, insular Malfoy heir who couldn’t look after himself. Draco wasn’t that child anymore. He had grown up, grown wiser? Maybe. Time would tell. He firmly believed that using his parent’s wealth would be a bad idea, not with the wizarding community watching; Waiting with bated breath for him to fail or slip up, proving them all right that he deserved to be locked up in-. He gulped the word back. Even in his mind, he struggled to say the word. Saying it once tonight was enough, and only his force of will to apologise to Harry had forced that out without stammering like an imbecile.
He couldn’t do it! Two weeks were two weeks too long. Two weeks of waking up covered in tiny strips of metallic plastic. Two weeks of fighting off a glitter-induced migraine. It had only been 2 minutes.
Harry nodded, avoiding the blond’s gaze as the silence stretched between them again. Only the whistling of the wind through one of the upper battlements audible between them. It occurred to him that he couldn’t hear the music from within either.
“I hear you two got married. Congratulations.” He offered weakly. Small talk had never been a strength.
“Right by Gringotts. They do the best spicy baked eggs, and their antipasti platters are to die for.”
“This week, not all that much. Truth be told. Being so close to Christmas, the office shuts down. However, when the new year starts is when the real work begins. The role we’ve asked you to aid us with is a rather hush-hush affair.” He waved his wand, causing the door to close behind him. Draco turned and watched as several shadows crept away from the office. It looked like the rest of the staff also wanted to hear about the Wampus Cat or, more probably, the secret role.
“Because, people don’t usually go around hexing the ‘boy-who-lived-twice.’ Regardless of whether he’s up to date on his child support payments,” George added, collapsing into the seat next to Harry with a teasing grin.
“We started out from a town called Cherokee in North Carolina and hiked through The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, ending at a place called Chimney tops. We didn’t see anything for the first few days. The hike would normally only take approximately ten hours. Still, we set up camp in several places along the way as we looked for evidence. It wasn’t until we got within a few miles of the Tennessee border that we started to see signs of them. The group leader believed a young female with a large litter was in the area due to droppings found and scratch marks in nearby trees. We following the trail they laid, but the female and her cubs remained allusive. We were there for about three months with almost no sign of the cats.” He paused, watching Rolf listen intently to his story, revelling in the innocent attention. “It wasn’t until I was trekking back to Cherokee with a few others that we stumbled upon a young male drinking at a stream. I managed to capture the image and draw it if you would care to see?”
After a few hours, he looked at his work. He’d realised about halfway through that he was drawing Harry again, but he pressed on. This image had turned out to be one of his best. It was a memory from their conversation at Hogwarts. Harry was laughing, his grin luminous and infectious even from the page where his pencils had toned and blended, giving this face definition and texture. Somehow he had even managed to pick up the slight darkening around his chin where his stubble had started the grow through.
“He told me a little about this “Order of the Phoenix? Know anything about that?” He gave Harry a knowing look and Harry grinned sheepishly. Draco shook his head. “Said he has a spy deep within Voldemort’s inner circle but didn’t want to tell me who it was.”
“Well, I thought that you woke up because your father decided to dismiss your last order. That’s what Dumbledore said would happen. But if your father did that, why did he wait until days later to confess? He should have used you as a bargaining chip, traded awakening you for a reduced sentence. Instead, he waited and released you, then a couple days later, confessed? That doesn’t make any sense to me.”
Harry was the last one to go back to the task at hand, and it looked like he was looking around him every couple seconds. Draco was glad if it resulted in Harry being more careful. It did, in fact, as he spotted a branch that jutted out quickly, trying to grab at him. Harry skillfully dodged it, and the rest of the hedge attacked.
Harry stared. He felt the universe center itself, and he hadn’t even realized it was off-kilter. That one little word,
It was a couple minutes past when tea was served that Kreacher finally popped back into the kitchen. “Is he alright?” Harry asked, stopping.
Harry stared at him in amazement. “Everything’s ok? We can tell people we’re together?” Draco nodded, a small smile coming on his face. Harry shouted in his exuberance. He hugged Draco tightly, using his legs to keep himself afloat. He pulled back and looked at Draco’s face. “What’s the problem? You don’t look happy?”
Draco did everything he could think of to convince his parents that he should be allowed to see Harry Potter again. He had debated eloquently, he had threatened, he had bribed, just as he had seen his father do countless times. He had thrown a tantrum of epic proportions.
Harry sat frozen. He couldn’t move if he wanted to. There was a buzzing around his ears and he had no idea what it was.
“That doesn’t make him a good person.” Lavender input from next to Hermione. Ginny, who was next to her, nodded tightly, biting her lip. Harry was surprised she was there, she usually avoided Harry if she could help it.
“I don’t think he was as in as any of us thought.” Bill commented a little sadly from his position on the armchair in the corner. Fleur was sitting on the arm, rubbing his back in a comforting manner.
Inside was Draco, against the far wall, sobbing. He didn’t look up when Harry entered the bathroom, nor when he locked the door. He did when Harry came closer, shifting away and telling him to go away. Harry didn’t.
“Hi, Harry!” She said, beaming, and walked very close to him. He was surprised at her sunny demeanor after their last encounter.
This chapter really didn't have many changes to it, but if you're set on rereading, go for it. ~People can do what they want as long as they're not actually hurting other people or infringing on their rights. ~
Still gasping, he crept away, crawling through the bushes. He had promised Draco some months ago that if he felt unsafe, he would leave, and he definitely felt in danger right now.
As they said the final word, however, Harry definitely felt magic. He still didn’t look away from Draco, but he could tell there was magic all around them. It didn’t scare him; it felt warm and comfortable, like Draco’s love. He hadn’t read that there was supposed to be a reaction of this magnitude, but the book had warned that stronger ceremonies could sometimes ignite wild magic. He felt his heart clench and soar at the thought that their marriage bond was strong.
“I’m trying to figure out what was different about this time. What were you thinking about?” Harry swallowed, not answering. “Alright. Sweetheart, I know this might be… difficult for you to discuss, but I do have a suspicion about something. Was it… us, being so close that made you panicked?”
Again, just to make sure everyone knows, the main story will not be updated until I have the plot completely figured out. This will probably be around a month, give or take a couple weeks.
Ron winced, his face redder than Harry had ever seen it. “Fine,” Ron said with forced calmness. “It’s him, or me.”
“Do nothing. I actually got myself something in your name.” He slid an identically wrapped present over to Harry, who, feeling silly, slid it back. Draco made a show of being surprised.
Draco’s foot traced Harry’s calf under the table and he smiled at him. “We’re hardly a traditional couple, S
Sirius rolled his eyes. “I reiterate, the two of you were made for each other. Here, let’s put your chest under a petrification charm so you don’t hurt it anymore.” He waved his wand and Draco sat up a little straighter.
“Mrs. Weasley, please, listen to me, I don’t want a party.” He was going to go on, but Mrs. Weasley hit him in the arm with the rag he had handed her.
He hated being the center of attention, hated others knowing he was weak, hated having to talk about something that was deeply personal. The laughing was slightly hysterical. He was so out of the realm of reality it was the only thing he could do. His efforts only resulted in strange looks, but Sirius stopped pacing.
The one thing he knew he absolutely could not afford, but wanted more than anything else, was the brand-new broomstick, the Firebolt. He was practically drooling as he imagined flying on it.
“You kinky bastard.” Draco grinned. “I love it. I wanted to see it too.” They smiled at each other before linking hands, and he escorted him to his common room before returning to his own empty common room.
Harry sat in silence. He could have easily been killed and he wouldn’t have even had a chance to mentally say goodbye to anyone. He could have been killed in his sleep, never knowing that he had reached the end.
“Hmm.” Draco hummed. “To be honest, I had a crush on The-Boy-Who-Lived as a child, I think every kid our age had one at some point,” he added at Harry’s horrified look, “but we both know that that person and you are totally different. So, at some point they blended, and I developed a crush on you. You, Harry. My friend. No one has ever treated me like you do. You’re so special.”
He groaned. Everything hurt. He could feel every inch of his body, because it was all throbbing sore. He was laying down, half-asleep, and wanted to return to sleep, knowing it wouldn’t hurt anymore. Something was holding him back, however. He couldn’t remember the last thing that had happened to him. He had been at Hogwarts…It was February…The second task…The students, his friends…Draco. Where was Draco? Was he ok?
Pomfrey was shocked at first, so shocked in fact, that she dropped several bottles of potions she was holding the first time she saw them talking amicably in Harry’s bed. They begged her not to say anything, that it wasn’t a big deal anyway, and Madam Pomfrey eventually muttered something about patient confidentiality and walked away. After that, she seemed to run interference. One time, Ron and Hermione tried to come in at lunch and she spoke much louder than necessary that Harry was eating. It was true, she had just served Draco and Harry lunch trays at Harry’s bed and her warning gave Draco time to sneak back to his bed at the end of the ward.
“Harry, I think it’s very unlikely that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater.” Remus said reasonably. “He is only sixteen.”
“I loved what you did, by the way. I think I fell more in love with you when you took the money out. That was a move I would have done.”
“You know, I’m not really into the dating and strings thing either. If you ever wanted, you and I could hook up.” Harry choked on his mouthful. None of the boys had been that forward with him.
Harry thought that was a pretty good excuse to go home, but Hermione pointed out Sirius wouldn’t be home from work, and he was the only way they would have dinner. So, Harry ended up staying for that, then Hermione said Sirius would be busy and they should wait for the weekend to talk to him. Harry wasn’t sure of the logic there, but when he asked, Hermione gave him a lecture with so many big words he couldn’t follow it. That was how they ended up in the library again, trying to get to sleep.
“That’s alright, take all the time you need, gentlemen.” She lingered for a moment, then walked off.
He picked up the larger of the two, wiping his eye. He would normally tear into the paper energetically, rip it to shreds to find the gift inside. Harry always took his time, opening the presents slowly. Draco had never understood why, until now. It was so satisfying, slowly revealing each little part, building the suspense. When he uncovered the gift, he realized he had never appreciated a gift more, even if it was a stupid pair of boxer shorts.
Harry laughed, some small tears escaping from his eyes. What a question. If it, when it, had been asked even a couple minutes previously, he hadn’t been. Now, though…
He shook his head and turned to face Draco, who had put his arm on the other side of Harry, trapping him against the wall. Unlike last night, he had an escape, and what’s more, he felt safe right where he was. “Are we about to snog, then?” Draco asked, and he was a lot closer than Harry assumed.
Nothing mattered. Not anymore. He had to get to Draco. He would do anything, absolutely anything, and that had to count for something.
Feeling much better about himself, he dismissed any guilt he felt and made his way to their Fortress Room.
Harry was sure he couldn’t be called ‘pretty’ and recoiled. “I don’t consider myself to be her owner. She’s more than that to me. She’s my friend.” He tried not to look too offended. Cho seemed to find this strange, as she blinked, and her mouth opened up.
Zacharias scoffed at them, crossing his arms and shaking his head. They raised their eyebrows at each other, each offering him up. Harry bowed, using his arms to indicate him. Draco bowed back in thanks, and pulled out his wand, turning it on Zacharias.
be able to concoct something to help Mr. Potter.” He turned to Dumbledore, “I will need someone to cover my classes.”
Sirius was going to be fine. It was the first thing Harry had asked. He had thought he had died, but he was fortunate Remus had been there, able to counteract the hex right away. He was in Saint Mungo’s, recovering, Dumbledore had promised that Sirius would call on the mirror as soon as he woke up. Harry hadn’t wanted to know what Sirius was shot with.
“No? Fine. Not your fault, goodbye. Make sure you get your toothbrush so your breath doesn’t smell as bad as your attitude.” Harry scoffed, a part of him was honestly impressed at the insult, but the vast majority was offended. Draco pushed him out the door as he tried to think of a comeback, and the door was slammed in his face.
Then, he had denied it. Hermione had watched his face as he said, “Sally isn’t my girlfriend.” She had reviewed the moment hundreds of times, obsessively she knew, and Harry wasn’t lying. He had a lesser version of his face when his name had been called out of the Goblet of Fire. He was a little surprised and confused, not sure why it was even happening. Harry was good at a lot of things, but he couldn’t lie to save his life, not that he usually did, Harry was a pretty honest person, which is another reason why this one big lie bothered her.
The note Rita Skeeter had found and published made it seem like Harry did have someone special, was in a relationship and not just developing feelings for them. Hermione had been happy for him, he had all but confirmed that he was seeing a boy when he said he didn’t have a girlfriend after that second article had been published.
Chapter 2 of Outtakes exploded, and there's now 2 parts. I'm having a hard time deciding when to post, but you're going to see Draco being Harry's hostage in the Second Task soon, yay!
He wasn’t expecting this moment to come until he was eighteen and about to start the rest of his life. He was still struggling with the thought of betraying his family, and he really needed the extra time to come to terms with what he would have to do. He was a proud Malfoy, and proud to be a Malfoy, there was a difference. He had spent his entire life learning about his lineage, his family, his heritage. It meant more to him than almost anything, to him there had been nothing else in the world. Then he had met Harry.
“I think I’m getting expelled no matter what. Don’t do something stupid, Draco. I dragged you into this, I’m going to get you out unscathed.”
“He did it in here,” Hermione said quietly, taking his hand again. It was warm, and it was comforting, but it was so different from Draco’s it felt wrong. “He would read to you, we weren’t sure if you could hear anything, but he never took a break.”
“I’m working on something, looking to see if I can get myself emancipated quietly without notification to my parents. There are very old laws, and I think I might be able to by the time I’m sixteen, and it’s a lot easier then.”
Harry’s glare only intensified. “Draco’s back. He’s unconscious in the hospital wing, but he’s going to be fine. And we’re going to be fine.” He still wasn’t a hundred percent certain of that, considering how long they had been apart, but he was choosing to have faith. “I love him, Ron. I don’t care what you think about him, I’m going to stay with him no matter what. Get used to it.” He pushed his plate back furiously, and stood, stalking his way out of the Hall.
“I’ll be back for you in a minute,” Harry told Draco, who nodded. He threw the cloak over the both of them and they slowly made their way across the hall, being careful to avoid the Death Eaters. He left Sirius in the hidden passageway, opening the portrait slowly while the Death Eaters’ backs were turned. He was so busy watching the Death Eaters, he missed the door slightly and banged into it. He managed not to make another noise, but the Death Eaters had already noticed him.
There was a whispered spell, and a shouted one, and Dumbledore was leaning against the wall. “Ah,” he said, completely at ease with the situation. Harry was not, he was stiff as a board against the wall next to Dumbledore. He had used his moment of defense to ensure Harry couldn’t move. “Mr. Malfoy.”
“Mother, I wouldn’t have anyone else as my mother. You are incredible as a mother, and a more outstanding pureblood matron will never be found elsewhere. Don’t do whatever it is you plan to do.”
“It’s not just you.” Draco commented. “Some people don’t treat being a couple the same way you and I do.” Harry stayed silent, trying to comprehend what he had heard the last couple minutes. “I can hear what you’re thinking.”
Just then, Sarah returned with a basket of fresh bread wrapped in a clean white napkin. “I brought you some bread!” She said cheerfully, as if she was doing them a favor. “Have you had a chance to decide?”
He smiled as he blew out the candles. Draco handed him the knife and Harry cut them both a slice. Before they took bites, Draco toasted him, “I love you more and more every day, Sweetheart. You are the best man I know, and I can’t wait to grow another year older with you.”
“As for you, Mr. Weasley, you are also banned from playing quidditch and you shall have two weeks of detention. I think it would be safe if his twin is also banned.”
Draco nodded his approval but refused to kiss the face that wasn’t Harry’s. “My fiancé wouldn’t like that.” He said, grinning, and leaning away from Harry.
The night of the quidditch match and Harry getting a lifelong ban on quidditch, Hagrid returned. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were out the door to meet him. Hagrid had apparently been with the giants. They (Hagrid and Madam Maxime) hadn’t had much luck on their mission, and Hagrid looked terrible, like he had been beaten.
Harry sucked in air, entranced by Draco’s backside as he lowered himself into the mud stuff. He gave Harry a satisfied sigh and smile and said, “oh yeah, this is nice. Take your time, I’m good here.” Harry laughed and made a show of adjusting himself before he left.
Hermione seemed a little chilly with him before he left, only nodding without looking at him when he said, “I’m going to pack a bag, so I might be gone for a while.”
“No,” Ron shook his head, “but I did tell her I wasn’t going back to school, and that I’m helping you with something Dumbledore left for you to do. She wants to know what, but I haven’t told her.”
Not all relationships are going to be like Harry and Draco's. Most relationships don't last from teen aged years til they die, and it's not special if they all get together right away and stay that way.
Harry picked up his own fork and fed Draco a bite. His aim was ever so slightly off, and a bit of chocolate sauce ended up near Draco’s mouth. He hastened to lick it off for him. “That’s for sure,” he murmured.
The egg screeched just as loudly every time they tried opening it. “Here, give it to me,” Draco said, and tried to grab the egg. Unfortunately, it was slippery and fell through his grip. “Damn,” they both swore as they felt it sink to the bottom of the tub.
handle anything.” Harry smiled and pulled Draco down to him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck and melding their lips together.
It was all so confusing, and it gave Hermione headaches. She wasn’t proud of this, but she had said that Ginny might have a chance with Harry if she moved on, or pretended to, and a part of her did it to see how Harry would react to her. She felt horrible about it, and regretted it, but it was good advice. Ginny had started dating Michael Corner, and had instructed Hermione to inform Harry, then tell her how he reacted. Harry couldn’t have cared less, but she didn’t tell that to Ginny.
“If he feels a certain way, it’s his right. There’s nothing you can do about it. Especially if he’s not going to do you the favor of providing you the opportunity to change his mind. Give him some time, he’ll probably realize he’s hurting you and tell you what’s going on.”
No, it's not Sunday, but I just got finished with Year 5 and decided to celebrate, so here is Year 4, part 1 of 3. I overcame a huge bought of writer's block over the climax of Year 5 and ended up writing an additional 10,000 words than intended in one night. That's a chapter right there; I'm super excited for how it turned out so I thought I'd share some more. Thank you for reading and commenting, I love reading them!
“Uh-huh. Well, we’ll talk about that later, I’m late for the meeting. Have fun.” With that, he left. Harry looked around the library with interest. He picked up a book at random.
“That doesn’t matter. I know you will.” With that, Draco gave Harry a nice big smooch, pushing him towards the wall of the tub. Oh, it felt incredible. Their bare chests touched, and Draco reached up to run his fingers through Harry’s hair, pulling on the strands to get them impossibly closer. Harry could feel Draco’s heart beating, they were so close. He felt himself grow excited and felt when Draco did as well. They stopped kissing slowly, exchanging small pecks as they slowly opened their eyes.
“We have people trying to bring down the wards, if it doesn’t work now, it will at any moment.” It was true, part of The Improved Plan was dismantling the wards. Assuming they were dismantled, they would regroup the distraction division and storm the gates later. Draco nodded, and Sirius stepped closer, putting his hand on the portkey. Draco gripped Harry tighter.
“I love you too, I’ll see you soon.” They kissed once more and left separately, checking to make sure the coast was clear first. Harry had a harder time than ever parting from him. Remus was going to be waiting for him at the platform, and they would go see Sirius, who had woken no worse for wear, then head to Grimmauld Place. Sirius wanted to show him the new house himself, when he was free to leave the hospital. Even with the potential for the best summer ever staring him in the face, he wanted it to be over, so he could be back in Draco’s arms.
“It’s also probably not a good sign that he’s not back right away.” Draco mumbled, but Harry heard him and sighed. “I’ll make you some tea.” Draco busied himself with his task, leaving Harry to pace.
Professor Snape’s eyes flashed. “All potions taken from my store room last night. The cheer potion should not be used with any of the other potions, there are many ingredients that war with ingredients with the other potions. Without knowing all the antidotes, I can’t speak to the level it will harm Potter’s system, but it will do considerable damage.” Hermione froze. It sounded like she had made a bigger mistake than she had thought. Madam Pomfrey hadn’t said anything about other potions, those were all potions that she had dosed him with. Had Malfoy used something other than a potion?
“Peter Pettigrew was there. I brought him back. Dumbledore thinks there might be a serious chance that Sirius will get off.” Draco looked to Sirius, who was smiling happily. “But Draco, he called his followers, and your father was there.” Draco closed his eyes, and just as slowly lowered his head. Harry leaned forward and pulled him into a hug.
He nodded briefly, not looking at Ron, who shifted a bit uncomfortably. He continued eating, hoping Ron wouldn’t say anything else. He did. “I’m glad. Hermione and I have been a bit worried.” Harry didn’t say anything, instead picking up a piece of bacon and tearing of a bit more violently than was necessary. That didn’t entirely dissuade Ron, even if he did gulp and look at the bacon nervously. “I’m glad to see you’re starting to move on.”
“Let me get this right, you order this dough thing, at that dirty counter, from a menu above our heads, and after they bring it to you, you have to go home to eat it?” When Draco said it like that, Harry understood why he was having such a hard time with the concept.
“I’m famous!” Harry shouted. “Literally anyone in the wizarding world could have sent it to me. Of course, I was going to get it checked out, but you got it taken away from me against my will and given it to a teacher! Who is now going to strip it down. I would’ve preferred to have it handled by professionals who work with brooms; who knows if it’ll even be flyable when I get it back? If you had come to me and talked about it, I could’ve told you that, but instead you run off at your first opportunity. Did your bright brain think about that, Hermione, huh?”
“Er…” Harry was dreading this. He knew he had to be as honest as possible, but he knew they wouldn’t be happy with him. Draco was his family. Draco was his family. Draco was his family. “We attracted some unwanted attention. I think Percy must have stalled to give me time to hide or leave, but he must have given something away when he did. Or they just wanted to know why he was hanging out there while a House Elf stole from them.”
“Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I think I will just be heading out.” Draco located Harry’s cloak and started to throw it on.
“I want to ride you,” Harry said without thinking. There were several beats that went by when Harry cleared his head. He had gotten a bit too carried away. “Sorry, I wasn’t really thinking. Let’s go.” Draco nodded shakily. Harry took his hand, gave it a kiss, and showed Draco how to mount the bike.
“I know, and I want to see...it was called 'Hercules,' wasn't it? Do you think it’s intentionally named after the Greek mythology?”
“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?” Hermione suggested more pessimistically. It turned out, Winky had been the one to take it back when they were sitting in the Top Box. The next few minutes were tense, as a strange symbol took to the sky, they were surrounded by Ministry officials and accused of releasing the ‘Dark Mark’ into the sky. Winky had been the one to do that too, and she was fired by her master, Barty Crouch, for it.
“I just don’t understand, you poor thing.” She did, however, focus on him, again. “I’ll talk to him, Harry dear, don’t you worry. You stay here, and I’ll straighten him out.” She bustled off, or tried to, but Harry blocked her. Sirius didn’t deserve to have Mrs. Weasley unleashed on him.
“No, why would they make arrangements for their deaths? Why not just leave? Why would they…? It makes no sense! What were they thinking?” Harry wasn’t entirely sure why he was angry, but he was.
Previously: “Remus, look, is that Marlene?” Harry and Remus both looked at the window, as Remus was distracted, Sirius winked at Harry. “Ah, no, that’s not her. Did I ever tell you that story about the time we went out? It could not have gone worse…” Harry was amazed at the smooth transition. Sirius was seriously cool.
“You haven’t had that talk yet? Well with two boys, there’s more than one way to make love. There’s—” He was grinning, probably joking, but Harry felt his stomach start to squirm.
Inside was Draco, against the far wall, sobbing. He didn’t look up when Harry entered the bathroom, nor when he locked the door. He did when Harry came closer, shifting away and telling him to go away. Harry didn’t.
“Draco Malfoy is alive.” He decided to give them as much information as quickly as possible, lest they stop and question him. He ignored their expressions and continued. “He’s at Malfoy Manor, trapped, and I’m going to break in and rescue him. Portkeys and apparition don’t work, and he’s hurt. Sirius is getting the Order together, and as soon as they’re ready to go, we’re going to be off. We don’t know how long he’s going to be alone. The Manor is in Wiltshire, we’re finding out precisely where. Are you in?”
“That was atrocious!” Draco said finally, as he rose and sat in front of the fire. Harry grinned, and Draco warmed a bit more, he loved that smile. It was a cute mix of self-deprecation and charm. It made his heart beat a tiny bit faster, knowing it was all for at him.
He sighed as he finished his coffee and poured another before leaving the kitchen. He was determined to finish the letter before Teddy dragged him off to decorate the house.
He cleared his throat again, bringing him back to the present. “Brightthistle, Knotgrass, Macmillan and of course, the three Weasley’s.”
“This is your desk” Rolf smiled. “This is Cosima’s desk, and I’ll introduce you when she’s back after Christmas. Once everyone has made their way in, I’ll introduce you to everyone, alright?”
“Where’s all of Aunt Gin’s stuff? I went into the bathroom, and almost everything has gone except for your toothbrush.” Harry sat back, the dread building, as he took a deep breath. He knew that he should have told Ted everything before, but there never seemed to be the right time.
“Think about it, Harry. I think you’d be a great teacher; you really helped me in the DA.” Neville smiled. “I never thought I would be able to cast half of those spells if you hadn’t taught me, and I would never have been able to learn how to cast a Patronus with Snape as my teacher.” He shuddered.
“Is this a complication?” Weasley asked from the door, a quick-notes quill floating in the air behind him. His face showed no sign of mockery or humour, which Draco was more than thankful for.
“You leave me no time to get everything made up.” She growled, “I will make something for you, you silly” She muttered something in Swedish which Draco assumed were swear words or insults. “What do you want?” She asked, her tone less hostile but still business-like.
He watched fitfully as the clock ticked by, each second passing torturously slowly. He tried to put the thoughts out of his head as he checked and rechecked his clothes before eventually collapsing into the armchair, reading through some of his case notes whilst idly doodling in his sketchbook.
“Her and Luna have gone to ‘powder their noses, ’ whatever that means?” Harry shrugged before pulling one of the other whiskeys towards him. He took a sip of his whisky and caught sight of what he could only be described as a walking, lime-green pompom. He choked on his whiskey, causing Ron to turn. How had he not noticed her in the hall sooner? There were more frills on her dress than Ron had on his old hand-me-down dress robes.
“Oh and, Uncle? Draco really loves chocolate.” Ted grinned and winked before he left the room. Harry stood blinking at the door as he felt a cold thrill of anxiety rush down his spine. What did Ted mean? And why did Harry need to know that? If he didn’t know better, he’d say that Ted was trying to set them up.
The following week flew by quicker than Harry could have anticipated. The day after had been lovely; he had spent time with Neville as they graded papers together, swapping stories about their pupils and their answers. But, by Monday, his visit to Sweden seemed a world away.
Draco opened his mouth, desperate to know more. How could Weasley possibly understand what he’d been through and how hard he’d worked in the last decade. How much he had tried to change and improve. He let the sentence stop there, afraid of what he wanted to add. ’To be worthy of Him.’
“You’re being ridiculous. So Weasley is not going to the newspapers, and so what if he tells Potter?” Blaise shrugged.
“I haven’t read about it in the papers, so they must be keeping it to themselves. Maybe Potter doesn’t mind sharing?” Blaise smirked, winking at him. Draco couldn’t find it in himself to reply. His mind was still reeling.
“Don’t you worry your world-saving socks. Patrik’s good looking, but he’s not my type!” Draco smirked, he did enjoy teasing the thin jealous streak Harry had.
“It’s just as well that I trust you both with my life, isn’t it?” Harry muttered with an eye roll and a smile.
“Indeed, a veritable mine of information.” Draco agreed, his mind darting back briefly to Ginny’s supposed affair. “Were you able to find out any other dig up any more gems, or did the vein run dry?”
“You know what Somnus delorem stands for, I assume? Sleeping agony.” Granger offered again in the same tone she had so many times before in the classroom.
Harry looked away from her stern look and looked back to his drink. He downed another feeling the need to get very drunk, returning.
He hastened his steps as though being chased, feeling closed in by the two columns of conifers pressing in on both sides. The irrational fear resurfacing from childhood, climaxing as he ran out of harm’s way, well outside of the trees reach. He turned back to look at the looming wall of branch and shadow and remembered how, as a child, he’d thought that an inferius would reach out and snatch him if he didn’t walk quick enough. He shuddered, fear flashing up his spine before it was gone. He chided himself, knowing he was being childish. He tried to take a deep breath to steady himself as he turned to face the still, oppressive manor again. The tall, daunting turrets stood black and solid against the moonlight.
“A good plan,” Rolf nodded. “Do you need any files from the archives? I’m just heading there myself.” Draco smiled and nodded eagerly.
“It was. A very illuminating morning. It is now Lunchtime.” She smiled as she placed the paper she had been reading down. She crossed her hands over her bulbous belly and smirked at him. “So, good evening?” she asked, her eyebrows rising curiously. Draco fought the blush as he smiled.
The birds chirped away high in the pine trees as Draco started his ascent to the main house. Maybe Harry was there eating breakfast.
“No, just thinking. I’ve been looking over the files you gave me. Thought I’d try and get a head start on the new year.“
Harry smiled back and nodded. It would be her style to slip in some Amortentia into it if no one was looking; she did have form for it, after all.
All too quickly, the time of Harry’s portkey back to Hogwarts loomed. Noomi and Patrik had already bid their goodbyes as they left Draco and Harry, allowing them some privacy. They sat on the steps of the large house, the stars beginning to make their appearance.
Blaise’s chipper voice announced as he carried in the cups. He looked between them as he placed the cups down carefully. His eyes clamped onto Weasley for a moment as if detecting some of the tension in the room.
“Harry James Potter! We have been friends since we were eleven, don’t waste your breath trying to lie to me,” She looked disapprovingly at him. “And before you say anything else, it may be worth knowing that Ginny and I have already talked.” She glanced at him. She offered a smile as she reached out and placed her hand on his arm.
The last time he had been within the ministry had been the final day of his trial. He shivered at the thought of that dark and isolated hall where the cold shackles had cut into his wrists. Where only a doorway stood between him and the dementors of prison, he remembered looking up into the gallery within the Wizengamot court where lots of stern and hostile faces glared down at him. Geering and heckling as he tried to make himself as small as possible.
“Yeah, it’s a great facility. Albeit very different from the Romanian one. It’s weird seeing all the blues. There aren’t many other breeds here. The conference coordinator, Patrik, is lovely too. He’s gone out of his way to accommodate me.”
As Draco sat in the Goblin-owned restaurant with his house-elf waitress, eating a delicious Caprese salad with spiced Hake, he found that he didn’t mind the changes to wizarding Britain in the slightest. As a child, blood purity had confused him, and as a teen and adult, it had brought him nothing but misery. So he welcomed the changes as he sipped his wine and smiled warmly at his lunch companion.
It wasn’t just the handshake; it was what the handshake represented; Acceptance and maybe forgiveness. He was sure that if Harry had taken his hand that first night at Hogwarts, then his life would have been ineffably different. His imagination painted pictures across his mind’s eyes of himself and the golden trio studying together in the library or wandering down to Hogsmeade to grab a butterbeer. Harry or Granger, holding his hand, and he told Dumbledore about the Death Eaters plans. If nothing else, maybe he could have saved his uncle. Maybe, just maybe, he wouldn’t have the unsightly scar on his forearm.
“Are you ready for lunch?” Draco nodded. But before they could leave, there was a loud crack behind him. Draco spun around only to come face-to-face with a house elf. Pepin, the owl, squawked loudly and flapped his wings in fright at the intrusion.
“I had been out looking for the abandoned nests when the storm blew in and stranded me on the hillside. Luckily we have little shelters all over. I bunked down, waiting for the storm to pass when there was a crash to the side. I jumped out of my skin; I thought lightning had struck the roof, I head something roll down, and I saw a man on the ground. I stamped out the fire of his broom and brought him inside.”
“I’ve…I’ve needed you…too,” He stuttered as Harry began biting his neck again. They slowly built up a rhythm as both of them tried to find something to hold on to. Draco could feel what felt like electricity burning within his veins as his fingers buried themselves into Harry’s hair, his back, pressing into the cushions. He eventually cried out, not caring who’d hear them. Hearing Harry grunt and pant as they gradually fell apart, was doing things to Draco, coiling and expanding the lust and desire that resided at his base. Their breathing grew ragged and shallow as Harry’s cock pushed him closer to the edge.
He blanched as he swigged directly from the bottle, sure that some pureblood ancestor was no doubt rolling around in their portrait in disgust as he performed such an uncouth act. He swigged more, defying his ancestors to do something about it. It was somewhere around his fifth swig that the first gasp erupted from his mouth; even the whiskey’s burn was unable to cauterise the wounds inside him.
Closing his eyes against the room, the lights and the mere concept of the tree, he hoped he could hibernate, leaving this year behind. He wasn’t in the mood for all the fuss, but Teddy had told him, in no uncertain terms, that sulking and bouts of melancholy were not permitted. Luckily, Teddy was still at the Weasley’s, so no one was there to police him now.
Harry sat down on one of the steps and immediately regretting the decision as the cold penetrated his trousers and leeched the heat from his legs and backside. Images of Malfoy flashed through his head, lean body, dishevelled hair and liquid silver eyes. He pressed his palms into his eyes until white dots graced his vision, hoping to purge his mind’s eye of the images. What was happening to him? It couldn’t be an attraction. It had to be something else. Maybe someone had spiked his whiskey?
“Good Afternoon, Mr Malfoy. My name is Joyce, and I’m the mediwitch in charge of your case during your stay with us.”
Something caught around his ankles, sending him careening forward towards the floor. His cheekbone took the brunt of the fall, sending a blinding flash of light behind his eyes. He groaned before he heard a snicker coming from the lifts.
“So come on, how did you get here? This place is unplottable, so I know you didn’t just make a lucky guess.”
He cursed Harry’s timing as he turned back to the room. Sighing as he rubbed his face again. Draco supposed that it would give him time to write a suitable reply whilst giving him time to mull over the possibility of attending the gathering.
He’d offered to come to the funeral. To show his last respects to the man who had bullied and tortured him as a child. Dudley had told him to stay away, fearing his mother’s mental state would finally collapse at the sight of him after so long. So anonymously, he’d sent flowers and left it at that. He had thought about getting back in touch but wasn’t sure he was ready to open those old wounds.
“Has Draco not stirred?” She asked, her face beaming with a knowing smile. She giggled when Patrik nodded.
He was relieved to come home to an empty house. As Ginny had thrown herself into training, he would often find himself alone. The relief of not needing to keep up the pretence in front of people was ineffable.
“Did you not want to go and dance?” Harry shouted over the music. Ron shook his head and pointed to the three fire whiskeys sitting in a cluster.
Harry smiled despite himself and his Father-in-law’s love of everything muggle. He nodded, knowing that he needed to say something. He needed to discuss it with Ginny first. If they were going to tell them, it needed to come from them both.
Draco closed his eyes to hide the glint of hope. Blaise snorted dismissively, not paying too much attention to him.
We (Teddy Lupin & I) invited you to a small gathering we’re holding for New Year’s eve. Please let me know whether you can attend.
Harry raised an eyebrow and looked between them. “Alright.” He said a little hesitantly. He knew they weren’t being entirely honest, but he figured it was their business and if they didn’t want to tell them, that was their right. It stung a little to be discluded so obviously, but people had a right to privacy, and he got over his feelings within two seconds. “I brought you a book, Hermione.” He said brightly, dismissing the previous matter.
“It’s not a lie, Sirius.” Harry said with some heat. His right hand burned with remembrance where the words were forever carved into his skin. Draco took the hand gently and raised it to his lips before holding it on his lap. Harry narrowed his eyes slightly, how did Draco know what he was thinking again? He would need to ask his husband about that later. “We really don’t know for sure. We just know it’s important that we have it.”
“Come on,” he whispered to Harry after several short kisses where he attempted to pull away. Harry nodded blindly and hurried along uncomplaining as Draco dragged him away.
“Do you want to dance?” Draco asked, holding out his hand. Harry took it and they danced in the center of the room, music changing to a slow soft melody.
He vaguely registered Dumbledore leaving, Pomfrey moving about the wing, and time passing. Students came to the door asking about Harry, but Pomfrey turned them all away. He ran out of things to say, and just quietly laid next to him. He caught Pomfrey looking at him, but all she did was pull the privacy curtains around Harry’s bed.
“I meant to ask earlier, but I got a bit distracted. Are we celebrating anything tonight?” She asked, inviting herself into the festivities.
Draco straddled him, looking him in the eyes as their foreheads touched, before Draco placed a tiny but passionate kiss on his lips. Then they ran lower as Draco slowly unbuttoned Harry’s shirt. Harry tilted his head back and moaned lowly, he didn’t mind Draco taking control. When his shirt was undone, Draco pulled it off him and started sucking the skin above his heart.
“You really didn’t have to do all this, Sirius.” He said as he slowly opened another present. It was a packet of underwear. Harry groaned theatrically.
“I want to mark you,” Draco said, Harry knew he wasn’t seeking permission. “Because you’re mine, and mine alone.” He started sucking little spots all over Harry’s back. Harry jumped when one of them happened upon his spine, he was apparently extremely sensitive there.
Harry wouldn’t do that. Worse, he would pity him, or be so uncomfortable that they drifted apart. It wasn’t worth the risk. All it would be is a fling that would lead to unhappiness. It would pass.
Slowly, he became aware of movement around him, voices, noises. There were words being spoken to him, but he was too far out of it to register what was being said. He moaned in pain as he was lifted, as gently as it was. The scene around him was changing, he closed his eyes, too tired to do anything else.
He looked up when Sirius’s voice wavered, and he wiped away tears too. “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry,” he said, he got up and leaned over Harry’s chair, giving him an awkward but comforting hug, and Harry couldn’t keep the sobs at bay anymore. Sirius just hugged him tighter.
“Breathe in. Good now, breathe out. Good.” Sally was talking to him, and the words invaded his mind as if he was underwater then suddenly surfaced. They were against a wall around a corner from the main doors. He felt himself calm down, then embarrassment welled. No one had seen him lose it except for Draco, and he still had trouble with him seeing that.
Meanwhile in Harry’s square, he had come upon his first obstacle. It was a small pond, too wide to sneak around, too long to jump across. Harry looked back but faced forward again. He got on his hands and knees, trying to see into the depths but presumably couldn’t. He stood, thinking for less than a minute before he was casting a freezing charm on the upper part of the pond. The crowd gasped, and he moved forward, walking very carefully over the frozen water. The camera zoomed in, just as a very ugly face appeared under the ice. Draco laughed as Harry jumped and pointed at the screen and nudging Vincent with his other arm. Two dumb chortles echoed around him as the rest of the Slytherins in his section joined in. Draco and the rest had jumped too, but there was no way they were confessing that.
They were quiet for a while, Draco running his hands up and down the arms that were around him. “How did you get this one?” Draco asked after a while. Harry looked down at the scar Draco was stroking. It was one of the bigger ones, but only noticeable if you looked closely. On his left arm, just under his elbow was a triangle of discoloration a couple shades lighter than Harry’s skin tone.
Harry sighed. “They’re hard-core Christian muggles, and they don’t like her being a witch, or gay. It was apparently too much for them.”
They walked slowly to Gryffindor tower, Draco commenting that he owed Harry for the number of times he had accompanied Draco to the Slytherin dorms. When they arrived at the Fat Lady’s portrait, they had an even harder time saying goodbye, letting the kisses linger longer and longer.
Harry sacrificed some time to get Draco’s clothes off. He only helped minimally, realizing that he’d get Harry off faster if he did help, but not wanting to do anything to aide him.
Harry and Draco both waved, and a couple diners waved back. They joined hands and swung them back and forth as they walked further down the streets.
“That makes my job easier.” Draco continued. “So, we just have to divvy up the available space here. Do you mind if we put some of your shirts in the cabinets? Oh, and we’ll definitely need to put away some of these trousers.”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean? I’ve told you everything I know.” Ron and Hermione looked at each other, and Harry had a hard time not groaning.
Draco only felt some tension leave him. His Father had been furious. He could tell by how wide his Father’s nostrils became. Naturally, they were rather thin, but if he became upset, they would flail. It was tiny degrees, but his temper happened quickly. As he stared down at them in the Great Hall, Draco had never seen his nose bigger.
“We’ll see. I’m pretty sure this little cottage will be too small by the end of the summer.” Harry shook his head, but Sirius went on, “Oh yeah? Want to bet?” Harry hesitated, and Sirius laughed. “It’s alright. You’re a kid. Growing up is what you’re supposed to do.”
Harry grinned, it was the first time he had been introduced as such, and he rather liked it. The woman tilted her head and opened her mouth, but the man spoke first.
He came to slowly, realizing that he was still under Draco, and his arm had fallen asleep, same as the rest of him. He shook his head slightly, rubbing his eyes and yawning lightly. He felt better than he ever had, other than the slight sticky situation he had occurring in his nether land.
“Okay,” Harry agreed easily. Someday was not something he pondered very often. It was just some time in the future, some thing that everybody did eventually. It made him wonder what he and Draco would be when he did tell him. Would they go back to being friends, or would they be boyfriends? Partners—that was the term when the couple was gay and serious right? Suddenly, a whole new world opened up, a world in which he had a future. Possibly, a future with Draco.
“Daddy will be pleased,” she said, not sounding much happier, and Harry wondered if she ever showed her emotions.
He knew, in a way, what it was like to lose a mother, and he never wanted anyone to experience it, least of all Draco. He knew that Draco and his mother weren’t exactly close, they had a lot of issues between them, but she was his mother. Draco would do anything for her. He loved her.
Draco gasped. “How did I not know that? I’m marrying into Sleekeazy’s family? Wow!” He dropped the bottles into the sink and wrapped his arms around Harry. “You just got even sexier,” he purred.
It was both relieving and difficult going back to class. Eager to get their classes back under control, the teachers assigned plenty of homework to keep them all occupied. That wasn’t all that kept them occupied, however. The mystery of the Chamber of Secrets continued, and Harry really needed to bring it up with Draco, if there was any chance for them to meet.
They enjoyed their dinner, and quickly dubbed it a date that would need to be repeated. Afterwards, Harry escorted Draco back to his common room, received a kiss, and headed up to his.
Besides, if they were going to have to watch a champion all year, the champion might as well be good looking.
Harry looked around and recognized he was in the dungeons. He usually ended up there when he went wandering. He figured he was searching for any reminder of Draco. He hadn’t gone to their special room, couldn’t stomach the thought of being there without him, but the familiar hallways helped remind him of Draco.
“I just hope that you can find some way to be alright with Harry’s and my relationship. Not for my sake, but for his. I know how much you mean to him, and I hope you do as well.” He held their gaze, then looked at the surrounding Gryffindors who were all looking up at him.
When they separated, Harry whispered, “Are you sure you’re ok, Baby?” Draco glared at the name but nodded.
He spent several minutes simply staring at it before heat started to flood his face. He picked the package up gingerly and read the back. He wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about this.
Hermione had spent all week researching various means of making someone do what you wanted. She had found several options other than love potions, and they were all extremely dark. She had even considered the Imperius curse, but Harry was able to throw it off.
“I’ll drink to that!” Draco said, picking up his own glass and clinking it with Sirius’s. Harry did the same and they all took a sip.
Harry and Draco didn't find the locket horcrux at Umbitch's house, which means they have to get it from her when she comes home. But attacking her at home means they won't need to break into the Ministry...right?
Ron and Hermione both wrote him vague letters describing their summers so far, but Harry could tell there was a lot unsaid. He was just as allusive, not mentioning Draco or his own whereabouts, lest the letter be intercepted.
He washed Harry slowly, making sure he got every speck of mud or dirty off of Harry. He got down on his knees to do Harry’s legs, lifting each one to do the bottoms of Harry’s feet. Harry had never felt so clean. When Draco finally deemed him clean enough, he took the loofa and repeated the actions on Draco, holding onto his arms when he did them, and supporting his back for the rest of it. His cock stirred in interest as Harry cleaned it, and when the soap was washed off it, he couldn’t help but give it a kiss, which turned into a couple, which turned into him opening his mouth to take Draco into it. He looked up at him through his eyelashes.
Harry laughed, bringing up a hand to cover his face before slowly sitting up. Ron and Neville were standing behind Hermione, they each had a look of fear upon their faces.
Ginny had been watching Harry intently and looked startled when he turned to her expectantly. “Oh, yes, I’m Ginny, Ginny Weasley. I suppose it was mostly the same with me. I had a very big crush on this boy for most of my childhood, I guess it overmarked everything else.” She blushed for the first time in a long time, and Harry was reminded of who that boy was. He was so glad she was over him. “But there was a girl, too. A really special girl, and I think I overlooked her because I was so focused on other things. I didn’t realize what that meant until very recently. So, I think that makes me bi.” She was looking at her knees and had a strange, contemplative look in her eyes.
“Here,” he said lightly, taking hold of Draco’s wrist. “I want you to have this.” He unclasped his father’s watch and secured it on Draco.
He knew that there was no proof, and he probably shouldn’t even be up in the Headmaster’s office. There was never any proof he took the things he took. He had them in a box under his bed, enchanted to be hidden from prying eyes. He only ever took them out in the dead of night, when everyone else was asleep. So, there was no way he was in enough trouble to warrant a trip up here. This deserved punishment.
“Please.” He honestly wasn’t sure which one of them said it, it easily could have escaped his own mouth as well as Draco’s. He knew it meant they were both getting close. Draco gripped his forearms, using them as leverage to even more brutally rut against Harry.
“Dumbledore came too and rounded up the Death Eaters that hadn’t been captured. That’s when the Minister and half the Ministry turned up.” Harry’s head snapped up, looking at Sirius. “They arrested the Death Eaters on trespassing charges, we were lucky to get out of it myself, but luckily we had a couple Aurors on our side, which helped fudge the details. Draco,” Sirius focused on him and a look of sympathy came across his features. “Your father was with the group. He was arrested as well. I’m sorry.”
“What?” Draco questioned angrily. “You’re making him choose?” His eyes found Harry’s, then went back to Ron. He pushed Harry aside lightly so he could speak to Ron directly.
“Please don’t break up with me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t leave, I just can’t, I’m the heir, and I care about my family’s honor. I don’t know if I’d make it out, even, I don’t know if my father would—” he cut off, shuddering again. “I don’t know what to do, Harry.”
Harry ground his teeth. “I don’t see how that’s any of your business. You’ve proven that getting the horcruxes aren’t important to you.”
“Because it seems like there is a lot ‘up’ and you won’t tell us about any of it!” Hermione accused. “Where were you?”
Previously: "Harry smiled, pleased in his skill of loving his love to sleep. He settled in next to Draco, afraid of waking him or he would have pulled them closer. His eyes drifted closed as he listened to Draco’s gentle breathing."
Suddenly something seemed to snap into Draco's head. It was just a tiny piece that the mechanism of understanding had been missing, but now the apparatus started to work inexorably and suddenly he knew what question to ask. "You didn't by any chance consume a potion at some point - say this morning or even at noon?"
This time, too, the images stirred the ugly imprints of long-past torment, and the tears were already burning behind his pinched eyelids when Potter confronted him with the certainty that the only positive thing about Draco's act was nothing but imagination; that Potter was far from pure and innocent.
It was a posture he had seen all too often in the common room of his house. Demonstrative superiority. What was a daily exercise in Slytherin surroundings seemed simply unnatural on a person who had shone so reliably in the past that he would do so forever in Draco's mind.
Although strictly speaking none of this was a lie, none of these sentences would ever pass Draco's lips. He knew himself well enough to know that he would strike the wrong tone, for that was one of his traits that had manifested itself in every meeting between them.
Forgetting himself, he bowed his head and licked over it, but as Potter moaned and his hips rubbed against his lap in a circular motion, his attention was lost in the dark curls of his pubic hair that framed the base of Potter's penis.
The thought that perhaps this was not Potter at all forced its way up from the depths of a memory he had been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to suppress. Filled with a dark foreboding, he searched the previous conversation for a clue, for anything that might disprove his apprehension. Only his reaction to the accusation of acting like Lucius Malfoy fit Potter's pattern. Everything else seemed to belong to an entirely different person. To mock Draco, perhaps as an act of reckoning, he conceded to him, but to attack when the opponent had closed his eyes, was unarmed and thus defenseless? Never in a million years.
He was going to betray himself anyway; he was going to let himself be defiled again voluntarily and in full possession of his mental powers, so it wouldn't hurt to indulge in this moment - always with the hope in the back of his mind that he would be finished quickly enough so that the Polyjuice Potion wouldn't forfeit its effectiveness. For nothing in the world would he want to do it with Zabini himself.
Potter's hands clenched in the hem of the ugly cloak before he glanced straight at him. His face was devoid of emotion, but Draco was sure that the smooth facade would nearly burst with tension if he could only look closer.
Draco's heart gave out on a beat. The fact that Potter did such a thing, out of a simple, albeit snotty mood, was not as shocking to him as it would have been half a day ago. After all he had done to Draco, he was no longer surprised. What amazed him was that he had saved him without knowing or wanting to.
It was a moment that made one thing clear to Draco: No matter if Potter knelt before him, no matter if he let himself be overpowered by him; and if Draco tied him up - Potter would always have the upper hand. Sex had been a game Potter had played with him, not the other way around.
Only when Potter's head disappeared into the ground did Draco take his hands off his ears. From somewhere, a protracted clattering sound echoed through the house.
Potter had been tense even before he had lifted his head. He shot Draco an intense look and lifted his finger to his lips, his wand pointed at the servant's chamber. With the other hand, he waved wildly, probably to signify Draco keep standing there.
"I didn't think about it either. The light never gets to this place," whispered Draco. All of a sudden it seemed to him that the so-called freight elevator was a crucial detail in their search for the spook. The glow of the fog illuminated the metal skeleton in a stunning way, and Draco could hardly take his eyes off the gray shreds dripping into the gaps between the ground and impenetrable darkness.
There was nothing left in this world now to stop him, to save his heart and soul. Draco had surrendered; long ago and completely.
Potter closed his eyes in agony and took a deep breath before launching into a retort, and it was at that moment that something inside Draco broke. It was already clear that it was going to be the answer he was so desperately waiting for, and instead of the expected triumph, he felt disillusioned in a brutal way, because he already knew how he was going to play his cards - and completely unmask himself in the process.
Without looking up, Potter began to laugh, deep and rumbling like a panther in a cage, and Draco shuddered involuntarily. Out of the corner of his eye, he vaguely saw the lime green melting from Potter's shoulders. Still, he winced and drew in a gasping breath as the cloak hit the floor with a loud audible thump.
"Yes, report me, Malfoy! Tell your father, report me to my instructor; do what suits you best, but blackmailing a public figure is surely just what the Wizengamot is still lacking to come to a more correct assessment of your punishability!" he spat.
Hoping that Zabini had cracked an agonizing joke, Draco waited for him to continue speaking, but he merely crossed his arms in front of his chest, allowing an uncomfortable ball of excitement and nausea to grow in Draco's stomach.
He looked doubtfully at a free-standing washbasin next to the work surface, which had seen better days, but looked pleasantly usable compared to the rest of the room, except for the greenish coating in the stone basin. He twisted a rusted gear on a wide, curved tube and grimaced as brownish water gushed into the basin.
"Do you hear that, too?" whispered Potter. Quivering with obvious excitement, he put his hands behind his ears, and at that very moment it became clear what he meant, for it suddenly intensified.
The success of his approach became immediately apparent. Potter turned white as a sheet, and the superiority was knocked out of him more with each syllable, until he seemed somehow.... limp, making it difficult for Draco to deliver the final blow with his only weapon. Even as he spoke, a bitter taste spread through his mouth. "I have something to learn from you."
Draco breathed shallowly, making sure Potter didn't notice him getting ready behind his back, holding his almost overstimulated throbbing glans in position above Potter's hole, and allowed himself to enjoy the disappointment on his sweet face for a few moments.
He could apparate home and endure his father's disgust at him, accept that his mother would stand protectively in front of him, giving Lucius even more reasons for his contempt. But at some point, he would forgive him and grant him his inheritance again, and Draco would never have to think again about where he could get clean water - or anything to eat.
house. The Ministry had the title deed. But Mr. Malfoy burst in and demanded the return of this very deed, so I stole it because... I thought it was important. Well, actually, he was pushy and absolutely hideous to Heather at the reception. I, um... I just didn't want to grant him the chance to get what he wanted. I'm sorry that I was so... It was just like back then in school all of a sudden."
As Potter shook his head, as if to awaken from a daze, a clock chimed somewhere in the depths of the house. The sound was the same one he had heard after Potter had burst into the kitchen.
Potter put his fingers to his lips, his indistinct gaze sliding to the ground. "I've gone too far," he murmured muffled, and suddenly a clear hint of panic flew into his face. "I didn't want this, Malfoy! At least not like this, not that - Why didn't you say I -"
He didn't have to go in to know that this house wasn't just deserted - it had long since died. His last visit was barely eight years ago (he had managed to escape the social obligations of a Malfoy in London after enrolling at Hogwarts), but it seemed like a century. Even though Draco's body trembled from the cold and his hands were red and numb, he couldn't move to close the door. Wouldn't it be as if he was closing the heavy lid of a stone sarcophagus over himself, with no way to ever free himself?
Seconds later, Potter was squeezing his rock-hard penis and giggling when Draco's eyes snapped open in an instant. He felt his wand slip from his hand before it hit the floor with a clatter.
Biting his teeth together, he clasped his wand with his trembling hand and took his panicky fear as given, just as he had once done with the grief over his misfortune in love; he slowly got up on his feet and stepped up to the gaping hole in the wall. He clasped his free hand around the banister of the stairs, then he stretched his head over the abyss.
"Why don't you just leave me alone?" groaned Draco, running both hands through his hair, wedging his fingers in his strands. "What do you get out of tormenting me over this basement?"
Draco trembled with desire and he hoped he had interpreted the hint correctly, because if not, he would be lost forever. Hurriedly, he dropped back onto his back, tensed up and grabbed Potter's hips as fast as he could. He didn't take the time to look at Potter's face for the reaction to his plan, because that could ruin everything; instead, he rammed his knees into Potter's back in a single, flowing movement from behind. Defenseless, the fingers of one hand up his butt, the other hanging uselessly, he buried Draco underneath him and gasped.
There weren't many things Draco had been as certain of as the fact that Harry Potter would never hesitate when it came to putting himself in danger. Although this knowledge was also part of a spate of beliefs falsified that very day, such as 'Harry Potter would never touch a Slytherin with pliers' and 'The only really erotic thing about him is his small, round bottom', it was still the most logical of the three assumptions. On closer inspection he could have erased the other two much earlier.
"That's why you wouldn't admit it," whispered Draco. "A potion of happiness telling you to put your hands inside my pants -"
Potter still wiped those ugly glasses and kept his gaze down. The raven-black hair covered his face, only his reddened nose was sticking out, and Draco wished he would finally look up, at least as much as he hoped it would never happen.
As if by magic, Draco's gaze shot up to Potter's member, which was hanging limply between his thighs. In the fraction of a moment, he felt dismay that Potter had remained unsatisfied and would not allow Draco to deal with it as Potter's warm fingertips pressed against his cheek. "You're a bit slow today, aren't you?"
"That's not what - I didn't mean that -" Biting his lower lip, rubbing over the marks of Potter's teeth, he tried to remember who he was. Draco Malfoy, a man who, despite all his insecurities, despite his discord with his own parents, had nevertheless undergone some basic training; a man who had learned to cope with such disappointments without letting them show, surely had to have some way of pulling himself together!
The unfocused look from the green eyes floated over Draco; and suddenly the whole world seemed to dissolve. Something stretched in his testicles and spread through him rapidly until the tension had taken over his entire body and hardened his cock as much as he had never felt before; the grueling heat seemed to burn him, enveloping his glans, into the unbearable.
When Potter moaned his name once more, he held him by the hips to stop his movements, and a split second later began to fuck Harry as hard, fast and recklessly as he could.
"Because it's important to get to the basement, Malfoy. I don't know why, but it just is." At last Potter raised his head, made sure Draco was looking at him, then ran his hand through his hair, deliberately, it seemed, for by this movement he drew attention to his arm, his shoulders, his armpit; to the fact that his upper body was naked. A nerve on Draco's cheek began to twitch, and he dug his fingernails into his palm to keep himself from letting his gaze slide down the length of his neck, giving himself up.
First: Potter had dedicated himself to the fight against the conviction of Severus Snape. After all, he had appeared in court and had made a passionate plea about how quickly the entire population of the wizarding world pointed their fingers at anything that did not reveal every one of its secrets at first glance. This made him a great defender of a well-known Slytherin, and the fact that he had casually described the selection process of the Sorting Hat as irrelevant and the division of students into houses in general as outdated, allowed only the conclusion that he was least interested in the imaginary crest on a man's chest.
"Just let me rest for now. I'm not a sex machine," he said, raising one hand in a hopeless attempt to straighten his tangled mop of hair, pulling his glasses off his ear with the other.
"Reparo may be enough with your glasses, but you can't seriously believe you can wipe out all magical damage with it," snapped Draco. Out of the corner of his eye he saw that Potter had put his unspeakable cloak back on and breathed out in relief.
"Oh, of course," Draco replied, allowing that sarcastic undertone that had forced itself onto his tongue to show. "I suppose if I don't get myself sorted out for the next ... say, fifty minutes, you will have to go to the bathroom for a minute. Or maybe you'll do it right here. There are plenty of options, after all, especially for someone like you."
Carelessly wiping his hands on his pants, he turned. Behind him stood three chairs grouped around a narrow table. They may have shone in fresh gray ages ago, but that could only be guessed at, in places where the dirt had not yet stuck.
Potter stood with his forehead leaning against the metal bars, his fingers interlocked in the grid above his head. He looked like a boy pressing his face against the window of a candy store, lusting for what the glass pane separated him from - and for a permission to explore it.
Draco could probably have easily freed himself - he still outdid Potter by a head length and had proportionately larger hands - but Potter dropped to his knees and grabbed Draco's penis with his free hand. He didn't rub it, but held it upwards.
In his desperation, he hadn't noticed that Potter had moved closer again. A tug at Draco's suit trousers, tentative at first, seeming almost accidental; Potter's breath on his neck; then the whir of the zipper. A warm hand brushing his pants off his hips.
By now the water had become clear. So at least Draco still had some time to make a decision. Instead of cleaning the cups in the water and washing off the sticky dust film, he put the wand on the counter so that the shining tip was pointing at the basin, held the still cleaner hands and let the water run in, then drank in hasty tips.
"You don't want to fuck me anymore because it would hurt too much if I left." It was not a question, but a statement. Draco saw no reason to interrupt their intense contact to say anything. There was nothing he needed to correct. "But you're ignoring the fact that it's already too late."
With deliberate effort, Draco screwed up his face. "I hope you choke on your own tongue, Zabini!" he groaned.
A bright laugh. "Why do you resist this much? Your efforts are in vain. You know that; and haven't you seen all that you're trying so desperately to block out just now, anyway?"
He had not been prepared for Potter to suddenly look up. The blush on his cheeks had long since descended to his chest, perhaps even deeper, but Draco didn't dare to follow the trail because something in the fleeting seconds that had passed since he had looked up unexpectedly had frozen Potter's hand in their movement. Confused, Potter frowned and retreated, taking a step back, letting the cold air flow into the space between their bodies.
Potter shivered. Without taking his hands out of his face, he nodded. "I did. But that's no excuse for something like that. I mean, why isn't this damn potion forbidden if you can't control your actions anymore? The worst thing is that even after the effects wear off, I still -"
Against what he had expected, Potter did not budge. On the contrary, he crossed his arms in front of his chest, and instead of letting any reason burn up in his anger, he simply didn't let Draco's venom get to him.
The laughter ceased instantly and Draco closed his eyes regretfully. Already, he felt the pain return and reappear in his heart like a shard that had been missing for completeness. "I do not know how to explain this."
"I've already used it." Potter took a deep breath and then turned around, still holding on to the grid. "Shall I hand the deed over to him? Even as an Auror I actually have to wait for the owner's permission during such investigations." His cheeks turned pale pink, and he leaned seemingly casually with his back against the elevator.
Potter's fingers, contrary to his otherwise uncouth appearance, were finely cut, slender, and somehow soft. Draco knew them well. He had often watched them in his dreams, idly stroking the slender chest, but he had forbidden himself to remember whenever his mind lingered on it. But now that he had realized what he was about to do - what did it matter to resurrect the image at this point?
But even the agonized cries in his head were gradually silenced as Potter let his hand slide down the shaft deeper, circling the tip; despite the fucking embarrassment, the feeling was quivering and engrossing and one of a kind in its uniqueness, and every inch of skin on his body became hot, even though he was standing half-naked in what was actually an uninhabited house, surrounded by cold air enriched with years of muff. He was nothing more than this audible throbbing of his bloodstream, nothing more than this river of fire that ran through his flesh and scorched his resistance, nothing more than this delicious hand that tore down his walls in a laughably paradoxical way.
If he hadn't invaded here, hadn't tied Draco up, he would never have known what it was like to hold the real Potter in his arms.
Hands trembling, he pointed the wand at the grating and paused when he recognized the traces of Potter's hands in the dust deposits. He glanced over the lock's mechanism. Contrary to what he had thought, the struts were not rusted together, but rather fused together where they should have been separated. Obviously an act of sabotage, but so precise that it could only have been a wizard or a witch. Either one of the former inhabitants had wanted to protect the following generations from what was lurking down there, or his parents had blocked access out of sheer contempt for any Muggle technology.
"You can't -" Draco whispered and fell silent, for Potter chose this moment to drop himself with all his might onto Draco's lap.
Draco glanced cautiously down at the unity of their bodies; he assumed that it was enough to see Potter's flaccid penis to drive the arousal out of him with one blow, but the opposite was true - Potter was harder than ever, so plump that Draco inevitably thought he was about to burst and empty his semen on his belly, quivering.
Draco tried not to let his eyes wander, for his thoughts had melted into an imperceptible hum. Letting them swell again by allowing himself to become aware of the misery could quickly end fatally. It was enough for him to remember the possessions of foreign Muggles that were still scattered here as if the residents had left in undue haste. Linen hanging over bare nails and dusting, open suitcases, half-covered by wooden bed frames, that seemed to spew their contents on the floor.
Draco wanted to shout at him to let it go, wanted to shake him until he came to his senses, but the horror had paralyzed his body. There was nothing he could do but wait to see what monster would rise out of nowhere when the rusted grids could be pushed aside.
In Draco's family, this would have been considered weak style; such an obvious act of bribery would have been laughed at mercilessly, but in his chest a chilling current of fear stirred into excitement. How could he possibly stand firm, prevent himself from succumbing to the spell and agreeing against his will? How could he fight a battle that he would lose with certainty?
But Potter didn't even look up; the slender fingers stopped wiping the lenses, but nothing else happened. Was it possible that his awful words had gone unheard?
Potter looked up at Draco with a straight face. "Would you wait here until I've checked the seal is still intact?"
The change of subject met Draco unprepared, and he knew that his confusion could be read on his face. Of course, Potter didn't let go of that basement. It was his true nature. It was what had made him chase after Draco in their sixth year of school. Draco had aroused his curiosity and the urge to prove he wasn't wrong - a trait they shared; though they differed fundamentally in how far they were willing to go to get their questions answered.
Today, Potter had not only stirred his self-control, but had also shattered the hibernation of all that could destroy him inwardly to a thousand shards.
"All right." Without another word, without hesitation, Potter turned away, pushed past Draco to the back of the hallway, where the aforementioned apparatus stared out of the wall like a dark hole, and from which, on the left-hand side, the worn wooden panels of the floor turned into a broad staircase leading to a blocked passage to the second floor.
As soon as he became aware of the silence around him again, he faced rotten loneliness and closed the door behind him.
"At least I did," Draco confirmed. " You were an arsehole. Often enough, I must say. But I've always forgiven you."
The pulse-like throbbing that had gripped his entire body increased his tempo and became his torrent that paralyzed his thinking. Potter had leaned on his hands. His gaze was introspective, entranced, as if he felt the same as Draco; as if his thoughts had been erased as well. The glasses hung crooked from his nose, but he didn't care; which only made him look more wicked.
Wasn't it what he wanted when he defended himself against his parents? An entirely different experience, a different life than the one that had always been before him. "Blame yourself", he said aloud, wiping his wet eyes until they burned.
Of course, he first had to rule out simple burglars. "And why don't you use spells that tell you if someone has entered the house without permission? Except your humble self, of course," nagged Draco. Although he had struck a tone of voice that no one could misinterpret, Potter grinned boorishly and made Draco's heart flutter.
A cold shiver ran down Draco's back; Potter's dark voice and his intense gaze had captured him without him noticing. "Why would you do such a thing? I mean, it has nothing to do with you directly; Zabini probably doesn't even have any hair left of you, so..."
Well, at least he could try to take advantage of Potter's bad conscience to finally find out to what circumstance this whole circus was owed.
A shaky smile lay on his face. That he even imagined such a thing could mean either that he was slowly going crazy - or that he had come closer to the secret of the townhouse.
"And what was the point of all this? What were you planning to do in that stupid basement?" cried Draco, but his voice had already lost its rage. If he was honest with himself, he had to admit to himself that he had forgiven crossing his boundaries the very moment Potter had called his mistakes unforgivable. It felt like an act of silent rebellion against everything Potter said.
Grumbling with anger, Draco resisted the temptation to tug at his bonds so that they would cut into his arm; although physical bruises could be a great support if he ever got out of here and pressed charges against Zabini (finally, finally, finally he had him), he wasn't going to let that asshole hurt him again.
As he watched the green eyes gradually open, his heart stopped for a cruel moment, knowing that it would be over as soon as Potter saw clearly, as soon as he recognized Draco's face because how else was such magic possible than that he had forgotten where he was and whom he was kissing? Finally, something like this had to have happened; in their frenzy, the glowing mists of the spell had dissipated.
While his legs trembled in weakness, Draco just stood there, his eyes fixed on Potter's defiant expression, not knowing what he could do - or if he was even allowed to do anything. "May I?," he croaked, and when he realized he couldn't find the words he was looking for, he licked his lips helplessly. Then he allowed his knees to buckle and he sank to the ground in front of Potter.
Draco had no doubt been tormented by Potter using his easy excitability to push him past the point where his consent would have mattered, but now he couldn't tell if it wasn't disappointment that made the lava in his veins cool.
With his eyes narrowed to slits, Potter slowly approached. There was no hesitation in his movements, no question, not the slightest uncertainty. The longer hair had fallen into his face, half hiding the provocative smirk of his pink lips.
Now that Draco knew that it was Potter, that it was the scent of his hair that penetrated his nostrils, that it was himself who had bent over him, who accepted Draco's grip on the firm flesh of his buttocks, the sucking on his neck was something that erased any of Potter's past impertinence from his brain.
This almost friendly exchange of words made the hope that Potter would not hold the events against him swell up like a balloon in Draco's chest. Clearing his throat, he looked down at the dark mop of hair, regarding the impossible to tame hair whirl, without Potter taking any notice. "The first floor, including the attic, is sealed off according to my parents, but there's a strange machine at the other end of the hall that goes down to the basement, if I'm not mistaken."
"I'm acting according to the law, Malfoy," Potter blubbered, glaring at the gigantic hearth, which looked even more decrepit under the overhead light than it did in the delicate cone of Draco's wand. "You, at any rate, are obstructing official surveillance, so I would advise you to leave this place at once."
Potter flinched several times while Draco shouted his desperate contempt at him, but that didn't soothe him, couldn't, wasn't allowed to soothe him, because if he didn't finally shift the responsibility for his suffering away from himself now, he would never truly breathe again, always wondering how he could have done any better. And what he could have done to finally be happy in Potter's arms. Because at that moment he knew that this was what it would always be all about; how could he have turned this unique opportunity for sex around to bind Potter to himself - an undoubtedly pointless undertaking.
He wandered around for a bit, as he enjoyed doing. It really could be a pretty nice house once it was fully cleaned up. Most of the rooms had been de-dangerfied at least, but they were in need of a serious makeover.
Harry nodded, though he didn’t feel guilty about putting himself in danger. “I’m probably going to be doing lots more stupid and dangerous things before this war is over, Sirius.”
The dorm was empty when he went up, avoiding Ron in the common room, and just to see if it would work, he tried summoning the pillow from off his bed. With absolutely no trouble, the pillow zoomed into his hand, almost painful in its exuberance. He couldn’t help but grin, however. He could feel the power from behind his wand and in the pillow. He knew, somehow, that he wouldn’t have any more trouble with the charm.
The next day, bad news came in threes. Umbridge was made ‘High Inquisitor’ by the Ministry of Magic, Hermione said it wasn’t good. Percy sent Ron a letter basically telling him to stay away from Harry. Sirius got back to Harry through the mirrors to exchange some news. He had tried to talk to him the day before, but Sirius had been busy and asked if he could contact him later. Harry had nodded, hoping his scar hurting with Umbridge touched him wasn’t that important.
Harry suddenly realized Moody had his wand out, pointing at him, and he felt the sense of dread that he had been experiencing settle in his stomach.
When they weren’t studying or reading, they were outside, usually flying. Draco had finally healed enough that they felt safe doing that, Harry had refused to go out until Draco could too. They had never flown together, outside of a game of quidditch, and Harry was slightly surprised how much he enjoyed it. He had always loved flying, even more so than just playing quidditch. Flying with Draco was incredible.
He slept in the Hospital Wing again; he was reasonably sure Pomfrey knew he did, but they both played the game anyway.
Harry stood and walked over to him. He wasn’t overly upset, just ever so slightly annoyed, but seeing Draco like that made it melt away. “It’s alright, Draco.” He rubbed his back and led him over to their chairs. They had frequented the sofa more often, so they could cuddle, but Harry wanted to talk.
They talked for a little while longer about preparations, Hermione had thought of everything they might need, of course. The conversation turned to how the Order was doing, and Hermione asked, “speaking of which, what happened to Malfoy? They wouldn’t let us in on the meeting, and we never found out.”
“Thanks, we’ll probably be celebrating for a long time.” Harry brought Draco’s hand to his mouth for a small kiss. Draco shot him a fond look.
After Christmas, Harry had started wearing a dragon necklace. It was low on his chest, and usually covered by his shirts, but Hermione could see the same black cord around his neck, and she had seen the actual pendant when it had fallen out of his shirt. She had asked, and he said it was a Christmas gift. No more details, and he had avoided her eyes; even if he was leaning over homework at the time, it had sparked her interest. Was this a gift from the mysterious person, and was it another clue?
“Harry,” Draco said, a bit reproachfully. “I know how you’re feeling, remember? I know something’s wrong. Will you tell me?”
Long before he was ready, it was time to head down to the arena that had been set up for the task. On the way down, he ran into Draco, literally. “Watch where you’re going, Scar Head.” Draco spat, which, to Harry, meant “good luck, Sweetheart.” Draco shoved something in his hand as they passed each other.
Harry and Draco briefly argued about when Harry was to work out and if Draco should join him. They compromised again by Harry going for a run while Draco was doing research, and Draco would join him every other day. Harry figured that the exercise would help cleanse any remaining toxins from the alcohol.
“I think they have taken over my mission.” Draco said slowly. “I think they have taken over fixing the vanishing cabinet.”
“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter? So, tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” His trademark sneer was in place, and it set something off in Harry.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Kreature startle and straighten in interest. He turned to look at him, Draco following suit.
“Father, didn’t you invest heavily in the Visiomagic company?” Came Draco’s drawling voice from further down the row.
Harry and Draco stared rather blankly at Kreacher, surprise the only emotion on their faces. “Kreacher…I don’t know what to say.”
Cedric shook his head. “Well, I was hoping I could write to you over the summer, maybe we could meet up and go out sometime?”
“Anywhere. The Weasley’s, the Leaky Cauldron, my manor would be preferable. Anywhere, so long as you’re safe.”
It was hard to shake. He never wanted to see something like that. He needed to talk to Sirius about it, but the truth was he was afraid of confronting him about it. He didn’t want that confirmed, didn’t want to hear the excuses, didn’t want that image he had of his father to go away.
The meeting concluded once they were done introducing themselves. Harry was surprised at how long it took."
“Here, Babe.” Harry brought the potion over to Draco first, who took a small sniff without opening his eyes, smiled slightly and took a small gulp.
“You know what?” Harry jumped up. “You two talk, I’m going to go talk to Sirius, see what we have so far, and we’ll talk in a bit. I’ll see you later.” Hermione started hissing at Ron before he was out of earshot. He shook his head.
After he had covered every line of red, he started bandaging. He was as gentle as he could be, occasionally looking up at Draco’s face to make sure he wasn’t causing any additional turmoil. He wasn’t sure why there was such a look of adoration on his face.
“You did? I didn’t know you were gay!” Harry felt kinship with his godfather swell. He could use the distraction, and he was sure Draco could too. He hadn’t met any males interested in other males other than Draco.
Draco sighed and leaned his head close to Harry’s. “I don’t want to come between you and your friends, Sweetheart. This is all very new to them, and I understand why they don’t trust me. Let’s just meet when you can.”
He and Draco were spending most of their time together studying. Draco was a great study partner. He made games out of revision and Harry actually had fun. It seemed that whatever they did, as long as they were together, it was a good day.
“No, there’s still wards preventing just anyone from entering. Someone already allowed inside would have to pull the other inside the wards, like you did with Draco at your parents’ house. But Snape would be able to tell them to go to Grimmauld Street and hang out.”
“There’s no chance for us, is there?” Ginny asked, sounding more resigned than anything. “I really thought there was something between us, but I guess I must have imagined it.”
Voldemort had placed an experimental tracking spell on him. It was imperfect, still in the testing stages, and he was the perfect guinea pig. It was a snake, or the outline of one, that would slither around the skin of his body and listen. It had been instructed to catch any phrases related to if Draco talked about his mother, killing Dumbledore, or that Voldemort had any plan at all. “Not to worry,” Voldemort had told Draco, “your social and romantic life shall not suffer. It cannot hear anything else. It is an experiment, and once I have perfected it, it shall become the original spell for any Dark Lord wanting his followers to follow tasks set unto them.” The snake was instructed to bite the skin of the one it was attached to if he didn’t follow his orders. It was connected to another serpentine collar around Narcissa’s wrist.
Harry let him leave but turned to Draco to ask permission to leave him alone. Draco nodded before Harry could say anything and gave him a kiss. Harry followed Sirius to the garage, where Sirius was climbing on his motorcycle. The roar of the engine drowned out Harry calling his name. Harry watched him drive off, concerned. Sirius was rarely one to let things get him down, and he wasn’t entirely sure what would make him upset. He had hidden his face when Harry first told him about the marriage, was he truly not in favor of that?
Harry couldn’t stand that, so he did what Draco wanted, and moved so he was encased in Draco’s arms. “Anything you want, anything in the world, is yours. I will do anything to make it up to you, not that I ever will.”
He could hear the whispers of the attackers, planning what they would do next. One of them wanted to go get backup, and that just couldn’t happen. He took out that one first, then the other while he was still trying to figure out where Harry was.
Ron and Hermione both wrote him vague letters describing their summers so far, but Harry could tell there was a lot unsaid. He was just as allusive, not mentioning Draco or his own whereabouts, lest the letter be intercepted.
Harry nodded, wondering if there was a spell to hide things. He didn’t want the Dursleys to take his new clothes. He watched as Draco left, his mother’s hand on his shoulder leading him out.
“Draco’s Father didn’t appreciate our friendship, so it’s very important that you not tell anyone about us. It could lead to him being punished, and trust me, a lot worse. I know you don’t want any student harmed.” Harry added.
He was seen, however. Hagrid was just leaving with Professor Moody when he tapped Hagrid on the shoulder and the two made a beeline for their table. “How’s that essay comin’, Malfoy?” Hagrid said loudly, bending down towards the table.
Harry blushed, thanked Sirius again, and brought the presents to his room. He locked the door, not that he thought Sirius would enter without his permission, he just wanted the feeling of security, and set the presents on his bed.
“Even so, Death Eaters consider it a high honor to do something for Voldemort, he doesn’t trust his plans with just anyone.”
Hermione sighed and shook his head. “I don’t think he is.” They kept arguing about it, Harry refusing to concede.
Sirius turned from him, taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. Harry waited, hoping there wouldn’t be too much of an explosion. It didn’t come. After a couple beats, Sirius turned back and gave Harry his best try at a smile.
When they finally left the room, it was with melancholy. It had been a wonderful day, because they had spent it together, but he wished it could have gone on.
Draco leaned forward until his lips were amost touching Harry’s. “Because yu’re the world’s best man.”
“We’ve been here a lot longer than I thought. Ron’s probably worried. I should—” He jerked his head in the direction of the door.
“That’s ridiculous! How are people supposed to defend themselves if they don’t know he’s back? This is bad, Harry, Fudge has a lot of power, he can make people do things, say what he wants. I’m afraid of what will happen if he doesn’t come out and tell the truth.”
He moved forward at the voice’s insistence. There were doors in the way, but they didn’t matter. Not that one. Not that one. Not that one either. There, that one. That was what he needed. He moved forward again.
Lucius Malfoy ended up stomping his way out the front door less than an hour later. He briefly came in the Great Hall; Harry stood in front of Draco, glaring him down. He only looked at the both of them before saying, “this isn’t over,” and sweeping out again. Harry felt himself release a breath and along with it, some of his tension.
He stood there, waves of horror crashing down upon him, and Trelawney didn’t even realize what she had done. He raced up to Dumbledore’s office, leaving her there, where he confronted Dumbledore.
Dumbledore nodded, then turned to Hermione. “Ms. Granger,” he said gravely. “Do you understand the gravity of what you have done?”
“It’s just me,” Draco whispered from under the cloak. Harry nodded, and Draco removed his hand from Harry’s mouth. It was late, well after curfew, and Harry was in his hospital bed. It was later, after he had been rescued from Moody by Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape. After he had been led to Dumbledore’s office, gone to the hospital wing, and told the Weasleys that Voldemort had returned. After the first time he had woken up to find the Minister yelling. Sirius had been following him since they had met up in Dumbledore’s office. He was now at the foot of Harry’s bed in dog form, and Draco had very cautiously woken Harry.
"Zabini," Draco hissed, suppressing the urge to spit. Disgusted, he noted the wince from Potter's body. "After all you've done, you dare ambush me here and tie me up? You dare to go around breaking into other people's houses disguised in Potter's flesh? And what is the point of all this? After all, you've already ...
He knew that no one in his family had ever touched these things and that the picture in his memory would be the same that he was now fading out; his parents thought to employ human servants was a risky practice that opened the door to thieves.
Potter's crotch to his own felt closer than expected, and Draco guessed what Potter had done before he released his skin from the clasp of his hot lips to look down on him - and indeed. Sometime between exploring the basement and Potter's renewed approach, he had completely exposed himself under his cloak.
"Go on," growled Draco. "How bad can the answer be?" To shield his heart from excitement, he crossed his arms in front of his chest.
Harry's hand snapped into the hair at the back of his head without Draco even noticing how it had gotten there; he dragged it forward and pressed their lips together hard. "I can't leave anymore," he said gruffly into her kiss and Draco smiled against his will.
Potter's tongue painted a burning path on his lips, which he blurred again with his kiss, and as Draco wondered how to bear it, how to live with the fact that something so tender could trigger a desire to grind against the other body and tear his clothes, Potter began tugging at Draco's lower lip with his teeth. Each touch in itself triggered a heated throbbing inside him, only to connect there and make him burn up in their power to the fullest.
As he dragged Potter down, the horrible cloak stretched for only a second, and with a tug, the front button panel tore open. But Draco didn't care; Potter sat on him, the warmth of his body seeping into Draco's lap, forcing him to drag him even closer.
Draco picked up his wand from the ground, then walked past Potter and headed for the freight elevator. Now it was no longer his life at stake; no longer the fear of whatever was lurking in the darkness of the old house. By now, Draco would have been fine if that something tore his head off, because it couldn't be worse than what Potter had done.
The bowl also looked like one of those works of art that he despised. The mermaid's breast, normally bare in the real world, was covered with green fish scales, so as not to hurt any feeling of shame. In the world of his parents, there was a principle that deeply offended Draco's off-tastes anyway: the more prudish the art, the greater the demand, and the more expensive it was to be traded. But in the middle of a dark hallway, heavily hung with immobile portraits of grim old people from another time, it looked like cheapest junk.
Potter rumbled reluctantly and writhed on the floor as if he wanted to turn and stand up, but obviously he called himself to his senses and just put his cheek on his hand. As if Draco himself would last much longer.
He was so indescribably tight and hot and Draco knew that he was now moaning Potter's name and that he had dug bloody craters into the white flesh on his hip and that he would cum on the spot if he would just tense up like that again -
"No, Malfoy, you don't understand -" Potter interrupted him and involuntarily rubbed his bright red ears, which shone out of the thick black hair.
With his fingernails drilled into the scalp around his ears, Draco flinched, and an unconscious sadness flooded into his chest, making him feel like he was going to start crying and puking any moment if Potter didn't leave immediately. "Now shut your mouth," yelled Draco. "Just once in your shitty life! Get the fuck out of here!"
How betrayed he felt by his own body, his own lust! That's exactly how it had been when Zabini had wriggled in front of him, in his transformed body, his true intentions  poorly hidden behind the wrong lenses. And just like then, something primeval controlled his reactions and banished his own consciousness to the back of the grandstand, unable to do anything about the stirring spectacle.
Zabini would never have given in like this. He was a puppet master, using his hands to thread his counterpart into a stuffy, dull listlessness, making them dance in an outrageous way that cost the victim not only all dignity, but also all his secrets.
It wasn't the wide grin on the pale face that worried Draco, but the mere fact that Potter had taken advantage of his carelessness.
As cold shackles snaked around his wrists and pinned his arms to the chair, he gasped and snapped his eyes open. Heart pounding wildly, he searched the room for a poltergeist or other dark attacker, but there was only Potter, pointing his wand at Draco.
As he staggered against him, Draco was finally able to shake off the knowledge that it was merely Zabini, merely an adversary demanding the unthinkable of him. His heated face met Potter's skin, his dry lips found the same rosy soft lips he had cursed so many times before. It was Potter's upper body that he pushed back with his own.
Draco wanted to say no and opened his mouth, but instead a question dripped out that had the power to shatter the fragile intimacy - albeit created by calculation - between them to pieces all at once. "How can you kiss me just to get into this cursed basement?"
Then he pushed open the door and stared into a narrow, dark hallway. Dust whirled up in the cold glow of light that the dying day squared past its outline onto the floor. He quickly held the cool sleeve of his shirt in front of his nose and blinked until he saw the outline of an ancient chest of drawers, steeped in history, that stood on the wall between two passages into the parlor. A marble bust stood on top of it, appearing unreal in the half-light. He remembered this piece because it scared him as a child. It looked at him from its smooth, dead eyes, a lazy, knowing smile on its lips. Draco grimaced and wondered why such a person should be immortalized in marble because he had to suppress the need to blow it up with a spell.
"Then say it, goddamn it! What is it now? What is it that I don't understand?" From effort not to approach Potter and to bury his fingers in his hair; to shake him until the truth slipped out of him, he clawed his fingers into the sleeves of his shirt.
"My instructor did not send me here," Potter continued his apology and sighed. Although the sentence echoed empty and meaningless in Draco's head, he continued speaking. "The files clearly stated that it was
"From now on I'm no longer your problem, father", he whispered into the darkness and groped for the wand in the silk breast pocket of the shirt. His pounding heartbeat interweaved with the emptiness, making it seem as if the rotten corpse of the house had started to rumble around him.
Potter pulled the glasses off his nose and hesitated. Apparently he had wanted to clean them on his sleeve, as he so often did, forgetting that his cloak lay on the floor as an ugly, lime-green puddle. Without putting them back on, he pulled his eyebrows together. "There's no excuse for that," he said roughly, and without Draco wanting it, this strangely rousing sound created goose bumps on his back. "There is none and there never will be. God, how can one make so many unforgivable mistakes in a single day?" He closed his eyes in agony and sighed tremulously.
Without further hesitation, his gaze slipped from the striped wallpaper to Potter; and suddenly he no longer knew what he had feared to see, for there was nothing about it that could even be traced back to a nightmare. Potter did not look at him. The hazy gaze focused on the action of his own hand, his teeth buried in his lower lip, he looked as if this was a more pleasurable part of his secret plan, and a painful lump formed in Draco's throat.
The smile on his face turned too dark to convince Draco of the friendly pitch he had adopted - if he disregarded the fact that this rhetorical ploy was, of course, completely transparent, so obvious that Draco had to stifle a laugh. This bumbling approach, probably intended to make him feel he wasn't being blackmailed in the first place and was choosing to cooperate on his own, diluted his fear.
The recognition sent an icy chill down Draco's spine. The way he strung together the snottily uttered words, in Potter's appearance at that - how could it have taken him so long to see through that unspeakable costume?
It was one of the sounds that had taught him to fear this house, and Draco waited for swirling thoughts that would make it impossible for him to escape or even to defend himself, for the booming panic that would rob him of his ability to breathe, but this time, nothing but astonishment came over him; that he had actually not imagined these strange acoustic phenomena - after all this time of not wanting to believe his own ears.
Like Potter, he almost closed his eyes to drown in the engulfing sensation, but the perfection of Potter's blurry face so close to his own forced him to look and take in as much of the moment as he was capable of. Draco's breath came in jerks, and his stomach tightened as he gazed at the long, black lashes. Torn, he wondered if the wizarding world was even aware that Potter wasn't just their savior; he was a demon lurking beneath the kind, benevolent facade, tearing anyone who fell for it into a thousand deaths of rapture and devotion; weaving a magical spell just by the excruciatingly ravishing shade of red of the smooth skin of his cheeks or the mesmerizing curve of his surprisingly soft lips, and he wished he could see them move on his mouth and invisible sparks of arousal streak across it; just so he could truly believe it.
Potter made no sound and seemed to hold his breath, his face tense but not distorted in agony. Fingernails dug into the skin on Draco's wrists. It didn't hurt, but it made him wish Potter would dig as deep into his flesh as he could, so he wouldn't pour into his tight butt - so he could hold out, hold out, until Potter gave up this ridiculous attempt.
The smirk on Draco's face became a grimace that not only took effort to maintain, but downright pained him. "And you do?" snapped Draco, though he didn't feel like it.
As if in slow motion, both grains of dust and shreds of rust floated in the air and enveloped the device like a dome, while the magic continued its work. Drop by drop, the molten iron pushed itself back to its place of origin. Though Draco had never intended to cast this spell in such a house, he paused and watched as the elevator restored itself.
Instead of answering, Potter slid closer to Draco on his knees, over his outstretched legs, almost sitting on his lap. Then he raised one hand to the back of Draco's head, threaded his fingers through his hair and pressed his earlobe against heated lips, which parted and began to gently suck it in. Analogous to the lust that unexpectedly branched off through his body, a long, deep groan escaped him, driving a blush of shame on his cheeks.
Suddenly it creaked as if something had moved in the shadows of the house. The wind began to whistle the windows and Draco, whose hands were frozen on his cheeks in the movement, suppressed the urge to jump up and snap his wand.
He paused again, leaving space and time for the pressing question to expand until it filled it. And what if he didn't; what if he stumbled out and went back home? He traced the subtle swing of his mother's satisfied smile, which would embrace and kiss him, whether he wanted to or not, glad to postpone his unruly attitude towards her plans.
Potter did not answer. He stared at Draco's cock, the tip of which was already shining wet, reached out his hand involuntarily, and the sight alone was enough to make Draco's crotch contract. It would not have needed the touch, the coarse tugging at his penis that was so contrary to the almost careful groping earlier that Draco pressed his hands on Potter's hips and pulled him closer.
Slowly he leaned forward to look into the hall and held his breath. He couldn't see anything more unwelcome than his parents' conservative art collection, yet the restless feeling condensed into a premonition.
In the past, he had always been so talented at riding on other people's mistakes but on that day, staring at Potter's slender back, wrapped in a powerful spell that connected everything on this floor, it no longer seemed important to him.
"It's not possible, no," Potter replied soundlessly and stroked his index finger through the dust on the floor between them. At first, it looked unintentionally as if he was lost in thought, but he seemed to slowly approach Draco's knee. "But I might make him pay for it." Suddenly, the compelling force of Potter's gaze rested on him again and Draco drew in his breath sharply. "Polyjuice Potion has been awfully easy to brew lately, you know. As an Auror, you also learn to defend yourself without a wand. That," he paused and stroked with his fingertips light as a feather over Draco's knees, "I thought it was a joke at first, but unlike magic, fists only leave traces on the body."
The cold voice bubbled over his mind and penetrated his chest with a grim determination. "As I expected, Draco. You don't want to meet your parents' expectations, but the price of your rebelliousness is just too high for you. A weakling through and through, you are and will remain. It is hideous, I am ashamed of you. Get into your room!"
He helplessly dug his fingers into Potter's cloak, sucked himself up somewhere on his chest, rubbed himself hopelessly against the naked body, and watched as he pushed the penis against his hip with his own desperate movements. He slipped aside from Draco's shirt and suddenly Potter braced himself against his clasping hands.
These were snapshots that had imprinted themselves irremovably in his brain and haunted him as if they had been key scenes in his life so far; and by Merlin's snake, in a way, they were. They always carried the wretched feeling of surrender, but at the same time they were riddled with guilt. He had given in to Zabini's lures without a moment's hesitation.
Without taking his hand off his knee, Potter briefly averted his gaze and interrupted the sensory spell he seemed to have cast on Draco. Confused, Draco pulled his eyebrows together. Had he alienated or even hurt him when he had refused the offer?
Careful still to maintain an appearance of impenetrable superiority, Draco raised an eyebrow and groaned in boredom. In contrast to his façade, however, he was impressed by the power Potter exuded. Sometime between their school days, the end of the Dark Lord, and his training as an Auror, he had lost the clumsiness and shed all childishness. But that intimidating appearance that many adult wizards possessed wasn't it alone. There was something lurking in his movements, in the way he tensed his chest, tightened his shoulders, pierced him with his gaze. The hand that had now raised the wand again was free of trembling and quivering.
Of course, he had known that his grandfather Abraxas Malfoy, the former owner of the house, had not used this room. There had been enough ways, wizard or not, to get fresh, cooked food without ever letting yourself down making it. Even long after his grandmother passed away, long after the entire servants were released. But letting a good room deteriorate appeared shameful to him now that he would have to deal with it himself.
The only problem was the sand. It was moist and sticky. Harry wanted to throw Draco down, but having the sand on his knees was bad enough, he didn’t want it anywhere more sensitive. Harry pulled Draco up and spread his legs, pounding up into him as he wrapped his hand around to stroke him. Draco whimpered out Harry’s name as he hit a delicate spot and enclosed his arms behind him to Harry.
true. It was true that he missed eating in the Great Hall, and attending his classes, hanging out with his friends in the Common Room…but what he missed most, what he really needed was Harry.
“Er, it may have been my bedroom, at the time.” Draco let out a small breath, like a whisper and closed his eyes. He withdrew his hand from Harry’s to hold his head in his hands, leaning forward, his elbows on his knees. Harry felt sick. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I –”
Harry climbed into the chair, leg on either side of Draco, facing him. Draco moaned and hugged him close.
“Oh, really?” Hermione nodded confidently. “And how much luck have you had?” Hermione deflated at that while Ron puffed up as he did when trying to prove himself.
He folded the wrapping paper, very relieved he hadn’t ripped it. Then, he got dressed before he raced to the girl’s dormitories. All the girls had gone home for the holidays, and he didn’t run into anyone as he entered the sixth-year girl’s dorms. He figured out which bed belonged to Pansy quickly, the embroidered double P’s on everything was a giveaway. He rooted through her bedside drawer until he found what he was looking for.
“You wouldn’t understand, Scar-Head. Let me go.” Draco pulled once on his arm, but it wasn’t very strong.
I find that.” Harry couldn’t have spoken if he wanted to. “You are the exact height that makes hugging you wonderful, and I can wrap my arms around you perfectly. I happen to quite like your knees, they look like cauliflower, which I quite enjoy. I think I’ll nibble on them someday to see how good they taste. And, you are the strongest person I know, your muscles can’t ever reflect just how much, no matter how much you work out. Besides, it’s you. I’d probably find you attractive no matter what you looked like. It’s the beauty that shines from the inside that makes you as a whole so beautiful. I didn’t realize just how bright and intense that beauty was until now.” Something had to be wrong with Harry’s heart. It was doing all kinds of weird things, he couldn’t even keep track of it. His eyes stung a little, it was distracting.
“Your Father was a Death Eater.” It was a statement, not a question, and a cold front seemed to engulf the room. Harry was surprised he couldn’t see his breath in front of him.
“Is it really that big of a difference?” Harry wondered, suddenly contemplating how he was coming across if Draco was surprised he was smiling.
Harry leaned forward as well, but just said, “What, and ruin the surprise? Don’t worry, you’ll like it.”
Draco raised his eyebrow. “Well, it’s quite apparent you want Potter expelled, Minister. I was just trying to make that happen.” Umbridge and Fudge appeared outraged.
“Must be a defect in the bottles,” Draco drawled. “Unless, of course, the drinks themselves want a piece of Potter. What, that was a compliment!” He added to Mandy, who had given him a warning look.
“Be my guest.” He squirted the liquid in a stream and Harry spread it before popping the cock in his mouth. He moaned. He loved how Draco tasted without any help, but it was nice to have variety. He only got a minute or two before Draco was pulling him back. “It's been a while, Sweetheart. Give me a taste.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth turned up. “I love you too. Happy Valentine’s Day.” They shared a slow, sweet kiss, and Draco looked at least a bit happier.
Draco tried to comfort Harry as best as he could, but it was rather trying, considering he felt badly himself.
“I believe it,” said Harry worriedly. “You’ll let me know if you need anything, won’t you? Anything at all.”
“So that our wedding day will be 6-8-97.” Draco looked away, still blushing as he leaned against the table next to Harry. “I, um, did some research, and your parents were married on 8-6-79. I…thought you might like that.”
“They’re finished in crystal, or something. I’m not entirely sure why, but the sales guy said they were special.”
He placed it down in confusion before opening the package and freezing. He was too stunned to even blush. Inside was a package that advertised a giant purple dildo and strawberry flavored lube.
Harry was busy thinking about Draco. There was something weird about this morning that he just couldn’t put his finger on. It was strange that Madam Pomfrey wasn’t around, after a moment, he dismissed that; it wasn’t what was giving him the weird feeling. It had to be something about Draco. Harry had never climbed into bed with him, but that wasn’t it either. He frowned around his fork, holding it in his mouth and thinking, going over every detail of his body. Had Draco been breathing a little differently? Harry was almost certain he had been, but what did that mean?
“If we wait just a couple minutes, the ritual will be stronger. Let’s walk back in front of the house, I want to remember where we do this. Do you remember everything you’re supposed to say and do?” Harry nodded. “Good, because once we start, we can’t stop to talk, so any questions before we start?”
I think I'm done with edits-for now- but a couple changes will be coming to 5th and 6th year, so if you want to reread everything in one go, you might want to wait a couple days (it's 8/1 now), but if you just want to read the new content, I say go for it. If you don't want to read any of it, that's cool too. Whatever makes you happy.
Harry came forward through the crowd of scarlet Gryffindors, pushing people aside to get to her. “Here!” He yelled over the noise and thrusted the cup towards her. “Our best chaser deserves a minute!”
Previously: " Draco kissed his neck, and Harry let sleep overtake him as he listened to the opening words of Disenchanted 2. "
“Then explain it to me, please!” Draco looked down at his hands, not answering. Harry gave him a minute, then slowly reached out to place his hand over both of Draco’s. Draco flinched, his hands twitching away, before resuming their place. Draco looked up and met Harry’s eyes. Harry looked back, begging him with his eyes as the two stared at each other.
Unless Harry was very much mistaken, Lupin looked like he was fighting a smile as his eyes roved over Harry’s messed up hair and slightly swollen lips. Harry tried to look as innocent and relaxed as possible, but he was reasonably sure he wasn’t pulling it off.
He dodged to the side and they disconnected. Oh, this was so weird, now. They stared at each other, neither knowing what to say. Thankfully, there was an interruption.
"I can’t wait for summer to be over. You know, maybe we can meet up at Diagon again, or get a private hotel room somewhere.”
He threw the orb as hard as he could to the ground. It burst into a million pieces at his cold feet, a ghostly figure rising from the shatters. She began speaking in a high-pitched, harsh voice, Voldemort was still screaming, there was so much noise, Voldemort raised his wand, and Harry fully awoke as a spell headed straight to him.
“…Oh?” Something was happening. His brain was suddenly operating on minimum capacity as a fog came over his brain. That had to be a hint, it just had to be. What did he do? Did Draco want him to kiss him? Ask him out? Maybe try to hold his hand? Flirt back, using his metaphor?
“I loved it!” Draco threw over his shoulder. Harry laughed in relief again, he could hear Sirius laughing as well as he tried to catch up again.
Harry heard wobbling and buzzing in his ears but was unable to focus on anything but Pettigrew. Sounds came around him, but they made no sense, not until he heard, “…Sirius Black?” and his head shot up.
“I do too. I just have an urge to ask you if you have any siblings.” They both laughed, several heads turned in their direction and they quieted down, shushing each other.
“See that you don’t. You are dismissed until you are called.” Kreature bowed once again, for once not saying anything, and popped out of the room again. Harry raised a brow at Draco. He didn’t hold much sympathy for Kreature, but he wasn’t exactly much more than a nuisance either.
Just like when he had saved Draco during the second task, it would only take surfacing to get him animated again.
“No. I swear, I looked everywhere. Couldn’t find her anywhere. Any ideas?” They both shook their heads, looking more sympathetic.
“Well, first off, you were correct about the Ministry. I’m fine, but Death Eaters tried to kidnap me right from the building, in front of everyone.” Harry and Draco both gasped, and Sirius nodded. “I didn’t think it was going to be this bad this quickly. So, I won’t be going back any time soon.”
A tingle on his wrist signaled the gold bands being embedded on his skin. It was far from painful, but he looked down in fascination. It was about the width of his pinky, thicker than he would have guessed. He loved the idea that he had a permanent fixture on his body. A ring was lovely, and he knew he would wear it constantly, but he could think of instances where he would take it off to protect it. With what was essentially a tattoo, he wouldn’t have to worry about it or take it off.
Everything went back to normal, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione began fighting more than they ever had and Harry used the opportunity to sneak off and meet Draco. That was going very well. They really had a lot of fun when they were together, even if they talked about the most mundane things. Draco had a real talent for making him happy.
“This is just like you, Malfoy.” He said. “You’re always trying to get me expelled. What’s the matter? Stakes too high, now?” Everyone was looking at him. If there was one thing, he and Draco were good at, publicly at least, it was fighting.
They walked up to each other and stood about a foot apart, neither knowing what to say. Harry looked around, he figured they were alone, but what he wanted to talk to him about shouldn’t be said out in the open. “May I speak to you, privately?”
Harry examined Draco’s foot carefully, making sure there were no obvious injuries, and Draco had a moment of thankfulness that he had Harry. His long, dark lashes brushed against the lens of his glasses when he blinked, and Draco felt himself fall even more in love with him.
The other players realized the game wasn’t going to end before it began, and started playing, though more people than normal were paying attention to the two seekers, who were doing nothing but watching the game and commenting quietly to each other. They were careful not to let on any sort of affection or even amicability, their stories already concocted.
She gestured to Luna to continue, and Harry jolted at realizing he would have to be next. He wasn’t sure what to say.
No one had ever told him they were proud of him, and Harry hadn’t realized that he had missed it until just then.
It was all so confusing, and it gave Hermione headaches. She wasn’t proud of this, but she had said that Ginny might have a chance with Harry if she moved on, or pretended to, and a part of her did it to see how Harry would react to her. She felt horrible about it, and regretted it, but it was good advice. Ginny had started dating Michael Corner, and had instructed Hermione to inform Harry, then tell her how he reacted. Harry couldn’t have cared less, but she didn’t tell that to Ginny.
“Remus.” Harry whispered, and he wasn’t entirely sure he had said it, but Sirius pushed air out of his nose, barely making a sound.
“Because I didn’t realize just how truly beautiful you are.” A dark pit fell into Harry’s stomach as his heart skipped a beat and his eyes closed to avoid the look in Draco’s eyes.
