"I need help," Malfoy had whispered, his eyes over-bright, his face pale. "Potter... there's no-one else... I can't do this any more..."
The youngest Malfoy had born into his calling - given a destiny even before Harry had been given his. Submit yourself. You body, your mind, your life, everything... to the Dark Lord. No room for error. No second chances. Serve the Dark Lord faithfully and watch his empire grow.
Harry could remember their first kiss. In the astronomy tower of course - wasn't that where all memorable first kisses happened? It was late January and bitingly cold. They had taken thick, warming blankets up to the top of the tower and sat underneath an unbroken stretch of dark sky, cold with distantly scattered stars. Harry found himself edging closer and closer and eventually resting his head against Draco's thin shoulder as he talked. About his childhood, about his first meeting with the Dark Lord. Afterwards Harry told of his own first encounter with Voldemort - and when he had finished there was nothing but silence between them for a long time, a silence somehow comfortable and fraught with tension at the same time. Eventually Harry had lifted his head to Draco, and Draco had leaned down to capture Harry's lips in a soft, hesitant kiss.
When the day came, the one day of the month he was allowed into Azkaban, Harry made his way through dark stone corridors with a determined and aching heart. Ron and Hermione followed, playing the supportive escorts. He barely knew they were there.
"I've missed you so much," he whispered, gritting his teeth against the tears, burying his face in Draco's neck, in his hair. They spent wordless minutes like that, wanting to say everything but not daring to waste precious seconds. There was no need to say anything. They both knew.
"I don't understand it, Harry. I don't trust him. I don't know why... but I can see that you're happy, with him. Please just be careful."
The two boys lay silent in each other's arms, and for the first time in months, they were smiling.
to understand," he mumbled, his face buried in the fabric of Draco's shirt, his eyes closed and burning.
Harry lived at the Burrow, spent his time waiting for the next visiting day, surrounded by the love and laughter of the Weasley home but feeling none of it's warmth penetrate him. The twins told him jokes and Mrs. Weasley fed him nourishing meals but every smile felt like a betrayal, every mouthful felt like he was turning his back on Draco and his suffering. He stopped eating.
The day that Draco Malfoy was convicted for being a Death Eater had been the worst day of Harry Potter's life.
Harry had of course agreed to help him. And over the next month or two it all came pouring out of Draco - the loneliness, the fear, the inescapable destiny. Harry had identified with all of it. Strange how two completely opposite people could share so much.
Ron was less accepting, of course. Too much had passed between him and Draco for them to ever lay their enmity aside. Harry had caught him muttering to Hermione a month later about how he had been replaced by
He was allowed to visit, once a month. One day out of thirty he was allowed to spend half an hour with the boy he loved, watching him smile valiantly for Harry's sake as they sat on the freezing stone floor, hands clasped. Listening to him mumble that eventually he would be freed, one day they would be together. Harry knew he did not believe it. Draco wasted away in prison, underfed and abused, and there was nothing Harry could do to save him. They shared a desperate kiss when Harry departed and it made his heart scream to know he was leaving Draco there in the cold and the dark, afraid and alone.
Then, finally, finally, he left on the fifth Monday. Harry almost leapt off his bed and apparated to the market he went to on the other side of town. He thought about it for a second, but couldn't focus on the logic. All he could see was Draco's panic and fear. All he wanted to do was take him home and tell him everything was going to be alright. So Harry apparated and went into the store. He didn't see Harry right away and Harry thought of running out before he does. Just as the thought crossed his mind, a fist collided with the side of his face.
The brunette barely had time to acknowledge what the blonde had said before Draco was suddenly falling and Harry acted on instinct, catching the unconscious blonde in his arms before he hit the ground.
The blonde ran to the fireplace, calling Hermione immediately. No answer. She must be at St. Mungo’s as well. He needed to get to Harry, to understand the situation. He couldn’t just sit here doing nothing! Draco got up and rummaged through every cabinet in the kitchen, looking for the disguise potions the brunette had left him when he went on his mission. He took one, not even wincing at the painful transformation, and raced out of the house only to discover he didn’t know the way. He needed to stop muggles and ask them where the place was.
A noise registered in the back of Draco’s mind and he pulled his mouth off of Harry’s cock, trying to tune back into the world for a moment.
Harry smiled proudly as he began to jerk Draco off, “And yet you like me anyways.”
All of Harry’s energy was focused in on being good for Draco, on taking his cock no matter how hard Draco fed it to him, on swallowing down every last drop of come that he was sure Draco would release down his throat.
“Glad to hear it. Now does Ron treat you the same way I treat you? Or even close to it?”
“What?”
A few days had gone by, and already Draco knew he was almost done with his change. He left Harry, promising to return in a few hours, to visit his mother outside for tea in their gardens. Harry, who had been writing a letter to Hermione, nodded. He felt guilty enough as it was about taking up all of Draco’s time.
Would they stay friends? Would they continue to live together? Or would Draco leave him with the baby? Maybe he'd just kick Harry out. The thought was unthinkable to him at the moment. He just couldn't handle that right now.
‘Harry-
Draco woke up to a gentle rubbing on his stomach and opened his eyes to one of the most wonderful sights he had ever seen.
The two left with a decidedly ungodly amount of sweets tucked into large bags the two carried back up to the castle. An owl flew by overhead, just a large streak of brown soaring through the air to the owlery.
"Harry? Harry, wake up." The brunet opened his eyes and stared at Draco for a good five minutes before taking a calming breath.
“Yes?”
"It's just...I've had to live with it since I was eleven. It's a long time." The next thing Harry knew, he was falling asleep to an old lullabye that Severus used to sing to him late at night after he would have a nightmare. The next thing he remembered was the song ending and picking up again before ending a little while later, as he was being put inside his bed.
He had gotten really good at telling time by the location of the sun. For instance, it was about ten in the morning, and Harry’s cousin would be waking up in two hours. He just had to hope that maybe Petunia had made herself lunch early today…
By ten at night, Draco had all of the spell incantations and movements memorized. And to his delight, he could perform most of them successfully.
“That’s right. Now be a good boy and I’ll make it worth your while at dinner.”
He just didn't understand Shakespeare's wording very well.
After another two days of Draco writing apology letters to everyone he could think of that deserved an apology from him, Harry finally had quieted down. His movements were much slower, and were happening less frequently now. His brow was no longer furrowed as drastically, but a hint of pain still lingered on his face. Narcissa and her son were hopeful that they were nearing the end.
"That's enough, we don't want it too big for the oven." Laughing good-naturedly, Harry took the dough and put all of the toppings of a supreme pizza.
They graduated Hogwarts with flying colors, both of them getting top grades in all their classes. They decided to decline various offers for jobs and just enjoy each other and the time that they had. Travelling the world on extended holidays seemed like heaven to them.
"Harry, I believe that I could be happy with you. And I certainly don't plan on being the only one affected by sleepless nights. Look, I think this could work. It'll take a lot of work after hating each other so thoroughly when we were young, but it's not impossible. Is your offer still open?" Harry, not knowing what else to do, nodded.
“What do you mean by program?”
They had full body massages first, wanting to be completely relaxed for everything else that they'd be doing that afternoon. Following that was a haircut for the both of them, Draco just getting a trim and Harry cutting off at least three inches and obtaining a shaggy hair look similar to Draco's but not quite the same. He noticed that Harry had been quite nervous during this part and made a mental note to never go towards the man with a pair of shears ever.
He spent a very long time trying to send words instead of pictures. It wasn’t until almost two hours later that he had gotten back a shocked feeling from Draco. The message was clear-Draco had heard Harry. It was difficult with the pain, but they had managed to work their way up to sending a sentence at a time.
Lucius skipped forward a few pages.
“Because we have an image to upkeep and traditions to withhold. Now, on to the courting rules…” She went on for some time about appropriate dates, rules for public outings, and so on until Draco was convinced his ears would bleed. Until, that is, she said something that made his ears tune in.
Why he felt it, he had no idea but he wasn’t exactly in a great position to dissect it right now.
“Actually, yes. I...you see...I made a bit of a joke earlier and I wasn’t sure how it would land but it seemed to be fine. Same type of joke I’d make with anyone else. But I’m not sure how I feel about it since it was Harry I made the joke to.”
Draco surprised him, coming back just as hard with an image of Harry riding him and biting through the flesh in his neck to drink to his heart’s content. Suddenly, white hot passion ripped through them both and Harry arched off his bed as he came harder than he ever had.
After a delicious meal, consisting of a very fresh fruit salad and strawberry lemonade, Draco got into his crimson silk pajama pants and settled down to practice more spells.
It wasn’t long after that Harry ended up pregnant. The two of them were overjoyed when their daughter finally arrived and doted on her like she was the only thing in the world that mattered to them.
“Is this all?” Harry nodded, suddenly wondering if most people had more than one trunk or if it was just a wealthy thing. Mr. Malfoy held out his arm for Harry to take and with a sudden squeeze through what felt like a straw, they were standing in front of a huge and incredibly impressive manor.
And what's more disturbing, Draco noticed that the more he saw, the less Harry's friends paid attention to him.
Draco was still there, a constant presence that kept Harry from panicking and backing out the last minute. He knew that he needed to do this, and he was grateful for the other man being there. It meant that he couldn't leave, no matter how hard this got to be on his nerves. And somehow, he suspected that Draco would help him out later with the pain that these new lies would bring upon his heart and conscious.
“You looked cold.” Draco shrugged and pointed to the other side of the window ledge. “Can I join you?” Harry nodded and Draco climbed up, letting their slippered feet tangle together under the pile of fluff. “Couldn’t sleep?”
Ron grabbed his wrist and yanked his hand away from his face towards him.
He tried to keep his eyes open and trained on Malfoy, but he was at an odd angle and his eyes couldn’t strain that far for long. Draco, sensing this, moved to his mother’s chair. “Look, I know you must be confused.” Harry nodded, stronger this time. The throbbing was settling into a dull ache. “I promise you, I will answer every single question you have once the healer takes a look at you.” The door opened again, and in whirled a young woman with blonde hair and mint green healer robes.
So that’s exactly what they did. They bought a house that was larger than average, although no where near the size of a manor, and they decorated it to fit their tastes. The lands around it were wonderfully landscaped, thanks to Draco and his liking for gardening and flowers.
He smiled down at his mother, and shifted his gaze to Harry as he writhed in pain.
He showed up in Severus's rooms not long after that and he sat waiting for him to get done doing whatever it was that he was involved with. He just wanted to see him and to talk. After all, he hadn't done that in almost a week.
"Draco?"
“Oh I don’t think so. You’re going to tell me exactly why you’re cutting your ties with me when I’ve stuck my neck out for you and stood by you when you’ve been nothing but a jerk back. You’re going to explain to me why you treat me like shite because you’re not allowed to treat me like that anymore! This whole thing is your fault, let’s not forget that! You’re ungrateful and you can’t see what’s right in front of you. Just how is it that you’ve decided that I’m in the wrong when it’s you that has to be a spoiled brat!”
“You’ll both be taking the same classes, and you’ll both be paired up together and sitting next to each other. I trust you can keep the affection to a minimum during class time. I can’t have you two being a distraction any more than you already will be.”
The scratch of quill on parchment ceased. A beat passed where Harry wondered if he had said too much, if Draco was about to send him off to St Mungo’s for psychological testing.
Draco shivered below Harry. He pulled back just slightly until he could see Draco’s face.
“What kinds of things? If you want me to use you, you have to tell me how.”
Then Harry was leaning in for a kiss, eyes fluttering shut in anticipation.
Harry nodded fervently, letting go of his cock and sitting up a little straighter, mind racing as he imagined what was about to happen.
(And Harry would have to remember to thank her later).
Finally, Harry swallowed Draco all the way down, his nose pressed to Draco’s lower abdomen, his lips wrapped firmly around the base.
“Welcome to the arcade, Malfoy,” he said with a smirk, grabbing Draco’s hand and beginning to lead him further into the chaotic battlefield of music, shrieks, blaring alarms, and cheers from groups of Muggles huddled around flashing machines.
And unfortunately, as much as he loved the Weasley’s, their annual Christmas celebration was no exception. But unlike the Ministry events that he could find ways to shrug off, and dinner invitations that he could politely decline, the Weasley’s knew his own schedule better than he did, and there was no getting out of this gathering.
“So you like it rough?” Draco inquired, his voice sounding clinical, though his eyes had narrowed, his pupils darkening.
Draco shifted around, settling his head on Harry’s chest and letting out a little sigh.
Harry let out a chuckle on a rush of air, “If this is what was on your mind, then
Harry watched as Draco turned around, picking up a pillow from the sleek couch that lay behind him. Harry wondered for a moment if Draco was about to throw the pillow at him, too.
“Draco, Draco -
It was as if the maze from the Triwizard Tournament had been recreated using brightly-colored and extremely loud flashing statues. They towered over everyone, the adults and the children, and they were rather intimidating despite their ‘family-friendly’ appearance.
“Well, your mother… she erm, came to talk with me.”
Harry came seconds later, his cock twitching out ribbons of come onto his chest as Draco stood over him, a smirk on his thin lips.
He pet a thumb over the rim, his touch drawing a shaking exhale from Draco’s lips.
Though Draco and Harry were the same age, Draco’s body was still so lithe and fit, he exuded a youth that drove Harry mad, especially now that Draco was playing it up.
It mocked him with its growth and its annoyingly beautiful petals.
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes practically begging Harry to tear him to pieces. God, he was
Draco looked down at Harry with an expression that communicated an endless stream of emotions - though he didn’t say a word - arousal, mischief, apprehension, exasperation, hope, love.
Draco set his book down on their bedside table along with his glasses, crossing his arms over his chest. “No.”
"Thought you liked me mouthy," I shot back.
“Ah ah, turn around, Potter.”
Harry shifted his hips, delighting at the moaned it drew from Draco, his thigh brushing against the sensitive tip of Draco’s cock.
There was something blissful about it all. Something inside of Harry seemed to click into place, something that made him feel safe, allowed him to relax fully into himself and his desires. It was freeing. And though Harry wouldn’t realize it until later, tears began to roll slowly down his cheeks until they fell into the tracks of Draco’s piss, the two becoming intermixed and intertwined as they painted their way across Harry’s body.
Harry thought as he stood frozen, awaiting whatever fate Draco had in store for him.
Draco simply couldn’t recall a time that he had ever seen Harry so anxious. He almost felt bad for him.
Then a silence fell back over the pair of them.
Kissing Harry was somewhat of a dichotomy, because while Draco could intimately feel every shock of arousal racing through his veins, he also felt as though he was floating outside of himself.
Hips thrusting together, they were no longer kissing - just gasping into each other’s mouths, exchanging air as their bodies became one, their orgasms building in a synchronized movement, teetering on the edge of it all.
There was an unmistakable hitch in Harry’s breathing and Draco couldn’t help but smirk, sparks igniting a fire inside of him.
Draco shook his head and attempted to unclench his jaw, while Harry laughed his arse off.
Harry nodded, avoiding Draco’s gaze as he ran a hand uselessly through his disastrous hair. “I’m sure of it. I - er - just thought you deserved to know.”
while hopping on one leg. “Everything went so well last night! Weasel and Granger had to leave early, the club played my favorite song - twice!, you just ‘happened’ to buy me my regular drink, we had dinner at a Muggle restaurant that was actually decent, and we got upgraded to this beautiful room! It had to have been Felix Felicis, there’s simply no other explanation.”
"Draco, could I please undo the binding spell? I'll just get my wand out and cast a quick finite, alright?"
Harry lead Draco into the bathtub, then left and closed the door behind him, casting cushioning charms everywhere and undoing the thoughts spell. The blonde looked like he could barely walk and Harry didn't want him falling and breaking his neck. He was snapped out of his thoughts by a loud scream erupting from inside the bathroom.
" Y-you weren't lying?" he asked then went back to smiling.
“This isn’t possible,” Harry said breathlessly as he stared at the paper the officiate had just conjured up, which clearly stated he was bonded to Draco Malfoy.
" what was that?" he asks calmly.
Draco, now, smiled at the memory. He was right to be insecure and clingy in Hogwarts. If he could go back, he would never let Harry leave his side at all. Not when he knew how everything was going to turn out.
Don't own any of the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
Harry never stopped going to the alley, even when he was almost certain Draco wouldn't show up. It was the only constant. It was the only place his Draco went to when he needed Harry. Harry couldn't fathom the thought that the blonde might show up needing him, but leave if Harry isn't there.
"they all sounded so.. Un-like you. They all sounded like that last letter." Draco whispered the last sentence and Harry's heart felt like it was beating out of his chest.
"What do you need?" the brunette asked calmly, then hesitantly added, "Can I heal you?".
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blinked. He wasn't expecting that.
Draco was crying by the end of the note. He hesitantly got up and tried the front door. Open. The floo was too. But, for the first time since Harry found him, Draco had a gut instinct screaming at him not to leave. He didn't want to leave. And it wasn't just the image of Harry finding out the blonde was gone and breaking down entirely that spurred Draco's decision. Draco didn't want to picture himself without Harry. That journal… These memories… These dreams. He could have them. They were right there. Even if there were a thousand things muffling his emotions, he was certain he wanted to stay with Harry and that Harry wanted him here.
"No."
Draco was ready to apologize for being so moody that morning. Surely, he must’ve scared Harry off. No one took that long to borrow a pen. The blonde had a perfect view of Ron’s office from his chair, but the brunette had shut the door.
He stopped at the lady's address and found that the dog, a Labrador, indeed, was starving. He was clawing st the door and didn't even bother to bark when seeing a stranger enter. He merely walked to his plate and moved it around with his foot. Harry scrambled to find his food and when he did, emptied the entire content into the plate, even though he knew it was unhealthy to give the dogs more than they would normally eat. He didn't care. This dog deserved more than what was done to him and his owner. Just like draco did.
"I don't know!" he cried out, trying to protect Harry's identity at all costs. Harry could normally protect himself, but Jashua wasn't like any other opponents. He's smart and manipulative and deceiving. He could get his opponents to knowingly walk in to his house unarmed and think it is for their own good. That is what he did to Draco, after all.
"I-I don't want to leave, Harry, but I have to." the blonde said calmly.
He didn't know what to make of it, of any of it, but he had made the mistake of being too pushy and loud with Draco far too many times and he swore he wouldn't do it again, even if every step out of the store felt like he was sinking deeper into water, unable to breathe. He briefly looked back to see that Draco was no longer in the Aisle and that his shopping was left behind. Exhaling loudly, he left the store and apparated back to Grimmauld place, only to return at 1:40 am, too eager to wait another second. He ran through all the questions he had, all the scenarios that could take place. Whether he was allowed to invite Draco back to his place since it was freezing and there was nothing open. He normally wouldn't have thought of it twice, but draco had looked so scared....
He ran inside and yanked back the curtain to find Draco curled up in a ball on the floor of the tub with the water hitting his bruised skin. He was whimpering and letting out soft moans. It was clear the water was causing him pain.
"N-no, I don't. You know why. You saw what happened. If you don't obliviate me it'll get worse."
Draco's train of thought, which was previously focused on how Jashua will react to him not being home for three days, stopped at harry's words.
"Friends?" draco mumbled to himself before quickly and frantically jumping up adn running as fast as he could down the stairs and off the tower. He had to get away. He had to get as far away from Harry and his frantic calls as possible. He couldn't do this anymore. This week was to complete his task. Then, with his mother safe, he could die in peace.
Draco didn't know what to say, so he gave Harry a smile that only seemed to make everything worse. Harry shuddered and started sobbing again.
Harry's eyes shot at the floor, where many broken bottles lay, the ones that, presumably, caused Draco's injuries.
"Why?" he asked the blonde, knowing his thoughts will respond honestly.
Hey guys! Thank you for all the comments and Kudos. Sorry I don't reply to all of them. I've just been busy lately.  I am reading them, though, and they make my day.
Draco was stunned into silence. He never thought his actions would've affected Harry so much, that Harry would've seen him as yet another person he should've saved but didn't.
"draco!" he yelled one last time. The blonde turned around looking annoyed and impatient. Harry didn't care. This one was important. "When can I see you again? Where? I need to know."
"Is it alright if I take you home?" Harry asked shakily, then immediately did so when he felt the blonde nod against his shoulder.
"Damn it! Stop crying! Father was right...you're a disgrace. You're a freak!"
Harry was taken back by the volume of Draco's voice and jumps, then calmly sits across the couch from the blonde.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I see. Did he happen to speak with you?"
But Harry had spoken first, desperate to know what draco was thinking and thus dooming any chance he had at getting the blonde to talk.
"You need to let me go." the blonde whispered calmly.
He knew he wouldn't break his promise to Harry, even if the next three days turn out to be absolute hell, he'll keep his word, if only to ensure that Harry would be there in case something like this happens again.
"As per my understanding, oagreement was that I stay here for three days. So, I am allowed not to talk the entire time if I don't want to."
"I-I only need to m-make you h-happy like y-you make me."
" Alright..." Draco said tentatively, but seemed to have calmed down enough and Harry had counted that as a win. He gathered some shredded papers, two pens and an empty jar, then set them on the bed, called for kreacher to bring up two plates of food, then set about writing everything he thinks might help draco during this day. Even more, the things that could convince Draco that he should stay.
Draco stared wide-eyed at Harry as if he didn't believe what Harry had just done. Then he cleared his throat.
"Hey Ron?" he called out to his friend, who was sprawled across the adjacent mattress. The redhead only groaned in response. "Did you have another friend right before hogwarts? Like someone from a pureblood family perhaps?"
At the sound of the door lock being clicked open so draco and Harry could get to the apparition, the brunette couldn't take it anymore. He didn't know how it happened or why, but, suddenly, Harry was on his knees, clutching Draco's waist roughly, sobbing violently into his right thigh as the blonde looked down at him in horror.
"yeah, but-"
“Hey you!”
Harry willed himself not to cry at what he was hearing. He needed to leave before he had a complete breakdown. Now more than ever, he didn't want Draco to go back to Jashua. But he couldn't force him to stay and he couldn't leave without being sure that he would see the blonde again. There was only one way to go about this, even if the thought of what he was about to say brought him closer to a meltdown.
Harry blushed at the statement, but continued to just be there, unmoving, content to do so through the cramps and restlessness if that was what Draco needed from him.
As soon as the blonde had finished his statement, he balled his hands into fists again.
"I-I still can't do it, Draco. I'm sorry."
Harry awakens to find Draco on his side, propped up on his elbow and looking down at him, deep in thought.
Moving from his kneeling position to a standing one, Harry slowly reached for his wand to cast locking charms on the doors and floo, only to have the blonde cry and whisper pleadingly.
"You threw it up!" Harry screamed and Draco flinched, but Harry couldn't find it within himself to care. The blonde was too good at this. Harry had already almost folded three times just by looking at Draco. He couldn't let himself be manipulated. "And-and it wasn't you who ate, even! You were trying to get away from me, if you recall. You were trying to break your promise. I had to force those cookies down your throat and don't you dare claim otherwise. If- if you wanted to get better you wouldn't have made up some excuse about that letter. I can see your wand under the sink, Draco! You could've fixed it here, but you were trying to run. Why? And then you lied about having a wand. Why would you do any of that if you had any intention of getting better? The answer is simple. You don't."
Tears started to flow down Draco’s face when he received no reply from the brunette through their mind link. He didn’t even feel anything from Harry’s side of the bond. Did that mean…
Harry shook his head. That wouldn't happen. He would make sure of it.
The blonde eyed him questioningly then burst into laughter. Harry gave himself a high five in his head.
"well, I don't!" Draco yelled, having raised his voice for the first time that day.
"Just to be clear, I am really hoping you don't choose the last two, but it's still up to you. I won't do anything but what you tell me to do and, I am hoping we can still be friends of you don't choose obliviation."
The posting schedule for this story has been all over the place, but there will be updates every week on Saturday from now on (at least).
“H-Harry Potter!” the guy stuttered out quietly, “I am such a big fan. If I co-”
"d-draco?" Harry whispered into the dark room and Draco knew he had to say something to reassure the man, that he couldn't share his thoughts yet. That last day was theirs and theirs alone.
"No, you don't! You'll die Harry! You'll actually die this time. I-I can't-"
I don't own any of the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
Ron tilted his head to one side and spoke slowly.
Draco hated himself for thinking this. He hated that he just couldn't let Harry go. It was better for the both of them. Still, his legs followed Harry. He couldn't not know where Harry was going. He couldn't stop his heart's erratic beating at the thought that Harry was meeting someone else. That would be the only thing to truly break Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco finally discovered the reason behind the brunette’s absence when Harry’s owl brought ‘the Daily Prophet’ into the house. The blonde didn’t usually read the magazine, since they were only interested in publishing absolute rubbish in there, but that day, he needed a distraction.
" Yeah.. It is." he said weakly. Suddenly, a look of devastation crossed Draco's face that broke Harry's heart.
Harry finally deflated.
Draco chuckled lightly, then shook his head.
"Don't look at me like that! You must know what I mean! You were mine to keep and to codle and protect and spend time with and laugh with and make love to and I was the same to you. I want to protect you from these awful thoughts that keep telling you I am lying and that you're a bad person. I would if you let me. I want you to be better so I can have you back, even if not romantically. I just wanted you to be here. It's what I've always wanted. And now that you are, you seem to be analyzing and distrusting of every single thing I do and say. You're making me crazy, Draco. You're making me doubt everything with your question. But I don't doubt my feelings and my intentions. I am sorry you misinterpreted them. Next question."
Harry's heart stopped as Draco started to walk away from him.
“Don’t pity me! It’s not like that. I’ve just been very stressed lately and the wedding is planned smack down in the middle of the most important case of my Auror career and Ginny is freaking out about the planning which means we are driving each other crazy and sometimes that can hinder attraction. I won’t need those after the wedding. Ginny is perfect for me.” The brunette said harshly, then slammed the money on the counter.
"That's not true and that's not the point, love!" Harry shouted then flushed at his slip, but Draco didn't seem to notice, instead keeping his attention on the full plate in front of him. "You didn't find me a burden then and I don't find you one now."
He was right. Draco deserves this.
"Then, why-"
Harry knew Draco could tell that he was getting annoyed. How dare he question what Harry was so sure of? What was wrong with him? Was it that difficult to believe that Harry loved him? Suddenly, he realized that, for draco, it was.
"Why the sodding hell not?!"
The blonde jumped once he realized the random guy was talking to him.
Draco shook his head, panicked.
He arrived at the location to find that Draco was nowhere in sight. Suddenly, the reality of being late hit him. He had no way of contacting the blonde and Draco was already hesitant about the friendship and wouldn't want to meet him again if he thought Harry didn't want to see him. What if Draco had arrived hopeful and left devastated after seeing that Harry hadn't shown? Would he lose Draco because he was ten minutes late? He was snapped out of his thoughts by the sounds of quiet sobbing and looked immediately to his left to see Draco laying across the ground next to the dumpster sobbing his eyes out, his arms covered in blood. His heart sank and he remembered the story behind the blonde's first suicide attempt.
"let's get you to bed, yeah?" he whispered, not knowing what else to do.
Harry's breathe hitched, but he fought to control himself. He needed Draco to say the words so he could really help him.
No. He had to end everything when the third day is done.
He felt cold, hopeless, depressed, and empty, but he didn't stop the spell. How could he? Draco has been living like this for years and Harry couldn't take a few measly hours? He was too weak and draco needed him to be strong right now and fight this. Maybe the spell could help him figure something out in a twisted sense. Listen to the thoughts to find out what can destroy them. Keep the enemies closer.
No status.
Draco nodded slowly, then started to uncurl himself, only to stop when he heard Harry's loud gasp, and resume his position in a ball.
“No. Please, Harry, don’t tell her. Promise me you won’t tell her about any of this. Emmyl and I are going to look into it. I’ll let you know if we find anything, but please...I can’t stand researchers or healers and how they poke at their newest patients to ‘study them.’ I-if this bothers you a lot, I’d understand if you don’t want to stick around.”
He told himself neither of those things would happen, that he was too withdrawn to feel anything anymore. How could he not fall back in love with Harry? Every single second spent in the brunette's presence made Draco just...feel. Suddenly, Harry was all he could think about. Again. And coming back to Jashua's treatment only made him long for the brunette more. It made him hate Jashua more.
There it was. Draco was caught. He was bad again and he needed to be punished. Harry is bad for Draco and Jashua needs to protect him like he always has.
The blonde smiled at him and started to walk away. It crushed harry's heart. The brunette had been hoping Draco would change his mind at the last minute.
He didn't  even have to wait another five weeks to see his Draco. The blonde found him. Or more like, he sent a message. It was a Friday, so Harry didn't expect him to be in the market, the old one that he had abandoned after standing Harry up. The blonde lurked outside and inside for hours, until Harry couldn't  take it anymore. He apparated into the alley next to it, only to come face to face with his Draco, standing a mere inches from him.
"Right. I haven't seen it. Perhaps you left it elsewhere?"
Rowling owns the characters. I don't.
Harry groaned.
“That is absolutely not how my field works, Harry. You should know that better than anyone. How would you feel if someone gave you a mystery case that apparently could not be solved before and expected you to just have it solved within an hour?”
"what part of I want the sodding lights off during sex don't you understand?!!" 16 year-old draco had yelled at Harry, making him recoil. Harry reached out and put a Hand on Draco's knee, making him wince, courtesy of one of his father's cane punishments. Harry seemed to understand instantly and a dark shadow crossed his eyes.
Draco finished reading the entries from fourth and third year, then skipped over the anxious ones of fifth year and found blank pages afterward. Draco wrote nothing past the summer before sixth year. That was strange. He always used to write before bed. But, he was especially tired that year. Then it hit him.
"Did you ever actually read any of my letters?"
Sorry for the delay! I almost got locked out of my google account, in which I save all my stories. Thank god I recovered the password. I'll be posting the final two chapters today. Thank you all for reading this story. I hope you've enjoyed it!
"please... I asked you not to do anything, father. I asked you to leave it. I was fine. I was being stupid as always. Why did you have to kill the bird? Why did you have to try and get rid of Dumbledore? Why??" thirteen year-old draco whispered through sobs.
The blonde flinched and Harry was just going to apologize, but then he heard the response.
"Are you sure you don't want any?" Harry asks carefully, not knowing what else to do but clearly seeing that the blonde is hungry. Draco shakes his head slowly. Harry sighs, gets up and leaves to use the loo. He comes back to vanish the rest of the food and is surprised to find that the third of the plate that he had left behind is gone. He steals another glance at draco to see him in the same position on the couch. Had the food not been gone, Harry would've assumed the blonde hadn't left his seat at all.
2) This chapter and the next will be very Harry-centric, and they will end in them becoming more than friends. That's mainly because of the tournament and how emotional Harry always becomes after having to be with the Dursleys for three months.
“Ginny…” he yelled out after her, but before he could take a single step down the aisle, Ron’s fist collided with his cheek so roughly, it caused him to collapse on the floor entirely. Luckily, his glasses were charmed to stay on his face no matter what, so he could glare directly at his so-called best friend, who said nothing to him before joining his wife in an attempt to comfort his baby sister.
"Hey..." Harry said, laying his cheek on the floor, getting a flashback to the exact same event happening in sixth year. If this Jashua has his Draco frightened as much as Voldemort did, then there's no way Harry would let him go back.
People were rushing over. Harry didn't have time to think. He only knew things would somehow get way worse if the blonde was discovered.
He nodded slowly and Harry grabbed onto him, forgetting the bruises he had noticed. By the time they arrive  at Grimmauld Place, the blonde was screaming loudly, pericing Harry's ears. Harry lets him ago after a few seconds, when he suddenly remembered that Draco was hurt. It took him a while to calm down, and Harry spent it telling him that everything would be alright, even though he had no bloody idea if that was  true. It had to be, though.
"I am really happy to hear that, Draco." Harry whispered, reaching out and taking both Draco's hands in his. He was just about to lean in for a kiss when Draco beat him to it. And, for a moment, Harry thought Draco had changed his mind. He thought that everything would turn out like he planned. That is, until Draco pulled back and gave him another sad smile.
“He isn’t offering you very much considering how hard this position is. You don’t even get benefits,” the brunette said with a frown. Draco laughed.
Harry finally finally gets a little piece of Draco back.
"Alright" he whispered, "Harry, I need you to promise not to ask any questions tonight. I need you to let me speak. Let me say things and let me not say others. Can you agree to that for me?"
"I should've known something was wrong. I had hoped something was wrong when I read your fake letters. But Jashua was so convincing... I don't... Why would he do that, Harry? Why would he do that to me?"
Harry's funny looks.
"I am so sorry." he wailed, approaching draco cautiously. "I am sorry for what I did to you for everything that happened in that bathroom."
"Is it because of your boyfriend? The big guy that hit me? Were you trying to protect me?"
Harry was jolted out of his thoughts by a horrible pain radiating off the back of his head. He instantly knew what it meant. His vision went red. Jashua had hurt his Draco. Badly. Harry needed to intervene. The spell alerted him to injuries that would cause permenant damage if not treated properly. But, of course, that ducking monster wouldn't heal Draco. He probably just left him there and Harry needed to know where.
He was snapped out of his thoughts when Harry suddenly jumped awake searching frantically on both sides of the bed with his eyes and hands for Draco. The sight made Draco's decision even harder on him.
If it turns out Harry was really gone, the shard would be put to good use and Harry could have Draco forever in the afterlife even if Draco only goes to the light on command then must be returned to the darkness below. With what he could only describe as extra-human strength, Draco lifted himself up to his feet, tumbled through the house to the attic, grabbed the box of Harry's letters, then his shard and left. He wouldn't need anything else anyway. Placing the shard into his trousers's pocket and holding the box close to his chest, Draco limped away from the house, determined never to return.
Of course, Draco knew the answer to that. It was that sodding cupboard and the monsters that put him there. Had Draco still had his wand, there's no telling what he would've done to them after Harry was no longer in their care.
The blonde didn’t even realize he was screaming the words out loud in a shrill voice until his mate turned a brighter shade of red and advanced towards Draco, who stepped back until they were both in the house then shut the door. Harry jumped when he heard the door close, presumably too drunk to be aware of what was happening around him. Then, he turned back towards Draco and started chuckling bitterly, then slurred.
“Can you show me the tape?” Harry asked, dreading what he was about to see.
"It's not the same." the blonde whispers back and Harry nods in understanding, though he seems crushed. Draco is astonished that Harry doesn't press the matter further. And for a split second, he thinks the brunette might finally, finally understand where Draco is coming from. That is, until he speaks again.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“They’re wrong!” Harry snapped, unable to comprehend what he was hearing, “I would’ve remembered marrying my childhood rival or...or conceiving a child with him. These are the only two ways a bond could form, right?”
" I am so sorry, mate." he whispered in Harry's ear. Alarm and dread suddenly assaulted Harry.
Draco just stared at him like he was insane, like the answer was obvious and it droze Harry crazy.
Harry couldn't help it. He really couldn't. He knew he shouldn't be reading these personal, tear-stained, thoughts, but it was as though he couldn't put the mysterious journal down.
"You moron! You self-centered, stupid, freak of a prat. Spawn of the devil, Draco malfoy!" older draco yelled at his younger version, only to have a hand grip his shoulder tightly and turn him around. Older harry was shaking his head at older draco, tears in his eyes and he was completely silent. Only after Draco felt hopelessness and a loss of the will to live did he understand. Harry was asking permission to reverse the spell and see the events from the blonde's perspective.
It didn't take that long for Harry to discover a spell of permenant occlumency on certain memories. It was only a phone call to Hermione that found him knowing it. Suddenly, he beat himself up for calling the witch instead of dragging him time out with Draco and searching for the spell, himself. It didn't matter. He needed Draco to leave as soon as possible. He couldn't imagine what his huge boyfriend would do to him  if Harry kept him for even longer.
"Stay. Please." he whispered and he saw draco's eyes widen before he started to shake his head.
Harry saw red.
"you know you're leaning on the door for the chamber of secrets, right?" Harry asked after a few moments of silence.
He sat down on the couch next to the blonde, who instantly looked up at him and forced a smile. Harry swallowed.
"You. Almost. Died." Harry hissed through clenched teeth and Draco recoiled "And. All. You. Care. About. Is. Some. Stupid. Letter?"
A faint smile made its way to Draco's face and Harry was instantly relieved. He was starting to understand the blonde's way of thinking. Maybe that would help him figure out what to do.
Harry counted down the seconds until the summer ended. He was starving, sitting alone in his room with only his thoughts and Draco's letters to keep him company. The letters helped, but they couldn't make up for the horrible words and beatings he endured at the hands of the Dursleys. It was at times like these that he especially missed Draco fussing over him and making him food so he would feel better.
Suddenly, Harry's hands were on Draco's chin and Draco was forced to look into his green, wet, serious eyes.
Harry was still smiling hours after Draco left. For once, the blonde hadn't needed coaxing to eat and didn't give any negative comments about himself throughout the entire night. Harry called it progress, even if it was a bit forward and Draco would likely return to his usual state afterwards. But maybe he wouldn't? Maybe this was some kind of breakthrough? Maybe after a few more dinners and get togethers, Draco would finally stop being so harsh on himself and start actually enjoying life as opposed to letting it pass by him.
The blonde still remained hopeful, optimistic, and happy, despite how pissed off and miserable Harry was and had been for the last week.
"You're not, Draco. You're-"
He had to keep that in mind when he cast the spell, checked that it was working, and ap parted Draco back into the alley next to the supermarket. So much had happened since he had picked the blonde up there three days earlier, but he knew he had to put everything at the back of his mind now. If he thinks for a moment about what he had learned, how broken Draco is, and what his Draco was going back to, Harry would embrace him, take him home and lock him in there forever, away from the cruel world that did this to him. But he couldn't do that, not if he truly wanted Draco to be whole again. He had cast the spell again and what he heard from Draco's thoughts had crushed him. He needed Draco to trust him again. This was the only way.
"Alright. I'll indulge you, potter." he told Harry, then his voice became falsely curious. "Why of why is the great Harry Potter worried about me?"
“Nothing. You don’t have to do anything. Just having you here helps.”
Harry stopped dead in his tracks. Draco's boyfriend seemed to be getting more and more suspicious by the second. And this was the third time Draco has thought about ending his life within 24 hours. This has gone on long enough. He quickly wiped around and held onto draco's shoulders, looking him in the eye to show him the seriousness within his own.
He stopped shaking his head, although he was more confused. He desperately wants to hug him, ask him to stay, to talk, to never leave.
"I-I shouldn't have said that." Draco whispered, looking at Harry with a panicked expression.
The blonde’s heart was beating quickly. It all seemed simple enough, but...there were so many people around here. Had it always been this crowded?
"Do you think your life would've been in any way better had you not heard me crying that day in third year?" he asked slowly, gaze still fixed on Harry.
"I-I am s-such a h-horrible friend. I-I am-so sorry I didn't come w-when I p-promised you I would."
"Draco.. Please stop."
"sorry, mate." he said, "I got in touch with a muggle friend recently. I am sure you've noticed how distracted I've been. The truth is this friend of mine meant a lot to me. He and I were very close at some point and he has this thing called major depressive disorder apparently and it was hard seeing him suffer. I am certain everything will be-"
The blonde laughed half-heartedly, but answered in a whisper.
“What specials? I asked for tea. Maybe you should get a hearing aid,” the guy yelled, then leaned in and whispered, "Death eater."
"I-I can't." he whispered, looking away, "I can't take everything back. You finally remember me and us and how we were and how I felt. I want you to remember that. You said it made you happy to remember. Why are you doing this? Why are you making yourself miserable for this other guy? What do you gain from being with him? Why do you feel like a burden with me, but it's alright for you to stay with him? It doesn't make any sense!"
"I am afraid I can't help you." Harry said as calmly as he possibly could, while seething with rage that he didn't fight harder for the blonde at trial, that he had cut him open because of a tantrum, that he had let him walk away from me twice.
The blonde simply continued to stare at the floor, not giving any indication of having heard Harry. Harry sighed and placed a hand on Draco's knee for comfort.
"You can take the cloak off you've hardly been careful with it today anyway. I sensed a presence the first day young Draco was here and every day since, but I would've never guessed it would be you."
Harry only huffed, then remained silent again. Draco retracted the letter slowly and held it to his chest carefully, to not rip it, then looked Harry in the eye and started speaking soothingly.
“Why the hell not, Harry? They stole from you and- and you’re just going to let them get away with this?!” he heard his best friend yell, causing him to flinch.
“Too bad!” Ron said loudly, “You’re letting criminals get away with a crime, Harry. What kind of Auror are you? Huh? What kind of person are you?! Do you not want your parents’ money back? How can you be so calm about this?!”
But Harry still can't find it in himself to get dressed for work.
"draco..."
Draco stood in Jashua's house, in the middle of the living room, staring at the wall, thinking about how he never wanted harry to see him like this, never wanted to hide his feelings around him again. Harry was the one person Draco told everything to for such a long time. He always saw right through Draco anyway, so there was no point in trying to hide.
The blonde smiled. Actually smiled then erupted into full blown laughter with occasional wines that suggested his ribs were bruised. Harry just gaped at him, waiting for any explanation.
"I don't think it would work."
Draco looked uneasy for a moment and Harry didn't have to ask why this time.
He accessed the locator spell, desperately hoping to find Draco before the injuries get worse or... Before he goes back to Jashua. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Draco was still in the house, but then was filled with dread at the implication of the blonde's actions. Was Draco truly that frightened of him?
When Pomfrey came in, Harry gave her no attention at all until he heard her say the words he was so desperate for.
Harry looked up at Draco, prepared to ask him to eat, when he noticed the blonde was still crying.
Jashua hadn't been that violent at the time, still obsessing over Draco after yet another failed attempt, convinced anything else would send him over the edge. He knows the blonde so well. He felt so guilty for doing that to Jashua. He kept raving about how Draco doesn't love him and was hung up on Harry and that if the blonde had loved him, he wouldnt have kept the glass or tried to leave him permanently. Perhaps he was right about all of it, but Draco had to lie. He assured Jashua that he would never try again, that he would get rid of my glass, and that he would get harry off his mind. He only managed one of those things.
“I asked for the day off,” he said casually, like any other person in his position would do the same. Draco’s heart swelled at the statement. He felt the back of his eyes burn, but willed himself not to cry.
“Please, Ron, just drop it!” Harry wailed, squeezing his pillow tighter and burying his face in it. He was right. The red-head was making him feel worse. Now, he just felt weak and useless, like he owed it to his inner child to get justice, but wasn’t strong enough to do anything about it.
“Perhaps I cast the spell wrong,” Harry heard the officiate say loudly enough for everyone to hear. The same thing happened once he cast the spell, again, though; the veil refused to even come close to Harry. Ginny’s eyes watered and she instantly yanked her hands back and ran down the aisle and out the large doors, all the while crying her eyes out. Hermione got off her seat and followed the red-headed girl out. Harry watched the scene unfold as if he was an outsider, then shook his head and attempted to follow.
"y-yes y-you would. Y-you a-already d-did."
The blonde’s eyes started to tear up as soon as the third person he came up to told him he didn’t know. It was hopeless. The place was charmed to repel muggles. None of them would know where it was. Draco wanted to go home, but he didn’t want to just sit there and wait. He could be waiting forever for news. He felt so helpless as he let his tears fall to the ground next to his shoes, wondering if this is what it would feel like if he stayed after the birth. Had the twins caught a magical disease and he’d needed to get them to St. Mungo’s, he would’ve failed. That’s all he ever does. Fail. Fail. Fail. No matter how many steps he could take out of the house, whether he could talk to others or not, Draco wasn’t fit to be a parent, a friend, or even a functioning member of society.
They weren't much, but Harry knew these weren't things Draco wanted. They weren't things he could even do. Draco had written down all the activities that Harry liked in order to please Harry.
He briefly recalled the blonde at age 15, sitting with Harry in his dark cupboard, telling him about his father's abuse, the darkness offering a weird sense of security, and how, as a child, he could only deal with it by hiding in small spaces. Draco always used to do that, though Harry never pointed it out. He just noticed the weirdness of having the blonde leave the entire castle and the safety of his room only to feel safe under the sinks in the bathroom, or, once in sixth year, though Draco refused to tell him why, under his bed in the room.
"I had a lot of fun, Harry. Thank you."
Harry thought back to what Draco told him about the hospital, determined to get to Draco's records and find out if the stupid doctors gave him proper treatment. Well, of course they hadn't, or else he would've been fine.
"I-I mean.. I am assuming you live together since you've been to the market together?"
"We can split it, if you want." Harry suggested, the hopeful speck having decreased in size.
He only knew that when he woke up, a full day later, Draco's bed was empty and Harry only stared at it in shock, tears spilling constantly down his as he laid still on his side, haunted by the made-up blankets on the bed that was previously occupied by Draco.
"what?"
“The game is up, Malfoy! I know you and that bogus healer faked that medical report in court. I know you broke the law to escape Azkaban. And I know you are just pretending to like me so I won’t report you or demote you or- I don’t know why you’re doing it, but you just are!”
A few minutes later, Harry's breath was taken away as Draco walked out of the hall wearing the robes he had custom made. Holding out his arm, he subtly double-checked his pocket.
"Can I...Can I see it?"
“Harry, are you alright?” Hermione, always the worrier, pat Harry on his back before waving her wand to vanish the mess.
For instance, when he found out that Harry had never eaten a cherry before he had made a point to have an entire bowlful of cherries on the table with their dinner that night. Turns out that Harry didn't like them, but it didn't phase Draco in the least. He was bound and determined to find out exactly what Harry did and didn't like.
"Draco, sit do-"
‘Harry’
In an act of pure impulse, Draco put the necklace on and as soon as he let go of the clasp, a piece of silver parchment appeared in the unclosed box. He lifted it up to read it.
Tentatively, Harry reached out to grab it.
His eyes never left Draco's hand-the same hand he was holding as a matter of fact.
"Because you need to push yourself farther than you're used to. Push yourself hard the first day and work the same the rest of the week. Then you work harder the next week an so on. And that's exactly what we're going to do."
"So, you sure you don't know why you care so much? You've been saying it for a long time now." Harry looked at his godfather, extremely confused. "You're attracted to him aren't you?"
"Harry? What are we doing tomorrow? It is Christmas Eve you know."
"Draco Malfoy," he took his hands in his own and stared deep into his eyes. "Would you kindly make me the happiest man on earth by letting me court you?"
He paused, letting Harry process that last bit. It wasn’t something you could feel, and must have shaken him a little. “Actually I quite like it. Your hair matches your wings, sort of. Black with little spots of emerald green. Speaking of your wings, they’re mostly black and have a bright metallic silver and gold dispersed. Not enough to overwhelm the black, but to accent it. And you’ve got a handful of green on each. Very spread out though, it’s quite nice.”
Letting his eyes fall shut, Draco focused in on Harry’s finger, giving it as much attention and finesse as he would have Harry’s cock.
“I said no such thing!”
are the one who blabbed.”
Draco was dressed in an outfit that had Harry’s mouth watering. His torso was encased in an a black latex bodysuit, the material clinging to the curve of his arse and leaving little to the imagination as he turned to the side - the shiny fabric showing off every delicious inch of his cock.
About a week after Harry’s initial visit, Draco received a knock on his door late one Sunday night.
Draco gave him one last kiss before he nodded, taking Harry’s hand and leading them away from the stage.
,” he leaned over to pull Harry in for a quick, but no less dizzying kiss, “I’m thinking it will keep on doing
Harry had a feeling that he wasn’t going to be getting more than one or two word answers, but he was so curious as to what spurred on this apology, “Are you apologizing for old stuff? New stuff…?”
And Harry didn’t want it to end just yet.
It was Hermione who had slipped it in oh-so-casually during their weekly tea, “A new gay club opened up in Staffordshire, did you hear?”
When Draco came, it was akin to a religious experience. A bright light flashed inside of Harry as Draco’s come spilled inside of him, his hips stuttering against Harry’s lips as his cock pulsed from the force of his orgasm. Draco’s fingers tightened on Harry’s head, the pressure painful and perfect.
He imagined what he must look like, flushed cheeks and swollen lips, his head tilting back on a gasp until his long neck was exposed to Harry’s eager mouth. He imagined the hefty red marks Harry was leaving in his wake - bite marks visible in stark contrast with Draco’s own alabaster skin.
As the song neared its end, Draco leaned back against the wall before making eye contact with Harry and launching himself forward until he was straddling Harry’s lap, a hand coming around to press Harry’s face into his chest.
Harry walked with Draco on unsteady feet. Draco led them towards a thicket of trees that lay just beyond the stage, a tiny forest in the middle of a London park.
“All the way down to the base this time, Potter,” Draco spoke, pressing a firm hand to the back of Harry’s head, urging him further.
Typically, Harry liked to spend his time in Ginny’s old room, as it had the best view of the garden and the evening sunset, but tonight, Harry felt oddly drawn in a different direction.
When they arrived at the trees, Draco didn’t waste any time. He leaned back against the nearest tree and pulled Harry in by the fabric of his shirt, kissing him hard as he fumbled with his trousers.
A pleased hum escaped Draco’s lips as he thought of the pain and pleasure he could inflict on Harry with this one simple item. He wondered how delicious Harry would look with harsh red marks streaking across his arse.
Harry felt a pressure pushing down on his shoulder, Draco’s eyebrow raising in silent expectation. Harry responded immediately, moving down onto his knees in front of Draco.
As Harry brought himself off, he couldn’t help but think of a certain pair of piercing blue eyes and a shock of expertly-styled blond hair. Harry couldn’t help but imagine Draco Malfoy standing above him, dressed in an expensive Muggle suit, his shirt unbuttoned just enough so that Harry could catch a glimpse of his prominent collarbones and long neck. Harry thought of Draco standing over him with a look of superiority in his gaze as Harry gave up the reigns and fell into Draco’s mercy.
Before Draco could even register the gorgeous image of Harry Potter on his knees with Draco’s hard cock in his hand - Harry was leaning down and taking the head of Draco's cock into his mouth.
Harry had no idea how long Draco had been eating his arse for, convinced that time was moving at the pace of dripping honey - sickly sweet, stretching on and on in one delicious never-ending string.
Just as Harry was rubbing his eyes, pawing around on the bed for his glasses, a door banged open to Harry’s right and Draco’s less-than-pleased voice was suddenly shouting at him, “So where the hell is it, Potter?”
As a single spotlight shone on a head of white blond hair, Harry felt himself walking forward, pushing through the crowd until he made it to the edge of the stage.
Harry then leaned forward bed, beginning to list items off on his fingers as he spoke, “First off, Hermione is about twelve weeks pregnant and they left because she wasn’t feeling well. Second, your favorite song also happens to be in the top 100 list at the moment, so it wasn’t so much luck as it was inevitable that it would play more than once over the course of several hours. Third, I’d seen you at the club before and you always had the same damn drink in your hand, so I figured it’s what you would want. As for the Muggle restaurant and the room - I got recommendations from Luna on the best food in Muggle London, and the hotel thing wasn’t by chance… I - uh - I paid for an upgrade,” Harry finished, avoiding Draco’s gaze as he felt his cheeks beginning to heat.
importance that you trust me. I know we have a history… a rather complicated one at that, but if you don’t feel you can trust me, then there is no point in continuing this discussion any further.”
Harry clutched for purchase on Draco shoulders, hissing out a breath as Draco ran his teeth over the sensitive flesh of his neck. "
He expected Draco to say something, to call Harry sick or vile, but the words never came. Instead, Draco took his time at the sink, massaging a bar of soap between his hands until suds formed, spreading the lather between his fingers and over the curve of his palms. Harry then watched as a cascade of water poured over Draco’s skin, washing the stream of suds down the drain.
... but Draco found himself saying something else instead, “Not before I get to suck your cock.”
He let out a moan, shivering as Draco teased a finger over the trail of dark hair that led beneath the waistband of his trousers. Then Draco was pressing his lips just below Harry’s ear, breathing out a command, his breath nearly as hot as the request itself, “Shirt off. Then get on your knees.”
The next several minutes were a blur as Draco turned on the shower, steam filling the room as he maneuvered Harry under the stream. Draco lathered Harry’s chest and abdomen, massaging his muscles as he helped to wash Harry clean.
And it all just sort of fit together.
“You. The music. Everything,” Harry shook as he spoke, an orgasm teasing under the surface of his skin, the sensation on the tip of his tongue, the pleasure ready to explode inside of him.
“You su- ” Draco began, but Harry interrupted before he could finish, “Yes, I’m sure.”
Draco reached out a hand and pulled Harry to stand before leading him to the loo.
Harry let out a shaking breath when Draco glanced up at him, his grey eyes wide and his lips flushed. “
Thankfully, Draco seemed to be too preoccupied with sucking a spot just beneath Harry's jaw to have noticed.
For a moment, Draco hesitated. In all honesty, he wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear whatever information Harry was about to share with him. He already had heard enough about the terrible things his mother had done before the War - the lives she ruined, the people she hurt. Draco got quite enough of that from the Howlers that were sent to him on almost a daily basis. He didn’t need to hear it from Potter too.
Harry gasped as Draco reached down and wrapped a hand around both of their cocks, bringing them impossibly closer. The sensation had Draco feeling light-headed, the pleasure so strong as blood rushed to his cock.
“Salazar!” Draco exclaimed, wheeling around and taking a long swig straight out of the bottle as he took in the plant.
And even as they walked away together, already insulting one another and arguing over what type of food to get for their breakfast-dinner-date, Harry could swear that he saw a smile pulling at the corners of Draco’s mouth.
, that's amazing," Harry sighed.
Electricity sparked off their bodies as they moved closer and closer together. Draco sucked in a breath when Harry’s nose brushed along his jaw, and trembled when Harry’s lips brushed his own with the gentlest touch.
As the pair of them got up, there was something quite natural about it all. They showered together as though they had done it a hundred times. They brushed their teeth and then leaned in for a quick brush of lips. Harry cleaned his stubbornly dirty glasses whilst Draco went through his morning skincare routine.
There was something inherently sexual about Draco’s every movement, every facial expression, every sound that fell from his lips - and this was no exception. Draco made pissing look like an art form. It was no wonder the Greeks and Romans would immortalize a moment such as this in marble statues, an eternal stream of water falling from a plump prick, a look of pure pleasure on the man’s face.
Draco’s eyes nearly crossed as he looked at Harry's tanned finger, even this one digit making his mouth water. And before he could stop himself, Draco peeked out his tongue and traced it along the seam of Harry’s finger.
“Oh, it’s
Draco glared at him - though the act didn’t last long, and soon Draco was falling onto his back once more, his cock throbbing in Harry’s hand.
With a quick jerk of his hips, Draco overpowered Harry, reversing their positions so that Harry was now lying on the bed staring up at Draco.
Chaste kisses were pressed into the crease of his thigh and along the line of his taint, trailing down until Harry could feel Draco’s supple lips pressing against his rim.
“So, I need to ask you a number of questions before we get started, just to ensure that we are on the same page. I’ve reviewed your basic paperwork, but I want to know some specifics.” Harry nodded, watching as Draco waved his wand lazily, a roll of parchment and a quill soaring into his lap. “First of all, I need to know, is this your first time working with a Dom?”
Despite the interest that stirred inside him, Harry resigned to try and ignore this new information - determined not to let his world become overrun by Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t sixteen anymore.
Draco was blinking up at Harry through strands of stray blond hairs and long, delicate eyelashes, the look in his eyes beautifully demure as his flushed lips sucked and sucked on Harry’s nipple. He pulled back for a moment, the combination of his words and his warm breath rushing over the wet skin making Harry’s cock throb, “Does it feel good?”
Harry probably should have said something romantic or sweet, should have ran his fingers through Draco’s hair or pulled him up for a kiss, but instead he just couldn’t help but ask, “What is the extra pillow for?”
So Harry remained still, remained quiet, and let his eyes remain shut.
After a long day of meetings at the Ministry, Harry stepped through the Floo to find Draco sitting on the couch, clad only in a pair of thin grey briefs.
As Harry continued to prattle on about his cousin and the massive number of presents that he demanded to have each year, Draco looked down at Harry and had to swallow around a lump in his throat.
As Draco bobbed enthusiastically on Harry’s cock, Harry couldn’t help but wonder how a night of anxiously hiding from a Christmas party had turned into
Without words, Draco nodded in the direction of their bed and Harry climbed up onto the sheets, settling himself back against the headboard, his legs spread in front of him.
Something in his gut was pulling him elsewhere, and he found himself walking toward Fred and George’s old room, the door cracked open, a warm stream of light pouring through, as if luring Harry in.
He bobbed and sucked and kissed, exploring every inch of Harry’s cock until he was writhing, his fingers cupping the line of Draco’s jaw, his hips canting up into Draco’s mouth.
Suddenly I felt the cool flat of the blade on my cheek guiding my head to turn slowly, slowly until Harry's lips connected with my own.
Harry had shown up right on time, a ribbon-wrapped bottle of Goblin Mead in his right hand and a Muggle toilet plunger in his left (per Mr Weasley’s request).
(Maybe it was a bit of both).
Harry wanted every sense to be overwhelmed.
As with all the other Muggle games, Harry proceeded to annihilate Draco - this time, with some truly exceptional dance moves.
“I want more, you complete arse,” I spit out, unable to help myself.
The first hour of the party was tolerable, the full crowd had not yet arrived and the appetizers were hot and ready for consumption.
Draco sat up on his knees and swung a leg gracefully over Harry’s hips, settling his arse down into Harry’s lap and cocking his head at Harry, “See something you like, Daddy?”
Draco cocked his head at him, curling his stocking-clad toes around the hardening length of Harry’s cock. The touch made Harry gasp, his jaw tightening, his eyes pleading - though Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was pleading for less, or for much much
, Potter.”
The crowd roared around them, their shouts and obscenities seeming to shock Draco out of his momentary stupor, and suddenly he was pushing Harry away and standing up - swaying his hips aggressively to the music as he continued the performance.
Above him, Draco had Conjured a glass of water, one that he was drinking leisurely as he stared down at Harry, his throat bobbing with each successive swallow, his lips shining as he tipped the cup back. Harry’s heartbeat sped up as he processed what Draco was doing, what he was preparing to do. The thought alone had Harry’s prick pressing insistently against the thin material of his sleep trousers.
And in that moment, with Harry at his back and this ironic love-plant staring up at him, Draco made the decision to stop thinking and just do.
“So on the night that I battled Voldemort, -” Draco twitched involuntarily at the mention of
And then Harry felt himself being pressed back until Draco arms were dragging firmly across his chest, tweaking at his nipples through the thin material of his shirt.
Harry ran a hand through his mess of black hair, shaking his head and letting out a light chuckle before leaning back on his hands, “I’m so going to regret asking this, but what in Merlin’s name do you mean?”
say you could use your mouth.”
“You totally cheated, you wanker! I set it up for you and then you just got lucky,” Zane replied with a harumph, scowling as he crossed his arms over his chest.
” Harry’s words came out in a whisper.
A devilish smirk pulled at the corner of Draco’s lips and he leaned in to bite gently over Harry’s nipple, the dull sting going straight to Harry’s cock.
Draco’s vision blurred as Harry wrapped his lips around the over-sensitive head of Draco’s cock, “
When Draco finally pressed inside, Harry saw stars.
Their mouths fit together like puzzle pieces and their tongues were evenly matched in a duel. With every kiss and every touch, it built a crescendo louder and louder, their releases imminent.
what I do, Potter,” he replied, something sensual hovering in the air with his words. “Now, why don’t you take a seat and we can discuss the logistics.”
Harry felt it before he saw it, a warm stream of piss hitting his collarbone and rushing down his chest, falling into the grooves of his stomach as it traveled lower, lower,
Harry had discovered that he was an aspiring Daddy.
Potter.
“Breakfast, then,” Harry shrugged.
name. He had been avoiding using it, or being around others who had used it ever since his mother’s death. Afterall, despite what the Ministry may believe, Draco knew it was one of You-Know-Who’s remaining followers who killed her.
Draco sighed, placing the parchment and quill on the sleek black coffee table that lay between them. He then leaned forward in his chair, his gaze pouring into Harry’s as he spoke, “To make this work, it is of
Harry felt a hand stroke over his stomach, fingers trailing down until they skimmed along the strip of exposed skin just above the line of his denims.
with each new arrival - Harry decided to try and make his escape.
,” and then the door was being slammed in Harry’s face, leaving him standing in the dark hallway all alone.
to have Harry removing his shoes, to have Harry’s fingers brush against his ankle and stroke along the arch of his foot, to have Harry adjust the lip of his sock where it had slid down his calf. There was something erotic about it that Draco never could have imagined.
“Surprised you kept something alive?” Harry asked, coming to lean back against the kitchen sink beside Draco, his tone bemused.
After a moment to process, Harry spoke, “Ok, let’s do it.”
“Do you trust me, Potter?”
Draco’s tongue prodded the inside of his cheek and Harry wondered if he had taken a step too far. But then Draco was reaching for his wand, waving it swiftly, the coffee table sliding out of their way so that Harry’s path to Draco was clear, nothing between them except an ornate rug.
Harry was enraptured by the power behind each of Draco’s movements. Even if Draco had been performing in full Wizard robes, Harry would still have been turned on simply by the commanding nature of each move he made.
“Mmm, eager, aren’t we? Let’s start small.” Draco stroked a hand over Harry’s hair, “Just rub me through my trousers...” As Harry reached his hand up, wanting nothing more than to wrap his fingers around Draco’s cock, Draco stopped him, “...
Harry stopped when he reached the opening of Draco’s legs, settling back on his heels and looking up at Draco for his next instruction.
“You’re quite beautiful down there, aren’t you?” Draco murmured, reaching out and dragging the tip of his finger along Harry’s jawline, gripping his chin gently and tilting Harry’s head to the side, “Bit of a mess, though. Could do with a proper grooming.”
Draco hummed and drew the nipple back into his mouth, his eyes closing as he focused on suckling the skin.
He registered a warm body pressed against his hip, a hand spread over his heart while drool dried on his shoulder.
"Impressive. For anyone but an auror. Now I want you to learn these spells and learn them well. You know where to reach me if you need me." He handed Draco a textbook chalk full of spells that he had made written notes next to. It would figure that he would write in books, he never had much respect for the texts.
He loved it.
Immediately he knew the answer was yes, and smiled at the thought. How Draco Malfoy was able to entwine himself into Harry's life in school and out was a mystery to him.
They had managed to pull back and rein in their lust just as Narcissa knocked on their door. Sitting up, they called for her to come in.
"Um...Right. So Kingsley has a job for me which means physical work is going to have to be put on hold for now. So. Show me what you've learned since school." Draco showed him impressive display of various spells. He faltered after a few minutes after seeing the look on his spectator's face.
When he was alone with no one to see. With no one to hear his pleas with whatever god may exist to end his misery. When he knew no one could see. When he knew no one would be able to hear his pain. When he knew he could curl up into a little ball and cry like a child because that would be when he didn't have to stand straight like everyone demanded he do.
"Shit..."
When his hands caressed the wings, Harry gasped. He clearly didn’t realize how sensitive his new appendages would be. Draco helped him get situated so he wasn’t sitting on his wings, and sat back down. When he wouldn’t look up, Harry demanded to know what the issue was.
"Thanks."
“You wish!”
He looked so small and vulnerable with his face streaked with tear stains and red from the ordeal. Draco brushed Harry’s fringe from his face gently and smiled. Maybe his mother had been right, maybe he was lonely. He certainly would like to wake up with Harry in his arms more often, but was that he wanted a person to wake up to or did he want to wake up to Harry specifically?
"Draco. DRACO!" But he was too late in warning the other man of the dangers of what he was doing. The blond bent over, gasping in pain. Harry picked him up and placed him back down onto the bed, making sure he was in a comfortable position.
He quickly decided he needed to stop thinking.
“Mother...look! He’s changed. He passed out, but he’s changed!” Harry hear a more feminine gasp and giddy laughter signaling the release of pent up emotions. “He’s so beautiful…” Harry felt an odd sensation, almost tickling but comforting as well. He couldn’t quite place where he felt it, he just knew he did. Making an effort to wake himself up, he groaned. At least, he thought that was him. It sounded less gruff, and more musical to his ears. Then again, he had been swimming in blackness and pain for who knew how long.
When he woke up, he was in the arms of someone else. He knew from experience that it wasn't Severus that was holding him-he wasn't as toned as this person was. And he was certainly taller than this other person because his arms were longer.
“Please Sir, I’ve been so naughty while you were away.” Deciding to go with it to see what happened, Draco nodded for him to continue. Harry widened his knees, putting his leaking prick on display. “Oh, so naughty. I know you told me not to come while you were away but we have all those toys and I just couldn’t help myself.”
Lining the bottom was an assortment of sweets and chocolates. Lying atop the mass of sugar was a single white rose with light blue tinging the tips of the petals. He smiled at the thoughtfulness. He knew that Draco filled the bottom with sweets for Harry to share with his friends, for he loved sharing things with them. Since Ron was addicted to sweets and Hermione always appreciated chocolate, he couldn’t fathom any other reason the blond would have had for sending such things.
“I-I just thought it would be easier for our school work if we spent the holiday together instead of cutting out time from our classes or becoming a distraction to everyone else. I understand if you don’t want t-” his speech was cut off when Harry kissed them. It was gentle, slow and understanding.
In response, Harry licked a line up Draco’s chest and neck - tasting the mixture of sweat and alcohol that coated his skin.
Harry should have noticed that Draco was no longer writing anything down, the parchment long forgotten, but he was far too lost in the moment.
While Draco fought to keep upright, Harry licked and sucked, running the flat of his tongue over the head and then dipping into the slit, making every kind of beautifully obscene sound as he went.
“More or less?” He asked, rubbing his thumb soothingly over my wrist.
“Do you like pain, Potter?” Draco’s voice was deeper now, his tone rougher than it had been minutes before.
Even as Harry fought to take the cock, fought the urge to bite down, fought to
And for a moment all was right in the world.
Draco spoke as though Harry wasn’t in the room, making comments for his own benefit rather than Harry’s. And something about it had Harry’s cock growing harder, a flush spreading across his skin.
A smirk was evident in Draco’s voice when he replied, “The one you’re currently lying on is covered in dried come.”
Draco rolled his eyes dramatically, “If I must.”
Then a tongue was licking sweetly, almost tentatively, over his hole, massaging the pucker and sending pleasure shooting throughout his body.
After what seemed like an eternity, Draco turned around and made his way slowly to Harry. He moved into Harry’s space with a determination in his stride and a fire in his gaze.
Harry felt as though the world was turning upside-down and he reached out for purchase, threading his fingers through Draco’s long blond locks and eventually beginning to guide Draco’s mouth on and off of his cock.
Much like he had done with his foot, Draco used the heel of his palm to rub over him, dragged his fingers over the ridge of head, basked in the heat emanating from Harry’s body.
It was the kind of kiss that Harry could feel deep inside of him, the kind that lit him up from the inside out and had him moaning into Draco's warm mouth before he could stop himself.
“I want you to fuck my mouth until I feel like I can’t breathe. I want you to choke me on your prick, make me gag for it, I want your fingers twisted in my hair, I want your hips slamming up into my mouth. I - I want to be drunk on you.”
Beneath him, Draco groaned, glaring up at Harry as he breathlessly bit out, “Fuck. You.”
Harry opened his mouth as if to say something, but then closed it. He let out a frustrated noise and turned toward Draco, “I just - I wanted to say that I’m sorry. And to share a… a story, if that’s alright?”
Harry felt his body roll up into the touch as he gasped into Draco’s mouth.
“Do you want to come, Harry?” Draco inquired.
Harry swallowed, turning his head to the side and wiping a string of drool off on his shoulder, “You said I couldn’t come.”
"Oh. I guess I didn't read that part. I tend to skim since the letters since they usually have the same information on it from year to year." Draco nodded and sighed while getting up. He winced as he moved his legs out of their current position.
The thoughts rampaging around in his skull were simply unthinkable. Being sure to keep his inward panicking to himself, he looked Draco in the eyes.
“Bring me what you used and then tell me what you did.” Harry got up and sped into the bedroom before returning with his arms full of things.
But if he asked...then they'd have both parents around and Draco wouldn't need to worry about lying. He could get eternal love from his child. The only problem with that plan is that he didn't want to force someone to agree to it.
“The kind that prevents you from having sexual relations with anyone but yourself. It will allow you to kiss each other-and before you ask, no it will not allow anyone’s tongue into anyone else’s mouths. Anything above the jaw and below the wrist is allowed-but again, no tongues or you’ll receive quite the shock. Oh don’t look so devastated! It will be able to differentiate between holding someone without sexual intent and say giving them a hug. You’ll be fine as long as you don’t intend to rip their clothes off.”
“Farewell, young ones.”
Exactly three weeks after the fight, Harry woke up to rain lightly pattering on the window. He looked outside and saw the rain pick up and looked back at Draco. He imagined never being able to see his eyes again, never being able to talk to him. Because that's what happened wasn't it? Draco was going to die.
“Don’t you dare fight me on this. You’ve caused enough trouble for this family, and since beating the magic out of you didn’t work I’m going to have to fuck it out of you instead. This is what you get for having those fools as parents.” Harry whimpered involuntarily. Surely Vernon knew he couldn’t help who his parents were…
"You can't tickle me like you used to."
"Proteins and vitamins mixed with a variety of juices. Why?"
“Alright, I know you you two are here, but I don’t know what bench to sit on.” The charm faded away and she smiled at the creatures. “Beautiful wings, boys. I’m afraid I’m here on business, though.
I hope you accept.
“What is it?”
"I'm going to see Severus. You can come, if you wish, but I'm still taking my invisibility cloak." He grabbed the cloak and walked out the door with much haste-anxious to see the one man who knew just how bad his depression had sunk within the past year.
Father says he thinks it’s time. The bond has strengthened and only gotten easier to communicate through with distance. I miss you, angel. Just pack essentials-I need you here with me. My beautiful angel… His voice drifted off and Harry rushed to grab some spare clothing. He dumped the contents of his school bag and stuffed his clothing in it. He was in such a rush that he didn’t even bother putting his wings away.
I won’t touch myself either, if that makes you feel better. Harry didn’t need telling twice, throwing all his need at the veela. He whimpered and begged through their bond and sent images of himself splayed before him, quivering with desire. The submissive in him had him panting with desire to be taken. To be thoroughly fucked, marked forever as Draco’s.
Harry quickly concluded that the hesitation was from surprise and dragged his tongue across his bottom lip, elating when the blond opened up without any hesitation whatsoever. They stayed like that for several minutes, leisurely mapping out the unfamiliar terrain slowly. Only after Harry had again retained control, he let his hands roam from the silky hair down his neck, making the other man shiver and lean into him. He kept going, over his shoulders, and down his arms to his hands. He twined their finger together and lifted them up, gently pushing back making Draco lie down.
But what would he do about it? He couldn't really tell him, he'd get his head bitten off by one angry Slytherin. Harry wasn't so sure that he wanted that.
“Well, it’s not very hard. It just takes a lot of practice. You just have to find that pulling sensation and send whatever you want me to receive towards it. I know that’s not a very good explanation, but it’s the best one I’ve got.”
“I don’t have any issues with him.” Hermione must have picked up on the slight emphasis he put on the ‘I’ but she moved on without comment.
"Had. I'll tell you later." Harry took Malfoy's arm and apparated them to a forest.
When they reached the park, Harry waved his wand and a huge picnic set itself up on the ground for them. Almost laughing at the sheer extravagance of just a picnic, Draco sat down on the silk blanket, signaling for Harry to sit as well. And, instead of taking his normal place of across from the blond, Harry sat right next to him.
"If...If I ever...Ever do anything...Even under the Imperius curse...I want you to kill me. Before I can inflict that kind of fear and pain on someone. Okay?" Draco sat there, shocked.
Harry shook his head. “You?”
Always have a plan.
After dinner, they were promptly kicked out of the dinning area. Harry stopped walking as he felt a hand on his shoulder and was led away to the private rooms of Severus Snape.
“I’ve also arranged a speech at the welcoming feast about you two. I ask that you two replace your charm when I leave this compartment and separate yourselves from the rest of the student body to come and find me before heading up to the castle.” The boys nodded, interested to see what else she had to say.
"Mr. Potter, sit down. I must remind you that this is a hospital not the site of a murder." He hadn't even realized he was poised to hex someone into oblivion. He was beyond confused. And maybe he wouldn't be so confused if he wasn't livid at Draco's pain and even more mad at the reason for it. He was on the verge of realizing he actually cared for his partner. He never cared for his partners as a general rule. Oh sure, he cared about them, but never for them.
“Harry…Harry? Harry! I’m so glad you’re awake!” He squinted for a moment before forcing his eyes to open wider.
"I realize that you probably don't want anything to do with me, but I can't stand the thought of life without you. Wake up..." Harry's voice gave out then, preventing him from confessing anything else and begging for him to wake up. He hung his head and cried.
It was six months into the pregnancy when Harry took their relationship any farther. On the sixth-month anniversary of the conception of their child, Harry walked out of his room to find Draco sitting on the couch reading a book.
“What are you doing here?”
“No amount of money is worth that amount of danger Dean, you know that,” Seamus’s answer was always the same.
When he finally managed to get into his giant tub filled to the brim with bubbles and warm water, he felt a clench in his stomach and quickly hurried out again. After making sure he was clear of the rim, he ran towards the toilet to let out everything his body decided it could expel.
Draco pulled Harry towards him so their sides were almost touching, giving the man some form of comfort.
So what was he to do about his not-so-tiny crush? He could just let things play out and see where everything takes them, but that wouldn't be his style. Normally Harry would just go for it. But normally Harry wasn't interested for people who hated him for years on end. So waiting seemed the best option at the moment.
“Again?” Harry sighed.
“Well, I’d like to change that. Starting this holiday. When the train’s left Hogsmead, come find me at the Honeydukes and we’ll stock up before heading back.” Harry smiled and nodded, excited for the shopping trip and the ability to hang out with Draco without anyone knowing.
“Did you sleep well?” Draco hoped Harry hadn’t noticed his breathing pattern change, but he didn’t seem alarmed by anything at least.
“His family doesn’t have much, I think it bothers him that you have so much money and never want for anything when he’s had hand-me-downs his entire life.”
"Because you'll be tired and if you need to move fast you'll forget it. Harry learned the hard way and I refuse to let you make the same mistake. Now MOVE boy! GET GOING! We haven't got all day!" Draco gave the picture-turned-necklace-pendant a frightened look and hurriedly did as he said. Harry laughed at his godfather. If there was one thing that made him the way he is now, it was that man.
"Harry, I'm back." The older man walked through the door with none other than Draco Malfoy. Harry stood, not sure what to do. "Sit. Both of you." They did and he sat next to Harry, putting his arm around his shoulders and pulling him to rest on him. Harry did so, pleased with the way that the regular occurrence at Spinner's End was still in effect here as well.
The next few days were infuriating to Harry. All the teasing was driving him mad. It happened all the time now; during classes, at meals, in the morning, at night, both with people and when they were along. He didn’t know if he could take anymore without bursting.
-Harry screamed at his memory. Screamed for him to get up and run. Screamed for him to make a run for it. To fight harder. To fight longer. And then, he begged himself to pass out sooner. So he wouldn’t have to remember.
"Run?"
"Yes, I'm sure. I have Dobby waiting in the hallway. I trust him completely with making sure that nothing changes from here to the printed version for the public. I don't care if you so much as spell something wrong or miss a comma. It will be printed as such." She nodded.
And how fascinating it was! Sure, marriage contracts seemed to be a bit cold and not very romantic but it made sense. At least both parties would be aware of what the other expected from their relationship in the long run; a bonus was the ability to simply decline should a contract offer come his way. Narcissa told him he was likely to receive many marriage contract proposals the day he turned seventeen and that number would only increase until he was actively participating in a contract.
“So why learn now?”
They spent their remaining days at Malfoy Manor laying in bed together. They tried to practice spending time without touching each other but each attempt was met with a dull ache that grew after a few minutes and would build into searing agony. They simply couldn’t handle it yet.
They went to see what their bedroom looked like, and even Draco was impressed. The incredibly tall ceiling that mimicked the weather outside. Their bed was in the middle of the room, demanding attention. A four poster, but it was made out of wrought iron. Small vines of ivy and orange blossoms wound around each other for the framework. The white curtains were made from high quality organza. They had swirling patterns of gold with the occasional sky blue swirl mixed in. The sheets were black silk with the same pattern in silver with emerald green accents.
"AND ANOTHER THING YOU SON OF A BITCH! IF I EVER CATCH YOU EVEN THINKING ABOUT SEX EVER AGAIN, I WILL KILL YOU ON THE SPOT, AZKABAN OR NOT! I CANNOT BELIEVE I EVER THOUGHT I LOVED YOU, ALL YOU DO IS CAUSE ME EXTREME PAIN AND I SIMPLY WILL NOT TOLERATE IT ANYMORE! YOU CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT EVER HAVING FUN WITH YOURSELF BECAUSE ONCE I'M DONE IN THIS BED, I AM GOING TO CASTRATE YOU SO THIS DOESN'T EVER HAPPEN AGAIN!" And so the ranting went on, sounding suspiciously like Sirius was starting to influence Draco’s vocabulary.
"I forgave you a long time ago, you know." He heard a vague answer, but years of fighting with the stubborn git had given him the uncanny sense to know what he would say in any given situation. "No, I won't go away. Because I care about you. Because you're a person and because our paintings will castrate me if I walk away."
"Draco."
He just smiled.
"Sorry sorry I forgot to set my alarm." Harry's brow furrowed.
“Blimey, look at my shirt…” Ron had been directly across from Harry, and had taken most of the blow. Harry took one look at Ron’s face and started laughing uncontrollably. The rest of the table quickly joined, the redhead included. He tried so hard to send the image of Ron’s face and soaked shirt to Draco and was met with even more amusement, causing him to start laughing harder.
Harry glanced at Draco and handed his schedule over without any complaints when he pointedly looked at his.
"So I'm...pregnant? As in, I have a baby in me?" Harry nodded. "My God..."
"I noticed you didn't eat much either. Would you like some?" Harry was please when Draco nodded and finished making it in record time. They ate in silence and then walked to the bedrooms.
He managed to drag his eyes open when he heard the feminine voice calling him.
When the pain receded, Harry shook his head at him. "Well, I did try to warn you."
“Harry, are you okay?” He nodded and rubbed his eyes.
Harry was rubbing his stomach in circular motions lovingly, caressing his baby-their baby. He had moved so his head was on Draco's thighs, facing him. His eyes were still closed, making the man appear asleep. And by the deep, even breathing, he was.
“Account credit?” Draco paused and turned back to him.
“Wait!” She paused, shocked he was telling her not to put her reading away at the table. “When I was in Dumbledore’s office just now, he told me he sent you a book,” She nodded. “I was wondering, what is it? He seemed rather interested in getting you to talk to me about it for some reason.” She smiled, knowingly.
They had arrived at Diagon Alley in the mid afternoon. Perfect shopping time, the shops had all slowed down from their morning rushes. The fewer people shoving them around, the better off they would be.
All other information on this admirer was unobtainable and he was frustrated.
"Yes, run." Harry looked at him incredulously. "Your endurance has to be terrible. I've only seen you run two times and both were because your life was in immediate danger. So, we're running every day before working on your strength and fighting skills."
It was a large circular room, encased entirely in glass. The floor was magically maintained grass, with tons of roses, orange blossoms, jasmine, honeysuckle and dozens of other types of flowers. In the center stood a small fountain and white marble benches were placed throughout.
Christmas day came along without a hitch in anyone's plans, and Draco looked at the heaps of presents near the long-dead coals.
“Hermione?” She managed to tear her gaze away from the tomb once she was at the end of the sentence she was reading. When she realized Harry was the one to try to grab her attention, she blushed. She wasn’t used to ignoring him in favor of a book while they were eating.
"You have a very vocal portrait."
Draco flinched at the suddenly loud shouting. He didn't understand a word of it, other than the fact that whoever that portrait was, was very Sytherin to give such a subtle, yet obvious, threat. It was the ultimate way to get the pride of anyone stirred.
The two plopped down on the armchairs where Harry curled up in his and Draco leaned against one arm and let his legs dangle over the other facing Harry.
"Rule number twelve Sirius."
But he also felt all light and fluttery when he got another gift. Then again, he felt like that whenever Harry looked at him. He didn't know what to think.
“Well I’ve just told you, get going! You too Harry, we’ve much to talk about and no time to waste! Knowing Draco’s father, he’ll have Draco’s marriage contract offer written by sundown and Merlin knows that man isn’t very patient.” Harry started scrambling to clothe himself but froze at her words.
They spent the remainder of the day doing yoga, followed by some vegetables, followed by pilates followed by chicken and beef followed by using weight machines Harry unshrunk, followed by dinner. After that, Harry told him to take a cool shower and to get some sleep. They'd be doing a condensed version of their workout the next day at the same time.
Bonding:
"Um..." he clearly showed how odd and out of place he felt. "I've been..."
"I never knew about you to be honest. And I can say, I'm a little disappointed that I haven't met you before. You seem like a delightful person. Much more so than when I met your brother."
The bright silver eyes of Draco Malfoy were staring at him.
"When you signed up for this, you agreed to being trained by your partner. Tomorrow we start training. Four AM. Don't disappoint me." Taking that as his clear dismissal, Draco went straight to the manor and fell asleep after a light dinner. He both feared and anticipated the next morning.
“Well I was rather hoping she’d be so intrigued she would share her findings with you. It’s a book called ‘Inheritances: an Understanding’ You see, Harry, in the wizarding community it is considered common knowledge that powerful witches and wizards, upon their 16th birthday, usually come into what we call their inheritance.” He paused, and folded his hands neatly over the table as Harry simply watched him. “Most of your fellow students don’t need to worry about such things, it's usually just a surge in power. But I was worried about you in particular Harry.”
“Okay, what about me? Am I a good person to you?”
“I looked up spells for relaxation and stretching, and I even found one to stop myself from coming until you did. I did do a little reading as well,” Harry blushed at that. Draco nodded and slammed back into Harry.
Suddenly, Harry’s throat was parched. He reached out as Draco passed by again and grabbed his arm in a vice like grip, yanking him closer. Draco, surprised by the sudden movement, leaned into Harry’s chest. He knew what Harry wanted, and offered his neck to make it easier for the angel to get better access.
“Oh good, he’s really good at runes but he has a hard time with the practical application which you’re really good at. I thought you might be able to help him since apparently I’m too technical.” She rolled her eyes and they snorted. She was as technical as a textbook.
The girl had long hair for an infant the color of a mahogany desk, her wide light blue eyes staring up at everyone and everything. The boy had blond hair and half-closed grey eyes. The Healer continued to clean up, and watched Harry and Draco.
Draco continued to send Harry small gifts until early December. They went out every Friday night for a romantic dinner and on Saturday they would go out for lunch. Sunday they would catch up on homework and have a nice candlelight dinner in their room. Harry insisted on cooking on Sunday, wanting to show off his culinary skills to his veela. He wanted to show him how good of a submissive he could be, and without Draco having to tell him what to do, or how to do something.
He could see the exact moment that Harry’s hand made contact with the silver chain because his entire being sagged in relief. The tension visibly left him and suddenly Lucius was being pierced by pools of emerald.
"Yes." Draco was slightly proud of himself when he didn't hesitate.
“I spent the summer with the Malfoys. I simply got used to sleeping next to someone, I think. I’ll be okay, I just have to relearn how to sleep alone.” She gave him a knowing smile and pulled a tea service out from seemingly nowhere. He gladly accepted a cup and settled in while she thought about what to say next.
“My Dragon…” he practically whimpered when he realized what was happening. Draco was carding his fingers through his hair, slowly shifting his weight from side to side to produce a gentle rocking.
Harry sighed and sniffled before snuggling further into his arms. Draco smiled to himself and created a plan to help Harry get better. Once Harry was in a better place mentally, Draco would be able to think about the possibility of a future with Harry. But not until he was better. He needed to be able to find himself, to be able to rely on himself and those closest to him.
“I dunno, I’ve never bothered to count when I’m in my vault. I usually only take out what I’ll need for school supplies and an extra galleon or two for extra spending money throughout the year.” He hung his head when Ron’s gaze turned to a glare, daring him to answer the question. “Professor McGonagall told me the Potter family vault has more than the trust vault I have access to right now. Gringotts is supposed to contact me on my seventeenth to go over the family finances.” Ron’s face went from beet red to almost a pasty white before he forced his face to relax. His shoulders were still tense, though.
"You're right Potter." The older man became much more serious. "I need you to get started on a mission ASAP. But you need Malfoy. I can't let you go out on missions by yourself now that there's an even number of Aurors. So I need you to get him trained sooner than we planned. Meaning: you have one week to make sure that he's up to ship-shape."
“Come on, I’ll show you to our wing.” Draco snapped his fingers and asked the house elf that showed up to take the trunk to his room.
He worried, it was true. The All-Mighty Draco Malfoy was worried about Harry Potter.
Vernon never came to put the locks on the door.
"We're almost to the school. You need your robes on."
That summer Harry received an invite to stay at the Weasley house. He agreed and packed his things, happy to be out of his aunt and uncle’s clutches for the rest of the summer.
As his memories shot by, one after another, he noticed they were fading to something else. His body burned, like he was engulfing certain parts of himself in flames. His shoulder blades, head, and chest got the worst of it. His entire body was uncomfortable warm; hot even. It increased in strength as the memories faded away into the blackness, the blackness became white hot with the intensity of the pain increasing.
Narcissa gasped, smiled and hugged him in all her happiness. A tear was silently sliding down her face as she looked him over. “Dragon, you look wonderful! And you’re glow is much healthier now than it was a few days ago. You’ve even grown a few inches! And your wings, they’ve grown out-they’re at least three meters wide now!” Draco smiled at her obvious praises. “Oh my Dragon, remember when you used to worry you’d be the submissive and your mate would be the dominate? I think you can put those worries to rest.” They sat back down and Draco told her how much better he felt even in the short time they had been having tea.
"Ha, best thing I ever did concerning them. They don't bother me at all anymore, they're all too busy speculating who I've decided to win over." Draco nodded, wondering when the gossip mill about him would stop. It had been a grand total of three months since the announcement had been made, and people were still talking about it as if it had happened yesterday.
Harry walked down the hallway to gather his wits and calm down. There really was no reason to be this nervous. Perhaps some nerves would have been normal, but this was ridiculous. He just couldn't help but wonder what would happen if Draco said no. He couldn't think it.
Harry shook his head, the ache just barely there now. “Wait, you said wings. And Ron said something about a mate I think…” Draco smiled to himself.
He quickly changed his train of thought before he couldn't help but to shudder.
"All right. I'll be out in a moment." He watched as the blond went to his room and smiled as he heard a subtle gasp at the robes he had placed on his bed. They were a pastel blue with yellow embroidery creating abstract patterns throughout. The trimming was in the same yellow as the embroidery.
“Draco, I want you to be aware that I do not expect you to follow through with an arranged marriage. The time for arranging such things is over; go out and find someone to fall in love with. Just be cautious with whom you give your heart to. There are many that would gladly marry you for the money and the money alone.” Shocked, he nodded and the two parted ways for the day. He headed back to his room only to see Harry fast asleep where he had left him earlier in the day.
“Hermione, by the way. A boy named Neville is the one the toad belongs to. We’re just a car down if you find him.” She left just as quickly as she came, but Harry was relieved to know that not all witches and wizards were as negative as Ron.
It was over far too soon. Narcissa had escorted Harry down the aisle while Lucius stood behind his son. The young couple made their way through their vows with Draco’s voice threatening to crack with sincerity and Harry’s wavering from the happy tears spilling down his cheeks.
Never date a coworker.
"Draco?" He looked up immediately, not bothering to mark his place. "I...I'll do it."
The two talked until she decided to go out and patrol the walkways and make sure there wasn’t any funny business happening.
"I can understand if you would like to yell..." And yelling is exactly what he did.
'Boy-Who-Lived Disappeared and Come Back To Be Gay
Normal mating rituals can, and should, be continued once they no longer need prolonged skin to skin contact.
He winced, but tried to cover it up with a shiver instead.
Good thing it only lasted for another year.
"WHAT?" Harry sprang up and tumbled out of bed, tangled in the sheets. He looked up to come face-to-canvas with his smirking godfather.
“I’m not sure I like alcohol so much. I’ve said too much.”
It turns out Harry’s worrying was for nothing. When the subject came up, he had felt completely dejected but cheered up at Draco’s explanation.
Draco just sat there, too stunned to do anything other than stare. When he finally gathered enough of his wits through his happiness, he nodded. He watched as Harry gently took the ring and placed it on his right ring finger.
"Ah, You're still mad about the new kid?" He chuckled and didn't wait for a response. "Well, I can say I'm one hundred percent proud of you. You showed all the other people just why I let you work alone and don't let you get written up for anything. Hell, you scared the shit outta Moody."
And interrupting his rules, was a soft rustling. Harry paused and watched, looking for any sign of consciousness. Upon finding none, he recited until rule number twelve.
"But Sirius...if I lose him...I lost you and everyone else. I can't deal with anymore loss. And after my training sessions-"
Draco was petrified. He hadn’t gotten two steps into the room when Harry had asked him what was bothering him. He had thought that he’d hidden it better, but his anxiety over bringing it up to Harry must have shown on his face.
He could practically feel the concern coming from Hermione boring a hole into his jumper.
“You realize Mother will insist on being the wedding organizer?” Harry nodded. “She’ll bother us day and night about colours, designs, flowers, guests, invitations, napkins, food selections, music, art, locations-”
“It’s a lobster benedict. A bit hard to describe, here take a piece.” Harry, seeing no other option, opened his mouth for Draco to place a piece of lobster smothered in some sort of sauce on his tongue. And he wasn’t disappointed! It was rich and creamy and so good that he considered getting his own portion.
“Draco?”
He continued to tell Malfoy the details about how things would work and consumed only two more drinks during the rest of the day. He would drink all he wanted when those two were dead.
His dreams were a combination of blond hair and soft hands.
“Draco? You had mentioned something about a bond between us getting stronger when you have to leave me...what bond?” The veela tilted his head, thinking.
“Good, now seeing the Seer has to be done before you can offer a marriage contract.”
The two spent almost every waking moment in each other’s company the entire holiday. They got all their homework done within the first two days and spent the rest of their time flying, chucking snowballs at each other, helping the professors decorate and in general just being teenagers together. Draco complained about Pansy’s crush on him, Harry complained about Hermione’s incessant study schedules and the both of them complained about ancient runes.
“Finally ready to try the new one?” Harry’s eyes widened. He hadn’t meant to grab the new collar, quite frankly it scared him a bit. But he needed to get over his trepidation and here he had the perfect excuse.
“I…” His cheeks flamed. His emotions were scrambling to snuff out his conscious thought, but they were failing.
“And did you drink any wine while I was away?” The instant blush was enough to give him away, and the hesitation only confirmed his suspicions.
“And just what have you been practicing and for how long?”
“Of course he is! He spends tons of time with Lavender when she asks him for company and he’s always trying to get Seamus and Dean to help him pull Neville out of his shell. He’s constantly supporting his sister, and he’s always helping younger years get to class without getting lost.”
The two worked tirelessly for the next hour, and when Harry thought about their next class he looked at the schedule. They both had another free period after this and they weren't anywhere close to being done with all that Harry had learned. Of course, it would have helped if Draco hadn't asked as many questions as he had.
Inside resting on sapphire blue velvet was a necklace made of the finest white gold goblins could find. It reminded him a bit of the princesses muggle children always talked about, with the delicate threads of gold draping down and coming back up to connect with each other. Each place that the threads touched each other was adorned with the brightest, smoothest cut sapphires Draco had ever seen.
"I wrote her a letter this morning and we're doing it on Wednesday afternoon since we only have one class first thing in the morning." They split up for the night, neither one of them wanting to eat anymore. The night was just too stressful for them to handle and they went to sleep after silently finishing their homework.
“Are you attracted to anyone from Slytherin?” Draco, taken aback by the sudden turn of topic, took a moment to tell her that no, in fact, he wasn’t interested in any of the Slytherins. “Ah, and what about in general? Are you attracted to anyone?”
"Tomorrow. Early."
During the reception afterwards, they only danced with each other.
The two boarded the Hogwarts Express for their sixth year and found an empty compartment together. Draco stowed their trunks and Hedwig’s cage on the racks above them and they settled in for the ride. They’d purposefully shown up early to avoid the crowd of perpetually almost-late witches and wizards dropping their children off at the platform. Draco started to read aloud-something that had started quite spontaneously when Harry had gotten curious about what he was reading. Draco tried, and failed, to keep the smile off of his face when Harry relaxed and laid down on the bench with his head on Draco’s lap. He carded his fingers through the brunet’s hair and read with the book levitating in front of him.
“I guess not. I mean, some people are attractive, but I haven’t found myself drooling over anyone or anything like that.” She sipped her tea as she thought about his answer.
"Harry...Please..."
"You got up late. Eat it on the go." Without waiting to see if Draco was following, Harry started jogging down the path. Of course, Draco had no choice but to follow him if he wanted to keep his job and therefore rebuild the Malfoy name, so Harry didn't worry about him following.
"If this is any indicator, then what do you think?" Harry watched as Draco led his hand down to his crotch and pressed his hand into the hardness. Harry rubbed gently, teasing him. He watched as Draco pressed his head back into the pillow, biting his lower lip.
He had apparently decided to make himself a living mummy, wrapped in the fetal position. He couldn't get over the fact that Draco Malfoy was huddled in the blankets like a child would. He took another few steps towards the boy, and paused again when he heard a shuddering intake of breath. He couldn't believe what was going on.
They continued like that for the remainder of the morning, Draco complaining and Harry pushing. By the time noon came around, Draco seemed to officially hate Harry. Of course, that wouldn't do anything to stop Harry from pushing him farther and farther. He noticed fairly quickly that no matter how bad Draco wanted to stop he wouldn't. Sure he might complain but he'd always go through with it anyway. It baffled Harry but then again, he noticed that in their school years he would watch the pitch at night and would see Draco practicing late at night. Maybe he had more determination than Harry had originally thought.
They ran through the door half a second before it magically slammed shut.
"I...admired him for seeming so powerful, I guess. But when his 'master' came back...he lost that admiration within a heartbeat. So no, not really."
"Good. He's been having affairs with Lestrange. They escaped together.
“Harry, you’re a Potter. The Potter estate is one of the biggest estates known to wizards. You’ll have properties and more vaults at Gringotts and likely business ventures collecting revenue from all over the place. Did you really have no idea?” Harry’s face had drained of colour. Apparently he hadn’t known any of that.
“Would you let me in, Harry?” One of the wings opened just enough for the blond to fit through and quickly cut out the outside world again. Draco pulled Harry to him, holding him as sobs wrecked through his entire body. After a few minutes Harry’s sobs had quieted somewhat and Draco took advantage of that.
He was looking forward to it just for the idea that people would stop swooning over him anytime he went out in public.
True to what he imagined, it was the best summer ever. He got to fly with Draco and play seeker games, his homework was finished in record time and he even had plenty of opportunity to become a bit more confident.
Apparently he liked it. He pulled away, much to Draco's disappointment and cast a preparation spell on Draco and himself. The blond stiffened, not expecting the strange sensations that it caused.
“Oh my, is that what happened? I thought Filius was exaggerating! Nevermind, the fact of the matter is you’re right. The minister is a bit afraid of you, I believe. You do have quite a lot of raw power and I believe he’s worried you’ll come for his job. He’s even afraid of me taking his position. But I digress, until I can find someone in the ministry trustworthy enough to take over the position of your guardian I’m afraid you’ll have to keep going back home. Unless they’re abusing you, in which case we can press charges against them.” Defeated, Harry shook his head and stood.
"What?" Harry was thoroughly exasperated with whoever had interrupted his relaxation. Before he could dwell on that too long, he heard several people shouting about a fight and spells being no use. Harry yanked the door open and stalked outside to follow the throngs of people. Soon enough he came across a group of five men arguing and fighting with each other. Someone foolishly cast a stunning spell and Harry watched, annoyed, as it rebounded.
“What are you planning on doing for the holidays?”
Since then, the two were inseparable. They partnered during classes they shared and studied together. Not to mention sleeping together in the Room of Requirement every night and Harry had even taken to eating at the Slytherin table.
Don't go anywhere without bezoars.
By the time that Harry saw Draco wandering around aimlessly, trying too hard to seem like he had a purpose, he had dealt with every person in the Ministry building on duty that day. AND SEVEN VISITORS THAT WON'T LEAVE ME THE BLOODY HELL ALONE! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE? So he had very little patience left at that point and his stress levels were nearing his breaking point.
“You leave the language up to me, I’ll find a way to word it without offending anyone.” That cheered him up and gave him some confidence.
‘If that’s what you think is best…’
“Oh Harry, I’m sorry. I didn’t even see you come up, I’ll just put this away then-”
If he asked someone else then he risked his baby finding out later and being mad at him for lying all their childhood. But then he wouldn't have to ask his partner, and formal archenemy, and the Savior of the Wizarding World for sex. He'd only have to ask for help raising his child.
Draco and his mother talked about school. She and Lucius had convinced the headmaster that Draco would need his own rooms due to his condition. Their original request was denied until Lucius threw it back in the headmaster’s face that the Malfoy family had managed to kill Voldemort once and for all and had saved the wizarding world a lot of heartache had they waited for him to go about things his way. Dumbledore was much more accommodating after that reminder.
“Just because you’ll want to doesn’t mean you will. Once you decide you’re going to do something, the spell will prevent it. Wanting it and intending to do it are two very different things. Now are you going to tell me why you’re so eager to learn about all this?” Draco snapped his mouth shut. He wouldn’t tell his mother, not yet. He had to talk it over with Harry first. And besides that, Harry probably wasn’t ready for that anyways. Nope, he wasn’t going to tell his mother anything.
“If you so much as back talk me one more time,” he growled, “I’ll have your head on a platter. Understood?” Harry nodded, gulping and trying to prevent his body from shaking. “Good. As your best friend, I’m the most important person in your life, not the teachers.” Ron left the room then, slamming the door and leaving Harry to his own devices.
“Professor Snape, as you well know now Harry. I’ll talk to him about it, he can’t stay mad at me for long.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled with a spark of humor. Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to know just what that humor was. “I have called you here to ask you if you had an opportunity to do any reading with Miss Granger lately? I had sent her a delightful book a few days ago.” Harry raised his brows before answering.
"Why do my legs hurt this much? I'm not that out of shape."
“Why does she need to refill it twice a year?” Draco had heard of healers or parents with many children needing to replenish their healing kits, but the average person would only need it filled once every year or two at the most.
“That’s what he told me.”
Kingsley seemed to get the hint and left shortly after getting Harry's statement, leaving the two alone. Harry stayed like that for another week, never uttering a single word or moving a muscle.
They retired to their rooms early that night, leaving the group of Gryffindors out on the grounds. They had been surrounding a bonfire, but once Draco saw Harry scoot closer to the fire he had announced that they were taking their leave early. He didn’t want Harry to get cold outside.
Eventually Draco left to change into some clothing and Harry grabbed a sheet of parchment and his invisible ink and started to make a list of reactions he had to the other man. It was quite long already.
The next thing they did was work on Draco's sit-ups.
“Call me Draco. You’re what we call a dark angel now. Do you know what that is?” Anger flared up in his stomach.
The man was good looking. His hair made him look like he just rolled out of bed after a night of hot sex, and his eyes had darkened a shade over the years only to add to that 'bedroom sex god' look. Muscles were hidden by a thin layer of skin and clothes, but were blatantly obvious when he did something, anything really.
