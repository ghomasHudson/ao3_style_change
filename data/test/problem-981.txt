in that comment, appreciating how much Draco was there for him through all the strife. He apologised for James’ behaviour at the burrow.
“Of course they are,” she soothed. “So, is there anyone?”
“It’s a long story, are you sitting comfortably?” Harry teased.
++++++++++++++
Without knowing my side of the story, you can’t comprehend why I think getting sliced with that sword saved my life. The truth of the matter is, if something hadn’t happened to make me stop, I would have run myself into the ground. I was like a ticking time bomb. I was barely looking after the boys, let alone myself. That’s without considering the hell that was Grimmauld Place. The kids were growing up in the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, full of some of the worst of my wartime memories, not to mention the
. Harry internally rolled his eyes at his thoughts, ruffling some salt spray through his wild hair and spraying his neck and chest with Gaultier Le Male.
“Well Ted made me promise. Plus that’s not the only thing that I was a shit about last year, I’m still a fuck up, dad.” James glumly stated.
“Read the room, no one cares about your shitty gossip! What you write about dad is bad enough, in fact it’s fucking embarrassing. Did you just marry Uncle Ron to get the inside scoop? I’ve had enough of it!”
"It's Head Auror now."
"No reason."
"Draco, do you want me to force myself on you?"
Yours always,
"Okay."
“Err, hello Head Auror Potter, err, what can I do for you?” He stammers rather eloquently.
But I believe he has his mother’s eyes, no?
You'll find a parcel enclosed for you, I hope you like it.
They mean well, they do, but Harry just wants to sit at home in his pants, trying again and again to figure out what went wrong with Draco. He doesn’t want to be told that
I do use a room at the Manor but I have my own flat now.
, Harry thinks,
Give him a kiss for me.
"Yes, well. I know better than to think you'll do anything about it."
“Practice. Like for a date?” Draco’s cheeks darken even further,
“Indeed.”
And then?”
Draco,
Talk to me, please.
Love,
“Ron, be nice. It’s Draco’s first time at the Muggle gym. He needs our support. Keep going, babe.”
They kiss for a while, limbs entwined, hands caressing each other's body. It takes Ron coughing loudly for them to break apart.
Harry understands Draco’s fears. How could he not? He knows Draco’s been feeling unworthy most of his life, held to unattainable standards by his father and then Voldemort, only to be punished physically and emotionally when, as expected, he didn’t measure up. They often joked in the past on how Draco’s never been evil enough to be a bad guy, but not good enough to be a hero either. And it’s true, Harry’s desperate for a family, for something he’s never had but most of all he’s desperate for Draco. He could have had a family with Ginny right after the war, but he didn’t. He knew it wasn’t right, so he broke up with her. He had been so right to wait, because what he found with Draco was worth it. Even though he didn’t manage to make Draco see it.
“Oh yes, I will. You owe me for the lessons, remember?”
Malfoy has an amused smile on his face, he seems very at ease in Potter’s office, lips still swollen and cheeks flushed from their earlier activities. Sam doesn’t know where to look.
"Okay. Now let me tell you something else. Before you tried to scalp and smother me," Draco jokes.
“Of course, you can. But we can stop if it’s too much.”
Draco mimes licking an ice cream and Harry’s mind blanks. Gods. Is Draco trying to kill him? Is that what this is all about?
Aren’t Granger and all the Weasley clan here to help though?
“Why are you helping me?”
See you both tomorrow for lunch as planned.
Soon, everything is cleaned up, and they’re ready to part, this part of their lessons taking longer every time. Harry, on a high from the food and the wine Draco insisted on opening, leans in towards Draco and places a chaste kiss on his cheek. Without leaving Draco time to react, Harry stands back and disapparates.
"How the Hell am I supposed to get through this school year without embarrassing myself? How am I supposed to get through this luncheon?!"
Also, I know it’s been like 6 months since I’ve updated literally any of my fics, but unfortunately I’ve been a) stressed from school and b) in a huge block for everything.
Harry smiled and tucked the note back in to his pocket as he walked towards the Three Broomsticks, where he promised he would meet Neville before the day started.
"Listen, Harry, I know that you're all upset because Draco is a professor here, but you're going to have to toughen up and stop sulking around about it. He's here to stay, so get over yourself, and start acting like a real teacher again," she said, putting the bottle of firewhiskey down on his coffee table. "So here are your options: You either drink this entire bottle of firewhiskey with me and get plastered, or you can tell me what the hell is wrong with you
"I honesty didn't believe you could be so reckless! Four students reported hearing you shouting at Malfoy in the corridors three nights ago, and now, I hear from Argus that he caught you drunk in the school grounds last night with Granger! What has gotten into you? Did you not understand the depth of our conversation on the first day of school?"
"Oh really? Who? I didn't know Slughorn was retiring," Harry said through a mouthful of muffin.
I'm sorry— I can't do this anymore.
"Oh, please, Harry. Don't go on pretending that it's so horrible— we all saw you staring at Malfoy during our school years."
"Uh, no. What are you talking about?"
"Bye! Love you," Hermione said as she walked out the door.
Harry held out his hand, reaching for the firewhiskey. "Fine," he said.
"It wasn't me who was experimenting— you can't tell anyone that I told you this!" Hermione said with a pointed look as they set the curtain rod down and slid off the drapes.
"Byrne..." Malfoy said with a tone of warning. "Don't make me change my mind."
"Harry, no. It's not your fault. Sometimes things just happen," Hermione said, putting an arm around Harry's shoulders.
“I fucking hate you, Malfoy,” Harry said as his knee fell in between Draco’s
"I mean I love the bloke, I hope he does well, but... well, he's quite clumsy, and very forgetful. I just hope that he doesn't forget to give a patient their medicine."
"That sounds great, I've got a delivery coming today as well, but Grindylows are not nearly as nice as books."
legs. Harry kissed Draco’s lips roughly. “I fucking hate you with every fibre of my being,” he repeated, glaring into his eyes before pushing himself off of Draco. “Get out of my head!” He shouted before turning around and marching towards his office, leaving Draco dumbstruck in the dark, empty corridor.
I love you.
"Minerva! What happened? What "crisis?" You've been so busy chastising me that you didn't tell me what is going on!"
"Are we going or not? I've got a class to teach in an hour, and I would appreciate a shower so that my students don't smell the gallon of alcohol that I consumed last night."
didn't do anything wrong."
"That's a wonderful idea. I'll leave you to do that, I must see Professor Granger."
Luna rolled her eyes and sat down in her seat on the opposite side of Ginny, her cheeks flushed.
As Hermione turned away from Harry, he saw her smile to herself. Harry let out an over dramatic gasp. "You're not dating Parkinson, are you? Why is it that most of my friends are dating one of Malfoy's friends?"
"You're the one who left! Don't go on acting so high and mighty! You should have seen this coming!"
"Goodnight, Harry."
"That's right. First Defence teacher to have the job for over one schoolyear in the past fifty years. I hope it stays that way."
"Of course! Who else is going to take care of my plants while I'm away? It's not like we have any roommates. And most of them are for the healers at St. Mungo's. They rely on them for their antidotes and medicines."
"I meant as students, you nitwit."
"Oh, dear, I'm fine. Are you ready for school? It's your second year teaching, right?"
"Oh, sorry to bother you, Harry," said the voice of Neville from the other side of his desk as Harry placed another book onto the large pile that had accumulated on his desk.
"That's true. Potionsmaking is solely for the single-minded. Granger's got too many things on her plate."
"I suppose you're right."
Hermione must've been wrong, because it looked to Harry as though Draco Malfoy was flirting with another man.
As he emerged from the spiral staircase, he crashed into another body, sending them flailing to the ground, and forcing Harry to close his eyes and clutch his stomach to prevent himself from projectile vomiting all over his victim.
Harry opened the container and smoke came out, rolling off the cranberry muffins as if they had just come out of the oven. "Thank you! They look wonderful," Harry said as he lifted one out of the container and set it down on a napkin as he closed the container. "So what did you want to meet about?" Harry asked before biting into the muffin.
"Harry— would you just listen to me?! This is not your fault! And do you honestly think that it's too late? Have you been paying attention?"
"Oh dear, well you must not know a lot about books, then," Irma laughed. "Ask Hermione, she'll tell you all about how treacherous books can be-- well, you remember that Monster Book of Monsters, don't you?"
Harry huffed before continuing to call after Draco. "Because I did-- I do-- love you, I mean."
"No room. We've got a whole greenhouse at home, there's no way I would be able to fit it in my quarters, and I don't want the students touching them. Sorry, I have to go use the loo, if you'll excuse me..."
"Hello Miss Byrne. I expect that the responsibilities of being Quidditch captain and being a N.E.W.T. student have you under a lot of pressure?" Harry asked.
"Sure, one minute." Luna disappeared back into the flat and Harry heard her murmur something to Ginny.
"It means that Draco told Pansy and I about what happened, and it didn't sound good on either of your parts."
"I think it gives them a bit of character, don't you?"
Malfoy took the napkin from Harry and for a quick second, almost as though Harry had imagined it, he smiled. "Thank you, Potter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do before the celebration tonight." Malfoy gestured towards the door, and Harry nodded his head curtly before exiting.
Draco came to a full stop. The room got colder as, with a blank face, Draco turned to face Harry,  his eyes red and rimmed with tears, and said: "Do me a favour and leave me alone."
"Hello, Harry, how are you? Ready for the little devils yet?"
"Ron doesn't have his keys, I was wondering if you could give me Ginny's pair."
"Hermione-- there are tons of other professors here. If something happens, we'll be able to handle it."
Harry sighed. "For fuck's sake, Ronald. Alright, thank you, Luna. I'm sorry for bothering you so late."
As Harry looked behind him, he saw Luna and a slightly-more-sober Ginny returning from the washroom. Ginny had a satisfied smile on her face, and when they returned to the table, she turned to Harry and Blaise. "She shagged me in there," she smirked, her thumb over her shoulder, pointing in the general direction of the washrooms.
"They're inside. Ginny brought hers with her."
let Malfoy ruin this school year.
"Well, that's why McGonagall made me Transfiguration professor, and not you. Now what do you plan to do about these drapes?"
"Oh, it's no problem. I always keep a stash of ingredients in my cupboard. Come on, I'll show you," Malfoy replied.
As Harry led his students down to the edge of the forest, he heard many complaints. They all moaned about being too cold and needing to get a thicker cloak if they were going to spend more time outside of the castle. Harry rolled his eyes and placed a heating charm on his cloak before continuing to lead his students down to the forest. Once they had reached the edge, he waited for Hagrid to arrive with his students. Then they would travel in one large pack towards the small bog that housed the Kappa.
"Er— no, sorry, Dra— Professor Malfoy, I was just walking by and I swear there was this— this gust of wind that was so strong it knocked the mug right out of my hand!" Harry swore internally— how had he ended up with terrible lying skills after getting out of so many dangerous situations each year?
Harry spit out his drink as he covered Ginny's mouth with his hand. The entire table fell silent, and he and Draco quickly met eyes before turning their now-crimson faces away from each other. Luna stood up and held her girlfriend by the shoulders. "Come on, Gin, I think you've had too much to drink." Luna helped Ginny stand up and guided her towards the bathroom.
"Oh, I don't think I could ever forget that book," Harry chuckled. "It still haunts my nightmares."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Fine. Meet me in my office later," he replied, matching Malfoy's volume.
"Better than your best, Potter. I don't want a single complaint for the rest of the year!" McGonagall gave Harry a pointed look as she backed out of the classroom. "Better than your best!" She called out one more time before leaving Harry alone with his mounds of books.
"Oh, sorry, Ha-- Professor Potter," Draco said as he grabbed on to Harry shoulders in attempt to stop him from falling. Their eyes met and for a moment Harry forgot where he was.
"You'd better, Potter. I don't care if you defeated the darkest sorcerer of your time, if you give me so much as one reason to believe that you're not fit for this job--"
"No, dear, we're just going to sober you up. Come on, take my arm."
"All the same, a muffin's a muffin," Malfoy said before grinning to himself as if he had made some clever joke. "So Neville, Theo tells me that you're teaching him how to garden," he said.
"Oh, no. We're getting along quite well, actually," Harry said with a pointed look towards Draco as Neville slid back into the booth.
"Er— happy birthday?" Harry said, unsure as to why Professor McGonagall was in such a good mood.
Harry groaned. "I don't want to talk about him right now. I just had to endure breakfast with him. I don't even want to
"He hasn't got classes until noon, so he's sleeping in. Honestly, don't you ever pay attention? He literally mentioned this at least three times during the dinner."
Harry smiled softly at the memory. It was years ago, nearly a year after the war had ended, and he and Draco had started dating about two months prior. Harry grabbed the napkin and left his classroom, taking the moving staircases towards the dungeons.
"Only because he was up to no good!"
"Beats me," Blaise grinned. "I hope he doesn't trip over one of his patients." Blaise's teeth shined brighter than pearls as he let out a low chuckle, despite having been sipping on red wine for the past hour, and Harry felt himself involuntarily swooning.
"So do I, dear. I think Neville's been waiting for you. Is there anything I can get you?"
Harry watched Hermione blankly, not believing his own ears. Draco Malfoy, possible the one true love of his life, had been staring at him longingly? It was unbelievable. Harry couldn't accept it: what Harry had done, making Draco feel unloved, hiding him from his friends, that was unforgivable. There was no way on earth that Draco Malfoy could forgive him for all that he had put him through.
,' and they moved me to the third bedroom."
Minerva smiled and nodded her head.
Please. I know the spacing is weird on this chapter, just please bear with me. I’ve been writing on my phone lately :(
"Yes, sir."
"Anytime, Byrne. Now off you go, finish that essay for Professor Malfoy."
"Great, Harry. Thank you, I've got to go owl Ginny and Luna."  Harry went back to sorting through his books as Neville left, not noticing Professor McGonagall's presence until she cleared her throat.
Harry stepped back from the door and put his hands down at his side, forgetting that he was holding a mug full of tea. It fell to the floor and tea and glass spilled everywhere. Harry cursed himself as he heard shuffling within the classroom and bent down to the broken cup. He pulled out his wand as Draco came to the door, Henry standing not too far behind him.
"Deal," Harry said as Hermione handed over the bottle. He unscrewed the cap and took a long swig, downing a quarter of the bottle. When the rim left his lips, he started coughing.
Harry pushed the door open and walked in silently. "Er-- sorry to bother you, Dra-- Malfoy, but I just wanted to return this. I forgot about it, and then today, when I was going through my books, I found it tucked away. I thought you would like it back."
Draco turned back around and marched off, leaving Harry deserted in the corridor.
Harry got to his feet and used his hands to brush the dirt off of his pants. "Pardon?" He asked, unsure of what the headmistress meant.
"Wait— I'm sorry, I can't do this."
The sorting ceremony was very eventful, and the meal was exceptional, as always. Not to mention that Malfoy kept purposefully bumping knees with Harry. Hardy found his heart pounding by the end of the meal.
"Hello Ma-- Irma," Harry said.
Neville shook his head. "No, my gran's neighbour did."
Blaise pushed Harry onto the bed almost immediately. It was large, soft, and covered with a dark green duvet. Harry's breath hitched as Blaise kissed and bit his way down his neck, leaving a trail of hickeys that he would have to remind himself to cover up later. Blaise didn't bother with the buttons on Harry's shirt— he simply ripped it off, popping a few buttons in doing so.
"Let's," Blaise agreed as Harry placed his money on the counter. "Keep the change," he told Rosamerta, not taking his eyes off of Blaise. They stumbled out of the Three Broomsticks, Harry gripping on to Blaise's arm as they apparated two of them back to their flat.
"You can defeat a Kappa by tricking it into bowing. The water from its head will spill out and weaken it."
Harry sighed. "Thank you. Seriously— I had a great time tonight, I'm just... not ready yet. I can't move on— not yet."
"Quarter past twelve. Lunch just ended."
Harry's chest flushed. "I am," he said. "I have my sixth years next class, I'll be sure to congratulate them. How did the N.E.W.T. students do?"
Malfoy is confused for a second, then blushes all the way up to his hair. If Harry thought Malfoy was fit before, the sight of someone so poised and self-assured, all flushed and embarrassed is simply marvelous. It does things to his cock it shouldn’t be doing.
“This isn’t working.”
(Muggles),
(HufflePuff),
In any case, our home is always open to you - as a Black you shouldn’t have any trouble getting through the wards. I think Draco would be excited for you to meet Jamie too.
Draco leans in and kisses Harry softly. He wants to give Harry the time to get back into it. To be the one to lead them.
Sam feels like they’ve been walking for hours when a large stag appears next to them. It stops next to Weasley and starts speaking in Potter’s voice.
“Actually,
She finally speaks, in a voice roughened by age and lack of use.
You and Little James make me happier than I ever thought I'd be.
Yours,
“We’re wizards, Draco. If anyone can see the future, that would be us, not some old wrinkled lady in a caravan!”
rejected
“With Blaise.”
It has been a year since our first kiss. You have no idea - or maybe a little by now - how long I had wanted to kiss you by then.
It's now Draco's turn to be puzzled.
"Malfoy."
.” He says, voice drowned in Harry’s whimpers.
! You broke my heart and then just left!!”
Draco
"I've hurt you. Twice. I can't …" Harry takes a shaky breath before continuing. "I'm sorry I'm not what you want, I tried. I wanted to please you, so much. I don't know what I'm doing Draco, I can't give you what you need." Harry screws his eyes shut in a vain attempt to hold back the tears.
Draco
“Harry? Are you there?”
With a crack, Marcus Disapparates. Weasley and Potter briefly look startled, before putting their game faces back on.
To bed?” Harry barely has time to nod before Draco apparates them in the bedroom. In under a minute, they’re both naked and Draco’s straddling Harry’s hips. He lightly strokes Harry’s chest.
"Is the sex not good? For you?"
D. L. Malfoy
So they set the table, Draco pointing and naming utensils. At some point, Harry goes to grab a fork at the same time as Draco does and their hands brush. It’s almost nothing, just a faint warmth against his skin, a softness he has only dreamed of so far. He wishes it had lasted more than a second. Draco keeps moving around, seemingly unaffected, but Harry catches the little glances the blond throws his way.
Draco leaps and presses himself against Harry. They meet in a searing kiss, teeth biting. Harry can only moan into Draco's mouth. The relief of Draco's mouth on his own is so great, he physically sags. Draco catches him in strong arms.
” Harry chuckles and presses a hand to the back of his neck.
I actually didn’t know about you and Ginevra.I’m sorry that I assumed. It does seem to me like you have everything under control in her absence though.
Draco!!
Harry says nothing.
"No, no Harry, love. It's not like that. Our sex life is very satisfying, you're a very generous lover. It's just something different that I think I might like."
The days that follow are a blur of interrogations of Scorpius’s friends and teachers. They review the list Malfoy gave them of his enemies but nothing comes out of it. Sam can sense Potter’s frustration growing. After the tenth door slammed and fifth accidental fire set, Potter starts keeping to himself in his office, and Deputy Head Auror Weasley handles the communication with the team.
Each duo enters the Forest, wands drawn in front of them.
Harry is startled by Malfoy’s pointy elbow in his ribs.
Malfoy's smirk falls for a second. If Sam hadn't been looking so closely he would have missed it with how fast Malfoy recovered.
Love,
Draco
Draco takes his mission to heart. He starts with basic ‘getting to know each other’ questions - in French of course - which is funny because they’ve known each other so long. Harry learns how to speak about his job, his family - the Weasleys, not the Dursleys, never the Dursleys, and his hobbies. The most interesting thing about that is how he gets Draco to answer these questions as well.
“Mmm, Harry?”
“I distinctly remember you saying
The perp smirks in response and Sam knows they’re going to be here a while.
“Okay. Show me then.”
Harry
Malfoy gathers himself too quickly for Harry’s liking and drawls. “Stop being a prat, I only meant that you should follow me to the study, I’ve prepared some visual materials that I think should help.
Harry wants to probe, he wants to understand Malfoy’s motivations. It’s not that they’re still enemies, because they’re not - if they ever really were - it’s just that Harry’s never really made an effort to be more than acquaintances. Malfoy had never seemed to want to either. They run into each other pretty regularly as Malfoy works in the same service as Hermione. What he does there, Harry has no idea, but if Hermione is friendly with him then he probably must do a good job at it. And well, Malfoy isn’t the sort of bloke you don’t notice - never was. After the war, he was all skinny and tired-looking, but now...
Draco turns to look at Harry.
“That’s convenient.” He says through gritted teeth.
"Harry", he says loudly, "Harry, listen to me."
Dear Potter,
"Yes." Draco's voice is clear and steady, no doubt in it.
Draco
Of course, Harry immediately searched the name and found out it was a pretty high scale French restaurant, a muggle one which had surprised him immensely. Not that he still thought Draco to be prejudiced against them, but he thought the blond would be more comfortable in a wizarding establishment.
“Don’t, I’ll come in a second. I want to come on your cock only.”
“Malfoy, Scorpius has been missing for three days now. I don’t need to remind you that these cases have better chances of being resolved in the first few hours. Anything you can tell us will help, okay? I promise you, we’re taking this very seriously.”
Italy is amazing. The weather is so nice already, Jamie is enjoying it very much. I admit it's rather nice not to be bundled in coats and scarves like we are in London.
Prompt : Parallel
“Dinner?”
Draco’s cheeks redden slightly under Harry’s intensity. Harry knows he can be overwhelming, the way he doesn’t shy away from his feelings compared to how Draco is used to keeping them hidden. But he can’t stop now, he has to go through with it.
“Nervous? To go on a Ferris Wheel?” Draco’s eyebrow is all the way up to his hairline.
Malfoy,
“No, no, Harry, I’m glad you did. I wanted you to.”
Draco moves around in order to watch Harry's face. He seems a little embarrassed all of sudden, and Harry fears for the worst.
“Should we get them a present?”
When he's all strapped in, Harry praises him softly.
He then lowers his head and licks around Harry’s nipples.
Prompt : Curiosity
The tender look on Draco’s face when he speaks with Teddy would be enough to make Harry fall for him, if he wasn’t already so far gone.
“Of course
Neville scratches his ear, then the back of his neck. He’s obviously not sure he should say what he meant to say.
”, Draco murmurs.
“Well, I think… Was it “
“I didn’t care? Merlin fuck. Way to rewrite history, no?”
“Harry, I - “, Draco starts. Then, just when the wheel starts moving again and begins its descent, he whispers in a broken voice “No.”
about this."
“Mmm, tomorrow? I thought we could cook. Maybe something from that recipe book we bought today?”
"Trust you, huh?"
!” Of course, Malfoy looks amazing. His clothes are not even that fancy, they just fall perfectly on his frame, the greys and blues highlighting his striking eyes and pale complexion. Could it be that Malfoy also wanted to look good for Harry?
Four hours later, everybody’s dead tired but still going through the plan one more time. The suspect finally cracked sometime around midnight. Potter, Weasly, Marcus and Sam are cooped up in the Head Auror’s office to review their rescue strategy before launching the assault. Apparently, two members of Woodward’s group managed to escape arrest and are now withholding Scorpius, in the Forbidden Forest of all places.
“You’ve had five months since Draco.” Harry knows he’s not being fair. He did shut Draco out after that resounding ‘no’. He refused to talk to anyone for weeks, shut down his floo and sent back owls unopened.
“Today,
I'm looking forward to meeting Little James as Mr Malfoy calls him.
I am free all day tomorrow, if you’re available. I could floo over and bring the biscuits I mentioned at Fortescue’s?
“You don’t actually believe any of this, do you?” Harry finally asks, because Draco is being unusually quiet next to him.
"This is hilarious, wait until I tell
Where there was animosity and scorn a few days ago, Sam sees vulnerability and concern. Potter has a hand on Malfoy’s arm, and speaks in a low voice. They have a hushed conversation, while Marcus scowls at Malfoy and Weasley observes in silence.
Thank you for the new stationary and quills, they're amazing. Can you tell I used them for this? My writing is sharper than it ever was.
Is everything alright? I tried to floo yesterday after you missed our
"No that's not what this is about. I would be willing, always. It's more about me surrendering to you, submitting?" Draco didn't mean to make it a question, he's just a little uncomfortable saying the words he repeated beforehand.
It’s dark when they leave. Harry’s almost sure Draco is as sad as he is that they have to part. Once at the Apparition Point, they stop and shuffle on their feet for a minute.
Harry can feel the soft puffs of Draco’s breath when he talks with how close they’re standing.
“Fuck,
“It’s all thanks to you, you know. I was getting nowhere before you agreed to help, I really appreciate it.”
Draco nods shyly.
Harry grins widely. “Perfect, see you for our next lesson then, Draco.”
“I was scared.”
Finally, Potter leaves Malfoy’s side and comes back to the group.
mean?"
Love always,
Harry knows that one, from that terrible song they sang with Teddy, so at once he drops to his knees and looks up at Draco, waiting for further instructions.
meant cabbage?"
Jamie really seemed to like you too. It was a little strange seeing him in somebody else’s arms. Except for Molly and Arthur sometimes, only Ginny and I really hold him. Attached is the picture I took of you two. I hope it’s okay that I kept a copy for
Harry looks pointedly at Draco’s crotch, not wanting to say the words.
Sam doesn’t have time to think of a clever answer, Potter is already halfway to his office. A smile breaks on Sam’s face. An interview? An actual case related interview? With the Head Auror as the prime handler? Sam hurries to gather some parchment and quills and joins the little group waiting by the interrogation room.
The first thrust of Draco’s hips has them both groaning loudly. Harry’s cock is leaking on his stomach and he knows that he’ll come at the first touch. Draco doesn’t seem to fare any better. He’s breathing deeply and barely moving inside Harry.
Worriedly,
Perhaps we should stop going from one place to the other?
“Yes.", Harry states with a more assured voice, "I want - I want a life with you, a family, I want everything, forever.”
“Oh. Oh! Merlin, fuck. This is embarrassing. You meant
Malfoy,
“You did?”
D. L. Malfoy
Prompt : parallel
Yours,
Then I survived, thanks to you and your mother, and still, I didn’t think I would ever know love and happiness. When James was born, I had pretty much accepted that my love for him and his love for me would be enough.
Affectionately,
A knock on his cubicle wall startles Sam. He’s surprised to see Head Auror Potter when he raises his head.
"Like what?"
Harry repeats the word softly. “
Draco can't hold back, he takes Harry into his arms and rocks him slightly. It's been a while since he'd had to do that - Harry hardly ever has nightmares anymore. He pets Harry's hair and whispers reassuring nonsense in his ear.
They don't mention it again until three weeks later when Draco comes home and finds himself pinned against a wall.
“You did it again!”
Prompt "Hold It Against Me"
Harry looks at the picture Draco's pointing at in the book. It does look nothing like a cabbage indeed.
“Mmm?”
Harry, what should I do? Obviously I don't want to marry Astoria but… I see you with James and I want it for myself, you know? What if this is my only chance?
When the interview is finally over, they are all exhausted and agree to call it a day. Except Potter locks himself in his office with the content of the case file and Sam’s notes. The case really is complex, no clues were left at the scene, and Scorpius seems like a good kid. Even Malfoy, once he relaxed a little, looks like he’s living a very quiet, almost recluse life. He’s sharp, witty and so damn sarcastic but nothing that would warrant getting his son kidnapped.
They look at each other above the kitchen counter. Draco is leaning against the fridge, in a seemingly relaxed stance. Harry knows better though. He sees the tension in his shoulders, the wariness in his eyes. They probably should try to talk. It’s been several months already and they share the same group of friends. They’re bound to run into each other and Harry’s so sick of not talking to Draco. He misses him more than he could ever express, even if his heart still breaks each morning he wakes up alone.
. Go be happy with
“Draco, what is this exactly?”
Harry covers his ears with his hands and closes his eyes in frustration. “Stop saying that, fuck!”
, please Draco.”
Harry
"Let's take it slow okay? Work up to it?"
Anyway, I had a great time at Fortescue’s. I loved seeing all the kids buying their stuff for Hogwarts. Can you believe that in 10 years or so, it will be me and Jamie? I’m sorry we had to leave abruptly. Now that he’s sleeping, Jamie really is very strict with his schedule.
"Salazar fuck!", Draco exclaims. These are the last actual words he pronounces. Soon, he's pushed face down into the mattress and Harry's pounding into him relentlessly. Harry's been on the verge of coming since they kissed in Luna and Ginny's kitchen, he can't take it slow. Draco seems to appreciate it, if the muffled cries coming from him are any indication.
You’re right, I was very grateful for the two nights Jamie decided to sleep. According to the book
Prompt "Back in the saddle"
Malfoy.”
Malfoy!
Prompt "Hope is a heartache"
, yes.” Draco exhales, face buried into Harry’s neck. He slides a hand between them and brushes a thumb across Harry’s cock. At the mere sensation of something against his achingly hard length, Harry comes. The clench of Harry’s ass triggers Draco’s orgasm as well and they’re both lost.
"Don't know, don't care.", Draco replies, right before Apparating them on the front steps of their flat.
“That was twenty minutes ago.”
Before they enter the room to interrogate the first suspect, Sam hears Potter casting a Patronus.
he thinks.
The following day, Sam is finished with his reports and heads over to the Head Auror office to have them signed and filed away. He knocks on the door and enters like always. The sight he’s welcome to isn’t so usual though. Potter has Malfoy backed up against his desk, hands in his hair, lips tightly pressed against the blond’s. Sam drops his files in surprise and the couple springs apart.
Sam turns his back on them to give them some privacy. He spots Potter and Weasley in the doorframe. Potter’s eyes are focused on Malfoy and Scorpius. The expression on his face is unmistakable. Love, adoration, longing.  It should be more surprising but actually makes a lot of sense.
Draco wants to tell him that it's alright but he's too preoccupied with getting his breathing under control. The silence is long enough for Harry to spiral into a frenzy.
Draco raises his head from the recipe book - they're making
“We’re not fucking! And what if we were, huh? You made it clear you didn’t care.”
They visit more stores than Harry’s ever visited in one trip. They browse for books at Flourish and Blotts, Draco explaining in French what he’s looking for. They spend an hour at Madame Malkin’s because Draco needs new dress robes. They’re nervous at first, both thinking about the first time they met, at that very same spot, how everything would have been different had Harry shaken Draco’s hand or had the latter not been so… pretentious. But when Draco emerges from the dressing room, covered in rich, silk robes perfectly fitted for his lean silhouette, Harry starts sweating. Oblivious to his discomfort, Draco keeps asking his opinion on different robes, then capes. Harry gets by with muttered “
When the girls said goodnight to Harry, Draco decided he would stay for a while longer. They had been keeping him so busy that he had less time to text Harry on an evening than when he was working. And wasn’t
“That’s what she said,” quipped Greg, to a mixture of groans and giggles.
“You get to see that gorgeous man of yours,” Josh teased, with a smile in his voice.
“Just because you’re not interested in corruption and deceit at the ministry, doesn’t mean that everyone else isn’t.” Lavender replied in an icy tone.
king of the bores,” Pansy said, a teasing twinkle in her eyes.
“Who has the takings from last time?” enquired Neville, prompting Hermione to delve into her handbag for an envelope of muggle notes.
“I suppose, as long as you’ve got Josh going in to feed and water him,” Pansy shot back.
The group cheered at that; it was one of their favourite games. “Who is the target?” asked Harry.
The thing is, once I started talking, I found it hard to stop. I was crying within the first few minutes, and barely managed to get anything out. With each session I began to cry less and talk more, and the more I talked the better I felt. My therapist, who I still see to this day, helped me to figure out that some of the awful opinions I had about myself were wrong. That some of the things I thought other people felt about me were wrong. She showed me the ways in which the things that had happened to me had shaped my thinking. Essentially, she showed me the ways my brain was fucked up and helped me to figure out how to un-fuck it. It was the most important turning point for me.
“Course darling.” Pansy joined them, after slipping out of her tan wedges and chucking her sunglasses on the sideboard.
“Well it’s nice to understand some of it at least. Now I would like to say something to you, and I would like you to be quiet and listen until I’ve finished. Can you do that Jamie?” Asked Harry.
Kicking his shoes off in the hallway, Harry knocked gently on James’ bedroom door. When there was no answer, he told James he was coming in, before opening the door. He found James curled up on his bed, facing the wall. This was not an unusual position for Harry to find his son in, whose angry outbursts were usually followed by shame and bitterness. Harry sat down on the bed next to James and started rubbing his back, like he had done a thousand times since the boy was small. He continued this for long minutes, knowing the key to his child was to wait in silence until he was ready to talk. After a while James rolled over on his bed, facing towards his father but refusing to meet his eye. Harry moved his hand to James’ head, running his fingers through his son’s messy curls.
Well, Jamie came along, and I was besotted from the moment I laid eyes on him. Ginny had been back and forth over whether to be involved with bringing him up all through her pregnancy, but once she saw him, she realised she wanted to be his mum. Those first few years were non-stop. Gin was away most of the time with the team, so she was only really helping for a couple of months in the summer. The rest of the time there was just me, raising my boy, and working full time as an auror. I was lucky to have Molly and Andromeda to look after him while I worked, and my days passed in a blur of crack of dawn wake ups and ferrying him back and forth around my shifts. On my days off I had Ted as well as Jamie; I was adamant Ted would be part of our family and not grow up as alone as I did. This worked well for me, or so I thought at the time, as my days were so full, I could fall into bed and be asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. There was no time to think about the war, or to mourn, to consider the consequences of my sexuality, or to sort through my feelings about my horrific childhood. That was the way I liked it. I was barely managing to get us washed, dressed, and fed each day, and lived in a constant state of adrenaline highs and lows.
“Have any of you ever thought about how fun it would be to tell a muggle about our world?” he asked.

“Hello, you absolute fucking stud.”
“Alright you vipers. He wasn’t
“Shut up,” James directed towards Lavender, annoyance evident in his voice.
Harry groaned, begging Draco to drop that topic. He sent Ted to lunch, with instructions to be back in an hour to cover Eric’s lunch break. With two hours free before his assistant was back in the hot shop, Harry offered to take Draco out for lunch, which of course he agreed to. Although apprehensive, Draco agreed to trust Harry to take him for a meal on Diagon Alley. There was a popular new Vietnamese place that Harry Potter could get them into with no notice. Harry took Draco upstairs to the mezzanine where he had a quick shower, changing out of his sweaty glassblowing clothes and into something slightly smarter. He apologised for his attire, explaining that he only kept a few items of clothing at work in case of last-minute plans. Draco kept the fact that he looked completely delectable in his loose t-shirt, scruffy blue jeans and Vans to himself.
Harry laughed at that. Draco often had the words and the tone he needed to pull him out of a funk.
Harry sighed, desperately trying to get a handle on himself. He knew there was no way Draco would ever want to be with him. He knew it. Draco was a six foot tall blonde Adonis. Harry was scarred and broken and lived a million miles away. That did not make it any easier to imagine Draco being with someone else. He understood Draco was joking about Charlie, just as Harry had been, but that did not stop that tight ball of jealousy forming in the pit of his stomach. He tried to brush those thoughts aside and enjoy being in the same time zone as Draco for once.
“Yeah right. See ya boss.”
++++++++++++++
When Draco arrived into Harry’s workshop he was gobsmacked. Harry was there with a long metal pole twisting through his hands, sweat drenching through his t-shirt and slicking his hair. His skin was glistening, muscles on his arms, shoulders, and back rippling with exertion. On the end of the pole was a large blob of glass, beginning to take the shape of a toned male torso, arching its back. Ted murmured to Draco to stay within a rectangle taped onto the floor, before heading over towards Harry. Throughout the process Teddy and Harry shared instructions with each other, but none of the words made sense. Draco allowed himself to be captivated by the process, watching as the two men passed the pole between them, heating the glass in a large furnace, sitting down to work it with tools and moving it onto another pole. When the form of the man was looking clear and detailed enough to be finished, Harry took the pole, rolling it along the arms of the wooden chair he worked at, and started waving his hand over the piece while quietly murmuring a spell. The clear glass started to glow from the inside with the same ethereal, enchanting light the piece Ginny received for her birthday had. Once Harry finished his spell weaving, he shouted for Ted, who approached the bench wearing a large pair of dragonhide gloves, like giant oven mitts. Teddy held his hands under the glass which was still attached to the pole. Harry dripped water on the glass at the pole end, tapped the pole with a pair of what looked like giant tweezers, and the glass fell off into Teddy’s waiting hands. Ted hastily took the piece to a large metal kiln, with Harry opening the door allowing him to put it on a shelf inside, before closing the kiln quickly.
The kitchen was quiet as the curry was consumed, aside from Radio Two playing quietly in the background and compliments being made to the chef. Pansy was right, Draco felt at peace - more so than he had in a long time. He had a wonderful group of muggle friends back home, who also cooked for each other regularly. He had thought they were giving him all he needed, but in comparison he was noticing how much of himself he held back in his interactions with those he referred to as his chosen family. He often felt like a fraud around them; he knew they could not truly love him without knowing all that he was - the darkness as well as the light. He reflected that no one could ever be as close to him as those that had lived through the worst of him and loved him despite that.
Ron cleared his throat loudly and the chatter died down, all eyes turning to him. “Right then you ‘orrible lot. It’s been too long since we last managed to get together like this, and now we have two blissful weeks ahead of us. I know some of us have real jobs, and we can’t always palm our revolting kids off on those too stupid to say no…”
Draco sighed around his reply. “I will.”
“Gin!” Draco exclaimed, while Pansy gave her a sympathetic smile.
Take care
“And deprive all those young witches of their wank material? I think not.” Draco watched as Harry buried his head into a pillow, and feeling sorry for him, changed the subject. “DILFs aside, it’s great that you finally have an explanation for some of his rage, and perhaps we can do something about it now.”
“Potter?” He held up the bottle to his friend.
“Ugh, you’ll put me off my food. Speaking of which, where’s this curry we were promised?” Ginny asked as she polished off the last of the starter.
Harry took the glass off him, putting them both on the sideboard before pulling Draco into a hug, breathing in his delicious scent. Draco held on for a few sweet moments before pulling back to look Harry in the eye. “You are truly the bravest man I have ever known, and not only for the things you’re famous for.”
“I’ll tell mum you said that,” Ginny interrupted.
Harry went to the toilet and brushed his teeth, checking himself in the mirror while he was in there. He slept naked, but usually he put a t-shirt on when video calling with Draco. It was hot as hell tonight though, in the midst of an August heatwave, and after overheating in the hot shop all afternoon Harry could not face putting clothes on again. He decided that Draco would have to tolerate his bare shoulders this once, and surely, he was in the same position himself tonight. The cheeky part of his brain hoped so.
++++++++++++++
“How did he smell?”
“Draco-” Harry started, before the moment was broken by a muggle stumbling through the door to the gents.
“Kindly fuck off, the lot of you,” Harry retorted, earning him a stern look from Molly. “Draco is a sad middle-aged pouf as well and he gets classy reporting in bloody Vogue magazine. I’m stuck with Lavender Weasley for Witch sodding Weekly.” He added in mock horror.
“Oh God, Sam!” exclaimed Ginny, with a mixture of groans and giggles from the others. Harry felt a blush rising up his cheeks.
“Stop changing the subject you menace. I haven’t seen you in a over a year, I’ve barely heard from you in months, I have to get my intel from bottom feeders like Perez Bastarding Hilton, and you come here and still evade my questions!” Pansy’s voice seemed to raise in volume with each word.
He took a big gulp of his drink then carried on, “When I woke up, the pain was like nothing you could even imagine, and unrelenting; worse than a crucio from Voldemort. They pumped me full of pain killers and I spent weeks in and out of consciousness. I was too out of it to even ask about James and Ted. When the pain had started to ease, they reduced the dose, which allowed me to think clearly again. That was the worst moment of my life. I was trapped, immobile in a hospital bed, unable to look after the kids, and with nothing but my own mind to torture myself with. I was awful to everyone who came into the room. My mind was replaying memories I’d repressed for years, plus I was sick with worry about the kids; I thought my body was ruined and I’d never be able to look after them. I was convinced Ginny would give Jamie up for adoption...”, at this, Harry broke down, tears streaming down his face. Draco pulled him in for a hug and sat quietly rubbing his back until he calmed down.
“I’d rather be single,” joined Harry, plonking some fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce on the table as he sat back down. “Remember when I was seeing Sam? I came this close to telling him about it all. He just couldn’t reconcile me with a man who would send his kid to boarding school. Glad I never did now.”
Harry could not help the slow smile that spread across his face. He knew the book was a lost cause if Draco was available to talk to. Folding over the corner of the page and setting his book on the bedside table, Harry settled back against the headboard and typed his reply.
Harry was poised to write and looked to Ginny for instruction. “Right then, one sickle for each, no laughing or giving the game away or you will have to have a shot penalty. Tequila I think.”
Ginny stood up with a mischievous grin on her face, raised her glass to the group and downed her Pimms to enthusiastic applause and whoops. She smacked her lips and gave an exaggerated sigh. “Ooh what rules shall we play tonight then?” she rubbed her hands together gleefully, her grin turning more to an evil smirk. “Harry’s banker.” He nodded his agreement. “One sickle for swearing or pointing, down your drink for right handed drinking. Innuendo bingo I reckon.”
The pair exited the portkey terminal, where multiple muggle photographers were waiting on the concourse. They shouted Draco’s name and bellowed intensely personal questions, before Pansy grabbed his hand and rushed him and his bags into a waiting black cab. Pansy parroted her address to the driver before relaxing back into her seat, sighing as she leaned her head against Draco’s shoulder.
“We are just friends, and I’d thank you two to not make things awkward,” he huffed in reply.
Harry chuckled before replying, “Oh you met Eric, he’s an interesting kid. I’m sure he has a crush on Ted; he keeps trying to come to lunch with us. Doesn’t seem to understand that we can’t all leave the building at the same time, not if we want to make any sales.”
Harry continued stroking his son’s hair, and minutes later James continued quietly. “She did that memorial thing, you know, the spotlight on war heroes rubbish. She put all about Ted’s parents in there. No one at school really knew his dad was a werewolf. Then that stupid article comes out and there’s copies of it going round school. People bullying Teddy about it constantly. Asking if he’s gonna bite them, refusing to sit by him, leaving a gap around him at the dinner table. Beating him up about it, calling him a freak and a pup and a were-baby. He wouldn’t tell anyone what was happening, and no one got caught in the act except me for fighting against them. He’s too much of a Hufflepuff to do anything about it, they just walked all over him. Dad, they made his last year at Hogwarts hell. That’s why he didn’t end up with an apprenticeship or job, he could barely get through his exams as it was. He made me promise not to tell though. I can’t forgive her for it. I can’t move past it. She causes so much shit for us all and is completely unapologetic about it. Ted might not be a Potter or a Weasley but he’s my brother and he doesn’t deserve to be treated like shit. He might not even manage to get a job now. I know he’s got one with you, but he wants to work with animals. Who is going to take him if they think he’s a rabid wolf?” James let out a shaky sigh, angry tears in his eyes.
The heat of the eye contact built before Draco looked away, though neither of them could keep their eyes off each other for long.
If you've persevered this far then I assume you like the story, and I hope you continue to do so.
“Look, I don’t want you to take this the wrong way. I’ve never told anyone how I really feel about it all, and for good reason. It was traumatic for everyone when I was in the coma and everything was so uncertain. I can’t tell them my side when they’ve struggled to get over it themselves.” Harry shrugged uncertainly.
indeed.
The cab pulled over, and Draco hastily paid the driver before nudging Pansy out onto the pavement. He followed Pansy into her shiny apartment building, squeezing into the lift with her and his luggage. He was glad to be able to stay with them for the festivities.
“Must you?” he sighed.
“There is that. However, we had it far harder and look at us now. I was a death eater and you literally died. Now we are both successful business owners, and still in possession of our own teeth no less. He will be fine in the end.”
Pansy cackled at his effort before trying a slightly more believable cockney, “Talking to snakes? Is
“You expect me to believe that abra cadabra is how you kill people?”
One of Harry’s pleasures in life was to cook for his friends, and his food was good enough that they often badgered him into doing so. Having Draco for dinner as well as the regulars encouraged him to make an extra effort. He finished work early to get groceries from Sainsbury’s on his way home, and ensured he stocked up on good wine and beer to enjoy alongside the Thai green curry he had planned. Slipping into a side alley, Harry apparated back to his flat, put the shopping away, and went for a shower. The heatwave was intensifying, with talk of hose pipes bans on the radio in his hot shop that afternoon. Harry was keen to wash the day away before his guests arrived. He dressed in the dark blue jeans Pansy had told him made his arse look “fucking delicious,” and chose a reasonably tight white t-shirt. After ruffling his hopeless hair and making sure he was looking and smelling his best, Harry headed into his kitchen to start dinner.
“So, Draco, do you have a muggle hunk waiting for you back home?” teased Pansy.
“Don’t be thick Draco, it’s not exactly normal to talk each other to sleep at night if you’re
“Well you must know what a MILF is? Everyone knows that”, replied Draco, with a sly smirk on his flawless face.
“Christ knows where he gets his personality from though, that’s nothing to do with me.” Harry muttered.
Draco ended the call, knowing there was no point in arguing with him.
After being flirted with by the enthusiastic young twink manning the gallery, Draco was led out through the back, where there was a small kitchenette and toilet. The gallery manager (was his name Eddie or something?) told him to wait there, so Draco loitered, feeling a little flushed and awkward. Teddy appeared a few moments later, through a seemingly solid wall at the opposite end of the kitchen. He told Draco that only he and Harry could go through the wards to the hot shop, so he would have to grab onto Teddy to travel through the wall. He explained that Harry was in the middle of something he couldn’t put down, and they’d better hurry. Draco grabbed hold of Ted’s hand and together they squeezed through the wall, the sensation reminiscent of apparition.
So, while I do have horrible scars, pain in my joints, and the occasional day I can barely walk, what I have gained far exceeds what I lost.” Harry looked at Draco self-consciously. He hadn’t meant to ramble on for so long.
“Just get on with it, Potter,” Draco pressed.
When Draco arrived at the portkey terminal at Heathrow that afternoon, he was pleased to see his oldest friend Pansy waving at him from the other side of the security check point. He waved back as he submitted his wand for inspection, smile only faltering slightly as the middle-aged security wizard cocked his head to one side and stiffly exclaimed, “Welcome back to the UK Mr… uh… Black”.
“What?” Draco stuttered. “He never told me about a date. I would have left him to it, had I known.”
The sound of his intercom buzzing brought Draco out of his introspection, as he strode over to the door to answer it. His doorman Frank let him know the driver had arrived, so with one last sweeping look over his penthouse, Draco grabbed his little used wand and a bag of galleons from his desk drawer, gathered his bags and went out into the early morning sunshine.
“Oh darling, I always keep Draco up to date with your press coverage, it’s only fair seeing as I show you his.” grinned Pansy. “Also she didn’t come up with Desirable Number One you know, she stole that from me.”
Despite Harry having set up his business nearly a decade ago, Draco had never visited his hot shop. There were many reasons for this, or excuses may be more accurate. Draco usually only managed much shorter visits to the UK, had many familial and friendly commitments, and most importantly, had avoided wizarding London at all costs.
Harry gave him an amused look, and replied, “Forgot your wand?”
Harry paused, eyes wet, then quietly continued, “I know it was awful for them, that’s why I can’t be honest about my feelings surrounding it.”
Harry gave a shy smile, before his bravado won out “Cheers Pans. James tried to help me with it, said I obviously didn’t know what naked birds look like so I could borrow some of his porn mags if I liked.” Harry chuckled. “I said ‘how’d you think I knocked up your mum?’” Harry continued, “He just clamped his hands over his ears, told me I was fucking disgusting and ran from the room. Wish I’d worked out it was that easy to get rid of him sooner.”
“Behave, you’ve always been fabulous.”
“Bar is manic,” stated Harry, “I’ll see if I can flag down a waitress.” He waved over a waitress, who smiled at him flirtatiously. “Can I get a bottle of tequila please, with…” he did a quick head count “eighteen shot glasses. Can you give them a salty rim please?” The waitress blushed and nodded. “Oh, and some lime wedges.”
“Yeah it looks good Uncle Harry,” replied Ted, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. “You want some water?”
“What, left chained to my bed?” drawled Draco, quirking an eyebrow.
“As awkward as being the object of your son’s teenage girlfriend’s affections might be, I can’t say I’m surprised. You’re probably a decade younger than the rest of their parents, and you are a DILF.”
“Your wand? You’ve given up using it?”
“I know, sorry. I didn’t mean it was a completely positive thing to happen. I know everyone was sick with worry; waking up to a plethora of ashen-faced Weasleys is not something to forget in a hurry.” Harry quirked a sheepish smile, momentarily distracting Draco with his irresistible dimple.
Pansy sat back up and turned to face Draco. “Well tonight we are going to the muggle pub that Hermione’s Rex found, the usual gang”.
Harry found himself once again talking through the problems with James. It was good to have had an insight into his son’s mind during their heart to heart the other day, and for once Harry felt he might be getting through to the boy. He told Draco about everything they’d discussed, while Draco patiently listened, and as always, provided a solid shoulder to cry on.
“We should get back,” said Draco, “They will be wondering where we are.”
Hearing the door go, Harry sighed back against his pillow, able to properly relax knowing his son was in for the night. It was only eight o’ clock and still light, so Harry half heartedly attempted to read some of the book Hermione had given him for his birthday. It was a light-hearted muggle tale about a hundred year old man who climbed out the window of his nursing home to go on an adventure, and Harry found himself chuckling along, briefly lost in the story. When his phone buzzed, he looked up to realise it was getting darker, so he drew the curtains and put the bedside lamp on. Harry checked his phone and saw something that never failed to make his stomach lurch: a text from Draco.
“Right,” said Harry, taking the hint.
He pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek, leaving him dumb struck as Draco stepped into the floo, drinking in the sight of his friend one last time before being whisked away through the flames.
jeans. Ginny got four glasses out, while Draco grabbed a bottle of Rioja. He sidled up to Harry and asked, “Got a corkscrew?”
Draco tended to prefer a long, hot shower, and this morning was no exception. He had always taken great care with his appearance, ensuring he used the best products on his skin and hair, and rigidly stuck to his routine. After his shower Draco spent a few minutes looking at himself in the mirror, noticing his skin was still flushed from the heat. He brushed his hair and dried it gently. He preferred to leave it to dry naturally but he knew he was expected at the Weasley’s for lunch and wasn’t sure how much time he had. He was not about to show up at their house with wet hair drying all flyaway. After cleaning his teeth and moisturising, Draco returned to the guest room where he deliberated over what to wear. His fans and friends both thought that he was effortlessly stylish, throwing on an outfit without much consideration and looking immaculate regardless. This was far from reality however, as Draco spent a great deal of time selecting timeless pieces for his wardrobe to ensure he could always put together something spectacular at a moment’s notice. A glance out the window confirmed it was a bright, sunny day, so Draco chose some pale grey skinny jeans and paired them with a tight white v-neck t-shirt. He tucked an arm of sunglasses from his own collection into the neck of his shirt, ran his fingers through his hair, added a leather Vivienne Westwood cuff to his wrist, then decided he would do. Slipping on some black leather high tops, Draco left the bedroom and followed the scent of coffee through to the kitchen.
A whole host of red heads helped to set up the table outside, bringing out dishes of roast chicken, potato salad, accompanying side dishes and various accoutrement until it was practically bowing under the weight of food. If anything, Molly’s tendency towards over-feeding had only increased as the family grew. Draco graciously kissed Molly on either cheek, shook Arthur’s hand and gifted them with the basket of American confectionary they had become partial to over the years. He took his seat next to Harry and called out greetings to his dinner companions.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry isn’t-” Draco started, before being cut off.
++++++++++++++
“Obviously.” Harry poked his tongue out at her. “Who has a pen and paper?” Hermione passed him both out of her bag, which he gratefully took, with a “cheers darling.”
“I understand now,” Draco reassured. “Thank you for telling me.”
“Well that never stopped you before,” pouted Pansy.
“The girls have plied me with alcohol since I got here, something called a monster-in-law?”
“Try to relax and enjoy it ok, weddings are supposed to be fun.”
“I hate that it happened,” said Draco quietly. “The last thing you deserved was to get injured so severely, after everything.”
“Goblins guard your gold?”
A flurry of activity followed, with the girls helping to get bowls and cutlery out while Harry finished off the curry and Draco topped the drinks up. After bringing the serving dishes to the table, Harry took a seat with his friends. The pause in conversation continued as they dished up their food and sent appreciative noises Harry’s way.
. But despite his thoughts, Draco couldn’t help mirroring Harry’s actions. Pulling his hair bobble out before running his fingers through his damp locks, Draco shifted his pillows for sleep. He snuggled down into them, pulling a light quilt over him before settling down on the opposite side of the bed to Harry. He couldn’t stop himself from wishing he really was beside the man in bed. Even if he didn’t want to pursue a romantic relationship with Harry, he ached to lay out next to him. The thought of the comforting body of the man he trusted above all others in bed next to him, with his warm weight and intoxicating scent, was the most exquisite fantasy for Draco. Both men lay together without speaking much now. They were becoming sleepy, and it was not unusual for Harry in particular to fall asleep while on the phone with Draco. Draco was content that they could do this together for once. He mumbled goodnight, and received a sleepy “Night Draco,” in return. His breathing slowed in time with Harry’s, and together they drifted off to sleep.
Draco noticed he was slightly out of breath still and could easily understand why. He knew Harry was a glassblower, a sculptor. Somehow, he had never considered just how physically demanding such an occupation could be. “That was fucking amazing Harry,” Draco stated earnestly. He had truly been in awe watching his friend and cousin working together that way.
The table erupted in laughter, as Harry caught Draco’s eye and gave him a wink. Draco smiled and shook his head fondly in return. Ginny blew him a kiss in thanks.
“Seventeen sickles to a galleon and 29 knuts to a sickle, yet you don’t have
“Any staff, waitresses and bar staff all included. Must be witnessed though,” Ginny replied.
“That’s where you’re mistaken Potter…I’m not sad.” Draco added, raising his eyebrow at Harry. “I did enjoy Desirable Number One though; I changed your name to that in my phone when I saw it.”
“Joshua, is the car service en route?” Draco put the phone on speaker so he could sweep his long silver blonde hair into a knot on top of his head. There was no danger of Americanisms affecting the perfect poshness of his upper class diction.
“Darling, even Justin Finch-Fletchley insisted he was dull. And
Draco had a cool shower; the flat was sadly lacking in air conditioning due to the general misery of British weather. A heatwave in England usually lasted a couple of weeks at the most, culminating in a heaving downpour before the normal grey drabness resumed. Draco washed his hair, relishing the feel of the cool water cascading down his lithe body. He was looking forward to his call with Harry, having missed them since being here. He usually managed to fit in a FaceTime call with Harry at least once a day, either when Harry got into bed or was waking up. The time difference meant they could not both talk each other to sleep at night. Being able to chat in bed together would be a rare treat. Draco had been disappointed with how little time he was going to be able to spend with Harry on this trip. With wedding planning, friends to see, Harry working, and nearly every waking minute swallowed up by Ginny and Pansy, there was just not enough time for Draco’s favourite guilty pleasure. He rinsed the conditioner out of his hair before turning off the shower. In the bathroom he combed his wet hair and piled it up in a bun. He couldn’t face blow drying it in this sticky heat. Despite having just got out the shower, Draco was already starting to feel uncomfortably warm once again. After towel drying and applying moisturiser to his face and body, Draco slipped a loose t-shirt on. This turned out to be a mistake as it started sticking to his warm body straight away. Shrugging, he took the t-shirt off, hoping Harry didn’t object to a bit of flesh on show. He remembered that Harry had seen his magazine spread and inwardly cringed; there were few secrets left now. He was glad that the angle of those photos did not show the lion and serpent entwined on his shoulder. He could get away with the lightning tattooed over his narcissus field as an interesting stormy sky but was not sure he could quite explain away his tribute to Gryffindor and Slytherin. Returning to the guest room in just his underwear, Draco plumped up the pillows and settled against them to make the call, completely unable to keep the smile off his face at his favourite time of the day.
“Hey Draco?”
Harry and Ginny were laughing along, as much at the accents as what was being said. She managed a very convincing Welsh twang after spending so many years with the Harpies, keeping a straight face as she said, “You drink potions with
“I exchanged them for tonight,” she explained. “I’m not going to the bar for a bottle of tequila though, far too pregnant.”
“No James tonight?” Draco asked Ginny.
Draco’s eyes followed Harry’s movements across the kitchen before he turned his attention back to Pansy. “Yes, shall we rein it in Pans? If you want the truth, I have been focused on work, so I haven’t the time for dalliances with men.”
“Dad I’d Like to Fuck!” Harry finished for him with a groan, a blush colouring his cheeks. “Kill me now.”
“Hi.” Harry’s mouth quirked into a smile, his eyes crinkling. He was using the hushed night-time phone voice that Draco had come to know and love.
“So, you’ve just given up on yours then?” Draco enquired, feeling flustered after seeing yet another display of Harry’s magical prowess. He had become unaccustomed to carrying his wand, and the instinct to use magic around the house had faded.
Harry pulled his son into his arms, giving him the sort of hug he’d missed since James had decided he was too big for cuddles with his old man. “I’m so proud of you Jamie.” Harry murmured. James pulled back from the hug and looked at his dad with a bit of confusion and a lot of appreciation. He’d always been able to count on his dad for understanding his side of things, and for giving him a proper chance to explain rather than just flying off the handle like his mother tended to do. “I wish you’d told me this sooner mind,” continued Harry. “It would have been easier to help you over the last year if you had told me what was causing all the trouble.”
“I cannot believe you have a kid who is of age. Honestly, I can’t believe any of us are old enough.” Draco took a sip of the drink and gave Ginny a thumbs up.
“Are you sure it’s Ted that he’s interested in? It’s not only grandmothers that read Witch Weekly and have a hero fetish you know.” Draco gave Harry that smile that always made his stomach clench, the one where he poked his tongue out to the side a little bit and quirked an eyebrow.
“Fine, I’ll fuck off home. I’m not apologising to that dumb cow. Sorry nan.” James stalked off moodily.
“Oh Draco, I doubt we will make it awkward. I showed Pots your Vogue shoot last week and he practically came in his pants.” Pansy cackled.
“Desirable Number One,” joined in Pansy with a smirk, breaking the tension.
“I honestly have no idea what I’m doing for the next two weeks, aside from the 29th. I’m entirely at the girls’ mercy.” The flush in his cheeks and glaze of his gaze was fading as the potion took hold.
“I think that’s a nice idea Jamie. I hope you understand you can come to me with anything. It might be hard for you to believe but I would do anything for you. I promise you can always trust me with your secrets, and I won’t judge you for anything you’ve done. All I ever want is the best for you. You’re my chip off the ol’ block. I love you so much Jamie, I always will.”
When the song came to an end and the needle lifted from the record, the friends sat in comfortable silence finishing their drinks. With knees still pressed together, both reflected that the night had been one of the best they’d had in a long time.
“Sweet Merlin, he was a bore,” laughed Pansy, as she dunked a spring roll.
When Harry answered the phone, Draco had to remind himself to breathe. Harry appeared on his screen with ruffled bed hair, beautifully naked chest, muscled shoulders, and that intense green gaze. Draco had the urge to kiss the oval scar left on his chest from the horcrux Harry had once told him about. When on a video call with anyone else, Draco would spend the time looking at his own reflection, rather than the other caller. There was no way he was going to tear his eyes away from Harry tonight, however. With a token glance to check he wasn’t visibly salivating, Draco’s eyes returned to Harry, and did not leave his face again.
The group all cheered and whooped, downing two fingers of their drinks before resuming the cheering and calls of “Happy birthday Gin”.
Harry shook his head in reply, “A beer please, there’s Singha in the fridge.”
James mumbled like a typical teenager, “I love you too dad,” barely keeping from rolling his eyes.
lessons?”
Returning to his cooking, Harry continued to dance along to the radio as he added garlic, spices, and vegetables. He poured coconut milk into the pan, adding the chicken, and setting it to simmer before taking a seat at the table with his friends.
James was sulking in his room when Harry returned to the flat a couple of hours later. Harry deposited the copious leftovers Molly had foisted on him in the fridge; despite him being a fantastic cook, Molly seemed to think her adopted son and grandson were hopeless and needed looking after.
“Yes!” exclaimed Harry. “They’d never believe you, probably try to get you sectioned.”
Lavender refused to say a word as she left with Ron and their children, and once they had vacated, the group seemed to sigh in relief.
“Are you ok?” enquired Draco, concern in his voice.
The day I got hit with that cursed sword and ended up in a coma was probably the first time I got more than four hours sleep in seven years. My family have told me the story from their perspective; the weeks they spent trying to figure out the curse I was hit with so they could close the wound. Being called into the meeting because the healers thought they should withdraw treatment and let me go. I know most of them agreed with the doctors and prepared themselves to say goodbye. I know I am only alive today because Charlie Weasley fought for me.”
“Shut it you, we’ve had to rely on each other since you and Ginny shacked up. He’s the only one not too busy for me.” Draco pouted at Pansy, who stuck her tongue out in response. He continued, “Of course I want to stay with you, it’ll be wedding central and you know I have the best taste out of all your friends,” He smirked.
“CAN YOU JUST STOP NOW AUNTY LAV!” James shouted, leaving his family gaping at him.
“I can’t believe you’re here.” Harry could not take his eyes off Draco as they waited at the packed bar.
“Language James!” Admonished Molly, seemingly unable to find anything else to criticise in his outburst. Molly had never taken to Lavender, still unable to get over Ron leaving Hermione, and that was over ten years ago.
“Very clever,” grumbled Harry, cringing inwardly at Draco receiving his mortifying press clippings.
“Well done Ted, that’ll be a beauty.” Harry directed at Ted, pulling his t-shirt up and using it wipe the perspiration from his face. Draco had to look away from Harry’s taught, scarred stomach at this point.
“Being the Potter war baby can’t be easy for him, all that pressure. He was as famous as his father, and not for doing anything other than being born. We all know how damaging it is to pin all those hopes and expectations on a child.”
“I’ve heard of it, but I don’t know what it means. Am I showing my age?”
James let out a bitter sigh, closing his eyes as he started to talk quietly. “It’s the stupid articles dad. All the photos of you. All the stupid girls at school are obsessed with you. I finally asked Carella Albero out and all she wanted to talk about was you. They all fancy you. I’m so fucking sick of it dad. I know it’s not your fault but Aunty Lav doesn’t help, putting pictures of you in girly mags. I can’t forgive her for last year either…I don’t think I ever will.” Harry didn’t interrupt the boy, waiting quietly to see if he would elaborate on that last statement. James had got into an awful lot of trouble in the last year but had never given any indication that his aunt had influenced him in that. He had a feeling that his own reluctant celebrity wasn’t really the issue here.
“Well me and you weren’t that close then, so I don’t think you really knew how much I was struggling.” Harry looked to Draco and he nodded his agreement.
Harry’s hot shop and gallery were located just off Diagon Alley, on a little side street between Fortescue's and a small stationary shop. Having the name Potter attached to the business had ensured its success, despite its less than optimum location. The property however was perfect for Harry’s needs, with a clean, crisp gallery space up front, a large workshop at the back with bi-fold doors out onto a courtyard, and an open plan living space on the mezzanine above. Although Harry had crashed on the sofa upstairs on many occasions over the years, he lived separately in a modern muggle flat, allowing him privacy from the paparazzi who still seemed to obsess over his every move.
Draco felt some of the tension returning, as he asked as casually as he could, “The gang is…”
“Mm,” Draco replied, unconsciously following the path of Harry’s tongue with his eyes.
++++++++++++++
“You mentioned,” Draco replied, tensing and releasing his fists to try and work off some of the increasing anxiety.
"That it wasn't awful?"
Harry's confused and it must show because Draco sighs a little annoyed at having to explain.
“Aren’t you like a little French?”
“I’m not sure, you said ‘Serpentard’, it sounds like ‘snake’, right? ‘
“Oh no, you won’t.”
Harry nods slowly.
. But they talk, they makeup - the resulting sex is out of this world, they’re making it work.
I think I am content with my life.
“Even if I was the one to ask?” Draco finally looks into Harry's eyes at the sound of Harry's broken voice.
When it’s clear there’s nothing more left for him to pretend to be doing, he leaves. At the last minute, before hopping in the floo, Harry thinks of something.
Draco can only moan in response. It seems to be everything Harry needs to hear, because he rises up, grips Draco hips and turns him over in a powerful flip that leaves the blond breathless in the best way possible. Draco finds himself on his knees, chest propped up on the armrest. A flick of Harry's fingers and Draco's naked and shivering. Two strong hands grab at his hips and move him around like a rag doll. Draco thinks he might come before anything happens with how turned on he is. He knew Harry would take to it, he just needed to stop thinking so hard about it.
After Potter and Weasley recount the events he missed in the Forest, Sam goes back to his cubicle to write the needed reports. The adrenaline coursing through his veins prevents him from feeling the weight of a full twenty-four hours without sleep. He participated in his first real case, with the two most amazing wizards and they managed to save the kid.
“So let’s start simple.
Yours always,
also means to fuck so you could say that.”
"So," Harry finally breaks the silence, "was it okay?"
"Mmm?"
I love you
“I suppose I could have, yes.”
“Fuck off, Weasley!”
Draco goes back to mixing eggs and sugar, but the look on his face shows that he's still trying to figure something out.
“I’m sorry!” Harry hurries to say. “I shouldn’t have, I just - “
When he has Draco where he wants him - head and arms hanging off the couch, stomach on the armrest and arse propped up - Harry spits in his hand roughly and spreads his saliva on Draco's hole.
Harry reassured him rapidly.
I don’t see much of Hermione and Ron these days.
“Yes!” Draco exclaims, apparently very proud of his student. “The correct sentence would be ‘
"You don't have to do this Draco, I've been handling it alone for a long time now."
“Yes, no, you’re right. It’s just…”, Neville stutters. He almost never stutters anymore.
Surprise takes over Draco’s features.
Harry sighs this time.
", Draco whispers. "Put your hands on me."
." Draco's eyes darken on the spot, the begging in French apparently turning him on.
Harry's staring into Draco's eyes. The fear and confusion are still there, but something's lurking behind Harry's green eyes. Something intense, something like heat? Draco feels his pulse race. He shouldn't get his hopes up but he knows Harry too well to not recognize what's slowly rising.
“I know.”, Harry says in a sigh, “Look, thank you for trying. I know it was a long shot anyway. I barely managed to keep afloat at school and we both know it was equal parts thanks to my name and Hermione. I’ll just tell Shacklebolt I can’t do it.”
“Harry -”
“Draco, he’s… not well, either.”
I’ll forgive you because I heard that taking care of a new born child can be quite daunting.
“Err, sorry, I - Here are the reports for the - err - Malfoy case?”
The first few days Jamie refused to be left alone with Ginny, he was crying for me the whole time. It's getting better now. Ginny is trying but I can see her getting restless. She loves James of course, but maybe more like an aunt? Is that a horrible thing to say?
I shouldn’t be surprised about the lack of etiquette of your previous letter
It’s 11pm when they get the call. They're all gathered in Head Auror Potter's office. The department meeting ended only a few minutes ago but the Head Auror has insisted on receiving the new recruits separately to welcome them. Sam is about to introduce himself when a Jack Russel Terrier comes through the door and starts talking in Deputy Head Auror Weasley's voice.
”. What he really wants to say is “it would look better on my bedroom floor”, “your ass looks great in these '' and “open one more button of this shirt and I’ll jump you”. He doesn’t of course, but the large green over-shirt he’s wearing today - Ginny always says wearing green brings out his eyes - is really coming in handy right now.
I didn't know how to talk to you about this.
Merlin, Draco's whimpering around Harry's cock and he's hard again. He puts one hand around his own dick and starts pulling.
I love you so much.
Harry can’t wait any longer. He cups Draco’s face in both his hands and kisses him deeply. Draco opens his mouth eagerly to welcome Harry’s tongue. They kiss for a long moment, Harry reveling in the softness of Draco’s lips, in the feel of Draco’s hands in his hair, tugging lightly.
Harry,
"Don't you dare make me come before I'm inside you.", he threatens, "it's been too long, I won't last as it is."
"Yes. I think about you pining my hands so that I can't touch you. I think about your hand grasping my hair tightly and fucking my face. I think of your tight grip on my hips almost to the point of pain."
Amicably,
Neville. He’s the only one that seems to understand that Harry needs to be left alone. Well, at least until now.
” A little smile tugs at the corner of Draco’s smile, then he clears his throat.
Indeed, my birthday was on July 31st. Jamie and I shared a piece of cake. I’ve attached a picture of us blowing the candles - well he mostly just spat on them, I did the blowing.
It seemed fitting after the way we fell in love, that I would write you a letter the day before our wedding ceremony. I regret immensely deciding to abide by these Muggle traditions, for I miss you a lot tonight.
"Code 17-11, at the Malfoys. We're meeting you there."
Best,
“Malfoy? Are you in there?” Harry calls when he fails to locate Malfoy.
“Oh. I suppose, yes.”
"Did you just call this child a carrot?"
He gets up too and grabs Draco by the arm.
“Okay?”
"Shit, that hurt."
Draco comes back from work frustrated and tired. He's barely one foot into the living room when suddenly Harry's on him. He slants his mouth on Draco's and pulls him tight against his broad chest. At first Draco enjoys the forcefulness, happy to be out of his own head after his terrible day. The next thing he knows though, Harry's pushing him against a wall and his head thuds sharply against the hard surface.
Seconds later, he succeeds in turning his head enough for Harry to understand what he's saying.
it’s just -
“Not sure, I’ve never been around any babies, Muggles or otherwise, except Teddy, and he was born in the middle of a war so…”
“I just thought maybe you’ll go out while in France and you would want to… practice a little.”
The Head Auror blanches, a sign that the situation is very serious.
Several hours later, full moon high in the sky, the Forest bears witness to another love transcending shapes and forms. A wolf and a dog together again, like old times.
accomplished.
Harry,
“But you didn’t.”
Draco,
"How … what do you want me to do, exactly?"
“Take Scorpius and leave, now.”
I didn't know you had become a tutor. Though I suppose you would know all about that, you probably had tons of tutors growing up. It would explain how you were always so good at potions. Does this mean you’re still living at the Manor?
He installs Teddy in his booster seat. The kid is now able to sit on a normal chair but Harry's learnt the hard way that food gets everywhere when Teddy's not at the exact right height of the table.
After Madame Malkin’s, Draco drags Harry to a few other stores. Thank Merlin for a good
“Of course not. What is there to say? It’s not like we can come back from this, Neville.”
You asked before if I pictured myself with a child. I never used to, to be honest. First, it would be … difficult given my preferences; and I always worried about passing on my family’s expectations and troubled past.
so happy birthday,
Harry at least tries to appear shameful. He does feel bad for wasting Malfoy’s time. The lesson is not going well. Not at all. Harry feels a familiar anxiety in his whole body. The one he thought he would be rid of when he left Hogwarts for the last time.
I actually had to research what diapers were. You do know you’re a wizard, right? Why would you use such outdated contraptions is beyond me! Just in case you really are ignorant, I asked Mifty for a list of basic childcare charms you should use. Mifty took care of me all my life so I trust her for these things. I reckon you should too.
In the end, Harry thinks it best to shut up. Obviously, Malfoy doesn’t want to share his reasons, and that’s fine. The important thing is, Harry needs to be able to make a speech in French and have dinner with the French Minister for Magic in five weeks. That’s already plenty to angst about, no need to spend all his time wondering about Malfoy.
"I don't know,” Harry says. Draco's face falls, barely concealed hurt on display.
Thank you.
Draco quickly becomes frustrated though, he pushes his arse against Harry's mouth and tongue, requesting more. Harry laughs against him, and obliges, sinking two wandlessly slicked fingers in Draco's hole. The groan that escapes the blond should be illegal, it makes Harry's balls tighten dangerously.
Of course, Teddy can’t help interfering at this point.
This time Draco is already home. He's reading a book and enjoying a nice hot cup of tea. Harry comes back from Gods know where, fire in his eyes, body tight with tension. Draco barely has the time to put the cup down before he's pushed on his back, Harry straddling his hips. He gasps in surprise and Harry takes the opportunity to fill Draco's mouth with his tongue. Draco's hard as a rock and moaning in under two minutes. The weight of Harry on him, the feeling of being trapped, it's all immensely arousing. Harry barks orders at him.
“Stop saying ‘okay’.”
“Scorpius!”
?” Harry repeats, not understanding the word.
, like the animal.”
Harry might throw up before they even get up in the sky, he’s so nervous. Draco holds his hand in a tight grip, somehow aware of Harry’s tension. Perhaps he thinks Harry’s scared of heights? Although he’s never been afraid to fly on a broom, so probably not.
” Harry tries.
Sincerely,
“Practice mostly, and the end result is worth it.”
The thought has been running through Harry’s mind since he took one step into Luna and Ginny’s living room, only to find himself face to face with Draco. From the ‘deer in headlights’ look on Draco’s face, he wasn’t aware Harry had been invited either.
What are you doing these days - except giving me parenting advice? (It’s a joke by the way.)
Did I really write to you? What did I say?
Harry kisses the top of Draco's head tenderly. They fall into a comfortable silence, both satisfied and sleepy.
(Ravenclaw) and
“Draco, I’m so sorry, I have Teddy with me, it was totally last minute, I’m sorry I didn’t warn you.”
"Gods, I have no idea what that means but you're so bloody hot when you speak French." Harry groans.
"Draco?"
“Look, it’s almost like chicken, see?”
Harry doesn’t wait until the burn subsides to ask “
Harry's eyes finally settle on Draco's face. The fear and disgust at himself still very present.
“Potter, are you even listening to me?”
When they get there though, a unexpected guest is waiting for them. Draco Malfoy is standing in the night, wand in hand and face intent.
Merry Christmas! Jamie and I already opened our presents, he was so happy
Sincerely,
“Who?” Harry asks. Maybe he missed the beginning of this conversation.
“Come on and give me a hug
He stares at Malfoy for a minute, trying to figure him out. The blond is already collecting the million parchments he had prepared for their lesson.
James Arthur Potter Malfoy (See how good it sounds?)
this makes Draco comes even longer. His asshole is clenching like crazy around Harry's fat cock and he never wants it to end. He's still shaking with aftershocks when Harry flips him around once more. Draco then realizes that Harry still hasn't come. It's not unusual, the man has the stamina of a hippogriff. Draco's in a daze, unsure of what's going on. The next thing is aware of is Harry nudging his mouth open with his hard leaking cock. Draco opens up in a heartbeat and sucks Harry off immediately. This time, Harry finds the right grip on Draco's hair - the one that makes him tingle all over and his flaccid cock twitch - and slowly starts fucking his face. Draco raises his eyes to Harry's face to find the brunet already looking at him with a question in his eyes. Draco nods as best as he can in his position. Harry, reassured, thrusts deeper into Draco's throat, accompanying the gesture with a pull and push of his head to avoid earlier catastrophe.
Love,
Love,
Do you know a good cleaning charm for puke?
Suddenly, he bursts out in a loud laugh and turns back to Harry and Teddy.
Harry
Harry smiles at the words, he’s never heard Draco apologize so plainly before.
?” Harry asks dumbly.
I’m leaving for Hogwarts tomorrow. Dad says that you first fell in love by writing each other letters, that it allowed you to be vulnerable. I did not know what it meant, so he explained that it means you told the truth.
Malfoy,
Impatiently, Harry asks “It’s just what?”
Love,
Merry Christmas Draco.
I love you Jamie (and if you tell your dad I called you that I'll deny it to my last breath).
"Draco, what does
"Ngh", Harry moans, "wait, wait. I want, I want…". He's panting in Draco's mouth, brain completely overloading.
I hope you feel better than I do, especially since Little James must be all up and about. Has he managed to crawl yet? Let me know the second it happens!
"Can you feel how much I want you Draco? Gods, you drive me mad." Then after a beat. "I'm going to fuck you so hard."
Draco interrupts his thoughts by speaking, mouth still half-full.
"Come inside me, please Harry, do it. I love you, I love you, I love you."
Now, I’m thinking, maybe. With the right person.
“But it’s so big. How do you do this everyday?”
misses you.
Dear Mr Potter,
Sam nervously follows the group into the interrogation room. Malfoy is sitting on a metal chair, hands entwined over the table. He's freakishly calm. Whether they are suspects or witnesses, people always get nervous when interrogated. Legs bouncing, eyes twitching.
"Yeah, I just never thought I'd get to touch you like that again."
Harry’s reduced to a blubbering mess. Did Draco really just say they would eat cock? Not that Harry’s opposed to it of course, it’s just they haven’t even kissed yet. Draco sure is moving fast.
Harry meets Draco in Diagon Alley for their seventh lesson. Third to Sixth took place at Draco’s flat like the second one. They’ve covered more magical vocabulary and also worked on pronunciation. Harry has also learnt basic sentences to start conversation. He’s very proud of his progress already and from the way Draco praises him, his professor is as well. All in all the lessons are going very well and Harry is thankful Hermione suggested he seek Draco’s help. The only issue is… Harry is more and more attracted to Draco.
Frankly, Harry doesn't need to say it. Draco can see it written all over his face.
Prompt "First time"
You’re teaching Muggle-borns? That’s wicked. I wish I had had something like that when I was growing up. Having Hagrid barging through the door of the shed my Uncle had us move to in order to avoid Hogwarts’s owls wasn’t exactly what I was expecting for my eleventh birthday! It was worth it just to see my Uncle’s face though. Would you let me sit in on one of your lessons one day?
“You didn’t care enough to let me explain. You just - you cut me off.”
Harry smiles at Draco’s flustered response. Are they flirting? Is Draco even interested in blokes? Should he ask?
"Is the cake ready?" He asks with a teasing smile. His eyes though are asking Harry if everything is alright.
is obviously way more complicated than anticipated. They also prepare French fries (
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, fuck, Draco forgive me please."
I felt so alone before you came along, Draco. You sent me that list of charms and those books, and all I wanted was to curl next to you at night when James was in bed and talk.
On this Father’s Day.
The recruits start whispering amongst themselves. Sam doesn't. He observes the way Potter prepares his wand, his cloak and a little pouch with unidentified objects. Sam entered the DMLE hoping he would get to work closely with the Head Auror. He's not a star struck fool, he just wants to learn from the best and Potter's records and medals unequivocally mark him as the best.
(portkey), they decide to call it a night. Harry’s reluctant to leave, Malfoy’s the best company he’s had in years - except for Ron and Hermione of course. So he lingers in Malfoy’s kitchen, hoping for a last cup of tea.
Sorry to bother you at work but Jamie fell on his face earlier! He tried to walk as always and just stumbled and fell. I couldn't do anything. I'm writing from St Mungos. There was blood and fuck, what if he's really hurt ?
"Eventually?" Harry asks, horrified. "We're not - I - this is not happening again Draco."
Draco chortles. “No! Harry,
They have their own family now, and demanding careers. I have been figuring this out pretty much on my own. Well, now I have you at least.
“What? You can’t be serious!” Marcus yells.
No, this time, he lets the silence envelop them both and a bright smile bloom on his face, lightening the whole room.
“Honestly? Like shit.”
‘Cause you love me too.
I should go." Go? Harry thinks. No! Draco has to stay.
“I didn’t reject you! I love you!”
You forgot Little James's teddy in my flat, again. Mifty will pop up tonight to give it back.
is halfway across the world with the Harpies, didn’t you know? It was all over the news after James was born. Anyway, give my thanks to Mifty, it worked!
“So, what do you prefer?
“Exactly,
I’m glad we’re speaking, Malfoy.
Teddy arrives in his usual frenzy and Harry’s swept up in his enthusiasm. He pushed back cancelling his lesson with Draco so much that it only occurs to him he did not actually cancel it when the floo chimes and Draco’s head appears in the green fire.
Things are a blur after this, Draco is crying with laughter and Harry wants to dig a hole and die. It’s a while before things settle down enough for Draco to carry on with their lesson. Turns out
"I just-"
Harry continues, so caught up in his feelings that he doesn’t see the way Draco’s expression changes from shy to panicked.
I feel like you’ve been out of the loop for a while. There was no wedding. Ginny and I are not a couple. Never really were actually.
“That’s unnecessarily complicated, isn’t it? Were they just too lazy to come up with more words?”
Draco slowly turns towards Harry, a shy smile on his lips.
Harry walks around the counter still separating them. With each step he takes toward Draco, Draco’s eyes widen a little more.
Harry kisses Draco along the jaw and settles in the crook of his neck. Draco should have expected it but still yelps when Harry suddenly bites, hard, perhaps even drawing blood. Draco's hard as a rock beneath Harry and attempts to grind his hips against the other man to alleviate his need. In reaction, Harry presses harder onto Draco, letting him feel his hard length.
Malfoy,
“Okay.”
I love you so much.
Harry startles at the tone of Malfoy’s voice. “Er, yes, sorry, continue.”
Sam nods shyly and leaves. He walks back to his cubicle with a new spring in his step. He can’t wait for his next case.
Harry snickers. Is Malfoy making a joke? A self mocking joke? Is the world going to implode? When Harry looks at him again, Malfoy has a small smile turning his mouth up and his cheeks are a little pink. It’s almost as if he’s pleased that Harry found his joke funny. It doesn’t make sense though. Why would Malfoy care about what Harry thinks? He’s the most self assured bastard in the United Kingdom.
"What?"
Harry thinks for a minute. It’s not that he wants Draco to be in pain, but knowing that he wasn’t totally stupid for thinking that Draco did love him, makes him feel a little better. Why would Draco be sad though? He was the one to break them.
dinner. The floo was locked.
"But -"
Teddy’s beaming in his kitchen, and Harry’s heart swells. The domesticity of it all is so overwhelming. It’s something he’s never felt outside of Molly’s kitchen, and even there he’s always been apart, hair too dark and eyes too green to completely fit in.
Prompt "First time"
"Come on Draco, you’re doing so good.”
“First of all, the Prophecy wasn’t necessarily about me. Voldemort made it about me. Second of all, Trelawney spent the entire fifth year predicting my death in horrible circumstances, yet here I am, so forgive me if I’m being a little sceptical.”
“Blaise is my friend.”
Harry
Draco comes through the floo before answering.

Mifty sent, it’s pretty normal for babies to go through regressions. Thank you by the way, I’ve read it twice now. Hermione would be so proud.
"I'd have thought you'd be a little more worried about your son Malfoy."
Harry startles when Draco addresses him.
Harry thinks, while Draco places their last purchase in his pocket.
”. The way the word makes his lips touch and part feels like he’s kissing Draco already. He lifts his free hand - the other still clutching Draco’s bicep - and traces Draco’s bottom lip with one finger. He looks at Draco interrogatively.
Prompt "Love Letter"
Potter,
Best,
Harry nervously steps out of Malfoy’s fireplace and brushes off the soot of his shirt. He hopes it’s not too obvious that he spent a lot of time in the bathroom this morning. This is stupid, it’s only Malfoy after all. Yet, Harry felt compelled to look good, better than usual.
Malfoy flinches slightly and Potter’s first reaction is to look at him briefly before scolding Marcus.
“Malfoy?”
Potter,
Something wavers in Harry's eyes and his grip lessens just a little. It all definitely goes to shit when Harry forcefully pushes his cock in Draco's face. The hold Harry has on his hair is still just the wrong side of painful and Draco winces, trying to alleviate the pressure on his scalp. Harry presses his dick against Draco's mouth and there's nothing to do except open his mouth and welcome it inside. Harry groans loudly and doesn't wait a second before thrusting deep in Draco's throat. Draco's no virgin, he even enjoys a little deep throating now and then, but the way Harry pushes into his mouth, hold still tight on his hair is making it hard to breathe. His eyes water, his gag reflex makes his heart heave painfully and Draco can't anymore.
Harry knows he’s just playing with him. They’ve been on the Flying Fish roller coaster already, they went down the super slides and saw that weird 4D Angry Birds thing. Draco had leaped out of his seat each time a bird seemed to fly toward them. It seems childish, but when Harry had admitted to never having been to an amusement park before, Draco had insisted they had to live the full experience. So they’re going through all the rides, even the ones for toddlers and families. Harry’s cheeks hurt from all the smiling he’s been doing.
Are you sure you’re fit to take care of a child? Should I ask Granger or Weasley to check on you?
Neville sighs sadly and reaches for Harry’s hand. Weirdly, that simple gesture helps more than any of Ron’s encouragement and Hermione’s awkward hugs.
We both miss you so much. Every night before bed
"Yeah, I guess."
“Here.”
. Harry is filled with warmth and happiness. They’ve spent almost every day together since they started dating - or rather acknowledged that they were dating all along. Harry’s home is filled with Draco’s stuff : recipe books, clothes, toiletries. Harry loves it. Rather, he loves Draco. He has planned something more elaborate to tell him but the moment feels perfect as it is.
“Oh! Yes of course, you’re the professor.” Harry struggles to hide the shiver that runs through him at the thought of Professor Malfoy teaching him a different kind of topic.
“Where are you staying?” Harry interrupts. He’s not ready for this. Not now, maybe not ever.
“Draco, please.”
Marcus begrudgingly nods and starts skulking in the corner. Potter focuses back on Malfoy, there’s something different in his demeanour though. Something almost tentative.
), spreading (
” Malfoy accompanies his sentence with a lot of gestures that help Harry understand what’s expected of him. A bit nervously he tries.
You feed me and need me
Sorry I didn’t answer your letter earlier. Although to be fair I haven’t slept in over a week and your congratulations were more than unexpected.
“I didn’t know you had such strong feelings about poultry Harry. We can cook something else, that’s alright.”
I can’t wait for you to be my husband, darling.
My love,
Sam is really impressed by Weasley’s skills. He knew how good the Deputy Head Auror was of course, but maybe he’d been a little blinded by Potter. It seems he has as much to learn from the Deputy Head Auror.
Draco ends his sentence with a self-conscious shrug. He’s not one to admit he was wrong, Harry knows this is as much of an admission of guilt he’ll get.
“Well,
Harry is lost, what is Draco talking about? The confusion must show on his face, because Draco promptly explains. “We’re going shopping, Potter. Surely, you’ve done this before?” The way Draco says ‘Potter’ now isn’t infuriating, quite the opposite. It makes Harry’s blood boil for entirely different reasons than before.
You and Mifty changed my life ! Those charms are mind-blowing ! The house - and James - now smells fresh and fruity. I feel like a new man. If only I could sleep more than thirty minutes in a row, I might actually be back to my old self.
Draco loves you so much, he wants you to accept him and his choices. Could you please do that? I know Lucius is another matter and honestly I don’t intend on touching that can of worms…
“I’d rather ask her who’s going to fuck whom tonight. There’s no way I’m losing against Weasley again.” The stubborn look on Draco's face briefly reminds Harry of their school days.
The day will start by a welcoming breakfast in the Great Hall, followed by a visit of the castle. In the afternoon, you may register to attend a few classes.
Draco sent Harry an owl two days prior to their latest lesson.
would make a pretty weird pet name then, French people really are strange. Not wanting to start Draco on one of his now famous rants about the quirks of French and the people speaking it, Harry just shrugs and gets back to his task.
They share a cheese plate for dessert. Suddenly, Draco asks “
How crazy is that?
, right?”
Tomorrow, I’ll say the official words but tonight, let me promise you to love you, to cherish you, to always say I’m sorry first, to keep my frozen feet away from you from October to March and mostly I promise you that our son and I will always be here for you.
” Harry understands maybe half of what Draco says but he couldn’t care less. Draco’s animated and smiling face is filling him with happiness. He never knew Draco could be like this - carefree, light-hearted and
Sincerely,
“Okay, let’s go then. Maybe she’ll tell us who will win the Quidditch Fantasy League on Sunday.”
” Draco whispers breathless.
"You bruise like a peach Draco, that's -
“No Teddy, I didn’t!”
“There’s also hurt, a lot of hurt.” She continues gravely.
Jamie hasn’t moved since I put him to bed last night. It’s 5AM, I’m freaking out!! What should I do? Do you think there’s a problem? I should take him to St Mungos, right?
Harry Potter
I hope everything is going well in London. Has Alex managed to finally control his outbursts? Don't forget your protection charms with this one, I'd like to find you unscathed when I get back.
“Oh I can see that Edward, you sure grew up since the last time we saw each other.”
That, he feels he can do. He goes to the boy, grabs his hand and casts a new protective charm over them both. When they’re out of range, he Apparates them directly to the Ministry. Scorpius starts crying.
"I know the difference between sky blue and light blue." Ron muttered from beside her.
“Stop by anytime, Harry. I’m always happy for a chat. Now run along to breakfast, you need to keep your strength up.”
“Thanks… I better get going. I’ll see you at breakfast?”
The quiet surrounding Harry’s statement was deafening. They both knew the expectation weighing on the both of them and their ages were sometimes forgotten. Both were being asked a great deal for still being children and their mental health was sorely neglected by the adults around them. One of the largest casualties of war were the children that would be left behind to grow up when it was over. Even more so with the children who would have to fight in that war. After a moment’s thought, Draco snuck his hand over Harry’s.
"Just thinking about life. How one decision can affect someone's entire life. What it means to forgive and what it takes for it to happen. How our choices affect everyone else around us."
“Well, go drop off Granger and I’ll meet you at the Room.” He walked away with a jaunty wave.
Harry continued grumbling to himself all the way to the tower. Muttering the password and pushing open the door, he smiled at the relieved look on Hermione and Ron’s face when he walked in. He set his stuff down and flopped on the couch.
"Wait, he trusts you to kill Dumbledore? Isn't he worried you'll be caught or killed?"
He stopped her at the portrait and gave her a quick hug before they entered. Claiming tiredness, he waved at Ron before ignoring the hurt look on his face and headed up to the dorm room. He changed into pajamas before climbing into his bed. He grabbed his cloak and map, made up his bed like he was still in it and spelled the bed curtains. He wrapped the cloak around himself and left the dorms. He watched Hermione and Ron for a moment before leaving the Common Room. He walked quickly to the Room of Requirement, eager to see Draco. He paced in front of the door and launched himself in as soon as it opened. Draco was curled in the armchair by the fireplace reading a book.
The classes dragged on again today. Potions didn’t involve any secret cranes today, much to Harry’s disappointment. He resisted the urge to send any Draco’s way on his own because the blond seemed deep in thought. He noticed once again that there didn’t seem to be much interaction between Draco and the other Slytherins. He wondered how he could have possibly missed it before Draco had mentioned it. After Potions, he found himself getting dragged into an abandoned classroom again. He cast a mildly irritated glance at Hermione.
Short version: He asked if it was really hypothetical and I said yes. Veritaserum interview, housing arrangements, and then discussion on help to the cause. Don’t think the last is required. Said he’s spoken to several students about it already. Were you one?
“Harry, I have to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright.”
"And he would go that far, wouldn't he? You don't have to kill him, you know. He can help you. He won't hold your past decisions, your parent's decisions, or what you've been put up to against you. He's not like that." Harry rested his hand on Draco's arm.
"Harry, you've barely touched your breakfast. You'll make yourself sick if you don't eat." Hermione placed her hand on his arm.
"Then why is it so hard to write? Seems it'd be a breeze if you already have the answers."
“Yes, sir. I don’t know how to explain it.”
"I think…I think I want to be good. I can't stand it anymore. I didn't want any of this to begin with. I think I want to start over…Starting with you, Harry."
"P-p-otter?" Malfoy's hoarse voice broke through.
He watched in anticipation as the blood flow ceased, but the wounds remained open. He muttered it once more, relief at the cessation of the blood, but fear for Malfoy's life crashing over him. The wounds started to scab and knit together. He laid his head on Malfoy's chest desperately listening for a heartbeat. It thudded faintly. He whispered the spell once more against his skin. The wounds finally healed over, his heartbeat grew louder and he started breathing heavily.
Draco’s voice breaks the heavy silence. Harry raised his head, waiting for Draco to elaborate.
Potter.
Draco smiles, relieved. “You’re right. Plus, everyone knows you can’t live without me.”
, when did Draco arrive? And why is he talking to Harry so close?
is not a cabbage, Harry! It's a pastry! A little puff, light, airy, delicious really. Here, look."
“Yes, like a date.” Something in Draco’s eyes tells Harry that they are indeed on the same page. Pretending that all the time they spend together is about the French lessons, when it’s actually because they like each other’s company more and more.
Fuck you, Malfoy.
I still have difficulties processing that we sat together for two hours, talked and shared ice cream, without either of us being hexed. Fatherhood suits you, you look
I’m sorry Draco’s birthday didn’t go as planned yesterday. I never meant for it to turn into a fight. Actually, I meant everything I said to you. I love your son, deeply. He’s my family now, him and James. You’re his family, so in a roundabout way, that makes
Don’t take this the wrong way but Ginevra should be able to help with that, no?
Mifty found it while shopping. She says it’s a good parenting guide for single parents. Please forgive her if you find it offensive.
“Mmm,
"Too soon." Harry chides him.
I thought maybe…
?” He says, looking intently into Harry’s eyes. Harry gulps and echoes Draco’s statement straight away. “
They fall silent again, each sniffing and wiping their eyes in their corner.
Christ, are you as hungover as I am? I'm on my third hangover potion and I still feel like I drank my weight in Ogden's finest…
Just please come home to us.
D. L. Malfoy
Draco blushes and drops his head. “Oh it’s not - I mean, you worked hard, it’s all you really.”
They eat and talk. Harry asks about Draco’s childhood in France, before Hogwarts. Draco talks about
They all get ushered out of the office and Potter runs through the corridors to the emergency apparition point.
He can’t avoid the wishfulness seeping into his voice. He desperately wants a family, he always did. But now, he knows he wants this with Draco. They’ve not really discussed it yet. They’re in such a good place right now. Draco’s moved in a couple months ago and they just blended so easily together. They fight, of course they do, they’re still
Harry Potter
Sincerely,
“Yeah?”
So smile ‘cause I love you
(dementors) and
James and everything. I’m sorry I missed the wedding announcement by the way, it’s probably too late to congratulate you for it.
Prompt : Bite
Prompt "What if he wants Ken not Barbie"
Harry and Jamie
"Yeah? You sure?"
“Okay, I guess. You?” Everything in Draco’s physique screams that he's not though. The dark shadows under his eyes, the dullness of his skin, the wrinkles on his clothes. Harry feels compelled to be honest.
The past four years have been amazing. You and James are my family, the only one I have and will ever have. I don’t care that he’s not yours legally, he’s yours, ours. He loves you like a father and you love him like a son. I never had that, so I would know how much it means. I knew you felt this way the day he fell, remember? I told you not to come to St Mungos and yet you showed up all panicked and disheveled. You had left right in the middle of a class the minute you got my owl. I knew then.
You’ve really improved a lot, well done.” Sometimes, for more complicated sentences, Draco immediately translates in English, without Harry having to ask.
Mention of sexual situations
Draco starts, he apparently hadn’t planned on Harry talking unprompted.
Darling,
Draco doesn't have to wait long, a hand soon grabs at his jaw. Harry uses it to guide Draco into a deep filthy kiss, all tongue and teeth. Draco moans into it shamelessly. Harry needs all the reassurance he can get.
Draco,
”, Draco intervenes, “you can help us make the
Harry frowns again.
Draco (I feels super weird to call you that
Harry groans and drops his head on the small of Draco's back. He breathes deeply a few times, trying to rein in his arousal. When he feels a bit more settled, he straightens up. Draco is looking at him above his shoulder. The look of pure want and adoration in his eyes finishes mending Harry's heart. Tired of waiting for Harry to get a move on, Draco wriggles his toned ass in the air. Harry spanks him again, a sharper blow this time that leaves Draco's arse slightly pink. Draco's starting to protest against the wait but he's cut off by Harry's cock plunging inside him in one brutal thrust of his hips.
“Please someone pierce my eardrums…”
“How are you feeling?”
"Harry, you're everything I need and want okay. This thing, I don't need it, I want it sometimes but it's very much okay if we don't. I love you."
“So what are we making?”
When Harry seems calmer, Draco leans back and catches Harry's eyes with his own.
The line is long enough for Harry to change his mind a dozen times. A few people are still ahead of them when Draco finally cracks and asks what’s going on.
Weasley is relentless when it comes to interrogations. The first suspect they talk to gives them the names of his accomplices in less than twenty minutes then refuses to talk. The second explains that the group was formed by Blaze Woodward. Although Woodward was not ever involved in the war, he raised a small army amongst those that felt robbed by the leniency against Death Eater. He gathered around him a dozen of angry, revengeful men and decided that the best way to get their so-called justice would be to hurt the families of known Death Eaters and associates - aka Slytherins. That’s how Scorpius had been taken and Fenella Parkinson-Nott traumatised by black hooded men trying to abduct her outside her house.
“I love you”, he finally whispers, feelings just tumbling out of him, “I love you so much. I’ll never love anyone like I love you.”
“You didn’t really give me any time to explain. You just Apparated back home and sealed the wards to keep me out.”
Sam sighs, a little frustrated to be left behind. As a new recruit, he's mostly handed  paperwork duties but he'll be damned if he still doesn't give it his best. His time will come, he's quite certain.
Not long after, they’re finally boarding in the cramped pod. Harry places one arm around Draco’s shoulder, effectively forcing his boyfriend to be pressed against his side. Draco doesn’t seem to mind, and a few seconds later, he presses his nose against Harry’s cheek and his whole body relaxes. The wheel starts moving, eliciting a cute little gasp from Draco. They go up and up and suddenly the wheel stops and they just sit quietly, eyes wide open, transfixed by the view in front of them. The sun is setting at the horizon and casting orange tinted shadows on Draco’s face. Harry shifts a little to look at him. The view is nothing compared to the sight of his boyfriend, amazed, caressed by the dim light. He’s so gorgeous, Harry has trouble breathing.
"Alright, everyone, settle down," Harry said as he leaned on the front of his desk. "Does anyone have any questions?-- Yes, Mr. Wells?"
Fortunately, I’m getting back in the groove of things, and my exams are finished on Tuesday, so I’ll have a whole month of free time where I can write (hopefully) until summer session starts! Yaaaaay!
, when they had a perfectly good spare bedroom?" Malfoy asked.
"Well come on in, make yourself comfortable. I reckon this conversation might take a while," Harry said.
"Draco, please. I'm sorry, it was wrong of me to assume anything about your loved ones when I didn't know them." Harry stopped walking, but Draco kept moving down the hallway. "I'm sorry for making you feel like I didn't love you," He called out. Draco hesitated, but kept moving.
"Oh, that— Blaise was flirting with me the entire night! I didn't recognize it at first, but he kept grinning with his teeth. Remember what he told us that one night at the Leaky? That he smiles with his teeth when he's flirting because they're so white and pearly? Anyways, he kept doing that, then he told me that he'd like to see me naked."
Harry had gotten out of the shower after a long day at work— he was not enjoying being an Auror, and his mood reflected that. Thankfully, every time he felt like throwing himself out the window in attempt to end his misery, he thought of Draco; falling asleep in his arms, watching him cook eggs in his pink, frilly apron every morning, kissing his forehead, among other things— needless to say, Harry had thought about Draco a lot that day. He was surprised that he was not at their (basically shared) apartment yet; they must've been running late at the lab.
"Sorry let me rephrase myself," Harry said. "Does anyone have any questions
"Well it doesn't matter now, does it?! We had a crisis, and you were gone! Do you know what it's like to have a crisis when one of your best professors is missing? It's horrifying! Why did you not inform me that you were leaving the school grounds?"
? I'm evil? I'm a prejudiced pure-blood who dedicates myself to torturing innocent people? In case you didn't know, people change, Potter. Just like how I am good,
"Aw, but then who would make a healing potion equivalent to Phoenix tears?"
"I don't know! I know that
"Character? Harry, it makes the room look awful. How do you plan to teach in such a treacherous environment? You couldn't have even bothered to clean the desks? The house elves aren't responsible for your classroom, Harry. It's your job to make sure the learning environment is proper."
Harry didn't stay at the luncheon for long, as he found himself sweating every time he looked over at Malfoy. It's not as though he was nervous by Malfoy's presence, it was just that every time he looked in Malfoy's direction, the blond was staring right back at him. So Harry did the first thing that came to mind-- he ran.
"Well, I—"
"Shh... Harry, there's no need to shout. What are you doing here?"
The Sorting Hat's new song was very catchy, and Harry found the tune stuck in his head after the ceremony was over. Alone in his office, Harry sat on the loveseat, drinking tea and humming to himself, when he heard a quiet knock on the door. Forgetting about their arrangement earlier, Harry was shocked to see Malfoy on the other side. "Come on in," he said shakily, summoning another tea cup from the pantry.
"Love you too," Harry grumbled before beginning to clean the abundance of filthy desks.
"Why do you think?" Malfoy asked.
"And then he fell down and took the entire stack of papers with him!" The group of friends laughed as Neville told yet a story about his boyfriend's clumsiness.
About halfway through the desks, Harry made his way to the Great Hall for the optional Staff-Only lunch. Headmistress McGonagall and Professor Flitwick sat near the end of the long table, and seemed to be entranced by whatever Malfoy was telling them. That left Madame Hooch, Madame Pomfrey, Madame Pince, Filch, and some of the ghosts, who floated along, talking to some of the professors.
"Like you would let her take all the glory. Besides, Hermione's too consumed in Transfiguration and Arithmancy to care about inventing new Potions."
"Good. Now, I've got to go talk to Mr. Malfoy about this as well-- seeing as neither of you know how to behave yourselves, I suggest that you stay away from each other until you learn to handle your temper."
"Right," Harry replied. "Well, goodbye then."
"They did even better than the O.W.L. students! Every single Hogwarts student taking their N.E.W.T.s passed. And guess who got the highest scores?"
Harry thanked Rosmerta and made his way towards Neville's booth. "Hello, Nev," he said as he sat down.
. We're allowed to leave whenever we want... except during our work hours, of course. You could easily leave for a weekend to see Pansy."
Blaise grinned. "Nice!" He said, holding up a hand for Ginny to slap.
"Shit!" Harry shouted. "For fuck's sake, Malfoy!" Harry stood up and rushed out the door, chasing after Draco. He had just seen him turn around the corner when he reached the hallway. He ran down the corridor, calling out Malfoy's name. When he caught up to the other man, he placed a hand on his shoulder, but Malfoy shrugged it away, wiping away tears that were forming in his eyes.
Blaise leaned in close to Harry's ear. "I wouldn't mind seeing you in--or rather out-- of wet clothes, Potter," he murmured.
"Stop interrupting me, Potter! What is that on your neck? Are those hickeys, Potter? Dear God, Potter, did you honestly leave the school grounds to go get it on with someone from the village? To scratch your itch, if you will? How unbelievably unprofessional, Potter! Cover yourself, then follow me! We need to resolve this crisis!"
"Yes, and that's why Ginny caught you two in a lip-lock at the Leaky last July."
Ron merely nodded his head and closed his eyes. Figuring that Ron would be fine, Harry apparated to the outside of Luna Lovegood's apartment. Since she lived on the first floor, all that Harry would have to do is knock on her bedroom window and grab the keys from Ginny. Except for the fact that he forgot which apartment was hers, this was an excellent plan.
"While you've been busy avoiding Draco's gaze, he's been busy staring at you longingly. Honestly, it's like we're back at Hogwarts."
"Did you see what Malfoy decided to wear? Very unprofessional, he's hardly wearing proper wizarding robes," Hermione whispered.
—Draco
Harry woke up to a close up of Hermione's face. She was whispering his name, as not to wake up Ron, who was in the next room over. Harry was still in his dress robes, a dark green pair that matched the first pair that he had ever owned. "Harry, wake up already, we've got to get back to the castle," Hermione said.
"Er— no, I think I'm going to go back to the castle. I've got some lessons to plan out."
"Well it wouldn't be a celebration if someone didn't get
"The last person I expected to get sloshed was Ginny Weasley," Blaise said to Harry.
"But Professor Malfoy--"
Harry's breath hitched. He looked at Malfoy, who had turned to face him. "We need to talk," he whispered, barely audible.
He would have to talk to Hermione— she would know.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Whatever," she grumbled.
Harry, Hagrid and the students watched the Kappa for nearly twenty minutes, until it eventually ventured off to go feed. "Alright, students, I think that's enough for today. Professor Hagrid and I will lead you back up to the school grounds, and then my class will come with me back up to the castle," Harry said, waving his students along, bringing them out of the Kappa's bog area. As they reached the castle, Harry started to lead his class down the corridor to the Defence classroom when Malfoy walked out of the staff lounge and walked straight into Harry, nearly knocking him over.
McGonagall looked at Harry with aggravation. "You think that sneaking out past curfew, not telling anyone where you are, and causing a manhunt isn't worthy of punishment?!"
"Touché."
"So," Hermione said as she sat down on one end of Harry's love-seat. "What's going on between you and Blaise?"
"Alright, well you know where I am if you need me. I'll see you around, yeah?"
No Pepper-Up potion could have compared to the thrill that Harry felt after hearing those words. Those two simple words that made Harry's stomach flutter and his head spin. He felt as though he were walking on air as he taught his classes that day. His mood seemed to be reflected by his students, who all laughed at his terrible jokes, and smiled all throughout class— even the ones who were failing.
