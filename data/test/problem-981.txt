Lucius Malfoy knew that his son would disappoint him. It was plain, clear as the day with no clouds on sight. His son was different than all purebloods that came before him. He saw the defiance behind his eyes. Draco would never be the heir he wanted him to be. Draco would not be worthy of the Malfoy name, not even the Black name.
"I-I'm so sorry, sir, I didn't mean to." Harry was never allowed to call his uncle, uncle nor his aunt, aunt. They vehemently refused to be called with familiar terms by a freak. Harry head's snapped to the left as his uncle slapped him.
Harry felt the train move after almost thirty minutes of reading and waiting. He heard Draco groan from across from him. Draco moved around the seat before he relaxed and slept well. Harry stifled a laugh. His friend reminded Harry of a cat. Harry decided to read One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi since Mr. Snape had told Harry that Herbology and Potions were connected as by knowing the properties of plants and their classifications, Harry would be able to understand Potions better. Mr. Snape had mentioned that if Harry was able to understand, then Harry could even create his own potions. This excited Harry. He wanted to try making his own potions.
"Yes, I can. Smart boy. Now, I can see how much you wish to be in Ravenclaw. Why is that?" Draco knew he had to justify himself - less the Sorting Hat puts him in Slytherin. He held in a shudder.
For Harry, he was glad that he had, most if not all, of his classes with Ravenclaw, meaning that Hermione and Draco were always with him. Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for Neville. Harry felt sad as he wanted to have classes with the nice boy.
"Harry, I'll sleep for a bit. I wasn't able to sleep well. Wake me up when we're close to the school?" Harry looked at him, from his book,
"I'll come with you both." Draco's face showed that he would not be patient to deal with any disagreements. His face terrified the many Hufflepuffs who were ready to protest. Cedric raised a brow and laughed as he started to lead Harry and Draco to the Hufflepuff common room. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell came in screaming.
But Draco would not follow this. He wouldn't. Not while he was alive. He would rather die than serve the Dark Lord. But his parents didn't have to know that. That will be his little secret, revealed until the time is right.
A week after Harry dreamed, he was once more in his cupboard. A knock resounded in the house. Harry didn't know who knocked. Why would someone knock? No one ever knocked on the Dursley's door. He heard heavy steps as Uncle Vernon answered the door.
Severus felt the wash of magic at the Hufflepuff table. He knew that it came from Harry and the Diggory boy. Severus was worried but when he saw the smile from Harry, he knew it wasn't bad, whatever transpired between the two.
Harry loved staying with Mr. Snape. Within three weeks, Mr. Snape made Harry feel at home. Mr. Snape always took care of Harry's wounds and made sure he ate well. One of the first things that the man do was replace all of Harry's clothes. He took Harry's measurements and sent them out via his owl, Atrum. Days later, Harry had a new wardrobe that fit him comfortably and filled with Muggle and Wizarding clothes. Mr. Snape also taught Harry how to read and write, pleasing Harry immensely. Harry's favorite books to read were Mr. Snape's books on Potions and Dark Arts. It didn't seem age-appropriate for Harry to read, but Harry didn't care; he loved reading from Mr. Snape's library.
"Really? You think so, Mr. Malfoy." Well, at least he remembers pureblood customs, Draco thought satisfied, though, Hermione looked confused at this.
The rest of the time was spent laughing and learning more about each other. Draco was happy he finally has friends that were his own, not friends provided to him via his father and mother's name and status. Draco was excited to see what Hogwarts would bring him and his newfound friends.
"Malfoy, Draco!" Severus saw his godson exhale and stepped up to the Sorting Hat. It took a while as Draco just sat there. Severus did not know what was going on as Draco was not facing him. He was worried.
"Of course. Enjoy your nap, Draco." Draco smiled at Harry and slowly dozed off, listening to happy screams and yells of the outside and inside of the train.
The man wore all black. He had a long face as well as long hair. His nose seemed crooked. His face seemed to be in a frown. He looked upset. Harry didn't like that fact and he quickly shifted his eyes down.
"Yes, erm, please don't tell everyone. Although I think Weasley did that already." Hermione and Neville nodded and decided to sit down. Draco inwardly sighed; these two didn't even ask. Oh well, what's done is done.
"Do you know of the Dark Lord?" The Dark Lord. How Draco despised him. But he would never tell his Father that. He knew how much his Father respected him. But for now, he didn't know much.
"Good night, Professor Snape. Sleep well. See you tomorrow in class." Although Harry was almost done tapping the barrels, he could hear Professor Snape's low, "Good night, Harry."
The Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore stood and addressed the school. Harry did not like the way the Headmaster was looking at him. He felt scared and nervous under that glance. Thankfully, the Headmaster allowed them to eat with a clap of his. Food, it was everywhere. All kinds of food as well. Harry's mouth watered as he gazed at the plethora of food. It seemed that Cedric noticed as he tapped Harry's shoulder.
Harry watched Draco as his breathing evened out. Harry gave his friend a gentle smile and went back to reading. Mr. Snape had put extra notes with Harry into his book to help him understand the reasons as to the order of the potion and the necessity of certain ingredients, even up to explanations as to why potions were stirred the way they were. Harry was thankful for the pointers and notes because he would surely fail the class, and he would disappoint Mr. Snape.
Thank you to those who read and reviewed my book on fanfiction.net, you all make me so happy especially those who are reading this book outside of the North American continent.
"This will now be your room, Harry. You are responsible to keep it clean and tidy." Harry was shocked. His room. A room. He never had a room before. Rooms were only for normal people and not for freaks like him. But Harry remembered that Mr. Snape did not think of him as a freak. But Mr. Snape did something that wasn't normal too, so did that mean Mr. Snape was a freak?
Draco looked at godfather, who gave him a small nod of approval. Draco beamed at him and turned to Harry, who was about to be sorted.
"To get in, you must answer the riddle, get it wrong then you have to wait for someone to get it right. Understood?" Hermione nodded. Oh, how she loved riddles and logic puzzles. She couldn't wait to hear the riddle from the knocker.
He listened to his father ramble about a boy named Harry Potter. Draco did not care about his father's racist slurs against the boy. Draco did care about the boy. He wanted to know more beyond the slurs and praises. He wanted to know the boy behind the title. His curious little mind was jumping with the thought of new knowledge. He overindulged his curiosity with how this boy may act and think, to how he looked like, and even to how he smiled. He never noticed that his father was done until he called his name.
I will not break my friendship with any of them. I have already given them the right to call me my given name, and they did as well. And Father? I do not care about what punishment you have in mind. For this is my life and destiny, and I will do what I please with it.
Classes were a pain to Harry. He was able to understand what his professors were talking about. He also understood what he had to do. The problem? The amount of work they were being given. It was only the first day of classes, and they had to write a foot long parchment about the fundamental theories of Transfiguration. One eight-inch essay on the
I will be honest. I do not appreciate your comradeship with the Mudblood. It will do the Malfoy and Black lines good if you cease your relationship with her immediately. Your comradeship will affect our family's standing with the others, and that will not be permitted. I have indulged you long enough, son. The Longbottom boy, on the other hand, will also not be acceptable. That boy comes a line of Light wizards, our enemy. Cease your comradeship with him at once, Draco.
I also noticed that the formatting for the book has been thrown off the expectations that I wanted so I'll be going back to all three sites to fix that problem. So please, if you get a notification saying that I updated, I just fixed the formatting. Sorry to burst your bubble, everyone.
Thank you for those who read, reviewed, and kudos'd this book on archiveofourown, you all make my day.
Soon the great doors of the Great Hall opened. Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress walked in, the first years, including Harry and Draco, followed behind her. Severus did not pay mind to what Minerva was saying, for she said the same each year. Soon she started to call the names. Again, Severus had no care for them. All he wanted to know was where Harry and his godson would be placed. Thankfully, he did not have to wait long.
He started to approach Harry, unclasping the lid to the balm. Harry seemed to watch him like a hawk. Severus understood why. The boy was afraid of him. Afraid that he will judge him or worse hit him. But Severus understood all too well. He too had his fair share of abuse.
The man walked a little more down Surrey and Harry followed like a lost puppy. The man suddenly stopped causing Harry to bump against him. It seemed as if the man didn't care and held out his arm to Harry.
Severus watched Harry James Potter as he ate. He was subtly impressed with the boy's manners. He felt pity for the boy. The boy knew nothing from what he was able to see from his memories. Severus inwardly sighed. He knew that he would use the whole month of August to properly teach the boy what he needed to know and to bring his health to its proper level. Severus had his work cut out for him, but he was willing for Lily - as well as hope so that the boy does not become a bastard like his father.
"Come, we should go to Madam Malkin's to get your school robes. That usually takes the longest." Harry nodded and released Mr. Snape from his hug. He was excited to get school robes.
A now eleven-year-old Draco Lucius Malfoy was jumping in joy. He had received his Hogwarts letter. He was ecstatic. Although, not too much. He remembered the argument his mother and father had about his education. His father wanted him to go to Durmstrang so he could be with strong Dark wizards, but his mother wanted him to go to Hogwarts where he'll learn how to cooperate and meets all kinds of people. Plus, his mother wanted him closer to home. Draco agreed with his mother. He did want to go to Hogwarts. He wanted to meet all kinds of people, Durmstrang wouldn't give him that opportunity.
Draco suddenly found himself in front of Flourish and Blotts. Draco wanted to jump in excitement but luckily was able to control his emotions in time. Draco followed his parents as they went into the store. The people and books were abundant and the chatter soon quieted. No one talked. It even seemed as if none breathed, looking like pale statues. Draco felt nervous being around this many people. Oddly enough, the people seemed to move aside for his family. Draco had a feeling he knew why. His father was known to be good friends with the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. Not only that, but his father was also a Death Eater that escaped Azkaban by stating he was under the
Two days after the argument, they had all gone to Diagon Alley to purchase their school supplies and finished the day by going to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.
"Mr. Snape?" Severus looked towards Griphook. "Since you are one of Mr. Potter's eligible guardians, do you wish to adopt the child?" Severus heard Harry suck in a deep breath. He knew that Harry wanted to stay with him.
"Excuse me, Mother. Perhaps another day then?" Draco immediately left without hearing any words that said otherwise.
Harry was silent, watching the Malfoys say goodbye. Draco neither that Harry was still uncomfortable with his parents. Draco couldn't blame him.
"Professor Sprout, may I say and talk to Professor Snape for a bit?" Professor Snape looked a bit shocked but the shine of relief in his eyes made Harry smile. Professor Sprout nodded at them and she went in with White.
A seven-year-old Harry James Potter was cleaning the yard. His cousin was in school, a place he wasn't allowed to go to. His uncle was at work, where he would be working hard. His Aunt Petunia would be watching on her telly. Harry was busy cleaning the yard. Mowing, de-weeding, planting, watering. Harry worked as diligently as he could for the care of his aunt's yard. He knew how much his aunt cared for her yard. He knew how she showed it off to their neighbors. How they fawned over the work Harry had done. It pleased Harry, despite him knowing in the back of his mind that the neighbors will never know that it was Harry's work, not Aunt Petunia's.
"Mr. Snape, how did you do that? That was amazing!" Harry saw that Mr. Snape gave him a soft smile. Harry knew that he liked seeing Mr. Snape smile like that.
"Why?" The man said with his soft voice. Harry liked the man's soft voice. It called out to him like a lullaby. Harry sighed softly, "Because I'm a freak, and freaks aren't allowed to eat at the table." The man took a sharp breath. Harry did not dare to look at the man. He was afraid of he would see.
"Correct. Now I will tell you about how he was vanquished." Vanquished? Not dead, then. That meant that his father was hoping that he would come back. Draco just barely was able to contain a shiver of disgust. A Malfoy should be proud. Not to allow themselves to be a willing slave to a man, no matter how strong he is. This is what truly disgusted Draco.
It took minutes, perhaps almost an hour for Severus to pick himself up. He turned to Harry and saw him sniffling.
"Sure," Hermione started, "Besides, we should tell Neville all about Potions and what he missed." Hermione was already walking ahead of the boys, setting a brisk pace to the Hospital Wing.
"Should any of Harry's godparents be indisposed or unable to take care of him, Severus Snape shall take of him. My son will not be placed in the care of my sister, Petunia Dursley, and her family. So mote it be."
To his surprise, the man beckoned him over to sit with him. Harry was surprised. He was never allowed to sit at the table. Freaks were never allowed places on the table his aunt had told him, yet this man wanted him to sit with him. Harry slowly walked until he reached the man.
. I do certainly hope that your name can live up to your knowledge." Harry gulped, and deep down, he hoped so too. He gave Professor Snape a nod as the man continued to call names. When he finished, he set them to work on the cure to boils - the same potion that Neville, the other Gryffindors, and Slytherin's had to create.
"What are you four doing? It's breakfast so let's eat." With a laugh, Draco dug into his food, grateful that he somewhat has another friend. Although it would be nice to have a friend that isn't a Hufflepuff.
"Why is it that purebloods are automatically more superior to others? It's not like they asked to be born inferior to us?" Draco scrunched up his face as he asked this. He truly did not understand.
I hope that you all are enjoying this so far, next chapter is the Train and the Sorting Feast ^^. Look forward to~
Severus can already see Lily in her son. Her kindness, softness, and eyes. Oh, how her eyes were given to her son. The only memory of Lily. Her eyes in Harry's. It was the most beautiful gift Merlin can gift him.
"We must. School begins in one week and you need to go out and meet people. I plan to disguise us with a glamor so that we won't be crowded with people who will recognize you." Harry sighed in relief. He didn't want people flocking towards him at all. Harry hated the attention and hated being the Boy-Who-Lived. He didn't even remember beating the Dark Lord so how can he be called a hero? Harry didn't understand.
Draco enjoyed the end of summer very much; thank you. He and Harry became closer after the argument between his parents and godfather. It seemed that they had a truce, perhaps for the sake of his and Harry's friendship. It was a fact that pleased Draco immensely.
"In the event of our deaths, we wish for you to know that we changed our Secret Keeper. We knew that many people would think that Sirius was the Secret Keeper, but it was a lie, a farse. Peter, our good friend was our Secret Keeper. Dumbledore knew and cast the spell. So please, if we die, let them know that it was Peter, our Secret Keeper."
"I, Hermione Jean Granger, give Neville Longbottom, Draco Lucius Malfoy, and Harry James Potter the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." Then, Draco felt a magic bloom around them. The magic around them was strong, binding them as friends. Draco felt himself get high and drunk on the magic - and started to giggle. Around him, he heard the others do the same. Just as the magic appeared, it disappeared as well, leaving the four of them, giggling.
Oh, how Lucius recognized that manner of walking. He knew it was Severus underneath those glamors. But he was curious as to who was the boy next to him.
Lucius wondered where he went wrong. Was it due to letting his son spend most of his day in the library? Was it due to him conceding to his wife, Narcissa, when it came to raising their son? Was he too lenient when he taught his son the traditions that all purebloods hailed from and passed down to the next generation?
"Draco? I am finished. You are dismissed. It is not worth talking to a boy who does not wish to listen." Draco felt his ears flush, but he muttered an apology to his father and quickly went back to the library. He wanted to see if there were books on Harry Potter. How he wanted to know more about the boy.
She looked once more at her husband. At his nod, she knew it was time to leave. She left by parting a final cold glance at all who stared. She put her hand on Draco's shoulder to guide him out of the shop.
"Excuse me, what?!" Harry couldn't believe his ears. He didn't want to go out, and he especially did not want to meet new people. Mr. Snape sighed. It was as if he had expected this to happen. Harry felt his face start to flush.
Author's Note: So I did get multiple questions that I'm very happy to answer from snickluvah4 and cherubzenitsu at archiveofourown. They asked me:
"I will be getting you healing salves for the many bruises on your body before you sleep." Harry did not say anything so Severus left the boy. He went into his private storage for potions and salves and quickly found his Anti-Bruise salve.
"I understand, I want to be Gryffindor like my parents, but my Gran doesn't think I'll fit in." Their sympathetic faces went from Harry to Neville. Draco felt bad for the boy. Expectations, most of the time, ruin children. So he, as a child of many expectations spoke up.
"Now, we wait for the professors to come." Harry turned to his friends and watched their faces. Draco was looking calm, although his eyes shined with anxiety. Hermione was pacing, muttering under her breath. Neville, on the other hand, was looking pale and was rubbing his hands on his trousers. Harry, too was nervous and waited for the professors to come.
Author's Note: I'm done~ I hope that you liked this chapter too, and again, I'm sorry that I won't be able to update as much, but I do have a surprise for you all in the next chapter. I hope that you look forward to it!
During dinner, as Harry was to serve the chicken he had cooked, he again was tripped by his cousin, almost sending the chicken to the floor. Thankfully, Harry made sure that the chicken would fall.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and I am offering a little challenge for you all. If anyone can guess what Sev's gift to Harry is, I'll allow you a preview of the next chapter~  here's a hint, the answer has been written and published. Good luck trying to find it! Reviews are always appreciated along with constructive criticism.
Harry went downstairs to find Mr. Snape already eating breakfast while reading The Daily Prophet. Harry sat at his chair and started eating his ham and cheese sandwich.
Sorry for not updating, school just started for me... but I will try to update one - three times a week, so I apologize for slower updates from now on TT~TT. Also know that some dialogue does not belong to me, but from J.K Rowling.
"HOLY CRICKET! I didn't realize it! I read all about you though..." Harry gave a weak chuckle at Hermione.
"Well, everyone else gets in. Harry, I'll stay outside with you and your friends until the professors come to us." White said as he ushered the Hufflepuffs to the common room - after he made sure that Harry's friends had turned away and covered their ears.
"I would like to withdraw from Harry Potter's vault, please." The head goblin's head snapped to look at Harry. Severus knew that they can see behind glamors. It was a fact that not a lot of people knew.
"No, I rather have they sit together. Besides, it doesn't seem like Hermione and Draco have yet to make friends in their house." Both Harry and Justin's faces turned to look at Hermione and Draco, who were in a far corner talking. Judging from the way Hermione's hands moved and Draco was smiling, they're most likely talking about a book. Harry smiled fondly at his friends. Draco noticed Harry smiling and gave him a smile and wave back. To the corner of his eye, he saw Justin nod to Draco's greeting. Draco's smile faltered a bit, but he smiled once more and turned back to his conversation with Hermione.
Soon he and Mr. Snape left Gringotts, of course bowing their heads in thanks before leaving. He and Mr. Snape were walking down Diagon Alley. The sight of the Alley took Harry's breath away. It was beautiful. But then he realized the abundance of people and the sight almost shattered. Keyword: almost. Mr. Snape held tightly to his arm and made his way, pushing past people to reach Madam Malkin's.
Draco came out of his dorm, thankful as his roommates were starting to awaken. Surprisingly, Hermione was already on the sofa near the fireplace, reading a book. He walked up to her and cleared his throat.
"To Sirius Black, my best friend, take our cottage. It was more of your home than it was to me. Do take 2,000 Galleons too; you're going need it during these times. To Remus Lupin, my dear friend with - a furry little problem - we purchased a loft for you in London, ask Griphook for the details, but take 5,000 Galleons. Now, don't you dare say you can't because you can, Remus. Lily and I want you to have this money, Remus, you out all people deserve it. Peter, our Secret Keeper, take 8,000 Galleons for everything you've done for us. Thank you for willing to be our Secret Keeper."
"Draco, stay safe. I love you. Let me know should you require anything from home." That was his mother. Draco let himself smile for his mother and a kiss on her cheek.
Draco mused as he recalled buying Harry his owl. He remembered as he saw the snowy owl and asked his mother to buy it for him. Draco had learned that it was Harry's birthday weeks ago, but he wanted to buy his friend a gift. After his mother had bought it, he presented it to Harry as a gift. Harry had protested first, but after Draco insisted, Harry had accepted it with a hesitant smile on his face. Harry later named his owl Hedwig. Draco, on the other hand, also got an owl who he named Regal.
Ravenclaw? I am disgusted. Although you have not shamed the Malfoy name by your Sorting, you have shamed it by being friends with a Mudblood and the son of our sworn enemies. Cease contact with them immediately. You will be punished if you choose not too. I will not have my son and heir to tarnish the proud name of Malfoy with your actions. Do know that I do approve of your friendship with the Potter boy. It would do you good if you spend time with the sons and daughters of our allies. For example, your fiance, Ms. Parkinson. I am very pleased to know that her father did letter me wishing for the marriage contract between you both to not be obsolete.
"Mr. Snape? May I call you that?" At Severus's nod, Harry continued, "How did you know that I was at the Dursley's?" Severus pursed his lips and thought for a moment.
Author's Note: Hello! Again I'm sorry that I wasn't able to update for all of last week, it was my SAT week and I really wanted to study hard and well. I'll be back to my 1-3 update weekly until the week of October 14 where I plan to take my second SAT.
But Harry didn't expect to 'see' his parents. The scroll let out a puff of red and gold and showed the images of Lily and James Potter. Harry let out a gasp, as for the first time, he saw his mother. Oh, how beautiful she was! He had her eyes. He turned to his father and was surprised by how similar they looked. The only difference was their eyes. Harry drunk the sight of his parents that he almost missed his mother's voice.
"Hey, Mr. Potter. Not gonna sit with your other two friends?" Word had already spread that Harry and his friends were sitting at each other's tables during meals. Harry shook his head and smiled at the boy.
"So we can't truly break away from our prejudices? If we do so then it'll start a war between all the purebloods, right?" His mother's face pinched in response to the question. Draco knew that he was pushing it. His mother hated being questioned about the values she grew up with. More so with the idea of changing them. She still had that pinched look on her face. She looked like a regal pureblood. As pure as they can be. Draco hated that look on her. It made her more Black than Malfoy. Malfoy's were supposed to be beautiful and regal, not pinched and disturbed. Then, she looked at him smiling once more. Draco loved his mother's smile. It made her beautiful, not the cold beauty, but the warm beauty. It was a beauty for Draco and his father's eyes only.
"These owls, were they addressed to Harry?" Severus was genuinely confused if these owls were addressed to Harry, then why did he not receive them?
Author's Note: Thank you for reading the first chapter. I hope that it was satisfactory to you as the reader. Please let me know if I messed up on spelling or grammar. I currently do not have a beta to help me proofread this. If you are willing please DM me and we'll talk more about the story. Next chapter, we will be introduced to Draco and his life. Please look forward to it! Constructive criticism and reviews are welcome!!
"I, Harry James Potter, give Hermione Jean Granger and Neville Longbottom the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." Harry finished with a big smile, and Draco was proud of him. Hermione was jumpy as it was her turn to finish the dance. With a clear of her throat, she began.
She knew that Draco saw more something beyond the white peacocks in the manor. She caught him many times looking at them, with determination in her eyes. She wanted to ask, but she knew deep down that she wouldn't like what she would hear. It was a risk she was willing not to take. If her son wished to speak to her about it, then he will. But for now, she will continue to indulge her son and be his support. For that is the best she can do for him now.
As he walked back to the house, he passed by the white peacocks. Draco looked at them for a while, admiring their beauty and grace.
But most of all Draco Lucius Malfoy loved the white peacocks that lived on the manor's grounds. Oh, those white, pristine, beautiful peacocks. They were everything a Malfoy was to be, his father had told him once.
"Who are you!?" Oh no, Harry turned to see Draco blinking away his sleep, and he now stared at the red-haired boy.
, it's interesting. Who knew that magic has many theories to it. Shall we go down for breakfast?" Draco smiled at her and shook his head. Hermione cocked her head in confusion.
"I need you to take off your shirt and pants for me to put the salve on you. This salve will work to remove the many bruises your body had received. The other internal injuries will be done afterward." Severus watched Harry as he talked. Harry seemed to understand as the boy got up and started to undress. Severus scowled. The boy barely had to undress as his clothes were bigger than him. The clothes slipped off and Severus had to contain a growl. Harry was covered all over his torso with bruises. Luckily his legs were in better condition.
A ten-year-old Draco Lucius Malfoy looked at the book he was reading. It was about the Malfoy line and their achievements. To the side of this book were the Black line and their achievements. Draco wanted to know if his ancestors have done anything worthy of their name. He still wasn't sure what would make one worthy of their name. Most of his ancestors had used their names to kill, torture, and enslave. Draco did not like that... at all.
Harry and Mr. Snape sat down as Griphook left the room for a bit, muttering under his breath about 'finding that will'. Harry wondered what the will would say. Yes, he was nervous, scared, excited, and angry. These emotions clashed in Harry's heart and mind. Harry was so swept up in them that he almost didn't see Griphook coming in.
"Do you know where the Hufflepuff or Gryffindor common rooms are at? We should meet up with Harry and Neville and go to breakfast together." Sadly, Hermione shook her head, causing Draco to heave a heavy sigh once more.
Draco sighed and closed the book. He looked out the window and once more stared at the white peacocks. He started to despise them. They were everything a Malfoy should be but wasn't. Not yet though. Someday, Draco hoped that he would be worthy of his, worthy like the white peacocks outside.
Peacocks were elegant, graceful, and stunning. Yet they were also dangerous. They lulled people with their beauty and attacked when it was time. That was the perfect Malfoy. That was Draco's goal.
"Mother, Father, good morning." Both his parents accepted his greeting by inclining their heads. The Malfoys soon went outside their mansion and apparated to King's Cross Station, where they would wait for his godfather and Harry to arrive. Draco knew that his godfather couldn't be seen unless he wanted to ruin his reputation. But his godfather would never do that; so he would drop off Harry at the Muggle side of Platform 9 3/4, and Harry would meet the Malfoys on the other side.
"Sir? Why are you leaning like that? Were you hurt? You must go see Madam Pomfrey immediately!" Harry was worried. He didn't want Professor Snape to be hurt nor in pain. Except, Professor Snape just sighed and put his hand on Harry's shoulder.
"TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! Thought you ought to know." Then the man fainted. Harry saw the panic as his housemates all stood screaming. Harry heard the screams resounding the Great Hall.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes and slept. Again, he dreamed of a different dream. He dreamt of big, gentle hands carrying him. He dreamt of flying in the sky, feeling the cool wind whip around him.
Draco knew that he would have to act as the perfect pureblood heir and he hated it. He hated that he would have strut and act like a prejudiced arse too many people. Then again, that's what they expect from a Malfoy. But still, Draco hated it. He wanted to be like the white peacocks, admirable to everyone but deadly to those who provoke it. He didn't want people to fear or even hate him because of his name. More so, due to what his father had done in the War.
"I see. I forgot about that, well, I, Cedric Diggory, give Harry James Potter the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." Harry was thankful that Cedric realized what he was doing, so he responded as well.
"Hello, good afternoon to you both, have either of you seen a toad? Neville here lost his." Harry looked at Draco and he shrugged his shoulders.
"Should any of Harry's godparents be indisposed or unable to take care of him, Severus Snape shall take of him. My son will not be placed in the care of my sister, Petunia Dursley, and her family. So mote it be."
"I, Harry James Potter, give Cedric Diggory the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." A warm wash of magic surrounded the two boys as magic accepted their friendship. The other Hufflepuffs felt it as well as they looked at Harry and Cedric with awe and respect. Thankfully, to Harry's delight, they didn't say anything but continued to eat, and Harry was happy to join them as well.
It was already 9:15 and Draco and his family had just come to the Alley. Draco tried to find Flourish and Blotts over the many heads of witches and wizards taller than him. Draco sulked as he couldn't see, his height being short compared to those who were at the Alley. Draco's hand was holding his father's cloak. He wasn't allowed to clench his father nor his mother's hand, for it was improper for a pureblood like him. Draco trailed behind his parents, his eyes taking all the sights around him. He listened to the children and their parents, happy and yelling. Deep down, Draco wished that his family could be like that. He knew that it would never happen. As purebloods, they weren't able to as pureblood customs denied them this. But Draco could still hope and dream, even if they would never come true.
Author's Note: This chapter is dedicated to my grandmother, for she helped in making me the woman I am today. I hope you get better soon. I love you.
Harry was impressed, although he did laugh a bit inside at how Professor Snape subtly insulted them and all of his classes as well. Harry couldn't wait to begin. Professor Snape started the roll call for the class.
Lucius spoke in a cool manner, "I need the books for a first-year. My son will be attending Hogwarts. I assume you have the necessary books prepared?" The cashier nodded stiffly at him and pulled out the necessary books, all tied up in a neat stack, held together by rope.
Severus ate as he watched the boy. It was then he decided that he will take care of the boy and protest if anyone would say otherwise. Lily's son does not deserve to be raised by selfish witches and wizards. To be raised and become James Potter. Severus scowled at his spoon. He vowed that as long as lived, Harry James Potter will never be like his father.
Thus, Draco excitedly ran to his mother, who again was in her garden, waving his letter. His mother saw him from afar and smiled at him.
"Yes, I do. But this must go to the Ministry first correct?" Griphook nodded in response whereas Harry, well the boy looked at him with a new set of tears in Lily's eyes. Suddenly, Harry launched off his chair and hugged Severus as if he were to disappear at any moment.
"There you both are! We were waiting for you both. Where were you?" Hermione recounted their tale of going to the owlery as Draco looked around the Hall. There weren't many students nor teachers, but it would soon fill up quickly.
Severus finished his meal, feeling quite full. He rose to get healing salves and nutrient potions for the boy. The boy will have to take many potions and have salves applied many times to make sure that the physical signs of his abuse will be gone. But the mental and emotional signs will be there for a long while. But Severus was more than ready to combat that.
"We wish to speak to Griphook." James was looking around nervously while his wife was tapping her foot impatiently. Griphook came and led James and Lily to his office.
, his mind whispered to him, did not ask anything. Severus knew that he would be too hungry to ask. He'll answer Harry's questions tomorrow.
"Wait a minute, red hair, and a hand-me-down robe... you must be a Weasley!" The boy, well, Weasley flushed heavily.
Author's Note: Thank you for reading this short, this was to explain what else was said in the will. I hope that it cleared up any questions you may have on what the will also stated. As for Sirius, well you'll see what happens to our favorite Padfoot. I'll hopefully publish Chapter 4 the next day or maybe the day after tomorrow. It's a long chapter. Thank you again and see you all soon!!
"Professor, we were swept up by the Hufflepuffs that were leaving the Great Hall, we tried to tell them that we were among them, but with the chaos, they ending up taking us with them. Harry and a prefect stayed with us." Hermione stated as she took a step forward. Harry for a moment thought that she was a Gryffindor.
"You never told the boy his name. So I am right to assume that he knows nothing." That same soft tone now sounded tense, Harry knew this man was trying to be angry. Harry shuffled his feet nervously. The man still kept his eyes on Harry. It was true though. Harry knew nothing, he was never allowed to ask questions nor go to school. The man's eyes narrowed even further.
"Sir, who are they?" Severus knew he had to tread carefully. It wouldn't do any wizard nor witch any good should one insult the Goblins. Severus looked around to see that the Goblins had their beady eyes on him. He was barely able to contain a nervous swallow before answering.
As Harry turned to face Mr. Snape, he beckoned Harry to follow him. Harry followed Mr. Snape to the stairs and was soon faced with a door.
"Draco, it is time for your lesson." Draco turned away from the peacocks and looked at his father. His father stood, regal and proud. Just like what a Malfoy should be. Draco followed his father into the Drawing Room. This was were his lessons always took place.
"Mr. Snape, I mean Professor Snape shrunk my trunks down so it would be easier for me to carry. He told me to ask either Mr. or Mrs. Malfoy to unshrink them if they wished." Draco nodded and turned to his parents.
Harry was thankful that the man was also honest with him... most of the time. Harry had asked many questions ranging from how we came to be in the Dursley's care to why the Dark Lord wanted to kill him. Mr. Snape did not hold back. He told Harry all that he can and knew. But Harry knew that when it came to how his parents died, Mr. Snape held back information. Harry trusted the man and knew that he would tell Harry when the time was right to know the full length of those stories.
Author's Note: Hello! Thank you for viewing Chapter 4. I apologize if it's shorter than normal. I won't be able to update this weekend as I'll be away from home. But I will be writing still and will update when I get back home. So please look forward to a double or triple update.
So that's that ^^. I want to apologize for not updating. I hit a major writing block for this one and didn't have that much motivation to write. I'm sorry for letting you guys down TT-TT. I've been having family problems along with my writer's block too, but I managed to write this chapter for you all. I hope you enjoy it!
Sometimes, Mr. Snape was in a bad mood. Usually, it came from his work, the Potions teacher at Hogwarts - the school Harry would be attending. Harry felt bad for the man. When Mr. Snape was in a terrible mood he was always broody and moody. Harry didn't want to get in his way so he read most of the time. Harry was more attentive to when Mr. Snape felt this way. He was scared that the man might hit him if he disobeyed or was late in doing what Mr. Snape wanted him to do.
Author's Note: I'm so sorry for not publishing. For those who kept my grandma in their prayers, thank you so much. She unfortunately passed away last Sunday and my heart wasn't in it to update, but I mustered enough motivation to write this little tidbit for you all. I'll update a proper chapter next week. Thank you so much for waiting.
What. Did. She. Say? Harry felt his world shatter. All this time, he was never meant to stay with the Dursely's, but rather with Mr. Snape. Harry was furious. Eleven years of his life, all wasted and stolen away from him. Harry wanted to cry. Harry wanted to hit the person who put him with the Dursleys. He wanted to hug Mr. Snape. He wanted so much, but all Harry did was cry. And cry, and cry.
"Good morning, everyone! Hermione, you can sit next to Neville, you can sit next to Draco, and Draco can sit next to me." Draco cautiously sat next to Harry, looking at the faces of Hufflepuffs. Draco was relieved that not all of them were here yet so he could enjoy his breakfast.
"Hello, my name is Draco Lucius Malfoy. A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Diggory." Cedric smiled, seeming satisfied and impressed. Draco didn't know what about his introduction satisfied and impressed the boy, but he hoped it was about something good.
"Thanks, Mr. Diggory!" Cedric seemed confused at first, but then he realized the reason as to why Harry addressed him through last name.
Actually I lied, there is one more surprise but I won't be telling you all yet. Hehe. You'll have to wait for it. Once more, thank you so much for the love you've all given me during this work. See you all soon!!
Severus didn't know what to say nor feel. He was shocked that James Potter was able to apologize to him. Then he heard Lily's voice,
Draco is the son of a Death Eater, a Death Eater who killed family members of Hufflepuff's during the War. He was afraid of where this conversation would go.
Author's Note: Thank you so much for reading Chapter 3! I hope this gives enough background as to why Harry ended up in the care of Dursley's and how Sirius' name has been almost cleared. Next chapter finishes the day in Diagon Alley and a budding new friendship will form. Fights will also ensure. Please look forward to it!
Harry noticed weird sights after his dreams. His uncle would burn letters that came through the mail. Harry didn't know why. Uncle Vernon never burned letters, he threw them out. Harry also noticed that his uncle hasn't hit him. Aunt Petunia hadn't knocked him on the head for a while too. Even Dudley stopped hitting and picking on him too. Harry didn't understand.
This story will have a somewhat ambiguous ending, because I honestly love such endings where one can create one just for them. As for deaths, there aren't any major character deaths, just minor ones that I will warn you beforehand.
"Mr. Snape, thank you for helping me realize that I'm not a freak. Thank you for giving me a new home too. Have a good night, sir." Severus just stared as Harry walked into his room climbing onto his bed. Severus knew he was smiling, but he would never admit it to anyone who asked.
(snickluvah4) Is this story going to have a happy ending, and are there any major character deaths that I need to mentally prepare for?
"This is, Harry Potter?" Harry hesitantly nodded his head. He still wasn't sure if that was in the name. He was never allowed to know it.
"What houses do you think you'll be in? Gryffindor does hold merit, although I think I'll be Ravenclaw." Hermione moaned as she talked about it. Draco felt a little offended. This girl seemed insulted that she'll end up in a house he wished to be a part of.
"Pot-I mean Harry, sit down at the table. You are not a freak. I would tell you if you were such. But as of now, sit and eat with me." Harry felt tears filling his eyes. The man didn't think of him as a freak! But he had almost called him something else. He wondered what it was the man almost called him though.
A now eleven-year-old Harry James Potter lied awake in his Cupboard. He didn't know that today was his birthday. He didn't even know how old he was. He knew nothing. Harry sighed and turned, wishing that he would sleep. He knew that he would have to get up early to cook breakfast for the Dursley's. It was all he ever knew.
Harry resisted the urge to whimper. It would do him no good in this situation. But how did the man knew what Harry was thinking? Was he a mind-reader? Harry snorted in his head. That was impossible. Mind-readers don't exist. Those are dreams and wishes. Those never come true.
Severus distantly heard Harry crying. But he wanted to cry as well. Lily, how he missed her voice. But Harry, the boy was supposed to be in care. Harry was supposed to grow with Snape, loved, and cared for. Not to be left to the abuse of those Muggles. But Severus heard one more revelation that shocked him even more.
"They are Goblins. They are the ones in charge of the money that we wizarding folk spend on every day. We come to them if we any inquires about money or debts that we owe. At most, all of the wizarding families who live in Britain withdraw and collect their money here in Gringotts." Harry seemed to be impressed with this knowledge. Severus, on the other hand, hoped he didn't insult the Goblins. When he turned to look at them, they looked at Severus with a small glimmer of respect in their eyes, making Severus almost sigh in relief. Keyword: almost. Severus knew to control his emotions as they can and will be used against you.
"Mother, may I ask something? It's about what Father told me earlier." Narcissa Malfoy looked at her only son. Draco looked similar to Lucius, but his gentle features come from the Black line, where Narcissa hailed from. Narcissa smiled at her son beckoning him over to her.
But, when Mr. Snape was in a good mood, Harry loved to spend time with him. Mr. Snape allowed Harry to watch him brew potions and even let Harry help with brewing them. Sometimes, Mr. Snape would tell him stories of his mother. Once Harry asked about his father and Mr. Snape made an ugly face at the question, so Harry never bought it up again. Harry wondered why Mr. Snape made such a face, but Harry wouldn't push the man. Other times, Mr. Snape would give him lectures and talks about what Hogwarts would be like and how Harry should perform in the school.
"I'll file your request to adopt Harry Potter and send a copy of the will to the Ministry." Severus was thankful. The last week of August was already so busy, him having to go to the Ministry to formally adopt Harry made the week more stressful. Severus inclined his head in thanks while his arms were wrapped around Harry's lithe frame.
"It'll be alright. Should anything go wrong, me, Harry, and Neville will take care of it." The conviction in Hermione's voice made Draco chuckled and hugged her back. He was thankful for his friendship with the girl and the two other boys. He was also glad that he had his Godfather Sev to care for him too.
In the next chapter, we will find out the reason why Draco's attitude changed, warning it will be sad, meaning that you may want tissues by the end of it. The next chapter will also be the conclusion of the Christmas holidays, and we will get an inside view of Dumbledore and his odd actions. Again, I appreciate all reviews, and I will see you all soon!!
Harry ate glumly, he glum mood affecting the Hufflepuffs near him, especially his friends, including Cedric. Harry sighed and pushed his plate away. He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to look at Cedric.
"Harry... are you alright?" Harry's head snapped towards him, his emerald eyes were shining with tears. Harry just gave him a nod and never said anything.
"Severus, pleasant to meet you here. Now do drop the glamors. It's unbecoming of a fine wizard such as yourself."
"Ravenclaw isn't that bad, you know!" Draco couldn't help but sneer at Hermione. Hermione at least blushed and spluttered apologies and started saying maybe Ravenclaw wouldn't be that bad all. Draco gave her a smirk in return. Harry thought it would be a good time to talk, ruining Draco's gloating over Hermione.
"Draco, you know that I don't think of you as a mini Death Eater. You're my best friend, and I also know that you rather die than be a Death Eater. So let's forget about Weasley, and let's talk about what I read in
"Take this to my parents, boy. Thank you." With an affectionate nip to Draco's ear, Regal flapped his wings and flew out of sight. Draco turned to Hermione, who hugged him.
My friendship with Harry is coming along nicely and will continue to be that way. I do hope that you enjoy your day, Mother, Father. I will write to you soon.
"Look at me." Harry gulped and looked at the man once more. It was then he noticed his onyx eyes. They were as black as his dark cupboard. But this black held anger. Harry resisted the urge to crawl into his cupboard.
A four-year-old Harry James Potter was currently in his cupboard cradling a bruise on his arm, with tears falling down his emerald eyes. Harry knew not to cry out, he knew just to cry silently. To not make a noise, to be non-existent. This bruise, given to him by his Uncle Vernon for dropping a plate. He hadn't meant to drop it, his cousin Dudley had tripped him into dropping it. Sadly, little Harry took the punishment with his cousin snickering in the background.
"You are most welcome, Harry. Have a good night too." Severus then shut Harry's door and made his way to his room.
As Griphook left the room, he knew that it would be the last time both James and Lily Potter would set foot in Gringotts.
The woman who yelled his name in his dream was his mother. But why? Were these moments before she died? But Harry didn't want to indulge these thoughts. He wanted to be happy and continue his shopping with Mr. Snape.
"But why not, Slytherin? You have the most potential there. You will achieve many great things if you go there." Harry did not care about achieving - he wanted to be himself and feel comfortable in his house, not to be on edge and wary of everyone.
"FINE! Hanging out with mini Death Eaters, be like that. But don't come to me when that mini Death Eater betrays you for You-Know-Who!" With that, Weasley stomped out of the compartment. Harry looked at Draco, who looked depressed. Harry knew that the Death Eater comment struck a chord in Draco.
"Hello, congratulations on making it into Hufflepuff. My name's Cedric Diggory. I'm a third year. Ask away if you need help alright?" Harry nodded and shook Cedric's hand. He liked the boy already.
Severus Snape waited in the Great Hall. He was anxious as to where Harry and his godson would be. He knew that they would defy all expectations set amongst them by the British Wizarding World. Severus was excited to see the change that would come fort because of them.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderhead as I usually have to teach." Professor Snape was looking at them with contempt in his eyes.
October 31. Halloween. Harry hated Halloween. How could he celebrate a holiday that changed his life? A holiday that took his parents away from him? A holiday that forced him to be abused by the Dursley's for 11 years? Harry truly hated Halloween.
"Come out." The man said softly, yet it was a tone that demanded action. Harry slowly crawled out and was faced with a tall man. Harry stared, he didn't know what to do or say. He observed the man instead.
"Did you mean it? You want to adopt me?" Severus can even hear the desperation in his voice. "Yes, I do mean it. I want to adopt you Harry as my own." The smile Harry gave off was stunning, similar to Lily yet not Lily's smile at all.
Harry didn't want to go into the house. But it seemed that he had no choice as the man walked to the house, not caring if Harry followed or not. Harry quickly ran after him.
"Now now, there's no need for that. You did well keeping the children company. Although you could've let them have some tea and biscuits." With that said, Professor Sprout laughed a merry laugh making Harry smile. Harry could see the tension leaving the shoulders of his friends as they too, smiled.
Gringotts was beautiful and vast. Severus heard Harry gasp from beside him. He knew that the boy was impressed with the size and beauty within Gringotts. Then Harry saw the Goblins. To Severus' relief, the boy did not exclaim nor point his fingers but cocked his head in confusion.
"Get your belongings, Harry. I'm taking you with me." The room began to spin around Harry's eyes. Did he hear right? He was being taken away? Was he going to finally get a family? Was this man here to save him? But Harry began to despair. What if he takes to a place worse than the Dursley's? What if he hurts me? What if this is a dream? Tears stung Harry's eyes, but something inside told him to trust this man.
Harry looked around his "home" a small, dim place, with a single light bulb for a light and a small, dirty mattress as his bed. A small bucket on the front of his bed was his toilet. Cobwebs with small spiders were everywhere, yet Harry didn't mind their presence. This was his "home". Not what out there beyond his cupboard. His uncle made sure he would remember that.
Harry awoke to feel excited and nervous. It made his stomach churn at the thought of finally going out for the first time. He contemplated lying to Mr. Snape that he wasn't feeling well so he wouldn't have to go; unfortunately, he had to. And so, Harry rose from his bed, fixing it, and headed towards the loo.
Harry was dreading what Mr. Snape would give them. He hoped that the work wouldn't be too much either.
Suddenly, the door to their compart was wrenched open. A boy with red hair and mangy clothes stepped in.
Harry realized that some of the screams were his own. Suddenly a big boom resounded in the Great Hall.
Harry's thoughts asked him. Harry did ponder and then realized that he too wasn't a freak. He realized that he can be amazing just like Mr. Snape.
Harry found himself standing in front of the door leading into the Potions classroom. Beside him, Hermione and Draco looked nervous. They didn't know what to expect either. They all went inside, and Harry liked the room.
Oh, how the flavor flooded his mouth. Harry resisted the temptation to stuff all the food into his mouth and eat his fill. But he remembered his manners and ate as much as his mouth can fit the food.
"Harry, we love you so much. We leave you everything in our vaults so that when the day comes, it will aid you in many ways. We will always be by your side. You do us proud. From your mom and dad."
"I see. Well, then first things first. Griphook! Take Mr. Potter and Mr. Snape into the Will Room. The wills of one Lily Potter and James Potter have not been read." Behind the head goblin, another showed up,
Draco and Harry went into the train with final goodbyes and went to find a compartment. As they sat down, Draco realized how tired he was. He blamed it on how excited he was the night before, denying him sleep.
Otherwise, his days have been boring. He wandered in the manor, or he read his books to get a head start and know what he will be learning. He wondered what Harry was doing now. He found out that his godfather had been teaching Harry how to read and write, more on writing. Harry had told him how horrendous his writing was, and Draco had not believed him until he saw first hand his writing. Draco thought at first; it was a chicken who wrote, but imagine his surprise when he found out it was Harry's. Thankfully, through each letter Harry sent him, his writing got better.
Draco and his family soon left Flourish and Blotts walking back onto the streets of Diagon Alley. Draco mourned the loss of his chance to get new books but knew it was expected. The next thing Draco knew was that he in front of Madam Malkin's. Draco sighed and followed his mother and father into the store.
Harry loved Mr. Snape and Harry was sure that Mr. Snape loved him too, although he knew that the man would never say it out loud of course.
The journey to making Emerald and Howlite Eyes has been amazing with all of your support truly. So as a big thank you, it may not be much but I'm inviting all of you to AMA (Ask Me Anything) which will span from now to the next chapter where I will be answering all of your questions about this book and how it will progress. Again, ask away, and I'll answer them all. And I mean all. So please don't hold back asking; I love answering your questions and reviews. With that said, thank you so much for reading this chapter.
When morning came, Draco did not want to get up. He could not sleep due to the adrenaline coursing through his veins from being sorted into Ravenclaw. He still had not told his parents about his placement yet either. It was a conversation Draco was dreading to take part in, but Draco knew that he would have to inform his parents. They would find out either way, and the consequences of not hearing it from Draco would be terrible. So, Draco resolved to pen them a letter after he was done using the bathroom.
He looked at the peacocks once more. He knew how beautiful, elegant, and how graceful they were. Draco also knew how vicious they could be. He had seen them attacking a house elf that was supposed to kill it. Yes, they were magnificent, but they were deadly. That would be the Malfoy Draco would strive to be. To be elegant on the outside, but aim for the kill when ready. To be like the white peacocks he hated. To be the Malfoy
Sev will forever stay for pinning for lovely Lily until the end of times? Which is okay but I'm so curious.
I formally apologize for not writing the night before. I promptly slept the moment I reached the common room. I am also pleased to inform you that I had been sorted into Ravenclaw. The Ravenclaw Tower is a pleasant Tower with many books, nooks, and crannies, enabling me to read more. I am though, not sorry for being sorted into Slytherin. I am a Ravenclaw through and through, and you will both have to accept that.
"Well, Draco is my best friend, and I don't want to go with you because of what you think; and no, you cannot see my scar. Now, leave." Weasley scowled at him, and Harry could care less.
A ten-year-old Harry James Potter was currently being picked on by his cousin. He didn't understand why. On the telly, especially on the shows, his Aunt Petunia watched, a family was to care for each other, to love and cherish. Yet why was Harry unloved? Why was Aunt Petunia always yelling at him? Why was his Uncle Vernon always hitting him? Was he not their family? Harry knew the answer was no. He was never a part of the Dursely's and their perfect family. They didn't have a place for a freak like him.
"Mr. Snape, what is Hogwarts, and what invitation? I never received one." Severus sighed. "I will answer more of your questions when you sit down and eat. You are severely malnourished." Harry nodded and sat down across from Severus and looked at the food in front of him, chicken, peas, and mash potato. The sight and smell made his mouth water. He looked at Severus for permission. With Severus' nod, he began to eat.
"Yes, we purebloods are far into our prejudices that we don't see the sense in them." Draco's mother spoke carefully. Draco knew why. He knew that his mother didn't believe the words that she spoke too. Draco knew that his mother was raised with the prejudices against all who weren't purebloods. The same be told about his father. It only made sense for his father to teach him the prejudices.
Griphook came back with a blank scroll. James knew that it would transcribe all that they would say and will open the moment their son would be willing to hear them.
But Harry on the other hand, well, he'll teach Harry how to control his emotions after today. He went to the front to talk to the head goblin about Harry's vault.
"Not that much, Father. All you have told me was how he fought for us purebloods. To keep our traditions alive and remove the Mudbloods who would desire to destroy them." How Draco despised the word Mudblood. He hated how he was to look down on others for something they were born with. But Draco's father approved of what he said.
Harry was elated. Mr. Snape wanted him! He was officially getting a new family. This instantly made him feel so much better than he had originally felt. He was happy to finally hear and see his parents. And then, it hit Harry.
First, I want to say thank you to all those who have been reading this book on all three websites I used to publish this book.
Draco was pleased when he heard what Harry said. He was glad that his best friend knew and understood him so well. He was also glad that the Weasley git finally left. Draco was very tempted to give him a good hex before arriving at Hogwarts. Draco gave Harry a weary smile and sat down with him. Draco was hardly paying attention to what Harry was saying. He was too focused on Harry was talking so animatedly. Before, Harry would barely talk and animate his speech. Now, he would do it a lot especially when talking to Draco and it made him happy. This is a side of Harry that'll only I'll see, Draco thought smiling at Harry. Harry smiled back and continued to talk.
A seven-year-old Draco Lucius Malfoy was learning about how purebloods were superior to all. Draco would tell his father that he understood but would go onto his mother for questions. He remembered the last time he asked his father about pureblood superiority. His father's lips thinned and his howlite eyes narrowed. His father told him to never question but to understand and know.
She looked at her son who appeared to be nervous. She didn't fault Draco, after all, it was his first time in Diagon Alley. She could smell the anxiety from her son, and if she could smell it, then so could the others staring at them. She dared them, with her eyes, to pounce on him. Narcissa will strike at them, with the grace of the white peacocks at Malfoy Manor.
Draco Lucius Malfoy, to Lucius Malfoy, would disappoint all those around him and soon be branded as a blood traitor. Inwardly, Lucius hoped that he would be able to banish Draco should it ever come to that, especially before others would find out. His son would also not be good to serve his lord. His lord would kill Draco. But Lucius still hoped that he will be able to shape Draco to be able to serve the Dark Lord when he returned. Lucius still hoped that Draco would be worthy of the name he carries.
He approached the cashier who looked at him stiffly. He knew that the cashier wished to refuse his services, but Lucius could hardly care at all.
"Mother! My Hogwarts letter came in! Can we go to Diagon Alley to purchase my supplies?" Draco was ecstatic and bouncing on the heels of his feet. Oh, how we wanted to go to Diagon Alley. He wanted to see the sights and smell the food. He wished to get his wand and a pet too. Of all most, he wanted to go to Flourish and Botts, a bookstore with a plethora of books. Books where he can imagine a new world for himself, where his curiosities would be satisfied.
"That was the magic binding us all. It accepted our four-way truce and gave us its blessing. Should we break this truce, I heard that terrible things would happen to the person that breaks it." Everyone, including Draco shuddering in fear. None of them were willing to break this truce and see what would happen.
"I'm glad to know you all. Harry was telling us about you three, and I wanted to see it for myself. Take care of Harry alright?" Cedric gave them a soft smile, and Draco was glad that the boy did not have anything against him.
"Well, for starters, you all pushed us here as we tried to go back to our housemates," Hermione said with a sniff, looking at the Hufflepuffs. White, flushed and rubbed his neck.
"So, we're all happy that we got in the houses we wanted?" Neville asked them, grinning from ear to ear. Hermione couldn't help but smile back and eagerly nodded her head.
Does anybody know how to contact the other prefects and tell them that we have their missing housemates?" Everybody shook their heads.
Mr. Snape had told Harry about the War and how it changed everyone. He also told Harry to be wary of many Dark aligned pureblood families for many supported the Dark Lord during the War and may want to hurt Harry. Harry was frightened but he knew that Mr. Snape would teach him to defend himself and would protect him.
Harry couldn't help himself. He flinched, thinking that the man was going to hit him. When he felt nothing, Harry opened his eyes to see the man's arm waiting for him to take it. His eyebrow-raising to show his impatience and his eyes shone with emotion that Harry couldn't name.
The common room was beautiful. The architecture was astonishing. Although Hermione wished to ogle it more, she was tired and wanted to rest. It seemed that the prefects knew of this and quickly sent the rest of the first years to their beds. Hermione gave Draco a sleepy wave before she went inside her room. She was also too tired to know her roommates, and just as she flung her body onto the bed, she quickly fell asleep.
Harry's heart pounded. How did this man know he was in the cupboard? He heard the latch of his cupboard being undone and the door opened. Harry didn't dare to step out. He was frightened of what he would see beyond his cupboard.
"My name is Lily Potter, née Evans. Harry, our son, this will is made for you, to be seen and read after we die."
Harry turned to Mr. Snape and gave him a beaming smile. Mr. Snape gave Harry a small smile in return.
Ever since Mr. Snape bought him to his home, Harry never ventured outside. He didn't know what to expect should he ever venture outside. Even if Mr. Snape left to go to Hogwarts for the Headmaster's sake, Harry stayed home and waited for the man. Then again, Harry was never allowed to go more than the backyard of the Dursley's. This would be Harry's first time going out. He wondered what to wear and how to act. Harry felt a bit better with the knowledge that he was to be glamoured but was nervous. He washed his plate and started to read Mr. Snape's copy of Edgar Allen Poe's
The walk to potions was dreadful. Harry could feel the tension and fear as the Hufflepuffs, as well as the Ravenclaws all, walked together. They all had heard about the horror stories from their upperclassman about how cruel Professor Snape was to anyone who wasn't a Slytherin. Many of them had called Mr. Snape's mean names, which made Harry mad and sad. Not only that, during lunch, but Neville also was not present as he went to the Hospital Wing for getting boils all over him. They had heard that Mr. Snape insulted Neville, and the Gryffindors were cursing Mr. Snape's name.
Harry closed his eyes and slept. He dreamed of a woman who screamed a name and a flash of green light. She screamed the name, Harry. Who was, Harry? Was that him? But why would a woman scream his name? But what was the flash of green light?
A four-year-old Draco Lucius Malfoy, his howlite eyes were twinkling with curiosity. He loved to explore the manor he lived in. He loved to read all the books in the library as well. He loved spending time with his mother. He loved learning with his father.
Harry went back inside to cook lunch when Dudley came home. He knew to make his favorites. Dudley would throw a tantrum if his favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich were not at the table along with his favorite glass of chocolate milk. He made Aunt Petunia's favorite salad, crisp vegetables, and ripe tomatoes from her garden. He also started dinner for the Dursely's. Pasta with a side of salad, along with corn and bread. These were the food Harry knew he would never be able to eat. When Harry finished, Aunt Petunia ushered him into his cupboard.
Harry hoped. He hoped that he would be placed in Hufflepuff and not Gryffindor. It seemed that the Sorting Hat knew this.
"I have to write to my parents about my Sorting. Hopefully, my father won't be too mad at me. My mother, I know, would understand as to my placement in Ravenclaw." With a sigh, Draco started walking to the entrance of their Common Room with Hermione trailing behind him.
Draco couldn't wait for September 1, the day where we would attend Hogwarts. He was also nervous for he didn't want to be in Slytherin but Ravenclaw. He also hoped that deep down that Harry would join him in Ravenclaw, but Harry just screamed Hufflepuff than Ravenclaw. But thankfully, Draco and Harry can still be friends. And so, Draco slept dreaming of meals with Harry.
"You said supposed, not must, so we can sit where we choose too. We can sit at the Hufflepuff table, I'm sure that none of them would mine. Besides, they want to meet my friends." With a smile, Harry led his friends to the Hufflepuff table. Draco knew the other two were worried, and so was he.
It has now been two months since Emerald and Howlite Eyes has been published. I'm honestly so thankful for the love, support, reviews, hearts, kudos, votes, follows, and favorites I've received for this work. Another big thank you for the accumulated 4,000 views. This means a lot to me. As a thank you, I'll be answering any questions still about this work, and also am open for any of you all to ask questions tailored personally to any character you wish. Also, one final announcement: I am planning to make this into a multi-book series. I'm still thinking about how it'll go, but I do have a general outline of what I want, but as to how many books? No idea ^^. But that's all I have to say.
Harry still hoped that he would be fed. How his stomach starved and craved for food. Yet deep inside, he knew that he would be forgotten and be left to starve for many days. He also knew that hope didn't exist for freaks like him.
First and foremost, I'm so sorry that I haven't updated in a while. I recently took my SAT and used the week to study for it. I'll be back with 1-3 updates per week again. Thank you for understanding and I hope you enjoy the chapter!
"Do follow me, please. I will show you both the Will Room. Inside, I will read to you the will of Lily and James Potter." Severus was nervous. He didn't know what to expect. The last time he heard Lily's voice, was when he called her a filthy mudblood. Her melodious voice was hurt and filled with grief. She then ignored him until her unfortunate demise. Severus did not know what to expect, but he numbly followed Griphook to the Will Room.
Draco was excited. Tomorrow he would be going with his parents to Diagon Alley to purchase his school materials. He couldn't wait especially to go to Flourish and Blotts to see the collection of books they may have, especially the ones not in the Malfoy library.
"No, as Draco said, we can give you explicit permission so that you can address us by first name, so, I, Neville Longbottom, give Hermione, "Jean" as Hermione butt in. "Granger, Draco Lucius Malfoy, and Harry James Potter the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." Draco was thoroughly impressed. Neville had said the proper dance to initiate a tender truce between him and the other three should they choose to accept. Even more when he remembered that the woman's name was to be said first. Many people tend to forget thus failing the dance. Neville, to Draco, thought he was brave to start this with Draco who hails from a Dark family while Neville's was that of the Light. It would be rude not to give them all the same courtesy.
September 1, it was finally here. Draco quickly got ready was downstairs waiting for his mother and father, both would drop him off at the train.
"Good morning, sir." Mr. Snape glanced at Harry and nodded in greeting. Harry wondered what was so interesting about the article. Mr. Snape will probably tell me anyways, Harry thought as he drank his glass of milk.
"I will get the scroll, excuse me." As Griphook left, James turned to his wife. Lily Potter looked nervous. James knew why. In exactly two days from now, the Potters would be under a
I am very proud of you, Draco. Your father is currently seething at your Sorting and wishes for a re-Sorting. It has been many centuries that a Malfoy and Black have not been sorted into Slytherin. Do give your Father time, he will come through, I will make sure of it.
"Why are you with a git like Malfoy? He's a Dark wizard. You belong with Light wizards like me. Come on, I'll take you to my compartment. By the way, can I see... you know, the scar?" Harry was disgusted. First, this boy insults Harry's first best friend then dares to ask him if he could see his scar? Harry was sure that the disgust was ever-present on his face because Weasley flushed.
Draco went to his mother after his father dismissed him. He found Narcissa Malfoy at the gardens as she admired the white roses that grew there.
Lucius felt the many eyes on him. He remembered the harsh voice of his father, Abraxas Malfoy, drilling him into the perfect pureblood face, one of cold indifference. He knew that many people would talk and whisper the moment he and his family left the store. Behind him, he could feel Draco's disappointment in being unable to purchase more books. Lucius too mourned the loss. He would have been happy to buy his son more books specialized in the Dark Arts.
"Hello, my name is Cedric Diggory. What's yours?" Draco heard the boy, Cedric, talking to Neville. Neville gave him a shy smile and shook Cedric's hand.
"Hello, Mr. Diggory. My name is Neville Longbottom, nice to meet you." Cedric smiled at Neville and turned to Hermione getting her name. Soon, Cedric turned to him and asked for his name. Draco gulped. He knew the boy was at the Sorting and saw him getting Sorted as well, so why did he want to know again? But Draco will indulge him and find out.
"Well, white hair, and a stuck-up attitude... you must be a Malfoy!" Weasley exclaimed loudly, causing Draco to lift an eyebrow. Weasley soon turned back to Harry.
"We didn't know how to contact any of you." Prefect White spoke up inclining his head towards the Professors and Headmaster. "I also want to apologize as a prefect for not realizing that we had students that weren't of our house with us. I'm sorry, Professor Sprout." The head-of-house for Hufflepuff smiled gently at White and patted his arm.
Author's Note: And that's a wrap! Yes, Voldie is back in the game! On another note: This chapter is indeed dedicated to my grandmother. I received word that she has terminal cancer, and lately it's been hard to have motivation to write. This does NOT mean that I'm quitting writing this book. In fact, this book is distracting me right now, which I need. I know that many of you may not be religious, but if you can please pray for her, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much for your love and support. See you all soon.
"What do you mean, sit for breakfast? We are supposed to sit at our respective tables." Harry frowned at him, making Draco frown back. What game was Harry playing at? Then Harry smiled at him. Draco did not like the mischievous smile on his face making him worry about the outcome.
Their night was spent with Neville, learning about each other's classes, along with reassuring Neville; that Professor Snape was not mean nor terrifying.
White tapped the barrel to the rhythm of their house founder, Helga Hufflepuff, causing the barrels to move aside, exposing the tunnel that leads into the Hufflepuff Sett. After the last first-year Hufflepuff went in, White turned to look at the remaining first years.
"Come, we should head to Diagon Alley. The quicker we get our business done there, the sooner we can come back." Harry agreed. He didn't want to stay in a crowded place more than necessary. Mr. Snape abruptly turned and flicked his wand towards Harry. Harry then felt magic wash over him. Mr. Snape must have cast the glamor on me, Harry thought as he saw the man's appearance change before his eyes. Mr. Snape's face became leaner and more defined. His hair became auburn with his onyx eyes becoming brown as well. Mr. Snape resembled an everyday wizard allowing Harry to think that he appeared similar to the man. He followed Mr. Snape outside their home and grasped his arm.
"I want to go into Hufflepuff. I know that people want me in Gryffindor, but it just doesn't feel right, being a Gryffindor." Both Hermione and Neville looked at Harry with sympathy on their faces.
Griphook left the room, with Severus and Harry still in it. Harry's head looked at him, eyes shining in desperate hope.
Narcissa Malfoy loved hearing her son talk. She loved hearing his thoughts, no matter how heretical they were. She loved how his howlite eyes sparkle with life, how he looked for all the angles and the in-betweens of everything.
"Harry, we should buy your school supplies for Hogwarts." Harry stopped dead. He was currently eating lunch with Mr. Snape and his arm which was holding his spoon filled with food stopped mid-air.
Lucius felt annoyed and displeasure at the amateur scowls on the faces of many people. Their scowls were quite pathetic when he looked them over once more. His eyes narrowed, but he did not say anything. He never had too.
"Well, Ms. Granger, wizards and witches, especially purebloods, always address each other with their family name, unless the families are allied or you are given explicit permission to call them by their first name." Hermione nodded, scrunching her eyebrows in thought. Harry nodded solemnly, sighing at the same time.
"BOY! HOW DARE YOU ALMOST DROP OUR FOOD?!" Harry flinched as his hope for food extinguished as his Uncle's spittle hit his face.
Draco felt claustrophobic. Although people moved all around him and his family, he felt crushed underneath their stares, their eyes who judged him for every breath and step he took. Suddenly, Draco understood why his father had told him to watch his emotions. One small twitch of his eyebrows will have people thinking that the Malfoys were plotting something evil. Draco knew that he couldn't blame them. He just wished they stopped staring. Draco's father ordered all his books while his mother looked at the endless amount of eyes on them. Draco wanted to get more books to read. He knew he wouldn't be allowed to, especially not with all the eyes on him and his family.
"Those are the traditions that have led our families for many millennia. We do not question but follow them as it kept our families alive and prosperous for a long time." Draco had a sinking feeling that was the case. So he sighed in response.
"Mr. Potter, if you may, please take out your trunk?" Harry nodded and took the small trunk out of his pocket. He laid the trunk on the ground. Draco's father pointed his wand at the trunk, and a whispered spell unshrunk Harry's trunk. Draco wished to know what spell this was. But he'll find out either way without asking. Draco was resourceful this way.
"Hello, Mr. Malfoy." Draco almost jumped off his seat, but he told himself to stay calm. So he spoke in his mind.
"Stay well, son. Do write to us about your Sorting." That was his father, Draco knew that he wouldn't show much, and he truly didn't care much.
"Malfoy, Draco Lucius Malfoy. A pleasure to meet you both." He went first to give his friend time to pick himself up and introduce himself.
Whew, and done! Sorry for posting a few minutes late, I was formatting again TT~TT. But I hoped that you enjoyed the reconciliation between father and son, even though it was somewhat forced.
Next chapter is a surprise~ to keep you all guessing. Know that questions and reviews are welcome. Just to let you all know, I'm still looking for beta(s) who are willing to help me with this project. If you're interested let me know. Thank you so much and see you all soon!
"Harry, I am so proud of you, my son. Your father and I are so sorry you have to lead the life you will lead. But Harry, I know you will do us proud. Don't listen to those who you want you to become like us, no Harry, be you. Be proud of who you are, and do things that will make you happy, not because it's expected of you."
"Harry, when we die, you must be in the care of your godfather, Sirius Black. If Sirius is unable to take you, then Alice Longbottom will take care of you. Should any of Harry's godparents be indisposed or unable to take care of him, Severus Snape shall take of him. My son will not be placed in the care of my sister, Petunia Dursley, and her family. So mote it be."
Charm cast by Dumbledore. Originally Sirius, James' best friend, was to be the Secret Keeper - the one who would keep their location a secret - but Sirius convinced them that it should be Peter Pettigrew, another friend of James. Their lives would forever change, as both would not be able to leave their house, leaving their home to endanger not just themselves but their only son, Harry James Potter.
Oddly enough, it seemed that the man knew what he was thinking as he rounded onto his uncle and aunt.
"I almost called you, Potter, that is your last name. My name is Severus Snape. You may call me whatever you wish, but do make sure that it is appropriate, such as sir." The man, now identified as Severus Snape said. Harry was happy. He now knew the name of his savior.
"Ehem, if I may have both of your attention, please?" Both Harry and Mr. Snape's head watched Griphook as he unfolded the scroll containing the will of both Harry's parents.
The inside of the house was different than the outside. Inside, the house was warm. Although it was covered with dark colors, it made Harry feel warm and safe. Harry looked around a bit more and found a table with two chairs along with a meal for two. The man was already sitting down at the table. But he hadn't touched his food. Harry wondered if the man had any guests he was expecting.
They suddenly appeared in front of a black house. It seemed dead and dull looking on the outside. It seemed scary for Harry. His awe for how they traveled did not overwhelm his urge to be sick. He felt sick and wanted to throw up. But Harry knew that there would be nothing to throw up. He hadn't eaten for two days.
"Why address each other through your last names?" Now, this is one of Draco's expertise, pureblood manners - drilled into him by his mother. For once, Draco was glad for the lessons and hoped that Merlin forgive him for all the times he cursed his mother in his mind.
Professor Flitwick soon took Hermione and Draco back to Ravenclaw dorm, and Professor McGonagall did the same for Neville. Professor Sprout was about to usher Harry and White into the dorms, but Harry stayed as he saw Professor Snape's expression.
Draco and his parents waited for almost five minutes, then Harry appeared with Hedwig in her cage, his trunk nowhere to be seen. Harry must have seen his confusion.
Severus Snape took Harry James Potter into Gringotts. They had come at 8:30 and there were barely any people in Diagon Alley, a fact which greatly relieved Severus. Severus looked down at his... ward. Yes, ward was an appropriate method term to call Harry. Harry looked nervous and frightened. Severus felt the need to comfort his ward.
"When will be leaving, sir?" Mr. Snape gave Harry a gentle smile. "Tomorrow. So you are free to do what you wish until bedtime. Do wake up at 8 o'clock; the earlier we are, the better. We have to go to Gringotts as well to get you the money you need to purchase your school materials." Harry nodded and continued eating his lunch. He was nervous yet excited.
"It's alright, Harry. I will make sure that no one harms you while we are here." The tension in Harry's shoulders seemed to deflate, just by a little. Severus knew that the boy was never allowed to go out before. To be honest, he was nervous about the boy. But he must let Harry know of what he has, especially what was left to him from his parents.
She started cooly back at the eyes on her. She quietly dared them to say anything about her husband or child. If they did, they will see the Black witch Narcissa grew to be.
"Ask away my son." Draco's eyes lit up. Oh, how he loved talking to his mother about his ideals. Although he knew that his mother would be uncomfortable with most of his ideals, she still entertained him. He knew how they did not align with that of his father and ancestors. But Draco did not care. He only cared about learning more, being more than a name, to be a true Malfoy worthy of his name.
"I travel all over the world, but always stay in my corner. What am I?" Hermione gasped. She knew this one! She moved her way towards the knocker and proclaimed with a loud voice.
I am proud to say that it has been one month since Emerald and Howlite Eyes has been published!! *throws confetti*
Yes, we now have a set schedule. Questions and Reviews are always welcome. Next chapter should hopefully be the end of Christmas. I feel that I prolonged the holiday more than necessary hehe. See you all next Sunday!!
"Draco, I will tell you something that you are not allowed to repeat at all to outsiders of our family. Do you understand me?" Draco was nervous. What did his Father want to tell him? But Draco nodded anyways.
"Oh wait, where are my manners, I haven't introduced myself. My name is Hermione Granger, and this is Neville Longbottom. May we know yours please?"
She loved her son, although she wondered where all the questions about the pureblood idealism came from. Her son shouldn't be like that. He should accept them and be them, yet he always questioned her. It was partially her fault, she indulged him. She should have shot down all his questions and leave him be. Yet she indulged him, again and again. She knew Lucius had a temper and would probably hurt Draco should he question the pureblood idealism in front of him. Yet why did she have to be the recipient of these questions? Yet for some reason, she also didn't mind.
Suddenly, soft yet confident steps walked into the house. Harry assumed that this was the man who was talking to his uncle. He could now hear the man's voice, clearer, but now filled with anger and impatience.
"I will ask one more time, where is Harry Potter?" By then he heard Aunt Petunia's swift steps walking to the door. He wondered who this man was to make Aunt Petunia go to the door. Most of the time people left when they encountered his angry Uncle. Harry didn't hear what happened next sadly. He was too busy pondering and was still ecstatic of having a name.
Harry found himself amazed. All of a sudden Mr. Snape pulled out an object that looked similar to a twig and changed Dudley's hand-me-downs into clothes that are clean and seem like they fit him!
Hermione and Draco went back to their Housemates, who stood waiting for them with various expressions on their faces. Neither Hermione nor Draco cared for what they thought. House divisions will never break their friendship, and that is how it will be for the rest of their lives.
"That will be; 2 galleons and 15 sickles, Mr. Malfoy." Lucius barely spared the cashier a glance and took the money needed to pay. Once he received the books, he shrunk them and put them into his cloak's pocket.
"Thank you, Griphook." He turned to face James Potter, whose arms were around his wife, comforting her as she cried. Griphook, once more noded. He didn't know what to say. What right does a Goblin have in these kinds of matters?
Author's Note: Thank you for reading the second chapter of Emerald and Howlite Eyes! I hope you also enjoyed this chapter. I hoped I characterized the characters well and gave you an insight to their personalities. Next chapter, will be Harry and Draco's first meeting in Diagon Alley. More drama unfolds. I'm still looking for a beta so please DM me if you want to help out. Also, please let me know if I misspelled anything or made grammar mistakes. All reviews are welcome and please remember, constructive criticisms!
A cool, rich, baritone voice spoke out. "Where is Harry Potter?" Harry... the name that the woman yelled in his dreams! Did that mean his name was Harry and not Freak? Harry was ecstatic. He had a name! He had to return his attention to what was going on. He didn't want to miss what the man was going to say.
"Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Longbottom, and Ms. Granger! Explain what you three are doing since you should have been in your common rooms a while back!" Professor McGonagall stated with a stern look on her face. With her was Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, Professor Snape, and Headmaster Dumbledore. Harry unconsciously took a step back the moment he laid his eyes on the Headmaster.
Severus stared at the boy. It seemed as if Harry was debating something in his mind. Suddenly, Harry turned to him and hugged him. The last person to have hugged him was Lily. Lily, oh how he missed her. Severus didn't know how to react so he lamely put his arm around Harry as well.
"What are you three doing here?!" The Hufflepuff prefect, Michaelis White, screeched, looking at Harry's friends.
Harry once more looked at the man. He seemed to be shaking out of anger. But why was he angry? Harry understood why he denied these things. He was a freak and never belonged. He didn't deserve many things. Yet why did this man seem so angry after finding this out?
"We should go visit, Neville." It was Draco who suggested this. Harry was glad for Draco. Draco was able to make more friends who didn't want to use him for his fame nor money.
"It's alright. I can sit with Mr. Finch-Fletchley, he's my roommate, and he wouldn't mind so much." With that said, Harry walked over to Justin and gave him a smile.
Sections of dialogue in this chapter do not belong to me. They belong to J.K Rowling's Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. Thank you and enjoy the chapter.
"It was magic, Harry. You will soon be able to do what I did." Harry was ecstatic. He too wanted to learn magic. To do what Mr. Snape just did. He then remembered the clothes lying on the floor. He looked at Mr. Snape, silently asking for permission to wear the clothes. When Mr. Snape nodded, Harry immediately tried on the clothes. He was amazed at how well they fit him. The clothes were also warm and fluffy.
