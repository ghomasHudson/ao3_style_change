"Okay."
“Perhaps,” McGonagall said, “but if she thought teaching at this school would feel leisurely in comparison, I’m afraid she was mistaken.”
to have Mr. Potter join them. I am merely trying to make sure he knows what he is getting himself into.”
“Alright then, I ought not to keep Scamander waiting,” Harry said. “You’ll be up next, Theodore, don’t worry.”
“They’re just trying to keep him occupied while they try to figure out the Malfoy situation,” Arthur said. “Luckily, I’m the only one who knows you had the Wadjet at one point.”
“So your family knows that you’re…”
came back”, Harry said hoarsely, battling the itch in his throat. “How the hell does Seamus already know what I was doing?”
“We have to wait. They’ll notice sooner or later.”
"I'll do it if it's so important to you," he said. "I can owl you the papers as proof when I get to London."
"I don't know, in the morning at some point… " Harry held a palm to his head. "Fuck - It won't stop, I'm trying, but it won't..."
“I- I don’t know. Why did you?”
Harry returns to Hogwarts to investigate the murder of professor Toadsworth, only now he has Draco with him at work. Keeping things professional could prove a problem to some in that situation, but not to Harry, surely?
“He was crying because he was afraid of how Ron would react if he found out.”
“Although," he said, “I don’t really know if Draco wants to be friends with me.”
"How's the coffee?"
"And yet you still say my name like that. Malfoy," the blonde said, stretching the vowels, mocking Harry. "The boy who spoke the name of you-know-who can't say 'Malfoy' without making it sound like a bad word."
“Norberta,” George corrected. “Not to impose gender roles on it, but... Boy, is that creature vicious. Charlie has a new scar every time I see him. Harry's got nothing on him.”
“I don’t know," Harry said, shrugging. “I just have a feeling he would be kind of a dick about it, you know? And I don’t want to get into a whole argument about it, at least not yet. It’s not like Draco and I are
“Did anything about Toadsworth strike you as odd? Anything that she said, or her mannerisms, perhaps…”
“Oh?” Harry said, a smile creeping up to his face. “How?”
"So Lucius was not wrong to worry," Remus then said, placing down his mug. "Harry really has corrupted his son."
"Yeah," Draco said. "I suppose we should be grateful."
“No,” Draco said and crossed his arms. “Harry, what’s going on?”
Harry fumbled for his wand but clearly it had rolled under the bed again, because he could manage nothing more but a poor attempt to hide behind Draco when the bug came around again.
“Hardly,” Harry said. “Oh, here she comes now.”
Neville's friends try to cheer him up. Harry learns of the nicknames Dean and Seamus have for each other and finds himself in an odd situation with Draco Malfoy.
“I’m not an electrician," Harry said. “Even if they already knew the lift was stuck, it would probably take at least half an hour for someone to get here.”
“Right?” Hermione said, her eyes wide. She sighed, and her shoulders fell a bit. “Someone understands at least," she said. “I talked about it to Ron, but he thinks making it downright illegal would be overreacting.”
An amused huff escaped into the bottom of Draco’s now empty glass. How many cases ago had this been? It must have been a year already since they had come to Fort William, so six months from the wedding. Draco leaned back in the chair, content despite everything, still in disbelief that they had managed to get the house. Not that they didn’t have the funds - though the same couldn’t have been said for Draco’s work brewing Headache Potions at a small clinic nearby, Harry’s work was well paid for. It was just the nature of his work that the loan negotiator at Gringotts hadn’t found most reassuring. According to him, Aurors were twice as likely as anyone else to get killed on duty, and even worse, not be able to pay back their loans. To this, Draco and Harry had glanced at each other and shared a smile. They had agreed not to tell the goblin at Gringotts that as soon as they had secured the house, Harry was going to quit.
Harry sighed and and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. He rubbed the bridge of his nose where his new glasses had left indentions.
“Crummy place to die, wouldn’t it have been? Under my bed”, Draco said and looked at Harry, whose insides fluttered as imaginary butterflies came to be within them. “I was going to take it outside once I was here, but…” Draco lifted his hand to pet Hugo, and the owl happily snuggled against his arm. “I guess this bugger needed it more. What’s its name?”
Ron did end up winning that game of chess, but Draco didn't mind. Truth be told, somewhere along the way, with all of them sitting in the living room with the fireplace going and Harry sitting next to Draco, one hand nonchalantly on his thigh and a small, red glass of fire whiskey in the other, the lights of the irrationally decorated Christmas tree reflecting off of it, Draco had forgotten how chess ought to have been played. But that sort of thing can happen when one starts to enjoy themselves.
Harry walked to the desk. The first drawer was closed just as before, but now the corner of a piece of parchment was sticking out of the crack. Harry carefully pinched it in between his index finger and thumb and started to slowly, gently drag it across the top of the drawer.
Harry took Draco's hand long before they disapparated.
? At Hogwarts or Darthorn?”
Hermione smiled. “Kind of like friends do?”
Harry chuckled.
“Harry, the old chancer!” Seamus patted Harry on the shoulder as he sat down next ho him. “I was hoping I’d run into you one of these days.”
“Alright. I can come help you look.”
"Well, you have been distracted lately," Remus offered. "You can allow yourself a bit of happiness."
“Is he okay?” Hermione mouthed.
"We have," Draco said before Harry could answer. "And I don't care. I mean- what more can they do? Legally I'm not even a part of the family anymore."
“No," Draco repeated and looked at Harry, the
Draco tilted his head.
This made Harry feel particularly anxious, because he didn’t ever remember feeling so good with someone. And Draco didn’t even have to do anything - just having him there in the same room, Harry felt like he didn’t have to think or worry or even be Harry Potter. And it had all come to be by pure coincidence. Had someone told Harry during the summer holidays that this would happen, he would have never believed them. But here they were, he and Draco, in a gray area, a danger zone where one either had to jump or turn back, and Harry didn’t want to turn back. He had never wanted to
Under the question there were two boxes, one for “yes” and another for “no”. Harry checked off the “yes.” A text appeared under it.
“Take off your glasses," Draco said. Harry did and placed them in Draco’s hand that was already held out, waiting. Draco placed the glasses on the writing desk and then turned his attention back to Harry. His gaze brushed past Harry’s mouth again, and only that was enough to create an anticipating shudder in him. What was taking him so long?
"Uh," Harry said, "I wrote about it."
Harry found Neville and Hermione knitting in the living room. They were sitting side by side on the tartan sofa that was so faded it seemed to possess no perceivable colour whatsoever.
“How can you tell?” Harry asked, his forehead creasing.
“Then, my lad, I suppose you will just have to come up with a large enough amount of pumpkin tarts to bribe me with. The same works for surprisingly many Dark Arts practitioners, I’ve noticed… If you ask me, the only reason we have all these goons lurking about these days is that there is that people have started to worry about eating too much sugar. What a ghastly existence…” One of professor Toadsworth’s assistants coughed politely and interrupted the professor’s trail of thought. “Oh, yes. Of course - let’s begin, shall we?”
“And I just, I want to be at least somehow worthy, you know?” Ron turned around and poured cereal into his mouth straight from the box.
“Yeah.”
The room was just large enough to fit a bed and a small dresser with an oil lamp on it. The bed was comfortable, Draco had decided after throwing himself on it, but the ceiling slanted so that there were few corners in the room where he could stand up straight. Draco took out the enchanted book he had brought with him and opened it where he had last folded the corner of a page (a bad habit he had picked up from Harry) and dropped the book with a flinch. At first he thought there were small bugs climbing all over the book, but then realized it was the words spilling out. They floated about and stuck to everything like static lint, and Draco spent the next fifteen minutes trying to get a particularly stubborn “impartial” off the quilted bedspread. When he finally succeeded, it didn’t take him long to realize that he was still no victor. The words were all over his hands, his trousers, probably even his face, and to his horror he found that Scourgify wasn’t enough to get rid of them. This had happened to him a lot as a child when he hadn’t yet learned the correct amount of books one book could contain, but he couldn't, for the life of him, remember what his mother had used to make the words disappear. He grabbed a towel from the chair next to the window and scrubbed his hands with it, but the words wouldn’t budge; they might as well have been printed on his skin. He groaned and sat down to inspect the book. About one fourth of the pages were empty now, and as much as he tried, he couldn’t get any words to stick on it unless he wrote some down himself. He had trouble understanding what could’ve gone so wrong with the enchantment, but then, Transfiguration never had been one of his strong suits.
Harry woke up to a quiet rumble. He opened his eyes, almost certain that he'd be faced with the rough panelling of the cupboard under the stairs, and found himself looking at a very much awake Draco. The room was dark, and while Harry now remembered the conversation turning sleepy after an hour or so, there was no guessing how long they had slept.
“Please make haste,” the Headmistress said, standing up to see them out. “The parents of the students are bombarding me with letters, and no less than four students have already been pulled out of the school entirely to be sent overseas to Ilvermorny. Can you imagine?”
Harry forced himself to think straight again, and in the blue light of the spell, he noticed white lines on Draco's neck. They didn’t quite look like scars, but something very closely related. They looked like they continued down from Draco’s neck to his chest.
“Stop worrying," Draco said (as if it were so easy, Harry thought) as he turned to look at the gargoyle. “
“What?” Draco looked down at his chest.
“No," Draco said, his eyes wide. “Why do you have to be like that?”
Draco wheeled around and watched as Harry went to his room and returned with the Hubert Lanky book Draco had borrowed him earlier.
For a moment it was dark, and Harry had to cast
“However, I was beginning to doubt whether you would do us the honour of appearing within these grounds before New Year's. I am sorry to say it, Mr. Potter, but timing has never been your strong suit."
Harry laughed with the others. He felt a small sigh of relief escape him when he realized a few minutes later that Ron and Seamus were already in a debate over which team was going to win the big game next week. Nothing had changed after all. Well, Dean's arm was wrapped around Seamus' shoulder. But nothing else. Looking at them, Harry felt a strange pinch of melancholia in his chest. He figured he was hungry and went to make himself a sandwich.
“No, no, I can’t-”
"Maybe you didn't listen."
“I’ll come to class next time. You happy now?”
“No, no. Well, he
“So, I-”
“I’m sorry too," Ron said, his shoulders dropping. “I- I can’t promise I’ll get along with Malfoy, but it won’t change things between you and I. I'm just - I'm not really used to the idea yet, but I will be. At some point.”
“Oh jesus fuck," Harry breathed, wiping his eyes. Draco felt the last bit of giggle escape him, and then Harry turned to look at him. Something was in the air that hadn’t been there before, and it made them both look away before giving whatever it was a chance to become so obvious they’d have to talk about it.
thinking about it, he felt his blood rush into very inconvenient places considering where he was. He imagined kissing Draco out of the blue. Draco definitely wouldn’t kiss him back, Harry thought. More like beat the shit out of him, or at least try to. But if he
Harry was already halfway convinced he should taste it when a sudden clap of thunder and the low rumbling that followed it, distracted him. Harry got up and went to the window. Dark clouds loomed over Paddington, and just as Harry was about to turn away, a massive rainfall hit the ground. The sound it produced was so deafening that Harry went to look for Neville, unexplainably excited as was often the case with humans when it came to unexpected weather changes.
Harry raised his brows.
"What do you mean?"
It had been a few years since they had last met, and the years had been kind to Neville Longbottom. He looked the same as he had at Darthorn, except now it was clear to see from his arms and from his posture that he had been hard at work for many years.
"I'm afraid not," Draco said. "Harry and I were supposed to go over to the Weasleys for dinner when all of this happened. It's a shame, really. I was looking forward to it. Not the Weasleys in particular, but just... Going somewhere with him. With Harry."
Remus nodded.
"Hey Harry, have you seen..."
"And if you take it off?"
Draco stayed silent. He knew what Potter meant and just the thought made Draco crawl in his skin. Disgusting. But Pansy wouldn't have done anything like that, he knew it.
“What’s the matter," Theodore sneered. “Don’t tell me you’re blind
“Probably while you and I were…” Ron fell silent, clenching his jaw like he often did when he was nervous. “I haven’t seen Hermione since then but, Dean told me. He said he saw them talking when he was on his way back from Visual Charms.”
“Who?”
“Does that seem like something I’d do?”
"Young master remembers old Ksenia's name," the elf said, still continuing in English with a cooing tone.
“Did you tell them yet?” Draco whispered to her.
Draco turned to look at Harry, and Harry couldn't quite read his expression.
After the waves settled, they lay there for a moment, foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's air as they caught breath. They were a little sweaty in euphoria that went beyond words, just jadedly looking at each other. Harry smiled, and Draco gave a chuckle. Draco wasn't wrong in laughing: it really was kind of ridiculous, unbelievable that they, out of all people, had just had sex.
“How dare you crash into me, you peasants! I’m going to toss you so far into the Forbidden Forest that Voldemort will grow a nose before they find you lot!”
“Which is so unnecessary," Hermione exclaimed. “They’re putting so much pressure on him for literally no reason! He already defeated Voldemort with us, what more do they want?”
“Oh damn, he really do be looking kinda gay," he then said to Seamus who was leaning on to the doorframe, clearly pleased with himself.
“I mind," Ron said, got up and went to fill up the kettle. “I went to listen to one of those speeches they have to do for the programme. 'Mione made the others look like complete oafs. I’m telling you, at this rate she’s going to be Minister for Magic by the time I pass all my classes.”
“Ah, no,” she said. “That would be Mr. Slughorn. I’m his apprentice until he retires. However, right now he’s in bed with a cold, so right now it can be said I’m the Potions Master. What is your name?”
Now that it was clean, Draco could bear to look at the Wadjet even less. He lifted the chain over his head and tucked the amulet under his clothes.
Narcissa struggles to understand what has happened to her son who, what seems like until only yesterday, was glued to her side, babbling endlessly about Quidditch and books he had read and what that insufferable Potter boy had done at school. Draco has always been such a clever boy, but after the war he has gotten all kinds of twisted ideas into his head. It was as if Lucius, in Draco's eyes, is as cruel as the Dark Lord himself was. Narcissa doesn't know why it's so hard for Draco, who rarely has trouble reading into and understanding even the most subtle of shifts in facial expressions and tones of voices, to realize that all leaders start to abuse their power at some point. It's natural, it's how the world works, and just because they do so, doesn't mean what they originally stood for was incorrect. But with everything that has happened - with all the torture and death Draco has had to both witness and experience, Narcissa fears it's already too late to stop the stain of those memories spreading and tainting all that had once been beautiful about their little family.
"Hi, Harry," he said. "Oh- don't close the door yet." Neville put down the plant and Harry watched as he spoke to the empty doorway.
Sunday morning, Harry got up and went to the kitchen for breakfast, only to find his friends, including Seamus and Hermione who didn't even live in the dorm, huddled around the table, whispering to each other.
“There’s something you should know," the man said and stretched his neck as if trying to see if there was anyone else around. “Are you alone?”
But it wasn’t immediately apparent; it wasn’t Voldemort, robed in all his maliciousness – it wasn’t a dementor like in Potter’s third year.  It looked like-
MINERVA: They were unfilled, and moreover, a bit messy.  It looks like you ran out of time.
Despite Hannah’s unsolicited relationship advice, Draco spent the greater part of his weekend feeling sorry for himself, and only a small portion of time practicing Quidditch moves to show to his classes.  He’d be fine though – Quidditch was the least of his worries.  One of the jobs he’d had after Hogwarts had seen to that.

“Very well.  Please proceed with your testimony.”

He picked up the Judith Butler tome, filled with his notes breaking down the complicated prose (notes he fully intended to leave in the book when he returned it.)  “Because what’s the worst that could happen?” he continued.  “We’ll both end up more knowledgeable on this topic, and then – even if it’s not you – chances are we’ll both meet someone, someday, who these truths apply to.  And when that happens, I want to be able to support them in any way I can.  Don’t you?”
“Really,
Perhaps he owed Harry too much to defy him on this one, reasonable thing.  “I’ll go tonight,” he said at last, though his heart palpitated with nerves at the mere thought.
Harry stared at the pudding, beginning to perspire, his body imitating the cool exterior of the pudding container. He broke eye contact with the delectable treat, “Well, anyway… what were we talking about? Oh, right,” He straightened his glasses on the bridge of his nose, “While some Muggles do enjoy having food sex, it’s extremely uncommon. It’s like about as uncommon as
“I always knew I’d have you down on your knees for me someday, Potter,” he continued, as if he had never stopped.  He tugged sharply on Harry’s fringe again to feel the vibrations of his groan.  “Used to imagine it during Potions class.”
He didn’t mean it – not really.  So when Harry wrapped his arms around his neck and pulled him down for a kiss, Draco let himself melt into it.  He gave as good as he got, and within seconds, he felt the unmistakable rush of arousal lancing through him.

In the end, all he felt was cold.

A smirk stole across Draco’s face as he digested this tidbit.  “You

Everything paused as Flitwick’s voice cut through the layers of pain separating them from the world.

“Huh?” he uttered, his mind catching on the nightmares as he looked at the bed himself.  In one, Harry had even kissed him back before revealing that things would never work.  “No.”
He drew a breath in and held it, waiting for her to continue.  The next time she glanced up, he saw the moment her hesitation broke down into relief at confessing.

“Uhh, not sure?” he replied honestly.  He hadn’t really noticed a reaction one way or the other.
“I’m-” Draco nearly choked.  “Wait,
The game was fun, of course, but tedious – as there wasn’t much for him to do in terms of refereeing.  Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors were too sanctimonious to cheat, usually.  But there was excitement in the stands, and when Gryffindor’s seeker caught the snitch and ended the game, the whole house exploded into cheering that no doubt carried back to the castle.
The snake slapped down upon the ground and hissed as it darted closer.  It was like coming full circle.  Draco grinned triumphantly at his spellwork.
And yet, it still served as the most wonderful distraction.
From the panic tinging his voice as he said it, Draco could tell he had been talking to himself.  “
“Just a drop, alright?  I’m curious.”  And he was
Draco spun him around gently, noting the unbridled lust gleaming in his eyes.  It was a powerful force, this lust, like something that would draw in anything around it to devour.
Harry entered first, dodging the boy levitating with the force of Fizzing Whizzbees, and paused a moment before turning around.  His eyes catalogued the bluebell bubbles ricocheting around the room before settling back on Draco with unrestrained wonder.  His smile was radiant, and Draco wondered a bit whether it would smite him on the spot.
“I…I was wondering, well, how you

“She let us duke it out before dinner, through which she laid down her expectations of mutual compromise.”
“I’m not playing this game, Harry,” he interrupted.  “I told you that.”
It wasn’t simple.
”  It had been so long-
“I know,” Draco said, “I just like doing it, because it makes me feel commanding. By the way, how did you like going to Flavortown?”
Harry, who’d beaten him in every fair duel they’d ever had, had snapped his wand away at the last moment.  He could have won this one, too – but he had chosen not to.
Draco felt Harry’s gaze like a physical touch, its slow path from base to tip drawing the blood like a lascivious spell.  His cock lengthened until it brushed against Harry’s nose, which startled a gasp from them both.  Draco quickly turned his to babbling, lest it dissolve into a whine instead.
The honesty of that fear struck Draco hard enough that he missed Harry’s reply.
“We’re

mad about this.  About the article.  And I said I’d come over this morning and talk with them.”
They ended up in the Room of Requirement, as there were still people milling around both the boys’ and girls’ dorm rooms in their wing, and the library – sorry Ron! – was out, too.  The Room had morphed into the perfect interrogation chamber: a long wooden table with uncomfortable chairs at either end.  The lighting was bad, coming in slatted strips through the window, and the only decoration was a life-sized painting of him – the same that hung in the lobby of the Ministry – so Harry knew for a fact that Hermione was pissed.  The thing was proportionally-off and hideous (which she knew), and it was obvious that she was including it to make a point.
“Potter?  What about Potter?  He open another chamber for a huge snakey-wakey?”
“Wait!  Potter-” Draco caught the door from closing, but only at the sacrifice of his foot.  He bit back a wince as the man gave the knob another hard yank.  “Hold on, just listen!”
[Cut to present, in which the finalists are putting their gingerbread doughs in to chill.  VOLDEMORT and MINERVA approach CEDRIC alongside GEORGE to hear about the showstopper.]
“Alright,” he said, “I’ll bite.  What does Our Wizarding Savior have in mind?  Where does the grand Harry Potter take his dates?”
“Better than…usual.”  Harry laughed awkwardly, hoping came off as self-deprecating rather than self-conscious.  If it was self-deprecating, then it meant he could handle a harsh reply.  If it was self-deprecating, then Malfoy wouldn’t see he was stupidly invested in his opinion.
I did it?”  He leaned closer, forcing his eyes to stay locked on Potter’s, lest they drop traitorously to his lips.  He meant to say something clever, something scathing, like he was usually so capable of.
“But waiting is torture,” Harry mumbled petulantly.

Ron grinned like he had a particularly good move planned out in a game of chess.  “Yes.  Now, listen.  Here’s what we’re going to do-”
They’d made good headway today, Draco decided, as he strolled back into Harry’s office.  Good enough that he felt the end was in sight – perhaps the next experiment, even, could be the one to succeed-
He chuckled quietly.  “Alright Harry.  Now tell me why you were acting so cagey at dinner.”
“Well, that’s something, at least.  I feel like we haven’t talked much lately.”
“Good.”
But his trepidation was lost to the chaos.  “What?  How many people?  How many… Wait.”
MINERVA: Alright, thank you.

“Mister Malfoy is joining us again?” one of the students asked as Harry bustled around the room, prepping.  Draco didn’t think there were any particular preparations needed for
“I like to watch the reactions,” Draco assured him.  “Yours will be especially good, I’m sure.”  He thought of his earlier fantasy of Potter clutching him out of fear, unshed tears glistening in his expressive eyes.

“No one will see,” Harry promised, which they both knew was a lie.
Harry glanced huffily down at the monstrous hand-knitted jumper he had on, muttering, “Molly made it for me.  Why?  What’s wrong with it?”
Harry came back to himself, realizing he’d been hesitating.  That was no good; he didn’t want to seem weak to Malfoy, or anyone else.  Malfoy was clearly toying with him—throwing that phrase around and expecting Harry to look like an idiot when he didn’t know it.  Hah.  Well, he’d show
Draco shifted in his seat – partially to redistribute Harry’s weight and partially to ease him off the crux of his boner.  He was sure he looked just as ruffled as he felt.  “I see what you’re doing,” was all he managed to mumble.
“Halloween is about
“Right-”
“You’re just mad he didn’t want your advice today,” Draco responded in a complete non sequitur.
“Harry?  What is it?”  He tried to stay as neutral as he possibly could, but it was hard, knowing what was coming.  It was only as Harry’s eyes roved up and down that he realized what a mess he must be.
Draco knew he should step away, that he was saying too much with both his words and his eyes – and if anyone was watching this, he’d get fired in a heartbeat.  But he simply couldn’t drag himself away.  That

His previous confidence in Potter’s interest was flagging, and he found himself reexamining every second of every interaction they’d had since he’d started this bloody job, and came out no wiser than before.  Sure, there were signs of attraction – the blushing, the looks, the breathlessness.  But what if it wasn’t

The worst that could happen was being left brutally heartbroken for all time eternal.
“Hermione had hit me with a stinging hex right before, so my face was all swollen.  But it was still clearly me.  Malfoy - err, Draco, that is, not Lucius - definitely would have known.”
But Harry wouldn’t let him descend into self-loathing.  He pulled him tight, black curls whispering across Draco’s cheeks.
[Everyone claps, some more begrudgingly than others.  As VOLDEMORT and MINERVA go over to congratulate CEDRIC, we see HARRY glancing sheepishly at DRACO.  DRACO ignores him, and when it seems he’s about to break the silence and get his attention, DRACO stands up and leaves.]
McGonagall sighed, shifting her hawkish gaze to the window while answering.  “Draco, I hired you this fall knowing precious little about your situation or your intentions.  I hired you because you were qualified – but also because I believe everyone should be given a second chance.  I don’t imagine you had an easy time these past few years, and I don’t pretend you’re the same little boy who threw hexes at his classmates under the table during class.  But I took quite a leap of faith in bringing you back to Hogwarts, and you need to give me a measure of trust in return.”
?!” Malfoy spluttered, backpedaling a step and unbalancing when Harry held firm to their interlaced grip.  And really, that was rich, because Harry was just answering
Draco managed to extract himself from the conversation shortly thereafter with a hastened eating regiment and swearing off of dessert.  The food was lovely – as usual – but he still left the Great Hall with a bad taste in his mouth.
After another minute, Potter burst through the canopy of leaves with a smattering of scratches and stray sticks in his hair.
And if it did, how could he possibly return to it?  How could he, in good conscience, slip into a role that had led them

And by that, I mean to say: I sincerely apologize for my sins 🙇
Draco walked up the path to the Manor, trying his best not to sick up in the hedges.  His stomach was twisting violently with nerves at the prospect of seeing Father, and not even the courage-boosting potion he’d brewed for himself this morning was enough to temper the anxiety.
Oh fuck—people were watching them again, weren’t they?

“Does that hurt?”
Harry handed him a cup, then wandlessly summoned an empty one to his hand to make his own.  It sent a shiver of appreciation through Draco, though he didn’t have the energy to do more than raise an eyebrow.

But in light of the many dehumanizing “jobs” he had taken on this past year, her kindness at offering him
“Do you want me to lick it clean?” Draco asked, looking up at Harry.

He wrapped his fingers around the base, eyes flickering between the sheer hedonism of the sight and the wrecked expression on Harry’s face as he watched Draco’s hands.  The gloves slid gracefully up and down, catching only a few times on the damp skin.
“Nothing,” Draco said quickly, lest Harry decide against such casual intimacy.  “Just…this is nice.”  His words failed to summarize his veritable maelstrom of emotions, but that was the closest he could come to describing it.
MINERVA: Yes, I agree.  Though, the appearance is quite attractive, so good job on that front.
Draco laughed, his body shaking like he’d just played a five-hour Quidditch match.  “No, you idiot.  It was

and broke free of his grip to take him down once more.  And that was it.  Draco spasmed, clutching wildly at Harry’s head and neck and shoulders as his orgasm tore through him.  He could feel Harry’s throat contracting as he swallowed down his cum, and the eroticism of that thought had his muscles seizing in yet another wave of release.

“Erm, that’s right, Sue.  He’d like to learn
Harry scowled, looking down at entirely the wrong place.  “Where?  Get it.”
Potter’s face shifted subtly, but he was clearly still bothered by something, as he continued undeterred, “I, err, felt a little better, so I went and laid down for a bit in my room instead.  But thanks for checking on me, I guess.”
“I get it,” Sam cut in, “you’re a bloke, you have a boyfriend, and you’re happy.  It’s possible.”

Musing that he’d gotten a lot of use out of the doubling charm of late, Draco couldn’t help but remember his mother’s amusement when he’d shown talent for it as a child.
GEORGE: Bakers, you have 45 minutes remaining!  45 minutes.

Draco had seen his mother charm many politicians and Ministry executives in his time, and her aim here was just as clear.  He ground his teeth as Harry, ignorant to her machinations, could only nod dumbly in response.
Draco swallowed clumsily and then forced himself to continue.  “We’ve had to redefine the concept of ‘purity’ a bit, obviously.”
Bagman leaned in again, his eyes narrowing slightly as he finally got to his point.  “For the little games I’m running.  Just a bit of Quidditch – a bit of innocent fun.  Though, it can be lucrative if you play your cards
“What do you know about suffering," Malfoy spit out and faced Harry from the other side of the counter. “You’re the boy who made all the right choices and saved the world.”
Draco closed the door as Harry looked up at the pictures on the walls. There was an old man drinking coffee, a dead pigeon, some swans…
Draco drew in a breath, and as he let it out, it came out a sigh.
It was just their mouths meeting at first, but then Harry could almost hear the surface breaking, followed by the masses of water muffling all sounds as the kiss turned hot and slick as Draco dove, gently pushing Harry onto his back on the bed. The Daily Prophet crumpled under Draco's knee and slid onto the floor. Harry only heard sounds of breathing and linen shifting underneath them. It all became blurry and melted away as Harry's heart started beating faster and, as inevitable as the Daily Prophet, the want started sizzling in his limbs. Everywhere Draco touched him started trembling for more, and with most of Draco's weight resting on top of Harry, there was little he could do except kiss back in fervent desperation and hold on to him, feeling the curve of his back, its form sinking and rising as muscled moved under the skin.
Draco was sitting on Harry’s bed and looking at the Quidditch posters on the walls.
“You’re up to something. Not really fair to be up to something without including me.”
Narcissa's knuckles whiten inside her suede gloves as she squeezes her purse so she wouldn't blurt out something silly. How she has missed him!
“I don’t suppose he overheard what they were talking about.”
Harry climbed onto the bed and laid down next to Draco, leaning his head on Draco’s chest. They shifted, looking for a comfortable position until their limbs were snuggly intertwined.
Draco stood there, staring at Harry’s door. The portrait gave a long creak as Weasley left the dorm. Draco lifted his hand, but hesitated and lowered it again. What Weasley had described to him earlier about the way Harry had acted sounded like a panic attack, and having been through several of them himself, Draco was painfully aware of how almost everything seemed to make it worse. Especially attempts to help. He feared he was just going to upset Harry more by trying to help, but leaving him alone… That was even worse of an option.
Draco walked over, quickly glancing at Russia from the window before unrolling the parchment. The documents were already written out for him in both Russian and English.
"I wasn't going to say anything, because frankly I didn't think there was any truth in it, but Dora has quite the theory about you two," Remus said, his smile absent as it was directed to someone who wasn't present. "According to her it makes all the sense in the world that you two would end up together. How did… what did she say again…" Remus looked up, exploring his memory. "They're basically the same, only completely different."
“Yeah!” Harry wasn’t sure if adding historical details would make the article more or less interesting to the public, but he was nevertheless excited for Hermione. Harry then remembered the postcard.
Draco’s breath wavered on the edge of a moan as his gaze met the ceiling, and he thought about how this man was going to drive him mad, irreversibly and utterly mad, and said:
“Hey, Spider-Man counts as reading too," Harry noted.
"Yeah."
"You finished it already?" Draco asked as he took the book from Harry.
The students, being used to Toadsworth’s grim jokes, shared smug looks.
Never missing a chance to assert his equal dominance, Draco stroked Harry's cock, his fingers gliding over the tip, teasing as they pressed it against his entrance.
“No," Harry said a little too quickly for it to sound inconspicuous.
Harry didn't know how long Neville had been stading there, but nevertheless was glad to see him. The previous evening's conversation had made him a little worried for him.
“Careful, father," Draco said, interrupting Lucius and standing up to face him. He was as tall as his father, if not a little taller. “You’re causing a scene.”
“What did your parents do?”
“You have to let me take you to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes," Harry said, leaning forward excitedly. “It’s amazing, you’d love it.”
"See, you're giving me no choice- you're pushing me away-"
“No," Draco said, giving a little chuckle and turning to look at Harry. “There’s usually much more pressing things to worry about.”
“Shut up, will you? You don’t know him. Besides, why do you even care? You’re not in his department.”
“Oh, now this is something,” he said, greedily taking in his newfound upper hand. “The blockhead didn’t have the balls to tell you, did he?”
Harry let out a small laugh.
“But, I killed - I killed everyone there was left, even you, even Teddy…”
and hugged him so tight it seemed a matter of pure luck they both didn’t fall over right there on the porch.
"Yeah. So... I guess I'll try to make some new friends this year," Neville said and shrugged. Harry watched as he went into his room, walking as if he was scared to make a lot of noise.
"It was so cool - I couldn't stop reading it once I got to the part where the murder happened, so I pretty much finished the whole thing in one go."
Harry shrugged mentally and did as he was told. The place was dingy and tea was only fifty pence, so Harry got a cup of that and a coffee for Draco.
“Which one?”
So in addition to being a pureblood supremacist, Theodore was also a homophobe. Harry tilted his head and wondered if arguing him would really be worth it. He hadn’t known he was bisexual for very long, and he certainly wasn’t prepared have these kinds of conversations.
After the lecture Ron and Harry ran into Hermione, who had just come back from another of the numerous visits to the Ministry of Magic that were part of her programme.
Harry was waiting for Draco in the staircase. A painting of a forest was guarding the door to his dorm, which Harry knew housed many previous members of the Slytherin house. The picture reminded Harry of the Forbidden Forest, although the one in the painting was much more beautiful with golden beams of light that were filtered as they fell through the trees, creating patterns in the tall grass. Harry wondered what creature would have come to greet him from the forest, had he tried to guess the password.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the fact that he was in the middle of a conversation that had caused Dean to admirably casually say “bum stuff”.
“Because you obviously didn’t sleep last night," Draco said and started gathering his things. “You’ll get us both expelled if you’re not able to concentrate. You were checked out all morning.”
"Were you surprised when I…"
"What happened to him?" Draco asked.
“Oh," Harry said. “But you’ve been to Diagon Alley since, right?”
“Are you sure Skepperus didn’t have it when he left?” Harry asked.
Draco gave a vague smile that quickly faded. No one had ever told him they were proud of him before, and he wasn't quite sure what the appropriate reaction was. He decided to look at the article instead. He didn’t really have the ability at that moment to concentrate on it. Words were running around on the page, twitching and swirling into directions that weren’t supposed to be there.
"Oh?"
He noticed his handwriting subtly change every time he switched the page on which he was writing on. He usually wrote in rounded, small letters using soft pressure, leaving generous space in between the words in case he needed to tweak something later. Whenever he started writing in Potter’s notebook and saw his pointed, squeezed-together letters that overlapped each other, sometimes so much so that the words became impossible to decipher, he started to suddenly make mistakes he usually wouldn't have, and his writing started to unexplainably and stubbornly slant to the left.
"Ah, Draco," the professor said and nodded as Malfoy walked past him. "Ehm, yes, as I was saying..."
"Why do you look like you're imagining me in some French maid outfit?" Draco asked, cocking his brow.
“Not if it’s to tease you.”
“Are you reading something?” Her tone was delighted.
"You didn't hear? She dropped out."
“I don’t know what you expect. This is what you keep choosing for us - and you know, I’ll help you through all the breakdowns that you need to have, but you’d think that at some point,” Draco pinched his eyes together, knowing he was letting his frustration out more than had been his intention, “you’d think that maybe at some point you’d stop trying not to disappoint everyone at work and be more worried about disappointing me.”
reflecting from his eyes giving them a fierce glow. “I’m not taking an apology from you. You had every right to use that spell. I deserved it.”
energy… You must be Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco had been patient with him, understanding even when it seemed like he was accepting new cases left and right - because eventually, the day would come when he’d come home from work and find Harry there with dinner and a grin, and he would tell Draco to guess what.
“Fine!  Fine, I’ll tell you – but not
“What else would they do?” Draco said, more cute than curious.
Draco looked up from the book, where he’d been waiting him out.  “Oh, I’m glad you asked.  She said something about your desire to watch me teach – to ‘sit in on some of my classes.’”  He snapped the book shut and watched Potter jump.  He smiled.  “The word ‘obsessive’ may or may not have been mentioned.”
Draco hadn’t finished the first time they had sex.  The second time, he had; the third time, he hadn’t; and by the fourth or fifth time, he’d learned enough about losing himself in the sensation to come at the appropriate moment.
And really, it was astounding that someone could be so utterly blind to the main point.  “I’m not talking about the press, I’m talking about
Draco yawned unfazed by Harry’s frenzied expression. “All Sam said was that we must be having lots of messy Muggle food sex, seeing as you’re half muggle and all, and then I told you he was being presumptuous, because obviously we’re not doing that.”

I thought we were moving past that?”  Draco hadn’t quite intended it in coming here, but he allowed a bit of pleading to slip into his tone.
They broke down into excited whispers and new ideas, and in the commotion, Draco sidled over to Marla and Kat to ask them something.
Draco was starting to think that the world was conspiring against him in new and terrible ways.  He’d been on his way to bedding Harry after the game, when, naturally, the entire fucking Slytherin Quidditch team had appeared, frenzied with the taste of victory, and begged Draco to celebrate with them.
“Yes,” he said simply, because explaining anything else would undo him.
Beyond the horizon of Harry’s back, Draco could see the man’s release spattering upon the parchment and quills and the sheer hedonism of the sight sent him following his own climax.  He sank his teeth into Harry’s back to muffle a shout.
“That’s a-one a-hot salami!” Draco said mockingly in a horrible Italian accent.
That earned him a smile.  “I think ‘consort,’ ‘fraternize,’ and ‘sodomy’ all came up during our discussion.  Lots of adjectives.  Heirloom guilt.  No terms for dating past the 1800s.”
Draco’s chest ached, and he wasn’t even surprised when Harry quietly murmured, “There is.  Proof, I mean.”  The man was a bleeding heart – if even

There was something so sinister in seeing Nagini in that bubble next to the Dark Lord.  The way she floated and thrashed, no longer bound by gravity’s weighted expectations.
Draco pulled out his wand, whispering the protection and lubrication charms, before sliding a finger inside him.  Harry took it easily – like maybe he’d already tried it while Draco was out.
The feast began, and he kept his gaze fixed forward, refusing to look at Potter beside him.  By the sounds he was making though, he was gobbling food like an animal.  His knife scraped noisily along his plate, and he seemed to choke on his drink for a second before gulping it down.
“Flip,” Draco ordered.
Potter was at his side in less than five seconds.  “Malfoy!  Malfoy – can you hear me?”  His voice was fraught with panic, and Draco didn’t even have time to be shaken by that before Potter was pleading, using his name.  “
went on in the girls’ dorm.  Other boys went crazy speculating, but he had always been rather blasé until now.
VOLDEMORT: Do you have any plan to keep your honey from spilling out into the pan and making your dough too wet on the bottom?
Reversing his weight backwards, he watched Malfoy stumble in surprise and took that opportunity to draw him closer for a spin.
Draco felt like he’d been gutted.  Like a fish sliced cleanly from throat to tail with the hidden messiness of its organs spilling outwards.  He felt Harry engulfing him in a hug, and in his confusion, he felt a jolt of relief that at least the pressure would help staunch his wound.
“We’re not
Harry took a deep breath.  “Right.  Well, despite having our obvious differences, there was one particular time in which Malfoy saved my life-”
Other teachers filed in, none taking the seat to his right.  Trelawney trailed by with her big, moony eyes, followed by Slughorn, who pretended not to see him.  The bastard had never recognized his talent in Potions, and Draco found himself wishing half-heartedly for the man’s early retirement.  Then he could take the position he really wanted - though he knew he didn’t deserve it.

But the man merely stammered, “I wasn’t…I mean, I’m not.  Anymore.  Or not in the same way-”  He stood, frozen in the doorway with embarrassment, and Draco saw his opportunity.
But Potter, looking far too pleased with himself, raised the snitch for the students to see, completely unaware of this injustice.  Then, his eyes caught on Draco’s.
“Good,” she responded gratefully – perhaps surprised at his civility.  “I’m cleaning the grounds for winter, though it will take some time before I can set up the lights.”
And it was in this vulnerable moment that Draco blindsided him with the original question.  “What was the

“Shh, shh, it’s alright,” came a voice from his left.
He stumbled to the bench and sat, pleased that he’d made it that far without falling.  His calves were going to be sore, for sure – though not nearly as sore as Harry’s arse.  Their huffing breaths were the only sound breaking the silence, and Draco allowed himself this quiet moment to reflect that, this time around, Hogwarts was giving him a lot of second chances.  It was like he was purging the bad memories in each corner of the grounds and filling them with better ones – an errant thought that quickly solidified into a mission.
Or just invite more danger upon his head?

But whatever plan he started hatching was promptly tossed aside the next day after his interaction with Flitwick.  By chance, they’d ended up sitting next to each other at dinner (mostly because Draco couldn’t stomach another night rubbing elbows with Trelawney and inhaling her cloud of incense), and they’d been partway through their meals when the man brought up the topic of dueling club.

He also serves on the board of trustees for Hogwarts Culinary Institute, leading him to recommend that Draco go there to further his studies before joining the family business in a more formal capacity.

Draco had then fallen artlessly to his knees, the submissiveness of the gesture lost in the sure way he pinned Harry to the wall, the flash of nails as he ran his hands down Harry’s thighs.  His tongue was mischievous and eager as he worked Harry into a shudder.
He found himself pressing his wand to Potter’s sternum, his hand somehow steady amidst this rush of adrenaline.
He huffed out his wasted precaution and turned to survey the other Slytherins for potentially hazardous costumes – a task he hadn’t prepared himself to conduct tonight.

When the last student had left the locker room, Draco slipped in and looked around, casting a
Instead, he smirked.  “But I think, in this case, the original does it better, don’t you think?”  He swiped at his own lip with a pointed glance at Potter’s, and the man thankfully got the hint and wiped his mouth with a rough stroke of his hand.
Draco tried to think up the least damaging excuse for his indulgent wish-fulfillment gone wild.  “Well,” he started, “I knew you were extraordinarily dense.”  Harry began to protest, so he raised a hand to shush him.  “And you’ve only proved that even more over this past month – don’t you dare deny it.  So, I thought I’d help plant the idea.”
As he met Draco’s gaze, Potter’s smile fell away and faded to a blush.
.  I wouldn’t dare test it on someone else – do you know how many people already think I’m trying to poison them, given my past?”
Draco rolled over in bed, eyes catching upon the Slytherin banner hanging on his wall.  The fabric of the snake squirmed in the slight breeze from the window, and he felt his blood run cold at the movement.
“How long have you…have you wanted to ‘fuck’ me?” he asked, so earnest that Draco that wanted to scream.
.  [He says this with a straight face, like his first job is as a sugar-whisperer.]
Today’s game was Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw – the one he would always skip as a student, because it had none of the passionate rivalry of the Slytherin or Gryffindor matches.  But as the flight instructor, he had to put aside old immaturity and do his job, which was exactly what he did.  Though, it didn’t stop him from occasionally letting his gaze drift away from the polite Hufflepuff beaters to his boyfriend in the stands.

“Harry,” Draco whimpered, now totally sick with lust.  “Harry…Harry,
.  With Father in jail for another five months, and him and Mother banned from using magic for almost another year, they were each trapped in their own uncompromising hell.  But rather than bring them closer, it had only fractured them apart.
“Let’s get you out of those soiled clothes,” the man whispered, sending a shiver up Harry’s neck.  Up close, he could see the water droplets clinging to those long, blond lashes.  He hovered closer, so Draco’s next words were against his lips.
.  “I mean, I assume
.  He hid the rapid thumping of his heart with a coolly raised eyebrow.
In sum, Draco was no longer the same boy who had grown up in this place.  It felt as distant as it did familiar, abstracted from him in the never-ending river of tainted memories.  And his mother’s motivations, focused as they were on mending the past, remained irrevocably alien to him.
His mind flicked through various devious and involved schemes until it landed on the right one.
.  Why hadn’t they just continued right there, against the lockers where Harry had confessed he’d wanted Draco to keep his Quidditch gloves on next time?  Even thinking about it was enough to make him all hot under the collar again.
CEDRIC: Thank you!  [He is unaffected by VOLDEMORT’S cynicism.]
He answered his own question without words, as he dragged his nails down Harry’s thighs – punishing him for the offer he’d been forced to refuse outside.  He ran his hands across Harry’s hips, liking the

“Well, sorry I’m so ‘clueless’-”
Draco refocused his gaze on Harry’s face.  The man was staring, enraptured, at the cocks in Draco’s fist, and he watched Harry stifle a gasp as he added a little twist to his wrist at the end of each stroke.
“Oh, yes,” she replied, with a hint of a grumble attached.
But one bat just wasn’t exciting enough, was it?

“Did you think of me during sex?”
He dismounted his broom as the others were filing to the lockers, muddy and wind-worn.  Marla stood slightly off to the side, and Draco couldn’t help remembering Sam’s visit to Harry the previous night.  Perhaps Marla needed someone to confide in as well – though he didn’t want to overstep.
“Fine.”  Grant’s voice was as flat as his eyes.  “I see.  But keep in mind that I was

VOICE-OVER: Harry began working with the Weasleys after becoming friends with Ron back in secondary school.  Initially, he started working part-time at their family bakery in between his studies, but he eventually moved in with them as well in order to avoid a bad situation at home.  The Weasleys gladly took Harry in, and he’s been dedicating himself to learning his new family’s trade ever since.  He is currently a junior at Hogwarts Culinary, and he excels in bread and ‘unique’ fondant sculptures.
MINERVA: Truly breathtaking from a distance, though up close I can see it’s missing several windows.

Grant.
The sentiment had startled Draco into showering for nearly an hour after he’d gone, unable to scrub away the shame prickling at his flesh.
Draco froze.  It wasn’t the skeletal hand of the Dark Lord that he had expected.
Which is how he found himself at The White Wyvern that Friday night, having had only enough motivation to sneak out of the Miscellany to be wretched somewhere else.  It was one of the only times he’d left the store – other than a few midnight walks spread through the months, when he thought he’d actually go insane if he didn’t.  And it was his first time entering a pub since the war.

LUCIUS: [caught in the lobby of what appears to be a very expensive hotel] Hmm, Draco?  Yes, he’s a fine chef.  More suited to meats and preparatory work than the baking he entertains himself with.  I plan to start him out in cold meats when he graduates, and if he proves himself with that, then maybe we can sit down and reassess. [He adjusts his wrinkleless satin gloves and gives the camera a terse nod before turning to go.]
[MINERVA looks touched, but VOLDEMORT seems to be holding back an eye roll at the blatant sentimentality.  DRACO is
And then he had, of course, gone through his daily ritual of Occluding and trying to forget about Potter’s face entirely.
“Are you really
.  Since that time, he has only appeared on TV in his signature black suit.]
But an hour passed, and things were starting to drag – the students must have been trickling down to the Ball, having seen the other Houses’ “decorations.”  Draco had been taking groups down to the dungeons almost constantly, but now he found himself sprawled in a chair by the common room, praying someone would come by.
“Fine,” he spat, teeth grinding.  “Usual stakes?”  He stood from his stool with faked confidence, moving to turn around until a wand pressed quietly against his head.
He slipped off his outer robes and hung them by hand in the closet, liking the way the routine made his restless body feel useful.  Then, he slumped down on the couch, kicking his legs up on the coffee table, and finally let himself relax.  “The visit was…tense.”
“And why is that?” he demanded.
Draco allowed himself a smirk.  “To fuel your obsession with me,” he drawled.  “Tell me – is it working?”
“Well then,” she said, nodding approvingly, “we’d better discuss this further in my office.”
or interpreting it wrong or…  What if I’ve wasted your time?”
“Can we please please please do the relay race thing again?” one little boy asked, and Draco felt himself melting at the excitement in his tone.
But what to do with it?  He could simply transfigure a bunch of copies of it for Potter’s office.  That would be fun.  But it lacked originality - he was better than that.  What else could he do?
Proving his point, they crowded closer to Harry and asked again directly.  “Hey Professor!  Are you on a date?”  In the background, he heard one of them protesting, “Merlin, Anna - you can’t just ask
She said it innocently, like it wasn’t her primary purpose – which made it infinitely suspicious.
He had promised himself that he wouldn’t touch Potter.  He had
Harry slumped onto the sofa, and Draco took a minute to appreciate that their positions had neatly been swapped since last week.
“Little Mary never had a chance!” Marla cooed with a smile, and, at that moment, Draco knew they had definitely been Sorted correctly.
The footsteps stopped directly behind him, and the menacing little huff of laughter that sounded after sent the hairs on the back of his neck prickling.
He didn’t quite believe that he was; but he decided to indulge himself by playing along.  He needed more information, and playing Potter’s game was the best way to gather it.
Harry felt it flutter beneath its armor of pins.  “Uh, yeah, various things?”  He dragged his gaze away from Malfoy’s face long enough to take a look himself.  “There’s, uh-” reading

[Overlaid above the drama now melting into slow motion, we hear FRED’s regretful tone announcing: ‘And the one leaving us this week is…(an interminable pause)…Seamus.  I’m sorry buddy.’  The Irishman sobs into Fred’s shoulder before exchanging a swift, awkward hug with both VOLDEMORT and MINERVA.  The rest of the contestants join a group hug, save ARGUS FILCH and SEVERUS SNAPE – the only two yet to smile with the typical excitement contestants feel upon entering the tent.]
“It is serious business, and I’m a serious teacher.” Harry furrowed his brows so tightly he could roll a thin strand of pasta between them.
“Still.  That’s…just leave it.”  She glanced worriedly in Harry’s direction, which he pretended he didn’t see.  He was fully aware that he’d been acting out of sorts since that day at training, and he didn’t want to parse out to her—or himself—exactly why that was.
chest.  Fascinated, Draco ran his fingers across it.
“After the war, I returned to the Manor.  Without magic, and surrounded by bad memories of the house, that quickly became unbearable.  So, I decided to get a job.  I’m sure you can imagine how well that went.”  He took a deep breath here before diving into the confession.
But Potter was paling under his very gaze, and he realized it had been the wrong thing to say.  After a too-long pause, the man snapped back with, “No!
“No,” he repeated, mind successfully blank.
For a while, she said nothing.  Instead, she let her hand droop, broom falling to rest on the ground.
“Oh, spare me,” Harry grumbled, but if his smile of relief was anything to go by, he would let Draco say whatever he wanted.  It would be a pain, wasting his talents on a Weasley, but Draco supposed that, if it helped Harry, he would do most anything.

With a start, Draco realized that the muffled chiming had been the clock.  Right – his appointment.  However, the idea of Harry leaving now was too terrible to even mention.
Draco pursed his lips in a scowl as Harry went from humiliating him to manipulating him in a single breath.  He was sure it was
With a start, he realized all over again that his father was dying, which was the reason he was here.  It was so easy to forget, when the man said things that made Draco want to punch him in the face.  He was like a cornered snake, his father – rattling his tail and hissing as his night drew to a merciless close.

He paused before the door.  It looked the same as it had the other day when he’d stopped in to torment the man about his interest in flying class.  The only difference was that the bulletin board out front was now noticeably absent of office hours.
“I’m self-preserving,” he said instead, letting the banter take over naturally.  “It keeps me from looking as wretched as you do right now.”
But Potter still wasn’t meeting his eyes.  The man’s gaze was firmly downcast, shoulders by his ears – and leaning into his space like this, Draco realized not for the first time that he had gained a height advantage over Potter somewhere in the past few years.  It filled him with a drunken sense of accomplishment that he certainly hadn’t earned, along with the urge to press closer and cover Potter’s entire body with his own – just to see how it would fit.  Just because he could…
"Shall I put it on?"
“You’re so predictable, Potter.”  His answers were on autopilot, which, when he was so worked up like this, was probably a bad idea.  Far too revealing.  “Still thinking everything is black and white, and no one outside of Gryffindor is worth your while.”
He turned back to his food with a scowl.  There had to be some way to get Potter’s attention – over the years, he’d become something of a master at it.  Even if he was laying low, that didn’t mean he couldn’t entertain himself a bit at the same time.
– and, suddenly, you knew
“If you tell me to drop it, I swear I will.  I know that there’s a lot of…history between us.”
“Like what?” Harry asked.  And the way he said it – so casually curious – made Draco want to
Draco shrugged, letting him figure it out on his own.  Giving away nothing that could ruin any surprise.  He watched with glee as Potter’s uneventful first step turned him confident, and he stepped boldly into the passage with the ghouls.
Thankfully, Draco was distracted by the delighted whispers of the second-years.  While none of them were in his flying class for obvious reasons, he recognized one or two of them as students who had come to him for Quidditch advice before the try-outs.  Apparently – judging by the curious glances and hesitant smiles – he wasn’t as disliked as he’d previously thought.
“You’re funny.  I like that – I don’t remember you being funny in school.”

” he asked incredulously – to Draco’s singular delight – before continuing without pause.  “Never mind.  At least I know better than to put on a three-piece suit to go play Quidditch in.”
“Draco, my boy!  Glad you could make it!”  He clapped him hard on the shoulder, and Draco had to make an earnest effort to keep from sprawling forward.  It was a gesture he was unused to – and from the look in Bagman’s eyes, he was well aware of that fact as he did it.
Draco huffed a soft laugh.  “Well, no.  Not when we had Gryffindor to compete with.  I think…we officially won the contest though?”
could look so arrogant and dignified while on his knees sucking cock.
You know – the one all the Muggleborns keep playing on their godforsaken miniature gramophones!”
Draco smiled a bit sadly as he slipped his hands in his pockets and stared at the horizon with her.  “It’s okay if you aren’t.”
Father had submitted the memory to the court, and not even his desperate pleading to save his son that night of the battle could move Draco, knowing what had happened in that room next.  Snape had died a truly terrible death.
FRED: Cedric, why don’t you bring up your signature bake?

“How are…the gardens?” he settled on at last.
Draco pulled away.  It cost him something of himself, but he did it anyway.  He blinked, trying to see the man in front of him clearly and not through the thick, obscuring lens of his feelings.  He tried to see the messy nest of black curls without wanting to run his hands through it; he tried to look into those wide, green eyes without thinking “beautiful.”
To his pleasure, Harry shivered once, violently – his skin breaking out into gooseflesh at the word.  It hadn’t been a miscalculation, then.
The next wave was grief – for his mother.  She had endured so much during the war to have this taken from her too.  And despite how atrocious Father sometimes acted, he knew there was a part of her that still loved him.

Walters had knocked him off his broom on purpose.  That much was exceedingly clear.  But there had been no foul, no
With absolutely no warning, Harry shot to a sitting position and exclaimed, “Fuck!  You haven’t come yet, have you?”  He reached despairingly for Draco’s trousers, but Draco intercepted his hands along the way.
“Like the Sorting Hat?” Draco repeated, caught off guard.  “Why the hat?”

Harry stood up defensively spreading his arms and making himself larger, like a bear protecting its young, although Harry is obviously more of an otter, “Shut your mouth! I was just getting the hang of things then. And for your information, it didn’t help that you were always distracting me, Pretty Balls.”
He turned to face her so quickly that he nearly slapped her in the face with his wand.  “

By the time Harry stumbled into the Great Hall for breakfast, Draco had managed to calm down with a cup of tea.  He’d thrown away the article from his father, and – though one of the school’s owls had delivered him his usual copy of the

had nearly concussed him with a quaffle.  Fenn and Marla were staging some sort of coup at the goalposts, while Kyle, a weedy-looking fifth-year chaser, had given up the rules and snatched the snitch.
Draco’s vision tunneled to just the broom.  He saw a hand reach shakingly for the pieces and wondered, distantly, if it was his.
He caught Harry watching and was surprised to see that the man still had enough shame left to blush.  “Fuck, you’ve done it,” he murmured, hiding his face behind a splayed hand.  “You’re killing me.  This is definitely my demise.”
The man looked thrown by that, and his lips curled downward into an indignant frown.  “I know words, Draco.”
But that was the part that worried Draco the most.

They did end up discussing Quidditch – but not until much later, and after several cups of tea.  The pitch had to be double-checked for safety, so they strolled its circumference together, making light conversation as they tested the stability of the structures and the anti-jinxing wards.
Draco dragged himself into the dingy bathroom at the back of The White Wyvern.  He’d taken a few nasty hits – from both bludgers and brooms – and he was reminded of Grant’s words when he’d started the games a month ago: “You’d best be able to drag yourself up the stairs before you pass out.”
Then, two things happened at once: the snitch was caught in the game overhead, and Draco realized he was holding the Green Flash in his distracted grip.  Before he could even appreciate the artful lines of its aerodynamic body, Bagman was clapping him on the shoulder and saying something alarming like, “You’re up.”

The Slytherin common room was nostalgic.  He’d been there, of course, since coming back to Hogwarts – many times, given the Halloween escapades – but there was something so different about sitting in the old armchairs with the express purpose of relaxing.  It brought back memories of countless nights when he’d stretched out next to his classmates with his feet up on the table and had the audacity to be

Something about seeing the Malfoy signet ring in Harry’s curious grip felt both startling and significant.  Harry rolled it between his fingers, viewing the inscriptions from every side.  He leaned in close, and for some reason the inspection felt as intimate as the man viewing his naked body.
“Hey, Malfoy.”  Already, Harry was liking this plan, because it didn’t involve some dramatic entrance on his part –

It was endearing, and Draco decided not to make it easy for him.  He made no move to hide his grin as he slipped on his shoes and straightened.  Finally, when he knew Potter was practicing bouncing with nerves, he glanced up to meet his eyes.
I just…I guessed!”
He lurched forward, pressing desperate kisses to Harry’s mouth as he rode out the most intense throes of climax.  He heard himself moaning Harry’s name, twitching the last of it from his system before he could finally get a grip.
After breakfast, Draco would descend to the pitch, where players could train until the games started in the late evening.  There, he’d practice his dives and rolls for hours at a time – to the point he once realized he might even beat

Was this a result of their Quidditch match?  But they had played matches since they were kids; as much as it pained him to say, Potter knocking him off his broom was nothing new.  Perhaps the man had finally deciphered the latent desire in Draco’s gaze – though, given his track record with these kinds of things, it didn’t seem likely.

His back arched in pain as he found yet another bruise creeping up his hip.  He’d fallen hard – possibly twenty feet?  And he’d been going fast; the Green Flash had become his signature broom.  He’d gotten used to its speed for the most part, though he was still adjusting to the momentum at which he could be knocked from it.
Either way, he was in no position to argue.  He would take whatever recrimination Potter came up with, and this was frankly more forgiving than he deserved.  He nodded.
Except for Potter, of course.  Though no one had to know he was already keyed into the wards – least of all, Potter himself.

“Are you ashamed to be seen with me?” Draco asked straight out, because he didn’t think he could bear dancing around it any longer.  Then, “I would understand if you are.”
“You don’t need my help for that,” he said, grinning.  Hell.  Now that he’d said it, he’d have to stand by it.  He rested a hand on Harry’s head, wending his fingers through the messy black curls.  Tugged on them slightly.  “Now, are you going to be a good little Gryffindor and suck my cock?”

It was a line like out of his nightmares.  And the worst part was that he couldn’t even pretend to be surprised – this was what he deserved.  Anyone in Harry’s shoes would’ve come to these conclusions long ago.
Draco could’ve laughed in relief at the nonsensical response – it meant that Potter was at least a fraction as thrown as himself.  “So…what I’m doing now?”

DRACO holds a protractor to the dough with one hand while he slices the circle into even wedges with the other.  HARRY eyeballs it as he cuts, and we hear several “oh shoot”s as the occasional piece comes out wildly uneven.  They roll the wedges with the utmost precision, and the montage concludes with CEDRIC popping his perfect trays into the oven.]

He was really fucking turned on.
Harry’s eyes widened at this barrage, and Draco forced himself to be silent.  Then, he sighed and couldn’t help making one final comment.  “I should have known…  Things would’ve been so different if you had been a Slytherin.”
– no elaboration, no note.  But the delivery had felt much like those mornings Father would throw the paper on the table in disgust – not even saying anything, just expecting Draco to pick it up and read it to understand his disappointment.

“Alright, here’s what we’re going to do.  Narcissa: I, Judge Wilhemina Graddlethorn, verify that you have successfully completed your sentence, and, as such, am releasing your wand to you now.”  She tapped the desk drawer with her wand, and when she opened it, his mother’s clattered visibly inside.

Before Harry had time to voice any of his doubts, Malfoy started speaking in a rush.  “Shit.  I had sworn to myself that I would wait and see whatever ridiculous act you had planned for me tonight, but this is too much for even me to bear, Potter.”  With that, he jerked Harry in by the shirt, and then their lips were colliding, and their teeth knocked together, but Malfoy, undeterred, buried his other hand in Harry’s hair and held him in place.

At the end of their meal, Harry had injured his pride a bit by insisting on paying for everything – which Draco wouldn’t have allowed, if the Gryffindor hadn’t resorted to emotional blackmail.
But rather than relief, he felt like he’d been lit up from head to toe; his nerves sparked to life and danced at the possibilities that were suddenly open to him.
“Okay, but Ginny – what the

“Is he…doing worse?”  From the awkward twist of Harry’s mouth, Draco could tell he was trying to be sensitive – which meant worlds, considering the history Harry had with Lucius.

“Could’ve?  Or

His cheeks had reddened under the gazes, and his eyes caught desperately on Draco, who merely stood there waiting like the rest of them.  If Harry needed a lie to hide behind, Draco would accept it, but it would have to be his own.
I kept it.  Just forgot to throw it out or something,” he blustered.  “Or…”
Harry was on his feet in seconds, and a shiver ran through Draco as he wondered just what Harry might do about it.

He needed to not be doing this on a classroom floor with thirty or so students watching.
Draco sat forward in his chair.  “Yes, come in.  Are you…quite alright?”
Draco met his gaze for a long moment before answering.  It wasn’t a part of his heritage he was eager or even prepared to share, but it wasn’t something he could lie about – not now.  Not to Harry.  “

FRED: Yeah, I’ve heard him called the ‘King of Saucy Puds’ when new people come on set sometimes.  It’s always a bit of a surprise to remember that old Voldie’s got international acclaim in the field when you’re working with him every day…
Draco lay frozen and silent for long minutes in the wake of that comment as Harry fell quite rapidly into sleep.  It was the sort of thing the man would never normally say – too straightforward in its affection, too simple to be applied to this complicated thing between them.
for months, and he had never heard anyone address him as anything other than ‘The Dark Lord.’  Hearing it now, he felt the irrational fear that it would summon him again.
“Yes.”
VOLDEMORT: It looks a bit hurried to me.  There’s icing missing on some of the trees over here, and the figures weren’t held in place long enough – see here, one is sagging.
Worthless Death Eater scum that you are?  I could’ve laughed in your face like the other shops you tried-”
But her disapproval had been dwarfed, even then, by Draco’s wonder at having spent another night with Harry.  Another blessed night – as if it was going to become a regular thing.  And his tentative, explosive hope at the prospect really should have foreshadowed the storm that was coming his way.
about it to make Draco feel he could confess.
“You two,” she replied.  “How you work.”
If this was any indication of the way his year would go, then he would simply steel himself to that.  He should quash his hopes for the new job at Hogwarts returning a semblance of dignity.  That would only hurt him more later.  No, he should be focusing on mere survival, how this job was just a job - though a damn better one than its predecessor.
But he still hadn’t seen Potter.  And by the time dueling club rolled around the next day, he was desperate enough for information, that he decided – against better judgment – that he really ought to attend and see. And, unfortunately, his insanity was only validated when the crush of whispers outside the classroom forewarned him of Potter’s presence; they rushed into the room with a singular excitement that followed the Savior wherever he deemed to go.

It was enough to melt his heart, just a little – which Harry took full advantage of by talking Draco into sitting in his lap for about thirty seconds one afternoon until the flames of mortification engulfed him full-force, and he’d departed in a huff.  By the next day, an uncharacteristically tasteful armchair had sat beckoning to him in his favorite corner of the office, and he’d accepted Harry’s sheepish offer for him to stay as long as he’d like.

He continued.  “I mean, he hasn’t been coming to the Great Hall for meals for over two weeks now, but I talked to the elves last night, and they told me he’d been refusing meals for the past two days.  I figured I should say something.”
you’re a nosey git who needs to back off!”  He caught Harry’s surprise and rolled his eyes to diffuse the accusation, at least partly.  “Sorry, but it’s true,” he mumbled.
“Err, right.  Must’ve forgotten that bit.”
Like he himself had turned.

He attempted to pull away, feeling more undeserving of Harry than ever.  But the man’s grip only tightened.
“It was fine…”  He sounded hesitant.  “I have no idea what to plan for Ron’s stag night though.”
But a year had passed, and Draco had neither seen nor heard from him.  He’d received no angry letters demanding that Draco thank him for testifying.  No letters about the life debts.  He hadn’t caught Potter lurking when he’d ventured into Diagon Alley for a job – like he half-expected to find.  Throwing glances over his shoulder in Knockturn, he was more nervous to find
“Yes.  Yes, of course.”  Harry squeezed his eyes shut as Draco began cruelly fondling his balls.  He licked languorously up Harry’s shaft and paused, laving delicate, infuriating caresses on the tip of his hardened cock.  His whole manner issued a challenge:
“So, did I steal you from your sweetheart back there?” Fenn asked, sliding into the seat next to him.
“I…I don’t know
“I really don’t deserve you,” he managed at last, when he was certain Harry wasn’t about to leave him.  Relief pooled fierce and visceral in his veins, and his body sagged like he’d been running for miles.

He shook his head to clear it.  “Alright, Potter.  If you want all that, then you’d best get me started, since – unlike you – I haven’t been idling around ramping myself up for the past hour.”
“Well, I’m
Harry pulled him towards the bed, sitting on the edge and tugging Draco down gently on top of him once Draco had kicked off the trousers and shoes tangled at his feet.  He whispered the cleaning and lubrication charms in a rush, then tossed his wand onto the floor behind him.  Why had he still been holding it?
The next day, Draco woke with a smile on his face that startled him into an upright position.  He had slept with Harry Potter.
“Oh, so there are
“Oh.”  Malfoy took a sip of his own drink – a spiked carrot juice, by the looks of it.  Harry made note of the information under the dubious assumption that it may someday come in handy.  “And what is that?”
prat!” Harry crowed – and, for once, it sounded like a compliment.
He let Ron wax poetic for a little while about all the “great tips,” before finally steering them back on track.  By the end of the tangent, he felt no wiser to the ways of seducing men than when he started; he supposed most of the advice in the book was rather general mandates like “don’t be a dick to the one you love.”  Which, while true, was not the groundbreaking revelation to Harry that it had been to teenage Ron.
“No, no,” he tried, voice sweet, “Harry and I can talk later.
How the Muggleborns had just “gotten in the way.”
Draco’s eyes lingered there, over the rough bob of his throat, and by the time his gaze hit upon Potter’s face, he was startled out of his reverie by two things: the man had slightly protruding fangs, and he wasn’t

The last part had come out quite unintentionally, but Draco was so far gone with fury that he couldn’t stop to feel embarrassed.

Harry raised an eyebrow, but was already working at his trousers.  The button popped free in an instant, and in a panicked confusion of reality and fantasy, Draco told him to do the rest with his teeth.
Harry settled back down on his side, head propped up in his hand.  “Do you want to talk about it?”  With his other hand, he took Draco’s and rubbed gentle circles into his skin.  “You know, when I first came in, I honestly thought your mom was there about the jumpers.”
[Sound overlay of GEORGE announcing: ‘And the one going home this week…………..will be Hermione!  Sorry, love.’  She bursts into tears and hugs everyone except for VOLDEMORT, ARGUS, and SEVERUS.]
“Mister Malfoy!” she exclaimed after taking a step back to avoid collision.  “I’ve been hoping to run into you, actually.”
“Don’t,” he whispered harshly, and he felt an answering swallow skip against the firm cup of his palm.
He ignored his father’s indignant huff and kept his eyes trained on his mother.  She drew in a sharp breath before answering.
He’d turned Draco down that day on the train,
Draco sighed.  “Then, Father cut me off.”  He said it simply, like constraining his tone to neutrality could constrain his emotions as well.  “He finished his year in Azkaban and immediately froze my finances when I refused to come home.  So there I was: penniless, jobless,
Something in Potter seemed to snap at that sentence, and when he looked up at Draco again, his eyes were burning with a barely-muted rage.  “What do you want, Malfoy?”  His voice was hardly audible in the wide, stone hallway.
Teeth gritted.  “No.”
Voldemort.  But a worse version than any he could’ve fathomed.
Harry’s head snapped up to Malfoy, as the man took a step closer and, impossibly, offered a hand.
“No,” his mother answered.
– the man still stumbled blindly through his day-to-day routine, not even seeming to realize that someone was pranking him.  After all, who would dare toy with
Harry sighed, but when he spoke, his voice was level rather than annoyed.  “Yeah, I know.  But that’s okay.”  He handed Draco a nougat, which he accepted with a smile.
Draco smirked.  “It’s not my fault if your pranks are of lesser quality.”  He leaned on his arm, trying to blink away his lingering weariness.  Something clicked in his mind.  “By the way, how’d you even find my room?”  It hadn’t been a possibility he’d considered for this interaction.  Not that he was complaining – any attention Potter directed at him was viewed as a precious quantity.
The elf glanced sharply up at him when he was finished.  “Mister Malfoy!  You is having turned Mister Potter’s meal into snakes!”
No.  He would not accept Potter’s play at pity, and he would not talk to him either until he’d wiped that false passivity from his face.  He would engage with Draco as equals, or simply not at all.
Not that there’d be any news.  Draco had half a mind to hex her for getting his hopes up, for hyping up the romanticism of such an event as a Ball, when he knew Potter’s avoidance strategies all too well by now.  The man could barely stand to make eye contact for more than two seconds; he couldn’t even

, apparently.  He undoubtedly thought that, with someone as morally corrupt as a Malfoy, it didn’t matter if he didn’t tell the truth.  He deserved that little respect.
He tugged a tailcoat off its hanger forlornly.  There had been no occasion to wear this one lately – perhaps he could swing it for “spooky formal?”  The theme was a little vague.  Had it been “black tie with a macabre twist” or “costume party,” he would’ve known what he was dealing with – but, as it stood, he could hardly tell whether he was supposed to go as himself or not.

Their mother, and well-beloved baking show host, MOLLY WEASLEY, steps into the frame with a pan of piping hot scones to entice the audience.  In the background, we see the famed ‘Weasley Clock’ with a different family member’s face over each of the numbers; it is currently pointed to ‘Charlie-o’clock.’]

“Why are you so mad?”
Eyes locked, he pressed gently, and Draco’s mouth parted in silent wonder.  His throat bobbed, and –
It was real.
“I don’t deny it.”
“What are you talking about?” he forced himself to ask calmly.  Calmly, so he didn’t start panicking.  “We’ve been ‘going out’ for the past week.”
Draco retained his placid smile until the end.  “Are you quite finished?”
, and Draco’s panic had yet to settle.
[They taste each of HARRY’s rugelach, pausing to praise each of his unusual combinations.  The camera flashes to DRACO’s face in the background, becoming steadily more annoyed.  He puts his head in his hands when they reach HARRY’s final rugelach – the wild strawberry one, bound for failure – and have only nice things to say.]
“And I will,” Draco continued neutrally.  “But I’m still the same git who made fun of them their whole childhood, so if you’re just throwing us all together and expecting it to turn out well-”
“Well it’s not…” Harry sat up, dignified, speaking in a much more precise and calculated tone. “I mean, as a teacher, it is my right to know every interaction that occurs in my classroom. It’s necessary for the safety and wellbeing of my students.”
“I guess my plan is working, then.”
GEORGE: Please bring your bakes to the ends of your benches.
Harry smiled conspiratorially, like he’d cottoned on to what Draco was thinking, but then promptly shattered the illusion by saying, “Yeah, well, I would’ve been even sneakier if I’d been a Slytherin.  I don’t know if you’d like that so much.”
Anyway, the effect the altered pin was having on Malfoy was rather profound, actually – and Harry didn’t know quite what to make of it.  The blond kept opening and closing his mouth as if to say something, looking quite off-balance, and there was a definite tint of pink to his cheeks.

He sucked in a deep breath.  “I haven’t performed any
Potter wasn’t up on the witness stand excusing the atrocities he had committed, because he had simply been scared.  He knew the moment Potter was going to reference, and it hadn’t been merciful.  It certainly hadn’t been brave.  Draco had been too weak to see Potter killed and too weak to set him free, so he had merely done
It still felt a bit surreal.  Like he might wake in the hospital wing and be told he’d taken a bludger to the head on his first day of class and that the rest was his fantasy.
The last thing he wanted was for Harry to make excuses for him.
Draco could feel his cheeks heat up as he wondered what sappy thing he’d been caught doing.

Anyway – what’s the plan for tomorrow?”
Which was when he streaked to the opposite side of the pitch, bringing the Green Flash to its full speed with only the merest twitch of intention.
Weasley toyed with the edge of his coaster, a sneaky smirk on his face as he pretended to recall something. “Oh, I distinctly remember him saying something about Draco ‘being
A phrase repeated incessantly in his mind, so he decided to say it aloud.  He had no barriers right now – all his Occlusion had been hacked out of him as well.  “I can’t forgive him.  I can’t forgive him.  I just can’t-”
“I know,” Draco agreed quickly.  “And I’m sorry about it – I just…I don’t want to ruin things, but I just…  It’s hard for me to talk about my family.”
Harry hung his head and tried not to combust from embarrassment.  “But it’s so…stripey.  And the sleeves have these weird holes in them!  Like, what are these even for?”
Okay, so perhaps Potter wasn’t that interested.  After all, he had done his best to avoid Draco at every subsequent meal, proving that the Sorting feast had merely been a fluke.  He had even taken to dodging him in the halls – turning around and dashing in the other direction whenever he caught sight of him.
He was provoking Potter because it was familiar.  That was all.  An almost decade-long crush didn’t even factor into it.
Draco was intrigued.  What was Bagman doing here now?  Had he somehow dodged his debts?  He didn’t look supremely concerned about hiding – though, Draco supposed that perhaps the choice of pub was “hiding” enough, if his own decisions were at all similar.
He sounded freaked out enough

forgotten, Draco had spent the rest of the class watching Harry closely, eyes trailing him as he circled the class to offer help, miraculously never ending up in the same corner as Draco thereafter.  Draco had busied himself with a study of the back of Harry’s head – and was his neck slightly darker than usual, with the tinge of unwanted blush?
Then his words started to sink in.
Surprise flitted across Longbottom’s face.  “Harry?  Nah, I haven’t seen him.  I think something might’ve happened with Ginny though – he’s been in a rut for a while now, and that’s the only thing I can come up with.”
The blood that had pumped so furiously through him in the past few minutes seemed to freeze all at once.  The broom –

Draco felt himself breaking into a smile at that, and he drew Harry’s hand from his face in order to brush a kiss to knuckles.  The look Harry gave him was positively criminal.
and my potion – and the effects should fade within three to five minutes.  Tilt your head back.”
Draco shivered – not because of the words, but because he had said something similar to his mother recently.  And he was far past the point of feeling pleased at his and his father’s similarities.
