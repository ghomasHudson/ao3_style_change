Narcissa had reached the table by this stage, and she nodded approvingly as she settled herself in her chair. "You'd better wake your father, Draco," she said.
, or they behave for him because he's a really good teacher and can control the class?" Draco asked.
“I know, I’ve got lost so many times in the Barbican – you’d think it’d be easier now we’ve been here for four years, but it’s not, is it?” she said. “Ooh, look, though, there’s a tube sign. That must be the right way, surely?”
"Well, alright," said Harry, guiding Draco towards a giant Christmas tree which had a jolly-looking Santa Claus standing next to it bellowing "ho! ho! ho!" to anyone who came close. The apparition point was well-hidden around the back of the tree, and a minute later they were standing in a small alley. Well, Draco was standing; Harry was bent double and wheezing. "I'll get my breath back in a second," he said. "I really hate doing that."
A second later, Draco came with his own cock still untouched, at almost exactly the same moment that Harry stopped moving, and Draco could feel the ejaculate being pumped deep inside his body. They lay still, breathing heavily.
"Oy!" protested Harry, followed by "... actually, that's fair. Hermione has accused me of that on more than one occasion. What haven't I noticed now, though? Or, wait... obviously I do want to know that, but first I want to know when you, erm, changed your mind about me."
"Nah, we're not fussy," said Harry. "You mean you're going to cook yourself? I presumed you'd have, well, you know." He smiled up at the barmaid, who was collecting the empty glasses from the table.
Draco smiled fondly at him. "Well, do you also remember I said I'd learned the tenor solos but had never had a chance to perform them? That same choir has asked me to go and sing the solos for them on Sunday night. They had someone else booked - the same guy as last year, I think - but he's cancelled, and they thought of me. So I went to run through a few bits with the conductor - he said it was to save time on the day, but I think it was probably also because he hadn't actually heard me sing on my own."
, and wondered how Harry's children were coping. He went over to the Slytherin table, where Albus was sitting between Scorpius and Lily; the three of them were on the end, slightly apart from their housemates.
"He's a good bloke," commented Draco. "I was worried that I'd get a partner who'd give me a hard time because of my past, but he's been fine. I'm sorry again, though, Ron. I forgot this would affect you too."
"You can see Old Trafford from here, you know," said Draco. "Look, over there to the left. And those brightly-lit buildings to the right are the new BBC studios at Media City."
" said Granger, flicking her wand at the cat. He stared at her balefully and curled himself tighter.
"Can I try sucking your cock?" asked Harry, when he reached it. "I really want to. Only... I've never done it before, so you'll have to tell me if I do it wrong."
"Those last two aren't the same as the first two," said Draco. "They're just check measurements, really, but I want to be thorough."
"It’s a bit of both, I suppose," said Harry. "At least if we knew if was a recognised curse you’d be able to remove it."
"Right. Well, we divorced a few months ago." Potter started to say something sympathetic, but Draco cut him off. "No, no, don't worry; it was all very amicable, and we're still good friends. You see, ours was an arranged marriage. I'm gay, but my parents were so desperate for me to produce an heir that I agreed to it, on the condition that we would divorce once Scorpius left school. But Astoria met someone that she wants to spend the rest of her life with, and she wants to have a child with him, but her biological clock is ticking. So we divorced, but I want to help her as much as I can, because she stuck with me for so long despite the fact that I stopped sleeping with her after she got pregnant. She's never worked, and her new husband isn't very wealthy, so I want to give her enough money that she doesn't need to worry about living expenses. But my salary isn't enough for me to be able to give her as much as I'd like, so every little helps. The money I'll get for these two weeks will make a big difference."
Harry grinned. "I know you think it's hilarious, but it just tastes nicer! Champagne is a bit too bitter for me, usually."
"I know you've been cooking for yourselves ever since the war, but it still somehow surprises me every time I see evidence of it," said Draco as he sat down. "Did you make the soup yourself, or it is out of a tin?"
Harry grinned at him, taking in Draco's flushed face, unusually untidy hair and excessively red lips. "Go for it," he said. "What's the worst that can happen?"
"I'm looking forward to our date, Draco!" called Hermione, laughing, as she followed Ron out of the door.
present," said Ron. "Especially Harry. He still owes me from the other week. I'll let you off the hook, Draco, for looking after Hermione when she had her accident. I'll still expect
"You're a bad influence on me, you know," he told her. "I'd better restrain myself from doing things like
"Well, we've seen you perform," Ron pointed out. "You're pretty bloody talented. You know, for an ex-nemesis."
"It is. No two days are the same. But I'm curious – you could have asked me this inside. Why did we come out here?"
Draco and Harry looked at each other and burst out laughing. "Sorry," said Draco eventually, when he'd managed to stop giggling. "We did a lot of stargazing. We had some soup and a lot of cake. We talked a lot."
Weasley looked at him for a moment, his face inscrutable. "I'm going to get to the bottom of this," he said eventually. "It just seems too unlikely that
"It's only the truth," Scorpius said, but he smiled. "It's great to see you back, by the way. And I can't wait to watch you and my dad duelling. You won't hurt him, will you?"
Draco did so, and caught his breath when he saw that Harry was wearing nothing but the same grey pyjama bottoms that he'd been wearing on Saturday night when Draco had first  seen him. He opened his mouth to comment on this, but Harry held up his hand to stop him.
go well at first. But eventually I realised it wasn't all that different from brewing potions, and I've always been good at that. These days... well, I don't cook every night, but when I do it's usually OK."
"I'll race you," said Harry to Ron, rapidly scanning the report he'd just finished writing. He'd tried especially hard to make this one legible; maybe, for once, the secretaries wouldn't glare at him. "Last one there buys the first round."
"Less fan worship, more stripping, please," said Harry, grinning. He put his hands on Draco's shoulders as Draco slowly pulled down his underpants. Harry's cock sprang free, and Draco ran his fingers over it lightly, causing Harry to shudder. He stepped out of his underwear and then removed Draco's.
Andromeda nodded, and Harry gave Teddy a little shake. "Your mum's here to take you home," Harry told him when he opened his eyes, "but we're going out into the garden first."
"They're out there again, Harry," said Ron, as he returned to his seat in the library after going out to the toilet. "You'd think they'd have better things to do on a Friday night. And I still think you should tell McGonagall."
"It's oddly satisfying," said Lucius, getting up and going to the breadbin. "I never would have thought it, but it is. Not just the cooking itself, but feeding people and seeing them enjoy eating what I've made."
house, so it's only fair. In fact, I'll even cook for you. We can have a proper dinner date, with formal place settings and everything. And we can talk for as long as we like."
It did have one thing in common with Harry's first ever kiss, though, which was that Draco was crying. Harry pulled away slightly when he realised this, and looked at Draco, worried.
"Well, I suspect we'll get some strange looks if anyone sees us, but we'd get those wherever I was touching you, wouldn't we?" said Draco. "It's fine. At least your palms aren't sweaty."
"I take it you heard everything the doctor said, then?" he asked. "And, sorry for not asking immediately, but how are you feeling? I must say you seem quite a bit better than when we arrived."

lucky – lucky that they’re all stupid enough to go shopping on a Saturday afternoon," said Hermione, who’d rejoined them as Ron was speaking. "I can’t think of a more unpleasant time to go shopping."
Ron stared at Draco for a moment, and then at Harry for a longer moment, then sighed. "You know what? Fair enough. Now, I'd better get back so Hermione can get her bloody
to do something about it," said Draco. "And, as for pretending it's not there, I don't think I can do that." He grabbed Harry's hand and pulled it to his crotch, where it was obvious, even through his trousers, that Draco was as hard as Harry. Harry's gaze snapped back up to meet Draco's smirk.
in the last four days," said Harry, laughing as he shook her hand. "But it's lovely to meet you too."
Draco laughed. "Well, I doubt you'll get anyone to agree with you on that one," he said. "But I promise you I'll try my best to make this work... for both of us."
"Por favor, donde es la..." He realised he had no idea how to say 'press conference' but, just as he was trying to think up a way to mime it, a woman dressed in the Barcelona club colours of blue and red appeared from behind the gate and beamed at him.
While Harry's tongue was busy getting to know Draco's, his hands were on a mission of their own. He started off by removing his right hand from Draco's hair and running it over every millimetre of Draco's face. He lingered for quite while on the closed eyelids, fascinated by the way the long eyelashes fluttered at his touch; he suddenly wondered whether the fluttering was symmetrical, and brought up his left hand to mirror the movements of the right. This turned out to be slightly awkward while they were both lying on their sides, so Harry flipped Draco into a supine position and lay on top of him.
It was almost midnight when Harry finally returned, and Draco would have had trouble staying awake if he hadn't been so worried. He was just wondering whether or not it was worth sending an owl when Harry stumbled out of the fireplace.
"So, you think you’ve been cursed, but you’re not sure, and if you have been cursed then you don’t know what the curse actually does," Draco summed up half an hour later, after Harry had explained what had happened in Diagon Alley. They were seated side by side on a very comfortable leather sofa, and Draco had served coffee and scones, which were definitely adding to the relaxed atmosphere.
"I love you too," said Harry wryly. "Now would you mind waving that knife somewhere else before we sit down, please? Draco's already scared you might try to kill him."
"I'll get you a list sometime. Remind me," said Harry. "Now, will we be warm enough? I didn't bring a coat."
"Well, I'm not saying it's not been very helpful, because it has," said Draco. "But that doesn't mean I think your aim in life should be to be a househusband to me. I'd be very happy to split the chores. You're Harry bloody Potter, for fuck's sake. Isn't there anything
He quickly undid his trousers, and shoved them and his boxers down to his knees in a single movement. Harry was thrilled to finally gain sight of Draco's cock, but he'd hardly had time to register what it looked like (quite similar to his own, in fact) before Draco's mouth was on him again.
Harry grinned and stood up. "Let's hope we can still say that when I'm inside Malfoy Manor," he said. "How do you normally get there? Apparate?"
Harry looked up at him for the first time, and put his wedding ring on the mantelpiece. "I'll survive," he said. "Good news, though. I've just been to see McGonagall and explained what's happened. She's agreed to keep you on for the next week, even though I'll now be here too. I suggested to her that we could spend the week on duelling techniques – they're much easier to teach if there are two teachers together. So you needn't worry about the money – you'll get paid what she originally promised you."
"I know - we've talked about this, remember? Try thinking of it as a collaboration rather than them telling you what to do all the time. We have to make them understand that if things go on the way they have so far, you're going to burn out sooner rather than later, and then they won't have you at all. So it's in their best interests to find a way forward that works for you as well as them."
Harry stared at Draco, torn between wanting to shake some sense into him and wanting to kiss him so thoroughly that there would be no further doubting of feelings. He settled for the latter, and was relieved to gradually sense Draco finally becoming calmer.
Draco stared at his son, momentarily speechless. He handed the note back and watched as Scorpius summoned the waiter and asked him to owl it immediately; when he went on to ask for the bill, the waiter glanced at Draco, who shook himself and nodded. It wasn't until the bill had been brought to the table that Draco finally spoke.
Diagon Alley was heaving with people, no doubt all trying to buy last-minute Christmas presents. Luckily Harry had become very proficient at effective Disillusionment Charms, though, and within ten minutes of him stepping out from his customary secluded arrival point near the Knockturn Alley junction, he had reached the other end of Diagon Alley without anyone being aware of his presence. He let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding, and forced himself to relax.
Draco paused in his bacon dissection and looked at him, seeming slightly uncomfortable. "You know, we used to think it was hilarious at school, watching you eat," he said quietly. "It never occurred to any of us to wonder
"This... is quite a big deal, Harry," Hermione said. "You know how rare it is to be able to produce a corporeal Patronus at all, but for it to be a phoenix... I only know one other person whose Patronus was a phoenix."
"It is very weird, but that's the story of my life, isn't it?" said Harry, laughing as he realised this. "It's been OK so far, actually. No doubt we have all sorts of problems yet to come, but the first few hours of this bond have been... encouraging. We actually just came to tell you that we'll be living at Malfoy Manor for the time being; Kreacher's moving my stuff across from Grimmauld Place as we speak."
impressed," said Draco seriously. Harry laughed and punched him on the arm, and they started to walk towards the hospital.
Initially Draco seemed frozen with surprise, and his lips felt unyielding; gradually, though, he relaxed, and put both arms around Harry, pulling him closer as if to access as much of him as possible. Harry felt light-headed: this was unlike any kiss he'd ever had before, and he was loving it.
Harry burst out laughing. "Can't say I'm surprised," he said. "I did eat a very large amount of that earlier tonight. Oddly enough, I think yours tasted of asparagus."
Draco squeezed his hand, concerned. "Of course," said Narcissa. "Forgive me for asking. I am sorry to hear that you had such an unpleasant experience."
– I can't usually sing it without getting a tear in my eye, so I dread to think what I'll be like with you in front of me. That's why I wanted to try it out on you when there's no other audience."
for at least a year, so he'd also be giddy with delight that his feelings were reciprocated," Draco told him.
"Bugger," sighed Harry, who'd forgotten about the paint. That meant a further delay before he could get coffee. He ducked into the gents' toilets and spent five minutes hiding in a cubicle (ten seconds fixing his face with magic, and the rest of the time waiting until anyone who'd seen him enter should have left).
“Draco, I want to talk about everything that’s happened today, because it’s all been amazing, but I want to have enough time to do it properly, and right now we have a load of people waiting for us. So can I propose a plan? I’m going to kiss you senseless for four and a half minutes. Then we’re going to go and be sociable for a while. Then – if you still want to – we can wander through the shops in Diagon Alley. And finally I want to take you to bed for several days so we can talk in between lengthy bouts of sex. How does that sound?”
"Not huge in terms of numbers, but it's the best music college in London," said Draco. "I think there are only about 900 students, but some of those are drama students. Mostly it's music students, though – about 700, I think. The Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music are both slightly bigger, but not quite as good."
Hermione raised her eyebrows at Ron, who stared back at her for a moment and then sighed. "No argument," he said. "And I'm sorry about this morning. What would you like to drink? Coffee OK?" They all nodded. "How d'you take yours, Malfoy?"
Very short one tonight, because I've only had a total of about 8 hours' sleep out of the past 72. *zzzzzzzzzzz* But tomorrow I am totally free and planning to write THOUSANDS OF WORDS \o/
Draco nodded quickly. "Be my guest," he said, slightly croakily. He put his hands in Harry's hair, and then threw his head back and moaned as Harry's lips closed round the tip of his cock.
And, for the first time ever, an ethereal tabby cat burst from the end of his wand and dashed down the street; Hermione whooped in delight, and Harry flung his arms round Draco and kissed him until his knees started to wobble.
Harry took a deep breath. "Would you mind very much if I don't explain right now? It's not a very cheerful story, and if I start talking about it now it'll be on my mind for the rest of the day, and I don't want to depress myself. I promise I
"None taken," said Draco. He hadn't actually expected Potter to answer his question, and the fact that he
"OK, well, you know I trust you. Just send your Patronus if you need me. But for the moment we'll leave you to your entertaining." Harry turned to the fireplace.
Harry felt bewildered as to where Draco might be going with this, but tried to remember. "Erm... well, obviously you know about Barcelona, and before that it was Sydney," he said. "And a few days before Sydney we were in Chicago.... oh, and Johannesburg before that. And Rio - you probably heard about that one because of the protests - and of course it all started in Beijing."
Humbled, he stood there and bowed and waved and smiled; he brought Rabia out for another bow, and then they both bowed and waved and smiled some more. When they went off for the second time, the stage manager was still smiling.
He'd just found the last object – "Abacus! There you are!" when there was a disturbance in the air and Harry landed, stumbling, in the middle of the room. Draco leapt up to steady him.
"I set my own hours, really, but I'm usually in for nine o'clock, and I'd better not be late tomorrow, because I took the afternoon off today so there'll probably be loads of things waiting for me to deal with," said Harry. "But until then I'm all yours. Unless there's an emergency and I get called in."
"He did. He spent quite some time listing your good qualities, in fact, but the one that impressed me most is that he described you as 'a really good friend'. I have to say that I'm delighted... and I don't need to ask whether you feel the same way, because I can see it in your face."
Harry leapt up from the sofa. "Of course! That's it!" He dashed into the bedroom and began rummaging through the wardrobe.
"Alright, alright, let's worry about one week at a time," said Ron. "Tomorrow or Thursday, then, to be going on with. Let us know. But if they don't want us to come, just tell us, OK?"
"The Aurors knew, certainly," said Harry. "But no, it wasn't really a topic of conversation generally. Probably because of the lack of TV."
"We did, but I’ve hardly seen him since the war," said Draco. "He and his mother went to live in Italy as soon as they found out they hadn’t been charged with any war crimes, and I was a bit unimpressed that he didn’t contact me to see how my trial went. So I didn’t contact him either, and it all was a bit awkward the next time I saw him, at some event or other, especially as we didn’t really get a chance to talk properly. But then a few months later we bumped into each other again, and cleared the air. And every time I’ve seen him since it’s been fine, even though that’s been less and less frequent."
Draco had been delighted to see how much better Harry's mood seemed after a good sleep, especially when he hadn't even reacted
Draco expected to find it difficult to get back to sleep, given how turned on he was, but within minutes of them getting back into the sleeping bag his eyes were closing. He tried to work out how much sleep they'd already had, but that would have involved knowing what time it was, and it was far too cosy lying wrapped around Harry for him to consider reaching for his wand. Harry, in fact, was quietly snoring already, and this made Draco give up trying to think.
She set off at high speed towards the stairs, and Harry and Draco looked at each other before following her.
"Oh... well, yes, I suppose he would," said Ginny. "But I could easily cast it on him as well, if you want."
"The Geminid radiant is… well, I can't remember exactly, but Gemini's almost due south right now, so it must be somewhere around there." Harry shuffled around until they were both facing south and spooning, with Harry in front of Draco.
Arthur rushed into the room, and there was a predictable delay while the basics of Bluetooth were explained. Harry was only half-sure he understood the concept himself, but Arthur seemed happy, so the questions ended and Draco stood up to perform, setting the speaker on the mantelpiece.
could undress you," said Harry. "Actually, this is going to be awkward unless we actually get out of the bag, isn't it?"
"That class has your son in it, though, remember," said Harry, trying not to grin at Draco-the-drama-queen. "And
"Well I never. Who are you, and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?" murmured McGonagall. Then she smiled. "I must say, I'm looking forward to seeing you two duel again, though. I'll definitely be visiting some of your lessons this week. I hope you'll be able to find at least
I didn't actually know much more about it than that. So I made sure I rectified that before I came."
a few people who pop round from time to time," said Draco. "Aunt Andromeda is probably the most regular, actually, and sometimes she brings Teddy."
lovely," he said a moment later. "Now, intrigued as I am by the Kilgharrah question, the thing I most urgently want to know is: how  did you end up in this flat? And how did you learn to cook?"
, and therefore he would wait a few hours before going. When he got home, though, he was surprised to find a note stuck to the middle of the window.
"Goodnight, Draco," said Harry, planting one last quick kiss on Draco's lips before popping out of sight.
Harry came over and sat at the table with him. "Look, I know I'm not the best-qualified person to say this, but I'm sure you'll be fine. I get what you're saying about supply teachers, and I've heard all the horror stories, but at least you're not a supply teacher who's also a
," said Harry. "I couldn't think what to say. I just stood there looking stupid. So then she sighed and said 'I suppose we'll have to talk about this now – just give me a moment', and she scribbled a note and owled it to someone. And then it all came out."
"Flat, not house. And, maybe another time," Draco promised. "Right now, it's your turn to talk about something awkward that we both know you're avoiding."
Draco hummed in agreement, as they reached the top of the stairs and he led Harry into the first room along the landing. It was the biggest bedroom Harry had ever seen – in fact, if it hadn't been for the bed in the middle of the far wall, he would have assumed it was another ballroom.
"Just a bit," Harry admitted. "I think I might get into the sleeping bag. Will you join me? Or do you want to eat first?"
"There you go, changing the subject again," said Harry, stroking the side of Draco's neck with his thumb. "I'm starting to think that maybe you don't want to kiss me after all?"
Harry and Draco talk. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that Draco knows a lot more about Harry's life than vice versa.
That made him open his eyes, and he found himself looking at Draco, who was sitting next to him on the bed. Draco looked quite worried, but then he smiled reassuringly at Harry.
Draco laughed. "I don't think anyone who was in the Hall that day will ever forget that line. I never quite dared to mention it to my parents, though, so I've no idea whether or not they found it as funny, in hindsight, as I did."
"I could tell neither of you were sleeping, actually," said Ron. "But I figured you'd talk about it when you were ready, and until then there was no need to burden you with the fact that I couldn't either. It helped quite a bit that I knew it was happening to all three of us, though. And you know what, Harry? Your new touchy-feely-ness has made a difference too."
The game Draco is playing is Seekers Notes: Hidden Mystery, and I entirely blame Alisanne for getting me as addicted to it as she is!
"Listen," said Harry when they paused for breath, "I'm sorry. You're right, I should have said it straight away. But I think I'd sort of already realised, when Hermione told us it couldn't be broken, that I was happy about that, so in my head the decision was already made long before we got Ginny's message. I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear."
"True, but there's a reason that formal meetings tend to have action points or something similar. Otherwise what's the point of the meeting?"
Harry instantly understood Draco's panic. "Maybe your throat's just dry," he said. "Let me get you some water." He did a quick wandless
"They do now," said Albus. "Dad asked me point blank whether Score and I are more than just friends – he saw us holding hands tonight, before you went out. So I told him the truth. James and Lily already knew, but Mum looked a bit cross. I think she was about to make a fuss, till Dad said something to her. And then he started talking about them getting divorced, and my love life wasn't mentioned again." He sounded a bit uncertain.
Harry's head snapped back to Draco. Draco rolled his eyes. "Let me guess – you hadn't really taken in the full implications of that either, had you?"
It took a moment for Harry to work out what on earth he was talking about, but when he did  he mentally kicked himself. "I
– it's not that big a deal. We'll still spend lots of time together. And remember how I said I can count? All four Houses have got an odd number of boys. So if you and I shared, either Neville, Seamus or Dean would have to share with someone from another House. And I reckon it'd be fun sharing with any of them, so if you're really OK at the thought of sharing with Malfoy then I'm fine with it too."
At that moment, there was a bright flash behind him, and Draco turned to see a streak of light flying into the room, which then resolved itself into a bright silver stag. It stopped right in front of Draco and said, in Harry's voice, "Listen, I know I promised to owl you, but I've been trying to write a letter to you for the last hour and I keep writing gibberish and throwing the paper away. I'm not even sure what I want to say, which is probably the reason for the gibberish, but I do know that I enjoyed spending time with you yesterday and I'd like to see you again. Erm... I don't suppose you're free right now? Because if so you could, erm, come here? If you'd be comfortable? Or if not I could come to you. Or anywhere really! Erm, that sounds pathetically desperate, doesn't it? I promise I'm not
Harry shivered deliciously at the thought of Draco touching him, and bent his head back to the man's nipple, beaming. He spent quite a while trying to decide which nipple tasted better, switching his mouth from one to the other several times until both were reddened and protruding. His hands, in the meantime, were mapping Draco's arms and torso, and when he eventually abandoned the nipples (slightly concerned that they might be getting sore) he gave in to the urge to lick what his hands had been feeling, to see what that perfect skin tasted like.
Harry looked at McGonagall in surprise, and she raised her hands in confession. "Guilty as charged," she said. "And, before you ask, I should warn you that Mr Finnigan's NEWT students are extremely excited, and they have been telling everyone at Hogwarts what's about to happen. Which, I'm afraid, is probably why so many of them are here. If it's any consolation, however, I do not believe that any of them are aware of the
"Leave the poor bloke alone, Ginny," said Arthur gently. "You've done enough to him for one day. We've all told you it's over, and now Harry has very clearly told you the same thing. The least you can do is spare him the rant we got when Ron told you Harry would never agree to get back with you."
Harry thought about this. "Well, I mean, I'm at Ron and Hermione's a few times a week for one reason or another, and they usually ask me to stay for food, so of course we chat then. And I talk to people at work. And I do go to the Burrow every week for Sunday lunch, and there are always loads of people there to talk to."
paperwork very much. I really wanted to be out in the field the whole time, but as Head Auror I hardly ever got to do that. So eventually I decided that there was no point in sticking with a job I'd grown to hate, and Dawlish died just when I was trying to decide what to do instead. I used to love teaching the DA in fifth year, and I'd already done some guest lecturing at Hogwarts over the years, so I found I quite fancied the idea of the DADA job."
"Harry, this is Rabia," said Draco, giving Harry a quick peck on the lips as he gestured towards his companion. "She's my accompanist, and you're about to see how brilliant she is. There's nothing she can't do on a piano."
But then Draco glanced at the rest of the row, and it took all his training to prevent his jaw falling open. On the other side of Hermione was Andromeda, and next to her was Draco’s mother, who gave him a little wave when he saw her – which was a bit of a cheek, Draco thought, considering that she hadn’t seemed interested when he’d mentioned his recital to her a couple of weeks earlier.
"Ready, willing and able," said Harry with a grin. He took hold of Draco's arm, and held his breath as they Apparated.
PLEASE NOTE INCREASED RATING, especially if you're reading at work! I've had this scene in my head since the start, but it's taken me a while to get them here. I only hope LJ will fix itself in time for me to actually post this for the challenge. It's currently 2.45am and LJ's been down all night, and I need to sleep! But at least I can put it on AO3.
"Not quite the end of the world, but we may have to reschedule our plans slightly. I don't suppose you brought any lube with you?"
"Do you really think we should approach them in the pub, though?" Hermione wondered. "It seems a bit informal for such a big discussion. Plus, I don't think we should do it as a group. What do you think, Draco?"
Not the most helpful of prompts today – why did I say yesterday there were no Christmas decorations in Draco’s flat?!?
" Draco paused for breath while the backing track added a female choir to its orchestra, and then joined in again, getting louder and higher. Harry was vaguely aware of a small crowd of people gathering around them to listen, but he couldn't tear his eyes away from Draco.
"Usually I just invoice when the job’s complete, but if you prefer you could pay in instalments," said Draco.
obviously been lying, through her actions," he said. "Lying doesn't have to involve words. In fact, in this case she's lying through the
"I think that's the furthest thing it's possible to see with the naked eye – have I remembered that right?"
Harry, who had relaxed slightly at the news that he had not in fact been outed before he was ready, tensed up again at the reminder of the bathroom incident. Draco saw his face and reached over to put an arm round him. "I'm so sorry, I should have used a different example," he said. "That was thoughtless of me. Look, we've already put that incident behind us. I don't expect anyone to
He was instantly hit with the icy air, and shivered. He put his boots back on without bothering with his socks, grabbed the red-bulb torch and trudged off away from the campsite. He went as far as a small group of bushes that he'd noticed in the distance; when he reached them, he realised that they were holly bushes, covered in bright red berries.
Harry bought a cappuccino from the very bored-looking girl behind the counter, and hurried back to Malfoy's table. Malfoy was dressed quite differently to the day before, he noticed. Gone was the elegant black; in its place was a soft grey woollen sweater and faded jeans, although there was still an artfully-draped scarf. Harry laughed when he realised it was a Slytherin scarf.
Short one tonight, due to Wednesdays being impossible. But no more Wednesdays in the challenge after this one! \o/
On a chilly Tuesday afternoon in December, Harry Potter was walking slowly through a snow-covered park. To a distant observer he would have appeared lost in thought, but in fact he was eating a large (and very unhealthy) tub of churros and struggling to stay awake. He had only left Hogwarts an hour beforehand and would be back there late that night, but he'd had very little sleep the night before; on top of his usual ridiculous workload, he'd also had to make sure he'd prepared sufficient work and left sufficiently thorough instructions for all his students in the classes he was missing. (To be fair, Headteacher McGonagall had not specifically asked him to do so, but they both knew that it would have to be done.)
"Well, it hardly makes up for the amount you've let me whinge at you, but you're welcome," said Harry. "Will I see you at lunchtime, or are you going to be busy till tonight?"
time we've been in bed together. Anal sex is just a different type of fabulousness. It's being with you, in general, that's the amazing thing."
"You can sing lots of them without the books, though, can't you, I bet?" said Harry. "Sing me one now. Please?"
"My semi-hard-on. That's what you were looking at, isn't it? I would have dealt with it in the shower, but I felt a bit awkward knowing you were just in here."
Harry looked slightly puzzled, but nodded. "I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that, but I'm happy to discuss it," he said. "I'm much more interested in what you've been doing, though. Tell me, while I make the coffee. How do you take it, by the way?"
"I don't really see how you could do it wrong, as long as you don't actually bite," said Draco, somewhat shakily. "I'd be delighted to be your test case, though."
"But what's actually happened to them? If you don't mind me asking," said Harry. "I'd say it looked a bit like Alzheimer's, but they can't be old enough, can they?"
"A total cock-up is what's going on, and I got there just in time to witness it," said Ron. "Which was about an hour ago, before you ask. But I do think you're more likely to accept it once you see what happens when Draco lets go of you. Go on, Draco."
"Elf King," said Harry thoughtfully. "Huh. I wouldn't have guessed that. I couldn't understand most of the words, but I got the impression you were playing several different characters. And did one of them die at the end?"
"That'd be great, but please don't feel you've got to keep it up all night," said Harry. "If you can manage an hour, that'd be brilliant, though. If I do make it to the lake, I'll head back after an hour."
Draco grinned. "I am," he admitted apologetically. "But it can wait until I've talked to you about it, Hermione."
"I have to admit I was wondering more about the pyjamas," said Draco. "It's four o'clock in the afternoon."
it?" wondered Harry. "That's what I'm dying to know. It can't have been easy, but I'm amazed you could do it at
"You are. And you'll be slightly proud, I think - at least I hope so! That was my condition for agreeing to be at the Ministry's beck and call for the bid. The
permanently. Three: We put a halt to the whole thing and never see each other again. Four: Some sort of compromise."
Ginny glared at them all and stormed out, slamming the door behind her. "Sorry about that," said Arthur. "She does know how to behave usually, Draco, I assure you. I hope this hasn't put you and Harry off coming here."
"She thinks of everything, doesn't she?" commented Ron, grinning as he did as instructed, while Draco shuffled along.
. I couldn't get to her in time to stop her. Draco saw what was happening but he couldn't get to her either, but he
It took Draco a while to get rid of Scorpius so he could start unpacking. He had managed to resist the temptation to tell Scorpius that he'd be joining him at Hogwarts for the next two weeks, although he
"Deal," said Harry, performing a cleaning charm on both of them as Draco climbed out of the sleeping bag.
Harry obligingly crawled out, grabbing his glasses on the way and putting them on. "I want to see what you're going to do," he explained, as Draco climbed out after him.
Hermione beamed. "It is," she agreed. "Anyway, I don't want to take up your whole afternoon. It's a lovely day for a walk in the garden with your partner – you should make the most of it!" And, with that, she winked at them and Apparated.
Draco decided he was in a benevolent mood, and took pity on him. "Well, if I'd know about that part before, I think I would have been appalled," he said, "but in fact it doesn't seem to have upset anyone nearly as much as I might have expected."
She flicked the switch on the wall behind her, and the room fell into darkness, lit only by the fairy lights enveloping Harry.
"OK," said Harry slowly. "Sounds lovely, but you sounded quite keen to be here, and I think I'm missing why? Although it does have the most impressive Christmas tree I've seen this year."
"I've been thinking about this for quite a while, and I've talked about it to quite a few people," Harry went on, "and I've decided I'm going to spend a lot of my time, for the foreseeable future at least, managing Draco's singing career, and maybe the careers of a few other musicians too. Now, I know this is very different from anything I've done before, and I may turn out to be useless at it, but I'm very keen to give it a go. But if you're thinking what I suspect you're thinking, I'd like you to listen to what my very good friend Ronald Weasley has to say."
As Harry introduced them, Draco and Rabia were standing at the door of the side room where they'd been waiting for the last hour or so. Draco was dressed all in black, but quite casually: slim-fit black chinos and an open-necked black shirt. Rabia had got changed following her solo stint, and was now wearing a sleeveless dress with lots of layers in various shades of green.
Harry smiled for the first time in a while. "Sure," he said. "That would be lovely. What have you got lined up?"
Draco took his cloak from the back of the door and put it on as Harry came over to him. "Listen, thank you," said Harry quietly. "For everything. Especially for making my kids happy. That's an unexpected bonus."
looking quite pretty too. That black suit really suits you. Normally I'd say it was too sombre, but the contrast between you and the fairy lights means you look extra stunning. I guarantee that when you step up to the mic everyone will be looking at you. And my advice then would be to speak from the heart. Don't look at your notes - they'll all be gazing at you, so you just need to hold their gaze, and that's the main thing they'll remember from today, I suspect. Then, next time (assuming you get forced to do it again) you'll know what to expect, but also the novelty of you being here will have worn off slightly, so that's what you'll need a good speech - but by then you'll have one."
"I was just suddenly amused at the idea of a fourth unforgivable curse: the Delayed Apology. They didn't teach
"No depressing thoughts today," Harry warned him. "We're going to have fun skating - particularly since I've never done it before and I should've known you would have, so you'll be able to laugh at me when I inevitably fall over a lot - and then I have a surprise for you afterwards. Which I
Hermione laughed and moved to the doorway. Ron, however, stood up in alarm. "Naked?!?" he cried. "Why the bloody hell are you getting naked? And why aren't you worrying about
is an interesting way of putting it," he said. "What Oliver here is reluctant to tell you, Harry, is that I am still on probation, and one of the conditions of that probation is that if the Ministry ask me to do something within reason, I can't refuse. Amusingly, 'within reason' has never been fully defined, but I suppose that a trip to Spain to speak at a press conference isn't the worst thing they could have asked."
He closed his eyes, still grinning uncontrollably, and fell asleep soon afterwards, revelling in the sensation of Harry's arms around him.
Harry flushed. "I had an owl," he admitted, hoping his son wouldn't ask what his response had been. "She sounds fine. I'm sure she'll be in touch with you after the England camp's finished."
Harry laughed. "You're just jealous," he said. "Don't worry, though, I'm sure Hermione will be able to find some way to entertain you, despite her recent injuries. She's a trooper."
As soon as they reappeared in Draco's flat, Draco found himself pressed up against the wall, being thoroughly kissed.
"When you drive on the motorway from Lancashire into Yorkshire, there's a white rose on a pillar by the road at the point where you enter Yorkshire," Draco informed him. "In the other direction, there's a red rose."
Ron stopped mid-sentence, and he and Hermione both stared at Harry. "What d'you mean? What d'you think's happening right now? You talk to us all the time!"
"Half past eight," said Draco. "You asked me to wake you for breakfast, but since you weren't having it in the hall I thought I may as well let you sleep a bit longer. I've eaten, and it's nearly time for me to go to my
"With the coffee? No," said Harry, switching the kettle back on. "With the rest of my life? Almost certainly. But let's start with you. I haven't seen you since... well, since your trial, so I assume you've been out of the country?"
"So I am very happy about what seems to be happening between Harry and me, but it's a very new thing and I don't want to try and label it. I know how close Harry is to you, and I would never want to get between you, but I think we'd both appreciate it if you could give us a bit of time to get to know each other better."
"It's bloody freezing, I can tell you," said Harry. "But definitely an experience. Teddy's already had enough, though – he wants to go home tomorrow."
"You did, but these are new ones," said Draco. "I always do this when I take on a new class. Don't you?"
Draco found himself applauding. "A badger, eh? That was a very impressive Patronus, though. Well done."
He was asleep very soon after that, but woke briefly when he heard Harry come in some time later. Had he not been so exhausted, he might well have opened his eyes to ogle when he heard Harry removing his clothes; as it was, however, he merely turned slightly towards Harry's side of the bed, and mumbled a drowsy "Hello" when he felt the mattress move slightly.
He stared at the sky near the south-western horizon, which was filled with a glorious array of colours. As his eyes became adapted to the dusk, he spotted the very thin crescent of the Moon, low in the southern sky. It wasn't dark enough for many stars to be visible yet, but there was a bright one only a degree or so above the horizon, in the reddest part of the sky where the Sun had just set. He puzzled over this for a minute – it was in the right sort of area to be Antares, but he was pretty sure Antares was never visible in the winter – until he realised, gleefully, that it must be Mercury.
Draco nodded gratefully, and Harry explained what had happened. "So, any ideas?" he finished. "Draco has an important recital on Friday. He's been practising for it for months, and he
As the letters faded away, Draco quickly got dressed. Harry gave him a quick hug and led the way downstairs to the fireplace. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder, passed the pot to Draco, shouted "The Burrow!" and stepped through the flames.
"I had to do that too, if it's any consolation," Lucius admitted. "Not that there were any books in the Manor library that helped. But the internet is a wonderful thing, isn't it?"
wasn't thinking clearly, because I should have realised you wouldn't believe me. So, fine. I'll go back and tell her that her husband won't help her, so she'll have to turn to someone else. Just remember, when you
"No, four o’clock should be OK," said Harry. "I’m the boss, remember? But is that convenient for you?"
Just after midnight, Draco and Harry arrived back in Harry's living room at Grimmauld Place, exhausted.
Albus sighed. "I don't think he is, no," he confessed. "He did smile a few times while he was telling us – he did most of the talking – but I think he was forcing himself. He had a look in his eyes that I don't know how to describe – I've never seen it before, but he definitely didn't look happy. And Mum seemed fine, but I think she was worried about Dad. She even came over to me and James, while Dad was hugging Lily goodbye, and asked us to keep an eye on him while he's here. We told her about
"Are you OK? Your hands are shaking." Harry's voice made Draco jump: neither of them had spoken since teatime.
“No! Well, yes, in a way! But no,” she said. “But I don’t know what to do, and you seem to be quite good at miracles, so I figured it was worth asking you.”
Harry was mortified. "You'd think that by now I'd be used to the idea of everyone talking about me," he muttered. "But I didn't know they were
The door opened and the guide beckoned them towards him. "But first we have some Russians to dazzle," said Draco. "Poshli!"
he asked. "Hmm. Actually, I suppose I can see why you would think that. But it's not true. There are several reasons why I offered, but that's not one of them. And yes, it'd be nice to be with Ron, but it's not as if I won't see him, and I really don't mind sharing with you, believe it or not. And, before you ask, Ron understands why I suggested this, and he's fine with it. Now then, I
Hermione and Ron both nodded, and Draco stood up, wondering when he'd become part of 'Draco and I' but deciding he rather liked it. Harry leaned over to kiss Hermione on the cheek, and whispered something in her ear that made her beam at him.
Draco looked at him quizzically. "I’m already wearing a pendant," said Harry, removing it from inside his shirt. It was a silver dagger, with a dragon attached to each side and a ruby in the hilt. "I saw it in a shop a few years ago and thought it was really cool. Maybe… Can I give it to you? Would you wear it?"
that you'd probably rather it was you than any of them, but at the time all I could think about was that things hadn't gone well for our side, and that meant things got worse for me. I was too preoccupied to think about what you might be feeling – I think I just vaguely assumed it was the opposite of me. And... erm... drama?"
felt different. All she ever seemed to want was for us to go out in public, and you know what happened the one time we did."
"That's the main reason I wanted to talk to you both about this," said Draco. "Harry's had this idea about what he wants to do with his life, and I was unsure at first, but he's very persuasive, and I've been thinking about it since last night and I can't think of any reasons why it won't work. And if anyone can, I think it'll be you two, so if you both like the sound of it then I'm going to go for it."
At three minutes past nine the following morning, Harry was sitting in his office yawning when his assistant knocked on the open door.
There was neither bell nor door knocker, so Draco rapped sharply on the glass. He waited for a couple of minutes before doing so again. This time, a light came on inside, and someone could be heard to be coming down the stairs; then the door opened, and Harry Potter was there.
A second later, he was sprawling on the dew-damp grass, having tripped over the side of his own chair.
"Yes, Harry returned it to me after my trial," Draco said, causing several heads to snap up in surprise; it looked as if Harry had not told them this. "I was very surprised but also very grateful, as you can probably imagine. I had not yet had a chance to obtain a replacement, and was struggling  to manage without one."
Harry nodded, blushing furiously but grinning, and Draco continued. "Head... neck... full shoulder width... back width... half back length... full back length..."
it was the right spot. He looked around him; there was no sign that anything had ever happened there. He let out a shuddering breath he'd been unaware he was holding.
"And please forgive Scorpius," Draco added. "He doesn't actually know for sure that we're together now, but he asked me whether I fancied Harry, while we were out on Thursday night; I wouldn't have told him otherwise, but I couldn't lie to him when he asked me outright. But I asked him not to tell anyone else, because at that point I wasn't sure whether or not Harry felt the same way."
Granger seemed to be asleep when they reached her bed, and Draco stood back slightly as Potter stared at her, aghast. "She looks so
Draco's opinion of the snowman was that it was a publicity stunt for something or other, but neither he nor Harry could work out what. They considered Alohomora-ing the door open so they could see whether it was actual snow, but found they'd lost interest by the time they'd agreed it wasn't worth the risk.
"Most of it was, yes," said Hermione. "And some of it is a surprise, so don't go rooting through them, Ron." He grinned at her, finally seeming calmer. "Ooh, I did get one thing I can show you now, though. Pass me that big Hamleys bag?"
"I think she likes you," said Draco, smiling fondly down at her. "Sadly, she'll still probably run and hide again if I put her down, but that's only because she doesn't often see anyone other than me." He loosened his hold, and as predicted the tabby leapt out of his arms and made a dash for the bedroom.
A few hours later, Harry was lying in his bed entwined with a naked Draco, on the verge of sleep and thinking that he couldn't remember the last time he'd been so content. They'd ended up ordering a curry when they realised they were too hungry to wait for food to cook; afterwards, they were so full they decided they'd better get some exercise, so Harry had led Draco around every nook and cranny of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. This had involved considerable embarrassment and many apologies: Harry hadn't realised how long it had been since he'd cleaned properly. There were some rooms that hadn't been touched at all since he'd persuaded Kreacher to retire (the elderly house-elf had gone to live to Hogwarts, where he apparently enjoyed shouting at some of the portraits).
At seven o’clock the following evening, Harry was standing at the entrance to the Queen’s House, greeting audience members as they arrived. The grounds looked beautiful, with a light frost covering the whole of the huge lawn and the River Thames sparkling in the distance, but all his attention was on the sheer number of people streaming along the path. The concert wasn’t due to start for another half-hour, but by his reckoning there were already well over a hundred people who’d entered.
"Because they can spend years at C!" said Lily, collapsing into giggles. "But that's not even the best one. Why are pirates called pirates?"
"I'm going to stop you right there," said Draco, taking the candy cane out of his mouth for a moment. "You seem to have missed out a large part of the story."
Draco smiled sadly. "Do you really need me to answer that question? People don't tend to want to help a Malfoy. We didn't exactly cover ourselves in glory in the war, did we?"
hurt – it was just verbal abuse. It didn't seem so bad at the time, but if he was getting that every time he left the house, I'm not surprised he went into hiding. I wonder how long he's been back in the country?"
"I'm pleased to hear that," said Draco, who was resting his head on Harry's chest. "Although I hope that doesn't mean you'll be disappointed next time I do it."
By the time Harry finally pushed his cock into Draco's arse, he felt much less terrified. They'd kissed and fondled each other for a long time before Draco had guided Harry's fingers towards his hole. Harry was very used, by now, to licking this area, so he was surprised to find that inserting his fingers somehow felt
any news as surprising as this. Draco Malfoy, eh? I take it he's less... unpleasant than he used to be? I can't imagine you'd be getting on so well with him if not."
"I've only just got here," said Draco. "And your husband is still at The Burrow. He laughed quite a lot at the idea that you might have sent
"We led them round the whole castle, but after an hour or so we headed back here," said Draco. "They were all hanging about at the end of the corridor for a while – Neville went out to check, and he said they were still there twenty minutes ago. But we were hoping they'd assume you'd settled in for the night and go away, and it looks as if we were right."
(No prompt! And sorry for the delay with this final part. Initially it was due to technology issues, but then lethargy set in. Needless to say, tonight, when I finally got round to finishing it, the internet has been down all night, but let's see if I can post it via my phone. And, I do realise that the whole story is total rubbish and nothing happens other than a few songs, sorry, but I enjoyed writing it anyway! Thank you to those who have followed along.)
Harry's voice cracked with emotion during the last line, and tears were running down his cheeks. Draco wiped them away, and kissed him before whispering in his ear. It took a moment before the applause began, because it seemed that everyone was sniffling, but when it did it quickly became a roar.

"When I got home after I saw you on Saturday night, I went straight to bed, but I didn't sleep for quite a while, because I was thinking about you. Most of all, I was thinking about the way you
"Sorry," Harry muttered, but Draco grinned, licked up the fluid, and continued, feeling ridiculously pleased with himself. By the time the lights were totally gone from Harry's bits, the man was a quivering wreck again, and was leaning on Draco's shoulder for support. Draco took pity on him and did the top half of his body much faster, throwing the still-glowing fairy lights onto the grass when he reached the end.

both still coming to the Burrow tomorrow, aren't you?" Ron was saying. "I'm told Mum you are, so you'd better not have changed your minds."
live in Manchester. It’s hardly their fault that their team is so famous that it has fans all over the world, is it? #bitofasorepoint
"I think I read a theory once that he had a secret pouch inside his cape," said Draco, obligingly raising his arms. "The more interesting question, to me, is where his cape is when he's dressed as Clark Kent. I mean, it's quite big, isn't it? Is it already attached to his shoulders or does he put it on when he changes? Either way, won't there be a strange bulge?"
"You know I'd've been offended if you'd asked anyone else," she said as she sank into an armchair. "I love playing for you. I hardly ever get a chance to chat to you now, though. Are you enjoying the postgrad course?"
When Draco stepped out of Harry's fireplace a few minutes later, he was surprised to find that the room was empty. He was even more surprised to find his shoulders relaxing, having not realised how tense he was. "Get it together, Draco," he muttered to himself. "He invited you, remember?"
time at school, let alone look perfectly comfortable there, with no-one batting an eyelid – but then he leaned back against the wall and allowed himself to gaze at his daughter.
Draco smiled softly. "That's sweet of you to say," he said. "I'm fine, though. Mother does come to stay every once in a while – she was here last week, in fact. It was her that brought the Christmas tree and put all the decorations up."
Draco looked up at him and smiled, and Harry gave him a quick kiss. Ron stared for a moment, and then laughed.
"We love each other," said Harry wonderingly, before kissing Draco to see if it felt any different with this new-found knowledge. (It did.)
"I've never thought of myself as good-looking, so I find that hard to believe," said Harry. "It's nice of you to say so, though. Now, this is all very civilised, but why are our clothes still on?"
"And how did you find it, when it was back in your possession, if I may ask?" wondered Mr Ollivander.
They both got into the mega sleeping bag and wormed their way down until they were both lying flat on their backs, side by side with their feet at the bottom of the bag. "How d'you want to do this?" asked Harry. "Face to face or spooning?"
"Lucky for you you've got such an incredible body, or I might be tempted to storm off in a huff," grumbled Harry. "Speaking of which, I really want to fuck you, but I'm getting sleepy and I want to be able to give that my full attention, so maybe not tonight. But please can I suck your cock?"
Draco led Harry right up to the window, so that they could face Lucius and Narcissa. There was still no reaction, however, until Draco reached out and waved his hand in front of his mother's face. She looked confused for a moment, and then smiled.
fancy you. It's just too soon for me to get my head round all this. But... I appreciated the fact that you didn't let Ron force us into a discussion about sex before, and that you said we wouldn't have to do anything. I'm... I just need some time. But I'm not ruling it out in the future. Which, if I had been forced to discuss it when we were at the Leaky, I don't think I would have said. So... I'm babbling now. I'll shut up."
The knocking stopped, and a slightly different knocking took over. It still didn't seem like Harry, but since Draco had (he suddenly realised) accepted the fact that Harry would come back sooner rather than later, and Draco would probably let him in when he did, it didn't seem like such a big deal to consider opening the door to someone else. In fact –
"I tried making cupcakes a few weeks ago," said Draco. "I'd never done it before. They weren't very successful, though."
Draco flushed slightly, but grinned and went into the kitchen, returning with two bowls of soup and a plate of bread rolls.
to come and snuggle up against me was so reassuring that I never wanted to move him when he did, in case he didn't do it again. It's inconvenient at times, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I like the snuggling too much."
"Yes, really good, actually," said Harry. "Although this is the part I've been most looking forward to."
"Potter, I am impressed," said McGonagall. "And not just because I heard you correctly use the word 'exacerbated', startling though that was. I am impressed, and slightly embarrassed. I'm embarrassed because everything you said is not only very wise and sensible but also very obvious... yet you are the first person to make this suggestion, and it should have been
"Maybe it's a bit of both," Harry suggested. "You never know. Maybe it's also that a phoenix can sing? But in any case I'm glad you were finally happy enough to do a Patronus. Is that night still your happiest memory?"
He'd done very well so far that winter; the bitterly cold weather had arrived three weeks earlier, and although it hadn't actually snowed
"You know, I was quite surprised when I found there were wizarding communities all over the place," said Harry, remembering. "You wouldn’t believe how long I thought all wizards lived in either London, Hogsmeade, Godric’s Hollow or Ottery St Catchpole."
"Sorry. Maybe for a minute afterwards? I'm just really tired and I've got lots of work to do when I get back, so I'd be happy if this was over quickly."
He started to reconsider this thought twenty minutes later, when they were finally alone in the last room in the cloisters, next door to Seamus and Dean. Their trunks had all magically materialised in their rooms as they'd stepped inside, and McGonagall had left them all to unpack, stating that she'd see them at breakfast.
Harry had already lit a gas camping stove and was heating a pan of hot chocolate on it. "I think it tastes better this way," he said. "I haven't got any cream or anything, though – will you be OK with it as it is?"
"Yes, I'm very happy that I found Harry again, for more than one reason," Draco said, smiling at him.
“That was amazing, mate,” said Ron, who was also quite tearful. “I was only going to this thing tomorrow to be supportive, but I’m actually looking forward to it now, if it’s all going to be as good as that. And… I see it now. You and Harry, I mean.”
Draco glanced at Harry, and Harry squeezed his hand. "Don't worry," he said quietly. "I'll leave the talking to you."
said how you felt, but when it suddenly seemed as if you wanted to break the bond I started to think you were just being nice."
Harry was surprised when Ron and Hermione arrived home with Draco, but pleased when he found that they already knew all about his big news, and delighted to hear that they approved.
"I had nightmares for years about Dumbledore falling from there. It's not something I like to remember," said Harry. "Anyway, you
They clinked their wine glasses together, and then the only sounds to be heard were the sounds of eating.
"Why Wallington? Because I couldn't afford to live much closer to the city centre than this, and this flat suited me," said Draco. "Mainly because it's so near the station, yet relatively quiet. I realised quite early in my explorations that I wasn't often going to be able to Apparate, so transport links were important. And I moved in just before Christmas, 1998. Six months after the war ended."
"I didn't know you had a phone," Harry commented. He turned around to examine the darkening sky. "Wow, I see what you mean, those colours are incredible. And there's the moon. And… what's that, right on the south-western horizon? Is it a plane?"
"In a sec," said Draco. "Teddy and I were just talking about Patronuses, and I'd love to see his. If that's alright, Teddy?"
"It was Crabbe," said Draco tersely. "It would have been me, too, if you hadn't swooped in to save me. For which, thank you again, by the way."
Potter would never have suggested meeting me for a coffee. I wasn't at all sure that you'd turn up, I have to admit."
there. She was distraught the year you finally called things off with Ginny and then stayed away at Christmas."
"Listen, mate, I do get it – why you won't Apparate straight to or from here, I mean – but I still think you're mad. No-one will notice!"
"Oh my God," said Harry several minutes later, when he'd regained the power of speech. "That was the best thing I think I've ever felt."
of the cab, when they arrived, turned out to be a lot more difficult that getting her in: they hadn't thought, at the time, that the orderly was doing much, but things definitely went less smoothly without him. And that was before they realised that they had no wheelchair, so they'd have to more or less carry her into the house.
"You probably should, though," said Draco. "I am so sorry. It never even occurred to me that her torture of you would have lasting damage. I wish I
"Yes, yes, well done," said Draco breathlessly, following the direction of Harry's eyes. "But don't just sit there –
"Interesting," said Harry, as Lucius swept Narcissa into a final dip. "I could tell you liked that one better. You smiled all the way through, and it made your voice sound different. Better. Although it did sound brilliant in the last song too."
"I've never been to a concert," said Harry. "Maybe you could take me to one that you think I'd like?"
Draco had forgotten the recitals were all being filmed, but he’d already delighted himself with the idea of getting a Pensieve memory from Harry at some point. A professional recording would be even better, he realised. “Thank you so much,” he said. “If you really mean that, I’ll bring you one myself.”
"Blame Carole for that," said Hermione. "My new assistant," she went on, at Harry’s puzzled look. "She insisted on coming in last night to do it. I think it’s a bit much, but she was so keen that I didn’t have the heart to stop her. She was horrified when I told her I didn’t have time to decorate."
"Sorry," said Harry, looking as if he really was. "I'll try to convince them after you've gone. Can't promise I'll manage it, though. People seem to believe all sorts of ridiculous things where I'm concerned."
Harry stepped back and smiled at Ron, who stood up and cast his gaze over the audience before speaking. "I hated Draco Malfoy when I was at school with him," he said, "and I certainly didn't hold back when it came to telling people why that was. But Harry's right when he says that Draco is a different person these days. Draco himself will be the first to admit that he wasn't always very nice to know back then, so when he came back into our lives a year ago I was a bit dubious, and I bet some of you are too, especially as you know that Harry and Draco are a couple, and maybe some of you are wondering whether Draco has some sort of unnatural influence on Harry. But there are three facts I want to try and convince you of. The first is that there has always been a strong connection between these two, ever since they first met when we were all eleven, and even when they thought they hated each other. My wife Hermione predicted years ago that they'd end up together - long before they knew it themselves - and, although I didn't want to believe it at first, I could see what she meant."
He decided that patience and understanding was the best strategy; it certainly seemed to be working so far. With that in mind, he went back to his quarters (waving to Scorpius and Albus on his way out of the hall) and suggested to Harry that they spend the remaining hours before bedtime just reading. It was obvious from the overflowing bookshelves that Harry was a voracious reader, so Draco was confident that the idea would be welcomed; in any case, Draco really needed to finish reading through the DADA textbooks and Harry's lesson plans so that he could plan his own lessons for Monday.
"That seemed to go pretty well, I thought," said Draco to Harry during their tenth bow, shouting to be heard over the whistles and whoops of the audience. "It's a good thing we agreed there'd only be one encore, though, because I need to get your cock inside me
"I know, but there's been a change of plan," said Harry. "I need your help, Winky. I know you're good at keeping secrets."
"I can never understand people who say that," admitted the nurse. "I'd have as much as they'd give me, if it was me. But it's your decision. Just press the call button if you change your mind, OK?" She put the clipboard back at the end of the bed and bustled away.
17: posh foyer with many decorations (NB it's decades since I was last inside the Guildhall so I can't remember whether it has a foyer like this... but it might!)
Draco smiled at him as he held up his hand to stop the applause. "Right," said Harry. "Any questions?"
"I'd like to think so, but I obviously don't know Scorpius as well as I thought I did," said Draco. "I might find it hard to concentrate in that lesson, actually. I'll be trying too hard not to stare at them. I've seen them at meals since you told me about their relationship, of course, but tomorrow will be the first time I get to watch them close up and try and spot clues I've missed in the past. How could I not have known they're together?"
only been a week, hasn't it?" he mused. "That's incredible. Best week of my life, though." At this, Harry definitely felt another warm glow suffusing his body, but this time it was inside him. He took hold of Draco's hand under the table and squeezed it briefly.
Harry found himself blushing intensely as the song ended. "Do I?" he asked. "Or was it just a song?"
By the end of the performance, Harry was nearly bursting with pride, because it was fairly obvious that Draco was the audience's favourite, at least if the loud whooping was anything to go by. The other soloists had all been very good, to be fair, but Draco had been confident that singing from memory would make a big difference, and that certainly seemed to be the case. Privately, Harry thought that Draco's almost ethereal beauty was also part of the appeal, but he decided not to mention that to Draco, in case he gave the impression that his success was due to anything other than hard work and sheer talent.
"Ooh, how interesting," Harry said, handing Draco a mug of coffee and sitting down with his own. "I didn't know you were musical at all! Anything I'll have heard of?"
"No, he was surprisingly civil, actually – well, if you don't count the laughing at me and the refusing to believe a word I said, that is," said Draco. "I did write down the hospital details for him, so I'm sure he'll do something about it eventually, although it'll be a lot more complicated than if he'd just come with me. In the meantime, though, what do you want me to do? Is there anyone else who we could try? Someone who might actually believe me?"
you're going to ask what my reasons were, and I'm happy to answer, but could you please answer my first question before I do, so that we can get on with unpacking while we talk? Which bed d'you want?"
"And I still am," Harry reassured him. "But one reason for that is that I had a long talk with Draco yesterday, and he helped me to realise that I never get to do that with anyone else these days. I'm often
"If anyone's feet are going to smell, it'll be mine," Harry told him. "Smelly feet doesn't seem like a very Malfoy thing to have."
Draco raised his eyebrows, but it was Ron who said: "Interesting that it took this long before you asked about her, don't you think? Ginny's gone home. And we're upstairs in the Leaky Cauldron. She was here for a while, but she got a bit upset when she found she couldn't touch you. She was feeling a bit guilty about what she'd done – although she didn't really realise what a big deal it was until I used a sobering spell on her – but it only really sank in when she put her hand on your face and you screamed."
Trelawney considered this while Harry tried to keep the "what in Merlin's name is happening" expression off of his face.
Draco carefully pulled the bottle away and handed it to Rita. He shifted James to rest upright against his shoulder before carefully removing the blanket. James had little wings that were now covered in fluffy down feathers protruding from openings in his little green shirt. They didn't look particularly useful, but Harry and Draco adored the sight of them.
Lucius was staring at them with wide eyes and a red face. He coughed again, struggling to clear his airway.
Ron nodded, looking back to the parchment. Rita had listed names and locations for meeting places. Toward the bottom of the parchment, Rita had noted that the wizards had wanted to collect Harry and Draco for study, dead or alive.
“Of course I want you,” Harry said softly.  “Even when we were constantly fighting, you’ve always had my attention.  I just can’t take my eyes off of you.  And tonight you’ve been so sweet while trying to show how you feel about me.  It’s wonderful and I feel so lucky,” he added, tentatively reaching out and placing his hands on Draco’s waist.
Kreacher didn't leave them alone until Harry had finished eating his first scone. The elf had directed a pointed look at the second scone on Harry's plate and then disappeared with a pop.
Pansy folded her arms and proceeded to sulk.  Hermione just looked sheepish.  Clearly they’d been careless about when and where they’d discussed the matter.
Ron considered that for a moment. Draco and Harry had become good friends. They spent a lot of time together. There was all the odd touching that went on between them. It wasn't much of a stretch to think that such caring could develop into romantic feelings. "No, I see what you mean," Ron said. He smiled slightly. "They already take care of each other."
Narcissa's tears spilled over her cheeks. "I love my son, half-breed or otherwise," she insisted. "I'll make his father see reason." She paused, swiping at her tears and straightening her posture. "Does he need anything? What can I do? I'm sure I could arrange appropriate living quarters for him very quickly."
Draco nodded his acceptance, earning a loving kiss from Harry. He smiled into the kiss when he felt Harry's hands creep up his shirt to caress his abdomen.
"No," Draco argued. "I think you've been traumatized by the war and you're depressed. There's no shame in seeing a mind healer. The mind is part of the body, and it's capable of illness. But you can heal."
Draco stumbled upon landing but kept himself upright. He was immediately pulled into his mother's arms. "You could have broken your neck," she scolded.
Pansy was one of Draco's closest friends. So, naturally, when Draco was made Harry's auror partner, Pansy felt that she needed to be supportive. At first she suspected that Harry was going to sabotage or humilate Draco, but Harry had won her over with surprising ease. Draco had been shocked and a little annoyed about that.
"Draco, I think you should know that..." He trailed off, looking flustered. "I have almost no experience. We were in school and then there was the war... I went on a few dates, but nothing came of it. And, I've not really... wanted to..."
Draco clenched his jaw and then forced himself to relax. "We were warming our feathers," he said, waving one hand dismissively. "It felt nice, so we fell asleep."
Ron helpfully tugged the blanket aside to expose the blue shell to Draco. "Do you want it back?" he asked.
In Harry's bedroom, Harry was stroking Draco's feathers with one hand while his other hand pressed lightly against the middle of Draco's back, keeping the blond close. "Just relax," Harry said softly.
"I'm so sorry," Draco sniffled, mortified that he'd caused such a fuss. Most of the wedding guests were now looking curiously at him.
Harry climbed into the nest, drawing Draco into another kiss. He slid his hands down Draco's body, grateful that the blond had been so eager to get naked.
He had to admit that Draco wasn't so bad anymore. Draco was still a sarcastic, stuck-up prat, but he looked out for Harry in the field and his comments were more teasing than hateful. Ron would certainly never admit it out loud, but the former Slytherin had been a rather pleasant addition to their group of friends.
Their friends weren't surprised by their change in relationship status. They were amused by Harry's changed behavior. Before, he'd been a little confused and nervous, though accepting, of Draco's advances. Now Harry doted on Draco enthusiastically. Draco was treated to breakfast in bed, foot rubs, back massages and chocolates. Draco basked in Harry's adoration, happily returning the affection.
Grateful for Luna's weird diversion tactic, Harry turned around to face Draco. Draco shifted to offer his wings, and was rewarded with Harry's hands gliding over his feathers.
Harry was curious about his altered anatomy. But it didn't seem like the best time to get a look at himself. His fingers drifted over his lower abdomen slowly. And there it was. It did feel as if he simply had a second belly button.
Harry and Draco were sitting side by side on the couch, their feet propped up the the coffee table in front of them. "This isn't another soppy romance is it?" Draco asked.
"It's nice," Draco muttered, his eyes drifting closed. Harry nodded in agreement, closing his own eyes with a contented sigh.
"Everything alright?" Harry asked, stepping into the nursery with a full bottle of milk. He smiled, admiring the sight of his husband nuzzling their son and cooing quietly to soothe the infant's crying. It was a beautiful thing to behold and Harry was so grateful that this was his life now.
Draco watched in fascination. House elves didn't normally behave in such a way. He imagined that the behavior of this elf could only be explained by a concern for Harry's well-being. Draco looked Harry over again and winced. Clearly Harry want taking care of himself. Luckily he hasn't stopped showering.
Harry Potter had known from the beginning that being partnered with Draco Malfoy would cause chaos. But he never could've anticipated the madness that seemed to follow them relentlessly. Though, to be fair, their problems seemed to cause problems for the other Aurors just as often.
"Thank Merlin," Draco groaned as he felt Harry's cool, slippery fingers breach him. "I was afraid I'd have to beg."
Narcissa and Lucius watched over the sleeping family while Hermione left to get something to eat and change her clothes. "This just became very real," Lucius muttered quietly.
They turned and spotted Draco Malfoy kneeling on the floor of St. Mungo's pediatric ward. A little girl that appeared to be around four years old was clutching a new doll to her chest and smiling joyfully at Draco. She had long, dark brown hair that was hanging in loose curls down her back. Her clear blue eyes focused intently on Draco's face.
Hermione sighed and took a little sip from her wine glass.  Then her eyes widened in shock and she spewed the wine back out, making Tracy Davis yelp and leap away with a scowl.
"I want to," Harry insisted. "You know that I love you. Our baby will be here soon. The only thing that would make me happier is for you to be my husband." Harry turned to face Draco, ignoring the others in the room. "Draco, will you-"
"Stay calm," Harry said, reaching out and grasping Draco's shoulders. "We're alive. That's a good thing. Just try to relax."
"What?" Harry cried in alarm, is wooden spoon clattering to the floor and splattering tomato sauce across the tile.
For a moment, neither of them spoke or moved.  And then, Draco seized the front of Harry’s robes and pulled him into a searing kiss.  Harry responded eagerly, wrapping one arm around Draco’s lower back while his other hand was lifted to run his fingers through pale blond hair.
"Come on Ron," Harry chided. "You can do better than that. We know that something is going on between you and Pansy. She looks at you like she plan to have you for dessert."
Narcissa patted her husband's knee. "We can't stop life from being hard," she said. "We can only be loving and supportive. Draco and Harry will be wonderful parents and their child is already adored."
Draco rolled his eyes at her. "I'm well enough," he amended. "I was... overwhelmed. And I'm not accustomed to..." He trailed off, wringing his hands together. He had no idea how to phrase it without sounding ridiculous. To anyone else, it would sound odd.
As much as Draco enjoyed having his feathers preened and stroked, he wanted a task at that moment. It didn't require a great deal of thought, but caring for Harry's wings was soothing in a way. His fingers slid between feathers and stroked downward, straightening any that had been ruffled. He moved slowly, gently soothing itchy spots and easing the tension out of Harry's body.
The moment was broken by all the annoying cheering.  Harry pulled away and whirled around to face the rest of the party guests.  “Do you mind?” he shouted incredulously.
Ron nodded slowly, eyeing Draco thoughtfully. "We're happy for you," he said after a moment of consideration.
Harry carefully placed the egg in the smaller nest and covered it. He straightened up and held one hand out to Draco with a loving smile. "Would you dance with me?" he asked shyly.
Draco carefully placed Harry in his best of people pillows and covered him with a blanket. On impulse, he brushed a soft kiss on Harry's forehead before slipping out of the room.
Ron bid his partner a good night and then apparated away. He arrived in Harry's living room and made his way to the kitchen, following the scent of garlic. He quickly found himself at wand point.
Draco set down his teacup and stood up to stretch his wings. Perhaps a short flight and a kip in the sun would be nice. It would certainly improve his mood before his parents came over for dinner.
"I think Harry's right," Ron said abruptly. He moved closer to hesitantly pat Draco's shoulder. "You'll be no good to anyone like this. Better for you to be relaxed and safe at home." Ron turned to Harry. "I'll come round later and we'll strengthen the wards. Nobody will get into that house."
"I'm sorry," Ron said earnestly. "I didn't think of it that way and I feel bad that I upset you." He could see Ginny and Hermione nodding their approval.
For a moment, they just looked at each other. Then Harry scooted closer, draping one arm to rest his hand on Draco's lower back. Draco nuzzled into Harry's neck, sighing softly. They didn't speak. They didn't move. The movie was completely ignored as they drifted to sleep, snuggled together.
"I have to be going," Hermione responded. "But I'll come round tomorrow." She departed with a little wave.
Harry whimpered and shifted away from Ron's hands. Tears filled his eyes and his lip wobbled with the threat of heart breaking sobs. Ron withdrew slightly, frowning in concern. If Harry was two years old, he would have memories of being under the care of the Dursleys. Had they mistreated him so early in life? After a moment, Ron decided that he wasn't particularly surprised. He should have guessed that their depravity wouldn't draw the line at a baby.
"At night, the sky get darker and little glowing stars appear," Harry explained, running one finger across the pale blue of the painted sky. "I thought I'd keep the theme gender neutral. Seemed like a good idea."
"Of course it had to be Harry and Malfoy," Ron grumbled, shaking his head at the two year olds at his feet.
Harry sighed. "Draco, I'm terrified," he admitted, folding his arms over his chest. "Some lunatics made us half bird and we don't know why. We've changed in ways that we don't fully understand and we may never be fully human again. We haven't had much time to fully appreciate what that could mean. The life I chose for myself has been taken from me." He paused, looking away. "You make me feel better."
"I could kill the Dursleys," Ron said, careful to keep the harshness out of his tone. "How can someone neglect him? Look at him!" he demanded, gazing at the little boy in his arms. Harry stuck his little tongue out to give the biscuit a lick before nibbling on it.
Harry nodded. "But it's even better than you think," he informed her. "I'll give you an exclusive on a very big story."
"Popcorn," Ginny announced, levitating several bowls of popcorn into the room. The bowls were eagerly snagged from the air as everyone was selecting a seat.
Ron felt his breath stutter and his heart pound in his chest. He and Kingsley had apparated to a spot just outside of Harry's wards. They wanted to catch the wizards before they'd gotten through Harry's wards. The problem was, the wards were already down. "No," Ron breathed, horror clawing at him and threatening to suffocate him.
It wasn't until after they'd had a late breakfast that Draco announced that it was time. The announcement came in the form of a sharp cry of mingled pain and fear.
"Are you still feeling up to this?" Harry asked breathlessly. He moaned loudly when Draco slowly slid down onto his cock.
Harry sighed happily. No relationship was a guarantee, but he had a good feeling about this one. They'd been building up a lasting friendship and Draco was worth the risk.
Draco turned to his parents and was pleased to see his mother's smile. But his father's expression was unreadable.
They stepped out into the hallway together and made their way toward the head auror's office. They hadn't made it very far before Ron was calling out to them. "I was watching for you two," he explained, eyeing them critically. "You both look ill."
Draco groaned quietly as he twirled Pansy across the dance floor.  “This is a disaster,” he said quietly.  “What was I thinking?”
Harry nodded in understanding. Molly and Narcissa had assured them that they'd stop feeling horrifically guilty ever time their son so much as whimpered. But so far, Draco and Harry were struggling.
"I'm so sorry," Ron said softly, his voice breaking. "I never thought... I had no idea that he'd do something like this."
"Well, tone it down a bit," Draco chuckled, lifting his head to look at Harry. "I don't want my eyes to be red and puffy. Mother will make a fuss."
The day had been long and frustrating. Grant had greeted Ron cheerfully, as always. He'd casually asked how Draco and Harry were. He'd innocently asked if the tea made Draco feel better. And Ron had smiled and assured him that Draco and Harry had both enjoyed the tea. Then Ron frowned slightly saying that the couple had gotten sick shortly after their dinner, speculating that perhaps the food at dinner hadn't agreed with them. Grant, the bastard, had simpered and expressed regret that they were feeling poorly. Suddenly Ron felt that perhaps he understood why some muggle murders preferred to stab their victims. Being forced to chat with Grant was making Ron feel a bit... stabby.
"That's just to make you feel better," Ron said, relieved when Draco bit into a chip. "Dinner will be healthier."
Harry smiled. "You get the information we need for us, without sharing it with anyone else," he said firmly. "I'll even acknowledge your assistance on the case. And you will publish only what I allow for the interview. If you lie, embellish or turn on me in any way, I'll destroy you. Professionally. Personally. Publicly," he stated calmly.
"I know!" Pansy gushed gleefully. "I could just die. "I popped over to his house a few days ago and caught them shagging each other silly." Ron shuddered.
When they finally sat down for dinner, Draco bit his his lip and reluctantly summoned the miniature nest from the living room. Harry placed the nest on the empty chair next to Draco, smiling in encouragement. Draco hesitantly set the egg in the nest, and wrapped the warming blanket around it. He sat down in his own chair, biting his lower lip and looking like he'd like nothing better than to scoop the egg back up. "Why is this so hard?" he asked softly.
Draco pulled off, looking up at Harry with a heated gaze. "Touch me," Draco commanded before swallowing Harry's cock again with a loud groan.
Ron nodded sullenly. He could do this. He had to do this. It would only be a matter of time before he'd get the case closed. He had to believe that. He bid Kingsley a good night and left the Ministry in a hurry.
Harry marched across the lawn, a warm breeze ruffling his feathers. He felt the comforting hum of magic from the wards as he approached the boundary. He stopped, looking around and listening until he heard rustling from a bush the sat just outside the wards.
Draco swallowed hard, his eyes threatening to flood their nest. It was mad to suddenly get married like that. Complete madness. But, he loved Harry so much. Draco had never wanted anyone as much as he wanted Harry. And they had no idea when their egg would hatch, but it would be nice to be married before that time.
"I believe I'd like to be inside to again," Draco said playfully, holding their egg in one arm while his other arm tugged Harry closer.
Harry nodded and then watched as Draco hurried away to answer the door. He could hear lowered voices and then a few moments later, Draco returned with his parents, Blaise and Pansy. Pansy walked right up to Harry and gave him a quick hug.
"Just because your father brought it up in such a tacky manner doesn't mean it's not a good idea," Harry said, flapping his hand at Lucius when the man sputtered indignantly.
Ron looked between them uncomfortably. "Davis and Harper said that you two needed me for a case," he said. "I suppose that was just an excuse to get me to come in here and catch you two being stupid." He paused, smirking at Harry. "So... Any particular reason you were stroking Malfoy's nipples?" Ron asked.
Hermione came in half an hour later, dusting herself off and shooting Draco a bright smile. "How are you feeling?" she asked him kindly.
At first, they only had eyes for each other. And then they realized that several couples had been inspired and were now dancing. Draco's heart fluttered when Harry laughed again.
"I'll do it," Draco declined. "I'd like to be the one to settle him after making him cry. I feel terrible," he admitted quietly.
Draco took the news rather badly. He had gone rather pale and needed to sit down. Harry resisted the urge to take the blond into his arms. Kingsley and Robards were there in the office and they needed to be professional. It was so hard though.
Draco truly enjoyed their movie nights. Ron's whining aside, he'd been made to feel welcome. Pansy and Blaise were treated kindly as well. Draco felt comfortable enough to relax and laugh with the others. It made him wish that things had been different when they'd been in school.
"It's not an illness, Weasley," Draco said impatiently. "We're not sick. We're not completely human any more."
Rita stood up, her eyes wide with shock. She approached Draco slowly, trying to appear as non-threatening as possible. She spotted the dark hair first. And then the baby's eyes opened and she could see the bluish gray of his irises as he continued to drink from the bottle. "A perfectly beautiful baby," she noted, her voice hushed in her amazement.
Draco stepped away from Harry to embrace his mother. She hugged him gently, carefully avoiding his wings. "I know you must be terrified," she said softly. "It'll all be alright." She released him to look him over, smiling slightly at the slight protrusion of his stomach.
Harry sighed in relief as everyone began leaving. Only Ron remained, carrying the gifts upstairs and setting them neatly in the nursery. When he was done, he came back downstairs to see Draco standing with his hands pressed against the wall. Harry was standing behind him, rubbing his lower back with an anxious expression.
"Are you feeling better?" Harry asked softly, sliding his hand from Draco's stomach around to his lower back.
"Kingsley won't be happy," Draco added. He gave Harry a searching look. "Maybe we need to help with this. Ron doesn't have a partner."
Hermione peered at him, as if expecting another bout of hysteria. When she seemed assured of Harry's composure she went on. "Our examination revealed the development of an egg," she explained. "The problem is, your body and magic are adapting to a process that human males aren't capable of. And human embryos take much longer to develop the bird embryos."
Ron heaved a sigh of relief as he finished up the report he was working on and set it aside. It had been a long day and he was looking forward to leaving.
Harry moved past her to find Draco pacing in agitation. His movements were jerky, as if he was unsteady on his feet. Harry's bedding was in disarray as Draco had evidently been struggling to rearrange it.
"You've played your part well," Kingsley said soothingly. "Just remember that you're going to get him for this. We'll use him to get as much information as we can and then he'll be headed to Azkaban."
Ron smiled as watched the two little boys together. It was hard to believe that they'd been such bitter rivals in school. Little Draco was probably quite spoilt, but he seemed to have a sweet enough disposition. Adult Draco was rather less pleasant in Ron's opinion.
"Yesterday you said whatever I need," Harry reminded him. Draco's answering smile made Harry's heart flutter.
"Please," Ron scoffed. "I've got news for you mate. It's everybody's baby," he said waving his hand to indicate everyone at the table.
"But to mutilate their own bloodline," Ron muttered, disgusted. He sighed and pushed away from the table. "This may be enough. You've been a big help," he said.
Harry and Draco didn't return to the aurors. After all that had happened, they were content to set that part of their lives behind. Their son was precious to them and they didn't want to miss a moment him.
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Hermione replied with a little shrug.  “Harry isn’t always particularly self-aware.  And he and Malfoy get along now.”
Harry didn't sound suspicious. He merely sounded curious. Draco smiled. "I actually enjoy it," he said lightly. He peered at Harry for a moment. "I'd like for you to come help me tomorrow."
Harry set his spoon down on his plate with a contented sigh.  “I don’t dance,” he said, looking around at the other party guests.
Draco was past denying his feelings toward Harry. Even Ron was giving him obnoxiously knowing looks. What had started as a somewhat surprising physical attraction, had turned into an admiration for everything that Harry was. Draco had fancied Harry from afar and allowed Harry's giving nature to inspire him. Spending so much time with Harry in the weeks before Christmas had made Draco's fondness flourish. Draco ached with it.
It was a bit silly to worry about that though. Draco had other lovers in the past, and they were completely irrelevant now. Harry was what mattered. Harry and the life that they'd stumbled into.
The only truly awkward moment came when Molly wanted to hold the egg. She'd reached toward Ron for it and Ron instantly shifted away as Draco let out a trill of sudden panic. Molly raised her hands in a show of surrender, her eyes wide.
Harry shook his head, gently rocking James in his arms. "At least it's over," he said quietly. "Now we can all move on." He looked up when an owl tapped at the kitchen window.
Harry's face suddenly seemed to crumble into a mask off grief. He buried his face in his hands, overwhelmed. Ron and Hermione stared at him in shock. They hadn't seen Harry break down like this before. Had he been carrying such a burden of sorrow all this time?
Harry climbed into the nest behind Draco. He reached for Draco's trembling wings, running his fingers over the feathers carefully. Hermione game him a quick encouaging nod before her eyes returned to Draco.
Ron shook himself out of his thoughts when he saw Hermione walking toward him. She looked pale and a bit shaken. "Are they alright?" Ron asked frantically.
"Absolutely," Ron agreed. "You've got to be in top form for this one," he added, nodding at the egg in his arms. "Tomorrow I'll bring eggrolls, lo mein... Make me a list and I'll bring whatever you like. If you want to invite or friends and make it a party, we can do that too."
It was lucky that they'd grown to enjoy working together. The numerous bizarre situations they found themselves would have driven Draco to request a different partner otherwise.
The aurors used disillusionment spells on themselves and began to move to surround the dark wizards. It was fewer aurors than Ron was comfortable with, but they'd had few options. Grant had a lot of friends in the DMLE, and Ron couldn't risk betrayal.
Grant's dark eyes scanned the yard, drifting right past Harry and Ron who were safely hidden behind the invisible wall of magic. He growled in frustration, turning to face away from the house and looking around. Then he turned back and pointed his wand, muttering an incantation.
Harry nearly laughed but he stopped himself. "It'll be fine, darling," he said, squeezing his love's hand tenderly.
"If it's not, than I'll still be perfectly happy," Harry said softly. "This baby will be just as loved as James and Scorpius, regardless."
Draco hadn't been certain before, but his stomach had appeared distinctly more rounded that morning. The idea was a bit unnerving, but still exciting. They were going to be announcing the good news to Draco's mother at dinner that evening. They'd decided that she could give Lucius the news herself. It wouldn't go well if Malfoy Senior made a nasty comment.
Draco was approaching Harry and carrying two wine glasses.  “Would you like some elf-made wine?” Draco asked.
"Yes mum," Ron joked. "Now hurry up and hatch the baby." He gave a cheerful wave and apparated away.
Hermione was weeping silently while Ron's mouth hung open in shock. Harry had been numb with shock through Draco's speech. When Draco turned to face the window again, Harry shook himself out of his stupor. His given name from Draco's lips had stirred a faint flutter in his chest. Ignoring Ron and Hermione for the moment, he approached Draco.
There was a sharp knock on the door before it was thrown open. In stepped Hermione Granger, looking flustered. "How are they?" she asked.
The suggestion seemed to cheer Ron up a bit. He nodded and watched as Harry ate his biscuit and made soft humming noises in approval of the sweetness. Ron glanced over to Draco to see the blond smacking his lips and eyeing Harry's biscuit. Ron wasn't fond of Malfoy, but he wouldn't be mean to a toddler. "Do want a biscuit Malfoy?" he asked.
Draco smiled, squeezing Harry's hands. "I won't be needing the other bedroom," he said. "It can be a guest room." He laughed at Harry's excited grin.
"I'm alright darling," Draco said with a watery laugh. "I just have the sweetest little boys on the world." More tears threatened as James hugged Draco's neck.
Harry drank the potion without complaint. After a few moments, he sat up and stretched his wings. "I expect you to rest for a few days," Hermione said sternly.
Sensing Harry's movement, Draco turned to face him. "I didn't think you'd have feelings for me," Harry said quietly.
Draco had been out with a few different wizards recently, but he hadn't been interested in pursuing any of them further. As far as Pansy knew, Harry was single and had been for some time. She imagined that he had concerns about people wanting to be with him for his fame and accomplishments.
Draco frowned. "Yes, but maybe he didn't expect that to happen right away," he argued. "I have no idea how much of the toxins are in the tea. Perhaps his plan had been to make us ill and then overpower us. Maybe he was trying to kill us slowly." He chewed his lower lip thoughtfully. "He's no potions master. That is a fact."
"If you are happy Draco, then you have my blessing to pursue this," Lucius said somberly. Narcissa slipped her hand into his with a pleased smile.
Draco froze at the sight of their living room. The furniture had been removed and replaced with simple white chairs. In place of the telly was a white arch covered in ivy and fairy lights. There were flowers everywhere. Their friends, the Weasleys and Draco's parents were all sitting in chairs while Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt stood under the arch.
"Frustrating," Ron said with a sigh. "I wanted to strangle Grant every time he spoke to me. But, I'm completely certain that there's no Imperius curse at work. I'm slightly less certain about whether or not he is working with those other wizards, but there's not much doubt. Kingsley said that he and Robards agree with me."
Of course, Harry seemed to be oblivious to Draco’s feelings and carried on as if he and Draco were best mates. The ex-Gryffindor blithely joked and laughed as if Draco wasn’t pining away like an idiot.
Harry waved her off with a tired smile, not wanting her to fuss over him. After a moment, she nodded and kissed his forehead, bidding the others to have a good afternoon. Pansy left soon after, apparently convinced that they wouldn't do anything life-threatening for the rest of the day. Ron returned to his own office, casting an oddly wistful look at Harry over his shoulder as he went.
Pansy frowned. "How can that be?" she asked. "We still hear about all the wonderful things that Potter does all the time." Draco nodded his agreement.
"We found another ritual site," Ron said, entering the office and dropping into a chair near Harry's desk.
"You don't even know what your potion actually does," Draco snapped. "Well, I'm certainly not going to satisfy your curiosity. I think rotting in Azkaban is too good for you."
"I'm a little afraid they might flirt themselves to death before anything fun happens," Ginny whispered, shamelessly inserting herself into the conversation.
"Don't be silly," Hermione snapped. She waved a hand toward the door and led the way out of the shop. She cast a quick charm to ensure their privacy before she spoke again. "Harry's had a really difficult time since the war."
A medi-witch ushered the children away, allowing Draco to get to his feet and dust himself off. When he turned, he spotted Hermione and Ron. His posture became more rigid but he forced himself to approach them. "Granger. Weasley," he greeted them shortly.
Narcissa smiled at Draco's embarrassed flush and Harry's expression of awe. "Even I didn't aware that my son could have such a giving heart," she commented. "I was aware that he was rather... fond of you," she told Harry, ignoring Draco's squeak of protest. "But I hadn't anticipated the effect you had on him. When we all asked why he was spending so much time and effort he said something that I'll never forget."
"Harry copes differently," Pansy replied with a shrug. "It's been really hard for him as well, but he's not faced rejection from those that he considers family. And I think it helps him to care for Draco."
Draco drew in a shuddering breath. He opened his mouth, but couldn't being himself to actually speak. Green patted his shoulder and stood up.
"Why would you not want to shag each other senseless?" Pansy hissed, glancing over her shoulder to make sure they weren't overheard.
Hermione giggled, hugging Draco again. "Draco Malfoy-Potter," she said, knowing that he adored the name, "we love you. And we love Harry and the boys. I'm so excited for you. You've only made today even better."
The restaurant staff were polite and efficient. A few got caught staring at the gray and white feathers, but they had the grace to flush with embarrassment and look away.
Hermione stared at the couch thoughtfully. "Let me think on that one," she said slowly. "I'll come up with something. Are there any other problems or concerns?" When they shook their heads she cast a few diagnostic spells over each of them. She declared them both healthy and left, promising to see them the next day.
Ron swallowed hard. Grant should have been there. What was he doing instead? "Question them," Ron demanded.
"No, Pansy told them," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "But, no matter. It's far less anonymous than it was, since I visit the hospital personally."
Draco stirred and his eyes fluttered open. He offered Harry a sleepy smile, but the smile fell when he saw Harry's face. "Did you have a nightmare?" he asked.
Unfortunately, it resulted in a great deal of letters from people the two men hardly knew. And their lack of appearance in public had driven the gossip-mongers spin increasingly wild tales. One theory was that the pair had become more bird than human and had flown off to roost in the Amazon. Draco had laughed a great deal over that one.
"What would be awful is more people dying," Harry countered. "I want our child to be safe. If I can ensure that with a little manipulation, I'll do it. Please Draco," he added quietly.
Harry scowled at him. "Don't be a prat," he retorted impatiently. He grabbed Draco's hand and placed it on Draco's abdomen, guiding his fingers. "Right there," Harry said. "Just a new opening. Nothing to panic about. It's probably mostly useless to us. We still have... you know, human parts."
"They said that we were testing it," Harry remembered suddenly. "We were test subjects." Hermione pursed her lips in disapproval.
"When the time comes, I'm not leaving your side," Harry said firmly. "I'll need someone to get Hermione. And..." He shifted his weight from foot to foot. "I'm having trouble staying calm. I need to be strong for you, and having my best mate here might help."
It took trial and error to figure out how to propel themselves forward or turn. But the practiced eagerly, laughing and joking all the while. They were both very tired, but neither was wanted to go inside yet. The darkening clouds appeared to determined to chase them indoors though.
"I think we're done for the day," Draco said suddenly, his face even more pale than usual. "I have no intention of vomiting in this office."
"A bit," Draco admitted, smirking at their surprised expressions. "I visit the children periodically, especially right before Christmas."
Once the cake had been eaten, Draco sat down to open the gifts. He was stunned by the level of enthusiasm that was displayed. He opened several packages of baby socks and gender neutral rompers. There were baby blankets and teddy bears and other little toys.
"We don't have time to get him to the hospital," Hermione said, swallowing down her urge to cry. "Just get him lying down.
"Don't be ridiculous Ron," Hermione grumbled, brushing past him and sitting on the couch. "Why would they perform a mating ritual with us in the next room?"
After a few moments, Harry drew back with pink cheeks and a nervous smile. Pansy cooed at them. "You're so cute together that I can't stand it," she declared.
Harry worked silently, carefully smoothing the beautiful feathers down. Hermione had thoughtfully provided them with a good number of shirts made from special fabric; It opened in the back for the wings and then closed again, leaving two holes for the wings to protrude.
Harry smiled and deftly swapped babies with Draco, Tom going to Draco eagerly and snuggling into his neck. Daniel yawned and stuck his thumb in his mouth before resting his head on Harry's shoulder. Their friends and family looked on, marveling at the expression of contentment and love that shone on Harry's face.
Harry lurched forward and caught Draco in his arms. "Where's Hermione?" he demanded urgently, turning to look at his friends.
Draco glanced at Harry again, the brunette engrossed in the love story. Draco could make that real for Harry. He wanted to. He felt like an idiot for not seeing the potential for more than friendship sooner. There was always the chance that Harry wouldn't want more, but... Best not think about that. The important thing was that Draco had feelings for Harry, and Draco wanted to give him the romance he deserved.
Harry blinked in surprise. For a moment, he'd thought that he would have to explain Draco's presence and possibly disarm Ron to prevent hexes. But, there's only been mild surprise and calm acceptance. After a moment of thought, Harry scowled. "This was a set up," he snapped, glaring at Ron and Hermione, then at Draco.
Ron left to make some floo calls while Hermione began casting spells to clean up the nest. Draco remained perfectly still, starting at the egg while Harry's adoring gaze shifted between the egg and Draco.
In the living room, Draco lifted his shirt and rolled down the elastic band of his trousers while Harry held his chips. The skin of Draco's abdomen was smooth and unblemished thanks to the salves he'd been using, but it looked tight. His cloaca was slightly puffy while his navel had gone completely flat.
"So you lot didn't have a chat about me?" Harry demanded. As expected, Hermione's expression became guilty. "I should have known," he groaned. He turned to Draco. "You can go," Harry said sharply.
“Thank you,” Pansy replied sweetly, enjoying Ron’s discomfort.  “Draco and I worked so hard on this and I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”
Draco could have kicked himself for getting caught staring. "I'm fine. Just thinking," he responded turning back to the telly.
It was Christmas Eve, and Draco was terribly disappointed to see Harry curled up on his couch looking melancholy. The last few days had been encouraging. Harry had smiled a little more. He'd relaxed around Draco a little more. When they sat next to each other, he even leaned against Draco sometimes. It had filled Draco with warmth and gave him the most peculiar urge to press kisses all over Harry's face.
Draco was all charm during the meal. He talked and laughed between between bites, seeming perfectly at ease. It made Harry wonder if being in the house with Harry so much made the blond unhappy. They were friends of course, but Draco had a life outside of Harry. Had Harry been selfishly keeping Draco to himself. He hadn't intended to.
Harry and Draco seemed to be oblivious to their friends until they'd had their fill of cake. The bill was paid and Draco declared that they needed to all go out together more often. And then he was pulling Harry close and apparating them back to the house.
"They're in the waiting room," Ron replied. "Nobody wants to leave until they know that Malfoy is alright. But, I had a feeling that Hermione would kick you out, so I came to sit with you."
Draco chuckled softly taking Harry's hand and allowing himself to be pulled close. They swayed and twirled, carefully keeping to the center of the room. It wouldn't do to spoil the mood by catching their wings on fire with the candles.
"I'm so happy for you," Ginny said, smiling widely. "You seem like an amazing couple. Who would have thought?" she giggled.
"Brilliant actually," Harry responded, stetching languidly. "I just had this strange sort of... urge to make this. So I did and it's amazing how much better I felt."
Ron relented with a terse nod. "What are you doing here anyway," he asked. "Enjoy getting knocked about by the little ones?"
“Pansy, whining is undignified,” Draco admonished, approaching the group with a small plate of treacle tart in one hand.
"Are we all jumping into Pansy and Ron's conversation now?" Blaise asked, smirking at Pansy's annoyed expression. Hermione coughed lightly to hide a laugh.
“Bloody hell!” Hermione exclaimed loudly in exasperation, drawing some shocked looks from people nearby.  “He was right under the mistletoe.”
"I love you Harry Potter," Draco breathed against Harry's lips. Harry responded with another loving kiss.
"Almost," Hermione corrected, holding up another vial of potion. She looked shaken but she hadn't shed a single tear. "Drink this and you should be able to sit up properly."
"Pansy!" Draco growled. "It's not... I mean..." he floundered to explain himself while Hermione stared at him with raised eyebrows and Ron smirked. Draco glared at Pansy. "I hate you. I hate you so much right now."
"Wonderful," Draco said cheerfully. Harry found himself thinking that cheerful Draco wasn't so bad to listen to. "I'll see you tomorrow." Just before closing the front door, Draco offered Harry another slight smile. "It was really nice to see you Potter."
"Of course we did," Draco told her, sitting down in a chair next to her bed. "We even brought my mother and father to visit."
"Then we'll be ready for them," Harry said firmly, reaching out and cradling Draco's face. "We'll take care of each other like we always do."
Draco pressed at the egg carefully, watching it give and crack a bit more. Harry reached over and slid his fingers along one crack until he found a spot loose enough to slip one finger inside. He tugged a bit, pulling some of the shell loose. Now that there was a little hole, Draco began opening the shell in earnest. He gave a little cry and reached into the egg.
“And Christmas is a time for… happiness or something,” Pansy added, waving her wine glass through the air vaguely, causing the liquid to slosh about.  “I’m grateful that Draco decided to do something about his feelings.  I’m bloody sick of hearing about it.”
Draco shook his head. "No. It's best if I stay busy," he decided. "I can't think about this right now." Draco opened a file on his desk, glaring down at the parchment inside. He forced himself to ignore Harry's agitated pacing.
Draco nodded his thanks. This was just awkward and he really wanted to leave. Of course, Pansy had other ideas.
Narcissa smiled and kissed Draco's forehead. "You take care of each other, and we'll speak soon," she said. She left through the floo in a swirl of green flames.
"I believe he was preparing tea," Harry said lightly. "One moment." He slipped out of the room silently.
Draco gave him look that Harry couldn't really identify. "She's one of those that needs a little more than gifts can provide," Draco said quietly. Then he turned and knocked on the door, pushing it open when a voice called out to come in.
Harry glanced at Draco. "Draco's staying here for now. As long as he wants," he added firmly. "Hermione's helping us find suitable furniture. We might need a bit of help once we start going out in public again."
Hermione gave a little shriek, not expecting to find someone standing in her office. She felt no relief when she realized it was Harry carrying Draco. She drug them across the hall to an exam room while Harry rattled off the details of the last few days.
"Now that's impressive," Pansy said, looping her arm through Draco's and leading him back to the dining room.
Harry nodded, giving her a final squeeze and releasing her. He glanced at Draco awkwardly and then returned to his chair. Draco slowly sat down as well, unsure of what to expect. Harry cleared his throat. "So what brings you by?" he asked Ron.
Draco smiled and tilted his head back to kiss Harry lovingly. It had been a year since they'd become a family while sitting on a hospital bed at St. Mungo's. The official adoption had occurred several weeks later, but their hearts had opened up overflowed with love for those children in that moment. For Harry and Draco, that was the day they had become parents. It hadn't mattered that their relationship was new. The love they felt was real and so right.
"The baby isn't the only reason," Harry insisted. "You've been here for a few months, but... I want it to be official. I want you to make this your home, permanently."
Draco gave the strange object a dubious look but didn't comment. He finished setting the dining room table as Harry levitated the food into the dining room.
"Not yet," Harry said, turning in Draco's hold to face Hermione. "I spoke with Robards and Kingsley. They've been trying to locate the grandparents and Maddie's aunt."
Harry cupped Draco's jawline and pulled him into a soft sweet kiss. And then another. And then his tongue was brushing against Draco's.
Below them, Ron grinned and shook his head. "James, what are we going to do with your daddies?" he asked, smiling as the baby blinked up at him. "You're going to end up with as many siblings as I have unless those two can figure out how to keep their hands off each other."
Draco's jaw went slack momentarily. It was always a bit surprising for Ron to compliment him. And Ron generally wouldn't comment on his appearance, especially since Harry was already very generous in his praise of Draco's looks.
Pansy rolled her eyes again. "I fail to see how this makes me a tart," she drawled. "Just answer the question."
Aside from a very heated snogging season, they'd only cuddled in bed. Harry sighed softly and stroked the soft blond hair, tangled with sleep. Draco hummed quietly with pleasure and snuggled closer.
It was Maddie's joyful tears that decided the grandmother. She was a bit wary of the elder Malfoys, but she'd been told about Draco by the hospital staff. And the way the two men were gazing at the three children was touching.
"Absolutely," Harry chuckled. "It would have been a shame to get rid of all this. But we all agreed to accept your decision when the time came."
"Harry we-" Hermione cut herself when she realized that Harry was having lunch with Draco. "Hello Malfoy."
Ron snorted. "Wouldn't want anyone to think he has a heart," he muttered, yelping when Hermione elbowed him hard.
As Harry blacked out, he was certain that he'd heard a shouted disarming spell. Ron and Grant had arrived.
Draco nodded, wondering how much Pansy had blurted out. "I only had time to see the pediatric ward yesterday. St. Mungos is a big place," he commented.
But now, his plans had been changed. It may not have been his choice, but he didn't regret it. He couldn't. Suddenly, Draco couldn't imagine having a child with anyone else. He was looking forward to holding his baby. He was still annoyed that his gender had been tampered with, but he could live with it.
"Bloody hell," Ron whispered, stopping next to Harry right as Robert Grant stepped around the bush, his eyes locked on the house.
"Fat," Draco admitted, standing up. He ran one hand over his stomach, biting his lip. "Can you see it?"
Then, gifts were being placed at their feet. A peek at the labels would show that they were from families and individuals that they'd helped. There was nothing extravagant, but they were grateful and humbled. Kingsley then awarded each of them with an Order of Merlin, Second Class, for their contributions to society.
Draco nodded, though he didn't look much calmer. Ron thought he looked a bit ill. "Maybe you should go home," Ron suggested.
Harry reached down and grasped Draco's erection with one hand, stroking him in long slow strokes. His other hand rested in Draco's hair, gently massaging his lover's scalp with his fingertips. He was so turned on and Draco seemed to be feeling rather restless.
Kingsley stared at Harry and Draco with an unreadable expression. It was his first time to see the wings for himself. Robards had seen them just after their release from the hospital and the man hadn't been exaggerating. Their wings were lovely to behold. As for the men themselves...
"Don't be stupid. Of course she'd consent," Draco snorted. "We're lucky she hasn't molested you in front of everyone. Not that she's whorish or anything," Draco added, catching Ron's expression of consternation.
"I'm your friend," Draco went on, keeping his gaze locked on Harry. "We've spent a lot of time together. We eat together often. I keep you company. I sit with you when you're upset. We even fall asleep on your couch together from time to time. My mother and Pansy are complaining about not seeing me enough."
Draco watched as Ron nodded and shifted away.  He didn’t think he’d ever felt so content.  Harry’s loving gaze warmed his heart and the acceptance of Harry’s best friend had been more gratifying than Draco had thought possible.
Harry didn't recognize the voice of the woman that had shouted his name. And he had no interest in lingering in Diagon Alley to find out who it was. Draco's wings were already fluttering in agitation.
"You want me?" Maddie asked softly. Her step-father had some a good job of making sure she feels unwanted.
Hermione nodded sympathetically. "Well, we won't keep you," she said getting up and moving to embrace Harry. She pulled back to look at him. "Do you think you're up for Christmas at the Burrow?"
"Busy becoming a hermit" probably would have been a more accurate phrase but Draco couldn't say that. The fact that Hermione and Ron and blurted out their concerns would probably upset Harry a great deal. There was already such deep sorrow in those green eyes.
Draco smiled slightly, willing his racing heart to calm. "Would you like to look at it?" he offered shakily.
Draco passed the egg to Ron and gently gathered Harry into his arms. "Don't ever do that to me again," Draco sobbed. He sighed as he felt Harry hug him weakly.
“Look who’s talking,” Harry retorted with a laugh.  Draco opened his mouth to object but closed it again when Harry gave him a pointed look.  “I overheard Pansy and Hermione talking about the party and… me,” Harry admitted.
"Hard to imagine that the savior of the wizarding world came from such humble beginnings," Pansy murmured, handing each of the boys another biscuit. "That someone so important and powerful was neglected and despised by his own family. Harry's a good boy," she added sweetly, pleased that it made Harry grin at her.
Maddie waved shyly to Lucius and Narcissa. Lucius nodded politely and Narcissa gave a slight wave back. Turning back to Draco, Maddie's smile fell. "What will happen to me?" she asked quietly. "My auntie has too many children."
Harry relented with one last kiss. He rolled over and got out of bed before pulling Draco to his feet. They took turns in the shower and warmly for the day. When they got downstairs, they realized that Kreacher had prepared a full English breakfast.
"Finally coming to tell me about your fling with Weasley?" Draco asked with a smirk. To his amazement, Pansy blushed. She never blushed.
Ron froze at the sudden return to casual conversation, but he recovered quickly. "George and Angelina are bringing the baby home today, so mum's having everyone over for dinner," he explained.
"I'll do my best," Ron replied, though he was sure that he'd prefer snogging the giant squid over babysitting Malfoy. He walked over to Harry and kneeled, reaching for his friend.
When Ron and Hermione left, Harry suddenly felt rather nervous. He'd been alone with Draco many times, but it felt very different now.
Harry laughed, hugging Draco happily. Draco looked at Luna eagerly. "You're certain it's a girl?" he asked.
Harry had also become more protective and perhaps a bit possessive on occasion. The day before Christmas, Pansy had kissed Draco's cheek affectionately and Harry's wings had flared out wide as he trilled loudly in warning. Pansy leapt away from Draco, watching Harry warily.
"I had some help," Harry said. "I contacted a magical jeweler by owl to special order the rings. Pansy and your mum planned the decorations and set up. Ginny, Ron and Molly handled the food. I had to get you upstairs at a specific time do they could set up quickly. There was a charm in our closet that alerted Hermione when I got our clothes out."
When the meal was over, popcorn and various sweets were prepared in bowls while a movie was selected. Draco sighed and moved into the living room, glad that the others were still in the kitchen for the moment.
Pansy nodded.  “I know I wanted him to stop mooning over Potter and do something about it,” she said quietly.  “But I hate to see Draco so sad.”
"Well, that's no good," Pansy muttered. She looked at Draco with a frown. "Your muse is one of the people in need of cheer."
Blaise and Pansy arrived first, immediately commenting on how delicious aroma of the food. Pansy disappeared to call Draco down while Blaise set the table. Ron came in as Pansy called for Harry.
Draco couldn't think of a good response to that statement. He could see Pansy's lips trembling as she attempted to resist laughing. Hermione was squinting at Luna a bit suspiciously.
"He's so good with them," Pansy said, waddling up to Harry. Her stomach was full and round with her first child. Ron was very excited about becoming a father.
"Can you stop being gay for a moment?" she blurted out, sighing when Harry and Ron burst into a fit if laughter, clearly overhearing her outburst. "I just need my best friend right now," she added, lowering her voice.
"He doesn't need to know exactly how we went about it," Harry blurted out, resurfacing in a desperate attempt to diffuse the situation.
Harry's face reddened. "I just..." He glanced at Draco and then looked away again, flustered. "Shut up Ron."
Draco rolled his eyes and began eating his steak in neat little bites. So far, he wasn't enjoying movie night. It was a little overwhelming. Some part of him, the bird part probably, wanted to hide away in the nest upstairs, away from all the chatty people.
Draco stared at him in wonder. All those months ago, he'd decided to give Harry the romance he deserved. But, Harry had done the same in return.
"Of course," Neville agreed solemnly. Then he smiked. "As long as you weren't getting pregnant at the wedding, it's fine."
Draco was leaning against the door frame, still wearing bed clothes and looking uncertain. Harry smiled sleepily and motioned for him to come closer.
Three days later, Draco still wasn't feeling well. His panic had subsided, but he was strangely restless. Harry looked on in bewilderment as Draco rearranged furniture, cleaned and recleaned various surfaces and checked the wards around the house frequently. He would often stop and keep still for several moments with his eyes closed before he would have off Harry's concern and resume his previous activity.
Draco glanced away from the telly to look at the quilt. Various runes had been carefully stitched into the fabric with thread that shimmered faintly. Despite feeling cool to the touch against his hand, the quilt was radiating comforting warmth against his body. He could feel his dizziness and nausea subsiding as he relaxed into the couch.
