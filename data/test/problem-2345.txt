Draco watched Potter, who had positioned himself by the window again instead of sitting down. He looked tense. The thought hit Draco that they must have been angry with him. He hadn’t even thought about that, because their hatred was centred on him and Pansy, but Potter’s eyes kept darting anxiously to Granger and the Weasleys.
He had grown rigid and was watching Harry warily.
Harry realized that despite spending the whole day worrying about this, he hadn’t been able to anticipate at all how weird it would be to see him. He was at the same time instantly recognizable and utterly transformed. Harry would have recognized him anywhere, but in this context, he was hit by the same sense of disconnect he had felt when he’d heard his voice on the phone. All these incongruous elements that had somehow been forced into the same space – Malfoy, who was so entangled with Harry’s years at Hogwarts and with the war, suddenly intruding on his post-Hogwarts, post-war life. Malfoy, who was the epitome of aristocratic, pureblood wizard-snobbery actually sitting there, in a seedy little pub in Peckham wearing a knitted grey sweater when Harry had known him for seven years and never once seen wearing anything other than robes. It was disorienting.
“The others will be saying it too,” she said.
He looked up at the headmistress.
“Well, what do you suggest we do?” hissed Harry.
There was a light touch on his shoulder and he flinched away from it. Irie was looking at him with confusion written all over her face. He blinked, looked past her at every face in the store now turned to him, all of them staring open mouthed, confused, disapproving and suspicious.
Harry scoffed, Malfoy continued unperturbed:
“I thought you didn’t care?”
“Right.”
She raised her wand above her head.
“I can believe what he says about Azkaban and I’m all for blowing up the place if it’s really that bad,” she said. “But I won’t be working with those two. We can do this as the D.A. without any snakes involved, or we’re not doing it at all.”
Harry nodded.
“But Malfoy hated being a Death Eater, didn’t he? And he was very young when he joined.” said Hermione.
"I don't know, Potter. I wasn't exactly sober either."
"Right to my fucking doorstep?"
He could hear him breathing. There was something strangely intimate about it. When he spoke again, his voice sounded even more strained.
He shrugged. He wasn’t sure he would even be able to say it aloud.
“Weren’t they all given impressive job-offers?”
“Okay,” he said. “I’ll leave you alone, then.”
“What’s that?”
Harry shrugged. "I don't know."
He shook his head.
There would be no truce. Harry was going to kick Malfoy’s teeth in.
that cost next to nothing and are at least as good?"
“Are you coming, then?”
“You mean in this pub?"
“Which means they are not my friends anymore.”
was in the corner next to
to see him, of course, and he didn't anticipate any sort of warm welcome from any of the other Gryffindors or Dumbledore's Army hanger-ons, but there was a reason he had tried to meet with Potter in the first place. Pansy could think what she wanted, but all Draco had been trying to achieve, the point of the whole thing, had been to make it possible for him to go to a place like this and not have his every move hampered by the anxiety of running into Potter. He had hoped that facing him, talking to him, letting him know that he wasn't
“Yeah,” Draco says. “You did.”
“Of course you can-“
Harry shrugs.
Harry inadvertently glanced towards the Slytherin half of the classroom when he was reprimanded. Malfoy was smirking at his notes, and then, as if he felt Harry’s eyes on him, looked up at him for a second with a flash of teeth. Harry turned away quickly and tried to focus his attention on the rest of Slughorns walkthrough of the potion.
“Here – there’s an empty room next to the transfiguration one, we can talk in there.”
He said it slowly, condescendingly, wanting Potter to understand how ridiculous his assumption was, but it sounded weird out loud. It always did. It had been a long time since he last had to tell anyone outright like that. Now that he thought about it, he might not actually have said it since he told his mum. A lot of people just assumed, and anyway it wasn't like Draco was dating, so it mostly didn't matter what people thought. Which was exactly why it was so absurd to be telling Potter, who he had in fact wanted to date since he was about 14, and who by all means should have known, considering they had been sworn enemies for years and Draco's homosexual tendencies ought to be the kind of thing a proper enemy would have sniffed out.
“I didn’t take runes,” he said. “How does that help us?”
Pansy shot him an icy look.
“Yesterday,” Harry said, not really looking at Malfoy. “I thought maybe we should talk about it. About what happened.”
Harry shrugged.
“Hey,” he said instead.
“No, it’s fine, go get some sleep.”
He bent down to kiss Hermione and Harry looked away.
“What happened to your hand?” he asks.
Draco folded up his newspaper quietly.
Harry leaned against the balustrade, not really looking at Draco.
Harry narrowed his eyes.
He definitely didn't remember that.
Then Granger followed Harry and Draco down the stairs. Escorted by the stag, the otter and the snake, they left Lovegood and Longbottom behind.
“Draco!” she said sharply. “Don’t swear. And don’t say things like that.”
There was a second of stillness. They all turned to stare at her. She wasn’t looking at anyone.
"Yeah, Gringotts. It was during the war - actually, never mind," Harry cut himself off.
“Hermione…”
“Well, then that’s as expected,” he said. “I haven’t been keeping up. What about Nott?”
He spoke quietly, keeping his eyes on her, but he thought he saw movement amongst the dementors. Could they hear? How intelligent were they, that wizards were able to give them orders and use them as guards and weapons?
Lovegood was curled up on the sofa, still reading the book. Draco and Granger were repeating things they already knew at each other, both waiting for someone else to have a good idea.
Potter shook his head.
right below. He read:
And there was a burst of silver, a second where he expected her corporeal patronus to materialize, but instead the light sparked and twisted into loops and threads as they were dragged into the runes as if pulled by a sudden, magnetic force. For a moment the rune just glowed faintly silver, but then it spurted a thin, twisted rope of light that shot along the wall and crashed eagerly into the other rune. And there it stayed, a band of wavering patronus light along the wall of the room.
“It’s-“ Harry began, but didn’t get any further before Draco pushed past him, all signs of his trance-like state vanished in place of sudden urgency.
“No,” Malfoy said. “I don’t want to visit my father.”
Harry grimaced.
“Cut it out, Ernie!”
“They aren’t Death Eaters,” said Padma.
They made their way through the dark, empty halls of the castle, which seemed bigger and colder this time of night.
“I haven’t talked to any of them recently,” she said. “Last time I heard anything, they were still talking about broomsticks.”
“’Morning,” he said, looking up when Harry pulled out a chair. "Did I wake you up?”
"Liked your other clothes better."
“Good.”
“Well, I’m glad you made it. It’s been a while.”
all feeding on the prisoners then the ones down here would all be trying to get upstairs, but they
“I can’t,” he hisses back. “Detention.”
“So what have you found out?” he asked, nodding to the stack of books in front of her.
“It’s not all politics,” she said.
The classroom was in a disused corridor of the dungeons far from both the Potions classroom and the Slytherin common room. The door was locked, but it only took a simple
“You sound like an idiot.”
For a second Ron looked like he was the one who had been punched, and Harry felt immediately bad for saying it. Then Ron shrugged.
He let his hand fall and the patronus faded.
They stopped. He looked around, his heart pounding in his chest.
And someone had seen it. Someone had recognized it.
Then Pansy’s gaze fell on Hermione and her eyes widened.
She let out a sharp, little laugh.
He was less annoyed by the insult than he thought he would have been, but there seemed to be surprisingly little spite in the statement. Besides, much as he hated admitting that there was anything Malfoy was better at than him, it was probably true.
“I don’t know,” said Draco.
Harry pushed open the door to the Hospital Wing and looked inside. It was dark, the empty beds were islands of ghostly white, the curtains around them all pulled back.
“Maybe… I mean there might be a source,” he continued. “But we don’t know that it’s something we can find, it might not be something tangible-“
“Right,” said Harry.
“What about her?”
He used to be one of those boys.
A boat was waiting for them down by the shore. It was small and battered and seemed inadequate as protection against the violent waves, but it was pulled by magic and cut smoothly through the water, as if it was running on railroad tracks rather than sailing. A spell had been cast to keep the sprays of water from hitting them too. His mother had her hands curled tightly in her lap and was staring straight ahead. He could tell she was worried, even if she would have appeared calm and dignified to anyone else. He turned away from her and wondered how far out the island was. He couldn’t see anything yet. Suddenly he was worried they might have to sail all the way to the Danish or Norwegian coast – Azkaban was unplottable, so he had never seen it on a map and had no closer idea of where it was, other than that it was somewhere in the North Sea. He was just about to ask one of the aurors how far it was, when he saw it. It appeared out of nowhere. A second ago there had only been the sea ahead of them, but now the tower rose sharp and angular into the sky. It towered over them like a mountain, immense and eternal, and as with Hogwarts, it was hard to believe that humans had created it. It was hard to believe it had ever been created at all, that it hadn’t always been there as a shadowed mark upon the world. It seemed the grey daylight never reached the stones of the walls, like the tower held a darkness of its own. Draco had never thought a building could look evil. There were no seagulls anymore.
It had been a year and a half since the end of the war and nearly a year since Harry, Ron and Hermione had moved into Grimmauld Place together. It still surprised Harry whenever someone mentioned it, that it had been a whole year now. It really didn’t feel like that long. He still felt like they ought to be at Hogwarts. He still had dreams, occasionally, about being behind on homework or late to class. It felt like he had stumbled into some adult life he never really expected to have.
It was an eternity before she turned to look at him. His chest felt cramped. Words stuck in his throat but he held her gaze and hoped she knew him well enough to read the
“They’ll think we were polyjuiced.”
“And I of course asserted that if anyone has earned the right to a year of goofing off, it’s you. But I wonder why you haven’t mentioned this to any of your teachers? You know I would have been happy to talk to you about your future.”
“No, I can’t. Unless you’re about to tell me I’m betraying my blood, which is-”
They met again on Monday, and Draco supposed one could say that it went better. He succeeded in creating the misty shield several times, and it did become thicker and more solid. He could sustain it for longer too, but it still did not become corporeal. So they met again later in the week. And again in the weekend, but he seemed to have stagnated.
“Or maybe we were wrong about suffocating them, they were all just theories we came up with, we don’t really know anything about them, maybe we’re wrong about all of it-“
Harry walks back to the door and Draco watches him. He rests his arms on his knees, the watch still dangling between his fingers.
Neville didn’t say anything. Harry picked up his Firebolt and took the invisibility cloak from where it was stowed away in the trunk under his bed.
There had been a short period of numbness after that. Draco hadn't left the grounds of the Manor much, hadn't really seen anyone. He'd developed a creeping anxiety of staying inside and had spent his days going on long walks in the surrounding countryside. And in the night, he'd returned to the house and to his room to spend endless hours slipping in and out of sleep, in and out of claustrophobic dreams of the days when they had shared their home with Voldemort. There were locked rooms they would never use again; he had avoided them in the daytime but inevitably ended up there in his dreams: the cellars where they had kept prisoners, the dining hall where Voldemort had held court, the bedroom he'd sometimes disappeared into and where he'd presumably slept. The aurors had taken special interest in those rooms of course, and there was hardly anything left in there save for the wallpaper and the curtains. There had been fewer searches than in the period before the trials, but they'd still happened once in a while. Draco had felt like a ghost, trapped in the gloomy halls of his gutted childhood home.
His eyes settled on Draco maybe for the first time since they apparated, and there was a flicker of grim awareness on his face.
“Is this how you usually handle bad news?” he asked.
Hermione turned to him with a hard look.
Her brother followed and Finnigan and Thomas joined them on the way out. Everyone else had already gone.
“You’re here alone?” she asked.
“I guess you should.”
year when Harry knows he was falling apart, he still looked more put together than he does now. He shouldn’t have kissed him, shouldn’t have opened that door again. There had been a terrible look on Malfoy’s face, just for a moment, when Harry was about to leave, and maybe part of him just wanted to make sure he was okay. Which isn’t exactly something he can tell him.
“Look, I saw the letter Malfoy’s mother had sent him where she said they were going to Azkaban. And he really didn’t want to go, he got himself wasted on firewhisky because of it.”
"Seriously, Potter?" Malfoy said and Harry could almost see the indignant sneer on his face. "I'm trying to be
"Went to bed early, I was awake anyway."
“I think I see the stairs,” he called.
He looked into the fireplace where the embers had gotten hold of a crumpled up piece of parchment and little flames were flaring up.
He doesn’t give a fuck about Weasley. He shifts on the bed, reaching for the watch on his bedside table, the bedsprings creak and wail.
Harry lowered his wand and allowed it to fade away. There was a scuffling behind him and he turned around. Malfoy had stood up and had already pulled out his wand. His eyes were wide and bright and excited.
Her grip tightened and her thumb pressed against the dark mark through the fabric of his sleeves.
"Just getting some fresh air," he said.
“How can you say you're over him when it's been actual years since you had anything to do with him and yet you're
"Did you want anything else, Potter?"
“We have had many students who have struggled with coming back to school after the way classes were taught last year-“
She laughed.
Nott did.
“I’m not an idiot,” he snapped.
It was easier for him to fall asleep when he was exhausted, so he repeated the trip from the night he ran into Malfoy, and flew over the forbidden forest. The size of it was amazing. There had to be some sort of magical way to keep it off muggle-maps like there was with Hogwarts. He would have to ask Hermione or possibly Neville about it, and about whether wizards had hidden the forest or if it was its own magic. Of course it had to be big if there was an entire herd of centaurs in there, a herd of tame thestrals, a nest of acromantulas and still enough space left that Hagrid had been able to hide Grawp. And since none of those places had been too far a walk from the school grounds the forest was probably folding space within itself as well, like Hermione had theorized that the room of requirement had done.
“She did believe me but-“
“So I suppose that’s as much as we’ll be able to do for now, then,” she said.
"No, of course not!" he snapped.
Draco shrugged.
“They already know what I did,” Draco says.
"It might have," Blaise said, leaning back in his chair and swirling the last of the firewhisky around in his glass. "I mean, we all picked sides during the war and that last year at Hogwarts was pretty rough, but the thing with you and Potter goes back to way before that, I thought maybe going through a war would make you see how childish-"
“Fine. Whatever. Come see me when you have some free time, okay? Don’t forget me just because you’ll be best mates with Harry Potter now.”
"It was Blaise's birthday," Malfoy said coolly. "My friends wanted to go out for drinks. I wasn't actually there to ruin your night. Also, may I remind you that you were the one who started talking to me?"
“That won’t work,” he said. “He won’t be able to get it through the Wizengamot, you know that, professor.”
They both took out their wands and put them down on the table. They did not have anything else with them.
“Harry, wake up.”
“Because I
“So, why are you late?” she asked briskly.
“We were all scared-“
“Well that doesn’t sound like much of an explanation, I can’t imagine why you would want to skip a party that is all about praising you for being a hero from the day you were born and until today, saving everyone from the same dark lord
He nodded, that had been his plan as well.
"Seamus was ready to get up and start a fight the second you guys came in."
on his uniform when they meet and for once Harry tries to leave bruises.
Harry shook it.
"Tracey? Daphne?"
“Yeah, no, I just remembered something. Do you mind if I talk to Draco for a second?” he said, standing up.
Harry shook his head, and for a moment they just stared at each other. Then Harry’s face split into a grin. Ron started laughing too when he did, the relief and overtiredness washing over them, and there wasn’t anything funny about it, but then Harry was laughing because Ron was, and Ron was laughing at him.
“And I’m sorry for what Bellatrix did to you,” he continued.
Pansy leaned in and lowered her voice.
“Alright,” said Granger, a bit too briskly for Azkaban. “Let’s go.”
“Are you worried she’ll take it out on you?”
“No, I can imagine,” he said.
“Not the Weasley girl?”
“Right. I don’t.”
“Then we’re all excellent duellers.”
The light was still on out there and he squinted in the brightness. The tiles felt like ice on his feet. He still hadn’t quite adjusted to the light when he leaned against one of the sinks and turned on the cold tap. He cupped his hands under it and splashed water in his face. It was too cold, like a bite against his skin. He did it again, then turned the water off. He stood with his hands resting on the porcelain and watched a drop of water drip from his nose and into the sink. There was a creak behind him and he started, spun round and reached for his wand that wasn’t there, because he had left it in his bed. Neville stood in the doorway looking startled too, like he had been half asleep a second ago.
It was worth every single moment of failure. He raised his wand and cast the spell again. The snake reappeared. They watched the beautiful creature twisting its body in the air, the powerful muscles moving under the shimmering scales.
“Not with magic. I can cook in a muggle kitchen.”
“Well, I would be happy to leave anytime.”
“I just got a letter from my mother. She hasn’t been writing me a lot this year.”
“You do realize you’re a wizard, right?” he said.
“I don’t know why I’m even talking to you about this,” she snapped.
“Don’t look so worried,” said Draco. “You heard him, he trusts me, so do as you’re told and run along now, will you?”
“I’m fine, but I’d rather not have my feet ripped of by bowtruckles.”
Draco swallows hard. They’ve been living in this house together for almost a week, and Potter hasn’t looked at him once. They haven’t spoken at all, and Draco hasn’t allowed himself to think… or to want… but now he’s right there. And he has his wand with him. It’s a sudden and unwelcome reminder of all the things Draco has allowed himself to forget about what happened between them at Hogwarts; the things that were safe to forget when Draco thought he would never see him again, when he was daydreaming and longing and wallowing in his misery. Now whatever glorified, rosy fiction he had spun around the memories evaporates and the reality of their brief relationship is back at the forefront of his mind. He watches the wand in Harry’s hand and he remembers the bites, the shoves, the punches all too vividly; the fights that Potter seemed to need before he could allow anything else to happen. He remembers how quickly he would leave Draco afterwards, how hard his eyes were. He remembers the press of Potters fingers against the dark mark on his arm the last time they spoke before Draco finally betrayed Hogwarts.
Potter’s voice trailed off.
"Did you sleep in dormitories or did you have your own rooms?" asked Maya.
“Alright. Should we divide up the books?”
“Not at all. Is it the muggle-essay?”
“Still, if the room of requirement hadn’t burned down, I would’ve thought you’d rediscovered Harry’s book of wonder from sixth year.”
“About what?”
“No shit. With who? Your new muggle friends?”
Potter stuffed his measuring scales into his bag.
He heard the dragging, rattling breath behind him and turned around as the dementor rose up on the other side of the railing. Far away, his mother screamed.
“God, Ron, that wasn’t what I meant!” said Hermione at the same time Harry exclaimed “No!”
“Hey,” he called, his face splitting into a wide, uncontained smile.
Malfoy gave him one of those looks to tell him he was being an imbecile.
talk to me about it? I’m as much as part of this as any of you - I’m going to Azkaban too.”
know,” said Harry.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers.
“I can’t believe we’re never going back,” he said.
"How very muggle of you," she said.
“I didn’t ask you to.”
“Like what? Taking the mark? You had no choice about that.”
“I know I wasn’t a hero and I don’t need you to approve of anything I did. I don’t need anyone to do that. I’m just sick of your narcissistic hero-worshipping when the kids in Slytherin are ashamed of their house because of the way your lot tells the story. I think it would be fucking great, especially if Potter is serious about this inter-house cooperation-shit, if you would stop making us all out to be evil, because we’re not. And maybe for the sake of cooperation, or truth or fairness, you could admit that it was sad what happened to us, what they did to us, just as it was sad and wrong what they did to you. It wasn’t all our fault what we did to each other – you can admit that there were people and circumstances that made us do those things, or at least made it much harder not to do them, without having to compromise any of your sacred morality. We shouldn’t be the villains of your story.”
“Did you have a place in mind?” Harry asked. “The Leaky Cauldron?”
“Really? When?”
She looked around.
She smiled. He took a deep breath.
Harry felt frustration stirring in him. Anyone with half a brain who had heard Malfoy talk about Azkaban the way he had would know he was telling the truth. If the others refused to work with him, that was their decision, and he shouldn’t have tried to trick them into anything, but Malfoy wasn’t lying.
“I really don’t think he is. I think you’re bored and you’re trying to make up problems where there aren’t any.”
But apparently, Malfoy was done.
“Bad habit of yours.”
“Well, I live here.”
Ginny caught it. She lowered her own wand and was about to turn away when someone cried out, loud and shrill and frightened.
"Sorry?" he said, and then: "I don't know what you want me to say. I was in my room."
“Really? He still gets off on bothering you?”
He lowers his head and strides past Harry, and Harry reacts instinctively, grabbing his arm without even realizing what he’s doing until Malfoy stops and glares back at him with pure loathing in his eyes. But he doesn’t try to pull away. Harry opens his mouth to say something else, but nothing comes out.
They were brewing skelegro in Potions, and as with most healing draughts it was a very complicated process. The lesson had even been extended, as they wouldn’t have been able to finish within the timespan of a normal lesson. Draco was almost as good with healing potions as with antidotes, so he allowed himself to also keep an eye on Potter across the classroom. Judging from the look of hard concentration on his face, he was struggling more than Draco.
He didn’t sound very calm either. If this had been about anyone else, he would have gone to talk to Ron or Hermione immediately. Hermione was much better at this sort thing than Harry was, and though Ron was usually just as clueless as himself, at least they could be confused together. But he couldn’t tell them about this, and knowing that only made him more irritated.
“What do you mean she wasn’t? It was all bollocks,” said Ron.
“No–“ Harry gasps, getting to his feet, slipping and staggering, plunging towards Draco, whose face is shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest. Harry falls to his knees beside him. Draco is shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood, eyes rolling back into his head.
“Don’t sit too close to her,” he said. “I suppose you’ll have to be at the same table, but it would attract attention if it looked like you were studying together.”
“Yes, Granger, I get the
He stared at the glass on the table. Malfoy had bought him a beer.
"Did I say something? I'm sorry if I shouldn't have asked about-"
He really wants to scream. He’s not sure he could if he tried.
"Late for what?" he said, glancing at the clock.
“She’ll be in enough trouble as it is. I don’t want her to become a target because of me.”
“Of course I care!”
"Hermione just came home."
He was halfway to the dungeons before he had calmed down enough to realize that he might have made a mistake. It had been clumsy and halfway unintentional, but Potter had offered him a truce. It was not what Draco wanted, he didn’t want any more favours from Potter, but it was valuable. Getting Harry Potter to change his mind about house Malfoy was very valuable. It could be a gateway to Potter’s faction, and even if they didn’t know how to use their status, he certainly did. The Slytherins had counted him out and he didn’t have many cards left to play. Saying no to this one might have been more than he could afford.
“Yeah, I know you do, but you two never fight.”
He was still within the circle of light from Harry’s patronus, but only barely, and they were still so far away from the stairs and Harry wouldn’t be able to drag him there when he was holding up Hermione. His heart was pounding and his throat swelled as the fear and helplessness welled up in him. And then a dementor slid between him and Draco, and another one, and then they all crowded around him like flies around an open wound and he was swallowed up in the mass of them and disappeared from view.
“Yes, Weasley.”
"People talk," Draco insisted.
He didn’t have to wait long.
“Alright,” he said, but he still looked sort of lost there by the door, like he didn’t know where to look or what to do about himself.
"See you around, Harry!" called one of the boys whose name Harry had forgotten.
He wonders if this is what it was like when his parents got married – if they also had to carve out every inch of normalcy and happiness from the closing darkness of the world around them.
“But it’s not just what he did during the war! We hated him before that. You know, before he was letting Death Eaters into the school or trying to assassinate Dumbledore, when he was carefree and unmarked and could spend his time calling Hermione a you-know-what and making fun of my family and trying to convince everyone you were barmy.”
“You did what?!”
Draco reached into his pocket.
Harry froze with an empty fork halfway between his plate and his mouth. He lowered it.
There were parts of himself that he could simply put away when he needed to. He had had to watch his aunt torture Granger back at the manor, and so he had switched off, and he had watched, and he hadn’t cared.
Harry nodded, then left the pub and made his way back up to the castle under the looming, grey skies that promised more rain to come. As he crossed over the grounds from the gates to the main entrance, he decided that the meeting, in retrospect, hadn’t been all that terrible.
Draco flinched at the sound. He spun round, raising his wand as he did so, his heart pounding hard in his chest. At the other end of the hall stood Potter with his wand in one hand and his broom in the other. His hair was even more of a mess than usual, his robes looked windswept and dishevelled and he wore en expression of tense surprise and suspicion on his face. Draco’s pulse was still hammering, a surge of adrenaline pouring through him and curses ready on his tongue, but right beneath the sudden rush of alarm, he felt drained. Despite all his hatred for the self-righteous prat, he didn’t have the energy for a confrontation. Not tonight. Potter was another living reminder of all the ways in which Draco had failed.
Potter didn’t argue. Draco didn’t say anymore. The silence stretched.
"Dormitories. Me and Malfoy were in different ones, though. We were in different houses."
“I called him.”
He shrugged.
“Or maybe it’s working,” said Draco quietly.
“Meet me outside.”
“No. I just… I’m fine.”
Ron had started snoring loudly. Harry pulled his wand from under his pillow and pointed it to the curtains around his bed, muttering a silencing spell to keep the sound out.
“Oh no,” said Hermione quietly.
“Yes, but
Draco didn’t know what that was, but the others seemed satisfied with the answer.
“Well, no worries, then. Looks like there’s absolutely nothing in the way of you becoming Potter’s new best friend and being forgiven by the wizarding world, showing me and Blaise and all the others exactly how wrong we were to count you out.”
The silver stag was the first to join the hare, but it was soon followed by an otter, a terrier, Draco’s snake, Ginny’s fox and – surprisingly and clichéd – Longbottom’s lion.
But he couldn’t go back to sleep either. The feeling of the dream still clung to him. The sense of terror had lessened, but the urgency had not. That must have been why he had dreamt it – because he hard started to forget, and this had been a violent reminder of why they were doing all of this and, more importantly, why it could not wait. That was what he desperately wanted to be able to tell someone, just to be able to say it aloud. Just to make it real, to detangle it from the dream-logic of his own head: That every day Azkaban was left standing was another defeat. As soon as they had even the slightest chance of success, they had to go.
“Right,” he said.
“I can do warming spells.”
“Have you thought of an excuse for where you’ve been all day?” he asked.
Except he wasn’t repulsed. Luna had said that Malfoy might like him, and the thought had sort of pleased him. Absurd as it was, it was also sort of flattering. Or it would have been, if it hadn’t been completely impossible.
“So Belby and Jansson brought you up here without a patronus?” he asked without turning around.
“Do you know what you’re doing, Neville?”
It felt more like underlining the silence than breaking it.
He heard Potter scoff.
“But it isn’t all on you!” he said, louder than he had intended. “It’s great that you think you’re obligated to try to save the world and it’s great to know that sometimes you can’t rely on others to do the things that have to be done, but you also have to trust that you’re not the only one who’s trying. Besides, there’s more than one way to save the world, just because you’re in Gryffindor that doesn’t mean you can only do things that matter when you run in wands blazing with no idea what you’re doing, the way Harry does. If you had been in Ravenclaw you’d probably have been fine with doing practically all the research, basically solving the problem of how to kill a dementor, and then not go with us to Azkaban. It’s not like you don’t know you’re one of the most talented witches to graduate from Hogwarts in years, so aren’t you planning to save the world in other ways too? Politics and science and philosophy, that’s still important even if it looks less impressive.”
While he and Granger were mostly looking into the dementors, looking for some way of eradicating them, he knew the others were trying to figure out the practical logistics of their mission – how to get there and how to get away unnoticed. What to do about the aurors. He came up there once, expecting to find the room empty, and instead Lovegood, Neville and Weasley were sitting on the floor with a map of Great Britain and several of the newspapers spread out between them. He stopped in the doorway and they all looked up at him.
“Because you can’t just decide to stop hating someone. That’s not how people work – if we simply pretended the other person didn’t exist, our image of each other wouldn’t change, as there wouldn’t be another one to take its place.”
In the library Theodore Nott was already seated at one of the desks. Draco pulled out the chair across from him.
And then it wasn’t even something he could vent to his friends about, because it was so incredibly embarrassing. He hadn’t thought Malfoy would go that far just to humiliate him.
“I couldn’t.”
This was the worst thing that had ever happened to him.
“It didn’t speak to me.”
“What do you think would have happened if we hadn’t met like we did?”
"Draco, you remember I've told you about Mark, right?" Irie said.
!” he cried.
“I didn’t say it was simple.”
“How?” said Weasley.
“But things didn’t work out very smoothly today either, did they?” said Ginny, echoing his thoughts.
“I was thinking more about the company,” said Ron.
Draco noticed that the Lovegood girl was staring at him. Her strange, protruding eyes had a glazed look, her face was expressionless; she could have been in a trance. She didn’t look away when he stared back. It was like she didn’t blink enough, that girl. He turned his attention to Potter and pretended he couldn’t still feel her eyes on him. Potter took a deep breath.
“I’m trying really hard not to think about that.”
Potter threw out his hands.
It got colder the further down they went. Which wasn’t right, Draco realized. They shouldn’t be able to feel the effect of the dementors when they had a patronus with them. He cleared his throat
She nodded.
“We should,” Harry said.
"Avoided Ministry invitations and the press," he said.
"Grab my arm?" he said.
“Unsurprising. Though she’s been a bit difficult to be around lately. Bossy, really particular about some things.”
“I have to-“
Harry cleared his throat.
Hermione was standing by his shoulder, so close he could only see the top of her head when he looked down. She was sifting through the beetles, her face hidden under her dark curls.
He nodded.
Draco had seriously considered not showing up that evening. He wouldn’t know what to say if Potter asked him about the kiss. He could try to pass it off as a joke again, but Potter wasn’t that stupid.
“Mine weren’t, your mother wasn’t. That’s all
"Yeah. Like I said. Shouldn't that be my problem if I'm the one who apparated here?"
“Well, we should probably get inside before all the food disappears.”
“What are you doing here?” asked Draco.
Neville stood up.
And Maya, like the gracious and lovely person she was, answered like this was still a perfectly normal conversation and not an awkward train wreck of nonsense.
“Thanks, Malfoy, I’m touched.”
“I was 14,” he hissed. “I was 14 when he came back!”
“He did.”
When Saturday came, the weather was cold and grey and windy. Ron and Hermione wanted to stay back at the castle, so Harry joined Dean, Seamus, Ginny and Padma for their trip to Hogsmeade. They walked around the village for a while, shopping and looking at windows. Harry was too distracted to keep up with the conversation and constantly lagging behind. He was trying to figure out how to get away from the others and also seriously considering blowing the whole thing with Malfoy off. He had been agonizing over it since the night before, telling himself it was stupid and ridiculous, but he couldn’t make himself not go either. He had no idea what Malfoy could want them to talk about for long enough that they needed to meet in a pub outside of school, but he had to admit that he was curious. Malfoy was different this year. Despite what Harry had said to him in the owlery, he did think he had changed, though he only noticed it in glimpses. He knew Hermione was right, that he was worrying too much about him, so if nothing else, this was a chance to get some things cleared up. And he was spared having to come up with an excuse to leave the others: Around half past two it started drizzling, and they decided to go get butterbeer.
She rolled her eyes. Another deep breath on Potter’s part.
“I picked it up last year,” he said dryly.
"Sure. Thanks."
“You know, I’ve been thinking about something,” Harry said.
Malfoy shrugged.
"No," Harry said. "I only remembered it again on the way back."
Harry kicked an armchair.
“Things don’t always go as we expect, I suppose.”
“I suppose you could say that.”
Shortly after, Harry has the vision of Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, and none of what happened with Draco changes anything. He panics, gathers his friends, his
“How was the interview?” Draco asked.
“But how the hell did you get my phone number?”
“But-“
“I’m sure your pain is very real,” said Harry. “Should we get inside and find a compartment?”
“It’s the day my parents died.”
“You don’t have to worry about that, Weasley. I think Potter would agree that it’s something we should keep just between the two of us.”
“Yeah,” said Ron. “Didn’t you know?”
“I’m fine,” he said.
“Nobody talks about it.”
They looked at him.
muggleborns or anything…”
She rubbed her eye with the heel of her hand.
"Would be fun. They'd have to make ones for you and Hermione too."
"With the Gryffindors," he said.
“What’s going on with Malfoy?” asked Ron.
“But I saw something…”
“I told you our deal was off,” said Potter.
Harry looked around. They hadn’t risen far above the pit yet, but she was right: There wasn’t a single dementor on the landing or behind them, and none ahead of them either.
He reached his building, dragged himself up the stairs, switched on the light and dropped his keys on his desk. He was already halfway to the bathroom when the phone rang.
“But what if he’s up to something?”
He wondered what Ron and Hermione were doing. It was getting late. He should probably have told them where he was going. He had been such an arse. He took a long swig of his beer and tried to push the thought from his mind. He wished they were drinking something harder. He had managed to get out of Grimmauld Place alright. He could do with getting out of his head too.
He left quickly down the hall, and almost immediately slammed into someone walking in the opposite direction. The other boy had been in a hurry too and their heads knocked together painfully.
“Right, the Harpies, I forgot – really impressive. You know, I heard the two of you had split up?“
Immediately, images flashed through Draco’s mind of saws and leeches and everything horrible he had ever heard about muggle medicine. The revulsion must have shown on his face, because professor McGonagall let out a small sigh.
“Right,” he said.
Pansy glared at him.
“You don’t have to. It might not even be a good idea – none of the others have done this, so-“
Ginny Weasley stood frozen in the doorway, staring at Draco and Pansy. Then she turned her eyes to Potter, who stood by the window looking incredibly uncomfortable. Granger and Ronald Weasley had arrived right before Ginny. They had looked just as confused as her, but not half as angry.
It was strange, Harry thought, how you never got used to fear. Nothing he had been through in the last couple of years, no matter how horrible, did anything to diminish the overwhelming sense of dread. Possibly it made it even worse, made it easier to imagine what they had ahead of them.
“I was under my invisibility cloak. Dumbledore paralysed me, I couldn’t do anything, but…” Potter trails off.
she ended up like this.”
“We don’t talk anymore, but mother told me. What about-“
"What?"
Ron laughed.
"Then whose patronus is it?"
“I’m glad you weren’t.”
He hung up, but lingered in the kitchen for a little while. He felt all of a sudden incredibly homesick. Not for the Manor, he had no desire to go back there ever again. It was a more general homesickness. For a life he didn't have anymore. For the way he used to feel about his house when it had both of his parents in it and he still trusted that the things they had taught him were true.
“You should probably teach me the patronus charm first,” he said.
“Now,” she said, “I think you two should explain to me how on
“Anyway, did I miss out on anything important in Astronomy?”
Weasley nodded but didn’t look very convinced. Granger was already at the door.
Ron and Ginny were coming towards them and Ron’s eyes swept anxiously from Harry to Draco.
He waved it off.
“Yeah,” she said, just late enough to give the impression sense that she actually lived in her own time and space and conveying words just took slightly longer with her because they had to travel to her realm first.
“We always have a choice.”
“I always tried to tell him he was spoiling you, but he wouldn’t listen. You remember that summer you kept going on and on about how Harry Potter had gotten a spot on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and you weren’t even allowed to try out for Slytherin until your third year? You didn’t even ask him for anything, he just went out and bought those brooms, no questions asked-“
"Just meeting some people," he said, stepping around her to the front door and pulling it open. "See you later."
There was a loud crash, Potter jumped back, so startled Draco thought he might have had a minor heart attack. He stared at the cauldron where it had fallen over the edge of the table, the potion that had spilled everywhere and the purple fumes rising from the sizzling liquid. Then he raised his eyes from the mess, slowly, and looked at Draco. Draco stared back at him, a smirk creeping over his lips.
"Yes," Potter said.
Harry nodded and they ran for the stairs.
He sighed and leaned back heavily against the kitchen counter.
“Harry can cook.”
“They wanted to come and see us off,” she said.
“Why? Is it because I didn’t tell you?”
with that?”
He didn't want to go into that - he still felt dirtied somehow for getting off the hook that easily. He wasn't about to arm Malfoy with the fact that he had also been let off the hook for bank robbery.
"Oh, ‘morning, Harry, you're up early?"
They didn’t run into any teachers and their classes passed uneventfully. At lunch in the Great Hall McGonagall stood up at the head table as if to give a speech, and Draco tensed for a moment, but she just repeated the rules as they had been announced at the beginning of the year: That use of magic was not allowed in the hallways and outside of classrooms and study areas in general, and that duelling was prohibited at all times. She said nothing else, so he assumed no one had told the teachers about Blaise’s little outburst, even if they had detected the magic. He couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed. But then again, it was likely he would have been dragged into the mess and blamed for the incident anyway, so perhaps it was all for the best.
"Where are you going?"
“I’m alright.”
It burst forth from the pages of the
“She’s not my girlfriend!”
The last hours of his shift passed like weeks. Chris and Irie didn't ask about it, just pretended nothing had happened, only casting wary glances in his direction when they thought he wasn't looking. He kept his sleeves pulled down. He was an idiot for having been that careless. And it had started out as such a perfectly okay day too. He had even managed to halfway forget about Potter for a while, but then here was his past and the fucking magical world intruding on him, and suddenly Potter wouldn't leave his mind, and now Draco had to watch all of this through his eyes,  and it became so pathetic to him, the way he wasn't really friends with his coworkers, and was actually bad at his job, and had fucked up the coffee machine twice so he had had to ask Chris for help, and even Irie became too impatient with him to keep up any pretense of sympathy.
Irie frowned at him.
“I had an idea,” said Potter, and Draco couldn’t quite decide if he sounded nervous or excited. “Something Lupin did when he taught me how to cast a patronus.”
“Hermione-“ said Ron, but she was already on her way.
Draco raised an eyebrow in surprise. He didn’t think he had ever heard Granger swear before.
Potter's eyes widened and then he looked away quickly.
on a scrap of paper with some of Hermione's crossed out notes on it, signed it and folded it up.
Draco took another deep breath, knowing this wasn’t all he needed to say, but hating that he had to expose himself like this.
"Gillywater," Pansy said.
us? What would he do that for?”
“Mr Malfoy,” she said quietly. “I have been a teacher for a very long time and I have taught hundreds of students over the years. I have talked to more students than you can imagine about worse things than you would like to think about. And I have gotten very good at noticing when something is wrong. Sometimes it’s something I can help with, and sometimes it’s something you can’t do anything about as a teacher. These last few years there have been way too many children that I couldn’t help, but that doesn’t mean I don’t try. And you might not consider yourself a child anymore, but you are still a student at Hogwarts, and as long as you are, it is my responsibility that you are safe and that you are well.”
Granger sunk back in her chair and rested her head in her hand.
It felt wrong to break the long stretch of silence.
He put an arm around Potter's waist and they walked to the front door. And Draco's
The girls turned to him, as if they had momentarily forgotten he was there. Maya's laughter dried up.
He stood up. His limbs felt disjointed. Something fluttered anxiously in his gut.
And then Malfoy kisses him.
Malfoy shook his head.
“Because of your political plot?”
Harry settled down next to him on the flagstones and took a swig from the bottle, pretty sure he wouldn’t be able to taste the difference between cheap and expensive whisky.
“Okay. We can talk about it later, if you want to. But just don’t let this mess you up by not talking. I grew up with muggles too and so did lots of others, so it’s not like no one will understand, you know, if you’re confused.”
He lies. He gets rid of the book.
“No, we’re not,” said Granger. “So far the only thing I’ve noted down in our “things we know” column is that Azkaban is evil. All the rest is in “things to research”. So the first thing to do is obviously to visit the library.”
“Good, then I will leave both of you to your work. My office is just down the hall if you need me, and I will be back in an hour and a half when your detention is over. And just so we’re clear about this – I do not want to come back and find my classroom to be a smoking ruin. I have put up detection spells, and if either of you tries to cast any spells at all I will know it immediately.”
“You grew up with muggles,” he said. “Right. I forgot. They don’t like that sort of thing, is that what it is? Very uptight about it? Honestly, I always thought it was just a myth, like the one that they heal people by sewing up their wounds with string…”
She leaned forward as much as she could without disturbing Ron and said quietly:
“And Malfoy?” asked Harry.
a house. What is the point of sorting at all if you could just pick the place you want to go?”
Ginny grimaced.
“Is that also why we’re not sitting with the others?”
Draco started. He looked up and saw Potter coming towards him. Draco turned around and began walking away quickly in the opposite direction.
“There he is,” said Harry, when Malfoy came through the doors.
“He’s-“ he began, and then didn’t get any further.
“You’re going to blame her for that?” snapped Malfoy. “For thinking that giving up one person to save the lives of hundreds of others was a good idea? Potter was the one who took that deal, remember?”
“Sure,” he said, and pulled out his wand.
“Do you want to see if I can cast the spell here because it’s dark and eerie? You do realize my common room is in the dungeons, right?”
Harry winced – he opened his mouth to protest but suddenly couldn’t think of a single good reason why they shouldn’t go there.
Considering how much Hermione still hated Malfoy and how much Ginny loathed Parkinson, any sort of cooperation seemed pretty far out of reach no matter what they did.
“Long story,” he said. “Very long, very boring. Favours from different people and such.”
"What the fuck," he muttered. "What the actual fuck."
"Here," he said, almost shoving it at Harry.
The look on her face was so pitying it hurt.
Harry’s hands are curled into fists. He wants to punch that stupid expression off of Malfoy’s face; wants him to stop making everything so fucking difficult. Of course, he was an idiot to think things with Malfoy could be simple, that they could have any kind of goodbye that wasn’t ugly.
"She also said you're too awkward for this world."
Just a heads up that this is the last chapter I had finished, so since I'm caught up to the unfinished parts now, I can't say for sure when the next update will be, but it might be a while.
“Not really, no. I’m pretty sure Ginny is in charge of smuggling alcohol, she’s been getting a lot of letters from George recently. Actually I’m not going either.”
“Before the holidays, like I said.”
He said the last part as a joke, but Potter didn’t laugh. It was hard to read his expression. He was leaning against the windowsill and the light came from behind him, so his face was in the dark.
Then Draco felt the brush of Potter’s hand against his own. Warm fingers closed around his wrist and loosened Draco’s grip on the edge of the table. Draco’s heart convulsed violently. Potter’s fingers slid into place between his own, holding his hand in a determined grip. His palm was soft. His fingers twitched a little and Draco had to force down a panicked laugh.
“I’m not how I am because I’m trying to act like a Gryffindor, I’m in Gryffindor because of the way I am, that’s a really important distinction, and-“
There was a moment’s hesitation where neither of them moved to leave and Harry wasn’t sure what to do, because just going up the stairs would seem like they were pretending that nothing had happened, and he didn’t want that. He ought to say something to recognize that it was real. But then Malfoy leaned in and kissed him. And he supposed that worked to pretty much the same effect.
He noticed a bit of water that trickled down the wall. Except it didn’t. It was trickling up.
“Revenge,” said Ron. “On Harry, for killing Voldemort.”
“It wouldn’t make sense for the Wizengamot to clear him of charges and then not allow him to finish his education.”
Her eyes followed Ron and Hermione for a moment, but then she turned a stern gaze on Harry.
It was not at all like duelling with Pansy. Draco would get competitive even with her, but it was something entirely else when he was facing Potter and Weasley. Longbottom wasn’t as bad of a partner as he could have feared, but they were not even a minute into their duel before it became clear that the two of them were the inferior team. Draco was sweating in his robes and his jaw was clenched as he fired a close succession of three different, non-verbal disarming spells at Potter, all of which were deflected either by Potter or Weasley. And bloody Weasley – he was turning out to be a nightmare in a duel as soon as it wasn’t just one on one. His spells were no less dull or predictable, but now they were suddenly well placed, covering Harry where he opened up, he was constantly moving about so Draco more than once almost hit Longbottom when he tried to throw a spell in his direction. Draco’s heart was pounding and he was out of breath, but the adrenaline was worth every painful stab through his lungs. Longbottom’s voice sounded far away when he yelled for him to duck. Draco did and a needle of light shot over his head. He was back up in a second, so caught up in the game he hardly noticed the growing noise to his left, the bright bursts of light were only slight irritations in his peripheral vision. It was only when a loud, resounding crash bellowed around them that he turned to look at the other group. His wand was snatched from his hand by a disarming spell a second later, and he didn’t even know if it was Harry or Weasley who cast it. When he glanced back, they had all lowered their wands too, and like him they were staring wide eyed at Pansy and Ginny.
“You’re not in a hurry, are you? The weather is terrible, so I don’t think we’re going anywhere for a while.”
“Yes,” he said. “It’s just you.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry snapped.
“We need to talk,” he says and then doesn’t proceed to talk about anything.
“What?”
Harry glared at her. Just then, he was pretty sure he would prefer going back to Azkaban and taking on every single auror the Ministry was sending over there, rather than have this conversation.
"Well, you can't carry all of them back," Irie said.
Draco kept his eyes open as he leaned in. He regretted it even as he did it. He was being an idiot again. Potter was being an idiot too, just standing there.
“So you’re not used to strong alcohol?” asked Malfoy bemused.
"You're Harry then?" said the girl across from them, the one who had spotted him when he came in.
They passed through the gates. Harry had his hands stuffed deep in his pockets, his shoulders drawn up like he was freezing.
narrative again-”
There was a click.
Draco nodded.
"Did he ask for it?"
“Tell him – but only if he’s awake, if he’s asleep then leave him alone. But if he’s awake, tell him I’m in the secret room and… he can come if he wants to. It’s not urgent or important, though.”
"It's too cruel," she sighed. "You have to wear all those ugly, ill-fitting things when you are able to look
arrived the following morning and suddenly no one cared much about something as silly as school gossip and unexpected displays of inter house unity, because plastered across the front page were the news that the prison of Azkaban had been infiltrated and all the dementors destroyed.
“It seems just a tiny bit arrogant of you that you consider your company to be of such great importance that depriving me of it constitutes as a threat-“
When he returned to the studying tables, the fifth years had gone and Granger was the only student left. He decided to sit by her table despite what Longbottom had said. It shouldn’t matter when there was no one there to be puzzled by it. He pulled out a chair across from hers and put down the books. She didn’t look up. He doubted Madam Pince would be able to hear them talking all the way back there, but he still pulled out his wand and muttered a quick silencing spell just to be safe.
They were doing homework in the Gryffindor common room. Harry had been checking his watch every thirty seconds or so for the past five minutes. He was supposed to meet with Malfoy two minutes ago. He still hadn’t decided if he was going or not.
“Yours.”
“Don’t act like you didn’t have a choice in this!” Ginny snapped. “You could have said no just like we did. If you didn’t want to do what they told you, then you could have fought back, but you didn’t.”
“I’m a Malfoy.”
draw his map correctly?”
“Harry, don’t, we need to head downwards.”
Potter wasn’t looking in Draco’s direction, but Draco found he had a hard time not staring at him. It was rare to see Potter not wearing his school uniform, and even though it was usually a mess, seeing him in a button-down shirt was still an altogether very different experience from the way this cheap, thin fabric hung on his shoulders. It revealed a lot of pleasant nooks and angles that the uniform usually hid.
He was right.
"Because she's your - I mean, aren't you two…?"
Which of course she couldn’t. But despite all her oddness, there was a sense of omniscience about Luna. She wasn’t smart in the sharp, scalpel-like way that Hermione was, the way Malfoy was too, but she seemed to understand things on a different level than other people. There was something almost comforting about it.
“That’s not true, though,” Harry says quietly, and then presses on when Draco opens his mouth to protest: “It isn’t! I’m not saying everything would have been different if I’d known, alright? I don’t know that it would. Like I said, things were a mess back then, and honestly, they still are. But it wasn’t nothing to me. And I… I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t figure it out.”
“If that’s what you think, then what are we waiting for?”
“I’m fine,” he croaked.
“Yeah, I guess," he said. "I could almost pass for a pureblood.”
"You can ask, Potter," he said, without turning around.
"Sorry," he said. "I just… what are you doing right now?"
"Privileges? Don't think so, I had them for ages."
"The Fox it is," he said.
There was a moment of hesitation from Potter. Then he straightened up, sagging not quite as low against the wall. He glanced suspiciously at Draco.
“You should recast your patronus,” said Harry.
“Yeah…”
“People noticed I wasn’t there yesterday. They keep quoting the speeches at me,” Potter said.
He nodded. He was not alright.
“You were scared? Of what? He would have rewarded you. Handing me over would have fixed everything for you, I imagine.”
”I’m not,” he said and it sounded too defensive even to his own ears.
Ginny had been such a big part of what got him through the war, the one good thing he knew he had waiting for him if he managed to survive, and then it had been so undramatic for them to drift apart. They had gotten back together after the battle, and it just hadn't been the same as before the war. They had both been more distant, more careful, and he wasn't sure if it was because of what they had been through or if it was because he had left her behind. He’d never figured out how to ask her about it. They hadn't fought or anything, except for the row about Snape, but that had been months before they’d ended it. They hadn't fought, they just hadn't talked much, either. And then when Summer had ended, she’d gone back to school, and things had just… faded out. They had broken up officially when they’d both come to the Burrow for Christmas, and they had managed to keep it on the down low and out of the papers until a couple of weeks ago, when the thing with Heather had happened.
“It’s nothing,” he said.
“Where’s Hermione?” he called.
“You weren’t listening at all?”
Harry grinned.
Draco stood up and found his watch in the pocket of his robes.
“Just tell me what you’re mad about.”
It was only the second after he had sat back down he realized that that would have been a perfectly valid excuse to give. They all thought he and Malfoy were friends.
“Just checking, arsehole,” said Ginny.
“What?” he asked.
. And Draco couldn’t gather his mind to think of something to say. His thoughts were all jammed with the awareness that he couldn’t turn to look at Harry to see what his face was like, and that this would probably be the end of it and how they could have locked the door if they had just stopped to think for half a second.
“It’s a bit dumb with the last names, isn’t it? Now that we know each other.”
For a moment he was at a loss for words. He wanted to pull out his wand and cast his patronus – that would prove how wrong she was about him. But she couldn’t cast the spell herself, so maybe she wouldn’t understand the significance of its shape. She wouldn’t know that the snake meant that he hadn’t turned his back on her or his name or his family, even after the Dark Lord had poisoned everything he thought he knew was right.
"I'll tell them."
Malfoy didn’t laugh.
Harry slumped back in his chair and ran a hand through his hair.
He startled visibly – he had been lost in thought and hadn’t noticed the professor coming in. She looked up from the parchment when he didn’t answer.
She put the glass down on the bedside table.
They continued down the galleries, down staircases, once again accompanied by their three patronuses. Harry kept glancing back at Draco. He regretted bringing him. He should have convinced him to stay back – he should have tried, at least.
“What are you-“ he began, but then Weasley and Granger exchanged a look.
“Think you can sleep?”
Harry nodded.
“No,” said Draco firmly. “It has nothing to do with you. Just go to bed.”
“Hi, Luna,” she said.
"Okay, sorry. Way to turn this whole thing into a bummer," she said. "We were just having fun."
“I didn’t remember that," he said.
“I’m sure we can get dad to help out, he’s been wanting to install a toaster back home for years, but mum won’t let him.”
“There are about a thousand secret rooms all over the castle.”
He turned surprised to her, looking for the smirk around her lips, the thing she was actually saying beneath what she had said, but he couldn’t find it.
And for the first time the idea surfaced in Harry's groggy brain that this might actually be a prank. He had no idea what the point of it would be, but this was supposed to be Draco Malfoy's voice, and it definitely
They were quiet for too long and it was awkward.
Harry went through the door first and Malfoy followed after.
“It’s more complicated than that,” he said.
Harry looked up to see Malfoy entering the Great Hall. He was alone again. He made for the Slytherin table but then, before he reached it, he glanced toward the Gryffindors and his eyes found Harry’s, and for a fraction of a second they held each other’s gaze, and Harry’s heart surged.
"Yeah," Harry said. His mouth was too dry. "Really weird."
“At least she’s working with you. That’s actually a big improvement from before the holidays.”
Harry pulled out the folded piece of parchment. Apparently even the letters sent by the Malfoy family looked more expensive than those of normal people. The parchment was heavy, smooth and cream-colored, inlaid with a watermark of the Malfoy family crest, and the writing was in a beautiful cursive that it took Harry a while to decipher. It wasn’t a long letter and it was formal to the point of being impersonal, which was probably why Malfoy allowed him to read it. He had never thought about what sort of letters Malfoy would receive from his adoring mother, but this definitely wasn’t what he would have imagined.
“Yeah, I’m done,” he said.
There was an old lady with a walker making her way past a group of boys by the bus stop on the other side of the street. Harry followed her progress with his eyes. His heart was beating too fast. One of the boys laughed.
“There were always sides,” he said.
“Sure,” she said. ”I’ll see you up in the common room. And Malfoy, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.”
“Makes me write lines. She has a special quill for it.”
"Yes," Malfoy said, and the expression lingered, his voice was absentminded. "Right. Thank you."
“You and Weasley-“ he started again, but Harry cut him off:
"What-" he began, before Malfoy interrupted:
“As in tomorrow?” Malfoy asked.
She nodded. Draco pulled out his wand and pointed it again to Hermione’s throat and then her chest, muttering the incantation.
"I am seriously reconsidering every intention I had of telling you about it," he said.
"Alright," Ron said. "Just… try to get some sleep tonight, yeah?"
They all turned as one to look at Harry Potter. He was standing on the edge of the group flanked by the two Weasleys, who were still grinning, and Granger, who had her arms folded across her chest and an inscrutable expression on her face. Most of the laughter died out, and Macmillan looked uncertain.
At first all Harry feels is shame. He can’t look at Ron or Hermione or any of the other Gryffindors for the entire next day – no one notices, he’s been angry all year anyway. He can’t stop looking for Draco either, whenever they’re in the same room – in class or in the great hall – he can’t seem to relax until he has spotted him. Draco catches him looking a couple of times and smirks.
“Come after.”
Though school had started a couple of weeks ago, this was Draco’s first Transfiguration class of the year. His plan had been to concentrate in all of his classes, do his homework and work hard enough to earn good grades that could possibly make up for the disadvantage his name had become. But at his courage or confidence or whatever it was had failed him for the last few Transfiguration classes, and he had skipped them. It was stupid, but it was too late to try to make good first impressions on the professor anyway, so he just settled down in the back and hoped he could make up for his absence later. He had been taking the class last year as well, so he knew most of the curriculum already.
“I didn’t ask him to do anything
Draco pointed discretely to Sprout and McGonagall.
“I visited my father,” he said, his voice flat.
By the early afternoon, the grey clouds of the morning had disappeared and it had turned into a beautiful, sunny October day. He spent a nice five-minute smoke break outside feeling quiet and at ease. Sadly, it wasn't quite as peaceful when he went back in. The afternoon rush hadn't set in yet, but there was still a steady stream of customers and Chris left for his break as soon as Draco came back, so he and Irie were kept busy. And the thing about direct sunlight and big glass facades was that it became quite uncomfortable to work right next to the big coffee machines and the milk steamer and the sandwich heating contraption.
He was back to being the self-proclaimed protector of Hogwarts, which to him apparently meant dedicating his time to bothering Draco every moment he was awake.
Granger looked uncomfortable. She glanced up at the clock mounted on the library wall.
“Yeah, you’re right,” said Potter. “We’ll do that.”
“Take your time,” said Malfoy.
“Did anyone see you?”
“In here,” he said.
“I can help you pick out the petals if you want,” said Neville. “I’ve been drying monkshood down in the greenhouses for a project, so I know how it’s supposed to look.”
“That’s a good approach. How fast is Boyle with getting things?”
Ginny unfurled from her chair and stood up.
“I heard you left the aurors?”
“Hi, Harry,” he said.
Granger looked at him for a moment and he didn’t have time to figure out what that expression meant before she composed herself and nodded.
She had been waiting up for him.
Irie was looking at Malfoy like she was watching someone have an aneurism. Malfoy's face was twitching a bit. He looked like he was contemplating the legal consequences of singlehandedly bringing down the Statute of Secrecy.
“And if not, Snape would have kicked me out. There probably would’ve been more “Harry Potter is the Dark Lord reborn”-theories that weren’t in
“Blaise was alone.”
Potter sat up and stretched his back.
can apparate to “some stretch of the of coast of Great Britain from which it’s possible to reach Azkaban”?” said Hermione sharply.
"Well, that went smoothly," he said. "I don't think even my father used to get off with that little effort, and I'm pretty sure he was bribing or blackmailing half the Wizengamot more or less continuously."
"Yes. Turns out I'm surprisingly adaptable."
snitched on twelve year olds to get out of detention last year. You
"Sure," Harry said.
He sounded certain, but it was hard to believe him. Standing inside Azkaban, it still felt inescapable. It was still a fortress; the walls were just as thick, the bars just as real. But the dementors were gone and the darkness of the place was a sane one. The dementors were gone and the awareness of the cruelty of what the place had been was like a steady beat through Harry’s brain.
"Er, what?"
"Er, well I came here to-"
“Why did you want me to ask if you’re not going to tell me?” he said finally.
"What's the problem?
Malfoy smirked.
There was an edge to Malfoy’s voice. Harry glanced over at him, but he was looking straight ahead and his face didn’t give anything away.
“I’m alright! Ron, look I’m fine – Luna fixed my legs, I’m fine.”
“What’s going on with you and Hermione?” asked Ron suddenly.
Draco was just as fast, he had kept his wand ready and the spell bounced off, but Potter was already stepping over the shiny, black puddle on the floor. He grabbed Draco’s collar and pushed him backwards, rage in his eyes, curses on his lips and his wandpoint inches from Draco’s face. Everyone in the room had to be watching them, but no one intervened, and for just a second real fear gripped him, because Potter was furious and Draco had no idea what he might do.
He sat up slowly and reached out to draw back the curtains. He welcomed the uncomfortable brush of cold air as he slipped out of the covers. A bit of moonlight fell through the windows and he could see the dark outlines of the other four poster beds as he made his way to the bathroom.
Harry cleared his throat.
No one answered that – or if they did it was drowned out by the loud hiss of one of Pansy’s spells being swallowed by Ginny’s protective charm. And Draco had to admit that he was slightly impressed that she was holding her ground. He would have pegged Ginny as the best duellist of the lot, but Pansy was keeping up with her, even if there was a sheen of sweat on brow and her movements looked frantic where Ginny’s were rapid and certain. He gripped his wand tighter, knowing Longbottom was right and that Weasley was too, but Pansy would tire out soon and watching the furious look on Ginny’s face, he wasn’t sure she would stop when she did. He watched Pansy dancing around, half dodging half deflecting the barrage of spells hitting her, fighting for the chance to cast a shot, then noticed the movement out of the corner of his eye and reacted before he could think, dragging Longbottom’s arm down and holding on to his wrist to keep his wand pointed to the ground.
“That is none of your business,” Draco spat. “Why do you even care?”
“Thanks.”
“I’m really sorry,” she said. “But I have some homework for charms I haven’t had time to finish.”
“What are you doing?” she asked.
Malfoy shot him another irritated glance.
“Before what?” he asked.
“You’re a terrible friend,” she said to the ceiling. “Totally useless.”
Maybe he was wrong, maybe there was nothing to worry about.
“What the hell, Potter-“
“Really?” he said, trying not to sound disappointed.
something. Potter hadn't actually wanted to kiss him. Because Potter still hated him. And Potter wasn't gay. Draco knew that. He knew
“Doesn’t sound very likely,” said Ron.
“Why would they be?” she asked.
He hadn’t actually planned on casting his own patronus. He hadn’t thought Malfoy would be interested, it wasn’t like he needed proof that Harry could do it, but of course now it seemed obvious that he would expect a demonstration. Not that that was a problem, of course. It just wasn’t always easy to be mentally prepared for Malfoy. He oscillated between brooding bitterness and aloof indifference, and then suddenly this nice, normal bloke would emerge and make jokes and drawl sarcastic compliments, that were still compliments, and basically asking Harry to show off. It was confusing to say the least.
”Draco, are you alright?” said a voice that still sounded far away.
Malfoy was wearing a mildly condescending smile.
“He had it tough last year,” interrupted Pansy. “I remember him, he- not that that excuses anything. But it’s good if Blaise can talk to him. They need to realize we’re not fighting anymore.”
“You’re angry,” he said.
“I’m not asking you to do anything,” said Harry. “I just wanted to tell you. So you’d know. I feel awful about it, like I’m betraying you and Hermione, but I’m not… I don’t think I’m doing that by being friends with him. I don’t think it works like that, so I don’t think I
He didn’t take his eyes of Lucius. Narcissa nodded once and reached for the door.
”Yes, I think now would be a really good time.”
Malfoy hesitated, then glanced past Harry out into the sad, wet street.
“No, I’m serious, Malfoy, I actually want to know. If you were able find it, it might not take long for some tabloid journalist to dig it up-”
"I think you can let go of me now," Draco said, trying to make his breathlessness sound like a laugh. "I trust you to stay vertical on your own."
He hadn’t been staring, but when he entered the Great Hall, his eyes had sought Potter out at the Gryffindor table. They had exchanged what felt like a meaningful glance, except he wasn’t sure what they had been trying to say. And then when he sat down at the Slytherin table he found he could still see Potter, and he had caught the git looking at him three times so far, which was unnerving.
“You too, Potter,” he says.
“Pansy?”
“Holy shit!”
Harry left her there and walked down the hall after the others.
“No? I heard the Gryffindors get drunk on Hogsmeade trips as soon as they’re old enough to go.”
“I don’t know if it does, it’s just that I think that’s what I’m afraid of,” he said. “I don’t want that. Can you imagine if we all came back to that platform some day, content and married with our own kids, and all of my friends were still Slytherins and yours were all Gryffindors? Just the fact that we don’t stop belonging to the houses even when we leave school... I can’t stand that thought. The
There was more than a hint bitterness in that last comment, but he ignored it. She gathered up her books and he removed the silencing charm.
“We have a plan.”
He just nodded. Remembered red blood swirling over a waterlogged bathroom floor. He took another swig of his beer.
Potter closed his eyes again.
“We’re talking now.”
“I thought we would be faster,” she hissed back. “But we don’t need to be five people to do the runes. It’s ineffeicient.”
“I need to go pick up a book from the library,” he said.
Draco shrugged.
“Hello, professor,” said Seamus.
“That would be nice.”
“Yet judging from the students who are actually in your house, the sorting hat doesn’t seem to care very much about that distinction, does it?”
“Goodnight.”
“That doesn’t explain why you-“
Harry shrugged and looked away. It wasn't like he hadn't thought about it when Ginny signed with the Harpies. He probably could have gotten a spot on any team he wanted. That’s what people had said, anyway. But he would never know if it was because he was actually good enough, or just because he was famous. Because he was a
He felt a thrill as he turned his eyes to one of the crowded corridors at the other end of the castle and saw that the dots there were moving around, each of them labelled with a student’s name.
"I think I deserve some peace and quiet, actually."
“Yeah, if the choice is between spending the night battling whatever dark shit Sirius’ family has stowed away up there or going to a pub, I think I actually do prefer Malfoy.”
"If anyone saw, they'll probably assume they were hallucinating."
“Did it – did it work?” asked Granger, forever the practical one; she wouldn’t pretend to be more worried than necessary.
“He’s on his own so he could have been telling the truth, but what do you think they could have fought about?”
“What are you doing?” he whispered.
“Ron hasn’t noticed yet.”
“She’s fine,” Harry said. “She got hurt, but she’s fine. She was right behind us.”
She patted his arm and crossed the common room to the stairs to her dormitory. Draco watched her leave, then headed for his own bed.
"They send you leaflets if you rent a muggle flat?" Harry asked.
“Oh,” he said. “That… are you serious?”
"I suppose."
“Oh, right. Good luck with that.”
He nodded.
“They’re not muggle lockpicks, alright, so calm the fuck down,” sneered Ginny.
?” said Ron. “Sorry if I’m repeating myself here, Harry, but
“Well that doesn’t necessarily mean-“ Tracey began, but then Nott interrupted her, speaking up for the first time since Draco came in.
"I'm still kind of shocked Draco has normal friends," Irie said, dragging his attention back to the table.
against any of the aurors in Azkaban.”
"There you go again," Malfoy sighed with exasperation. "Being perfectly humble. Bragging a little bit doesn't
"So talking to Potter
“Why, did you put something in it?”
Draco sighed.
“Oh. No, I’ll come.”
“Yeah, I wouldn’t do that.”
“Maybe it just does it for people who fit into more than one house.”
The kitchen smelled of burnt toast. Ron was fiddling with the ancient stove when Harry showed up.
It was impossible to tell who won the race and the wind was rushing too loudly past their ears for either boy to hear the other’s cry of victory. Harry slowed down and dipped closer to the trees. A few of the highest branches brushed his feet. Malfoy flew to his side but kept just a few inches higher.
“I thought you would have moved abroad,” he said, putting the beer back down.
One day a third person’s handwriting began appearing on his and Granger’s notes, making strange connections from the contradicting information from different sources. He mentioned it to Pansy, and she said she had seen Lovegood up there once or twice, messing with their notes. After that, he generally ignored the additions.
“I’m sorry I didn’t warn you.”
“Draco, does this have anything to do with-“
“Let’s go,” she said. “You need Madam Pomfrey to do something about your hands.”
Hermione and Luna were waiting for them by the side of the road. They looked tense but determined and just seeing them took the edge off Harry’s own nerves.
“I suppose we are,” she said.
Harry took a step closer to Draco. Draco couldn’t look at him.
"Really? He doesn't talk much about his friends but the ones we've heard of all have super pretentious names."
The Weasley’s took up positions by the door. It had taken forever to decide who should stand guard in case the aurors followed them. Ginny had been an obvious choice, since she was the strongest duellist, but Ron had plainly refused to stay behind and had looked like he wanted to punch Draco’s teeth out when he had called him their best “supporting duellist”. Ginny had asked for Longbottom, but he was better with the runes than Ron was, so in the end he had sided with Draco, as had Granger, and Ron had reluctantly agreed to guard duty.
And when there finally was a pause, Harry thought Malfoy might be about to say something or ask him something that would require thinking on Harry’s part, so he suggested that they went back. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed in the dungeon, only that they probably ought to leave soon. It still felt cowardly to have said it, but Malfoy just nodded.
A loud, mechanic beeping interrupted him and they both started. A second of silence and then it beeped again. Malfoy slid back to the floor and hurried to the door. He pressed the little button on the speaker.
,” she said.
“Nothing, nothing!”
“Follow me,” he muttered in the general direction of Draco and his mother, then pushed past them with his patronus leading the way.
“Ron, I think Harry is right,” said Hermione. “I don’t think Malfoy is lying about having been to Azkaban. I’m not so sure about whether he wants it destroyed or if he wants to free his father or something else – it
They kept at it for over an hour. Malfoy picked new memories, Harry corrected his stand and his grip on the wand. They took a break, then tried again. Finally, he managed to produce a thin, silvery mist. They stopped after that.
“You mind side-alonging me?” Pansy asked Draco. “I’m a bit worn out.”
"Did Hermione leave already?"
“Can I sit?” he asked.
Draco hesitated.
Harry scoffed.
A couple of Hufflepuffs were heading in the other direction down the corridor, and the Slytherin group contracted to give them space. The Hufflepuffs lowered their voices when they passed, which Draco probably wouldn’t have noticed if one of the girls hadn’t suddenly raised her voice in the middle of a sentence, highlighting two words for their benefit:
The look he got was searing.
She cut him off:
They were in some obscure, hidden room on a non-existing floor that was possibly somewhere near the Northern Tower, or at least that was where the entrance had been. It was furnished like a small living room with a thick carpet on the floor, an ancient couch, where Draco and Pansy had seated themselves, a couple of armchairs, and a low table between them. Draco had no idea how Potter had found the place; he seemed to have a ridiculously extensive knowledge of the secret rooms at Hogwarts. He had pulled Draco aside after transfiguration and asked him to meet him there. It had taken him a while to explain how to find the room and get the entrance to open, and he hadn’t given any other details.
"I'm fine."
“Finished what?”
“Yeah, I heard him a little while ago.”
“It’s what Dumbledore wanted.”
"They're my muggle friends. From work."
Draco smirked.
“But I imagine you’re hosting Dumbledore’s Army’s preparty now that you have developed such a great love for firewhisky?”
“I’ve changed my mind,” said Malfoy. “Go back down to Gryffindor. I just realized I prefer to drink alone.”
“Bad news?” he asked.
He said it heavily, more to Granger than any of the others – those had been her arguments. She shrugged.
"Are you dying?" Draco asked.
“Of course I’ll come. I have to protect you from yourself. But if we get charged with treason I was under the
," he muttered.
Her eyes slid from him to the rest of them.
“What’s Zabini going to do with him?” asked Harry.
His robes caught flame even before it reached him, and then it engulfed his whole body and the flames were wrenched apart, losing all semblance of an animal. Tongues of fire shot out and coursed and curled along the body, and for a moment the body in the middle of the inferno seemed completely unharmed. Then Harry screamed: “Down!”, and Draco didn’t have time to react before the blast wave hit him in the chest and threw him to the floor. White hot pain shot through his shoulder and it was all he could do to still hold on to his wand. The world dissolved in the roar from the explosion.
"Sneaking into Hogsmeade on weekends to go shopping? Breaking curfew literally every school year?"
He handed Harry the letter.
“Well-“
It turned out Draco did, and it took only a couple of minutes to wipe the memories of the four aurors. Draco took care of the two who had collapsed the farthest from them, Hermione the ones right where they stood. Once it was done, a strange quiet settled among  them. They stood close together next to the bodies of the stunned aurors, hurt and exhausted and right by the door that would lead them out, but none of them moved to leave.
He unhooked the end of the rope that closed it off, then fastened it behind him. The library at Hogwarts held one of the most extensive collections of magical texts in all of Britain, so of course there were quite a few books there that weren’t fit for children, and the restricted section was pretty big.
“I ran into him right outside the common room last night.”
Sound didn’t travel far in Azkaban. If the acoustics had been normal, the tower would have been filled with noise from the prisoners, who were crying, whining or babbling incomprehensibly. In one cell, someone was screaming their head off, stopping for breath and then screaming again. He didn’t look. As soon as they had passed a few cells further down, they couldn’t hear it anymore. It might be the ancient magic that swallowed the sound. Or perhaps it was the dementors.
Draco doesn’t expect it to ever happen again, but he knows he’ll probably be wanking to the memory for the next ten years of his life. He casts a silencing charm on his bed that night and comes way too fast.
“It’s so stupid. I just thought it was like that for everyone else too. I’m just trying to-”
to be friends with him? You hardly talk to us anymore, and I don’t know why. After the war-“
"He really is an idiot, isn't he?" said Pansy thoughtfully. "You know, sometimes I think the two of you deserve each other."
“Well, you were a right arsehole for not telling us that Malfoy and Parkinson would be there, but we all heard Malfoy’s story, and Hermione thinks he’s right that we have to do something about it,” said Ginny.
After potions when everyone else was packing up, Draco left his things by his desk and walked to the Gryffindor side of the classroom. The Weasley girl was the first one to notice him.
“Do you miss Snape?”
Harry's hands curled into fists in his pocket and his jaw tightened. For a second he had actually been relieved when Malfoy caught up with him, but - it was one thing to know in the quiet of his mind that he was being pathetic, thinking of going somewhere else to drink by himself, but that didn't give Malfoy any right to mock him for it. They had been perfectly polite to each other all evening, and sure he had been desperate to get out of the house, but it suddenly seemed like the stupidest decision he had ever made, he didn't want his
“I came back! I was here for the battle and I was here every year before that, I started the D.A., so don’t talk to me like I don’t know anything-“
"You have got to start living a more interesting life, Potter. The poor reporters are practically starving. Maybe I should leak your address after all. You know, just to spice things up."
“’Morning,” Harry said. “So we’re sitting here today?”
“Sorry,” he said.
“I know.”
Ginny crossed her arms. She was taller than Parkinson. She was using that height difference, looking down at her like she was something disgusting. Parkinson’s knuckles were white.
So that was one thing that was different. There were other things about being back that were almost unbearably normal. They had patched the castle up over the summer, and you hardly ever found physical signs of the battle. The first years still got lost on the upper floors, the prefects still got lost trying to find them and next to him, Ron and Hermione were bickering about homework, their voices slowly rising above the otherwise peaceful breakfast conversation:
“Draco,” said Matthew. “Everything alright?”
“Shut up you fucking mud-“
“Liar.”
“Yeah well, the guy’s an idiot, I’m just saying you shouldn’t waste your time on him, Harry.”
“Don’t apologize.”
Harry had just turned away to go back down the stairs when he heard the lock snap and the door was yanked open.
Pansy cast nervous glances back up at the castle when they passed over the grounds. All the windows were dark, and even if someone had been looking out, Draco doubted they would have noticed the tiny dark figures making their way towards the gates.
“I can see why she would.”
“How do you know that?”
It was only a small cut, really, and the burn wasn’t so bad either. That was what Madam Pomfrey had told him when she said he had to wait until after classes before she would have time to fix his hands. He thought it should be considered a valiant show of dedication to the cause that he went to see Granger before heading to the Hospital Wing.
Her frown deepened.
Harry shrugged.
“It is,” said Potter.
“Stop that,” she said. “Really. Being heroic doesn’t suit you. Besides, we’re not the heroes, remember?”
They don’t need to talk. At this point, there is nothing to say. Potter has his girlfriend and his mission, he doesn’t want revenge and Draco isn’t asking for forgiveness. Potter doesn’t want him here, nobody wants him here, but that’s how it has to be. It’s temporary. And if Potter would just leave him alone, they should be able to manage fine. Instead he is here again, in Draco’s space, with his stupid hair and his stupid face and his stupid muggle clothes.
He laughed nervously. It felt ridiculous saying it aloud. He shouldn’t have told her. But Luna didn’t laugh. She watched him with a puzzled expression and a glassy look in her eyes.
“Yes, but this is Malfoy, he was probably just being an idiot. It was obviously a joke.”
“I know that.”
“Hi – I thought you’d have all gone to bed by now?” Harry said and tried not to sound accusatory, even though the whole scene felt unnervingly like an ambush.
“It’s bloody unfair is what it is,” said Ron, turning to Harry. “Why don’t they have a ward to keep the blokes out of each other’s beds too?”
. Everything between them is so tangled, so twisted up in Harry’s head, with shame and secrecy and guilt. He doesn’t even know what Malfoy is to him anymore, he’s not sure he wants to know, but hating him simply for being the bully he was, for being a spoiled kid, that feels like a distant childhood memory, like something that happened to someone else. These weeks at the burrow, Malfoy’s presence has been both an all-consuming haunting and utterly insignificant next to prophecies and missions and death and heavy responsibility.
“I’m fine.”
"About the flat. I know it's shitty, and you're wondering why I live here. You don't have to pretend otherwise."
He breathed out deeply and closed his eyes for a moment. Why had it all turned out this way? This was never how his life was supposed to go. He wasn’t supposed to end up like this, penniless and lonely and queer and living like a squib, slowly losing contact with all of his old friends and on top of all that, still unable to get over his stupid school time crush.
“Thanks, Ginny,” said Harry.
“What’s up with her?” Longbottom continued, nodding towards Pansy.
Harry didn’t say anything. Malfoy’s apprehension was a physical thing in the silence. It would be so easy to just… but it didn’t seem right to dismiss it all just like that, even if it was coming from Malfoy. He remembered what it had felt like when he carried the locket that had been Voldemort’s horcrux. He remembered what it had done to Ron too, being that close to something evil. And he found that he was already starting to believe what Malfoy was telling him about Azkaban.
Potter leaned in - for a second Draco thought he had just stumbled again. Then he realized that he hadn't, and it was too late to do anything about it. And Potter kissed him. Draco froze. Potter's fingers were tight around his arm, his lips were slow and soft. There was no air in Draco's lungs. His brain had died. He was having several heart attacks at once.
“Close to four,” said Harry.
"I went home after the trials. Then I decided that I would prefer not to live there any longer."
Maya peeked out from her hands.
“Did she just…?” Pansy asked.
They turned around and walked back down the corridor the same way they had come.
“It was a pretty short chapter, you can probably skim through it in the beginning of class,” said Daphne.
He opened his mouth and a piece of chocolate was pushed between his lips.
“You’d be an uneven number without me. I want to help, I already told you that. And you’ll need my moral support when you get your ass handed to you by a Weasley.”
It got easier after the second beer.
Draco woke up in a bad mood. The dull sting of the failure of the night before still lingered in his gut. The flat was cold, the sky outside heavy and grey, the light somehow lightless. He flipped back his covers, stumbled to his closet, pulled out his black shirt, his black jeans. He let his fingers brush over the soft, expensive fabric of the robes on the hangers, not worn once in several weeks, and the last time it had just been for that one evening at Pansy's place. He missed wearing wizard's clothes. There were practical advantages to muggle fashion - he did not fancy facing the tube rush hours in a cloak - but at least they were
"Sorry, mate."
Potter spat – he actually spat – on the ground beside him and wiped his mouth with a look of shocked disgust and near sobriety. Draco sat up with as much dignity as he could manage.
His detention dragged on forever. He had somewhat suspected that this would be about the war, that secretly there was something the headmistress wanted to talk to him about, but she just had him practice his transfigurations for an eternity while she graded essays. She hardly looked up at him, except for once, when he rolled up his sleeves and she got a glimpse of the mark on his arm. Of course she knew it was there, but the disgust was still evident on her face and he felt his stomach churning and a stab of shame went through him when he met her gaze. He quickly returned to his spells, and she moved on to the next essay. It was past midnight when she finally let him go, and he was so tired he was sure he would be able to sleep for two whole days when he got back to his dorm.
"Well. That's unnecessarily harsh," he said, but not like it actually bothered him.
He still wasn't looking at her. He kept his eyes on his hands as he buttoned up his coat, but he could feel her looking at him, could feel the disapproving frown like a tremor in the air between them.
have the right to say shit like that.”
“Fuck that.”
She was stabbing at him, but he tried to appreciate it. It would only get worse when they arrived at the school, so he might as well try to get used to it.
“And you think we do?”
it’s not as simple as they’re making it out to be!”
Hermione turned to Harry and Ginny.
gotten used to a life without phones a long time ago. He looked around for a quill and something to write on. He scribbled
. We’re going to go mad down here.”
"Uh, because they have good drinks and that's where we're most likely to find a party?" she said.
"Thanks."
"I can't believe you're gay," he muttered.
When Cho kisses him, Harry has a note from Draco burning in his pocket, and that night he doesn’t go.
“It’ll be fine,” she said, her voice rough and unconvincing. “I need Madam Pomfrey, but I’ll be fine.”
“I know, Draco.”
Malfoy picked up a handful of the dried, purple flowerheads, which was apparently the last ingredient he was missing.
Granger shrugged.
“Hermione! Hermione, are you alright?” Harry called.
She nodded and looked down at her book. Then she put it aside with a heavy sigh.
“Yeah,” he said and finished the bow he had stopped halfway through.
“Surprisingly brave of you not to listen. I’ve seen her cursework. Bloody terrifying.”
It wasn’t just him – Hogwarts was different this year. For one thing, the division of houses had weakened dramatically. Harry and his dorm mates all found seats at the Gryffindor table, but around them were just as many blue and yellow ties and badges as there were red. Many of them were former members of the Dumbledore’s Army that had reformed in his absence under the leadership of Ginny, Neville and Luna. Some of them were the same as when Harry had been leading the group, but many were new. There were kids from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff whose names he wasn’t even sure of who were closer to Neville and Luna than Harry had ever been himself, and little kids who approached Ginny with things that Harry thought they should have gone to their prefects about, until he saw how familiar she was with them. He had been pretty surprised that Padma Patil had visited the Burrow while he stayed there over the summer, but apparently her and Ginny were friends. And now that people no longer cared so much about being seated according to housing, it seemed silly that they ever had. It had never been a rule that you had to sit at your house table except for the feasts at the beginning and end of the year, during the sorting and the announcement of the winners of the house-cup.
“But if the aurors say they saw us, we’ll probably be questioned, and the investigation will focus on people who might have been able to get a hold of hair from all of us. And even if they don’t suspect us, if they recognized Malfoy, that could be a problem…”
“All you’ve done this year is denounce everything we did last year, all those things we
“We’re doing it all wrong.”
She scoffed at him and left. The door had hardly closed behind her before it was pushed open from the other side and Nott came in. He looked back over his shoulder, then at Draco.
I am very pleased to tell you all that I have in fact not passed away since the last chapter was posted, I still exist out here in the aether. I've finished the last chapters now and they'll be up as soon as I've edited them. I'm quicker at editing than writing, so hopefully this will have been the last endless wait.
“I hate horses. I hate
Draco had returned to Hogwarts, but he was a ghost. He went mechanically through the motions of the day. He felt as if he had not woken up in the morning and was living in a sleepwalking state until he could go back to sleep at night. It had been more than a week since Azkaban, and it was as if he still hadn’t recovered. He still felt the dementor’s clammy grasp on his mind. He was not awake when his eyes were open. He was not sure he wanted to wake up. He thought there was something waiting for him when he did.
“Not because of him.”
"No, I guess not,” he said. “I just thought the place might hold some bad memories for you."
“Kind of weird, though,” said Dean. “Seems to me he’s mostly left everyone alone this year, especially since he came back after the holidays. Why would he suddenly get in your face?”
“You know I’ve been teaching Malfoy the patronus charm, right?”
“Being polite?”
”Yes, it was.”
“You were right, he’s a git. I don’t know what I was thinking.”
“I hope you come to your senses soon,” he said. “As soon as this whole thing with Azkaban is over, I’d like it if we never have to deal with him again”
“Your grades have dropped dramatically compared to previous years,” she began. “And you hardly ever participate in class anymore. I have noticed this during my own lessons as well. I know you’re very skilled in transfiguration, but it seems you’re not even trying. And your written assignments have, as you know, been far below your usual standard. There is also the issue of you skipping classes. As far as I can tell, this has been an especially big problem for my lessons, and I wonder why that might be?”
“Are you sure we don’t need to talk this through? You looked horrified for a moment, I’m sorry I didn’t realize this was a big thing, but...”
“We’re not,” said Harry, shooting Ron an angry look. “I thought we finished this yesterday.”
It’s only when the Minister has left the house that Ginny gives Harry her present.
“She’s a nice girl. I didn’t know she played quidditch. Do you think maybe we should head back soon?”
“Were you marking where to put the runes?” he asked finally, gesturing to the drawings.
“Well, all the ones that might be relevant.”
“Right," he said. "I guess that's my fault for being late.”
“Weasley?” he called.
“Why would he lie about this?”
Ron frowned.
Nothing happened. Only then did he allow himself to scream. He kicked angrily at his bed and then his empty suitcase under it. He threw his wand on the bedside table and started beating one of his pillows, sinking his fist into it again and again and again, and it did nothing to ease the twisting anger in his stomach or the burning humiliation stretching under his skin.
“You’ve been defending him an awful lot too.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, but Potter wasn’t looking at him. Still, this was interesting. He couldn’t remember ever overhearing Potter telling his friends off or assuming any sort of authority over them. This was what he must have been like when they held all their secret meetings during fifth, he had wondered how he had managed to lead anything that called itself and army.
“Holding up,” he said.
Malfoy cut him off: "I'm not going to tell. I'm sure yesterday must have been an exceptional low-point in your life, but I can assure you, it wasn't exactly one of my proudest moments either. I don't have any interest in this getting out. If we're lucky, nobody saw us, and your little deviation from the narrow path of heterosexuality will remain a secret, alright?"
He allowed himself to watch Potter for a moment – the sharp lines of his face, the way his hair had grown too long and was curling around his ears. The way he held himself, like someone who had had to carry heavy things his whole life, but with his uncrippled conscience shining out of him. And he thought that maybe he was an idiot, but really it wasn’t so strange that he was in love with him. It was just a natural extension of his jealousy, crossing the thin line between wanting to be him and just wanting him. Wanting to be liked by him. And of course he couldn’t have that. It was not a constructive feeling. It would only get in the way, and he did not need that. So he folded it up and put it away in a corner of his mind where it would not bother him. He would leave it there until it went away.
”You know if you’re not…” he began but trailed off.
“What, because of Dean and Seamus? Don’t you have silencing charms on the beds?”
“Christ, Harry, what happened to your face?” asked Dean, turning around in his chair.
“In Wiltshire?”
“Is this the last time you’ve called me a Death Eater?”
He didn’t return to the tower until late, and when he did, he was relieved to find the common room empty. He was almost at the stairs to his dormitory when he heard a noise behind him and started.
“I’m not.”
He’s aware that he’s probably doing an incredibly shitty job, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind, he gasps the second Harry touches him, he’s ridiculously hard and every time Harry moves his hand to stroke him, he’s rewarded with another soft moan. It doesn’t take long before he comes, shaking in Harry’s arms.
Each word was warm against Draco’s neck. Draco had had the same thought. He had had it over and over this year and the years before, had dreamt up quite a few scenarios of it, but they all depended on him being a smarter, better and kinder person than he had been.
“Oh,” he said. “It’s you.”
The part of himself that could objectively monitor his actions was disgusted with this development. The imaginary version of Pansy that lived in his head was gagging. He was very aware of how pathetic this all was.
"Uh, yeah, it's… yeah. I mean we're still friends," he added. "So I don't… I don't mind. Is all. That's what I meant."
it says that as far as she can tell the number of dementors has increased since wizards started putting prisoners in the tower.”
“I assume you’ve realized you can’t have Death Eaters going to your school,” he said. “It makes perfect sense, so there’s no need to pretend otherwise.”
“He watched Bellatrix torture me,” Hermione said.
"It might be a couple of hours."
It was odd that neither Ron or Hermione seemed to have noticed his weird behaviour, but then Hermione had seemed a bit off as well, and he knew Ron was worried about her.
Harry glanced down at his watch. It had been hardly twenty minutes. He wasn't sure if it would be rude to leave already, but if Malfoy had said what he wanted to say-
That night it had all become so real to him, what they were doing. Right now they were able to keep it a secret, but that couldn’t last. Harry wasn’t good with secrets. Sooner or later they would have to give it up or they would have to tell people. And so while Draco slept, Harry had made up a scenario; challenged himself to envision the most impossible situation as possible. He had set it in a distant future when they would all be more grown up and the war wouldn’t be looming as close. He had tried to imagine what it would be like if Draco came with them to the burrow. He did it carefully, constructing all the little details of the story – how nervous he would be; how Draco’s fingers would flick to the cuff of his left sleeve the way they sometimes did when he was stressed. Harry could see how he would become smaller in Mrs Weasley’s kitchen, how out of place he would look in all that homely clutter. He would be wearing his expensive robes, but his shoulders would fold in, the elbows held close to the body like sparrow’s wings, flighty and tense, every joint strained against the pull of his good upbringing, that had taught him to hold his head high and keep his back straight. A privileged upbringing where he had learned how to suavely converse with politicians, but not how to humbly enter a house where he wasn’t welcome.
Malfoy laughs, short and dry.
"What does everyone want?" he asked.
“Of course.”
"Fuck you," Malfoy said, and then the world dropped away.
“And now you’re, what, snogging in secret in between classes? Having clandestine meetings at night?”
"I think we're good," said Harry.
Now, however, every sentence that crept over Malfoy’s lips was sleek and glossy and Harry had no idea what their conversation was even about or why they were sitting there, drinking firewhisky together as if they were friends.
“Remember third year?” he asked. “When they had dementors surrounding the grounds? And they let them onto the train?”
Students of Hogwarts were not allowed to leave the school grounds except for Hogsmead weekends or with special permission, but as he rushed through the air and left the castle further and further behind, Harry decided that he deserved to take advantage of the fact that for the first time in seven years there was no immortal, dark wizard out there plotting to kill him.
There were nods and shrugs all around. He wasn’t surprised; he hadn’t expected Blaise to keep quiet about his nightmares.
"Sorry."
Harry could feel his heart in his throat.
"Well that's hardly my fault, is it?" Draco sneered.
"And I've been back to Hogwarts a couple of times," he added. "Helped out with the reconstruction, stuff like that. They're pretty understaffed this year, so there's been lots to do."
“Now?”
“Practising duelling,” she said and walked away from him.
She took it, grimacing as her burned fingers closed around it.
“Mr Potter, can I have a quick word with you?”
He could tell Ron that much.
She passed him another cup with a nearly illegible name scribbled on it. He mechanically pumped in the syrup and steamed the milk and went to pass it to one of the customers hovering by the counter.
“Fuck off,” said Potter.
Harry hesitated.
Her eyes darted between them and he thought he could almost hear her brain whirring away. He stood up. Hermione’s eyes finally settled on Harry and she looked like she wanted to say something else, but then she shook her head and turned to Draco instead.
Harry snorted. Draco looked back towards the castle.
"Fuck you," Harry mumbled at his knees. "I'm just dizzy. I need to sit down."
“Malfoy, what are you-“
She bolted upright, startling both him and Granger. Draco felt an excited twist in his gut even though he tried to suppress it – this was Lovegood after all, her excitement was bound to be as illogical as everything else about her. She scooted to the edge of the sofa so she could lean over the table with them.
"Why is it so fucking hot in here," Irie muttered.
“All off Slytherin House has lost status because of a few individuals. Of course there are several noble and ancient pureblood houses that are known for their associations with the dark arts, but that’s not the same as supporting a madman like Voldemort. No true noble would ever have become a
“Okay, then,” he muttered and returned to the text.
“Well thanks for that generous lie, Potter, but everybody knows already, so I really don’t think they’ll be interested in the story when you decide to share it,” he hissed, not even able to keep up his indifferent sarcasm. “And I am not trying to show it off, just so we’re clear about that.”
“We need to get back to the others,” he said.
“Potter and Weasley, would you mind being quiet?” said Slughorn loudly. “This is a very delicate and advanced potion, and it is not one you would want to mess up on. Now, when you slice the ginger root-“
“A lot,” she said.
"The White Fox," Tracey said.
“You probably shouldn’t stretch her patience too far.”
was printed in bold letters above her face, and right beneath that was the headline that had left Harry with reporters at his heels every hour of the day for two awful weeks:
“Draco, come on!” Harry snapped.
“Now you should probably get going,” McGonagall said. “I think Mr Weasley and Ms Granger are waiting for you.”
“Look, I’m sorry, you have no idea how sorry I am, but-“
The force of the dementors rammed into his brain like a sledgehammer. He froze in the doorway. Lovegood’s patronus was shielding them, but it couldn’t be as strong as the one of the auror who had escorted him the last time, or maybe it was just that they were more people this time, that it was stretched thin. He felt his energy drain away.
And then, as soon as that thought manifested itself, it made sense, of course. That Draco would be odd in this world which he had, in fact, just dropped into.
"Sure," he said. And then after a moment’s hesitation added: "We could go somewhere else. If you want."
Ron took the frying pan off the heat and scraped scrambled eggs onto a plate.
“My mother is doing very well now, so I wanted to spend some more time with her before I came back.”
“Yeah, but it can’t just be anything, it has to be a powerful memory,” Harry said, hearing Lupin’s voice echoing in his own, hearing himself during fifth when he taught the others.
Harry stared at him.
Draco shrugged.
“I’m sleeping just fine.”
“It’s fine, alright. Look, I’m apparating from right down here, so I’ll see you tomorrow, right?”
She took his hand and Harry looked at Draco.
“Malfoy!”
"Yeah," Potter said, but he didn't move and Draco didn't either.
They worked for a while in silence and when the clock neared nine, Draco started packing up his stuff. Nott looked up.
“They still want to do it. We’ll have another meeting later.”
"What?" Draco said - he hadn't been keeping up with the conversation.
“If there was just some way to get the patronus to
“I really don’t think he is-“ Harry began.
He and Pansy only duelled for a few minutes before she got tired of it and let him disarm her. She walked over to him and he handed her wand back.
angry, and I don’t know why he couldn’t just tell me what his problem was… And then he
“Yeah, I heard you. Azkaban. I don’t even know what to do with that. I feel like an idiot for getting mad at you about New Years, but you should have told me. I can’t believe you told fucking Potter and not me.”
They reached the wall, the stairs, and they climbed slowly upwards. Hermione’s breathing was laboured and gravelly, but she was carrying more of her own weight. When Harry glanced over at Draco, he looked like he was about to throw up again, but also more like himself; less empty. The two patronuses were still with them, Harry’s whole hand was buzzing and as soon as they reached the first landing, they stopped. Hermione disentangled herself from Harry and leaned against the wall breathing deeply. Harry pulled three chocolate bars from his pocket and handed them to the others. Draco took his gratefully and had devoured it before Harry had even gotten the paper off of his. Harry watched him pull a second one from his own pocket.
“Okay.”
“What?”
Then fingers close around Harry’s wrist and guides his hand from where it rested against Draco’s hip to the hard bulge in his trousers. Another nervous surge rushes through Harry, for a moment his hand just rests there. Malfoy is still kissing him and for an awful second, the picture of Ron and Hermione imposes itself on Harry’s mind, what they would think if they saw him like this. He pushes it back. It doesn’t matter. He wants to ask if this is somehow payment for the sectumsempra, if this is supposed to be his apology. It would be such a good excuse for why he isn’t leaving, if he could pretend that he owed Draco this, but then it seems too crude a question even for this ugly thing between them. It’s not that he doesn’t want to touch Malfoy. He does, badly. It’s just that he’s never done it before. All those times in fifth year, it was always Malfoy at some point getting to his knees. Harry would watch him get himself off too, sometimes, but he never touched him, and Draco never asked him to.
He told himself he wasn’t avoiding her when he followed Dean and Seamus down to the pitch to play a bit of practice quidditch with some of the Hufflepuffs. And since he went back to the dining hall with them when they were done playing, it only made sense that he sat with them during the meal. And because she was hanging out with Ron all evening anyway, he went down to the study area on the third floor to do homework rather than staying up in the common room.
“Hey,” he said.
“Still.”
“How have you been?” Malfoy asked, like all they were there for was small talk.
“Yeah, I forgot. You can just go on ahead, I’ll join you later.”
picked out your two best friends on the first day of school when you were
"Right,” she said, ”but I'm sick of you sitting there like you think someone is going to hex you in the back any moment, and you've clearly sobered up too much for your own good, so stop spitting in that empty butterbeer and go get yourself some whisky."
He had come closer; he stood right in front of Harry’s table, leaning forward insistently while he spoke. Harry stared at his potion, which required nothing from him for the next two minutes, hoping Malfoy would soon shut up and go away.
?” said Ron emphatically.
“It’s okay,” said Draco.
At breakfast the morning after Halloween, Draco finally got a letter from his mother. It was very short – she was doing fine, he shouldn’t worry about her and should focus on his schoolwork. He had hoped for more, but at least it was her own handwriting and apart from the briefness there was nothing to indicate that she was not well. He reread it several times throughout the day and was distracted enough during meals that he didn’t actually see Potter until after lunch outside the Potions classroom. When he and the other Slytherins arrived, the hallway was already full of Gryffindors. Slughorn hadn’t shown up yet and the classroom door was locked. Potter stood on the edge of a group, not participating in their conversation. He looked thoroughly annoyed, and Draco sidled up to him.
“Well, if we tell Harry he’ll just want to go immediately. We’ve already been holding back on this for a long time and planning isn’t really his thing, he’ll just want to rush head first into all of this and…”
“Fuck,” he breathes. “I shouldn’t even be here.”
"Everyone, patronuses."
“The dementors. The stairs were packed when we came down, so where are they?”
“Weasley didn’t sound like she was too fond of that idea. It’s only a matter of time before the Gryffindor flock mentality kicks in and Potter goes back to hating you.”
“Right,” he said. “Yeah, we got it sorted out, it was just me being an idiot.”
"Oh, hey, there's Mark," said Irie suddenly, half rising from her chair as far as the table allowed, and waving at someone behind them.
“Fuck you, Potter,” he mumbles, but he still doesn’t leave.
"I mean, in the beginning I was so nervous about cocking it up," Malfoy said, ignoring him. "But it turns out a muggle's natural conclusion to someone saying strange things
“Yeah, Maybe. But Pansy, please don’t tell anyone about it, alright?”
Malfoy let out an exasperated laugh.
She stood up and gathered her things.
“They aren’t noisy sleepers,” said Harry.
“No, why would I be?”
Harry paced the living room as he wondered how long it would take the owl to make it to Malfoy's place.
Harry grimaced. He had gotten somewhat used to people being star struck by him. He was good at shouldering through; enough one-syllable replies usually made people stop. And it wasn't so much that it was bad when people did it, it was just a little embarrassing and it felt undeserved. But this was different. This was the Ministry, acting like the law didn't apply to him just because of who he was - and that wasn't just embarrassing. It made his skin crawl.
He turned towards them.
“See you back there,” he said and then they disapparated.
“I don’t know. I wanted to.”
“Could be,” she said. “You could ask Pansy Parkinson about it, I suppose she would know.”
“That was fucking weird,” he muttered.
Malfoy shot him a look.
“Mine doesn’t either.”
“Didn’t know you were a legilimens,” he muttered.
He was already at the stairs to the next level down.
Pansy nodded.
“Where were you?” she demanded.
Draco knew he had been to the Black family residence as a child, but it was a very long time ago, and none of it looked familiar.
“Let’s go,” he said.
“Fine, just don’t overreact on this, please. If you could just stop making everything about your future political career this wouldn’t be such a big deal.”
“Good.”
“What is this, Potter? A peace-offering?” he said with disbelief.
“Am I?” Harry snapped.
“You’re sure?”
“Because he kissed you,” she said.
, Potter. Merlin, you're so fucking
It was a strange thing to hear him say. Because the tone was so familiar, so similar to the endless, pampered whining Harry had had to endure when they were at Hogwarts together, except it was ironic and self-deprecating and almost… well, it was kind of funny.
