"Yes, Potter," Draco drawled, shaking his head, "when indeed?"
she was wanking off the night of the Yule Ball, now was it?" Blaise pointed out in a mocking tone.
Fucking Merlin, though. Was Draco really there, in the Ministry, voluntarily? Was he really there, in the Ministry, voluntarily, to see
"He's been Obliviated," she said flatly, folding her arms. "I don't know by whom, but I'm familiar enough with the spell that I know that his memory has been tampered with."
Malfoy's lips twitched and Harry's grin widened. "You know, you're lucky the Dark Lord is gone and you can lower your guard. I could have easily killed you a hundred different ways had I been an enemy." At Malfoy's words and sarcastic tone, Harry leant forward and shoved him lightly with one hand.
An interesting wave of both heart-wrenching sorrow at the reminder of her death and intense relief that the list was at an end crashed through Draco's body. "So you're here to what?
"Thank you," Harry whispered, leaning forward to press their foreheads together. "Thank you for letting them stay here and inviting them to hang out with you lot and…I dunno, not insulting them for anything."
Nodding, Harry took a final breath to steel himself before grabbing his winter cloak and marching down the stairs, ignoring the curious glances from the other Gryffindors. There was only a handful in the common room as it was a Saturday afternoon, but every single head seemed to turn to him as one and follow him as he slipped through the portrait hole. The corridor was chilly, and Harry was grateful for the cold. His body felt overheated and far too close to spontaneous combustion. He really hoped he would cool down before Draco caught sight of him. Or before he burst into spontaneous flames. That would be a horrible start to a first date, especially a first date he was looking as forward to as this one.
Biting back a growl and shutting his eyes, he rubbed his temples. God, but how he wanted to escape the deafening pub.
"Bitch," she said, stifling a yawn as she sat up and rubbed her eyes.
"I'm going up for another drink," Harry announced, copying Ron and Vanishing his empty glass. "I'll be back in just a second." Turning away from the group, he made his way across the large room toward the long table laden with glasses.
Luckily for Harry, at that moment a low groan issued from the other boy's mouth, drawing the brunet's immediate attention. "Malfoy?"
Christ, how many rooms did they still have left to check? How many more empty rooms were they still to be met with? What if they couldn't find Stephen? There was no way he could have just disappeared, absolutely no way in hell. And yet…
"Honestly?" Harry sighed, wondering how much he should reveal to Malfoy. "I think it might be both of them. There was something just a bit off about their reactions to the evidence that I can't put my finger on. But we still have no idea where Stephen is. I'm sure that it was either him or Smith who tried to break into your bedroom last night. The room they were staying in is in the same direction whoever it was ran in. It was definitely close to where I heard the door slam. Ron thinks it's Zacharias, but Hermione seems more uncertain." He sighed again, shifting into a more comfortable position. "I know that Ron wants to interrogate them again, so that's most likely what we'll be doing later."
Harry had failed.
. Do you think the nation is going to take kindly to Lucius Malfoy's son becoming romantically involved with their Saviour? Not to mention that he also has the Dark Mark. So you better be serious about this, Harry James Potter, because the papers are going to have a fucking field day when news of this reaches them."
Staring at him, Harry felt a pained twinge echo through his chest. The man looked so out of place and defenseless standing there in his pyjamas with a Bubble-Head Charm around his head, appearing child-like and lost, and looking for all the world like a strange Muggle astronaut.
As Harry pondered how best to respond, Malfoy's expression grew warier and his stance loosened somewhat—he appeared to be readying himself for defeat, as though rejection was the only outcome he thought possible for such a declaration.
feel better because he was far too aware of what he had done. "The
"Draco," he panted, feet planted firmly on the mattress to better help him push up into Draco's body.
"Who has a point?" a voice said above them, and they both glanced up to find Blaise peering down at them. "Are the two of you still talking about knobs?"
Harry stared at her, wondering if he should bother asking what the hell a lurdling was.
"Au contraire, Potter," Zabini disagreed, eyes glinting like steel as he surveyed the Auror. "Moments of true fear are precisely when you should most judge a person, because that is when their true character is really revealed. It's not in moments of calm and peace that tell you who a person truly is beneath their skin. We're never most who we are than in the moments of genuine terror when we are reacting on nothing but pure instinct and self-preservation. That is when all of man's worst traits come to light."
"This is about yesterday, isn't it?" Harry guessed, striding closer and making it hard for Draco to continue not looking at the prat.
Once the owls had flown out of sight and he was satisfied with his appearance, he strolled down the large drive of the Manor, choosing to take the longest route possible to the Ministry. Closing his eyes, he pictured his destination and felt the familiar uncomfortable squeeze that accompanied Apparition.
"You mean blind fucking cowardice," Zabini corrected. "I'm not sure if I've ever met a person so ruled by fear before. He's a danger to everyone around him."
"Well, in the meantime, we have paperwork," Ron grimaced and made a face at the large stack of parchment to his right. Groaning loudly, Harry levitated half the stack onto his desk and grudgingly began.
scared me away," Harry snorted, "If you must know, my shoulder hurts from scoring so many points, actually, so I'm taking a break."
The final three words made Draco's head snap up, eyes wide with shock. "You do?"
"Do you really think this can be fixed?" The question was unexpected and spoken in a quiet voice, surprising Blaise.
He saw Malfoy open his mouth to speak, leaning closer, when suddenly, a glowing Jack Russell Terrier bounded into the room and began speaking in Ron's voice: "Hey, what's happening with Malfoy? Is everything okay? Is Zabini there? I haven't heard from you so I s'pose everything is fine? Lemme know either way."
"Is this what you wanted, Malfoy?" My voice is just as strained. "Is this why you came in here? To end up bent over my desk?" He's making an odd sort of keening noise and I wonder if he might damage the wood of my desk with how hard he's now gripping it. For a few moments, I worry if I might be hurting him, but we both know that if he wants me to stop, all he has to do is say so.
"I'm sure the one and only cunty flamingo resides far, far away from here, in Flamingo Land, where the flamingos live," he told her, voice serious as he patted her arm, and she shoved him away with a roll of her eyes, lips twitching.
"Oh please," Pansy said sarcastically, "as if anybody has ever thanked a person for being allowed to touch somebody else's cock."
"This isn't something to just
Wescott fixed him with a sharp gaze. "Did something happen?"
A relieved smile broke out across Harry's face before he leaned forward to press a very gentle kiss to Draco's mouth, who did not hesitate to kiss back. "Does this mean you'll stay with me?" Draco mumbled against Harry's lips, who nodded as he pressed another kiss to Draco's mouth.
"I will do another interview," Harry threatened, "so help me god. A very unflattering interview."
"I agree," Hermione mused. "It's troubling, to say the least. Why would he need to know where they are unless he was planning on doing something with the information? Why would he feel it worth the risk of wandering around by himself just to learn such a thing unless he was planning on putting the knowledge to use?"
Gregory did not even attempt to hide the surprise he felt at seeing the now-grown Potter. Deciding not to answer him, he turned to Draco instead. "Draco?"
"They don't tell us where they're going," Tracey continued, mumbling her words into the skin of Pansy's throat, "or what they're doing, or if they'll even be home for the night. We don't get to ask questions, we don't get to know anything, and we sure as hell don't get a say in a damned thing that happens in our own lives."
"Draco…" Harry said, feeling nonplussed. Did he really intend for them to have a picnic? Just the two of them? In a beautiful forest miles away from any prying eyes?
"So am I," her smile softened for a moment before widening once more. "After all, where the hell else am I gonna see a bloody merdnerdrine?"
Allowing himself another heavy sigh, he tried to shake off the gloom that had once more settled over him like a creeping cloud, one that seemed to constantly be hanging over his head. He took a step back, preparing to head back inside.
In growing wonderment he watched as Malfoy unlocked his legs from around Harry's waist and lay down on his back on the desk, bending his knees and planting his feet flat on the wooden surface.
At the sound, another blush spilled across Draco's sharp cheekbones as his eyes flicked down to Harry's mouth. Slowly, almost hesitantly, as though he wasn't quite sure he was allowed to do such a thing, Draco brought one hand up to Harry's face, gently cupping his jaw as his grey eyes searched Harry's own with a smoldering intensity that left Harry's heart racing. Gazes still locked, Draco began rubbing circles onto the skin below Harry's ear with one thumb, smiling at the small happy sigh that escaped the brunet.
anyway," she smirked right back, and he glared. "His sad, tiny Hufflepuff knob."
"What did you find from the packages?" Harry asked instead, hoping to get the conversation focused on work rather than Malfoy or the manor.
hero, Harry!"
First—Ron's behavior has been mentioned by several of you. I know that his easy acceptance of practically everything really is pretty damn laid-back, but I figured the story was already dramatic enough without any hypothetical resentment coming from him. Plus, I just see it as petty if he continued to hate Draco through all this bloodshed, grief, and loss. So for the sake of the story, he is Mellow Ron. Also, I feel like a lot of writers tend to make him this inhumanly angry, unforgiving character and I've just never seen him that way. I really rather like the idea of a mature Ronald Weasley. I just can't write the Weasleys in any sort of negative light, they are too dear to my heart.
"No, not Ron, you idiot," Draco snapped, and Harry glared as the same expression from earlier—the one that said that Harry was the world's biggest idiot—crossed Malfoy's pale face once more. "I meant his sister! Obviously," he added, crossing his arms and returning Harry's glare.
"Well, it can't be the second one," Ron frowned. "I mean, Hannah, Mandy, and Terry? Come on, there's nobody who would want to see them dead. Especially over someone like Smith or any of the Slytherins. If we're going in terms of least popular, it'd definitely be that lot at the top of the list."
At her words, Smith flushed, opening his mouth to say god knows what, but a single glare from Ron silenced the annoying blond.
staying with the brunet?
Harry stared at him in silence, his face an unreadable mask. "How do I know you're telling the truth?" he finally asked, staring at Blaise with stony eyes.
"I can see you trying not to smile, Blaise, for fuck's sake."
"They didn't really have any common friends," Harry said. "I mean, Mandy and Terry are both connected to the other Ravenclaws, but I dunno if Hannah was ever really friends with any of that lot."
Harry nodded. He had a lucky pair of Quidditch socks he saved for matches and knew that Ron always played the match following a win with the same pair of Keeper's gloves.
"It'll definitely do," she admires.
"Aldrich Chatham," she told him, still smirking. "He was two years ahead of us, remember? They re-met a few months ago. And damn, is she lucky," Pansy sighed. "He was the tall muscly one with the dark hair."
Draco shrank back, unable to help the shudder that raked through him at the threat. Fenrir wrenched Wire's left arm behind his back, yanking it sharply up to an angle that had to have hurt, and wrestled him through the doorway, shoving him into the hallway. He slammed the door shut on the two men, and the second the door was closed, Draco's knees gave out. He sank down to the floor, feeling dazed and trembling. That brought his grand total of death threats issued within that house in the last twelve hours up to three.
Glancing around, Harry searched for his wand, casting another warming charm over them before pulling Malfoy down to lie side-by-side on the comfortable transfigured floor of the boat they were sat in, feeling it gently rock up and down in the lake as the soft sounds of water slapping against hard rock echoed around the underground harbor. Harry could see a sliver of winter moonlight peeking through the wooden slats of the roof directly above where the two boys lay together, a tiny slice of silver falling down on the two of them.
Well, he knew exactly where he had been, of course. Smirking across the Great Hall or mocking him loudly outside the Potions rooms; selling false stories about him to the Daily Prophet, insulting his best friends, once even breaking Harry's nose.
"Goodnight, then, Harry," Oliver's eyes glittered in the starry purple of the deepening twilight.
something or someone inside, a Dark presence. It was in this hallway." He glanced over his shoulder at the gaping black hole of Daphne's room. "It killed Daphne."
Draco cried out wordlessly as Harry thrust down harder and moved faster, gripping Harry's hips in response and trying to pull him closer against himself. "Fuck, Harry!" he gasped, sparing a second to pray that his silencing charms were still in effect. "Harder!"
. That's all it said."
have a bloody crush on me!"
"I still…" and at that Malfoy looked uncertain, "I still can't find anybody else. But whatever that thing was that was here earlier isn't any longer."
"No, Malfoy," Harry stepped closer, refusing to allow the blond to simply ignore him, "that's not what I meant. Whatever you're thinking I meant just now is
"N-no," he stammered.
They all traded a look. "And you're sure?" Davis asked softly. "You're sure that you can keep us safe?"
Harry shook his head. "Leave it for the seagulls," he said in a low voice, tossing the remaining food and trash aside in a haphazard mess that he promised himself he'd clean up later. Draco sat there watching him, eyes glittering as he looked Harry up and down.
!" His words came in quick gasps as his breaths came faster and faster. "Please, Blaise, just wake up! Open your eyes! I'll forgive you for everything you said, everything you did, it doesn't matter! I'll forgive it all if you just answer me!"
It was a long time before Harry made it back to Gryffindor Tower.
Was Harry really kissing Caelix? And was he actually enjoying it? The kiss was pleasant; it felt nice and Harry could feel himself possibly wanting to deepen it, possibly wanting more. But what about Draco? When Draco had kissed him, it had been electric. It had been consuming, burning, filling Harry's veins with fire and making him feel as if he didn't touch Malfoy, he would have gone mad. Caelix's kisses were somehow different, somehow muted. There was a slow warmth spreading through Harry's body, but it was much milder, much more gradual.
feel this connected to another person.
"Erm," Draco cleared his throat. "Wiltshire, actually." The words were spoken quietly, in a voice that was nearly ashamed, and Harry stared at him in surprise.
"An even funnier thing," Harry continued, "is that there was an actual weapon used this time. A kitchen knife. And, please correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you one of the ones to help clean up after dinner last night and put the dishes away?"
"Stop lying, Blaise! Pay me my Galleon!"
"We could tell you," Blaise said airily, turning his attention back to his plate, "but I'm afraid it doesn't really show any of us in the best light. Especially your boyfriend."
"What?" Weasley asked in bewilderment, dropping the arms he had been flexing over his head and staring at Longbottom in shock. "What do you mean? You're not coming back?"
The song started to lose speed as it began to wind to an end, his fingers drifting slower and slower until with the last melancholy measure it gently faded away, the final note hanging in the air long after Draco stopped being able to hear it.
"It's a good thing you don't scare me then, isn't it, Malfoy?" he said, tilting his head mockingly.
broomstick RIGHT in front of my face! Was that payback, Harry? For the Nimbus's all those years ago?" His voice turned cold and mocking. "Did the two Gryffindors laugh about finally paying me back for when I 'bought my way onto the team'? I'm sure many people find it quite amusing that I can no longer afford a broomstick—divine retribution, yes?"
"What exactly happened?" Draco asked, keeping his back to Potter. "How did she get away?"
"You already did," he reminded the other man coldly. "Right before I started blasting your belongings into ash, remember?"
"What?!" Blaise rounded on her. "Who?! I hadn't heard that! Who the fuck is she dating?!"
which Pans and I still don't understand. What the fuck did you do to him, Potter?" The tall Slytherin stepped forward until he was in the corridor with Harry and the stone wall slid shut behind him. Harry avoided his eye as he tugged harshly at his hair.
"But she's not my Weaselette…er, I mean Ginny… she's not
"Fuck me, Harry," Malfoy whispered.
The longer Draco hesitated, the more Harry seemed to shrink in on himself. "Do you love him back?" he asked softly, snapping Draco's gaze up to finally meet his own once more.
Now for just a real quick WARNING—This chapter contains past child abuse, as well as a bit of gore.
"Course," he grinned and clapped Harry on the back. As he walked away, head held high and back straight, Harry shook his head in amazement at the vast differences between the man Neville had become and the timid boy he had started out as.
Granger and Weasley settled onto their mattress, both casting a final suspicious look around the room before giving in to exhaustion, and Draco could see Harry shake his head in amusement. Reaching down to grasp his hand, Draco pulled Harry over to his bed, tugging two pairs of pyjama bottoms out of his trunk and tossing one pair to Potter, who grinned before beginning to strip, glancing carefully around at the others first to make sure nobody was watching. Climbing into bed, Draco drew the thick curtains, heart suddenly pounding fiercely in his chest—Merlin, he had never shared a bed with anyone before, other than the thirty whole seconds he and Potter had lain together on the stiff mattress the brunet had Transfigured after their first time in the abandoned room in the farthest corner of the dungeons. But that could hardly even count, could it?
"Well, if you're wanting to compare yourself to the Golden Boy," Blaise rolled his eyes, "of course you're going to find yourself lacking, especially in regards to his insane sense of morality. Nobody in the entire nation can measure up to his daft level of selflessness and ethics. He's still just a bloke though, and every bloke wants sex strictly for the sake of sex. Pansy, you're our self-proclaimed resident expert on all things male sexuality, help me out here."
"Less…like this?" The final two words tripped their way free as Harry gestured around himself helplessly.
"Are you all right, Draco?" Luna asked, worry coloring her normally carefree-sounding voice. "We heard you were hurt."
beginning to move his hips.
! Fuck, please don't stop," Draco babbled mindlessly, knowing he was only seconds away from exploding. In the next breath, he clenched his eyes shut tight as an overwhelming wave of pleasure crashed into him, swept over him, submerging him beneath its heavy weight as he twisted and moaned, Harry holding him in place as his mouth slid to the very tip of Draco's cock, sucking softly as Draco bucked his hips before finally sinking back into the mattress, panting breathlessly. "Fuck, Potter," he murmured, feeling his pulse race as he attempted to catch his breath.
He had been forced to accept long ago that that was what fate had in store for him. Maybe if Blaise explained to him exactly what Draco had done wrong, maybe then he could start working to fix it, maybe it wasn't too late to change himself. And maybe then the people in his life would actually stick around. Hopefully, it was not too late to fix himself enough for somebody to love him.
"Right, thank you," said Pickering, sounding relieved. "Scrivens will be right in."
to be the real reason why…" he allowed his words to trail off into a quiet laugh. "At least now I know why you've been dragging your feet so much about getting back together with Ginny. How long have you had a thing for the albino prat, then?"
. They had seen each other nearly every single day for ten years, risked their lives together countless times, had been best mates since the moment they had met. Yet how could Harry tell him about
"Stop it, both of you!" Hermione said sharply, pulling out her own wand. "Nobody is getting locked up and nobody is fighting! And I will personally deal with anyone I find antagonizing anybody else or inciting any sort of panic!"
"No," Draco whispered back, shaking his head. "I want you to keep kissing me. But god, don't stop touching me either."
When Harry awoke the next morning, it was to heavy grey skies and the faint stirrings of a storm breeze. By the time he made it down to breakfast, the enchanted ceiling was beginning to drip rain in desultory silence above their heads. Mumbling a heartfelt
And at the same time, even more than the feeling of uncertainty nearly drowning him, was rising up in Draco from some deep dark recess within him, higher and higher, an inky black wave of guilt threatening to engulf him whole. How could Harry love him without knowing the truth about their relationship? If Harry knew the truth…if he knew that Draco had only ever approached him and spoken to him and flirted with him in a misguided and selfish attempt to manipulate him into being in a romantic relationship with Draco just so the blond could earn back even a few discarded scraps of his tattered reputation…he would never speak to Draco again. He would hate Draco. He would most likely never even so much as look in Draco's direction ever again. Draco knew how much Harry feared the idea of the people in his life—especially the people he trusted—ever using him for their own gain; he knew how much Harry could not stand the thought of being used.
"You didn't rape anybody, Harry!" Hermione said in a firm voice, continuing to rock him. "You
"I was wondering if you could try and find out for me," said Harry. "Find out where he's been, what he's been up to, who he's been seen with, that sort of thing."
"Shit, Seek, we gotta go," Ron said urgently, tugging at Harry's arm, and Harry turned to see Fred and George already sitting on one motorcycle. George was sat on the back, sagging against Fred, and Harry felt fear spike his gut at the sight. What was wrong? Was George injured? But Fred took off before Harry could get a sense of what had happened, and Ron distracted him by tugging on his arm harder. "Come on!" he said, and this time, Harry didn't hesitate to race over to his bike, sparing one last glance for Wolf before starting the engine. Wolf was standing, body tense as he cradled his injured arm to his side. Harry allowed himself a smirk of triumph as he wondered if Wolf would manage to stay on his bike riding injured and one-handed, because Harry already knew there was no way in hell Wolf would leave his bike behind in Hallows' territory.
Harry nodded his head reluctantly, hesitation slowing his every move. Fuck, why wasn't he pushing Malfoy away and storming from the room? Why was he standing there admitting to things he didn't want to admit to and did not even want to acknowledge?
"I…" Caelix tucked his bangs behind one ear nervously and took a deep breath before stretching out one hand to stroke his fingers down Harry's cheek, so lightly that Harry almost didn't feel it. "I'll see you later, P." And with that, he was gone, already past the balcony doors and striding across the room.
"Are we going to drink or what?" Weasley interrupted, sounding exasperated. "Why do we even have to play a game?"
"Lack of subtlety and bad hair?" Draco guessed, feeling breathless as Potter trailed a line of kisses along his jaw.
"And there you go again," Draco shook his head in pity and no small amount of disgust. "Always thinking you are in control of every situation, even in a place such as this. Have you not looked around yourself? Do you not see where you are? You gave up any claim to fatherhood over me years ago when you endangered my life and nearly got your wife and son killed so many times that I've honestly lost count. You think I'm a terrible, selfish son? Well, I think you're even worse as a father."
If Harry had been capable of being amused, he would have laughed at how high-pitched Ron's voice had gone.
"Sorry to have to end the mystery right here," Harry cut in, squeezing Draco's hand, "but Draco is the list, I'm afraid. You can be on part two of the list," the brunet allowed.
"So how was it then?" Blaise asked, and Draco tried his best to ignore the smirk in Blaise's voice. And the smirk on Blaise's annoying smirking face. "What kind of kisser is Potter? Is he all Gryffindor intensity? Or all Gryffindor sweetness?"
worth loving, right? And by extension, Pansy and me, as well."
But with the sound of the whistling also went the heated atmosphere, replacing it with a heavy awkwardness that Draco did not know how to navigate. Their breaths were still heavy and skin still flushed; Draco was still hard and knew without looking that Seek was too. But now that they were no longer touching, cold reality was beginning to creep back in, sucking the warmth from Draco's flesh where Seek's heat had so recently been.
(pre-p.s. Just wanna say real quick that I have been absolutely loving all the positive feedback I've been getting so far on the banter between the three Slytherins, and I just wanted to confess before we started that a lot of their conversations in this story are actually loosely based on real-life conversations I've had with my housemates. Haha, the five of us are all incredibly mature and well-mannered human people, if you couldn't tell from the dialogue. The friendship of the Slytherins is more or less inspired by my own friendships with the filthy-minded, foul-mouthed, obscenely profane, hopelessly crass, gin-soaked chain-smoking headbanging dirty bastard metalheads I live with. They are some insane fucking assholes and I just love those cunts to pieces :) And now the story may begin.)
"By all means, Potter, do carry on," Draco drawled as casually as he could, which was really not all that casual if he was being honest with himself. "We're all waiting on you here, you realize. You're the one slowing down the proceedings."
"I heard about the Eldridge case," he begins haltingly. "Are you…have you recovered?"
Ignoring both his better judgment and every warning his brain was screaming at him, Draco nodded to the floor before turning and reentering his chambers. A quiet shuffle informed him that Harry was following behind before he heard the quiet click of the door closing shut.
specifically?"
"Oi, what about us?" Dean demanded. "We're tough blokes too, you know!"
"We just want to know if Draco will be your first time as well," Blaise said innocently. "So answer the question and put our minds at ease. Prude or slag?"
Draco's eyes widened at the admission. "Not even the Weaselette?" he asked dubiously and Harry shook his head.
For the first time, Draco looked at him and truly saw the man who had defeated the Dark Lord. The thought made him shiver, but not in an unpleasant way.
Harry sighed, staring down at his phone for the thousandth time. It had been hours since he had texted Draco, and still no response. Should he text him again? Would that come off as more desperate than Harry wanted to appear? Or was Draco the type to need a bit of a push?
"Maybe we should head back to the others now," Harry suggested, still feeling uncomfortable.
"She moved out a little over a year and a half ago," Potter informed him, smile still playing around his lips. "She plays professional Quidditch in Wales now."
Harry! Oh fuck, I need you!" He needed Harry constantly, in every single way imaginable. He sometimes still had trouble believing that Harry felt the same.
"Greg, I never—"
"What?" Blaise demanded, "What does
"Oh, yes!" Crabbe shrieked gleefully, snapping his teeth at Harry. "Some hero you are, little Potter! Picking and choosing who you save! Just who elected you juror of our world, you filthy half-blood?! What gives you the right to defend some and condemn others?!"
"It's just Quidditch, isn't it? No big deal." And it really wasn't. A big deal, that was. Harry had dealt with worse; he had survived far worse than a Quidditch restriction. Malfoy's head tilted even further and Harry was beginning to grow uncomfortable under the fierce stare.
"I couldn't," Malfoy said suddenly, sounding desperate, and Harry flinched. "I couldn't control myself, Harry, and the things I did to you…
Once he reached the floor level, he glanced around, noting that there were several dark lumps lying passed out around the room, including one that looked like Wire half-hanging off a nearby sofa.
for Christ's sake! Where was the darkness coming from? Where was Daphne? Oh, god. Harry could feel his insides turning to ice; his chest hurt and his palms felt clammy. Harry had failed. Daphne was dead. How could Daphne be dead? How had the killer gotten inside? Both Draco and Caelix had assured him that the wards were impenetrable—
"Yes, I do. We can keep taking this as slow as you need," she finished. Wait, what? "I know that you needed a break from everything after it was all over," her fingers never stopped their caress, "and that's okay. It's fine. Because there's really no doubt in my mind about it."
Harry. I just want to talk, I promise," she added quickly, holding up her hands palm-out as the corners of her lips twitched.
"No!" Draco's eyes widened. "No, that's not—what does that even mean? Why would you even think that?"
"Samaira," Dean said, causing her chocolate-colored gaze to snap away from Harry and onto the dark-skinned man.
"Fine," Blaise narrowed his eyes. "You're on, flamingo-face." Turning himself around, they both settled on their stomachs into a comfortable position and placed one elbow on the floor, grasping hands and glaring at one another with razor-sharp smiles on their faces. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Weasley sit up and watch with obvious interest.
"Good," he sighs happily. "Just try and get rid of me now, Potter." His voice sounds drowsy and warm and I kiss the top of his head again.
Draco smiled faintly, shaking his head. Seek was impossible. "Now you're just flirting with danger, you realize."
Rubbing both temples, Draco laughed bitterly to himself in his own head before flopping back on his mattress and staring up at the ceiling with indifferent eyes. Would the world look any less grey if viewed from behind steel bars? What did Draco even still have in this world?
"Mate, is this about Malfoy?" Ron asked carefully.
Draco had no idea.
"I want you so much," he mumbled into Draco's mouth.
"What about Smith and Entwhistle?" Harry wondered. Knowing Smith, he hardly seemed the type to go wandering around when his life was in danger.
Malfoy laughed, but there was a bitter edge to it that Harry didn't like. "You say that like it's
"I'm sorry," he said in a low voice. "I shouldn't have responded like that when you were only trying to help." As Malfoy spoke, Harry stood perfectly still, unwilling to pull away from the other man's warm touch. He was holding onto Harry's arm just above the elbow, and Harry couldn't help but shift closer.
"Good," she grinned, hopping off the desk and straightening her robes. As she prepared to leave, she paused long enough to rumple Harry's hair once more and mock punch Draco on the shoulder. "I'll see you two boys around then, yeah?" she called cheerfully over her shoulder as she left the room.
Then, to his horror, he found himself responding, lips hesitantly pressing back without conscious permission from his brain telling them to do so. It made Malfoy moan and pull him even tighter against his own body. God, how long had it been since Harry had last kissed someone? It had been months, ever since Ginny, and Harry was ashamed of how much he liked the feeling of Malfoy's fingers combing through his hair and the way his hand felt sliding down to rest on Harry's chest.
Slowing his movements, Harry waited until Draco had melted back into the mattress before releasing him, sitting up enough to cast a quick cleaning charm over the two of them before laying back down and pulling Draco into his arms, feeling the man's heart beating in his chest.
The next morning, Harry sipped at his scalding tea and tried to ignore his trauma, stomach still too tied in knots to finish his breakfast. He had woken feeling well-rested and relaxed, smiling to himself as he stretched…until three seconds later when he bolted upright in his bed, feeling panic begin to spread through him.
"Ha!" Blaise said triumphantly. "The flamingo can suck it!"
"Yeah," Harry agreed lifelessly. God, the whole situation was making his head spin; he had no idea what to think anymore.
But the schoolwork was tedious and Harry found his thoughts straying back to the evil, vicious—beautiful, gorgeous—Slytherin far more often than he would have liked; thoughts involving pale limbs and grey eyes, long fingers and a lean torso, sharp cheekbones and a sexy smirk.
Sunshine drifted gently through the large glass doors opposite Draco's bed, opening up to a stone balcony bathed in morning light. For a moment he lay still, noting the sunlight was streaked with a soft pink and he raised his head to see that it was still dawn. The sun had risen but it was still early, grey clouds slashing the pale blue of the sky.
"This is not going to end well," Ron warned.
"Right," Ron said in a grim voice, turning to the crowd and immediately attempting to herd them from the room. Neville quickly joined his side and Harry turned back to Hermione, who had climbed to her feet and pulled a shaking Susan Bones up with her.
He stared in surprise, not exactly sure why he was surprised she had asked him that. Although he wouldn't exactly consider him and Luna to be the closest of friends, she actually really was rather good at speaking to about problems and helping him sort out how he felt about certain things. She was surprisingly insightful in a way that most people did not see when they looked at her. Harry had always felt a certain connection with her because he had always known that she too knew what it was like to feel alone and misunderstood by everyone around her, as he had felt the first eleven years of his life.
Silence. Nothing happened. The elf did not appear. He had never not appeared before. He had looked after Draco practically since birth and had never once failed to appear when summoned. "Pibby," Draco called louder, tone quickly becoming desperate. "Pibby! Pibby!"
. That Potter had still had ridiculous hair and awkward glasses, as well as a swift temper, angering quickly and prone to giving furious speeches.
"Do I need to remind you about Daphne
, right?
This clothing, on the other hand, fit him snugly, comfortably, not too tight as to be obscene, but just tight enough to make Draco's throat dry. He took a large sip of tea as Harry—Draco mentally congratulated himself on his brain's use of the man's given name—neared and dropped into the seat opposite him, grinning.
…Harry knew he had heard that word only recently as a means to describe the Slytherins' pasts. But where had he heard it?
"Yes," Malfoy interrupted, "Harry Potter will save us all, it's what he does. Can we move on to the next room already?" He muttered something beneath his breath, something that Harry was certain he was glad he did not catch. Fuck, what was Malfoy's problem? Why was he so angry?
Malfoy's only response was to glance between Harry and the man seated across the table from himself uneasily.
Nott barked a scathing laugh. "I thought you said it was one of us though, Smith? I thought you said it was all of us. I'm hardly going to off myself just to prove a point, now am I?"
A tiny smile lifted the corners of Potter's mouth. "Well, that's a relief," he said, sounding much less upset.
Draco would now be alone forever. After all, he had seen to that himself. He had no one to blame but himself.
"Yeah," Zacharias said in a quiet voice after several long moments of debate. "Only that everything you just said is such absolute fucking shit, Padma. You don't know what the hell you're talking about."
It was still raining. The castle was dark, and as Draco paced indifferently down the corridor, he could hear the small scuffling echoes of his own footsteps over the soft murmuring drizzle of rain outside. It was times like this that he loved best, when the world was hushed with rainwater and everything outside was soft and pretty and grey and safe, when he could look up at the vast textured sky and study it without fear of going blind. Most times, the blue of the sky seemed so hollow and empty to him, ceaseless and never-ending in a way that made him feel sad and insignificant. But when the weather was like this…
Blaise grinned. "We haven't had this much attention in ages. I think I like that my best friend's dating a celebrity."
"Riiight, Malfoy," Ron drawled, stretching the vowel and grinning in satisfaction at the way the Slytherin's eyes narrowed.
A warm hand slipped into his own, and he glanced down, surprised to see Pansy's fingers entwined with his own pale digits.
Grey eyes flicked open suddenly, startling Harry. A slow, lazy smile spread across the pale features.
"And you can't find who put him under?" Draco shivered at the image his mind conjured of a vacant-eyed man sitting empty and hollow surrounded by darkness in Cyril Crabbe's rightfully-earned place in prison, but he shoved the vision aside.
to die. He didn't. I know that maybe he wasn't the nicest person," Greg chuckled suddenly in memory of something Draco could not see, "but he didn't deserve to die. Not…not like that."
"Well next time aim better!" she hissed, continuing to rub her leg.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Wasn't that a better way to say good morning?" Malfoy asked in a low throaty voice, one that sent tingles down Harry's spine.
Ignoring him, Harry turned to speak to Ron and Hermione instead. "Send me a Patronus if you need help with anything."
"—still have nightmares?"
At that, Ron snorted loudly.
At the question, Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes. He didn't like disrespecting the women in the clubhouse, but sometimes he couldn't help but scoff at a person's inability to take a hint.
Potter it must be, then.
The hard look in her eye faded into wary amusement. "Well then, welcome to being one of Harry's 'sidekicks', as you like to put it."
both on the Quidditch teams, so I s'pose your aim must be at least somewhat decent," Pansy said thoughtfully. "And there was that one time that Potter nearly swallowed the Snitch trying to catch it, so I suppose he really would be good at catching things in his mouth that he probably shouldn't try to catch in there."
But before she could finish her statement, she was cut off by the sound of screaming, high-pitched and hysterical and growing louder.
Harry couldn't sleep. Outside his window, he could see dawn breaking. The sky was starting to lighten, the grey clouds hanging low over the earth beginning to reflect a dull orange with the rising of the sun. He wasn't sure how long he had been sitting there, staring into the distance; it had been dark when Draco called. Draco had woken him from an uneasy sleep, but everything the man had said had only served to make Harry's uneasiness grow, until it was a living, breathing thing with teeth and claws sitting heavy in his chest, threatening to shred his lungs and heart with every passing breath.
"The VP?" Harry raised one eyebrow. Shit, Draco was a lot more high-profile in the club than Harry would have guessed. He was really the VP's son?
Tracey shrugged, gesturing for Fenrir to hand her the bottle. He passed it over with a snort of amusement. "Hey, it was just sitting there. And we all know that Draco won't partake."
"Stop it, Malfoy," Harry hissed as Padma's dark face paled.
Both Neville and Ron shrugged. "I'm not actually sure," the redhead responded, glancing pointedly toward the oven. "All the food was made but it was waiting in the oven. Your plates are in there as well. I haven't actually seen him, or anything."
"Yes, Weasley," Blaise grinned, "do come. You can show me all those new intimidation techniques I advised you to work on. I hope you've been taking adequate notes from Granger."
One second later and Harry already regretted his decision to give in to temptation. Malfoy was staring directly at him, making Harry gasp at the overwhelming intensity pouring from the other boy's eyes and shooting across the large room to pin Harry into place as effectively as a spell. Christ, why was Malfoy staring at him like that? Harry wasn't sure if he had ever been stared at like that before, not even by Ginny or any of the rabid stalkers that had been actively attempting to slip him love potions for the past several months. The gaze just seemed different, and Harry couldn't put his finger on why.
"You promised you wouldn't do this again!" Harry cried, bucking against the wall as he tried to throw Malfoy off, but Draco was far stronger than he looked.
With a nod, Draco released him as he leant back in his chair. Harry could feel the man's eyes on him as he turned and left the room, nerves growing as he strode down the stairs and through the long hallway. As Caelix's thin frame came into view, hovering near the front door, Harry wiped his palms on his jeans and tried to ignore the rapid pounding of his heart in his chest. This was the first time he had seen the other man since the disastrous night of the pub, and Harry wasn't sure at all how to break the awkward tension that was sure to be hanging between them—and he certainly had no idea how to tell the man that he and Draco had managed to sort out their problems and were now happily involved. And in love.
"It's lovely, Draco," she chimed softly, drifting forward to get a closer look at the piano. "Do you play?"
The handle to the room they were in turned suddenly, catching their attention as the heavy door opened with a soft creak. Heart pounding and mouth feeling dry, Draco watched as his father was led in by two burly guards, who nodded to Harry respectfully before offering a small jerk of their heads to Draco, but the blond was far too nervous to care about their suspicious reaction to him.
"Fine," Harry said, shifting uncomfortably. At the question, he couldn't help but think back to the previous night, how Malfoy had climbed into his bed to talk or the way he had fallen asleep with his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry did not want to admit to either Ron or Hermione how he had not only allowed such things to happen, but had also liked it. He couldn't help but think of his confessions to Draco about his childhood and his secret of kissing another man, something that Hermione had never been told about and that Ron had been too pissed to notice. He did not want to admit to his best friends that Draco Malfoy now knew things about Harry that Harry had never before told another living person; he did not want to admit to them that a large part of himself liked the fact that he and Draco were somehow growing closer by the minute. Part of Harry had always wondered what it would have been like if he and Malfoy had been friends during Hogwarts. He used to sometimes lay awake at night wondering if he had been sorted Slytherin, would he and Draco have ever been close? Or would they only have hated each other from less of a distance? Harry had used to wonder a lot about what it would have been like to have shared a dorm with Draco Malfoy. Would they have stayed up late into the night, whispering to one another like they did last night?
"Harry?" Hermione asked with concern. "What's happened?"
"So, Potter," Blaise began casually, and Draco instantly fixed him with a glare, praying that the other boy was not about to say anything either incriminating or embarrassing.
Draco Malfoy!" He threw his hands up angrily. "I mean, can you believe that? His
"Of course," Draco said, breathing heavier as Seek shifted even closer. "But mostly, I'm referring to the fact that you're flirting with a Death Eater's property. If slighting him loses a man two fingers, imagine what touching his property will get you."
"Look, Harry," Ron sighed, "We know that you don't want to hurt anybody,"—Harry blinked in surprise; how had Ron known what he had been thinking?—"But…mate, somebody is going to get hurt here, no matter what. Best you can do is be honest, like Hermione said. Who would you rather be with?"
"You don't trust me
"They were talking about you, Harry," Ron cut in, drawing Harry's attention to him. "The two girls were in there talking about you and about…" he paused to sigh, "they were talking about ways they could slip you a love potion."
"No," Harry sighed. "Terry is missing. We're looking for him right now."
"Good night, Harry," was the reply and with one final lingering kiss, the two boys broke apart. Blaise pulled the blond along, shaking his head in amusement and smiling at the dazed look on his face.
Harry shrugged. He wasn't sure at all if he wanted to go to the game anymore, but he had promised both Oliver and Finlay that he would be there. At the time, however, he had been counting on Draco attending with him and felt a pang at the thought of the blond. How furious was Malfoy? First Harry had gotten angry and just
"Hey, I took down Horcruxes too," Ron rolled his eyes. "I deserve some kind of reward, don't I? And nobody ever sends me and Hermione gifts!"
, for Merlin's sake.
The smile on Potter's face grew wider as if he would like nothing more than to solve the mystery of the blond side-by-side with the man himself. And Draco had to admit, Potter's side was looking more and more appealing.
"Yes," Draco answered, a small smile beginning to spread across his lips. What was Potter asking?
"Yes, I can fucking cook," Malfoy snapped. "And since you seem to be the most useless in a kitchen out of everyone here, you can be the one to wash the vegetables. Blaise, you and Pansy cut everything up. Granger will measure and proportion everything correctly. Potter and I will do the actual cooking, seeing as how we're the only ones capable of actually succeeding in creating anything edible. Tracey and Theo will get all the appropriate dishes and silverware out and help dish the food when it's ready."
"I'm not dating a sodding fifteen-year-old," Harry muttered, still feeling embarrassed.
"I know," Malfoy grimaced. "I'm sorry for overreacting."
, he thought to himself as Harry began to lick and kiss the exposed skin of his torso.
Harry stroked Draco's cheek lightly with the very tips of his fingers, eyes twinkling down at Draco. "Perfect, huh?"
" Potter muttered.
"Stephen is missing? Is he here too?" Anthony's face suddenly drained of color. "Oh god, please tell me nothing happened to him! Please tell me you've found him!"
"Nothing happened with me and Ginny," Potter said carefully, raising one hand to comb through Draco's long hair, as had become a habit with him over the past few weeks.
"Then I'll just have to kill him first."
"Hmm," she hummed, leaning down far enough to offer Harry a view of her half-exposed breasts. Seriously, her tits were practically being shoved in his face, and he leaned back with a frown. "Is that the only way you're planning on celebrating then?"
He nodded. "Yeah, she spent half the night talking to this one bloke and shooting me these strange looks, like I was supposed to march over there and punch him in the face or something for daring to be too close to her, and then she agreed to dance with him right in front of me. And she spent most of the song staring at me over his shoulder!" He grimaced as Malfoy laughed. "I just don't get women, I really don't. I decided that Luna is going to be the only woman I will ever attend another stupid function with."
Harry glared at Malfoy, wondering just how savage and bloody Malfoy's revenge fantasy for Harry really was.
kissing him? Did he maybe not hate Draco after all?
Seek smiled. "I'll give the truck back if I can keep you in its place."
and the house-elf is falling apart and tends to talk to himself quite a bit, but it's somewhere we can be alone just the two of us. I spent years cooking for my horrible relatives so I'm a fairly decent cook and I promise we won't starve. And I'm not sure yet what I want to do with my life, but I have loads and loads of gold so it's not really an immediate problem. All I know is that I love you and I want us to live together." Harry's eyes were bright and he was almost breathless by the time he finished speaking. He could imagine it all so clearly—the two of them redecorating and settling in, inviting friends over for dinner, relaxing together in front of the fireplace with a drink or two, making love in every room of the house. The last one would be item number one to accomplish on his post-graduation list of things to do.
it?" Harry mouthed incredulously. Why would Oliver do that?
"We would have gotten back together eventually with or without you," Harry said in a casual voice.
"Because," Blaise shrugged. "They're blind, aren't they? And you're almost blind."
Turning and striding to the fireplace, he scooped a handful of powder from the bowl on the mantle and turned back to lock eyes with Potter, who was still standing just beyond the threshold of the room, arms folded across his body as he silently watched Draco. He offered the brunet a smile as he tossed the powder into the fireplace and stepped into the green flames before softly calling out the two words Wisp had sent him. The room began to spin and Draco closed his eyes as his smile tightened dangerously.
"Okay, right," Harry nodded.
connection, and however unexpected it may have been, it was…I dunno,
Blaise's eyes narrowed. "Pansy," he turned to her, "drag me to the cupboard over there in order to do unspeakable things to me just so these two gits will stop being so damned smug."
. He could feel Draco swallowing around him and moaned at the sensation.
"Erm…yes!" Draco said, sounding excited. "Yes, there is!"
"Don't be mad at me," Potter said quietly, pulling back far enough to look Draco in the eye. "We were having a good time and I'm sorry for ruining it. I really was just surprised."
"Telly," Harry corrected automatically. "And girlfriend? Hermione is Ron's girlfriend."
"I've been better," he says wryly.
She stepped as close to the body as possible without getting her feet in the puddle of blood seeping from the crimson mattress, casting several spells over the corpse of a man that Harry had barely known. He had never really spoken to Kevin before; he didn't even know what type of person Kevin was. He had always been quiet and kept to himself, lingering just on the edges of Harry's adolescence. He had always been a face with no voice attached, hardly even a name. Harry was finally starting to realize how little he knew about the people he had spent six consecutive years of school around. He had seen these people almost every single day for
"To say goodbye, of course," Blaise answered in an innocent voice. "Is there something wrong with wanting to wish my best friend a good evening spent in the arms of his one true love?"
"Okay," Draco said, sounding relieved. He took a deep breath before whispering, in a voice that made Harry shiver, "Thank you, Seek. I'll see you soon."
As a pale figure darted past, his hand sprang out to snatch at the front of Malfoy's robes and drag him into the tiny space. Their chests were nearly touching and Malfoy stared at him in utter shock and, for the briefest of seconds, a sudden flash of panic. Both emotions quickly melted away, however, to be replaced by a cool disregard.
Draco crossed his arms. "It's a valid concern."
The informal dining room was just as silent as when they had left; Harry gazed around at the somber faces, unable to help but wonder if any more would be lost before they were able to find a way out of the house.
"I'll give the first person able to get Granger to say 'vagina' a Galleon," Blaise grinned. "Or Potter. I think I would like hearing you say that word as well, Potter."
"Yeah," Ron cut in, "for once in your life, Smith, just keep your fat mouth shut."
Pulling back, Harry broke the kiss to gaze at Draco with questioning eyes. "Does this mean you like me?"
All throughout Potions Harry was distracted with thoughts of Draco. He couldn't help but stare at him, study him, sometimes lose himself for minutes at a time in the beauty of the Slytherin—he was gorgeous and took Harry's breath away and Harry had never felt luckier or more blessed in his life than he did at the thought of Draco caring for him just as much as he himself cared for the other boy.
"How do you fee—" the blond started to ask only to stop abruptly, both men chuckling as they fell silent, both waiting for the other to speak first.
"Look, Potter, I'm here to…" For the first time, Malfoy both sounded and appeared uncertain. "You aren't going to…tell anyone…are you?" His words were hesitant and there was a pink flush creeping across his sharp cheekbones. His eyes were hooded but Harry thought he saw something close to panic underneath as if this was really something Malfoy had been desperately worried about. And now that Harry was looking closely, the other boy did look exhausted. The grey eyes gazing nervously into Harry's own were framed by dark circles.
was absolutely reprehensible, and he simply would not allow himself to sink that low. "Show me whatever is in those folders already, would you?"
"Perhaps I selfishly wanted to make it out of the war alive?" Malfoy drawled, voice dripping with sarcasm. "And naively thought you the only viable option for that wish? I assure you it was not done out of the desire to be accused by you of becoming the next Dark Lord."
With a smirk, Harry closed his eyes. He had nearly fallen back to sleep when a loud crack split the silence and made him jump. A large square table was now sitting in between the two beds, set for two and piled with dishes. Harry had just pulled on a borrowed pair of silk pajama pants and taken a seat at one of the place settings when Draco slipped back into the room and took the chair opposite him.
"Where is he?" Draco wondered aloud in surprise.
happening. Just because Voldemort had been defeated didn't mean all the evil in the world had died with him; the evil had simply reverted to a form less noseless and more blond.
"Draco," a deep voice said, and Harry turned his head in surprise; he had been so busy taking in the room that he had hardly even registered the other Slytherins lounging nearby. Zabini and Parkinson were seated in wine-colored armchairs near the fire, the two of them facing one another across a table the shade of burnt coffee and both focused intently on a marble chess set between them. From what Harry could see, it seemed that Parkinson was winning. Nott was sat on a black leather sofa nearby, watching the game with casual indifference, while Davis sat tucked away in a nearby nook beneath a large window, sitting on ruby-colored cushions as she flipped through a thick leather-bound book.
"Always," the man growled.
The never-ending questions did nothing but make Harry feel sick. All he had to go on were his own cyclical speculations making him dizzy, and uncertain instincts leading him blindly through the thick fog of unanswered queries that the case had spiraled into. Zabini was the only lead they had at the moment and the man seemed to have once again completely vanished off the face of the earth, just as he had only
"Yes, like that, Harry,
soulless and dead-eyed, Ron. They're nothing more than walking corpses, you should know this, we studied them in sixth year."
"I'm really not," Harry laughed, brushing the hair from Draco's eyes and twirling the silky strands around the ends of his fingers. "I'm not ever normally like this, I swear it."
"Um, maybe the fact that he's not sitting alone?" Draco drawled sarcastically.
"Well, knowing Draco as well as I do," Zabini drawled, eyes glittering, "I know he'll not have told you anything. All I'm willing to say is that it was a misunderstanding, one I plan on correcting at present."
"You're all barking mad if you think Hermione had anything to do with this," Harry told them, accepting the wand and casting a quick
"Drinking before dinner, Draco?" Zabini asked teasingly. "What would your mother say?"
Granger spluttered at the statement. "What—? I haven't got a—"
"Fuck!"
aura?" he wondered, rolling his eyes at the redheaded girl next to him.
"Seconded," Nott said, lying back down and stretching out on the sofa.
"That wasn't foreplay," Harry frowned. "That was the truth."
"Will it make it better or worse to tell you I'll miss you?" Draco wondered, still hiding his face in Seek's throat.
And Draco hated being confined there—he just wanted to disappear from it all. He just wanted it all to end.
"Just thinking," Draco muttered, turning back to gaze out of the dark window once more. "Were you surprised, Gregory? When you saw it was Cyril Crabbe?"
It did not take long before Harry was desperate enough to break the promise he had made to himself after Hedwig's death to never again use another owl and soon began borrowing different school birds to send Draco a letter at least once a day asking for the chance to talk and begging forgiveness. Not a single message was returned.
"Pretty sure, yeah," he deadpanned, ignoring the laughter still ringing around him. "You can ask the last bloke I sucked off though if you really want proof."
But asking Draco not to be upset at that point was simply not realistic. "Wolf said he fought someone with black hair…he said he found out who stole his truck…"
"Maybe not," Seek said softly, "but maybe it matters to me."
Harry swore. "But
"Yeah. He, er, told me I didn't need to worry about bringing anything, so I guess just my wand, yeah? But I also have a few Galleons just in case…" Truthfully, Harry had no idea what they were doing. He had offered to take Draco out and had been the one to originally ask for the date, but Draco had told him several days ago that he had planned everything and didn't want Harry worrying about a thing, which of course had made Harry worry so much he had barely slept at all the night before.
"I don't know," Harry replied. "But I don't want to decide anything without speaking to Ron and Hermione first. Either way, I doubt that whoever it was will be back tonight."
Pansy and Draco laughed again.
"Course he will," Zabini's smile widened, showing just the barest hint of teeth. "He's always popping away for impromptu business meetings, but he'll never tell who they are with or what business they involve, no matter the form of bribery on offer for the answer." His arms were loosely folded over his chest as he leaned casually against a wall, not taking his gaze from Harry. "He'll return soon enough."
"So where's your mother?" Potter asked suddenly, pulling Draco's mind away from the trail of questions it had been following. "I keep expecting to see her whenever I come over, but I haven't. Is she here somewhere?" He peered around the room carefully as though expecting to see her jump out from behind a bookshelf and openly mock him for his inability to spot her sooner.
"You have to feed me," Smith said smugly, folding his arms across his chest. "The others won't let you get away with withholding food from people just because they make you angry."
, Draco mused, twisting a silvery strand of hair around one finger in thought, that would not explain why Potter's hearing had apparently failed as well, because there Potter sat, only inches away from the blond, stiff and rigid and positively radiating fury. The man was practically shaking with it, for god's sake, his fingers trembling with suppressed rage as he gripped a quill tight enough to snap the thing in half. The Gryffindor wasn't even pretending to read the text, and despite the quill still clenched in hand—about to shatter in his grasp at any second, surely—he had yet to take a single note.
Ron's gaze sharpened as he turned to exchange a look with Hermione. She unlocked the door with her wand, and Harry saw Malfoy turn away as Ron twisted the knob and pushed the door open. From where he was sat, Harry could see one of Terry's blood-stained hands lying on the sofa beside his body, alongside clothing darkened and still wet with crimson splashes. Copying Malfoy and turning away from the sight, Harry looked over to see a blank expression on Malfoy's face, one that made the brunet shiver.
Draco hadn't slept. He sat on the edge of his bed, watching the sun rise through the window. The light of dawn pooling weakly across the bed was sliced into sharp lines by the plastic blinds, once white but now dirtied to a dingy grey that made Draco's stomach clench. Was he now just as stained as those blinds? Was everything that entered that house automatically drenched in the same grime that seemed to sully every surface?
"All right," Tracey promised. "We'll be fine, Draco, don't worry about us. Worry about keeping yourself safe first."
. In the whole eight years of us all knowing one another, I don't think I've heard you talk about
With a painful swallow, Harry turned his gaze back to the expansive grounds stretched beneath him. Thoughts kept swirling through his mind of Draco's grief, mutilated body parts, Zabini's earlier words, Caelix's hurt expression that he had tried to keep hidden, the way Draco had turned his face into Zabini's chest as the man held him closely, comforting him more intimately than Harry had been able to. Everything felt as if it had all become far too much far too quickly, and he could feel a faint pounding beginning in his temples.
"Ha!" Ginny said triumphantly, turning to Harry with a smug look.
"Sounds like a challenge," Harry hummed. "Stick with me, Draco, and you'll finish in ways you've never even
The stranger returned the frown. "All right then." One hand swept out in front of him, a gesture for Draco to lead the way.
Circling around the table, Harry approached her and leaned in close to speak in her ear. "Hermione," he said, and she half-turned her head to show she was listening. "I think you and Ron and Neville should spend the night somewhere, just the three of you. You three barely slept at all last night. You should go somewhere you can ward tight and not have to worry about staying up to watch over everyone. I know that not a single person here can get past your wards. I think it will only create more problems at this stage to try to force everyone to stay together."
"There are definite traces of magic," Hermione said in a low voice, looking up from Kevin's unmoving frame. "But I'm afraid I can't tell what spells they are."
a fucking albino! And third of all, I have a blanket around my waist you git, you can't even see my enormous fair-skinned penis!"
Draco suddenly became very interested in studying his food, deciding there was nothing more important in the entire world than pushing his veg around his plate with his fork and not taking his eyes from it. There was always the possibility it may do something exciting and worth looking at, after all.
Blaise gave him a flat look. "Are you saying that the idea of a points system is an entirely new concept for you, Weasley?"
"I'll be okay," Harry cut in, talking over him. "I doubt Stephen's going to make a move so soon. Not after all that shit with Kevin."
"Among Those Killed in the Dawn Raid Was a Man Aged One Hundred"—Dylan Thomas
"Er…" Harry hesitated, glancing around at their surroundings. It was a spare bedroom, one with cold walls the color of smoke and an ebony floor. The sound of a lock sliding shut got his attention, and his gaze snapped back onto Malfoy, who offered a sultry smirk before striding up to stand only inches away. "You—you wanted to talk?"
"I'm fine, Harry, I promise." Caelix placed one hand over his own heart in a gesture of sincerity. "On my honor as a natural blond, I assure you I am not working myself too hard."
Fighting back a snort, Harry gestured for him to proceed with the explanation.
"Would you…" Harry felt a fierce blush spread across his face and was sure that Draco could feel the heat from it, "would you, er…" Oh, god, how did he ask someone something like that? He hadn't asked anyone on a date since fifth year with Cho.
"So you see, Potter," Draco said several minutes later, the Potions text spread between them as the blond tried to explain the intricate theories of the day's lesson to the other boy, "All it's really talking about is being able to properly predict and compensate for the instability within a potion caused by the pockets of fluid that can sometimes build-up during solidification. If it's not all evenly distributed throughout the potion before it begins to harden, it will cause the foundation to become unstable and can render the potion completely useless, if not dangerous."
"Yes," Malfoy nodded, appearing even more wary. "What happened, Potter?"
"Okay," Harry said cautiously, feeling his knees tremble. Deciding that standing could go to hell, Harry walked over to the large table he had sat on the first time they had ever met in the room they were in, sinking down into a seated position atop its surface.
"Okay," Draco whispered, staring down at his phone when the call ended. Tracey and Pansy were fine, and that was all that mattered. Staring down at his screen, he felt his fingers begin to tremble once more as another notification reminding him that he had unread text messages popped up.
He stared up at her in confusion. "Gifts?"
"I promise, Granger."
"Of course, darling," Pansy smiled. "We're mysterious individuals, don't assume that you'll ever be able to predict what we'll do or say."
Reminding himself that he was not alone and that everything horrible that had happened in the cellar of the house they were in had happened years ago, Harry took a deep breath and threw himself down the stairs after the others, careful not to trip and tumble down the steep steps. He reached the bottom to find everyone halted in place, wands lit as they gazed around the room.
"It'll be fine," Potter whispered, wrapping Draco in a tight hug that made him somehow feel both terrified and safe at the same time. "You'll see, Draco. It'll be fine."
"Seek," Draco moaned, gasping in the very next second when Harry sucked in his entire length, moving his hand to Draco's hips so he could take the whole prick into his throat. He swallowed and hummed, bobbing his head several times before pulling back, dragging his mouth along the length so slowly it barely felt as though he were moving at all.
"I will bloody hex you if I have to," Harry warned, not wanting to hurt Malfoy but needing to get away from the situation and out of Malfoy's hold. He was trying not to panic but was unsure how long he could remain like that before freaking out. "You do realize that you're effectively destroying every ounce of the trust I had just barely begun to put in you, don't you?"
. Like Harry was some holy deity that Draco had been praying to for months to grant a miracle and the miracle was somehow Harry himself.
. And if you were smart, you would leave and never look back."
"Course," Ron agreed, taking a step toward the bedroom door.
"Is there any way to check the room for any traces of magic that don't belong to Justin or Zach?" Ron asked Hermione, who frowned.
Zabini had pulled Draco from his bowed position to rest against his chest, forehead tucked into the man's dark throat. Both of his arms were wrapped securely around the blond. Draco's eyes were shut, tears still steadily leaking from between closed eyelids as Zabini rocked him softly, stroking his hair and murmuring words that Harry could not hear. He felt as if he was intruding, but he felt uneasy about leaving Draco alone with Zabini.
He could never be Draco's.
"I knew it!" Pansy howled happily. "I knew it would be you! Blaise, you absolute sucker, pay up!"
"I know how delicious you are," Potter quipped, and Draco groaned at the line.
"Right?" Draco agreed in a sad voice, turning to give Potter his best pout. Potter responded with a laugh and leaned forward to steal the pout away with a kiss, one that Draco turned more fully into so he could deepen it. He could hear the sound of the lake slapping against hard rocks, the cawing of birds overhead, the rustling of wind through the long grass they were sat in, but the more he kissed Harry, the more the rest of the world seemed to melt away until it had faded into nothing but indistinguishable background noise, a low buzzing hum that Draco could not focus on even if he wanted to—not while Harry was kissing him, at least. He could feel the sun on his skin, the breeze as it swept past him, the hard ground beneath him, but all those feelings paled in comparison to the feel of Potter's lips on his, his hands on Draco's skin, his dark hair tickling Draco's face.
"No!" Malfoy shouted, and Harry's eyes snapped open. "No, because I don't need it! None of what you've said is true! I'm not under any fucking love potions! How many times do I have to tell you, I'm fucking
Only seconds later, Draco came as well, pale lips continuing to seek every inch of Harry's body they could find for the entirety of his release. Quiet endearments were whispered into the warm skin of Harry's throat where Draco's head rested against it, lips trailing along his neck just lightly enough to give him shivers.
"Is it?" Hermione raised her eyebrows. "He approaches you out of nowhere one night, saying that the time was right to talk to you, and then kisses you with no warning, without any fear of rejection. From what you told us, it didn't seem like rejection had ever even crossed his mind as a possibility. What if that was because he knew you were already under the influence of a potion? What if that was what he meant by saying the time was right? What if everything you've felt so far has been magically induced?"
, then…I don't really see the point in hiding this."
After what felt like an entire century of speaking, Harry finally fell quiet. The silence around them felt heavy, and Harry risked a glance up to find Malfoy sitting straight up in his chair, spine a rigid steel bar. He had one hand raised, covering his mouth in shock as he gazed at Harry in absolute horror.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So," Nott said, cracking his neck and glancing around, "what do we do now?"
Who the fuck had done all of this and why had no one been able to catch a single glimpse of them?
"I'm not moping," Harry said in a low voice, telling Ron the truth. He was not moping—he was hiding away in shame and despair. Those two things were clearly not the same. And what did Ron know anyway? Harry had every right to hide away, and certainly every right to mope, which he was clearly
him for all of it.
that he was putting Draco at risk by sending him directly into the hornet's nest? Rival gangs were not allowed outside their own turf, and that included all patches, hangarounds, and property. Draco could be seriously hurt for strolling up to the clubhouse and handing them a challenge from their enemies. There was no guarantee he would come out of that clubhouse in one piece, and Fenrir had fucking
"I'm going to go wash up," he said quietly, climbing from the bed, "and put a few things together for the trip. I'll most likely be gone before you wake, I want to get there early."
"Exactly."
in the box."
"Are you okay?" Harry asked quietly, tugging on Draco's sleeve to slow him down and allow the others to pass on ahead.
"No, god, no," Potter laughed. "I was never quite ready for the life the
But that wasn't the only thing out there. Reminding himself that there was an entire Auror guard stationed outside, Harry tried to calm himself, focusing on his breathing and attempting to find peace in the arrhythmic pitter-patter of the rain against the windows.
Would Malfoy actually allow him the chance to apologize? Would he allow Harry to speak and would he actually listen? Would Harry be able to make Draco see, make Draco understand? Would Draco forgive him? Would Draco maybe even return the apology? Had both of them simply crumbled under the confusing situation and lashed out at one another in stress?
"And one of us was offered a position on the England team as Seeker without even having to try out."
"You need to speak with them both," Hermione said from the fire. "You need to explain to them what you just told us. You need to be honest with them, Harry."
"At the cost of our lives?" Nott drawled, shooting Harry an unimpressed look.
"Want me to rub it for you?" Blaise offered.
Draco moaned as Harry raised his head and turned to the side in order to press an open-mouthed kiss to the skin below Draco's ear, tugging the lobe into his mouth and nibbling before licking below it once more. "Harry," Draco sighed, trailing his fingers slowly up then down Potter's spine until he was cupping the man's muscular arse in both hands, heart rate speeding at the sound of the deep groan tumbling free from the brunet's throat.
"Oh, you know," Harry waved one hand casually, "politics, ethics, blood purity, current events, social status, those sorts of things."
"Won't be long now 'til I catch up," said Harry cheerfully.
"What are we doing?" he whispered, feeling as though his insides had frozen and cracked, like splintered ice atop a lake in the dead of winter. At that moment, he felt like winter. "He'll kill us. He'll kill us both if he ever finds out."
"What, they don't train Aurors to know how to check for those sorts of things?" Malfoy asked in surprise, and Harry glanced over, not even realizing that he had followed the two Gryffindors.
"No, that's even better!" Blaise whispered eagerly. "If you ask to speak to him alone, while his friends are there, that just makes you seem more genuine! Someone who wanted to harm him is hardly going to approach him in front of witnesses, are they?"
fault. Lay the blame at the feet of my aunt and the Dark Lord; they are the individuals to be held accountable."
"I'm not leaving you on your own to get killed, Malfoy," Potter shot back, returning the glare.
"So," he echoed, feeling hollow. God, that had been hard to see Draco; he had not been expecting to feel so shaken.
A loud snort snatched his attention, and Draco looked over to see Wire leaning over the bartop, holding the flimsy plastic straw in one hand.
"Do you really think there's something out there?" Draco's voice was soft as he placed the book he had been pretending to read on his lap and leaned forward in his seat.
"Mandy and Terry were both in Ravenclaw," Harry offered helplessly.
across the street. Hurrying over to it, he slid open the door and squeezed inside the narrow space before twisting himself into an uncomfortable position in order to punch in the proper numbers on the square buttons of the strange device, answering the box's questions with his name and purpose for visit. A tiny
"Oh, I'm sorry, darling," Draco said in mock surprise, "did you want to be the one to tell him just how much you like sucking me off? By all means, please do so."
"Your turn, Hermione," Weasley reminded her, determinedly not looking at anyone but her.
"Like…
"Black and chrome," the man said, still sounding surprised. "Red trim. Big motherfucker, hard to miss."
"This is how I'm celebrating," Harry said, accepting a fresh lager from Dennis.
"True enough, but my numerous victories still count as an arse kicking, mate, sorry," he sniggered, swinging his long arms back and forth by his sides.
"Why do you think they didn't say anything?" Michael frowned. "What does that mean that neither of them wanted to tell you that?"
"I want to start telling people," Potter said unexpectedly, and Draco felt his brow furrow in confusion.
"When are you leaving?" Fenrir asked with a frown.
Ignoring him, Hermione pushed herself to her feet with a sigh. "Well then, I suppose we had better go speak to them now."
Interhouse friendships abound at the Hogwarts reunion slumber party! Or is the drama only just beginning?
The desire to chuckle, however, died upon glancing over to find Blaise watching him curiously. The second their eyes connected, Blaise smiled a slow, breathtaking smile. God, Draco had nearly forgotten how good-looking the man was. With a wrench, he tore his eyes from Blaise, swinging it to the right to land on Potter, who was still watching him. Draco wondered if he had ever shifted his gaze.
Zabini shook his head. "I'll stay up. You lot go back to sleep." With one hand, he reached out to tuck a lock of hair behind Parkinson's ear, who grasped his hand tightly between both of her own.
Pressing another wet kiss to the man's chest, Draco blindly licked his way around, until he found what he was searching for. "Mm," he sighed as his teeth closed over one taut nipple, nipping and tugging at it gently before laving over it with his tongue. Pulling back, he breathed hotly over the flesh, delighting in the shuddery groan the action elicited.
The more words fell from Malfoy's mouth, the more tears fell from Harry's eyes. Every plea only succeeded in breaking Harry's heart even more, adding more and more fractures to it until Harry knew there was no way it would not soon shatter completely, beyond any amount of repair. It would never be whole again.
"McGonagall made an announcement the morning after," Potter continued, large eyes unblinking as he shifted his arm a fraction closer, "Saying that there is zero tolerance for any kind of violence or vigilante vengeance allowed within Hogwarts."
," Tracey corrected right back. "
The door seemed to creak even louder than the last as it swung open. Hermione took a hesitant step inside as the lamps flared to life, and Harry heard her gasp loudly at the sight that met their eyes. Everything was in shambles; the entire room seemed to be in disarray. The furniture had been scattered and knocked over, and Harry could see a spot on the far wall where something had cracked the wood, almost as though something heavy had been thrown against it.
"Noon."
"Irlelevant," she waved one hand, face screwing up as she tried again "Eerilelervant. Fuck, stupid words," she mumbled, punching Harry on the shoulder as he laughed at her.
"So you know nothing," the man said bluntly.
"Course, Malfoy," he agreed instantly. "I'll share what I can. And you contact me immediately if you hear anything from Goyle or Zabini."
is the only one responsible here, not him, and certainly not you! Neither of you can be blamed!" Her voice softened as she gazed at him, tears streaming down her face. "I'm so sorry, Harry," she whispered, pulling him back into a gentle hug and holding him tightly. "I'm so sorry. When I thought that you were the one under a love potion, it had never even crossed my mind to consider that it might not actually be
"I'm sure it'll be lovely, Harry, catching up with an old friend," Draco suddenly said in a gracious voice, startling the Gryffindor, who had been expecting thinned lips and barely contained anger. But Draco's grip had loosened on the broom handle and he looked more or less sincere. "Go, Harry. Go catch up with your old captain and come find me later, all right?"
"Shirts are stupid," Harry decided, and Draco couldn't help but agree, running his hands over Potter's firm biceps.
"—love you, Harry!"
It had taken seven years for Harry to realize how he felt about the blond, but now that he was fully aware, he intended to bind himself to Draco forever and never let go.
"Compared to what we decided he is, yes," Draco grinned.
Ginny shook her head. "No, Harry and I are over and I accept that. You make him happy, Malfoy," she continued softly, "and he needs that. He
, what are you talking about?"
Draco stood near the gleaming bike, biting his lip and staring into the distance, and Harry had no idea what to say to break the strange tension that now hung over them like a storm cloud. Should he apologize for what happened? But that would make it sound as though Harry was actually sorry for it when he didn't think he had ever regretted anything less in his life. To his knowledge, Harry hadn't ever gotten involved with someone already in a relationship, and he was so far out of his depth he didn't know what to do.
Heart pounding and limbs wary, Harry headed back the way he had come, noting a large crowd of students grouped together at the far end of the corridor, all standing in a thick circle and looking down at something on the floor. Dread settled in Harry's stomach as he quickened his stride, knowing without needing to be told that something awful had happened. More laughter rang out sharply, echoing off the cold stone walls. As he neared the group of cackling students, Harry felt his heart seize in his chest as he stumbled to a halt in dread.
"Draco…" he murmured, and with a wild gasp from Malfoy, his hands slid into Harry's hair and tugged him closer, pressing their mouths together. Harry's arms wound automatically around the blond's waist and pulled him tightly against himself, pressed between Harry and the castle. The brunet parted his lips and felt the other mouth do the same. His tongue lightly traced the other boy's bottom lip before stretching it further to taste more.
"Cae…" Harry was unsure of what to say. How on earth did he respond to such a thing, even if it was true? He certainly did not want to confirm such a statement.
"I discovered them shortly after the start of first year and found them much easier than a quill and ink. I have actually always thought of them as rather ingenious," Malfoy admitted with a smirk, the expression widening at the nonplussed look on Harry's face. Did Draco
"God," Harry chuckled, and Draco could feel the vibrations of his laughter along his whole body. "I've really missed you and your dramatics, Draco."
"Of course, seeing as I'm the one who trained you," the owner of those forearms grinned. "I needed to make sure you didn't embarrass me or anything."
"Thank you for coming with me today," he said in a subdued voice, swallowing thickly and praying for his nerves to settle before the upcoming meeting. Lord, was he really about to do this?
Harry shrugged again. "They have about as many ways as wizards do. But yeah, you don't want to be on the receiving end of a bullet."
Then finally, after Harry felt his point had been made, he would tuck Draco securely under one arm and, glowering at anybody who dared look at them, lead the smirking blond plastered at his side away from the scene.
Opening his eyes, he half-turned his head to see Dean's concerned face looking down on him. "I'm fine," he sighed wearily.
"You always laughed the loudest at all of my impersonations of Granger in class and my jokes about Weasley's family!"
Interesting? Was Draco interesting? Well, clearly he thought he was interesting, but was the Boy-Who-Lived just as impressed?
is that any of your business?!"
"Well," Wisp grinned, clearly proud of himself for what he was about to reveal, "I followed a messy little trail from the latest victim that I'll spare you the details about. Let's just say that it started with a broken strain of magic and led me to a name."
Kicking the door in frustration and achieving nothing but bruised toes, he turned around, only to stop short at the sight of Draco Malfoy observing him coolly from several yards away. He was standing casually and appeared relaxed, but there was something slightly too careless about the way he held himself, almost as if it was a posture he had practiced.
"Potter," Malfoy frowned, reaching out to pull Harry to a stop. "I'm trying to understand you. We need to be able to rely on one another. My life is more or less in your hands now, as yours is in mine, and we need to start at least trying to create a foundation for trust to be built on if we want to make it out of here alive. So please, I don't care if it doesn't make sense, I want to know what happened. What was it about that hallway that made you panic?"
Morgue barked a sharp, nasty laugh. "Sure you don't," he sneered, stepping up behind Wire. "Tell us where they went, you little bitch, and we might just leave some of those teeth in your mouth!"
Malfoy's eyes narrowed further in suspicion. "Words?" he echoed.
"It's fun," Pansy explained, and Blaise nodded again with an innocent smile.
"Draco?" a soft voice said behind him, and Draco sniffed harder as he was forced back into the horribleness of the current moment, where he was trying his hardest not to sob all over himself like some snot-nosed first year. "Draco? Are you okay?"
Harry sat next to him in Potions, squeezing his hand underneath the table occasionally and talking with Zabini. Parkinson still didn't say much, but she would actively follow the conversation with her eyes, opening her mouth once or twice as if to join in but always catching herself in time. Harry shrugged internally and knew she would get there.
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry whispered, clenching his eyes shut as the memory of that horrid night in the East Tower swept over him. "I'm so sorry."
"There's no way
Malfoy scoffed. "Hardly, Potter. Have you seen yourself? You couldn't crush a fly." His voice was slightly breathless and Harry decided there were better things to do with his mouth than trading barbs with the Slytherin. He bent and captured Draco's lips in a searing kiss; one that scorched a burning path through his body, obliterating every thought that didn't include Draco, every molecule that wasn't drowning in sensation from the feel of touching Draco, everything in the world was stripped away and forgotten until the only thing Harry knew was the feel of Draco's skin sliding against his own, the panting gasps that he made, the fingers clenching and twisting in Harry's hair. Everything consisted of Draco and Draco was everything and Harry loved him and he needed him to know it.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Thanks for the advice, Ron. I don't know what I would do without you. You've been my rock through this troubled period of my life."
"Or maybe someone else broke into their room and took it," Harry said quietly. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake the feeling that Stephen was somehow involved. His disappearance was suspicious enough, but the footsteps at night and now the missing wand…
were, but I can promise you that Draco hasn't been out of my sight once. So I'll tell you one more time, Smith, before I lose my patience—back off."
A nod was Harry's only farewell before the brunet turned and strode away, wondering what the hell he had just agreed to.
A loud whistle behind them gave Draco the excuse he needed to break the kiss, turning to see Wire grinning lewdly at them, whistling again as he swayed in his seat. Tracey was in his lap, both of his thick arms wrapped around her waist like an iron bar, holding her firmly against him, and Draco wished he had the power to release her from his grasp.
"I'm saying that the situation is already dangerous enough without actively seeking out a fight."
"We were just speaking to Draco," Tracey said, adopting a serious tone. "Making sure he's okay. He got a call a little while ago and seemed a bit upset, so we just wanted to check up on him."
The time passed in quiet contentment, the room peaceful and still as they sat together in comfortable silence, Harry stroking the back of Draco's hand as he gazed down at the blond with clear affection shining in his green eyes. Draco smiled softly at the sight, content to lie in the silence with Harry beside him for as long as he could.
"Everyone, then," Potter agreed. "I'd like to tell everyone."
"Which do you mean?" Draco asked, still smirking. "The killing or the fucking?"
Two seconds ticked past and Malfoy still did not move away, which Harry took as encouragement. Heart pounding, he uttered a quick prayer in his mind as he bent forward to press a chaste kiss to the other boy's lips. With a moan that tore straight through Harry's blood, Draco's lips parted and his hands shot out to grasp at the brunet, spinning them around in an unexpected move and pinning Harry to the heavy wooden door. Harry trembled as Draco's hands slid beneath his t-shirt and ran lightly up his ribs. A second later, the shirt was being tugged over his head and thrown carelessly to the side, catching Harry's glasses on the collar and scattering them somewhere along the floor—all of which Harry responded to eagerly by pulling Draco even closer and attempting to devour him through his mouth.
"Is that not how you react to most situations in life?" Weasley said, voice heavy with sarcasm, and Draco glared.
"She f-f-fell asleep before me," the girl cried, "I know she d-did! I c-couldn't sleep, but I know she w-w-was still there when I finally d-did!"
Harry felt another hollow pang shoot through his chest.
"Did you mean it?" he blurted, staring unblinkingly at Harry. The question made the brunet pause as he thought about its meaning.
"Let Blaise have friends, Draco," Pansy tutted. "Lord knows he needs more people in his life actually willing to tolerate him."
"I can tell you which one I prefer, Zabini," Harry grinned.
"Were you lot cleaning something?" Weasley asked, nose scrunched in confusion, and Pansy and Blaise laughed.
Harry gritted his jaw and shook his head. "Ron, Ginny and I haven't been together for a very long time. So no, I did not cheat on her with Malfoy. My break-up with Ginny has absolutely nothing to do with Draco. Even if I wasn't with him, I wouldn't be with her. I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I didn't want to get back together with her. But I'm trying now. I'm trying to share what's happening with me and how I feel and I'm telling you that I care about Draco and we're together and I hope that as my friends you can accept us."
"Sort of," Harry began hesitantly. "Goyle's mother has told us he's still in Germany, where he's been living for the last three years. Malfoy has heard from Zabini, but he didn't tell him a location. He's sure that Zabini will get curious and show up soon, though."
Draco kept his eyes fixed firmly on the wall, not allowing himself to look at Potter. Every time he glanced at the man, he was doing or saying something to surprise Draco and throw him even more off balance, something his next words proved beyond any shadow of a doubt.
Harry caught himself just before he shrugged again and nodded instead. "My shoulder's a bit sore is all." He rotated his left shoulder and grimaced, slowing his movements at the dull throb. Maybe Pomphrey could give him some sort of pain relieving potion in the morning.
"Well, someone's got to do it," said Potter, watching as Draco's tongue flicked out to wipe away a dab of butter at the corner of his mouth. The gaze made Draco feel self-conscious and he was unable to stop himself from fidgeting nervously in his seat.
When Draco did not respond, Blaise's expression became icy. "So that's it then. That's the reason you won't accept my apologies or my love. Because you're involved with Harry fucking Potter. Are you hoping his fame will wash the stain from your family name? Are you hoping you'll be able to finally show your face in public again if everyone believes you're Potter's latest fuck?" Blaise's lips stretched into a cruel smile as his voice turned dangerously soft. "Does he have a Death Eater kink, Draco? Is that what it is, is that why he's into you? Can he only get it up if you show him your Dark Mark? Or does he look the other way, pretend it doesn't exist? Is he
A hand touched his shoulder blade hesitantly and Draco turned his head to find Potter standing just behind him, the heat of his body radiating out to touch Draco with its warmth. It gave him the urge to step closer, fit his body along Potter's and bask in the intoxicating glow, somehow feeling even warmer than the flames licking heat along the front of him. Deciding against moving closer, Draco lifted one eyebrow inquiringly instead.
"My twat works perfectly fine, thank you very much, Draco," Pansy said sweetly, "but ta ever so for the concern."
"He shouldn't be gone, Padma," he whispered, voice soft but still so heavy with anguish. "Fuck, he shouldn't be gone!"
Sighing, he released Malfoy as they stepped back into the corridor, and Harry glanced over as the other group entered a room ahead of them on the opposite side of the wide hallway. He watched as the Slytherins entered their next room and began their search anew, listening to the murmured detection spells and revealing charms, and yet once again, were met with no results. The silence felt nearly stifling, weighing down on him like a boulder he would soon be crushed beneath.
Sighing again, Draco pulled out his wand and pointed it at the Gryffindors, casting a careful Cushioning Charm on the floor beneath them. He knew from firsthand experience how unfun it was to pass out on a hard floor after a night of drinking.
"Yep," Draco nodded. "I've just always found them to be fascinating creatures, haven't you? Well worthy of thinking about."
"Harry and I are together," Draco continued, looking down at the small crumpled figure of his once-proud father with pity, "and I want you to know that. We're in love and he is the one I choose to spend the rest of my life with."
remained somewhat synonymous. Quidditch had been one of the most freeing experiences in Harry's life; he had found such excitement and bliss on a broomstick, diving and twisting and evading other players; searching for the golden glint of the Snitch and keeping watch on the whereabouts of the Seeker out of the corner of one eye. And it had been Oliver who had first taken him and explained the sport; he had trained Harry and coached him and believed in him and they had even won the Quidditch Cup together one year.
"Yes—no, I—" Harry flung his hands up. "I don't know! I didn't mean it like that, Ron."
. The request made his entire upper body flush but Harry didn't laugh, he simply tightened his hold on Draco and rested his cheek against Draco's hair as they gently swayed in the deepening twilight slowly darkening the room around them, the encroaching darkness not seeming to bother either of them. As far as Draco was concerned, they could remain wrapped around one another for the rest of eternity. Harry was warm and he was safe and he was
"No!" Draco shook his head frantically. "No, don't." This time it was Draco's turn to shift closer as he reached out to grasp at the collar of Harry's pyjamas, a pair he had once again borrowed from Malfoy. "You're wearing my pyjamas," Draco said in wonder, sounding as though he did not believe his own words, "you're in my bed. Harry…"
"It doesn't make you weak, Draco," Pansy sighed, pulling him to a halt to level him with a serious stare. "Just because you were caught smiling fondly at Potter doesn't make you some weak, needy thing all of a sudden, you know."
Fuck. He should run. He should leave. He should never have gone into that fucking garage or ever tried to play detective. What the hell had he been thinking? What could he possibly do against whoever was in there? What had Draco—
"Ah." Draco had no idea who this Abrahams was but assumed him to be a well-respected Auror if Harry spoke about him with such confidence.
Eventually, after a long struggle, they were both finally upright, Malfoy leaning heavily into Harry as he struggled to draw breaths through his pained whimpers.
Maybe he wasn't the right Auror for the case anymore. Maybe someone like Neville could do a better job. Maybe Harry should speak to Wescott about getting reassigned to another part of the investigation. Maybe that would be better for all of them.
All four of them frowned as they glanced between the rooms the two men were being kept in. Harry wanted to rub at his temples or tear at his hair; nothing was making sense. Every new thing they learned only made him more and more confused. He knew they needed to speak to Zach, but a large part of him was reluctant to, terrified that it would only serve to deepen his confusion instead of answering any of his questions.
The question startled Draco, who instantly dropped his gaze back down to his lap. "I dunno," he shrugged, blushing fiercely. God, why did Harry have to go straight to the hardest question? What should Draco say? What was Harry hoping to hear? Draco's heart was hammering in his chest; his limbs tingled, and his palms felt damp. What if Draco decided to be honest and confess his feelings, only for Harry to laugh cruelly in his face before leaving him alone once more? What if that his twisted vengeance for everything Draco had done to him?
, for fuck's sake. The Boy-Who-Lived-To-Be-A-Bloody-Prat-To-Draco. He just had to keep reminding himself of that. And Potter was there on
"If you keep staring at me like that, Potter," the Slytherin said suddenly, eyes still studying the chessboard with a frown, "then I will surely lose to
"What are you doing?" he asked, checking the door behind her to see if he could spot a difference. It did not appear to be any different than it had been before.
"Oh, right," he responded lamely, but Draco ignored him.
Blaise stared back at her even more incredulously. "What do you mean
"Seek?" he whispered, already berating himself for his stupid impulsiveness.
Crossing the room, he took off his jacket and tossed it over the back of the sofa, heading to the kitchen for a lager. Spelling the lid from the bottle, he took a long swallow, muscles aching from the intense training Robards had them undergoing at work. "Fucking slave driver," Harry groaned, rolling his head from side to side and feeling the muscles in the back of his neck burn—his upper body felt as though it had been set on fire.
In which food is thrown, inappropriate dinner topics are brought up, alcohol is once again consumed, and the author gets a bit carried away with the banter.
A sudden shadow on the wall made Draco freeze and he automatically reached for the switchblade, heart pounding. The sound of the knife being flicked open made the shadow on the wall freeze as well, and Draco's racing heartrate somehow tripled as the shadow moved toward him.
"A Face Devoid of Love or Grace"
"I'm mostly wondering," Nott continued, "how you plan to get any information out of him. What if he won't tell us how he trapped us in the house? Are you planning on threatening him? Torturing him? Asking nicely and hoping he'll give in?"
The deep growl of his motorcycle was a familiar, comforting sound. Harry shifted on the narrow seat, feeling the machine vibrate beneath him. Pollution spilled from the lip of the exhaust pipe in thick streams of smoke, rising up in the hot summer air like a cloud fallen from the sky, desperate to return to the heavens. The thought made Harry grin. Nothing about him was heavenly, especially the growling metal he was sitting astride. He glanced around at his brothers, his grin tightening at the sight. They looked dangerous; he felt dangerous being near them. After spending years of his life being nothing more than a football for his family to kick around, he loved the knowledge that now, he was not a person anybody would want to fuck with. He was intimidating now in a way he had never been as a child, and he loved the feeling. He would never be anybody's football ever again.
He raises his wand, most likely to perform the necessary preparation and lubrication spells, but I wrestle it from him and toss it away. I'm not sure of what kind of game he's playing, but I'm not about to make it easier or more enjoyable for him.
"You dirty shameless hustler, Potter," Blaise drawled. "I'll have to owe it to you if you insist, you improper little ruffian."
"Ha what?" she asked, tilting her head in confusion.
"But you're not getting over this either," Ron pointed out, and Harry lifted his head to glare at the stupid statement.
Everybody laughed and cheered, raising their drinks in salute to Harry, who grinned back.
"You know," Pansy waved her hand impatiently, "that tusks thing. Give the prat some bloody tusks."
"No, Harry, please!" Malfoy wept, and Harry was shocked to see a tear slide down his cheek. "Please, you have to believe me, I don't know what just happened! It was like this…this blinding rage that I couldn't even breathe through! I wasn't even aware of what I was doing until—"
Standing hastily, Harry hurried after the swirl of blue robes ahead of him, catching up to Malfoy quickly enough and falling into step beside the man. As they left the library and entered the same large hallway Harry had initially been led through, he was once again swept away at the grandeur and sheer size of the house. There was thick carpet covering the floor, as well as portraits and various works of art lining the walls, the two men passing door after door as they continued to walk down the extravagant corridor. The doors were all large and beautiful, and every one different from the others. They passed one that was a deep brown color, the wood oiled and slick-looking. The knob was large and brassy and there was some sort of pattern painted across the wood that Harry could not make out as they passed. The next door was a beautiful chocolate color, smooth and unblemished, but with an even larger, more ornate golden handle and two tiny colored panes of glass set in the very middle. The double-doors after that were a creamy beige color, with shimmery white petals painted along the wood, circling delicate silver handles. The next set was a deep cherry red with strange shapes and intricate patterns carved into each door, with two oval-shaped onyx handles.
"Okay," Pansy whispered, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
their time staring at him and plotting his death? Draco was more than capable of inspiring such intense obsession in a person—he was obviously talented like that, even if the world refused to admit that inspiring fanatical hatred throughout a nation could be just as impressive as inspiring fanatical love; they were both fanatical forms of obsession, after all.
When was the last time Harry had felt properly angry? Was it before or after he had spotted Fred's body lying unmoving amongst the rubble, George's grief heavy in the back of his throat all the way across the room? Before or after he had seen Neville and Oliver carrying Colin's stiff body back inside the castle? It had been so hard not to think about what Dennis's reaction would have been.
"I-I don't—" Draco stammered, unsure how to respond.
"Well, yes," the other man shrugged. "Your point?"
"In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 7"—Alfred, Lord Tennyson
"Oh, Potter, you bloody Gryffindor hero," Malfoy sighed, resting his head back against the wall as he regarded Harry with serious eyes. "This really is you, isn't it? You really are the absolute epitome of chivalrous heroism. You really are just as selfless and benevolent as the world claims you to be."
Draco shrugged, unsure how to tell his friend that Wolf was slowly becoming the main reason he smiled so rarely. He had no idea how to confess that the only times Draco ever really felt like he could breathe anymore were the times when Fenrir was out on club business. He wasn't sure when exactly that had happened, or when real affection had begun turning towards fear, nor was he sure what to do with the knowledge. It was not something he liked to think about. It all just…was.
Harry snorted. "I'm sure they're just waiting 'til morning to offer."
"I…" Malfoy looked utterly baffled. "I'm not sure that I understand the question. I'm not sure if there isn't anything I wouldn't be willing to do. I mean, are you looking for me to say that I wouldn't be willing to slaughter an innocent person or something?"
The man said nothing, simply stared at him in frustration for several long minutes. The only sounds Draco could hear were the rustle of wind through the trees, the cawing of birds in the distance, and the musical trickle of the nearby stream. Refusing to break the silent contest of wills, Draco folded his arms and sat back in his chair, waiting. He did not have to wait long.
Harry thought? What had he actually been expecting? That one night with him would change Malfoy forever? This was
"That's the one," Harry snapped his fingers, still grinning. "I knew it was something with faces and bits."
At the words, Harry nodded, feeling his insides freeze over completely, and he had to fight the urge to laugh hysterically. "No chance at ever falling in love…" he echoed softly, feeling as though all the blood in his body had somehow been replaced with snow. He could not remember ever feeling colder in his entire life, not even that time as a child when Uncle Vernon had locked him out of the house in a snowstorm for speaking back to Aunt Petunia, refusing to allow Harry back inside until he was sobbing his apologies through blue lips the color of ice.
Harry was pretty much resigned to the fact that it would be this way forever.
kinky," Zabini snorted. "I never knew that was the sort of thing you were into, Theo."
"What?" Ron cut in, leaning closer to them both. "This about the whole 'going public' thing again?"
. And you fucking tell me
? Are you reading
Ron chuckled as he took another bite of his dinner. "I'll get right on that," he said in amusement.
The others agreed and set off, allowing Draco and Harry to bring up the rear. Draco glanced down at the warm fingers entwined with his own, looking back up to Harry's face only to find the man already staring at him.
"Come on now, Draco," Blaise tutted, crossing the room and ripping the blanket from Draco's clenched hands. "It's time to get up. Hurry up now. Don't make me get Pansy, because I will, so help me god."
How much did the Slytherin in front of him know? Could he be trusted to keep silent? Even though Harry didn't want him to? He wanted to be with Draco and he wanted everybody to know it; he was tired of having to keep his feelings a secret. "Not too long after term started," he admitted.
"If it's only to call me a whore again, I think I'll pass," Draco replied sarcastically, but his heart was pounding fiercely in his chest and he felt extremely vulnerable standing there in his pyjamas.
beautiful smile—spread across Malfoy's lips. "Maybe we are," he agreed, eyes scanning Harry's face with an intensity that made the brunet shiver with sudden nerves. Malfoy shifted a centimeter closer, and Harry turned his head away with sudden apprehension, breaking the stare as he took a small step forward.
"Blaise! Fucking answer me!"
"Yeah, right before you gut me just like you did her?" Smith raised his chin defiantly, and Harry and Hermione both had to hold Ron back at the accusation.
Humming happily, Malfoy's lips left his as he began to spread kisses down Harry's neck, scraping his teeth over the skin of Harry's throat. A breathless groan escaped Harry, and at the sound, Malfoy tightened his hold on him, pressing himself even harder against the brunet, keeping him trapped between Malfoy's warm body and the cold stone wall behind him and feeling nearly dizzy from the stormy mix of emotions crashing through him like angry tidal waves. He could feel desire and confusion warring with one another, and he honestly could not say which was the stronger of the two.
The other feeling that smashed into him at the words was a relief so intense it was nearly crippling. Both Greg and Blaise—the bastard—were safe. They hadn't been stolen from Draco the way everybody else had. But the universe seemed intent on continuing to punish the blond, and he knew there was still time to lose them as he had lost the others.
The moment the girl left, Ron burst out laughing, face nearly ending up in the same pile of eggs as earlier as he bent over and howled, and Harry wondered with annoyance why the git didn't just move the damned plate if he was going to keep insisting on laughing like a maniac.
Potter grit his teeth. "That's not what I meant, Malfoy!"
"Your house-elf cooked, I think, Malfoy," Ron explained, watching Harry continue to gaze around. "I wasn't sure if he was going to follow you or stay at the Manor, but all the food was already made by the time we got up." As he spoke, his blue eyes studied them both, flicking between the two of them, and Harry felt his cheeks go warm under the scrutiny.
"All right," Harry said, slipping his arm from Parvati's grasp and tightening his grip on his wand. "I'll go in first. Malfoy, I want you to stay in the back behind the girls, all right? I don't want anybody sneaking up on them from behind." He saw the sisters exchange a loud look.
"Sure, Potter," he said softly, suddenly feeling far too aware of the ridiculous way his arms swung when he walked. He tried to hold himself still but felt even more ridiculous for the sudden stiffness in his joints. Lord, how had he forgotten how to walk like a normal person? Were his steps too big? His pace too slow? Did he walk with his feet too far apart? Should he put his hands in his pockets to keep his arms still or would that just make him look like a twat?
"No," Harry said in a low, scratchy voice. "We need to check."
"A knife?" Ron asked, eyes narrowed as he stepped up beside Harry. "He used a knife? There haven't been any signs of an actual weapon outside of a wand being used. Why would the killer change it up now and use a knife instead?"
Dread slithered down Draco's parched throat, sliding into his lungs and stomach to join the terror already pooled there. "Vince," he whispered, shrinking back as Greg's teeth snapped together.
"Hello?" he answered breathlessly, glancing at Harry with worried eyes before struggling to free himself from the tangled blanket.
"You're going down there to
"I don't have a name yet," Cae admitted, but there was a proud glint in his eyes. "But we're close, Harry, I can feel it, we're so fucking close." His fingers twitched like he was fighting the urge to reach out to Harry.
"No," Weasley shrugged. "I mean, he dated my sister and they lived together for a bit and everything. But I'm pretty sure he likes blokes, too, and I'm damn certain he's interested in Cae."
"No," Harry shook his head. "You two need to stay here and keep everyone from panicking. And keep Smith from talking as much as possible. Just keep everyone calm and I'll go find the Slytherins and bring them back, all right?"
Stupid organs.
"And you reek of arrogance and zero tact," the other man retorted. Still chuckling, Potter cracked his neck and glanced around the room. "So, any luck with finding Goyle or Zabini?"
Groaning in frustration, Draco squirmed, kicking his legs in an attempt to widen them. The desperation of his movements made Harry smile as he sat back far enough to pull one of Draco's shoes off, dropping it past the edge of the blanket in the sand before tugging his denims free from that leg, allowing Draco to spread his thighs with a sigh of relief. He laid his cheek down on the blanket, back tensing as Harry went right back to the trail of kisses he had been spreading, kissing around the bits of the dragon tattoo that he could reach.
dare you. Third of all, it would be Blaise who would have to raise himself up to
Would it still make a difference if Draco were to tell him? Or was it too late? But even if Draco did tell him how he truly felt and Harry returned the sentiment, would it not simply put them right back where they had been before the awful fight? Harry would still want to shout their involvement from every tower in the castle, and Draco would still be a pathetic coward too weak to be seen in public with the Chosen One.
"I'm sorry for leaving," he said, eyes searching Seek's face for answers he had no questions to.
"Really?" Seek seemed surprised. "I was thinking you were older."
Wanting to test it, Harry hesitantly brought one hand up to rest against one of Cae's collarbones at the same time he awkwardly curled the other hand around the man's shoulder. The kiss deepened and Caelix sighed into it as he tangled one hand in Harry's hair, the other resting on his chest. Harry's heart was pounding as he fought the urge to step back and break the embrace, unsure what an appropriate length of time for a first kiss should be. Eventually, Harry had to pull back to breathe, but Caelix refused to detach his mouth, planting kisses in a path along Harry's neck. His throat felt hot and Cae's breath was warm, but the tiny metal hoop was somehow cool and felt strangely erotic sliding over his bare skin.
Deciding the best route to take would be to ignore how flustered he most definitely was
. And I think a part of her didn't actually believe that you were. I think she just thought you were saying that to get rid of her."
Okay, honesty time! How many of us have been waiting for Zacharias to die? If you have, you are in luck 'cause guess what time it is, my friends? That's right, it's time to play the fun, fun game called
"Right," Draco echoed. Seek had not asked for a single thing in return, nor had he once mentioned anything about Draco owing him a favor.
Wood finally arrived on the frozen steps of Hogwarts the crisp morning before Christmas Eve, clutching his broomstick and looking windswept. Harry met him in the Entrance Hall and they headed down the stairs to walk the winter grounds together, sun dazzling and bright against the miles of white snow.
Draco watched his unexpected retreat with a frown, brain slowly coming to a conclusion that he had never once paused to consider as a reason for Potter's insistent stalking. Wandering back over to his two friends, Draco took a seat in a slight daze, unsure just what it was he was feeling.
"And one of us has better manners."
Blaise raised one eyebrow at him. "Well, isn't someone just a right little ray of sunshine today. Don't take your inner turmoil out on us just because we're here, Draco."
"She's already dating someone," Pansy smirked.
at me and sorry I ever even existed in the first place to be met and spoken to and looked at. Seriously, Potter, I won't stop you. Go ahead and tell me what an awful reprehensible disgrace of a human being I am and how you wish you'd never—"
"Draaaco? Hellooo?" A voice was saying something, Draco could hear it. But everything was dark and he could not quite make out what the words meant. "Draaaco?" the same sing-song voice tried again, but still, Draco could not quite seem able to climb out of the dark pit he was trapped in; he could not respond to the voice from such depth and darkness.
Any suspects, my darlings? Any suspicions you may be harboring? Any plans for the weekend or stories of drunken shenanigans you wanna tell me about? I am here to listen to it all! :)
"Yes," Draco continued in the same slow tone. "You are both employed by the Ministry of Magic, the largest employer of witches and wizards in the nation. It should not be too difficult to find co-workers to surround yourself with if you are absolutely required to speak to one another." He paused to fix Harry with a stony look. "You don't trust Blaise and do not want him near
Seek was silent for several moments. "All right," he finally said. "I'll be waiting for you."
"Are you saying I have to watch my back for you?" Cae arched a dark eyebrow, lips twitching.
Harry asked, feeling shock course through him. "Astoria Greengrass?
Lord, if Draco had to lose his mind, could he not have at least lost it to a less imbecilic and hypocritical hallucination?
The words spread even more heat through Harry's body, sending fire racing through his veins and across his flesh until he was certain that the blush had not only covered every inch of his skin but also consumed his entire insides as well. Was Malfoy saying that…what did he…
"Exile"—Marjorie Pickthall
Gritting his teeth and forcing down his fury, Harry began to quietly murmur the very limited amount of healing charms he knew, tracing his wand over the wounds and watching as they began to close and gradually vanish, leaving Malfoy's skin still slightly puffy and swollen, covered in dark flakes of dried blood and a slight yellowish tinge where the bruises had been. Harry cast the gentlest cleaning charm he knew, siphoning as much of the blood off the other boy's face as he could, all whilst studiously ignoring the confused look Malfoy was giving him.
Finally, most of it was gone and they found themselves lying tangled together on the most comfortable couch, lazily feeding each other desserts and occasionally exchanging chocolate-flavored kisses. Harry rested his weight on one elbow, leaning over Malfoy and stealing a kiss before lowering a thick strawberry into his mouth, watching in fascination at the way Draco bit it slowly, tongue running over his lips to capture any juices as he chewed with half-lidded eyes before swallowing smoothly. How had Harry never before noticed how erotic strawberries were? The tips of Draco's teeth were impossibly white against the deep red of the fruit and it made Harry's heart race. God, was there anything more beautiful or enticing than Draco Malfoy?
But would he ever be able to live up to the promises he had already made Malfoy? Without a doubt, Harry would give his life for the blond, but what if that wasn't enough? What if not even sacrificing his own life would be enough to guarantee Draco's safety? Harry certainly did not have to be alive for his promise to be broken, after all. He had promised, so many times, that Draco would not be hurt, and he would give his life in a heartbeat to fulfill such a vow, even though there would be no way to uphold it after he was dead. But he had meant what he said—he would die before allowing any harm to come to Draco. After all, Harry had made him a promise and he fully intended to keep it.
"Just go bed, Blaise," Draco sighed.
bloody obvious?
He kissed him hard and flicked his wrist, adding the twist to his stroke that Draco had done to him last time. That was all it took before Harry was swallowing the blond's groan and feeling himself come, as well. They stayed like that for several moments, just leaning against one another, trading gentle kisses before Draco pulled back and looked down at himself, nose wrinkled in distaste. "There is no chance in hell of me showing up to class in this state," he declared.
But instead, it seemed to be growing larger and more insistent. With every smile Harry cast his way, every gentle touch of his hand, every time he whispered
Harry grinned to himself, wondering if Draco was just as desperate to know more about Harry as Harry was to know more about Draco.
Christmas morning found Harry still in Draco's bed, still wrapped around Draco. Rubbing his eyes and wishing for coffee, Harry sat up slowly before noticing two piles of presents waiting at the foot of their bed—the house-elves had apparently known to deliver all his gifts to Malfoy's room. He stared at the boxes and felt a twinge at how much larger his own pile was compared to Malfoy's. Having celebrated far too many birthdays and holidays with Dudley, Harry knew how many gifts his spoilt cousin had both expected and received, and Harry was sure that that did not come anywhere close to the extravagance of the Christmas mornings that Draco was used to.
all right, and I sure as hell am not
"Well, you see now," Wisp lowered his voice as he also leaned in closer, "that's the thing. He
"As many times as he can get it," Draco said with a smug smile.
"Right," Cae grinned, turning to face the barmaid as she drifted over to him. "Vodka tonic," he addressed her.
"Er, right, well, thanks," he offered awkwardly as he sipped at the water.
When? I thought you said just the idea was disgusting, Draco! You threatened to be sick all over me for even asking if the two of you were involved!" Blaise looked outraged and Draco had no choice but to huff a quiet laugh. "And you!" Harry turned to the other boy. "What about all that bollocks about you being the most heterosexual thing on the planet?!"
Ignoring the twinge in his shoulder, Harry jogged over to him. "Where are Parkinson and Zabini?" he asked, peering around for sight of them.
Once in the hallway, he made the quick decision to stop by Wescott's office next. The situation regarding Zabini was quickly explained, Harry choosing to keep his suspicions about the man to himself for the moment, at least until Neville got back to him with his results.
"What's going on, Harry?" Hermione interrupted before Harry could come up with a retort—a retort he had no doubt would have gone down in the history books as the wittiest and most scathing retort ever uttered.
"Did you mean it?" Malfoy repeated, silver eyes large and close and framed by a face so beautiful that Harry could scarcely believe it to be real. Was Malfoy truly this ethereal or was Harry simply biased by his (admittedly foolish) feelings toward the teen?
"She's okay, though."
"Not what I meant, you prat," Harry said in amusement.
She snorted loudly. "I'm sorry, your what kind of cock?"
"Okay, Harry," she said eagerly, pushing her plate away from herself.
"I'm not sure if I can explain it," she said apologetically, hesitating before continuing. "One moment, everything was normal, Crispin and I were talking, and the next everything just felt strange, as if the air was somehow…wrong."
think it's good. That's what I wanted to talk to you about—to know. If—you know, if you think it's good, too. Er, do you? Think that? It's good, I mean?"
Hermione sighed. "That seems like quite a high number for this sort of thing. I feel as though there are too many unstable variants involved for anything more than two people to be responsible. But it is always a possibility."
not such a fun game now," Harry muttered, feeling petulant. Ron gave him a look and Harry sighed. "Oh, all right, fine then."
Opening the folder, he quickly began scanning the report, eyes widening in surprise. "She was killed differently?"
"I sincerely hope it's just a Muggle superstition because I'm quite sure I've done enough horrible things to warrant far more than an individual's fair share of bad karma," Draco sighed.
"You know, Weasley," Pansy said in amusement, "before our little drinking adventure, I never would have figured you for such a fucking prude."
"Michael," a soft voice said, and everyone turned to find Padma walking up to Michael, who began to slow his struggles as he stared at her with helpless eyes, breathing heavily. "Michael," she repeated, stepping close enough to cup his jaw with two trembling hands. "It's okay, Michael," she whispered. "It's okay."
Draco blushed, cheeks pinkening as a coy smirk slid across his face. "Is that right? You're sure you don't want the rest of the food going to waste? You did buy an awful lot of sandwiches."
Potter? What
As though summoned by the sound of his name, Draco dropped down into the stands in front of them. "Pansy, Blaise," he nodded before turning to Harry and smirking. "And there's the runaway Chaser. My team scare you away, then?"
The effort to keep himself in control was demanding all of Harry's focus. Concentrating on his breaths, he ignored Zabini and managed to somehow not hit his smug face. It would hardly bode well for Harry if he were to physically attack one of the targets under his watch whilst on duty. If Zabini lived through this, then Harry could always find him after and they could revisit the conversation.
"I just don't…" Draco dropped his gaze to the floor. "I just don't know if I'm ready for…
She huffed a laugh. "How well you know me, Ronald Weasley. I'll add love potions to the list of archaic legalities I intend to abolish, then."
The same viscous silence from earlier began to creep back into the room at the close of Harry's words. Was that all there was to say about the case? Would they be forced to discuss the whatever it was between them now, or else go mad from the quiet? Already Harry felt half-crazed. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Caelix preparing to speak, and he
Fuck. Why did Harry have to cheat like that? Why did he have to speak in such a soft voice and why did he have to touch Draco so gently and why did he have to look at him in that way—the way that suggested that Draco was the only person in the entire world that Harry looked at? Damn Harry and his damn sweetness and damn kind-hearted consideration. And damn Draco's overwhelming attractiveness that made someone as sweet and kind and considerate as Harry want to fuck him as desperately as Harry obviously wanted to. Damn it.
"You're almost as scary as Weasley," Blaise snickered, waving Draco's ire away with a casual hand.
. And at that point, Draco would take anything.
Draco raised one eyebrow, clearing his throat.
"Not much of a morning person, is she?" said Harry in a dry voice, and the others all shot him a flat look.
"Seriously, Harry," he said suddenly, voice more urgent than before. "Take the others and look out for them. Neville should be back soon. I'll take a quick check upstairs and make sure everything's all right. It's probably just the storm, but I won't feel okay until I check. If I don't find anything, I'll come back down and find you lot. If I
I love that you want it to be special because that's what I want, too." Harry nuzzled into Draco's touch and sighed. Of course it would be special.
Every inch of her skin was blackened and charred from the severity of the burns canvasing her, forming a brittle onyx shell around her frame. The flesh had melted right off in areas along her scorched body until the sight of several brown sand-colored bones were peeking through the crisped remains covering her burnt skeleton, looking as though she had been wrapped in old, rough leather. Her waist-length sheet of yellow hair had been entirely seared off, every single honey-colored strand now gone, leaving her body appearing especially small and fragile-looking. Her eyes had melted away to leave the blackened sockets empty and gaping, and her mouth was twisted horribly in an agonized scream. One leg was bent at an unnatural angle and her chest appeared to have caved in. The fingers of both hands were curled into tight claws, arms stretched out as though she had been attempting to crawl away, and Harry felt bile rise up in his throat at the sight of the fingernail scratches littering the umber wood of the floor around her.
enjoyed seeing
"Well, thank god for you and your logic," Parkinson said, and Harry noticed a somewhat pleased expression cross Hermione's face at the words.
fucking deserved you in the first place, Draco."
"Would you rather have Potter hate you for telling him?" Blaise asked in the same quiet voice. "So maybe things between you two didn't start out the way they should have, but if you've changed your mind and decided you really do want to be with him, then just be with him, I don't see the problem."
The question was spoken in a quiet, subdued voice, and Draco unfroze as he looked up from the parchment to stare Greg in his fearful brown eyes. Was Gregory next? God, Draco hoped not; he had known Greg his entire life and could not let anything happen to him. The man was the only friend he now had in the entire world.
"And yet," Draco retorted, "your mum is the more infamous shagger."
"Well, you can hardly believe everything you hear, now, can you, Draco?" Daphne sighed patronizingly, sounding as though she was being forced to explain something simple to a very small, very slow child. "Having had as much bad press as you have, I would think that
"Come on, Harry," Ginny said quietly, pulling him toward the door, but Harry could see her looking back at Malfoy, a thoughtful expression on her face, and Harry wondered what she was thinking.
"I'm glad you're here," he murmured into Harry's ear, earning a smile.
"Oh fuck off, you pair of cunts," she said crossly, folding her arms.
"But what does that mean?" Harry scrambled after him. "Are you seriously leaving? Draco, what the hell is going on? Just talk to me!"
"All right," Draco ground his teeth and rubbed his temples, glaring down at the library table. "That is it. I can't take this anymore!"
Well, at least the encounter had proven one thing—Harry had never been under the influence of a love potion. If he had been able to refuse Draco like that and been able to walk away from the blond, even telling him to never speak to him again, Harry clearly was not under any sort of magically-induced compulsion to be near the other boy. Hermione had been wrong about the potion but right about Harry not being able to trust him.
"Really?" Malfoy definitely sounded amused now. "And how do you imagine that conversation would have gone?"
"Yep," Ron shook his head. "Just a big old box of rainbows you are. A giant sock full of happy kittens."
"Right," Draco nodded, inhaling several deep breaths. "I can do that; I can be around Muggles. I can speak to Muggles and be courteous. I'm a charming fucking bastard, damn it, I can do this." Draco would be so charming that by the end of the date, Potter would be even more in love with him than he already was.
Deciding to drop any pretense, Harry straightened and took a step nearer to Zabini, so close that their shoes were nearly touching. "Is that a threat?" He spoke in a quiet voice, one he had used dozens of times in his job in the past to intimidate criminals, both in the field and in interrogations.
"Right," Harry grinned, wrapping his arms around Malfoy's waist, "I had nearly forgotten."
"What?" he stared. "Why can't you clean us up yourself?"
Harry gave him a flat stare. "I mean for the five of you to be there as well, obviously."
He hums and lays his head back down, only to raise it almost immediately, nose wrinkling. Cool air rushes over my skin as he moves away, climbing from the bed to the pile of clothing near the wall. For a moment I panic, thinking he really did mean to just leave me alone after that.
Finally, Harry removed his fingers, rising from the bed to snatch up a condom from his nightstand, but Draco stopped him before he could climb back on top of the blond. He took the condom from Harry's hands and pressed a single kiss to Harry's shaft before tearing the plastic open and swiftly rolling the condom on Harry. He smiled as he settled back on the mattress, lying on his back and staring up at Harry with eyes that glittered in the dim lighting.
Harry desperately wanted to deny it, wanted nothing more than to inform Malfoy that he most certainly did
Blaise raised one eyebrow at Draco's glower. "Do you not want your boyfriend getting along with your best friend?"
"Watch me," Harry said coldly, glaring at the blond. He wasn't quite sure if he would call himself friends with the Slytherins, but he was surprised at how little he minded their company. He certainly minded it a lot less than spending time around someone such as Zacharias Smith. "Now move, Smith. We're going downstairs."
"So we just go back to sleep then, is that the plan?" Nott drawled, tilting his head.
"Two at once," Parkinson murmured, appearing shocked. Zabini crossed the room to enfold her in an embrace, one that made Harry's throat tighten even further.
"Harry," Ron said slowly, and Harry immediately tensed at the cautious tone in Ron's voice. "You're not talking about a girl, are you?" Harry felt himself grimace as Ron continued. "There's only one person in this entire school that you've ever felt that way about…and he is definitely not a girl."
see Seek later. Did he dare confess just how much Seek meant to him? But would that only hurt worse if the two of them ended up never seeing one another again?
"That's fine," Harry soothed, brushing the hair from his eyes. "You don't have to right now, Draco, it's okay. Everything's over and you're finally safe. You can talk about it when you're ready and I'll be beside you the entire time, I promise."
"And you so graciously volunteered for the job," Malfoy sneered.
Draco? Almost as if they were friends. Was that something that was even possible? Friendship with Gryffindors?
Inside, nestled between the deep navy velvet of the square box, was a small snake charm. The eyes of the creature were a deep emerald color, glittering brightly against the argent head they were set in. The body of the reptile was coiled gracefully together, pretty and delicate, the scales of the serpent a shining, glimmering silver, causing Harry’s breath to catch as he peered at it closely in awe. It was beautiful, and Harry lifted it from the box with careful fingers to discover a small chain attached.
At the thought of what his father would say, Draco grinned and decided that he had no problems with being friends with a Weasley, especially a Weasley that came so closely attached to Potter. The same Potter who was still staring between the two of them in bewilderment, making Draco want to laugh once more.
"I do not—" Draco began in outrage but was cut off by Blaise.
How could this be Lisa? How could Lisa be dead? She was still fully clothed; she had clearly not gone into the bathtub of her own free will.
"Yes, Potter, good idea," Draco smirked right back. "Feel free to plead for the chance to undress me."
"I know," Harry said heavily, feeling the same fear on the other man's face settle deep in his own bones. Draco was right. None of it made even an ounce of sense. "I know."
The door to the clubhouse opened, allowing light and noise to spill out. He saw a dark figure hurry down the steps, their bare feet slapping lightly against the pavement.
"Oh! Um, yes, actually," her blush was so fierce that Harry could almost see steam rising from her cheeks. "I was, um, wondering if…if maybe…"
Jogging to the broomshed, he yanked open the door and grabbed the first school broom he could find, desperate to be up in the air. When he was flying, he didn't have to think. All he had to do was
"Yes," he nodded. "It's in the very corner of the east wing and only has the entrance connecting it to the main hall."
"Thank me for what?" he wondered aloud. What was Malfoy possibly thanking him for?
? Despite the trepidation Draco still felt toward the spontaneous arrival of the Wizarding World's Saviour, he found himself intrigued. What had brought the All-Powerful Auror and Vanquisher of Evil knocking on Draco's door, looking so gorgeous and apprehensive?
"Pretty serious," Harry sighed, thinking back to that damned silver ring Draco wore on his thumb. God, he hated that stupid ring. "And it's not so much that he's unwilling to leave him. It's more like he's too scared to even consider it." Harry's fists clenched as he thought back to the flashes of fear he had seen in Draco's eyes whenever he talked about the mysterious Fen, whoever the hell the tosser was.
"Today…well, I got a present from some Ravenclaw girl today, a box of biscuits. And this person I'm talking about saw me eating them and freaked out and vanished the box, saying that I shouldn't even accept presents from anybody else because I was theirs and I belonged to them and all this insane jealous rot and even tried to force me to say that I belong to them. But then they got really upset and apologized for it and the apology really did seem real, but now I'm just not sure what it all means and if they're going to be like that again and I'm wondering if maybe it'd just be better for the both of us if I walked away from the whole thing now."
"Are you angry that he didn't tell you or are you angry that he knew the answer before we did?"
"Of course," Draco shrugged, feeling uncomfortable at the look of stunned amazement Potter was giving him, as if Draco had performed some sort of impossible miracle right in front of him. "I
"Somewhere else," was the only answer he received before Harry began tugging him toward the exit.

Frustration began building within Harry and he bit down hard on his impatience. What the hell was Caelix talking about? "You mean a wand?" Harry felt confused. How else had the crimes been committed? How else was the magic being channeled? "Can you find the wand?" he asked excitedly, but his face fell at the shake of Cae's head.
Potter nodded. "I need to speak to him."
"So you're saying you expect another person to die?" Ron raised an eyebrow.
"I hope you know what you're doing," she whispered into his ear.
"It's just you living here?" the Auror asked in puzzled amazement, dark eyebrows shooting up to disappear beneath the thick thatch of black hair hanging low over his forehead.
. Confidence meant nothing after you were dead.
"Keeping it," Oliver answered simply.
Broken and pining? Harry almost couldn't believe his ears. Had Draco Malfoy really just admitted to how much power Harry had over him? Had he really just admitted that Harry was capable of
"Oh," Harry said in surprise, feeling his heart rate somehow double, picking up speed until it was hardly even beating but more of a constant racing thrum in his chest. "Right. Um, thanks, I s'pose. But I was never worried about anything like that happening."
father's job. But the Dark Lord fell before my dad could give it to him, and then he died in the Hogwarts battle. So, I guess that makes it mine now," Greg smiled. "The Dark Lord was planning on taking back all the magic from the mudbloods who didn't deserve to have any. Do you know, Draco, where magic is? In wizards, I mean. Do you know where the magic is in a wizard?"
"Yeah, well," Ron rolled his eyes, "
Harry shifted in his seat, and Blaise was familiar enough with guilt by now that he could see it in Potter's movements. "What's wrong with him?" he repeated quietly.
Hermione rolled her shoulders, attempting to shake the stiffness from her muscles. "I think if we're going to give the fingerprints a try, we should go pull those first. Then we get the samples from Justin and Zacharias when we speak to them."
"S-someone killed M-M-Mandy," Padma sobbed, clutching at Parvati to keep herself upright. "I woke up and she w-wasn't in the bed next to m-me and so I got up to look for her, and—and—" she gestured toward the wall, unable to continue.
"Well, it's about time," said Granger, and Draco took back every nice thought he had about kissing her. "I mean,
The touch was so soft and intimate that Draco had no choice but to revel in it for just a moment, smiling to himself before reaching out to lift Harry's shirt high enough to begin planting lingering kisses across the lower half of his torso. Above him, Harry made a quiet noise of pleasure as Draco's tongue darted out to lick along the warm skin just above the waistband of Potter's jeans, and Draco couldn't resist biting down just a bit on the hard muscle of the other boy's abdomen.
Why would someone do that? And to Hannah and Mandy? Did they even have any enemies? Ever, at all, for any reason? I don't think I ever even heard Mandy speak before the party last night! And Hannah's got to be the nicest person I've ever met! This doesn't make any sense!"
"You told her…" Draco felt at a loss for words. "You told her…about
"Mostly," Malfoy said, staring down at Harry's chest rather than his eyes, "I just need to know if you would prefer it to remain a secret. I mean," a grimace crossed his face, "the other Slytherins all know, but you know that nobody listens to or believes a single word we say, which I suppose might be a relief in this case depending on what you would prefer."
"What do you mean?" Draco felt his forehead wrinkle in confusion. "Like, blackmail him with it or something?"
Oh, Christ, it felt good. Having Seek wrapped around him, pressed against him, touching him, and tangling their tongues together…Draco had never felt anything like it. He was lost in the kiss, lost in the heat of Seek's body, and Draco hoped he never had to resurface.
"Yes," she squeezed his hand again, voice still soft. "He knows how much you hate all the attention you receive. Maybe he's trying to protect you from receiving even more. You know once the Daily Prophet gets wind of your relationship, there's no stopping the entire nation from knowing. Maybe he's worried that you'll end up associating all the increased attention and constant speculation with him specifically and one day end up hating him for it."
Shirley Jackson,
"Yeah?" Harry whispered, uncurling Malfoy's fingers from his shirt in order to interlock their hands. He dropped a soft kiss onto Malfoy's knuckles and heard the man inhale sharply in response. "I wouldn't have guessed that, actually. I mean, Hermione was the one you sent that letter to. Ron and I only got the invitations."
"Draco, have you even read this story?" Blaise sighed, sounding exasperated.
The name set Pansy off laughing, nearly falling over as she cackled. "Oh god, I remember seeing the two of you together! I won't lie, that was very entertaining for the three of us. We got quite a lot of amusement out of that particular relationship."
"Come sit at my table then," the other boy urged, reaching down to grasp one of Draco's hands between both of his own and raise it to his chest.
"Shouldn't I be asking you that?" Potter retorted wryly, face softening into apologetic lines as Draco's lips thinned. "I'm fine, Malfoy. I just stayed too late at the pub last night, is all."
Slughorn didn't even glance into Harry's cauldron before awarding him an O and clapping him on the back in an overly friendly manner, at which Harry shook his head and sighed. He was sick of the special treatment Slughorn bestowed upon his favorites, Harry being number one amongst them. It only made him even more indifferent towards the subject. Why bother if the result was the same regardless? Why actually try if he was going to be rewarded just the same?
wardrobe, Potter," Blaise smiled innocently, ignoring Draco's glare. "It's far more interesting. Plus, most of the clothing Draco wears for you is in it, sooo…mine is the better wardrobe, really."
And he always would be.
After what felt like both a second and a century of gentle thrusts and slight adjustments, Harry's hips were nestled snugly against Draco's bum, and the blond couldn't help but squirm at the feeling of Harry fully encased inside him. But as the feeling continued, Draco began to grow impatient.
"Are you all right?" Draco asked hesitantly, glancing at Ron, who was glaring daggers back at the blond.
Draco allowed. "I'll see you around then." He stepped around Potter, preparing to march back to the table he was sat at with Pansy and Blaise, but before he could, he was stopped by a hand on his wrist, swinging him back around to face the dark-haired boy.
"I wanted to wait for you," Malfoy repeated quietly, eyes flicking down to the wand Harry still held in a tense fist. "There's nothing illegal about that, you know."
, he just knew it would be about what had happened between them the previous day.
"Hello?" a deep voice finally answered, and Draco couldn't help the little sob that escaped him at the sound. Seek was alive, at least, and well enough to answer his phone. "Draco?"
"I never said you had to," Blaise sighed, longing to rub the headache from his temples. Merlin, he knew the stubborn git was going to be a stubborn…well, git. "I just need you to listen."
A shadow suddenly eclipsed the dim lighting and they both jumped hastily away from one another as a voice called to them, "Are you boys finding everything all right then?" Glancing up, they found the light blocked by Slughorn's recognizable girth.
Harry felt nauseous. "And that's when it turns different?"
"Some fucking Auror you are," Smith spat, looking incensed. "Siding with the Slytherins as always, hmm? Real fucking surprise there, Potter!"
Draco sighed wearily.
She shrugged. "As if I've said, Draco, I've been with far more blokes than you have. And I tend to agree with Blaise—sex is selfish by nature. You can't measure selflessness against it."
Weasley huffed, glaring at Blaise.
Til next time, lovers!
"Exactly what I'm sorry about," said Caelix, unlocking his arms from around Harry's neck to slide his palms down to rest on Harry's chest. The touch was obviously meant to be comforting, but Harry wasn't sure what to make of the proximity. Caelix was so close; Harry could see every individual black eyelash. His heart was pounding and he wasn't exactly sure why. It was just Cae. Harry had known him for two years, after all, why should he suddenly feel nervous around the man? But he did feel nervous, and he was sure that Caelix could feel the hammering of his heart where it beat a rhythmic dent into his chest.
But then the man sat up, releasing Draco's wrists. "I could," he said softly, reaching down to wipe Draco's tears away with his thumbs. He lifted his thumbs to his mouth, tasting the salt of Draco's tears, and the sight made Draco flinch. "I could, Draco, but I won't." The words sent a feeling of relief so strong through Draco that it made his head spin. Fenrir wasn't about to force him into anything?
"T-tomorrow," he stammered. "Please, Fenrir, I just need to lie down."
"No, it's not," he answered, watching in amusement as the grip on Weasley's wand tightened. "You're about to get your arse kicked in chess."
"Don't worry, bitch," Harry said, smirking darkly down at the man, "you'll get your fucking truck back. One piece at a time."
for ten years," he argued. "We haven't
"I'm fucking sick of this!" Draco fumed, clenching the crinkled newspaper tighter between his fists. His angry footsteps seemed to echo off the walls and ricochet off every surface of the corridor. Stupid
at him for once again walking in on a crying, vulnerable Malfoy not wanting company.
At Potter's bold confession, Draco allowed his mouth to stretch into a filthy, sinful smile, one that made the other man's breath hitch audibly. "Perhaps not, but I have a very good idea of just how badly
"So, we're at this particular pub why?" Caelix wondered, sipping at the clear liquid and chewing on the end of the tiny black straw floating between clinking ice cubes.
He had a lot to think about.
Swallowing, she turned back toward him, tilting her face up to catch the moonlight, and he gasped again at the purple bruising encircling her left eye. It was puffy and swollen shut, looking tender and painful to the touch, and the sight made Draco want to tear Morgue's hands straight from his body.
"Oi," Ron grinned, "Harry's not the only hero here. You can go celebrate with Charlie if you like." He jerked his head in Charlie's direction, and the girl climbed to her feet, flushing darker before stalking off. "Be gentle with him!" Ron called after her, "He's a bit battered at the moment!"
He was gratified to hear no trace of tears in her voice. Ginny was strong, he reminded himself, she would be fine. "I can't really…I dunno, I just—I'm sorry," he shrugged evasively, not wanting to explain but knowing that he owed it to her. She was silent and he risked a glance up. There was a hard look in her eyes as she squared her jaw and nodded.
