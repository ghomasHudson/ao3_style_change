"Whatever, I hope that you don't treat other Harchers this way." He smirked at the displeasure on Potter's face. "Don't sneer, Potter. You don't have the facial structure for it," Draco teased as he poked Potter's furrowed brow, laughing harder when he was swatted away.
Reaching over, Harry felt the fabric of Draco's suit, gasping quietly when he felt the resonance of a glamour weaved subtly into it. Harry took a step backwards in shock. He had never seen Draco without a suit, and it must have been intentional. Draco wanted to conceal his pregnancy, but why? Harry felt his heart drop when the answer came easily to him. His eyes were hot and his limbs felt weak. Without knowing how he had made it out of his room, he closed the bedroom door. He wanted to hold Draco and to apologise but he was ashamed of himself.
"Have you told anyone anything that might have gotten back to him?" Pansy asked.
Pressing their nether regions close, he lined their cocks together in the loose circle of his fingers as he moved his hand up and down, twisting when he reached the underside of their swollen dick heads. Draco's breathing was ragged, a litany of Harry's name falling from his lips while he tugged on Harry's hair.
"Six giggle waters and two Butterbeers," she ordered cheerily when the bartender appeared. Draco plastered on a smile immediately as he squeezed Pansy's arm. He had been silly enough to entertain a crush on Potter, and trust Potter to solve his problem for him.
Draco had stopped agonizing about the differences between influenced Draco and normal Draco, instead allowing himself to freely misconstrue Harry’s attention for affection, and casual touches for the sentiment. He had made an escalating list of targets for himself, beginning with the brushing of hands and culminating with a kiss that he hoped to clear by today.
Draco Apparated to outside the Three Broomsticks with Pansy on his arm seven hours later, frowning as his best friend related the story of her latest run in with the largest swot at her fashion school. As he walked into the pub, Draco felt his shoulders loosen at the sight of Harry seated between Blaise and Luna.
, and
“Didn’t know that I could cook, did you?” Harry said smugly, misreading Draco’s shock and fear as a surprise.
by Pansy Parkinson
"You woke up rather early today," Draco offered.
To do list:
“Draco?” Harry asked as he sat up from his awkward slump on his mattress. His eyes went wide when he finally registered that Draco was awake, immediately transitioning to wakefulness. “I need to call the Healer,” he fretted in his seat, laughing brokenly when Draco pointed weakly at the buzzer by his hand.
"Can I tempt you with a bowl of beef noodles, Teddy?" Draco asked politely as his cousin continued to frown at the selection before him.
After considering the matter at length yesterday, Draco had come to the shocking realisation that he now considered the Golden Trio and some of his new acquaintances
Draco froze at the edge of Harry’s bed. “Why? Is it too long,” he asked, the flash of shock quickly replaced by confusion.
Nonetheless, it was undeniable that he had possibly outgrown his original friends in some areas. Pansy didn't always understand the topics of his new books, and frankly, she didn't quite care. "What do you think about abortion," he blurted, incredibly nervous as Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, catching him out for deflection.
Possible jobs:
With reference to the topic at hand, I believe that you would still prefer Muggle work wear? I would like to plan the shops to visit so we do not amble about aimlessly. Is your wizarding wardrobe properly sized and in fashion? Do consider that your attendance would be expected in key society events with your return to the United Kingdom.
"Well, maybe..." Potter tried, before shrugging reluctantly. "I don't know, okay?"
"You guys are not going to force us to drink your poncey drinks, are you?" Harry asked Malfoy as he cupped his hands around his steaming mug of mulled wine, relishing in its warmth. Harry was reacting poorly to the winter this year and would wear multiple layers even indoors.
countdown went off at half past ten, startling both Hermione and Draco. After a month and a half of close, amicable contact due to their scheduled studying and prefect sessions on top of their Arithmancy and Ancient Runes classes, Hermione had snapped one day and ranted about pureblood sensibilities and normal etiquette. Draco personally didn't think that their relationship had progressed to the stage of first names, but he supposed that was precisely the problem with pureblood etiquette. For the sake of progression, he had relented, and not calling Hermione by her proper last name had left him distinctly uncomfortable in the beginning. Pansy, as expected, had no sympathies and had waxed about thawing hearts and whatever bollocks.
"I'm with Ron at the Leaky for lunch. Are you okay? Please come by."
“Piss off,” Harry said, continuing to count. “Ginny and Luna, Seamus, Dean, Neville, Pansy, Hannah because she’s a great help during Transfigurations, and a few other eighth years,” he wrung his hands helplessly. “I’ve never had to buy so many presents before.”
Your date sounds like it'll be very violent. Can't believe that they agreed to go out with you at all. Do you need help from your wardrobe consultant?
“No, it’s not. It’s seven cakes only,” Harry argued as he paid for his purchases, ignoring the confused look from the usual cashier that had returned from her break.
transference of knowledge in any form. You wouldn't know fashion even if it hit you in the face!" For some strange reason unknown to Draco, Potter seemed upset by the statement. Regardless of his intention to reconcile with the Chosen One, Draco refused to apologise for it.
was still so new to him. What about secrets and things one wasn't confident to share just yet? It was so hard to make
Most of the eighth years had congregated at Three Broomsticks after a spot of shopping, and Parkinson had gamely volunteered the Slytherins to organise the next party. Hermione pursed her lips disapprovingly at the debauchery of her peers.
"On a side note, I would like to thank you for your support in our Inter-house Gift Exchange. We currently have ninety-eight per cent participation in our first round of exchange. Your prefects will be following up if you have not given your partner a gift. The second exchange will be in five days. Let's make someone happier this solstice."
"Inter-house unity," Ron announced at the gargoyle, quickly climbing the stone steps to the Headmistress' Office.
Tears were rapidly welling up in his eyes. He quickly cast a glamour on himself as he tried to wrestle with his emotions. He had spent so much time on the present, and it had all been for nothing at the end.
"Spin the bottle time!" Seamus yelled, crossing his legs as he settled at the edge of the common room.
Malfoy–no, Draco–seemed torn between exasperation and glee but the latter finally won out as he laughed with Ron and Hermione.
The sudden resurgence of the Malfoy who gave it as good as he got was overwhelming for Harry. Malfoy's shoulders were tight, his mouth twisted, and he seemed ready to leap at him for a fight. Harry hadn't realised how much he had missed this side of Malfoy. The tired, mousy demeanour disturbed him.
"How did you know that I was around?" Potter asked as he clumsily caught the gifts that Draco tossed over.
"Harry," Draco said quietly as he looked into the darkness of their room.
Draco awoke again to the sight of Harry staring straight at him, an arm on his waist. "Hi," he said nervously as he clutched at Harry's shirt, afraid that he would leave.
Draco sighed as he started to pack his books. As usual, Hermione was slow to move, reluctant to end her study session. It was impossible for Draco to imagine how she managed to function previously with only the company of Potter and Weasley, neither of whom were particularly academically inclined. When Draco had returned to school, he had worried about Theo's absence. Acing his NEWTs regardless of the war, Theo had begun working in Gringotts. It was nice to have company to bounce off ideas with again, and a reliable partner for Ancient Runes class once more, ex-Gryffindor or otherwise.
suspended before him. Focused on the contents, he did not seem to notice the book releasing heart-shaped bubbles from the top of its spine. Detaching after it reached a certain size, the bubbles vanished quietly after drifting too far.
Desperate for something to occupy his hands, he slid down the golden arrow that he had hidden in his sleeves, a reminder of his quota. Despite the pressure and the anxiety that came with it, the magical energy in the tool had come to be a familiar comfort. He had taken to play with them whenever he was alone, musing that he would use it whenever it struck him, but he had never been able to.
"Mate, did you read the chapter for Charms?" Ron asked after a while.
7. Drop him off at his house
"Well, I'm not saying that he's not old enough. I'm saying that you can't get it for him because you're too careless. You'll never teach him about safety and rules." Draco rolled his eyes as he squared his jaw in annoyance. "He would be injured the first minute he gets on if he was with you. I should be the one to get him the broom."
4. Finds you funnier than you actually are
Potter's eyes shot up quickly, blinking at him with an expression of shock as his cheeks pinked. "I can't believe that you take so much pleasure in my misery," he complained with a pout before dissolving into mumbles as he fidgeted in his seat.
Hermione frowned in disapproval. "But your pinching was likewise without consent. Couldn't you have found a better way to teach Harry?"
"Maybe you could teach me your detection spells too? Mine aren't as complex as yours," Harry said, looking at Malfoy as he pushed the parchment paper aside.
"I didn't mean that. I asked because I was evicted on a half day’s notice in Cairo." Harry explained desperately as he tugged at Draco's folded arms. "I didn't have much to pack, but I was homeless for three days."
Draco hurriedly conjured a mirror to inspect himself. He traced his under eyes worriedly. He didn't look so bad, did he? His WEEP report was due in three days, but there was simply too much to be covered. Between shadowing and interviewing the Aurors, the writing of his report and reading of the records and manuals had to be taken home.
"You keep going on about how we should know our place and all that bunch of crap, but what is that place exactly?
"No worries, Draco," Pansy said sweetly, her hand extending awkwardly, hanging in the air before she retracted it and waved at them.
"Potter, are we friends?" Draco asked as he pulled the menu closer to himself.
Privately, it was absolutely bizarre to hear his name on Malfoy's lips and he didn't think there was a need to change anything when it was fine–but everyone was looking at him and he didn't want to disappoint. He cleared his throat nervously, "I don't need your protection, Draco."
- - -
"Yeah, I was sure that they had an extension charm until I
Transfiguring the mug into a three-piece mirror, he startled at the sight of his mark.
"Merlin's pants, Malfoy. You're positively barking."
"Thanks," Harry mumbled, heart still racing from Malfoy's prior agitation. He returned to pull at the ribbon, strangely touched by Malfoy's concern. He had checked the present the moment he had returned to his room, but it was surprising to learn that Malfoy cared. He didn't want to seem ungrateful and turn Malfoy off by telling him the truth, and privately–after experiencing it once–he quite liked the idea of Malfoy worrying about him.
"Imagine having them working together in DMLE though." Weasley had a faraway look in his eyes as he thought about the top two students of their level enacting change from within the Ministry.
“Don’t cry, it’ll be okay,” he promised, trying his best to offer consolation for whatever that was plaguing Draco.
"Pansy," both Malfoy and Nott said at the same time, the former pleadingly while the latter in warning.
"Seamus has a ton of these that he leaves lying around. I used to lift some from him," Harry said as he flipped open to a random page, pausing at the picture of a man nosing at the length of a thick flaccid cock hungrily, his eyes fluttering as if intoxicated by his submission. Lifting the length on his face, he slides the cock into his mouth, lavishing in the weight of it on his tongue before replaying immediately. The both of them were entranced.
"It's for knowledge," Draco said quickly.
"Alright, that sounds good," Harry continued to nod. "No skipping lunch though," he pointed at Malfoy accusingly when he remembered. He mimicked Malfoy's eye roll.
"And you're an arsehole. Like you said, the biggest arse ever." Patting Draco on he back when he started to grumble about being insulted, Harry was aware that his anger had subsided. He shook his head quietly, resigned to the fact that he was too easily manipulated by Draco. Watching Draco cry made his heart ache and Draco would probably always have that in his arsenal.
, like his mistakes mattered less, and he would always fall asleep afterward drunk from the need to continue being worthy of it.
Luna hummed in agreement. "They're quite compatible, aren't they?"
“Are you okay?” Harry asked as he got onto his knees in a swift motion. “What happened?” He shifted closer, shocked when Draco’s face crumpled and the boy was suddenly in tears.
Harry opened his eyes as he shifted in his bed. He squinted at the blob topped with red hair on his right.
Draco smiled weakly when Harry removed the traces of tears on the both of them. He pulled Harry to lie beside him. Harry burrowed his face into Draco’s chest with a deep exhale.
"That makes me a small WEEP. Or a tiny WEEP."  Harry's right dimple was showing, his eyes shining as he beamed at Draco.
Draco huffed as he pressed his face into Harry's chest, “if you must,” he huffed and Harry laughed fondly at the grudging reluctance in his tone.
"Where is Harry then?" Draco asked as he returned to the checkout counter, simultaneously greeting his colleagues in the hallway with a nod of his head.
1. Code word
"Stop with that crawling thing," Potter groaned. "Just a few days ago I was wondering if I’m going to wear out the knees of my trousers. Me, thinking about this rubbish!" Potter pinched the bridge of his nose as he sighed. "But it's actually nice though, I think. It's nice being a Hufflepuff."
Draco sighed as he flipped the parchment to continue. Ever since Vincent's death, he had not flown a broom, and regardless of the confidence he had rebuilt for himself within the student body, he was aware that society would not be as forgiving. He required outstanding grades to differentiate himself, and mucking around on a broom would bring him no advantage.
"Fuck off, Malfoy," Potter rolled his eyes as he crossed his arms before him with a deep frown.
Draco felt his dismissive amusement waiver. He knew that Harry's media shyness had allowed the media to twist his image and portray him according to their narratives. Consequently, the public had come to see him less for his achievements and more as a figure they could attach their fantasies and delusions onto—Harry Potter looked sad and troubled, maybe he needed a warm motherly hug, or the shoulder of a lover—and the circus would start. People would mob him and, apparently, also send him soiled panties. Harry was slumped over the empty glass, adamantly evading his eyes as the table looked at him in anticipation.
Draco was at his most charming of the semester that night. He downed giggle waters with Luna, sparred with Hermione about the rights of magical creatures and ways to provide more opportunities for their prefects, talked to Thomas about Muggle art history, found out more about Abbott's Muggle aunt who was a nurse, shared with girl Weasley what he knew about the recruitment trials of the different Quidditch teams, and listened about Greg's latest project and his trips to the Design Museum and the Geffrye Museum. He would hold conversations across tables, swap seats to talk to people, keeping himself engaged as he ignored the weight of Potter's eyes throughout the night.
"Yes, there were. I like rules so I would have set them up," Malfoy said, swiping his fringe backwards huffily before crossing his arms in a sulk.
Draco gasped at the suggestion as he whipped his head to look at the boy. "
"I would advise you to stick close to Blaise, Granger, Thomas, and Lovegood if she'll have you. Wait for Potter to fold. I'll give him a week at most. Tonight at best."
," he said with thick sarcasm in reference to the administrative changes and naming formats Draco had enacted in the department. "The folder should be twinned because I'll need to follow up with the outcomes of my suspicions. It should also be tied to our magical signatures and locked with a password for privacy."
It was so horribly perverted that Draco could no longer wank to his calendar, and the subsequent dry spell had left him mentally susceptible. When he had been cleared to attend the potions conference in Paris, Draco had—horror of horrors—imagined surreptitiously meeting Potter in Paris, even going so far as to entertain the idea of loitering around the Pride's pitch to surreptitiously meet Potter like a lovesick Harcher.
“You’re a very nice person, Draco Malfoy,” he said as he bumped Draco’s shoulder amicably.
“I’ll miss you too,” Harry admitted as he smoothed a hand across Draco’s milky skin. “Maybe we could visit Muggle London after the New Years? Or you could visit the Burrow with your mother. Teddy and Andromeda would be there," he suggested.
He silenced the portrait in embarrassment, heedless of Titus the Timid's muffled shouts while he listened for footsteps.
"No way," Ron replied immediately, twitching in his seat as he tried to suppress the urge to round the bed to look at Harry's mark. "Can't believe your luck, mate."
"No, you're supposed to sweep me off my feet," Draco corrected.
Malfoy rolled his eyes as he dipped his quill. "Don't disrupt my concentration, Potter."
"Maybe if you're good," Draco said.
"Erm, alright. Thanks. Thanks for the tea too," he smiled nervously as he pushed the chair.
"Yes, you came onto my innocent self."
“Mm, truce,” Draco said with a smirk, raising his wand at Harry as he closed the distance between them. Harry quickly shifted into a defensive stance as he grunted his name warningly. Draco cast a rainbow charm at him, laughing at Harry’s flabbergasted expression
Harry refused to rise to the bait, settling instead for a straightforward death glare. Privately, it really was difficult given the distance between the respective tables, but Malfoy's distinctive colouring had always made things easier. Still, it wasn't something that he would tell Ron, especially when it would be used against him one day.
"Yeah! So Hermione gave me a cookbook on Indian cuisine and I'm halfway through that. It's taking me a while because of work, and needing to cook everything I see, you know?" Potter's eyes were shining as he gestured excitedly. "And I'm pretty good at it, honestly. I even bring it to the Weasleys. It sticks out a bit with the English fare, but it's great."
"How plebeian," Malfoy commented as Harry turned the bag around to estimate the cost of it. "Does it have any note?"
"Just kissing my friend softly, as friends do."
“Erm, they were concerned, I guess? That we weren't talking even though we were roommates," he said, slumping when Draco only raised an unimpressed brow at him.
Draco had nursed an affection for Potter, knowing from its conception that it was doomed. As he watched Potter leave, he was suddenly reminded about the awful Muggle film that Potter had rented over the Christmas holidays where floppy haired bookstore man had rejected brunette film star's earnest confession. Why had floppy haired bookstore man not taken the leap of faith and believed that they could overcome everything together? He had been so frustrated then, yelling at the television while hitting Potter's thigh in agony. Yet he was now floppy haired bookstore man, made impotent by his petty concerns, and then his friends would rag him afterwards.
And indeed he didn't. He only hung out with people he fucked, Draco thought crudely, lining the lead arrow in his fingers and flicking it towards Pansy. Blinking when it connected, Pansy's smile became strained as she leaned away from Ron's attention, and startling when Hermione's hand touched her arm.
," he read aloud with a laugh.
Potter was contemplative when he finished, his idle fingers playing with the velvet box.
"You wouldn't notice. Even if it hit your face," Draco insisted as he looked straight at Harry. His eyes moved speculatively across his face. "Maybe you would if it hit you right on your filthy mouth."
He pounced on his
"What does it say?" Harry asked as he rubbed at his lower temple.
Draco shook his head as he watched Harry empty the glass at one go.
"So what is it?" Malfoy leaning in now, using his slight height advantage to intimidate Harry.
6. Plan the date out, from dinner then what next
"I wouldn't have said so if I wasn't serious, Potter."
"Can't help it if it likes me," Harry grinned as he accepted the offered hand, gaping when he entered. "Your parlour is obscene!"
"He did, and it's definitely for some noble cause or whatever," Pansy interrupted the arguments.
Harry shrugged as he sipped his butterbeer. "It started with questions about Muggle Studies, I think. Hermione likes her wit."
"Didn't you listen to Worry?"
"Er, Pansy-" Draco said before returning to look at their hands in disbelief.
"Yeah, Draco would absolutely lap that up," Ron agreed.
“You know, I wouldn’t face a single chance of losing next week if we trained together.”
"Professor, I don't think that we've mastered the Protego charm," Harry breathed deeply at the familiar voice to his right. He closed his eyes to compose himself.
"Shut up,” Draco hissed as he straightened his uniform. “I’ll be hauled to Azkaban for flouting copyright law,” he said, lips curling at the edges even though his eyes were serious.
- - - - -
, honestly?"
"Alright," Malfoy said quietly as he laid down.
The edges of Potter's lips curled from his will to not laugh even as it reached his eyes. "Bloody hell, Malfoy. I might actually appreciate that."
multiple times!! You should know how careless I can be.
The entrance to his new dorm was both a logistical nightmare and a psychological impediment, Draco wrote in his letter to Pansy as he sat at the Slytherin table waiting for Blaise's arrival. He had left the dormitories early in the morning of the first day of classes, and the Great Hall was still sparse.
Harry looked at the pale foot with the red
D510068E
"I'll probably end up in Hufflepuff," Potter said.They settled into a carriage with Longbottom, who looked distinctly uncomfortable with the hypothesis they were exploring.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry scribbled onto a piece of torn parchment, folding it into approximate quarters before sending it across the Great Hall towards Malfoy.
"But what if he doesn't? You know how unpredictable he is," Harry stared blankly into the flames in worry.
"Then we both know the outcome of this date already, don't we?"
"There's always Longbottom, Pansy." Malfoy corrected.
Somehow the swots all managed to find each other, he thought as Goldstein enveloped Draco in a hug.
Harry glared at Draco. "Now you’re just being difficult."
"Why can't it be? Why does it have to-" he trailed off as the upset took over him and he cried harder against Narcissa.
1. End location
"A persisting thirst for knowledge, I see," the Hat suddenly spoke up. "Greatly esoteric, hmm. Teenagers are harder to sort, you see. There's so much flux to work with, so much
for Merlin’s sake, and his supposed compatibility partner was the bastion of goodness, the complete antithesis to his entire existence, and if they ever got together the media would be relentless, shredding him to pieces as they did to Mother, who was now a shut-in.
Harry looked around the Great Hall, grimacing as a clique of Hufflepuff girls dissolved into giggles when he looked their way. "I just don't-"
Unfolding the papers from the box, he translated his distant aunt’s matchmaking reports with a quick spell before skimming through them. He had come to see his inheritance as an honor, but with the passing of the first week of December, the pressure to fulfill his monthly matchmaking quota (beginning with one in his first calendar month) loomed over him heavily.
"Mr Dearborn almost died, Harry!" Teddy interjected loudly. "Draco saved him and now he has a big scar!"
it!" He said, presenting his arse to Malfoy as he made a show of groping himself.
"Anyway, you're only four minutes late. No one cares for an apology."
Harry meeped when Narcissa suddenly pulled his leg onto her lap. Falling onto his back, he bit his lips when she started to massage the bottom of his calf.
"Teddy, would you like to meet Mr Dearborn? Mr Dearborn is an herbologist like Uncle Neville. Mr Dearborn just returned from the Amazon rainforest in Brazil where he discovered a new plant with big teeth! And the plant bit him! Do you want to ask Mr Dearborn to show you the big bite from the scary plant?" Draco bent slightly, hands on his knees as he spoke to his Teddy. "My cousin, Theodore Lupin," he introduced quickly to his patient, smiling to himself when Teddy began to pester the man. Draco returned to the forms in satisfaction.
"Finish it," Malfoy nodded at the last morsel of tart before returning to reorganise his day.
"It says
Harry allowed himself to be pulled away in the wintery cold, happy to be with Draco even just for a while more.
Note:
"Ah, not really. I try to maximise all the time I have with him, you know?" Potter eyes widened at his own words. "Not that you're not doing it, I feel like he's growing up so fast and I'm not around enough," he explained desperately. "I never knew that Quidditch players travelled so much until I became one," he shook his head before finger combing his hair, stopping at the base of his messy bun.
12. Follow up on Saturday
Apparating across the field, he blinked when the wards embraced him. The magic was old, warm and familiar, but the frequency was nothing that he had come across recently. Harry stood still at the porch leading to the house, resisting the urge to push his magic into the core of the property that was calling to him like his own home.
disapproving look and a stern caution to maintain their professionalism at all times.
Draco
Harry finally relented as he trudged along with the tour of Draco's neighbourhood in Chelsea. As the cold wind blew into his face, Harry quickly ran through the list he had made to impress Draco—he only had two more items to go, and he was reluctant for the night to end. He smiled sadly as Draco continued sharing excitedly about the bits of his life and the parts that Harry had had the fortune to glimpse in the few months of their friendship.
- Hogwarts staff member
Potter laughed weakly as they walked in silence. "I wasn't upset that I was bisexual," Potter said before correcting himself. "I'm not upset that I'm bisexual. It was a surprise, but I think that it was the circumstances, you know? Like the rug was pulled from underneath me. And I was lost."
“So that’s how resonance feels like,” Draco said shyly when Harry pulled him onto his lap and held him close.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Harry spoke over him, "No, we can't keep eating the same thing every day; it's not healthy. Happy also has plans to cook other things tomorrow. Maybe we can have pasketti next week?"
Draco pet him on the head in laughter, “Harry meant to say that we did use your presents wisely.”
Teddy looked at him incredulously, his face splitting into a slow smile. “That’s what you said the last time too. You never change, Harry.”
“It’s not flying,” Malfoy said blandly as he turned the pot here and there for inspection.
"Glad I thought ahead," Draco commented shamelessly as he unfolded the straw mat with a flourish. Taking off his shoes, he stepped onto the surface before proceeding to lie on his back with a noisy, contented sigh. "Come here, Potter," Draco called out lazily as he patted the space beside him lightly. "We'll have our desserts, and we can revise Astronomy until the next light show."
"I'll tell your friends to visit, first thing in the morning!" He yelled as Madam Promfrey waved him away.
Pressing the bit between his tongue and the roof of his mouth, Draco savoured the sweet eggy flavor with a sigh. His work as a healer and his corresponding competence gave him a sense of contentment but it was moments like these, with such simple pleasures, that made him miss the happier days before Hogwarts, when he had run about the manor with his mother and the elves catering to his innumerous whimsical demands.
Will wait for Harry’s.
"Do you think that we're going to be re-sorted?" Draco asked Blaise as they gathered with their fellow eighth years, a much smaller cohort than previous years.
Checking that the corridor was clear, Draco pointed his middle finger at the man, pleased at the bluster that he received for his efforts. “Mind your own bloody business,” he added for good measure as he shook his fist warningly.
No job offer would arrive, and couldn’t it be a homemade diner devoid of terms? It could be a date, and Harry would cook while Draco would bring a suitable bottle of wine or make some dessert…
Draco shifted his weight, unsure of Potter's thoughts. It had been so long since he had looked at the calendar properly that it had ceased to register in his mind, hidden behind his clothes. How could he have forgotten to pack the calendar away? Draco was so mortified that he would have begged for an AK just to end his misery.
that Harry had never seen before.
"Can't," he replied, waving grandly at Ron and Hermione when the exited the library. It was nearing curfew, and he had enlisted his friends' help for their authority and safe passage.
. You were looking at
Harry whipped his head back to look at Draco in disbelief. "You're not pulling my leg, are you? Was anyone living in it then? What happened to them?"
"Healer Draco?" Potter repeated as his eyes returned to Draco once more, giving him a slow once over. Draco desperately tried not to react to the sound of his first name in Potter's timbre.
people contracts," Blaise said in horror. "They do
Regardless of how shoddy the ‘manual’ was, the arrows proved that it wasn’t a prank. The power in them was palpable, and it even shone against his purple bed sheets. When he picked it up, his arm broke out in a trail of goosebumps as the magic reverberated throughout his body.
Something in Draco's voice–possibly the smugness–triggered Ron's attention. His hand froze in mid-air as he turned to look at Draco. Setting his spoon down carefully, he narrowed his eyes at Draco, then Harry. "Does he know?” He hissed at Harry.
The both of them startled when a server stopped at their table. When they had placed their orders, Potter enquired about the wine selection, ordering two glasses of light wine to go with their mains.
"A teeny WEEP."
Seemingly taken aback by the speed of his agreement, Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him. “You’re not going to be able to change my mind about the campaign direction. I have my professional standards to uphold,” he said loftily, his nose in the air as he pressed the lid of his laptop shut.
Draco listened as his mother told Aunt Andromeda about the nudist group she had met while shopping in Rue St Catherine.
"It's good," Potter said as he pushed his box over, motioning for Draco to try some. Draco looked at the offering, idly noting that Potter had only helped himself to a tiny corner of the cake. Setting his near Potter, Draco bit his lip as he reached for the cake. It was simply calling out his name too loudly for him to resist. He was only mortal after all.
Draco’s desperation bled through as his brows raised in surprise. He went along with it and turned it into excitement. "Tonight? You're turning optimistic, Pansy."
"Let's go," Harry said, laughing when Malfoy jumped in fright at his voice.
Draco pressed his knuckles along his jaw, feeling the bone underneath. After reading a Muggle article on forensic facial reconstruction a few days ago, he had found his thoughts straying to the topic whenever his mind was idle. If he were handed great grandfather Septimus Malfoy's skull, would he be able to identify that he was at least a Malfoy? Draco was simultaneously unsettled yet coolly ambivalent about the inability to do so. Personally, he would be interested in a challenge of such morbid proportions, but alas, his ancestry had the unfortunate effect of making him a bit sick as of late. Regardless, if there was one thing Draco was sure of, it would be his ability to identify Justin Finch-Fletchley from his skull if someone did the world a favour by ridding it of him. After all, Draco had spent more than an hour scrutinising the miserable sod.
Most importantly, the distraction was desperately welcome, Draco thought as he sent a fierce wave of sleet towards Harry’s face, taking advantage of Harry’s poor memory to torture him. The urge to make Harry happy, and to touch him was getting worse, and it would have faded already, if not for their compatibility. More often than not, Draco found himself daydreaming about Harry when they were together, and distractions like being pelted by revenge hail the size of golf balls helped him to focus. He circled his wand desperately to dismiss the inclement weather, thankful when it finally worked.

Draco idly thought that their confrontation could have been better conducted in a warmer environment. "

Harry tried his best to muster enough amusement. His stomach started to churn again. Everything was an absolute disaster.
factor to the pastime. "There's only so much gardening and shopping a person can do before they become batty," Narcissa confided.
"Am I going to get my present now?" Draco asked after a while, narrowing his eyes as he watched Harry finish his dinner.
Draco wiped his tears discretely as Teddy tried his best to loop the tinsel around the tree. Harry reached over to squeeze his left hand and held it in his.
–with his grudging nods and lack of insults. Malfoy had even pointed him to the right knife, even offering a gruff explanation for its use.
Minerva McGonagall
Harry grinned as Malfoy complied sulkily, still pouting about being forced to put on the ugly jumper Harry had gifted him.
Draco's brows knotted at his hesitation, lips slightly pursed as he pulled his hand back. Harry leapt across the table to grab his hand and swallow the morsel in a smooth motion.
"I agree. Nothing too graphic though," Neville warned. Hermione supported the judgement.
“Of course. What else would it be?” Harry replied questioningly, brows raising when he noticed the falter in Malfoy’s steps. He knew that past-Harry and Malfoy were supposedly friends, but Malfoy had been treating him so poorly since his incident that they were now merely colleagues in his book. Still, being colleagues was already a huge step up from their original dynamic as schoolboy rivals. Besides, anything more required cooperation on Malfoy’s part. “Look, Malfoy—”
I appreciate the invitation, but I would like to counter propose a full day of shopping. A whole wardrobe cannot be purchased in a few hours. I am available on Friday if that is amenable. I would prefer to avoid the shopping crowds.
Teddy nodded quickly as he perked right up in a little jump. "We can have a lot a lot and many many pasketti," he said as he waved his hands wildly. "Can we have pasketti for Christmas too?"

in Hogwarts. You'll need a troll attack or something," Hermione said as she took a casual sip of her pumpkin juice.
Draco frowned at the patient who wisely rolled his sleeve back down. "Teddy, isn't that too big for you?" He asked as waved the forms off to their respective departments, shaking his head at the mark that Teddy had replicated on his arm. Andromeda would eviscerate him if it stayed. "How about something smaller like Harry's?" He suggested as he brushed Teddy's fringe back to rub at where Potter's infamous scar sat.
"You just have poor taste, Potter," Malfoy replied, wrinkling his nose at Harry's drink.
Malfoy was Malfoy and he was Potter. Just because the eighth years had become closer didn't mean that his and Malfoy's relationship had to change. He opened his mouth to disagree, only to be cut off by a speculative Malfoy.
"Think that mine's pretty big, Malfoy."
“Is it?” Harry said as he pretended to check his wePhone. “I saw your email and rushed here immediately.”
“No” Harry said apologetically as he set the box onto Malfoy’s table gingerly. “I like your office. The décor isn’t quite what I expected from you though,” he gestured at the entire office of Malfoy’s company. “And the location.”
"No. Can't you just-" Harry complained as he grabbed his elbow. "You can't apologise and immediately expect people to respond. You need to give people time, and then some because it's
"That makes you a
"Maybe only the afternoon ones."
Malfoy only blinked at him, still shocked by the ordeal. Harry was overcome by helplessness. He reached over to squeeze Malfoy's shoulder.
Draco shoved at him for the jibe. "I had to confirm my suspicions! You were so good at acting, I had to test you just to be sure. I mean,
Malfoy shrugged as they hopped onto the moving staircase. "How bad is bad?"
"Harry?" Draco called out as he tread towards his walk-in wardrobe carefully, wand in hand. He made a curious noise at the sight of Potter surrounded by what seemed to be the contents of an entire wardrobe, levitated.
- Based on accent where I speak first
"Yeah," Draco replied, disappointed by the doubt in his voice. "Yeah," he tried again as he nodded earnestly, flushing when Harry grinned brightly at him.
Draco smiled weakly. "Don't think that I could send them off to Hogwarts, honestly."
Draco was laughing, weaving through the throng of people when there was a sudden commotion.
"It's funny how she showed it," Harry said as he thought about the cruel comments Parkinson had made about Hermione previously.
"Draco's delicious drink," Malfoy replied as he raised his glass for a toast.
"No, no, no," Harry was red in the face as he quickly crumpled it, weaving around Malfoy's hands.
"There's more students. Harry has a list," Ron said as they set the attackers down gently.
"What letters?" Draco asked, placing a hand on Harry's thigh to stop him from squirming.
"Well, am I wrong?" Ron looked at him heavily. Harry's brows creased in frustration. He was sick of the censorship Hermione had imposed on Ron. Girlfriends were a pain, and he was thankful that he was gay.
Knowing his luck, he would probably be a worder or end up with something equally nondescript that would make it impossible to identify his soulmate.
Harry rolled his eyes. "That's original," he said drily as he waved for Malfoy to start packing up. He had given up pacing about in his room and decided to walk Malfoy back. Ron had told him to expect nothing out of his attempts of friendship, but it was so hard to remember sometimes. It was just as well that Malfoy reminded him how insensitive he could be.
"Morning," Ron said brightly as he sailed into the office, gasping when he laid eyes on Draco. "Mate, you look like shit. Wild night?"
- Murderer killing Hogwarts students
"Don't think about it too much. And drink up before you sleep!" Ron called out when Harry lumbered off huffily. Everybody was brushing him off today and it was frustrating, if not hurtful.
Suddenly registering Harry’s hardness against him, Draco felt distinctly light-headed. He wanted to push Harry to his knees, he wanted Harry to kiss him, he wanted to touch Harry's cock. “Please,” he begged, his voice broken as he rutted against Harry.
Draco was seated before the coffee table, reading a stack of Potions essays when he burst in.
" she soothed when Harry suddenly started to cry. Holding Harry in a tight embrace, one hand smoothed his hair while the other ran up and down his back gently.
- less travelling for long periods of time
"I'm going to leave now," Harry said, pressing his nails into his palms in helplessness and frustration when Madam Promfrey tutted at his presence.
"I know!" Everybody jumped when Ginny slapped the table. "You both should fake-date. Do a whole PR stunt. You—" she pointed at Draco— "will fend off the crazies, while you will learn how to assert yourself."
"Oh," Harry said disappointedly as he took in the wide red bricked three storey building with a small dome in the middle of the roof.
“The duel was more helpful than the time spent reading,” Harry said distractedly, his hand moving as if practicing the spells.
"Does it have a note?"
I promise to accommodate your busy schedule if you are available.
"I don't know,” Ron shrugged as he brows furrowed in concentration. “Maybe they're a murderer targeting Hogwarts students. That’s red mark worthy alright.".
“You better hide, Potter!”
7. Do not be alone with them and if you have to, make sure that the doors are open
"I'll be going. Ginny's calling for me," she said, her voice bright. Draco swallowed at the look he received before she skipped away.
"Are you all returning to Hogwarts?" Greg suddenly asked, as Weasley began ushering them to continue walking. The geniality of the entire interaction was not lost on Draco. It was absolutely bizarre.
“There's no need for that.” Harry grinned, pushing the cushion flat on Draco’s lap to lay his head on it.
when—"
Draco turned to his side as he considered the information that he had gained from properly communicating with Harry. He had previously been so paranoid and biased that he had been blind to the truth that must have been obvious to the Unspeakables. No wonder he had been so thoroughly rejected—Merlin, he slapped his forehead in agony when he finally connected the dots.
Potter watched the stern exchange in confusion.
"Get lost!" She snapped at Malfoy when he only gaped at her. Harry scrambled to make space for a sulky and tousled Malfoy.
"I'm not wanking," he flipped his comforter open violently, revealing his clothed crotch when he noticed Malfoy narrowing his eyes at him in suspicion.
1. fix The Quiet's ward
“It’s supposed to work the other way, Harry. You’re the client. I’m the contractor—” he broke off into an appreciative moan around the forkful of dark chocolate lavender tart. Sighing to himself, Malfoy frowned when he couldn’t get another portion to balance on his fork.
He scooted inwards as he gestured for Harry to sit. Pulling a pale pink ribbon from the bundle Harry had set down, he frowned at the instructions. "Goodness, they're anti-loosening. That's nice," he slid the ribbon into his mouth as he gathered his hair in a ponytail. He wrapped the ribbon around with one hand when it was done.
“No, it’s not. It’ll be a lot more stable and impartial. Beautification spells are targeted and isolated, and the effect depends on the caster’s perception of their features. Whereas your Potion acts on the beholder and makes the drinker more beautiful in their eyes. It’s a lot more reliable.”
"Go away, Potter," Malfoy intoned as he checked the heavy book out.
Potter's eyes lit up as he leaned in with a predatory grin. Draco's heart went wild at the close proximity of their lips. He stepped backwards in sheer cowardice.
"How is it fair that you guys are working together for
? That's awfully indecent," he complained as he opened his book again. "Bloody Pansy," he groused as he wrote
"Found it on the table. You're not using it so it's mine," Draco shrugged as he made a short note on the parchment. Harry had been converted by Draco to use biros instead of a quill, and his handwriting now looked better than Draco's slanted scrawl. The downside to the convenience and improvement in penmanship was that his pens were always disappearing.
kick out of insulting me so I'm giving you the last chance to get it all out before Hogwarts opens. Do return if you have a few hours one day to go shopping for work clothes with me.
Harry couldn’t breathe, his body was buzzing, and his mind was a complete mush. He circled his hands around Draco's waist as he pulled him closer, won't to even be an inch apart. The world fell away as their mouths continued to move against each other.
drop Potions reading," Malfoy stated even while moving the item to the next day. He returned the book to his bag.
Ron shrugged, "Malfoy hardly comes for lunch anyway so please stop embarrassing yourself. Everyone's staring," he said around his mouthful.
Harry sighed with faux helplessness, "I thought that I was going to be the violent one on this date, but it seems like you're stealing my only role."
Harry scoffed at him, “that’s absolutely rubbish. I’ll have thirty small cakes to go, any flavour is fine. Pack six of them separately, no repeats for those.”
Harry nodded distractedly as he read the crumpled note.
"Never. I trust my intuition."
A variety of sarcastic comments ran through Draco's mind at Harry's assurance. He blinked when he noticed Harry looking at him for confirmation.
Draco had already mentally prepared the strongly worded letter he would be sending Daphne immediately after the blind date, assuming it ever ended. It had to be mentioned that while Draco was self-absorbed (yes, he was actually aware of his flaws), Finch-Fletchley's own narcissism was many folds worse. The man had not ceased his yammering about yields, bonds and maturity since Draco had politely enquired about his work at the start of the date, and Draco would have pitied him for his lower-middle class obsession with money had he been less annoying.
“So have you gotten all of your Christmas presents?” he asked.
"Potter's pitiful palette," Harry joked, smacking his lips noisily to annoy Malfoy when he took another sip of his drink. Malfoy was really one to talk, pretentiously drinking his elf-made whiskey neat as if it didn't strip the lining of his throat.
"Yes! Draco ate many many dough," Teddy giggled as he waved his hands for emphasis.
Harry had spent most of his post-war efforts trying to bridge the understanding between the Muggleborn, Half-blood and Pureblood communities and he had returned to Hogwarts hoping that most importantly, his schoolmates would understand that the Slytherins were products of their upbringing. They had all been children, frightened for their lives. At the very end, the law had also judged Malfoy and deemed him capable of rehabilitation. Most importantly, Malfoy had changed. Who were they to mete out their supposed justice?
"I'm witty too," Draco said reflexively. Yet Hermione wasn't as friendly toward him, was she?
"Well, it's the principle of the matter," Malfoy said snottily as he crossed his arms. "Your Muggle wear is
"Does Andromeda report my comings and goings to you?" Draco challenged with an eye roll. "Did she tell you why I'm in Paris?"
Draco had visited Daphne post haste to explain his situation and express his desire to participate in her blind date service. Daphne had smirked at him before proceeding to fill out an application form on his behalf. After reviewing it with no complaints, he had signed it off, paid the required membership fee and left, relieved and buoyant.
"Well, this is me," Draco said, releasing Harry's hand as he pointed at the townhouse behind them after they had visited a few more streets.
13 April 1951
Harry considered the advice before nodding. "I'll knock you off your feet."
"Oh, erm, if you don't mind," Harry said nervously as he sat at the polished dining table before a hearth. He idly wondered if the wards’ familiarity was in recognition of their intertwined bloodline, his ownership of Grimmauld Place, or the life debt that he owed Mrs. Malfoy. He was content for it to be a mix of all three. Despite the uniqueness of the situation, his occupation hazard didn't extend far enough for a thorough investigation. Besides, after sustaining another injury in Morocco from his partner's misjudgement, he was tired. The constant travelling was also wearing him out, and he needed to figure out his life. He took a sip of tea before humming in surprise at its preparation.
"No, you can't. You're an expert. Experts can't be so—" He stopped when Harry managed to close his hand into a fist. "Oh, you're nothing. You don't exist anymore," he said gravely.
"No," Malfoy replied primly, tucking his fringe behind his ear as he settled back down to continue with his book.
“Took him long enough,” Greg replied as he gave a lady her change.
Draco yelped at the attack. “I’m an invalid!”
Draco refilled the glass with water and pushed it towards Harry.
. It doesn't always have to be magically binding. Though, now that you've put the thought in my head..." he trailed off.
“Ron, do you hear how your fellow Gryffindors are purchasing Zonko’s merchandise?” Draco asked Ron in a fit of ingenuity to draw his attention away from Pansy and how she was flaunting their secret relationship in front of his girlfriend.
"Well, it's just the aura." Harry turned back to him consolingly. "You look fine," he assured as he waved his wand at Draco's head. Draco shivered at the tingle of Harry's magic that shot down his spine.
Draco shrugged. "It's helpful, I guess. I suppose that you don't?" He took a sip of the water when it arrived, desperate for a distraction.
Draco shook his head as he rolled his eyes.
Draco frowned at the strange tension from his patient. While Draco had to offload some of his patients to his colleagues due to the complexity of the case, he had always found the man's effusive gratitude to be excessive. Draco cast a quick look at Potter who looked strangely unhinged. It was a look which Draco was unfortunately familiar with.
Their friendship had begun when the Gryffindors disappeared in favour of their romantic pursuits, leaving Harry with few friends especially with the rest of their cohort enamoured by his status. For some reason, Draco had been selected as choice company and after an honest confrontation about their youthful prejudice of each other, they had slowly shifted from opposite chairs and sparse conversations to casual physical contact and good-natured ribbing. It was exactly what he had fantasized when he was younger—to be in with Harry’s jokes, instead of being the butt of them.
Harry complained under his breath as he shifted in his stool. "It'll still count even if there's a tie for the highest score."
"You'd likewise be late if you took Muggle transport, Greg," Pansy returned as she squeezed the side of Draco's waist, an arm around his back.
, I can spare a full Friday. I wouldn't have offered if I couldn't.
Their hypothesis had been proven correct, and Draco had the urge to throw up as it neared his turn. Girl Weasley and Longbottom had been sorted back to Gryffindor, together with Susan Bones, who had previously been a Hufflepuff.
Draco blinked at his lover in exasperation, holding the hand around him in place as he apparated them back to his bedroom. "You're so—" Draco bit out as he devoured his lover's mouth hungrily, pushing him onto the bed as he pressed fervent kisses down Harry's body, "fucking—" he bit the tender flesh in Harry's inner thighs lightly, ignoring the bobbing shaft beside his face. He smirked when his lover kicked him lightly as he motioned for him to get along with it
It was Draco’s quick wit that saved the library book from Harry’s thunderstorm. Draco tossed Harry a glare, rolling his eyes when the other cut off the spell with a wordless wave of his hand, a casual, unintentional show of his powers.
"I thought that we weren't stereotyping people on limited knowledge of their characters and personalities anymore," Weasley spoke up suddenly. Granger flushed in pleasure as she looked at her boyfriend with a mix of fondness and pride.
Malfoy contrite dissolved when Harry only continued to stare at him. "Let's just go," he swung his bag across his shoulder.
"You can come out now, Potter," Draco said idly as he crossed his arms, waiting for the appearance of a sheepish Potter. "I believe that you owe me your gratitude," he commented with an eye roll as Potter emerged, his hair messier than usual.
," Malfoy said in awe as he pulled the publication out of the wrapper. He fell onto Harry's bed almost distractedly, eyes following the trail of water running down the cover model's sculpted chest. The black haired model ran his tongue over his bottom lip as he brushed his left nipple. Malfoy's hand was trembling as he flipped it open. "Oh," he said breathlessly at the picture of two men kissing hungrily on a bed.
"Hold up, you absolute tosser," Malfoy complained as he checked the gift for curses.
"Yeah, and the talking about stuff with you. I never thought that we could be friends, but look at us now," Potter gestured.
Harry gaped at Malfoy in shock. Had Malfoy apologised for his stupid self?
Draco leaned away. "What are you doing?" he demanded in shock, yelping when Pansy smacked her lips noisily against his cheek.
“I wasn’t slacking, I was—” he began to defend himself, breaking off with an eye roll when he realised that Malfoy was only pulling his leg.
Fucking Potter, Draco thought, as he made his way across the Muggle's living room blandly. Fuck Hermione too, he added for good measure as he pulled the main door close behind him with a world weary sigh. Draco spelled the laces of his boots up as he thought about the next strongly worded letter he would send her. It would probably make her day, and given her packed schedule, Merlin knew she needed a good pick-me-up. Draco quickly concealed his wand when he heard the fiddling of the neighbouring unit's lock.
Harry flushed as he looked at Malfoy's friends surreptitiously in embarrassment. "Well, I mean-" he tried to explain. "You don't have to open them with me, I don't mind just seeing them afterwards," he hissed desperately when Zabini, Nott and Goyle started to snicker.
"Your hair's a mess," Malfoy said when he finally unwrapped the present, rougher and clumsier than usual.
Potter seemed to sag even further at Draco's harsh words.
"Yeah, it's the same for me." Potter shrugged, slightly apologetic. "I mean with my parents, you know. And then my aunt being, well, yeah. I just go for whatever sounds fun to me, too."
Draco pressed his palm to his temple as he breathed in deeply in disappointment. He was so sure that it would work this time. The Lady's Mantle had set off a stronger reaction with the pink pearl dust. His jaw worked as he tried to move past his failure.
to anyone. "I have no idea what to see or do. Erm, here. Or anywhere," he said, honesty spilling from his lips. It had been so long since anyone seemed to have time for him, or looked at him properly. All of his friends were coupled up with their soulmates, too busy and content with their lives to care about him. It also didn't help that he had travelled so much to find his words, inevitably distancing himself from the people that he loved.

this time.
Draco's cheeks flushed in obvious pleasure, his eyes bright from the reminder as the sharp line of his shoulders loosened. It was a title he was incredibly proud of, having won it since his first year. "Don't blah blah blah me," he said, just to be contrary.
Draco felt his heart react involuntarily to Harry's teasing. He made a show of rolling his eyes to conceal his amused pleasure. "You're cute," he said coolly before walking out of the toilet.
, thank you very much. I would like to apologise again for hurting your feelings. You did look
Sure, he had heard about Potter from Hermione, his cousin and his aunt, but he had never once talked to Potter properly nor sat across him for meals. The world had spun off its axis since the announcement of the charity calendars.
Harry opened his eyes just a fraction to watch his bickering friends before sneaking the fruit under the table, and into his bag.
"Oh," Draco said, frowning as he dropped the white petals into the potion.
“Harry,” Draco said as he reached for Harry’s arm.
"Of course. We've been together since we signed the contract. We bloody have the same law firm and public relations agency. We even gift Christmas presents together. Even Ron and Hermione don't do that."
"I did! I reminded him! I said maybe we could have some of your cookies after pasketti."

Harry turned over as Draco pulled the comforter out from underneath him. As his spectacles was removed, he vaguely registered that he was being tucked in.
“I’ll be too busy rejecting job offers at that time,” Draco said imperiously, clenching his fist around the arrow and looking away when he noticed the tightness of Harry’s smile. He hated being pitied, but it was better than contempt or derision—oh how far he had fallen indeed. Clenching his fists involuntarily, he froze when he felt the rubber tip come off in his hand. Carelessly trying to maneuver it back, he scratched his middle finger against its tip and his eyes immediately shot to meet Harry’s. His stomach tightened and his skin started to itch from the force of holding himself back.
"You're the deviant one! Wanting to have thoughts about my cock while having dinner with Ron and Hermione."
Draco flicked the tanned hand off his parchment. "You're wrong, Potter. Even a wee baby could do with more adorable outfits and interactive books."
Harry felt his hand seize when Malfoy’s fingers brushed against his as he slid his hand off. Looking at Malfoy’s back as he walked towards the door, Harry was overcome with the feeling that he had lost something. But what was there to hold on to?
They leaned against one another as they caught their breaths.
Most importantly, the possibilities of Muggle London were infinite to Draco – where he had received dark looks and poor service in the Wizarding quarter, Muggle London was always receptive to him. In his spare time, Draco had wandered about with a tourist map, hopping on buses and battling the crowds with a Muggle camera in hand.
For the first time, the answer didn't come easily to Draco. Unlike his usual modus operandi, he didn't want to roll off Harry, pick up his clothes, and return to an empty bed. But staying over was a commitment, and he didn't want to be the one who requested. At the same time, he didn't want to be the one left behind, much less by Harry. He pretended to consider as he fiddled with his bottles of cologne.
"How is it not?" Pansy laughed tonelessly, her lips twisted in a cruel smile. "You just need to do whatever the fuck you want."
“What is this?” Harry asked as he reached for the bottle of dried loose leaf chamomile flowers. “I think that they’re dead,” he said stupidly as he narrowed his eyes at it.
"Draco, they're together," Harry said, his smile fond when Draco's mouth fell open in shock.
Draco tried his best to control the pleasure he felt. "Catch me again when you're joking about your own mistakes," he said as he shifted his weight on his foot. "But it must be mentioned that I am an Archer. A
(Malfoy's words) to withstand Malfoy's interrogation or cold shoulder when he wanted to know something.
“You need more practice or I’ll wipe the floor off you on Tuesday.”
Harry tried his best to not react. He knew that he had signed off–it was only polite to do so–and Draco was being bizarre as usual. “That’s not very polite. Did they sign off in your other notes?”
"Well–" Harry began heatedly.
“Do you have time for a seat? This is too much,” Harry said earnestly as he pulled a chair up to their table.
"Piss off, Malfoy," Harry retorted as he sent the wrapper to his desk for evidence.
"It's red," he exclaimed.
"Potter," Draco called out before tossing a box in his direction. He was tired of watching Potter mope. His fan club had also taken notice of The Saviour's gloom, and had began organising once more. It was time for an intervention.
Everyone gaped at Malfoy for the specific comparison. He didn't seem to notice though, occupied at picking lint off his pants. "Any other woes from the
"I don't know. I've been waiting for you," Harry said as he reached to pull the present at the corner of his bed over.
"Draco's hair is a bit darker," Harry piped in, lifting a crayon and holding it before Draco's face. "Not too dark though, sort of silver and spun—" he broke off to an inaudible mumble with a slight frown. After a pulse of magic, the green crayon immediately transformed to the exact shade of Draco's pale hair. Draco pressed his thighs together as he felt his bottom clench, refusing to outwardly react to the nonchalant wandless and wordless. Trust Potter to casually display his prowess so.

"I'm nothing but sensible." Harry grinned at him. "Continue choosing between your citrus woody scent and your citrus woody scent. I'll pick your clothes."
"And dying the third time when she was being bullied at the playgrounds, yes," Harry interrupted. "It's unbecoming, blah blah blah, what is she thinking, blah blah blah, says the reigning Professor Charming for the
Draco nodded. “Of course. I’m a genius,” he said, trying his best to laugh at how shameless he was being. Hermione was more than smart, and the both of them knew it.
. We're just a bit left out with everyone coupling up. And he's quite tactile, so it seems like something more. But we're only just friends."
"Secondhand books, or copying from my family's collection,” Draco replied as he helped himself to the leg of ham.
"Can you help me to get my handkerchief," Draco asked as he started to tear up again. Quickly summoning one from upstairs, he dabbed at Draco's tears. Draco waved him away, staring at the ceiling wiping his eyes intermittently as he sniffled softly.
Harry climbed off his high stool and walked over to peer at it. "It looks darker than usual."
"Close enough to hit," Harry replied, freezing at his reflexive vindictiveness. "I didn't-"
the Hippogriff
“Then I saw the ink stain on one of your wrappers, and it all fell in place. Who cares enough about Harry, benefitted from his gift, thinks that mundane everyday gifts are appropriate, has a terrible sense of humour and is messy?” He wiggled the fingers that he had counted off, raising his brows airily as if welcoming challenge.
“I don’t like to disappoint people,” Harry said quietly.
"Jesus, Malfoy. Don't joke about that. I still dream about it sometimes, you know? That you die on me and all. It shakes me up."
He shivered when Draco pressed a hand directly to his back; reacting not only to the cool fingers, but also the pleasure that shot up his spine.
"Yes! You're not supposed to sit here!"
He decided to test the efficacy of the arrow. "Did you spend your Hogsmeade outing with the both of them? Are you going to do it again?"
Harry looked at Ron, acknowledging the dark smirk on his friend's face with a grim smile. It had been a while since he had let himself be consumed by this nervous energy. He led the way, scanning the map quickly, his heart racing in perverse excitement to see Walters and his gang still waiting along the corridor.
"Makes you think about having more, doesn't it?"
Mrs. Malfoy only waved him off with an amused smile. "It's alright. He really deserved it sometimes, that boy. I'm also more than aware that the hitting went both ways."
"She's a bit worried."
"Not quite. I'm more of a show-er boy." He burst into laughter when Draco shoved him into the display window of a shop.
“Maybe you could try them on our friends this weekend,” Draco suggested, subtly inviting Harry to the Hogsmeade trip, no matter that it was pretty much given that he would join them since Pansy had invited Hermione, who would invite Ron—he had to fulfill the
Harry picked at his plate as silence stretched between them. Where should he begin?
Harry only shrugged. "Doesn't mean I can't appreciate a fine arse when I see one."
"You're a lousy boyfriend," Draco complained as he pushed him away by the face.
Despite the dire situation, Draco found himself reluctantly impressed by Harry's retention of knowledge from Herbology. Henrietta Whorst had the penchant for stealing from her place of employment to convey her disgust towards his grooming and choice of clothes. Draco had distilled her
"Bloody hell," Draco swore, drawing a line across the parchment as he startled. "For Merlin's sake, Potter!" He snapped as he vanished the track of ink. "Don’t sneak up on people! Also, dry your hair," he griped unhappily, pointing his wand in Potter's direction, leaving his hair fluffy instantaneously.
After breakfast, the Headmistress had dispatched the class schedules, and in a fit of insanity – named Hermione and him Head Girl and Head Boy.
Greg looked disbelievingly at him, cakes suspended in mid-air. “You’ve been obsessed with Draco your whole life?”
It had taken him long enough, but the answer was finally clear. There was a job acceptance letter that he needed to pen.
As they returned to the Hogwarts castle, Draco felt ready for the future before them.
"Yes, it does. We are harassed daily, and every other day there's a letter with malicious intent." That's polite language for delayed suffocation spells and lethal contact poisons.
"Alright."
"Finally," Harry said, his voice thick with relief as he hopped off Malfoy's desk. "We could have done this an hour ago but you had to be an arse about it."
He had set aside concerns about his image, writing about coming of age duties and the stress, before requesting for wisdom and a pillar of support. Seven out of fifteen of them had gone unanswered, six had returned with unrelated advice, of which five of those had invited his family to visit during Lunar New Year. The last two letters had been carefully probing and equally vague, and Draco had been so happy for a whole week, that Pansy had refused to sit with him.
"You're still supposed to pay though. Even though the reservation is under my name," he suddenly said seriously.
- no capitalisation on the Harry Potter fame
The dares progressively got raunchier as everyone started to get more intoxicated. Malfoy screeched, falling into laughter in his lap when Parkinson was dared to fondle Hermione's breasts.
"Ow fuck, Potter. Your arm," Draco groaned as he rubbed the back of his head in exaggerated pain to mask his confusion and mortification over the split second mishap, while Potter peered at him from above in shock and guilt. The concerned hand on his shoulder made him shudder involuntarily.
"Stop yourself, Potter."
"Thank you very much for the peace," Hermione said as she returned to her textbook.
Everything started to fall into place. Draco's initial weight loss, his cravings, his appetite, his stomach cramps, and him crossing his own boundaries to request foot massages. He had heard that male pregnancies were complicated and more physically demanding. Maybe that was why Draco had agreed to the courting relationships with him—to increase contact with Harry's magic so that his pregnancy would be safer. Harry burrowed his face in his hands.
"Oh," Draco looked away in embarrassment even though his careful delight was obvious. It was moments like this that endeared Draco to Harry deeply—Draco tried his best to come across uncaring and abrasive, but he was actually thoughtful, eager to please and terribly awkward.
"Blimey! What will she make us do?" Ron sat up in worry, jostling the cramped seating.
5. Encourage peer coaching
"Just spit it out, Potter. Is it about my father? Or are you the only person allowed to be gay?"

"It's not—" Draco began, his throat tight. "I can't do that anymore."
Draco moaned softly in surprise and surrender, his breath shaky when Harry suddenly leaned in to press a kiss at the curve of his neck and shoulder. He clutched weakly onto the checked wool coat he had bought for Harry last winter.
suit me then."
Draco only hummed in response, used to Harry’s unsubtle pleas. It had been months but of unsuccessful begging, but a Gryffindor’s stubbornness was incomprehensible. “I’m busy,” he replied, grateful when Harry didn’t push.
Draco gasped. "Potter, have you not noticed the way you look at boys? We used to bet about when you would jump into bed with Diggory and Chang!" He exclaimed as he rubbed his temples in horror. Were Gryffindors all so hopeless? The mental image of Weasley doing things to Hermione in the third floor alcove surfaced. Draco winced to himself. "Potter, by Merlin's staff, you've always been looking at the male models on Blaise's menswear magazines!"
Potter merely pulled a long face, but Granger quickly agreed, "yeah, it's a bit much. Harry has the brunt of it though.” She looked at her friend in concern.
"Yeah. It did," Harry said as he sipped his tea carefully. It was strange to have his and Malfoy’s childhood antics validated by Mrs. Malfoy, no less, and it was hard to control the urge to complain about every slight her son had committed against his being.
"I'm glad that you only had
"Maybe they're on holiday," Harry said as Teddy's giggles became louder.
"Same," Harry replied. His eyes were bright as they grinned at each other.
"Did you get somebody good?" Harry asked when Malfoy finally returned from his nightly routine. Harry bit the insides of his cheek when he noticed the sudden stillness in the line of Malfoy's shoulders.
Draco pulled Harry closer when he noticed his eyes started to turn glassy with tears. "How would you know? Nobody else's significant other has received as much attention. You inspire a whole new crazy."
Attached is a Portkey to Hogwarts' gates for 2 August, 10am GMT.
"I'm sorry for being late!" Harry apologised brightly as he unshrunk the Prophet that he had purchased in the morning. "Is that my pen that you're sucking," he exclaimed.
"So you're probably going to get your second present today," Malfoy said suddenly as they made their way through the largely empty corridors.
Confused but cautiously grateful
It earned him a fond hum in agreement.
"Yes you are! Stop! Stop touching it!" Malfoy exclaimed. "
Harry dropped his bag onto the desk carelessly as he sunk into the chair beside Malfoy.
"Pans, we're just a little confused, and we'd like to talk. Can we go somewhere more private?" Hermione said as she pulled her boyfriend away from Pansy.
"Don't you already know, Potter?"
Harry could only pout in response, resigned the prospect of being reminded of having worded Draco for the rest of his life. “So where’s your mark,” he asked once more in a barefaced attempt to change the topic.
"As the Headmistress has said during the Halloween feast, Hogwarts students are expected to respect each others' right to privacy and dignity. I don't think Potter would appreciate it if he knew that you both were looking for him regardless of your good intentions," Draco said in a swotty voice that came easily to him.
Draco's body was alight with sensations. He had never been touched this way—the sex he had had was always fast, dirty, or shameful. He had never been reduced to a trembling, desperate mess.
"You're so beautiful," Potter suddenly whispered after a while. "You make me so happy."
Harry considered the suggestion. "That's a bit too complex and
"Maybe one day you can save me from my bad fashion," Potter said as they continued walking.
"Alright, thanks for attending and complying with the dress code. Look forward to the next eighth year party!" Seamus interrupted as he clapped his hands loudly.
"And we're here for Ron." Potter gestured his chin at the couple kissing opposite them.
Anyway, thank you for taking time out to shop with me because I'm actually looking forward to the tailored clothes. I don't think that I would have ever visited a proper shop on my own. I also really love the other stuff we got.
"Oh, love," Harry sighed as he rushed over to hover over Draco. Draco pulled him close as he pressed his face into Harry's jumper.
Harry shook his head while helping himself to the grilled chicken. “Probably later,” he said–more like long
discount, and it tells me to use it wisely.” Harry swore to kiss his gift partner tomorrow. They had unwittingly saved him from crying all over Draco.
,” Malfoy said to him with a wry smile.
"Harry! You do not thank people for groping your bottom!" Hermione exclaimed, scandalised.
McGonagall
Harry wondered if he could give himself a consolatory wank afterwards. Even though he wasn’t in the mood to pull one off, it would probably make him feel better and stop him from wetting his pillow with tears instead.
As if noting his distress, Potter's eyes slid across the length of his body before meeting his, the eye contact steady. A slow, predatory smile spread across Potter's lips as he raised his brows in challenge.
Harry blinked at the suddenness, and the unexpected success of his teasing.
Draco shrugged. "I'm always ready, Potter."
The hall quieted when the Headmistress took her position at the podium. She straightened her notes before beginning in a stately manner, “Hogwarts, has always prided itself on its diversity, embracing and nurturing the best in its students. However, in the midst of competition, we have forgotten what we are capable of when we come together–a school, generations of inquisitive students, a better future for our friends and families.”
Greg made a face as he finally looked at Harry properly. “I don’t think that that’s a good idea. He’s been very busy.”
"I'm not–" he sputtered, immediately crossing his legs when Malfoy's eyes wandered again. "Mione!" He begged when Malfoy continued to smile lasciviously at him.

He reached into his sweatshirt pocket to marvel at the special pass under the dim light. Casting a magic revealing spell that Bill had taught them, he huffed at its complexity. He could identify some parts of it though, for example that was a magic signature, that was a basic ownership charm, the orange was a–he jumped when it started to whistle lowly, like a Muggle kettle on the stove. The noise quickly increased,
Slipping the box back into his pocket, Draco picked a book tangentially relevant to their research before returning to Hermione. He paused at the sight of Pansy perched on their table.
Harry stared at the mark in disbelief. While the revealing and position of marks always varied depending on the nature of the couple, almost all marks were black. Red soulmarks were a marker of a couple's intensity, and he had only read about them in works of fiction.
"The glamour you have at your lower temple?" Draco asked in confusion as he tried to pull his hand away.
Harry himself was cautiously excited for the party. The Weasleys had been weighed down by the sadness from the loss of their son and brother, and he had been surprised that they would be celebrating his birthday at all. It would be nice for the attention he would finally get—Hermione and Ron were celebrating their soulmates status, and he had felt terribly lonely.
"I–" Potter attempted to defend himself. "You're making an assumption! I could have been looking at the clothes too!"
He held Draco close. “Then I will insist,” he said softly as he pressed a kiss on Draco’s fine hair.
“I have their advent calendar,” he said proudly.
Draco rolled his eyes as he waved his work robes to the clothes hamper in the corner. "Of course, I do. Does she want it, though?" He turned to tease Harry, heart jumping at the intensity of Harry's eyes that were trained on him. He quickly faced his cupboards once more. "Like what you see?" he asked with false casualness as he continued to take off his clothes, heedless of Harry's presence.
"No, as I said, we're no longer together. I've decided that you guys are too Gryffindor for me. Goodbye," Pansy said flippantly as she walked off.
Deciding what to purchase had taken Harry much longer. Malfoy's colouring was too drastic for any suitable reference, and he personally felt disinclined towards the traditional dark blues and blacks that wizarding men preferred. After two days of deliberation, Harry had ended up purchasing more than he had expected, with softer colours dominating the selection. He desperately hoped that Malfoy wouldn't mind deviating from wizarding tradition just a bit for once.
"Draco be back! Sneezy be taking a letter for Draco from Hogwarts School!" The elf waved the envelope in his gloved hands.
“No, that’s thirty one cakes. You've been obsessed with Draco since you were born,” Greg said as he keyed in the purchase into the register. “But it’s only twenty cakes because I'm giving you a bit of leeway.”
Weasley was surprised by the objection.
Harry waved his wand for the calendar to flip ahead, watching Draco as he took in the exclusive photograph. Draco felt his mouth dry at the picture of a wet, naked, and half hard Potter standing in the sea. Water reaching in the middle of his cock, Harry tilted his head as he combed his matted hair back carelessly. He burst into laughter when a strong wave collided against him.
"M'kay, love you too. More." Harry said incoherently, his words slurring as he patted Draco's hand lightly. "You're 'dorable," Harry mumbled as he moved his hands away, burrowing deeper into his pillow.
"Add six Butterbeers," he requested, dialling on the charm as he smiled at the bartender. Paying for the drinks, he returned to the tables with Pansy. He gave out the drinks brightly to everyone, inclusive of Potter.
"No, it's fine. Party at the bottom, softy on the top. I'll cuddle you after we fuck."
“Just a few,” Harry replied, surprised that they had not started brawling. Maybe they were friends? But their messages only consisted of work related messages, and if Ron and Hermione didn’t know that they were friends—were they friends?
in a low voice. Adamantly keeping his eyes on his book, Draco floated over the lunch Sneezy had prepared for Blaise, together with a stack of the sleazy Muggle romance titles that Blaise had requested, hoping for some peace and quiet for the rest of the ride.
"Please, Potter," she held out a hand as she pressed her glasses higher with a trembling hand. "Please also bring Malfoy to the hospital wing. Take this in case you meet Filch," she handed him a pass.
"No. I was just pulling your leg."
Draco looked at him in disapproval. "They're Unspeakables. They don't go on holidays!"
Potter blinked at him in shock, dark green eyes darting back and forth, between Draco and his Muggle neighbour's door. Thankfully, unlike Potter, Draco was in possession of more class and subtlety. He scanned across Potter's form quickly, taking in the round necked shirt, shorts and Muggle trainers on his feet. Draco gave him a tight nod in acknowledgement.
Breaking out of his spell at Potter's strange throaty noise, Draco looked up, frowning when he noticed that Potter had not touched his proffered tart. "Potter, are you not having any?" He demanded. "Have you grown out sweets too? Are they only for kids?" Draco interrogated with a sneer, connecting the fact that Potter had hardly touched his own cake and was now refusing to have any tart. Whatever had the world become?
6. Defensive body language
Indian food sounds good. Been a while since we had it. I'll buy the coconut milk and chicken?
"Your wandless has improved," Hermione commented, rubbing her neck as she waved off his apologies. Harry could only stare uncaringly at the both of them. He didn't want to start another argument, but they would have known about his wandless if they had decided to spare even a bit of time to help rebuild Hogwarts together.
"So what did Pansy do?" He prompted fondly as Draco cheeks started to colour.
“So Seamus was also impressed by Zonko’s Christmas party kit,” Harry said.
"Hermione!" Draco greeted in surprise when he noticed his friend in his room. "I didn't hear you come in."
"Well, you can always be the obnoxious one. It comes so naturally to you," Draco tried to remove his hand again when the waiter arrived with their dessert. "Are we really going to be the couple that has to hold hands even during meals?" He asked when the waiter left.
Potter frowned in confusion. "Draco, are you gay?" He asked incredulously.
- Ginny
"It's a family tradition for the head of the house to wear their hair long–" Malfoy said as he undid the transfiguration of the mirror, "but I'll probably never grow my hair longer than this. I don't want to look like how Father used to."
Ashamed, hopeful and amicable
Grateful and excited
Harry leaned backwards reflexively when Parkinson's grin widened. "So Potter, why did you break up with the she-Weasley?"
he thought as he strode out of his quarters.
Taking the London underground never ceased to be awe inspiring – from working the ticketing machines to watching the trains pull up, Draco had come to the fact that Muggles were incredibly intelligent individuals with great forays into the field of component design, a branch of study they called
” Draco repeated incredulously. He was repulsed. It was worse than the hate mails he got sparingly whenever the public was reminded of his existence.
Draco fidgeted in the seat, ashamed of his stray thoughts referencing to the Muggle non-violence moment. Oh, his tattered dignity, Draco lamented as he focused on the marble floor, the weight of everyone's eyes on him as the Hat hummed idly to itself above him.
His eyes were blurring when he felt the wards of Grimmauld Place shift.
"Let's go," he insisted as he stood up anyway. "You'll be able to concentrate better afterwards. Let's go. Even if you're not hungry, it'll be a break. Let's gooooo."
However, all the goodwill he had initially possessed towards Daphne had now evaporated. How could dark hair, no preference for blood status, interest in muggle technology, discerning tastes in clothes, avid interest in learning and a love for slow days equate to Finch-Fletchley? In retrospect, he really should have pursued the reason for Daphne's amusement when she processed his application. Had she been thinking about his compatibility with Finch-Fletchley? It was a wonder how her business could thrive when her comparability spells were so poor.
"Maybe you should meet Pansy today," Draco joked as they reached their dorm, lining up patiently with the other students waiting to enter the door.
Narcissa nodded with an amused smile. "I don't think that his ego would ever recover if you said no."
The camera zooms out to reveal a stocky man in a frilly pink apron, his lips pursed as he frowns in concentration.
new colleagues.
"Get off me," Harry wheezed in laughter as he fended off the boy trying to crawl into his lap. "Dean, help! Your boyfriend!" He yelled as he felt himself sliding off the couch while flailing desperately.
"That's decent advice," Malfoy nodded. "You should probably do the reverse. Give them such a terrible present that they'll actually curse your name forever," he laughed as he pretended to shake his fist at Harry.
Harry blinked at him in shock, astounded when Draco only dug into his dessert. "So you're not mad?" He asked Draco hopefully.
Harry groaned noisily into his pillow as he rolled around his bed in agony. Absorbed in his antics, he wished that Malfoy would express concern, but was alas, too preoccupied by his own misery to catch the prolonged look of horror on Malfoy's face as he glanced backwards fearfully.
Draco had spent an entire month with resources from the Public Library, reading about Muggle engineering, Muggle post, Muggle science, Muggle literature, psychology, and learning to use the internet at the shared computers. The access to a varied source of novel information was terribly exciting for Draco, and it was reminiscent of his childhood where Worry would have to bribe him to put down his books and turn in.
"Fuck tradition," Harry said quietly.
"Is this about the war?" Hannah asked.
"I think that it's a good offer," she said evenly with a smile on her face. "Ron and I wouldn't have to worry about you if Draco's chaperoning."
Regardless of his thoughts, Draco felt his lips rise, in mirror of the smirks on his friends' faces.
that girl Weasley and Luna were getting together, joking that Luna's oral fixation complemented girl Weasley's enjoyment of cunnilingus, a piece of information that neither Weasley nor Draco had appreciated.
Draco sighed to himself as he sat up gently, careful to not wake his dark haired companion.
"No I'm not," Malfoy snapped. "I have proper Muggle clothes, just so you know. But this is Hogwarts and you're supposed to wear robes."
jumper which Harry had gleefully customised from the Wheezes' Christmas catalogue.
“Of course! I’ve been thinking about the problem for so long, and I’ve finally solved it, and I was going to look for you. Let me tell you about it before I forget,” he said desperately, tugging her along again; the further they were from the alcove the better.
"Teeny tiny," Harry giggled as he raised his hand to show how small he would be.
I am going on a date tomorrow and I have been planning very hard for it. I am very excited! I am going to hit them with surprise so hard that they'll fall over.
Draco and Hermione stopped to talk to the prefects they met along the way back. As Head Boy and Girl, most of their duties involved scheduling, chairing meetings, and liaising with the headmistress rather than actual patrols, which suited Draco just fine. Patrols were tedious and incredibly dull, if you asked him.
“Draco, it’s okay! It’s okay,” he huffed at the vials pressing on his knees. It was indeed a terrible present, he thought as he tried to shove them away, only for them to roll back, into the depression of the bed, where he was crouching. He reached for his wand to vanish them in annoyance.
"I see, have a great work out, Potter," Draco said mildly with a cordial nod as he began to leave. If there was a little more sway in his hips, it would only have been a coincidence.
Draco stared at him in shock as he processed the information. "I appreciate the gift but I don't want you to be unhappy," he said quietly as he retrieved the letter that he had unintentionally crumpled, smoothing it carefully with his hands.
Harry's smile was mischievous. He tucked his hands into his front pockets as he rocked on the balls of his feet. His satisfaction at leaving Draco speechless was obvious. "Well, you value sleep too much to stay up late, but when you do, you're usually tired and frustrated, which is a strange combination. Then I eavesdropped on your conversation with Theo—" He shrugged.
"No, I can be anything I want," Harry argued as he tried to resist Draco's forceful hands, trying to close his fingers.
of the young lovesick Potter fans.
"You're not going with Luna?"
Draco glanced at him while stirring his latest attempt at his Beautification potion. He continued to count as he waited for it to turn blue. "When is your reservation?"
“Your opinions are invalid, that’s what it is. I told you! I told you to take care of yourself, but you’re out there, opening the mails happily, and that Bubotuber pus!” He pressed his hands against his face, fingers under his spectacles as he trembled. “I should have known,” he said softly as he shook his head.
"Yeah. We're staying together, right?" Harry said as he toweled his hair, making it messier than it already was. Mother and Andromeda were continuing their tour of China, Arthur and Molly were visiting Charlie, Hermione and Ron were visiting Japan, and Pansy and Theo were going to France while Blaise and Ginny were attending his mother's seventh wedding in Cairo.
"What is the matter?" McGonagall said in shock as she rushed across the wide room to meet them.
“You’re full of cheap tricks, Malfoy,” he complained, drying them both with a sulk and an accusatory jab of his wand. “Where did you even learn that? Was it in the book?”
"Pansy, I've been nothing but upstanding since
"They’re my tears of happiness," he said seriously as he smoothed the silk handkerchief in Harry's hand.
Harry sighed to himself. He hadn't anticipated it to be easy, but Malfoy really made it so terribly hard to talk to him. "I shan't," Harry said as he began to unpack his stationery.
"Think about the Ravenclaws, please," Parkinson replied as she tugged Nott and Malfoy to join.
"Right. Sorry," Harry ducked his head guiltily. "Figured that you guys would want to know what happened as soon as possible." He felt distinctly wrong footed as they only continued to look at him. Grasping for straws, he turned to Malfoy.
Harry put an arm around Draco's waist. "There's still a bit of time between now and dinner. Maybe if you can play it off you'll have a bit of space for some pasketti."
Anyway, I wouldn't have told them what you were wearing but I can see why you would worry. I'm getting more and more excited about your date! It's almost like I'm going on it too.
Harry finally pushed away sheepishly. “So that happened," he said with the typical embarrassment of a Gryffindor after leaping into a situation.
"Draco, please. It hasn't been about the contract for me for the longest time!"
Molly has decided to throw a birthday party for you whether or not you are around, and the damned thing starts right at seven in the morning.
Harry clapped loudly at the end of the announcements, pushing Ron away when his friend wiggled his brows insufferably at him. He really shouldn't have told his friends why he was late.
Unlike his lover, Draco felt challenged by verbal expressions of affection. His parents had never been particularly demonstrative of their love, instead manifesting it in their indulgence of him. He could interpret his mother's love from the meals she sent him, and he reciprocated through equivalent gestures whenever he saw something she might like.
“Malfoy finally replied to me,” he told Greg as he straightened from his lean against the counter.
"And the lucky person is–" Seamus paused heavily for excitement while Ernie MacMillan and Neville made drum roll noises on their thighs.
In a grey vest thrown atop a crisp white button down and a marching set of grey pants, Potter looked like every wet dream Draco had ever had, his sharp attire accentuating his natural, if not slightly dangerous appeal. Draco felt his cheeks flush as he shifted in his seat.
He nearly collapsed in gratitude when the server appeared with both of their orders.
Draco suppressed the urge to burst out laughing at the statement. Potter had in fact, been
Harry batted his hands away as he held them loosely in his. "Just vocalising my thoughts, love. So am I good enough? Am I able to replace an extra-extra-extra—" Harry made an exaggerated, winded noise when Draco shoved at his abdomen. Harry smiled at him lazily as he extracted himself to pull the covers over them with a loud sigh.
"So you'll kiss me on the cheek?"
Buoyant as he returned to the common room, he stopped short at the stench and the sight of a girl drenched in vinegar. Draco sighed to himself as he walked up to them. The Hufflepuff common room password was infamously simple, yet it was shameful how it seemed to be too difficult for
Draco sighed as he leaned backwards. Harry had just left, but he was already missing him. His relationship with Harry was so easy. Ever since they had agreed to be friends years ago, they had always paired off during outings, the conversations between them endless as the number of inside jokes piled up. The transition from friends to more had taken him a bit, but Draco would learn to let his guard down overtime. Unfolding the papers, Draco was excited for the future to come.
Heightyhill's Household Helpers—Draco marvelled darkly at the new stationery on his desk. He turned it around, stuck his finger clumsily into the flap, immediately dropping it when a blue spell shot towards his eyes, shattering and bouncing off the charmed lens on his dragonhide mask. Swearing loudly, he rounded his desk to inspect the singe in his wallpaper.
"Give it back," Harry groused as he snatched the present back from slack hands.
Unintended outcome: tea from Harry every morning when I work with the Aurors
Original curiosity: why does Kreacher not make him coffee?
“Of course not! You’ll need to fill it first,” Teddy said with a roll of his eyes as he lifted it to eye level. “Everyone would be so jealous,” he said to himself.
“Is your present safe?” He asked over his shoulder.
Draco had been heading for lunch one day when he had received a recruitment flier for volunteering at GOSH. He had been exploring the convergence of Muggle and Wizarding psychology, and had been taken by the more sympathetic nature of Muggle psychology (regardless of its multiple false starts due to unfortunate bigotry). The idea of utilising his knowledge to provide support for patients and their parents appealed to him. The opportunity to interact with Muggles was also a significant boon in his quest for self-rehabilitation.
It was unbecoming to skulk about, but it definitely counted as extenuating circumstances. There was little he could do, he reasoned with himself, doubling back towards the front of the Post Office for the umpteenth time, before stopping and turning away once more. Oh for Merlin's sake! Draco huffed, clenching his jaw as he stormed through the doors, envelope in hand.
Working his other hand along the bottom of Harry's prick,  Draco swallowed as he felt fingers along his scalp, guiding him as Harry thrusted into his throat. Breathing through his nose, he loosened his jaw as he continued to pump the base of Harry's cock, basking in the groans he pulled out.
"Fine, but I really could have been, you know?"
"Yeah, we're going to Andromeda's on Saturday, aren't we?"
Draco bit his lower lip as he turned the fire down to a simmer. "Can we go somewhere else instead? We still haven't been to the Chinese restaurant that Andromeda recommended."
Harry was frightened by Malfoy's forcefulness. He scanned Malfoy's face in confusion while the other continued to stare straight at him. For no particular reason, the room suddenly felt too crowded and oppressive and he needed to escape.
"The resonance? Har-" he was cut off as Harry stepped up and crashed his lips against his.
Draco had grown increasingly uneasy throughout breakfast, concerned about Harry's emotional state. On top of whatever confusion that had contributed to his distraction, Harry would also be feeling terribly guilty at having let Weasley down. Gesturing for Blaise to look after Weasley, Draco had spent the short window of time he had before leaving for his Saturday volunteering session looking for his friend. However, the Quidditch pitch, astronomy tower, and the kitchens were empty.
Draco
"I should work on Charms tomorrow–" Malfoy mumbled to himself with, automatically opening his mouth when Harry's spoon came, "–no I can't keep trying to catch up with Granger," he shook his head vehemently.
It was illogical that there was only one shared narrow entrance and exit to the Hufflepuff common room. An entering student could not do so when another was exiting and vice versa, he elaborated in earnest. Much less running back to the dorms to pick up a forgotten essay in the morning. A whole line of students would be waiting to exit, making entering impossible.
"That would be me, one of the many indebted to Healer Draco's skillful hands." If the patient was surprised to see the saviour of the wizarding world and the Appleby Arrows' exalted seeker, it didn't show.
Weasley leapt into fury at the insinuation. "They wouldn't dare!" He exclaimed. "You're not that much of a ponce anymore now, are you? If a Weasley and a Malfoy can get along, I don't see why you can't be saving people!"
"Not until I figure out how you did it," Draco replied airily as he started to set up the cauldron. "Off you go, Potter. Even potions geniuses need ingredients, you know?"
"It's your hair. You didn't manage to tame your cowlick," Harry said quietly as he reached over to attempt it himself.
and donated the products to his colleague, whose daughter had acne.
“Well, nothing’s worth being huffy about!” the man repeated, waving his glass carelessly when Draco heard a familiar giggle.
"Don't worry about your chastity, Potter," Malfoy smirked at him as his eyes dropped to Harry's crotch quickly. He gave Harry a saucy wink, "I'll defend it properly."
“Yeah, Harry’s an Auror.” Harry was smiling as he climbed back into his chair, his hair in a fresh bun.
"The beef noodles?"
How could Pansy? Did she not know how precarious their positions were? His eyes were hot as he stood there, frozen in shock and fear as his ears rang with the wanton sounds of the couple’s shameless makeout session.
Harry sighed as he fell back onto his bed. He had finally listened to Hermione and initiated conversation with Malfoy, but all these exchanges seemed more like harassment on his part.
“You look like crap,” he whispered hoarsely as he took in Harry’s greasy hair and the imprint of the sheets on his cheek.
Upset, Draco pressed his cousin close for support as the other man suddenly stormed off. "He's usually a lot more pleasant," Draco apologised to Potter before reaching for Teddy's hand. "Shall we get some dittany for that scar, Teddy?" Draco asked as he led his cousin in search of a Healer's tray, motioning for Potter to follow.
Draco quickly pinned him down. "Take it back," he demanded.
"Oh," Harry said softly at the reminder.
"Is that a challenge?" Harry squared his jaw.
for Merlin’s sake. Not trusting himself to speak lest he propositioned Harry, Draco nodded quickly, shivering involuntarily at the bright smile that Harry gave him.
“I’ve brought gifts,” he tacked on quickly as Malfoy fastened his blazer and straightened his hair. It didn’t seem like a good time—Malfoy’s table was strewn with papers and his under eyes were dark from sleep deprivation. Harry had checked the Ministry records for orders to Malfoy’s firm and he had expected a potential lull in the workload.
"Well, I'd vote to keep the next party on Wednesday. Not only is it disruptive, it's also incredibly chaotic, which automatically means that it'll have my support," Parkinson said over her champagne to the resounding support of the Hufflepuffs and one Seamus Finnegan.
With usual aplomb, Draco had managed well.
Ron whistled in amazement when the note reached its intended destination. "It's hard to obsess over a Slytherin when you're in Gryffindor," he commented with a shake of his head as he attempted to finish his apple strudel.
Starting to button from the bottom, he watched the guilt flash across Harry’s face as he took in the scars on his chest. Harry's eyes stayed for a few moments as he bit his lips before trailing down Draco’s body and then returning to his abdomen where his hands were at.
Harry looked at Malfoy skeptically as he leaned away for safety. "I, erm—but I'm dressed? Nothing's on display," he touched the cuffs that he had rolled above his elbows nervously.
"Can I kiss you?" Harry asked as he leaned in, heart tender from the well of affection, tenderness and happiness from simply looking at Draco.
"Or a walker, I guess? He might be walking soon."
Pleasure softened Malfoy's features as he beamed uncharacteristically at him. "It's fine. The betrayal on your face when I knocked you out was more than enough," he laughed.
"Fine," Draco said. His friends cheered. Ron slapped him on the back while Harry blinked at him in disbelief. "I'll do it, but you'll have to sign up for Bainbridge & Daughters. Secondly, I will also have access to your nasty letters and serve them cease and desist orders. Thirdly, any other excursions will be according to my schedule. I will also be remunerated for my headache."
Draco looked up from his page to meet her eyes. Surprised by the seriousness that he saw, he nodded in agreement in place of anything better.
"No," Malfoy shook his head sharply, then flinching as if stunned by his own vehemence. "Merlin, I don't mean that. I'll share them later, but I want to look at it a bit more. I want to show them to my friends too," he said softly as he worried at his bottom lip.
Both Harry and Ron jumped, Harry drawing a line across the rude note he was crafting for Malfoy. Hermione had made that joke a few times throughout the years, but the dryness of her delivery had always ensured that it landed well.
Draco looked up quizzically. "Warm water? Tea?"
"I'm a party even on top," Draco said just to be contrary as he took the knitted jumper with a sigh. As usual, he was giving in to everything that Harry requested. The entry in his journal would be a highlight of his failures. Pulling it on, he ripped a hand through his hair to ensure that it wasn't ruffled. He straightened his collar and tugged at his shirt sleeves for it to peek out just so. Overall, it didn't look too bad. The thickness of the material made him look a bit too cosy, but it was reasonable for the cuddles he would get in exchange.
"Seamus, knock it off," Hermione said as she pulled the boy off firmly by the arm, a small smile of amusement on her lips when she met Harry's bright eyes and flushed cheeks.
Draco shook the other man in frustration. "I'll kill you one day and it'll be completely justified."
"So you do the book thing too?" Potter asked as he nodded at the coloring book when Teddy returned to his drawing with doubled excitement. Art supplies as a method of distraction was pioneered by Andromeda, and it had proven its versatility many times over.
Ron shushed him quickly as he set up a Muffliato “How could we not? Did you see how the Hufflepuff girls used to look at you?”
Draco's expensive French linen bed sheets.
"Potter! It's cursed!" Draco yelled out of the blue, laughing when the other startled, knocking the box out of his own hands. In his fumbling attempts to catch it, his fingers came into contact with the cufflinks anyway. "You should have seen your face!" Draco laughed as he mimicked Potter's comical movements.
"Finished the last of it yesterday," he made a victory sign at Draco.
"Then it's quite accurate, isn't it? You all were hot headed and arguing all the time in Gryffindor. Plus the whole being brave business. Now that we're here, you're reading about gardening, your knees are dusty from burrowing about, and I'm thinking about stealing food. We couldn't be more Hufflepuff if we tried."
“He’s a good boy,” Teddy said, petting his pot fondly as he set it down. “I’ll get you your favourites? Do you want anything else?” he asked Harry and Malfoy, thanking him when Harry handed him his wallet.

"So I guess that you're also a feelings person now? Dating a Gryffindor has addled your mind, too?" Harry teased as he thumbed his tears away.
For example, he had initially begun with gripes about sharing a room with Malfoy, before he realised that Malfoy was a considerate roommate. The rants had then become about Malfoy's unnerving reticence, his occasional limp and prolonged absences, which would then progress to concerns about Malfoy's nightmares and his dietary habits or lack thereof–but alas, Hermione had already established the ban on Malfoy observations by then. While it was undeniable that his points would stagnate for a while until he made new observations, Harry felt that his friends should look at the variety he had to offer in the long run.
"Does it look bad?" Harry asked.
Potter," Harry said as he broke into a smile at Draco's gobsmacked expression.
"Charlotte," he greeted before nodding at Susan who was standing behind her.
"I love Draco Malfoy, and one day, we will be a family. I will not have my future robbed from me. I will fight everyone who stands between me and my happiness."
Harry flipped the present in his hands, frowning in confusion at the stellotape running crookedly across the parchment. He wished that Hermione wasn’t so busy talking to the fourth year students, just so that someone would explain the situation to him.
"Draco, I want it yellow," Teddy said as he suddenly thrust the silver tinsel into his face.
"Alright," Draco said, thinking about the first Muggle movie he had glimpsed in an electronics shop. The entire wall of televisions had been playing the same movie, and Draco had been awed by the very long coloured Wizarding picture until a Muggle salesperson had come to bother him. Muggles were incredible, Draco thought idly, his eyelids drooping, his limbs heavy at the verge of sleep.
"That's rich coming from you. You guys are practically plastered together," Ginny waved at the both of them.
"I haven't," he insisted, shaking his head at Harry's transparent amusement. "I just never noticed that she was so close to Hermione."
"Mr Dearborn?" Potter repeated in confusion, brows rising in surprise when he suddenly noticed the sandy haired stranger between them.
"I'm not flirting!" Malfoy flailed, grabbing onto the table when he nearly fell off his high stool. Harry steadied him by the arm. "Thanks," he mumbled with flushed cheeks before glaring at his friends.
, but his fringe was a lot longer than it had been before, which was information not shared on his profile. It was ridiculous. These changes were precisely the sort of thing that should be catalogued, not the sunset, peonies, dusty books on a shelf, his computer, Pansy’s fingernails, a swan, and Blaise holding up his middle finger. It was incredibly frustrating when out-of-place Harry grasped the concept of social media better than people who had created it.
Harry moved to grab his bottom in shock. "No, I have my trousers on," he said disapprovingly at Malfoy's antics.
"It's okay, it's okay," Harry soothed as he wrapped an arm around Draco's neck, while the other pet Draco's head comfortingly.
All sense left Harry as Malfoy's agitated refrain suddenly sounded like an command—and any commands from Malfoy had to be challenged. "I shan't! I
"Funny, I was going to ask the same of you."
Harry looked at the innocuous present lying on his bed once more. It was the last night he was spending with Draco before the winter break, but the present was calling out his name, and he had never been good at managing his impulses.
Harry groused as he interlocked their smallest fingers reluctantly. Hermione cast the Promise spell grimly. She had developed it to maintain verbal agreements and it played too well into all of their Gryffindor tendencies to break it. The spell would also fill the person with despair whenever they were going to break the promise, and it was needless to say that Harry was disproportionately affected. The number of rules enacted in his disfavour was inconveniencing his existence.
Their
"Just drop that Potions reading," he advised when Malfoy continued to look stumped after Harry had done his teeth.
"So I managed to get a reservation for the new French restaurant at Diagon."
of his bloodline weighing him down on each shoulder. He had been so deep in thoughts of self-pity and loathing that morning, flinching and curling into himself when Harry had touched him. Draco’s expression must have been frightful when he whirled around, Harry’s face immediately shuttering, leaving him alone, and now he had nobody to talk to.
“Are you alright?” she interrupted, tugging him to a stop as she looked at him carefully.
Draco sighed when he boarded the carriage. Couldn't the Golden Trio have walked a little further down? The awestruck students on the platform had migrated to outside what was presumably Potter's cabin, pushing against each other to catch a sight of Potter, as if months of idle reporting of Potter's whereabouts hadn't been enough.
Draco shrugged when Harry looked at him in exasperation. Teddy had lined Draco, Harry, and himself one after another on the same branch, and only Teddy could be seen from the front. "As long as I'm the one at the back," he told Harry lowly. Harry frowned at him in confusion, before pointing the middle finger at him when he understood.
Harry slanted his eyes at him. "Of course, that's why you've spent two years creating three potions."
"But Malfoy's friends are so weird!" Harry complained just as an origami crane settled gracefully in front of him. He looked up only to see the Malfoy chatting with one of the younger Slytherins.
," Draco interrupted. "There is no
Draco sighed when Harry elbowed him in the rib. "I am sorry for causing you bodily harm. I was aiming for Blaise," he said sullenly, deepening his sulk for good measure when Harry smiled at him in approval.
The injustices he had levied against non-Slytherin students had discouraged Harry from studying Potions, and the weak foundation compounded anything else that he learnt. It had been obvious when Malfoy had quizzed him on the basics to gauge his proficiency. However, unlike Snape, while Malfoy had been frustrated, his patience did not waiver, and Harry had been immensely grateful.
"Really?" Harry broke out of his agony to grin at Draco.
I was surprised to receive your owl. I would like to apologise for the spectacle I unintentionally caused during our last meeting. I was a bit too worked up by your clothes, and I do not mean the accusations that I levied on you.
"So you're not meeting her?"
Harry worried at his lip as he passed the present to Draco, too nervous to think. He was familiar with Draco’s subterfuge to know that if he did not address it himself, Draco would bring it up later at a time more advantageous to himself.
"I didn't actually mean the things that I said," Potter continued, holding a hand up when Draco made a motion to interrupt. "I was jealous and insecure, and I've realised that I've always been a little bit obsessed with you, and not knowing what you did during the weekends really got to me, you know? And it upset me when you wouldn't tell me, when I had no right to be. I felt that you were keeping us out, and feeling like you'd just disappear after school scared me. I've come to expect you being around so much, all of that entitlement made me snap." His cheeks were pink with embarrassment as he looked down at his nails.
Harry frowned as he chewed on his food, distinctly aware that Draco was underplaying the effort he put into the presents. After maxing out her borrowing allowance too many times, Harry had suggested that Hermione copy the books, only to be served a discourse about the anti-replication spells in many books and how using magic on the older books would cause them to crumble to dust. Harry looked at Draco pensively.
"Normal people don't read such stuff," Potter said as he broke off into a yawn without closing his mouth. "Are you ever going to join us for Quidditch?" He asked as he dug his toes into Draco's thighs pointedly.
"Potter will you cease with this nonsense!" Draco yelled as he tried to roll him over. "Hand it over this instant!"
"You're a wizard, Harry."
Stopping when they reached the apparition point, Draco rolled his eyes before reaching for Potter's shoulder, quickly cataloguing the muscles under his arm before apparating near their lunch place.
"We should bet on who sets them off and when it'll happen."
"Did they leave a note?" He asked as he retreated to his side of the bedroom. Malfoy picked up the small slip of paper, huffing in amusement when he read it.
Please advise on the preferred meeting place and time. I will be there with bells on.
“Tell that to yourself,” Draco said as he reached for the cheese platter, his cheeks flushed with pleasure.
“That’s it?” Harry asked when Malfoy didn’t continue. “There’s no sign off?”
It had taken a while, but he was finally home.
Harry shook his head as he lay back down. "Just for today. Too tired to get to Narnia," he mumbled as he turned around to be the little spoon.
Draco gaped at him. "But all the weekly dates! And the monthly outings?"
"Welcome to our sett!" Professor Sprout was cheery to the point of being exhausting as she held everyone's attentions in front of a pile of barrels in a stone recess near the Hogwarts kitchen. "The password is easy, so you'll never have to worry about forgetting it! Just tap this barrel to the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff'!" She demonstrated as the door swung outwards. "Make sure to tap correctly, or," she trailed off, laughing as she caught the eyes of previous students from her house.
Towards the end, Harry had to beg Hermione to request for his counsel after fictitious arguments with Ron, or he would pretend that he suddenly had very active bowels–just so that he could research and correspond for Draco's gifts. It drove him spare to learn that he had experienced all that trouble because Draco wanted to feel
“I knew that you’d spoil him.”
Draco was still walking to the bus stop around the corner of the Post Office when his bus pulled up noisily. Closely avoiding an old man, he ran to catch the bus to Harrods where he would buy more of the biscuits that his mother liked. He also saw his mother and Pansy every week – in separate occasions of course – though sometimes they would overlap, which would be a strange experience for none of his companions but himself.
"It's always been you," Draco said wondrously as they caught their breaths, his eyes completely black from lust.
A day after the disastrous event with Potter, Draco had approached Pansy for help to throw Potter's scent off. He had sat through the requisite "We've been telling you this from the beginning!", the "This obsession is getting ridiculous, you need to get over Potter" and the worst, the "Draco you need to stop running away from your feelings, we are all worried for you" spiel before receiving the advice that he needed.
, and Harry felt like he had missed something, as usual. He stepped towards Malfoy's bed when he heard a noise of confusion.
"You forgot your duties regarding the party," Harry stated as he fed Malfoy another bite. "You have a meeting at Zabini and Goyle's at ten thirty."
"Why?" Draco asked with thick suspicion. "I
"Harry, you'll win the match against Neville. You're not actually scared now, are you? Don't listen to girl Weasley's rubbish about determining the real hero. You can do it," he coached as he grasped his friend by the side of his arms. It was strange that Harry would suddenly be worried about the touted '
If Draco could hurt people with the force of his glare, she would have been flattened on the creaky wooden floor of Three Broomsticks. Clicking her tongue, Pansy's eyes slid slowly over to Draco, brows rising in question when she noticed his expression.
"What's so funny?" Malfoy asked him with a frown. "Pansy gets things done."
"Yeah?"
Harry James Potter is standing nude behind a counter with only his Gryffindor scarf around his neck. The top of the counter reaches his hips, preserving his modesty. Sunlight spills in from the long window in the kitchen.
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter are standing beside each other. Dressed in a light pink and gold metallic finish flower print Muggle cut suit, Draco Malfoy's combover is artfully tousled. Harry Potter is dressed in a dark green velvet Muggle cut double breasted suit with shifting gold embroidery of wood nymphs from his right lapel to over his collar. His hair is in a neat low bun, his famous scar uncovered with a single loose strand falling from the top of his head. Harry Potter looks hesitant, leaning closer to Draco Malfoy, who is standing straight as he smirks into the camera, hands in his pockets
Draco shook his head without reply as he tried to focus on his letter. In its entirety, the school year had been a lot better than he had initially expected.
“So Ron and Hermione also rigged the exchange for me to draw your name,” he said quickly when Draco looked at him in confusion for handing him the unopened gift from Ron.
instead.
book, didn't I? After stripping the glamours, I had you tap your wand on it while unconscious. You didn't expect people to search for it, and it's nothing particularly incriminating, so the security isn't that high." He thumbed his nose proudly like the top student in Documents, Forms, and Filing that he was.
The combination of Harry's right dimple and earnest hunger for praise made Draco nervous. He wanted to push Harry against the wall and to devour the smile so that it would only be his alone. He wanted to bruise his lips, to cage that innocence for himself. He shrugged brusquely before heading to his collection of colognes.
As you know, Muggle clothes cannot be expanded. I am aware that you are a busy man, but I also know that you will get a
“It was an injury. There was blood and—” Draco large gestures stopped when Harry moaned appreciatively at the tangy lemon curd, the light sponge of the lemon lookalike, and the butternut crumble.
"You're N?" He asked in disbelief in reference to the prior correspondence he had with the owner. He knew that Mrs. Malfoy had left for the continent after being acquitted, but to run a bed and breakfast in a remote countryside? He realised that the secrecy was both ways—to not only protect her lodgers but also herself.
“Draco’s a very nice person,” he said louder, nearly falling onto Ron when Draco tried to shut him up. “You could try glaring harder,” he laughed as Draco glanced around furtively, scowling at anyone who were looking at them.
Draco was collecting his toiletries now, and Harry chewed on his lips. He sighed heavily in defeat. Ultimately, he had always been worse at refusing Draco’s suggestions. Harry quickly peeled off his outerwear to follow him.
“A few too many galleons alright. The pot was bloody blinking, and the feathers were honest to Merlin distinct. Admit it, Potter. You’re a softie.”
"You know, Potter," Draco said as he helped Teddy keep his crayons away when his noodles arrived. "Mother really likes Indian food." He nodded in commiseration at the look of disbelief on Potter's face. "Shall we have dinner together one day? We'll bring the best from the Manor and you can bring something from your cookbook. It'll be a culinary exchange of sorts."
"You don't sound excited," Harry said in confusion.
for Potter. The idea of it always made him shudder. The only feelings he had with regards to the speccy git was immense annoyance. Couldn't Potter have been a less fine specimen of a man?
Draco pressed his fingernails into his palms desperately as Potter nodded vigorously with a wide and silly smile. The reception of positive acknowledgement from Potter stirred up intense and confusing emotions that overwhelmed him and made his heart stumble.

"Bus or Underground, Draco," Pansy asked. "We're having a wager over here."
Harry hummed in amusement. “It’s a ploy to lower your guard.”
Bidding everyone goodbye, including Potter, he buttoned his coat as he stepped out into the night. He sighed to himself as the biting cold stung his cheek. Trust Potter to make things difficult for him. Had things even been this complex with Theo? He trudged towards the castle, refusing to be hopeful, yet foolishly wishing that Potter would give chase.
Draco greeted Blaise with a nod, before wordlessly indicating that it would be curfew soon. The Slytherin was, as usual, working his charm on impressionable younger students. The poster boy of interhouse unity, Blaise had brought Pansy's business to the common rooms of every house, and had packed her schedule through the new year.
"I'll miss you over the Holidays," Draco said after a while, playing with the hair on the nape of Harry's neck while he looked beyond Harry's shoulder in typical Draco caginess.
"Nope. My intuition can tell that something's off, and I won't rest until I figure it out." Harry watched him add the Lady's Mantle into the cauldron with narrowed eyes.
Harry watched a series of emotions flit through Draco's face–confusion, amusement, anger, frustration, resignation, forced nonchalance, and then bitterness.  "You better be giving it to me for Christmas," he said with a sulk as he snatched his mousse up huffily.
“We’re trying to save you, mate. Hermione's right that you need a date to the Ball. A proper date would be better, but we can't be picky—"
. And he was still fine yesterday morning," he insisted with a smile that reached his eyes. In this dire period, their conversation was conducted with pureblood subterfuge. With their periodic full bodied laughter and casual smiles, no one would have realised that they were in fact strategising.
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, huffing in amusement, the corner of her mouth lifted in a sardonic smile. "Don't worry, I'll leave them alone from now on. I don't know what came over me, honestly," she said, shuddering as she drew her cloak closer around herself.
"How dare you make me a worder! Do you know how often people say
better than the Muggle method of waiting it out.
"It's from Hogwarts," Draco said. He set the envelope aside to coo at Minerva's eagle owl and praise it effusively.
Conditions:
"What now?" Harry asked wearily.
It was obvious that Harry’s condition reminded Malfoy of his father. Lucius had become nothing but a shell after his release from Azkaban, but where his father was essentially a shadow of himself, Harry was functional. He was still making new memories, learning old ones. Malfoy didn’t need to be so upset, and surely he would be embarrassed to show Potter so much emotion.
fought with the crowds to purchase the book) where Thunderous had elaborated his insertion of a whole arm into a horny dragon's vagina to soothe her.
, really. He bit back a smile when he noticed Malfoy's knuckles turn white.
"Oh," Harry exclaimed when he unwrapped a large bag of Chocolate Frogs.
"You'll be begging when Pansy has her clutches on you," he commented. "She has made plans already."
Draco broke his fourth rule as he wondered about a nude Harry Potter. It would probably be equally delightful if not more so, he speculated. Draco sighed to himself as Hester floated their cakes to them for tea. He was now getting maudlin and inappropriate. Thanking Merlin for Pansy's absence as he helped himself to the cake, he blinked at the refreshing flavour.
"Thanks," Harry said, reluctantly reaching for the urgent pile. His brows climbed as he read a note. "It's already addressed. Robards didn't know that I was out yesterday." He set down the original in his hand sheepishly.
"We'll be good." Harry promised.
Harry scratched his head sheepishly. Andromeda had said the same when he had left her house a week ago, and the comment still made him uncomfortable. He wanted to be dependable, but the idea that he was so stagnant scared him. He felt like all of his friends had made strides in both their careers and personal lives. While he had done okay for himself in the first, he was stuck with the latter.
Beyond his increased volunteering slots and his books, Draco had spent the rest of the holidays with Harry, wandering around Muggle London, and – the unthinkable – Diagon Alley. Pansy had owled a copy of
Draco smiled at her gratefully. He had barely skimmed the write-up from Pansy, but knowing the effort from Harry and his friends, it would surely be good. "Did you meet Harry on your way out? I just woke up, and we had a bit of a talk." He said shyly.
Harry huffed in amusement as he closed his eyes. Draco took the opportunity to look at the shadow of Harry’s lashes against his cheeks, the slope of his nose, and the amused upturn of his lips.
Draco felt his face heat at the casual jab, desperately wishing for the floor to swallow him whole. He only wore variations of his preferred woody scent, and the one with citrus notes was his choice for respectable gatherings—something that Harry had obviously noticed. He so often belittled Harry's eye for details to disastrous outcomes. He bit his lips sharply while Harry made a show of looking through every cupboard.
"Well, you're the one who started it."
"Pansy and I are remaining in England. You don't need fantastic NEWTs to make clothes or furniture, you know?" Greg said with a shrug, as gullible as ever. Draco would have been contented to leave Potter curious and unsatisfied forever – or until they boarded that was.
organically that it wasn't surprising that he had royally messed up his first and only attempt at officially making
"Thanks," he said as he tucked his wand under his pillow, sighing when the lights in the room went out. "And for the short Potions lesson today," he added into the darkness. He bit his lips when Malfoy only grunted in response.
"Well—" Harry looked at him with skepticism. He pointed at Draco, then to himself with a pointed tilt of his head.
The two days had passed in a haze of great self-loathing until a barn owl had appeared with a partially completed application form that the headmistress had somehow acquired. As if understanding his predicament, she had filled in the form with a positive slant on his academic accomplishments and character. It was also complete with references from herself and Professor Vector.
"Potter, a present!" Malfoy exclaimed, as he hit Harry's arm repeatedly, "
“Shut up,” he hissed, elbowing Ron in the ribs when he noticed Draco’s interest in the comment.
"Nooooo," Harry squirmed, elbowing Malfoy sharply in the abdomen as he tried to shove the present into the drawer of his bedside table.
“I’ll drop by his office right now.”
Draco
“The most clichéd place ever,” Draco said, bustling around as he started the fire and headed for the bar trolley in the corner. “One finger?” He offered as he raised a decanter.
“Yeah, there isn’t.”
"I don't put out on the first date, Potter. So don’t even bother using that voice on me."
2. Confine topics of discussion to school related questions only. Do not talk about yourself or your life!
"I've never– the Slytherins aren't– I'm very noticeable," Malfoy mumbled when he finally tore his eyes away. Harry nodded in understanding. Lucius would have disowned his son immediately if the news of his son's purchases spread.
Blaise stroked the stubble along his chin pensively. "It's not half bad. You've served so many legal letters to your harassers. Potter could learn a thing or two from you."

Thank you for your CV expressing interest in teaching in Hogwarts. Coincidentally, we currently have an opening for DADA as Fawley has decided to start a museum for his vast collection of teaspoons. I had hesitated to contact you, seeing that you seemed so partial to travelling.
Even though he was scarcely able to comprehend the history of Chinese tea making and drinking then, his mother’s solemn and exact gestures were enough to make him sit down instead of running off to play. He would pepper her with endless questions, then commentary, and finally, when he was older, the grave contemplation that the ritual deserved. He had always thought of it as his first introduction to Potions making, an exact art focused on the intent, and heart of the brewer.
"Salazar! Fancy yourself Head Auror, don't you?"
It was more than Harry had ever expected! Potions theory with Malfoy? Harry felt faint in anticipation, flushing as he peeked as Malfoy. The fight in Malfoy's body had ebbed and he now looked weary and defeated.
“No, no! We look at it separately!” Harry explained, groaning when he realised that the clarification had not been helpful at all.
Harry read the gold letterings for a bit before pretending to give up in disinterest. He counted the vials instead, “that’s a lot of bottles for one present. Does it have a note?”
Harry reflexively opened his mouth to protest, only to realise that it was actually true. He nodded tiredly in agreement while scrounging for another paper. "They'll probably just stare at us while we try to talk to them."
The morning had left Harry overcome with sympathy towards Malfoy again. If Malfoy had failed Lucius on his expectations as a successful Death Eater, would he attempt to redeem himself by settling with a Pureblood wife? Most importantly, how could Ron tell that Malfoy looked gay?
To top it all off, he had Hermione Granger as his partner for Arithmancy and Potions, which meant even more work and ridiculously in-depth research. Even Theo had never challenged him as much in their seven years of schooling together.
Harry felt his face burn as he warred between pleasure and embarrassment. "Alright. Erm, feel better, Malfoy. I'll see you in class. Maybe," he felt distinctly out of place as he bit the insides of his cheek. He nodded at Malfoy's friends.
At a stop away from St Pancras station, Draco collected his thoughts and steeled himself, slipping into the Malfoy sang-froid. Alighting the bus, Draco's steps were unhurried, betraying nothing of his trepidation. He weaved through the crowd easily, filled with a deep sense of displacement. He could still remember the excitement he had felt when departing for Hogwarts for the first time, the puerile anticipation he used to experience like that lifetimes ago. Yet here he was, heading towards Platform Nine and 3/4 once more, without his parents.
"Look, I think that you should sleep. You drank quite a bit today–" he held up a hand when Harry tried to protest, "–we'll talk tomorrow, alright?" He searched Harry's eyes for his response, nodding in satisfaction at what he apparently saw.
Draco Malfoy reminds us why he is our darling and the Saviour of Wizarding fashion. Returning with bold choices, his custom suit from Winthralls is reminiscent of the metallic purple suit he wore to the Selwyn's Fundraiser last year. Never a dull showing, he looks like walking sex, and he knows it.
I wish that you didn't remind me about those events. I am already getting invites for the next six months! Bloody hell, it's
"I'm always good!" Teddy said exuberantly before he charged out of the kitchen while making swooshing noises.
As you might be aware, Hogwarts now has multiple teachers for its core subjects such as DADA, Transfiguration, Charms and Potions to help our staff better manage the workload. I will share more when during our interview.
"Are you finishing your letter?" Potter asked suddenly after a long period of silence between them.
"Salazar, Blaise. I nearly hexed your bollocks off!"
Are you sure that you have not lost your mind?? But that if your apology was sincere, I will accept it. I was hurt and confused when you insulted me. I actually update my work wear closet from time to time and I genuinely thought that I looked quite smart. I didn't notice that I had grown out of them.
Oh, Salazar's slapping balls! Draco waved his clothes back into the wardrobe, only for Harry to flick them back out distractedly as he reached into the wardrobe. He flipped the calendar forward, something Draco had never been able to do due to Hermione's ridiculous spells to conceal Harry's photographs until the start of the new month. It had been intended to drive the calendar sales throughout the year, and while it had been incredibly frustrating, it was undeniably effective. Draco used leap out of bed at the start of every month, discreetly consuming articles lauding Potter's tantalising pictures (lengthy descriptions in prose due to Hermione's replication limitations), and he had even stayed up once to uncover February's photograph at midnight. It had been so ridiculous.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry in disapproval. Harry held on tighter when he tried to pull away.
The man startled as a look of irritation crossed his face. "Young Malfoy. Good to see you back," he barely managed before quickly clearing off.
Nodding to his friends, he led Malfoy out of the room. Reaching to take Malfoy's book, they were silent until they reached the hospital wing.
“I don’t,” Harry said as he looked up quickly. “I don’t spoil him,” he repeated quietly when he noticed the shock on Malfoy’s face at his aggressive tone.
"Thanks," Draco said as he stowed his wand away. "I'll extract Mother’s agreement and then I'll be updated. How did you even come across the property?"
"What! When—"
“This is the kind of bribe that I like,” Teddy said exuberantly as he returned Harry his wallet.
"Wait," Hermione called out. "I think that we're not talking about the same things. We're asking Pansy why she's avoiding us, not asking her to stay away from us."
Blaise grinned shamelessly as he licked his swollen lips in reply. Draco looked away in distaste as Blaise whispered
"Let's go to the Headmistress, shall we?" Ron said with fake cheer as he levitated two students, nodding for the paler-than-usual Malfoy to handle the last.
Harry felt Draco squeeze his thigh as his eyes warmed. “Our loved ones, both in our memories and around us, fought for us to sit here today with our friends–both old and new. As we celebrate the shortest day and the longest night tomorrow, I hope that you will share your blessings, and let the light within you shine brighter. Let us examine and let go of our past this holiday. Give the people around you the gift of forgiveness and focus on your goals and intentions for the coming year.”
Draco shrugged as he looked at Blaise. "Nobody, I think. Pansy will be working, Theo isn't going, and you guys all have plus ones." He looked at the small turnout around the table.
"Why is it so small?" He asked Harry as he flipped the gift in his hands.
Draco nursed his Butterbeer for a few moments before heading to the bar to help girl Weasley with the waters. Laughing about his avoidance of alcohol, he lied about a hangover that morning from his outing with his fellow volunteers yesterday. Capitalising on the sympathy that he received, he talked about the packed day he had at GOSH, and how tired but contented he felt. By the end of the conversation, they had moved on to first names by Ginny's insistence.
"Well, you shouldn't even be saying that someone is gay just because they stare at a few arses or tits," Harry said loudly to regain their attention, taking full advantage of the Muffliato they had set up at the start of lunch.
"I can't believe that you did that just to
"Bought it off my mother's jeweller in fourth year," Draco grinned proudly. "He was initially reluctant to let it go because he had paid a tidy sum for it. I offered him double just for the satisfaction of depriving you." He shrugged. "It just seems so silly now, you know?"
By contrast, she had been terribly interested to know about the progress of his volunteer application at GOSH. Asking about his introduction classes, she had discussed about his permission to leave Hogsmeade and his extended curfew on his volunteer days. Draco had been grateful, but in retrospect, it could have been an elaborate distraction tactic.
right?" Harry hinted heavily as he leaned in to Draco's outstretched hand.
"It goes both ways, honestly."
- Teddy
Malfoy raised his hands as if presenting himself. "Who would be interested in a disgraced Death Eater? The Malfoy name has been tarnished even within Purebloods. I'll most likely be a dirty secret, or a notch on people's bed posts," he said with a deprecating smile.
"Did I interrupt anything?" He asked Zabini, whom he privately considered to be the friendliest amongst Malfoy and his friends.
The information left Draco quite pleased for the entire week.
Draco paused when he felt the burn in his pocket, cursing under his breath as the ink dripped onto his parchment. Waving it away before it spread further, he glanced up to check that he hadn’t disrupted Hermione’s concentration. Homework had been piling up, and with the teachers’ self-guided learning initiative for the eighth years, the number of group projects he had was ridiculous.
"Sorry, I was gone for a bit. Do you need anything?"
"Hermione told me that someone paid two hundred thousand galleons for the extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-large version."
It was incredibly exhausting to be in the company of Gryffindors, he began to write to Pansy, his thoughts in a complete disarray from the argument. An argument with a combination of Gryffindor stubborness and Hufflepuff feelings, he shuddered.
“The pot flies,” Teddy said excitedly to Malfoy.
"Don't even look," Draco insisted as he tried to pull Harry along.
"Read any books lately, Potter?" Draco mentally flinched at his own question. Oh, of all his choices! It took all of his Malfoy upbringing to not betray any of the trepidation he experienced while Potter blinked at him, his lips slowly curling into a smile.
"Onto, not on," Draco chastised, tutting when he noticed the come that had gotten onto Harry's coat. Reaching for Harry's wand, he cleaned the wool with a careful spell. Petting the surface lightly, he slid the wand back into the inside of the coat.
There was only one person who would leave him gifts in the middle of the night—“Pepper?" he whispered, clenching his fist when the house-elf didn’t appear. It had been wishful thinking in the first place, he inhaled shakily, trying not to think about the dirt framing her face when he had buried her.
"Can you give her my well wishes?" Potter asked, his voice sleepy.
to open it and it's not even mine!" He gaped when Malfoy only continued to prepare for his shower. He was sure that he had seen the flicker of intrigue in Malfoy's eyes before it had quickly flashed to fright and deliberate nonchalance.
Harry startled at the address, gaping as he took in the sight of Mrs. Malfoy in a blue Muggle dress at the entryway of the house.

Stunned by her optimism, he suddenly remembered that she had after all, uprooted her entire life and withdrawn to an old Malfoy property to run a bed and breakfast on her own. He suddenly felt ashamed by his thoughts, but he was so tired, and he didn't want to be brave, independent, or strong on his own. He was so lonely, and he just wanted to be
“Let’s hope that your gift isn’t too bad then,” Harry joked as he nodded at the present between Draco’s crossed legs.
"So be it, then. You'll have to come up top amongst all the Aurors. You're not allowed to tamper the test papers of others, encourage them to throw the paper, or try to attain a copy of the paper before the test," he said as he turned the heat on high.
Reaching across the table to catch one of Draco's moving hands, Harry smiled shamelessly when Draco stopped talking to gape at him.
Harry groaned at the woe that was his life. Clutching onto the present, he laid over it on his bed in defeat.
"Just a little bit higher, Teds." Draco got onto his feet as he adamantly ignored Harry's confused stare.
"A little starter before the real drinks," he winked when Thomas commented about the lack of alcohol.
"My money's on Zabini," Ron yelled as he got onto his feet.
“Truce?” Harry offered a bright smile despite the melting snow on his body.
"No, you are a degenerate! You cannot bring your exhibitionist tendencies to Hogwarts!" Malfoy howled as he tried to pull Harry's hands away.
birthday was a source of great escapism.
In the nights of repeated failures after determining that his modified Beautification potion was a dud, he would return from his trials at Muggle clubs to help himself to them. He was a conniving bastard, a manwhore, a boot licker like his father, and filth that ruined readers' days. Above all, he would never be called to join the Brain division of the Department of Mysteries. He had nothing of remark to be had. His potions were a failure, his Thoughts journal was an exercise in futility.
Draco frowned at him. "I'm not sure," he said slowly.
At Harry's request, his birthday party would be a simple affair, unlike the boisterous celebrations the rest of the Wizarding world would be having. It was a respite for the Magical community—Kingsley had commenced the war trials after shaking up his cabinet, and the newspapers had been filled with sombre news for months. A break in the tedium to speculate about Harry Potter's
Zabini shrugged. "Alright, but I'm going to be honest,
" Hermione commanded, glaring at Harry when he failed to comply. "I am doing this for your sanity, Harry," she said menacingly through clenched teeth.
"Alright then. Just water for all of us," Draco waved for the server, and sent their orders away.
Work is as hectic as usual and we're still trying to pass the regulation banning creatures discrimination in the workplace. You'd think that people would aspire to be better, but alas, Barnabas cannot resist printing the rubbish he subsists on. I can only wish for Parkinson to dispose of him as soon as possible. Writing this has made me look forward to your party, if not just for a break. I'll catch up on sleep while the kids run about.
"Do you have acne somewhere where I don't know?"
"I'm glad that you were so easily satisfied," Harry rolled his eyes in disapproval as they made their way to the meeting room. "But honestly, thanking you was on today’s agenda. I should have done that earlier, but I went undercover again almost immediately," he shrugged.
"Well, Blaise was still having lunch when I left, and Slughorn doesn't care about seating, so this is my new seat." Harry shrugged with exaggerated ambivalence. He placed his copy of
He had completed his volunteer training on empathy and communication, and had been assigned to his first choice placement, patient and parent support. He had also met Jo, his fellow volunteer, and had learnt that as a first-timer, he had been incredibly lucky to have gotten a patient facing role. Draco had wondered futilely how he had impressed them, before deciding that he would work hard to assure them of their decision.
"That's too boring," Susan Bones complained even as she sat down with her Hufflepuff friends.
Draco considered his schedule. His latest batch of fairy wings had come in the day before, and he would finally have time to attempt brewing again. "After Andromeda's," he suggested. Baringstone would have returned with a draft by then.
Draco lamented the amount of time he now spent with Gryffindors. His playacting was no longer what it used to be. "I'll make you a proper suspicions form to frame your thought process one day." Draco said while keeping an eye on his cauldron.
"I definitely would notice if it's big enough."
Harry swung his legs from his perch on Malfoy's desk. Helping himself to another mouth of treacle tart, he watched Malfoy sort his parchment papers. He cut another bit and held it out for Malfoy.
With an eye roll, Draco combed his fringe backwards as casually as he could manage. He really should have spelled his hair in place before leaving his one night stand's house, but it was now too late. Trust Potter to always casually realign the world to thwart him. What were the chances that Draco would pick up a Muggle who lived beside Potter?
"What?" Ron demanded when both Draco and Harry looked at him sharply. "He looks awful! He's projecting the leave-me-alone aura!"
But it wasn’t like he could do anything, he was a
"And my name worked," Draco asked in disbelief.
Harry emptied his lungs with the deepest sigh he could manage, jumping at the stinging hex on the back of his hand. He frowned at the nonchalantly raised brow.
"I've genuinely never noticed," he frowned as he stroked his chin. "That's astute," he complimented Hermione evenly, "Harry, I'll protect you on Wednesday. Harry, Harry. Harry," he repeated as if testing it for a fit. He nodded after a while before looking expectantly at him.
Draco set his new batch of books from the library down in shock. He hadn't dared to hope that the Headmistress' kindness would extend to an opportunity to complete his NEWTs at Hogwarts. He thanked the elf quickly, tearing it open with uncharacteristic carelessness as he scanned through the letter.
"Thanks," he whispered to Malfoy, nudging the apple when Malfoy frowned at him, lips in a twisted sulk.
"Surely it can't be that bad," Malfoy said as he crossed his arms. "Is it a cock ring? A vibrator? No–you can't get a good vibrator with three galleons. A dildo then. No?" He sounded terribly disappointed at the prospect.
Teddy nodded solemnly. "Just one tiny cookie," he said as he squirmed in Draco's arms, looking to be released. Worry raised his hands in an 'X' to emphasise that it was untrue.
“It’s a good idea,” he defended with a laugh. “It’s hard to buy presents for so many people. I have the Weasleys—” he mimed losing count on his fingers in amusement, “Hermione and Ron, you...”
"Does Ron know how close they are?" Draco continued, his heart skipping a beat when Ron joined Pansy and Hermione's conversation. Weasley was sick and perverted, to be able to do this without an ounce of guilt.
"You're an arsehole," Potter scowled when his two feet were back on solid ground. "Just for that, you're going to run across the road with me."
"Anyway, please don't mention it to anyone else," he said to the room, trying his best to regard everyone for emphasis. He was grateful when they nodded. Spinning the bottle with a wave of his wand, it landed on the outspoken Ravenclaw Mandy Brocklehurst.
"Oh, you'll be alright. You get hit by Bludgers on the daily," Hermione said when Ginny continued to whine at Blaise.
"Desperate to be under my feet again?" Malfoy asked with as he tugged them on.
A floppy, big red ribbon is revealed to be tied into a beautiful bow around his cock. He reaches and pulls the end of the ribbon. It uravels smoothly, and falls silkily onto the floor.
Harry sat down awkwardly when Teddy left. He rewrapped the pot carefully for want of something to do, jumping when Malfoy spoke first.
"I have miscalculated; I have underestimated!" He threw his hands into the air as he stalked back to his bed and gathered his toiletries and pyjamas with a sharp flick of his wand.
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy's media representative requested for their clients' privacy, commenting that the duo were merely having a bit of sustenance. It is a timely reminder that even Harry Potter could possibly be as dull as you.
Maybe he should have talked Draco out of confronting Pansy. It was too late now; but Harry supposed that it was at least a consolation that Draco looked good while being eviscerated.
You are not supposed to hold that against me!! Yes, I'm already excited for next Wednesday. If Hogwarts doesn't work out, you can always be a chef. I should always be able to get a table because I’m Draco Malfoy. Apparently that’s worth a bit of salt these days. Funny.
"The worst." He agreed, heart fluttering in happiness in his chest.
Draco watched as Potter chewed on the corner of his bottom lip. Frankly, the short intervals between the occasions of close contact with Potter was alarming. Given the size of the English magical community and his cordial relationship with Hermione (Draco would even count her as a friend if he had adequate alcohol content in his bloodstream) it was obviously impractical to avoid Potter entirely, but the previous normal of once every quarter had somehow been upended since his last one night stand in February.
"Oi, I'm plenty formal!" Harry complained as he gave his outfit another once over. His work wear closet was updated regularly and most importantly, none of them had holes. In fact, the shirt he had on was collared, and his shoes were proper office wear type from Harrods! "You're just being discriminatory," he accused.
"Not only his friends. Malfoy's weird too," Ron snickered when he saw the curt reply with zero explanation.
"You know, I really thought that you were joking in Paris about owning one."
"Erm," Harry was shocked by the confrontation. He fidgeted nervously, his eyes darting between a furious Malfoy and the corridor that they could have been walking down together.
“Just a lunch, Potter? You’re filthy rich. Try again.”
"Why would you intentionally hurt yourself?" Harry's brows creased. "I should have done more instead of leaving you to fend the crazies off. I could have spoken up, called Hermione to make laws. You should have told me. I should have known."
"I'm so sorry, er," Potter said, his eyes frantic as the grip of his hand tightened. "I don't know what happened. Are you okay?" He asked as he helped Draco sit up carefully, a hand on the small of Draco's back.
"No, I need to follow up on this," Harry said as he raised a note.
—they were no more familiar than school rivals who were distantly related through a young boy that they both loved.
"What's wrong with you today, Potter? Why do you keep gaping at me? What do you want?" He demanded.
"You wouldn't have to worry about that," Harry said as he climbed into the bed. "Hermione told me that brown and black don't crack. As in, we don't age that quickly, you know? Whereas—" He looked at Draco skeptically.
- Attend conferences worldwide if possible
Potter's head whipped up as he blinked at Draco in shock. "That's a pretty good idea," he said, his eyes bright.
Picking up the booklet in search of an explanation, Draco paused at the title—"Love and Desire: The Cupid Manual".
“We’re thirty-one years old,” Harry reminded him reflexively, tucking his phone into his pocket. It was a statement that he always started his day with nowadays.
"Fuck off, Potter," Malfoy replied without looking up as his quill continued to move across his parchment.
Harry stewed in worry while his friends argued amongst themselves. What if Draco didn't want to talk to him after and they couldn't even have these awful squabbles anymore? It was unthinkably depressing.
"Can't believe that you really have my calendar," Harry suddenly said as he moved backwards to look at him. So they were now back on the topic, Draco sighed he clung to Potter, desperate to hide his face in embarrassment.
Harry looked at the food that he had already amassed on his plate. “I don’t really think that it’s a problem.”
"I think so, why?"
“Are you on your rounds? I’m still within curfew, I was just looking up books for our project, and I finally found something that would help with the problem,” he babbled, guiding her in the direction of their dorm as he held her by the elbow.
"That's a nice article," Hermione grinned as she nodded at the spread on his lap. "We helped with his points but it was entirely his idea.
Harry took in the homey layout with a frown. "Aren’t there enough flowers right outside her house?"
Draco checked him in the shoulder, the distance between them closing again as they stumbled against one another in laughter. A comfortable silence fell over them as they trudged along the path towards Hogsmeade, and Draco basked in the occasional brushes of their hands, glad that Harry had spoken to him immediately yesterday without mentioning anything about his odd behaviour.
, a small voice within himself reminded him.
“It’s faster this way, don’t you think? We’d be done with practice in no time,” Draco called over the volume, laughing at the fog that had begun to envelop him. Dismissing it, he hurriedly waved away the silenced tornado headed his direction.
you find out though," he said evenly as he cleared his nose with false airiness.
3 December 2012
Speeding through the pages, he tugged the drawstring bag open and poured out its contents, shoulders slumping at the tiny gold, and lead arrows.
Now that they were alone once more, Pansy quickly crossed the distance between herself and her boyfriend before sealing their mouths upon each other’s. Draco sighed to himself as he caught Greg's eye. Pansy and Blaise complemented each other in their sexual insatiability, and they could often spend minutes kissing in a prolonged public foreplay that left both Greg and him to their own devices. Conversations had died abruptly, and dinners had been cancelled after everyone else had arrived all because of their spontaneous physical engagements. It was bloody annoying to say the least.
He crept towards the study room, ears pricked and wand in hand.
for him, and then he would not have to find ways to cover his tracks.
Yours sincerely
Nonetheless, everything’s good now. You’ve been cleared, and the manual will help.
"If you stayed long enough, you probably did. You're a proper wanker," Draco said as he narrowed his eyes at him in consideration.
, he griped as he collected the mess of his clothes on the floor. He had always been mocked by his friends for his preference in brunettes, and it had only gotten worse since the release of Potter's sexy calendar. Draco started to exclusively fuck dark haired Muggles to satiate his horniness, and his body count was getting a bit ridiculous for a Healer swarmed with cases. Taking one last look at the expanse of muscles on the bed, Draco made a face to himself at the thick mop of black hair before leaving the room.
Draco kicked him on his shin reflexively before shooting him an apologetic look. "How did you even find it? How did you break in?"
"No! Apart from Saturday! Like Friday or whatever!" Harry said in frustration, desperately controlling the urge to shake Draco.
"Yours would be more sensible," Draco said with forced casualness, grateful for Harry's effusiveness. He didn't know how Pansy and Theo managed to keep their relationship alive with all the second guessing to save face.
"Draco, please," he begged, gasping when he felt Draco's hand over his briefs–the furthest that they had gone. Harry summoned the lube wandlessly and he reached into Draco's underwear to slick the warm length of Draco's cock.
Hogwarts is an esteemed institution and you are
Draco
"After you," Harry beckoned as he waved a charm to secure their possessions until they returned.
"Draco!" Teddy exclaimed when he noticed Draco at the doorway. Dropping the half-eaten cookie in his hand, he ran towards Draco in excitement, his hair a sandy brown with dark brown spots the colour of chocolate chips.
"Why would he think that it was just foreplay when you're this sweaty?" Harry asked suddenly as he jabbed his broom sharply against Draco's arse.
Draco felt his heart calm as he processed the information. Nobody else knew about Severus’ spell; he would be fine.
Do return if 12 noon is good for you.
"Don't," Harry said when Draco pulled out a fresh pair of pants. He looked at Harry with furrowed brows. "It's easier access without pants," Harry explained.
Listening to the rustle of parchment, Harry curled his legs as he looked at the neat slope of Draco's hair at the back of his head. He curled his fingers as he desperately resisted the urge to comb through and trail his hand down the slope of Draco's neck.
"Great choice, Mr Lupin," Draco agreed playfully as he jotted both their preferences on the slip of paper on the table. "What about you, Potter?" Draco looked up in question, his hand jumping at the intensity in Potter's eyes. Desperate to cover his reaction, Draco fussed over his cousin's colouring book as he tried to collect himself. The fact that he was seated opposite Potter in a Chinese restaurant was simply bizarre. He had tried to block out Potter's proximity in Mungo's and on their journey to the restaurant but now that they were without the stimulation of strangers and passers-by, it was sinking in that he, Draco Malfoy, was having the beginnings of a pleasant meal with his childhood nemesis, wank fantasy, trigger for the realisation of his sexual preference, favourite professional quidditch player, preferred calendar model and the reason for his chronic one night stands, failed blind dates and persistent singlehood, Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world himself.
Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley were awarded Orders of Merlin, First Class for their selfless heroism during the second world war. During the Fall of the Ministry, businesses were shuttered and propaganda was rife. People lived in fear that their friends and family would disappear without a trace in the actions of the Ministry or You-know-who. Harry Potter and his friends were on the run for half a year. I asked if it felt like he was being persecuted all over again.
He spooned another serving for Malfoy in wordless comfort. Dinner had been rushed under Malfoy's strict studying schedule, and Harry had privately shed a tear in gratitude when he had unwrapped the treacle tart on his bed.
Harry gaped at both the statement and the obvious lack of concern.
18 August 2012
The hall was silent as the Headmistress looked at her students heavily.
Draco felt his heart squeeze at the sight of Harry's solid presence. It was ridiculous how quickly Harry became his strength, the indomitable presence that he could hold on to when anything went wrong. He felt himself tear up again, his feet heavy, ashamed of breaking down before Ron. How could he call Harry over for a few moments? Draco was trembling with dejection when the door to Diagon Alley suddenly slammed open. In that instant before he turned around to follow the noise, Harry's eyes met his, his shoulders straightening as he stood up. A dark-haired lady rushed into the pub, her wand held high as she surveyed the interior.
Harry rolled his eyes as he pushed Draco’s hand away. He needed to focus, not be manipulated by his soulmate. “Not if I strangle you first for holding your soulmark against me all the time.”
"No," Harry said as he reached for his wand, while Ron replied, "Yes, like death warmed over."
"I do not, Potter! I teach them with a firm hand!" he punctuated with jabs to Harry's curled palm. "You wouldn't know natural magnetism even if it hit you," he yelped when Harry grabbed the index finger.
later, if not forever.
- Ron
“I got a paper cut yesterday,” Malfoy said, his eyes bright with amusement as he handed the extra fork to his friend.
Draco rolled his eyes disbelievingly. "Merlin, she really doesn't quit, does she? You were literally training to be an Auror when she was being born. I mean-"
“It was good. Beats studying,” he said, his tone teasing.
"Okay," Malfoy replied without looking at him, curled into a foetal position in the bed.
Draco hiked his bag higher, his mood foul, his lips in a thin line. He nodded stiffly at Madam Pince on his way out of the library. His day had been absolutely rotten, and what he needed was a bit of coddling and heaps of sympathy. He wondered if Pansy would be around for once, or would he have to spend the night alone in the common room? He wanted to put off returning to his bed as long as possible, having spent the previous night obsessively scrutinizing every line in his manual and rereading the letters from his cousin in the hope that it would help. Even if he could resist the urge to do the same today, the blank report that appeared by his pillow was a glaring reminder that he hadn’t done anything about the situation yet.
"How did you even get books that cheap?”
The judgement in Harry's face evaporated immediately as it was replaced with what Draco had always feared—horror. He swiped at his stubborn tears furiously as he pushed Harry's hand away.
Hermione saw the opportunity and had taken it. By the morning, a motion was passed with near-unanimous support that Pansy, nor (pre-emptively) the Hufflepuffs in collective would be allowed to organise any subsequent eighth year parties.
Draco and his elves had removed as many of the Dark curses as they could, and had sent the furniture into storage, recycling other sets from past Malfoys. When his mother was finally released (due to Potter's testimony), Draco was simultaneously eased by her return, yet ashamed by the little progress he had made in rehabilitating his birth home.
"Is it not the same for you?"
“No!” Draco yelled as he pushed his wrist away, “don’t,” he continued, crying harder when Harry frowned at him in confusion. “Please, don’t,” he blubbered when Harry made to swipe them off the bed. Harry instead lifted and set them to his bedside table in frustration as he held Draco tightly.
"No, not really," Zabini replied with a wide smile as he leaned backwards in his seat. "We were just talking about how your Patronus woke Pansy up. It's a bit rude to be talking about you in your presence, so we stopped."
"Draco, truth or dare?" Pansy called out in a simpering voice.
"Zabini! I'm your Secret Santa!" Seamus called out randomly as he waved at the group of Slytherins in the corner of the Eighth Year students' dorm.
"Teddy, Draco's house is really big. We can spread out just a little. Maybe I can go here?" He pointed to the branch by the side.
"It's fine," Malfoy replied as he sent his toiletries, dirty clothes and cosmetic products away before sitting down at his desk with a sigh.
4. Punctual
“It wasn’t. I learned it from Mother,” Draco said, checking the book that they had tossed a distance away when their duel had become serious.
have civilised conversations. Malfoy and him communicated only through sarcasm, fits of rage, or with their limbs. The suggestions to talk to Malfoy, or give him nice things, was insensitive and upsetting.
Harry sneered when Draco smirked at him in challenge. He would plan a date so good that Draco wouldn't know what hit him.
After the war when he had spent more time with Ginny, he had started to question his disinterest in taking things further. It was then that he had discovered that he preferred males to females. He was grateful that Ginny had taken it in stride, and that his friends and family were supportive. The realisation did not affect him much either–he would occasionally appreciate certain features, or gestures, and in the rare moments he would marvel at the subtlety of his observations, understanding why his sexuality had eluded him for years. Otherwise, the moments would slip away as quickly as it came.
Draco froze at the flash of fancy. His mind was no longer his, desperate to act on his basic instincts to claim Harry.
"No," Malfoy snapped, voice ripe with annoyance. He suddenly whipped around, causing Harry to stumble over his feet to avoid colliding into him.
