‘I’m fine.’ He hated lying to Ginny, but the truth would be worse. ‘Just tired—it was a big job today.’
‘Did you have a lot of nightmares?’ Harry asked, aware that he was prying but unable to bring himself to care.
‘Fine,’ Draco said, in a decisive tone, ‘we’ll go together then.’ And then, as though they hadn’t just decided to do something crazy and potentially friendship ruining, Draco turned and went back to work without another word.
Harry woke up on his final day in St Mungo’s with a heavy heart. The day before, when Esther had given him his final dose of Skele-Gro, and Malfoy had confirmed that he would be free to go the next day, Harry’s heart had sunk. Usually, he was desperate to get out of the hospital. He should be excited to start training again, get back to his real life. But that real life didn’t include Malfoy, and he wasn’t ready to say goodbye.
Tickets finally purchased, they filed into the cinema, finding their seats in the dim light. Draco had assumed that Teddy would sit in between the two of them, but he insisted that the seat on the end of the three they had selected was the best placed, and he absolutely would not sit anywhere else. Doing as they were told, Harry and Draco settled in the remaining two seats, Harry next to Teddy and Draco on the end. The lights dimmed further as they sat down, and the trailers began to play on the screen. Teddy was immediately entranced, his expression comical with his wide eyes and open mouth. The trailers managed to hold Draco’s attention for a while, soaking up the details of Muggle life that he saw depicted in the adverts and film trailers. But then Harry moved slightly, and Draco lost all interest in what was happening on the screen.
The bath is helping though. He’d made a beeline for the bathroom as soon as he got home, dropping his bag in the hall and stripping off his clothes as he went, desperate to sink his sore muscles into the soothing water. He’s never found anything else -- magic or otherwise -- that soothes a tired body in quite the same way.
Pain shot through Harry’s hip as he moved, and the gasp he let out seemed to shock them both out of the trance they’d been in. Malfoy took a step back, concern creasing his face as Harry slumped back against the wall.
‘Touch yourself, Harry,’ Draco urged, his voice tight with need. Harry opened his eyes and twisted slightly to see that Draco was stroking his own cock rapidly, even as he continued to lick Harry. The sight had Harry’s hand flying to his own cock, chasing the orgasm he could feel building. Knowing that Draco was so turned on by this that he was wanking himself only made Harry’s climax approach even faster.
‘I think that might be the longest I’ve sat still in years,’ Harry added as they continued to shuffle down the corridor.
‘That’s good, very good,’ Malfoy said, nodding to himself. ‘I’ll need to give it a proper examination but we should be able to start exercising it tomorrow.’
‘I want another Healer,’ Harry said determinedly. A flush of embarrassment raced through him when Malfoy just looked at him dispassionately, one eyebrow slightly raised.
‘Well I definitely don’t want it. Go find another whore to give it to if you need to get rid of it that badly.’
Harry opened his mouth to respond, though he didn’t yet know with what - he was hoping the right words would come to him if he started speaking - but was spared by a purple memo flying in to the office and hitting him squarely in the face. All thoughts of the Yule Ball vanished from Harry’s mind as he hurriedly tore open the memo, hoping that it might contain the information needed to solve the case, and even Draco perked up, the frown disappearing from his face as he moved to read the memo over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry stood and watched while Malfoy cast a series of spells at the jewellery box, content to let Malfoy work without getting involved, the pain still too fresh in his mind to make him want to get any nearer to the jewellery box than he had to.
But soon their hips are grinding together, Harry’s cock a hard line against Draco’s, and Draco needs more. He wants to have sex with Harry properly, knowing that it’s because they desperately want each other rather than because of any money or obligation. He breaks their kiss, thrilling at the moan of loss that escapes Harry.
He’d often wondered what it would be like to see Harry again, after so many years and so much complicated history, but in those imagined scenarios he’d always dealt with it much more smoothly than this, showing Harry how wonderful his life had become rather than collapsing into a state of nervous exhaustion the minute his back was turned. He’d never expected that he’d still react so viscerally just to Harry’s presence, and he hadn’t been able to predict the make over that made it all so much worse. He certainly hadn’t thought that five minutes spent in the same room as Harry would make the crush he’d secretly harboured throughout his teenage years come roaring back with such ferocity.
Harry was laser-focused now; nothing but the Snitch mattered. Even Thorebourne faded into irrelevance as Harry twisted and turned in his endless pursuit of the tiny golden ball. He barely noticed they were climbing again, or how close they flew to the Bats’ goalposts, the roar of the crowd muted beneath the sound of his own frantic heartbeat. He was so intent on the Snitch that he didn’t notice the Bludger flying towards him.
Harry’s never heard Draco sound like that before, and the need in his voice sends such a heady rush of lust through Harry that he thinks he could come, there and then, completely untouched. Harry decides he’s teased Draco enough, at least for now, and takes him into his mouth fully, tongue swirling as he begins to move up and down, his hand moving in time with his mouth. Draco’s hand sliding into his hair, tugging ever so slightly, has Harry moaning around Draco’s dick and reaching down to undo his own trousers, desperately needing to touch himself.
The Magpies’ Seeker was hot on his tail, and the teams were only twenty points apart, so Harry had no room for error if Puddlemere were to win the League. The team had worked so hard all season to get to this point, and there was no way he was going to mess it up for them by fumbling this chase. The Snitch was several arm lengths away, speeding upwards, right through the middle of the Chasers who were still trying to score goals. Determined not to let it get away, Harry bent low over his broom, bracing in anticipation of a flare of pain in his hip that never came. It was his fourth match back from his injury, and he was relieved that just when it mattered most, his recovery seemed to be complete.
It’s the sort of decision that would have been easy, had Harry only had to think about himself. He could have taken the chance to live out a fantasy with the added benefit of curing himself of the curse, without a second thought for what it meant, or what it would do to anyone else. But he wasn’t alone, not anymore, and he had Ginny to think about. He couldn’t be responsible for any more loss in her life, and he hated the thought of dying and leaving her without him, but he’d also made a vow to be faithful to her, and he’d fully intended to stick to that vow.
‘You’re welcome,’ Malfoy said, before adding, his tone slightly uncertain ‘I, ah, thought it would be best for both of us if no one looked too closely at what happened that day.’
Draco could feel his temper rising—he might not spend much time with his cousin, but he knew for a fact that Andromeda had never for a moment felt like Teddy’s presence in her life was a burden, however naughty he might be. The fact that Narcissa was stooping so low as to say something like that in an attempt to manipulate him into teaching Teddy pure-blood customs made his blood boil.
‘Yeah, he was,’ Harry agreed, ‘but he says he can get me flying sooner than anyone else and Oliver’ll kill me if I’m out for too long.’
It would be a shame for Draco not to go to the ball - he loved them, and usually spent the weeks running up to it boring Harry to death with talk about the guest list and what he was going to wear, and although Harry didn’t always go, when he had, Draco had always been the life and soul of the party, chatting to anyone and everyone and stealing the spotlight on the dancefloor. Why should his shitty ex get to deprive him of that? And then, as Harry lay in bed, remembering how dejected Draco had looked as he read the invitation, Harry had an idea.
Draco chatted away about the weather, the cold and the early sunsets as Harry walked in to the back room, letting Draco’s comments wash over him as he looked round, taking in the shop. The front room was lined with clothes rails, displaying a huge range of clothing, from formal robes and dresses to warm looking tailored coats and some tiny children’s outfits in the softest, brightest fabric. The backroom was a different story. Clearly this was where the bespoke pieces were created. Large mirrors lined three of the walls, with the fourth covered in shelves containing more fabric than Harry had ever seen in his life. There were so many colours, some shimmering with a faint glow of magic, and so many textures, Harry’s fingers itching to run across them to see if they felt as wonderful as they looked. But before he could go over and explore, a voice broke him out of his contemplation of the shelves.
‘Oh, Draco.’ And then Pansy is beside him on the sofa, pulling him into her arms, and it’s everything Draco’s been needing. He’s used to bottling up his feelings, burying them deep down, but it’s a relief to have said it aloud, and he finds that his eyes are damp and he’s trembling as Pansy strokes his back.
The office was quiet, only the scratching of Draco’s quill on his parchment disturbing the silence. Harry was staring intently at a case file, forehead scrunched up as he tried to figure out what the evidence they had collected so far might mean. He’d been stuck on the case for days, and it was starting to drive him slightly mad - nothing added up, and he was no closer to solving it than he had been the day it landed on his desk.
‘Anyway,’ Pansy continues, disrupting his thoughts. ‘It doesn’t really matter—I’ve spoken to Manon.’
‘Don’t push your luck,’ Draco replies, but there’s a smile in his voice and his hand leaves Harry’s hair, trailing down his chest instead, pausing only to circle Harry’s nipple before continuing its journey down.
All of a sudden, the pain receded, reducing to a burn under his skin rather than outright agony. Harry looked up, confused, and found himself looking directly into Malfoy’s grey eyes. Malfoy’s hand was on Harry’s arm, and the touch felt like a balm, the place where their skin met the only part of his body that didn’t hurt.
As Harry looked up at Malfoy—his cheekbones as razor-sharp as they had been at school, his hair still just as blond, although less severely slicked back—Harry was reminded of the public outcry that had accompanied his appointment at St Mungo’s several years ago. For weeks the
‘Yes, I was supposed to get married here. I was supposed to do a lot of things, supposed to follow all the rules my mother wants me to teach Teddy, and yes, that would be one of them. Maybe even the most important one.’
Once they were out on the pavement outside the cinema, stood slightly to one side to allow the stream of other customers to hurry past, they paused. Harry turned to look at Draco, uncertainty written across every line of his face. This was usually the moment when they parted ways, one of them—usually Harry—dropped Teddy back at Andromeda's while the other headed home. But Draco didn't want to go home. Didn't want this to be over yet, afraid that leaving would break the spell that had fallen over them in the hush of the cinema.
Harry smirked knowingly, "Don't let my appearances fool you. I was so excited that day I'd been awake long before dawn. I was pacing back and forth everywhere until Severus told me to go out into the garden and he would call me in when you had arrived, but then you and your parents went to take a nap and I didn't see you until later that day. You had honestly looked so handsome," he stated as he looked over at Draco who, although travel-weary with bloodshot eyes, still sent the blood pumping through his veins. He let his mind wander momentarily back to that summer when Draco had followed his parents into the conservatory; he had looked immaculate as ever, like the night they had first met in the hotel function room in Paris, and although he looked a little thinner than beforehand, Harry couldn't help but smile as wide as he had.
The words had dropped through the air like rocks into a well. The image of Harry's broken body in his arms whilst they both sank to the hardwood floor -tears trickling from their eyes -was forever engraved into his mind. It broke his heart, that day, to know that he was powerless to mend Harry's pain. He should have been able to do something -anything to make it better. But there was nothing he could do, except eventually help Harry summon enough strength to travel to the hospital to talk further about the diagnosis.
Harry gave a small airy laugh and stroked his fingers along Draco's arm, smoothing down the baby-fine blond hairs on the blond skin. He tilted his head to one side and smiled lazily as Draco's fringe tickled his forehead. He reached up to stroke a finger down Draco's nose and grimaced as his forearm came into contact with the drying trail of cum on his chest. "Goddamnit! I might as well go and clean up before we get into cuddling,"
Over the coming months Harry noticed that he was getting premature silvery threads throughout his black hair and it worried him even further when he realised just how unbelievably stressed that he was becoming, and it was only the end of April. He still had two full months of studying before his exams. He needn't be so worried and yet he couldn't convince his mind to shut down and relax each night before he went to sleep. The only things that had been breaking his studying up throughout the last two weeks were the letters he had received from Draco throughout their mutual correspondence. It was harder to bicker through letters so Harry felt that they had a stroke of luck in this means of communication. Anything else and he would have feared that his friendship with Draco would have hit a wrong note and been terminated before it had even properly begun. Alas, that was not the case.
They had spent the entire night sitting in their nightshirts in separate armchairs by the fireplace and spoke in hushed voices, having to lean closer together to hear the other over the soft crackling of the fire. It had been a relatively calm evening, even as the dawn had tickled at the edges of the earth and teased the sky lighter and lighter. They must have drifted off at some point because when the first twitters of the birds sung out across the sky; Draco had removed himself from the armchair, stretched his aching muscles and then grasped the head of his cane before heading for the door. Harry had followed and before he left to get a few hours of proper sleep, Draco had lowered himself against Harry and pressed their mouths together in a much stronger kiss than the evening before.
Harry smiled as he opened the book and flipped through to the column of photo's used for a bookmark, "it does get pretty boring here" he smiled as he slipped the column of photos out and replaced a piece of tissue as the bookmark. "I like these photo's" he smiled, "it was a beautiful weekend."
Blaise shrugged as he checked the list in his hand and held his wand a little higher, the bleak light from the tip of his wand making the labels glow. He needed the ingredients or the first steps before they were to leave the potion to sit and stew for about a week. It may not be worth it in the long run, but to see the blonde's old obsession reawaken if only for a short period of time would make it all feel like the good old days; before the war, before the bloodshed ... Before the beginning of the nightmares. There was a lot that could go wrong, he knew that, but he reasoned that it was worth a shot.
Harry was panting heavily, his mouth contorted into a half-grin as he wiped a hand across his sweaty forehead. He inhaled a few times through his nose, to calm his breathing. Draco shuffled over on the mattress and draped an arm over the top of Harry's chest, as far from the drying cum as possible, his neck buried into the sweaty, hot skin of his lover's neck. "Merlin, Harry you always take my breath away," he purred silkily and pressed his lips against Harry's pulse-point. He smirked as a shiver ran down the younger mans' body.
Harry had scanned his eyes to see if this was a joke. He knew deep down that it was not but he had still done it until he was one hundred percent positive. "So ... we're getting a puppy?"
Harry sighed and then pinched the bridge of his nose, "I know I'm sorry," he breathed, "It's just so suffocating being trapped in this room all the time. You got better a week ago I just don't understand why we can't even go out in the manor gardens and walk about in the fresh air. You need fresh air, as much as you can get of it before the winter months set in."
With a hesitant hand, Harry reached out for it. "Alright, I'll make sure he takes it." He slipped the phial into his pocket, a chill running down his spine that he reasoned was from the cold air outside the double doors.
The dark-skinned boy grumbled in reply before frowning, "Where is Draco tonight anyway? I thought he would have been here by now." He glanced over at the doors to the hall but most students were already seated and eating away, completely oblivious to the lack of blonde hair.
Draco felt his nose grow hot and tingle as the promise of tears grew ever stronger in his eyes. He felt a large pearl cascade down his cheek and watched as Harry's eyes followed it down to the base of his throat. He sniffed loudly. Harry looked momentarily shocked before he reached up with heavy arms and cupped both of Draco's cheeks in his hands, his thumb wiping away the smooth tear-track from Draco's cheek. "There," he smiled, his thumb continuing to stroke Draco's baby-soft skin, "still as beautiful as ever."
The Piers had taken all afternoon, so that by the time they were returning to the hotel to change clothes, the sun was already setting.
Harry could have taken it as an insult, because in a way it was, but he knew what was at stake. He had felt hollow until Severus' words had washed through him, the thought of the beautiful blonde man who had his heart, lying in a bed somewhere in Paris, awake and recovering and
Draco felt his lips curled into a sneer, "I think your teacher is looking for you, Potter," he sneered as he turned away and took another flute of champagne from the bar and then disappeared into the numerous black robes of the mass crowd that were milling around inside the function room. Harry was suddenly no longer in the mood to talk to anyone and was all too happy when Snape found him, followed by Ronald and Dennis and then escorted them back out to the main lobby where they gathered their travelling cloaks and out into the balmy night and back towards their own hotel a few blocks. No one spoke on the way back, not even Dennis who was the chirpiest one out of all of them.
There was a moment of silence before Severus spoke up, "He was taken to St. Michaels in Paris. It was touch and go for a little while and his heart stopped twice but he managed to choke up half the lake and according to the letter we received this morning, he is now stabilized and eating a little."
Malfoy spun around on his knees, his tear-stained red face contorted into one of anger at being caught in such a vulnerable manner. He gritted his teeth together and drew out his wand and aimed it right at Harry's heart. Harry whipped out his own wand and aimed it right back at Draco, although he forced himself to remember only protection spells. He took a step closer, noticing how much Draco was shaking now and how tired the boy looked. "I'm not here to fight you, Malfoy," he stated in a tight voice. He was trying his best to remain calm but Damnit if Malfoy didn't always make him feel like a little kid.
Harry nodded with a smile, "sure there's fish-and-chips or fish-and-chips," he chuckled to himself as they passed a small smoothie stand on their corner. They walked over the huge road and stepped down onto the beach, the dry sand tickling their ankles as they walked. "I've missed the sun," Harry grinned as Seeker bounded around their legs, running ahead and sending sand clouds flying high. Draco laced their fingers together and smiled softly as they walked. The sun did feel good on his skin, but what he really wanted was a lovely shower. He felt so grubby from the long, sweaty car ride. Harry suddenly stopped and tugged Draco to a standstill beside him. Draco frowned down at him and was about to open his mouth to question the sudden halt when Harry tiptoed up and pressed his mouth against Draco's. It was a shy, tender kiss with all the familiarity and warmth of a life-long-love.
As soon as they'd been allowed to go about their own way in the summer house, Harry had offered to take his trunk upstairs along with Draco's and instead of leaving after he'd finished, he pulled a chair out onto the small balcony that overlooked one shore of the lake and slumped down into it. The sun burned his eyes and his skin and the buzzing of the insects magnified in his ears and everything seemed to warp in his vision. He pressed the heels of his hands against his temples and squeezed his eyes shut tightly until all he could hear was the rush of his own blood.
"He also helped spare our lives," Hermione snapped out, "That should count for something!" without another word she stood up from the table and threw her book into her bag before slinging it over her shoulder and storming past Ron, who was coming in late from his lesson, and out of the Great Hall. Harry ushered Ginny to sit back down as he clambered out of his own seat.
Later that evening, locked away in his bedchamber and after pacing back and forth about how detailed he needed to make the list for Severus, the man's words had echoed in his head, making his heart race and his mind run blank with explanations, despite his godfather being pretty clear on things. He knew, there was no doubt about it. Although if it did have to be anyone of his social circle to find out, he was glad that it was Severus. The man had been alone almost all his life, he surely must know what it was like when you found someone to love and who loved you back? Or at the very least, what you'd considered love at one point and was now just a happy memory locked away in the back of his mind. He threw a glare down at the parchment and quill lying on his desk. He'd touched them, various ink splotches were proof of that, but he had yet to write down the things that had been bothering him about Harry. All the other things were scribbled down, it wasn't too difficult. Except for Harry –Harry made everything difficult.
"What do you get scared of, Harry?" the blonde man breathed gently as he splayed his hand over the naked, tan chest beneath him. A small part of him at the back of his mind told him that he didn't want to know and that he should be afraid of the answer, but he berated himself and told him that he was nearly fifty for goodness sake, if he kept running from things all his life he wouldn't get anywhere.
Draco smirked down at him, "We haven't done that in years, Harry. Do you suddenly feel the urge to rub up against me all night long?" he purred silkily as he leaned over Harry and pressed their mouths together. "I do love you, you know?" he murmured gently.
Draco huffed, not even having the energy to roll his eyes. "You said ... no magic ... so you're ... cleaning up." Harry's jaw dropped. Draco smirked, smacking his wet thigh with his limp hand. "Get to it."
Draco waved his hand, "Nonsense. If you'll allow me I'm sure there is something of mine that would fit you. I haven't cleared out any of my smaller robes, so I am sure one of them would fit you perfectly."
Harry looked down at their entwined fingers and then up at the warm smoky grey eyes that were boring down into his own. The proximity and his gaze combined made Harry suddenly feel exposed and vulnerable, almost the same way Draco was when he was bared and naked for Harry to examine him. He swallowed past the lump in his throat. A shadow passed over the sun and a cool breeze made Harry shiver, unintentionally leaning closer to the blonde. "D-Draco …"
Harry could not remember the last time that the bathroom felt so far away from their living room -it was as though the hallway had been elongated to make him suffer. He winced as his wavering legs moved one in front of the other, Draco steadied him whenever he strayed from the general pathway, but nothing he could do could make Harry feel so -dependant.
Draco hummed, "That's not what I meant. I meant that at the age of seventeen you were ready to give up possibly the best years of your life and just die like that. For a world who, for the most part, have slandered you and your life."
He had wanted to bring Seeker along after their morning walk, but he had decided against it and had returned home to lock the sorrowful brown eyes behind the familiar blue door.
She shrugged again, "Well it's you and Potter. You'd be the talk of gossip, either way. So, yeah go for it. Why not?"
Harry shook his head before giving a stiff laugh. "How can I? Even if I told you, you would judge me nine ways to Sunday. It's a lot more darker than just not seeing the point of life anymore. Because I don't, Draco, and that scares me. If I don't see the point in life then how am I supposed to get through the next -Oh, I don't know -the next sixty odd years of my life finding everything tedious and menial? No one can physically live like that and be happy with it."
Draco chuckled to himself before turning on the T.V. flicking through the channels, and then handed the remote over to Harry. "You enjoy the soup; I'm going to run you a bath."
Draco snorted as he took a sip of his pumpkin juice. Narcissa seemed to ignore him but Severus had been scrutinizing the both of them since Friday night when they had both arrived. He knew that something was going on between them, and he'd be damned if he wasn't going to get to the bottom of it. He cleared his throat and in his usual lazy drawl, addressed Harry. "Forgive me, Harry, but August is rarely the time for such things. Usually such madness occurs in October but rarely earlier. I'm sure you can spare a week or two to relax and decompress your mind. I know I needed some time to myself. You look as though you're about to faint. You clearly haven't been resting and by the looks of it Draco could be on the verge of an illness very soon," his words may have been slow and drawn out on purpose, but the gasp and widening of Narcissa's eyes happened instantly.
Harry nodded his head with a small smile as he stepped onto the polished marble tiles and trailed after the maid to the drawing room. The décor was just as beautiful as the hotel where the functions were being held. The tapestries were intricately woven and vast as they hung on the walls and the paintings of the families predecessors were breath-taking, if a little dark in the wide, somewhat gloomy room. If it hadn't been for the sunlight then the place would look rather bleak and miserable. The young maid cleared her throat and the two blonde heads looked up towards the door. Harry felt his cheeks heat up a little. Lucius inclined his head and beckoned him forward, whereas Draco puffed his chest out a little bit. Harry advanced into the room and stood on ceremony beside Lucius and Draco's chair, not entirely sure of what to do with himself. Lucius stood up and then waved Harry down into his chair. "Do sit, Mister Potter, I have business to attend to elsewhere. I daresay you brought some material to read to my son, have you not?"
Within another five minutes the food had been dished out onto plates and shared evenly between himself and Harry.
To say that nobody recognised Harry in the fine altered robes was an understatement. Lucius was able to hide most of his surprise except for in his eyes, so much like Draco's own, only a fraction colder, whereas Draco's were like warm mercury. Harry flushed a little as his slick backed hair actually stayed in its styled position, with the new scented wax that Draco had offered him earlier. He felt far too inferior compared to the rest of them and felt as though he was playing dress-up but he didn't voice any of these thoughts as he was invited to dine with the Malfoy's –the first time that Harry had met Narcissa Malfoy or even heard her name mentioned –before they set off in the large coach to the hotel where they stripped their travelling cloaks and walked into the function room where much the same people were there, including a flock of new people who may have heard all the commotion about the enthralling topics to be discussed, and couldn't pass up the chance to wag their own tongues and offering their personal opinions.
Far too quickly Draco felt his orgasm building, even as he tried desperately to hold it off, not wanting this to be over so soon. It must have shown on his face though, as Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock and began to stroke in time with his thrusts. Draco was done for. He couldn’t do anything but fall apart, coming over Harry’s hand and chest, his legs shaking as he groaned. Harry was coming too, and Draco leant down to kiss him, trying to pour all his unsaid feelings about Harry and this moment into the kiss.
‘Andromeda mentioned that he’s started displaying signs of accidental magic,’ Narcissa said, her tone light, as though this was just another piece of idle chit chat. Draco knew better though, years of experience teaching him that his mother was skilled at lulling people into a false sense of security before revealing the main point of the conversation.
,’ he said, making the wand movement that became so familiar over that year. With a jolt of surprise, he felt a wisp escape from his wand, an indistinct shape but clearly
‘You’ve been talking to Manon about me?’ Draco doesn’t know whether to be shocked that Pansy and the woman who books his appointments are apparently in contact or annoyed that they’ve been talking about him behind his back.
‘Oh.’ Draco had assumed Harry knew, and he didn’t much fancy trying to explain what he was doing. Harry was sure to jump to the worst conclusions and assume that Draco was trying to indoctrinate Teddy into hatred. ‘I have to teach him about pure-blood history. It’s a kind of rite of passage of growing up, but I’m trying to teach him differently to how I was taught.’
But the thought vanishes as Potter picks up his pace, rendering Draco incapable of doing anything but feeling. His breath is fogging up the glass, his hands slipping as he gets hot and sweaty, and it’s absolutely perfect. Potter’s broader than Draco is, his body enveloping Draco’s, and Draco feels completely surrounded by Potter.
He heard someone, a Healer, he assumed, move closer to his bed, the sound of their footsteps loud in the otherwise quiet room. The last thing Harry wanted to do was open his eyes, past experience making him well aware that the lights would make his head hurt even more than it already did, but he also wanted to get out of here as soon as possible. He knew that the longer he pretended not to be awake, the longer they’d keep him. His head screamed in agony as he tentatively opened one eye, squinting against the lights. The shock of the sudden brightness prevented him from seeing anything in the room, glowing spots of colour blooming before his eyes instead.
‘What’re you reading this for?’ Ron said. ‘You’re a genius, but I think fixing broken bones might be beyond even you.’
The power of Harry's Apparition combined with his hand in Draco's left Draco reeling when they arrived, the adjustment to a new location taking longer than usual. They'd appeared in a tucked away side street, lined with terraced houses. It felt worlds away from the hustle and bustle of London, even though Draco knew they hadn't left the city. As Draco looked up and down the street, curious to see where Harry had chosen to live, Harry's house appeared from between two others. An eggshell blue front door contrasted with the brick walls of the three storey house, and two Laurel bushes stood either side of the three steps that led to the door. Draco followed Harry and Teddy into the house, shivering as the wards washed over him and drinking in every detail as Harry led them down the hall, pointing out various rooms as they walked. Teddy ran ahead into the living room, jumping on to a comfortable looking sofa and immediately reaching for the TV controller. Clearly he was very familiar with Harry's house, and Draco wondered just how often Teddy stayed here. They left Teddy in the living room, the TV already blaring music, and Harry showed Draco into the kitchen, promising cups of tea and biscuits.
Draco hesitated, a pit of dread forming in his stomach. He’d never been able to cast a Patronus. He’d tried, so many times, especially in that horrible year when Voldemort and his followers stalked the halls of the Manor, despair seeping into every pore of Draco’s being. He’d wanted nothing more than a beacon of hope, of comfort, of
‘It’s all the magic in the air,’ Draco explained. ‘It makes everything so much more powerful, every spell stronger, more impressive.’
‘I want to see you,’ Potter pants, before flipping Draco over, slipping one of Draco’s legs over his shoulder and pushing back in again.
‘Days?’ Harry couldn’t stay here for days. He hated being in hospital, and he had training to get back to. Even more than that, he definitely couldn’t spend days here being treated by Malfoy. While Malfoy appeared to have no problem acting as though Harry was any other patient, there was no way Harry could pretend that Malfoy was just another Healer, that there was no history of bloody hatred between them.
‘I know.’ Draco sits back on his thighs, smirking up at Potter, remembering all the times he’d provoked Potter with a similar expression back when they were younger. He never would have expected to be in this position years later, but he’s momentarily pleased that he spent so many years goading Potter—he knows exactly how to push his buttons, and that’s useful information to him right now.
‘Oh, yeah, fine,’ Harry said, a beat too late. Ginny had been cooking—the kitchen smelled of her signature bolognese and wisps of hair that had fallen out of her ponytail were curling from the steam coming from the bubbling pan. ‘I’m going to shower,’ Harry blurted out, the need to get out of the kitchen, to run away overpowering him. ‘Curse residue, you know,’ he added over his shoulder as he dashed out of the room.
‘Yeah?’ Harry said, his tone flirtatious as he pushed himself off the bench so that he was standing in front of Draco, nearly touching but not quite. ‘I suppose I better thank the Healer who helped me recover from my injury then.’
Today, though, is different. The crash doesn’t seem to be arriving, his heart rate still just as high, the restless energy in his legs still present. He knows what it is, even if he’s been trying to avoid admitting it to himself. But when Draco comes and leans against the wall with him, close enough that their sleeves brush against each other, Harry can’t deny it. He’s been watching Draco. He’s been doing it all his life, really, but the watching has taken on a different tenor recently. He can’t seem to stop staring at Draco, whether they’re sat working in their office, Draco messing up his hair as he tries to puzzle through a case, or when they’re in the Auror gym, Draco’s tight clothes leaving little to the imagination and making it impossible for Harry to concentrate on his own exercises. And especially during raids, when Draco turns into a force of nature, eyes gleaming as he casts perfect spell after perfect spell, the way they work together making Harry wonder just how compatible they could be in other ways too.
‘Well, I suppose I can be, for the right person.’ Draco’s heart was pounding in his chest, nerves making him feel sick. He hoped he hadn’t taken it too far, that he hadn’t misread Harry’s comment. It had sounded flirty, but Merlin, what if Draco had just imagined it?
‘Not really,’ Malfoy said, gesturing for Harry to follow him into the cottage. ‘Astoria and I are due to go for drinks with Pansy and Theo.’
wasn’t, but her daughter was. That’s why she hid the objects at her mother’s house, because she knew her house was at risk of being searched. The Aurors have a file on her, have been investigating her on and off for several years, and they were very interested in what we’d found. They’ve taken over the case now, and hope to finally prosecute her.’
‘And that helped him get better faster? Got him back to flying quicker than you expected?’ Harry was intrigued—he’d worked with physios at the club, but had never received any physio support while still in the hospital before. He’d never given it much thought, mostly because he was always in a rush to get out of the hospital as soon as possible, often defying Healer’s orders and leaving earlier than he should, but what Malfoy was saying made sense. Besides, anything that would get him back on a broom quicker was surely worth trying.
‘I don’t intend to pay for anything to do with you ever again,’ Harry says, sincerity shining in his eyes as he brings Draco’s hand to his mouth and kisses it.
The next day was no different. This time Ginny insisted that he stay at home, telling him he looked dreadful. He must have looked really bad, as she sent him back to bed, bringing him up enough water and snacks to last him until she got home from work. When he heard the crack of her Apparating away, Harry couldn’t hold back the tears any longer, and he sobbed into their pillows, the scent of Ginny all around him.
Malfoy shrugged, the gesture casual yet still infuriatingly elegant and drawing Harry’s attention to the shirt Malfoy was wearing instead of his robes.
Draco is cold and sticky and in desperate need of a shower, or at least a cleaning charm, but he can’t pass up this chance to look at Potter. The hair scattered across his chest is damp with both of their sweat, and Draco follows it down across his toned stomach, to where his cock nestles amongst more dark hair. Potter’s thighs are as toned as you’d expect from a Quidditch player, and Draco suddenly wishes he could watch Potter fly. He’d always been entranced by Potter in the air—he blames his many defeats to Potter on how distracted he’d been during matches—and he’s sure Potter has only got faster and more graceful in the years since they played against each other at school.
While Harry went upstairs to put Teddy to bed, Draco wandered back into the living room. He’d had a quick glance around before they started to watch the film, but Harry’s closeness had soon distracted him from his surroundings, so it was with great interest that he looked around the room. It was somehow just very
Draco does as he’s told and then waits for Potter’s next instruction. He wants to see how far Potter is going to take this, how much control he’s capable of wielding. That’s not to say Draco will let him get away with anything—Draco’s always been the type to push the limits—but he knows he’ll do more for Potter than he would for anyone else.
‘Harry?’ Ginny pressed, her face set again, the anger seeping back in to her expression the longer he stalled.
‘Thanks,’ Harry said, but he made no moves to take his hand out from under Malfoy’s. The weight of it was comforting, grounding him, and Malfoy’s skin was soft against his. Every tiny movement of Malfoy’s fingers set Harry’s nerves alight.
By the time the fight eventually petered out, Andromeda had long given up on watching and retreated to the sanctuary of the kitchen, and Draco had made himself comfortable on the sofa. Teddy dashed off to get a drink and a snack from Andromeda to keep him going through the lesson, and Draco was left alone with Harry for the first time in forever. He had no idea what to say, all possible topics of conversation deserting him apart from those that would immediately reference their past, and he didn’t really feel like starting a fight right now. It was hard enough to come here and teach Teddy about pure-blood beliefs, he didn’t need any more of a reminder about what he had done as a result of them. Harry didn’t seem at all bothered by the awkwardness though, sinking onto the sofa next to Draco with a groan.
‘It’s hard to say for sure,’ Malfoy said slowly, his expression suggesting he was choosing his words carefully. ‘So much depends on the individual patient’s genetics, bone strength, baseline fitness… their cooperation with treatment and rehab.’ Malfoy looked pointedly at Harry as he finished speaking.
‘We should hopefully be able to avoid it—I made it clear we’re not keen to be brought in, and hinted that having an ex-Death Eater and the
Draco woke up early on Saturday morning, his stomach already tying itself in knots with wrestling nerves and excitement. He couldn’t wait to see Harry again, but was nervous to see whether things would be different between them, unsure of how they would behave around each other. That wasn’t the only reason for his nerves though. He’d had this trip in mind since he first started to plan his and Teddy’s adventures, but had been saving it until the end because of its importance and significance, both to the pure-blood communities but also to Draco himself. Draco had been taken there by his parents when he was young, maybe aged five or six, so long ago that his memories of the event were fuzzy and indistinct, but he would never forget the way the magic felt coursing through his veins, the moment when he really understood what he was and what it meant. He couldn’t wait for Teddy and Harry to experience it.
But Draco comes into the bathroom anyway, propping himself on the edge of the bath near Harry’s head.
For long minutes he just stands there, letting Potter look. It’s surprisingly erotic, and Draco’s cock hardens further under Potter’s scrutiny. His clients normally look at him, of course, but never quite in this way. When they look at him, Draco knows they’re seeing what they want to see, his body just the template for the fantasy they superimpose on top. With Potter, it’s different. Draco feels seen, properly, for the first time in years, and he knows Potter’s seeing the messy reality of him, tattoo-covered wrists, sectumsempra scars and all.
‘So you opened a cafe?’ Harry had been listening quietly, his eyes trained on Draco as he spoke, but when Draco paused Harry filled the silence.
‘Don’t mind them, Draco, they’re like little children when they play together,’ Andromeda said, pressing a hot cup of tea into Draco’s hands. ‘They’ll wear each other out soon enough.’
‘No fucking way,’ Harry said hotly as Malfoy continued to watch him silently. Harry shifted and tried to push himself up to a seated position so that he could swing his legs out of the bed. Even if it was possible that Malfoy had changed since the war, there was no way Harry was going to lie there and let Malfoy treat him. But then pain screamed through his hip and he collapsed back onto the pillows with a yelp.
Harry lingered in the kitchen long after Ginny had disappeared upstairs, alternating between pacing and sitting at the table with his head in his hands. When he couldn’t hold back the yawns any longer, Harry finally gave in and trudged upstairs, fighting back yet more guilt when he climbed into bed and looked over at Ginny who was curled up on her side, sound asleep.
For a while, Harry kept the anxiety at bay by practicing Quidditch plays in his mind. Before the season started Oliver had made them spend several long, tiring days ensconced in one of the training rooms at the club while he talked them through every single play he wanted them to use over the season. The room, which they usually used for stretching and lifting dumbbells, had been transformed, all the mats Vanished and replaced with rows of chairs. At first glance, they looked comfortable, but by the end of the third day Harry’s body had been protesting so much time spent sitting down not moving. Harry knew Oliver was just trying to look out for them all and set them up for success, though, so he’d only made one jokey comment when Oliver had handed them each a folder full of wriggling diagrams and mock scenarios for each play. He’d glanced at it a few times since then, flipping through to find the ones which were relevant to him, and he occupied himself for a while trying to remember them all now. He had nothing else to do, after all, and it was as close as he was going to get to actually training for the next few weeks at least. He made a mental note to ask Ron to bring him the folder next time he came in to visit if it looked like Harry was going to be here for much longer.
Keen to move Potter’s attention away from his chest, Draco moves his hands to his belt, slowly unfastening it, the hiss of the leather pulling through his belt loops loud in the otherwise silent room. Potter’s watching him again, and Draco’s cock twitches as he feels Potter’s gaze on him like a brand. Draco doesn’t look away as he unzips his trousers, doesn’t miss the way the sound of the zip makes Potter shiver.
‘Uh, yeah, sure,’ Harry said, doing his best to ignore the way his heart rate kicked up a notch when Malfoy’s fingers touched his, gently guiding Harry through the movements. The ghost of Malfoy’s touch lingered even once he’d pulled his hand away.
‘So,’ Malfoy said when he finished telling Harry stories from his job. He fixed Harry with an intent look. ‘Do you want to talk about it?’
The first major challenge of their day involved tackling the Tube. Draco Side-Alonged them from Andromeda’s house to a secluded patch of trees in a park near the centre of London. He could have Apparated them straight to their destination, of course, but everything he had read about Muggles seemed to suggest that getting the Tube was an important and eye-opening experience, and a great way to find yourself surrounded by a wide variety of people from all walks of life. They walked from the park to the nearest Tube station, Teddy excitedly telling Draco about his week and the Quidditch match Harry was taking him to the next day. Apart from Draco constantly reminding Teddy to keep his voice down when talking about magical things, their journey to the Tube station went very smoothly, and Draco began to feel his confidence grow, the tension in his shoulders disappearing and his frown smoothing out.
, but they never talked about what they were doing. At work they steadfastly stuck to discussions of mundane case details if they had to interact at all, and once they were outside the pub, they were too busy to talk, mouths occupied and concentration elsewhere. More than that, Harry was happy to use any excuse to avoid talking about what was happening between them, despite knowing they probably should. Talking about it would make it real. Malfoy never brought up Astoria, and Harry never mentioned Ginny, resolutely ignoring the way his stomach squirmed with guilt whenever he caught a glimpse of one of their wedding rings, and he never asked Malfoy how he could live with what they were doing. He was content to try and stay in denial, to continue to pretend that because they never shared a bed and never talked or brought up feelings that this wasn’t as bad as it could be.
He just can’t face seeing him again, not yet. Not when he knows he won’t be able to hide how he’s feeling, and when watching Potter leave will break him again.
‘For me.’ Draco drops his head into his hands, hiding from Pansy’s gaze. ‘I wanted it to be real, and it was too much, I couldn’t see him anymore. I couldn’t have him paying me any longer.’
Harry hadn’t talked to anyone like this in so long, and he felt like he’d bared his soul to Malfoy, even though they’d only talked about their careers. But he and Ron and Hermione had fallen into such a pattern over the years, talking in shorthand, making assumptions after years of knowing each other, that it was a refreshing, if slightly scary, change, to have to explain himself to someone again. The fact that it was Malfoy, someone who’d always been at his throat, who’d never hesitated to question him or make fun of his choices, only added another layer. But this Malfoy was different, he reminded himself.
‘Perhaps, yes,’ Narcissa confirmed, before their conversation was interrupted by their wizened old house-elf clearing the plates ready for dessert.
Harry woke up aching, every fibre of his body calling out for Draco’s body, wave after wave of desire rushing over him in a way that he hadn’t felt in a long time. Even as the details of the dream began to fade, the feelings it provoked in him remained, a previously unnoticed need for something deeper bubbling up to the surface. All day his hand itched to reach out and touch, the need only growing stronger each time he remembered he couldn’t. Seeing Malfoy was torture, feelings he had never even considered before, suddenly making themselves known through butterflies and shaking hands whenever he looked over at Malfoy.
As the action resumed after the penalty, Harry went back to flying slowly around the pitch, scanning the sky for the Snitch. The sky was gunmetal grey, threatening rain, the wind was whipping in his hair, and he loved it. He’d never expected to end up a Quidditch player—he never expected to live past school, really—but now he couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Despite the difficulties that came with a career in the public eye, it was all worth it for how free he felt soaring high above the ground, the thrill of competition beating through his veins.
‘You’re a constant surprise,’ Harry muttered to himself under his breath, but the grin that flashed across Malfoy’s face suggested he hadn’t been quiet enough.
When the day of the ball finally arrived, they still hadn’t discussed it, instead still clinging to the fallacy that Harry was just taking Draco to the ball as a favour to a friend, nothing more. They both left work early on the day, having agreed that they would get ready separately and then meet at the country house where the ball was being held. All day Harry had been a bundle of nerves, unable to focus on work for thinking and worrying about the ball, barely able to eat anything thanks to the pit of worry in his stomach. He had no idea how he was supposed to hold it together while pretending to be madly in love with Draco.
Despite the enormity of his need, it all starts with the tiniest of touches. Without even really planning it, Harry’s hand twitches, his little finger brushing against Draco’s. Heart thumping, Harry watches as Draco looks down at their hands, still skin to skin, then up at Harry. For a long, agonising moment, they just look at each other, Harry watching closely to try and catch any hint of emotion on Draco’s face, waiting for something - permission? rejection? interest? In the end the answer comes not from Draco’s expression, but from the feeling of Draco’s finger gently stroking the back of Harry’s hand, the touch featherlight but enough to send a burning heat racing through Harry’s veins.
Harry’s suggestion stayed with Draco though, especially when he noticed Teddy zoning out while he lectured again. That evening, Draco didn’t go straight home from Andromeda’s, heading instead to the library near his house where he could use the computer. He’d tried for ages to get the laptop he’d bought to work in his flat, but he just couldn’t get it to cooperate with all the magic around, even using the new Magic Suppressing Charms that had recently become all the rage. Instead he had become a regular patron of the local library, settling himself there whenever he needed to research something. He’d even ended up with quite a taste for Muggle literature, and now had a rather sizeable stack of borrowed books on his bedside table.
‘I just—’ Potter gestures awkwardly before dropping his hands back down to his sides. ‘I need to fuck you.’
The uncharacteristic sound of Draco swearing made Harry look up. Draco hardly ever swore - Harry could count on his fingers the number of times he’d heard a swear word escape from Draco during the 10 years they’d been Auror partners - so something dramatic had obviously happened. And yet, when Harry looked over to Draco’s desk, his partner was just sat looking at what seemed to be an invitation. Surely that couldn’t have elicited such a reaction.
Unsurprisingly, Ron was angry with Harry at first—Harry had let him shout, get it out of his system, had let the insulting things Ron said about Malfoy wash over him until Ron ran out of steam, his anger burning out as it always did eventually. Once Ron was settled on the sofa with a cold beer in his hand, Harry explained everything, from the incident at the cottage through to his conversation with Ginny and his plans for the future. Ron’s facial expressions told Harry exactly what he was thinking as Harry recounted the events of the last few months, but he stayed quiet, letting Harry talk, and only when Harry had finished speaking did he admit that he wasn’t sure he’d ever understand what drew Harry to Malfoy, but that he was with Harry whatever he chose. Heart full and shoulders drained of tension that he didn’t even realise he’d been carrying, Harry pulled Ron into a hug. Things weren’t completely fixed—Harry knew he’d have plenty more awkward conversations to get through, but as the evening passed by, the two of them sitting on the sofa listening to a Quidditch match, beers in hand, Harry felt like just maybe everything would be all right.
? ‘The right person would be someone who I can talk to, who isn’t boring, who knows me and my life and the magical world. And someone disgustingly attractive too of course.’
‘Well, anyway, it was hell for me too, so I left. I’ve not regretted it for a second,’ Draco adds, his tone softer this time.
"Don't be sorry, Harry," he murmured against the raven-haired boys' forehead, "You can sleep a little longer. It's only eleven."
He didn't know when he had woken up or even when he shifted out of the bed, but when his mind dared to refocus he was sitting back in the wicker chair pulled right up to the head of the bed, curled his legs up to his chest and sat there breathing heavily against his fingertips as he watched Draco. He looked so beautiful lying on the pillow, his darkened blonde hair splayed out over the soft cotton pillow. His face looked a little sweaty from the heat, his golden lashes curling upward, and he looked a little weak where he hadn't really been eating too well.
He didn't say anything as he settled down on the stone balcony, his back to the stone pillars and loosening his tie. He bent his knees and propped his elbows up, before tilting his head back and heaving a soft sigh. Harry glanced over at the blonde, quickly checking to make sure that there were no bumps or bruises marring the flawless skin, before letting his eyes slip back over to the horizon.
Draco shook his head with a smile, "Oh, Mister Potter, I should tell you that I never lower myself to making compromises," he stated and then bit his tongue when he saw the downward turn of Harry's smile, "But," he continued in a light tone, "I am more than willing to say you've convinced me to thinking that there may be something to it. So yes, it does sound fair to me."
They linked their fingers together as they strode along the walk-way that over-looked the sea. Gulls cawed some distance along the shore. The dull buzz of nightclub music could be heard vaguely over the gentle hush of the waves crashing against the shoreline.
"H-Harry?" he asked praying to Merlin that he wasn't suffering from delirium again. He didn't need that again. He tossed his head from side-to-side and groaned and honestly didn't need his mind playing tricks on him again. "If you're not real please get out of my sight. I'm in no mood for this idiocy today!" he snapped knowing full well that any figment of his imagination would simply stay to antagonize him.
A smile curved onto his mouth as he bent over to retrieve the hoodie from the floor, quickly slipping into the Luke warm fabric and zipping it up at the front. Satisfied, he drew back the covers and slid beneath them, propping the laptop on his lap once we had settled up against the pillows. As the laptop loaded, Harry wriggled over to Draco's side of the bed and rested his head on Draco's chest with a hum of contentment. It made him smile. He made quick work of logging on to the internet -he adored Harry for showing him all about Muggle technology -and was quick to locate a decently priced hotel in -
Harry smirked, "Wow. I don't know what's gotten into you recently, but you're being so affectionate right now." He leaned in, pressing himself against Draco's slick cock. He rubbed himself against the blonde, "You're so sexy, Draco. And I really do love you. I've wanted to tell you for a long time, but I didn't know if you felt the same." He ducked his head shyly.
The following night they met in the empty classroom and instead of raw, hard fucking, they made slow, sweet burning love that made every moment of their lives prior to that evening a faded, grey haze at the back of their minds. Draco was so relieved that Harry was even alive that he couldn't wait to get his clothes off and commit every hair of his body to memory.
Looking back on it all now he should have realised that the young, clean-cut gentleman was in fact Harry. He really should have known what to expect, but even as he heard the deep-throated, beautiful laugh from his memories it had been too unfamiliar a sound for him to pinpoint it. When Severus had looked up and welcomed them from their nap, the young man had turned around in his seat. The way his face had split open into such a breath-taking smile still sent shivers running down through Draco's stomach. He felt as though the wind had been knocked out of him as he stared down at the brunette man with a new haircut, freshly shaven and smartly dressed in a crisp summer shirt and a delicately embroidered waistcoat.
Severus pursed his lips, as though he were debating on whether to tell Draco his suspicions but decided that he may as well be truthful, or at least partially truthful. "I have a suspicion as to what might be afflicting Harry, and I have to say that if you don't watch yourself, Draco, you could very easily see yourself going the same way."
Harry was extremely vocal even over the squeaking of the desk against the stone floor as Draco dominated the brunette boy and made true of every one of their maddening innuendos.
"I know you did," Harry soothed as he reached out and gave Draco's shoulder a squeeze, "Try not to dwell on it too greatly, alright? Not on your own at least. Severus will be more than happy to help you or even listen to you if you feel you need someone to speak to."
Calais, France in the year 1852 was the year where Harry Potter's life took such a dramatic turn of events and had quite literally changed his life forever. He had been training underneath a very prestigious Healer in the French wizarding community and spent a lot of his time studying in the basement of the apothecary, his clothes often smelling heavily of various forms of incense and potions ingredients. He didn't mind it because he truly did love what he was studying. He got to sit in on surgeries and analyse various patients under the effects of different treatments. He didn't mind being on trivial duties that sent him around the hospital; he liked the menial tasks as much as the elaborate ones and would write long letters to his father in London, informing him about the various things he was learning about. He earned barely enough to keep himself alive on but he truly did love the work that he couldn't turn his back away from it.
He collapsed back against the chair, his face in his hands once again. All the memories were washing up in his minds-eye, melting into one another, in one big happy blur that consisted of wagging tails, giddy grins, bright green eyes and tender kisses. All of it was over-shadowed by that dreaded day when they had gone to the hospital seven and a half months ago. The call had come completely out of the blue. Neither had been expecting it. Even poor Seeker could tell that something was up once Harry had replaced the receiver on the hook.
He tried his best not to let those moments distract him but it was extremely difficult when Draco stood before him, braced against the engraved bedposts in only a small towel wrapped around his hips, it became increasingly difficult for the brunette man to breathe. Even if Draco was on the skinny side, there was no denying he had some vague semblance of muscle from the effort of having to move himself around in such a weakened state. Over the course of the rest of the week that he had stayed on an emergency visit, Draco had made a marked improvement already and Harry had been really impressed and excited all at once. It amused the blonde man to no end to see how excited his companion would get. However, they were both unusually silent in the hour that Draco was naked and being examined over and over by the brunette, his calloused tanned hands running over his pale muscles, his nimble fingertips brushing gently over the contours of his torso that always made him shiver. The feeling wasn't entirely unpleasant. He didn't say anything though, but Harry didn't seem to mind to touch him once he got the confidence brought on by at least two glasses of rich wine.
Upon entering his father's vast study of oak-panelled walls, dark oil paintings and thick embroidered curtains hanging over the windows, Draco drew in a sharp breath of the dusty musk that had followed his father around for the last few months. The air was almost stale in his mouth. It took his breath away, even more so than the numerous boxes stacked around the desk filled with documents and papers that had been dragged out of the attic. He settled himself down into the large leather chair behind the desk and ran his hands through his hair, trying to regain some semblance of energy in himself to tackle all the boxes. He pulled the closest one to him up onto the desk and set about rifling through its contents.
He shouldn't have let it bother him, he really shouldn't especially not when he was dodging bolts of fire from an angry Hungarian Horntail. He couldn't get burned to death without giving as good as he got to Malfoy. That's when it clicked in his head. His firebolt! As soon as he landed on the broom relief rushed through him as he soared up into the air.
They walked in silence for a little while before they decided to settle down on the grassy banks and dig out their textbooks just to have something to do. They stayed that way for the rest of their lunch break, only moving and talking about nothing in particular when Ron eventually found them, having looked everywhere else, and joined them on the bank until the bells chimed out the five-minute warning for their next lesson.
"Don't leave me Draco," Harry whispered arching his body and turning onto his back so that Draco was lying half on top of him.
Once she had scuttled away, Harry smiled over at Draco and nudged his foot under the table, "you know how to make me feel a whole lot better, Draco," Draco smiled but said nothing, his hands clasped together upon the tabletop. Harry frowned weakly. "Draco?"
Bracing himself on Draco's raised knees, Harry continued to piston himself inside Draco's body, sweat running in rivets down his tanned body. He had to keep refocusing his attention on getting Draco off too. His lungs didn't seem able to hold any air; it was like he was sucking fire down his throat. He was starting to see stars, and judging from the way those silver eyes were rolling back in Draco's head, he was teetering on the edge too.
Harry felt the heat on the back of his neck increase a little as he, too, inclined his head. "Your son very much flatters me, Lord Malfoy. I was merely explaining to him that he need not give up on modern medicine for we are now leaps and bounds ahead of where we were not three years ago and that if he had a regular physician there would be no need for ill-health for the majority of the year. He didn't seem particularly interested last night to continue our conversation though, so I am surprised he so much as mentioned me to you, your grace."
"No, love, not yet," at Harry's crestfallen features, Draco felt his heart ache, "do you want to get all snuggled up and I'll bring the laptop in here?" Harry nodded and watched as Draco left to quickly snatch up his laptop. Draco ran his fingers over the smooth object before slowly straightening his back and walking along the smooth floorboards to the bedroom. As he nudged open the door with his foot, he smiled warmly at the sight of Harry's face peering up from a cocoon of warm blankets. "Any room in that cocoon for me, Hun?" he teased with a soft glint in his eyes as he flicked his wand at the lamp on his side of the bed. The dull light shined off of Harry's smooth head, but it only managed to make him look more vulnerable and sweet.
Hermione sighed and gracefully into the armchair adjacent to the sofa. She ran a hand through her curly hair and sighed, her tired brown eyes glittering with tears. "Draco, please, let someone help you? You don't want Harry to come home to you making yourself ill, do you?"
"Have it your way then," he waved his arm in an arc and cocked his eyebrow, "Lead the way, scarhead."
Theo hummed in thought before shrugging, "Then we must have missed something vital whilst brewing it."
Again, something twisted inside Draco. Normally, he was the one who topped since that was just how their relationship had started. He wasn't opposed to Harry topping -it just too a bit for him to adjust to being dominated. He got defensive sometimes, tried to wriggled out from underneath. Not to mention -as reluctant as he was to admit it -Harry was thicker than he was. It literally took him some getting used to, having Harry fill him up to breaking point.
"I am not so rich that I did not bother to read, Potter," the blonde man snapped irritably, his cheeks beginning to look a little clammy.
Draco sat up fully and threaded both of his hands through the soft black hair, gripping Harry's face between his hands and staring fully into his eyes, both of their breathing hushed and laboured between them. The weight of the younger man in his lap made every muscle inside him ache and burn. "I said that I want you to kiss me," he panted.
Harry turned with an amused eyebrow raised up at the blonde and raised his flute to sip from it, "Are you telling me that you are not too high up in the eyes of society to look down on little people like me?"
He went through the morning routines after Draco slipped out of his bedchamber with a small smile over his shoulder as he went. Harry had simply stared after him blankly, not knowing how to move himself or how to react. He was numb and so tired that he felt like his brain had liquefied and ran out of his ear. He filled his basin with tepid water and stripped down, tossing the nightshirt into the wicker hamper and burying it down with his other dirty shirts and undergarments. He slowly washed his entire body, as though the slow ritual would cleanse his blackness away from his mind and the wounds in his thighs that had started to scab over. He rinsed his face and fingered the black bags that were dragging the skin down beneath his eyes. He shivered as a cool breeze surfed under the balcony door and chilled his damp skin. He skipped breakfast but managed to force himself to eat lunch with Narcissa and Severus whilst Draco and Lucius took a gentle hike along the riverbanks. He wanted to hate the fact that he felt a germ of relief that the blonde man wasn't there, but he couldn't muster the energy to feel anything besides numbness.
She hummed in response and then raked her fingers through her hair, "It's just so irritating. The war was meant to get rid of all of this. I know no one likes being forced to grow up, but we had to and they're still acting in this way over easy targets. It's barbaric."
"I came back for you here, didn't I?" Harry rasped out, his throat husky from where the wand had jabbed into it. "I couldn't have left you here then, and I'm not leaving this room now. Not until we sort this all out!"
He still remembered when their business was first up and running and he manned the counter whilst Harry checked on brewing potions in the back room. That had been when Draco was learning how to run the shop on his own, for the most part, and learning about the 'tricks of the trade' as Harry had called it. He was glad that the brunette had talked him into starting a business. They'd had so much fun behind the counter as they'd boxed up small packages of pepper-up for a worrying mother to send to her son in boarding school, or explained to an elderly gentleman how to apply the salve that would ease up the rheumatism in his legs when it got wet. He had been so bored beforehand, always in the manor and shuffling from room to room as though he were a ghost already, instead of a living breathing being. Harry had changed his life quite literally for the better. It had been thrilling too, the minute risks they came to take in their day-to-day life; Draco would be behind the counter, describing a new scented powder that would clear up baby's rash –something that had taken Harry months to perfect properly –when Harry would come up behind him, an arm loaded with wares and his hand would graze against Draco's arse through his trousers, making the blonde gasp and force out a cough to cover the fact that he was blushing profusely. He had gotten his own petty revenge when Harry had asked him for some help unloading a stack of crates in his arms. As he had leaned over and snatched one of the crates, he leaned over as though murmuring in Harry's ear when really; he'd teased the brunette's earlobe with his teeth before pressing a chaste kiss to his cheeks. Harry had blushed unbearably and disappeared from the shop floor for half an hour. Thankfully no one caught onto it.
"Anyway, I convinced them both to stay and destroy the other horcruxes. I went down to the forest on my own. Well, I wasn't really alone."
Twisting his mouth in concentration he flicked his wand in the direction of their bedroom. "Accio pen and paper." A notepad and a muggle Biro came floating out of the bedroom. Replacing his wand with the Biro, as awkward as it felt in his fingers, he began doodling on the notepad, waiting for something remotely interesting -a way to start-to pop into his head.
Draco rolled his red-rimmed eyes but took up the duelling stance, so similar to the one he'd done in their second year. Harry was pummelled with a memory so gripping that he didn't realise Draco had cast a spell until it hit him and sent him flying backwards against the flagstones, knocking the wind out of him. He landed on his back and blinked up at the ceiling, gasping for breath before he felt his body being levitated and spun around in the air and slammed down onto the floor again.
"Oh, and you do, do you?" she snarled in his face, "Why should I believe anything that some little Death Eater scum like you has to say?"
When he looked over at Harry he saw that the younger man and bowed his head and was blushing in embarrassment. "That honestly didn't cross my mind at all. Goodness, I feel such a fool!" he huffed and tossed his quill to the desk and slumped back.
Casting his tearful eyes around the room he clutched heavily at his hair, the heat from his anger brimming out of every orifice on his head. His eyes were blurred with the angry tears that had sprung up behind his golden lashes. How dare they! How dare they barge in here and take the love of his life away from him! He let out a series of cries, they were not squeals or wails or yells, they were merely the most horrifying sound anyone could make, the sound of trapped air releasing itself through ones mouth and ripping all oxygen from ones lungs.
Harry snorted in the back of his throat but he had the decency to close the book, his thumb hooked in the page he'd stopped at. He leaned his head back against the pillows and focused his gaze on the blonde. "What are you doing here, Draco?" he breathed softly, no conviction present in his voice.
"You are delirious," Harry affirmed, finally finding his voice, "Let me go back to my bedchamber and get some more of my potions for you."
Draco stretched himself out on the bed beside his lover and played with the damp strands of hair curling up from his temples, "By remembering all of the things that you have done
Harry nodded and drained the rest of his flute and let out a breathy sigh into the tepid night air. "Very well then, Draco, I shall write to you but you must promise to tell me if I do bore you so that I can find something in my day that may interest you. Does that sound like a fair compromise?"
"We should go back down there for another weekend," Harry murmured to himself, as he adjusted himself on the pillows, the winces of pain making Draco's heart ache.
He didn't want to be around anyone, not after last month and what Severus had made him write down. According to the greasy haired man he was suffering from a severe form of depression and at that Harry had snapped and thrown the man out of his bedchamber and spent the rest of the night trying to diagnose himself and trying not to be biased. A voice in the back of his mind told him how much that he failed at that one simple task, but he ignored it and decided that with a little extra sleep, he'd be perfectly fine and back to normal. If only he could get to sleep, then he'd be all set. He had no idea where Draco and the others were and it wasn't like he even cared anyway, or would seek his 'husband' out to talk to him. He didn't feel like he could talk to the blonde anymore, but he didn't know why. He couldn't pinpoint a moment where it had all gotten so hard for them to live together.
There was a crack that streaked through the sky, a flash of bright light and then a torrent of thick, heavy raindrops began pelting down across the grounds. Harry gasped and bolted up to his feet as though he'd personally been struck by lightning. Draco scurried up to his feet tugging the blanket up as he leaned heavily on the tree trunk. Harry didn't notice how close they were, tucked underneath the weak shelter of the blossom tree. Draco couldn't help but smile. It had been ages since he'd gotten caught in such bad weather so suddenly. The laugh that bubbled out made Harry look up at him as if he were mad, but he didn't care. He stepped out from the blossoms, his cane dropping into the grass, as he tilted his chin up, spread his arms wide and laughed up into the falling rain, feeling as though he were being reborn into a fresh new chapter of his life.
Draco shook his head, "I told him to get help so many times but he refused and snapped at me. He'd gotten so tiresome I almost didn't
Draco could remember watching the dark-haired man stand gracefully and make his way over to the large ornate doors keeping the draft from the hallways from entering the room. The way he'd tugged the tartan blanket over his lap he turned toward the fireplace and closed his eyes to the soft heat emanating from it. As much as he slept he still felt tired and arguing with Severus just increased the pressure in both his head and in his chest.
"Back to the station," Draco responded in an indifferent manner as he tilted his head to one side to watch the streets jitter past him. The roads in Paris were ever so bothersome; crammed with too many people too busy to remember the rules of driving a coach and not enough room to do it in. Not to mention a lot of the roads were uneven and awkward under the wheels, making Draco feel travel sick every time.
Draco exhaled and slumped back against the stone pillar. As blunt as Harry had been it was still a lot to take in. He rubbed the back of his neck until the skin burned with the pressure and his stomach lurched uncomfortably. Harry had died. He could've stayed gone. Voldemort could have won after all. He felt nauseated but then another thought entered his head that made him shiver with the cold.
Draco shifted slightly so that he was now looking at Harry. His eyes didn't have any weight to them, though, it was almost as though he were slipping into a daydream. Was he imagining what Harry had been through, what it had felt like? Harry shivered and wondered if anyone could really and truly know what he felt like, and he doubted that it would ever happen.
He felt heat pool in the pit of his stomach and his school trousers grew a little tighter. Thank goodness for school robes! Dipping his quill into his inkwell he quickly scratched out a note underneath the original and took the next five minutes carefully folding the paper crane back and sent it flying back around the room.
Hastily unzipping his jeans, Harry slid his chair out from under the table to give Malfoy better access. His mind was running blank as he felt someone touching his cock and getting him good and hard. He let out a strangled grunt at the back of his throat as Malfoy grazed his teeth down his neck and pumped his fist harder around the, admittedly, impressive length.
Lucius and Narcissa went off where they instantly caught sight of Severus and began talking to him off to one side. Draco and Harry were left to their own devices, so as soon as Harry grasped two champagne flutes for the both of them, silently grateful for the rich food that was settling his stomach, and handed one to the blonde man beside him. Draco turned to him with a lazy smirk, "Come on, how about we go and have a stroll in the gardens and enjoy the summer night." It wasn't a request but more of a statement as to what was going to happen whether Harry wanted it to or not. He didn't protest though. He rather liked the hotel gardens. As they strolled along the stone pathways Draco smiled genuinely for the first time, "I have to admit Harry that you are good company. I haven't heard such riveting passion from anyone in such a long time. I understand it that this is your last night in Paris, correct?"
What they planned to do in the afternoon, Draco had no idea. Maybe a walk along the beach with some sunshine. Or explore each of the piers.
Harry shook his head, "You need your rest. I only wanted to make sure you weren't suffering unduly."
Once he was dressed he went over to the hair-dryer to dry his hair and couldn't help but notice Harry watching him in the mirror. "I really miss having hair," Harry stated as he stood up and ran a hand absently through Draco's damp locks. "I miss you teasing it, curling it, tugging it ... even washing it for me."
Harry chuckled but obliged as he turned back towards the direction of the hotel, his fingers entwining with Draco's own as they walked.
Draco did not mind, he still had his Harry with him to hold and love and wipe tears away from blindly green eyes. But it hurt him so much that the man who was once the hero of the wizarding world was reduced to something akin to a shell of his former self; thin and bald and eating less almost every day. It made him physically sick to even think of the 'what if's' that Hermione adored to bring up, almost like she could not wait for Harry to d- NO! He would not think of it! Harry was strong, he would not die, he knew he wouldn't.
With her threat hanging like a black cloud in the air over their heads, she turned on her heel and briskly stalked from the room. They both listened to the clicking of her heels on the hardwood floorboards. The roar of the floo network opening and closing as Hermione left their apartment, made them both sigh with relief.
There was nothing wrong with what he'd done. According to the textbook he had brewed it perfectly. So why hadn't it worked?
"So what?" Harry countered, straightening up as best as he could. "Is it so bad for me to look out for you? Is it so bad for you to have someone giving you a help in hand once in a while?"
It almost drained Harry to mirror his movements but he felt a little better as soon as he had his glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. Once they were back outside, and as they watched the door disappear back into the brickwork of the wall, and breathing a little easier, Harry turned to Draco and hesitated for a moment, wondering what to say if they should say anything at all.
He barely broke stride as he walked around the perimeter of the courtyard. Potter didn't look up, but he could tell by the hunch in his shoulders that he knew he wasn't alone. Smirking to himself, he said loudly, "Hey Potter, want to Slytherin my bed tonight?"
Draco snorted, "Minister Fudge was supposedly a professional! So was Umbridge, apparently! And they did was use their power to screw us all over!"
Lucius smirked a little wider and then moved his cool approval over to Snape. "You have done well in training this young boy, Severus. I daresay he will be your greatest accomplishment. He is certainly a credit to you." Severus inclined his head in much the same cool manner as Harry was accustomed to. "In fact, if you do not mind losing the company of young Mister Potter for a few moments, I would like to talk to him in private."
He had expressly told her that no one in the Malfoy bloodline had ever owned a pet other than an owl, or perhaps on a few occasions –a snake. Hermione had scowled at him, telling him that Harry had had enough of snakes to last him more than three life-times if not more. However, at the mention of the past and, later Hogwarts, Hermione had recalled Harry's godfather Sirius Black whose animagus form was a dog. Hence, her exclamation that they should adopt a puppy.
"I'm not going to do any of that if that's what you're after," the brunette growled darkly, a horrid shadow passing over his face.
Releasing his lover with a wet 'pop', Harry leaned up on his arms and knees and sat cross-legged between Draco's strong, pale thighs. "Try and relax, okay?"
Harry let his hands drop away, "Untie your nightshirt and open it up for me. I need to run some diagnostic spells on you to see where the pains are in your chest and work from there. Is that alright?"
Draco smiled as he tore his eyes away from the tree to see the content expression on Harry's face. He felt much the same way, "Happy first Christmas Harry." He raised his goblet and they clinked them together.
Harry glanced around; sure enough a few people were in fact staring at him. He shrugged to Hermione, "It's probably some stupid Slytherin tactic to psyche me out before the first task. It'll blow over, don't worry."
Draco nodded, "Yes, I need to feel you inside me. I need you to dominate me. I need you to make me scream and beg and lose myself underneath you." He pressed his hot, hungry mouth onto Harry's and moaned low in his throat as he clutched Harry tighter, "I want to greet the sun tomorrow morning still screaming your name over and over into the pillows with you buried deep inside me."
Lucius paused for a moment and seemed to be contemplating the possibility. "Well if that is indeed the case then what would you suggest countering it?"
Harry wiped his eyes discreetly, and squeezed his lovers hand tightly, "this was a perfect holiday, Draco. I almost wish that we didn't have to go home."
Nodding his head, the younger wizard brushed his hands under Draco's shirt, giving his tight shoulders a squeeze. "Positive. And this time ... I want to make love to you."
Harry blinked in surprise, "You really think that I have anything worthwhile that would keep you interested?"
Harry nodded and sat up along the mattress and stole a chaste kiss, "I'm sorry, I don't mean to spoil tonight," he wiped hastily as his eyes, "Let me go and light the fire. I don't want either of us getting a chill in the middle of the night." As he stood up and went to stoke the fire and tug a nightshirt on over his head, he tried to calm his racing mind. He didn't want to feel the guilt forever but how could he let it go? He couldn't just do it simply because that's what Draco wanted. As soon as the fire started to flicker in the grate he wiped at his eyes, drew in a few deep breaths and straightened up, his back muscles protesting a little. He swallowed thickly and then turned back around to trail back to the bed, when he stopped.
"I think that's everything," Theo grumbled about ten minutes later as he came back from the store cupboard with, what he hoped, would be the last of the jars they needed.
He was bone tired and cold by the time he stepped off of the train, leather satchel in his hand, bumping against his knee, as he staggered awkwardly along the station, his legs feeling heavy and his head swimming through a fog as though he was disorientated and didn't know where he was going. Only, he did know. He could walk the familiar route blind-folded if he needed to. He pressed his eyes closed and drew in a long damp breath before exhaling and forcing himself to move out along the main road, keeping himself sheltered in the shadows of the buildings and shuffling his way along to the apothecary and the warm welcoming flat perched on top of it. As he drew nearer to the tall building looming up over him, he stopped on the opposite side of the street. His breathing was shaky, most likely a common cold creeping into his system. He was grateful he had a never ending supply of pepper-up in the storeroom. He ran a hand down his face and felt the energy ebb away. He didn't want to put on a brave but tired face as he went in to Draco. He didn't want to be anywhere near Brittany. He'd much prefer to return to Paris and work the nightshirt at the hospital just to avoid sleeping and the darkness pressing up through the lid of the box that he'd buried it in in the back of his mind.
Pansy furrowed her brow, looking between her blonde friend and then over to Potter who was conversing with Granger and Weasley most likely about something to do with their current workload, which had double in the last couple of weeks. She hummed to herself, "Well I suppose you could. Is it a date, or just to hang out together?"
With a heavy sigh he stood up from the warmth of the armchair and dragged himself over to the stairwell, opened the window and let the owl and a gust of frosty air inside. He shivered and drew his hoodie tighter around him as he unfolded the envelope, the owl hooting and disappearing back through the window without waiting for food or payment of any kind. Odd. He unfolded the little scrap of paper and held it over to the light so that he could read it properly.
Severus smirked, "Naturally. Now for the next six months you will be living here and when Draco is discharged he is going to be placed in the care of his parents for the time being. Now, I have already made arrangements for my old colleague, Horace Slughorn, to take over your duties at St. Evangelina's and also have said he can live in your apartment for six months whilst he settles back down in France and saves up enough for his own place. He will take care of your stock and replace anything he uses or takes. I have a full inventory already taken down so we will see if anything is missing later. When you eventually go back to work, I've established that Horace will be there to help you out. Sort of a partner, if you will. Nothing will be affected, just you will be working four days a week, instead of whenever you're called in, and I think, for now, the four-day-week will be good for you. You need time for yourself to decompress but we'll get to that stage," he stated as he waved the matter aside, "For now I will get you into a routine and get you healthy again and when I feel you are up for it, I'm going to slowly integrate you back into work and evaluate you progress."
For his part Harry tried to keep himself as busy as possible, his heart racing at the most menial of tasks and earning peculiar glances from Ronald and Dennis as he raced through each of the wards appointing new medicines and salves for severe curse burns and helping to ease some of the rambling patients in the spell-damage ward to quieten down and wash them manually. Some of the nurses tended to be lazy and scourgify them, but Harry found that that left them irritable and the skin became raw and red, almost like a rash. Harry didn't mind doing a few things manually. It was just the way that some people forgot that some hands-on things would work wonders if they were to lose their wands, which happened more often than not.
Blaise cocked a black eyebrow and bowed his head. It was decided; the following evening would be when the potion would be completed. It was only a matter of time before they could sneak the potion to Draco. The only question was how would they do it? The potion needed to come from Potter's own hand, to make it work properly. One of them needed to approach Potter in an nonthreatening manner in a public place.
There was a shift in weight, ever so slight, and soon Harry's left arm was coming up to rub weakly at his naked eyes. He blinked at the white blur around him and then dropped his gaze down. When he noticed Draco he jerked in surprise, his tired green eyes widening slightly. Draco felt his heart lurch as a ghost of a smile pulled at Harry's mouth. "You c-came," he rasped out.
The voile curtains were drawn across the tall windows, letting in a strained orange glow of the sunset into the room. It tinted everything with a burning glow that left him breathless as he deflated and leaned back against the door, clicking it shut behind him. Draco didn't shift or stir in his sleep. Taking the small salve from the bedside table he knelt down on Draco's mattress, feeling it sink underneath him, before he unfastened the ties of Draco's nightshirt and splayed them out, exposing the pale smooth skin. He swallowed thickly, feeling his body temperature rise up as he daubed his fingers with the yellow salve and started to rub it in soothing circles over Draco's chest. Almost immediately he could detect a change in the older man's breathing. As soon as the salve had soaked through into his chest cavity, Harry drew his wand out and performed another diagnostic spell to determine if Draco had caught the onset of a cold or a brand new fever. Thankfully both the tests were negative and he left out a soft sigh. He turned to place his wand and the salve on the bedside table and froze when he turned back around.
He touched a hand up to his lips, tracing a line over them, his eyes glistening with a hot torrent of tears that he would not -could not shed. He could not let himself cry.
Harry chuckled against his ear. "I was thinking maybe this year we could make love ... without magic."
Regardless, he knew that something needed to be done. He also knew that it was going to create a tidal wave of back lash if they were going to be successful. The other question, when it came down to it, was what exactly could be done that would be so subtle to actually work for Draco and Potter?
Harry was eager to show his independence as soon as his bath was over, he insisted on shuffling to the bedroom, wrapped in a towel, leaning his shoulder against the hallway walls for support as he maneuvered himself to their bedroom in order to dress. Draco had insisted that he should help but Harry had thrown him a weak glare over his shoulder before continuing. Draco had swallowed thickly, a small breeze whispering around his ankles before he turned to the now empty bathroom, the steam drifting about the atmosphere above his head. He removed the plug from the hole in the bottom of the bathtub and watched as the pipes gurgled and slurped the soapy water down greedily.
headquarters for the better part of a year. Even school wasn't a safe haven anymore, like it should have been." He looked into Harry's eyes with such an intense look that the brunette felt shivers running through him. "Only a world were there was no 'you' and he was the only one who ruled? Everyone would suffer like I had, maybe even more. So many people would have died. The worlds population would have diminished to at least a quarter of what it is now." He dipped his head so that blonde hair fell in front of his eyes making him appear both parts vulnerable and defensive. "So yes, I do know what it's like to not want to live in the world anymore. Because sometimes this world ... just isn't worth hanging onto."
Draco shook his head, "You didn't," he murmured and winced as Harry shifted to try and move away. Draco reached out and snatched the brunette's man's wrist, drawing him lower down towards him, "You don't need to go anywhere. You can sit here if you want."
"I'm going to slide inside you, alright?" Harry panted as he slowly stroked his own cock with firm fingers and continuing to coax Draco's entrance to relax a little looked up as Draco bit down on his bottom lip, his eyes averted and shining with unshed tears. He felt his heart convulse, "Am I –hurting you?" he asked softly, stopping his administrations to run a soothing hand up the blonde's stomach. He watched as the older man trembled beneath him and brought a quaking hand to cover the hushed sobs creaking out of his mouth. "Draco?" he breathed, not wanting to draw attention to the pain in his heart and no doubt the pain Draco was in at that moment. "Come on, Draco, what's wrong? Let me help you."
They'd been dragged all the way up here on the pretence of relaxing and to watch the boating festival on the 29th of August. He was pretty sure that Severus didn't care about the boats either but he refrained from saying so. It wasn't really his business. And he had to admit it did feel cooler near the lack than in the thickly packed streets of Paris and in the suffocating corridors of the hospital. Not that he'd really been going there until midday most days anyway. He felt as though he didn't have the courage once he'd stepped off the train every morning. He always went across the road from the station to a low rent bar and drank a couple of rounds of gin or whiskey and drown the throbbing in his head. He sighed through his nose and ran a hand through his hair, tugging slightly to waken him up a little more. Sometimes, when he was in the bar, the barmaid –Hermione –would lend a tentative ear and offered her opinions but sometimes he didn't even want to hear that. Sometimes he simply wanted to drink. He'd gotten quite drunk on the Sunday night when they'd returned from vising Draco's parents and Severus' little revelation that he knew about his and Draco's sordid little love affair –not that is was benefiting them at the moment. It didn't take too long for Severus to diagnose him with depression and had offered some therapy and some mood balancing potions, something Harry had been avoiding like the plague. He knew Draco had packed them in his own trunk but he still wasn't taking them. He'd take them into the bathroom and tip it down the sink and rinse it away.
Draco nodded with a small smile, "I was being incredibly stubborn at not wanting anything more than a basic correspondence, but that morning shifted everything into perspective for me."
The bath had been heavenly and he hadn't felt cleaner than he did in that moment. As soon as he settled down behind his warded curtains in the dorms, he took out the oil and hesitated a while before dabbing a spot behind each ear and placing the corked bottle under his pillow.
"Oh, Draco!" Harry panted out harshly into the blonde's ear as he buried his nose into the mattress, "I've missed making love to you."
Draco shrugged a stiff shoulder, "Those letters, I think. I read them and realised just how one-sided our relationship had been before that summer and I just –felt –like I needed to let you take the lead once in a while. More often than before at the very least."
Those words continued to ring in Harry's ears later that night as he settled down to sleep for the final night in their own hotel. Starting the following morning he would take on a workload of intensive training and studying in order to prepare for his upcoming exams. He just didn't realise how big a part Draco and his letters would play in keeping his sanity as well as getting him out of the stifling hospital a few times a month.
Harry huffed a small smile and wiped at his dampening eyes before looking up with a timid smile at Draco, "I kept all of your letters as well. I had them under my pillow whilst I slept. I think they helped me push on with the treatment and the therapy."
It wasn't too long before rumors started circulating, and it certainly didn't help what they were actually
Harry let his tense expression soften a little as he pushed the phial across the table, "I'm sorry," he murmured gently, "I know I need to try a little harder. Just take your tonic, would you?" he smiled a little brighter as he took a gulp of his butterbeer.
"I'm sorry I hurt you last night," he finally sighed as the chill rising from the lake made his skin break out in goosepimples.
It wasn't until later in the week one night as he lay in his bed with his heavily warded curtains shut tight around him, that Harry dug out the map from under his pillow and tapped the tip of his wand against the page, "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good," he recited in one breath, his heart beating a little faster. He studied the map for a while until his eyes came to rest on the small dot in the dungeons that was labelled 'DRACO MALFOY'. Like most nights before he'd stopped looking, the dot remained in the dungeons, not moving a millimetre. He was moments away from calling it a night -again -when the dot actually shifted and started to move. He watched it go along a series of corridors and then along the fifth floor, it suddenly disappeared. His heart rated spiked. He knew where Malfoy had gone but he still couldn't believe the blonde had the nerve to go there. He hadn't even braved the desolate room since the fire.
A few of the letters followed the same pattern, responding to questions and replying with other small facts about how each day varied from the next and generally how Harry had been feeling recently, and the hopeful tone he seemed to adopt whenever he reminisced about the old memories they shared in his letters to Draco. He remembered that he hadn't been too ecstatic about responding right away. He'd wanted to be optimistic and hopeful and reply with the same painstaking enthusiasm as Harry wrote to him, but he couldn't force the merriment out of him. His mind was formed with the dark blue rippling of his mind about that day. He didn't want to think about that specific day but he couldn't help how he felt. There were some days where he did write back with a smile on his face, but as soon as he had sealed the envelope he'd felt his stomach drop into his shoes. He ran a hand down his face and slouched a little in his embroidered chair, something he'd managed to bring with him from the manor. It was his old favourite from his room and he loved to trace a finger over the patterns absent-mindedly. A lot of the letters followed the same pattern. There were a few erratic ones, where Harry had a bad day or got agitated by something that Draco had written to him. Some were simply too frustrated.
The screech of the train against the rails echoed through the glass windows and grated on Harry's frail nerves. It had been a long weekend. He had gone to see Severus at the hospital with a package he'd packed of stronger salves that healed deep wounds a lot quicker with a sedative laced into it, in case there was any pain left behind, there were new potions for the consumption disease that was miles ahead of the ones the muggles had created, and they had managed to save numerous people. His name had been in the papers for a good few weeks after they'd created the stronger potion as the morality rate of the wizarding community had drastically improved in the last five years since Harry had passed his exams. Draco's own health seemed to be less of a burden on both of their minds although it was a constant black shadow that followed Harry around, dogging his steps and taunting him during the long nights down in the potions lab in the back room. When the weather started to get like how it was now, it would be like old people with arthritis; harder to move and harder to breathe; increase irritability and lack of energy. Harry did his best to make the blonde man as comfortable as possible, but sometimes he felt as though he was losing his firm hold on the life around him.
He looked like a distressed child and Draco actually felt somewhat sorry for him once his humour had died down a little. He leaned over and touched a hand to his companions shoulder, "Come on then, let's just go out into the gardens. We can bring some of your journals as well and sit underneath one of the blossom trees by the pond."
He snapped his head up and mentally cursed his luck. He groaned and clenched his jaw tightly, "Stop trying to be a damned hero Potter. I get it. You won. No need to come and gloat."
Harry blinked in surprise and hesitated a moment before licking his lips, "A boat ride?" he repeated, confusion lacing his words.
If anyone noticed just how withdrawn and tired both Harry and Draco looked the following morning, nobody made a show of commenting or even noticing it as they all settled down in the garden for a bright summer morning breakfast with Narcissa and Severus. Lucius had been called away earlier for a meeting with the French politicians of the wizarding community. Not that anyone minded too much. As shrewd as his mother could be, Narcissa knew when to bring up the heavy topics and as she had long since given up on getting her own son married off to a nice young heiress, not many of the other subjects should have made them tense up. However, it appeared that they had gotten to the stage in their tense relationship that
Harry wrinkled his nose, completely unused to the smell of muggle condoms and just how greasy they were. Draco hadn't shifted from his spot, which was probably a wise idea seeing as he was still covered in their love-making. His skin has started to prickle with goosepimples. The blonde man flinched under his hand as Harry carefully wiped his body down. "How're you feeling?" Harry asked, his throat so hoarse from giving head and all the moaning.
Draco turned with surprised raised eyebrows for a moment before he schooled his features into his previous smirking mask, "Oh? And how are you a small person in the eyes of society, young Harold?"
"I'm trying but sometimes I really wish I could just stun some of them, or spell their mouths shut," Hermione muttered, hanging her head and sighing deeply.
"Oh, you're apprenticing underneath Snape?" Draco's voice held a note of interest and approval for which something warm swelled within Harry's chest. "Oh, he is certainly a great teacher you should learn a lot from here I dare say." He sipped from his flute.
The grin that spread of Harry's face was more than enough compensation for it. His stomach flipped when he saw it. "I love you too!" he called back with a wink, before he turned on his heel and hurried back to Gryffindor Tower whilst Draco turned and quickly descended the stairs to the dungeons.
No, he had decided there and then that he was not having children anytime soon. However, at this announcement, Harry had not necessarily been thrilled about it. In fact, he had to admit that the brunette man had become even more broody. The smile on his face was beautiful as he held one of Hermione's babies –he had not smiled that way in a while. Not to him, at least. Everyone else got to see that beautiful smile, but when they returned home it vanished into nothing but a neutral expression.
Harry decided that was about as good as he was going to get for that morning, so he slipped out one of his first ever medical journals to study, flipped it open on his lap, and started to read.
Harry felt something stir painfully in his chest. He didn't want to think about poor old Arthur who hadn't made it, no matter what he had tried to do. It was hard not to become friends with the elderly red-haired man. He was ever so charming, always prattling about how fascinating the muggles were. Harry had enjoyed taking care of him until that ground breaking morning when he had gone in and found a nurse stripping down Arthur's bed and vanishing the dirty sheets with a lazy flick of her wand before casting another spell to have clean sheets and pillowcases onto the bed, ready for the new patient. It had hurt as he'd watched the nurse carry on about her day as though Arthur had never existed. He shouldn't have let it affect him so much, especially when he dealt with dead peoples bodies every day, so why did Arthur make him suffer so greatly? Maybe it was because despite being old and frail and suffering from something that had turned out to be incurable, he had taken every day with a pinch of salt, enjoyed everything around him and never ceased to find something wonderful to tell Harry about, even if it was simply how wonderful the porridge had been that morning.
Blaise huffed as he adjusted his bag on his shoulder as his class was dismissed from the potions classroom.
"What do you fancy doing this morning?" Harry asked softly, as he swung their hands between them, a sea-gull cawing overhead.
He felt his heartbeat racing in his chest as he turned the doorknob and pushed the door open. As usual the room that greeted him was small, quaint and had nothing in it but an armchair, and a small side table facing a cosy fireplace. The blonde looked around in the armchair and smiled when he saw Harry. "Hey," he smiled as he scooted over a little on the armchair. The given space wasn't much, but Harry didn't mind. It would mean getting to touch the blonde a little more. He settled down and curled his legs up before glancing over the blonde's shoulder, "Potions again? I'd think you'd know the syllabus back to front by now."
It wasn't until a month later that Harry Potter had had just about enough of ignoring the niggling feeling at the back of his mind. He kept his eye on Draco Malfoy, a mild obsession Hermione had called it, and couldn't deny that something was going on. He couldn't deny that it would irrational of him to think that the pale blonde would be up to anything sinister, especially with how pathetically rough he'd been looking lately, but that didn't mean that nothing was going on. Admittedly, he had done pretty well; he hadn't been sneaking glances at the blonde too often, in class or in the corridors, and he hadn't been up during the night watching the marauders map to see if the Slytherin slunk off anywhere in the middle of the night. Especially as the few times he had done that, Draco literally didn't move from within the Slytherin boy dorms.
Draco shook his head firmly, "never ugly Harry," he breathed leaning onto the bed, careful not to tug any wires, and pressed a warm, lingering kiss to Harry's head, "if anything this makes you prettier, it highlights your big round green eyes."
Harry was a little surprised but tried not to show it too much. He swallowed thickly and thought back to that night a whole year ago and tried to think of the words to describe just how ethereal it had been. He chewed on his lip and was grateful that Draco didn't stare at him until he fessed up like Hermione would have, or been humming with dread like Ron.
Draco did as he was told. Pressed into the mattress he felt completely crushed. His dick was raw from the friction of the cotton sheets and between his legs was drenched with sweat and pre-cum. Harry tenderly reached over and eased the blonde onto his back, smoothing his tan hands down the muscular thighs. "God, you look gorgeous!" he gushed.
"About us. I'll write about our life ... For Harry. He gave her a glance over his shoulder, "it's what Harry wanted me to do for him."
Draco hesitated for a moment, the icy feeling in his stomach hardening and making his heart sink. Pansy looked over her shoulder and then exchanged a look with Blaise. The dark-skinned teen reached out and placed a hand on the blonde's shoulder, "Come on, Draco. It'll be fine." With another squeeze on his shoulder, they managed to ease Draco down into the dungeons for their Potions lesson.
Harry himself, the shame and fear and everything else he had kept bottled up for over a year whilst he lived in the manor with Voldemort came lashing out, tearing Harry's skin apart and letting his own blood stain the flagstones.
"Harry," the brunette corrected, trying not to let any measure of annoyance ebb into his voice, "And I am just here as a Healers apprentice from Calais for the weekend. I'm not really on any level of society, but I am training to be a healer so that I can be as decent as Snape, if I can be."
Draco looked like he wanted to snap an answer, but whatever retort it was he swallowed it and delivered a much calmer response, "For now. Let's just see how things go and maybe, in a few months, we can try talking again."
"So that I can take care of your health; I have already arranged it with St. Evangelina's and it has been granted that you are to be placed on sabbatical until at you are certified to work again."
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Well if it makes you feel any better, I'm not saying I hate it." A muscle twitched in Harry's jaw. "However, it is incredibly messy."
Severus leaned back in his chair and frowned, "How long has this been going on?" he asked in a controlled voice his eyes unwavering from the younger man.
‘There’s a chance we might be called to testify against her,’ Malfoy sighed. ‘To explain what we found.’
Malfoy tipped over the edge first, his hips stuttering, losing their rhythm, as he shuddered against Harry. The knowledge that Malfoy was coming, spilling inside his fancy trousers because of Harry, was too much for Harry, and he followed suit, coming to sound of Malfoy groaning his name. He collapsed back against the wall, eyes closed, shivers of pleasure rushing over his skin, his brain unable to process the complicated mix of pleasure and lingering lust and guilt he felt. He could hear Malfoy straightening his clothes, felt the magic in the air as he cast a cleaning charm on himself, but Harry kept his eyes closed, too scared to open them and see Malfoy. If he kept his eyes closed, he could avoid facing this for just a little bit longer.
‘I’d tell you to suck my cock,’ Potter says, his voice stronger, firmer. He’s standing straighter now, his eyes no longer shocked but instead darker, a hint of want in them. Draco doesn’t miss the way Potter says
‘Yeah,’ Malfoy agreed, and Harry could see his hand visibly shaking as he ran it through his hair. Seeing Malfoy so clearly concerned made Harry’s fear worse.
Potter starts to swear as he gets nearer his climax, biting down on Draco’s shoulder just enough to send a frisson of pleasure-pain through him, and Draco is so close to coming.
‘I think I spent about a year and a half, maybe even longer, I’m not sure, doing not very much at all. I half-tried to sort out Grimmauld Place, but there was so much to do it was overwhelming. I spent a lot of time walking around London, or Apparating out to the countryside and just walking for hours through fields. I think I just needed to switch my brain off completely, you know?’ Malfoy nodded when Harry paused.
On those long, lonely Friday nights, Harry had fantasised about what it might be like if he slept with Malfoy again, wanking endlessly to dreams of feeling Malfoy’s skin against his own. He’d imagined that they’d take it slow, taking their time to explore each other’s bodies in ways that they hadn’t been able to before, taking each other apart slowly in the comfort of a bed. All those dreams fell by the wayside, though, when Malfoy slipped a hand under the hem of Harry’s t-shirt.
Draco’s hand tangled in Harry’s hair as Harry opened his mouth wide, taking Draco’s cock down as far as it would go before pulling off and repeating the action. Harry slipped one of his hands under Draco’s shirt, feeling the hot skin and muscle hidden there as he began to suck Draco’s cock in earnest. His other hand wrapped around the base of Draco’s cock, his mouth meeting it again and again as he did his best to drive Draco mad. Judging by the way Draco’s hand was rhythmically clenching in Harry’s hair, and the way his hips were moving to meet Harry’s mouth with tiny thrusts, it was working. Draco’s moans and pants filled the air, and Harry revelled in it.
Malfoy cut Harry off with a wave of his hand. ‘Water under the bridge, Potter. Not like I didn’t deserve it.’ And then, when Harry opened his mouth, Malfoy hurriedly kept talking, moving the subject back to his reasons for going into Healing. ‘The main reason, though, I suppose, was that I wanted to do something good. I’d spent so much of my life surrounded by monsters, unable or unwilling to do anything other than what they asked of me, and it sickened me to think of what I’d been involved in. To think about the things I’d done, or nearly done.’
Grace disappeared through the door, but before Malfoy could follow, Harry called out to him. Malfoy’s name was out of his mouth before Harry had really thought through what he was doing, and he hurried to think of something to say.
Draco’s only respite came when Harry went and put some pizzas in the oven for their dinner. But even that was short lived as when he came back with their food he also brought a blanket, pulling it across all of their legs. It was so intimate and domestic, sitting under a blanket pressed against Harry while they ate, and Draco found himself drifting into a fantasy world where this was his life, where he shared these kinds of evenings with Harry all the time. They watched two films this way; Harry a steady presence next to Draco, the tension building between them with every glance they exchanged. Draco knew something was going to happen—it surely had to, after all this—but he had no idea when. He found himself waiting either for the perfect moment, or for Harry to take the lead again.
‘They do have rules, yes. No marrying Half-bloods, Muggle-borns, or Muggles of course.’ Draco took a deep breath, and added; ‘and no marrying men, either.’
They dressed quietly, occasionally exchanging tentative excited smiles, a new peace settling over them as Harry helped Draco shut the cafe down, extinguishing the fire, turning out the lights. Just before they left the cafe, Harry took Draco’s hand, and they walked out the door to discover snow had begun to fall sometime while they had been otherwise occupied. It was the most romantic moment of Draco’s life, sex in front of the fire followed by walking in the snow hand in hand with the man he thought he could one day truly love.
Harry was achingly hard already, and he ground his hips against Malfoy’s, his stomach twisting with excitement when Malfoy rocked back against him. The friction and the knowledge that Malfoy was as into this as Harry felt incredible, but Harry wanted more. Pulling back to give Malfoy the chance to stop him, Harry pushed Malfoy’s robes off his shoulder, the dark blue fabric puddling at their feet, before moving a shaking hand to the top button of his shirt.
Draco let out a deep groan as Harry swallowed him whole, the smooth wetness of his throat making Draco throb.
Draco hadn't pushed the matter but instead he kept receiving secret letters from Harry. For the most part they were general anecdotes about a new thing Severus was letting him do each week, even if it was to help Slughorn in the office for one hour an afternoon, it seemed to bring back a childlike enthusiasm to Harry's words that Draco hadn't realised he'd missed so much until he'd read the letter sent to him at the very end of January.
Unfortunately for Potter, Draco was on point on the morning before the First Task as he brushed by Potter rather forcefully and quickly hissed in his ear, "Since you're such a Quidditch player maybe you'd fancy a ride on my broom?"
Draco's eyes were open and his breathing was a little more laboured at the sight of Harry clothed in only a nightshirt and dressing down perched on the edge of his bed. "I'm sorry," Harry breathed, not really knowing why he was whispering, "I didn't mean to wake you up."
Draco stared down at him with steady grey eyes, "Harry, it isn't up to me to judge you for what you did or why you did it. You cannot go back and stop yourself from committing said actions. All that you need to know is that ten years later I am here with you now, letting you make love to me, and loving you as much as I can, and telling you that it is okay to let go of the guilt. You don't need it anymore. I'm here and I'm not leaving you. I am nearly in my fifties, Harry, do not make me beg for you to keep loving me."
Pansy pursed her lips, glaring daggers at her friend. Across the table from them, Theo's face had paled considerably as his shaking fingers reached to spoon more potatoes onto his plate. Huffing, Pansy dropped her gaze back down to her face and continued to grumble to herself. "Well we still need to determine whether the potion worked or not. He hasn't been acting any different than he usually does."
Those words hardly made Harry relax as he allowed Draco to push him down against the pillows; threading a leg between the chilled tanned ones and feeling Harry tense up beside him. He wanted so desperately for the younger man to relax and to trust him and to want this as much as he wanted it. He ran his hand over the nightshirt, not wanting to go underneath the fabric and frighten his companion. Above all Harry was afraid, but after the way he had cared for Draco and spent so much time with him, he couldn't think of what would truly hinder their friendship. He wasn't sure about how kissing the blonde would be a progression or a regression, but he couldn't deny that no one had said anything for ten minutes and he'd been staring at the blonde's pale pink lips. He licked his one lips and didn't object when Draco rested his head down in front of his, sharing the same pillow, and almost touching noses.
The slide of his cock into Malfoy was slow and blissful, the sensation different and even better than he’d imagined it would be. He had to close his eyes tightly against the sensation as his orgasm threatened to overtake him, holding still and trying to distract himself until the immediate rush of pleasure ebbed slightly. Malfoy began to move first, shifting his hips, pushing back against Harry as he started to thrust forward. As their movements picked up speed, Harry’s world narrowed to just them, and the feeling of Malfoy’s body around his cock, and the heat of his back against Harry’s chest. He leaned forward, pressing their bodies even tighter together, that distinctive Malfoy smell surrounding him, the alley filling with the sound of their groans and harsh breathing. Needing to touch more of Malfoy, Harry grabbed one of the hands Malfoy had pressed against the wall, interlocking their fingers. It was the most intimate, affectionate,
‘I would like that very much,’ Draco says, not even trying to stop the smile that spreads across his face.
Harry knew he should get up, get showered, go and join them, but he couldn’t move. The adrenaline of the match was rapidly fading, and awareness of how tired his body was encroaching. Later, he would go and celebrate with the team, drink and dance and revel in their achievement, but for now the peace of the empty locker room was a welcome reprieve.
It’s so good, after Potter’s endless teasing, and Draco wants more. He drops his head onto his hands and arches his back, showing Potter how much he wants this. Potter takes the hint, and suddenly his fingers are slippery with lube, the crackle of magic hanging in the air from his spell. Draco’s always loved the sensation of magic, and Potter’s spell is so powerful that the lingering magic skitters along Draco’s skin, goosebumps appearing in its wake.
For the first time since they’d started doing this, Malfoy didn’t immediately leave the alleyway. He looked nearly as wrecked as Harry felt, his shirt creased from the vigour of their fucking, his eyes wild. Seeing Malfoy like this, pleasure-rumpled, his cheeks still pink, his defences down, made Harry’s stomach squirm. When it became clear that Malfoy wasn’t in any hurry to go anywhere, Harry leant against the wall, his legs still trembling slightly from their exertions as he moved. It was a bit of a relief, to be standing next to Malfoy rather than in front of him, where he could look at Harry directly. Harry was far too aware of what his face might be giving away, and he wasn’t sure he could bear it if Malfoy addressed it. Thankfully, Malfoy stayed quiet, the two of them leaning against the wall in silence. They were close, nearly close enough to touch, and Harry fought the urge to cross the divide between them and take Malfoy’s hand again. They weren’t like that, didn’t do things like talk or hold hands or cuddle after fucking. But tonight seemed to be a night for new things, because after long minutes of silence, Malfoy spoke.
‘It’ll be good for Healer Malfoy, too, to have a break from so much overtime,’ Esther said. ‘He’s looking exhausted, poor man.’
They said very little as they washed off sweat from their exertions— and the grime of the pitch, too, in Harry’s case—pausing to share lingering kisses and gentle touches. Harry’s exhaustion was flooding back in full force, the adrenaline of the match and the all-consuming desire replaced by sleepy contentment. He couldn’t stop his eyes from sliding shut as Draco rubbed shower gel over his tired muscles. He was reluctant to leave the shower and the warmth of the water that still surrounded them, but at Draco’s urging he did so. They talked quietly as they dried off and dressed, Draco unable to resist asking how Harry’s hip was feeling, even though he hadn’t been his Healer for months now.
His eyes had fallen shut as he came, so he felt rather than saw Malfoy swallow and then release him, heard the creaks of floorboards as Malfoy stood, felt the crackle of magic in the air and across his skin as Malfoy cast cleaning charms over them and the floor. The sensation of Malfoy’s magic on his skin only added to the pleasurable aftershocks still running through Harry, the particular tenor of Malfoy’s magic familiar now from their afternoon of working together. He thought that he’d be able to recognise it anywhere now, its tones and colours etched into Harry’s skin.
‘She’s very well, although Edward is keeping her busy.’ Draco hated how his mother refused to call Teddy by his nickname—everyone else did, after all, and it always took Draco a minute to figure out who she meant by ‘Edward’—but she insisted that it was only proper to use his full name.
‘Great,’ Harry said, smiling up at Malfoy to confirm that his words were genuine. He was never quite sure if he was able to convey enthusiastic agreement without sounding painfully sarcastic instead. But Malfoy seemed to get the message, as he smiled back at Harry. His eyes darted down to Harry’s mouth briefly, and Harry’s stomach twisted again.
‘Yes!’ Hermione jumped on the new subject, looking as relieved as Harry felt to have moved on from Malfoy and Ron’s suspicion. ‘We weren’t sure how long you’d be here for so we’ve brought you a selection.’
‘I don’t,’ Potter spits out, and Draco can’t help but smile. Potter’s in the game now, and experience tells Draco that Potter won’t back down without a fight.
‘A few months?! What the fuck, Harry?’ Ginny sank back down onto her chair, dropping her head into her hands, her long hair falling around her face, shielding her from Harry. ‘How could you?’ she added, so quietly that Harry almost didn’t hear.
‘Good, you’re finally here,’ was the first thing Harry heard when he appeared in the front garden of an innocuous looking cottage.
‘Okay,’ Harry said, raising his good hand in a strange half wave as Malfoy left, immediately dropping his head back onto his pillow when the door shut in despair at himself.
‘Yes, everything’s in order, Harry’s ready to go home,’ she replied, looking curiously at Malfoy, and Harry was glad to see that he wasn’t the only one who’d noticed that something was off.
‘Can you feel it, Teddy?’ he asked, knowing that Teddy wasn’t likely to be feeling it as easily as Harry was.
As soon as he finished writing, and before he could talk himself out of it, Harry rolled up the parchment and attached it to his owl’s leg. Moments later, Aurora was flying off into the inky twilight, Harry’s last hope attached securely to her leg.
A few strokes later, and Harry was done for. A burst of white hot pleasure rushed through him, lighting up his nerve endings, and he groaned loudly, spilling over his hand. He dropped his forehead to the wall as the aftershocks raced through him, the cool tile a stark contrast to his hot skin. He lifted his head and turned just in time to see Draco come, his release marking the tiled floor of the shower before being immediately washed away by the water. Draco in the throes of pleasure was one of the most incredible things Harry had ever seen, his hair plastered to his head by the shower, his eyes screwed tightly shut, his mouth open on a silent cry, his head tilted back exposing the acres of skin on his neck that Harry so loved to kiss and bite. It was enough to make Harry’s cock attempt to stir again, but instead he reached out a hand, helping Draco off the floor and into his arms.
‘This is good, so good,’ Harry started to say, a pit of dread forming in Draco’s stomach as he waited for the ‘but’. ‘I want to do this, want more, I promise, I just can’t, not with Teddy here, not while this is so new.’
Three weeks pass this way, with Draco pretending that nothing is different and praying that time will wash away the memory of Potter inside him, all the while aching with the knowledge that he’s had as much of Potter as he’ll ever get.
‘Goodbye, then,’ Malfoy said, and then he was gone, and Harry was left alone, in the room where they’d fucked, the room where he’d betrayed his wife.
‘Yeah,’ Harry confirmed after a moment. He didn’t want to tell Malfoy anything, but he was also desperate to get out of the hospital and withholding information that was clearly in his chart would only make him look petty. ‘At Hogwarts, when Lockhart Vanished my arm bones, and then a few times since after Quidditch injuries.’
‘Good morning, what can I get you?’ he said, falling into his regular sales patter in the hopes that it would hide the shock he was still feeling.
‘Shut the door,’ Harry said, turning round to look at Draco, his heart racing as he prepared to risk everything.
‘No problem, mate, got to get you better quickly. I’ve got a bet on Puddlemere to win the League, too, and they aren’t going to do that without you there,’ Ron said, clapping Harry on the shoulder and making him wince as his slowly mending bones protested.
Harry’s arms wrapped around Malfoy and pulled him in closer as their lips met in a blistering kiss, need rushing through Harry with incredible speed. Malfoy crowded Harry back until he was pressed against the wall, the sensation familiar from all their alleyway trysts. All of Harry’s good intentions to talk to Malfoy, to explain how he was feeling, to find out whether Malfoy might feel the same, vanished as Malfoy ground their crotches together, drawing a moan out of Harry.
‘Probably,’ Malfoy agreed, his frown making it clear that he was as unhappy with this turn of events as Harry was. ‘I’ll need to send a Patronus to Astoria so she knows to go on to Pansy’s without me.’
Harry waved his wand as they entered the room, the lamps on the bedside tables flaring into life, and then dropped it, not caring where it rolled away to, when he felt Malfoy’s hands at his flies. Malfoy’s practiced fingers soon had Harry’s jeans pushed down to his thighs, and Harry rushed to help, stripping them and his boxers off, leaving him bare. At that, Malfoy paused, his eyes roaming over Harry’s bared skin, and Harry let him look for a moment, then reached out and undid Malfoy’s trousers, needing to see him too, to discover everything that the dark alley had hidden from him.
‘I debated joining the Aurors—Kingsley offered me a spot straight after the war, and said the offer stood for whenever I was ready, but I couldn’t face the thought of more fighting. Hermione kept encouraging me to apply for different things, or set up a foundation or something, but nothing felt right.’
Harry nodded, knowing from the steely expression on Malfoy’s face that there was no point arguing, and if he was being honest, his leg really was aching, and a rest in bed sounded very tempting. He felt a pang of sadness, though, as they started walking very slowly back to his room and Malfoy kept his distance, his demeanor scrupulously professional. Harry was worried that whatever had been building between them had been broken.
The jingle of the bell above the door broke him out of his quiet reverie, and Draco looked up to once again find himself face to face with Harry Potter.
As Harry was starting to pack up his things, Esther knocked on his door. When she’d first introduced herself to him, she’d reminded him forcibly of Mrs Weasley, apart from her shock of bright pink hair, which was so Tonks-like it sent a sudden pang of sadness through Harry. Along with Grace and Malfoy, Esther had taken on the bulk of his care, and she seemed to have developed quite a soft spot for him, always gently chastising him when she thought he was overextending himself with his recovery. He’d miss her, although not quite as much as he’d miss Malfoy.
He lets the pleas fall from his lips, telling Potter just how much he wants him, how desperately he needs to feel Potter press into him, his cock opening him up and pounding into him until he’s mindless with pleasure.
‘Definitely,’ Harry said, and this time he was being honest. ‘I’ve missed it, and the team. It’ll be good for me to get back up in the air.’
His interruption seemed to break through Ginny’s initial burst of anger, and she deflated slightly, the rage giving way to something worse, something more akin to sadness, and that only made Harry feel even worse. The last thing he’d wanted to do throughout all of this was hurt Ginny.
‘I showered when I came home. A customer decided to spill dragon blood on both of us just before I closed for the day.’
Harry’s stomach flipped over as Malfoy moved closer, so close that Harry could see every pale eyelash, and the flecks of blue in his eyes. Malfoy was slightly taller than Harry, and it was as he slowly bent down that Harry was hit with the realisation of what they were about to do. His gaze flicked down from Malfoy’s eyes to his mouth, and then Malfoy’s lips were on his.
‘It was one of my earliest cases as Healer-in-Charge. I think they thought I’d fail, and that any bad press that might have been directed towards the hospital could be directed my way instead. The press would have been more than happy at any suggestion that I wasn’t capable of doing my job.’ A shadow crossed Malfoy’s face, his lips twisting into a sarcastic smile that was more akin to a grimace. ‘But I didn’t fail, and the patient recovered far quicker than anyone had anticipated.’ The grimace was gone, and in its place was a small smile that spoke to Harry of Malfoy’s pleasure at confounding expectations, and no small amount of pride in the results of his work, too.
‘Mm,’ Malfoy hummed, coming closer and peering down at Harry’s wrist as he cast a diagnostic spell. ‘Your hip will have to wait a few more days, but I see no reason to delay starting work on your wrist.’
Draco seemed to be just as into it as Harry, as he pulled Harry in even tighter, every inch of their bodies pressing together, heat rushing through Harry as he felt just how much Draco was enjoying this. Without breaking the kiss, Harry slowly walked them backwards until they hit one of the sofas, pushing Draco down until he was lying on his back, Harry quickly covering him, unwilling to lose contact for any longer than necessary. Harry’s hips involuntarily began to move, chasing the friction his body was craving. The room filled with the sounds of them gasping into each other’s mouths as they moved together, the feel of Draco’s body against his so incredible, but not nearly enough for Harry.
were lessons that all pure-blood children took, led by the oldest male in the family, so that they knew what was expected of them and understood pure-blood culture. Draco had undertaken them himself as a child. In the years since the war, however, Draco had begun to realise what a disservice his parents had done him, raising him to believe in his own superiority over everyone who wasn’t pure-blooded. The crimes he had committed in the name of those beliefs still sickened him. Even though he had long ago served his punishment and spent the following years working hard to try and make amends for what he’d done, he could never shake the shame of what he did in the name of ‘tradition’. The thought of teaching those same toxic beliefs and ideals to an innocent child made his stomach turn.
But Potter’s control is back, even though his face is pink and his breathing is harsh, and he swiftly takes the lead. He pushes Draco’s t-shirt off, dropping it on the floor before bending to flick Draco’s nipple with his tongue. He doesn’t stop there though, licking his way down Draco’s stomach until he reaches the waistband of his joggers. Potter’s fingers slip just under the waistband, stroking the sensitive skin of Draco’s hips and stomach, and Draco doesn’t think he can take it.
‘We were. But then—,’ Malfoy paused, before continuing, ‘but then I slept with you, and then I did it again, and again, and that changed everything. We’d always said we’d continue with our arrangement until it didn’t work anymore, and several weeks ago Astoria sat me down and said it wasn’t working anymore, that she couldn’t be married to me while I was in love with someone else.’
The touch, when it finally comes, is feather light and yet lights sparks under Draco’s skin. Potter’s finger traces a line down Draco’s spine, bouncing over each vertebra before slipping between his cheeks to stroke ever so gently over Draco’s arsehole. It’s enough to have him gasping with a need more intense than a single finger should provoke.
‘I mean, I wouldn’t rule it out, but apparently it doesn’t matter whether he’s Muggle or pure-blood.’ Harry shrugged, the way his eyes met Draco’s as he confirmed his suspicions making Draco’s heart flip. Draco didn’t say anything in response, just nodded and let a small smile spread across his face, a smile which was met by a much larger one from Harry, and they lapsed into silence, watching Teddy play. The knowledge that Harry was gay too had a curious sensation of hope blossoming in Draco’s stomach, a sensation that he tried to tamp down—however curious he might be about Harry and however attractive he did admittedly find him, nothing was going to happen, ever.
‘Uh,’ Harry stalled, wondering whether he could claim he had said something else, before deciding there was no other way to take what he had said. ‘We could go together. To the ball, I mean.’
‘Excellent,’ Malfoy said flatly, avoiding Harry’s eyes and instead picking up his chart, flicking through it distractedly.
When the knock on the door finally came, Harry jumped at the noise in the otherwise silent house. Harry had hoped he’d come, but as the day had passed with no visit, he’d tried to accept that Malfoy wasn’t coming, that the news hadn’t meant anything to him. His heart pounding in his chest, Harry rushed to open the door, terrified in case it was Malfoy on the other side of the door, and terrified that it wouldn’t be.
‘The papers thankfully quickly lost interest in us, but understandably no one would hire me. For a while I just floated, not sure what to do with myself, occupied with making sure Mother was coping as well as she possibly could, but eventually it became clear I’d need to do something if we didn’t want to run out of money. I didn’t want to do something
Once they had done as requested, Harry quickly stripped off his clothes, his butterflies returning with a vengeance at just the thought of being in his boxers in the same room as Draco. He put on the dress robes, the fiddly buttons taking a few minutes to do up, before turning to the mirrors and clearing his throat to let Millie know he was ready. Millie immediately moved over and began fussing with the fabric, shifting it around and adjusting where it sat on Harry’s shoulders, a tape measure appearing from nowhere to measure the length of his arm and his waist, but Harry barely noticed any of it. He couldn’t drag his attention away from Draco, who was staring at Harry, his eyes slowly, leisurely trailing down Harry’s body, Harry’s nerves alighting wherever Draco’s gaze touched. Draco’s mouth was slightly open, as if in shock, and his pupils were wide, the heat in them making Harry’s blood boil. Draco had clearly not noticed Harry looking, and Harry found himself wondering whether he’d missed gazes like this before. He’d only just had his eyes opened to the possibility of an attraction between them, but had Draco been aware of it for much, much longer?
‘So you’re going to hire Teddy a tutor?’ Draco couldn’t believe Narcissa would do such a thing, that she would trust someone outside of the family.
And then Potter is gone, the sound of the door shutting behind him echoing in the silence of the hotel room, and Draco just stands there, naked, come drying itchily on his skin, a strange sadness creeping into his soul.
‘Oh good, you’re finally here,’ he said, gesturing at Harry to come into the other room. ‘Merlin knows why you would want to walk, it’s horrible out there.’
Potter casts the spells—Draco normally prefers to do things manually but right now he’s grateful for anything that gets Potter in him quicker—and then he’s taking Draco, right there in the window, for all of Paris to see.
awesome, so much more than he ever dreamed it could be, the magic still resonating in his body as he reached out and clasped Harry’s hand, watching as the manifestations of their hopes, dreams, and happiness gambolled together in this sacred place. Harry’s eyes were bright when Draco looked at him, joy written on every line of his face, an undercurrent of want, of need, visible as his gaze flicked down to Draco’s lips, his hand gripping Draco’s tightly.
‘Well we aren’t doing anything Muggle today… but I suppose you could still come with us,’ Draco hurriedly added as Harry’s face began to fall. He didn’t much like the idea of trying to explain pure-blood marriage traditions to someone like Harry who would clearly be very sceptical if not outright rude about them—they might be old fashioned, but they were a central part of the way Draco had been raised to view the world—but something in him hated the idea of saying no and disappointing Harry.
Malfoy’s pace slowed down even further as he looked intently at Harry, his expression thoughtful. ‘Now I’m not so sure. I’ve not had much luck in love myself, but there’s a part of me that has hope that one day I’ll get to experience a better kind of love.’
‘This was-,’ Harry paused, and Draco began to panic. He knew what came after those words. ‘This was incredible.’
‘No, Harry,’ she shouted over him, standing up with such force that the legs of her chair scraped loudly across the floor. ‘You don’t get to ‘Gin’ me, not anymore. Not when I’ve seen you with your cock up Draco fucking Malfoy’s arse, of all people.’
‘Muggle London?’ Harry couldn’t disguise the surprise in his voice. Going to live among Muggles seemed a rather drastic move for someone who had just fought in a war on the side of
‘Not sure,’ Harry said. ‘A few weeks, maybe? Think I’ll have to do some rehab before I can fly properly again, particularly on my hip.’ Harry hated the idea of taking so much time out, but early in his career he’d rushed back after an injury, and had ended up sitting out half the season as a result. He wasn’t going to make that mistake again, not when they had a chance at winning the League this year.
‘Huh,’ Harry said, frustratingly giving Draco no indication of what he thought of Draco’s monologue. ‘If you want to make the lessons more interesting, maybe you should show him stuff rather than just tell him.’
‘Yeah,’ Harry said emphatically. Of course he wanted to, both because wanted to get better, and because it meant more time with Malfoy.
‘Too busy going to funerals and trying to get my head around the fucking war I’d just lived through, actually.’
Both smiling slightly, they lapsed into silence, and Draco felt as though something had shifted between them, a warm bubble of contentment mixed with excitement settling in his chest.
‘I meant the disgustingly attractive part actually,’ Harry said, a faint stain of a blush appearing on his cheekbones.
Draco ran a hand through his hair as he tried to decide how to respond, ignoring the pointed look his mother sent his way at his now less than pristine appearance. The
After several weeks of stilted conversation followed by feigned ignorance of each other’s existence, everything changed. It was late, nearly closing time, and all Draco’s other customers had left, heading home to families or out to meet friends for dinner. Draco had given up on seeing Harry that day - he never came this late, and only someone who desperately wanted to spend all night wide awake would risk drinking coffee at this time of day. Draco was finishing wiping down the counter and the machines, preparing to leave for the day, when Harry surprised him by pushing open the door, a harried expression on his face.
‘Merlin, Potter, are you ever going to actually fuck me?’ Draco snaps, need rendering him incapable of hiding his frustration.
thing they’d done since this began. They were quick blowjobs and messy handjobs in dirty alleyways, not hand-holding and cuddles, and Harry knew he was on dangerous territory, conflating the two, but he couldn’t stop himself.
‘Shouldn’t you be off drinking, rather than napping?’ came an amused voice from the doorway to the locker room. The sound of the door closing gently was followed by quiet footsteps, and Harry opened his eyes to see Draco walking over to him.
Nothing changed, at least at first. They both replied to their invitations, confirming that they would be attending the ball, and then slipped back into their usual work routine, all consumed by the case that was rapidly reaching its conclusion. They made a good team, their strengths and weaknesses combining to make them one of the most successful teams on the force. Draco was surprisingly on board with Harry’s tendency to bend the rules, and they were often on such a similar wavelength that it was as though they could read each other’s mind. To Harry’s great surprise, not only had they made good partners, they also became great friends, occasional lunches together at work blossoming into drinks in the pub after a hard day, and their friendship had only grown as their sons had become firm friends. They had supported each other through Astoria’s death and the breakdown of Harry’s marriage, the tough times bringing them closer together, and helping them get to a point where the troubles of their early years were forgotten.
That first conversation had been like a dam opening, and now Potter barely shuts up when they meet. He’s far more vocal during sex than Draco would have guessed, a litany of moans and dirty talk filling the room whenever he’s inside Draco, but he talks afterwards, too. It’s like an orgasm removes his internal filter, and soon Draco knows more about Potter’s post-war life than he’d ever imagined he would. He knows all about Potter’s failed attempt to join the Aurors, and how he’d found something close to happiness in playing Quidditch. He hears more about Weasley and Granger than he would ideally like, and the slightly bitter tone in Potter’s voice when he talks about their happily married life doesn’t escape him.
Two years down the line, he had no regrets about getting a puppy. This led him onto the route of thinking that perhaps; he would not have regrets about blood-adopting a baby. He knew that there would be hard times, of course, there had been an up-hill battle just to potty-train Seeker with Daily Prophets spread all over the apartment. The golden moment -literally -was when he had peed on Rita Skeeters face.
"Don't look at me, Draco…" came the cracked voice from the bent face. Draco could not suppress the sad smile that crawled on to his mouth. Harry's fringe used to always mask his face and his tears when he bowed his head -but now there was no unruly mop to hide the droplets.
Some maids trailed into the room with fresh tablecloths and gasped when they saw the two young men ringing wet and shuddering slightly. "Master Draco! We must get you into a hot bath right away!" one of them chimed and started to usher the blonde man out towards the grand staircase, quickly followed by another maid ushering Harry out and chattering about getting him a bath as well. Harry couldn't complain but he didn't like the sight of Draco being taken away and 'looked after' out of his line of vision. How did they know what to do for him and what about his potions? If they didn't apply them then he could suffer a severe set-back. If not, as soon as he was dressed he would need to get back in to the blonde's bedchamber and rub one of his salves onto the blonde's chest to ease his breathing.
"Thought you wanted to make me squirm?" Draco bit back, feeling relax and excited all at once. A swift smack to his pert arse shut him up.
Harry was so close to turning, swiping up his wand and walking out of the door and just leaving the blonde there to sulk. But as soon as his hands rested on the doorknob, he found that he didn't have the energy to feel so defeated anymore. He wasn't going to walk away from this. He turned around and silently crossed the room to where Draco stood. He stood a foot away from him and drew in a deep breath, "I had a pretty poor childhood with my muggle relatives, so much so that getting a full meal seemed like a miracle, let alone Christmas dinners. I didn't get much of any of that until my first Christmas here in first year. That really was magic and it took my breath away. It made all the tormenting of past years and the darkness from Voldemort's seemed quite small and meaningless." He heard the blonde snort and couldn't blame him. "That first Christmas brought to light the magic I'd always dreamed of and then it was real. It was so real, Draco," he breathed out and watched as the blonde shuddered gently in front of him, "I want you to see that magic. You deserve to see that kind of magic. Is there anything I can do to make you see it?"
Feeling sick and shaken he tossed the pillow across the room and watched as it thumped weakly against the wall and slid down to the floor. His was hot and cold in equal measures, shaking and biting down so hard on his tongue to stop from screaming, that he could taste his own blood pooling around his teeth. He clawed his fingernails down the length of his face, hyperventilating between his palms and trying not to cry and scream out at the fear spiking in his heart. Draco was still alive; he was still breathing and shifting restlessly in the bed. He was fine, absolutely fine! The manic laugh that choked out of his throat almost scared him even more as the dark night sky outside lighting with the first amber kiss of dawn. He rubbed at his arms and legs, his fingers almost vibrating with the cold as he watched Draco from across the room. How could he even think about ridding the world of someone so beautiful? He shook his head and sneered at himself, digging his nails into his thighs and wincing as the blood seeped out and spotted the cream nightshirt. He'd have to get rid of it before anyone saw. He'd been so careful with his others, not clawing at himself through the fabric, but this time he had needed the pain, needed to feel something other than the dark numbness creeping into his mind and freezing his blood.
Draco cut him off with a firm kiss against his mouth; silencing Harry and making the brunette melt a little more into the mattress. "You talk too much, Potter," he murmured as he leaned over the brunette man. He stroked a strand of dark hair behind his ear and smiled softly down at him, "Let's not worry anymore, alright? You can sneak back to your bedchamber in the morning if you must, but for now just relax okay? If this is the only chance I get to do this, then let it happen now."
Even though his tone indicated that he would appreciate a change of topic, he couldn't stop the question from falling from his lips and spilling out into the air. "What are you suffering from, if it's not too impertinent a question to ask?"
He poured some more apple scented bubble bath into his hands before shifting around the tub and slipping his hands under the warm water so as to massage Harry's shoulders. The feel of bones bursting against the stretched skin made Draco feel physically sick -what had they been doing to Harry in there? His stomach churned uncomfortably as he watched Harry slide his hands over the slippery bubbles, and blow a handful into the air -like a little soap-covered child.
Harry blinked in surprise but shook his head, "Er no I don't have any plans. What were you thinking of doing?"
"Goddamnit Harry, I fucking love you!" Draco moaned out, his voice echoing in the small room. He gasped and clenched his jaw tightly as his cock was drawn out into the cool air. Harry's hot fingers wrapped around him and started to stroke. He felt his legs turn to jelly as he clung onto the brunette man's shoulders. "You're such a fucking tease," he growled at the back of his throat.
Harry looked impressed as Draco paused for a breath. He couldn't help but smile as the blonde flexed his arm muscles. "You really are a great motivational speaker. Maybe you should get a job where ninety per cent of it you give speeches."
The younger man shrugged, "I just wanted to kiss you -it's been a small dream for the past few weeks."
Theo held up his hands in surrender, "Hey calm down, I'm trying to list off the possibilities here."
Greasy water poured down his gullet and rushed up his nose and into his ears and he was sure it even leaked under his eyeballs and soaked through into his skull.
Once they had eaten Draco placed both plates on the coffee table and cuddled Harry against his chest, rubbing soothing circles into Harry's car-sore muscles. The muscles unwound beneath his magical fingers and soon Harry was humming and moaning languidly as he closed his eyes into the tender motions and soon drifted off to sleep against the blond mans chest. Draco managed to stay awake until the movie they were watching ending, and only when the end credits started rolling up he screen did he start to yawn and feel his eyelids drooping heavily. He stretched his arms out behind his head and summoned a blanket from the bedroom. He placed the blanket delicately around Harry's bony shoulders, before fluffing the pillow behind him and nestling down along the sofa, with Harry's bald head nuzzled against his chest.
He had loathed being torn away from Harry's limp body by two Healer's; they restrained him and stunned him.
Harry nodded, "You have no idea how much I appreciate this Professor, this is such an amazing chance for me!"
Harry chuckled again as he ruffled Seeker's flanks. "Well he must love you lots since you've spent all of this time with him."
Harry nodded weakly, "probably as much as I miss you -but at least you've got seeker. I have no one."
Harry shrugged his shoulders before standing up and pressing the back of his hand to Draco's forehead before frowning. "I came because I felt like you needed someone to look after you and judging by the state of you, no one really has except for that poor maid you screamed at." Draco huffed and didn't bother answering. He listened as Harry shuffled around his room and then went over to the door of his bedchamber and called for a maid. He couldn't make out the younger man's mutterings but he was sure he wasn't going to like it. Once the door was closed again, Harry turned his attention to the blonde man swathed in sweaty, knotted bedclothes. "I've asked the maids to prepare a bath for you and some light supper for the both of us. Proper food, none of this breakfast nonsense they had you living on. That won't do you any good at all. You need regular sustenance and to be able to let the potions I have for you work." Draco blinked in surprise. He hadn't expected any of those things. He felt his mouth hang open uselessly as he watched Harry come over to the side of his bed and reach for the knotted ties of the blonde's nightshirt.
Draco squirmed a little underneath him, feeling both crushed and a little gross as the cum dribbled out of his arsehole and down onto the bed and around his buttocks. He felt so sticky and grimy but as soon as Harry rolled off of him and he straightened his legs down he winced at the fierce burn spreading up from his rectum. "Merlin, Harry! You've ripped me in two!" he wailed as he rolled onto his front and tried to clench his cheeks together.
As the sky finally decided on becoming dark blue, Draco felt his stomach give a painful rumble. He had not eaten since that morning and he had only had some noodle soup along with Harry. He grimaced as another rumble broke through his thoughts. They needed to stop off for something to eat. He doubted any of the food at their apartment would be edible anyway. As he turned around another corner he came to a slow stop at a red light. It would not do to go in and eat and leave Seeker in the back of the car.
He wanted to gasp out in shock as the cold water soaked through into his clothes and closed over his head, swallowing him down into the blinding grey-blue depths. The weight of his clothes made him sink lower, the bubbles fizzing and hissing in his ears like vicious snakes. It took a little while for his eyes to adjust and he silently cursed himself from leaving his wand stashed away in the drawer in his bedchamber. He looked around, using his arms to force himself lower, further from the air and sunlight overhead and closer towards the weeds wafting up from the lakebed. The weeds tangled around his ankles as he kicked his leaden legs through the water, fighting his way lower still until he saw something pale and shimmering in the filtered rays of sunlight that spliced through the murkiness.
Instead of staring at him like he had last time, Draco was left speechless as Potter grabbed his wrist and thrust into his hand. "Oh Malfoy, I'd let you handle my wand any day."
"Thank you for listening," Harry eventually mumbled as he directed his gaze up to the sky, for lack of anything else to say to the older boy.
Harry had silently promised Hermione via the owl she had sent him, which he wouldn't spend too long looking at the map that night, but there was a small part of himself that couldn't resist the temptation. Over the last month of so he and Hermione and Ron, on occasion, had helped him out to keeping the brunt of the student body away from Draco and a few of the other Slytherin's as well, but mostly Draco. He liked to make some time and keep a track of the blonde's movements and force himself to remember whether the blonde stayed in one place too long or if he didn't make it to the Great Hall for certain meals.
Harry nodded, "Alright then, well I'm sorry I didn't stay around for too long to see if you were alright."
That sounded good. Maybe he would try and win Harry one of those massive Teddy Bears that some kids had been carting around. He smiled softly as the salted wind raked his blond hair out of his eyes. Harry gave his hand a squeeze and leaned closer against him as they walked through the damp sand, the soft shushing noises of the waves breaking on the banks. The salty air awakened their numb senses, the sleep last night having been deep and heavy.
He tugged the boxers down off of Harry's narrow hips and continued to lick and caress with his lips and tongue until his lover was exposed underneath him. He leaned back and was surprised at Harry's large member sitting erect against his navel, the once nest of dark curls was now replaced with hairless, unspoiled skin. It was a tortured delight for him to kiss. Harry was beautiful as he arched against Draco's mouth, the tip of his cock brushing against Draco's hot, wet lips. Draco took Harry's penis in his mouth and sucked on the head, teasing the slit with his tongue and massaging Harry's hot balls with his hand.
