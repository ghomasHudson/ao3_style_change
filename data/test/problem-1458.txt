Draco moved his wing into the spell easily, feeling it brush off of him and rebound against the wall.
Snape frowned. “Indeed, under normal circumstances, eye contact is necessary in Legilimency in order to delve into one’s mind. But as always, Potter, you are the exception. The curse that failed to kill you appears to hold a connection between you and the Dark Lord, thus he has asked me to teach you to close your mind.”
Harry bit his lip. “But, isn’t it helpful?” he asked, heart beating faster. “If.. Err, I hadn’t ‘seen’ the snake attack on Mr. Weasey, we wouldn't have known about it…”
“Hi.”
“Badly.”
Sirius frowned. “Spells are for more than just fighting with y’know.”
Sirius huffed. “Stop being cheeky, I DO have money you know.”
That was highly suspicious, Draco glared at him and ignored the curse comment. “That means you haven’t told Remus we’re going.”
-------------------
“You take Remedial Potions?” Zacharias had said with a look of pure amusement on his face.  “Good Lord, you must be terrible, Snape doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does he?”
He vaguely recalled the letter he had received from Lupin a few days after they left Grimmauld Place, somehow he had noticed the angry red marks over his hand… It was rather obvious the more he thought about it.
“It seems so.”
<3 A big thanks to my friends who gave me a lot of support while I was writing this chapter <3
“I haven’t been pouting,” Draco denied immediately, but didn’t close his door. “What do you have in mind.”
“You know you’d be twice as effective if you used those wings to fly.”
There was a loud sigh from the potion master.
Sirius snorted very loudly in the background, peeking out from behind the back of the sofa. “French.”
Draco huffed, and with one big flap of his wings he had enough force to take Sirius off his feet, the larger man falling onto his arse with an “oof.”
“Those wings… what were they?” Professor Snape asked.
“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape. “We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse... You will find that similar powers are needed for this... Brace yourself, now ... Legilimens!”
With a quick glance around, his eyes landed on a very expensive jewel. He was buying that. Because it had no real use and was ridiculously expensive. That was how things should be!! None of this ‘emotion’ crap.
Cho smiled, she didn’t look angry which was good. He shuffled his feet.
“Alrighty, now it’s time to duel, and no cheating,” Sirius said, taking his wand out.
Sirius pulled him down next to him, much to Draco’s chagrin at sitting on a filthy floor.
He left the room a lot more confused than when he had entered.
Draco stared at him.
“What’s the point if I can’t use it anyway,” Draco muttered.
The potions professor had taken a seat at his desk and gestured towards the chair opposite. Harry sighed, taking a seat and  feeling all-together as though he was about to be scolded.
“You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep. Empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?”
Snape squinted at him. There was the dumbass look again.  “Last year, how did you repel the imperius curse?”
Harry blinked in confusion before realising it was Snape that had spoken.
“I can flash if I want to,” Draco snipped. “My exhaustion has passed, and you ARE sad. I can feel it,” he crossed his arms, leaning against the doorframe and raising an eyebrow at Sirius.
“‘Mind reading’ is a muggle term. The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of our skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter,” he stopped, wrinkling his nose as he looked Harry up and down. “Well, most minds are anyway.”
“We’re going shopping!” he exclaimed.
It seemed to happen every time Harry and the Weasleys left. Both in the summer, and now. The mutt enjoyed their company a lot more than he let on, even though he did still have Remus.
“I’m trying,” Harry snapped. “But you’re not telling me how!”
Sirius was across the room in a second, nudging him in the side. “C’mon~ you’re a pureblood so you like shopping, I know you do~”
Harry’s heart leapt to his throat. “You mean he can read minds?” he screeched, immediately thinking of the snake attacking Mr.Weasley and his worries of being possessed, was THAT what this legili-thingy was?
He’d never heard of it before Professor Snape of all people had told him they were going to have lessons on it. Sirius said it was a good thing, that it would help keep Voldemort out of his mind.
say that, Narcissa loved french. I remember. And those Malfoys are from France, right?”
He was once again in Snape’s office and he stared at the ceiling in a daze for a moment before realising that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape’s desk on his way down.
“A dream?” Snape asked, an eyebrow raised at him.
“Draco, I know you speak French, so I was wondering if you could read this line for me?”
3. I took some stuff from the books for this chapter because Sirius talking to him in the fire and the D.A. meetings, but I also tried to change stuff and make it more relevant to my story and not just a rehash of J.K. Rowling. But I think Dumbledore's Army was a terrible idea for a name that got them in massive trouble because they literally say the ministry think Dumbledore's building an army and that's what they go and do! Defence Association was better. ^-^
“...Really, Potter?” Snape said, raising an eyebrow at him.
Heya, I've kind of re-edited this entire fanfic from the beginning because, I just wasn't fond of certain things. So, nothing overall has changed but a bunch of small things might have, and scenes might be a bit different or extended or something. So feel free to reread if you can be bothered, but if you can't you should still know what's up.
Which had turned out moderately well. If you could count getting pushed off a roof and almost landing on Remus coming home as ‘well’. But the good thing about being a 16-year-old was that the adult looking after you got the blame. Well it was the mutts stupid idea anyway.
Ew, ‘sir’...
The moment the spell struck, Snape’s office seemed to fade away from his eyes and images instead flashed forward, flickering like a film so vivid it blinded him for a moment.
Sirius seemed to know exactly where to go and trotted off down the road with Draco trailing behind. After ten minutes of walking he found they were at a small muggle outdoor market.
“Oh! No, I’m sorry, err, you took me by surprise I guess…” he mumbled.
“I can’t control it,” Draco flushed red. “Just hurry up!”
“I thought not,” he said. “You let me get in too far. You lost control… You... ” his professor seemed to be stuck on what to say - which shouldn't make Harry as happy as it did, but at least he wasn’t the only one in pain right now.
After a skeptical glance, Draco went back to reading Entry 9.
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” Snape replied. “He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too...”
Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told. He did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced him, carrying a wand.
“Yes . . . sir,” he muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remus gave him a sharp look. “Sirius…” he warned, but the mutt just waved him off.
Many notes to say, just about this fic in general:
There was a dark frown on Sirius’ face.
P.S I love the twins, and I'm sorry for the amount of text without dialogue there is...
“Oh I see how it is,” Sirius grumbled.
He eyed the muggles suspiciously, but none of them so much as glanced at him, at least he could trust the disillusion on his wings to last a little while.
Sirius was moping again.
Draco rubbed his eyes, feeling the weariness seep into his soul. “Just pick whatever and let’s go.”
“And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?” Harry asked. It was so very hard to keep the annoyance out of his voice when mentioning Dumbledore. If it was so important why couldn't the Headmaster teach him himself? And why was he being ignored!
There had been several break outs over the past few months. His Aunt Bellatrix Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, Augustus Rookwood… He scanned the article.
Harry frowned uncomfortably, thinking back to MadEye— Barty Crouch Jr performing the charm on him. “I didn’t repel it, I just... I didn’t want to do what… that guy said.”
“Who?” Draco wondered.
“Circumstances?” Harry asked, because he didn’t think anyone would jump to the horcrux theory.
“Except we’d be stuck smelling him every time he came to visit us,” pointed out Harry, but he couldn’t stop giggling at the mental picture.
“What’s going on?” Draco asked.
Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair. “I know you won’t believe it, but it’s not as bad as you think. James is a happy child. He’s never once asked me why you don’t love him or anything like that. If you think you’re holding back affection, then don’t. Don’t wait until we know one way or the other. Regardless of what he is, or what you think you deserve, a child needs affection. When you see him tomorrow morning, just... give it. If you can’t give a hug, then try a compliment. Spend time with him. He’s around the age we can start him on flying. Not high, mind you, but we can see if he likes it... and when you’re able to... tell him you love him. I
“Well, yeah. And everything you said about it sucks… but that’s for… for people like you and Sirius who shouldn’t have been placed there to begin with… but Harry, it
“How?” asked Harry.
It took a couple of hours, but eventually everyone was able to engage in the lessons with their usual vigour. Mulciber and Rabastan were tag teaming to teach Harry a spell called ‘Lynceus Sight’, even though it wasn’t part of the sixth-year curriculum. It essentially gave someone temporary x-ray vision. Unfortunately, it was exceptionally difficult to control. Mulciber told Harry about one of his classmates who cast the spell on himself in hopes of seeing his crush naked. He had been unable to stop after looking past her clothes and ended up seeing muscles and bones. And it hasn’t just been focused on his crush, but everyone who happened to be around. Grossed out, the bloke had tried to avert his gaze by looking at the ground but ended up seeing past the floor. The kid freaked out as his brain kept telling him he wasn’t standing on anything.
Harry didn’t know how to respond. Hale’s plan might be working for the moment, but the public was fickle. Yet, Burke wouldn’t be so upset if he wasn’t worried about Hale succeeding and painting Burke and the ministry in a negative light. As much as Harry wanted their plan to work, he didn’t want Albert to pay the price.
Harry’s other problem was that his general body order really was becoming quite rank. Azkaban apparently didn’t believe in deodorant. Probably because it was too cold to work up a proper sweat.
“I understand the theory. It’s... it’s brilliant,” Draco said. Harry felt a surge of pride at his words. “I just don’t get how you pulled it off.”
“Er,” Harry stammered and blushed fiercely. His eyes widened when he saw Mulciber’s hand waving through the bars of his cell, expecting Harry to comply immediately.
“Not that they gave up,” Neville said. “They tried to search our dorm next.”
“You don’t mind, do you?” Ron said nervously. “Gin thought you’d want that. I mean for Hermione and I to both be his godparents...”
This caused a minor argument between Ron and Hermione. Hermione accused Ron of never taking school seriously, while Ron countered that Hermione was too serious about their schoolwork. It was a common disagreement between them. It usually annoyed Harry, but now he found comfort in the familiarity of it.
“You might want to use a fake name next time,” he advised.
“Oh! Mummy issues? I would have guessed you had daddy issues. Perhaps it’s both?” taunted Burke.
Harry shrugged but honestly said, “I like your dad. He’s really nice.”
“Harry,” Scrimgeour cut in. “You don’t know what you’re saying. These- these accusations you’re making – well, it takes a process to investigate. I can’t just fire someone because someone said something against them. It takes time to really investigate.”
“We have to call the ministry,” the third guard said. “We can’t hide
“Well,” Scrimgeour said, focusing intently on Harry as if not acknowledging the others’ presence would afford him the same treatment from the inmates. “It’s all good to be Dumbledore’s man Harry, but that loyalty will not help you in here. Think about my offer, will you?”
“Why would you want to?” Ishanders sounded as incredulous as his rattling voice would allow.
“All of them?” asked Harry.
“Magic,” he shrugged. Nott and Zabini snorted, and Harry counted it as win when Draco gave a small smile. They looked like they wanted to push the issue, but let it drop when Harry once again nervously glanced about the library. He couldn’t help but feel paranoid.
“What?” Harry asked. He wasn’t sure how he could be damaged and whole.
-year,” Parking said. She looked at Harry expectantly, but it did little to clear up his confusion. “The one you perved on... or has there been so many you don’t remember her?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had to push aside all thoughts of the other prisoners when a couple of stray tears started to soak his pillowcase. He was lucky enough to be free of Azkaban, so he felt stupid for crying now. The last thing he wanted was to look like he’d spent the night bawling.
“It occurred to me that we overlooked an important aspect of your processing, Potter,” Burke stated. Once he was sure that Harry was secure, Burke moved towards a cabinet on the side of the room. He grabbed a box and made his way back to Harry. He summoned a chair – one without chains – and sat down facing Harry.
“Burke’s a vindictive shit,” Albert said slowly. He glanced towards his sink and debated whether it was worth the effort to get cleaned up. After sitting on his cot, it was hard to imagine he’d get up again for a long time. In the end, he carefully laid down. Harry could hear the man’s laboured breathing and hoped there wasn’t more serious internal injuries. Lucius was unable to see his friend, but sensed Albert was having difficulty maintaining his role in the conversation.
“We find it helps if they have a visual reminder,” Burke stated as he opened the box. Harry braced himself for any sort of torture device, but only a potion bottle and some cloth were in the box. Burke pulled out the cloth and cut off a piece using his wand. Harry flinched at the sound and the chains constricted once again.
“Is there any way to throw up a soul?” Harry asked as a last attempt to save both himself and Burke. He didn’t know what would happen to a partially eaten soul, but it had to be better than knowingly destroying one.
Mulciber first taught him the spell to temporarily improve one’s sense of smell. It was a good thing that he couldn’t cast the charm at the moment. Being prevented from showering for a few days made Harry self-conscious of his smell. He didn’t need to improve his senses anymore than they already were. However, it was a simple enough spell that he might remember it once he had his wand.
“We have to find out what happened if we’re to
They still weren’t sure about how souls developed. Draco was reasonably certain the spell he created was safe to use on children, but just in case, he didn’t want to use it on James unless it became necessary. He hoped he could convince Harry that James wasn’t a horcrux without having to resort to it.
Harry worked to cast an illusion over Albert’s face that matched his previous injuries. Crabbe helped him remember which injuries went where. As Harry healed the man's other injuries, he placed the illusion on right away to ensure it matched. By the time Harry was done healing everything, Albert was breathing much easier. Surprisingly, so was Harry. He still felt uncomfortable and gross overall, but casting so many spells had helped ease those sensations so they weren’t overwhelming.
“Disorderly conduct,” Burke shrugged. It was a laughable excuse given that Burke encouraged Jugson to act disorderly just a few minutes ago.
“I suppose,” Harry said as he came to terms with the idea that he would keep going even if it cost Burke’s soul. The moral thing would be to stop... but it wasn’t like Burke had stopped when Harry asked him to. Harry reasoned that it wasn’t fair that he should have to carry around Burke’s soul at the expense of his magic. Burke didn’t deserve that consideration after what he did to Harry. Harry decided that he would keep using magic, even if it ultimately used up Burke’s soul. It was terrible, but it wasn’t like Harry would keep eating souls. Harry just had to hold on until he felt like himself again.
“Er,” Harry sputtered, feeling more than a little awkward.
There were two carriages waiting for them outside of Hogwarts. Although they appeared to be the same size as the ones that bring the students from the train to the school every year, these had no thestrals pulling them. In fact, there was no sign of any animal pulling the carriages along. Harry futilely hoped that meant it wouldn’t be able to leave the grounds.
“You haven’t healed him?” Hale said in lieu of a greeting. “No, no, don’t bother just yet. I’m taking photographs of this... unless you have already done so?” The man was not surprised when the guards admitted they had not documented Harry’s attack.
“I’m sure Miss Granger’s work is as thorough as always,” McGonagall replied. Hermione, who was standing nearby, preened at this. “Still, I want to see for myself how you’re fairing.”
they were in some cases, and having no idea how to destroy them, Harry was desperate. Ron was desperate. Hermione was desperate, though she tried to hide that as much as she could from Harry.
“Perhaps not. It’s not for everyone. It wasn’t suitable for me either,” she admitted.
“It seems like every time I have breakfast in yours, I end up naked in bed with you.” Draco told him, “And I seem to recall someone didn’t do all of their grading last night due to being pissed.”
“I forgot you told me about that! No wonder Skeeter left you alone that whole year, she was terrified of Granger.” Harry chuckled himself, shaking his head.
“That’s fine, they might be a bit big on you though.”
“It’s almost six.” Harry whispered to him, casting a quick
“My only concern would be those who would really struggle with differentiating between them.” Harry rolled onto his side towards the pizza box and grabbed a slice for himself. “Also by the time you hit seventh year, that list gets atrocious. So maybe you could do it more like--” Draco pulled out his wand and adjusted the list so that it gave categories of spells rather than specifying each spell individually as Harry went back to laying on his back. “You see what I mean?”
“If she feels comfortable. Me and Draco are probably going to be a couple doing couple things.”
“Potter, you’re going to make a stupid face at this and I don’t really care, my legs will not support my weight right now. Just let me sit for a second.” Harry did make a stupid face and Draco sighed, both embarrassed that Harry was so pleased with his reaction and that he was being honest in that his legs were still shaking.
“Get out of my head, Hermione.” Harry grumbled.
“Right.” Ron agreed, sitting down on the arm of the couch.
“So, here’s my problem with that. I want them to really think about each spell, not just the categories. Like, hexes. A first year would automatically assume those are Dark Magic without really thinking through the different spells that fall into that category.” Harry picked up the slice again so that he could get another bite.
“I will not end up naked in bed with you this time.” Draco said resolutely, taking Harry’s hand and pulling both of them towards the door. Harry pressed a laughing kiss to his temple.
Draco was grateful that it was Friday. He should have known when his first years had executed their potion work perfectly that something was going to go wrong and his NEWT class delivered by acting like they had never seen a cauldron before. Apparently the lower Herbology classes and Harry’s classes had acted the same way and he was grateful that he could commiserate with the two of them about it.
under his breath, “We can always just call it here.” They stood on the pathway to the castle, looking to the front door that led back to into the castle. Draco was clearly torn, looking between Harry and the door for a second before sighing,
“Yeah, just… thinking.” Draco said, taking a bite of his eggs. They had put extra cheese and peppers, just the way he liked them.
“I was supposed to get you to forgive her faster, you know that, right?”
“No, I didn’t.” Harry agreed, “And Draco didn’t let me see it. He knew that I had just come out of intensive therapy and work and he didn’t want me rushing into anything else. But there was something about his birthday, I don’t know Ron. Something finally broke and… I’m happy.” Harry said, holding his arms out like he had nothing else to give.
Harry grunted lowly as he went back to the bedroom where Draco was pulling on a pair of track pants and looking around for his sneakers.
“You just wanted to get me naked in some form.” Harry shrugged.
“Well… no, she didn’t. All she told me was that she had been worried at how fast you were going with Malfoy since we didn’t even know you guys were friends let alone… you know, about to date at the time.” Ron said, shoving his hands into his pockets.
Harry had been his friend at that point and Pansy was convinced that he should just let him do what he wanted.
“And what if she had been right?” Harry said, “What if for the past six months I’ve been so deliriously happy not because I’m finally living my life for myself and going after a relationship that feels like it’s truly for me rather than what everyone expected of me but because I was drugged? How would I be able to work beside you anymore? How would I be able to look at everything we did together, every work session, every staff pizza night that we spent flirting so much that Neville told us to get a room and see it the same way?” Persie began to huff louder in the silence as they came up to the start of their third lap.
“You alright?” Harry asked, tucking himself back in as he gently removed the track pants that had somehow managed to hang onto Draco’s ankle the whole time and tried to guide him to stand.
“Yeah alright.” Draco grumbled from somewhere under the pillow he had added to the top of his head.
Persie (a nickname that Draco loathed since her full name was Persephone) happily chewed away at her breakfast, unaware of her master’s upset. He watched as Draco made his way into the bathroom, dragging a blanket over his shoulders like a cloak. Harry snorted at the sight of him then sighed as he tried to think about something else besides Hermione. This was supposed to be a normal Wednesday at Hogwarts. Neither he or Draco were on breakfast duty and they were on the B schedule so the first class wasn’t until 8:30. He guessed he really didn’t need to be up this early, but Persie needed her morning walk and he needed the fresh air. He had started these walks with Persie after adopting her and his stint in the Janus Ward shortly after the war.
“That’s the point!” Harry said, obviously forgetting that he had his pizza in his hand as he threw his arm out. The flimsy slice broke off at the crust from the momentum and went flying towards the fireplace as it flared and Hermione stepped through. Draco couldn’t decide if he was horrified or delighted as the pizza slice hit Hermione in the face and slid to the floor. He glanced at Neville who was equally horrified and awestruck and Harry who looked plain horrified.
He didn’t want to feel this way about his best friend, he truly didn’t. The night before he had used the punching bag that Dudley gave him for Christmas last year for over a half hour, ranting to Draco who had thought they were going to grade papers together, about the disrespect that Hermione decided to show him and their relationship. He thought about using it again while Draco got up, but instead he figured he could work through it on their morning run together.
“She didn’t think it all the way through. I can understand her reasoning.”
“She thinks I’m an idiot who goes headfirst into everything and doesn’t know when to quit.” Harry said with a growl.
get once my team wins.” He said with a grin, laying back against Harry’s side. He felt Harry press a kiss to his head and honestly, even if Granger thought that he was drugging Harry every day to make him fall in love with him, there was no way that Draco couldn’t fall a little bit in love with him too.
He went into the bathroom as Draco exited, brushing his teeth and running his fingers through his hair a few times to separate the curls. They were a bit everywhere and he definitely needed to trim his beard when they got back, but he wasn’t going to worry about that now.
“I bet if we asked Flitwick and McGonagall they’d say that their classes were nuts today too.” Draco said as he flung an arm over his eyes to block out the admittedly low light.
Harry was not prepared to have Ron standing in his quarters when he came back to get ready for afternoon classes. He had been certain that Ron wouldn’t come to see him until after he had forgiven Hermione since he had just spent the last week in Russia on a mission. Persie was beating her tail against the floor happily, clearly expecting Ron to give her treats or pets and she was disappointed that she was getting neither.
“Any time.” Draco said, letting Harry take his hand and lace their fingers together.
“She’ll live.”
To Draco’s credit, he didn’t end up naked in bed with him. He did however end up on the edge of Harry’s sofa, both hands buried deep in Harry’s hair and one foot out of his track pants so that it could be hooked over Harry’s shoulder.
“Just work stuff. Nothing very interesting.” Draco hated seeing Harry this defensive, especially about his work. “How are you?” Harry asked with a tinge of honesty in his voice. Hermione glanced to Draco, who gave the subtlest of shrugs. He wasn’t going to do anything that could make her hate him more than she already apparently did.
“Yeah, I know she didn’t.” Harry agreed, bending over to touch his toes, “Doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt.” Persie did her own stretch, going into a bowing position and then laying on the bank to watch them stretch.
“I’ll have you know Healer Winter is very impressed with my progress of making goals for myself that don’t involve others.” Of course, several of his goals involved other people but they were ones that he had for himself and himself alone. Not for Mrs. Weasley, not for Hermione or Ron, not even for McGonagall. They were ones for him.
“So, what’d you think of the match last Saturday? Exciting stuff.” Draco gave a mental sigh of relief for Weasley (Granger now, he supposed)’s complete inability to go five minutes without talking Quidditch with him.
Hermione grimaced as Ron stepped through with a case of beers, glancing at his wife with a concerned look. “Um…” Hermione appeared to be thinking through every life decision she had made up to that point as Harry hastily sat up and turned so that he was sitting upright next to Draco on the sofa. After a few moments of suffocating silence, Hermione finally spoke,
“Draco?” Draco blinked to see that Harry was grinning at him, clearly mid-snap. “Alright?”
” Draco groaned. He was convinced that Matthews wanted to get the award for the Dumbest Ravenclaw in existence. Which drove all of the staff crazy since they knew he was smart, there was some sort of pleasure he got out of acting like an idiot.
It had been something Draco had to fight with him about when he had to keep Harry at an arm’s distance. He had been scared of this exact reaction from Harry’s crew, the distrust and conviction that he had done something wrong. He could remember it so clearly when he had given in after six month’s worth of work sessions, flirting at the Head Table and during drinks with their friends, finally working through those years of misunderstandings and old beliefs, those almost kisses that Draco had to pull away from. It had been his birthday, he had just turned 20 and Pansy had decided that they needed to go somewhere new.
“Harry, please, gods. I can’t, I won’t--” If anything Draco was saying made any sense whatsoever, Harry didn’t seem to catch wind of it. Instead he added a third finger and Draco slammed his head against the back of the couch, wanting more but not knowing what exactly he wanted as tension built in his stomach. “Harry, gods, please I’m close, please.” He didn’t actually know what he was asking for either, though Harry seemed to catch what he wanted. He buried his fingers deep in Draco’s arse as he pressed Draco’s cock as much into his mouth as possible, his throat constricting around the tip of his cock. Draco was not proud that he wailed, digging his heel into Harry’s back as he came, shaking violently.
Draco sighed, looking around himself and hoping once again that no one recognised him. There wouldn't be any wizards in such a place, right? He half expected the wizard cops to show up, having magically tracked him or something.
“One, two, three,” Sirius dashed to the side, casting “Stupefy!”
“Right,” he agreed.
Featuring, a brief look at Draco learning from Remus and Sirius and Harry being insecure.
Draco blinked, reaching over to look at it.
After a few moments he regained his voice. “I hate you.”
“But Sirius…”
Harry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with the desk between them.
Exactly thirty minutes later, Sirius slammed his bedroom door open, a maniacal grin plastered to his face.
Well, normally.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, take the floo to a place called ‘the Hags Den in London’”
More fun times at Grimmauld and working out things about Draco's education.
“Ooo you sneaky child,” Sirius giggled, rolling out of the way. “See that right there is cheating, I can’t hit you if you use your wings.”
Whatever it was Snape was saying, it sounded like mind reading and he did not like the sound of it at all.
Annoyance flashed through his mind and he snapped his eyes open, a wave of anger flooding his body as he directed it all at Snape. He was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull.
“Sirius... “ he said louder.
“Must you show your sadness so obviously all the time,” he glared.
Sirius was ready for it, a “Protego!” up before it even got close, the chair smashed and Sirius hopped away from the splinters of wood.
They were in London.
Oh no… Professor Snape was talking.
Sirius narrowed his eyes. “You
It was obviously a ‘wizarding’ shop but Draco couldn’t for the life of him understand why they were there, grimy second-hand objects littered the shelves and just as he was about to complain Sirius-dog started whimpering and scratching at the door, wanting to leave.
Finally, they left the store, books in hand and Draco let out a sigh of relief. “Can we go now?” he asked.
Sirius barked.
The Sirius-dog barked at him and started padding deeper into the shop. He followed, feeling forty times more tired than he had that morning.
Sirius waved him off as the frame smashed to the ground behind them. “It’s fine, I’ll disillusion them.”
“Let’s go again. On the count of three: one, two, three: Legilimens!”
Sirius’ voice came out small and worried. “Oh no! We’re lost.”
“Nothing really,” Sirius grumbled, throwing the newspaper down and frowning at it.
That was highly doubtful in Draco’s opinion. He sighed, knowing that this was going to be a long day. But at least if Sirius got caught and arrested he could feign ignorance or just flash away and pretend nothing had happened. Sirius had escaped the ministry before, he could do it again.
When he came back to himself there was a sharp pain in his knee.
see into his mind,
Sirius stared at him for three seconds before gasping loudly and pointing at him. “The ultimate escape!”
I'm sorry, I like tarot...
He didn’t know how anyone could enjoy potions, the room stank of toads, flobberworm and an especially pungent bat spleen. He eyed a jar in the corner as the cause of such an awful smell.
“Now, Occlumency,” Snape began. “As I told the mongrel, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence,” then in a lower voice muttered. “How the damn wolf ever managed to learn it is beyond me.”
Not to mention Zacharias had walked up to him in the hallway asking if there was a DADA meeting and all he could think of to say was that he had ‘Remedial Potions.’
“Do NOT say the Dark Lord’s name!” Professor Snape snapped.
“You’ll just have to get creative,” Draco said with a smirk.
“What?” Draco asked, wondering if they’d left something behind or if Sirius was just being weird as usual.
Sirius rolled his eyes. “Alright, alright, I’ve decided. I’m getting them all.”
“As long as you don’t make fun of me this time,” Draco replied.
Draco decided at that moment that he hated dogs.
“Well, let me think about it…” the mutt grumbled, heading off downstairs.
I am stiII here... sIooowIy writing.
“You’re all glowy again, you should probably stop,” Sirius said, looking as though he was trying to keep a grin off his face.
“...Fine,” said Harry, reeling from the fact Snape had said ‘good’ in relation to him.
“Pleaaaase~” Sirius pleaded. “I promise I’ll buy you something nice too.”
“Mean!” Sirius shouted.
The mutt rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.
Sirius was pouting, sitting behind the sofa because Remus had confiscated his wand until further notice. Remus was reading a book while Draco smoothed the feathers of his wings, making sure they were all in perfect condition.
They bowed to each other out of respect for the wizard duel.
There are a few POV changes so sorry about that, it's mostly Draco's perspective.
Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him…
“With what money?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“And Vol- he realised I was there?”
he start looking into his mind? Maybe he could be possessed!! What could he see? His current thoughts or past memories?!
He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, it told him he would do well in Slytherin and he told it no...
Harry groaned, glancing at the clock for the eleventh time. Their Transfiguration class ended but that just meant the evening was that much closer!
Occlumency.
Draco cast “Colloshoo” at Sirius’ feet as he moved, hoping to stick at least one foot to the ground and stop Sirius in his tracks. If the spell didn’t sputter out as it had the first time he’d tried to use it.
“I’m sorry… about before,” Cho began.
Ron’s offer to hex him hadn’t even cheered him up, it had just reminded him that he needed to talk to both Ron and Hermione about the whole Occlumency thing which he still hadn’t actually told them about, and he really didn’t want to.
The potions Professor struck before Harry had even begun to consider being ready, his mind still full of worry about being possessed and a million other things that had been bothering him over the past days and weeks.
“I guess I should get going,” he said.
That night he had a dream about the Department of Mysteries and Voldemort, he wrote it down in case it was important, but didn't bother waking anyone to mention it.
<.< Harry needs to stop doing things so I can write more Draco.
Sirius grinned. “Of course I do. But for this to work, I’m going to be taking another form.”
He slugged his way towards Snape's office. There was absolutely no way in hell that this would go well. After standing outside the door for several minutes, he finally knocked, and entered.
Draco glared, opening the door and stepping very carefully outside.
“Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency-”
A muggle employee poked their head down the aisle and Draco pushed down his embarrassment, pretending to look at books until they went away.
--------------------
He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.
With a grimace, Harry tried to bring down his annoyance at Snape seeing his memories and dreams, but lately anger wasn’t something he could turn off…
Harry pretended he hadn’t just jumped out of his skin from Snape basically appearing next to him, and closed the door without a word.
“Shhh,” Sirius hushed, looking around the room as if Remus were about to pop out of the wardrobe. “We’re going on a mission to get him a birthday present.”
He stepped up into the floo, the walls were grimy with smoke and he held the sides of his wings, wrapping them around his front to avoid them touching anything. Sirius gave him some floo powder and Draco said the name, disappearing into the floo network until he stepped out into an even filthier looking place.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the hypocrite.
Bouncing back immediately, Sirius started to grin again. “That means you’re in! We’re now partners in this! ...and I’m working on more curses to throw at you.”
Snape suddenly looked very tired and muttered something like. “Defiant little shit.”
In a sudden movement Sirius was human, scooping the book out of a dazed Draco’s hand and pulling three more out. “He’ll want the series, Ooo and this one too, and what about this…”
He was about to question what on earth he meant but was cut off by Sirius who shifted into a dog right in front of him.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said Snape, an eyebrow raised. “But I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’ or ‘Professor’ at all times.”
The mutt blinked and stuck his tongue out to pant loudly.
“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said. “The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions.”
He heard a loud, overly dramatic sigh, so he looked over to the mutt a second time. Sirius was hunched over, dangling his arms down in an attempt to look pitiful and sad.
Draco stuck his tongue out in response. The only real way to stop Sirius was to break his footing. He flashed with his angel magic across the room closer to Sirius, but the man expected it.
“It’s the ministry, this wouldn’t be the first stupid thing they’ve done,” Sirius muttered. They sat in silence for a few minutes. “Wanna practice some spells?”
He paused, stopping at a stall in the market… There was a deep green brooch, it sparkled at him, reminding him of Potter's eyes.
The name Draco Malfoy disappeared from the mauraders map, the letters shimmering as they faded...
Harry stood up again, his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard.
“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,” said Snape.
“What?”
“Historically yes...” Draco agreed. “And my mother did teach me french. Tu parle francais?”
A great black dragon was rearing in front of him, about to squish him into mush as his fire bolt flew towards him...
He didn’t know how they ended up walking through London, but Sirius had his nose to the floor like a real mutt as they walked. It was hard to tell whether Sirius was looking for a shop or was just hungry on the lookout for food.
“Right,” she agreed. He turned to walk away but stopped, she had tugged his arm.
Lupin thought he should tell the professors, or find a way to get Umbridge in trouble for it. Because apparently using a blood quill was illegal and even the ministry couldn’t accept it if there was proof she was using one on students.
Sirius grinned back.
Snape looked paler than usual.
“Angel magic isn’t cheating,” Draco retorted, they’d sparred many times but their conversations remained the same.
and then he had shown up tonight, engaged.
“right,” harry laughed again, and draco decided that it was his new favorite sound. “want a peppermint?”
“i’ll miss you too, pans,” he whispers, pressing a kiss to her cheek.
“you have to.” she says, throwing the floo powder down. she whispers her address, although the roar of the floo firing up is loud enough to alert harry in the kitchen.
when draco had finally seemed to stop trembling, harry released him from his grip - and he promptly fell forward, into his own mess. he seems relatively unbothered as he turns around, staring up at harry through lust-blown eyes.
with perfect timing, briseis jumps into his lap, nuzzling her soft head into his chest. if he looks down, he knows he’ll be met with striking green eyes - the very reason he had adopted her only three days after he had landed in new york. even if it was impossible - looking at briseis provided him with a semblance of comfort... a gentle reminder that there were pieces of harry scattered all throughout the city - even though it was 3,459 miles from home, and harry had never been.
they would be able to truly be together once more.
“ah, forgive me,” he deadpanned, his eyes swimming with glee. he moved to straddle harry’s lap. “please, harry potter - put that large cock of your in my arse and fuck me until i can’t walk. and then a bit more after that.” he glanced at harry, who looked more annoyed than aroused. he softened his expression and kissed harry’s temple lightly, pulling harry’s hair from the elastic band. “please?” he added.
“draco,” harry says lowly, his voice serious but gentle. “you won’t lose me, baby. i have zero intentions of ever looking for or at anyone else. i only want you, draco. i swear it.”
“okay?” harry asks first, looking up at draco and gently stroking his hair. his eyes are hazy, as they usually are post-orgasm. he looks delightfully fucked, and soft, and at times like these harry wants nothing more than to hold him close.
draco went about his routine happily, delighting in the causal domesticity of taking care of his and harry’s home. if someone had told him as a child that he’d genuinely enjoy acting as a housewife - cooking and cleaning and waiting around for his beau to come home, he would’ve laughed in their face. now, he found himself completely content to keep things tidy in their home, while also taking as much time as he needed for himself to brew, or research, or do whatever it is that he wanted to do.
. and draco falls apart, right there in his arms.
“because i didn’t want my parents to get in trouble,” he says softly, looking down.
“what?” nobody hated lucius more than harry did, but killing his own wife was extreme, even for him.
he had done it to draco before. afterwards, draco hadn’t left the house for three days, because even the glamour charm couldn’t stop him from crying every few minutes.
last week, after potter had finally come following nearly an hour of consistent fucking, he had buried his face in draco’s shoulder, still trembling and gasping for air, and muttered a soft ‘i love you’. draco had discounted it as momentary insanity caused by the force of his orgasm, until potter had caught his breath and rolled over, grinning stupidly and pressing kisses to draco’s jaw and shoulder. i love you, draco, he had said again, and draco had frozen. his heart had stopped and he had gone stock-still, staring down at harry, just mildly horrified. the following encounter had been awkward, full of harry muttering apologies and tripping over himself to get away from draco, while draco had sat, frozen, and not saying anything in return. harry had disappeared through the door, his cheeks warm and his head ducked, while draco stared after him, mouth slightly ajar.
the bond had made their magic stronger, but would take up to a year to reach its fullest potential. until then, their magical stores were somewhat depleted, and it would be difficult for the both of them to attempt to harness large amounts of magic at the same time. so with harry off merlin-knows-where probably fighting for his life every few minutes, draco’s magic - and his emotions, and physical health - were a bit unstable.
“you’ve been high for the last two years,” draco whispers, sounding more pathetic than he would have liked to. “how am i supposed to know when it’s you versus the drugs talking?”
this time, he wasn’t drunk.
“well, let’s not dally, i’ve got things to do tonight.”
he surreptitiously slipped one of the unopened lube bottles into his pocket, smiling demurely at harry as he did. “potter,” he said as he strolled past harry, nodding jerkily at him. “later, malfoy!”
“can they?” harry asked, stripping off his shirt. draco goes to pull off his own, but his hands are slapped away by a grinning harry. “so, you have you dream, and instead of speaking to me, you invite half of slytherin house into our home to get drunk and high,” he kisses down draco’s torso - laving over draco’s peaked nipples and chuckling when he moans loudly.
“oh,” pansy said softly. since she had known draco, he had been ridiculously obsessed with potter. they had often had conversations along these lines, with draco berating potter and rattling off each of his flaws despite him not being there to defend himself. however, what she couldn’t piece together is what potter had done to suddenly illicit this sort of reaction from draco. after all, the war was over, and everyone spoke constantly about the importance of healing pre-war tensions and building a brighter, better future. potter had spoken for draco and narcissa at their trials, and they had shared a brisk handshake and a short exchange during which potter had returned draco’s wand. draco should’ve been indifferent towards potter, if not eternally thankful. what didn’t make sense was this sudden outburst, these tears. so why
draco thinks. “i hurt you - i didn’t love you the way you deserved to be loved.”
over the next week, things had seemed much like the beginning of their relationship. harry seemed to be smiling constantly, and he could more often than not be found sneaking up behind draco to wrap his arms around him and press a gentle kiss to his neck. “i love you’s” were traded frequently and indiscriminately. the house seemed bright and airy - all lingering darkness had simply vanished after that night with harry, in their bed.
and learning how to enjoy love once again.
in the large bed, wrapped up in each other and beneath a thick duvet, draco and harry sleep. in the bathroom, the faucet drips slowly and steadily - a malfunction draco had meant to fix at some point, until the droplets of water became calming and helped to lull him to sleep on the harder nights. in the living room, briseis curls up in a patch of moonlight, whiskers twitching and purring softly as she does. in the kitchen, on draco’s small wooden table, lays a letter written in blue ink and soft cursive -
they stop arguing immediately, having the decency to look somewhat embarrassed as pansy glares at them both. from the living room, something shatters loudly - theo’s barking laughter following closely behind it.
“my new potion was approved by the board yesterday,” he says tersely. he hadn’t meant to say it - hadn’t wanted to share his wonderful news this way. yet, as he sits across from harry, he finds that antibodies and experimental trials are all he can think of right now. he wishes that he could give his potion to harry, could use it to fix whatever imbalance in his brain it was that caused him to crave drugs and other substances that could kill him. he hadn’t understood it, even when hermione had pulled him aside last year and handed him a pamphlet about dealing with drug abuse in loved ones. he had thrown it away in a fit of anger after flipping through it absently - but one particular one-liner had stuck with him.
draco looks up when they land, partly surprised to see that they’ve landed in front of his home. potter waves a hand, unlocking the front door and hustling draco inside.
“well, he does get attention.” draco says, recalling the various occasions on which they had been followed and photographed on dates or outings. harry was still frequently harassed by small mobs everywhere he went - and he had more than once regaled draco with stories about signing autographs in the loo. just as quickly - images of harry pulling him in for a kiss, hugging him from behind as they cooked dinner, and grinning at him flooded his mind. “but i don’t worry about it. we’re in love… he wouldn’t do something like that.”
he finds draco in a nearby room - smaller than the others but just as extravagant. he assumes it had been narcissa’s dressing room, judging from the elegant looking women’s robes and intricate rose quartz wardrobe draco was sat in front of. he had a small mirror in hand and was gently running his finger along a design on the back. harry can see from the doorway that his hands are still shaking.
draco swallows, squeezing his eyes shut and willing himself to remain calm, to not lash out and scream at harry like he so desperately wants to. “no, you didn’t
“are you ready?” he asked softly, staring up at draco. his eyes were clear and bright as they trained on harry’s. draco didn’t respond, instead reaching behind him and taking harry’s cock in hand and lining it up with his hole.
“mind if i take this?” hermione asked, already pulling the mobile from her pocket.
“what are your plans?” draco asked after a moment. “you’re free now, right? no more war… you can do whatever you want now. so what are you going to do?”
for a while, draco sat on the ground in the garden, staring up at the sky. the sun had begun to set, and it was steadily growing colder, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. as the sky melted into beautiful shades of blue and pink, draco stared up, drinking in the sight and committing it to memory.
harry looks away, his own eyes flooding with tears. he blinks them away quickly, bringing a finger up to wipe at his nose. for a long time, he doesn’t look draco in the eyes. he stares at the wall behind him, at the ground, at draco’s shoulder - everywhere but his face. when he finally does make eye contact, the grief that passes between them is practically tangible, and then draco is leaning in, connecting his lips to harry's for what he knows will be their final kiss.
... what do you think? i’ll have to ask draco, of course, but i have a feeling he’ll be amendable.
draco was overly excited about it, and was quietly very pleased with himself. harry had mentioned missing vaccines as a young child offhandedly months ago, and the idea had taken hold of draco and refused to let go. the potion worked, in a way, similairlly to polyjuice potion, by analysing the genetic composition of the drinker and creating antibodies from traces of any illness or allergy.
“you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, harry.” he starts, taking a shaky breath. he stares at the wall - the same way he had early this morning. “i know that i act so sure of myself all the time - so confident… but - i know i don’t deserve you. you’re strong, and beautiful, and kind, and
“goodbye, harry.” draco says softly, cutting him off. he doesn’t want to hear what he has to say - how he might try to guilt draco into listening to whatever it is he has to say, or staying, or letting him in. he doesn’t want to listen, because he doesn’t trust himself not to fall for it - even after all this time.
“oh,” harry says quietly. his eyebrows furrow for a second before he continues, speaking directly into his mug and still not meeting draco’s eye. draco lifts his own mug and takes a small draw. “that’s wonderful, darling. i knew you could do it.”
,” draco whispers, flicking his wand. the car floats into the air smoothly and, under the guidance of his wand, moves a few feet into the field at the side of the road. he drops it haphazardly and critiques his work for a second before deciding that he was pleased.
“Lestrange, stand slightly to the right. Mulciber left. Block as much of the guards’ view without being obvious about it,” Lucius ordered quietly.
As much as namedropping normally made Harry uncomfortable, he was glad Fred had done so. He felt horrible since he
Lucius paced in his cell while the corridor grew silent. The man would occasionally wipe furiously at his eyes. He made no obvious sound, but it was clear to Harry that the man could not hold in his tears. Harry tied not to watch him, but the alternative was looking at Nott. The older man was watching Harry intently, which made him uncomfortable.
Perkins stepped back from Harry but kept a hand on Harry’s arm. Harry noticed that Bole had a similar hold on Hermione, though her hands weren’t tied behind her back.
“Potter,” the guard paused as he placed Harry’s trousers and pants on the bed. As much as Harry desperately wanted to be fully clothed, he didn’t dare let go of the sheet while the guards were still there. The man seemed equally uncomfortable. “Did Maxim... had he managed... shit, did Burke penetrate you?” the man eventually managed to ask.
“Er, ok?” Harry responded.
“Ancient studies?” posed Rabastan.
Harry stared at the wall separating him from Lestrange incredulously. The man wanted to talk about quidditch now? Harry couldn’t help thinking the man was an insensitive arsehole. Harry figured the man must have as clear a view of Malfoy as Harry did. Clearly it wasn’t the time to talk quidditch.
“Most likely. I’ll try to avoid it, but it’s likely they will ask to see you at least once. It won’t do them any favours to keep you from school for an extended period of time… but, I’m sure they will want to hear your testimony directly this time. My quill can
“Pott-”
“You wouldn’t believe the rumours going around,” the man continued. He paused, but Harry was determined to say nothing. He knew from the time that Scrimgeour visited at Christmas that the man would eventually come around to what he wanted to say.
a bunch of teenagers mosey on in.”
“Whether they believe you or not,” cut in Malfoy, “you’ll still have sympathy merely due to the fact that you are still a child.”
“Library then?” Harry asked. Naturally Hermione approved.
There was a brief pause as Hale pointedly looked at the guards. With reluctance, the guards left and closed the door behind them. Harry was happy to see them leave even if they stayed by the window to observe the meeting. He knew they wouldn’t be able to listen to what was said.
“We’re not allowed to shower often,” Lucius stated, trying to get back to the point he was making.
“Except toilet paper,” added a nearby voice. “They won’t fight you on that. No one wants to be cleaning that shit up.”
“Of course,” Harry said. He hesitated, but didn’t know what else he could say or do. Defeated, Harry turned around and made his way back to his own table.
By the end of the day, Harry not only finished his backlog of assignments, but also started moving forward with his alchemy studies thanks to Nott. In return, Harry helped Nott and Ron with their Charms work. Bored, but not wanting Hermione to ask how he managed to complete everything already, Harry decided to read ahead in Defense to make sure Snape couldn’t embarrass him by asking about subjects they hadn’t even covered yet. Before Nott left to return to his common room, Harry asked him if he would be willing to share his old Ancient Runes notes as well so that Harry would have something to do on Sunday while pretending to still catch up on work.
“I’ll tell you,” Lucius suddenly interjected. Harry was surprised at how much it hurt his heart to think that Lucius was about to sign his death warrant.
“I believe we professors are best suited to speak of Mr. Potter’s character,” stated McGonagall.
“Thank you,” Draco said. Both Nott and Crabbe echoed him.
“They are shown, as you were,” Asherath explained. “They either eat or starve.” It sounded all the more cruel given Asherath’s matter-of-fact tone. Harry couldn’t help but wonder how many dementor babies ended up starving. As far as Harry would tell, the dementor population seemed low. Then again, Harry was able to feed and he wasn’t even a dementor.
“Oi! Potter!” Rodolphus called out, making Harry jump.
Seeing a piece of Voldemort’s mangled soul in the in-between had pained Harry in so many ways. He’d felt pity for the tiny creature, and worried his soul now looked the same. When he looked down at himself, he’d seen what he’d always seen. But there was a sadness in the way Dumbledore had looked at him that made him think he might have appeared different to the other man.
“I-” Harry swallowed nervously and tried again. “I didn’t mean to do that,” he said in an unsteady voice.
Draco nodded. He looked unsure for a moment, but then pushed past whatever initial reservations he had to state “I will need you to go over everything. You weren’t the most... coherent last night.”
Harry shivered as the temperature dropped the longer the ride went on. He could still make out enough of the auror’s faces to know that Perkins was giving him pitying looks while Bradley was scowling at him. Burke was still watching him intently. Harry wasn’t sure if he was imagining the man smirking at him or not.
“That was dementors,” Harry interrupted despite the warning look he had received. This time his voice wasn’t as angry though he knew his tone clearly expressed that he thought the auror was an idiot. Probably not the best way to go either. “One was about to kiss my cousin. Do you think-“
approach. In fact, Harry was pretty sure Draco wouldn’t let him down as kindly as Cho had.
“That hasn’t happened so far,” Ron said defensively.
Mulciber also taught Harry what he called the finger trap jinx. It forced an opponent to clap their hands and interlock their fingers.  Nothing prevented the person from immediately separating their hands, but it might give Harry the time needed to fire off a more complex spell. Plus, his opponent might drop their wand in the process. Harry wondered why none of the Death Eaters had used that spell on him previously, but as he caught Nott surreptitiously copying Harry’s movements, he realized he wasn’t the only one learning new spells.
“His notoriety does not exempt him from the law,” announced Runecraft.
“And here I thought you came to see me,” teased Hale’s son.
write down what you say, but they’re well aware that I could selectively choose sections of the transcript,” Hale said with a smirk that indicated to Harry that he’d be doing just that.
“I feel like a shit dad,” Harry admitted one day. The boys had just been set down for a nap. Whenever this happened, Harry felt a sense of relief as he got a break from James. He always felt guilty about it, but that guilt was easier to ignore than when he had to care for his horcrux and pretend to be happy about his life.
Narcissa had a similar defence. Roped in by her husband and sister, she had a little leeway when it came to resisting Voldemort. The lack of carrying her own dark mark worked in her favour. Her main defence for her actions the fear for her son's life. Her trial took longer, but ultimately, she too was released.
Their honeymoon also served as a research trip. They had specifically looked at countries that legally allowed the study of soul magic. Draco had been in contact with several specialists over the years, and several had invited him to visit. They planned to visit them all eventually, using family trips to avoid too many questions. Their honeymoon was the first such trip. They only booked a one-week trip. Neither of them wanted to leave James for longer than that. Draco had set aside three days dedicated to his research with a fourth as padding if needed. The first three days of their honeymoon were spent in bliss as they barely left the bed. Unfortunately Harry was bored the rest of the trip, and made a mental note to plan his own activities for future trips.
“Thanks. I think I got this though,” he said. Lucius had correctly guessed a few of the spells Professor Flitwick has taught during Harry’s absence. Reading over the notes for the spells he didn’t know, he couldn’t help but think they weren’t too complicated.
“Making friends, I see,” interrupted a new voice. Burke, the guard that had escorted Harry into the cell strode into view. Harry hadn’t heard him opening the door at the end of the hallway and was surprised to see him.
so he could elbow me in the face when I chased after him,” Harry’s voice got a little louder as he became indignant at the memory. “But, I guess, in a weird way I like the challenge. Our games against slytherin are always more intense. I guess – well, Draco pushes me to be better, play smarter, you know?”
Perkins greeted the man and called him Anton. They made a few pleasantries, as Anton moved about his desk. If Harry hadn’t dreading being thrown into a cell and forgotten he might of found the small talk comforting and normal.
When he exited the room, only Theo and Draco were still waiting for him.
Finally having enough, Burke reached for Harry’s neck and squeezed. Harry choked as his air supply was completely cut off in Burke’s strong grip. Desperately Harry swiped his nails across Burke’s face but only succeed in making the man angrier. Harry tried to pry Burke’s hand from his neck, but he had no strength left.
“What for?” Harry asked, genuinely unsure.
The reminder of the outside world prompted Harry to ask about his friends.
Perhaps the most embarrassing moment was when he’d listened to Draco excitedly explain a new magical theory he’d learnt. Harry had been so completely enraptured, he didn’t realized he’d set his elbow in his lunch when he’d positioned himself to rest his chin on his hand. It was only when Draco laughed, and cleared away the mess with a spell that Harry realized what he’d done. “Potter, sometimes I think you’d be lost without me,” Draco had joked, but Harry silently agreed. He didn’t know where he’d be without the man.
“Do you think Burke will send us to solitary?” Harry whispered to Nott.
“Are you about to ask me to transfigure you some parchment so you can give me alchemy worksheets?” Harry asked. He was constantly amused at how each of these men thought the subject they were teaching him was more valuable than the others.
“Are there other ways of getting rid of it then?” Harry asked as he brought the conversation back to his original concern.
When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Harry expected Burke to take him back down the hallway that he came from, but instead the guards turned the other way. They passed a number of rooms that seemed to be meeting rooms, but Burke hurried Harry along too quickly for him to get a proper look.
“I didn’t need Dumbledore to point this out. I’ve seen it for myself. I’ve lived it,” Harry said tiredly. “Look, if you want people to believe you’re doing something, maybe you should actually
“He will continue with his classes. For now, we won’t ask a mind healer to come,” Dumbledore said while Snape’s frown grew more pronounced. “However, we will revisit this decision should any other professors share Professor Snape’s concerns.”
“No, if I tell anyone... I think it has to be you. I can’t tell anyone else. Ron and Hermione wouldn’t speak to me anymore. I can tell you, but I don’t want to lose you,” Harry tried to explain.
“Not you,” Harry said and cringed when he noted his voice kind of sounded like a dementor’s. There was a raspy, rattling quality to it.
“Don’t answer that Harry,” Hermione advised. At her words, Mr. Runecraft immediately turned his attention towards her and he smirked unkindly.
Dumbledore politely offered Harry tea once they were back at the castle. Harry felt it was mandatory rather than a request, but he didn’t mind. He hadn’t had a cup of tea in ages. He might have used his excess magic to make Azkaban’s food taste better, but it wasn’t the same as the real deal. So, Harry accepted Dumbledore’s offer.
“Narcissa would have already demanded your aid if she thought could you help,” Mulciber pointed out.
“You’re coming back,” Ginny insisted.
“Your bat-shit crazy wife killed my godfather,” Harry answered.
The review took them all the way to the lunch hour. It had been haphazard, jumping from one subject to another as Harry recalled different parts of the curriculum. What little Harry could remember filled up the time until the guards arrived. The men quieted down as the guards handed out the meals. Harry was happy to see that Burke was not among them.
“There are other curses you could use. Doesn’t have to be an unforgivable,” suggested Lestrange. A moment later he seemed to realize what he has suggested so he hastily added, “though my wife would know the counter curses, so it would be unwise to use them against her.”
Both Lucius and Crabbe shared stories about the summer hijinks their sons got up to. As Harry tried to fall asleep that night, he kept wondering if he would have been part of the story had he accepted Draco’s friendship in their first year at Hogwarts. Harry didn’t regret sticking up for Ron, but he still spent the night playing the “what if” game. It kept him up longer than it should have.
“I have an interview set for tomorrow with a reporter,” Harry said after he decided to be honest and upfront with Nott.
“Don’t ask,” Theo interrupted. “The less we know the better. Now, Harry, let me see your notes?”
“That’s what the diary did. Ginny had one of
“Shut your mouth before something happens to it,” threatened Harry. His mum and Bellatrix were nothing alike, and he found it vile to even compare the two.
“You’ll be going straight to Azkaban,” Bradley told him.
“Anyone else?” Harry asked sarcastically once he levitated the bottle over to Mulciber.
Albert didn’t look any better than he had a few hours ago. The swelling and bruising had set in, so the man looked even worse off than he had a few hours ago. The blood he hadn’t washed off was now dry and crusted. When he got up to join the line, Albert was unable to move any faster than his initial return. Only Burke seemed please by the sight.
is it OK to hurt prisoners? Why is someone like B-, like Burke rewarded for hurting people? Why does he get to walk free while doing the exact same thing some of the prisoners were arrested for?” asked Harry.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered honestly. He really had no idea what the dementor was talking about. He hadn’t even known that the creatures could talk. They’d always been particularly interested in him, but they had never bothered to stop and talk before. Harry considered that it might be the most terrifying thing about this place yet.
“That’s one option,” Draco acknowledged. He couldn’t discount it without Harry turning his reasoning on him.
“-unstable,” sneered Snape’s voice. Harry was able to hear it from the other side of Dumbledore’s door. He stopped to listen to the conversation instead of letting them know he was there.
“Harry?” asked Albert.
“I don’t know. I’ve come across one before, but I didn’t know what it was,” Harry said as he thought about the diary. “Although... it was sentient. And the one in me isn’t. So-” Harry suddenly felt hopeful, “so maybe I’m wrong. Maybe whatever this is, it isn’t a horcrux.”
Harry’s state of mind did not improve until he started seeing people other than Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Seeing Neville helped, though there was a certain amount of guilt there too. It seemed Neville felt the same way.
“Do you still have your old Ancient Runes notes?” he asked. Hermione obviously hadn’t brought them as she didn’t anticipate Harry’s new interest in the subject.
“And you, Minerva? How do you feel Harry has adjusted to being back?” asked Dumbledore.
“Oh, save it, Potter,” Burke snapped. “I’ve been reading all about your innocent victim spiel. It’s dragonshit. I’ve already told the reporters that you’re guilty and getting what you deserve, just like everyone else,” he punctuated that statement by jerking Albert’s arm. He glared at Harry before adding, “it’s just a matter of time until they see it too.”
“Aww, is wittle baby Potter gowing up?” mocked Lestrange. His baby-talk sounded a lot like Bellatrix had that night. “Thowing curses like a big bah-oy…”
“Bastards,” muttered Nott.
Harry said nothing as the man took in Harry’s cell.
“Draco, you know I’m – Draco, please, you deserve so much better,” Harry pleaded with him to understand that Harry had pulled away, not because he didn’t want Draco, but because he wanted Draco to find someone better.
Harry had few memories of Theodore Nott that stood out in his mind. He settled for the time he realized that Nott was able to see thestrals. Nott looked uncomfortable being the center of attention, but Albert appreciated Harry’s gift nonetheless.
“Sometimes four if they’re feeling particularly vindictive,” added Nott.
“I don’t hate you,” he reassured. “I need you to start at the beginning.”
“Do you really want the added criticism right now? You know my judicial-wizard will push back hard against any attempts to deny his visitations,” Nott cautioned. “And I doubt the minister will be too happy if Potter is unavailable the next time he visits due to made-up offenses.”
“How... is-” Draco started but faltered and looked uneasy about whatever he wanted to ask. Harry waited for him to gather his thoughts. “He’s been there for months. People say... I’ve heard that it doesn’t take that long to... change...” Draco spoke in vague terms, but Harry knew what he meant. He too had heard horror stories about Azkaban long before he’d been sent there. Stories of people dying or going near catatonic after too much exposure to the dementors. Harry now wondered if the guards also played a hand in that. Sirius hadn’t talked about his experiences. The little he had shared with Harry hadn’t been good and Harry suspected that not much had changed in Azkaban over the past decade at least.
All in all, he made little progress with the mirror that day. In Charms, they learnt a spell that could link several brooms so that a wizard could send them out to clean his house and call them all back with a single tap to the location where they’d be stored. It wasn’t exactly the spell Harry needed, but it gave him an opportunity to ask Flitwick some questions about connecting objects. Flitwick emphasized there was a maximum distance before the spell broke down, but also hinted there were ways to increase that distance with what he called
,” teased Mulciber.
“Is there a way for your kind to check for these – horcrux, was it?” asked Ishanders.
“What did Mr. Nott say when you revealed this to him?” asked Hale.
“The boat is coming,” announced Bradley. In the distance, Harry could just make out a light. The sun had already set, so not much light covered the sea. A fog rolled around them which cut visibility even more.
“Yeah, but I meant... I think James is the other half of my soul. Like, he’s my soul reincarnated,” Harry suggested.
“Are you sure it was a horcrux?” Lucius asked faintly. Apparently the man had not realized exactly how valuable the diary was.
“Harry, he just wants to tell all his Slytherin friends,” Ron warned.
be punished for what they’ve done,” Ron insisted.
By the time the conversation naturally died down, Harry felt marginally better. It helped that no one had suggested either killing Harry or handing him over to Voldemort. Harry couldn’t be sure that none of them were thinking it, but at least they were willing to entertain the possibility that the horcrux could be safely removed. He hoped Dumbledore was doing the same. Perhaps he didn’t tell Harry about the horcrux in him because he didn’t want to worry Harry until he had a solution.
“I’m going to repay Nott for every
Flitwick was similarly concerned about Harry’s ability to catch up quickly on the missed classes. The charms lesson that day comprised of only a lecture, so Harry was unable to show some of his spellwork. Flitwick asked him to remain after class so he could explain what Harry had missed. He once again reassured his professor that he’d studied Hermione’s notes from those missed lessons. However, like McGonagall, this was not enough to reassure Flitwick. He offered to spend most of the lunch period reviewing the class content and answering questions. Harry was happy to agree as it meant he had an excuse to avoid the great hall and his gossip-hungry peers. Harry pretended to struggle with some spells to prolong how long his meeting with Flitwick went. Flitwick was patient with him, and ultimately declared he was happy with Harry’s progress.
“Yeah,” Harry said nervously, but when Draco moved away, he stood in Draco’s vacated spot and waited.
“No idea,” responded Harry.
Once again, the wizengamot fell into a vicious back and forth argument. Some confirmed the need for more witnesses, but others insisted that the prisoners were not a trustworthy source. Lucius being named as the only other eyewitness stalled any support Hale gained from wizengamot members.
“I don’t know!” Harry stated frustrated. “They’re being all vague. They want to know how I did something but won’t tell me what that something is. I wasn’t aware the dementors could talk.”
“I can,” one guard admitted reluctantly. He entered the room and approached Harry. Harry tensed as the man’s wand pointed at him but forced himself to pay attention to where and what the man was casting. Each time he felt magic run over his skin, Harry silently cancelled the illusion of the injury. It was a slow process.
There were some benefits to a home meal. Draco was able to set up Harry’s dining room with several romantic touches. He liberally decorated with Gryffindor red, though the only acknowledgement he made of it was to tell Harry red was the colour of love. An intricate centerpiece made with lilies took prominence on the table, though Draco made sure it was low enough that they could still make eye contact. Rose petals led from the table to Harry’s bedroom in case the night ended enjoyably.
Harry tensed, because of course it was Runecraft, and Bones hadn’t been wrong about Harry saying things just to spite him. Harry glanced at Albert and made a quick decision even though he knew he’d regret it on a personal level later.
you. Your aunt- you didn’t do it on your own. You did it for your mum. That’s a good reason. I thought I had a good reason, but I
“They don’t do that any more,” he tried to reason.
“Be careful what you admit to,” Draco warned.
if there’s something between you and boy Weasley, I’d want to know that bit of gossip,” Theo teased.
“Why? What did you do to him?” asked Parkinson.
“I did,” Harry whispered.
“We’re not so desperate that we can’t keep our hands off a child,” answered Nott.
“May I?” asked Lucius. Harry didn’t know what Lucius was asking permission for but trusted the man enough to nod in agreement anyway. A second later he felt flabbergasted when Lucius pulled him in to a hug. Despite his surprise, Harry sank into the contact.
say,” stressed Burke.
Ruby & imweirdthatsok: as you can see, I’m making the idea work ;)
“You love your dad, right?” Harry asked point blank.
“Weirdo,” Ron said, but he smiled at Harry when he pulled away.
HARRY POTTER ABUSED BY MUGGLE RELATIVES! was the headline that greeted him the next morning. Harry couldn’t bring himself to read it, so Hermione summarized it for him. The Dursleys were presented as magic-hating muggles that had tormented him for years. While true, Harry thought it wasn’t as bad as the papers were making it seem. The reporter made sure to highlight that neither the headmaster or the minister commented on the issue, but another ministry underling was quoted saying they were looking into it and would “rectify Dumbledore and Fudge’s past mistakes.” Harry thought it unlikely and dreaded what his summer would be like.
“Your appeal for prison reform was inspirational,” Dumbledore lightly praised.
“You were twelve,” Mulciber stated. “Killed a basilisk at
“Like a magical burp?” asked Crabbe.
“Are you ever going to ask that young man on a proper date?” asked Andromeda. She’d invited the Malfoys over for Teddy and James’ play date. Harry and Draco kept the boys entertained while the two older women caught up over tea. Harry had just stepped into the kitchen to get a glass of water, when Andromeda dropped that bombshell on him.
“I’ve reviewed Hermione’s notes,” Harry said.
, Harry thought,
She grinned and kissed him. Harry relaxed and marveled at how lucky he was. Ginny was amazing; far too good for him, but somehow loved him all the same.
“We’re not like that either. I don’t think Draco would want, er… he just never seemed interested in me in that way,” Harry answered and tried not to look at Lucius lest the man see exactly how impure his thoughts were about his son.
Having caught on to the fact that once Harry was in his cell, Perkins would leave but Burke would remain, Harry decided to try not getting on Burke’s bad side. He needed to survive this long enough for Dumbledore to get him out of this mess. It would be easier if Burke didn’t hate him. Even better if he could go unnoticed. Perhaps it wouldn’t be any worse than his summers trapped at the Dursleys.
Harry started with the transfiguration work. If McGonagall was going to be the deciding factor on whether or not he was allowed to go to his classes, then he had to make sure he impressed her. He allowed Hermione to review his essays. She corrected a few grammatical errors but found nothing wrong with the content itself.
“You’ll get it in time,” Lucius reassured him. Both Albert and Lucius were convinced Harry would master it with practice. Harry just resolved to stop looking anyone in the eye from now on. Just as well considering after the third day of radio silence from the outside world, their routine had finally broken.
“No, I-” Harry cringed and looked away from the guard in case his guilt was plainly written on his face. “No.”
“I think we need to look at James’ soul... and other children to compare,” Draco said. If he never managed to convince Harry to see himself in a good light, he could at least try to convince him James was his son and not something more sinister.
“You can’t avoid everyone forever,” Hermione added.
“You do realize Azkaban is meant as a punishment, don’t you?” sneered Hawkworth.
“Not easily,” Harry said. He couldn’t say wandless magic had allowed Harry to transfigure writing implements so Avery could draw the runes for him. Instead he told them that Avery explained their meanings to him.
Burke led Harry towards the bars. As they neared them, the bars moved aside allowing them to pass. Harry was pretty sure it was not as easy to leave as it was to enter. As they moved away from Anton’s office, the halls grew dim again. There were torches lining the way at regular intervals, but it was very mild light that guided them. Harry stumbled often and Burke pulled him closer every time.
“Not, er, not like he attacked me. He didn’t try to...” Harry trailed off uncomfortably. He couldn’t bring himself to say it. Hale was smart enough not to press yet.
The wizengamot was unwilling to get into a debate on the treatment of prisoners. After Harry had directed everyone attention to it, many of his naysayers were suddenly willing to move on to finalizing their decision on what compensation Harry would receive just to avoid a larger discussion on Azkaban itself. Despite Runecraft’s insistence that Harry was not owed any sort of compensation, he was largely ignored. Hale negotiated a monetary compensation of seventy-seven thousand galleons. Harry thought it was an insane amount but wasn’t going to refuse once he saw the sour look on Scrimegeour’s, Runecraft’s and the others’ faces. As minister, Scrimegeour had to issue to public apology for Harry’s illegal detainment.  The wizengamot did not agree to Harry’s request to investigate Azkaban, but Madame Bones did state it would be on the agenda of their next internal meeting.
“Let’s go,” Burke pushed Albert out of the cell. Harry fearfully looked between the two. He remembered all too clearly what happened to him the last time Burke dragged him out of his cell. Whatever Burke planned was likely to be painful and humiliating for Albert.
“Don’t pretend Azkaban cares about protocol or prisoners’ rights now,” Albert sneered. The guard looked as if he would insist, so Albert added, “I’d much rather keep the kid here, than risk him being alone with you lot. Didn’t turn out so well last time.”
harry had laughed softly, but still tipped draco’s chin up to connect their lips in a gentle kiss.
“you hearing yourself, malfoy?” ron asked with a quiet laugh, disbelief still lingering in his tone.
“you don’t want anything with me?” draco says softly, gently placing down his glass.
“how is harry supposed to know that if you don’t speak to him?” asked goyle.
draco was faintly aware of the fact that they were being watched by harry’s subordinates, but he found that he was unable to care very much. he cupped harry’s cheeks delicately in between his palms, pressing their foreheads together for a moment and staring into his eyes.
the furthest thing he could get from the manor, more muggle than not, small, secluded, and grassy. but home, nonetheless.
he comes with only three firm strokes, his head hanging limply as he shouts harry’s name and paints their clean sheets with his release. harry strokes him through his orgasm, one hand on his cock and the other wrapped around his waist, supporting his limp body.
“oh,” blaise said, leaning across the table and placing a hand on draco’s. “in that case, he’s definitely cheating on you. if i were you, i’d pack my bags, burn the house down, and run off to france. lucky for you, i slept with a witch in the portkey office months ago, so we can be in paris within the hour. come now, i’ll help you gather your things.”
“look at me,” harry murmured, using his free hand to gently grasp his chin. draco obeys, opening his eyes slowly and staring up at harry with a slightly dazed expression. harry stared down at him hard, pausing for a moment before beginning. “i love you. i love you so much. i don’t want anyone else.”
draco moved away from the cauldron, entering his store to find the bloodroot stems. he picked out a handful, and began to slice them. as he cut, his mind wandered away, deciding to focus on the part of the dream that he had been trying to forget.
“oh,” harry says quietly, looking down - he seems to deflate. “i didn’t know you had nightmares.”
“no,” draco sits up, pulling his feet from harry’s lap and straitening his spine, signaling that this was a
go back to their empty home and sleep in their empty bed and eat at their empty dining room table.
“the orgasm officer,” blaise snorted, despite being the butt of the joke.
today, harry had done all of these things alone - while draco had trembled in the safety of his study, practically wearing a hole in the carpeting.
they had figured out pretty early in their relationship that nothing could shut the other up quite like a kiss. most of their arguments ended with one pinning the other down to kiss them - and may conversations had been lost (and never recovered) after one of them had leaned in for a short peck.
“am i?” he asks, cocking an eyebrow. he turns back to harry, who still hasn’t moved. “go on, potter. tell her that i'm lying. tell her i’m a liar.”
the change is instantaneous, watching andrew transform from his familiar, light hearted self to the person draco knows he is at work: demanding, authoritative, and forceful. he drops his hand and steps in front of draco, puffing up his shoulders and sneering at harry.
a flush spreads across harry’s face as he laughs quietly and pulls away from draco, never one to take a compliment. he moves backwards until his back presses against the couch, and spreads his legs before gesturing for draco to sit between them. he obeys, and is pleasantly surprised when harry’s fingers slip through his hair and begin to gently massage at his scalp.
when he’s finally done falling apart, she lets him retreat to his bedroom, where he cries and hates himself some more. a few hours later, a note is slipped under the door, containing an address and a small message scribbled on it.
“forever,” harry returns - and then he leans forward and presses his lips to draco’s, like he means it.
“draco, thank merlin you answered. you will not believe this... this absolute shit!” came pansy’s voice - loud with anger and frustration. draco raised an eyebrow and blinked away his sleep. pansy frequently called him in anger, but her reasonings were always entertaining and different.
he stays with ron and hermione for nearly four months - sleeping in their guest bedroom and staring blankly at the ceiling, wondering silently how his life had turned out this way. he supposes the dramatic irony of it all is appropriate -  living with and depending on the goodwill of two people he had tormented for much of his childhood. they are kind to him, if not a bit awkward. it’s obvious that although they don’t seem to mind having him in the house, they’re not sure what to do with him. he tries to make himself useful, cleaning and cooking and generally staying out of the way, partly out of gratitude and partly because he’s unsure of where he would go if he didn’t have their support.
“i’m sorry,” he said again. before draco could react, harry reached out and pulled him against his chest, holding tight despite the way draco squirmed. he pressed his lips to draco’s temple, hugging him close until draco finally relaxed into the embrace. “i love you.”
slid through the small crack in the glass door and curled up at draco’s feet.
“oh, thank you, harry,” she says quickly, running her hands down her front. she grins at both of them, her eyes scanning over draco’s robes. “and you two - amazing, as per usual. are those new robes, draco?” he nods, but not before she continues, her eyes wide as she spins to gesture to the steadily growing crowd. “isn’t this just amazing? of course, i sent out invitations, but i would’ve never expected so many guests to actually show! and the guest list - oh, merlin and morgana both - some of the most renowned magi-zoologists and magical creature activists are here tonight… imagine the conversation, the opportunity! and not the mention the donations we’re sure to bring in - if everyone gives a bit, we’ll be able to fund the production of wolfsbane for at least five years, and possibly finish the st. mungo’s ward for half-humans!” she pauses to take a breath, grinning wildly.  harry places a hand on her shoulder, smiling genuinely. his eyes are warm and soft - it’s a look reserved only for family and friends.
draco’s not sure how or when he became a part of the group. it had started with granger inviting him out for a drink one evening - an olive branch that had quickly blossomed into a beautiful friendship. and then he was tagging along for pub nights - squished in between longbottom and lovegood like it was a completely normal thing to do.
“What is going on with you and Hermione, mate?” Ron asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
“You know you’re going to forgive her eventually.” Draco told him.
“Yeah, yeah, you get an O for therapy.” Draco said with a roll of his eyes. Harry laughed, grateful that he was finally starting to release the anger that he held. “I just don’t want you losing her friendship, even though I wish she were a bit smarter about her actions.”
“well, i didn’t exactly … speak to him.” draco admitted, straightening his posture. “my feelings were - are - hurt.”
it was one of draco’s favorite parts of harry’s body, the line of his jaw. he had spent what felt like centuries watching harry from across the table at the pub, fantasizing about what it would be like to press his lips to the skin there, to cup his face gently and not be shoved away. it had taken years for draco to get his chance - but he had held tight to harry and refused to let him go after that first fateful kiss. he had been privately infatuated with harry for almost three years before the opportunity had revealed itself - harry had taken advantage of his social and political influence for the first time and publicly pushed for the end of non-death eater slytherin persecution following a particularly weighty conversation between he and draco about the fact that almost all of the slytherins had fled the country post-war to escape retribution. weeks later, a bill had been passed, pardoning non-death eater slytherins and officially redeeming them, accompanied by a stirring anonymous letter in the prophet from the point of view of a persecuted slytherin, detailing their harrowing experiences after the war despite having had family members from different houses who fought valiantly on the side of the order. soon thereafter, pansy parkinson had returned to london from france - and after draco had finally stopped sniveling into her blouse, he had apparated directly into harry’s flat and kissed him full on the lips. it had been almost ten years since that night, full of tears and heated kisses and adolescent groping  - and draco still constantly found himself marveling at how far they had come. as hermione finally wrapped up her speech with a profound tagline that draco knew would be in the papers come tomorrow morning - “
“granger, i’m not sure how much more of this i can take,” draco moaned, sinking into a chair and burying his face in his hands. “my core is a mess and my magic has taken on the temperament of a small child.”
,” andrew had said softly, his fingers brushing draco’s. “
“do you want it?” harry asks lowly, his voice gruff.
the embrace is affectionate, but different from hermione’s. nonetheless, draco allowed himself to be held. when a fresh onslaught of tears began, he presses his face into ron’s shoulder and allows himself to fall apart a bit, and to be held together by ron’s warm embrace.
draco wasn’t sure what he had been expecting - maybe a sign tacked to the tree that read “
draco was silent for a moment - his sleep-addled brain conjuring memories, feelings, apparitions. he wasn’t sure what was real, or what was fake - he saw himself and harry twirling through the kitchen, kissing lightly in his office, laughing over dinner - a phantasmagoria from his and harry’s relationship, of the last ten years, of their future together. he thinks of the cottage, of the average life-span of wizards, of how long he’ll have to have nights just like this - to go through hell and then still wake up in harry’s arms the next morning, ready to do it all over again if only it meant that he could come home to harry, could have dinner with him and listen to his stupid jokes.
“i’m yours, harry,” he murmurs, his voice beautifully hoarse from harry’s intrusion. he drives his fingers all the way in, applying much-needed pressure to his prostate. “come for me, baby,”
“harry,” he says quietly, stepping inside. he’s sat on the bed, his back pressed to the headboard and his eyes fluttering shut, almost as if he’s drifting off to sleep. he’s slept like this before - when he had volunteered to lift some heavy pot for neville that couldn’t be levitated at the risk of altering its magical properties. he had whinged about his back for days, only stopping his complaining when draco had brewed him a salve and straddled him, rubbing it gently into his lower back. but now, harry’s face looks almost… slack - not tense with pain as it had been before. draco takes another step into the room, his eyes scanning their bed. harry’s hands are curled loosely in his lap, and between his fingers, is tucked a small, green bag. draco comes to a stop abruptly, his smile falling as he stares at the bag held loosely between harry’s fingers. it’s not empty - but draco knows deep down that harry has already taken some of whatever it was that was in it. “harry,” he chokes, that ever familiar lump in his throat returning. “harry?”
he didn’t understand why they acted like royalty, or why everyone else allowed them to. why they were still so invested in the whole blood purity thing when most of them had enough money to still be extremely powerful in wizarding society without all of the inbreeding and disowning business. why they were so stupidly strict, and continuously limited themselves to empty lives full of money but devoid of happiness for very unclear reasons.
draco looks away, willing himself not to cry.
for a few moments, draco didn’t answer - he chewed on his lip and pushed a sprig of asparagus around his plate for a moment before sighing. “we went for a walk today,” he said softly. “through the gardens. i asked her what her favorite flower was and she pointed to the pansies.”
harry crawls up draco’s body once more, kissing a slow line up his torso and the column of his neck. when he reaches draco’s mouth - still hung open in pleasure, he bites lightly at his bottom lip - toying with the plump flesh between his teeth. he transitions easily into a kiss, covering both of draco’s lips with his own and bringing a hand up to cup his face - a simple gesture that says a thousand words.
“leave it, malfoy.” harry says lowly - he’s realized his misgiving. his eyes are hard, and angry as he glares at draco as if he already knows what draco will say or do. he looks threatening, and draco’s entirely up to the challenge.
“you -” harry laughs dryly, rubbing a hand over his eyes. “subvert my - fuck, draco.”
“is there anything you’d like to say.” he repeats, smiling. “perhaps an apology?”
it’s his crying that antagonizes harry to the point of grabbing draco - shoving him against the wall and wrapping his hand around draco’s throat, pressing his wand to his forehead.
“oh, can he hear me? that must mean... oh, draco! things must be okay, then.” she pauses, and draco can hear her shit-eating grin through the phone. “things must be
this is what he thinks about as ron springs from the couch, pulling a distraught hermione into his arms. “what’s wrong? what’s happened?” he looks rapidly between draco and hermione, looking only a bit more confused than he does on any given day. draco looks away, not trusting himself to not dissolve into tears completely.
with that, he pushed past harry and achilles, marching up the stairs and slamming the door once more. after a few moments - during which harry gave achilles a personal tour of their home - a loud crack sounded from upstairs, signifying that draco had just diapparanted from the bedroom.
“nice place,” harry says, “it suits you.” still looking around. his eyes linger on the muggle appliances in the kitchen, and a small smile spreads across his lips.
then, draco drops his cigarette and snuffs it out with the toe of his boot, and they go home.
harry’s jaw flexed, and he looked as if he was holding himself back. before he can open his mouth to say anything, blaise wandered out of the kitchen, clutching a box of biscuits, his hand already rooting through the container. blaise froze in his tracks, grinning slowly as harry turns to stare at him.
he stares at harry, at the man he loved. still loves. might always fucking love - and blinks back heavy tears. just gazing at harry, standing before him, is enough to make his heart warm in his chest - the same pathetic way it had every time harry had looked at him, or touched him, or kissed him.
- draco knows every scar and mark that litters harry’s body, a collection of stories and tales of great heroism and even greater personal failures. he loves each one, has kissed and licked and stroked each mark lovingly. but now, there are new ones - fresher gashes covering previously unblemished skin, marring him, making this body unfamiliar to draco.
when harry would stand before the mirror and don his auror robes, draco would watch from the bed, his tongue running over his lips as he admired the way harry’s wand holster gripped his muscular thighs, and the way his t-shirt stretched across his wide shoulders. in the kitchen, draco would always prop himself up on the counter, nursing a mug of coffee and a slice of toast, while harry bit into a bagel and spooned eggs into his mouth.
“am i okay?” draco breathed, lazily opening one eye. “i just came three times, potter. i’m bloody fabulous.”
“did you say something about harry?” she interrupts, waving a hand to silence the witch. “what’s going on?”
draco buries his face in harry’s chest, tears falling hard and fast now. “harry,” he gasps. “i love you.” his fingers reach up, tangling in harry’s wild hair.
draco already knows it verbatim - he had been there when it was originally recorded, and had listened to it almost a thousand times since then. he listens anyways, savouring the sound of harry’s voice.
“just one of my many talents,” draco comments, taking another pull.
“still? even after everything?”
. he understands that draco struggles with their relationship sometimes  - struggles with showing the love that he feels inside - a remnant of his and harry’s relationship, and a permanent, brutal reminder of what had happened that night that draco had tried to show harry that he loved him. andrew is perfect and draco loves him so very much, more than he ever thought himself capable of after harry.
“so was he!” draco roars. dudley flinches away, shrinking in fear. there’s a long silence, during which draco stands and pockets his wand. dudley relaxes once more, although he doesn’t stop trembling. draco begins to stroll again, slowly. “dudley…. you know, you remind me of myself when i was younger. a bully. never having an original thought. doing whatever my parents told me to.”
harry is the one that makes the first move. he sits up, quickly, pulling draco into his lap and connecting their lips. they fall into the rhythm of the kiss easily, with draco’s arms circling harry’s neck and harry’s hands coming to settle on draco’s waist.
“and a hammock,” harry added, a soft smile spreading across his lips. he had closed his eyes, sighing softly. “i think i’d like to nap in a hammock.”
harry doesn’t hesitate to take draco into his arms, holding him close as he sobs wildly - large, gulping cries that rattled his entire body. “
harry was somewhere in the building - he knew that much. early in their bond, things had been this way often - granted, on a much smaller scale. harry would leave draco downstairs to take a shower or use the bathroom, and he would practically ache with the loss. when harry would appear on the landing once more, draco would find himself inexplicably drawn to him, and practically overwhelmed with the desire to frot against his leg like a child.
“someone’s eager,” draco giggled, sitting up and pulling harry close. draco wrapped his arms around harry’s neck, pulling him down and kissing him softly. temporarily forgetting what he had initially set out to do, harry fell into the kiss, stroking draco’s back gently as he got lost in draco’s mouth.
“excited, minister?” she asks quietly, a smirk ghosting across her red lips.
“slut,” goyle repeated, looking out the corner of his eye. blaise looked somewhat offended, but said nothing. “we’re malfoy’s friends.”
draco struggles, his movements sloppy and uncoordinated from his alcohol and grief. he uses his entire body to shove against potter, fighting his iron-like grip and screaming all the while. he’s not sure when he starts crying - when his screams turn to sobs and when he stops struggling. but he does. and suddenly, he’s standing in the middle of the street with harry potter, sobbing into his chest and being held by the wrist.
after a long while, harry and hermione made their way to the table - sharing a matching weary glance and soft smiles. most of the guests had already arrived and taken their seats, and refreshments and hors d'oeuvres were being passed around - draco had watched with mingled horror and amusement as ron had inhaled four spinach puffs without pausing to take a breath or a sip of water. neither sat down - instead, hermione leaned over the back of her chair, sipping elegantly but fleetingly from her glass of water before pressing a gentle kiss to ron’s lips and taking a few deep breaths. harry stood behind draco as she prepared herself, one sure hand resting on his shoulder and applying the faintest bit of pressure. hermione smiled expectantly at harry, and then they swept off once more, towards the raised platform to the left of their table.
harry sighed forlornly, putting a hand to the cold window. he knew he was being dramatic, but he felt he deserved it. his first day off in weeks, and he couldn’t step a foot outside the door without at least five layers on. to emphasize his frustration, he grumbled a bit more, glaring at the snow with enough heat to melt it away.
with harry away on his mission, groceries were lasting much longer, and draco found himself eating less and less. he wasn’t depressed, per se, but their marriage bond was only a few months old, and they had never been away from each other for this long. the three weeks they had been separate had been… hard, to say the least. during the first few days he had barely been able to get out of bed, and cast anything stronger than a weak lumos.
pulling out his wand, draco took a deep breath and flicked his wand gently. the flower patch reassembled itself effortlessly - shifting around to return to its former glory. draco remained still for a few moments, staring silently at the bed that had held harry as he took his last breath. a large part of his wanted to curl onto the ground again - to lay long and still until the grass and flowers grew around him and claimed his body as one of their own - until he could be reunited with harry.
“draco lucius malfoy, you sick bastard,” came theo’s voice from the living room. a small plastic bottle came sailing in, bouncing off of draco's head and clattering onto the table.
“right in the kitchen,” he murmurs, patting draco’s chin. “
” he had whispered, and they had spent much of the remaining evening rocking in slow half-circles and holding each other close.
“good morning, baby” he murmured into draco’s shoulder. unwittingly, draco flinched, knocking the sharp line of his joint into harry’s lip.
“or something, yes.” he said. his cheeks were starting to throb uncomfortably, as a result of the sickly-sweet grin he was holding. “it would be really fun!”
“pity, that.” draco murmured, putting harry’s mug down on the coffee table before relaxing back into his spot. he takes a draw of his hot chocolate, his eyes fluttering shut as he lost himself in the perfection of the moment.
“i’ll be back,” he said gruffly, turning on his heel and marching for the door. draco chased him - slowed by the blanket wrapped around his legs. as harry disappeared through the front door, draco shouted in frustration - grabbing at a plate from the dining table and chucking it at the front door. as it shattered, draco turned away, stomping back into the living room.
