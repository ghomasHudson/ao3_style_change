"You're in a hospital bed. You said you don't think you deserve this but you're not acting like it."
Draco nodded. Seven weeks before. Any Puddlemere fan would know that was the day they’d lost so definitively to the Harpies, and Harry Potter would know it as the day he’d gotten another notch on his broomstick. None of that was any of Braithwaite’s business, though.
Malfoy turns away from the window and Harry finds a door to the greenhouse and joins Malfoy and Luna for porridge. Harry is surprised to see the table is set for three. There are fewer bowls and pots and things today, though the gold-rimmed teapot and the floral cow creamer are out, and a pot Harry assumes is full of honey. And there's a bowl of porridge still steaming under a warming charm. Or, Harry assumes it's a bowl of porridge, underneath all the toppings—a mound of stewed fruit, shredded coconut, and walnuts all drizzled with cream obscure most of the surface.
“I’m pregnant,” Draco answered, finally. “And before you ask, I’m sure.” Draco couldn’t have borne it, had Harry felt the need to ask. “I’ve-I’ve been to St Mungo’s. I’m sure.” He screwed up the silk serviette in his hand. “And the baby is yours, Harry. I’ve not…There’s not been anyone else.”
But Harry would know that booming knock anywhere, it's the same booming knock that changed Harry's life eleven years ago.
“You’re still shaking,” Harry said, his voice gentle. He came over and sat beside Draco on the bed. He rubbed soft circles over his back. “What happened?”
Harry can't sleep that night. He lays in bed a long time, thinking of how softly Malfoy kissed Harry, soft and slow and with something like tenderness. But there's still this feeling in Harry's gut, this instinct to push Malfoy away before he kicks or curses Harry. A feeling in his gut and a deep confusion in his brain triggered by Hermione's question. Forgiveness is such a big and impossible word, Harry can't wrap his hands around it and feel its parameters, certainly it's much too big for 3am in his bed, but somehow he has to in order to figure this thing out with Malfoy.
Malfoy sets down his knife, pressing both hands to the countertop so hard his knuckles turn white. Then he takes a deep breath and picks up his knife again. "What's your problem, Potter?" he asks, carefully slicing into another onion.
Harry looks ahead to make sure Malfoy is far enough away before answering. "Just wondering why you're here," Harry says honestly.
Draco couldn’t help but return the expression, and the two of them stared at each other for an impossibly long moment. He imagined that this was something else written in Harry’s baby book –
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry answered, the smile evident in his voice. “I’m pretty impressed with what’s behind this door. Now close your eyes.” Draco did, and he felt Harry’s magic wash over him as the other wizard cast an
Draco heard the cheering of the crowd, and heard Marcus’s rousing victory speech, but all he could think about was Harry Potter.
Ron comes up behind Harry and puts an arm around his shoulders, steering him toward the floo. "That's good news, Harry," he says, calm and sure, "Stable they said. Stable is very good. And Healers aren't like Muggle doctors, breaking one thing to fix another, Malfoy will be good as new, you'll see."
"I read the other day—" Hermione is saying, as Ron puts his arm around her shoulders and she leans into him, a pleased little smile on her face that Harry's been seeing a lot this year. They told him last week they'll be moving in together at the end of May. He and Ron have been living at the Burrow when they're not living in their office. Mrs. Weasley had cried when Ron told her. Harry hadn't but he'd kind of wanted to.
Elianna glided into the room, feathery and graceful, but Draco frowned as he unhooked the message from her leg. It wasn’t the note cancelling their rendezvous that he'd expected. Instead, it was the very last thing that he’d ever thought Harry would have gifted him: a copy of today’s
Harry chuckled at that, and Draco watched as Ron threw his arms around Harry, clapping him on the back, the pair of them laughing at their shared joke. Draco stood, uncomfortable, his hands wrapped around his middle in a very defensive posture, feeling like a Pygmy Puff in the den of a dragon. Usually, he was a fairly self-assured person, who owned the mistakes that he’d made as a child and strived to do his best he could. Now though, all of his confidence seemed to have deserted him.
Harry gives himself over to despair for a moment in the privacy of the hallway and then goes out to face Malfoy and Ron, together.
He is unsure about how much he should tell Ron and Hermione about the future, so he settles for a, “There’s something I have to make sure I write down. I promise I’ll answer your questions and eat your soup, after.”
Draco huffed out a breath, won over by Harry’s enthusiasm. “Alright,” he acquiesced, clipping the buckles of his satchel together, and swinging it over his shoulder. “But somewhere small and unassuming! I don’t need to be on the front of the
It was too late to rescind his invite now. Their baby was, after all, half-Potter and if Harry wanted to be involved, Draco couldn’t deny him.
Draco has made him breakfast. Well, Draco usually makes him breakfast but this feels different. Draco has his back turned to Harry, standing at the counter fixing his coffee which seems to take a very long time today. Harry wonders if he should be saying something and wonders long enough that it begins to feel weird he hasn't spoken yet and Draco won't look at him and he's starting to panic when Draco turns around, coffee held in front of his chest like a talisman.
The front door opens for Harry as well but there's no Malfoy on the other side. Harry waits just inside the door in the empty hall for about two minutes before he decides he's not going to wait around like an idiot for Malfoy to find him.
showed that Harry was due in fifteen minutes, so that meant there was time to do one last run-through of his home, and double check that everything looked spotless.
The waitress comes to take their order, smiling like their bickering is cute. Malfoy orders the ricotta with balsamic roasted grapes on brioche. Harry orders nutella on sourdough. Malfoy frowns at Harry like he's going to say something about nutella being pedestrian so Harry cuts him off.
Malfoy pinches a sprig of rosemary off the bush and smells it, pleased, and that small pleased smile reminds Harry he was looking forward to Malfoy's porridge this morning. It's just that it makes Harry's belly warm. And it's perfectly sweet. Harry doesn't even have to ask for it, or honey or anything. It must be what it's like to have a mum, porridge just waiting on the breakfast table for you every morning, just the right amount of honey.
Finding the hem of the other wizard’s scruffy Muggle tee-shirt, Draco slipped his fingers beneath the thin cotton and let his fingers explore the hard, muscly skin beneath. A disastrous fall had put paid to Harry’s professional flying career two years before, but hadn’t ever broken the other man’s spirit. Harry Potter was still the fittest, fastest, and most astute Seeker in the whole sky whenever the two had one of their regular training sessions. A sensual heat rolled through Draco, and he thanked Merlin, Morgana – any deities in the vicinity, really – for letting him have this opportunity. Truth be told, Draco couldn’t believe his luck.
“Hey,” Harry says, and bends down slightly to pet its soft fur. The collar reads ‘Petrol’, and he smiles at the name as he scratches behind its ears and the cat chirps contentedly.
"We kissed only yesterday. I don't suppose we could simply enjoy ourselves for a bit before bringing up our soul crushing war time regrets, hmm?" Malfoy asks, taking Harry's hands and putting them around his waist. "We could, for example, kiss more. There could be a lot more kissing."
And if he's setting the kettle out he'll of course need to brew some tea—a quality assam because Harry Potter probably isn't drinking a good Sumatra. Though he should be, he thinks, fetching the cream from the cold cupboard to fill the pretty floral cow creamer.
“Harry! Harry, are you okay?” Hermione asks, stretching a warm hand towards Harry and helping him back on his feet, pulling him into a hug.
For a good while there's only clinking china and Luna's humming and the cats purring and then Luna says, "These are very good rock cakes."
Millie gave his hand a small squeeze. “Well, I’m excited,” she declared. “A baby Malfoy! The world won’t know what’s hit them. I can’t wait to meet a mini-Draco. They’ll be hilarious! They’ll be telling us all off before they can walk.” With that, she stepped towards the doorway. “I think that Greg and I need to open another bottle of red, and make a toast to the future Slytherins of Hogwarts. Not you though. You get another Pumpkin Juice.”
Harry nodded. “I’ve made him tell me about it a dozen times,” he answered, eagerness blatant “I’m excited! A little bit nervous too.”
Luckily for Harry there's an intermission when Ron comes home and Malfoy serves them pasta e ceci and a radicchio, arugula, and endive salad. Unluckily for Harry, this intermission is rather brief.
“Molly, love. We don’t worry about the old formal ways here,” she twittered, giving him a grin. Draco had expected the witch to offer up her hand to kiss, but instead she scooped him up into a hug. It was a bit of a shock, but it wasn’t unpleasant. It was just unusual, and Draco started to believe that this weekend would go well. She pulled back and gave Draco an appraising once-over. “Look at you,” she admired, “don’t you look handsome? It’s no wonder Harry here is so smitten.”
"Yes, yes alright that could work. You won't forget the preservation charms? And the warming spell for the tea?"
Draco flitted around his flat, unable to settle to anything, and nearly pulling his hair out with the tension of waiting. Bloody hell, why had he thought this was a good plan? Draco marched into his kitchen, tapping his kettle with his wand. He didn’t really want a cup of tea, but he needed to keep busy. It wasn’t too late. Perhaps he could pretend the other father was a random chap he’d met at a nightclub, a wizard he hadn’t known the name of…
Doing as he was told Harry withdrew, and even that felt good to Draco. Harry returned with another finger, and the burn of it was so bloody enjoyable. Harry was everything Draco hadn’t known he was craving, and he gave Draco plenty of time to get acclimatised, scissoring his fingers and opening him wide and ready. Harry was a great partner in bed. He was patient, dexterous, and intuitively understood Draco’s responses.
“Long enough,” Harry answered, “and you were right, Draco. I am enraptured, entirely. Every day I daydream about our little one. They’re all I can think about.”
There’s a weight in his chest. A soreness that feels old, like a scar that still throbs from time to time or a broken bone that never healed quite right and gives him grief whenever the weather turns. He thinks of the joy in the face of Other Harry. Of the story told in photographs on the mantlepiece that tie clues together in his mind, of just how different this Harry’s life is. The photograph where he passes a Quaffle over to Teddy who flies towards Malfoy with it under his arm; the photograph where Hermione and Malfoy sit in a room he doesn’t recognise, and he stands in the background, holding a baby shaped bundle, smiling; the photograph of him and Malfoy with a small black kitten on the floor in front of them.
The sound of Orpheus scratching at the glass tore Draco from his spiralling panic attack, and he pushed open the window. The Eagle owl swooped in, with a small piece of parchment tied to his leg.
Malfoy whisks the dry ingredients together and then starts grating the carrots on a box grater, humming a little to himself. As he cracks eggs, pours olive oil, smells the vanilla, he wears that pleased little smile. He looks up at Harry and the smile is still there.
Their next port of call was the pregnancy clothes department, and Draco wasn’t about to have Harry simpering and bothering him while he was being measured. He dispatched the other wizard to go and inspect the racing brooms while he brought himself new outfits. Harry had pouted, rather gorgeously, but Draco had held firm. No doubt Harry would have spent another dozen Galleons by the time they were reunited but that was his choice, and not Draco’s business.
“I’m sure that I’ll have read worse headlines,” he answered, his lame joke failing to raise a smile from his co-parent or any of the collected Weasleys. “Let’s hear what Skeeter has to say,” he said, turning to Harry. “It can’t be that bad, can it? It’s not like we’ve done anything wrong.”
“Stop, you prat,” says Other Harry. “We knew this would happen. I took every precaution. They just don’t know that.”
Malfoy smiles down at his bowl of porridge again, and Harry, realizing he's watching Malfoy again, promptly shoves a huge bite into his mouth and chokes a little.
Other Harry is chopping onions and Harry decides to get closer, walking around the table quietly and standing at the edge of the table opposite the counter Other Harry is working on.
"That's not what you asked though, Potter. You asked if I feel bad about the things I've done. Because you need to see me suffering enough to deserve to kiss you and I won't play along with that mind fuckery."
Harry gets up from the table avoiding eye contact with everyone and goes out to sit on the back stoop, taking deep breaths of the chilly night air. He's so sick of all this sympathy for Malfoy. Like Malfoy wasn't a complete shit who teased Harry about having dead parents for fuck's sake. But Malfoy is also the complete shit who's been feeding Harry for a month now. Making things he likes, giving him cake, getting him drunk on very drinkable Sangiovese wine in the Tuscan countryside. He doesn't know how to reconcile these two separate and entirely different Malfoys and it's driving him a bit mad.
“Harry,” Draco said, sitting down on the cover on his bed. Bloody hell, but his voice was shaking. “Harry, it’s me, and- Circe, I don’t even know what time it is, and I know I walked away from the Café today, but-”
It took mere moments for Harry’s Patronus to materialise in Draco’s Lounge. Salazar, but the stag was an impressive beast. Its antlers seemed to span the width of the room, and it glowed, iridescent with Harry’s fearless magic.
Harry is surprised Malfoy likes something as tender as hand holding but then again, based on the way he kissed Harry last night, Harry might need to reconsider his expectations about Malfoy and tenderness. Malfoy's hand is warm and dry and every once in a while he rubs his thumb across the back of Harry's hand. Harry scoots a little closer.
Malfoy scoffs. "Yes it must be terribly difficult for you, creeping around my back garden and eavesdropping."
"Yes, well," Malfoy says, "I'm quite sure I know more about grocery shopping than you, given your propensity for take out."
Draco tore off a piece of creamy-coloured parchment from the Daily Specials Menu, and jotted down the name of Mediwitch Hayes, and her department. He pushed the paper over towards Harry, before taking out his wallet. Draco took out a Galleon – it was far too much money, but tipping well was a particular point of pride – and he placed it next to his empty cup.
Harry nods, his cheeks bulging with wheaties, not that Malfoy can see. He's facing the hob carefully lowering eggs into the pot of boiling water. There seem to be four different recipes in progress, judging from the open cookbooks across the counter. Anyone else's kitchen would look a disaster but Malfoy has everything set up in neat little stations, ingredients gathered round a cutting board or bowl, cookbook nearby.
"Now we need to get good bread. That stuff you buy is completely devoid of both nutrition and flavor. I'm not sure how they even make it, it seems to be made of more air than flour."
When the time comes for visitors to leave Harry promptly ignores it, sitting under the invisibility cloak until the night Healer does her last check and then getting back into bed with Malfoy. Malfoy snuggles close to Harry with a happy sigh that makes Harry melt a little.
That made Harry stand himself. He palmed the stiff bulge in his trousers and gave Draco a once-over that burnt with an intense heat. “That might just be true. Bloody hell, Draco. If you could only see how good you look. I don’t know how long I’ve wanted this.”
Harry is surprised, actually. He figured it was horrific to live under the same roof as Voldemort and all his sycophants but he never really wondered if they directed that vitriol toward Malfoy. "Did they…?"
There is no rushing, though. The kisses get deeper, dirtier even, but never quick and desperate, the way Harry is used to. Harry is entranced, ashamed and completely and utterly ruined by the fact he can’t look away, not even when his cock (wilfully ignoring Harry’s inner turmoil) finally comes to life when Other Harry throws a leg over Draco’s body and bends down to kiss him, again.
Harry didn’t offer any more information and they walked on in companionable silence. The pair of them soon entered
Harry swung to his help, understanding intrinsically the dilemma that Draco found himself. He gestured to Victoire, and the witch slid down from her chair and went to sit on Harry’s knee. “Draco
Draco remembered feeling like this at Hogwarts. He remembered the dissatisfaction of his every exchange with Harry, how his insults never cut deep enough; like there’d always been something else, something more, that he’d wanted to say. He’d always felt like he was three steps behind the play back then, like Harry had already caught the Snitch while he was still lacing up his leathers. Right at this moment, Draco felt exactly the same.
Glaring at his mate, Draco flicked his wand and sent the magazine soaring back to the table where it lived. Bloody hell, but Greg was slovenly. Every so often, sharing digs with Goyle during Away matches felt like Hogwarts had never ended.
"You inherited both the Potter and the Black fortune. I cannot understand why you are so preoccupied with the price of everything."
“Maybe we’ll skip those,” Harry replied wisely, his face breaking into a soft smile at Draco’s very weak joke.
He has to get out of the hospital for a bit. Harry walks out the main doors of St. Mungo's to the city streets. The sun is peeking through the clouds and spring feels right around the corner. Harry just wanders. Past tube stops and people in suits and small busy parks and coffee shops and theaters. Eventually he finds himself in front of the flower shop Malfoy took him to and goes inside.
Bloody Greg was an annoying bugger with his stupid reasonable arguments. If Harry wanted to be involved then Draco knew he’d be forced to see the glittering git regularly, and be rational and accommodating.
, could it? Sickening fear gripped him. It couldn’t be. He was only halfway along, and his baby was far too small.
to live with him, that he's not just a resource drain and eyesore people get stuck with out of guilt. "But—" he tries again, and then shrugs helplessly at Ron, who gives a warm chuckle and walks over to bundle Harry into a tight hug. Hermione comes over too, wrapping her arms around both of them, resting her cheek on Ron's shoulder.
"Draco," she exclaims, coming around the counter to hug Malfoy. She holds his shoulders and peers up at him. "Oh how you've grown! What a pleasure! What a pleasure! You look so like your mother! How is she?"
He takes Harry to ceramicists (potters, Potter!) in the Cotswolds and Harry has speckled jugs and pitchers and creamers pressed into his hands until he decides on a sunny yellow creamer just to get Malfoy to shut up.
“Rampaging Horntails wouldn’t keep me from it,” Harry answered, his hand never leaving Draco’s tummy. He seemed giddy, and Draco could see the fondness – the
Draco wasn’t sure how to answer. He hadn’t thought that he might actually be happy about carrying the baby, and excitement seemed a long way off too.
The produce from his Italian farm share materializes in the basket just as Draco's pouring his coffee and he stands beholding it for a moment. Draco can think of no greater delight than a bounty of produce and all the happy potential contained within, except perhaps the delight of kissing Harry. Today he gets to have both, he thinks happily, taking a sip of his dark Sumatra roast coffee.
Harry shakes his head. "I'd rather you got started on this Malfoy thing. The Healers still don't know what curse he was hit with. I can handle twenty minutes on the Auror floor."
He sleeps the whole night through and, even though he wakes with a jolt as what he now recognises as Draco’s alarm goes off, he did remember to bring a pillow with him and his neck isn’t as ruined as it was the night before. He wonders if it’s time and dimension hopping that is so tiring, or if it’s just the conflicting feelings he now has about Draco Malfoy.
Harry turns off the stove and looks down at his soup full of off-color mushy vegetables and makes a decision.
Harry spends the afternoon curled up behind Malfoy, breathing in the soothing smell of his hair and feeling the movement of his ribs underneath his hand. Hagrid's visit reminds Harry there are other people in Malfoy's life that ought to know he's in hospital, namely Malfoy's mother. He probably should've realized sooner, but Harry's never had parents to contact when he's been injured so it didn't occur to him.
“Good morning, gentlemen,” Judith said, giving them both a moment to organise themselves after they stepped through the Floo. “I’m very happy to meet the pair of you. I can promise you that the homes we’re visiting today represent the best magical properties currently available on the market.” Her eyes drifted over Draco’s grey cotton shirt, and she smiled. “If a family home is what you’re looking for, you couldn’t have picked better than Whitsand Bay.”
Luna pulls some raw meat out of her bag and holds it out to Harry. "I thought we might make a trail of meaty gingerbread crumbs."
Draco didn’t quite know what to do with himself. He raised his fork to his mouth, thought better of it, and then placed it back onto his plate with a small click of metal against china. He swallowed a gulp of water before he trusted himself to speak. “How long have you known?”
September was always an odd time of the year for Draco anyway, and even when he hadn’t been expecting, the month always felt suffused with melancholic memories of Hogwarts and his childhood. He’d always detested leaving the Manor to return to school, and having to reaffix the cold, unfeeling Malfoy sneer onto his face and live according to Lucius’s expectations.
on Harry’s coffee. “Was a cappuccino alright?” Draco asked, realising with a start that he didn’t even know which coffee the other father of his baby drank. “There’s so many choices, and I’m never sure.” He nodded to his own cup. “Dedicated tea drinker.”
him. Harry wraps his arms tightly around him. "I think… I think I don't really know how relationships are supposed to be."
That answer didn’t suit the witch. “It shouldn’t be!” she said, not caring that the whole room had fallen silent. “It’s that cockroach Rita Skeeter,” she clarified, finally relinquishing the dreaded rag. “She’s written a so-called exclusive! I’ve a good mind to Apparate to Barnabus Cuffe, and hex him until he sees sense! It makes me sick, Harry!” she said, her brow furrowed. “You saved the wizarding world! You ought to be allowed to live the life you wish. Why does yours and Draco’s private lives have to be a matter of public property?”
Harry's less angry. He still thinks it's presumptuous, but presumptuously, well, kind. Malfoy is being kind.
. He heard the small creak as the door opened, and he felt the press of Harry’s hand into the small of his back, encouraging him to step forwards. He took two steps, and then Harry took his hand, all warm and steady, radiating with care. “Okay,” Harry instructed. “Open them.”
"It looks very… green." It looks like it tastes gross is what Harry's really thinking. "What's it taste like?"
Draco broke off a piece of garlic bread, and ate it, impatient for the main courses to arrive. Harry and he were sat in Fratelli’s, closeted in the same booth as their previous date. Draco hadn’t realised how hungry his visit to the hospital, followed by a morning shopping on Diagon Alley, would leave him.
“I’m not in love with Harry,” Draco said quietly, humiliated because both he and Goyle understood he was lying. “We’re making the best of it! We're co-parenting. It doesn’t matter what’s between us, long as our little one is loved.”
"Shut up," Harry says, but he leans up for a kiss, and then another and another until Malfoy says he really needs to feed Yip dinner.
Luna chatters on to Harry, telling him about the herd—how helping Hagrid care for the sick creatures has really been helping her as well, what she's named each of them, which of the Thestrals really like blackened bananas—as they walk them to the wooded area within the Manor wards.
"It's fair to ask. You may not like that we have a violent history together on the opposite sides of a war but we do—"
Harry shakes his head, still chuckling. "I wasn't offering to adopt Nagini and run away together. It was just an offer like, hey, maybe we don't have to kill each other. This Malfoy thing is harder. I never wanted to snuggle Voldemort."
later, and then Harry was padding to the bathroom to use the loo and brush his teeth. Draco slid under his sheets.
“Forward,” he says, voice strained with disuse. “Future,” he says, part of him still unwilling to believe all of it was real.
“Food poisoning,” Greg said, airily, nonchalantly examining one of the parchments with a frown. “Draco can’t seem to shake his dicky belly. Luckily for the rest of us, I don’t reckon what he’s got is catching.”
Luna wanders in to get a vegan chocolate cupcake. She takes her time choosing and then turns to Harry.
Draco laughed at Greg’s praise, but felt a little self-conscious at the same time. He led the way into the kitchen, where Adrianne had prepared a small lunch for the two of them.
Harry is confused until Luna gestures at the painting of the unicorns grazing in the field. Only they're not grazing anymore, they've all gathered at the edge of the frame as if vying for Luna's attention, which she gives them, running her forefinger over the unicorns' backs, while they flick their ears in pleasure and let out pleased snorts.
The Mediwitch only smiled. “Many witches gain clairvoyant abilities as they get older,” she replied. “She might very well be correct.” With that, she shook both their hands. “You are doing tremendously, both of you” she said, looking between Harry and Draco. “Whatever you’re doing, it certainly seems to be suiting the pair of you. I’ll see you both at twenty-weeks.”
The Paternity Department wasn’t anywhere near as dreadful as Draco had feared it might be. The walls were cream and calming, and the paintings on the wall were all splashy modern art. A large bouquet of begonias decorated the Receptionist’s desk, but they’d been magicked to have no fragrance and Draco was profoundly grateful. He leafed through a copy of
Harry discovers he quite likes polenta. The texture put him off a bit at first but it's warm and comforting like porridge and tastes really good with the bloody oranges.
Harry picks out some large white and gold narcissus and wanders around for a long time trying to figure out what else will go with it until Neville appears to take pity on him and picks out some small feathery green bits, shaking his head at Harry while he rings Harry up. Harry walks back to St. Mungo's with it, getting kindly smiles from older women on the street like he's a good lad.
spell, and Harry’s mouth broke out into a wide grin every time he looked down at the picture. “I was expecting to feel overwhelmed – overcome – but not this massive surge of love.” He shook his head, bemused at himself. “December the tenth,” he added, referring to the due date that Hayes had given them both. “You’ll be giving birth during the European Cup finals.”
Ten minutes later Harry is at Tesco comparing tins of tomato soup. He gets the one that looks the fanciest.
Then Malfoy brings a slice of strawberry to Harry's mouth and Harry inhales sharply, surprised and… something else. He opens his mouth slowly and Malfoy slips the strawberry inside, his fingertips lingering at Harry's lips while he chews.
? Harry sucks in a harsh breath. He remembers the last time he saw Narcissa Malfoy, crying into a handkerchief trimmed with dainty lace, as the Ministry delivered her house arrest sentence.
Harry's not sure why he says it, it's not any of Malfoy's business, and given that Malfoy sold Harry out to Rita Skeeter on more than one occasion it might be quite risky. But Malfoy just sits there looking stunned, a pink biscuit stalled halfway to his open mouth and a little pink himself.
Now that he's seen Malfoy, held him for a bit, he's starting to notice things like his stomach is grumbling and he smells like stress sweat. He takes off the cloak in the loo and then Floos back to the flat. Ron and Hermione are at the kitchen table just like last night, only instead of beans on toast it's Wix Wheaties now.
Except for the persimmon mush that's true, so Harry ignores it. "But grapefruit is bitter. And for middle aged women going on diets," Harry says, thinking of that unfortunate summer Aunt Petunia decided a quarter of grapefruit made an appropriate breakfast.
. How did you end up with this hanging on your wall? Why, precisely, has this never come up in conversation?”
Ron lets go, and Hermione is fussing with his hair and his clothes, and making sure he is, in fact, all in one piece, but Harry knows he’s fine. He knows what he has to do.
Harry barely has time to realise what is happening before he’s assaulted by the nausea and the disorientating feeling. When he finally realises what the pulling at his gut and the tingling on his fingers and toes means, he’s falling on his arse, already back in the dark old Grimmauld Place he knows, face to face with Hermione’s bright, worried eyes.
He pulled a gorgeous yellow shirt from the front of his wardrobe, one he’d brought in Muggle London earlier that week, and stood in front of the mirror, holding it up in front of himself. It’d be fine. Today wasn’t anything special. It was only brunch. It was only Harry Potter.
It was simple, straightforward and didn’t give Harry too much in the way of wriggle room in case he decided that seeing Draco was just too dreadful to contemplate. Meeting publicly had an additional benefit too. Harry wouldn’t be able to make a scene or be horribly furious with him. The public were still far too invested in him for there to be any chance of them having a public spat.
“How do we do this?” Harry asked, voice low and eager. “I’ve never had to work around a bump before.”
“One moment,” came the voice from within, muffled behind the wood. Harry rolled his eyes, made a wry face, and then the door swung open to reveal Molly Weasley. “Harry,” she exclaimed warmly, “you’ve finally brought your young man, and earlier than expected too! Dinner won’t be long, love. Just need to mash the potatoes and glaze the carrots. Come here and give me a hug!”
“Don’t stop,” Draco said, moving to close the space between them. He already missed the whiskey-warm taste of Harry’s mouth and the clean, sweet smell of his aftershave. He cringed, hating the want in his voice, the needy plea. Even back at Hogwarts, back when the two had fought on opposing sides of a war, Draco had fantasised about kissing Harry, and how the Chosen One might feel under his fingers. Now he finally had the opportunity, Draco frantically hoped the higher powers weren’t about to snatch it away. This was the finest he’d felt since the whistle had blown for the start of the season. “We’ve scarcely begun.”
Harry rubbed a hand over his face, and spoke again. “Today at the Café? You told me that you’d fallen in love with me. What if I felt the same, Draco? What if I said I wanted everything the
“I don’t want you to be here because you feel obligated,” Draco answered. “If that’s your reason then, maybe we’d be better off not… You know, before we start– “
A pillow is grabbed from the head of the bed, and slid right under Other Harry’s crotch so his hips are lifted slightly. And that’s when Draco moves down his body and lowers his mouth between Other Harry’s cheeks. That’s also when Harry makes a very undignified and unadvised squeak and Other Harry lifts his head towards the armchair. He only looks for a second or two, head falling forwards again due to Draco’s attention, but those two seconds are enough for Harry to feel like he was not seen through, like he knew Harry was there. Their eyes had locked.
“Very Slytherin of you,” Harry answered. “Very clever. I like that plan immensely.” He paused then; his eyes mischievous. “I have to admit something, Draco,” he said cautiously. “It wasn’t a slip of the tongue that brought you here. I did it on purpose. There’s something that I wanted to show you… It shouldn’t take long, and I can see that you’re tired, but could I?”
Harry almost laughs at the thought of ever looking through a brochure for an antique shop and finding something he loves, but Other Harry perks up as Malfoy walks back into the room.
"Thank you," Malfoy says, with that little pleased smile of his. "Well shall we get back to it? I'm looking forward to having a real table again."
“Draco,” Harry said, cutting him off gently. “You asked me a question, and I was truthful. That’s what you want, isn’t it? I’d be fibbing if I said that having a baby wasn’t a big deal, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t want to be here. I do.” He took a long swallow of his tea, and Draco wasn’t sure that he was going to speak again, but he did eventually. “I want to be a part of our baby’s life, before and after they’re born. I didn’t have my dad growing up, but I missed him and my mum, every single day. I always swore that if I ever had my own kid, I’d love them with everything I had.” Placing his cup on the table, he sought Draco’s eyes. “And now I do. Bloody hell, but this isn’t how I thought I’d have a family, but there we are. We’re having a baby, and I do, truly, want to be here.”
Draco halted just as they were about to step into the immense fireplace and pulled Harry aside from the milling crowd.
This time, Harry was sitting beside him. The wizard had been perfectly supportive, and Draco couldn’t be happier. Very soon he’d get to see his baby once more. He wondered how much bigger they’d grown in the last month, and whether he’d be able to make out any of their features yet.
Draco made no attempt to hide his curiosity about this home that was so utterly different to how he’d imagined it. He cast his eyes around, thinking just how incredibly
His excuses had sounded weak at best, and Draco was entirely sure that Mother had seen through the lies.
“It’s good news,” Draco answered quickly. “I’m excited. Going to be a dad, Pansy! It’s all a bit overwhelming.”
Harry lifts his head from Malfoy's shoulder trying not to look too put out and goes to sit at the table. Malfoy hums a little as he goes back and forth between the table and the pot on the stove, setting the table with all the usual pitchers and bowls and stirring the porridge. Malfoy stirs porridge for a ridiculously long time because he insists it makes it creamier so Harry's stomach is rumbling by the time Malfoy sets a bowl down in front of him. It's sweetened just how Harry likes. Harry will never tell Malfoy, in fact he'll take this to his grave because it would make Malfoy unbearable, but Harry tried to make himself porridge one Saturday and couldn't get it sweet just the way Malfoy does. He scrapes his bowl clean.
Greg made a gesture of defeat with his hands. “Looks like you’ve got it all worked out,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders. “Though I still think you should talk to him. Hear it from his Chosen Mouth and all that. You can’t know what Harry will say unless you talk to him.” Draco tried to cut in, but Greg hadn’t finished. “Harry’s not a complete prat, Malfoy. It could easily be Harry knocked up if you’d made a single different decision on the night, and wouldn’t you like to know if he was carrying your kid? You’ve made a big brave decision and now you’ve got to live with the consequences. He’ll be fucking livid if he spots you in
Harry may or may not be moving on but the morning moves right on without him and he has to go to Malfoy Manor with the knowledge that his and Malfoy's tongues got well acquainted last night.
He wants Harry to have real pajamas and real tea and a really delicious breakfast in bed made by Draco so that Harry gives him that half smile Draco is addicted to.
"Isn't it always," Ron says, bringing plates over. "Speaking of, who eats take out on real plates? The whole point is eating out of the container."
"Probably. I just quit my job. And I'm dating my childhood nemesis, and also he's in the hospital with organ damage and it's my fault."
“Does this feel good for you?” Harry asked, and Draco would have laughed at the obviousness of the answer. He didn’t though. He couldn’t. There wasn’t enough breath left in his body for that.
Harry snorted at that and flipped over a pancake. “Why does that not surprise me in the slightest?” he replied, the smile evident in his voice. “Sorry if I woke you. I didn’t mean to. These were supposed to be our first-full-of-day-living-together surprise.”
Pansy was the closest thing Draco had to a sister, and he loved her immensely, but she was a witch with headstrong opinions and a very sharp tongue. She’d never hesitated before sharing either of those with Draco before. Draco highly doubted that she would this time, either.
Harry didn’t answer. All he did was look at Draco, very intently, and perhaps a little nervously too. Draco didn’t know whether or not to kiss Harry again, although he really, really wanted to.
Mediwitch Hayes gave him a kindly glance. “Please don’t worry,” she said. “Everybody here is entirely non-judgmental, and we deal with lots of different pregnancies, and lots of different fathers. No two are the same.” She sat back and found Draco’s eyes. “That being said, I do counsel that you at least inform the other father about your condition. It’ll be helpful to have details of his family history and a measure of his magical strength, just so that I can calibrate any potions you need appropriately.”
It didn’t take long for the two wizards to get dressed, and they padded down the empty corridor as quietly as they could, not wanting to garner any more attention. To Draco’s entire relief, the witch on Reception couldn’t have cared less where the two of them were going. She took three Groats as payment for the return journey, and handed Draco and Greg the Floo Power from a box kept behind the desk.
“My trousers don’t fit,” Draco answered eventually, knowing that the anguish in his voice was quite out of proportion with what he’d actually said. “Not one single, lousy pair. I’m as round a ruddy cauldron, Harry,” Draco elaborated, “and I’m not even halfway through! I’ll be the size of Wiltshire by the end. I’ll be the size of the bloody
The landing gives him no clues, and he goes through the spare bedrooms, the study, the library and the kitchen. He heads down to the cellar from there and doesn’t find the cubbyhole where Kreacher used to sleep, assuming either Kreacher doesn’t exist in this world, has passed away or agreed to go to Hogwarts full-time. Somehow it’s easier to believe Kreacher simply doesn’t exist in this scenario.
The last thing Draco wanted was to change Harry’s mind about him, and their baby, even if it had been in his power to do so. Draco could accept that Harry might not want to be involved, and that was alright. It truly
Malfoy pauses, blushing again and not quite meeting Harry's eye. "I thought maybe we could go back to the Manor. I could make something."
If Draco’s answer had been unconventional, then Judith’s professionalism masked her confusion. “But of course,” she replied, leading the two of them back to the ostentatious fireplace. “Two down, and one to go.”
He wonders what Neville would think of Malfoy apologizing for Harry's sake. He wonders what the difference is between remorse and responsibility. He wonders which or both or neither of these things is a necessary first step to an apology. He wonders if Malfoy's right, if demanding suffering from people who've committed bad acts is a warped sense of justice. Eye for an eye and all that. But maybe guilt isn't the same as suffering—and Harry wonders yet again, can someone feel bad about their actions without feeling bad? Harry certainly never has.
Draco felt his face flush red. Greg, the silly git had no idea about Draco’s internal mortification. Merlin, this had to be one of the most embarrassing things that had ever happened in his life. It ranked high on the list alongside being Transfigured into a ferret, being caught wanking off Cousin Everard when he was fifteen, and the time he was bitten by Mother’s pet Crup.
Frantically, Draco began to pull them off, frazzled, and stressed that his plans had suddenly gone awry.
“Maybe I’m allergic,” Draco said, nodding to the flowers that Marcus had kindly swathed with a protective layer of magic.
“Oh Merlin,” Draco moaned, as Harry pushed in with one slick finger and Draco had to grab fistfuls of the quilt cover, screwing his eyes tight shut. The other wizard slowly worked his way up to two fingers, and then he was pressing them inside of Draco, and,
Before long it was time for Greg to leave. Millie was expecting him; they had an appointment with their wedding planner, and then Greg had to get an early night. The new season’s training regime started in scarcely a few weeks, and the Beater needed to get back out on his broomstick. Draco had supposed he might feel envious when Puddlemere’s year began in earnest once more, but now it had arrived, he found that he didn’t, not truly. Other exciting events loomed far bigger in his future.
Harry shakes his head. "Were you listening the whole time? Were you just laying in bed pretending to be asleep for hours like a complete fucking psychopath?"
"Yes," Malfoy says through a big yawn. "Thank you for the flowers, they're prettier than I would have expected."
Malfoy is wearing black boxer briefs when he gets out of bed and makes for the bathroom, and if Harry’s pulse quickens at the expanse of exposed skin, no one needs to know. He would never know how to explain it, if someone asked him, but Draco Malfoy is unexpectedly beautiful in the way he speaks, moves, and carries himself.
Harry watches him walk out of the kitchen feeling paralyzed. The kitchen table is still stacked with the platters of cupcakes Malfoy made for Harry's housewarming party. Shouts and laughter filter in to Harry as if underwater.
-scary?” She pulled away, and found Draco’s eyes with her own and he saw a flicker of hesitancy across her pretty face.
Draco laughed at that. “Thought I was supposed to be the melodramatic one,” he said. “Besides,” he grinned, wriggling out from beneath Harry and getting unsteadily to his feet, “I’ve seen you play Quidditch. You’re a beast, and my settee is an antique. It’ll be in splinters once we’re done with it.”
Draco tried to steady his breathing, tried to breath in through the nose, and out through the mouth, but a muffled, broken sob emerged instead. Why hadn’t he read his pregnancy books properly? Why hadn't he paid more attention? He was naught but a fool and an idiot, and now he was sat alone, in pain, in the fucking dark.
The two of them made their way slowly through Wizkids, and Draco felt a little overwhelmed by the choices on offer. There were complicated looking pushchairs that could be charmed tiny and hidden in a cupboard. There were Quidditch themed mobiles to hang above cribs, and there were charmed toys, magicked to make patterns dance across their child’s ceiling.
“Are you fuck!” Greg replied amiably. He played with loose thread on the hem of his tee-shirt. “You don’t suddenly get allergies aged twenty-four Draco. That day we lost against the Harpies, and you and Potter… What was it? Six weeks ago, and- “
"I was thinking after breakfast you might like to see the stretch of forest within the Manor wards," Malfoy says.
“Don’t you worry your blond head about that, Malfoy,” Harry answered, moving on to look at a display of dragon soft toys. He picked up a stuffed Hungarian Horntail, gave it a look of disgust, and placed it back on the shelf. “Ron and Neville both said that they’d buy out every item with a lion on it on Diagon Alley. Seamus reckons he's going to hang a banner in the little one’s nursery. Apparently, they’ve planned on taking their uncle duties very seriously.”
Harry shows up at the Manor, greeted by Yip. The smell of something baking leads him to the kitchen, where Malfoy is still in his pajamas for once. He greets Harry with a long lingering hug and a sweet kiss on the lips, then another on his cheek and another on his neck.
“Only if we’re late,” Harry said cheerfully, leading Draco up the garden path, and past the much-commented about pig-pen, enclosures full of clucking chickens, and some very well maintained-vegetable patches. “Please don’t worry,” he continued, pausing as they arrived outside the cracked midnight-blue of the Burrow door. “The Weasleys have been my people since I was eleven, but now you and the baby are my family. So, you’re every bit as welcome here as I am.”
“You’re absolutely sure?” Draco asked doubtfully, sitting down gingerly on the bed. Courtesy had been learnt at his mother’s knee, and it felt very difficult to shake off. The idea of a twenty-minute nap, however, did feel very appealing and the mattress was very soft. He masked a yawn with the palm of his hand. “I don’t want to be ill-mannered.”
"I don't think I can be an Auror anymore," Harry says as Ron approaches the table, a paper cup of tea in each hand.
That makes Harry laugh a little, because he did in fact tell the murderous snake-faced bastard he could turn his life around.
"Actually," Harry says, coming closer. They're a pale pink, like Malfoy when he's doing his Flobberworm impression and Harry… kind of likes them.
finally revealed one that’d got lost in the detritus of his drawer. It might have been left there a while, but that wasn’t any of Harry’s business. Throwing them in Harry’s direction, Draco sprawled back on the covers. Fuck, but he needed this. There hadn’t been anyone since he and Cormac had ended acrimoniously, over six months before.
, you’re pregnant and then suddenly Harry’s everywhere; the best thing since Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour-bloody-ice-cream! Malfoy, you’re my best mate, you have been forever, and I don’t want to see you get hurt again.”
Predictably, the same old feelings of envy flowed through him, much the same as they had when he was seventeen, and visions of Harry and their baby flew, unbidden, into his mind. Their little one would likely spend half their life visiting the Burrow and being passed around various ginger-haired relations, and the thought of it made Draco feel sad.
, a Muggle movie that Harry had claimed was a must-see classic, although Draco couldn’t for the life of him understand what was so alluring about godfathers. He’d had a revolving clique of faceless Ministry wizards in the role, men under the sway of Lucius’s influence, and they’d vanished like the breeze the moment he’d been convicted.
I’ve wondered for seven fucking years how awkward this would be. Told myself when I got to it I’d know how to do it and just get on with it, but this is actually excruciating.”
"Some wine has more tannins which are bitter or more minerals, or is aged in different barrels, or a million other things that I don't actually know because I'm not a wine snob, but which make some wines a more, let's say, acquired taste. But everyone loves a Sangiovese. At least that's what Andrea told me."
"Starved," Harry says. And it's true, walking through the fields in the warm sunshine and looking at rows of vegetables and the smell of the bush next to him has whet Harry's appetite.
"I don't know. Just interesting, in a way. You without your family history and me crushed under the heel of mine."
“Don’t judge me because I’m fancy,” Draco snorted, amused. Draco seized a particularly plump velvet pillow from beside him, and tried to side-swipe the other wizard with it.
“I most certainly will not,” Harry answered, frowning, his voice steady and set, “and don’t you ever say that again! I’m not about to tell the world that I’d be ashamed of being in a relationship with you, because the truth is, I wouldn’t be. Bloody hell. If the
Ron snorts. "Look at them, they like this. Hermione's probably wanted a friend to have lively academic debate with since she was three."
The thought doesn’t last long. Other Harry is whining, Harry is trying not to. Draco’s gorgeous, long, pale fingers are dipping into Other Harry, Harry’s breath is coming out in quiet pants that shake his whole chest.
Draco bent his head to the side, listening hard. He was willing himself not to get upset at Harry’s earnest words, but it was a failing struggle. A traitorous tear prickled, and then it slipped down his cheek. Draco cringed internally. Harry would think him a senseless, silly witch.
“Congratulations on the pregnancy,” Ron said, his blue eyes grazing over Draco’s bump for a moment. “Harry is entirely obsessed, of course, and bores us all daft with the endless baby talk. Mum is equally as bad. The pair of them can talk about sleep schedules and other such nonsense for hours, which is a mercy because that way at least he isn’t talking to ‘Mione and me.”
"I'll give you a discount on any of the Potter merchandise!" Ms. Quincy says back at her seat behind the counter.
Harry expects Malfoy to laugh, to tease Luna for saying something weird and absurd, but Malfoy just hmms. For a while there's just the sounds of tea sipped and cutlery clinking.
"Yeah, coming," Harry says, but he stays where he is looking at Neville. Neville, who once took on Crabbe and Goyle at a Quidditch match to defend Harry. If Harry remembers correctly they put him in the Hospital Wing. He doesn't know what to do. He just looks at Neville helplessly.
He pulls a bowl out of the cupboard he saw Other Harry go into and eats the same cereal Other Harry has just eaten. He doesn’t recognise the brand, but it’s lovely and sweet, and he wonders if he could attempt to find it once he gets back. He realises he didn’t have dinner the night before, too confused with this situation he was dropped into. Confident neither Draco nor Other Harry will be coming back any time soon and unsure about when he’ll get to eat again, Harry raids the cupboards, the fridge, and the pantry. He makes himself some toast after he finishes his cereal.
“Well, yes,” Draco said, spearing a green bean in his fork. “Granger isn’t wrong. You will be an awesome father, Harry. That isn’t even a question.”
"Thought so. Well rest assured that I'm paying Mr. Weasley quite well for his time and whatever debasement he undergoes stepping foot on this property."
The other players were pissed off, recriminations flew around the changing rooms, and Draco showered in silence and shame, annoyance running through his veins. His bad luck snarled into a tangle in his chest, hard and heavy.
"S'not that bizarre. How much of it d'you think he really believed? I mean, he was saying 'you'll be next Mudbloods' in second year. What twelve-year-old actually thinks their classmates should die? You'd have to be a Voldemort-level psychopath."
Harry walks past the bed into the bathroom, which has a gold and porcelain claw foot tub big enough for Hagrid and gold fixtures and a crystal chandelier.
As always when Harry Potter arrived anywhere there was a moment of awed hush from the other tables, but the unruly-haired wizard seemed to take that in his stride. He walked over to Draco’s table and sat across from him. Draco thought Harry’s hair was a little longer than it’d been during their night together, and it curled a little at the ends where it was still damp from being washed. Merlin, but Harry was an attractive man.
There are a dozen baby artichokes, the leaves tinged a dark purple, tucked into every nook. Draco might steam them and stuff each leaf with buttery herbed breadcrumbs. There's a beautiful head of radicchio, leaves glossy and tight that might become a gently wilted salad with melted parmigiano. And the three pounds of fava beans Draco ordered, that he can't decide what to do with because he's too excited—maybe he'll eat them on toothpicks with pecorino like he's in Rome. There are bunches of fresh parsley, some storage onions and potatoes, and fresh strawberries. And hidden at the bottom of the basket there are some beautiful stalks of red and green rhubarb.
Harry is stunned. He crumples the kale leaf he was angrily ripping off the stem in his fist, staring at Malfoy and all he can think to say is, "No they're not."
Draco made a firm decision. He’d let Harry have his Sunday, let him have his hangover and his lazy brunch with the Weasley-Grangers. Then, on Monday, he would send Orpheus, his Eagle owl, flying over to Twelve Grimmauld Place.
Harry can count all the baths he’s ever had on one hand, and none of them a particularly amazing experience. He knows Hermione loves them, to the point Ron has gotten George to start making bath bombs and bubble mixes for the shop. Harry reckons he’d get too restless, sitting there on his own in slowly cooling water, staring at nothing. He doesn’t know how people do it.
Harry met Draco’s eyes through the glass. He looked concerned. “Do you think Narcissa will deny our baby?” Harry asked, a hard edge to his tone. Draco liked that Harry was wands-at-the-ready to defend their little one, but he shook his head, turning to face the other wizard.
At some point it occurs to him to let Ron and Hermione know where he is. When he Floos to their flat it's dark outside and Ron and Hermione are eating beans on toast at the kitchen table.
"Yes, Potter, thank you," Malfoy says with a huff. "Anyway, after that… Well I suppose that's rather heavy."
Harry's standing in a patch of wizened rose bushes, peering into a greenhouse attached to the house and trying not to catch his Auror robes on the thorns, when he sees Luna Lovegood. She's sitting inside the greenhouse at a little glass table, the person opposite her obscured by a monster monstera, but it must be Malfoy. So naturally Harry creeps closer and, pulling an Extendable Ear from his robe pocket, crouches underneath a window that's opened a crack.
He starts down the right hand corridor feeling like a first year at Hogwarts again. The Manor may as well have been designed by a rabbit for all the sense the layout makes, corridors branching and recombining in a maze of parlor rooms and studies and boudoirs and ballrooms and potions laboratories and libraries.
“Bloody hell, matey,” Goyle said, pulling away and looking down at Draco’s resplendent new tummy. “You smuggling a crystal ball underneath that shirt of yours?” Smirking, Greg continued his teasing. “I don’t know. I go away for a couple of months on holiday, and without warning, there’s gotten to be a whole lot more of you.” Greg shook his head good-naturedly. “Suits you though! You’re the only pregnant wizard in the whole of London that seems to have got better looking the bigger you’ve got. Bloody hell, but Millie’s cousin looked a fucking horror when he was in the pudding club. Spotty. Greasy hair. The whole works. You look like you’ve been spared the worst of it.”
wine for the three of them, but he didn’t murmur when Draco demurred, and asked for a Pumpkin Juice instead.
Draco’s ears pricked up at that comment. He knew that Harry had told his friends around the same time he’d told Mother and Pansy, but he hadn’t liked to ask what their replies had been, fearful of their condemnation or disapproval. Draco had even worried about Howlers, or a crew of Weasleys arriving at his door, livid with him for ruining Harry’s life. Teasing, and a bit of mild House banter he could definitely cope with.
A few quick waves of Malfoy’s wand send plates and glasses gently flying out of cupboards, gracefully, in a way Harry never managed himself. The table is set and Malfoy walks out into the hall, shouting back, “I grabbed the Autumn brochure from the antiques place in the corner of Diagon Alley, there’s a couple things you’ll love.”
Draco crept out of bed and padded to the door, picking up his wand from where he’d abandoned it the night before. He
It wasn’t better to know. Knowing meant making decisions. Knowing meant talking to Harry, and the prickling of horrible humiliation that he experienced whenever he thought about that night. Knowing meant everything would have to change and Draco wasn’t sure he was ready. He wasn’t sure that he ever would be.
"It's impossible to dislike French food," Malfoy says, whisking quickly now. The sauce in the pan, which momentarily looked chunky and unappetizing when Harry first poured in the milk, is starting to become smooth and creamy.
"Small mercies," Ron says. "I don't know about the whole forgiveness thing, but I can say you've been a hell of a lot happier since you started going to the Manor."
“Harry,” he says, and Harry startles and sits very still. “I know what you’re thinking right now. I do, because I was in your position not long ago. Believe it or not, you’re not in a different universe, or timeline, or dimension. Whatever you’ve been trying to convince yourself you’re in is wrong. You can keep giving yourself all kinds of arguments as to why this can’t be real, but all you are is a good few years into the future.”
He can’t find a blank piece of paper but does find a French Onion Soup recipe Luna gave him months ago and he’s never even tried, that happens to have a blank back. Harry smiles fondly after a quick glance at the ingredients: onions, garlic, bay leaf, Port, Worcestershire sauce.
His Mother only laughed at that; a light, joyous sound. “And when have I ever been wrong about such things Draco?” she asked, ringing her bell to summon Adrianne to remove their plates. “A new baby daughter, precious not because of her family name or for the value of her dowry, but simply for who she is. The most loved baby in the world.”
Draco knew he’d be celebrating with the rest of the team that night, hitting the bars and clubs of wizarding London, drinking his weight in Firewhisky, and likely finding their way to the front of the
“Merlin,” Marcus said. He made a clumsy snort of laughter. The man was a brilliant captain, well attuned to his team, and Draco knew that he’d have immediately picked up on the tension between Greg and he. “You’re as white as parchment, Malfoy.” He paused then, and made a decisive face. “You’re going to see the team Mediwix next week, no debate. I’m going to get you a fizzy pumpkin juice. You need a hit of sugar.”
Sadly, their special moment didn’t last very long. The seamstress coughed, and Harry hurriedly broke their embrace. As he pulled away Harry kissed his fingers, and pressed them into the side of Draco’s bump.
"Yeah because everything's about you. No I just… It's been a while and I don't know what to expect."
Somehow, without Harry noticing how, Malfoy ends up in front of Harry's flat again. They have Harry's loaf of crackly bread and Draco's impulse buy of vanilla bean custard filled kouign amann with them and Draco is asking Harry for tea and Harry doesn't know how to say no. He also doesn't know if he wants to say no.
“That’s my elf’s doing,” Harry admitted. “Kreacher. He’s a bit of a git, but he’ll love you, Draco. The moment he gets a sniff of your pure-blood heritage he’ll not look twice at me again.”
Malfoy appears at the end of the aisle and Harry, without even thinking about it, steps in close for a hug. He wants to be held and Malfoy does just that, setting down the basket full of flowers he's holding to wrap both arms around Harry and rub his back.
Had his mummy, or Pansy, or anyone else that he loved have asked him later, Draco would have denied the sobs that he burst into at the Mediwitch’s news. After all, it wasn’t like he hadn’t had fair warning. It felt very different to actually know, though. Hayes carried on speaking as soon as he’d wiped his eyes and gotten his breath back. “She’s the perfect size for twenty weeks,” Hayes said, “so your due date remains the same.”
It soon turned out that Harry’s descriptions of the Weasleys as ‘pretty full on’ had been more than apt. Draco soon discovered that the Burrow was so named because it resembled a rabbit warren, one that flowed in a way no architect would ever have planned.
The two of them stripped then, and moved to lay down on their sides, and it was as if a spell had been cast. Everything seemed to slow down. Harry kissed and him all over, and Draco revelled in the other man’s body heat and the raw, realness of his attraction. Soon, they were rocking into each other, and Harry’s hands felt like they were burning everywhere they touched Draco’s skin. Sensual heat pooled in Draco’s belly and he leant in, pressing a dozen little kisses over Harry’s jaw.
After a few minutes Draco carried on their conversation. “Pansy said something equally silly,” he commented, taking his fresh drink from the tray of their waiter and raising it to his lips. “The witch actually said that you and I were as ‘hopeless as each other’. It would seem that our friends know the contents of our hearts far better than we do ourselves. Salazar save us from the matchmakers.”
“Do I want?” Draco asked, wonderfully disjointed. His body felt lax and loose. “I want you,” he answered, revelling in the unabashed truth of it. “I want you, Harry. I’d love it if you fucked me. It’s been ages.”
"I only cook with meat that's not bloody. And only sometimes. Rarely even. I can't stand bloody meat any more. I have suffered from exposure to bloody meats, and now I don't eat them. Besides which, this roast is
Harry cut him off. “Draco,” Harry said, shoving his hands down deep in his pockets. He looked sheepish and the colour was high on his cheeks. “You-you shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble. I’ve got plans… Ron and Hermione. I’m meeting them at the new café in Chimaera Park… I should go.”
Harry shakes his head. He's gotten through this year by putting his head down and getting his work done, and his work is catching the Death Eaters. It's someone else's job to decide their fate.
Harry takes a tiny bite of the yellow mush, then a larger bite, and discovers it mostly tastes like honey and something… floral?
That was Pansy all over though. His best friend was always trying to match him up with somebody. That her newest quarry was Harry Potter came as no surprise to him whatsoever. It was high time to change the subject. “And how is my dear godson?” Draco asked, knowing that his friend could babble on for hours on that particular topic.
Other Harry summons a small dark wooden side table from the corner of the bathroom and levitates it down gently until it’s right by the bath. Draco comes back up the stairs, two glasses of white wine levitating in front of him and a bowl of strawberries in his hand.
“Okay?” Harry asked, waiting for Draco’s consent, the blunt thickness of his prick nudging Draco’s entrance.
Then, at that thought, his quill stops as his breath catches, a big blot of ink forming at the end of his last sentence.
For a moment Draco beholds the produce spread across his countertop, letting the simple delight fill him up. With another sip of coffee he starts to bundle everything away, putting the greens in the cold cupboard and piling the citrus fruit into a large ceramic bowl and displaying it on the counter. The onions and potatoes are put in the dry cupboard and then Draco turns his attention to the extras, piled beside the basket—parmigiano, actual parmigiano from
“You should go to sleep,” Harry said, nonchalant as anything. It was hard to believe they’d just shared the best kiss of Draco’s whole life. “You need your rest, because we’ve got a big day tomorrow, Draco. We’re looking at houses, remember? I’ll Floo in at half-ten and pick you up.”
“And I know Grimmauld’s a bit ramshackle, and quirky and no, it isn’t beside the sea, but I think we could be happy here, Draco.” Harry said, taking his hand from Draco and gesturing around them. “I don’t want our baby to have two homes and two separate lives. I want our baby to lay down, each night, knowing that the two people who love her the most in the world are safely within these four walls. You and the baby, you’re my family. And I want us to be together. I know Grimmauld isn’t modern or magnificent, but I think we could make it something really special. Last night, I asked you to give me a chance, Draco. Move in here, with me. This is a home for a family. Let me give you and the baby the happy life you deserve.”
Harry cupped his cheek, and Draco let his eyes flutter closed. He leant in. Draco was close enough to feel Harry’s breath ghosting on his skin, and the murmured words. “Thank you for our baby,” he said.
“You like it,” Harry said then. “Oh, thank Merlin. For a moment I thought I’d laid it on too thick. Over-egged the pudding.”
Draco couldn’t stand it. Perfect Harry, holding his hand, kissing his bump. Perfect Harry, buying up the whole of Wizkid’s, and telling the
"Look, I'm going to go," Neville says, pulling his coat out from the pile on one of their kitchen chairs. "I'll see you around."
makes out that we’re together, then that’s on them. We know the truth – know what we are to each other – and that’s our business and nobody else’s. It’s just- Draco, you do know that my coming to your flat, and to St Mungo’s… That isn’t only because I care about the baby? You’re not some lock to be broken with an Alohomora, and then cast aside when our little one arrives! Bloody hell. When I said I wanted to be by your side, the emphasis was on the
Malfoy squeezes his hand and let's go as they enter a tiny market shop with a few baskets of pristine vegetables, rows of eggs in soft greens and blues and a graying older man with a sour face behind the till.
– but he also recognised that now, ten minutes before their hospital appointment, wasn’t the time to bicker or to pick fault. Instead, Draco let himself be seduced by the illusion that he was still beautiful – still alluring – and that Harry’s words were the truth.
Harry’s lips were red and shiny when they slid off Draco’s penis, and Draco watched as he wiped them, roughly, on the back of his hand. His hair was sticking up at every angle, his abs flexed and powerful muscle moved under toned skin. Harry was a jigsaw puzzle of delights, and Draco didn’t know where to look first.
Malfoy's still asleep. Harry doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but he does know it freaks him out because the last time Malfoy slept all day he was slowly turning blue and losing consciousness. Harry pulls a chair over so he can hold on to Malfoy's slender wrist and feel his fluttering pulse.
Checking his feet are covered by the cloak, Harry presses himself against the wall and watches. Harry hasn’t seen Draco Malfoy in a while, if he’s being fair, but never in a million years he would have thought he could look
“Draco Lucius bloody Malfoy,” Pansy said, very quietly. “Harry Potter, who you’ve been obsessed by, and half in love with since you were eleven? Harry Potter, that you used to whine and cry
“Everything looks tip-top,” Mediwitch Hayes said, twisting and flicking her wand in a complex pattern as she measured and evaluated the baby. She gave Draco an unreserved smile. “You’ve got yourself a very healthy, very happy-looking baby. They are measuring exactly where I’d like them to for the dates that you’ve given me. Their heart, organs and the magical centre of their brain all look well developed… The placenta is in a good place and your waters look good. I’m very pleased.”
"One must draw the line somewhere. Oh, look at this one. There's a whole section on buckwheat flour."
Narcissa’s eyes flicked down to their joined hands. “A mother’s instinct,” she replied. “You’re a powerful wizard Draco; even as a child you threw off Muggle illnesses as easily as a charm. Darling, love: no force would have you out of the sky unless it was something very important. When Adrianne told me that you’d been eating sweet things, and napping in the afternoons, my inkling was confirmed.” She smiled, and gave his hand a squeeze. “My cravings and tiredness were precisely the same when I was carrying you.”
Puddlemere United weren’t the smart bet to win the League. Considering their form, they’d be lucky to escape relegation. There’d suffered loss after loss, until the prospect of a win felt like a distant fantasy. Snitches were stolen from under his nose and snatched from the ends of his fingers. There’d been mocking headlines on the back pages of the
Harry Potter might be coming to his home, he might be spending many hours a day with Draco but Draco did not ask for Harry sodding Potter to be his bodyguard, nor does he need Harry sodding Potter to be his parole officer, so he most certainly will not be making Harry sodding Potter breakfast, thank you very much.
Harry doesn’t bother being careful or silent as he gets up from his chair and leaves the kitchen in a daze, not knowing what to do with himself. He sits, staring at the photograph-covered wall, eyes jumping from familiar smiling face to familiar smiling face, processing all he’s learned. He hears Draco get home and wonders just how long he’s been sitting there.
All around him the eyes of his ancestors scurried across him, and he heard their murmured whispers emanating from the canvasses. Draco shivered. It’d been a while since he’d been in such an ancient magical residence, and he hadn’t missed the experience.
“Was that good?” Harry asked afterwards, entirely too earnestly. “You and the baby, you’re both okay? I wasn’t too rough?”
Malfoy's furniture is all doll sized, the sofas as big as one of Harry's thumbs and tables the size of his palms. Malfoy pulls piece after piece out of the bag and organizes it by room.
“You look all in,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand in his. His voice was laced with concern. “I’m sorry. It’s been too much today. All these faces – all these questions – and I should have bloody known that Cuffe would save our story for the Sunday edition. Always a slow news day,” he joked, giving Draco a warm smile. “Come on. Let me show you the guest bedroom. You can have a lay down, and-”
“Oh,” Draco gasped, as his lover’s long, slick strokes ceased. A delicious look of attention crossed his face, and Harry’s fingertips made very precise, very sensual circular motions.
Making his excuses, Harry walked over to where Draco had been sat, and held out his hand to him. “You look like you need a drink,” Harry observed. “I know I could do with one."
It doesn’t take long for his Auror instincts to kick in, and suddenly Harry’s wand is out and he’s cataloguing the house like a crime scene. Not that there’s a protocol for accidental time-hopping, or any kind of time-hopping at all, really. But Harry looks for clues. He needs to know when he is and who lives in this place in order to figure out his next steps. This is the Grimmauld Place he knows, only cleaner and lived in, much unlike the dreadful dark place Harry currently lives in. This place feels… joyful. There are pairs of shoes thrown about in the entrance hall, there are comfortable-looking pillows on cosy-looking sofas with soft-looking blankets hanging from their backs. There are pictures on the walls, books on the shelves, food in the pantry.
Harry and he had only been there half an hour when Draco came to a shocking realisation: he was genuinely enjoying himself. He glanced towards the other side of the room, his ears automatically finding Harry’s voice among the crowd. Harry was having an animated discussion about the next Quidditch season with an older Weasley – Bill, if he remembered correctly – and he must have felt Draco’s eyes, for he turned around, catching Draco watching him.
The witch folded the details of Twenty-two Marlborough Road back into her satchel, and when she spoke, she addressed Draco and Harry both.
Draco wanted to play Quidditch for England. He was at the top of his game right now; fit as a flea and flying like his life depended on it. Having a baby meant he’d miss a whole season of play, and when he came back, he’d be out of form. He’d be slow, and out of shape. Louis St Clare would take the Pudd’s top spot and he’d end up warming his backside on the sub’s bench.
The weird siphoning empty ache on Harry’s chest comes back when Other Harry mumbles a, “Love you,” in the vague direction of the bedroom door as Draco Malfoy leaves.
"No," Harry says petulantly, crossing his arms over his chest. "You're going to kiss me and distract me. Malfoy, this person attacked you. I'm not letting this go until you explain yourself."
Hayes made a noise of agreement. “Please don’t be. I promise that this’ll be a lovely bonding experience for both of you. Okay, so I’m going to cast the spell now. Draco, be prepared for the sensation of my magic.”
Annoyance flared up in Draco’s belly. Why on Merlin’s green Earth did Goyle have a problem with him seeing Harry? He’d been the wizard telling Draco that he had to be honest and tell Harry about their baby. What had changed in the last three months?
Malfoy proceeds to offer his opinion on Harry's towels, hangers, forks, and mattress as well as his opinion on things Harry is not buying like frying pans, pots, cutting boards, knives, and the vegetable peelers on offer.
“Adrianne,” Draco complimented, spooning mustard onto his mashed potatoes, “you’ve outdone yourself. This is first class.”
“Yeah,” he says, and stops himself, watching Hermione walk back into the room, face still just as worried as when she left.
Malfoy looks down at his body. "No I'm not, they go over your legs. Are you trying to trick me? I know they go over your legs, I'm not an idiot."
Yes, Harry had gotten more tactile with their bump – and Draco shivered, imagining he could still feel Harry’s magic from the kiss minutes before – but that, surely was more about him bonding with the baby than getting closer to him? The wizard was clearly besotted with their little one.
Harry arrived a few minutes later, Flooing in at ten-thirty exactly, and Draco honestly worried that his jaw might drop to the floor. Luckily it didn’t, nor did anything equally embarrassing happen. Harry always looked gorgeous, but today he looked as if he’d gone to a lot of extra trouble.
planning to have our baby sleeping in a big bed, with a comfy mattress beneath them, enjoying pleasant dreams.”
And here's Luna, wearing three flowy skirts layered over each other, skipping through the grounds of the house where she was held prisoner. It's all so bizarre.
"I got a bit shirty about why he was making it. I mean, I'm not crazy right? He's like, trying not to be racist but in a way that's still a little bit racist."
The wisps of purple gathered together in a small pulsing swirl, just like before, and Draco looked down, giving himself permission to be interested in what he was seeing. Hayes dictated a couple of words, and her Quick-Quotes Quill wrote them into Draco’s notes.
Neville nods tersely and then the fight seems to drain out of him and he lets his arms fall to his sides. "Can I help you find anything?" he asks Harry dully.
" Harry says morosely. "He's named his dog Lord Yipslington." And then Harry is off, telling them about the bloody peacocks and the weird empty Manor and how Malfoy yelled at him about not eating breakfast, "And! He had a fit because I asked him if house-elves do the washing up!"
As soon as it had finished speaking, the stag faded out of existence. Draco sank back into his settee, watching as the last of the sparkles disappeared. Hearing Harry speak those words felt significant. It felt like a privilege rarer than rubies that he’d been the one to give Harry a family and give him the fulfilment of his dreams.
"And how do I own up to it?" Malfoy asks, sarcasm as sharp as the knife he's using to chop the parsley.
Draco made a noise of disagreement. He’d fancied getting his nose bloodied by Lewandowski last season and hoped he’d still get the chance when he got back on his broomstick. “What about St Clare?” Draco asked, albeit half-heartedly. “He looked pretty sharpish on his Nimbus after I got grounded at the end of last season. Grabbed our winner right out of Lewandowski’s fingertips.”
"Merlin help us," Malfoy says, resting his arms on Harry's shoulders and looking pretty pleased himself.
“It seemed appropriate,” Harry had said with a smile. “The pair of us are both Seekers. They’ll be a natural on a broom.”
Draco had to pull back when Harry found their way beneath his shirt. He felt the same way as he’d done only a week before, except he was bigger now and even had a couple of stretch marks to show for it.
Harry was wearing the same jeans and purple Weasley jumper combo that he’d worn for Sunday lunch only the day before, so it was likely that he’d Apparated straight over there after dropping Draco back at Half-Moon Place. Harry, it seemed, had decided that he wanted to know the whole of magical Britain to know how ecstatic he was about their baby.
his pyjama bottoms, and dressing gown, and pulled them on as furtively, like the Slytherin he’d been born to be. He’d make Harry some breakfast, he decided. Some bacon and eggs. Merlin, but he wasn’t a cook – he hadn’t even realised the Manor had a kitchen until he was seven – but he could manage a relatively decent fry-up.
Three hours later, Harry also learns he knows very little about cabbage. And that there are in fact some cabbages in the world with a "beguiling sweetness" on offer. Harry would have kept this revelation to himself and saved himself the displeasure of Draco Malfoy's smug face, but the farmer had looked so pleased to show them around the land, so proud to tear a bit of leaf off a pale green cabbage and offer it to him, that Harry couldn't pretend it didn't taste miles better than anything Harry's ever gotten from the Tesco. Not that he's been buying many cabbages, mostly because prior to the Great Cabbage Awakening courtesy of Malfoy and Italy, when Harry previously thought of cabbage he thought of a tasteless pile of mush and
The saleswizard sidled back up to them then, and Harry signed his name with a flourish, arranging for the crib, and the rest of the clothes and toys he’d picked up to be delivered to Grimmauld Place. Draco made a small noise of annoyance, and had the very childish thought of sticking his tongue out at the other wizard. If Harry wanted to spend every Sickle in his vault, then that was up to him, and he watched as the other wizard handed over a bag of gold without a secind glance.
Harry seemed quietly nervous as he took Draco on the grand tour of Grimmauld Place, though he was clearly enthusiastic about the home that he’d inherited from his Godfather.
Molly only scoffed. “We had no such thing,” she dismissed airily, observing the two of them in the way only a matriarch could get away with. “I don’t hold with these modern ideas that you’ve been spouting, Harry! Co-parenting? That baby needs both of his fathers. They’re not a cake to be divided up and doled out.” Molly pursed her lips. “But, of course, young people think you invented parenting! You both know best, I’m sure.” She shook her head, and made a visible effort to arrange her features acceptably. “Ignore me,” she said. “I have old-fashioned notions! Tell me Draco: Harry says that you’re almost halfway through?”
showed it was nearly four o’clock. Bloody Potter hadn’t roused him, and he’d dreamt the afternoon away.
"And then sometimes I feel bad. Like, he's trying so hard, he's being so nice, why isn't it enough? Maybe I'm not trying hard enough to be forgiving."
Draco wasn’t prepared for Harry’s words. The last time there’d been any of those kinds of shenanigans had been almost exactly twenty weeks before, and there had been most of a bottle of Firewhisky involved. Since then, they’d been awkward acquaintances, co-fathers, and even friends, but in all that time, flirtation had been taboo.
Malfoy sits speechless for a moment, a true rarity, opening and closing his mouth several times before he gives a little cough. "Yes, well."
Half-Moon Place meant that Draco could have a little freak-out, all on his own terms, and try to decide what he was going to tell the specialist at St Mungo’s. Deciding whether or not to have the baby was, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the hardest decision that Draco had ever had to make in his life.
Harry was still dozing beside him, all mussed up bed-hair and lips that were smushed into Draco’s green silk pillow. Draco smiled at the sight of him, a daft swoop of attraction making his belly flip over.
Flicking back to the front cover, Draco read the article again. Merlin, but it couldn’t really be clearer.
Malfoy stands quietly underneath the gazebo watching the commotion and fidgeting. He keeps fussing with all the place settings, moving the teapot here and then there and then here again, and Harry thinks Malfoy's annoyed with the way Harry set the table, not up to his exacting standards, and then he realizes Malfoy's
Harry takes a few bites; the persimmon preserves are cloyingly sweet. "Think I like the apples better."
Draco gets the coffee started, using the French press he convinced Harry he needs for entertaining, and gets down the tea as well, for Harry. Harry seemed to like the chai tea Draco ordered for him, a gesture which did not result in a fight about Harry's heritage. He's not sure what the difference is, between giving Harry chai and making him dal makhani, possibly Harry has just given up on Draco in that regard. Or possibly Draco got something right. Or possibly Harry is just a sucker for spiced teas.
. The booze went straight to my head. You were in a bad spot after losing to the Harpies, and I took advantage.”
Draco watched as Harry chopped leeks and crushed a bulb of garlic. Harry had told him a little about his childhood, how the Muggles who had raised him had used him as very little more than a serf, and how he’d taken to cooking as a way to reclaim the skill for himself.
Draco nodded, pleased both that the Mediwitch had taken his worries seriously, and that his tiredness wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. He was floating on cloud nine from the
which, Draco hoped very much, his mum would want to see. The door was answered by Adrianne, and she ushered her Master Draco in with a very low bow, though Draco had told her, many times, that it simply wasn’t necessary.
"I'm sorry, are you telling me that last night, when you went home for pajamas and a toothbrush, you also thought to yourself, you know what I'll need? A tiny vase."
Draco sent his best Malfoy-scowl flying in Harry’s direction. He’d been studiously avoiding thinking about both those two issues, and to have them both brought up in one sentence felt grim.
“Everything looks great,” Hayes answered, making the purple glow brighter with a swirl of her wand. “Truly great. Your magical signature, and that of the other father must be very similar indeed,” she continued. “The foetus is the perfect size and their heartbeat is strong. Your combined magic has created a protective shield around them – a womb, if you will – that’s very well formed. I don't often see such promising pregnancies, Draco. The pair of you must both be very powerful wizards.”
. Why should I be upset that you would think I would still enslave an elf here, after everything that happened? Why on earth would it bother me that you'd still think me callous enough to keep an elf in a dirty pillowcase? I'm just a spoiled brat, right, Potter?"
Malfoy’s hair is short, much shorter than it was during their Hogwarts days, cropped close on the sides, and falling loose onto his forehead. He’s wearing a thick navy coat with dainty silver buttons and embroidered cuffs. He hangs it neatly on the coat hook in the corner and, Harry’s eyebrows rise at the sight of Draco Malfoy in
He wanted Harry so badly. Gods, but he wanted to take the bond too. He wanted lazy Sundays with the Weasleys, and cosy nights watching the television. Draco wanted Harry’s tuneless singing voice, and his awful Muggle music, and the kind generosity that radiated from his person.
Draco looked down at his plate. He had rather slathered the condiment all over his food. Draco hadn’t been able to resist. The little one had been craving spicy foods, and Draco couldn’t help but oblige them. He supposed this was as good a way to share his news as any.
Harry had pressed his hands into the side of Draco’s belly, and he’d sung the words “little darling” to their baby.
"That's not what I said! I just wondered if your family made Indian recipes. That's not a completely illogical association to make."
Other Harry’s hands shake in front of him and he runs his right one through his hair. “Okay, that’s good,” Other Harry says to himself, and turns to the page on the counter again, picking it up and bringing it closer to the hob where he resumes his cooking.
When Draco stirred himself out of his slumber, the shadows patterning the ceiling had shifted, and the room was tinged a different shade than it had been before. A quick
Pans and he didn’t see each other as regularly now as they had as children, but theirs was the sort of relationship where the passage of time didn’t matter. Being the consummate Slytherin, Draco decided to break the news by Firecall.
Malfoy stands up from the table and Harry thinks he'll storm off but he goes to the counter top where he gets a mixing bowl and the flour and starts angrily measuring cups of flour. Harry wishes they could go back to the part of the morning when Malfoy's soft sweater was underneath his palms.
"You mean all this time you've been going on about not feeling guilty and refusing to suffer and jumping down my throat about it and actually you've felt like a piece of shit the entire time?"
“Why not?” Draco said, eventually nodding his agreement to the plan. “It’s a date. Mark your diary, Potter. A Malfoy is going to step over the threshold of the Weasley household and break bread with them. A momentous occasion. One for the history books.”
and he can't very well ask him to wait on the pavement because technically it's Harry's actual job to watch him.
"I didn't know," Harry says. He didn't know Hermione also thought about not being magical enough or Black enough or any of it. In his mind, Hermione is so clearly more than enough in every way.
At some point they move the discussion to the living room. Hermione has poured them both glasses of wine and her and Malfoy's scheming gets grander. Harry tidies up the kitchen and makes himself a cup of tea and goes to join Malfoy on the couch. As Harry sits down Malfoy puts one arm around his waist. Like holding him close is natural and easy.
He’d been too busy being sick, feeling bitter about Louis St Clare, and making life-altering decisions to actually sit back and feel happy about his choice. Even so, there was a tiny person growing inside of him – a brand new life – and that, he supposed, was pretty exciting.
Harry wanted to be at his side. He wanted to be the other father, raising their baby together. They mightn’t ever be a couple, but Draco thought he could get used to that, given time. Having Harry in their lives was everything. “I’ve got another appointment with Mediwitch Hayes in a fortnight,” Draco found himself saying. “You said you wanted to tag along?”
“Not particularly,” Harry answered. “I spent most of them eating Ron’s Every-Flavour beans and worrying about murderous despots.” He reached over and picked up a pair of scratch-mitts. “And yes, Molly Weasley has been on at me, making guesses, and asking me whether I want to find out. Apparently, a March moon is very auspicious for conceiving a daughter.”
Harry was correct. Café Quendryth was posh. Draco had arrived early, not wanting to be late, red-faced and flustered, but that only meant that he was sat there, twiddling his wand.
Malfoy gently maneuvers them so Harry is lying on his back, Malfoy leaning over him sucking soft kisses onto Harry's mouth. Wisps of Malfoy's hair are escaping the half ponytail Malfoy is wearing and Harry blindly reaches up to pull out the hair tie, letting Malfoy's hair fall to tickle his face. It feels so good Harry does actually moan this time and Malfoy pulls back to smile at him.
“Cooking isn’t some mystical skill,” Harry answered, turning his head to the side so that he could look at Draco. “Come here. You have a try.”
"Potter, put that pan down. It looks like it went through the war. Where did you even get that pan? It looks like it's been cursed to burn your food. It looks like one of the Horcruxes you destroyed."
They're in the kitchen, like always. The rest of the Manor isn't barren and echoey like before, the fancy little end tables Harry expected are back in the hallways sporting flower arrangements Malfoy must have owled in every few days. But still they sit in the kitchen.
"Actually Gin probably knew before I did. I had a lot going on, you know, with Voldemort trying to kill me for most of my adolescence. Hermione says it's not uncommon to figure it out late."
Harry rolls his eyes. Of course Malfoy would be high maintenance while sick. Harry leaves Malfoy in bed and goes down the three staircases and several corridors to get some tea sorted. When he brings it back up to Malfoy he finds him asleep again.
. Fuck, but he missed Harry. Draco missed his tuneless voice, and his artless, warm sincerity. Silence was overrated. Silence could be dashed to hell.
It’s not until Draco switches them around so he’s on top, kicking the duvet onto the floor as he does, that Harry is way too uncomfortable not to move from his half bent position. Carefully, (not that the couple on the bed would notice, the way they’re engrossed in each other) Harry slides the Cloak down until the edge touches the floor, and places his feet right behind the curtain of sparkling fabric.
Harry wanders to the nearest aisle of fabric. Every section is neatly labeled and Harry appears to be in the P's—Ponies, Poppies, Potter… Harry silently prays it's ceramicist themed and pulls out a bolt of fabric. It's printed with a pattern of glasses and lightning bolts. Harry groans and suddenly there's Malfoy, standing at his shoulder, laughing at him.
Draco allowed himself to be led, and he let Harry bustle and fuss around him, bringing him his shoes, wand, and the bag where he stored his notes while he waited by the fireplace. Harry looked a little bit flustered – his cheeks were red – and Draco felt the same way. He puffed out a few deep breaths, making a conscious effort to relax. He tried to convince himself that the bubbly, happy feeling and his elevated mood were due to the baby, and their imminent appointment, and absolutely not due to Harry Potter.
Just when Harry is thinking there's no way this cheerful little kitchen has anything to do with Malfoy, the coziness is likely down to the house-elves, Malfoy starts gathering things from around the kitchen, taking down pans and utensils with easy familiarity, as if he does this all the time.
Hayes walked Harry and Draco out into the hallway and bade them goodbye. The two of them were quiet, lost in their own thoughts as they made their way to the elevators and down to the ground floor Apothecary.
Harry is perfectly aware Malfoy has distracted him from their already overdue conversation about the war and their interactions at Hogwarts, but he's also very aware of how it feels when Malfoy kisses him, which is tingly and soft and a bit like cold butter in a hot pan. He can't decide which avenue to pursue.
Malfoys looks down at his hands submerged in soapy water and then back up at Harry like Harry couldn't be stupider. So Harry clarifies, "Not a house-elf?"
“Not at all,” Harry whispered. “Love’s young dream is stronger than ever. ’Mione does Sunday shifts over at the Wizengamot law offices. If the Aurors bring someone in overnight, she’s there to advise them, make sure that they’re given fair treatment. She’s been volunteering since she began working at the Ministry.” Draco could only smile at that. Even at school, Hemione had been a crusader, and the fact that she spent her spare time looking after the recently arrested didn’t surprise him one little bit. “She’ll be along later though,” Harry finished. “Molly always saves her a plate under Stasis.”
So he got out of bed and separated egg yolks and whites and melted butter and mixed warm milk together with yeast and honey and added flour, cup by cup until he had a rich yellow dough gently rising on the counter.
Greg seemed satisfied by his answer. With a tap of his wand, he rewarmed his coffee and took a sip. The scent of it hit Draco’s nostrils, and he felt his belly flip over. Greg saw the look of distaste cross his face, and hurriedly vanished the offensive liquid.
"Oh no, no. I'm not doing all this work and not getting a spot of lunch out of the deal. You owe me."
this summer,” Greg said then, his tone intolerably gentle. “I mean, I didn’t buy it; the rag is loathsome. But Mil’s father? He had it delivered. Likes to check his stocks and shares. So yeah, when he left it in the Summer Pavilion, I picked it up. I read all about you and Harry, shopping on Diagon Alley, and I read Harry telling the world how much he cared about you. Fuck, Draco, I’m as straight as Snape’s fucking wand, but, matey- Even
. Always Pure. That’s all the old families were brought up to think about, Harry. Those are the values Lucius tried to instil in me. You don’t have children because you actually want them, Harry. First and foremost, they’re your heirs, born to strengthen your pure, unsullied family line.
Malfoy sighs. "You want things to be fair and they're not. It's not fair they were tortured during the war, and it's not fair that I was attacked, but fair isn't real. It's Gryffindor nonsense."
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of that, but it’d been too long a day to worry about her implications. All he wanted was to put his feet up, get a cup of tea, and then nap. Baby Malfoy-Potter was stealing all of his get-up-and-go. “I’ll be in touch with the office,” he responded, masking a yawn. “Thank you once more. Harry, shall we Floo home?”
Ron helps Harry clean up the kitchen. He seems completely unbothered by Hermione and Malfoy's arguing, even smiling softly as the volume rises.
Three days later, Elianna arrived once again. This time the little bird had a tiny box attached to her leg. Draco half-wondered whether to send the creature back to Grimmauld Place, gift still attached, but then he decided not to be so petty. Elianna dived onto the table, looking for treats, already familiar with the kitchen of Half-Moon Place.
"It's fascinating," Hermione starts, explaining to Harry and Ron the intricacies of a Sanskrit-based magical language until Harry forgets about Malfoy.
In only six months, they’d be born, a unique witch or wizard that was a mixture of Harry and he both, and yet entirely their own person still. The thought of it was astonishing.
"There is, but it's underwater and you need a strong Bubble-Head Charm and six months notice. I've never been because my father objected to the establishment being owned by merpeople."
. He vehemently cursed past-Draco, wondering why the idiot hadn’t brought a dozen boxes of condoms, and not relied on one that was older than Stone-
“Bloody hell, Harry,” Ron said from across the table. “It never gets any easier for you, does it? ’Mione, come here, sit down and give the man some breathing space. Malfoy, you okay? You’ve gone as white as parchment.”
"Yes. All-righting. It doesn't fix anything. You feel guilty about letting me get cursed, don't you?"
Later that evening, with several shots of Firewhisky sitting warm in his belly, Draco felt his run of bad luck begin to unravel.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at that. “My Mother said something similar,” he said, turning slightly to his left so that the witch could measure his hips. “I’m very excited to meet them. Me and the other father are both enraptured.”
It was only as Mediwitch Hayes left for a second time that Draco dared to finally look up at Harry. The other wizard’s face was open, raw with vulnerable emotion. Profound, protective magic surged through his fingertips, and it didn’t seem at all out of place or awkward when Harry closed the space between them, leaning down to press his lips softly against Draco’s.
Hermione gives Harry a look he can't decipher and says "Maybe you should ask yourself what Malfoy would have to do to be forgiven."
“I can be the best,” Harry answered, not missing a beat. Then he moved in, kissing Draco’s cheek, all heat, and stubble, and then Draco’s jaw and the corner of his mouth. Harry took his time, and Draco could barely credit that such an archetypal Gryffindor could be so patient. Draco hadn’t ever been kissed with such devotion before, and by the time Harry reached his lips, Draco was a half-melted, hormonal mess. The kiss wasn’t deep or especially long, but the sensuality of it left Draco weak. “I can do that,” Harry said, “for you.”
favourites: details of Lucius’s conviction, gossip about their tempestuous relationship at Hogwarts, and a painful repeat of the facts of Harry’s Quidditch accident.
The sun is setting before Malfoy stirs, complaining that his mouth tastes gross. Harry kisses him and confirms it is in fact gross and Malfoy feebly hits Harry on the shoulder.
Harry doesn’t reply. Because — well, what would he say to that? For all he knows, he got hit with a weird curse and is actually lying in St. Mungo’s stuck in a bizarre dream. Other Harry is probably not talking to him and this just happens to be an insane coincidence. Harry doesn’t reply, but after a few minutes of watching Other Harry stir the onions in the pan, he sits.
“There wasn’t anything to tell,” Draco answered, amazed that Pans could bring the most significant news of his life back around to herself. Still, that was Pansy Parkinson. Humility hadn’t ever been her forte. “I didn’t tell anybody. The sex… well, it was Potter. The original glittering Gryffindor. It was every bit as good as you’d expect… It's just that came after it wasn’t quite as hot. Harry made it pretty clear that it’d been a mistake. There’ll not be a bonding ceremony, Pans. We’re not even in a relationship.”
Draco felt annoyance flood through his belly. Bloody Goyle! For a small sliver of a second, he’d actually felt positive about the baby, but now the prat had decided to pull him right back into reality.
Even the nothing, in-between times had been lovely, where they’d been sat, reading and watching telly, and Harry would absentmindedly rest his hand on Draco’s tummy. Draco’s face burned with embarrassment, and suddenly the day was too bright, and he was too hot. His armpits were sweaty, and it was as if all the air had been sucked from the room.
“Let me hear you,” Harry demanded, voice urgent, and so Draco let himself be noisy. He made a sound that was too loud, too eager, and he felt himself blush all over.
Other Harry leaves the house shortly after Draco, and Harry rushes into the bathroom for a shower (and if he indulges in a ridiculously short wank, he can’t bring himself up to feel much guilt after his earlier actions) and down to the kitchen to eat.
Harry leaving was the last thing that Draco wanted, and he leant back in the pillows, counted to ten, and willed his heart rate to get back to normal. Mediwitch Hayes would be back any moment, and if he was agitated, she’d only ask a dozen questions and worry about his blood pressure.
Then, as if summoned by Harry's complaint, Malfoy appears on the gravel path, trailed by a veritable menagerie of three, no four, albino peacocks, two enormous cats, and a pint sized yapping ball of fluff Harry assumes is at least part dog, racing circles around the whole motley crew.
“Some small part of me has always loved him,” Draco admitted, hearing the tremble in his voice, “even when I was at school. But back then, everything felt tied up with hatred and jealousy. I didn’t understand why Harry featured so often in my thoughts.” He pushed a droplet of tea across the wood, watching it darken, marshalling his thoughts. “I suppose I’ve known since he began to come around to Half-Moon Place, bringing me croissants and promising to look after me and the baby.”
When Harry wakes up again the sun is high up in the sky. The wristwatch — which Harry recognises as The Prewett watch he still wears — on the bedside table tells him it’s nearly three o’clock. He’s slept nearly eight hours and lost most of his free time to explore. He’s tempted by a shower, but he can go without. He strips down, lays his clothes flat on the lovely patterned rug and casts laundry charms on each item until they smell clean and look properly ironed. He throws a Scourgify on himself, which he really, really hates resorting to but he doesn’t cringe or recoil at it anymore after too many stakeouts, not to mention his War days.
… All of it. Even collecting your blasted potion form Frobisher’s.” Harry picked up Draco’s bag from Wizkids’s, swung it over his shoulder, and offered Draco his hand. They said their goodbyes to the owner, and the two of them made their way to the door, stepping back out into the humid heat of wizarding London in the afternoon. “And Sunday will be fine, I promise. The Weasleys can be pretty full-on, but they’re good people.”
“Harry informs me that you’ve got a sweet tooth,” Arthur said, rummaging in the pantry. With a flourish, he emerged victorious with a large packet of shortbread. “Which is good, because so do I. Molly wouldn’t be too chuffed if she knew about me eating these,” he joked with a raise of his eyebrows, adding several to a plate, “she worries too much about my old heart. Still, just the once can’t hurt.”
The scones are delicious, still warm from the oven and with bits of crispy frangipane oozing out from the layers. Harry licks the crumbs off his fingers, humming with delight. When Malfoy finishes his scone he puts one arm around Harry and Harry lays his head on Malfoy's shoulder. Malfoy drinks his coffee slowly and eats strawberry slices with his fingers while Harry looks out the floor to ceiling windows.
“That’s not how it looks to me,” Greg continued, oblivious to how lacerating each of his words were. “There’s been lots of words written about how poor little orphan Harry is finally getting a family. A good deal less has been said about you.”
for myself, so that we’ve got precise records of what we’re dealing with, but before I go ahead, I’d like to ask if you’ve considered your options?”
Feasibly, Mediwitch Hayes was used to tears, and unashamed scenes of emotion because she didn’t seem at all daunted by the sight of weeping wizards in her examination room. She handed Draco a tissue, before flicking her wand in a circular motion.
Looking at the label, Draco realised that Harry had brought it from Frobisher’s, one of the old wizarding places near Diagon. That also meant it’d been made specially to order. It wouldn’t have come cheap either.
for lack of a better word. Harry would be lying if he didn’t admit how much he likes watching them together. Harry isn’t like that. He has never been like that. Draco Malfoy makes Other Harry soft.
Harry wasn’t fazed by Draco’s question. “Because this is the biggest, brightest room in Grimmauld Place,” Harry answered, “and when I said I wanted you to have the best I wasn’t kidding. I can sleep in Sirius’s room. It’s only across the hallway, so if you needed me, you’d only have to shout.”
Harry sits down at a cast iron table that looks like it's been dragged in from the garden. As he does, Yip seems to feel his business is also done and curls into a small puff of hair in a tiny bed beneath the table, Lord Yipslington embroidered on it in gold thread.
It was really happening. Draco shook Mediwitch Hayes’s hand, and she told him to arrange a further appointment in a month’s time. Draco left her office feeling hopeful. In four months, training would begin once again for the 2004-2005 season, but he wouldn’t be getting on his broomstick.
Goyle was slouched across the hotel bed when Draco emerged from the bathroom. The Puddlemere Beater looked up as soon as he saw Draco, throwing the copy of
Ms. Quincy takes out a fresh piece of parchment and a quill and begins to ask him a million questions about dimensions and thread color and fabric swatches and after the first few shoulder shrugs Malfoy takes over and answers them confidently.
Ending his pregnancy meant that he wouldn’t have to tell his mum either. Narcissa Malfoy wouldn't ever say a word of criticism aloud, but Draco knew there'd be a secret place inside her that was devastated to know he was considering ending the pregnancy.
“Because I found I did care,” the stag countered, speaking with Harry’s voice. “And when I read that article, I realised that I needed to defend you… That I needed to defend
This is not exactly how Harry would have wanted to tell Neville he's dating their childhood bully. Harry runs a hand through his hair nervously, which releases another cloud of glitter and says, "Er, hi Neville."
“Honestly, I had my doubts, but this is an amazing place,” Harry said, looking out across the sands. “Whitsand Bay. It’s a long way from London.”
“I like it, so I’m going to buy it,” Harry said smugly. “It’s not my fault that you seem reluctant to buy a single thing, Draco. Are you planning for baby Malfoy-Potter to sleep in a drawer? Is that a pure-blood thing?
Mummy had surprised him once more and hadn’t even been the slightest bit surprised that Harry and he were going to move in together. The witch had only smiled serenely at the news, and said that she hoped to be asked to dine before the next full moon. “I expected nothing less,” she’d said to Draco over lunch in Café Quendryth. “Remember what I said back at the Manor? You’re a striking, clever man, and the other parent to his daughter. Your bonding ceremony is most assuredly on the horizon.”
"Because I'm on probation and thus allowed a list of ten first-year level spells that does not include warming or cooling charms."
Somehow, Harry’s simple presence was enough to calm Draco’s anxieties; he expected it was his baby’s magic, recognising that of their other dad and responding to it. Harry had taken to laying his hand on Draco’s forearm whenever they sat together, and Draco could feel the love the other wizard held for their unborn child permeate his skin. He could feel Harry’s protectiveness and his fears, but Draco could also feel his care and his anticipation. It was a heady concoction, and Draco had been guilty of taking Harry’s hand more than once, and guiding it to his unclothed skin. “It helps me relax,” Draco would murmur, though Harry hadn’t offered any criticism of his behaviour.
The cake is the most chocolate chocolate cake Harry's ever had the pleasure of tasting. He moans without meaning to.
"Do you know how many times Crabbe and Goyle tripped me? Or Malfoy jinxed me? They'd take my school books and trash them, threaten to kill Trevor, they said nasty things to me about my parents… Harry, I thought you of all people would understand."
He wanted Harry to know that his feelings were reciprocated. They’d made love, but somehow it was this humble touch that felt like the most intimate moment that Harry and he had ever shared. Draco was just about to say something to that effect, but then Mediwitch Hayes bustled back into the examining room, and their magic moment was lost.
Harry might have to confront the idea that Malfoy has been kind since Harry got here. That all the porridge and soup and biscuits and scones he gives to Harry aren't just obligatory meals because they're stuck together, but generous gestures. Malfoy might even enjoy these gestures. He might enjoy… caring. For Harry.
Surprisingly, Malfoy is awake when Harry gets back, he's swallowing several potions of various colors ranging from puce to mustard and making a truly absurd amount of gagging noises accompanied by declarations like, "Oh I'd rather die, just let me go peacefully," before taking another gulp and pulling a cartoonish face at the poor Trainee Healer whose face says she doesn't get paid enough to deal with this level of dramatic performance.
Harry waves his hand at the living room, where Hermione is punctuating her words with sharp taps of her quill on the coffee table.
“See,” Harry said, his breath ghosting over Draco’s neck. “Nothing to it. A bit like a potions lesson, but rather less deadly when you get it wrong. I think it’s about ready for serving, don’t you? Smells scrumptious. Good enough to eat.”
“It was ten weeks ago,” he said huffily. “But I didn't know for seven of them. I had to see Mediwix Braithwaite, and then wait to see the Mediwitch for my booking appointment at St Mungo’s. Then I decided to put off telling you until the end of the season. I know it’s always mental in the under-21’s camp, those last few days, and- "
Malfoy surprisingly doesn't end up buying any of the cookbooks, and they make their way to the Apothecary where Harry learns Malfoy brews his own anti-aging skin potion.
After that, Harry moved upwards and began to kiss Draco again. There was an urgency to his lips now, a friction, and Draco felt a hot coil of desire begin to unfold inside of him; felt their magic tangling and twisting and pressing close against his skin.
“And then, just when things were starting to get better, and against every odd in the sodding world, you’d become my friend, I fell off my broomstick! I felt like I’d been fucking cursed, Draco. Felt like the life that I’d clung to with the very edges of my fingertips was slipping away from me! You were in the
Harry goes back to Malfoy Manor on Monday morning armed with a gentle repelling spell. He's not sure if he should expect Malfoy to offer him breakfast again. He had dithered in the kitchen for several minutes this morning wondering if he should make himself some toast or if Malfoy would yell at him if he showed up with a spoiled appetite. In the end he dithered for so long he ran out of time.
Draco nodded. “I've had to take a couple of afternoon naps,” he admitted ruefully, “but this one here has been looking out for me. Brought me a tonic made from Wiggentree leaves that perked me right up.” He risked a mischievous smirk in Harry’s direction. “Harry here is quite the Mother Hippogriff. He doesn’t let me do a thing for myself. He’s always rushing to get me another tea or
"You don't have to worry," Harry says, climbing into the bed with Malfoy and spooning him from behind.
Draco felt a wave of affection for his lovely mummy. At first, she’d hated his professional Quidditch career, and the risks involved with flying professionally, but she’d never stood in the way of his living his life in the way he saw fit. That she listened to Puddlemere’s games on the wireless – and passed judgment upon them – felt like unspoken approval.
. Draco felt a funny, uncomfortable twist inside his chest. Lucius, locked in Azkaban, wouldn’t ever get to know his baby beyond seeing their picture. Draco missed Lucius. Not the wizard who’d betrayed his mother and he, but the man he’d been before; the father that’d shown him how to shave and had taught him his very first spell. Draco swallowed the lump in his throat. He needed Harry to take him seriously. The last thing he needed was Harry finding him in tears.
“Maybe they were brought on by that,” Harry replied, “or maybe it was a coincidence. It doesn’t matter. All that matters is that you’re alright – that both of you are alright, Draco – and that you called me. That wasn’t stupid of you. That was really clever. Many wizards mistake Braxton-hicks for the real thing. They’re more powerful for males, apparently... Something to do with the extra magic your body is using, even when you’re asleep.”
Harry wakes up to Petrol pawing at his leg, which he realises is very much uncovered by the Invisibility Cloak. He barely has time to cover himself back up before Malfoy’s wand alarm goes off with the sound of twinkling bells that grates on his ears. His neck is stiff and his body is sore and Harry needs to find a way to go back home.
, and it was plain from Harry’s face that his co-parent was every bit as overjoyed as he was. He took the proffered prescription. There was an Apothecary in the hospital; he’d ask Harry if they could make a diversion there before they left. “I’ll start this evening,” he promised his Mediwitch, tucking the parchment into his bag.
"I'm making a kind of calzone. Really more of a stuffed bread as we're not using actual pizza dough."
Draco was quiet for a moment, taking in everything that Harry had said. Despite his contempt for that appalling book, there was definitely something to what Harry was saying. Draco felt his cheeks pinken. He was actually rather impressed with Harry’s handle on the situation. “I’m not sure there’s much to be proud of today,” Draco said, marginally less grouchily. “I don’t have any clothes that fit me. I’ll be attending our hospital appointment half-starkers.”
Malfoy is leaning back on his pillow, eyes closed but holding his hand out to Harry. Harry shifts to sit on the bed and takes his hand.
The two of them chatted for a further hour or so, and Greg told Draco that the two witches had decided, conclusively, that Draco was having a daughter.
“Cool your cauldrons,” Draco answered, rewarming his tea with a click of his wand. He pushed the shortbread in Harry’s direction. “Here, eat,” he instructed, taking another one for himself. “I got downstairs without the slightest problem. I haven’t been up long, actually, and while you were playing your hotly contended game, I had a very pleasant conversation with Mr Weas-with Arthur.” He bit down in the biscuit, chewing and swallowing before continuing. “As for the
It's so quiet, just the soft sound of their lips meeting, the slide of a hand over fabric. Harry presses himself closer to Malfoy, wanting to feel every inch of his chest and Malfoy adjusts, pulling Harry onto his side and hiking one leg up over Harry. Harry is half hard but not ready to do anything about it besides sliding his hand down Malfoy's long skinny thigh.
Draco’s breath hitched. His heart was beating everywhere, all over his body. “Give us a chance,” Harry repeated, and then he leant in, bringing their lips together. It was chaste, a barely-there touch, but shockwaves ran though Draco.
Malfoy turns to look at Harry with an expression like he's going to say no, then his eyes sweep the kitchen, the several bowls and books, the butter and flour and cranberries and cucumbers and jars waiting on the counter. "I—yes. Slice the crusts off the bread?"
He’d felt a bit lonely recently; a bit restless and fidgety. Harry – wizard pregnancy expert extraordinaire – had told him that everything he was experiencing was to be expected and was very usual. Apparently, his body was chock-full of hormones, and they were on a rampage, infusing his emotional reasons to even the most trivial of things with vast intensity.
“You’re in love with Harry,” he said, matter-of-factly, his words a statement rather than a question. “How long have you known?”
"You don't deserve to feel awful. And not just because you're righteous and good, because neither do I and I'm neither of those things. It's punitive and simplistic to demand people suffer for their wrongdoing."
or their half-baked headlines, Draco. I’ll do whatever it takes to raise this baby together.” Harry leant across the table then, and took Draco’s hand in his own. It was warm and rough, and Draco felt the comforting fission of the other wizard’s strong magic. His fingers, clasped by Harry’s own, felt like they were on fire. “I mean, I’m not an entire prat. I’ve come here with my eyes open. I know that it’s not going to be easy, but if you’re… if
Harry, Ron, and Hermione move into their flat the next weekend. Ron curses a lot at the weight of the boxes upon boxes of Hermione's books and Hermione checks each book one by one to make sure it hasn't been dented and Harry realizes he has a trunk full of Hogwarts school supplies and not much else. He needs a bed, and forks and things. Towels. Hangers. Sheets. It's all a bit overwhelming and Harry is grateful he can count on Malfoy for a bowl of porridge, and now a lunch, so that he doesn't have to add grocery shopping to the list as well.
All that existed, there and then, was Harry. Harry’s fingers, wrapped around his shoulder. Harry’s tongue, tickling and teasing his own. There wasn’t a lot of room on Draco’s settee; it was an object of refinement and taste, pinched from the Manor lounge, and wasn’t quite the article for lovemaking.
He settled down in a chair in front of her desk, and the two of them went through a gamut of basic questions: age, vaccinations and medical history. Apart from a couple of old Quidditch injuries Draco was in textbook health, and Mediwitch Hayes seemed pleased with all of his answers.
Sleep wasn’t, and wouldn’t be in the offing until he had taken that sodding test and proved to himself that he absolutely, definitely, completely wasn’t pregnant. Then he’d be able to sleep soundly for the first time in what seemed like weeks, and then, tomorrow, he’d snatch that Snitch from right in front of Lewandowski’s nose.
"You're actually surprisingly like an old lady. You make lots of biscuits and soups and go antiques shopping and read cookbooks and have a little dog."
"And aside from your general lack of knowledge of cooking technique and variety, you have yet to dislike anything I've made despite your frequent disbelief."
No, Draco isn't eleven anymore. He's an adult. An adult who doesn't need to impress anyone, least of all Harry Potter. He's an adult who will make crepes for breakfast because he likes crepes. And if he doesn't scale the recipe down it's because there's only one egg and one cannot split an egg in two. Not because he's making crepes for Harry Potter. He's simply making an abundance of crepes, he thinks, whisking the batter rather vigorously.
Draco arrived to the Manor doors exactly as he usually would, a prompt twenty minutes before lunch, and as always, he collected a large bouquet of fragrant hyacinths.
Harry takes a sip of tea and nods at Malfoy to continue. He doesn't want to ruin this by starting a fight and there's a fifty-fifty chance whatever comes out of either of their mouths will start a fight.
"You know what? I need time to figure this out. I don't even know what I think except that I feel like dragon dung when anyone's mad at me. Except you."
“Ah. Right,” he starts. “Look, you’re gonna fuck up on the Northern Lights trip. In fact, you’re going to fuck up a lot. He really is still Draco Malfoy. You’ll clash and argue and you’ll make up just as fiercely. It’s going to be particularly bad on that trip. He’s been waiting for it all his life. Not much you can do about it. Just fix it, right after. You’ll know how.
Malfoy agrees, yawning on his way to the floo. The fire crackles green and Malfoy disappears from view.
It was only when he placed the tray on his kitchen table that Draco saw Harry, standing in the doorway. His green eyes were trained on the swell of Draco’s middle, now mercifully covered once more.
“Good morning,” Harry said, and Draco felt his heart drop. Harry didn’t sound like himself. Harry sounded stilted; embarrassed even.
"Potter, where's your fruit bowl? Where do you put your fruit? Do you just leave it to roll all over the counter like a barbarian?"
Malfoy smiles sadly. "Always. Couldn't you tell? My father certainly could, he was constantly chastising my 'dramatics'."
The witch was even pleased with his small weight gain, and told him it was exactly where it ought to be. “I’m happy with everything that I’ve seen today,” she said, ending the spell with a
When they've silently breakfasted their fill Malfoy floats all the little pots and bowls to the counter by the sink and Harry gets his second shock of the day when Malfoy rolls up his sleeves and starts in on the dishes.
With Other Harry flat on his front like this and Draco sitting above him, Harry can see Draco in all his glory and his stomach flips with want.
Malfoy still looks very sick. He's always pale but now he practically blends in with the white sheets. His eyes are sunken and rimmed with dark circles. He looks small and pathetic in the hospital bed. Harry feels another pang of guilt that Malfoy was cursed under Harry's watch. It brings up all the other times in his life he's been careless, thoughtless, too late, too little. If only Harry had thought to go to Snape, he might've saved Sirius from falling through the veil. If he'd been quicker he could have saved Cedric, and Hedwig and Dobby… These thoughts spiral around Harry's head, clouding everything while he watches Malfoy sleep, too still. He'll go mad sitting here with nothing to do.
Malfoy gets out an old fashioned sifter with a turn handle and measures flour, buckwheat flour, and cocoa powder into it. Watching him cook is quickly becoming soothing to Harry which is concerning because Harry still feels he ought to be angry with Malfoy.
. It didn’t matter how many times he said it to himself, it still didn’t feel real. He’d felt worn-out before, but now Draco didn’t think that he’d ever get to sleep.
"Yeah, yeah you're right," Harry says. "But my point is, I think I get that. I think maybe I can understand why he was the way he was and how he's changed and sometimes that seems like enough. But then we run into Neville and I think it's not enough. And Hermione's using big words like forgiveness and asking me what would be enough and I just don't know."
And he can. Harry walked alone to his own certain death, he can walk across a busy office to quit his job.
“I’ve actually been feeling better,” Draco answered. “I was sick a few times, right at the start, but that seems to have tapered off a bit. Just need to eat regularly, which won’t be a problem. Some wizard – who’ll remain nameless – brought me every croissant on Diagon Alley.”
So, when Puddlemere lost once more, it didn’t come as a shock to the players, the fans or their coaches. The Harpies, after all, were in their ascendency. Widely considered the finest team in wizarding Britain, they had won all of their Quidditch games, easily as any charm.
Draco thought of his mummy, sitting primly at her dining table when they'd met for lunch. She’d called his and Harry’s lovemaking “sacred, blessed by Merlin,” and he’d thought her language old-fashioned, almost quaint. Perhaps it had been he that was wrong, though. They’d only been together one night, but that had been enough to create a new life; enough to create a family.
Other patients come and go with various ailments, but Harry hardly notices. He's watching the door Malfoy went through and waiting for someone to tell him anything. He feels so stupid, thinking about how he sat next to Malfoy all day without noticing something was wrong. He should have taken him to the hospital this morning. He should have realized.
“You said you didn’t want me,” Draco said, angrily, because Harry shouldn't be allowed to raise his hopes like that. He shouldn’t come around, and be this kind, and treat Draco better than any other man ever had, because he’d made Draco fall in love with him. “You said you didn’t want me, and you said you weren’t ready. You fucked me, and you left me, Harry.”
“Fucking hell,” Harry answered, shaking his head like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Gregory fucking
It's just a house. A stupidly posh mansion of a house, where all the plants along the drive have withered and died, presumably from the evil that soaked into the ground or whatever, but just a house. A house with a dumb wrought iron gate two stories high that won't open.
His features were protective and fierce, and looked like they wouldn’t brook any disagreement. This was the steely face of the Saviour, as determined as he’d been when he was seventeen, facing his destiny and saving the world.
Because while blood does flow south at the eyeful that is a fully naked Draco Malfoy, Harry’s pulse quickens at the soft gazes between the two men in the bath. The way they look at each other, full of affection, hands linking between them.
Harry was very taken with everything, and soon he had a second basket of purchases, also filled to the brim. Draco held off. Usually he enjoyed shopping immensely, but today something was holding him back. He decided it was best not to examine his feelings too deeply.
He had to resist the temptation to snatch it out of the elf’s hands and dig in his spoon. The moment their waiter had Apparated away from their table Draco did so. The two of them ate in silence for a minute, surrounded on all sides by the hum of other people’s conversation and the bell above the door.
"Don't be weird, Potter. It's for if you have a crup or cat. You don't want your blankets to smell like cat dander do you?"
"And you're bringing food? We should eat there," Harry says and regrets it. Eating Italian food alone in Italy with Malfoy sounds too much like a date.
Finally, after cartons were emptied, and Draco felt pleasantly full after eating seconds, it was time to break open the fortune cookies. The whole tradition was a bit silly – Draco and Greg rolled their eyes – but Millicent was a stickler for things she enjoyed.
Harry doesn't know where to start. Being around Malfoy brings up all kinds of complicated stuff Harry doesn't particularly want to think about.
Very slowly, like a consummate Seeker pursuing his Snitch, Harry moved his arm down until it was wrapped around Draco’s shoulders. Draco closed his eyes, relaxed and somnolent. He felt the calloused edge of Harry’s thumb as it quested beneath the sleeves of his tee-shirt, touching his skin.
They Floo to the Leaky Cauldron and duck out the back without incident and Draco tugs Harry over to Flourish and Blotts to look at the cookbook section.
" and Hermione argues that, "It is not essential, not compared to the 1814 Reorganization of the Wizengamot which teaches the same basic themes and—"
"Well," Hermione says slowly. "It's complicated, really. I'm not sure there's an easy way to summarize or essentialize the process because it's quite complex."
"We had a lot of other things going on. The point is, there's no right way to be Black or Indian or magical or anything else. And if you want some books about colonial oppression and Indian Magical History I have quite a few."
But he also wants Neville to get his apology. To get the recognition of all the hurt Malfoy caused him. Can't Malfoy feel badly about the things he's done without… feeling bad?
’. Draco chortled at the sight of it. Harry was right. The babygro certainly was charming, though Draco was loath to admit that aloud. The outfit looked teeny in Harry’s big Seeker’s hands. How could any human be that small? It felt incredibly bizarre not only that they did, but that one would be arriving to live with them in only a few months. “Shall I add it to the pile?” Harry asked. “Have we got enough newborn clothes?”
“That’s alright,” Draco acknowledged. “Shall we agree to empty our cauldrons? Start afresh? You can ask me anything,” he said, picking up a second sandwich. “Though I suspect if you’ve read a book on the subject, you know more about wizard pregnancies than I do.” He locked eyes with Harry and took a big bite of the sandwich.
Privately, Draco thought that the witch would be wasted as a politician. Her nickname of ‘brightest witch of her generation’ was well deserved, and she’d have made a terrific Wizengamot Barrister. Still, Draco supposed that the power to affect real change came from inside of the Ministry.
Malfoy pulls out the bowls and ingredients he'll need, gathering everything together before he starts measuring anything. Harry sits down at the table and tries to pretend he's not watching him.
For the rest of the morning Draco felt like he was walking on air. Circe, but he felt exactly like he’d done as a teenager, getting ready for the Yule Ball – jittery and keyed up; unable to keep still – and he ended up getting changed three times, which was ridiculous, because he wasn’t going dancing or to a five-star restaurant. He was going house hunting, one of the most exhausting and disheartening activities known to man.
Harry cut him off, mid-flow. “Don’t talk bollocks, Draco Malfoy,” he said, his green eyes glinting, dark and annoyed. “You should have
“Potter won’t want to know,” Draco answered sullenly. “He already made that completely clear. He doesn't want anything serious, and it’s not like I need anything from him,” Draco continued, hearing his voice rise sharply. “I won’t be asking him for time, or money. He won’t even have to acknowledge them. I’ll be enough of a father to make up for the deficit.”
A flicker of sadness crossed Mother’s face, just like it always did whenever Lucius was mentioned. “Your father spent too many years concerned with the endorsement of others, Draco. He lost everything he held dear because he believed wanted power. His hubris broke our world into pieces, Draco, and like the pure-blood fool I was, I followed him into the mouth of madness. I give a prayer of thanks, every single day that Merlin allowed you to be saved in the Room of Lost Things, Draco.” Narcissa wiped away a tear. “I nearly lost you once, and won’t lose you, or my granddaughter, over foolish customs that have no place in the modern world.”
Harry can feel tingles breaking out across his skin wherever Malfoy touches him and there's a promising bulge under Harry's bum that's making Harry's heart race with nervous excitement.
Malfoy smiles, and Harry can’t help but feel like it’s an inside joke, like maybe this isn’t an unusual evening for them. In lieu of answering, Draco finally tilts his head up for his lips to meet Other Harry’s in a short kiss.
One wall had been painted with a mural of a meadow, and each blade of grass and leaf swayed lightly in the breeze. There were shelves packed full of the toys that Harry had brought on their visit to Wizkid’s, and a chest of drawers that, Draco assumed, was full with all their clothes.
Draco sniffed. He’d thought he’d been so shrewd, but his mother had read him as effortlessly as a first-year spell. “And you’re not upset?” he asked, cautiously. He watched as his mother picked up her glass and took a small, deliberate sip. She was obviously thinking; working out precisely how to phrase her answer.
Draco snorted. “Don’t tell me that Mother Weasley has been any different, Potter. It’s the chief hobby of any witch of a certain age to guess a baby’s gender and to make predictions. The Muggles didn’t call them wise women without reason, Harry. Did you ever actually listen in your History of Magic lessons?”
Draco wasn’t a foolish wizard. He was sure that they’d been clocked the moment that they’d Flooed to Diagon Alley, and the milky-pink potion that they’d collected from the Apothecary hadn’t helped matters. The witch behind the counter had said, very loudly, that there wasn’t anything better for a wizard ‘in the family way’. Draco supposed that they’d have had their photos taken by now, and that it was pointless trying to cover himself, but he didn’t want to give them any more material than he had to. Harry noticed the paparazzi too and he moved closer, immediately protective and wary.
Draco bit down the urge to tell his friend to piss off. “The pasta,” he answered, knowing his answer sounded weak. “It’s the elves my mother sends over to help me. They need to practice their hygiene spells. I’ve half a mind-”
Harry hates Grimmauld Place. He has always hated it, despite not being able to let it go, this one last connection he has to Sirius. He has never considered he could be happy in this house. If he
Harry looks around the kitchen. There are several mixing bowls out and a few pans on the hob and one pot of water boiling away. There's also no breakfast.
"Should I have invited them into the Manor for cocktails and dancing? Hagrid told me to leave them be."
Harry does shut up and does take a sip, but not because Malfoy told him to. Because Andrea recommended it and Andrea grows the best cabbages in the world. And Andrea is right, it's extremely drinkable, Harry thinks, taking several more sips. Harry also finds out he likes kale. It's like spinach but more. And it goes great with the wine, both of them sort of… minerally.
my name and never seen me again, that I’d do the same to you? Oh, my darling, darling boy. This is why you’ve not been home, isn’t it? You thought I’d reject your child? Reject my own flesh and blood? Draco, she’ll be my light that brightens my life. Surely you think me capable of more than such baseless prejudice?” Pausing, Narcissa dabbed once at the corner of her eyes with a handkerchief. Draco was astonished. Mother never, ever shed tears. “You’ve always been cut from a different cloth to Lucius and I, Draco. Even when you were young it was clear that an arranged bond with a suitable witch wouldn’t be to your liking.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably. He’d never once thought about Harry’s accident in that way. He’d only ever seen the brilliant recovery that he’d made, and how Harry hadn’t ever seemed to let the loss of his competitive career get him down. He’d had no clue whatsoever that the other wizard might have needed Mind Healing, or that the accident had impinged badly on his intimate relationships.
Harry thought soup sounded a little light for all the heavy lifting he's been doing, but Malfoy's made a potato soup and it's topped with thick bits of bacon and kale crisps and a generous dollop of something Malfoy calls creme fraiche, and between the soup with its many salty crunchy delicious toppings and the hearty slice of wheat bread and the return of the chocolate buckwheat biscuits, Harry feels rather too full to get right back to work. He leans back in his chair wondering why he's been sneaking Tesco egg and cress sandwiches the last few weeks. Bill looks similarly satisfied, using his bread to mop up the last of his soup with a pleased hum.
Lush rays of sunshine shone through the windows, and everything felt possible. Harry and he made small talk about the baby – which parent’s looks they might favour, or whether they might inherit Harry’s myopia – and Draco sipped his glass of water, staring at the clock. Somehow, the closer it got to the appointment, the slower the seconds seemed to tick by.
about the night before. Neville's objections and Draco's porridge, Draco breaking Harry's nose in sixth year, and Harry almost killing Draco, the taunts of Mudblood and scarhead and Draco's testimony against Lucius, puzzle pieces with sharp edges that Harry has no idea how to put together. And now kissing.
Goyle took his silence for permission, and soon they were filling a basket full of hair-conditioning potions, bandages and even a family-sized bottle of Skele-Gro. By the time they reached the pregnancy tests, Draco’s mind felt fuzzy and he was shivering inside his coat.
Draco expected the next words out of Harry’s mouth to be a tease about him believing old witch’s stories; perhaps an impression of Trelawny or even a sly suggestion that they read their tea leaves, and discover where Puddlemere would finish next season. Instead, Harry’s fingers brushed over the skin of Draco’s forearm, gentle as feathers, and he spoke his reply with a soft voice. “It is.”
“My darling,” Mother said, giving him a long, appraising look, her grey eyes identical to his own. “You look wonderful. So very handsome. Merlin, but I have missed you! Are you fully recovered from your malady?”
Malfoy is going on about where they could put the bed, and the white quilt he could bring from the Manor that would fit it perfectly, as Other Harry gets up to stir the sauce once more. He walks back to the table then, leaning over Malfoy who still hasn’t stopped talking about colour schemes and matching bedside tables.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco whispered, praying that she’d experienced none of his terror second-hand. “I love you. I’d never leave you, sweetpea.”
Malfoy listens to the Healer, nodding slowly, still blinking blearily and Harry wonders if he's really understanding the news. Like the fact that he was cursed. Cursed while under Harry's protection. Harry puts his head in his hands, the feeling of failure overwhelming him. He let Malfoy get cursed and then he almost let him asphyxiate.
Draco sighed. Maybe he’d give the tonic a try instead of owling it back to Grimmauld Place. Harry was spot-on: he’d felt weary down to his very bones during the last few days. A couple of drops in his cup of tea couldn’t hurt, surely?
Harry gets very absorbed in his kouign amann, catching every flaky bit and licking custard from his fingers.
Leaning in, Harry gave Draco a quick, heated kiss and then drew back slowly. It was intense and Harry kept to a torturously unhurried pace. The wizard thrust into Draco’s body, working him to a frenzy as he gradually built up his pace. Pleasure rose in Draco, steady, slow and deep, and he heard himself make noises, small throaty noises that he couldn’t control.
Getting ready to Floo to Diagon Alley, Malfoy chatters about what he needs to buy and 'why haven't wizards made cashmere robes', and it distracts Harry from feeling nervous. He hasn't been to such a crowded wizarding space since the last of the funerals after the war and he's unsure how much fanfare to expect. Maybe he won't be recognized, or maybe it will be like when he was eleven and Hagrid first brought him to the Leaky Cauldron, lines of people waiting to shake his hand.
It was a kick, light but undeniable. He stilled, and then he frantically ran his hands over the expanse of his tummy, pressing one hand at the top, and the other firmly on the bottom. Keeping as still as he possibly could, Draco held his breath, praying that she’d kick out once again.
Greg grinned at that. “You’ve always been an embellishing git,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Please tell me that this Amortentia-hued piece of madness at least involved some discussion of actual grown-up issues? You know, like that little interloper that’s stretching out your waistline? You need to start from the beginning, Malfoy, and don’t spare the details.”
“Harry. I know what you’re thinking, remember? Let it happen. Your life is no longer controlled by prophecy. Allow yourself happiness. This is all you need to know. And.” He pauses, then, still stirring, and lets out a long breath. “Trust him, okay? I know you don’t want to hear this, but find him, and trust him. Me — you,
“What about Granger?” Draco asked, all of a sudden very curious to know what Harry’s bossy Ministry-rising-star chum had said about their baby. If Ron had been good-natured and accepting, no doubt Hermione must have been the opposite. Likely she’d have given Harry a long, detailed list of why he was too young, immature and otherwise unsuitable to be anyone’s father. Draco could picture the look of surprise that would have beset the pretty witch’s face when Harry had sat them down to share his big news, and how she must have fretted at the mere idea of a Malfoy-Potter baby arriving in the world.
Harry was back at Grimmauld Place, and Draco didn’t want to keep him waiting any longer than he had to. He wanted to go home. It was time for the rest of his and their daughter’s life to begin anew.
Harry looks at his watch. He's been with Malfoy all of ten minutes and already he could use a pint. At this rate he'll need upwards of a hundred to wash away the irritation.
Harry tips his head down to rest his forehead on Malfoy's shoulder and tries not to moan at the petting.
"Ah," Luna says, as if this makes some sense to her. Is Malfoy dabbling in illustration now? "A good day to confront the crayfish of our subconscious fears."
' screamed the headline, with a picture of Cuffe and Harry sitting together in the newspaper’s office.
Harry gives Malfoy a fake saccharine smile. "You said to let it come up naturally. Now come on, tell me why you won't eat French food."
The final, and conclusive black mark against St Mortimer’s Place came when they arrived in the drawing room. It had exactly the same marble flooring that Lucius’s study had when Draco was a boy, and the sight of it turned Draco’s stomach. He’d always had to sit there, perched on the edge of a hard wooden chair, awaiting his punishment for whatever wrongdoing he’d committed that day. Even the blasted fireplace reminded him of the Manor. If he’d have wanted to move back home with Mummy then he’d already have done so.
this morning because that's undeniably the smell of coffee. Harry finds himself smiling. Malfoy is still here.
“Wish me luck,” Draco whispered to his baby, before knocking sharply on the green wood. It was time to fly, or get off the broomstick. Brew the potion, or douse the cauldron. Time to tell Narcissa Black-Malfoy that she was going to be a grandmother to Draco’s illegitimate, part-Potter baby.
Harry realises he doesn’t quite know where to go from here. He could do with a slow day. He can do slow. He can allow himself one more day of finding more about this life Other Harry and Draco share, and tomorrow he’ll find a solution to his problem.
“It already has,” Harry answered, reaching out to lay his hand on the jut of Draco’s belly. “Our magic is already combined in the most momentous way possible! Maybe we’re just running to catch up. Give us a chance, Draco,” Harry urged, looking at Draco with those big, too-honest green eyes of his, and Draco found that he couldn’t look away. Merlin, but Harry Potter couldn’t be good for Draco’s heath. His tummy flipped over and his head felt light. Raising his hand, Harry cupped Draco’s cheek. “Give me a chance to be the man you deserve.”
Greg was right. Draco was setting himself up to be hurt again, hurt badly. Harry, as oblivious and heartbreaking as always, carried on speaking. He didn’t understand that he’d cut Draco far deeper than even the scars of the Sectumsempra spell.
"You make everything into this tit for tat justice exchange. Rest assured Potter, I don't think I deserve to be cursed."
Harry sipped his Butterbeer. “You’ve been missing out, Draco,” Harry said, obviously pleased at the sight of Draco devouring his food. “The wizard who owns it used to be a colleague of Arthur Weasley in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. The two of them got called out to a Muggle restaurant one day – some prat had charmed the knives and forks to stick to people’s fingers! – and the owner realised that they could do a far better job. Fratelli’s was the result, and the Weasleys, dragging me in tow, have been honoured guests here ever since. Ron, ‘Mione and I eat here all the time. The food’s great and no-one gives us any hassle. It’s a win-win.”
Draco would have made a disbelieving reply to Ron’s fortune-telling, except that was the moment that their main courses arrived. Their pastas were abundant, buttery, and unquestionably delicious. Harry and he thanked the waiter, ordered a couple of fresh drinks, and set to work eating. Draco was secretly pleased Harry was eating his pasta every bit as heartily as he was; the green-eyed wizard wasn’t even eating for two.
Draco didn’t have any doubts. Even though it was practically perfect there was something about Whitsand Bay that left him cold. “
In all honesty, Draco hadn’t taken Mummy’s words about having a daughter seriously. He’d imagined that she was teasing him a little bit. Now though, for the first time, he speculated what it might be like having a little girl.
Malfoy goes home in the evening and Harry looks into his cupboards and feels a little lousy about the tinned soup he'd planned for dinner. He feels a little lousy generally, like maybe he should have realized sooner that Malfoy was also victimized by Voldemort.
Harry kissed Draco’s neck whilst they lay there, sweaty and sated, the aftershocks making both of them quiver. Draco turned around, and then Harry kissed him on the lips.
Draco couldn’t abide how kind Goyle sounded, how caring, and so his reply was tetchier than he would have liked. “Fine,” he snapped back. “The potion, I’m alright, just- I need another potion. A different brand.”
Malfoy takes Harry's dish over to the sink and Harry, like he's Lord Yipslington's understudy, follows. He stands behind Malf,y, panicking about how awkward he's being until Malfoy says, "Dry the dishes," and Harry has a task to devote his attention to. He stands next to Malfoy at the sink and dries the dishes very thoroughly, watching Malfoy's forearms as they scrub.
Ron shrugs. "I don't know either. You'd think I'd be angrier, but honestly, I'm sort of tired of it. We survived, you know? I mean, really think about that, we made it out alive. When I think about Fred—" Ron swallows hard and Hermione rests her hand over his. "Fred would go bonkers if we carried on being miserable. He'd want us to be happy."
Harry stands behind Malfoy and winds his arms around his waist, letting his palms lie flat against Malfoy's soft jumper.
"But what about dessert?" Harry asks. To which Malfoy says Harry is getting spoiled. Though if Harry's not mistaken, he says it rather fondly.
He knew he wasn’t likely to forget the date of his appointment, or the location, but he wanted to keep it in sight. The appointment represented something meaningful. Draco supposed it was the first step on his journey.
“I want it,” Harry exclaimed, impetuous and keen. “I can’t abide the idea of them having bad dreams, Draco. That’s the one. I knew it the moment that I saw it.”
"I'd never," Malfoy says, but he whispers the words into Harry's ear before gently biting and then sucking on Harry's earlobe. It might be the best thing Harry's ever felt. His hands tighten on Malfoy's waist.
If someone did come to the Manor to attack Malfoy, Harry seriously wonders how they would get in and back out without getting lost. Harry uses a spell he learned in the Aurors to detect a human presence in the rooms he passes without much  hope—there are probably secret passageways and trapdoors in an old wizarding house like this.
“Where did you end up?” Hermione asks, frantic. “We didn’t know if you’d gone forward or backward, didn’t know what to do. We had to get the Unspeakables on it. God, we were so worried.”
Malfoy seems to cook all the time. It's not just breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's homemade seeded crackers to eat with young—not old—brie for a 'quick snack', or homemade muesli cereal with tart dried cherries and toasted hazelnuts, bathed in cream, or cinnamon walnut scones, or cranberry lemon scones, or cream and oat scones for tea. Or, like right now, an olive oil and grapefruit madeira cake. Harry's never had grapefruit in a cake before but he's suspicious. Malfoy, however, blithely tells Harry he has no idea what he's talking about.
"The secret is you sprinkle each side with a little sugar. That way the exterior chars quickly and the interior doesn't overcook."
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Draco asked, nodding towards the sink. “Housekeeping magic isn’t exactly my forte, but it’s the least I can do, especially as I’ve taken such advantage of your hospitality,” he added, awkwardly, not wanting to acknowledge aloud that he’d spent most of the afternoon asleep.
and how much their little one had changed and grown since their last appointment. “Everything is progressing really well. My Mediwitch was pleased. Our baby looked beautiful.”
It took a matter of moments for pants, socks and every last vestige of clothes to be removed, and while Harry kicked away his jeans, Draco rustled in his bedside drawer for lube and a condom. The lube was easily uncovered, but there was a tiny moment of alarm when a condom couldn’t be seen instantly. He let out a relieved breath when an
“A new magical being born outside of a bond,” Draco answered. “Mummy, I’m not in a relationship with the other father, and I never have been. Can you bring yourself to love my baby anyway? He’s-The other dad is a good, kind person, keen to be part of our child’s life. But not mine.”
Harry's still setting the table when Luna Lovegood lands in the garden on the back of a Thestral. As she touches down, several more Thestrals of all different sizes follow. They stand with their unblinking white eyes, scenting the air and pawing nervously at the ground.
His black tee-shirt, printed with the Sleekeazy hair potion logo, was snug over his muscles, and he appeared to be wearing brand-new jeans. Even Harry’s hair was considerably less of a bird’s nest than it usually appeared.
“Goodness me,” Ron said, “but if it isn’t Draco Lucius Malfoy, up the duff and in the pink, come to dine with the proles.” He stood back and motioned for them both to enter. “Mum’s been cooking up a storm, as per. Smells delicious. She’s charmed the kitchen door so that none of us can sneak in, but I suspect that the red carpet will be rolled out for you two.”
Fidgeting uncomfortably, Draco rearranged his clothes as he had been told to, cringing on the inside as Harry’s gaze trailed over his tummy. This was the first time that Harry had seen him without a shirt since their night together, and Draco imagined that Harry must be contemplating just how very different he looked, only twelve short weeks later.
Other Harry is as tactile as Harry himself. He’s always reaching for Draco’s hand, or running a hand through his hair, linking their legs together when they sit on the sofa. Draco is gentle with Other Harry. Gentle in his words, gentle in his actions. Like the way he’d washed Other Harry’s hair the night before, or how he works around Other Harry in the kitchen. Draco is full of gentle, genuine praise for Other Harry and Harry can feel his own heart swell at the words, even if they’re not for him. Even if it aches knowing no one loves him quite like that.
“Bloody hell,” Harry hissed from the side-lines. “You promised, on your honour, that you wouldn’t say… I’ve
Malfoy's knife moves over the parsley with quick angry chops. "And pray tell, Saint Potter, how does one 'take responsibility' for one's actions?"
The two of them talked for another half hour, and Pansy admitted that she was thrilled to be an aunty. She told Draco that she’d buy his daughter all the chic little girl outfits that she wished she could have brought for Cygnus. “Not you as well,” Draco snorted. “Mother said exactly the same thing, and I told her what I’m telling you: Harry and I don’t know who they are yet. We don't find out gender until twenty weeks in.”
Draco inhaled, and wondered, briefly, what he’d done in a previous life to deserve his current existence. He massaged his temple, trying hard to think of an excuse that’d satisfy his teammate. Nothing came to mind and – truthfully – this was a mission that he didn’t relish completing on his own.
baby – will be here before we know it.” The words were painful for him to say, but now, at least, they were in the open. “I’ve fallen in love with you, and I have to get over that and if you keep- if you keep saying things like that, then I never will.”
Harry's not ready to have sex but that doesn't mean he's going to pass up the opportunity to kiss Malfoy in his fancy silk pajamas. Harry reaches out to touch said pajamas and bites back a moan. They feel so good and Harry can't resist running his hands all over Malfoy's chest and back.
Harry’s hands shake, his head aches and his heart is still attempting to escape his chest. There are rules. Everyone knows you’re not meant to know what your future is like.
’. “I’m really surprised,” Harry answered, picking up the tee-shirt and adding it to the pile. “After what you said to Mediwitch Hayes about your mum prophesying a daughter.”
Malfoy crosses his arms over his chest and glares at Harry from across the table. Harry looks down into his empty porridge bowl wishing it contained an answer.
Draco kneads the pillowy-soft dough and then gently rolls it out. It's still dark out, but his kitchen is spilling warm light out into the garden and his coffee is hot. He's making cinnamon rolls for Harry Potter.
He was vomiting into Flint’s posh marble sink, and was entirely mortified about the fact. It had only taken one sniff of the bouquet decorating Marcus’s lounge to have him parting with his dinner.
They take a path through the grounds that grows steadily greener the further they get from the house. Malfoy seems used to being trailed by several animals and out on the grounds with his wellies on he looks very Lord of the Manor. The extensive grounds aren't simply rolling English hillsides, but gardens with sculpted hedgerows arranged around fountains and peacock statues. Here, where the greenery hasn't withered, there are benches tucked between flowering trees and paths that trail off between rose bushes so large Hagrid would be proud, and lead to gazebos surrounded by nymph statues.
“Time to pick the materials for your new clothes,” the witch chirped cheerfully, oblivious to what she’d seen. Merlin, but it was a good job he had a task at hand, and something to occupy his brain for the next few minutes. Had Harry held him even a moment longer, Draco didn’t think he could have been held responsible for his actions.
Draco got up, and walked over to Harry. He kissed him. He felt Harry’s surprise against his lips, but it didn’t take very long before the other wizard was kissing him back.
Nothing had changed in the Paternity Department: everything was as tasteful, and as sedate as it’d been on Draco’s first visit – even the issues of
“You go to sleep,” Greg answered, making no effort to mask his yawn. “You’re knackered, and so am I. Tomorrow morning you and I are going to have a chat with the team Mediwix, just like Marcus suggested. He’ll tell you what happens next, whatever you decide to do.” With that, Goyle gave Draco’s arm a friendly cuff – their version of a hug – before retreating to his own side of the room. Draco watched his mate ready himself to go back to bed, but he didn’t make a move. He was
Bill works with them through the afternoon, unshrinking massive four poster beds and chaise lounges and fancy end tables and giant vases, and at 4:00 asks Harry if he can get the last few bits of furniture because he's due back at Gringotts for a meeting. Harry agrees and Bill claps him on the shoulder, telling him not to have too much fun and he'll see him at the Burrow Sunday.
the Quidditch pitch, but Malfoy is looking determined and Harry can't very well uninvite him now that Ron's already done it and Ron knows it, the freckled bastard.
Malfoy sticks his sodding nose in the air and starts back up the path at a fast clip. Harry nearly trips over a peacock trying to follow him and the peacock's startled squawk doesn't cover Malfoy's mean laughter. Harry vows to come back tomorrow with a spell for repelling peacocks.
Harry shrugs. "If I quit I don't really have anything else to do. Might as well get paid to date Malfoy until I figure out the next thing."
The only thing Harry can think to contribute to the conversation is his surprise that it's happening at all, but Hermione and Malfoy are so deep in a rapid fire exchange about each Governor's political leanings that Harry couldn't get a word in edgewise even if he wanted to.
And they kiss, naked bodies pressed together, hands resting comfortably on hips, and shoulders, on the crook of the other’s elbow, or knee. Their lips follow the shape of the other’s own, and Harry wonders what it’s like to know another body as if it’s your own.
He looks up at the Manor through the gate, his hands stuffed in his pockets. The whole house seems to be sagging inward, like it's slumping its shoulders in a long, silent shudder. Maybe he ought to feel more dread or something, about being assigned to the sorry house Voldemort made his headquarters, where Harry and his friends were held prisoner, but he doesn't. If Harry had to avoid every place where something terrible happened to him he wouldn't even be able to go to Tesco, much less Hogwarts.
“Draco?” Harry asked. He hadn’t moved his hand, and a hot coil of magic penetrated his skin, profound and physical. Draco supposed he ought to shake it off, ought to smile, tell Harry it was late, and he was tired. He didn’t. Instead, he gathered his courage and looked up. Harry was close, closer than he’s thought he was. Warm breath mingled between them, and Draco’s eyes flicked to the other man’s lips. Circe, but Draco
Harry realizes he's staring at Malfoy, as face tipped up to the sun and eyes closed, he takes another sip of wine and smiles. That smile is starting to do things to Harry's insides.
Draco nodded, a million Wrackspurts in his belly dancing with anticipation. “The charm doesn’t work properly,” he cut in, trying as he spoke to sit up and failing. Harry’s weight pressing down on him, reassuring and solid. He tried to give Harry an alluring come-to-bed glance but wondered whether he only came off as keen. Fuck, but Draco wanted this so much. “I’ve got condoms, but they’re in my bedroom,” he said. “I suggest we go and find them.”
These are the things that stick out to him: there are two sets of uniforms in the wardrobe, and neither of those are the Auror Department’s familiar deep burgundy. Instead, there is a row of midnight blue robes with the requisite ‘D. M.’ from Mysteries embroidered on it in gold, an Unspeakable, and a row of bright lime green robes, the slighty lighter pastel of a Healer in training.
That is exactly what Malfoy is saying, Harry finds out over his third helping of lasagna, listening to Malfoy and Hermione strategize three nonsense votes they can push through at the next board meeting before they bring Professor Binn's employment decision up for a vote.
Merlin, but how could he possibly still be throwing up? It didn’t make one jot of sense. He’d felt awful that morning, nauseous and sluggish, and he’d only managed a few bites of the marmalade-on-toast and coffee that he normally adored.
One of the candles has burned low and flickers out, leaving them in decidedly romantic dim lighting. Harry's palms are sweaty now. What if the drunk kiss was Harry's best effort? Suppose he's always a sloppy kisser. Malfoy probably isn't. He's probably a very not-sloppy kisser, like when he cooks, every movement smooth, nothing wasted.
"Malfoy, I'm probably the only person who knows what that's like. I lived with a piece of Voldemort's twisted soul in my
It was. Instead of replying, Harry kissed him once again, taking control and deepening their kiss. It was a little harder this time, and Draco opened his mouth, allowing Harry entry. Their tongues tussled against one another’s, and Draco deepened the kiss, enjoying their intimacy and the slick heat of Harry’s mouth.
"You wouldn't believe the amount of parchment I had to fill out to get a single Portkey, with additional parchment promising I would not Apparate anywhere, nor fly via broom, magic carpet, or vespa. It was this thick," Malfoy holds his thumb and forefinger as wide apart as they'll go. "And I'm pretty sure they're only letting me go because Saint Potter is forced to accompany me. So, no, no aperitivos and taralli in an outdoor cafe in a cobbled square."
Draco realised he was shaking, and he knotted his fingers together, squeezing his knuckles, tying to centre himself. He’d never admitted all of this before, not even to himself. Loving Harry wasn’t a course of action that was open to him. Loving Harry only meant hurt, and he couldn’t open himself to that. Not now, not when he had his baby to consider. They came first, not his silly crush. What Harry and he had together, it worked, and he couldn’t put that in jeopardy, not for selfish feelings.
He needed to get back to the bedroom. That was the best course of action. His wand was there, and with that, he’d be able to summon help. It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was a plan nevertheless. It might have only been a minute that he was sat there, massaging his lower back, or it might have been longer, but mercifully – thank Merlin, thank all the deities – all of a sudden, the pain vanished.
There’d been the rancid stink of defeat, and the angry chants of furious fans, ringing deafeningly in his ears.
Harry made a small, uncommitted noise, and lifted a fork of pasta to his mouth. The two wizards ate for a moment, focused on their food.
“Circe’s tits,” Flint said, coming to his aid. His captain walked over and took his shoulder. He led Draco out the room like he’d been rendered an invalid, and sat him on a chair. Draco couldn’t have been more embarrassed, but he let himself be led, feeling a little thankful for the attention. Greg spelled the sink clean, cast an Air Cleansing Charm and joined them moments later
They’d eat sweet elf-made treats, and talk about very little at all. Draco's second appointment at St Mungo’s crept up on him, and before he knew it, their big day had arrived.
“I wasn’t alone,” Draco answered, loathing how self-righteous he sounded. It was always the same when he got upset. His voice reverted to the ludicrous, cut-glass, aristocratic intonation of Lucius Malfoy, which did nothing except put up other people’s backs. “I was with Greg! We brought the tests together. And he came with me to see Braithwaite. Goyle’s the only other person who knows. Him and Millie! I wasn’t alone!”
The elf-waiter arrived back at their table just then. Harry had selected Carrot Cake, but Draco, his appetite having returned, had chosen the Treacle Tart Sundae. It was a vast, delightful thing of beauty, covered in sprinkles and chocolate sauce, and Draco felt his tummy grumble at the very sight.
Then, once he’d frightened himself with everything he could expect in the following few months, Draco felt exhausted. A short nap sounded like just the ticket, so he lay down on his bed and proceeded to snooze most of the afternoon away.
"A reduced puttanesca sauce, perhaps? With a generous handful of parmesan I think. Potter, go get the olives."
“Just that I’m happy,” Harry said, frowning at the sudden frostiness of Draco’s manner. “A baby wasn’t what either of us were expecting,” Harry clarified, “and I certainly wasn’t sure that I was ready – that I’d
It's not the most unpleasant breakfast Harry's ever had because Harry's eaten breakfast with Aunt Marge, each and every time of which was far worse than quietly eating gray crepes with Draco Malfoy. Harry just didn't anticipate that being Malfoy's security would include gray crepe breakfast spreads. He didn't expect his childhood bully to ask him how Harry takes his tea. Next Harry will be grabbing a pint with Dudley.
"No? Let's try a little experiment then, hmm? Potter, I'm sorry I was a horrible little shit to you for six years." Malfoy waits for a beat. "Do you feel better?"
“Heard and understood,” Draco said, trying not to let his feelings about what Greg had said show visibly on his face, “though I expect I was talking about racing brooms when I was a twelve-year-old.”
Someone clears their throat beside Harry and he springs back from Malfoy, into the sneezing daffodils, which shower him with more glitter. Harry turns to the cougher, apology ready, and sees it's none other than Neville.
After the bedroom, sight unseen, Malfoy starts insisting on the kitchen. In fact, he barges his way into Harry's flat somehow and starts objecting to everything he sees in Harry's kitchen.
It starts with Malfoy thrusting his head through the Floo thirty minutes early and hollering Harry's name in a panic. Harry, thinking Malfoy's under attack, grabs his wand and runs to the Floo.
Harry placed his half-eaten sandwich onto his plate. “And I’m sorry I was an arsehole in Café Quendryth,” Harry continued. “You, telling me out of the blue like you did? Well, it was a lot to take in. Even so, I shouldn’t have called you a proud prick or said that you were arrogant. I’ve been cursing myself all week.”
Harry and he argued over the merits of musicals for another few minutes, and then Harry repositioned himself, letting his shoulder rest against Draco’s own. Every slim, tiny piece of interest that Draco had invested in the film evaporated, and, as Harry moved his arm so that it rested across the back of the settee, Draco settled into it. Quite honestly, Harry didn’t have any business being quite as comfortable to cuddle as he was – the wizard was all hard lines and muscle – but Draco couldn’t help himself. Draco leant into him, burrowing into Harry’s chest, pleased at how well their bodies fit together.
They make sure all the Thestrals are under the cover of the trees and Hagrid pulls several things out of his great coat that Luna unshrinks—a few water troughs and several giant bags of wet composting leaves. Hagrid makes several nests from the earthy smelling leaves while Luna and Harry fill the troughs with
Soon enough, the bath is full of water, steam curling above it, perfumed with lush florals and fresh citrus. “You can get in,” Draco announces.
Malfoy looks at him speculatively, like maybe he too is trying to find the right words to not hurt Harry and Harry likes the thought, thinks maybe it's a good sign. He shuffles his feet a little closer and rests his cheek against Malfoy's shoulder. Harry's nose is just about even with the dip between Malfoy's clavicles and he takes advantage of this fact by kissing that small soft space.
.” He wiped away a furious tear, not even sure why he was crying. It wasn’t like getting bigger ought to be any kind of shock.
And, "I appreciate that some people are still looking for the perfect chocolate cake recipe but I, having already found it, am a little underwhelmed by these basic cake flavors."
was very much the same as the previous appointment. Sparkly purple magic filled the air and coalesced into the form of their baby. “Oh, it’s very clear,” Hayes said, the anticipation in the room palpable. “A little girl, gentlemen. You’re having a daughter.”
