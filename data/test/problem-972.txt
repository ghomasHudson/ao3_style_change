Mcgonagall looks amused by this, as if she knows full well that Harry is dying to kick Malfoy in
“You’re a great seeker when you’re not cheating and jumping on the end of other people’s brooms Malfoy.”
“Not funny, Potter.”
“Okay,” Harry says looking back to the article, his eyes catching on one particularly awful paragraph.
Harry is a little taken aback by Ron’s suggestion, but knows that Ron is doing it to ease the sting of George and Ginny’s reactions.
Above it all though Ron’s voice raises above them, “Everyone quiet!” He glares at everyone until they’re all looking at him before continuing, “I know you lot are upset and confused by Harry’s announcement. Hell, I’ve known longer than you and I’m still confused. But Harry is still Harry. He’s not being tricked or blackmailed. He hasn’t been put under a curse. Believe me I’ve checked.”
Harry pauses, he and Draco hadn’t actually gone on a date since the night out with Teddy, and he desperately wants to. But he’s also exhausted.
“You gonna tell me what you’re getting yet?”
Harry grins and laughs, “They were bound to find out eventually.”
Draco looks at it for a moment before setting his phone face down on the table without answering. Harry will find him soon enough. He just needs time to sort through his feelings and compartmentalize a little bit.
Harry grins and turns back to his team. “Alright, we’re gonna scrimmage with the Slytherins, don’t do any serious harm or you’ll sit out the first game got it?”
“I’ll have you know that not everyone thinks I dress terribly.” Harry responds, deciding to stand up and loop his arms around Draco, his chest to Draco’s back.
After the party at the Weasley’s, Harry’d received numerous hugs while Draco got the same amount of handshakes. They had barely made it out the door amidst a bunch of family members cooing at Teddy sleeping against Malfoy’s chest.
“Okay,” says Harry, laughing. “Whatever you say Ron.”
People bustle around him, but Harry makes good time and pushes the Starbucks door open. It is warm inside, and the air smells like pumpkin spice, which has Harry thinking longingly about Hogwarts pumpkin juice for a moment.
“Hey, love,” He says, gently shoving Draco’s shoulder. Draco makes a very undignified sound, but stills at Harry’s next words, “Pansy is on the phone for you.”
This statement hangs between them for a moment before Hermione says softly, “I’m not saying you are, Harry. What I am saying is that you’re in love with Draco. I’ve never seen you like this before, if only you could see the way your face lights up when he walks into a room, it’s like everything else around you fades away.”
Harry shrugs again, and makes no move to pull away from Malfoy. He’s enjoying these final moments of casual touch where he can get them, because as soon as he tells Malfoy what Hermione said, he knows Malfoy will want nothing to do with him.
Groaning even louder, he throws the blankets off and stumbles towards the sound of one of the phones. His eyes are barely open and he searches blindly through a pair of pants and fishes out a phone.
Harry realizes that that’s too much to say to Neville, especially when he hasn’t said half as much to Draco. He’s beginning to suspect that this relationship is a much bigger deal than he is making it out to be. Before he lets himself wander too far down that rabbit hole he glances back to Neville and says a much more condensed version of what was going on in his head.
the shins one more time.
Harry laughs and holds his hand out for Malfoy to grab hold of. “Yes Malfoy, he’s a metamorphmagus.”
Harry hides his smile by pressing his face into Draco’s stomach, “Okay love.”
Shrugging, Harry brings his hand up to the back of his neck nervously and says, “A little. I considered asking if you wanted to move into Grimmauld Place with me. It’s pretty secure, and Kreacher would be happy to be back there I think.”
“I mean, I don’t know what else you were expecting.” Harry says finally emerging from the diaper bag with cheerios and a banana. He decides the banana will be easier to feed Teddy without a tray or highchair, and begins to peel it.
“Once. We have to do this once and then we can put up spells so that no one can find us ever again.”
Kreacher has the table set and food served and is trying his best to get Teddy to eat but so far it doesn’t seem to be working. More food seems to be smeared on Teddy’s face and highchair table than in the bowl. He’s crying and reaches for Harry when he sees him.
“I just testified on your behalf at your trial.” Harry mumbles, averting his eyes. “It was no big deal.”
Hermione’s voice is a normal occurrence in his ear, so it helps Harry orient himself with the here and now.
Harry laughs before turning to examine the blanket again, “Why’s it so heavy?”
“Come on, let’s get back to the castle for dinner.” Malfoy says, extending a hand to Harry.
“Who else knows?” She breathes.
“I know Ron, that’s just how it feels sometimes.” Harry replies, looking down at his feet.
*  *  *
This chain of events leads to a very pleased Harry privately thinking that seeing Malfoy dressed in his clothes, looking all tired and comfortable, is almost better then the whole snogging thing. He doesn’t dwell on this too long, not wanting to think about what this revelation means about his feelings for Malfoy.
Harry tips his head back and laughs, looking back at Draco in time to see a small smirk grace the other boys mouth.
Harry isn’t quite sure, so he decides to just pepper Malfoy with questions for the time being.
Harry crosses the kitchen and takes the pop out of Draco’s hand and replacing it with a bottle of orange juice. Draco scowls slightly but lets it happen.
After a while Draco finally does speak.
“No Hermione, I really don’t. Ron’s the one who came in here and started the whole thing, why don’t you ask him.” Harry says impatiently.
It’s a short call, in which Draco is mostly silent. His cheeks tint pink at something Blaise says, and he mutters a quick, “Shut up, Blaise.” But otherwise his answers are either yes, no, or sporadic grunts of confirmation.
“What are we even fighting about?” Malfoy asks, looking at Harry full in the face.
Harry catches himself twisting his hand in Malfoy’s robe in an attempt to slow his heart. He hesitates to continue when he catches both Ron and Hermione’s eyes dart in their direction.
Sighing, Harry heads down the stairs, preparing himself for telling the rest of the Weasley's and praying they still love him after.
Harry looks at Malfoy quickly and then down at his laptop, his cheeks colouring in embarrassment. “Working, Malfoy.”
The Quibbler, taking advantage of the interest, had released their interview with Harry and Draco yesterday.
“Ron knows about this little lunch meet?”
*  *  *
Draco’s socked feet are pushed into Harry’s thigh when he wakes up to a tapping at his window. There’s an owl, Harry gets up to let her in and unties it. He recognizes Mrs Weasley’s handwriting and sits on the edge of the bed to read the letter.
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand one more time before letting go and turning his attention to the plate of food in front of him. Breakfast isn’t as good as it would have been if Kreacher had made it, but the fact that Draco made it for Harry more than makes up for the sub-par taste.
As they enter, a wave of familiar breakfast sounds hit them and Harry soaks in the feeling of being home. Malfoy doesn’t seem to care and walks quickly past the Ravenclaw table. Harry comes to a stop at the Gryffindor table and makes to turn in when he notices that Malfoy is still walking. Ignoring the wave of noise now at his back as the Gryffindors realize who he is, Harry grabs Malfoy’s sleeve.
“I don’t know Hermione! We get coffee and insult each other while we do our homework.” sighing and rubbing his eyes with his free hand he adds, “I suppose we’re sort of friends now.”
“It’s better this way. The Muggles aren’t scared of me and wizard press doesn’t think to come looking in muggle London for ex death eaters. I can come and go as I please and just be without every single person watching me.”
He feels his pulse quicken and he’s not sure why.
Harry laughs before closing his eyes, and falls into a peaceful sleep.
Harry is briefly taken aback by Malfoy’s forwardness, but realizes that there really is no point in beating around the bush.
Draco snorts but says nothing. After a little bit Ron and Hermione end up leaving, saying that they have some work to do back home, but beg Harry to call if he needs anything. Harry agrees, while gently pushing them both out the apartment door.
Harry shrugs before saying, “Why not? Who cares?”
Harry can’t stop the grin that splits his face, and barely stops himself from leaning in and kissing Draco. Somehow he manages to look back to the reporter and nod, while bringing Draco’s hand up to his mouth and kissing the back of it quickly.
*  *  *
There, no one knows him. No one looks at him funny when he doesn’t use magic to cook or clean or for any other simple tasks. No one calls his name in the streets asking for autographs, or for the secret of how he did it all. He is able to leave the house without getting ambushed by reporters asking him what’s next for The Boy Who Lived?
“Ginny dear, we can’t expect the boys to talk about their relationship with us.” Mrs Weasley says hesitatingly, “We can just be there for them while they go through this.”
A very angry Ron Weasley is making his way towards the Slytherin table, his wand already out and pointed at Malfoy’s heart.
Harry nods quickly, and gently pulls Draco with him, even as the other boy argues over his shoulder with Ron.
“I’m pretty sure he got pictures of us.” Draco breathes, his breath showing in the cold air. “It will definitely get out now.”
“I’m sure he is.” Harry says, planting a kiss on Draco’s cheek, “And Mrs. Weasley wanted to talk to us quickly.”
Harry looks at him blankly before saying, “How’d you get past my wards?”
Harry wishes he knew what that smile meant.
Within seconds the door is flung open and Draco watches as Harry is pulled in to a rough hug from a plump women who Draco can only assume is Molly Weasley. After a few moments, the hug breaks and Harry steps back and grabs hold of Draco’s hand again.
Harry breaks eye contact and looks at his knees, trying to figure out a way to say he misses the castle too much to not come back, and that Auror training is not at all like he was expecting. But Malfoy ends up finding an answer for him.
“Hello? Draco?”
“Don’t be thick.” Harry says, his voice sounding hoarse to his own ears, he must have screamed at some point during the nightmare.
“Oh shove off Potter. It was a nosebleed. Calm down, I’m sure you had worse when you were out with your merry men in the forest.”
“Professor, I would hardly call opening the doors of a shed breaking in.” Harry replied, not ready to admit the real reason he was there.
“I’ve been better, Granger.” He says, letting her work out what that means herself, and making to cross the room to stand at Harry’s side again. He doesn’t mean to be short with her but, this visit is driving his anxiety through the roof and Harry makes him feel at home.
In response Draco grabs one of Harry’s hands and kisses it. “Go to sleep, Harry.”
“You two are cute together. Ready to pay yet mate?”
It wouldn’t even be that they’re both boys, people didn’t even bat an eye when Dean and Seamus showed up as a couple to Hermione’s birthday together. It would be that fact that the savior of the wizarding world was cuddling under the comforters with an ex death eater. The headlines that Rita Skeeter would write would be hilarious, and he knows that Malfoy would likely handle it all with a sneer and fake confidence.
“How the hell do you know about that?”
The words hang in the silence, and Malfoy stands frozen mouth hanging open.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry slides in next to him, “I’m sorry, I panicked and I didn’t want our relationship getting out to the public through Rita Skeeter’s quill.”
He eats as quickly as he can, not really hungry but knowing that his body needs the food, and washes the dishes in the sink. Draco is in the other room getting Teddy dressed and packing up the diaper bag and Teddy’s toys.
“Alright, if you change your mind you know where to find us.”
He closes his eyes again against that thought and leans his forehead against Draco’s, taking a deep breath. Those are thoughts for later, he’s not going to ruin this moment by overthinking everything to death. That’s normally Hermione’s job.
*  *  *
“Here? At my table? You can’t find your own?”
Malfoy spits this all out within a matter of seconds. He seems to be trying to convince himself rather than Harry judging by the vulnerable look in his eyes.
Harry nods, closes his eyes and rubs his temples. Vaguely, he registers that his flat is freezing but he doesn’t really care right now, the cool air calms him down and makes him feel less panicky.
Harry snorts, “I’m glad that’s what swayed you.”
Harry tries again, “I mean I thought Hermione would be easy to buy for, but this year I’m struggling.”
Harry stops again to make sure Ron is following before continuing.
Malfoy looks at him and says “Oh and why is that Potter?”
But when the reporter says, “And what are your plans for the future, boys?” Harry draws a blank and Draco steps in.
Ron explains that he was in Hogsmeade for a house call, dealing with an old wizard who was convinced people were breaking into his shop, and that was the reason he had decided to visit the castle yesterday.
Malfoy gives Harry a funny look, so he elaborates. “Hogwarts is the only place on earth that has ever felt like a home to me. It’s the first place for a lot of good things, but for me the death and war overshadow it. I want to go back but I can’t. Is it not just as bad, if not worse for you considering your reputation?”
Malfoy nods again and they leave the bathroom. Malfoy then leads Harry into a living room/ bedroom combination. There’s a bed and two couches arranged somewhat artfully around the room. Malfoy stands self consciously at the edge.
“Hermione,” he starts, “it’s just that it’s Luna. She’s my friend and she's friends with everyone I'm close to, I just don’t feel comfortable baring my soul for her alright?”
For once Malfoy doesn’t have a witty remark to make. He looks at Harry blankly for a moment before giving Harry one of his rare smiles, “Well come on then Potter, those sausages aren’t gonna eat themselves.”
“Definitely.” Harry says stepping forward to hug Andromeda, and then stooping down to pat Teddy’s head.
Harry watches her retreating figure for a moment before turning back to Draco.
“Wipe that smirk off your face Potter, there’s no reason to look so happy entering a pub full of Gryffindors.”
“You okay?” Harry mumbles, trying not to be overheard.
He meets Hermione’s eye one last time before leaving, and they seem to have a silent conversation that ends with Ron grinning and turning on his heel to go.
“Potter.”
So they lay there. Harry awake and just enjoying being with Draco, and Draco asleep and seemingly content to stay that way. It’s almost noon when Draco finally wakes up.
He steps in and looks around, noticing a few more pictures of her with friends and her brothers than there were before, as well as some plants that he recognizes from the Lovegood’s house. He turns to face her only to find her still standing by the door and watching him look around.
With them pressed close together in a warm hug, it’s impossible to ignore how similar they look. Teddy’s hair had long since morphed to match Draco’s platinum blonde, and Harry knows that if they both opened their eyes, the colours would match. Even their skin colouring is the same.
He feels his phone buzz in his pocket but ignores it, instead reaching for his wand. Hesitantly, he adjusts the wards barring Ron and Hermione from apparating directly in. He loves them but right now he doesn’t need to see them. He needs to think.
Harry grins and quips back, “Eat with trolls often Malfoy? That manor of yours must have been something else.”
Christmas comes before Harry is ready for it. He has all his presents and decides to send them out instead of waiting to deliver them at the reunion. He gets presents in kind, and Harry smiles at the thoughtfulness that goes into them, and smiles even more when both Hermione and Luna send Draco a present as well.
“Come on.” He says, holding his hand out to Malfoy. “Lets eat some dinner and play with my stupidly adorable kid.”
“I’m grand Andromeda, how are you and Teddy doing?”
That forces Harry’s eyes open, and clears his head of the buzzing. “The photos got out today didn’t they?”
“God,” he said, his voice muffled, “I’ve missed this couch.”
Malfoy scoffs and mutters, “That was one time Potter.” But looks pleased as he does so.
Harry snags one of the sausages off of Draco’s plate, “It just might, Draco. You never know.”
Ginny smiles at the two of them, before waving once and heading out of the bar. Harry turns to face Draco, shrugging on the jacket that is offered to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He attempts to run drills as well. He halfheartedly gives out instructions and comments, but his mind is elsewhere.
It’s wildly unfair when Harry thinks about it. Harry has to restrain himself constantly from pushing Draco up against every available surface for a snog because Draco looks like some sort of greek god, and Draco just has to look at Harry, who dresses like a house elf most days and has the hair of a manic pixie.
Harry hears Hermione sigh before answering. “It was going to be a surprise before Harry ruined it. I’ve tested out of everything already so I’m helping Professor Flitwick with his charms classes until the end of the year. Just marking and stuff.”
“Me.” Harry says simply, and tosses the silver and green quidditch robes that were crumpled at the bottom of their wardrobe onto Malfoy’s head.
“I know,” says Draco, “But they don’t think that I’m in love with you too.”
Dinner is uneventful. The commotion really begins as he and Malfoy start getting ready for bed. Malfoy, the twat that he is, has moved his bed as far away from Harry as he can get. Claiming that, "Sharing a room with Harry is as insufferable as is, he doesn't need to share breathing air with him too."
Luna makes a note in a notepad and says, “Interesting, would you say you felt safe there?”
The other Slytherins have noticed Harry’s presence and are leaning in listening to Malfoy’s and his conversation.
“You made bets on us?” He asks faintly, glancing over at Malfoy who’s toying with his phone.
“What?” Harry says, grabbing Draco’s hand and leading him down the street.
So Harry had. And now the majority of the Weasley’s are sitting in the kitchen and looking at him expectantly.
Draco nods, taking his hand out of Harry’s hair to lie down on the other couch. “It is quite strenuous, I won’t lie.”
“Yes Professor,” Ron grinds out, not taking his eyes off Harry, “It won’t happen again.”
Harry turns his body to lean against Draco’s chest, and Draco’s arms immediately go up to wrap around him.
Harry happily obliges, and wonders aloud about who is all going to come to the Gryffindor reunion, his subtle attempt at asking if Draco had thought anymore about the event.
Malfoy is kissing a path down his neck and onto his chest, pausing to plant a featherlight one across the scar left by the horcrux before sinking to his knees.
“He doesn’t like the Cannons, mate.”
Harry rolls his eyes and laughs, “You and your bloody beverages, are they all you ever think about?”
is being aired, Harry hears the sharp crack of someone apparating into his kitchen.
Harry feels warmth flush his chest and steps in between Draco’s legs before kissing the other boys forehead lightly, “And you’re telling me that I’m the sweet one in this relationship?”
“The blanket was for fun, this one actually means something.”
Harry thinks for a moment, not entirely sure of the answer.
Draco finally looks up and fixes his grey eyes on Harry, a crease has formed between his eyebrows and Harry smooths his thumb over it. Malfoy swats his hand away.
“You don’t have to get anything today if you don’t want to.” Draco says quietly, running his thumb over the back of Harry’s knuckles.
“How did they even get all of those pictures?” Harry says, scrubbing his free hand across his face. “We were in Muggle London pretty much every time. Do they have photographers following us somehow?”
At her voice, Teddy stops crying and looks around for the source, reaching towards her when he sees her. She gladly scoops him out of Harry’s arms and cradles the baby to her chest.
Already Draco misses the warmth. But he pulls himself together and breathes out slowly.
They follow a woman with at least a dozen piercings decorating her ears to the back of the shop. Harry should be getting slightly nervous, but all he can think about is how many times he would get his shirt caught if he had that many earrings.
“That sucked.”
With the pressure of school getting to Malfoy, and Hermione shooting them questioning looks whenever they’re in her line of sight, Harry is desperate for the weekend to come.
This is the thought that is rattling around in his head when Draco pushes the door of Zonko’s open. There is no one else in the shop besides the owner, who looks pleasantly surprised at the sight of Harry, less so at the sight of Draco, and even more so at the sight of the them holding hands.
“What did Granger want?” Malfoy asks quietly after making sure Ron and Hermione have started their own conversation, bringing Harry’s attention back to him.
When they get back to their room, Harry goes to pull out a charms essay that he needs to have done for Hermione and Flitwick, but Draco takes it out of his hands.
Malfoy’s body is tense but he slowly raises his arms to hug Andromeda back. After a few more seconds the hug breaks and Malfoy steps back to Harry’s side and presses his shoulder against his.
*  *  *
“Hey love,” Harry starts waiting for Draco to hum that he was listening, “I was thinking we could do an interview after our tattoo appointment?”
“Potter, us snogging does not change the fact that we have homework that needs to be done. I’ll be in the library when you’re ready to start acting like a sane person again.
Harry looks at her once and shakes his head. But before he can say anything Hermione says, “You know, Ron said he would be here if I needed his backup, but really I think he was glad to get to spend time with Draco.”
Harry smiles at her, but his attention immediately returns to Draco when he grabs Harry’s hands.
“You do?” He says hopefully.
Harry misses Hogwarts with an all encompassing sort of pain, but he also knows that he can’t go back. Not yet anyways. He isn’t ready to see the place where so many people died. He follows this train of thought for a while before realizing that Hermione had asked him something.
It seems to take quite a bit of effort, but Malfoy grits out, “I want you too, Potter.”
“Oh. Hi mate.” Harry says, not really certain of how to talk to Ron or Hermione as he hasn’t really spoken to them since the intervention.
“You’re ridiculous.” he mutters.
For the last while Harry has been so, so tired, but now? Now, Harry Potter is finally happy to be awake.
Harry takes this moment of distraction on Malfoy’s end to sidle up closer and hook his chin over Malfoy’s unoccupied shoulder.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry says, stopping the struggle and letting himself relax against Malfoy, “I’m pretty sure the cruciatus curse was less painful than this.”
“So bloody Malfoy is one of the boys now?” Ginny asks scathingly, “What’s next, his very own Christmas sweater to replace the one you would have made Fred?!”
“Jesus christ, Malfoy.” Harry groans, “Shut up.”
When Harry wakes up the next morning it takes a few seconds for his brain to figure out where he is. His face is pressed into the softness of a couch that is far too expensive to call his own, and the curtains hanging from the window are not the grey that Hermione had picked out when he’d moved in.The panic that follows is minor in comparison to the other times in his life, but it still leaves him sitting and panting on the couch looking around and eventually recalling the surprising events of last night. Malfoy is still passed out in the bed, wrapped tightly in his grey and black duvet, purple socked feet sticking out the bottom. Sunlight streams in through one of the many windows, showing off a line of drool escaping Malfoy’s open mouth. Harry snorts quietly, before getting up and slowly making his way to the kitchen so as not to wake Malfoy. He opens the fridge with one hand, and scratches his messy bedhead with the other. He then searches the cupboards and gathers together the rather pathetic amount of food he manages to find: some stale crackers and a pitcher of milk that’s due to spoil any day now. With that he makes his way out the front door to get some real food.
Panic rears its head in his chest and he starts talking again.
“What, Granger?” He asks quietly, trying to keep any anxiety from showing in his voice.
It starts slow. Calm in a way that doesn’t normally happen on Christmas day. They laze about in bed, trading kisses and a mug of tea between them. They stay in their Christmas pjs but with ugly Christmas jumpers that Harry insisted they buy on top. Draco’s hair is a complete disaster after Harry runs his hands through it so many times, and Harry is certain that his doesn’t look much better.
“Seriously Potter?” He turns his attention back to Mcgonagall before continuing. “He hasn’t worked it out yet, but he wants to come back to Hogwarts because being an Auror is too much like the war. Ya he’s good at it, but he’d rather be doing something else. He just doesn’t want to let people down because he’s their ‘Chosen One’.”
Harry’s heart skips at Draco using the word love to describe their relationship, but it sinks immediately when he takes in everything Draco just said.
Harry’s hand stills momentarily where it’s rubbing his back before starting up again as he says slowly, “Hermione is probably just surprised to see you wearing it. I still don’t think anyone really gets what you mean to me. She’s just curious. She can’t help but be a little nosy at times, she’s working on it.”
“It’s Ginny.” He replies sinking into a chair beside Harry.
“Alright boys. Potter I think it’ll be best for you to just take all the same classes as Malfoy, so you can just follow him for today and get the book lists from his as well. For now, I’m sure that you can share books, as you’ll mostly be working independently together.”
Harry looks at the copious amount of tape and smirks up at Draco. “This looks awful.”
Harry, who was about to defend his honour, suddenly would much rather focus on the leg touching him underneath the table.
Your guys's comments blew us away last chapter! Thank you for your kind words and kudos, words cannot describe how much they brighten our day<3
They start off with basic questions, careers, classes, the occasional Azkaban inquiry, before rapidly diving into the deeper more personal questions. Harry answers them as best he can, knowing that Luna wouldn’t have sent this guy if he wouldn’t do a good job. Draco stays silent for most of it unless asked a direct question.
“Potter have you listened to a thing I’ve said?”
“And what exactly,” Malfoy starts hesitantly, “is your type Potter?”
“No they don’t know where our flat is so we’ve been moderately successful at avoiding them.”
“How are you feeling?” He asks finally, taking a seat on the chair sat at her desk.
Draco closes his eyes, feeling the knot in his stomach ease slightly at the brush of Harry’s fingers through his hair and against his scalp. He feels Harry sink into a crouching position so that their faces are level, but he doesn’t open his eyes.
Harry props his head up to look at Draco’s face for this conversation. “It seems that way, ya.”
Andromeda doesn’t move, and Harry is suddenly sure this was a mistake, but then she pulls Malfoy into a hug.
After charms, Malfoy and Harry head to the library to spend some time catching Harry up on everything he’s missed over the last month. Malfoy is not a patient teacher, and snaps every time Harry asks him a question, but then again Harry grew up with Hermione so he’s used to it at this point.
“I meant transfiguration.” He stutters out. Harry has to get out of here before he starts writing poems about Malfoy’s smile.
“And instead of waking me, you decided that cuddling with Teddy was your burden to bear?” Harry snorts, using his hand to turn Draco’s face back towards him.
Take a peek inside Draco's head to see how he's dealing with being the chosen one's latest charity case
Blaise is silent on the other end. Draco picks absently at the carpet while he waits for Blaise to respond.
By the time they get back to Draco’s flat it’s a quarter past one in the morning, but Harry couldn’t be more awake. He finds himself crowding Draco up against a wall and trailing kisses down his neck.
Draco looks at him for a moment clearly weighing his options for what to say. “She works for the Daily Prophet as an editor. So I thought I’d ask if she had seen anything concerning our little situation at Mungo’s. So far nothing’s crossed her desk.”
“Hello boys, my name’s Janelle, how are we today?”
Harry laughs again, and lets Draco take his hand and lead him over to the bar. Harry crowds into Draco’s space as they lean against the bar and wait for Tom to pass a drink to Draco. He doesn’t particularly care if anyone sees because they all already know, and he rather likes the way that Draco’s hair feels falling against his nose.
Seriously how was he the last one to find out?
Sallow’s face turns to Harry filled with disdain before looking back to Draco, “You’re going to let this boy speak for you?”
Harry laughs at this before saying, “I’ll have you know that I spent quite a bit of time watching Teddy during the summer.”
“I love you. And this is enough.”
Good things about snogging Potter:
“Malfoy, what’s this?”
“Ya,” Draco starts, “there’s just a problem.”
The party is beginning to die down. It’s around 3 o’clock in the morning and Harry is leaning against Draco’s side in a booth, tracing the flower tattoo covering the boy’s forearm in a soothing repetitive motion. Draco is finishing off his last drink and sloppily explaining why the ending of a movie makes total sense to a blackout Seamus and gobsmacked Pavarti. Dean listens in while drawing lines between the freckles on Seamus’s hands.
“For fucks sake Harry why are you and Draco not answering your phones???”
The owls are all relatively silent, each swooping in and waiting their turn for Harry to untie their letters before swooping out again.
He lashes around for his wand and is on his feet in a matter of seconds. He registers the shock on Draco’s face before anything else. His mind is telling him to lower his wand but his body won’t listen.
“I’ll never be ready.” Draco answers, holding his hand out to Harry solemnly, “I need a few drinks in me before I’m ready to deal with the entire Gryffindor house.”
*  *  *
He’s pouting slightly, and Harry can’t help but laugh and wish he were kissing him. Instead he lays his head briefly on Malfoy’s shoulder and says, “Please come with me on Friday?”
Malfoy looks at him for a moment, face carefully blank. “What do you mean figure out who you are?”
“Potter are you busy right now?” Malfoy’s voice sounds tight and stressed in his ear.
His dark hair is messy, and he’s paler than he was during the summer. The cold and lack of sun finally taking a toll on his tanned skin. He’s a bit bulkier than he was in school, having put on some muscle during his auror training, but he still has a relatively thin build. His glasses sit crooked on his nose, which Draco privately thinks is his fault from when he broke it in sixth year. His eyes are beautiful. The last rays of sun hit them and pick up on the gold littered throughout them. Draco could spend forever looking at his eyes.
“You watched him all night,” he said. “You know where he is and what he’s doing at all times. You like him Draco.”
Harry steps closer to him to share the little warmth he has before saying, “We probably shouldn’t. Teddy really really hates it.”
He wonders why fate has to make all the people he cares about in his life unavailable. First his parents, then Sirius, then Ginny, and now, Malfoy. Surely the chosen one deserves a break too?
“I’m in our room, call Kreacher and he’ll take you.”
Harry restrains himself from snorting as Malfoy pokes himself in the eye with the arm of the glasses. He clutches his eye in pain, before catching Harry laughing at him and hastily returning to his stoic expression.
Harry ended up getting two things for Draco. He had wanted to get more, but Draco had insisted that two was more than enough and if he received any more than that he would dump Harry instantly.
He’s gotten used to Malfoy too. He’s gotten used to his snark, the twist of his mouth when Harry says something he thinks is funny but doesn’t want to admit to. He’s memorized what makes Malfoy’s anxiety act up, and knows which dessert he likes best (chocolate mousse).
For once he couldn’t care less about being ignored. Harry drapes his arm casually along the back of his chair as he talks to Charlie, and Draco leans back to allow the arm to be against him. Once again, Harry doesn’t say anything, his lips just quirk up into a smile, and he shifts his arm to actually be around Draco. Their seats are so close, that it takes practically no shifting for Draco to be able to lean into Harry’s side.
Ron’s eyes are glazed over as he listens to the monotone voice of the guest speaker, but they quickly focused on Harry when Ron catches sight of his intense gaze and processes what Harry had just said.
Harry knew Draco was joking, but had decided to follow the other boy’s rules for the time being. Harry holds the wrapped gifts in his lap hesitatingly as Draco enters the room from the kitchen and steps onto the couch before sitting down as close to in Harry’s lap as he can get.
“How’d that go?” Harry asks, finally looking up, worried that Draco went back there by himself and absently playing with the end of Draco’s tie.
“Well he was with me when Mcgonagall told me about your promotion.”
Before long he hears his name though and glances up only to realize that Draco is talking about him to the tattoo artist and doesn’t actually need his attention. Harry continues to hold Draco’s hand, allowing the other boy to hold his tightly whenever he pleases.
The morning of the day they’re meant to get their tattoo, Harry is lying in bed with a still sleeping Draco on his chest. Bright sunlight is streaming into the flat and Harry is content to not move ever.
“Hi I’m Draco. We haven’t met, but I do believe that you’re my aunt.”
“Draco,” Harry says, pulling him in by the back of the neck and into a hug, “I promise you that not a single one of the Weasley’s thinks that.”
After this task is completed Malfoy’s hands are back on Harry’s shoulders, pushing him none too gently towards the back wall. This results in Harry tripping and nearly pulling Malfoy and a shelf full of cleaning supplies to the ground with him.
“Okay boys. I’ll see you soon though. Before you head back to school?”
“Hmm,” Harry replies, before kissing Draco on the cheek. “I honestly don’t care if anyone else reacts well. Ya, it would be nice for my friends to support me, but you can't have everything in life.”
Harry is unsure of what to say next so he stops and looks at Ron, waiting for a response. Ron is looking at Harry contemplatively. Slowly he crosses the room and stops a short distance in front of him.
This is too much, he can feel his face burning. Harry stands up from the table abruptly and Malfoy’s hand falls away, his friends seem startled and Hermione catches a glass before it can spill.
Hey everyone! I hope you're all staying safe and healthy at home. We're nearing the end so enjoy this chapter<3
“I was hesitant to go back there. I associate it with the war, and all the people we lost. Sirius is always going to lurk in the back of my mind while I live there.”
Hermione looks at them both with sympathy, and if she notices the wrecked bed and clothes strewn around the flat she doesn’t mention it. Ron crosses the room with a tray of drinks from Starbucks and hands one to Draco who takes it robotically.
“At my table?”
She pulls away from their hug and plasters a smile on her face, her pale eyes wide. “Right well have a good night Harry, give Teddy a kiss for me.”
- Fulfills a dream that’s been in the making for four years
Malfoy nods silently and stands up, taking Harry’s hand as he does.
The action sparks a memory in Harry’s mind of Malfoy doing a very similar gesture. It had been one afternoon when they were working on some potions homework, and Harry had said something daft that he can’t remember anymore, but he still thinks of the teasing look on Malfoy’s face. His mind goes down a rabbit hole of thinking about what he could have possibly said to warrant Malfoy praying for patience when Hermione snaps her fingers in front of his face and brings him back to reality.
“Obviously, I was joking, Draco.” Harry says, though he’s not sure why it feels like a lie.
Draco rolls his eyes and steps closer to Harry, “I’m calling your bluff, Potter.”
“Is that such a good idea mate?” Ron shakes his head and rephrases the question, “Do you need me to come with you?”
Sighing again, Malfoy gets up and follows Harry to breakfast.
“Well that’s a first.” Draco mutters.
Harry sends up one last prayer to anything that’s listening and says, “So I wanted to tell you all that I’ve started dating someone. And the press got a picture of us together… I didn’t want you guys to find out in the gossip columns so here I am.”
“Ohh not so fond of that idea are we, Malfoy?” Harry grins, leaning in towards Malfoy, shoulders clacking together.
Just as they are leaving the apartment Harry stops to put on his socks and trainers. It’s a whole process that involves sitting on the floor and painstakingly doing up the laces.
His eyes glitter as he says, “Alright, but it’s your funeral.”
“Ya the castle, I didn’t want to have to walk in from the village.”
Once Teddy sees Harry coming he immediately stops crying and holds his arms up for Harry to pick him up. His hair has shifted to a dark brown with blue eyes. Idly, Harry wonders what would happen if Teddy was in daycare and his looks changed so randomly.
“You are so stupidly sweet I can barely stand it.” Draco mutters into the hair above Harry’s ear.
Draco looks away before Harry catches him watching and thinks some more.
Harry tries to adjust Teddy in his arms without dropping Malfoy’s hand. “Ya I decided to go back to school for another year, so I’m mostly just here when I decide to get away for the weekend.”
“Harry?” A sleepy voice says from behind him.
Draco freezes, and leans back to look at Harry in the face. “I hate your flat, it's disgusting even by muggle standards.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes, and sighs but pulls his arms through his robes and then runs his hand through his hair, he hasn’t put any product in it yet and it keeps falling in his eyes. Harry finds that he likes it better that way.
“If it’s what you want, I’m sure Mcgonagall could make some adjustments to your curriculum and I could help you catch up probably.”
He doesn’t want to allow these dreams to plague him anymore. The war has controlled too much of his life, he doesn’t want to give it any more power over him.
Draco makes a choking disbelieving sound that forces Harry to look back up at him.
“Potter are you listening to a word I’m saying?”
Harry gently moves one hand up to Malfoy’s head and runs his fingers through Malfoy’s fair hair. It’s just as soft as Harry remembers from the night before, and no less lovely.
Malfoy has discarded the gel he so often uses in his hair and right now it’s hanging down his forehead and is thoroughly messed from Harry pulling his fingers through it. Harry pulls back to fully look at and admire Malfoy the way he’s always wanted to.
Malfoy lets out another laugh and shoots off to the other end of the pitch. Harry follows. He feels that he could spend forever training on the familiar pitch. For the first time in a while, he isn't thinking of the traumatizing maze that he navigated here, he’s thinking of the aggravating smirk on Malfoy's face as they race above the stands. But, when the sun starts sinking in the sky Malfoy announces that it’s time to go to the castle.
“Janelle will be with you in just a moment, feel free to browse some of the popular designs on the walls, and make sure you fill out these consent forms.” The girl with the piercings chirps and walks back to the lobby, leaving a clipboard and pen behind.
“Hmm, interesting.” Hermione says, and Harry can hear the smirk in her voice.
“It would be nice if you came, going home is always hard.”
“Alright, fine. There will be no punishments today since I think the three of you have done enough damage. However, Mr. Weasley, I’d like an explanation for what you’re doing in the castle right now, and why you saw fit to attack one of my students.”
Sitting in a little carpeted waiting room in a wing in St. Mungos the following morning, Harry wonders if he’s made the right decision. His hands are sweating and he’s alone. Dressed in a rumpled jumper, that he’s pretty sure belongs to Draco, he wanted to avoid attention.
By the time he makes it to their room his heart is racing and he feels hot all over, the only person that could calm him down is the only person he can’t talk to.
Harry almost misses the slight smile that graces Draco's face as he watches the lions roam around, but luckily he looks back at him at just the right time. Harry turns away before Draco catches him looking and grabs the other present he has for Draco.
Harry takes a few seconds to think about it. “I’m not sure. It might be too hard.”
“I suppose. They’re not who I would have chosen-”
The mere thought of Malfoy makes his heart speed up. He lolls his head to the side to stare in Malfoy’s direction once more.
“Harry?” Neville says again, taking a step closer, Luna trailing serenely behind him. “You good mate?”
Harry snorts and looks at Ron, “Grounded is the word I’d use, but sure less broken works too I guess.”
That earns a chuckle from the group, Harry included, and Ron’s eyes dart over to him before saying, “Somehow, Harry sees something in the smarmy bastard that is Malfoy. I’m not going to pretend to understand it, but I do know that he’s the happiest that I’ve seen him in a long time when he’s with him.”
“Draco, talk to me.”
“You take that back Potter, take it back now!”
Harry goes to respond hotly but Ron is already holding his hands up in a placating gesture, “All I meant by that is they lost a lot- no. We lost a lot in the war. They don’t get to see you operating with Malfoy. Give them time Harry. They’ll come around because they love you.”
They both answer and soon conversation picks up again. Draco looks around the room for somewhere to be without being in the way, and ends up wandering into the kitchen. There, Mrs. Weasley and Fleur Delacore stand talking in low voices over a boiling pot.
He leaves out the sharing with Malfoy part, not wanting to turn the conversation in that direction again, though he feels that somehow Hermione will find out eventually.
Draco wishes he were that good at protecting his heart.
Malfoy scoffs before turning and relaying the information to the players in the air and releasing the bludgers and quaffle.
A frail looking house elf enters the room carrying a tray of tea and biscuits. When she sees the boys her eyes grow wide and she upends the tray across her grimy pillowcase attire.
“Jesus Harry. Can’t you focus for one second on something that isn’t Malfoy?”
“What do you mean teaching assistant Harry? Hermione what’s he talking about?”
Harry does indeed know that Ron had wanted Malfoy locked up. They’d argued about it before his trial. Harry had disagreed saying that Malfoy was just a boy like them, who had had a fucked up family. Ron saying that him and Harry had both made conscious decisions about right from wrong and so had Malfoy. Harry maintained the idea that Malfoy was merely trying to survive just like the rest of them, and had told the court that. Harry wonders idly if Malfoy knows that Harry had provided testimony against his imprisonment. Probably not.
It’s nothing new. Nothing that they haven't done in the weeks leading up to this point. But twisted in the sheets with Draco and his stupid fucking socks Harry can’t help feeling like this is the best moment of his life. And frankly he would die to stay in it forever.
“You boys both look peaky. Come in before you freeze to death.”
Malfoy looks around the flat distastefully before turning his attention back to Harry.
Harry thinks for a moment before answering. “I’m not quite sure what I want to be honest Professor. I just know that I need to come back to Hogwarts to figure it out.”
“Episky!”
Before he can hang up Harry interjects. “It clearly is, or you wouldn’t be calling me. I can meet you at the Starbucks in literal seconds if it’s important.”
Harry shrugs, “I feel like I get that anyway.”
Harry looks at Ron incredulously and says, “Ron, you and Hermione are sometimes the only reason I make it through a day. No one and nothing could replace you, it’s just nice to have another person to lean on every once and awhile.”
“Do you have any idea how worried I was, how scar-.”
He isn’t foolish enough to believe in a happy ending for himself, but maybe Harry is foolish and brave enough to dream of a happy ending for both of them.
“What did she say?” Harry asks, brushing a lock of hair out of Draco’s eyes.
Harry shakes his head and stands up too, “No I really have to get back the castle. I shouldn’t have been gone for the whole day anyways.”
Harry gently takes Draco’s hands away from his face and kisses the knuckles. Draco watches him and then tips his head back against the wall and closes his eyes.
“Well her deranged boyfriend is my best friend and you're my friend too, so I want to fix this.”
This whole scenario is oddly deceiving. To an outsider Draco and Harry are just two young men, in the blossoming stages of a relationship, still figuring out how they work. Still blushing when their hands touch, and sharing kind smiles when no one is looking. Maybe to an outsider, they look like 4 friends who got together for dinner after a long day at the office. Maybe to an outsider Teddy is a rambunctious toddler who got into a mess with some kool-aid hair dye.
“I know you’ve brought up Muggle counselling multiple times.” Draco says quickly, his voice pitching lower. “He needs to decide to do it on his own or it won’t work.”
Harry nods and starts jogging in the direction that the other pair had been heading. The Muggle streets are crowded with the dinner crowd, but sure enough he spots Luna’s bright head of hair right outside the door of some restaurant called The Elgin.
Harry feels Malfoy freeze slightly at his side before he drops Harry’s hand. Harry glances to him questioningly while trying to answer the question, “No no, he’s just one of my friend’s kids.”
Harry showers quickly and dresses in the clothing Draco had given him and hurriedly pulls on his coat and boots when seeing Draco sitting patiently on the couch with a fully dressed Teddy.
Malfoy continues laughing, but eventually grabs Harry’s arm to steer him in a new direction. They continue walking, well past the path that leads up to the school. Harry isn’t concerned though. For some reason he finds that he trusts Malfoy. Or at least trusts him not to lead them into danger. Then Harry recognizes the path they’re on.
- Is a secret for just us
“Sorry you had to hear that Harry.”
Harry turns grinning to face him, and reaches out a hand to clap Malfoy’s shoulder.
“Let's go get lunch.” Harry says.
“Fine.” Harry says, knowing that he was going to say yes all along, “We can go out, but I expect an excellent snog for it later.”
“Harry mate, we thought you had died.”
Harry scrambles up, “Bloody hell, Malfoy! Could you not.”
“They’d be stupid not to.” Harry says.
Harry wakes up the next morning alone on the couch. Draco must have gotten tired of almost falling off and went to the bed.
“Alright thanks, Potter.” Malfoy says, squeezing Harry’s hand slightly and knocking his shoulder against Harry’s before retiring to their usual chairs at the back of the shop.
It’s lengthier than the rest, but has the same sentiment as Hagrid’s with an added word about it not affecting their schoolwork, and a final sentence that seems to have been written after the rest. All it says in a hasty scrawl is “be careful.”
He glances entreatingly to Draco, who rolls his eyes and says, “We just need a second. I need to convince him he’s got this.”
Harry laughs slightly as he reclaims his seat near Hermione and Draco sits against his legs, already arguing with Ron about the Chudley Cannons.
Malfoy fares only a little better, and that’s only because every single person trying out for his team is scared shitless of him.
“I’ll have to talk to Draco,” He says slowly, “But we should be able to swing it, I’ll just have to let you know what our schedule is.”
Malfoy pulls away first and rests his forehead against Harry’s, a slight smile on his lips. Harry thinks he might be dragging his jumper through his eggs.
Harry shrugs slightly, “Just killing time while you get your beauty sleep.”
Malfoy slides his eyes in Harry’s direction and says, “Obviously. I’m meeting my mother for dinner tonight at the manor. I need to get ready.”
However, that extra precaution was unnecessary as Teddy had stirred a little but stayed asleep. Harry had summoned Kreacher and had him bring a bag of clothes for Draco and him, as well as their new Christmas jumpers.
“All I mean is,” Hermions starts, brushing a stray curl out of her face, “That’s one of the jumpers Mrs. Weasley made for Harry. Did he tell you to wear it as some sort of gesture, or?”
“Listen Christine, I’d love to catch up but I need to feed Eugene here and it’s awfully cold out. I’ll talk to you later.”
Draco smiles slightly at Harry before looking back at Teddy. Harry looks around the room to see who's all there already, and notices Hermione’s telltale hair in the corner talking to Percy. He tries to catch her eye without leaving Draco’s side, but is interrupted by Mrs. Weasley catching him in a bone crushing hug.
“Oh, just that Malfoy hates me, and I told him absolutely no one believes that anymore.”
Yet, as he walks forward Harry can see Malfoy’s new lion socks peeking out from under his jeans.
“Why are you wearing socks to bed?”
Harry is happy to lay here with Draco with the sunlight streaming in and silence all around. He thinks it might be the first time in his life that he’s been so content which is hilarious when he lets himself think about the fact that both he and Draco were just viciously outed by the press.
She searches in her calendar for a moment before saying, “Excellent. How about Saturdays at 1:30-2:30?”
Of course, breakfast is the best part of the morning. The sausages and porridge he eats distract Harry from the fact that he has literally no clue what any of the professors are saying. He understands some of it, but is struggling to remember his lessons from sixth year. It certainly doesn’t help that Malfoy and him sit by the window each class. Harry can see the quidditch pitch and Hagrid’s hut all morning. Both of which he would much rather be at than in History of Magic.
“Accio Malfoy’s blankets!”
Malfoy scoffs and slides into his own bed.
“Alright there mate?” Ron asks.
Harry lowers the fork full of food that was half way to his mouth, he lowers his voice “We can ask together Malfoy. If they see that we’re working together they shouldn’t have a problem scrimmaging with your team as well."
Harry laughs, and Hermions asks about what spells were used. It’s almost like old times. The only difference is that when they enter the great hall Harry heads to the Slytherin table and Ron and Hermione continue on to Gryffindor. He wishes they would come sit with him and Malfoy, but he knows Ron isn’t quite ready for that just yet.
“You are. Being sweet doesn’t go well with my image.” Draco responds, his lips moving against Harry’s.
“You can go back to sleep in the bed if you want,” Harry calls over his shoulder, “I don’t mind. We don’t have plans until later anyways.”
Harry is laughing uncontrollably at the look on Dean’s face as he watches Seamus and Draco both race to finish their pints, and laughs even harder when Draco slams his down first and yells, “You lost Finnigan! That means you’re buying the next round!”
“Well maybe they should.” Hermione says, crossing her arms and looking across the room to where Ron and Harry are standing in the corner talking lowly.
Draco almost wants the room to himself for a moment so he can do a little happy dance, but that would mean Harry leaving and he’s sure he doesn’t want that.
“Morning boys.” Harry says, walking to the couch to pick up Teddy.
For once in his life Draco apparently has nothing to say and squeezes Harry’s hand to get him to talk. Harry decides that he’ll pretend that him dating Draco is common knowledge.
Harry dares to think about the possibility that Hermione is right, that Malfoy does return his feelings.
“I was drowning.” Harry starts, looking down at the point of contact between their legs rather than Draco’s face. “I was drowning and you were dead, and everyone else was dead and I couldn’t do anything to help you or myself.”
Draco had woken him up that morning with a spectacular round of snogging that quickly escalated into them grabbing at each other's clothes and diving under the covers.
“Just to say that she was sorry. And also to tell me she’s made it onto the Holyhead Harpies.”
Harry stands looking at the floor for what feels like an eternity before Malfoy squeezes his arm once and says, “Thank you Potter, I’m sure that must have been hard.”
“I don’t want to tell anyone yet.” Harry says. “Not until I figure out who I am and things settle down a little bit.”
Mcgonagall looks amused by Malfoy’s speech.
Harry laughs and grabs Draco’s hand, leading him back into the room after sending their sweaters back to Draco’s flat. He feels content and honestly overjoyed that the Weasleys seem to have accepted Draco.
Finally, Harry decides it’s time to go in, but not before his pulls Draco in for a kiss.
“How are we feeling?” Harry murmurs in Draco’s ear, brushing his nose slightly against Draco’s cheek.
There’s silence on the phone for a moment, “Hanging out as in what exactly?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes slightly and turns to look at Teddy who waves a chubby baby fist in their general direction. “It was fine until the little bugger started crying and you didn’t wake up.”
“Completely.”
Smiling himself, Harry leans his head against Malfoy’s and drifts into a peaceful sleep.
It’s loud enough that Harry thinks the whole store can hear, but doesn’t stop him from saying, “Of course, you’ll be on the top of our list!”
Draco breathes in like Harry is fresh air. Like he’s the first breath after being underwater for years. Like he’s the one and only oxygen supply on the entire goddamn planet.
Harry interrupts, “I know, but they’ve always stuck by me. I won’t talk to anyone else.”
Harry snorts but doesn’t respond, more interested in falling back asleep.
“No you don’t.” Harry says breezily, “You hate the furniture. And if we got rid of your flat we could take your furniture and put it in mine.” He lets out a light chuckle, “Wouldn’t it be nice to fall asleep on your leather couch surrounded by my hideous orange walls?”
“I had a good time last night,” He starts hoping to find the end of his sentence along the way, but is stopped by Malfoy jumping in.
Harry’s nose snaps into place and his eyes water, but the throbbing fades to an ache and the blood slows. It’s then that he notices that everyone is still looking at him.
His eyes follow Malfoy as he gestures dramatically, running plays with his team.
Draco trails off mid-sentence to look at Ginny, opening his mouth to say something, but Harry squeezes his hand and gets up, clambering over a nearly unconscious Ron and nearly falling on his face as he makes his way after Ginny.
Laughing, Draco takes a step away. “Christ, you’d think he was ignored every single moment of his life with how he’s acting.”
“Who says I wasn’t feeling fine?” Draco asks, though he doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes.
Hermione nods. “Well he is in all of my classes. We’re the only two eighth years, so we have pretty much all the same classes together. It’s nice to have someone as bright as him to bounce ideas off of. He even takes muggle studies now.”
“What happened, is she okay?”
Harry’s head lolls on the table as he turns to face Malfoy, “And how is it that you know I don’t shit gold exactly?”
Malfoy leans in closer, having noticed the 6 players eavesdropping on their conversation, “You’re the one who wants this thing a secret, so you’d better stop staring at me instead of your players.”
Harry can’t have that, and pulls Draco back towards him and onto the bed.
“Well it wasn’t funny.” Draco says, still refusing to look at Harry but keeping his hands firmly on Harry’s back.
The joke startles a short involuntary laugh out of Draco and Harry looks pleased.
“Did you get my drink?” demands Malfoy, snapping Harry out of his thought spiral.
“You should have seen your face Malfoy. It was priceless.”
Harry sighs good naturedly, “I suppose so Marissa. How much money did we make you?”
“I thought we’d at least have tea before this chat, Potter. You know, warm me up a little before we dive into the horrifyingly serious topic of emotional confrontation.”
They settle back down onto the couch with Harry resting against Malfoy’s chest as Teddy rests on his. After the bottle is done, Teddy wants to cuddle for a while so Harry holds him and rubs his back soothingly.
Draco jerks back, shocked by Harry’s abrupt decision.
Draco’s mind hums happily at the contact, but he forces himself to sneer and say, “What, is walking in a straight line to difficult for you Potter?”
He hears the shower cut off and quickly arranges his face into something resembling neutrality and attempts to fix his hair in the mirror.
Bad things about snogging Potter
Malfoy turns to Harry with a disbelieving look on his face and shoves his shoulder in retaliation. Harry nearly plants his elbow in his macaroni salad. He turns back to get even, but not before catching a slight smirk on Hermione’s mouth as she looks at where Malfoy had pushed Harry’s shoulder. Wondering what that’s about, he turns back to Hermione to ask her why she’s looking at him and Malfoy like that, when she abruptly gets up.
Draco’s catches sight of Harry and shouts across the street, “Oi Potter, some time today please!”
Harry nods and presses a kiss to Draco’s neck which elicits a shiver from the other boy. Harry leans back, and slurring his words much more says, “Are you, love?”
“Is that all Potter?” Malfoy almost whispers, “That doesn’t seem like that big of shoes to fill.”
Harry nods at this, and decides to stay a little while longer to work on his homework some more. Malfoy walks out the door fiddling with his phone. A few seconds later a text pings through on Harry’s phone. He takes it out expecting Hermione or Ron, but laughs when he sees an unsaved number with a text reading “Hey Scarhead it’s Malfoy.”
Harry looks around and grinning like an idiot makes to stand up, but Malfoy’s unruffled facade cracks and he grabs Harry’s sleeve forcing him to sit down again.
“I thought you said that this place was casual?”
“And that’s all it is, Malfoy?” Harry asks, cheekily sliding his hand up Malfoy’s thigh under the table.
Molly hesitates for a second longer, teetering on the edge, before making her way towards the stairs and gesturing for Harry to follow her. They go up the first flight of stairs and Harry waits for Molly to knock gently on the door and have a brief conversation with her daughter. After a few moments Molly leaves, and Ginny is standing in the door looking at Harry.
What seems like only minutes later, Draco is unceremoniously dumping a pile of clothing on Harry’s head.
This thought is punctuated by Harry’s hand skimming along his back as he passes behind him. Draco closes his eyes at the touch. His stomach is in knots and none of his coping mechanisms seem to be working.
Draco is as stiff as a board next to him and staring dead ahead, not even looking in Skeeter’s direction. Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s hand and turns slightly so that he’s standing directly in front of Draco and somewhat blocking Rita’s view of him.
Harry laughs brightly. By the time they make it to the Leaky Cauldron an ecstatic grin still covers his face.
When he emerges five minutes later Malfoy is sitting up on the bed with his robes half on and his eyes drifting shut, head falling forward.
Just as this thought enters his head, a hand gently brushes along the back of his neck. He jolts and whips around only to see Harry sliding into the chair next to him.
There’s silence for a moment as both Neville and Luna look at them. Neville with his mouth hanging open and Luna with an expression of vague interest. It’s Luna who breaks the silence first.
Malfoy looks into Harry’s eyes for another moment before turning away and saying, “Fine Potter, just know that you’ve motivated me to beat your ass out on the pitch now.”
Harry nods in agreement and goes back to watching the mother and son talk.
He makes to go after Ron, sure that Malfoy’s resolve won’t hold, when he feels Hermione’s hand grip his arm and is dragged into the empty charms classroom.
“Alright Potter, me first.”
“I suppose you’re right.” Draco says, taking the piece of banana from Harry’s hand and trying to hand it to Teddy.
“What do you mean? I keep up with the important things.”
“We brought our copy from home.” She says miserably, “We figured you guys hadn’t seen it yet.”
She asked him how he was, and Harry honestly has no idea what he said, but whatever it was caused a flash of alarm to cross her face before a more determined look replaced it and she was at his side.
“Rita if I give you a ten second statement that you cannot alter in any way, shape, or form will you please leave us alone?”
“I have a few ideas.”
It had been a good weekend up until the end, but Harry can’t pretend that he isn’t shaken by the dream, and anxious to get back to Hogwarts and classes.
Harry had grown quite fond of his snitch pants, they even came with a matching jumper, but Harry REALLY doesn’t think it would help his situation if he tells Malfoy about it.
The night continues in much the same relaxed way. No one brings up the article until it’s almost time to go.
He looks at Harry, “Potter, I refuse to wear these.”
Draco looks confused, “What do you mean? This is hardly fancy.”
Harry sputters at the memory. That’s the second time it had been mentioned in the last ten minutes, apparently his clumsiness is universally known.
“Did you wake him up, Teddy?” Harry asks, looking seriously at the baby.
Draco tries to get that voice to shut up, but it’s getting overwhelming loud with each flirtatious comment and lingering stare Harry sends his way.
Hold onto your butts fam
Malfoy grabs Harry’s offered hand but drops the diaper bag and pulls Teddy’s hood up to hide his hair. Grabbing the bag and then catching Harry’s questioning glance he scoffs and says, “We really don’t need every single muggle in London to see the baby’s appearance change right in front of their eyes.”
Dean and Seamus are already drunk, and seem to be having trouble focusing on everyone, but Seamus realizes who’s at the table soon enough and says, slurring his words slightly, “Malfoy, you bastard. Ron says you have some pretty fucked up ideas about Quidditch mate.”
“Have you two made up yet?” She asks, anxiously looking between them.
“I know we said that,” Draco says hesitatingly, “But after Ginny’s little outburst it occurred to me that us not saying anything allows The Prophet to control the story. If we come out with a little statement, nothing too detailed of course, it might ease the pressure a little bit.”
Ron and Hermione show up exactly ten minutes after the phone call with Harry ended. Harry has managed to get Draco into a pair of jogging pants and a jumper, and wrapped in a blanket on the couch. He settles in beside him. Draco is shivering, but Harry doesn’t think it’s because of the cold.
Harry stays quiet and he hears someone on their end get up and leave. A door slams somewhere in the apartment.
It’s slow going. Harry not really sure what to say or how to say it. But Luna is patient and understanding, never prodding or demanding more. More often than not, she asks Harry what he thinks it means, and he’s forced to analyze his own emotions. It’s painful and makes Harry’s throat go tight and hands get sweaty. He’s close to tears multiple times. But he’s determined to work through this. He’s wants to be the only thing that controls his life.
“Alright Draco. I’ll be more specific. Why aren’t you using magic?”
Harry rolls his eyes and finds Teddy on the floor near his playpen playing with a bucket of blocks. He picks the baby up, returns to the empty kitchen, and grabs the bucket of baby shampoo and body wash from under the sink. He runs the warm water and puts the plug in, stripping Teddy while the sink fills and then sets him in.
And then Malfoy’s kissing him.
“Draco stop for a sec, Luna forgot her bag.”
“What do you want us to do, Harry?”
Sighing, Harry tangles his fingers in Draco’s hair, “You can’t go back to sleep, love.”
“Did you want to-” Harry starts handing the paper to Draco, but Draco shakes his head.
Harry falls asleep with a smile on his face, glad Malfoy feels the same.
“Alright," Hermione starts hesitantly when neither Harry or Ron start talking, “I figured you two need to talk it out so we don’t have a repeat of fourth year. I can leave or stay if you want me to.”
“Can we just apparate home?” Draco asks, his teeth chattering in the cold, hair falling in his face, damp from the rain.
“Mrs. Weasley wants the two of us to come for dinner tonight. Her note does not encourage argument.”
He decides to ignore the ringing for now and closes his eyes. It’s at that moment that another phone starts ringing too.
Teddy flails his arms in agreement and Harry decides it’s time for breakfast. He sets Teddy in his high chair and dumps a handful of cheerios in his tray for him to gnaw on while he decides which baby food he’ll attempt to feed him today. He lands on banana baby food and some sort of fruit and yogurt concoction. He also preheats a bottle for afterwards when Teddy will inevitably want one.
He knows it’s a weak comeback, and Malfoy knows it when he turns to his own bed with a teasing smirk on his face. Harry turns over in his bed and gets the lights.
“And he was!” Harry interrupts crossly.
“So what are we working on, Malfoy?”
Malfoy looks at him with something akin to pity. “Everyone would care Potter, everyone.”
Harry laughs at that and goes back to working on an essay for his Auror training, shaking his head at the weird turn his day took, but nonetheless feeling a little bit more centered.
Harry shrugs and looks at the ground. “So?”
This train of thought is promptly derailed when Malfoy pushes Harry backwards onto the couch. Harry looks up at him, startled. He and Malfoy have certainly gotten physical before when their  arguments have gotten too intense, but Malfoy has never pushed him quite like this, with a fiery look in his eyes, and his lips red from where Harry has been kissing them.
Harry tries to get away, or the conscious part of Harry does, but his movement draws the attention of the creatures. He starts to swim, desperately, frantically. He feels a hand wrap around his ankle and looks down only to see the semi rotten face of Draco looking back at him with glassy, unknowing eyes.
“Morning, Potter.” Draco says, voice sleep filled and eyes still closed.
With that Draco stands up, grabs his book bag from the end of the bed and walks out of the room without looking back.
Harry nods and squeezes Draco’s hand before continuing in the direction of the kitchen where he thinks Mrs. Weasley disappeared to. Before he can get there though, Mrs Weasley’s head pops out of the hallway and she beckons with one hand before turning away again.
Harry smiles into it, and pulls Malfoy down onto the couch with him, happier than he’s been in a long time.
“Uhgh,” he groans, taking inventory. He is very very hungover. The Weird Sisters are ringing from a phone somewhere in the room, and there is a very naked Draco still asleep pressed along his side.
Draco flops onto the bed behind him and says, “If you want to look nice, but still feel comfortable, you could borrow one of my jumpers and collared shirts.”
After that, an unspoken agreement seems to have been reached. Where before they would hesitantly offer support, now they do it without thinking. A hand on the arm, fingers twisted in robes, shoulders pressed together.
“Well I suppose I could do that.” Draco says, running a thumb over the back of Harry’s hand, “Green and gold far more suit my skin tone, rather than that garish orange Weasley insists on sporting.”
“Also,” Draco adds, “I’m not entirely sure you can handle yourself and I have a reputation to maintain.”
“You boys can use the floo network to get home. It’s a long walk back to the village and it’s rather late.”
Harry turns his attention back to Neville and takes a couple of steps towards him, letting go of Draco’s hand in the process. “What do you need to know Neville?”
He finishes the bowl quickly, and inhales some treacle tart to distract himself. When that’s done, he goes to the sitting room and turns on the telly. The only things on are reruns of Muggle shows called
By the time they reach the steps they are holding hands again, which must have been the reason for Harry’s neighbour’s question.
Draco sighs and watches as Harry wiggles slightly to pull the jeans up, “I may have bought them because I thought you’d look good in them.”
With that George gets up from the table and starts making his way up the stairs towards Ginny’s room. Harry hears Ginny’s door open, low voices and then the snick of it being shut again. There’s silence in the kitchen.
“Thank you.” He murmurs into the soft hair at the base of Draco’s neck.
“Not everyone gets off on being insulted, Potter.” Draco snaps, his eyes flashing before looking down at hands.
Harry takes a breath, waiting, but the moment is ruined when Teddy lets out an ungodly screech and flails his fist hitting them both in the face.
“Ya, but can you blame them?” Ron asks.
Andromeda eyes the hand twisted in Harry’s sleeve before saying, “A friend?”
“God, why did this take so long?” Malfoy groans.
Draco’s eyes meet Harry’s, and Harry can see the relief at being distracted evident in the slouch of his shoulders and thumb brushing along the back of Harry’s hand.
Draco snorts and looks down the street, “I would have thought it beyond your brainpower to make those sort of mental strides Potter.”
“Potter, this is a friend of my fathers, Mr. Sallow. He’s known my family for some time.”
Another silent and stiff moment passes before Narcissa finally looks over to her son, “Well let’s sit down, I’ll have Tilly bring us some tea and sandwiches.”
Draco cuts him off again. “Potter what do you want? I called you last night, and I appreciate all you did, but you can leave now. We aren’t super good friends or anything.”
Blaise knew, of course he did. He said one night around Christmas, when Crabbe and Goyle were asleep, that he knew.
The Weasley household is already full and busy by the time that Draco, Harry and Teddy arrive. Andromeda was supposed to have come, but when Harry and Draco had apparated in she’d asked if they just wanted to take Teddy so that she could go out with some friends.
As the boys swing the door to the outside open, they’re met with a crowd of witches and wizards. Most of them journalists, but some just random people. Harry wonders if the crowd is interfering with Starbucks business, as they’re standing directly in front of the entrance. He tightens his grip on Draco’s hand and casts his eyes downward, ignoring the questions being called out and flashes from the cameras.
Harry looks up briefly but quickly goes back to spooning food into Teddy’s mouth, “You didn’t have to get up, love.”
* * *
Harry stands for a little moment longer with his arms around Draco before pressing a kiss to his shoulder and stepping back.
Soon after Harry starts watching Malfoy, Malfoy notices that Harry is watching him and silently sneers and leans over to whisper to Harry, “Potter, I’m only going to help you if you actually try and take notes.”
“If your basis for not being nervous around me is that I’ve known you for so long, just know that I hated you for seven years and you won be over in the span of a few weeks.”
Harry raises a hand to cut her off, “Lose the attitude, McElroy. The best way to figure out how we work as a team is to play a game as a team. The Slytherins are here and would also benefit from this as they have a whole new team as well. So get in the air, I don’t want to hear anymore complaints.”
“I’m in love with you.”
Harry goes into the bathroom for a couple minutes to change into his pajamas, his sleep trousers covered in little snitches that Mrs. Weasley got him for last Christmas. When he leaves the bathroom it’s to find Malfoy crawling into bed wearing a grey hoodie, a pair of old sweat pants, and to Harry’s surprise and horror, a monstrous pair of fuzzy green socks.
“I think that’s the worst part.” Draco says, pulling back and looking like he’s about to laugh.
“Better than expected, love.” Harry says, absently squeezing Draco’s hand and making to walk towards the next stop.
Ron starts forward in Malfoy and Harry’s direction, his fists balled at his sides in a way that Harry know’s means he is barely controlling himself. Hermione tries to block his path but Ron shoulders past her. Without realizing it, Harry shoves Malfoy away.
He’s cut off once again by a hand gesture from Hermione.
The three of them quickly make their way to the dining hall, and Harry’s heart soars at having his two best friends at his side.
Without waiting for a response, he takes the last few steps needed to sit beside Draco. Their thighs are pressed together and Harry casually leans closer to him so that they’re touching ankle to shoulder, his one arm draped along the back of the bench. Draco glances at him quickly but doesn’t say anything, still focused on getting food into an overtired Teddy.
Another peek into Draco's head!
“And he’s cool with it?” Harry responds, confusion dripping from his voice
“Mhmm,” Harry says, tilting his head back to laugh and look at Draco, “I almost believe you, but as you’re sitting directly in my lap I can’t take you seriously. Put on the socks, love.”
“Please try to play nice Ron, for me?”
Though it appears his silence isn’t very comforting for Malfoy, “You know what never mind it was a dumb idea forget I said-”
“Draco.” He all but whispers, “I’m dating Draco.”
“I hate potions Malfoy.”
Ron appears in the doorway and grins at Harry clapping him on the shoulder. He glances in Malfoy’s direction and manages to keep any disgust from showing on his face, though it’s a close call.
Malfoy’s howling by this point.
Malfoy doesn’t do this, instead he takes another bite of his sandwich and looks at Harry expectantly.
Even though they don’t play well, they play better than expected. There are only a few times where the teams have to be spelled apart by Malfoy or Harry, and by the end, both teams are laughing and seem to be having a good time.
Harry is desperately grateful for Ron’s presence at his side. He’d texted him a quick, “I’m about to tell your family about Draco and I.” And Ron had responded instantly with “On my way. Wait for me.”
Harry smiles at the sight, normally Malfoy drooling on anybody would be fuel for weeks of teasing, but all Harry feels is a small warmth growing in his chest.
“Why?” Neville asks looking lost, “Why would you date that arsehole? Of all the people you could have had- you were literally dating Ginny! Why him?”
“What was that for.” Draco says, a little breathless.
Harry shrugs and says, “Honestly, I’ve never thought about it before… it certainly felt safe at the time.”
With this in mind, Harry twists his hand together with Draco’s and they take a cab to a nearby diner that claims to have the ‘best breakfast in all of London.’
“Of course we deny it Ginny!” Harry says, sounding a bit shocked and exasperated, “It’s a load of bollocks, anyone with half a brain can see that.”
“Why don’t you grab us a seat and I’ll get us some breakfast and that drink full of sugary foam shit you like.” Harry motions for Malfoy to grab them chairs by the fire.
It slows though when he hears a familiar voice call out, “Scarhead we’re over here.” From the direction of the Gryffindor table.
Draco had a panic attack, Blaise held him.
The silence on the other end at those words appears incredibly tense, and that’s when Harry realizes his misstep.
“Hi Luna,” Harry starts, trying to calm his still racing heart and heavy breaths, “Could I come talk to you tomorrow?”
While he’s contemplating this, Kreacher wanders back into the living area and informs Harry that dinner is ready.
He can do this. It’s one night, and everyone is going to be focused on Harry anyways. He’ll be an afterthought. Besides, Granger will be there and will likely talk to him all night about her charms classes. Everything will be fine.
Harry snorts, “I don’t think so Draco. Teddy’s barely eating solid food, I doubt he could handle a sherbert lemon.”
“What is it, Gin?” Harry says finally, scrubbing his face over with his one hand while the other holds onto the wall for support.
Malfoy seems to deflate at those words so Harry tries again.
After that Molly, steps around the two boys and heads towards the kitchen. Harry turns to Draco, smiling slightly, “What did she say to you?”
“I have to at least talk to Ginny first.” Harry says somewhat desperately, he stands up and holds his hand out to Draco, “Come with me?”
Malfoy is leaning against the door frame between the kitchen and living room when he says, “Would you stop being so fucking cryptic? What did she say? Was it something about my family, or the classes we’re taking-”
After dinner, they make their way back to the room. Slowly meandering through the halls, holding hands and talking in low voices, Harry realizes that he feels much better.
“So what? You know him better than Ron and I now?” Hermione says, a mean tint entering her voice.
“Thank you.” Harry says, “You didn’t have to do this.”
The rest of the day proceeds in much the same way. Malfoy brings Harry to some area on or around Hogwarts’ grounds and Harry faces the grief and memories that come with it, but ends up laughing with Malfoy in the end. They go into all the shops in Hogsmeade and stop at the Three Broomsticks for lunch before heading to the grounds and castle. Whenever they go into a shop Harry notices that Malfoy keeps his head down and only speak when Harry prompts him to. He can’t believe the change in behaviour, comparing what Malfoy is now to the swaggering, loud boy he had been not too many years ago. Harry knows that only the treatment of others could have wrought the change in behaviour, and Harry is filled with anger for a moment as well as understanding. After all, he does the exact same thing when entering a wizard filled area. Head and eyes down, only speak when spoken to. It’s how he survives.
Malfoy makes a choking sound and flushes. Harry grins slightly before eating more food.
He can barely stand the close proximity. It’s what made him spell their beds farther apart in the room. Sure, the house elves move it back every day when he and Harry are gone to class, and his resolve weakens every time he has to do it, but do it he will. He’s spent too many nights dreaming about Harry, he really doesn’t need to fuck himself up more by watching him sleep.
“Okay.” Harry says, popping a strawberry into his mouth from off the plate Kreacher made for them an hour ago, before rolling so that Malfoy is on his back and Harry is straddling his waist.
“Well that’s what we were thinking. You haven’t heard anything yet though?”
“Excuse me, Professor, but he really doesn’t want to be an Auror.”
“Harry, you’re one of my best mates. And I want to be happy for you, but I can’t just yet. Malfoy is one of the people who fought for the wrong side, and if less people had done that, Fred would still be here.”
Draco is holding a half gummed banana in his hands and seems to be desperately looking for a place to set it down. Harry laughs and hands him a napkin from the truck and throws it out for him as Draco hoists a fussy Teddy onto his chest. As they turn to find somewhere to sit, a voice cuts through the street reaching Harry’s ears.
Finally, after what seems like ages, Draco sits up and scooches back into his original position of nearly in Harry’s lap and sets a now poorly wrapped present in front of him.
Sorry for the late post today friends! I'm just starting reading week and Brek has a pretty full plate. Hope y'all enjoy this chapter<3
Hermione says this last part lightly, as if trying to prove that Malfoy had changed a great deal.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand once it’s returned to the table, and as Harry leans towards the other boy, his brand new ink peeks out from underneath his sleeve and poorly taped bandage.
“Do you reckon that a pumpkin spice latte tastes anything like pumpkin juice?”
Harry winces and opens his mouth, but Draco cuts him off.
“Don’t be stupid.” Harry says, knowing that what Draco is saying is probably true. “They won’t hate you when they get to know you.”
Oh what a clusterfuck he’s thrown himself into.
His hair is slicked back and he’s wearing dark jeans and a pale blue button down shirt. He eyes the plate of fruit and pops a strawberry in his mouth before looking into the fridge for something else.
“Alright,” Harry says, turning to look at Teddy with his filled bowls, “Let’s give this a shot shall we?”
Malfoy looks at him suspiciously, as if not quite sure why Harry is bothering talking to him, let
“Ya,” says Harry, stalling for time, “I definitely need to see you guys soon. I have Teddy this weekend though so maybe when I get back to Hogwarts?”
Harry starts forward again, and gets a handful of floo powder before Mcgonigall interrupts once again.
When Harry turns to look at Hermione, she appears amused.
“I know.” Hermione says, smiling again, “What did you get for Christmas?”
He’s interrupted again by Percy saying, “Well good chat Harry, I’m going to go see how Mother is doing in the kitchen.”
“Well,” Harry says loudly, Draco’s head shoots up, as do half the customer’s in the bar “Since his dad is locked is Azkaban and been pretty shit to him his whole life, we don’t really care what good ol’ Lucius has to say.”
Malfoy turns his head and presses a kiss to Harry’s wrist before crossing his arms over Harry’s chest and turning to rest his chin on them. “Andromeda has never met me before, and I fought for the side that left her husband and daughter-less.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “You’re so over dramatic, you weren’t drinking at Hogwarts when you were dealing with us.” and then adds, “Are we walking, or apparating.”
There’s a beat of silence before both Ron and Hermione start talking at once.
“So the Quibbler?”
Harry thinks for a moment before grabbing a spare bit of parchment and quill from his bag and scrawling out a response that he’d love to watch Teddy, and would it be okay if the babysitting happened at his apartment. He asks a nearby person to borrow the school owl that had just dropped off the mail and then sends it on it’s way.
Draco’s heart beats a little faster at the smirk playing around Harry’s mouth, but refuses to let it show on his face.
Harry just rolls his eyes before saying, “With my track record you honestly thought I could do something on my own?”
Harry relaxes back into the couch and pulls Draco somewhat closer. Ron finally finds a seat next to Harry, and sits down with a sigh.
“Harry, I said a snog after dinner. Get dressed.”
If anything the display in the cupboard only proves that Malfoy is interested in the pure physicality of the relationship, after all, they were currently sleeping in separate beds. If Malfoy wanted anything romantic, surely he would have crawled into bed with Harry by now, not to recreate their aggressive making out in the broom cupboard, but for something softer.
“Well I’m worrying anyways, tell me.” Harry says irritably, he moves to put his hand over Malfoy's but thinks better of it when he remembers how many eyes there are in the hall.
Neville’s eyes dart over to Draco quickly and then back to Harry, and Harry knows he’s asking if Harry needs a quick rescue. Harry swallows, and knowing he’s going to have to explain himself a little, steps to be beside Draco and twists their hands together.
“Just trust me love, it’ll be fine.”
Smiling Harry says, “Ya ya, you’re evil and all that, get up and we can get breakfast at Hogwarts.”
“Oh it happened.” Malfoy assures, “You can pretend it was sleep talk but I know what really happened.”
With that Hermione turns on her heel and heads towards Mcgonagall’s office, ignoring Harry’s shouts asking her what he was supposed to figure out on his own. Frustrated, Harry takes out his phone, which somehow is still working, and calls Malfoy.
“I was thinking more quidditch and the feasts, but sure, we can pretend I was thinking about the study benefits too.”
“We know that, Harry.” Hermione says softly, her eyes sad as they focus on a still silent Draco. “But I don’t think everyone will believe that.”
“You can borrow something of mine.”
Malfoy flushes, and begins packing up his books. “Fine Potter. If you’re struggling to focus there’s no point in me lecturing you. Let’s meet Granger for dinner.”
Harry shrugs and turns his head to press his lips to Draco’s hair. It’s softness that they don’t normally do in front of an audience. But Harry is upset, and can tell that Draco needs this too.
Harry lands with much less grace and falls on his arse, then he attempts to stand up and trips on the corner of the comforter sticking out off the bed. Finally, he pulls himself up to sit beside Draco on the bed.
There’s silence again and Draco leans his head against Harry’s shoulder. As much a comforting weight as it is a way for Draco to take comfort himself. Harry watches Ron track the movement of Draco’s head, before flitting his eyes back to meet Harry’s.
He waits a beat, clearly listening to whatever the person on the other end of the line is saying.
Draco’s heart flutters at the sight, and he takes the few steps needed to twist his hand together with Harry’s and tucks himself, as subtly as possible, into Harry’s side.
Without waiting for a response Harry turns on his heel, and before he knows it, is staring down the lane way at the crooked old house he knows and loves.
“So that’s all this is,” questions Hermione, “You defending a friend?”
He cracks his one eye open to see if Draco is still in bed. The boy in question is indeed still there, blankets piled high enough that Harry can barely make out his messy hair on the pillows. Harry looks away for a moment, considering closing the blinds, when his eyes catch on something outside the window.
“That is what my life is like Ron. Pretty much every single person in my life thinks I’m going to break, and I happened to run into Malfoy on a day where I was pretty sure I was broken. Malfoy didn’t act like I was though.”
Malfoy laughs weakly and says, “I’m in the middle of a panic attack and it only gets worse when I’m alone.”
He tries to slow his racing heart and stop thinking of the sensation of Malfoy’s hand on his leg. “Fuck. I’m in trouble.”
The silence that follows from Hermione is as good as a confession, Harry tries to soften the blow, who knows how Ron might react with Malfoy of all people sharing classes with his girlfriend, let alone projects.
Harry ends up on the fire escape by the window of the bathroom of the flat above the Starbucks. Harry peers in, wand out, and sees Malfoy lying huddled on the floor, his back up against the bathtub. Harry knocks lightly on the window and Malfoy’s head shoots up and his wand hand raises. Seeing that it’s Harry he lowers his head and closes his eyes, but waves his hand in a way that encourages Harry to enter through the window.
“Let him. It’s not like when Lucius gets out Draco and I won’t be together and in love anymore. I plan on loving Draco for a long time, and if Lucius needs to process that, I’m sure he has nothing but time to contemplate it in Azkaban.”
They step into a small candy shop and Harry looks for different sweets than the usual for his friends.
“Alright Malfoy,” Harry says walking backwards with his hands raised, “You may be right. What about a scrimmage?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes again but seems pleased when Kreacher appears with a tray of food for them to share. His eyes shine when he spots the chocolate mousse waiting on the platter and Harry makes a mental note for when he will inevitably have to buy Malfoy groceries. He decides that he’ll introduce him to the wonder that is pudding snack packs.
“You heard her Weasley, I haven’t harmed a hair on your girlfriend's head.” He stands up beside Harry, his hand still twisted in Harry’s robe. “I’d appreciate you lowering your wand, not that you’d be able to hit me even if you tried.”
Draco cracks one eye open and immediately closes it against the brightness from outside.
After hearing what had happened to Ginny he expected her to be bedridden, and thin. Or at least as thin as she was when they broke up. Instead, she’s standing before him looking healthy with a shadow of her old steely glint in her eyes.
Draco is losing his mind.
They walk to the shop hand in hand, hair still wet from the shower and wearing relaxed but nice clothes. Harry has a beanie pulled over most of his hair. Draco is wearing one as well, but Harry suspects that Draco looks considerably better in it. He finds he doesn’t mind too much, just tightens his grip on Draco’s hand when he catches some guy on a smoke break looking too long in the other boy’s direction.
Harry presses the base of his hands to his eyes and black dots swam into his vision. He attempts to focus on his breathing, and most importantly slowing it down. It could have been minutes or hours or days, but gradually Harry feels his heart beat slow and his breathing even out.
“What was that for?” Harry asks breathlessly, transferring Teddy to his hip.
After the’ve both showered (separately, Harry blushes at the mere thought of that) the two boys make their way down the familiar path down the street. After he convinces Malfoy to get out of bed, he promises him a good breakfast. And since Harry isn’t exactly a tour guide of muggle London, he settles on taking Malfoy to Starbucks, the only place he knows really.
Harry snorts at the use of the word nemesis but lets it slide.
“Master Potter, tis good to see you sir.”
Harry shakes his head, but smiles as he turns back to Marissa, and grabs the drinks from her hands.
“So you and lover boy are still together then?” She asks, grinning pointedly in Draco’s direction.
Harry things for a moment and adjusts a now sleeping Teddy into a more comfortable position. He finally decides that even though it would be faster, the fuss Teddy kicks up afterwards really isn’t worth it.
“Hey Hermi-” Harry is cut off by the force of her hug.
“Actually Mrs. Weasley,” Harry says stepping into the house and closing the door. “I was wondering if Ginny’s home?”
He hadn’t expected such a filling meal on such short notice. The word dessert makes Harry’s heart beat faster as he remembers the conversation with Hermione, and who it was about. But,  he forces himself to calm down and eat some soup, ignoring all thoughts of chocolate mousse staining Malfoy’s lips.
“I wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t.”
“Fuck that Malfoy, let’s go to Starbucks and get tea and sandwiches.”
“What’s the sigh for Malfoy?” Harry asks.
The next day passes in a blur. One moment they’re having breakfast, the next they’re packing their bags and pulling on some muggle clothes, Malfoy looks dashing in dark wash skinny jeans. They use the floo network in Mcgonagall’s office to get to Andromeda's house.
Draco had almost cried. Instead he had said, “Please don’t tell anyone Blaise, I’ll do anything.”
Weeks pass. The school gets used to Harry’s presence like they always do, the awe eventually fading away to normalcy. Harry drops out of the History of Magic class after begging Mcgonagall to let him, and spends that free period helping Madam Hooch coach flying lessons.
Harry nods and rubs his unoccupied hand across his face. Teddy wakes suddenly and his hair changes from brown to a pale pale blonde.
Harry laughs helplessly, and feels Draco’s hand twist in the jumper he’s wearing, “I don’t know Ron. There isn’t much we can do is there?”
As he sat on the couch, Draco cracked one eye open and leaned into Harry’s side when he sat down.
Harry just shakes his head no and slowly stands up to follow the pair into the kitchen.
“If you’re talking about Hermione and Ron I’m assuming so, if you’re talking about Ron and I, well let’s just say that Ron really isn’t my type, too much like a brother.”
Harry looks at Malfoy in confusion.
“Why’d you get so weird when Christine was asking about us?”
He’s gnawing on some sort of biscuit, his eyes and hair eerily matching Draco’s perfectly. He babbles away, Harry catching a few words here and there but not completely understanding. Hermione laughs when she sees him talking to Teddy as if they’re having a full blown conversation and holds her arms out for the squirming toddler.
“We could.” Harry says, rubbing comforting circles on Draco’s back under the leather jacket. “We’d just have to put up some extra spells.”
“That’ll be good.” Hermione says seemingly content to talk about Hogwarts itself. “Give you lots of opportunities to use the library and everything.”
“What? What does it matter? It looks good on you.” Harry says, clearly confused by Draco’s panic, bringing a hand up to brush Draco’s hair to the side, “What’s wrong Draco? Talk to me.”
“Seriously Potter, I’m growing concerned that perhaps Hogwarts really isn’t the best place for you? If the sight of a run down shack sends you this far into a spiral of grief, how will you handle Hagrid’s hut?”
“I know.” Harry says, pressing a kiss to the shell of Draco’s ear.
Harry shakes his head and grabs Draco’s hand, squeezing gently, “Of course I’m coming. There was never a question.”
She says it’s pointless for her to stay in the dormitories alone, but Harry knows it’s because she’s worried about Ron and him. Either way he’s grateful. Hermione is such a permanent fixture in his day to day life that having to go months without seeing her would have been incredibly difficult. He knows Ron feels the same, probably even more so. As he enters the kitchen, Hermione’s back is to him so he clears his throat and greets her so that she can hear him over the noise of the cooking food, and the fan over the stove.
“Yes Mr. Malfoy, I suppose that is all, you may go and I’ll send one of the house elves to show you to your room at the end of the day.”
“Madam Pince has always hated me and I just don’t get why. Ya sure, I admit I’ve snuck in and stolen books from the library once or twice, but honestly who hasn’t?”
This thing with Malfoy has introduced a whole load of foreign feelings into Harry’s life. He’d liked Cho and her calm affection. He’d even loved Ginny and the familiarity he felt from being around her, but he thinks that Hermione may have been right about him not loving either of them enough.
With Draco pulled close like this, one of his hands clutching on Harry’s jacket, Harry almost thinks the rain is worth it.
Harry rolls his eyes before handing Malfoy his coat off the back of a chair.
“I can take the couch.” Draco says, gesturing with his thumb to the living room.
A cheer goes up in the crowd and before Harry knows it, he and Draco are shouting the numbers down from ten. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, George and a few others find them on the floor and link arms with each other.
Beneath this paragraph is a moving photo taken from outside one of the shops they had gone to last night. They’ve caught the picture in such a way that Harry is whispering something into Draco’s ear, already smiling, lips moving wordlessly along Draco’s neck and Draco’s face appears completely blank up until Harry pulls back to look at him, and then a smirk that other people would interpret as smug, but Harry knows is actually laughing at their private joke flits across his face.
Last chapters comments blew us away! Thank you so much for the love<3
The waitress brings him and Malfoy their butter beers and a basket of chips. They didn’t order chips but the waitress claims it’s protocol for the ‘savior of the wizarding world’.
Harry turns and looks at Draco consideringly, “Those are comfortable?”
She immediately proves him right and starts talking about her charms essays that she still has to mark, and how much she wishes that she had her own teaching assistant. This makes Draco laugh and say, “Granger, I don’t think it’s typical for assistants to get assistants.”
“Anyways, I left the manor at night when no one would be looking for me and went about looking for wizard flats. No one wanted to rent to me because of who I am so I ended up here.”
Draco’s cheeks flush. Harry doesn’t notice.
“That went better than I expected honestly.” Ron says.
Harry wakes up the next morning to an empty bed. He slides his hand across the place that Malfoy had been last night and finds it cold. Confused, he sits up listening for either noises from Malfoy or from Teddy. He hears nothing, so he gets up to go and investigate.
“This is more than enough, Draco.” Harry says, watching exasperatedly as Draco scrambles out from under the blanket and crosses the room to the wardrobe.
“You’ll think of something.” Draco responds, smiling slightly as he steals a strawberry off Harry’s plate.
“I think it’s unrealistic for you guys to like me. If I were in your shoes I wouldn’t.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco whispers into the hair above Harry’s ear.
Malfoy has removed the spell between them, and has crossed the kitchen towards Harry. His hand reaches for Harry’s robe, and Harry allows himself to be pulled in closer to Malfoy.
Malfoy accommodates this new arrangement with minimal complaining, “He’s the best baby I’ve ever met.”
Malfoy sneers, “So all is well with the happy couple?”
Malfoy breathes in shakily before responding. “Yes, but she cancelled and majority of the people who I used to consider friends can’t stand me. You were one of the only options available in town.”
“Who else?”
“Have you ever worn these? I can’t for the life of me picture you in either of these clothes.”
Draco is silent, and before he can think of a response Blaise says softly, “I’ve got to go, I have work in the morning. I’m sure you’ll be fine.”
Malfoy gentures vaguely to the tables full of students who are chattering away, oblivious to the two boys arguments.
On the train he leans his head against Draco’s arm and holds Teddy close to his chest. He doesn't want to sleep, not with his mind still occupied with the nightmare, but can rest easy with the constant motion of the train and Draco’s even voice reading to Teddy. He closes his eyes.
“Listen to me,” he whispers, stepping closer. “This is something that is going to be incredibly difficult, but it is also something that you need to do. Those people didn’t die for you. They died to kill the Dark Lord. And if you think about it, plenty of good things have happened in this courtyard.”
Harry closes his eyes after seeing it’s just Malfoy, but they shoot back open when Malfoy’s hand rests on his head and smooths down his hair.
He cleans Teddy quickly and wraps him in his baby towel, the little chicken hood pulled over his head. He dresses Teddy in a little pair of jeans and a sweater with the word “Ninja” stamped across the front. Teddy starts to fuss so Harry grabs the bottle off the counter and hands it to him while he sits on the blanket with his toys.
Laughing, Harry plants a kiss on Draco’s cheek before throwing the covers off and getting out of bed. Draco hesitates for only another second before getting out of bed and following Harry into the kitchen.
Draco sighs dramatically, and Harry leans in closer. “Of course Weasley would think that, it’s just because his team is awful-”
Draco returns with a pure white envelope but just as he stretches out his hand to give it to harry, he pulls back. “I have to say something before you open this one.”
Malfoy looks shocked for a mere second, before seemingly realizing that Harry is trying to cover up the reason for their exchange.
“Mm’ not.”
Harry swallows, “I was thinking about it, and especially after last night I was thinking about it a little bit more. I don’t know enough about how the mind works to figure out how to stop these nightmares on my own. Potions and spells haven't worked so far so I’m kind of out of options.”
Harry considers for a moment before saying,
Harry waits for him before turning and walking towards the stands and sitting down. Malfoy sits on his left and brings out a pad of paper to take notes on. After a moment Harry grabs his own and watches his team.
*  *  *
Malfoy jumps slightly but turns to look at Harry calmly. “Do you want me in here with you?” It feels like this simple question holds a lot of weight.
Harry nods and waits patiently while Draco pulls his fingers through his hair.
They sit in silence for a moment until the shaking and quick breaths next to him become unbearable.
“Well you know dear, I saw Mr. Malfoy here coming in and he’s been so elusive and not around his estate and I just wanted to see if he wanted to have a quick chat.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes, but good naturedly shrugs on his coat and gestures for Harry to lead the way.
Harry can’t help but feel like this first gift exchange is vital to the success of their relationship. When he had said as much to Ron, Ron had scoffed, rolled his eyes and called Harry a giant twat. But he had taken gift shopping more seriously after that.
“I don’t want to go, but the idea of not being with you for it is almost unbearable. So I’m going. I might complain for a generous amount of time, drink heavily, and cling to you for most of the night, but I’m coming with you.”
Draco nods and gently squeezes Harry’s hand, leading him towards a sitting area that Harry had never been in before. Harry listens as Narcissa talks to Draco, and Harry can’t help but notice that although Draco is talking and engaging far more than he did with Harry’s family, he’s also not the same Draco that Harry knows intimately.
*  *  *
“You’re ridiculous.” Malfoy mutters before finally turning back to the barista and placing his order.
Draco stays asleep, though he mumbles something incoherent when Harry wraps his arms around him. Harry smiles softly, and runs his thumb along the stretch of bare skin on Draco’s side where his shirt has rucked up.
Ron seems to be finished speaking and looks around the table. Harry isn’t sure he feels safe looking at anyone else so decides to look at his hands folded in his lap. They’re shaking. But when he hears Molly speak he can’t stop his head from jerking up.
“No Malfoy, I’m not setting foot in that place. Madam Puddifoot probably still remembers me as that awful bloke who made his date scream at him on Valentine’s day.”
Draco is sitting on Harry’s tiny couch with Teddy clutched to his chest. Both their eyes are closed and Teddy has his tiny fingers curled into the large D that is knitted onto Malfoy’s brand new Weasley jumper.
Harry shrugs noncommittally and mumbles a quick, “Later.” out of the corner of his mouth.
Ginny nods once, and adjusts her bag on her shoulder, clearly wanting to say something else. Harry waits her out, good at this now from interacting with Draco so much.
Harry lies still with his eyes closed, and contemplates moving into bed with Draco. He’s gotten used to sharing a bed and having the other boy tucked into his side. Morning breath and bedhead, stupid socked feet tucked underneath his legs.
Harry nods in perfect understanding before saying, “How could you go back to Hogwarts?”
“Teddy is not useless.” Harry says, smiling slightly as he wraps an arm around Draco’s waist, “He’s a baby.”
There’s silence for a moment and Harry relishes in the fact that he can say these things and Draco will keep holding him.
“She is here dear,” She says slowly, “But I’m not sure if she’s ready for visitors.”
“Ron, seriously, lower your wand.”
Harry feels an urge to hug Malfoy but hesitates. Instead he scoots closer into Malfoy’s space, their thighs pressed together.
Harry lets himself be distracted by Draco gingerly handing Teddy over to Luna and Luna starting a quiet conversation with Draco. Sadly this distraction can’t hold as Neville wants answers.
As Marissa waits for him to find his debit card, her eyes drift over in Malfoy’s direction.
“I’m so glad you could be here today Harry, and you too Draco. I know it wasn’t a very warm welcome last time you were here, but you matter to Harry so you’re going to matter to us too.”
Draco shoots him another look and squeezes his hand in warning. He then begins talking.
It takes a moment for Ginny’s words to make their way through the alcoholic haze in Harry’s brain, but when they do he can’t stop the smile spreading across his face.
“Yesterday was really hard for him, it was hard for all of them.” Hermione says, smiling slightly as Teddy toddles over in her direction and reaches his arms up to be picked up by her. “It was good that we were all together though. It would have been nice for you to be there too.”
What feels like hours later, but in reality is probably only about twenty minutes. Malfoy emerges from the bathroom fully dressed and ready to go.
“Noted.” Harry says, taking the now empty mug from Draco and putting it in the sink.
“I get enough of that from the press,” Harry murmurs, “I don’t need it from you too.”
But Draco is still holding his hand. And that has to count for something.
There’s silence on the other end of the line for a moment before Hermione says, “Harry, you know full well Luna would never tell anyone what you tell her, and she did receive training on counselling and dealing with PTSD, magical or otherwise.”
Harry grins at that and turns back to his food. And if he grins the whole way down to the pitch, well, Malfoy doesn’t give him a hard time about it.
“Aim for the apartment above the Starbucks, I'll adjust the wards to let you in.”
and many others blurred together in Harry’s mind until all that he could hear was white noise.
“Harry, you just called me Harry, for the first time like… ever.” He can tell he’s smiling, a great big shit eating grin that he can’t seem to get rid of.
“You are in no state to work this afternoon.” Draco says, tossing the essay carelessly onto a nearby chair.
“No,” Harry says, looking at Draco’s face he realizes that he knows what he wants, “I think I’ve got this, but you can’t look until it’s done.”
Harry rereads that last letter and glances over at a still sleeping Draco. He taps the letter absently against his leg before setting it down for consideration later. He turns his attention back to the two unopened letters. Harry hovers over them both, not sure what they contain and hoping that they’re both supportive.
Harry laughs at the confused half-awake look in Malfoy’s eyes before answering.
Harry’s heart seems to stop in his chest.
Draco looks into Harry’s eyes for another second before stepping close and using his extra height to brush a kiss across Harry’s forehead, stilling over Harry’s old scar. Against it, he mumbles, “I’ll think about it.”
“Harry. Mate. No.” Ron says, cracking up, “Bloody hell, next time I see you I’m forcing you to go through all my memories of the sexual tension and innuendos we had to endure this year in the pensieve. You’ll see just how ridiculous you two were.”
Mcgonagall looks surprised to see them.
There’s silence for a moment, and Harry feels as if something monumental is happening.
By the end of the day there is a pile of muddy Gryffindors who Harry is pleased with, and enough Slytherins that Malfoy says, “Will do.”
He’s stopped in his tracks when Draco stops and pulls Harry’s arm so that he’s facing him. “What did you just call me?”
He glances at Ron before leaning over and whispering, “I’ve got to go.”
Laughing Harry grabs Malfoy’s arm and pulls him down to the bench. Malfoy tumbles into Harry’s side before ripping his arm away and righting himself.
It’s too early for this, Harry needs caffeine.
Harry laughs, “Okay, well when one of us proposes, I’ll start in on the guest list.” After a moment he adds, “Though I do think you’d have to attend some other major events, say a reunion, before a proposal is on the line.”
Draco wants a time turner so that he can go back to his fourteen year old self and explain to him that all his feelings were valid. That eventually he would end up with Potter, who somehow doesn’t mind his snark and stupid drink orders.
Harry feigns thinking about this question before finally saying, “Now? I was just gonna apparate from the shop I’m in.”
Harry takes a moment to think, and doesn’t look at Neville for a moment, too focused on looking at Draco and wondering what it is about him that’s different.
“I just, I don’t,” Harry leans in closer to Malfoy, “I’m almost one hundred percent sure that I’m not gay, but I do really want to kiss you so I need to figure out what that means for me.”
But even amongst this dread and confusion Draco allows himself a moment of hope.
“It wasn’t about Teddy.” Malfoy says swiftly moving to unlock the door again.
It’s starting to snow, and Harry is all at once grateful for the coat Draco leant him. It’s sleeves are a bit long but that’s all the better to cover his hands with.
“I called Ron before calling you, and he sent me to voicemail, any reason why?”
Malfoy looks blank for a second before straightening and saying, “Granger punched me in the face when I was being a giant twat over there.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes and swallows, “I don’t like eggs Potter, is that a problem?”
When Harry finally does break the kiss, he takes a deep breath and presses his forehead to Malfoy’s, eyes still closed.
“Do you want to go to Hogwarts is the real question here, Potter.” Malfoy responds neatly sidestepping Harry’s question.
“I’m pretty sure you’ll need a permit for that.” Draco mutters, looking at the ground.
Apparating directly into his flat is impossible with the spells and wards that he had set up, so Harry lands right outside his front door and hopes that he hasn’t caught the attention of any muggles.
“Yes of course Master Harry.”
Hermione nods from where she is now kneeling beside an unfrozen and glaring Ron.
With that being said Harry definitely notices heads craning in his and Malfoy’s direction. He subconsciously shifts closer to Malfoy in an attempt to shield him from the various stares and sneers. Malfoy looks at Harry in some confusion as their thighs press together but doesn't make a move to shift away. Out of nowhere a shout cuts across the hall.
“Bloody hell, Ron.” Harry groans, “Can we please not make a big deal of this?” Harry feels his cheeks heating slightly.
“Alright, thank you Professor, we’ll think about it.”
“So we wouldn’t stay in the dormitories?”
“Draco,” he says slowly, carefully putting his one hand on Draco’s side and the other one cupping his face, “Who-”
“Nice to meet you. I guess.” Harry says, not risking standing up, but holding his hand out to the man regardless.
Harry is speechless, left awestruck by the utter compassion Malfoy has been hiding for so long.
“Can I wear this?” Harry asks, stepping back into Draco’s space.
“Oh.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “You really don’t pay attention to wizard news do you?”
Harry snorts but wraps his free arm around a shivering Draco’s waist. “I’m sure you’ll survive, let’s just go home.”
“Just okay. I’m saying yes. I don’t know to which plan, but it’s a yes. Now let's get thoroughly sloshed so I don’t remember this dreadful night full of Gryffindor’s for longer than I have to.”
Gratefully, Ron and Harry fall over themselves helping Hermione set the table for the three of them. They talk for awhile about a lot of things, all of them far far away from Ginny. A couple hours in, they’re feeling much better and sitting in the living room when Harry’s phone rings.
This time it’s Malfoy who pulls back “What the bloody hell are you talking about?” He has an incredulous look on his face, eyebrows drawn together, nose scrunched up.
Pulling back Ron says, “I’m not saying I’ll ever like Malfoy, but if you say he’s changed or whatever I guess I can ignore him for now.”
“I have a few ideas.” Draco says, standing in front of Harry and holding out both hands for him to grab onto.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Watch it Malfoy, or I’ll knock you off that broom.”
Harry’s heart drops to somewhere near his stomach, “Just ones from our dinner last night probably, right?”
This garners a snort from Draco, and Harry smiles in response before saying, “Ready?”
Without a word Draco kisses him again, and then just as suddenly, they’re apparating.
Even though the Starbucks is directly below Malfoy’s apartment, Harry is glad to enter the warm interior. Rubbing his hands together for warmth, he looks at the sandwich selection in the display case, as well as the drink menu. Malfoy sidles up beside him.
Draco also clearly likes this poem and has highlighted a few of his favorite verses. Harry pays more attention to those, his eyes catching on one that simply says “Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song.” Harry isn’t sure of the context, but likes it anyways. He supposes that the Thames would keep flowing forever. History would not change that, and nothing as silly as a war fought by humans could deter the river from doing what it is meant to do.
Harry brings himself over to the bar and passes his glass to Tom for a refill. As he waits for his drink he glances across the room and, shockingly, sees Malfoy huddled in a circle with a couple of girls.
“Mate you’re leaving me alone in Auror training?”
Not Kreacher then. But that doesn’t make sense, the only two people who should be able to get inside his wards are himself and Kreacher.
Once again, your guys's support is amazing! We never thought we'd get this many comments or kudos, so thank you for supporting us and our little story. Hope you enjoy this chapter<3
Harry sighs again, but takes Draco’s offered hands and stands up. “I really just want to go to bed Draco.”
“Ah Mr. Potter, Draco. Fancy seeing you here.”
“Who cares about that?” Draco says, pulling Harry back over to the bed, “I didn’t need both of your friends knowing that we rip our clothes off like madmen before going to bed.”
“A few more hours, Draco. You can do this.” Harry says instead, pressing a kiss to the side of Draco’s head before stepping back.
“I’ve been looking for you all morning, and when I didn’t see you at the Gryffindor table I assumed you had decided not to come after all. But, then I heard some fourth years gossiping about how you were sitting at the Slytherin table and decided to check it out. Why are you sitting here?”
Harry leans back to see Malfoy’s face and notices that a faint flush has appeared on Malfoy’s cheekbones. It makes Harry happy to know how easy it is to annoy Malfoy. Malfoy shakes his head slightly and turns back to the front of the classroom without responding. Disappointed that Malfoy has gone back to focusing Harry resorts to staring out the window and desperately waiting for the double history period to end.
“You keep expecting people to be okay with being around me just because you say so. Your Chosen One Personality is making an appearance. And I say that with great affection.” Malfoy pauses to pat Harry’s thigh kindly before continuing with, “But I hate to break it to you, not everyone is going to listen to you just because you’re Harry Potter.”
Hermione cuts him off straight away. “You loved her Harry, I don’t deny that. I’m just not sure you loved her like this. All consuming.”
Suddenly there’s a nudge at his ankle. He startles awake, lashing out but not hitting anyone. He looks up to see Harry standing in front of him in his stupid too short snitch covered pajamas.
“Your kindness knows no bounds.” Harry mutters, fishing out some money for her.
He pushes his hands into Malfoy’s hair like he wanted to do this morning and is pleased when Malfoy sighs happily into his mouth.
“You don’t have to come if you don’t want to, Harry.” Draco says, kicking a pile of snow and not looking at him.
The room is quiet, but then Ron breaks the silence.
“Have some eggs Malfoy.”
At those words a faint flush appears on Draco’s cheekbones. Harry is once again curious about how long they were both hiding ginormous feelings behind sneers and teasing.
Harry looks at Draco quickly and without asking, apparates them out of the hospital and into the Leaky Cauldron.
“James McClaren?” Harry asks.
He hears Blaise’s voice in his head asking him what he’s waiting for, and he takes Harry’s hand.
“God, you’re such an emotionally stunted 𝘣𝘰𝘺 Potter!” Malfoy scoffs before adding, “You had a good time? Just say if you want this to be a thing or not.”
Draco just shakes his head and offers no other explanation, following Harry as he leads them down random streets in the hopes of finding a restaurant that serves plain pasta for Teddy to eat.
His mind is begging him to lean forward just a little, maybe see what happens. But he isn’t that self destructive and pulls back.
