Harry gave Malfoy’s shoulder another gentle rub with his thumb, and was rewarded with another squeeze to his knee. Malfoy didn’t miss a beat in his conversation with Ron, carrying on as if cozying up to Harry like this was nothing out of the ordinary, and Harry let himself get swept away in a series of
When it’s over, he feels wrung-out, limp and loose and oddly empty. He sags forward, bearing Malfoy down to the bed with him, and it’s a few moments before he gets off him, flops onto his side. Malfoy whimpers as Harry slips out. Harry thinks he should probably say something, do something. But the silence is palpable, how it stretches between them, punctuated only by their breathing.
“Yeah, right, of course,” Potter says. “I just was thinking that I wanted to start teaching specific counters for some of the more dangerous curses in class next week and it’s been a while since I’ve practiced with them and,” He pauses, rakes a hand through his wet hair. “I was wondering, if you’re not doing anything this afternoon, maybe we could go back to the training rooms and get in a bit of duelling?”
“No,” Harry said quickly. “We came straight here.”
By the time they had all eaten their fill, there wasn’t much food left over. They split up the little bit that remained between the four of them and layered the containers with Preservation Charms, and Draco was happy with that, especially since he’d managed to get an extra portion of those potatoes he liked. It wouldn’t be enough for lunch, but when Draco went out late drinking, he usually had a light supper after he got home, and this would be perfect.
Ten minutes later, he’s satisfied with his efforts. He’s enlarged the room to a more reasonable size using the built-in Expansion Charms, and installed long rows of shelving on one wall and a set of cupboards along another. His desk and filing cabinets take up a third, and in the middle of the room sits a large worktable. He eyes the stack of boxes, but after unpacking his whole flat this weekend, he doesn’t particularly want to do more unpacking right now. He’ll do it later.
Potter turns away and cuts into Draco’s sandwich viciously, then turns back and holds it out to him. “And here are your bloody triangles.”
“You said,” Harry tells her, and the back of his neck is prickling with how badly he wants to turn around and look at Malfoy. Wants to give him a look, anything to reassure him that Harry’s sorry for saying all of this. He wants to tell Malfoy that he doesn’t really mean it, even though every word of it is true. “You told me that you’d never forgive him. Ever. You were tortured on the floor of his drawing room while he looked on and did nothing. You could have died, and he’d have just watched it happen.”
“Did you owl Hermione?” Harry asked through a mouthful.
Draco can feel his cheeks going pink. He’d woken up naked last time, and he’d hoped that he’d lost his trousers after he’d left Potter’s home. No such luck, apparently.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut as Potter continues to fuck him. If he ignores the hard table beneath him, the sharp smell of potions ingredients, he can almost pretend this is real. He fucking hates that he does this, fixates on the gaping wound of what he cannot have and rubs salt into it with futile wishes that it were otherwise.
He gives a surprised little laugh, then sobers quickly. “Still, I ought to have known. I ought to have put it together.”
Then the Williamson case had blown up and Harry had been too swamped with work to spend much time investigating Malfoy, other than occasionally adding a newspaper clipping to the small pile tucked away at the back of Malfoy’s file and doing a couple of quick checks with the Department of Magical Transportation to see whether Malfoy had continued to take his repeated trips out of the country.
isn’t all that romantic, is it? And if we’re supposed to be dating…”
If nothing else, Draco also wished that Harry would at least start using his regular glasses again. But when he’d brought it up—subtly, of course, very subtly—Harry had shrugged and said that he hadn’t bothered to go pick up his things from St Mungo’s yet after they’d been decontaminated. Draco was halfway tempted to stop by and pick them up himself. The only reason he hadn’t was because St Mungo’s required Harry’s signature to release personal items. And while Draco could forge his signature reasonably well (it was a large, sloppy H followed by a scribble, then the loose impression of a P followed by another scribble; not exactly difficult to falsify) both he and Harry had reasonably well-known faces, so Draco would also have to get hold of some Polyjuice, and at that point it was honestly more trouble than it would be worth.
“No, but you’re all I got,” Potter snaps back. “I can’t drive and shoot at the same time, now get your foot over here.”
Cartwright was frowning now. “You are aware of what a delicate operation this is, and what’s at stake if we fail. An overabundance of caution may make all the difference. Enforcer Tipton needed to know; you did not. That’s simply all there is to it. Now,” He turned to Harry. “How did you come to be involved in this, Auror…?”
Truthfully, Harry didn’t either, because when had arguing about anything with Draco Malfoy ever been anything other than a massive waste of time? He sighed and shoved at his hair even though it flopped right back over his forehead the moment he dropped his hand. “Fine. Whatever you say.”
“I certainly hope so,” Draco says, letting his lip curl up in the barest fraction of distaste. “I am interested in some, how should I say, more
They hurry back into the house and slip down the hall and into the toilet together, where Potter locks the door.
“Why? Are you nervous about this?” Harry asked, lowering his voice.
“Two months is a perfectly reasonable length of time,” Draco insisted. “Long enough for it to become serious, but not so long that we’d be expected to be heartbroken about it ending.”
“I can?” Draco asked, even though he knew exactly where this exchange was headed.
She shakes her head and sighs. “It’s not kosher.”
The house remains dark and quiet. That’s good, at least, that he didn’t wake up Potter. He’d insist on making sure Draco is all right, and Draco’s still too rattled from the nightmare to put on a good front. Potter might sit up with him, might insist on making him tea, might put his arm around Draco and be a steady presence at his side, warm and comforting, and—
Potter finishes arranging the potions and takes care of himself first, downing the contents of three different vials in quick gulps. Draco recognises potions to stabilise his depleted magical core, and though his magical reserves will have to rebuild on their own, Potter looks worlds better after the potions. Less peaky, and though he still seems tired, it’s nowhere near the pale exhaustion he was showing just moments before.
He didn’t think it possible, but Potter’s smile grows brighter. “Come on,” he says. “They’re probably wondering what’s kept us.”
He follows Potter out onto the front step, waits as Potter locks up, and then they walk around the side of the house together and Potter unlocks the dilapidated little shed and wheels out his motorbike. It’s a huge thing, all glossy black metal and glistening chrome. Potter’s already grinning, looking enormously proud of it, and Draco can’t quite blame him. He reaches out a hand, brushing his fingertips along the smooth metal side, and catches a hint of magic.
Potter?
So when the full moon in October draws near and he starts to worry whether he’ll live past it, there’s a tiny part of Draco that thinks maybe it’s okay if he doesn’t.
“Huh,” says Potter, and turns his attention to his breakfast.
As the week progressed, Draco began to give up on his hope that things would get better at any point soon because, despite his best efforts otherwise, he couldn’t make himself stop thinking about Harry. And the more he thought about Harry, the more difficult it became to resist sneaking glances across their cubicle at him throughout the day. Or how he couldn’t help but smile back reflexively whenever Harry grinned at him. Or the way the sound of his laugh or the soft brush of his fingers against Draco’s would make his stomach flutter. And throughout it all, a part of Draco was incredibly mindful of how
But rather than take him straight to the bedroom after dinner, Malfoy detoured into the sitting room.
“Well, then,” Malfoy said, and turned and stepped into the waiting lift. “I believe we need coffee to go with these croissants and the rest of this conversation. Will you join me? It’s not a date, mind you. It’s just a conversation.”
Harry looks at him. “I’ve been around.”
She leads the way back through the Floo and then out of the library and up the hallway and into the little anteroom where she gives him a hug and extracts another promise from him to owl her before she pushes him out the door.
Harry’s mouth thins. “Well, maybe you are now, but I never knew it then...and anyway, wouldn’t’ve fit with the deaths. You weren’t even remotely connected to any of ‘em.”
Eventually boredom wins out over his taut nerves, and thirty minutes past opening finds him slouched behind the counter and idly working through today’s
, which frankly just sounds uncomfortable.”
"I can feel it," Harry breathed, awed. This close, the tattoo was brimming over with magic, curling through Harry's senses like a half-remembered song, leaving him struggling to place the tune until—suddenly—it clicked. "Strength."
“Cissa,” Lucius says, low and plaintive. “Our son plans to become a
Satisfied that the shop was as secure as they could make it, they hurried out of Knockturn and over to the Leaky which had the nearest publicly accessible Floo they could use. A few minutes later, they burst out into the Ministry Atrium. They strode past the fountain and, without speaking, diverged at the security stands.
“Not quite, I don’t think. It’s close, but not quite.” The walls shudder, and a strip of wallpaper sags loose, peeling down to the floor. The light tilts, like a cloud passing over the sun.
“Shit,” Zelda says, darting back to the worktable and snatching up the stirring rod. The potion has frothed up and she gives it a couple of brisk stirs, and the bubbles subside.
from across the table.
Malfoy sighed a little and tossed his wand aside. “Does it really matter?”
orgasm out of it by now.
None of it, Draco reflects, is anything at all like the glamorous life he’d imagined for himself once upon a time. It’s not exciting. It’s not laudable. It’s not important or influential or extraordinary or even particularly enviable.
And then his knees buckle and he’s gone before he hits the ground.
“You’re not taking this seriously,” Draco says.
He hurried down the hall. He hadn’t encountered Malfoy on the stairs so if luck was on Harry’s side, he might catch him at the lifts. They’d been running slow all week. And—yes! There he was, standing in front of the grate.
He seems surprised, and then abruptly guilty, as if he’s been caught out at something. And that brings it all back, righteous Potter sneaking around, checking up on Draco. He knows Potter’s gone on to become an Auror, only just completed his training, in fact, not that Draco gives a rat’s hairy hindquarters about anything to do with the Chosen Git, but it’s been all over the papers recently. Annoyingly unavoidable.
Potter hesitates. He won’t quite meet Draco’s eyes as he says, “Don’t stare, okay?”
* * * * *
“Very well, then,” she says. “If you’ll just give me your name I’ll let him know you’re here.”
“I know what you’re doing,” Harry said later that evening.
It’s easier than he was afraid it’d be to get the body out of the hospital. Only one person questions where he’s taking the empty gurney, and Draco tells him that one of the wheels is loose and he’s taking it for repair. The man buys his story readily enough, and in no time Draco finds himself at the back exit of the hospital. No one’s around, so he hauls the body off the gurney and stashes it behind a skip just outside, gives the gurney a shove back down the hallway, and goes to find Potter.
And it wasn’t until later that evening that Harry stopped to really think about it, and got what Draco had been trying to say. Harry had never thought of respect as particularly romantic. People certainly never brought it up when they talked about romance. But respect in a relationship was sort of like the foundation of a house, wasn’t it? No one really thought to talk about it so long as it was there and working properly.
His resolve lasted until he glanced over and saw that Malfoy had let his book fall forward and was lying with it covering his face, one finger idly tapping against the spine.
“Are you scared of talking to a Muggle or are you scared of the baby?” Potter murmurs in Draco’s ear as they head for the cab.
“Yeah,” Harry said, then grimaced. “I’m pretty sure the shop witch got a glimpse of my arse.”
“Unbelievable,” Draco mutters to himself as he strips off another gear and holds it under the magnifying glass. He doesn’t quite know whether he’s referring to Potter or himself, there.
Draco’s big stupid grin dialled back to something small and pleased. “Feel better?”
Her pout has no effect; Potter just laughs and shakes his head. “Sorry, I’m not anywhere near drunk enough to dance.”
“Whatever you’re getting is fine,” Draco said, preoccupied with scanning the room.
“No, no,” Potter breaks in. “I mean, how are you going to explain that you’re dating a man?”
“No,” Draco said. “I suppose we wouldn’t.”
"Mmph," Harry said as Malfoy slipped out of bed. He tried to make a grab for him but couldn't get his arm untangled from the bedsheets fast enough. Malfoy disappeared into the en suite, and Harry rolled over into the warm place in the bedsheets that Malfoy had just vacated, pressed his face into Malfoy's pillow, and snuggled back down.
“Really? You two honestly call each other
It could very well be both; Malfoy was exactly the sort of arsehole who would do both at once. And what did it say about Harry that he sort of liked that about him?
so badly for this to be his life that he couldn’t breathe.
“Quicker than you thought it would be.”
Draco reins in his spiralling throughs. After what they’ve all been through, he can understand why she worries, even though he’s not likely to face much of any danger here. Misbrewing a potion, perhaps, there’s always the danger of his cauldron exploding. But Draco is careful and knows what he’s doing. He hasn’t blown up a cauldron since his second year, and that was Pansy’s fault, anyway. These days, his biggest fear is getting nipped by his owl.
Predictably, Potter’s expression turns mulish. “I might’ve,” he says.
Pansy nudges him then in a quick bump of elbows, and Draco realises abruptly that he’s nearly left it too long to add the flobberworm mucus. He takes the uncorked vial she holds out to him and tips it carefully into his cauldron, waiting anxiously while it hisses and bubbles for a few moments before settling back into a simmer. He exhales slowly, then reaches for the minced bat spleen and adds it slowly to his potion, sets the empty dish aside and reaches out a hand.
They nodded to each other.
“Hardly,” Draco says. “Mother is lactose intolerant. I grew up drinking almond milk. And stop looking at me like that, almond milk’s not some newfangled health thing. It’s been around for centuries.”
Harry wasn’t about to let them get off that easily, but Ginny came thundering down the stairs just then, shouting about how the Kestrals' Keeper had just been traded to the Cannons, and then Harry didn’t have the chance to get a word in edgewise with how she and Ron were shouting at each other, and then he forgot all about it.
“I mean,” Draco went on as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “We all know that the
, alone. Well, erm. We… are taking that part of the relationship slow.”
for the foreseeable future. He reaches back up into the cupboard for the teapot. “How did we get together?”
It was all Draco could do to keep from leaning back into the touch. Harper’s hand was warm, even through the layer of his robes, and it made Draco want to know what Harper’s hand might feel like on his skin without anything between them at all.
Katie sits up and squares her shoulders. “Go on, then. And don’t press. A girl’s got to have her secrets, you know.” She smiles, but she looks faintly nervous.
Malfoy coughed out a sound of disbelief. “Would you like me to give you the complete list? We’d be here all afternoon, you’d miss the rest of your party.” He huffed, then drew himself up again. “Look, I’m rather bad at this—“
“I was pulling my spell. Sorry,” Potter says. He doesn’t sound sorry at all, now that he’s seen Draco’s well enough to be capable of complaining.
“Yeah, okay. That’s.” Draco leans in, kisses Potter again. “Yeah, that’s good.”
The love Potter holds for his godchildren is readily apparent in his voice, different from how obviously he loves his friends, but no less powerful. After everything Potter’s been through, it’s nothing short of incredible how well-adjusted he turned out. How, despite all the losses he’s suffered, he still has the ability to love so deeply. Potter loves fiercely and completely, with every inch of himself. Draco sometimes wonders what it would be like to have that sort of intensity focused on him.
Well. Draco had been running his own potions lab for five years now and hadn’t managed to poison himself yet, so Harry supposed that had to count for something.
“Harry,
“I thought so too, but it’s actually because one of the earlier recipes used it for buns that resembled… you’ve, ah. You’ve got a little, just there,” Draco said, gesturing to his own face to point out where Harper ought to be directing his attention.
complicated than it looks,” Harper said, still staring at the expanse of shiny buttons.
They stay as they are for a while longer, until sitting begins to make Draco feel restless. He shifts, and Potter’s arm falls away.
"What's the difference, then?"
Silence stretched between them again, and this time neither of them broke it. Draco honestly had no idea what to say. He still had no idea how he felt about Harper, or last night, or any of it. For today, he only hoped to lose himself in the rhythm of running the shop, and hope that somewhere along the way it might sort itself out.
enough for them.)
“That’s most of what you’ll be doing here, I’d imagine,” Draco explained, leading the way over to the gleaming brass behemoth squatting on the end of the counter closest to the door. He couldn’t quite smother his amusement at the look on Harper’s face when he came around the end of the counter and got a look at the business end of it. “Don’t worry, it’s far less complicated than it looks.”
“Hold on,” Potter says, shoving the bag into Draco’s hands.
“Oh for— That’s terrible.
“What do you call it?” Potter asks, leaning over the worktable for a better look at the parts.
Digging in his bag, Draco pulls out the modified tent and unfurls it. It’s little more than a large square of canvas with a tent flap stitched onto the front, but it’s the spells layered over it that make it special. Draco uses a
Barely a minute later, a Healer flanked by a pair of Mediwitches enter the room. Draco is asked all the routine questions: does he know his name, does he know what day it is, what’s the last thing he remembers. They take his vitals and ask him whether he’s in any pain.
“Will not,” Ron said, but he put the lid back on the box anyhow. “We’re having Thai. I don’t think it’s possible to ruin my appetite for Thai.”
Zelda hangs her cloak on its hook and looks down at herself. “Bugger,” she says, and goes into the lavatory to fix it.
“Stop it,” he said. “I’m going to sit here until you come to your bloody senses and get back in bed where you belong.”
“That’s quite all right. I’ve cleared my schedule for the day.”
Draco gives him a look as they walk down the hall to Draco’s lab. “This is something I’m curious about. Do you ever meet at the same bar twice?”
So instead they listen to the wireless for a bit, curled together under a thick knitted blanket. Potter’s combing his fingers through Draco’s hair and it’s making him sleepy.
“Well,” Draco says, looking down at his hands. “Anything to help you get us out the door faster.”
As his fingertip makes contact with the frayed edges of the hole, there’s a little spark of magic. Harry doesn’t see it, or hear it, but somehow he
“Throbbing member,” Hermione corrected. “It’s always member in those sorts of books. Not always throbbing, though. Sometimes turgid. Sometimes rigid. Once I saw
The girl behind the counter had grown into a woman since then, and they’d been back often enough over the years that she recognized them right away and greeted them cheerfully. There were no other customers in the shop this early in the evening and they stepped right up to the counter.
“And when will you know that?” Draco asks.
“Well, here,” Granger says, offering one of the cups to Draco. “We thought you’d be around a bit longer, so we brought you tea.”
“Shit,” Harry said, pulling back from Desmond. He slapped at the panel of buttons, jabbing at the one for level two. “Sorry, not you. I need to check in with the Head Auror.”
They went down to Filing and, pausing just outside the door, played a quick round of Stone-Cloak-Wand to determine who had to face Miriam, which Draco won easily because Harry almost always opened with Stone. But it turned out to not matter much because Miriam wasn’t there. Cecil was working the reception desk today and he (much to Harry’s dismay) practically fell over himself to help the Boy Who Lived. Draco stood back and did his best to keep from laughing while Harry sent him pleading looks whenever Cecil’s back was turned.
,” Draco says, trying not to sound nearly as shaken as he feels by Potter’s question. It’s been so long since he thought like that that it’s a bit of a shock to have Potter be surprised that he’s changed. He picks up a bag of peaches.
Leaving him to it, Draco chose a table against the far wall of the room, away from the bar and about equidistant between the other two pairs of patrons. A minute later, Harper joined him, with two pint glasses filled with something deep amber.
“What? Oh,” Potter leans up and grabs a towel and puts it over Draco’s groin. “Shit. Sorry.”
Draco hummed again. “Are you suggesting we tell them that we can’t date each other because we’d already spent close to a year in a secret ex-nemeses-with-benefits arrangement?”
“It’ll be fine—” Draco begins, and Weasley flinches, actually flinches, when he says it. “All right. What’s going on here? This is about more than me bending a few rules. Because you know if we went into the Ministry right now and filed the right paperwork, I’d have no trouble at all getting approval to go in there.”
He glares at her. “Don’t do it behind the counter. It looks unprofessional.”
Ron sighs and sets his own mug down on the counter. He suddenly looks very serious. “I know that look. Things not adding up?”
“How about the Three Thestrals? Do you know that one?”
“Hi, Katie,” Zelda says brightly. “How have you been?”
“Floo call with Henri,” Emily says without looking up from where she’s marking something down in the diary.
“Come on, Molly,” comes a man’s voice, a bit farther down the hall but still clear. “You know I make the best biscuits.”
“He’s a bloke, he’ll be fine,” Potter cuts in.
broken something valuable, they’ll never admit to it, especially since all the ones most likely to have broken something (read: all the ones with Weasley as their surname) are also the ones most experienced in saying they didn’t do it with a perfectly straight face, and if Molly Weasley isn’t able to get the guilty party to crack, Draco Malfoy certainly won’t be able to. So Harry doesn’t bother with a reply. Just gets his mouth back on Draco again, and after a moment one of Draco’s hands comes up to cup the back of his neck, the slight pressure guiding him in closer.
There’s a small seating area to the left of the front doors, where witches and wizards waiting to be escorted to their vaults can sit if there’s a queue. A few tufted velvet chairs line the wall, along with a rather sad-looking ficus in a large porcelain pot. Lucius leads the way over but doesn’t sit down.
Draco nods. “I’ll see you then.”
Draco aims a swat at Harry in retaliation but in the dark confines of the closet, he misjudges how much room he’s got to swing and ends up rapping his knuckles against the door.
“I’m done in here,” Potter says when Draco’s soaping himself up for the second time. “I’ll be waiting outside, okay?”
“The laughing mice, for fuck’s sake, Potter. The mermaid one was a merlot. Which is
He’d wanted—
is always a bright yellow-gold explosion of fine filaments spiralling toward the target, weaving around it lightning-quick and pulling it back to Draco.
“These Greeks were certainly a cheerful bunch,” Draco grumbles. Potter doesn’t answer, and Draco glances up at him. “Potter?”
Harry hated lying to his best friend like that, but what else could he do but go along with it? He didn’t particularly care that he’d been directly ordered by Robards not to involve Ron with what he knew of Pura, and fuck the IUMC. But if he explained that much, then he’d also have to explain about Malfoy’s true involvement. And Harry really, really didn’t want to do that.
“It’s back there,” the shop owner said, pointing. “The one on the floor.”
Harry pushed his finger deeper inside Draco, twisting it a little as he searched for…
Potter gets the corner of the label worked loose and peels a strip from it. He rolls it between his fingers and drops the little ball of paper onto the table, then begins picking at the label again. Peels another strip. Balls it up. Drops it onto the table. Picks at the label.
And that was fine, wasn’t it? His work was more important, he’d told himself at first. Then, after they were partnered, it was more important to maintain his professional relationship with Potter. And then after that, his friendship with Harry had become something he wasn’t willing to risk on something so uncertain, and besides, by that point Draco had grown used to living in denial.
He could still feel the heat from the flames echoing through him, nightmare and memory twisting up until he couldn’t tell which was which.
Ginny swatted at him. “Shut up,” she said. “I want to see her try to stab him with her biro.”
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, sure.”
“I need it clean,” says V in their neutralised voice. “I need
“Potter—”
And then it clicked what Draco meant to do.
“Wow,” Harry said, and Draco broke off mid-rant, waiting for the rest of his reaction.
“God, Malfoy,” Harry breathed.
Slowly, he sits down on the edge of his bed. He takes a deep breath. He opens the book.
“Unlike you, my potion’s coming along perfectly. I haven’t got time to antagonise Potter,” Draco says. The last few steps are delicate and as much as he’d like, he doesn’t have time to bait Potter right now. It’s rather a shame.
“I just saved us from getting caught,” Harry says, jumping down. “George, Lee, Angelina, and Ginny are all right there, and I’m sure you’ll agree with me that I’d rather dance naked down Diagon Alley than let any of them catch me with my trousers—quite literally—down. They’d mock us for the next decade. The least you could do is say thanks.” And, he thought with no small amount of satisfaction, he’d responded to a crisis with a level head and even used one of the spells he’d learned as an Auror Trainee. Take
Malfoy sits down on the bed across. Harry can feel his eyes on him but he doesn’t look over, not until the sensation becomes almost like a crawling over his skin. Their eyes meet. In this lighting, Malfoy’s got the greyest eyes Harry’s ever seen. He blinks rapidly, taken aback. This whole situation is making him batty. Ten years Harry’s been on his own, never having more than an hour of conversation with anyone over the span of several months, and most of that with people he’s later killed, and now he’s had Malfoy within throwing distance for twenty-four hours.
“Oh,” Draco said, touching his fingers to the frosty pint glass in front of him but not lifting it. “I do like sour beers.”
“Oh,” says Draco, then sidles up to Potter with a slow smirk, nudges his knees apart and presses up between his thighs. “Well. I’m rarely polite, you know.”
It doesn’t really matter either way, because the end result is the same.
“Sorry,” Draco says, not sorry in the least, because what a bloody hypocrite Potter is. “I was under the impression that we agreed no magic in the house, except for those occasions when we feel we’d like to use magic in the house anyhow.”
“Harry,” Draco said helplessly, looking up at him with hazy eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes and stretched out his legs under the table to nudge his feet up against Harry’s. “Well, we’re going to be spending quite a lot of time together. I’m sure something will come up.”
, and brings up his Shield Charms as Draco twists out of the way. The Blasting Curse Draco fires off a split second too late goes careening off it and explodes against the far wall with an echoing
There’s a soft click as Malfoy pops the cap on the bottle of lube, and a second later it clicks again as he shuts it. Harry’s practically shivering in anticipation, skin tingling as he waits for Malfoy to make his move.
Curse damage could explain all of this. And what’s that Muggle saying about hoofbeats? Sure, it could be a zebra, but Harry’s whole life has been an enormous fucking herd of zebras up until now. Isn’t he due for some horses? Right now, this with Malfoy… this is everything he’s ever wanted. Isn’t Harry due for that, after everything he’s been through? It’s wonderfully ordinary, and Harry could be so, so happy here.
It’s really incredible. Harry Potter, with his shit childhood and a madman chasing after him for his adolescence, with more blood and death in his formative years than anyone should have to face. With his money and his fame and more magical power than any one man’s got a right to have.
He shifts where he’s sitting, digs in his pocket for his cigarettes and lighter. Plucks one from the crumpled pack and lights it in a quiet rasp of flint and a warm flash of light that’s muted by his cupped hands. He drops the pack and lighter on the rocky ground beside him—no sense in putting them away since he knows he’ll need another before too long—and inhales, the cigarette flaring a warm and comforting orange. The smoke prickles as he draws it deep, and he pictures it curling through his lungs, holds it there for a breath, and then exhales and watches it dissipate. As always, a little of his tension fades with it.
The page of sales records he held was long columns of customer information written in very tidy cursive script, which would have been perfectly legible if not for the fact that it was all inked in a retina-abusing shade of fluorescent yellow-green. Draco squinted. Park grimaced. Weasley actually recoiled.
“Yeah, and then you went and started talking about your dick,” Harry counters.
It’s the first week of November when Draco slips. He’s distracted, going over an experimental potion that’d gone horribly wrong today at work, when he squeezes between the table and Potter, who’s at the counter wrestling with the corkscrew. He unthinkingly puts his hand against the small of Potter’s back, something he’s done dozens of times before, and feels how Potter goes tense.
Draco wipes the stirring rod off on a rag before he sets it down on his worktable. “Lost in thought,” he says, and shifts a little to the side to block Zelda’s line of sight to the cauldron. “Did you need something?”
“Fuck off,” Malfoy said again, this time more forcefully, and when Harry laughed, Malfoy shoved him.
Dreamless Sleep sounds very tempting, and the only thing that stops Draco from taking a dose is that he hasn’t got any here at the house, and if he takes the Floo to his shop, he’ll have to go back downstairs and explain to Potter where he’s going. And he doesn’t think he can face Potter right now. He was able to hold himself together well enough, but once he was up the stairs and out of sight, the hasty mental walls he’d put up had toppled over, and the shock of it had struck him nearly as hard as the initial realisation had.
So he says, before he can stop himself, “So go and buy it there, then.”
“Honestly?” Ron said, mouth twisting sourly as though this pained him to say, “I’m hoping that the git goes running straight to daddy, and he pulls some strings in the Ministry to get us unassigned to each other.”
Draco snorted. “You had Thai last Thursday.”
“Hermione,” he sighs, showing Draco his supper of a plain baked chicken breast, wild rice, and green beans. “She’s got it into her head that I need to eat more healthy.” He shakes his head dejectedly. “And yeah, maybe I could’ve stood to eat fish and chips a little less often, but Merlin. That woman gets an idea and runs full-tilt with it. Never does anything by halves.”
“Shh,” Draco says, smoothing his hands down Potter’s bare back, gently pressing him down to the mattress. “It’s all right. Just lie there, just relax. You were lovely.” He keeps stroking, feels Potter go limp and pliant beneath his hands. “You were so beautiful, the way you let go.”
Some people find it a bit too much to be pleasant, sharply medicinal with all the bunches of dried herbs he keeps around. Lucius in particular always wears a pinched expression on the rare occasions he visits, like he’s got his nose stuck in a heap of dragon’s dung. (Which Draco does sell, but it’s packaged securely in airtight jars.) It’s one of the hazards of an apothecary, and Air Freshening Charms can only do so much. Draco doesn’t think it smells bad, and indeed most of the time he barely even notices it until he steps outside and it’s suddenly gone. But it’s good to clear his nose, because he’ll walk back into his shop with fresh sense. Even though it’s not his favourite smell in the world, it’s comfortingly familiar. Something about it strikes a chord deep in his brain that makes him think,
“Potter,” Pansy say, half-turning in her chair. She tapped one long red fingernail against the rim of her glass. She made no move to give him his seat back.
“That’s rather
The last time Draco had seen it, it’d been propped up on a shelf, displayed between two copper kettles and the selection of fine silverware. Now it was tossed carelessly on the counter, droplets of blood spattered around it, the blade itself coated from tip to handle.
“Yeah,” Ron sighed, slumping against the table. “Yeah, it will be.”
“Who’s some of you?”
“I know. Do it,” Draco says.
Harry was meant to let his falsified background do most of the work in catching Malfoy’s interest. Pointing out that cursed ring had been something of a spur-of-the-moment gamble, one that Harry had been forced to take. Harry didn’t know shit about antiques, but he did know Dark Arts, and being able to sense them was one of the only lingering effects from having held a bit of Voldemort’s soul inside him for so many years. He may not be able to speak Parseltongue anymore, but Harry had an eerie, almost preternatural ability to sense Dark magic. The handful of cursed objects in Malfoy’s shop resonated with him in a way that he couldn’t entirely explain, but had no trouble whatsoever honing in on. Panic that he was blowing the interview had caused Harry to point out that ring, but luckily Malfoy had leapt on it like a fish lunging for a baited hook.
Malfoy gave him a few more thrusts before he pulled out and took himself in hand, working himself on long, smooth strokes, the head of his cock disappearing into his fist at the end of each stroke as Harry watched, transfixed. It felt like it took barely any time at all before Malfoy gasped out, “Here, here,” and then came over Harry’s stomach, long stripes of come mingling with Harry’s own.
, Harry thinks. His heart starts rushing in the most confusing and terrifying way. All of this, all these weeks with Malfoy, all this time spent trying to get to the bottom of this corrupted scheme, all the nights in that tent, away from the world and his job and his life and
Sighing, he turns around, avoids looking at Zelda, and heads for his workroom. “Well, I’ve got a few things I need to brew—”
“Oh, all the time,” Draco said as sarcastically as he could manage.
Rolling his eyes, Draco aimed a mild Polishing Charm at Harry’s glasses, then another at his ear just to make Harry yelp and flinch away from it.
“Here, let me see,” Malfoy said, reaching. His voice was calm and his fingers were cool when he pried open Harry’s fist to get a look at his hand. “Oh, that certainly looks nasty, doesn’t it.”
But she doesn’t. She rounds the coffee table and then she sinks down onto the settee beside him and leans in and puts her arms around him, and suddenly Draco can breathe again. Relief shudders through him, leaves him reeling and desperately grateful. It feels faintly ridiculous, giving in to this childish urge to cling to his mother. But he’d been so afraid that she’d hate him. And perhaps it is babyish for him to be this afraid of his mother’s disappointment when he’s nearly twenty, but the War put things in perspective for him. It nearly cost him everything he held dear: his wealth, his status, his family. In the aftermath of it all, he’d realised which of those truly mattered.
“That’s the thing,” Malfoy says. “Because the spell is so big and so complex, the Secret Keeper is less like a Secret Keeper and more like a, a…
Across the table, Ron gave Hermione a look that read,
“Are you feeling all right?” Zelda asks, and Draco nearly drops his glass stirring rod into the cauldron.
When he came back to himself, he was propped up against the sink and Draco was trying to unclench Harry’s fist from his hair. He had a spot of come dotted on his lower lip. Harry had the urge to drop down to his knees and kiss it off.
Harry sighs. Is he really considering this? He can’t consider this. He has to just do it. It’s just fucking Malfoy. No one’s even going to miss him. Not Harry anyway. Harry hasn’t missed him for ten years; he can go the rest of his life knowing Malfoy’s dead. Might even make life better.
“We’ll continue this conversation later,” Dorothea says, patting his arm, and Draco gives her a smile.
Lucius exhales slowly through his nose, not quite a disappointed sigh but as close as he’d ever allow himself to come to a gesture so melodramatic as that. “Good,” he says, then gives Draco a significant look. “Then I’ll see you for dinner.”
, and it irritates him that Potter seems to think he is.
“Ha!” Ginny says, shooting the rest of her siblings a very smug look, then comes up beside Draco and leans close to murmur, “Don’t you ever snap your fingers at me again.”
"Something tells me that my poor sofa will never recover after you've had your way with me on it," Malfoy said.
“I can’t believe you’re trusting me with this,” Draco says, stroking his fingertips over the Cloak. It’s cool to the touch, the fabric remarkably thin but drapey. It reminds him a little of skimming his fingertips across a pool of water.
The front of his robes are soaked with blood, and Draco doesn’t even notice it until a young Mediwitch draws him aside and cleans him up with a few gentle spells. “There you are,” she says with forced cheer. “You’ll want to look presentable when you visit your partner after he’s patched up.”
“Well, yeah. But it was the way she was being nice. Like she felt sorry for me,” Harry says, his frustration rising again. “Like I’m so helpless…”
He shut his door after himself and kicked off his shoes, nudging them neatly side-by-side against the skirting boards beside his wardrobe. Harry started to unbutton his shirt but halfway through he caught sight of his bedsheets lying twisted and rumpled over his bed, and even though it’d been nearly two months since the last time he’d had Draco over, it struck him hard that he was never going to have Draco here again. The tight wistful-possessive feeling twisted through his chest again as it sunk in that what they’d had was over, really over.
Draco’s hand trembles when he reaches out to flip the fourth photo over. He sees himself shake violently, the shivering progressing to brutal convulsions. He pitches forward and something black and spiky can be seen piercing through his skin, sprouting up between his shoulder blades.
“I’m going to put the kettle on,” he says. “Would you like a cup of tea?”
“Lovely of you to be so gracious about it,” Harry told him, flopping onto his back, legs still trailing off the bed. He rolled onto his side and mouthed at Draco’s hipbone.
Potter has his wand out before Draco can say anything else, and casts. A Warming Charm rolls over him, and Draco sighs into it. He lets his eyes slide shut for a moment as he concentrates on the faint tingle of Potter’s magic sweeping over his skin before it fades into warmth. He thinks of Potter’s magic, the bright yellow-gold, and wishes he could see him cast. Warming Charms are always a soft rose-gold haze.
can say whatever the fuck I want. It’s the one advantage of being the prisoner,” Draco said. “
"I…" Harry closed his eyes. It was right there, right on the edge of his mind, maddeningly within reach if only he could just— "Luck," he said.
After leaving a still-unconscious Leo with a very distraught young clerk down in Booking (for some reason they always acted like it was the end of the world when they were brought an unconscious suspect; really, you’d think they’d be used to it by now) Draco set off in search of Weasley. He found him exactly where he thought he’d be: in the small break room down by the Interview Rooms, making tea, just as he always did before he had to do an interrogation.
“Entirely beside the point,” Draco muttered, so like himself that Harry couldn’t tell whether he was breaking character or not.
“Fuck off, you like my caveman brain,” Harry said.
“Trying to steal my man, Ron?” Harry asked, as he filled up the vase with an
“I’m not a child,” he says. He doesn’t look up, but he knows she’s staring at him. He can feel the weight of her gaze. “You don’t need to monitor my interactions.”
“Although,” Draco went on, and Harry sighed and counted himself lucky he’d got even a minute’s reprieve. Though, knowing Draco, it was only because Draco wanted a moment to choose which direction to take this stupid conversation. “I have to say I’m a little bit hurt that you didn’t. I thought we were getting to be friends.”
It’s a condom packet.
It’s not until they’re out by the shed, ready to leave for work, when Draco unveils his real gift. While Potter’s taking off his glasses to prepare for pulling his helmet over his head, Draco activates the charms he’s added to the motorcycle. Potter blinks for a moment, then puts his glasses back on. He turns his head a little to the side, focusing on the air to the left of the motorcycle before slowly sliding his gaze back onto it. As an Auror, he’s of course been trained to see through a Notice-Me-Not, and when he works out what Draco’s done, he breaks into a wide grin.
“Smart boy,” Katie says, grinning at him, and it’s still got the same edge of mischievousness to it that it did back when they were children, right before she talked him into doing something that’d get them both in trouble. “Hello, Draco. I hear you’re after some Erumpent horns?”
“Neither,” said Draco. He drained the last swallow of his butterbeer and set the empty bottle aside. “We read
When he looks up, he finds Granger watching him. She arches her eyebrows, clearly waiting for him to comment on the badge.
Draco takes the two weeks until his next transformation to enjoy this. He makes Potter dinner and spends quiet evenings on the sofa with him. At night he wraps himself in soft blankets and falls asleep to the steady sound of Potter breathing beside him.
Until proven otherwise, the approach he, Ron, and Robards had decided he’d take with the employees was simply to be friendly to them, to get close and gently press for information about Malfoy, and how much they knew, and if they were involved in anything illegal themselves. Once he had a better feel for them, Harry would evaluate his next steps from there.
- - - - - -
“I wouldn’t have to, if you didn’t insist on wearing things until they fall apart on their own,” Draco says, and Potter rolls his eyes and piles a stack of pancakes onto his plate.
Beside him, Malfoy is quiet, still sleeping
…” His frown deepened and he bit his lower lip. “Something with an S… The… Fuck. Fucking fuck.” He peeked through his fingers at the book lying open on the table before him. “
Tonight, the prospect of climbing into bed with Malfoy felt like the first time all over again. Because even though he’d already done this a dozen times before, it suddenly felt so much more significant.
“They’re terrible,” Harry said. “All my friends are terrible.” God, he just knew that none of them would ever let him hear the end of this. They'd all be unbearable about it.
But other than that, nothing else had really happened. Draco had no other obligations at work or at home. And with only the one not-very-exciting case with which to occupy himself, that meant that Draco had more than enough time to spend mooning over Harry like a lovesick second year with his first crush. And worse, he felt so bloody obvious about it. Harry didn’t seem to have noticed, thank Merlin, but a couple of times Draco had caught Weasley watching him speculatively, and Draco couldn’t quite shake the feeling that Weasley had him all figured out.
He curls in on himself, arms wrapped around his middle, and shakes his head. Because it is his fault. If he’d acted quicker, if he’d been strong enough to resist. If he hadn’t been such a stupid fucking idiot and had spoken up about trying to get Potter to take the asphodel and moondew.
But now that he is looking, it’s so obvious. He sees the way Potter glances at him when he thinks Draco’s not watching. The way Potter’s smiles turn just a little softer when they’re aimed in Draco’s direction. How he presses back into it when Draco touches him, and how his hands seem to linger when he touches Draco. He stretches his feet under the dining table until they’re in Draco’s space, and he angles his body slightly towards Draco when they’re sitting on the sofa, and at the Weasley’s Potter will put his arm around Draco or hold his hand, and it feels like the most natural thing in the world.
“Here,” Potter says, grinning a little as he passes one of the bottles to Draco. “Surprise.”
-ed, and the empty tin in the sink in about two seconds. “I feel like ice cream. Let’s go to Fortescue’s.”
Draco only gave him a wink, slipped off his lap, and bent down to fetch his flower from the floor. He tucked it behind Harry’s ear this time, and Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t make any move to take it off. He stood up to take his trousers the rest of the way off—his cock was wet with lube and come, to say nothing of the sticky smear on his thigh, and there was no sense to make laundry more difficult for himself—and Draco snickered from behind him.
Draco frowns, taking a good look at Potter. He seems worse now, paler and vaguely nauseated, and somehow smaller and less confident than he’d been while helping Draco. “Are you all right?” he asks after a moment.
Draco feels like an arsehole, standing there with a couple of empty wine glasses in his hands, but Potter’s not paying attention to him anymore. Draco shuffles over a couple of steps to the table and sets the empty glasses on the corner of it.
you know better.” He crammed his bag into his locker and slammed it shut. He turned to leave.
Malfoy dumped him in, and Nicolas Cage’s voice cut off abruptly as Harry sealed the bag with the book inside. Through the clear plastic, Harry could see that he’d gone still and quiet. He breathed a sigh of relief.
Harry tried to glance around as subtly as he could manage, following the direction of Ron’s look. Sure enough, standing near the bar very close to where Harry had been standing with Hermione was a tall man with dark hair, his half-lidded gaze fixed very intently upon Malfoy. And Ron’s description had been accurate; he did indeed look like he was picturing Malfoy naked.
And just like that, the fierce yearning that had ignited in Draco’s chest settled down into something smaller, something manageable. Because this was just Harry, and he was exactly the same ridiculous arsehole that Draco had been working with for years now, had been friends with for years now. Nothing had really changed, except that Draco was a little more aware of himself than he had been previously.
Hermione snorted, and Harry whacked his rolling pin against the dough a few more times before he said, “That’s not funny.”
“Thank you,” Draco says. “It does.”
Harry counts quickly in his head. That would make this September. And the last case he worked was in December. He hasn’t worked one since, according to Ron.
Draco blinks at him, surprised. “What?”
“Some partner you are,” Draco grumbles.
“Have you seen any of your friends recently?” Narcissa presses.
“Eventually?” Harry repeated.
That’s another little silver lining of being called in today on this particular case. If Harry’s got to blend, then so does Malfoy. And there’s very little Harry loves more about Malfoy than seeing him in Muggle clothing.
As always, Potter’s taken so long that they’re the last ones out of the men’s locker room, though as they pass by Draco can hear Levi and Stalton talking in the women’s. They leave, Potter rambling on about his plans for the next class, and Draco’s so busy trying to ignore the way that Potter’s damp hair curls at the nape of his neck that he very nearly walks straight into Weasley.
Malfoy turns back to his lunatic wall.
“Oh,” Harry said. Maybe this wasn’t such a bad idea. If nothing else, they’d at least be able to talk about Quidditch. “Sure, I’ll give it a try.”
“Come on,” Potter says. He drops his helmet beside the door, then takes Draco’s and sets it down too. “We should go say hi to Molly first.”
“Yeah, you know. Were fucking him, or dating him, or had gone off and got yourself secretly married to him or something.”
Harry’s breath shuddered as he exhaled, not quite a sigh, and he hunched over a little against his will as Draco swallowed around him, his fingers curling in Draco’s hair and pulling him in tight until Draco’s forehead bumped against his belly. Draco pulled off just far enough to suck in a deep breath through his nose before sliding all the way back down, sucking hard.
He leaves her to prepare the room for the next arrival, and steps out into the bustling lobby of London’s International Portkey Station. Doorways to the Departure Rooms line one wall, doors for the Arrival Rooms line the other. Draco follows the signs for Customs and Baggage Claim, and can’t help but notice that none of the witches and wizards he passes respond to him in any way. In fact, other than a distracted, “Pardon me,” from a witch as she levitates her enormous steamer trunk past him, no one gives him so much as a glance. He collects his suitcase and joins the queue at Customs.
“That one’s mine,” Potter tells him. “Go on and sit down. I’ve already called for a cab, will you be ready to go after we eat?”
He reached the lifts and jabbed at the button, then sighed and slumped against the wall. With Ron no longer right in front of him, Harry could admit that maybe Ron had a point. At the very least, Harry probably should have planned better, and gone into it with a stash of Sobering Solution, sneaking sips between pints so that he could really keep his wits about him while leading Desmond to think that Harry was drunker than he actually was.
“I…” Harry begins, confused. Because he doesn’t think they’ve just had sex. They’ve only just woken up together. Haven’t they? He’s had this daydream a zillion times, he’s sure they’ve just woken up.
Draco looks down his nose at the man. “Lucius is my father, yes.”
“Er,” said Harry. The exam for the chapter on prisoner interrogations wouldn’t be for another few weeks, unfortunately. They had to get through the one on interpersonal relationships and then the one on proper arrest procedure first. “Chapter six. I need to study chapter six.”
—and he hits the ground of the Hogwarts pitch hard, and his arm snaps—
The look Molly gave him was one part pitying and about five parts exasperated. “Harry,” she said. “You
“The same,” Draco says. He shrugs. “I decided I ought to try it.”
So far, they were all losing spectacularly.
It was exhausting. It was pointless. And Draco was far too drunk to be dealing with this.
“She’s fine, Malfoy. It’s all in how you handle them. If you’d paid attention to Hagrid in Care of Magical Creatures, you’d know,” Potter says, shooting a smug look over his shoulder.
“Ta-da,” he says with a stupid little flourish, and immediately wishes he hadn’t. He’d love to know what it is about Malfoy that turns him into a shambling moron.
Katie’s over by the table by the window, tinkering with a contraption of coiled copper tubes, and she sets down her tools and wipes off her hands on her apron as she turns to Draco and Potter, who’s looking around the lab with unabashed curiosity.
He steps out of the shop and into the sunlit street.
, Malfoy’s hips bump against Harry’s arse. He pauses for a second before withdrawing, then pushes forward again.
“No, that sounds fine,” Draco says, raising his voice to be heard over the wind rushing in their ears. At this point he doesn’t care if they take a detour to Scotland. He’s entirely in favour of anything that lets him stay up here, alone in the sky with Potter, for as long as possible.
Harry stared at him, and when Draco didn’t seem inclined to elaborate, prodded, “You’re wearing it.”
He frowns a little as he observes her. The modest Muggle clothing, the little silver Star of David glinting against the dark wool of her jumper. She wears her dark hair pulled back severely, no make-up, and no jewellery other than the simple necklace. The stubborn tilt of her chin practically dares him to remark upon any of it. When she reaches out to shake his hand, her palm is warm and dry and she clasps his fingers firmly.
been awful. But if he’d changed, or was trying to change, then Harry thought that maybe it was time to see whether that was true.
Harry gets it, to an extent. He thinks longingly of the yellowing bruises trailed up and down the insides of Malfoy’s thighs. Harry spent a good amount of time up close with them last night, fitting his fingers to them and pressing gently even though he knew that it wouldn’t feel any different to Malfoy. He’d sort of hoped to be able to see them again before they faded away entirely, but Harry supposes that if he doesn’t get to, it’ll just give him an excuse to replace them later.
He looks up at Potter, and Potter’s gaze slips a little bit to the side. “Oh, hey,” he says. “You’ve got a little… hold still.”
“I had gathered that impression, believe it or not,” Draco said, then, “I love you too. Now please get on with it. I feel like I’m going to die if I don’t come soon.”
“You mean that to be an insult, but I’m not going to take it as one,” Zelda tells him, and then goes back into the front of the shop before he can respond.
But the fear in her expression eases, fading into concern. “I haven’t said anything because it’s none of my business. But I really think you ought to go see a Healer about how you’re not sleeping. I know you don’t like to accept help, but I also know how careful you are with your work, and if you’re tired enough to mislabel an experimental potion…” She shrugs and trails off. “Perhaps this is more than you’re able to handle on your own.”
—Pansy finally emerges from the bedroom looking…
She bustles him straight to the infirmary. Potter’s already there, sitting cross-legged on a bed with his face buried in his hands. Granger’s sitting next to him, her hand rubbing soothing circles between his shoulder blades. Jealousy and desire hit Draco at once, like a punch to the chest, knocks the breath out of him for a moment. He wants to shove Granger out of the way, press Potter back and—
It’s not until he feels himself starting to get hard that it hits him that the door to Malfoy’s hospital room is open and they’re plainly visible to anyone who might wander by. This really isn’t a situation where he can take care of an erection with any sort of satisfaction, and the next best thing is (unfortunately) to not let one happen in the first place.
He sets it aside to dry, then rinses the rag and hangs it up. By the time he finishes with everything, his fingers are as wrinkled as raisins and he can’t stop yawning. He’s looking forward to crawling into his bed and passing out for the night. He thinks he’s tired enough at this point that he might not even dream.
. Something they could slip to people who worked high up in the Ministry and take over. It wasn’t working properly yet, hadn’t done much more then make a handful of people sick enough to land in St Mungo’s, but they hired on a Potions Master to look at it for them. Ron and I found out at the last minute and went in without waiting for backup.” He looks down at his feet, shrugs. “We probably should’ve waited.”
in the kitchen, if Master is desiring something then Master ought to be calling for it—”
Potter grunts in what Draco is almost sure is amusement, and scoops a heaping forkful of noodles into his mouth, and the whole thing is just so bloody
He moves off into the rest of the house before Draco can argue. Not that Draco
“You’re my employee,” Draco reminds her sourly. “We’re not friends.”
“Compared to mine, it is,” she points out, and he can’t quite argue with that. Pansy’s grown into pin-up girl curves while Draco’s just stayed bony. “And speaking of kettles, I’m going to go put one on. Can I interest you in a cuppa?”
“Oh my god,” Potter says. “You’re not actually telling me you get France and Belgium mixed up, are you? Because I’m really starting to worry now.”
Potter stops clowning and looks at Weasley, wounded. “You want Draco more than me?”
Even if this was a mistake—a massive, monumental, monstrous mistake—it was undoubtedly a mistake worth making. He had to give this a chance, see where it might lead. Even if it ended poorly, at least then he’d know he tried.
It’s a trial to get through the day, but Draco makes it. Pretending to be fine saps what little energy he’d started with, and when he goes home that evening, he’s so tired he feels almost drunk as he climbs up the stairs to his flat, clumsy-footed and unsteady. He fumbles the door open, lighting his flat with a halfhearted
“On purpose, though,” Harry said. He brushed a lock of Draco’s hair off his forehead, then trailed his fingertip down the faint blue tracing of a vein that showed at Draco’s temple. “This would be even better if it was on purpose.” There’d be a bed if they did this on purpose. And Harry could have a blowjob without the cold porcelain edge of the sink digging into his arse, and he knew from experience that kneeling on the cold tile floor wasn’t exactly pleasant, either.
“Did he even buy anything after all those questions?” Harry asked, turning casually away from the jewellery box and sidling half a step to the right to put himself directly in front of the display of perfume bottles.
They sit in silence for a long while. Potter eats another clementine and Draco doesn’t look at him. After a while longer, Potter stands up, using the wall of the alcove to push himself to his feet.
“You’re late,” he scolds in a whisper.
” Potter shouts, and the wand rips itself from Draco’s fingers. Potter tosses it aside as he advances on Draco. “You see,” he continues, “I don’t
Hermione shrugged and took another drink of beer. “Probably wouldn’t have on its own, but paired with the jumper it was fairly obvious.” She gave his feet a pointed look. “Along with those awful socks of yours. You really ought to replace them.”
"Hey," Ron said, pointing at the ceiling. "Looks like someone was a little too enthusiastic with their spellwork here."
“Hello, Draco. Harry,” Hermione says, then gives Harry an exaggerated once-over. “You look very nice today. I hardly recognise you without that tatty old hoodie of yours,” she teases.
and the whole thing is so bizarre. Draco doesn’t know what to do, whether he should back away slowly or try to press forward. Worse, he doesn’t know what he
