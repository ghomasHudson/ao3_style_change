“No, wait. I need to say this. Please, just, don’t give Tom any information about me, all right? I know he seems nice, but he’s really--”
Okay, guys, next chapter is in progress.  Hopefully should be up soon.  Or at least it shouldn't take more months.  Wish me luck!
“I’m starting to think I’ll never get my chance to just be normal, y’know? Read about someone else’s life in the newspaper...plan out names for my future children...have somebody I like buy me jewelry...that sort of thing.”
Draco’s eyes flashed. Harry gulped. He wished he weren’t being bombarded with reminders of this berk’s attractiveness at a time like this.
“No, Ronald. We’ve been over this. When you have a child, you accept them for who they are. It’s your duty as a parent.”
“That you should have drowned Potter in the lake when you had the chance. I said that when we were thirteen, didn’t I?”
They walked into the living room to find the entire Weasley family assembled. There was a chorus of dutiful greetings from the adults, and of enthusiastic ones from the children, though they all refrained from embracing their Uncle Harry until the presence of the strange man was accounted for.
“He can have that, to a point. Unless the kids need new homes, there isn’t all that much I can do. It’s Hermione he has to worry about.”
“But we should try to present a united front, if only because--” Harry choked a little. “What are we going to do about Tom?”
“Honestly, Harry,” Draco scoffed, “it’s public record. And even if it weren’t, Gerta would find it.”
“Best not think on it,” Draco agreed. “Doesn’t do to go too deep. Next we’ll be discussing how it is we both became familiar with the plot of
Harry sipped again, then slumped against the wall and sighed. “Fuck, Draco. I probably shouldn’t...I mean, it shouldn’t be you I tell this to, but, fuck it, you’re here. I mean I’m here.”
As their sight came back and their ribs expanded again, they looked around. They appeared to be underground, in some sort of system of dark tunnels.
“We’re not going to get any help from my father,” he repeated. Raising his head, he looked Harry in the eye. “I need to visit my mother.”
“He’d better,” said Ginny, setting their plates down and joining him at the table. “Nothing less than the best for my second-favorite ex.”
So saying, he pushed Hari away just enough so that he could see as Sirius pulled the collar of his shirt aside. There, on the left, just below his collarbone, was a fairly large tattoo of a crest featuring a golden lion rampant on a crimson field. Below it, a golden ribbon held a word that must, Hari figured, be his name.
“No,” said Harry, “that’s not it. I just hate the thought of anyone being in that position. If it had been me...if Draco had been like I was with Tom, and I had been on the outside...I’m not sure I wouldn’t have done the same.”
Draco sighed in great frustration and waved the stick around some more. The birds flew into the shape of a hand giving the two-finger salute and a ribbon appeared bearing the words, “Fuck David Caine.”
“Nothing.” Harry swallowed. “Er, it’s just that...what’s a bloke like you doing in a place like this?”
“You look like you understand,” said Harry with a shrug. “I guess it’s good that we’re both here now.”
“I’m not a 'boy,'” said Harry viciously, “and I’m not pretty. What I am is tired, and probably homeless now, too, thanks to you. Please leave me alone.”
The man, almost as short as Harry and with black hair to his shoulders, said something exuberant that began with “
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Oysters to start, then the funghi pasta, because I have it on good authority that the mushrooms here are divine. Dessert is a surprise.”
Draco Malfoy's crash course in Wizarding history; includes alimentary adventure and the introduction of an important character.
“Right.” Draco shifted in his seat, a rare show of discomfort. “It’s like this...yesterday I was accosted by Riddle’s associate, Pettigrew. He’d got wind of my, er, association with Harry and was trying to threaten me into stopping it. He made ominous hints as to the nature of a collaboration between Death Eater Pharmaceuticals and the old Malfoy Corp, which I had advanced but not particularly understood some time ago for...personal reasons. Tom reasons. Apparently, according to Pettigrew, having a social worker sniffing around the place could be bad for both companies. Well, I may be a decadent aristo parasite, but I’m not a
was Harry, seated facing the door at a prime table in the center of the restaurant, his eyes narrowing as he spotted Draco.
“Absofuckinglutely not,” said Harry. “That would put a distinct kink in my plan to forget that the bastard was ever born.”
sorry. I had no intention to...be a malignant force in your life. I wanted a date with the pretty boy at the till, that’s all.” In his experience, talk of this sort worked well on Muggles. And fuck him if Draco didn’t really, really want this Muggle.
“I’ll pay it,” said the blond with a shrug. “Money is no object for me. You shouldn’t have to suffer when your time could be spent so pleasantly.”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, who in turn rested his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder. Draco was the taller of the two, which suited them well.
Harry awoke with a splitting hangover and, groaning, groped around for his glasses. So tired was he that it took several moments to realize that he was groping something quite other than eyewear.
“Harry had a long and taxing morning of doing his civic duty,” said Hermione pointedly, “and he needs this time to recuperate emotionally.” Harry tried not to roll his eyes. Hermione was wonderful and he loved her, but she utterly lacked subtlety.
“I love you two,” he said, “and I’m sorry I made you worry. Luna, Gin, I’m sorry I missed your messages.”
Friday, they went the the Malfoy family’s favorite jeweler, where they selected their desired stones and settings. Draco’s garnet was a deep red, and Harry’s emerald was, predictably, green.
Harry rolled over with alacrity, his smile fading into an expression of distant contentment. Draco realized with something of a headrush that he was watching Harry drop again. Without even being touched.
, and he’s incredible. But I’m still his godfather. Do I need to tell you how many ways I have to transfigure a dead body?”
“Well, I’ve really only got Gran, and she loves Hannah. ‘The magically competent child she never had,’ as she puts it. And I get along with Hannah’s parents too. It makes things easy.”
“All right.” Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist, gripping tightly. “I want to mark my territory in front of the Weasley matron and her brood.”
monster. A hint that there were children at risk was enough to make me overcome my pride and do my job, if only for the afternoon. I managed to get into the records room at our lab, but…” he shrugged helplessly. “Can’t make head nor tail of it. Thus, my appeal to Our Savior and his associated swot.” Draco wrinkled his nose at Ron. “I did
“Indeed,” said Draco, taking a sip of his own drink. “To this nightmare we’ve gotten ourselves into.”
Harry gave Ron an exasperated look, ran his hand through his hair. “No, she’s not,” he said quietly. “And she has every right to treat me how she wants.”
“I never knew,” added Harry, voice gentler now. “I mean, I could have guessed. I faced enough racist stereotyping growing up. In fact, that’s probably
“Harry!” She hugged him. “And Draco. It’s nice to meet you. I’m sorry it didn’t happen sooner.” She offered her hand.
for his birthday that year. Just past the marbled endpapers, there was an inscription in her neat, practical cursive.
“George?” Harry set down the violently orange box he’d been carrying from the stockroom. Helping out at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes often cleared his mind, but it wasn’t working today.
“Well,” he said, “Well. Let’s get you upstairs before I start weeping in front of the patrons, yeah?”
“All right, so his company was fucking irritating, but the wine was expensive but it was free for me, so there I was, not leaving. But then he got to be too much and I decided to get up and leave after all but then I ran into someone--Amy, it’s not funny, look, stop laughing--Amy, it was my uncle!”
Draco was barely containing a smirk. Tom hadn’t called him by his surname in years. Almost as soon as they’d met, he’d started calling him Draco, with a casual intimacy that spoke of ownership. Draco hadn’t found it grating at the time, but somehow the name “Malfoy” on Tom’s lips sounded right and proper now.
“Your boyfriend,” said Albus, slowly and clearly for the hard of hearing, “is the father. Of your son’s boyfriend.”
.” Harry sighed, frustrated. “Look, Lord Malfoy, if it’s really about that, take my advice. Wash your hands of Riddle before this all blows up, or you’ll go down with him.”
As Vernon rounded on the maitre’d and began shouting at him, Draco quickly ushered Harry away to the loo. Once they were there, Draco lifted Harry so that he was sitting on the counter, then began dabbing at his face with a monogrammed handkerchief. Harry was too much in shock to protest.
“I know that,” she responded, rolling her eyes. “You just don’t strike me as the type to want to. You’re not flashy, and you usually hate being given things.”
“All right.” Harry went to the bar. When he got back to the table, Hermione had arrived. Harry leaned down and kissed her forehead before sliding back into his own seat.
“I see how you’re looking at him,” Sirius remarked. “Can’t say I blame you. He seems--I mean, I’ve known him
that,” said Harry, freezing Draco with the intensity of his voice. “But it’s something I left in the locket, all right? I don’t want the bloody fucking thing, why would I? This is just a simple extraction.”
Draco shrugged. “It’s possible you were born a Squib--that is, someone with Wizarding parents who has no magic himself. Or…” Draco’s eyes lit up. “Or, whatever it is you did to cause the Dark Lord’s curse to backfire stripped you of the magical power you were born with.”
Scorpius gaped at his father. “Go on? You don’t have any? Concerns? About what you’ve heard so far?”
“Aragog’s grandson, 'e was,” Hagrid grunted. “One of ‘em, at least. Merlin knows ‘e couldn’t seem to--well, we’re men ‘ere, I suppose, aren’t we Harry? You know what I’m gettin’ at.”
“Yeah, pipe down,” said Ron. “We’re about to talk about Harry Potter’s feelings. D’you lot know how rare that is?”
Both Draco and Narcissa snorted at that. Narcissa raised her eyebrows and looked as if about to speak, but Draco shook his head minutely.
“But, Harry.” Neville stared him down, with what Harry had come to recognize as his professor stare. “You do need to talk to her. Even if it’s just to tell her you’re not backing down—which I hope you won’t. Nothing good comes of going in circles round this.”
He had barely been furrowing his brow at the computer for two minutes when his mobile rang. It was Hermione, of course.
Paris, and he struggled to focus on any one thing for more than a second. People milled about in outfits that looked like crosses between magistrate’s robes and business suits, wearing oddly-shaped, gaudy hats and laughing careless French laughs. Food stalls abounded with sandwiches and hot drinks and, in one case, crepes that flipped themselves while the proprietor chatted with her customers. The storefronts varied wildly from those that seemed somewhat familiar--patisseries, clothing stores, bookstores--to those that seemed anachronistic or simply bizarre--apothecaries, menageries, a gloomy antique shop straight out of Dickens, a storefront that merely displayed a single, inexplicable silver instrument that moved on its own. When Harry looked up he found the sky filled with owls in flight, deftly avoiding columns of colored smoke coming from an array of stone chimneys. It being night-time, candles glowed in the shop windows, and globes of soft yellow light floated just above the heads of passers-by. Music was coming from just down the street, and Harry peered ahead to see a street performer playing a violin with a cello standing on its own next to him, playing itself in accompaniment. Beside him, Amy took a deep whiff of the air.
There was a young man shouting encouragements; Arthur could only see his dark hair and infer his small stature. Turning his head, he saw two other guests, about Ron or Ginny’s age, one of them a girl holding a gigantic cat, and the other--
“I know. And I will. But, sir, I wanted to talk to you about something.” Kingsley gestured for Harry to sit in the chair opposite his desk.
“I’m going to arrange dinner,” said Harry. “Here, so either of you can storm off if you need to. I’ll make something good. D’you like ratatouille? Of course you do, Frenchie. But Hermione will want to know this--soon. And I want to know, too.”
So it was that on Sunday afternoon, Harry and Draco stood in the jeweler’s shop, admiring their new rings, which were simply but beautifully crafted and fit perfectly.
It shouldn’t have surprised him that Hermione was the first to catch on, but it did. Somehow all her organized competence shielded her darkness from his memory: the cruelty of the girl, the
“Like I said...I’m not entirely sure. A lot of it went over my head. But, Harry, there’s something wrong about this collaboration. I think...well, it seems pretty likely that people are being hurt. The test subjects--the neighborhoods--well, I don’t think you’ll like the patterns. And I’m not sure
“None of that,” said Draco sharply, slapping Harry’s hand away. “That’s not how this goes. I’m making you forget. That means you’re going to lie the fuck down and I’m going to suck you off.”
Harry wanted his drink, but that hardly mattered now. He wanted to say something cruel to Tom, but he couldn’t speak.
“James’ mum taught it to us,” said Sirius with a weak smile. “She said it was the fastest way to clean up a room. We were thrilled, till the cupboard showed up again in the middle of the night and shouted at us to put everything away properly.”
“I’m fairly certain most corporations use some form of cloud storage,” said Draco drily. “Even I have noticed that trend.”
“I don’t follow, Draco,” said Blaise. “Wouldn’t their outsider status make them all the easier to, er, persuade?”
“So was I,” said Draco. “I’ve been Tom’s friend since Uni, same as you. We talked. We talked about you.”
“Well, then I’d like to continue speaking, and I have a topic in mind.” Merlin, was nothing with his children ever
“Oh my,” said Amy, pouring out healthy measures of tequila into two cracked mugs. She handed Harry the “friends of the library” mug and kept for herself the one that pictured Happy Bunny in a strait-jacket.
“I thought you wanted to get to know me,” said Draco. “I thought you’d want to know how it cut me every time Tom texted me about the beautiful green-eyed boy whom he’d like to--”
Every second he had to spare from his hefty caseload, Harry spent in search of Tom’s experimental subjects. He was drawing from the few clues in Draco’s notes, and after days of searching, all he had turned up were a few names without even a solid enough lead to justify an interview. He was about ready to throw his laptop through the office window.
“Mmph,” said Albus through his faceful of pillow. Harry sighed and sat gingerly on the end of the bed. He rested a nervous hand on his son’s shoulder.
“No,” said Harry. “Despite my aunt’s constant shouting to the contrary, I’m as normal as they come. Well, except for--wait a minute. Did my aunt know my mum was a--that she could do spells?”
“Rather not,” Draco agreed. “Truth be told, I’ve no idea how she tracked me. I don’t see her doing legwork in the Muggle world, nor her minions. I haven’t the contacts to discover whether the Dark Lord might have created some new method of tracking.”
“Yes,” said Hermione tartly, “and while we’re at it, where have you been? All that you went through yesterday, and then hardly a word from you!”
It was Luna’s keening laughter that broke the silence, but they both followed after her easily enough.
“Thank you, My Lord,” said Draco. “As for the plan—simply put, I would like to offer myself as a spy. I would go to Dumbledore, proclaim to him that I want to go over to the goody-two-shoes side of things, express remorse or, well, whatever it is Gryffindor types experience when they’re overcome with their emotions.” Pettigrew gave an offended squeak, and Voldemort an appreciative laugh. Draco went on. “So I tell him I want in on his little game in exchange for the safety and security of myself and my family. We’re known to be self-serving cowards, so he’ll believe this easily enough, if my hunch is correct. Thus, our funds are restored. If I’m right in thinking he is unaware that you reside here, My Lord, then that will be that. Of course, if he is aware, then my parents will unfortunately have to be removed to Salazar knows what dreadful safe house until our vaults can be wrested out from Dumbledore’s influence. As far as I can see it, that would be the only real disadvantage of the plan.”
Ill-gotten gains or no, Draco was willing to press that advantage. Which was, in a word: at present Tom would not be able to predict Draco’s actions, for he assumed Draco actually had a vested financial interest in a deal that he had, in truth, only arranged to guarantee himself a shag.
“I know how you feel,” said Harry. “I wish you’d believe that. I’ve been where you want to go, and I can tell you--it’ll never be enough. He’ll never
No--Draco had to admit to himself that that wasn’t true. He may not like Harry, but he oughtn’t fool himself that it was actually Harry himself that had brought on his ire. A bit creepy, a bit intense, and stubborn as hell, he was, but not a bad bloke in all. No, nowadays Draco hated Harry almost solely because of Tom. Harry had captured Tom’s attention in ways Draco never had--probably never would, truth be told. Maybe it was that desperate, self-immolating honesty of his. That was a trait Draco could never attempt to replicate.
Turning back to the till from the bake case, Harry accidentally elbowed a stack of cardboard cups, knocking it to the floor.
And, beyond that, it felt like a betrayal as well. Because he knew he had likely opened Pandora’s box, and that this would end with him firmly pitted against Tom. And all due to his own thoughtlessness, too. All due to his not caring what deal he was making as long as it kept Tom around. He’d never been all that bothered by his own reckless behavior, but it seemed it had finally come back to bite him in the--
Scorpius’ dad was waiting with Mr. Potter and the Granger-Weasleys. Scorpius and Al followed Rose, Hugo, and Lily over to them, trying to look as though they had nothing particularly important on their minds. Judging by the way his father raised his eyebrows when their eyes met, Scorpius was failing miserably. But his father pulled him into a restrained, one-armed “we are in public” hug, and Scorpius leaned into him. He would miss Al, and he was afraid to tell his father about them, but it would be nice to be home for a while. He took in the clean, sophisticated scent of his father’s cologne, a reminder of the luxuries of the Manor and his father’s soothing company. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad.
“Harry James Potter,” she hissed, “you texted ‘I’m okay. Need time.’ And then turned your mobile off!”
“What I’m sorry for.” Here he almost looked Harry in the eye. “Back--then. In the battle. When we thought you were gone. It hurt more than anything. Anything, Harry, even--even Fred. I’m sorry. It’s true though. And even in all that pain, part of me knew. Part of me was happy for you, that you were with them. That you got to rest.”
having you on,” said Draco. He brandished a polished piece of wood. “I’m a wizard. This is my wand. I use it to do magic.”
“Good boy.” Draco unbuttoned a few of the buttons on Harry’s shirt, lightly stroking the skin there. But they were still in the entranceway of Harry’s flat, and that wouldn’t do.
“Not with me,” said Mr. Chatwal, “but he left this for you, just a moment…ah!” He dug in his desk drawer and pulled out an envelope, handing it to Harry.
Draco surreptitiously cast another warming charm on himself. He’d been waiting outside the cafe for nearly half an hour now; it was amazing how long it apparently took to fire someone. Which, of course, hadn’t been his intention when he began speaking to the man at the till, but it was probably for the best after all. It seemed deeply wrong to Draco that someone so attractive worked in such a menial position. Draco would have to get him a decent position before he left here. With a wand in the Muggle world and with money to boot, there was little Draco couldn’t do in that regard.
“Gay or not, he’s worth at least ten of you. Not to mention, his wristwatch alone could buy your house, and probably Dudley as well. The way I see it, I’m moving up.”
“Rather,” Theo agreed, rolling his eyes. He pressed an unlabeled button and they began to descend. “So what brings you down here? You’ve never expressed an interest before.”
“We’re not in similar positions,” Draco pointed out. “Rather, we’re in opposite positions, I should think.”
“Right then,” said Harry. “I’d say it was nice chatting with you, but, well, you know.” And with that, he disappeared down the fire escape. Seconds later, Tom stepped onto the balcony, godlike in his black satin pajama pants, hair mussed, bare chest gleaming in the porchlight. He pinched Draco’s arse in greeting and then stole his cigarette, taking a deep drag.
Draco cringed, remembering the last time Harry and Tom had encountered each other face to face. He nodded slightly, conceding the point, and reached for another cigarette.
Harry leaned into her. He couldn’t believe he’d been so stupid. This was his Mum. He couldn’t leave her. He would have to make her see. He wouldn’t give this up. They would all be together. They would have to.
“I’m sure it will,” Harry ground out, “but I need the money. Now, if you’re quite finished pointing out my own poverty to me, I--”
“They’re testing out a new drug,” she said slowly. “From what I can tell, it’s supposed to be harmless enough--a new cold medicine. But the concern is that it has narcotic effects, and might create dependency in children or tempt parents to use it as a chemical restraint. Essentially, it’s risky enough that no parent was willing to volunteer their child for the testing with full informed consent. So rather than go back to the drawing board, they’ve been offering cash and luring poor parents in without giving them a full understanding of the dangers involved.”
“Yes, well.” Pettigrew slurped his coffee, apparently trying to increase the drama of the moment. “As you know, the research interests of the Malfoy Corporation and of Death Eater Pharmaceuticals are closely tied. A mutually beneficial state of affairs.”
Draco went to the side of the bed, letting one hand drift up to stroke Harry’s hair while the other squeezed his hip, thumb pressing into the red spot where his teeth had just been.
Careful not to disturb Amy, he got out of bed and took stock of himself. He must have fallen asleep with his shoes and glasses on; all was present and accounted for, if a little worse for being slept in. Ah well. He’d bet Draco could just use magic to freshen him up again. Because
“You know,” said Draco consideringly, swirling his half-empty glass, “I don’t think I’ve ever met anybody else who actively
And now? Well, all of those things still applied, but they weren’t of much use. These circles of fruitless research reminded him of nothing so much as the swimming lessons Hermione had given him during the fiasco with the inter-school triathlon. For weeks he’d fumbled about the shallows, gasping, feeling as though he’d better befriend the bottom of the lake sooner rather than later.
“Congratulations, Harry” said Percy, whose bureaucratic training seemed to have given him the ability to recover quickly from surprising news.
Albus huffed out a sigh of deep suffering, but he buried his face in his dad’s shoulder and hugged him.
“What’s your favorite colour?” Harry blurted out. His palms were sweating, and he would do anything to get Draco to stop.
“They were.” Draco agreed. “And they were enough of a problem for him that Voldemort went after them himself. He killed them, Harry. And, as far as my world is aware, he killed you as well.”
Harry was delighted that his children were so eager to converse with him, but it had been hard to get a word in edgewise through the whole dinner. Now, however, they were busily tucking into the chocolate cake he’d baked while they unpacked, and it was the time to speak. He swallowed.
Harry did not go into work early the next day. In fact, he went in almost an hour late, hair still drying from his shower, utterly exhausted. He had been at his desk just long enough to do his most pressing paperwork when Kingsley approached.
“This is some trip,” Amy muttered, and, clutching tighter to her cat, she squeezed her eyes shut and stepped through. When she opened her eyes, she gasped just as Harry had.
So Draco took a step toward Potter, leaning down just enough to telegraph his intent without invading Potter’s personal space.
Harry continued to watch as Sirius fired away at the now-dodging cupboard. Eventually he started calling out helpful instructions-- “Lower!” and “A little to the left!,” that sort of thing. It began to feel rather like a game, and Harry found it quite absorbing in his exhaustion.
As it was rather difficult to live with someone to whom you weren’t speaking, Draco (and Salazar the Crup, cruelly separated from his greyhound companion, Godric) went to stay with his parents at Malfoy Manor. Harry figured this situation would probably support his intention to think things through in a thorough and permanent manner, even if every second that he and Draco (and Salazar and Godric) were on the outs was painful.
“Harry, you can’t just ignore this.” Draco took a deep breath. “Your parents didn’t die in a car crash. They were murdered, Harry. They were murdered by an evil wizard called--”
“Well,” said Tom lightly, “regardless, I can’t stand by and watch you destroy the place like this.” He walked to the coatrack, took down his coat, slung it over his shoulder. Then, in a deliberately dramatic gesture, he glanced back over his shoulder and said, “Are you sure you don’t want a quick fuck before I go?”
“Well,” said Harry thoughtfully, “You never know. My mind could change. Maybe if I met the right person, I’d want them to buy me jewelry.”
However loose his cannonballs, it was clear enough that there was a natural first step: he would need to find the
my friend, probably my best friend--and I hurt you. Used you. I always knew you felt things for me that I didn’t feel for you.”
she was reading. “I don’t think you’ve got to worry about Dad, either. You know he’s been quite friendly with Mr. Malfoy lately.”
All of that was new and terrifying. But staring at Harry Potter was a pleasantly familiar occupation.
Draco held up a single finger, indicating that he was not yet ready to respond. He drained his glass, set it down, and put his head in his hands.
“My what?” said Harry sharply. He remembered the first broom Petunia had given him. He’d been six years old, and hadn’t eaten until he’d learned to use it. He’d told this to Amy one grim vodka night, so she understood enough to look at him sympathetically.
Scorpius wracked his brains. Who could his father possibly be seeing that would be affected by his relationship with Al? It was a conundrum, a paradox, a bafflement.
Her frown deepened. “It’s been done before, of course. It’s certainly illegal, but there are a lot of ways a slippery group with sufficient funds can escape charges. I’m not sure of the wisest way to proceed.”
Harry came up running on fumes. He came up spitting grave dirt. His every step was a maddening clatter, hollow bones dragging at his feet. Every drink was bitter in the back of his throat. Every bite of food was gritty with ash. He’d let death touch him, and now he was tainted.
"Woof," said Salazar the Crup, before he and Godric began to run circles around the house by way of getting reacquainted.
“Thank you,” said Draco primly, sitting gingerly on the one armchair, a hideous orange corduroy monstrosity that Amy had rescued from a curbside. That left Harry and Amy to perch nervously on the sofa (a pink and green paisley, courtesy of Oxfam).
Harry gritted his teeth, trying to swallow back the venom that seemed to well in his mouth at hearing Draco call him by his surname as if they were at school again. That was decidedly not what this meeting was about. This meeting was about avoiding pissing Draco off long enough to claim the photograph back so that he could walk away and, god willing, never see the toff or his psychopath fuck buddy ever again.
“Uncle Harry!” Victoire Weasley shot out of the kitchen like a tiny blond comet, and was shortly wrapped around Harry’s legs.
“Blue,” said Draco. Harry stopped; he hadn’t even realized he’d been walking toward the door, not really.
“Oh!” Understanding dawned on Harry’s face, followed by a wide grin. “That’s great, Al. He’s a great kid. And I’m so
, he felt the shirt tightening around his shoulders and chest. He heard a series of popping noises and looked down to see--
“I know a lovely restaurant,” Draco assured her. “We should be safe while we’re in public--even Aunt Bella wouldn’t risk a highly visible attack on foreign soil. When it comes to lodgings, though, we should lie low.”
quite late, because at that moment Sirius’ conjured cupboard felt it was an appropriate time to reappear.
“No,” the blond interrupted, “No, I rather think I’m not. See, I’m very rich, and I refuse to miss out on a good evening simply because a hovel like this refuses to compensate you adequately for your labor. I insist you dine with me. I’ll make it worth your while.”
of it all before he could decide how to proceed. As Draco paid his bill, he nodded to himself with all the bourgeois determination he could muster (though, admittedly, that was little enough). He was in a desperate situation, so he would do that which was, generally speaking, anathema to him.
Harry looked down doubtfully at the snoring, leaking beast whose head rested on his insufficient knee.
Draco swallowed. That...well, he wasn’t quite heartless enough to scorn that, even if he did hate Harry with all his might. No friend of Tom’s could take orphanhood lightly.
“I don’t believe we’ve met,” he said playfully. “My name is Draco Malfoy.” Hari grinned and shook his hand.
“Now, now, Weasley, play nice,” said Draco. “I’m only here to make friends. I’m afraid I haven’t given you lot a fair shake in the past.”
“Go home and rest. Stay home through the weekend; you clearly need the break. We’ll see you Monday.”
“Well,” said Draco, eyes lighting up again, “it’s a vastly understudied area, but I like the theory that Muggles can see any magic that is designed for
“I noticed,” she said dryly. “I thought it would be faster to come down here and let you in than to wait for you to stop buzzing so I could reply. You coming in?”
“Then...what happened? Why does everyone think that? Why--” He cut himself off, but both the others could hear the unasked question.
Death Eater Pharmaceuticals, after all. When one pursued a project in that industry, science was bound to happen at some point.
Draco looked slightly mollified. “All right, you have me there. But you’ll not be blabbing this about until you’ve formalized things, you enormous brute.”
“Ah.” Father paused to take a sip of his brandy. His face was composed, but the sip was long. When he was done, he merely said, “That casts an interesting light on my news.”
Harry snorted. “Elegant,” he said sarcastically, eyeing the martini, which Draco was lightly sipping, barely disturbing the drink’s placid surface.
The two Malfoys grinned at each other. Divided they may be from time to time, as is the way with any father and son, but they were united in the love of an awkward Potter.
Victoire’s little arms wrapped around his knees again, and Harry lay a hand on her head. Molly released him, grasping his shoulders instead so she could look at him, one tearful face to another.
“Leave me the fuck alone,” said Harry. “Haven’t you done enough damage? I’ve been suspended, you know, pending fucking termination. You had to stand there and say your fucking piece, and now my landlord’s going to throw me out on my arse come next week.”
What he needed was a list of names. Of course, he wasn’t stupid. He knew he probably couldn’t have that until a trial at the very earliest; in fact, if D.E.P. was canny enough to destroy the information,
“I meant, said Harry tightly, “that he didn’t give it to me, not really. It was a loan, not a gift. He made that plain.”
“I’m going to do some research. There must be some kind of legal recourse here, even if restraining orders are stupidly limited.”
His mobile buzzed. He reached for it hungrily, having been isolated from all cellular service in that steel trap of a records room.
Before the wizards’ eyes, Harry and Amy fell instantly asleep. Lump, meanwhile, chose this moment to stir, cracked one eye open, sniffed Harry, and settled back in for another nap. This left Sirius and Draco in the doorway together.
Draco didn’t hear anything from Harry over the next few days. Amid tense requests for updates on the progress of their plan, Granger was kind enough to assure him that Harry was all right, just throwing himself into his work as a distraction. She even went so far as to say it was “nothing personal.”
“Eurgh,” said Harry, “I can’t decide if it’s creeping me out or getting me hard, but either way, this isn’t the best time?”
Draco had begun comportment lessons at the age of four, and had been practicing emotional repression since birth. Thus, he did not splutter. Pettigrew seemed to be imagining the splutter nonetheless. He drained his coffee blissfully, set it down with a smile, and left without paying.
“He ran to our place,” said Amy, gesturing to herself and the snoring cat. “This was tonight, by the way.”
And, oh! Harry was at his mercy. Draco could do whatever he liked. He could tie Harry down and fuck him hard until he was so hoarse from screaming that no sound came out when he opened his mouth to beg. Or he could stand here and kiss him softly for hours, then leave him aching without permission to do a thing about it.
“It is true that we snakes are cunning, that we thrive on silence and subtlety and sneakery and all that sibilant stuff, but, you see, it is not another snake I am attempting to woo.”
By the time Harry got home, his mind was all in a muddle, and he felt all his soreness catching up with him. Barely stopping to pet the cat, he made a beeline for his bedroom, stripping off his work clothes and getting into bed. The sheets and mattress were soft, the pillows pleasantly firm, the duvet fluffy and warm. This was the one luxury Hermione had been able to convince him to add to his otherwise average flat: a bed to rival the comfort of the surprisingly luxurious ones in the Hogwarts dorms. He had even got a canopy frame and, at Hermione’s suggestion, added swathes of soft grey gauze as a nod to the curtains he had become used to in school. Ron had commented that the bed looked like the set for a softcore porno, but Harry paid no mind to that. It was comfortable, and yes, maybe a bit romantic, and even though Tom had rather liked it, it still felt very much his own.
Silvertooth’s eyes lit up. “They’ll have me sitting at Ripjaw’s right hand for our next Counting Day feast if you are proposing what I think you are.”
“Yes, Father?” Draco shifted in an attempt to get comfortable. He was on his knees in Professor Snape’s office, his head in the fireplace so he could speak with his father.
“‘Lo,” he said as he opened the door, “I’ve just put the kettle--oomph!” His speech was interrupted when he was enveloped in an almost violent group hug by his best friends--and, he saw through Hermione’s hair, Ginny and Luna as well.
A little smirk surfaced. “Yes, Draco, I’m sure. I’m just having a really good time with you. Promise.”
“Well, Luna called,” Ginny corrected. “I texted.” Ginny really hated phone conversations--it had been part of the reason for her and Harry’s breakup.
“True,” said Harry, “But in this we’re friends. Or...comrades of a sort, at least. I’ll admit there are things we did in school I’m reluctant to forgive you for, and I’m sure it’s the same for you. But we’re in similar positions at the moment. I think we should try not to be enemies.”
“Marathi,” Sirius told him, “the language of the Indian province your family comes from, Maharashtra. That was generations ago. Your grandparents mostly spoke English at home, but they also spoke some Marathi and some Hindi, as did your dad. I picked up a few phrases at their house. Stuff like, ‘behave yourself,’ and, ‘you should eat more,’ and--” he cleared his throat-- “‘welcome home.’ I can teach you what I know.”
me,” Tom repeated slowly and clearly. “We both knew I was using you, and you let me. Are we clear now? Can we move on?”
He didn’t know how long he’d been sobbing; he only realized he’d been doing it when Draco began to make quiet, soothing shushing noises. Harry sniffled and looked up.
“We Malfoys seek our own highest good, My Lord, and serving you is, as we see it, the highest good of all.” Draco just barely kept a straight face, seeing how pleased Voldemort looked. Merlin, this was too easy. “The Malfoy family has, I am sorry to say, recently run into a little snag that may affect the cause as well.” This with a sombre tone and sad face.
“So am I,” said Harry. “I shouldn’t have been so quick to—I mean, I should have tried harder. To make you understand. To let you know that—however you feel, it’s okay. But. I need him, anyway.”
“Harry dear, there you are, so pleased you’re home, we need to speak. D’you know what I found in the sink today? Dishes.
“The Dark Lord, as his--as some called him, wanted only certain wizards to be in charge, the elite if you will. People like my family, whose families have been all wizards for generations. See, some wizards and witches are born to Muggle parents--but I needn’t get into all that now. Suffice it to say that the Dark Lord was prejudiced and cruel, sort of like your Hitler.”
“Look, Papa,” he said gently, “I know we can’t exactly go crying to Dumbledore over this, or--well, anyway. It was probably his idea to seize our assets in the first place. But if you trust me for just a little while, I can see this through so that we come out on top without getting dragged down by the pesky life-or-death conflict of it all. Family first, right? You trust me?”
After that they’d go to the clubs together occasionally, never touching each other, merely talking until the drinks kicked in and they could go find someone else to get off with. Then there began to be occasional coffees during the day. That had been the status quo—an uneasy friendship—until that night at the Burrow.
Draco laughed. “What a cliché.” But they decided to embrace it: a gold setting for the garnet, and platinum for the emerald.
“Of course not,” said Pansy, going to the kitchen counter where she had set down their takeout breakfast, “But
Reluctantly, Harry handed over the tequila bottle. Draco pointed his stick at it and muttered a nonsense word, and all the liquid inside disappeared. Before Harry could so much as protest, Draco said another word, and the bottle refilled with brown liquid.
“Let me see,” said Arthur, and his head disappeared from the fire for a moment, before it flared up and he stepped through.
Not that there weren’t plenty of other circumstances in which he wouldn’t mind being on his knees in Severus’ office. But those were thoughts for another day. A rainy Sunday, perhaps.
“Well,” said Draco, setting Salazar down and brushing soot off his trousers, “Here I am. You may begin your apology at your convenience.”
Draco looked on helplessly as Amy put a comforting arm around Harry’s shoulders. He wondered who it was that had made the decision to place the boy who should have been a rich, powerful wizard in a situation that left him a broken, desperate Muggle. He decided right there that, whoever it was, he’d have their head.
“I need to see the labs,” Draco admitted with little shame. “I’ve no idea where they are, but I know you have something to do with them."
“I can’t believe you still remember that word for word,” said Harry, even though he absolutely could believe it. Draco had the grace to blush a little bit at that.
Draco leapt out of his seat, springing up and sliding on his belly across the Headmaster’s desk to wrap the old man in his arms.
“Sure.” Theo paused; the elevator was slowing, but he held the doors closed for a moment. “What exactly have you involved yourself in, Draco?”
Draco smiled slightly. “I suppose it’s a bit of a silly name, if you don’t have the associations most wizards do with it.”
For a moment, the prospect tempted Harry. The blond was more than a bit of all right, and Harry was the first to admit he was a slut. It was part of his regimen to purge all Dursleyishness from his new adult life: get his own place, grow his hair long, and be as aggressively homosexual as possible. And he’d never been with someone quite as good-looking, or quite as strange, as the blond in front of him. But it was all a ridiculous fantasy. He had bills to pay.
, apparently, because everyone in this fever dream was posh--to splash some water on his face. When he was done, he looked in the mirror. Yes, that was definitely Harry Evans (Potter? No. Evans. That was the name he’d chosen for himself). His own green eyes, though red-rimmed with exhaustion. His own thin face, his own brown skin, pale and wan but certainly his.
“Oh. Right. You lot, this is Arthur Weasley. He can be trusted. Arthur--” Sirius ran a hand through his hair. “Can you come through?”
Harry and Amy watched in astonishment from their spot behind the couch. Draco was exchanging rapidfire beams of light--spells, they supposed--with the crazy woman--his aunt?--and blasting holes in the walls all the while. It was difficult to follow a fight so different from anything they’d ever seen, but Harry had an inkling that the woman was the superior fighter. As if to prove him right, Draco sent a last, attention-grabbing spell (it caused a miniature dust storm around the woman’s face) and retreated behind the couch. Before they knew it, Harry and Amy each felt a grip on their arms, then a horrible squeezing sensation as the world went black.
“That...doesn’t sound particularly scary, if I’m being honest, Haz.” Harry frowned at her. “If I’m being honest,” she continued, “it sounds kind of hot.”
“It’s a mess,” said Harry. When he saw Draco bristle, he added, “Not that I mind. Really. It’s just a bit funny. Not what I expected from you.”
“Forgive me my ignorance of the folk rituals of the middle classes,” said Draco, “but the matter is urgent.”
“It’s all right,” said Harry. “Listen, I’ve got to go. You know, got some kittens that need saving from trees.”
“All right, all right, we’re both clever. Now, are you going to tell me what’s so terribly wrong with the world?”
Harry had put in his notice with the Head Auror that morning. He couldn’t do it any more—fight, face the bureaucracy, bank on his fame, any of it. His adoptive family hadn’t understood.
. Tom, one of the few people in Draco’s orbit who had made his way there mainly on merit, had once again forgotten about the anesthetizing effect that growing up wealthy had had on most of his peers. Which meant that, through no effort of his own, the advantage was once again Draco’s.
A slight tightening of Tom’s expression told Draco that his slight had hit the mark. For a quick moment, Draco felt a bit guilty. Tom had it coming to him, but to mock his financial circumstances was low.
I hope this update amuses and edifies, and that it stands in as a token of my affection for you all, which is no less sincere for being so flighty.
“Sorry,” said Scorpius, and stood to get his luggage. Al squeezed his hand one more time and did the same.
Tom looked stunned. “Of course I care. Draco, I care about you. You’ve always been so good to me. I just--I can’t believe you would hurt me like this.”
Harry had been in the sitting room for hours when Draco finally stepped out of the fireplace, holding the Crup in his arms. Harry had a firewhisky, which he’d barely sipped, and a magazine, which he’d not even opened. When Draco came, he set them both aside without a thought.
Boyfriend, indeed. Draco vowed not to allow himself to slip up like that again. He could afford a lot, but he couldn’t afford that.
“And,” Scorpius’ father added, “the same invitation stands for Albus, and his family.” He gave a formal nod, which Mr. Potter responded to with a huge smile.
Draco made the call to Mr. Dobbs, his driver, while Pansy reapplied her lipstick in the mirror over his bar cart. Before leaving, she stopped and cocked her head.
“Call it a hunch.” They made their way up to Amy’s apartment, which was just as much of a shithole as Harry’s, if rather more charmingly decorated with its swags of tie-dyed fabrics and bead curtains in all the doorways. Add to that the stacks of books on the floor, the actual fucking lava lamp on the coffee table, and the fat cat lying belly-up on the rag rug, and it looked like a head shop owned by a former librarian. God, he
“It’s a rich and varied world. There’s room for Luna’s love of stone-cold weirdos, your obsession with jocks--”
“Pleased to make your acquaintance,” Draco responded with great formality. They looked into each other’s eyes, sharing a moment of deep connection, then broke off simultaneously, Hari giving an awkward laugh.
it is exactly that they’re testing. Granger would have a better chance of parsing the language and telling us exactly what it does.”
“No, Harry,” Dumbledore sighed, “For the fifth time, I do not believe Mr. Malfoy is in league with Tom Riddle any longer.”
“There’s a sign--” Amy cut herself off to make an alarmed squeaking noise. “You just walked right through it!”
Draco started so badly that he dropped his cigarette, then went to stomp it out only to realize, painfully, that he was not wearing shoes. He gritted his teeth against the sizzling of his foot and glared at the shadows, where a pair of green eyes glowed like a cat’s.
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry for the infrequency and unpredictability of my updates.  Work and mental illness are a bitch.  Thank you to my returning readers for your forbearance.
wouldn’t do. But Draco had a new way to avoid a Talk with Potter, and so far it had been effective. Time to put it to a further test.
“Harry,” said Aberforth, “answer me this. I won’t pretend it en’t a pointed question, you’ll see it from a mile off, but answer me honestly as you can. Your Malfoy lad. He ever use you for his own gain?”
On his way out, Draco steeled himself to avoid looking in the kitchen doorway. He imagined what he would see if he did: Tom hunched over a willow patterned mug, inhaling coffee fumes meditatively, the shadows of his long lashes brushing his cheeks. At peace in a way he never was with Draco present.
“The reason,” Harry croaked, finally, “is that I’ve missed you more than I would have believed. It’s just been a few days, but—they’re not good days, without you.”
, way to Lucius’ cold dead heart--he found himself hovering as Harry distributed goodbye hugs to a grim Ron and a steely Hermione.
Harry put a hand on the small of her back, a gesture of comfort. He knew that comments like that were just Amy’s way of coping with stress.
“I’d say it’s more like making love,” he said, and walked out of the store. He could hear George gagging behind him.
“It’s true, Dad,” said Albus. “He’s been doing so well in History of Magic that Professor Binns has actually started remembering his name!”
Draco knocked on the door, and Harry opened it. There was a moment of awkwardness as the two tried to decide how to greet each other, which ended with Harry going in for a hug and Draco fumbling it into a side-hug.
“No,” Harry agreed, “you’re probably right. But I wouldn’t have walked in alone.” He caught Tom’s eye. “Stupid of me. I should have woken Draco.”
Harry mewled, and they were both lost, adrift in a universe an inch to the left of their home. They let the heady air take them, leaving behind the scurf of sewers and wretched corners, the grime of decades between worn bricks, overtaking rooftops stained with centuries’ soot. They found a place, in that clear air, where darkness could not reach them; nor could they reach anything but each other.
Malfoy--Draco--who had looked him in the eye and said, “Not without negotiating first. For now, you’ll just have to control yourself.” Then his expression had shown a flash of uncharacteristic self-consciousness. “Er, if that’s what you want?”
They went home to Grimmauld Place, dressed for dinner, took one look at each other, and undressed. After showering, dressing again, and feeding the dogs, they arrived at The Burrow only five minutes past the hour.
devil, I think,” said Sirius, and Harry heard a clatter, turning to find his godfather placing a cast-iron pan on the burner.
“Nothing,” said Draco as innocently as he could. “It would be for aesthetic reasons. You’re too attractive to work in a place as ugly as that.”
Harry noticed how Draco stumbled over the name, and it gave him the shivers. As ludicrous as this all sounded, he could tell Draco was deadly serious about it.
Draco scoffed. “You defeated an immortal dictator when you were barely past puberty, and you’re afraid of your own children?”
Draco frowned. His father might talk a big game about the Gentleman’s Life of Leisure, but it was never, he had long since realized, the pursuit of ease that motivated Lucius. Rather, it was the pursuit of power. It never made much sense to Draco. Enough power to ensure one’s safety and comfort--that was a desirable thing, if one didn’t have it to start out with. But when one was born a multi-millionaire, the pursuit of further clout quickly became a laborious game of diminishing returns. But Draco’s father seemed incapable of staying on the sidelines. It seemed that Theo Nott Jr. was much the same way.
Harry had no problem at all withdrawing a sack of Wizarding coin from the French goblin bank (and, God, his life certainly had taken a turn in the past twenty-four hours). His curiously light new coin purse contained what Draco had assured him would be “sufficient” funds, and while he still didn’t fully understand Wizarding money, Harry was fairly sure he now held in his hands more money than he had ever had in his Muggle bank account at one time. Draco led him and Amy out of the bank through a bustling reception area and onto a crowded street.
“I’m being perfectly honest. Of course, some conversation and a night or two spent fucking you until you lose your voice from screaming my name would be nice too, but really, seeing you well set up would be its own reward.”
sideboards) and chose a bottle of whisky. She refilled both their teacups with it, topping them off with fresh tea.
“Me too,” said Harry, “though you’re going to have to start calling her Molly sometime, if she’s to be your mother-in-law.”
“All right, all right. I see your point. But—isn’t that just sort of the strangeness of the modern way? You know, blended families and...what is that rot Hermione’s always going on about?”
And from there, the evening roared on in a mess of food, drinks, congratulations, and interrogations. By the time dessert came, George had set off a few trick fireworks indoors, and Draco was attempting to drag himself back into the dining room with Victoire and little Molly, Percy’s eldest, clinging to each leg.
“I could have transferred it,” Dennis muttered as Harry followed him to the reception desk. Shooing Dennis away, he picked up the phone.
Angrily, almost in spite of himself, Harry grabbed his wine glass. As he drank, he rationalized to himself that it would be unwise for his now unemployed arse to turn down free alcohol. And the wine was nice--he wasn’t the sort to appreciate what made it different from other wines, but it was a bit fruity and obviously better than the swill he usually bought for himself. He gulped it down.
“She sounds great.” But Harry wasn’t sure what he meant by that, when actually he was horrified at the idea of conjuring a cupboard that shouted at you to do your chores. He didn’t particularly like the sound of his paternal grandmother, in fact. But judging by the soft look Sirius gave him, Harry’s instinct toward politeness had been a good one.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Draco assured him. “As soon as I knew who he was, I was already taking it under advisement.”
“I shouldn’t have let it happen,” she said. “You’re ours. My son, no matter what. I shouldn’t have forgot that.”
“Well then,” said Silvertooth with apparent relish, “I suppose I should begin by flooing the British branch for his records, shouldn’t I?”
“Whatever you’re having,” Harry said quietly. Draco made two martinis. Harry watched his back as he measured and poured and shook, and he found his gaze drifting to Draco’s arse.
“Believe it,” said Draco, wiggling into the space he’d commandeered on the Gryffindor bench between Seamus and Dean.
“Sit the fuck down, then. D’you want the vodka that tastes like antifreeze or the tequila that tastes like gasoline?”
“Yes,” she said, “but the sooner he knew about it, the more time he would have to prepare a defense. And possibly dispose of evidence. That’s why we were keeping it quiet.”
getting used to that?--and muttered something in Latin. An enormous, glowing silver wolf emerged and dashed down the stairs, moving straight through Harry. He was left with a euphoric feeling, grinning and breathless.
Harry was minding his business, walking down the hall, when suddenly he was pulled into an alcove by an inexplicable magnetic force. He crashed right into Draco Malfoy.
For those who have been waiting for an update, thank you for your patience. For those who just found this fic, welcome. I have no idea what's going on here either.
“Begin what?” Harry asked. He couldn’t help it--through his resentment, he was amused. It was so satisfying to see Draco out of his element, overpriced pub aside.
“So I’m sorry,” said Ron. “I’m sorry, because maybe I should have let you go then. But I didn’t. And now it’s too late. You’re stuck with us.”
In all honesty, Draco was flattered. Tom had overestimated him by a great deal. Pettigrew’s message implied a certain depth of understanding of the shadier aspects of their corporations’ mutual dealings--an understanding that, shallow or no, Draco did not actually
“Yes, indeed, My Lord,” Draco agreed, trying not to sound too eager. “It was in contemplating possible bridges over these troubled waters that I came across a plan that would, I believe, be of further use to you than simply restoring the Malfoy ability to...
“I need tea for this,” he said at last. “Come on, you lot. I’ve just put the kettle on.” Of course, he had to take the kettle back off in order to add enough water for five people, but he did so, and shortly the tea was steeping. For something to do, Harry opened a packet of hobnobs and loudly arranged them on a plate.
“That’s a shame,” said Draco, “as I’ve planned our entire menu for the evening. Do at least taste the wine.”
Ginny drained her cup. “Tom’s a bastard. I’m sorry he ever got near you, and, when you put it that way, I guess I feel sorry for Malfoy, too. I’m glad you two fucked it out.”
“This is far enough,” said Harry when they had stepped out of earshot of the cafe tables outside the doors. “What is it?”
Well, Tom probably had no intention of leaving the safety of his kitchen until Draco had cleared out of the apartment. With a resigned sigh, Draco quietly took the locket off the wall and opened it. Inside, cut into an oval, was an old photograph of a dark-haired man resting his chin on top of a red-haired woman’s head, looking fondly down at her while she smiled at the camera. Her eyes were the same startling green as Harry’s, but the rest of Harry’s looks were all his father’s, excepting that Harry’s father appeared to have been much taller than Harry would ever be. Tom would probably burn this if he found it. The spiteful bastard, thought Draco fondly. Well, it was a good shot, no need for it to go to waste. Draco slipped the picture into his wallet, then closed the locket and hung it up again.
“No. But considering the number of shares you own, I’m sure not even Dr. Pince could object to your taking notes--” Theo looked at him sternly-- “
, yes? At which point one is free to pursue one’s own desires until business recommences the following day?”
“Wha?” Amy grumbled, clutching a still-snoring Lump. Draco had paced to a corner, where he was literally pulling out his hair. Harry watched wide-eyed as Sirius fired a variety of charms at the shouting cupboard, none of which seemed to make an impact.
Harry shook harder, curled his hands into the cloth at the back of Molly’s dress. He hadn’t cried like this in years. Not since Tonks and Remus’ funeral, maybe, when he held baby Teddy and realized that he, like Harry, would never know his parents. No, not since then, in spite of all that had happened in between.
When Harry Flooed home he felt sick to his stomach and, what was worse, not at all drunk. He braced himself against the mantle and groaned. He heard footsteps: Draco fluttering about the house. The man couldn’t keep still.
“Yeah it can!” Ginny exclaimed, offering a hand for her wife to high-five. Luna did so with an indulgent smile.
“Uh, yeah, that’s the thing.” Dennis was talking even faster than usual; nervous, then. “The guy on the phone claims to be Lucius Malfoy? That’s why I’m checking with you first. Didn’t want to forward it if it was just some nutter, you know?”
He wasn’t suited to that, was the thing. Sure, Harry understood enough about the law to navigate it to his charges’ best advantage, but his strengths were really in discovering where a child’s best interests lay and then doggedly advocating for them. He’d had to learn the diplomatic skills involved, but the implacability came naturally. Puzzle-solving and sleuthing, though? For all he and his friends had gamboled about like Harriet the Spy and the Hardy Boys at Mallory Towers, Hermione was the logician and Ron the chess champion. Harry had only ever been nosy, restless, and awash with an indeterminate righteous fury.
They were both silent for a moment, remembering another of the reasons their relationship hadn’t worked.
“Perhaps it would be an allowable inconvenience,” Voldemort mused, “if we could be certain that Dumbledore would not discover the ruse.”
“Anyway,” said Mr. Potter, “I just wanted to let you know, Scorpius, that you’re welcome to our house any time you want to visit Al.”
“Of course.” Draco went to his bag--which he had deposited on a chair in the front room, Harry not possessing anything so civilized as a rack to hang it on--and retrieved the file. When he returned to the kitchen, he found Hermione already reaching for it, a grim look on her face. He handed it over, and she was immediately absorbed.
Harry laughed. Molly nodded again. Then she told Harry he was too thin, called Victoire back into the room, and sat them both down to be fed.
“That I do,” said Hermione. Ron’s face lit up like that of a puppy who had just been told he was a good boy, while Hermione took on the distinct expression of the cat who had got the canary. Harry couldn’t help but be happy for them, and did his best to bury all thoughts of Tom in favor of basking in the moment.
Harry took a deep breath and started his litany. “It’s all right. I’ve still got Teddy, Andromeda...Luna’s been lovely, and Neville’s been all right...we have the dogs...”
The martinis being poured, Draco turned around and handed Harry his. To his surprise, Harry found that when he took the glass, liquid sloshed over the edge. His hands were trembling. Draco took hold of Harry’s hand to steady the glass and tipped it to Harry’s mouth. He was never a fan of vodka, but it was a good martini.
Amy did so, and Draco pointed his wand at her, muttering to himself. By the time he was finished, her rainbow tie-dye sweatshirt was looking brighter, the hole in the elbow patched, and her faded jeans seemed to fit her a good deal better than they ever had.
nephew, boy, and I’ll do what I bloody well like to him!” Vernon roared over Petunia’s shushings and hisses.
have known. The Muggle families of witches and wizards are always told when they get their Hogwarts letters.” At the blank looks, Draco added, “Oh, Hogwarts is England’s school of witchcraft and wizardry. Everyone with magical talent in the country gets an acceptance letter when they turn eleven.”
“Enter,” said the voice from inside, and Harry did. He stopped short when he took in the scene: Lord Malfoy seated behind his outrageously oversized desk, and in a comfortable conference chair pulled up intimately to his side, one Tom Riddle.
“Fuck, let me get that,” he muttered, setting the scone down on the counter so he could crouch down to collect the cups and toss them in the bin. When he stood back up, he was looking into the eyes of a very offended young mother who was covering her sleeping infant’s ears.
“Anyway,” she said, “you’ve always been quick to judge. If you’d made the wrong choice, I’m sure you’d have noticed by now.”
“In some situations,” Draco conceded, “but not when the outsider in question is in fact a Gryffindor.”
“Or yours,” Mr. Potter sniffed. The two of them stared at each other for a moment. Scorpius and Albus exchanged a worried glance. This would be a bad time for their dads to start fighting again.
--else. In the meantime, he’d take his extensive notes home with him and try to get some sleep. He couldn’t help but clutch his bag to his side as he stood just inside the door, waiting for Dobby. With that notepad nestled inside, the whole thing felt unstable. Just because he didn’t know exactly what his notes contained, didn’t mean they weren’t dangerous.
Draco cringed, because he had a firm notion that he was supposed to do so. It wasn’t because of any genuine reaction--far from it. Just a reflex born of years spent hiding the fact that he didn’t vote.
The woman’s cheeks were bright red with anger. Harry expected her to ask to see the manager, but it was worse than that. Still silent, the woman dug her manicured paw into the tip jar and dug out the two-pound coin she’d previously dropped in.
“All right,” said Tom, “I can see you two are occupied. Harry, I’ll be in touch, all right?” Harry couldn’t react. He could only stare as Tom stood and walked out of the pub.
Harry stared at Hermione. “You can’t just expect me to roll out of Molly Weasley’s fireplace after two years for a little chat.”
Harry couldn’t help rolling his eyes just a bit at the proud, possessive way Greengrass said Lord Malfoy’s first name, drawling it just as Draco’s lackeys had done his when they were in school. Like it was such a coveted achievement to be cordial with one’s boss.
“Does everyone here drink?” he asked. At the others’ nods, he enchanted the bottle to pour for all of them. With alcohol and good food in front of them, Harry and Amy went quiet and began tucking in as if they’d been living on cheese toasties and cup noodles for years--which, of course, they had. Sirius looked on with concern while Draco tried to distract him with light gossip. This being a time of war, there wasn’t much to be had, and Draco kept trailing off in the middle of stories as he remembered one or more of the participants was now dead. It was so painful that even Harry noticed.
“Have a seat,” said Sirius, waving his hand broadly. Draco settled himself on what proved to be a pale grey canvas settee.
“Oh, now,” said Molly. She ran her hand through his hair in an old gesture, as if trying to flatten it. “None of that. I’m—I’m sorry, you know. It was wrong of me. What I mean to say is—old codgers, you know. Change. We’ve a hard time with it.” Harry gave a watery laugh.
“Well,” said Draco after setting down his glass, “now that we’ve established our mutual disdain, shall we begin?”
“Sadly,” said Draco, “the scientists at the Malfoy Company labs have yet to invent a reliable method of time travel.”
“There we go, pet. You like that? Like having my mark on you?” Harry nodded, and Draco nipped at his neck sharply. “Answer me, love.”
“What? Haven’t you got it now? Just give it here and we’ll have done with it, yeah?” said Harry, a bit desperately. God, he was tired of sounding desperate. When would he be able to put this whole mess with Tom behind him?
Harry gratefully slumped into a chair. It had been a draining morning, but even a rushed half-hour of lunch with Ron and Hermione could cheer him up immensely. And hopefully dispel the dark cloud of Tom hanging over his head, and get last night’s strange conversation with Draco off his mind.
It would be tight for the next week, but Harry actually had just managed to scrape together his rent money for the following month. With a sigh, locked his door behind him and walked down to the office of his landlord, Mr. Chatwal. He knocked and went in.
Three hours of arduous research--aided by a baffled Gerta--had yielded a disturbing result, though one that Draco, on consideration, should probably have expected. It
“What’s T--” the blond started, but then shook his head. “Ah, yes, the grocer’s. Right, well, I’m sure the edifice will remain standing if you beg off one night.”
Scorpius returned the gesture. “No, you’re great.” And then they were in a giggly cheek-kissing war.
“Lump!” Amy exclaimed, trying to make a grab for the cat. However, Lump wouldn’t come off of Draco’s shirt.
“Now, on to the matter at hand.” Dumbledore pulled out a box of pensieve memories and began to lecture Harry about the life of a young Tom Riddle. And Harry certainly didn’t spare any further thought that evening for Draco Malfoy and his surprisingly agile feet. No, not a thought.
“Now that we’re all acquainted,” said Draco, “I have a rather irregular request. You have heard of Harry, I presume, Silvertooth?”
“Ron, listen. I know things aren’t going to...go back to how they were. Of course. They couldn’t. But...I want my family back.”
“Sir, if you’re going to order anything, I’m going to need you to do so now. I’m afraid you’re holding up the queue.”
“Being gay isn’t all about the sex, Ginny,” Harry deadpanned. “I can’t believe you’re trying to fetishize my kinky hookup.”
It was at times frightening to see Tom’s great mental capacity at work. His processing speed was intimidating. At one moment he was the picture of innocent bafflement, and the next…
“Yeah, that’s the part of me most don’t like. The part that grew up abused and neglected and dreadfully middle-class. The part that struggled to learn to read. The part that got into common physical scraps with the other lordlings at public school. D’you remember that bit in
At his not-a-dinner-date with Draco, Harry runs into some surprising fellow diners and some even more surprising revelations. For example: who knew you were supposed to *sip* wine?
After their elaborate dinner, Scorpius and his father retired to the drawing room for a brandy. This was it. This was the time to tell him.
dark. It was beautiful: a huge flat full of open spaces and blond wood. The walls were ivory-colored, and huge windows framed by gauzy curtains let in the hazy glow of the city lights. Elegantly simple furniture was scattered with books, mugs, and various discarded scarves and jackets. And in the corner of the wide-open living room--was that a
When Harry emerged, Sirius immediately handed him a cup of tea. It smelled nice--definitely not PG Tips--and was in a genuine
kids--were under his protection. Tom wasn’t satisfied with just infecting his mind. He had stepped onto Harry’s turf.
“You’re right, Hermione.” Draco took a steadying breath. “My father won’t be any help on this. He can’t see past his own nose at the best of times. I truly am fortunate that I inherited more of his looks than his personality.”
Scorpius took a moment to compose himself before heading upstairs to dress. He breathed in, and breathed out. His father loved him. There would be plenty of wine at dinner. It would be all right. He would just tell his father that he was in love with Harry Potter’s son and...oh, Merlin, this was going to be a
“Pardon my asking,” said Rose, looking up from the glass of wine she’d stolen from her father, “but won’t this be a bit awkward? At least with the press? You know, all in the family and such?” she raised a positively Malfoyesque eyebrow.
And, aside from his parents, Pansy, and Blaise, Draco had had no one. The elder Malfoys’ coldness had been an expected thing, but at least Draco wasn’t banned from the Manor--merely discouraged from bringing his boyfriend home without prior arrangement (and ample alcoholic provisions). That was fine; he and Harry resided at Grimmauld Place most of the time anyway.
“It’s obvious,” said Luna. “He’s smiling when he thinks no one’s looking, but he walks like he feels guilty about something. He disappeared for the night directly following an emotionally distressing event. He also has a lovebite on his collarbone.”
“It’s a...difficult situation,” said Harry. He took a sip of his tea in the manner one might create a diversion in a battle. “See, my heart is in turmoil, but so is my cock.”
“Look, Harry,” said Draco, “Everybody in my fucking world knows your name. But we all thought you were dead.”
“Not like that!” said Harry quickly. “I just mean he’s...er...he’s so much more careful about it, but he’s...dominant.”
“Nobody wears pleats,” Harry grumbled, but he shrugged his thanks anyway, and they went on their way again. Harry followed easily enough as Draco turned into a little alcove that had a nondescript wooden door in it. Amy, however, stopped walking.
As it happened, Harry was enormously rich. It took several times going through his account statements and having Wizarding money explained to him for this fact to sink in, but eventually it
“I don’t like children, either,” said Draco. “Doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to run about and play, or whatever it is they do.”
Conversation over dinner was stilted, but a few glasses of wine and Harry’s excellent cooking eventually relaxed them all enough for a proper conversation. Once the plates were cleared and the kettle was on, Hermione addressed the elephant in the room.
“I understand why you are reluctant to believe me,” said Draco, “but my intention was not to insult you or to make trouble for you. Nor, even, to pay you to date me.”
. I mean--I can interfere with a raid here and there, but without being able to--is everyone okay? How’s Beatrice?” Beatrice was Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour’s young daughter, a child that had been in hiding since birth. She was a sunny strawberry blond imp, and a symbol in Potterwatch of everything they were fighting for. Especially in the years since Fleur had died defending her from a Death Eater attack.
Harry stalled out for a moment. He should probably go. He had work in the morning, and he didn't really know why he was here in the first place. Well, yes he did. He hadn’t felt safe alone. He could have called Hermione perhaps, but she would have taken forever to get there and would Draco have stayed and would Tom have snuck back in and would Harry have had a panic attack in front of Draco’s posh barman? Couldn’t be done. Nor could walking home alone. So he was here.
“It’s good to see you,” Arthur said gruffly. “We’ve worried, you know. Molly will be pleased you’re well.”
“Then I’ll have to pay you back,” said Harry. “It’ll take all year though. Here, I have the first month with me now…”
, he had almost said 'boyfriend.’ Tom’s eyes grew cold at his slip-up as he flicked Draco’s now spent cigarette over the side of the balcony.
There were touches of dawn light showing through the curtains, and Amy was still asleep. Lump was nowhere to be found. Most likely wandered off in search of food. A good notion, that.
“He was just trying to be polite,” said Draco, “but I decided there was no need for that, as the courtesy was not returned.”
Before Tom could respond, Draco jumped in. He looked right at Harry. “Don’t be ridiculous, love. You have a date to keep with me tonight. Tom can always find another time for a chat with you, can’t you, Tom?”
“WE MADE BISCUITS!” Victoire had a formidable shriek. She released Harry and ran giggling back to the kitchen. Harry followed slowly.
charm, ascertaining that they still had over an hour before they had to leave for the train station. He smirked.
“Bu’ that’s the thing. ‘E was one o’ my own, an’ in the end, I was grateful. No matter wha’, I’d’ve rather seen ‘im alive than otherwise.”
Molly gave another of her decisive nods. “If he’s good for you, Harry dear, then he’ll be welcome here.” She paused, pressed her lips together, and added, “no matter who I have to drag to the table by the ear to make it so.”
“What’s on your mind?” Hermione prompted, accepting that she was now on an official break from her homework.
“I went to Molly,” said Harry. “I thought about it for a while, talked to—well, just about everyone I know. Until I’d worked out what I needed to say to her.”
“Hmm,” said Ginny quietly, sympathetically. “I suppose you’re right that Tom wouldn’t be willing to be dominated. But as for Draco...you know, Harry, there
Theo shrugged. “In name, yes. In practice, I’ve the head for management, and he prefers to slum it with the lab technicians. So we reached an accord. Your father seems satisfied, to my knowledge.”
. D’you have to do everything the Muggle way? You know, you can just cast a cleaning charm and—oh.” Draco had finally come into the parlor from the hallway, and he saw the look on Harry’s face. “Bad talk?”
“Pigeon,” he said. “I’m trying a new thing, making pithy comments to passing vermin. It has a sort of maudlin, Cambridgean whimsy to it, don’t you think?”
And he kissed Harry, intensely, spinning him around almost balletically so he was crushed against the wall. Harry definitely hated every moment of it, and if there were choruses of angels singing in his ears and fireworks behind his eyes and stars and birds twittering around his head, that was just the effect of being slammed against a wall unexpectedly, now, wasn’t it?
“Honestly,” said Harry tightly, “I’m not in the mood to joke about my sex life right now. The world is upside down, my parents were murdered, we’re on the run, and I had family all the time and
“Were you talking to someone?” he asked. Draco contemplated telling Tom what had just passed. He loved Tom. He didn’t like to hide things from him. But sometimes it was necessary--like, for example, when a storm of temper threatened to ruin a decent night. So Draco decided to keep Harry’s confidence, Lord help him, for the moment.
Draco stared at Harry, his expression an insulting mix of pity and disbelief. Harry knew where Draco was coming from, though. It was hard, when one was in Tom’s clutches, to believe anything that was said against him.
“Well, yes,” Sirius agreed, “but that’s not what I was going to say. I just--it’s strange--it used to be called the Order of the Phoenix, but ever since Dumbledore--”
“All right,” said Harry, and he hung up. Dennis opened his mouth to ask questions, and Harry shot him a glare. Thus, he was allowed to return to his desk in peace. He promptly called Draco.
“True, but I like the way it kills the whole world.” Harry took another swallow, then laughed a bitter laugh. “And to think, an hour ago I was drinking wine that was probably worth a week’s pay.”
“No,” Harry agreed. Draco gestured for Harry to hand over his coat, then hung it in the hall closet. He went to a marble-topped bar cart that rested against the wall.
“Yes sir,” said Harry, still mischievous. He climbed onto the bed and stayed on his hands and knees, looking over his shoulder. “How do you want me?”
It sure would be nice if this could be resolved via due process...lol. This is a fantasy story, though, and revenge is quick and brutal.  At least, we hope. Tune in next time to find out of Narcissa is willing and able to save the day.
Draco brought his hand to his brow in frustration. “Perhaps you could explain to me how you came to that conclusion,” he said.
, and honestly just relieved to have someone to talk to. The conversation had been stilted, but there was a new undercurrent of understanding between them. Being a gay wizard was awful even without fame or postwar trauma. Neither of them knew anyone else in circumstances as close to his own.
help. He got up and took the coffee to the sink to dump it, smelling the caffeine and chocolate and spice and wishing he could drink it.
“Granger,” Draco greeted. “Decent of you to be here. Sorry I was a racist prick to you in school. I’ve recently come to the realization that personal growth isn’t only for the middle classes, and I owe you my first apology.” He turned to Ron and nodded. “Weasley.”
“You’re clearly upset,” said Amy gently, “and you’ve been drinking tequila, so I’ll tell him to bugger off, at least till--”
“All your idea, Haz,” she assured him. "Luna went to spend the night with Rolf, and you said to come over, that it would be like old times. Ron turned absolutely green, it was hilarious.”
“Oh,” said Sirius, deflating. “Harry, your grandparents were Hindu, and your dad, and your mum converted when she married in. The last time I saw you…”
You don’t always know when you’re living through a moment you’ll remember forever. This time, though, Harry
“You know,” she said, “if you can’t go back in time and drown Potter, you can always take option B and fuck him.”
“So where were you?” Hermione asked. “We stopped by your office at lunch, and Kingsley said you’d come in feeling poorly and he’d sent you home.”
At eight fifty-five, Harry stepped off the elevator into what looked like the waiting room for a million-pound plastic surgeon. Amongst the immaculate chairs and striped ivory wallpaper, a woman sat at an elegant wooden desk. Harry vaguely recognized her from school, the younger sibling of one of Draco’s hangers-on.
, and returned the hug. And maybe he cried a little, too. After all, he’d had a long day. A long life, really. When Sirius’ sobs had worn down to sniffles, he started talking.
In his surprise, Draco dropped his mask for a moment. Harry had to admit that, when he relaxed slightly, Draco was beautiful. With mussed hair and a sleepy smile, he would be something astonishing to behold. He wondered, vaguely, if Tom understood the value of what he was throwing away by treating Draco as he did.
“‘M here,” Harry said. Sirius grasped his shoulders and stepped back to look at him. It was an intense look; Sirius’ eyes were an unyielding gray.
“You want me to take care of you, baby?” Harry whimpered and nodded. “You’ll be good for me?” Another nod. “Good.” Draco wove his fingers into Harry’s curls at the back of his head and pulled the taut. “I’ve got you, baby.”
And now, he supposed, he had another ambition to hide: the ambition to have repeated liaisons with a man who, he was absolutely
“Oh yes,” Ginny nodded, “Second favorite. Or haven’t you seen Dean Thomas’ latest project with Stuart Semple?”
“I don’t understand,” said Tom, though the flicker in his eyes assured Draco that he did. “How have I hurt you?”
“Charming as this has been,” said Harry, still not looking up, “I’ve work to do before I turn in, so I’ve got to be going now.”
“This is a business matter, I’m afraid to say, not a social call. I was not perhaps very straightforward on that matter.”
Right then, Harry decided to forget, for the next few minutes, that he hated this man. He rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Perhaps we should sit?” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at Amy as if she were a society hostess making a gaffe.
“Look, Harry, this is...this is monu-fucking-mental. We need to talk about it, however you feel about me right now.”
“Well, no, that would be the English branch,” said Draco, “but I’m sure the goblins here would have no problem letting you borrow against it.” With that, he led them forward.
“What?” said Draco, “and leave him here, alone and unprotected, while we meet with Potterwatch? My aunt is on our trail as we speak. How safe do you really think this place is, Sirius?”
Draco sighed. “A secondary motivation,” he continued, “is probably to gauge the nature of your connection with me.”
“I’ve pondered that,” said Draco, “and I found a solution in what I must admit was one of my secondary motives for proposing this plan.”
“But,” Neville continued, “if Gran had kicked up a fuss about my marrying Hannah, I reckon I would have told her to go to Hell. It’s not Gran’s decision. I’m the one who’s got to live with her.”
“Good point.” There was a loud hiss as Ginny poured frozen happy face potatoes into the skillet. “Anyway, I think it’s good for her to have a place where she can let her excess weirdness out. Not that I mind it, but I can’t really contribute, you know?”
“How,” said Draco, now resurfacing, “are you keeping in contact with Potterwatch from outside the border? I couldn’t reach them from
“All right,” said Harry, some smoke escaping his mouth with the words, “I think we’re nearly pissed enough to listen to whatever it is you have to say.”
Was this just natural for Harry? Had Tom done this to him? Or was it stress? Or maybe...maybe this was just how he reacted to Draco? What a thought that was. Probably all of the above, Draco admitted to himself as he got to his feet.
“Can’t we just catch them?” Ron demanded. “Doesn’t seem like it should be that hard to take them down, given we have an informant.”
“Can we sleep first?” Amy requested. “I mean, me and Harry. Not sure if wizards sleep, but we mere mortals do.”
“We’re here,” he observed, still a bit high-pitched.. Al kissed him, long and deep. The whole world got warm and bubbly. Everything was very nice and soft and Albus-y and there was a hand on his back—
“Right!” Sirius jumped up. “Right, I’ll get us something. Any requests?” He turned to Harry. “Any favorites?”
So it was that he had to stop himself from smiling when the window rolled down to reveal one of his least favorite faces in London.
Draco went out to the balcony to smoke, wearing nothing but a pair of Tom’s silk briefs. It was stinking hot, the kind of weather that made all of London smell of exhaust and curry and sweat, and Draco swore if he sniffed deep enough he could smell a ghost of Victorian effluvia wafting off the Thames a few blocks away. He lit his cigarette.
I,” said Hermione. “I sound like your mum? And who was it who waited up for me when I worked late Tuesday, said he was worried sick, then proceeded to serve me
“Lily Evans,” Harry confirmed, his eyes distant. “And my father was James Potter. That’s all I know about them, really--their names. That, and the fact that they died in a car crash when I was a little over a year old.”
Draco pondered this. He’d always assumed that Potter’s little side projects in school--exposing corrupt professors, challenging ‘unfair’ school rules, campaigning for better benefits for the janitorial staff--had been animated entirely by Granger’s stubborn competence. It was, however, entirely possible that Harry’s top-heavy sense of justice and his tendency toward obsession had contributed just as much. Though Draco would persist in believing that Weasley, at least, had just been riding Granger’s coat-tails. That man was such a follower, he could toady for England.
“Certainly,” Hermione responded sarcastically. “Let’s just all knock on Lucius Malfoy’s door and see if he’s suddenly developed a soft spot for the underprivileged kids whose welfare benefits he’s consistently lobbying to cut while he tries to reduce the taxation of his multi-billion-dollar corporation. I’m sure that’ll go well.”
In which Draco goes into the office, and is only slightly tipsy.  Has he had a personality transplant, or is something darker afoot?
It was strange to see Tom in Draco’s flat. Not just because Tom hadn’t visited often, but also because of the previous night. Draco had bundled Harry out of doors quickly enough when the car had arrived, but Harry left a certain feeling behind him, something scuffed and homey, that showed no sign of dissipating. That atmosphere did not suit Tom. It didn’t make room for the dark seriousness he brought with him everywhere.
“If this is how you react to the first course,” Draco choked out, “I think I’d like to buy you dinner every night.”
Luckily, by the time Harry would normally have come home from work, he was decently dressed in pyjama trousers and an old band tee of Sirius’. He’d had a leisurely time recollecting the previous evening, then showered again, had a cheese toastie, and spent the afternoon napping. He had just now got up, and was puttering about the kitchen making tea. So when the intercom buzzed, he was not in a compromising position, which was good, because it was Ron and Hermione. He let them up.
“Best scarper,” said Draco to Harry. “I was planning on having a nice fag and slinking home, not refereeing a duel to the death, tonight.”
“You’re right, but, look--this isn’t a conversation we can have in the loo. Just come with me, all right?”
“Hold on, love. Let me just go tell whoever it is to bugger off, then you can finish your story.” Amy patted Harry’s knee, then went to the intercom.
“Here’s what we’re going to do,” he said, low and steady. “I’m going to play with you all I want, and you’re going to stay still. I’m not going to restrain you. You’re just going to stay still for me because you’re so good, because you want to please me, right, pet?”
“I see.” Harry gritted his teeth. “That was badly done, Lord Malfoy. You should have listened to your wife.”
” and then rapidly descended into sounds Harry could not distinguish. Draco responded in his gorgeous, fluent French and soon had the waiter leading them to a table, chatting rapidly all the while. That is, until he saw Harry and stopped dead, his handsome face turning white.
“I really won’t,” Harry said. “I’d prefer never to have met you, but forgetting you will have to do. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve a job search to conduct.”
“Glad to hear it,” said Draco. “You’ll like them, Amy. Luna’s a very generous soul.” She caught his drift and shared a wicked grin with him, but this exchange went blessedly over poor Arthur Weasley’s head.
No, he realized after a moment. That was him. Without realizing it, he’d begun to sob. Molly tightened her arms around him.
“Oh?” Draco’s voice lowered, and Harry could almost see him stretching like a satisfied cat. “Have you finally realized you need some down time?”
“The Khan case file is almost ready for review,” Harry told him hurriedly. “I’ll be in early tomorrow, I swear. It’ll be in your desk by the time you’re in the office.”
“This is what it’s come to, then, is it, boy? Whoring yourself out to rich ponces? I told you he’d come to no good, didn’t I, Petunia?”
Draco laughed a little, somewhere on the edge between nervous and sardonic. “We’re clear. As to whether we can move on?” Draco didn’t answer his own question, but rather moved to sofa, where he picked up a lighter and a pack of cigarettes from the coffee table and lit up.
“If you’d just let me pop in,” said Harry, stepping into the light a bit. Then he added, “I suppose Tom’s in the kitchen.”
“It’s a good plan, Draco,” said Lucius after his son wrapped up the explanation of his scheme. “I have only one follow-up question.”
Harry snorted. “We’re not quite at the point where he’s openly complimenting me. And if he was, I’d except something more along the lines of--” he cleared his throat and affected a posh accent-- “
Scorpius didn’t look at his father. Instead, he waved to the Granger-Weasleys—Hugo waved back and Rose winked at him—and turned to lead his father away from the platform. His father put a hand on his shoulder as they walked to the Apparition station, but said nothing until they were back at the Manor’s receiving room. An elf appeared to take the luggage, and Scorpius thanked him.
It was only hours later, when he had stomped back to his own flat and brooded for some time, that Harry realized he’d left the photo behind. He cursed aloud and started pacing.
Harry thought Luna’s statement would shock Neville, but realized almost as soon as he had the thought that that wasn’t how things worked--that wasn’t how
“The money,” said Harry, leaning toward Draco on his elbows as if he had been raised in a barn. “Take it back. I don’t want it.”
Sirius smiled wanly. “I said your hair was the most color I’d seen in twelve years. How did we celebrate when Fred and George came of age?”
“They can’t hold out on you forever,” Draco said. “Nobody could resist your ‘poor-little-savior’ act.”
“You doubt my charms, My Lord?” Draco asked neutrally. Voldemort looked him up and down, which, Draco thought, felt very much like the time he had been wanking in the Slytherin dorms only to look out the window and find the Giant Squid watching.
“That’s why everyone in the Wizarding world knows your name, even though they believe you died as an infant. The Dark Lord killed your parents, and then, when he apparently killed you, it backfired somehow. He lost his powers, almost died. Disappeared completely for a decade or so. Because you were, apparently, the last one he turned his wand on, you were celebrated the world over for defeating the Dark Lord. The Boy Martyr, they call you. People wear lockets with your picture in them, Harry.”
Without thinking, Hari reached out and traced the word printed on Sirius’ chest. He startled when the lion started to move, rearing up and letting out a silent roar.
Is this mostly setup for the really juicy chapter tome come next? Yes! Am I happy with it anyway? Also yes!
“It seemed prudent to approach you as a professional,” Lucius prevaricated. “I wondered if you could find time in your busy schedule to meet with me.”
Both were looking at him so intensely--and with matching grey eyes, Harry saw, supposing that was a sign of the family resemblance--that he gave in with a nod, following Sirius to a neat, untouched spare bedroom.
Harry needn’t have worried. When he got to work the next morning, he found another email from Draco’s secretary, requesting that he meet Draco again at the same pub the following week.
“Of course,” said Harry. “Please. I’m sorry--I didn’t mean--I mean, I didn’t even know I was thinking it until just now.”
grew up throwing money around. All I’ve ever wanted was a family and enough money to feed them. You’re the only person I love, Amy.”
off,” Draco muttered, as if arguing, though really he had moved to Harry’s belt now and was probably just stating his intent.
“Cold as a witch’s tit,” Pettigrew revised in his charmless manner. “Come on, we’ll give you a ride wherever you’re going.”
“I should go,” said Harry. He shouldn’t have been there in the first place, he realized all at once, though he couldn’t just leave the pub at the time. He had needed--
“And that is why you have come to me?” Dumbledore asked. Draco was wracked with another fit of sobs. “Now, now, dear boy, now, now, none of that. You will be all right. You have made the right choice.”
Harry grinned to see Draco getting along so well. After all, if he was going to join the family, he’d have to get used to the chaos.
Harry stared at him, and Draco stared right back. He’d felt so lost these weeks, and he’d done so many things that were alien to him, especially in the last few days. Stood up to Tom. Questioned right and wrong. Researched a business venture of his own volition.
“The interview,” said Draco, glaring at Harry when the other man laughed. “I have some questions for you.”
, desperately prayed--that Sirius had been right. That death would be easy. That, when his time came (
“Nope,” said Harry firmly, turning away so Sirius couldn’t see his lying face. “That cat is the devil.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and leaned against the counter on the other side from Sirius. “Where’s everyone else?”
“Hello, love. What’s the matter? Is this gentleman giving you trouble?” Draco’s voice was posh and ice cold.
Presently Draco finished his conversation and called Harry’s and Amy’s names, gesturing for them to follow him. They took echoing steps through the entrance hall until they found themselves turning a corner into a quieter, lower-ceilinged corridor lined with polished wooden doors. The goblin security guard opened one, spoke in low tones to the goblin--account manager, Harry supposed--inside, and then nodded for them all to enter the office. The room was bare except for a large desk and the chair in which its denizen sat--there weren’t even any chairs for clients. The security goblin shut the door behind them, quietly but with finality.
“Those places creep me out. What do they teach you there--how to whack each other with sticks and alienate workers from the means of production? It's a wonder you can even read.”
Ginny immediately went to the sideboard (purchased when he’d just moved in, because years of living with Petunia Dursley had convinced him that people just
“Hmm,” said Draco, “I’m beginning to see what the rustics mean by all their nattering about pots and kettles.”
“He only would have gotten in the way of our chat,” said Tom after an awkward moment. “I wished to speak with you in a professional setting, and I applied to Lord Malfoy for help.”
Harry swallowed. “Actually, I have something I want to talk to you about.” He paused, then added, “But...yeah, I mean. That--wouldn’t be bad.”
an interest before.” Draco examined his ghostly reflection in the sleek black elevator ceiling. “I’ve made a grave mistake, Theo. I involved myself in a venture, and now I find myself in need of content knowledge. And you know how I feel about that.”
“I’m a bit worried,” said Ron, “but we’ll let you talk.” Hermione sighed, but left with Ron. Luna kissed Ginny on the forehead before following them.
“We’re passing a window,” Lily remarked sourly. The boys immediately stopped and composed themselves. In fact, they restrained themselves to sneaking glances at each other until they stepped off the train.
“Certainly,” said Draco, who had at best only a vague awareness of such a thing, and then only because he had encouraged the connection as a way of keeping himself in bed with Tom, both metaphorically and literally.
“Well, then, Mr. Potter, do sit.” Silvertooth waved her hand, and three chairs appeared. Harry noticed her claws were covered in what appeared to be real gold leaf.
Harry’s reaction, at the time, had been similar. But later, when he’d gone to his heavily warded “Muggle room” and looked it up online, he’d been--well, he’d been what passed for delighted with him these days.
Yeah, I'm still alive. It's been a rough year, friends and nemeses. I'm suffering from a temporary disability that limits my reading and writing time. Readers of 'The Locket' will be either pleased or exasperated to know that story isn't abandoned, either. It will just take time.
