“You’re drunk, Potter,” Draco says, tearing his eyes away from the ceiling that Harry now notices has been enchanted to look like the night sky. "I don't believe I've ever seen you drunk.”
“My magic isn’t as reliable anymore,” Draco says. He’s unable to make eye contact with Harry, who’s searching his face for an explanation. “The drugs, they don’t help, they drain me.”
been in the summertime when he was more sure than ever that he wanted to leave the shambles of his marriage behind for something new. Something that challenged him in a healthy way. Maybe Harry wanted to leave him but couldn’t muster up the courage quite yet? Draco knew he’d be devastated if that were the case, but if it made Harry whole again, then so be it.
Ultimately, Harry found the trick was to hold the air deep inside of his lungs for some time before exhaling.
“I think you should go back upstairs,” Harry says carefully, guiding one of Draco’s arms over his shoulders for support. “Is someone up there with you?”
His heart quickened in his chest. His eyes fell to his hands, and then to the swollen red peppers at his feet.
If plants often deviated from most wizard’s innate understanding of what they healed, this could be his shot. The Silybum, or whatever it was called, could shut the voice up in his head once and for all. And if it didn’t work, then there would be no harm done.
Harry Side-Along’s Draco to his favourite, discreet Apparition point in Diagon Alley, the tug in his stomach settling as his feet touch gently down onto firm ground. Draco looks like he might be sick, and his cheeks are blue in the winter air.
“Well?” Harry questioned, searching for an answer within the expanse of Draco’s grey eyes. “Are you going to say something or are you going to just let me continue embarrassing myself?”
With blood curling crimson lines around his shaking fingers, he fumbles with the lock on the iron gate. His wand has been lost to the forest behind him, and Harry is reluctant to go back for it. If only Magpie had warned him that the mission could go so
“Ah,” Malfoy replies, knowingly. This time, he takes a sip of the whiskey, holding a hand out to offer it to Harry.
He was sick and angry and tired all the time. The voice in his head had grown hateful and resentful of everything that wasn’t to do with Harry. And what kind of a life was that? Answering to a subconscious that didn’t even have his own best interests in mind. A voice that caused him unending agony.
Eventually, he took a seat at a table with Ginny and Pansy, who were practically eye-fucking each other from their chairs. If he didn’t feel like a third wheel with Ron and Hermione, he certainly did whenever those two were around. Oddly enough, Draco came to his rescue.
“Don’t even start.” Harry massages his temples, falling into step beside Ron as they approach the elevators.
“Hi,” Draco said, in the most even voice he could muster. He moved his eyes upward, following dragonhide work boots, dark trousers, and red robes up to an unnervingly familiar face.
Harry had yelped, but Draco barely heard it. He felt hands touching his body, but he was far too hot to stand it, pulling away instinctively. Sharp feeling splintered through his forehead as though someone was exploring it with a blade.
The sun was just beginning its descent over the horizon, and the sky was the colour of a ripe tangerine. Harry thought it was beautiful, but Draco preferred pink sunsets because they were softer and slower.
“Draco,” Clove said, formalities aside. She cast a few charms that Draco recognised as diagnostics. “Can you hear me?”
actually causing it? As far as you know, this could be something subconscious. You may be more tuned into your innate desires than you realise.”
Nothing about the photo in front of Harry was soft or angelic, like many of her friends had described her when the department had interviewed them. One had noted she had particularly round cheeks, making her look young and full of light.
“But you know they put you in a tough situation, right?” Harry asked gently as if Draco were going to fracture under the pressure of his question. He’d gone glassy-eyed, and Harry was worried. “You did what you could to survive, I understand that.”
Draco smiled back, a small upturn of his lips that, to anyone else, would have seemed unfriendly. Harry would know that there was more to it.
Harry breathed, counting the numbers out in his head as he inhaled and exhaled. It was a trick that Hermione had taught him to use whenever he felt his patience wearing thin, and usually, it worked like a charm. No such luck now.
Cannoli would be an unexpected dessert to bring, and not quite something classically warm and cosy during the winter. But Pansy
“I know,” Draco says, focusing his eyes down on the cutting board. “But I don’t like to leave any debts.”
Harry had been possessive and angry the entire time, but he allowed Pansy to cart him around the house like a show horse. He loved her. At times, maybe more than Draco himself. He found himself feeling a little angry at the closeness of their touch, the secret smiles they shared. Harry was so much
Though her house arrest had ended a few years before, she still hardly found the time to venture out into the wizarding world. It had been a big step, the first time Draco had asked her to meet for coffee in Diagon Alley. Harry had been present, probably the only reason the Malfoys weren’t harassed that day.
“I guess Draco was going to stay at Ginny’s, but then he didn’t. He told her that he would come by in the morning and stay for a while until he could properly sort things out for himself. He never showed, and well, Ginny
If Draco wanted him to have these flowers, Harry figured he knew what that meant. Even if it was a practically unbelievable thought.
Snape does not bother to fake surprise at all and merely offers, “There is always a fine line between love and hate. You, of all people, should know that.” He leaves the tower, black robes, and all billowing behind him.
“You’re an open book, I don't need any inner eye to see right through you...sweetheart,” Ginny Mocks how philia says sweetheart, trying to see where the boundaries are.
“Philia, you need to stop saying shit like that…” Ginny says seriously, somehow prokoving the little bit of humanity Philia has left in her heart.
Dumbledore nods and returns to the teacher's table as food starts to appear on the silverware spread out along the tables, Philia digs in and the Ravenclaws observe her further.
“Come now,” Narcissa urges Draco and Philia. They follow their Mother and Father through the wall portal and the throg of more people on the other side surprises Philia. She doesn’t enjoy crowds, or people, she likes her own company because it is enough and it is quiet unless you count the things happening inside her head, “I’ll send you both owls when I get the chance, I hope you make Slytherin, Philia, please dont pull one of your little… tricks”
“Please don’t tell me you fancy him?” Philia groans, Millie shakes her head in disgust, “Good, besides he’s done worse to me…” As she says the words, Philia can almost feel the scar that starts at her collarbone, trailing under her arm and all the way down her back, burning. It had not been completely Draco’s fault that that happened, but she still blamed him.
“What's that? Did I just hear there is something you don't want to destroy?” Ginny asks in a teasing tone, a hand held up to her ear.
“Course not, Ma!” Philia says, fake enthusiastic, she turns to her Father and takes her trunk, “I think I’ll go now, please don’t talk to me Draco, I don't want people to know we are related, you know?”
As she goes up the stairs she almost loses her footing, making a slight thud as she catches herself. Philia's heart leaps at the sudden sound she has made, pressing herself against the shadows as a voice comes from inside a dorm. The said dorm door opens and a boy peers around the hall, Philia has to hold in her laughter as she goes unseen. As soon as the door shuts again and the light under the door of the dorm is off, Philia continues, being more careful now.
“You need to clean up your act young lady, if you get kicked out of this school too I will be forced to punish you further,” Her Father warns as she collects floo powder in her hands, letting it run through her fingers.
“Miss Malfoy, that attitude is not accepted in this class so unless you wish to not participate at all I recommend you sit,” Professor hisses back. With gritted teeth, Philia sits, pulling a face that could mean ‘happy now?’. This is the only class Philia cares about, getting kicked out isn't an option.
‘Hello-o-o-o-o-o you are looking so fine, so fine, fantasy about you is like a gold mine, gold mine…’ The song sings.
“I was trying to,” Philia mutters, finally catching a look at Ginny. Immediately she is surprised, Ginny is not what she had been expecting, she has sleek ginger hair, toned arms and her skin was littered with freckles that Philia thought were endearing.
“She’s right!” Philia looks a little further down the table and sees Cho from earlier, “She doesn’t think like a Ravenclaw, act like a Ravenclaw or talk like a Ravenclaw! She doesn't even look like a Ravenclaw!”
“Hold on, your brothers have a band!” She exclaims, Ginny looks bewildered again, “Why have you never thought to tell me this?”
Philias day does not start well, but when does it ever? Her first two classes were awfully boring and about things she already knows. She managed to finish the homework for divination before class had even finished, so she doesn't have to worry about that at least. Although she doesn't need them, Philia hasn't made friends,but she has made enemies. Cho, whose last name Philia now knows is Chang, for example. Philia and Cho got paired for a herbology experiment, let's just say that Cho had to take a quick trip to the hospital wing after their experiment broke loose. Philia was, however, hopeful her next class would be a success. Apart from the fact they had Gryffindor for astronomy (they’d had them for divination too but that had gone smoothly), Philia couldn't wait for her favourite subject. Despite not caring about school whatsoever, astronomy really intrigues Philia. She thinks she will get a new ring as a promise to the stars, the rings she has at the moment are all quite old. Her favourite is an oval shape with Celtic patterns wrapping around the ring and around a circular green gem in the centre. Her other rings include thick rings with words engraved into the inside where you can't see, rings with little gems wrapped in silver, a flower ring with swirls that wrap all the way down her finger and a ring that looks like a piano is wrapped around her finger.
“How do you spell your name? What does it mean? I’ve never heard it before,” Ginny asks, after writing her own name.
Philia ignores her Mother and throws the floo into the fire, she whispers, “Kings Cross Station'' and steps into the fireplace. The warmth from the fire momentarily makes her feel alive before she steps out of the fireplace of the office of Kings Cross Station, she is careful so she doesn't attract attention as she creeps from the shop unnoticed. She waits for a few seconds and her family emerges soon after. Kings Cross Station is more busy today, of course, because school is starting up again at Hogwarts. This will be Philia's first year at Hogwarts even though she is almost sixteen because she was going to Beauxbatons Academy before they rudely banished her. She had been sent to detention many times for rude remarks, or pushing some of the girls around, but this time she had actually lit a girls hair on fire in class. Philia had an obsession with fire, she loved it. It is simply magic in itself the way it flickers and needs oxygen or it dies. Kind of like people. People are flames and perhaps the wicks of candles are their souls…
The boy looks taken aback rather than mad, his two friends don't seem impressed either, Philia decides to ignore them and look around her surroundings. The trio immerse into quiet conversation, laughing at intervals. Philia wouldn't admit to it, but it does make her the slightest bit self conscious.
“What!?” Ginny bursts, face contorted in disgust. Philia is doing the same, “You’ve got to be kidding me..” Ginny mutters as she collects her things and joins Philia. As the professor continues through the names, most people start with their essays and research meaning the attention and beady eyes that were once on Ginny and Philia are gone.
“Good Afternoon class, today's astronomy session will not be for examining the stars, of course as it is still light, but we will start looking at the REM properties and we will be working on an essay assignment focusing on different magic astronomy holds. Some of you might know that astronomy is one of the most important forms of magic, without REM and the moon, our magic would be far less powerful and almost non-existent...” Professor Sinatra carries on talking about the magic of the moon and stars and the lessons for the year and Philia listens intently, “Anyway, for the essay I will be putting you into pairs, the pairs will have one person from Ravenclaw and one person from Gryffindor, to shake things up a bit!”
Nyctophilia doesn't sleep or fake sleep for the rest of the journey, instead she sits looking out her window trying not to think or fidget. No one else disturbs her on the train ride so the next time she sees anyone is when the train stops at Hogsmeade Station and students start bustling down the corridors to get out. By then darkness has fallen and a few teachers are standing around with lanterns directing the first years and other students. Someone takes Philia’s trunk and she follows the other students her age to a little road that has lines of carriages. She doesn't have much choice as to who she is in a carriage with, but doesn’t take much notice, too busy observing the peculiar creatures pulling the carriage.
Cho doesn't say anything, she just stares into her plate. Satisfied, Philia smiles, sits back down and continues to eat.
“I’m sorry that you dislike the Gryffindors, but I think this project will be very beneficial,” Professor Sinistra insists, unfazed by Philia.
Once at the second to last dorm, Philia whispers 'Lumos' and steps into the room. She feels exhilarated, like a weirdo lurking in the shadows. She is a weirdo lurking in the shadows. Examining the faces, she sees Draco quickly. Face contorting into a grin, she creeps over and puts a spell over Draco so his face has drawings all over it. The drawings include: A penis (of course), the words: I love Potter, arent I gay and multiple other doodles that Draco will have trouble getting rid of.
“I don't know, but my brothers have a band, that could be it,” Ginny suggests, and Philia starts to get more excited.
“We should give her space, Ginny,” Says the next voice. Philia guesses that Ginny is the girl Weasley that Draco had told her about. She doesn’t believe the bullshit he says but she gets an impression of Ginny quickly even so.
“Philia!” Draco yells from downstairs of the Malfoy manor, “We have to leave in 20 minutes, are you even out of bed?”
Once at the brick wall that leads to the common room, she whispers the password Draco gave her. She didn't think it would be the real one, knowing Draco, but surprisingly it works! The wall opens up and Philia scrambles in before the wall shuts again. She admires the common room, although it's dark, the green looks splendid. Next, she takes on the task of trying to find Dracos dorm. It wouldn't be a real adventure if she did not tamper with her brother while she was there. Who knows when she might get another opportunity like this?
Snickering, Philia leaves, excited for the reaction she will get tomorrow. It's most likely Draco will realise it was her pretty soon, but for now, she can rest contently...
“Lets just leave…” Cho whispers, so Philia enjoys the sound of the door clicking shut and ther feet pattering down the hall.
“Oh yes it did!” Philia lies, keeping her face innocent and mediocre, “It was a little confused at the start, but then it chose correctly” Philia smirks, that was less of a lie. Dumbledore doesn't look amused.
“Good bye room,” Philia mutters as she leaves, she hates her room, even if it's the place she spends 95% of her time. It's dark, dank and cold, kind of like her. As she slides down the staircase banister, Philia sees her angry Father waiting with her trunk at the bottom, her impatient Mother and Brother are there too. She walks right past them to the fireplace, shrugging and asks, “What?”
“Ah, Philia?” The quiet girl from Philias dorm, whose name turns out to be Millie, taps Philia's shoulder cautiously. The pair had not really made friends, but simply copied each other's homework for Herbology that morning, they related in the fact that they both despised Herbology. So they sat together for breakfast.
“It's a shame, Professor, that I don't care what you think,” Philia says this as if she is simply commenting on the weather, with a slight smile.
“Its-its, Albus she’s killed it!” The lady stutters, holding out the hat to Dumbledore in distress. Dumbledore takes the hat and examines it carefully.
“You disgust me,” Spits Draco, his hands gripping so tight Philia is sure they'll be leaving bruises. She doesn’t let anyone push her around, not even her brother.
“Manners! But I can't, at the moment the band is just them, Lee and me so it's not really official,” Ginny says, putting out the fire she’d set a light inside Philia.
After the feast, Philia follows the Ravenclaws to the common room that will now be hers. Once the door to the common room opens, Philia is delighted by the room, it's bright with large windows, lots of books and has a piano too! Blue is a good colour and it features throughout the room. Her utmost favourite part is that when she looks up, the ceiling is peaked in a beautiful arc with paintings of stars all over. Philia goes up the steps to the girl's dorms, she doesn't know what dorm she is in, but she finds out soon enough when outraged voices come from behind a door. She goes inside and sure enough, her trunk is sitting on a bed where the other girls look annoyed, except for one who sits on her bed in a bored manner.
“No, I mean for you, who would it be for you?” Philia feels her butterflies swarm, but she maintains her cheeky, teasing tone.
“Of course I am, nitwit!” Philia screeches back, then whispers, “Up, but not dressed, ready or looking ok… or feeling it”
“Hush! Silence everybody!” The noise dies down until everyone is either looking at Dumbledore impatiently or Philia accusingly, “We shall keep the first years in the hall for tonight to settle dorms, but the rest of you are going to be kind and patient until then, let's enjoy the feast and I will hopefully have the hat fixed by morning”.
"Please do, Potter. I'd do anything right now to be in my own bed, away from all of this shit," Draco pointed at the Hogwarts interior disgusted.
place," Draco raged. Harry didn't bother speaking. Just nodded and carried on walking. "Oi potter, I swear this is the first place you ever saw Voldy," Draco mused, his lizard print shoes trudging against the wet floor of the forbidden forest.
"I already hate myself," Draco said bluntly- finishing the bottle of Fire whisky in one sip. Harry decided it was time to stop beating around the bush. He needed to get Draco back to his house. All he needed to do was grab Malfoy onto his fight them guide him in the right direction.
Harry began reading the tale of the three brothers and before they knew it Scorpius was flat out breathing steadily. Harry and Draco moved off the bed steadily- careful not to wake the sleeping boy. Harry turned to Draco and sighed.
“Well, now the baby’s deaf,” Draco said rubbing his ears and rolling his eyes. Harry ripped up Draco’s shirt and laid in front of Draco’s kneeling position to stare at his stomach. “You won’t be able to see anything,” Draco said shaking his head at his boyfriend’s foolish display. “I only found out today.”
“The flask had Veritaserum in it, Hermione told me it would be a good prank,” Harry said then groaned. He started to realise that this was a bad idea.
“We kick them in the balls so they can no longer reproduce,” Draco muttered under his breath. Harry slapped Draco again and Scorpius giggled loudly.
Draco walked into the sitting room looking very nervous, his eyes were still watering slightly and his palms were sweaty. He was so excited to tell his boyfriend but was also very nervous- they weren’t married and this definitely wasn’t planned.
“Of course, I didn’t,” Harry muttered. “it’s a muggle thing like you said, it’s a word for someone whose parents aren’t married. Its quite old, I’m surprised people still use it,”
Harry laughed out loud and kissed Scorpius on the nose then went and kissed Draco on the nose. “Scorpius, when somebody says something mean to you what do we do?” Harry asked.
"Oh no, you don't, potter. I have enough people psychoanalysing me- I don't need 'st. Potter' at it too," Draco huffed. "How's it feel to be the hero you always wanted to be. Finally destroyed Voldemort. What are you going to do now you aren't running around saving the world. Is that why you came here; to help me?" Draco sneered and finally made eye contact with Harry, for the first time that night. Harry's piercing green eyes meeting Draco's ice grey ones. Something was different about this though. Something was missing- all of the hatred seemed to have gone. He didn't see an angry frustrated boy desperately trying to please his father, he saw a broken, hurt boy who looked completely vulnerable. He was hurting, it was obvious no matter how hard he tried to deny it.
Draco pulled Harry into a bear hug. “Don’t you dare start crying on me, you soppy thing,” Draco said rolling his eyes.
A centaur behind them cleared his throat. He looked extremely awkward. “Uh, Hagrid wanted me to tell you that your detention was over,” He mumbled. Before walking away the centaur mumbled,
Harry looked up at Draco and Harry’s eyes were overflowing with tears. “Draco, we are having a baby,” Harry said smiling and pulling his boyfriend onto him gently.
“I can’t wait to use magic,” Scorpius said. They hadn’t even started reading the book yet but Scorpius’s eyes were drooping.
"He has been at it for two weeks, Ron. Walking up and down Hogwarts aimlessly," Harry pleaded. "I don't care what you think, I'm going to see whats going on, Hogwarts could be in danger. Again," Harry said matter of fact. Ron gave up. He knew no matter what he said nothing was going to be able to convince harry to drop it. Harry pulled out the marauder's map and left the common room. He walked quickly, constantly referring back to the map- constantly trying not to bump into Filch. He finally arrived into the dungeons to see Draco Malfoy sitting on the floor with a bottle of Fire whiskey in his hand.
“You’re rather impulsive. Like your father.” Snape tacks on, but there was no malice behind his words. It was merely observational.
Draco didn’t want to sit in the dirt, though it seemed like there wasn’t another option. He thought back to the night before, where he’d done so much willingly and openly without much consideration. It felt unfair to surrender to those feelings now.
Harry nodded because that felt real, and his cheeks heated with warmth. Draco smiled softly, and Harry couldn’t help but admire the little crinkles by his eyes when he did. He didn’t smile often, so they were faint and all the more exciting to see.
“We should dance,” Harry says breathlessly, pressed up against Draco’s side in the packed room. He’s surprised that he doesn’t feel overwhelmed. There’s a pervasive sense of calm. He knows he’s okay, and that Draco will have his back if he isn’t.
Draco’s eyes snapped up to meet themselves in the mirror. The voice had never spoken out of turn, never unprompted.
The tiny and petulant milk thistles had decided to be uncooperative, but Draco was determined to make them work with him. Neville had told him that they were highly regarded for their medicinal properties and to pass said information along to Harry.
“I came to see you,” Harry says truthfully, because he’s never been the best at lying and something tells him Draco will notice that.
“I just – well, I wanted to know what you meant when we were outside of McGonagall’s office a few weeks ago.” When Draco looked back at him with uncertainty, Harry bit the bullet. “I mean, like, why did you get angry with me? You said this was supposed to be your year. I wasn’t sure what exactly that meant.”
Harry knew that couldn’t be good, and he was bordering on nauseous by the time Pansy decided she was ready to dive into a different conversation.
Harry was silent for a moment, but when he went to speak, Draco was already unfurling from his ball.
Zabini rapped his knuckles against the door, and they waited. A few seconds passed, and Zabini tapped again this time insistently.
“It’ll be fine,” Pansy says, though Harry never trusts her enough because she’s always been an ultimate defender of Narcissa. “She’s not the warmest woman, but she has a good heart.”
Harry can practically see Draco riding out his high as his breaths turn shallower and shorter and time passes between them too slowly to make sense.
Harry looked at him, open-mouthed from across the table, his green eyes fearful. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to speak.
“I never want your tea again, Harry,” Draco whispered, and nervously sidestepped another attempt at physical contact. “I-I’m going to go. Please,
“I want you to be able to talk to me if something is wrong,” she said, looking down unhappily at her heels. “I know I can come on too strong, but I care about you. I’m sure you would act the same way if our situations were reversed.”
On screen, London was displayed like a charming advertisement for a bed and breakfast. The reality was a little different. But Draco’s eyes fixed upon the television, rapt with attention. It was clear he liked Julia Roberts' character the most. She was beautiful, cautious, and refined. Something like Draco himself.
“I noticed you liked them,” Harry says at the confusion in Draco’s face. “And I could do without them.”
“Just friends.” Lavender smiles gently. “Soulmates, but we’ve decided to keep it platonic. We love each other, of course, but it’ll never be romantic.”
Something mischievous glinted in Draco’s eye before he launched himself upon Harry, tackling him at full force. The two wrestled for mere seconds before they rolled off of one another and onto their backs. The October air was cold, and the weather was grey with storm clouds. Still, Harry and Draco preferred to be outside.
sorry!” Harry cries, his body quivering with emotion and helplessness. He screams for help until his voice goes raw, but it is becoming clear that no one can hear him.
“You shouldn’t be around me, then,” Draco says plainly. “I’ll only hurt you more, and Harry, you deserve someone so wonderful. Someone who’s as good as you, who’s worthy of you.”
Pansy catches her bottom lip in her teeth, and she looks too scared for Harry not to start panicking. “He’s always like this the morning after,” she says, “but I think he might’ve taken something bad. He always sleeps it off, or at least is responsive when we talk to him.” She wrings her hands.
In recent days, Draco made his decisions based on his head-demon, which he had named with a vengeance.
Harry’s not sure how he remembers, because he’s certain that he and Ron had fucked around during this seminar of Auror training, but he works mechanically. He remembers what Hermione had mentioned to him at Hogwarts, how wizarding curatives couldn’t work properly when it came to Muggle substances. Especially with a rise in substance abuse after the war, it was precisely why Aurors were taught to administer Muggle medication.
“I am,” Harry says. He notices a glass of water is already on the nightstand, bringing it up to Draco’s lips and tipping his head back with care.
“I killed him.” Harry feels tears prick at his eyes once more, but the last thing he wants is to cry in front of Snape. A part of him doesn't care much anymore either way.
Draco’s legs wrap insistently around his waist, fucking himself gently back and forth on Harry’s cock. Harry sees stars, leaning forward to explore Draco’s mouth with his tongue, but he stays still.
“Ewyss hasn’t been assigned?” Ron asked, peering out from behind Harry’s back. Seamus turned to him and reached a hand out in greeting. He gave the same to Harry.
just danishes, are they?” Harry asked weakly. “We’ve grown apart, and yet I still try at every corner to win back your affections because I love you that much. I planned this stupid party just to make you happy, and all you had to say was that my decorations were cheesy.”
“That’s what I thought.” She huffed, pulling her arm free and marching out of the common room through the portrait.
The house warms almost immediately at Draco’s presence, and Harry finds himself irritated at the fact that it’s often so stubborn with him.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat, his eyes presumably wild with a panic that Carrow drew continued arousal from.
Instead, he rocked into him feverishly, tracing down the hard lines of his ribcage and across the scars left by
“I do know that, and I don’t need you telling me so,” Malfoy said, meeting Harry’s gaze for the first time in a while. He cleared his throat, “I guess I have to forgive you if we’re going to finish our project. We are still not friends, though.”
A few preset charms to the tent had banished noise from the other room and the commotion outside. Silence and tension were laden thick in the air.
“I do,” Draco conceded, and Harry could tell the potion had wrenched the answer from him entirely. “You’re probably right.”
Parkinson’s eyes were frenzied, but Zabini remained collected and calm. Perhaps this was why he was much more frightening to Harry than she was.
. Something about that felt ominous, and Harry waited for a sign that maybe Draco would return even a fraction of the feelings he had. That he wanted to be friends, more than friends, outside of their assigned project. No such sign presented itself, and Harry was growing impatient.
Their relationship had been better than it had in years, and Harry had the dutiful seller at the apothecary to thank for that. He still hadn’t offered up any information on potential suppliers to the Ministry, because, well, that would be too dangerous.
“Yeah, Harry, I have to say this isn’t much of a surprise,” Ginny said through a mouthful of roast she’d snagged from Molly’s slow cooker before the meal. “You were always obsessed with each other. Anyone with eyes would have noticed.”
Hermione barely glanced at Harry and Ron as she led Delaney from the room. Her mind was, rightfully, elsewhere.
Harry’s mind went to a happy place first. Before he knew it, he was sitting up slowly and bending over on top of the blonde. He reached down and experimentally planted his mouth on Draco’s. The first thing he thought was that they were nothing like Ginny’s. Draco’s were somehow softer, but his lips were thinner. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the high or his subconscious, but he instinctively pressed harder at Malfoy’s mouth and teased the boy’s lips apart. Draco’s hands went to his hair immediately, tangling in a mess of brown curls. He pulled sharply, and Harry let out a soft moan into his mouth. It felt so unbelievably right, like the best thing Harry had known in the entire universe. Draco kissed him back feverishly. Harry loved every second of it, how Draco’s tongue explored the back of his mouth and the way he found himself groaning into every little touch.
“Do you want me to come with you?” Hermione asks, her forehead instantly creasing with worry in response to the expression on Harry’s face. “You look a bit pale.”
“You’re lost without me,” Harry continued, trailing rough and calloused fingers down Draco’s dress shirt, toying with the button of his waistcoat.
“You’re not alone, you have me,” Harry said firmly, eyes searching Draco’s for any semblance of agreement.
“Oh, bugger off.” Pansy huffed. “Now that you’ve offered yourself up, though, as my personal errand boy —”
Harry didn’t have to look at her to notice how heavy her gaze sat on himself, as though she wanted to force a confession out of him. Ginny always noticed things, and Harry hadn’t accounted for the fact that she and Draco had been close for years. She knew him, often better than anyone else.
Draco relaxes a bit at the explanation, but he still refuses to draw his gaze back up. “I know,” he reassures. “I’m doing this for myself, first and foremost.”
“Draco, I know you heard him. Come out,” Zabini called out in an almost affectionate and encouraging tone.
Harry sits with the silence for a moment, and Draco leans back down on the pillow. He pats the open area next to him, and Harry lies down, too. It would be more strange if there wasn’t a valley of space between their bodies.
“Sorry.” He shrugged, picking up speed as they followed signs to the downtown area. “I’m not used to people saying that yet.”
There’s one room that has light seeping out from underneath the crack. Harry knocks gently, and there’s no answer from inside. He knocks again, this time a little more forcefully. He underestimates his own strength, because the door seems to open just a bit, and Harry pushes it forward without much of a second thought.
Harry nodded in response, mouth dry and tongue brittle as he struggled to find the correct words to say.
He’d been avoiding Ginny at work for weeks on end, and she’d decidedly taken the hint. She was the type to hold grudges and would likely be stubborn enough in her resolve to not bother apologising before he did. Either way, Harry had suggested Draco cut his time down with her, and for God knows what reason, the voice in his head had forced him to listen.
“Would you like something to eat?” Luna asks. “I made Neville and Seamus grilled cheese sandwiches with fresh truffles, earlier this evening. Draco seems to have a whole stock in the pantry. He accumulates some amazing things.”
It wasn’t something he would usually do, but the voice in his head insisted on physical affection. So Draco supposed it was he who cared about physical affection too. After all, whatever voice resided in his head had to be his own.
“He weighs nothing,” Harry says tightly, aware his tone is the slightest bit accusatory. Theo frowns, and Pansy looks down. Harry’s a bit relieved that they, at least, feel guilty too.
“Your Healers said they wanted to talk about a new course of treatment this morning. I wondered if you’d allow me to be in the room while they told you.” She perched on the edge of his bed, in the least Narcissa Malfoy-like manner he’d ever seen. It might have been her attempt to be comforting.
“Harry, I have a bad headache. I’m sorry,” he found himself saying, and his words were soft and light. There was a touch of sweetness in his tone that he hadn’t intended to let on. But Harry seemed pleased, and like he wasn’t about to ask another question, so Draco considered it a job well done.
Moments, maybe eons, passed before Draco wrenched himself away from the touch. A desperate note clung to his tone when he spoke. “Harry, I —”
“It’s very interesting, sir. Something I’ve never seen before in all my time here.” The shopkeeper drew up his frame to match Harry’s height, squinting his eyes at him in a familiar way. “Say, do I know you —”
“Oh, he’s probably outside or upstairs,” Luna says, returning to her re-organising of the liquor bottles. “Sometimes he needs a moment or two to be alone. I’ll join him later.”
“So now that this is all cleared up,” Hermione narrowed her eyes at Ron and fixed a prudent gaze upon Harry instead. “Are you and Malfoy together?”
“Alright. I’ll be in my office if you need me,” Ron said, even though they both knew that Harry wouldn’t. They hadn’t eaten lunch together in several weeks.
When they walked into the boardroom, Minister Shacklebolt, dressed in deep blue robes, was already at the head of the table. At his side, Hermione looked stoic and composed. She sent a side glance at Harry and Ron and smiled with her eyes. They returned the smile to her with enthusiasm.
The potion had rendered Draco weak, Harry thought, and a sick part of him liked it. He’d be compliant, easy to be around.
“Okay,” He says slowly. He feels a hot burning sensation behind his cheeks and a tightening in his throat. He’ll cry later, he promises himself, but he has to get through this conversation first. “What’s going to happen to me?”
“We’ll give you some space with these two, Draco,” Hermione said, biting her lip nervously as she spoke and gesturing at Ginny and Pansy. “We just wanted to pop in and see you. So you know that we’re here if you need anything at all.”
He had wanted to keep their terrible years to himself anyway, but in a strongly worded letter, he told Harry he would do so only if he sought out the help that he needed. It was clear the Imperioserum hadn’t only affected Draco’s mind.
Five excruciating minutes pass before Draco takes his first proper breath. Pansy weeps, and Harry feels like he needs to as well, but he sits back on the floor, letting his burning arms down to rest for a moment. Draco’s chest is beginning to purple after the pressure, and Harry worries that he might have broken a few bones. Either way, he’ll take it over the alternative.
“You seem to have thought about this a lot,” Harry remarked, allowing amusement to bleed into his voice. “Guess I’m not needed here, am I?”
“He does.” Harry played with his wedding band, moving it from finger to finger. “I’m certain.” A part of him was still largely unsure, but he had to believe it now more than ever.
“I do.” Harry manages, though his voice is hoarse as if it hasn’t been used in days. He wants to ask how long he has been at St. Mungo’s, but the words escape him once more.
Harry turns his head, tears pricking insistently at the corners of his eyes. He exhales roughly, willing them away. Their bodies are still pressed together, warm and pliant in each other’s embrace.
The old grandfather clock on the wall chimed twelve, and the sound rang out through their big kitchen, bouncing off of various objects with a loud clang. Lyra ruffled her feathers at the noise before retreating into somewhere quieter in the house. She’d probably ask to be let out from the bedroom window, even though the French doors were flung unceremoniously open despite the cold.
“No, Draco. Draco and I are fine. We worked things out. Tell Ginny. I don’t want her to worry about him.” Harry was met with a poorly-hid look of incredulity.
Narcissa Malfoy stands at the patio doors as people flit past her, no one really bats an eye at her presence. Harry supposes it makes sense that their guests wouldn’t be surprised that Draco’s mother is attending the wedding, but everyone close to them knows it’s not so simple.
“This...” The man turned to reveal an unassuming pale blue potion in the palm of his hand. It was a small vial, and the liquid was translucent like water. “This is a suggestibility potion, sir.”
“Anna Karenina, right?” Harry asks. “I only got through the first few pages before I fell asleep, to be honest.”
Harry reached into the closet for his pyjamas. He was growing tired from all the play-fighting, but he had more fun than he could have ever expected. He slid on a pair of flannels just as he said, “I know I am.”
Draco’s jaw tightens. He inhales, turning his gaze down to the floor. “It still feels so strange to have her back in my life.”
“I’ve already considered what we should do about this, a bit. It would be most practical to divide the class into three sections, aesthetics, behavior, and culture.” Malfoy began and continued as though he hadn’t noticed Harry’s widening eyes. “Now, I know aesthetics and culture seem similar, but I can assure you they are not.”
Without prompting, he draws up his shirtsleeve, exposing the inky black Dark Mark on his forearm. It hasn’t faded a day since the war, though it doesn’t move anymore, stagnant against Draco’s porcelain skin. Harry suppresses an alarmed noise when he sees it, eyebrows rising.
Oh, for goodness sake. Draco rolled his eyes and Lyra squawked in agreement. What a load of rubbish.
“Aurors Potter, Weasley, I’m going to need you to move back.” The Healer sidestepped Harry, who was grasping at the bedside. “Please escort them out.”
Draco stared down at his hands, guiltily, wondering if he was making the right decision. It was clear now that something was going wrong in his head, and because a Healer hadn’t been able to figure out what was going on, Luna was his next best option. It would be foolish to write her off completely. She was utterly mad at times, but a Ravenclaw for a reason.
McGonagall blocks the door, as a crowd begins gathering outside the bathroom, but allows his friends to stay inside. Hermione weeps silently into Ron’s arms. The silence is deafening, and no one dares to speak one word into existence. As if talking would solidify that this is real, this is happening. Harry allows a little surprise when Snape does not violently pull him from Draco’s body. The Professor crouches down next to their entangled figures. His hand on Harry’s back is strangely comforting. Harry knows they don’t move him for at least a half-hour before his eyes close droopily against Malfoy’s neck and his vision spots with black. He is  unconscious in a matter of seconds.
“I wish you could talk to me like this when you’re sober,” Harry says thoughtlessly after a few moments of charged silence. “You’re never open with me.”
The place is so far from what Harry would picture Draco Malfoy living in that he checks the address on his parchment once, then twice to make absolutely sure he isn’t about to walk into a poor old lady’s home at a quarter past nine in the evening and scare her shitless.
“Of course to Ginny too, Harry.” Ron sighed. “But we all have our closest friends. You can’t blame her for that.”
After a moment, they broke apart. Draco leaned into the soft grass on his back, feeling more comfortable than he’d ever been.
“I’m actually quite good,” Harry says, relieved at how the dynamic in the room has changed. Several eyes still linger on Blaise and Draco, but Harry supposes that’s how things go.
Years ago, when they had spoken their vows, Harry pledged to love and protect Draco until he died. He never knew at that time that the person Draco would need protecting from was Harry himself.
“He finally trusts me as a friend. I don’t want him to think I’m only with him because I want something from him.”
Harry suppresses a sound of surprise, eyes widening from behind his glasses. “Merlin, no, he’s not dead!”
Malfoy responded first, and to this, Harry was perplexed. The Slytherin had avoided him like the Black Plague for the majority of the first few weeks and had neglected to insult him. Harry was becoming worried that his mouth had been cursed shut, or something along those lines. The alternative that Malfoy might not actually care about him anymore was too unbelievable to even consider. Of course, he cared.
Harry noticed her charcoal eyeliner made her sharp features appear harsher than they probably were, but he disliked her all the same.
A thick tension layered on their conversation, and Harry felt his mouth go a bit dry. He wasn’t sure how to broach this topic of conversation yet, and he hadn’t planned to do it at all if he was honest with himself. Harry had willingly testified for the Malfoy family at the Wizengamot in the prior year, but Lucius had rightfully been placed in Azkaban on a life sentence. Harry debated whether Draco blamed him for it. He preemptively scolded himself for being unable to keep his mouth shut once in a while.
“Oh,” Harry says knowingly. He puts a hand reassuringly over Draco’s own. It’s cold. “I wasn’t either, if it helps.”
“I know you would.” She offers a smile, albeit weak, but genuine. “Alas, we are witness to Draco’s fate already.”
“I said you’re a giant prat, and I hate spending time with you.” Harry grinned, playfully shoving Draco’s shoulder.
“Love you too,” Harry murmured, muttering a soft cleaning spell and pressing a kiss to Draco’s temple. Draco shivered at the charm’s intrusion into his body. “I really do.”
“Nah.” Seamus shrugged, taking a sip from his coffee. “This is a big one. Top secret and all. Only the
“There has, unfortunately, been an incident involving Imperioserum. We know the last few weeks have been quiet. Delaney and Ms Granger have reported rare instances of use. If this substance is more widespread than we thought, it seems to be moving through different channels. It might be more present within quieter sectors of society than we initially hypothesised.”
It wasn’t that he wanted his husband to be the cold and emotionless shell of himself that he was before, but a small, dark part of Harry liked that Draco was scared — liked that Draco felt trapped with him.
A strangled cry escaped his throat as he threw himself toward the bed, toward the lifeless body laid out atop a tangle of sheets.
The beginning twinges of pain began to make their presence known in the familiar spot between Draco’s eyebrows, and he pressed at his head tentatively. He knew he couldn’t wish the feeling away, but if there was ever a time he prayed that he could have, it was now.
always annoyed with each other,” Theo says as he pulls Pansy into a one-armed embrace. “How’s Draco?”
A slight nervousness made its presence known in Draco’s stomach, but he nodded yes anyway. He felt himself twitch underneath his trousers in encouragement. There was no question that he, or something inside of him, wanted this badly.
“Doesn’t it?” Narcissa hums, content with his praise. “Unfortunately, Draco hasn’t seen it like this yet.”
They walked inside together, hands caught tightly in each other’s. Draco was the first to let go. “I trust you’ll make it back to your common room without my assistance?” He looked wary of leaving Harry by himself, but it was clear he was hastily attempting to escape the awkwardness between them.
“Why does it fail to surprise me that you would do that?” A voice, somewhat familiar, says from the shadows.
And it’s with a stubborn resolve and unbearable impulsivity that Harry decides he might as well go see Draco tonight. It’s bordering upon eight in the evening, and he has nothing better to do with the remaining hours of the day besides letting Claude harass him until he goes mad, so what better to do than announce to Draco sodding Malfoy that they’re fated to spend the rest of their lives together.
“Because I value knowledge” Philia lies, the real reason is because, for starters, the Ravenclaw common room has the highest tower in Hogwarts, the dungeons for Slytherin are far too low.
When the carriages pull up at Hogwarts, Philia is delighted to see Hogwarts in person, it looks far better than Draco had told her and it has the tallest roofs she's ever seen! She can’t wait to climb them tonight once everyone else is asleep. Being inside the hall is both good and bad, Philia no longer feels cold in her new robes, but she is ordered to stand off to the side with an old lady teacher because she's a ‘transfer’. Hogwarts doesn't usually have transfers, but seeing as Draco goes here she was made the exception. Once all the students are seated and talking animatedly, the doors of the hall open and the first years walk in. People start to notice Philia because she is standing by the entrance, she ignores them too. The lady teacher beacons her to follow the first years, so she does.
Nyctophilias relection is pale as ever as she scowls at the mirror in her room. Bloodshot eyes, bags too and hair that hangs greasy and limp. The only thing looking good are her fingernails which she painted black just yesterday. She tries to smile, just to see how it would feel, but it doesn’t change anything, never does.
“It's catchy, who do you think it's about?” Philia asks, trying to continue conversation so she seems less flustered, can Ginny tell she's flustered? Or is it all in her stomach? She shouldn't be flustered!
“You've been taking Trelawny too seriously,” Teases Philia, copying Ginny's parchment and trying not to look at her too much in case people think they are friends, that would ruin her reputation, plus, they most definitely aren't friends.
“Sorry..” She whispers, hoping Ginny won't make fun of her. But, Happy with an apology and not wanting to ruin it, Ginny simply continues as if the words had never been uttered.
“Yes, Millie,” Philia replies before stuffing another toast into her mouth and turning back to her anonymous rude letter.
A girl with dark skin and hazel eyes gasps, “You do not belong here! Ravenclaws want to improve and build on things, not destroy them!”
“Well- ah, as the hat doesn't seem to be working, we will have to wait until an alternative way to sort our students has been arranged, first years may sit at the table they desire for the time being,” Protests and shouts echo through the hall, no one seems happy with that idea.
“Well, it seems I have broken it,” Philia says simply, rolling her eyes, “Maybe I should have just lit it on fire instead”
Philia laughs, “There is no way you’re wrapping me into this..” But Ginny has her ways, and Philia had already fallen madly for her charm.
ignore mistakes please! i didn't have lots of time to edit, anyway enjoy this chapter because I'm excited to publish the next one... :):)
In record time, Philia collects herself, brushing her hair which has been dyed to match her Mothers, but shoulder length. She’s glad she’d dyed it, before now it had been bright red, her Mother said that she would be mistaken as a Weasley and needed to match her, father and Draco, Philia agreed. She slips on a baggy AM shirt over a long sleeve with black jeans and converses too. Last, she adds her favourite accessories, her rings. Draco always likes to taunt her saying she copies him by wearing them, which is very untrue. Philia wears rings so her fingers don’t get lonely and she calls them her promise rings, or her promises. Each ring means something different and holds a different promise, but not the sort that you’d think.
“She’s asleep,” one voice says, a girls, then Philia hears multiple footsteps and the weight of her seat dip from someone sitting down, “She won’t mind if we join her”
“Here, listen,” Ginny replies by handing over one of her headphones in Philia's ear. Philia can barely take in the song now that Ginny is close, her cheeks flaring up and her fingers fidgeting. Taking a deep breath, she focuses on the music.
“Yep, so how did you get such good music taste?” Philia inquires, without realising she is letting on that she likes the song.
“Only the sound of my depression, do you want me to play it for you? It sounds like a mix between broken vinyl and crackling fire as I burn down your house with your family inside,” Philia murmurs, not wanting to let Ginny in on anymore of her personal life.
“Hey girls! Glad to join your little posse, don't mind me, alright?” Philia laughs, walking over to her bed. She goes to the bathroom that the dorm has attached to slip into her pajamas, then puts a jacket on over the top ready to leave the dorm.
“And who's going to stop me?” Philia makes a big deal of slipping her wand into her pocket, “You?” She snickers as she leaves the dorm, trailing down the stairs like a mouse or ghost and then prying open the door to one of the balconies. It's almost like the Atlantic outside, so Philia starts to climb to regain her warmth. The bricks of the castle jut out and make a perfect ladder to the roof.
Later that day, at approximately 12:57, Philia finds herself creeping down the dank Hogwarts stairs towards the Slytherin common room. She is fully dressed in her school robes. As a fighter of insomnia, she often doesn't really sleep until 4 or 5, which she likes to think works in her favour. On her way, she sees no teachers or students, which is lucky, but she feels it kind of takes the thrill away from her adventure.
“Look, I might reconsider if you take me to your brothers band practise, or do they do shows? Take me to one of those too!” Philia demands, letting her enthusiasm leak out the more she speaks.
“You,” he points to me, “You have extraordinary will power, the hat did not really choose Ravenclaw for you, did it?”
“No shit I can see them, they're right there,” I snap, “Perhaps you've been prescribed the wrong glasses”
“I'm trying to make conversation, plus songs like that only sound good when you have a cru-ush on someone,” Philia mocks, lightly poking Ginny in the ribs.
“Meet me in the pale moonlight by Lana Del Ray,” She says quickly, aware that she had paused just to stare at Philia in slight shock.
“If I get kicked out of this school, I’ll tie myself to a post and light myself on,” Philia does jazz hands and smiles, “FIRE!”
“I was trying to listen to songs that might motivate me to do this astrology stuff,” Ginny explains honesty, setting down her quill and taking out her headphones to hear better.
“Oh well, it was worth the try,” Ginny says, picking her quill back up and going back to her parchment, a signal that their conversation is ending. After a long pause, Philia speaks up.
The murmuring only gets louder when they hear Phlilia’s name, she grins slightly at the reaction it provokes as she takes her seat on the stool and the dirty old hat is placed on her head.
“Where are you going?” One girl asks, she has brown hair and green eyes, and a really thin frame, perhaps she does sort?, “You can't go out this late”
“Your brain is probably too small to comprehend this, darling, but the hat put me in this house so, therefore, I am a Ravenclaw, whether your itty bitty feewings like it or not,” Philia stands as she says this, getting attention from some of the other students to, “Plus, I like my septum piercing, you have no right to tell me it isn't completely awesome”
“Welcome students of Hogwarts to another year! I don't want to bore you with an elaborate speech too early into the proceedings so we shall sort our first years now! However, we have a transfer student who shall be sorted first,” Dumbledore's voice booms through the hall and everyone is hush until he mentions the transfer, they all know its Philia, “Nyctophilia Malfoy, please take a seat”
“Excuse me, Professor,” She stands up and leans on her desk, Professor turns to make eye contact, eyebrows raised, “It's bollocks that you put us in pairs with anyone let alone the Gryffindors!”
“You should have told us you were awake,” Ginny mutters, she is holding a chocolate frog and breaks some off to eat.
“What? Scared I’m gonna catch you making out with your awful girlfriend over here?” Philia teases, leaning her head back with her eyes closed, a grin playing on her lips. Ginny chokes on her chocolate and Philia swears she can feel the heat from her blush from where she is sitting.
When she gets into class Ginny has headphones in and is listening to music while she writes. Philia is intrigued that Ginny has had the same idea as her to listen to music. As she plonks herself down beside Ginny, trying not to feel too happy about it, she asks:
“As if your name is better, Ginny? What's that supposed to be? The name of a cat?” Philia watches Ginny from the corner of her eye as she chuckles.
“What are you listening to?” Ginny doesn't seem surprised to see Philia, but she is surprised about Philia saying something that isn't a tease or a diss.
“It means I like the dark and the demons that lurk within it. If you're not careful I might pull your soul into a dark abyss of nothing so I can suck the life out of everything you’ve ever enjoyed. It’s spelt: N-Y-C-T-O-P-H-I-L-I-A”
“I don’t know much about Lana’s personal life, I don't take the time to learn about muggles, even famous ones,” Ginny replies, having not noticed Philia.
“Philia!” Draco screams, bolting across the dining hall to where Philia is sitting with the Ravenclaws eating toast and writing an anonymous, rude letter to a teacher who annoyed her yesterday. She grins and looks up as he nears. He grabs her upper arms and turns her to face him, the reminisce of the drawings still on his face, “You little bitch, what is this!?”
“Dunno what gave you that idea, sweetheart,” Philia snaps back, even though it's obvious because she would have left already if she really didn't want to be here.
“She’s asleep, she doesn’t even care that we are here, don't be a sap, Cho,” Ginny says, then she starts to rummage in a bag, “Want some chocolate? I stole a frog off the trolley”
By the time Astrology comes around, Philia is actually looking forward to it. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Ginny is her partner and everything to do with the fact that it's her favourite subject. She swears…
“When you were in my shop that day, I never told you the side effects of the potion. Well, to be fair, I never expected you to use it. Harry Potter himself, in my dingy little apothecary, tucked away in the back alleys of Knockturn. The Dreamless Sleep, of course, made sense. Many of you so-called war heroes need that particular night aid.” Locke cleared his throat, eyes bright and happy at his successful capture of Harry’s attention.
Draco, with an encouraging hand, pulls him back down into his arms. “I want you,” he says. “I trust you.” Words Harry never expected to hear spoken from his lips.
The year before, Draco had suggested they plant them. Naturally, the stone fruit trees that littered their garden were unusually helpful, and their annual yield was welcomed by many. The apricots were especially exquisite, and one year, to the pleasure of their friends and family, they had gifted them for Christmas.
“Come inside with me for a second.” Draco narrowed his eyes, but reached his hand out again for Harry anyway.
Harry fell onto all fours unsteadily, but nausea didn’t crash over him as it usually did. Before he knew it, Draco’s strong hands were in his, helping him to his feet.
Grief and anger bubble up uncontrollably inside of him, and compete against one another for the focus of his mind. Harry weakly rests against one of the walls, sliding down miserably and burying his head between his knees. This is most certainly not happening.
“You ask too many questions,” Draco remarks, rolling onto his stomach and popping the pill into his mouth like a hard candy. He holds a hand out, indicating he wants Harry’s drink. Taking a quick sip, he swallows the drug and motions for Harry to do the same.
“Draco,” Azalea prompts him because it’s unlikely he’ll offer in front of Harry. “Why don’t you share.”
“I’m starting to get used to this whole cayenne pepper on egg habit,” Draco said innocently, stealing a bit from Harry’s plate with his fork.
Harry’s eyes snap up at the mention. “I’m not sure,” he says truthfully. “I’d assume something at the Manor, where she usually is.”
“Pauline went to school with you, you know?” the woman interrupted, loosening her hand from the man’s tight grip. She ran a shaking hand through styled blonde hair. “She talked about you all the time. Sorted Hufflepuff, though, and was disappointed, of course, that she wouldn’t hang out with the famous Harry Potter. You Gryffindors always seemed to have classes with the Slytherins, and it pissed her off to no end. I went to Beauxbatons a few years before she left. I sometimes regretted that, you know. She was my little sister; she should’ve followed me, but she wanted to forge her own path. Always did.”
“I would be confused if I didn’t,” Draco remarks, coming around from behind the desk to stand in front of Harry. “I’ve studied violin since I was a child.”
Harry moved the chair, wincing as it screeched a grating cry out against the tiled floors. He hated being in St Mungo’s. It was a sterile and cheerless environment at best.
“You wanted to get away from me,” Harry said slowly as he parsed out the words in his head. He wasn’t surprised, and it didn’t hurt like it should have. “I don’t know what I’ve done to make you hate me so much, but —”
When he Apparated back to the cottage, it was well into the afternoon. The day had grown warm and sticky, just as the weather report had predicted, and it was the slightest bit too hot outside for comfort. With cooling charms, they would have to make it work.
“I’m gonna come,” Harry managed to get out, and he fucked Draco faster as if there was nothing more in the world he was meant to do other than this.
“Just because you’ve been avoiding doing this doesn’t mean everyone else has, you know. You can’t tell me that Luna and Neville are a mistake. What about Ginny and Blaise? Are those people who would have ever gotten together without the system?”
“There wasn’t much to help with.” Draco looked at his hands, embarrassed by the attention. “I put myself in this position.”
Carrow’s piercing black eyes met Draco’s gentle grey, tearing through them with unhinged lust. He moved closer now so that his face was practically inches from Draco’s own. Hot breath spilled onto Draco’s mouth, and he felt suffocated by the man’s presence.
Draco couldn’t help but agree, but he’d be damned if he were to say it out loud. As much as he loved Ginny, this was his private business. It was something for him and Harry to work out together, without an audience.
“I’ll check in with the patrol on duty and take a look at the scene. D’you want to start with the family?” Ron asked, jolting Harry from his thoughts.
A chorus of stiff and awkward hi’s and hello’s greet Draco back, and despite how small he is, he sinks further into the cushions. For a moment, Harry wonders if this was a bad idea.
“Listen, we don’t need to talk about that right now. I just don’t think this is healthy, and I wish you could see that.” Harry knows he shouldn’t get emotional, but he feels his voice crack as he says the words. He’s not ready to have this conversation. “This could kill you.”
Harry thinks about it for a minute. Usually, he does, and it’s something related to turning in his paperwork on time or earning a promotion in the department. He doesn’t often make one so personal to himself, because there’s never really been anything he’s wanted so badly. But somehow, he’d come to the party with expectations that he and Draco might be starting anew together. Facing the challenges that a new chapter presents with one another instead of entirely alone. Somehow, Harry feels like he’s cocked that up now.
A small, rational part of Draco knew he should never stand for such behaviour. But his mind, the voice in his head, lusted after it. He figured if there were a hard line that he wouldn’t want Harry to cross, his subconscious would be the first to tell him to stop. The voice inside of his head was on his side, wasn’t it? It had to be.
“Are you sure?” he asked diplomatically, praying to God himself that he wouldn’t have to stay behind and help her finish up the endless fieldwork forms that lay on both of their desks.
“I better stop before it gets to your head. Your ego is big enough as it is,” Draco smiles, and it’s a genuine thing that creases the corners of his eyes and makes his pale face come alive with light. It makes Harry happy to see.
“Just give it a chance, Draco,” Harry said and liked the way the name felt against lips. He paused when the blonde looked up, surprised.
“Depression is common, Mr Potter,” the Healer had said, not unkindly. “He just needs to know you’re there for him during this process. He won’t get better unless he really wants to.”
Once inside, Draco brought apples from the garden and used small quick movements to slice it with his wand. He would bake them in cinnamon and serve them with cream for dessert. Harry always found the dish too simplistic and never sweet enough for his taste. He preferred something heartier, like a chocolate cake or treacle tart.
Draco took the paper from Lyra and petted her affectionately behind her ears as he went. She followed him to his desk, where he held out a few treats for her taking. She squeaked eagerly and nuzzled into Draco’s knuckles as a thank you.
“I mean, I don’t mean to pry,” Ginny said, even though she absolutely, unequivocally did mean to pry. “I just know that one day Draco was about to move in with us, and the next, things were fine.”
Something shifted in Harry that he couldn’t qualify when he heard voices from the door. The idea of entertaining guests remained unappealing to him as they made their presence known in the kitchen. A weight hung in his stomach like a stone. His Draco was nothing more than the unfortunate result of a pseudo-Imperius Curse, and nothing could change that. But Harry couldn’t go back to the way things were.
He sits on his bed for an hour, dragging around a feather for Claude to paw at as he considers what his next steps are. If this is the home of Draco himself, Harry would need to strategise better than to simply show up on any given evening and just dump out life-altering information onto him. But on the other hand, Harry cannot get Narcissa’s words out of his head. If Draco is prone to running away, it would be unwise to alert him of Harry’s arrival at all. Maybe it would be smarter to catch him off-guard; that way, there would be no room for error or avoidance.
Draco wanted to wrench himself away, but he felt frozen to the spot. He directed his body to move, but it disobeyed — instead, it responded to the voice in his head that was silently egging Harry on.
The pain throbbed persistently, outstretching tendrils of feeling into his head, but it didn’t worsen at its recognition of Draco’s strong intent.
“Well you know how you and Voldemort had twin cores in your wands. It’s kind of like that, but with people.”
“Do you know where he is?” Harry asks, feeling his heart thumping away unpleasantly in his ribcage. There are quiet alarm bells going off in his head, and something feels a bit wrong. If anybody would know what Draco was doing after the war, Harry would have bet that it would be his precious mother. Now, he’s not so sure. But if Draco doesn't have her, then who does he have?
Draco turns to him, then holding a hand out. Harry takes it, and he can’t help that he’s crying now, thick, watery tears streaming quietly down the side of his cheeks and wetting the collar of his dress shirt. He’d promised himself, and Draco that morning, that he wouldn’t do this, but he can’t help it.
He ventures out of the sitting room and back into the foyer where a set of steep steps ascend into a dark hallway. Harry’s unsure if anyone is upstairs at all, but he’s feeling confident and drunk and like Lavender would know what she was talking about.
“I take that as a compliment,” Draco says. “I’ve always wanted to open a bookstore or work at a small, curated library. Ever since I was young.”
“Listen, I know it’s not my business, but I want to put you in touch with someone,” Harry says gently. “You can say no.”
He applied a quick glamour to his hair and face. He always made his nose just a tad longer and his hair a sandy yellow blond. No one paid much attention to him anyway, as patrons of Knockturn Alley valued discretion. Harry entered the store, and the floorboards squeaked beneath his trainers. A man who he had never seen before was adjusting a rack of potions in the corner. He nodded his head in acknowledgement to Harry, but left him to his own devices.
“I heard some choice dementors are waiting for you just outside if you’re interested,” Harry said, breaking the silence and fighting to keep his tone even. “A kiss, maybe, if you’re feeling bold.”
“Alright,” Harry nods. He’s reluctant to let Draco go alone, but doesn’t want to overstep his boundaries just yet.
Harry listens in as she guides the group through a myriad of phrases repeated back to her. When he doesn’t join in, Ollie pokes him in the side with her elbow.
“I don’t think he’d dare,” Harry laughed, a sense of relief coloring his voice. “He’s changed a lot since the war. He still has a lot to work on, but he’s trying. I know he is.”
Draco doesn’t put his book down, but Harry can tell he’s stopped absorbing the words. He makes a noise in question.
He never lasted long when Harry prepped him like this. He groaned heavily into the pillow when Harry’s tongue licked back and forth over him before pressing just the slightest bit inside. Draco instinctively spread his legs further, pushing back into the touch. He cried out when Harry’s tongue left him, but was flushed with a hot sensation as he felt two lube-covered fingers press inside of him.
“I didn’t hear you come in.” Harry met Ron’s grin with one of his own. “Can I put you to work?” He held out an extra pair of shears, and Ron took them begrudgingly.
Harry shrugged, gathering his things from his desk. “You know, I don’t —” he started, but was already heading for the door.
Harry found himself flustered when he realized he had finished next – it was a rare occurrence. As he began to approach the bench, someone pushed out in front of him. Harry’s hasty slowing charm prevented the vials from crashing against the floor and ruining hours’ worth of tough work. He glared at the blonde in front of him, though Malfoy would not meet his eyes.
“I said, would you like me to stay home with you?” A layer of irritation was seeping into Harry’s tone, but Draco could barely pay attention. After a pause, he asked again, “Hello?”
It’s still early in the morning, and although it’s a Saturday, Harry remembers he probably needs to be at work. He checks his watch, and it tells him that he should’ve been in the office an hour ago.
Harry was placid, but he felt as though he understood immensely. Harry could understand wanting to live without the crushing weight of other’s expectations for once. They were more alike than they thought, but Draco seemed as though he would stand right up and leave if Harry were to state such an atrocity.
It has to be about forty-five minutes later, though it feels like maybe five, when Harry starts to trip. Something inside of him feels lifted and unabridged. Free in a way he’s never felt before.
“I’m here to pick up a cake?” Harry said after a pause, his statement morphing unintentionally into a question.
Draco blanches, his face going even paler than before. “Don’t,” he says hoarsely, a pained look crossing his features.
“So are you.” Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, a decidedly uncharacteristic gesture for him. In moments like that, Harry noticed how much the new Draco was not the one he had married. It shocked him out of temporary peace, almost like being plunged directly into icy cold water.
It was a low blow, Harry knew that. But he also knew it was just what was needed to get under Draco’s skin, to ensure that he’d never leave the house again without Harry’s express consent.
“Alright,” Harry said unsteadily, reaching for his desk’s edge to ground himself back into reality. “Ready?”
Draco made his way to the kitchen, careful to step lightly on the floorboards. Harry barely got any sleep anyway and deserved a few more hours of rest.
Draco doesn’t Apparate after he passes the gates, instead opting to head in the direction that Harry knows is near the tube station. He feels distinct amusement at the fact that Draco looks like he’s walking away from a particularly brutal one-night stand, clad in Harry’s oversized flannel pyjama bottoms and all.
The crimson red fabric peeks out from behind a set of unused suit jackets, and Harry is quick to grab for it, sending the contents of half of his wardrobe crashing to the floor. He rummages through the pockets for far too long before locating a small, palm-sized box.
“Will you trust me for once?” Draco says impatiently, reaching for a silver box on his nightstand. It opens with an inviting click.
“Yes,” Draco managed, but the room suddenly felt like it was contracting upon itself. He was wheezing, holding the counter for support as though it were a glimmering lifeline. Clinging to anything that could ground him back into reality. “Harry?” he said, and he could hear how broken his voice sounded. So weak and vulnerable, just like his subconscious had already known.
He lets out a loud and lengthy moan as Harry cuts him off, beginning to slide in and out, gently burying himself deeper inside Draco with every thrust.
“You look nice,” Harry says awkwardly because despite how sickly Draco looks, he’ll never be unattractive.
sick because of it, and then we had to take you to the hospital, for Merlin’s sake, and you requested your paperwork! Don’t treat me like I’m stupid.” She scowled.
It was hours later when Draco extracted himself from the tangle of Harry’s limbs. He wasn’t tired from their nap anymore and was sure he’d sleep poorly in the evening because of it. Previously, he might have blamed Harry. But he knew his mind would revolt if he was to do so and was exhausted by the anticipation of pain. Somehow, it had taken a particular liking and care for Harry himself, which was, well, intriguing.
Harry startled when, with a soft groan, the stone wall separated gratingly, and two figures stepped out. Harry recognized Parkinson and Zabini, followed by a blonde boy he didn’t know.  His heart had leaped for a moment, mistaking the kid for Draco. But the one in front of him was quite a bit younger and had an unpleasant turmeric-like hue to his hair. It was nothing like Draco’s striking silvery platinum.
He’d moved into Grimmauld Place just after the war. Ron and Hermione had stayed with him for a couple of years, until they were all twenty, and Hermione was saying that they were adults and needed to live adult lives properly.
“You’re right, Harry. We, well I, haven’t necessarily been trying to make this work as much as I should. I owe it to you to do better.”
“I worry about you. Honestly, I worry about you both. Something’s not right here, and I wish you two would just talk to me. Or anyone!”
Harry kisses him again, this time fast and messy, lips catching roughly on teeth, fingernails digging painfully into skin. He presses Draco further into the mattress; it squeals in protest at the extra pressure. Harry slides on top, his breath hot and heavy against Draco’s neck.
“That’s still been too many times,” Draco says, though his tone lacks an edge, and Harry finds himself unable to stop the smile that comes out. “Can I ask you something?”
The bell rang out as the door opened, but Harry barely startled. He was engrossed in his notes, for once, attempting to pour all of his thoughts out before they were lost. When he glimpsed up, he found Draco unobtrusively standing in front of him with a shopping bag and a nervous smile plastered across his linear features.
“So, you and Draco are together?” Harry asks her slowly, feeling inexplicably annoyed, as he tries to connect red strings in his mind.
“Want to buy me breakfast?” Draco asks cheekily, as they exit the basement. “I’m thinking eggs and bacon, baked beans, and something entirely too greasy to be beneficial to our cardiovascular health.”
“I apologise for waking you then,” Draco says. He places the instrument gingerly on the desk and steps away as though the distance makes a difference.
He nods, attempting to move his hands, but she grips him tighter. “Promise me you won’t forget him, Draco–I mean.”
Where Pansy was a little too trusting for a Slytherin, Ginny was extra cautious for a Gryffindor. She hadn’t bothered to forget the night of Draco’s birthday party. Harry felt like it was just yesterday too.
The faces around her are bright and encouraging, and Harry feels his heart swell with sadness for Ollie. He has plenty of money to buy her a place or get her by in the meantime.
Ron interrupted Harry’s question quickly, “Bloody hell, no, It’s not at all the fact that he’s a boy. Malfoy’s just…
He and Ron had been so close to classifying the case as a suicide out of simple convenience. Harry felt embarrassed at the thought but knew that there were things that needed to be prioritised as an Auror. For a while, Harry was ashamed to admit that Pauline hadn’t felt like one.
Draco was pliant now, easily influenced. He rarely thought for himself anymore, which was why he hung onto the thistles because, in essence, they were everything he had left.
Harry dropped the knife against the cutting board, turning to face Draco instead. He was promptly pushed against the cabinet as Draco bit and sucked at his neck. Any enjoyment Harry had was lost in the fact that once it was over, Draco would return to his usual self.
Harry exhaled raggedly; he hadn’t wanted to start an argument. “Look, I’m not excusing what you did at all. Your actions hurt so many people. Your family killed people.” Draco didn’t flinch because he already knew, and Harry almost felt proud of him for that. “I don’t think I’ll ever forgive you entirely for your part in the war. That will be hard for me. But working with you hasn’t been all that terrible, and clearly, you’re more than just a former Death Eater no matter what other people might say. I didn’t think that a few weeks ago you know, and now I do, so that must say something about who you are as a person. Maybe you have changed just a little, even if you’re still a massive prat at times and want to pretend you haven’t.”
Why was Harry even in Knockturn? Why wasn’t he at his usual Muggle pub with Ron? It was fucking Christmas Eve. Why wasn’t he staying home? Questions tunnelled into Draco’s mind. He should’ve asked before Harry left, but the potion had prevented him from uttering a word.
“Draco,” Harry says low and whispered, but he’s sure Draco hears it perfectly. “I need to talk to you.”
“Ginny, I’ll have to catch up in a bit,” he said, rather pragmatically, and didn’t miss when she huffed away from him. She knew better than to make a fuss in front of Odessa.
Harry considers it’s not really about finding the perfect person to spend the rest of his life with. It’s about finding someone who will love him as he is. Because that’s all Harry wants, really, is just to be accepted, and to be loved for the person he’s become. It had been hard, at first, to approach the subject of soulmates with the idea of the perfect, pure match. But, really getting to know the person Draco’s becoming is eye-opening. Because, despite all the pain, and struggle, and mistakes, he is more worthy of love than any person Harry knows.
Harry’s mouth curves up into a smile. He leans forward without question. The kiss is less sensual than their first. Harry scrapes his teeth accidentally against Draco’s, and their lips catch against each other uncomfortably. Their noses keep bumping together, too, as though they’re teenagers learning to kiss for the first time. There’s a fair amount of awkwardness, and Harry loves every second, feeling giddy with excitement and laughing against Draco’s warm mouth, his arms wrapped possessively around his waist.
His hands were growing shaky from the pent-up anger and emotion inside himself, and he would break soon. Draco knew it too because he was turning a beet red, and his hands were trembling more than they usually did at the dinner table.
It had been a while since they’d had guests over for anything other than a strictly planned birthday celebration.
He points his wand at the wireless radio, turning it on with a quick swish. Something gentle comes through the speakers as Harry extracts a pan from the cabinet to fry an egg. He would make another, but Draco doesn’t seem like he has the stomach for breakfast this early.
Harry is grateful for that, but also entirely too depressed to care. He would have been a moron to think that no one would find out what had happened. It had been a week, surely it was announced to the school already.
Harry looked at the man next to him, his gaze turning cold at a familiar face wearing an unfamiliar expression.
When he’d told his Mind Healer about the voice, she’d written it off as a symptom of his depression. When he had told her about his hallucination, she’d told him that he was broken. Things in his head weren’t working right and wouldn’t until he started getting serious about taking his medication.
Harry had feigned surprise, of course, because there was nothing better to do. But that night, he’d carefully instructed Draco on his next steps.
“Yeah it is true,” Harry said, but his eyes hadn’t left the page. He found Jane Austen’s writing to be supremely boring, but staring at the words was easier than meeting a pair of curious eyes.
Malfoy stood from his perch and walked faster, throwing back a glare at Harry instead. “Malfoy, seriously, this isn’t a big deal. I didn’t even know the guy! What the hell has gotten into you?”
Harry rolled his eyes but nodded in acknowledgment nonetheless. He was still surprised at the building in front of him. He hadn’t seen anything like it. Though Hogwarts had it beaten by quite a fair bit, this was impressive, nonetheless.
The lock clicked open, and Harry crept into the bathroom, taking care to not step on Draco, who was sitting in a heap on the ground. He was too upset to feel self-conscious about his nudity at all, though Harry barely startled at his appearance. Instead, his eyes raked possessively over Draco’s bruises before snapping himself out of a stupor quickly.
Draco stepped aside evasively, but Harry had planted his feet, arms shooting out to cage his husband’s wrists between them. Senses heightening at the removal of his escape route, Draco panicked against the unmoving hold.
Snape began to stand, “Consider that the ultimate penance then. You can ruminate on this as much as you would like, and you will be serving a tremendous punishment for what you have done.”
“I’m coming,” Harry barely manages the words. He folds over Draco with a shout, vision going hazy as he rides out his orgasm inside.
Harry was seething, and he wasn’t sure why. His indifference from the day before had buried underneath rage and irritation that was clouding any inkling of common sense. He wanted to push Malfoy over like a child. It was even more upsetting to Harry how quickly the roles had shifted back to how they had been before the war. It was rare that Malfoy let go of much of his emotional side anymore, and Harry was startled to see it outside of McGonagall’s office. Even if it were only momentarily. Harry had felt as though somehow, he had the upper hand for a brief instance. It was apparent that he had now lost it.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut, and he keeps his mouth pressed closed in a thin line. “I know,” he says, and Harry’s proud already because it seems like a hard thing for him to admit.
He entered the Department of Magical Law Enforcement with a spring in his step. When Ron joined his side, he barely commented on it because it had become a regular occurrence.
“God, you’re so dramatic, Theo darling,” Pansy crows from the doorway. Harry hadn’t even heard her come in.
Harry seemed to realise this and began to move painstakingly slowly until he worked himself in and out. Draco cried out at the sensation. Quickly, Harry’s hips snapped forward, pulling all the way out and slamming back roughly inside of him. They moaned together at the way their bodies connected, and Draco struggled to keep his eyes open, if only just to see Harry’s sweaty and muscled figure completely devour his own.
Narcissa takes a bite of a sandwich and a slow sip of tea. She’s casual in her environment in a way that Harry has never seen her before. He doesn’t feel too hungry and places his plate back onto the coffee table.
“Now?” Malfoy asked incredulously, his voice rising in pitch. Harry liked it when he flustered Malfoy like that. He’d always loved provoking a reaction. “We’re going right now?”
He had never felt so alone while being surrounded by so many people. The party emptied out quickly afterwards. “It’s a Sunday, we have work tomorrow” and “Sorry, the kids are waiting up for us!” were the most common excuses he received. He knew people were leaving because thick tension strained heavily between him and Draco, though, frankly, he didn’t care.
Neville never missed a beat. “It is!” He had smiled, taking a sip of champagne. “Plants are a great resource when it comes to healing. Honestly, I’m surprised more people don’t use them at home since they’re so easy to grow.”
Harry laughed, digging for the remote between the cushions and extracting it with an “Aha!” Draco was not wrong. Televisions were not exactly pleasing to the tasteful eye.
“Yes, Mrs Malfoy,” she says, clasping her hands together excitedly, as though she isn’t called often.
“I don’t think it’s a joke.” Hermione’s voice is barely above a whisper as she speaks it, but she looks guilty enough that Harry feels his chest swell with rage.
Pansy and Theo each grab onto one of Harry’s arms. He visualises his home in his mind, and sickening seconds later, they’re standing outside the wrought iron gate.
“Well that’s...nice,” Harry offers hesitantly. His eyes wander around the room, and despite the warm temperature of the space, he shivers.
“Oh, er, I’m not really looking for anything else,” Harry started, but the man waved a hand noncommittally.
He comes back around to the other side, unthinkingly tucking a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear so it won’t get in the way.
“You better not be leaving me,” Draco jokes, but there’s a moment of concern, worry laced into his tone.
“Can’t you see, though?” Draco grinned because, finally, he was free, enlightened. “Something is! I’ve been feeling it all along, and now that I know you have to, we can fix this. Together, we can fix this, and everything will go back to normal.”
“Mr Malfoy, please stay still or I’ll have no choice but to sedate you.” The Healer spoke in a calm and even tone that upset Draco further.
” Harry sighed. “You can barely shower or dress yourself without my help. You’re all skin and bones. Do you really want people seeing you like this?”
“I can’t believe you,” Harry had been holding a glass of water and was surprised he hadn’t shattered it against a wall.
She holds out a ripped piece of parchment, folded in on itself, almost too crumbled to seem like anything important. He smooths it out in his palm, noticing the nearly illegible scratch of an address in crimson ink.
“It’s not your job to fix him,” Hermione had said. “He has to be willing to do the hard work by himself.”
“Well, now I don’t.” Draco stood and held a hand out to Harry, as though the answer were enough of an explanation. Harry took it instinctively, comforted by the familiarity of Draco’s touch. “Come out back with me.”
“No, I didn’t,” Draco argues, sitting up in the bed abruptly, and the group around him scoot back to make room for Harry, who joins them, unceremoniously, on the bed. “It’s going to be a whole new year in only one hour.”
Harry muttered something unintelligible, and the air around him smelled lemony and fresh like cleaning product. Draco’s mouth was dry and cracked when he put his lips back together.
“Actually, I’d love to see the potion!” Harry announced, hoping the shopkeeper would turn his back and forget about his poorly glamoured features.
“Do you think you two do?” Harry said thoughtlessly, before catching his mistake. The last thing he wanted to do was bring up something they had probably worried about already.
He wrenched Draco’s shirt from his body as the man cried out from beneath him. Buttons ripped from the seams and clattered loudly to the floor. Harry was hungry, his eyes were wide with desire, and Draco was bent over, his for the taking.
“Ollie,” she says, as a greeting. She holds a hand out, and Harry takes it. Her handshake is firm, business-like. “Are you observing today?”
Harry isn’t an idiot. He holds the crumpled-up note, in Draco’s handwriting, in his palm. He’s not sure why they’re pretending. Instead of pointing it out, he raises an eyebrow. He’s sober as a bird, and not necessarily excited to see Draco dipping back into his habit.
Draco doesn’t seem to be annoyed, but he brushes away Harry’s worry quickly. “I know you’re only trying to help, but I don’t know how many times I can tell you that I don’t need it.”
“You got these…for me?” Harry asked, struggling to keep both amusement and affection from blanketing his voice. Draco had bought flowers for him.
“I’ve instructed her not to. She was far too distressed to call me Narcissa, though, so we’ve come to a fair compromise.”
Harry sleeps fitfully that night, tossing and turning uncomfortably upon his mattress. He can’t seem to get comfortable enough to go to bed, scenes of Draco lying high and sad in his bed playing through his mind like a montage of old videos.
Harry nods, feeling awkward and uncomfortable and too intrusive to be inside her carefully crafted home. This version of the Manor is different, Harry concedes. It’s more of a home than it ever was.
“You didn’t tell me you were going out. Why were you there?” Harry asked, and there was a glint of something in his eyes that Draco couldn’t quite identify. The hairs on the backs of his arms crept upright in response. He shivered, and the room felt a notch colder than it had when he had arrived.
“How observant,” Draco quipped and immediately regretted it. A rupture of pain fractured out from behind his eyes. His hand flew up instinctively, massaging his forehead as he attempted to hold back a sob.
“I know, I’ve been terrible.” Harry laughed, wrapping his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “I’ve missed you two. What have you been up to?”
Hermione turned back to him, cocking an eyebrow. “And I supposed when you spoke up, it did absolutely nothing either.”
It wasn’t that he wanted to dislike this Draco; after all, Harry had made him this way on purpose. But it was painful to know the potion itself had run down some of his husband’s most telling quirks and personality traits.
“I’m right?” he asked incredulously, a smile pulling on his lips. His tight grip on the sides of the chair loosened the slightest bit.
He appreciated some of their traditions, like doing the cooking, and hadn’t wanted to push the suggestions too far. And if Harry didn’t enjoy preparing their morning meal, there would be no way to sneak just a drop of potion into his husband’s tea. The benefits went both ways.
He doesn’t question it as they exit, Pansy walking over slowly to speak with Narcissa, who wraps them both into familiar, albeit slightly uncomfortable, hugs.
“Yes.” Draco’s breathing became shallow. Why in the hell had he said that if he wasn’t even remotely ready? He wasn’t sure how his lips could’ve betrayed him like that when everything inside was screaming at him to stop.
It takes a little more coaxing, but Harry’s able to cajole Draco out of bed. He dresses in the bathroom, in a pair of nice trousers and an oversized jumper. On Harry, the outfit would look unkempt, but Draco, of course, manages to pull it off. Harry doesn’t think he really understands what the word ‘chic’ means, but this is definitely a look that Blaise and Ginny would deem so.
“Something tragic and dramatic. Equal parts miserable and exciting.” Draco brings his fingers up to his face, translucent fingernails tracing circles around the skin of his cheek. “No one remembers a happy ending.”
“It’ll be a cold day in hell when I go to Malfoy Manor again,” he says, with a pained expression on his face.
“Hopefully it works, otherwise we’ll have subjected ourselves to this for nothing,” Harry let out a laugh, but it evolved into a slow cough. He conjured a cup, and muttered an
Harry figured that would make sense, because he'd been replacing Draco’s antidepressant potion with Imperioserum every day and hoping for the best. It was a sick and selfish action, but a voice inside of Harry’s head told him he needed to do it. It was the only option. And as awful as it was, if Draco recovered, he might come to his senses and leave.
