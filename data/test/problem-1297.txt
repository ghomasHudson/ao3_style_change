. Today Harry had promised himself he'd go and talk to Cedric to warn him about the first task. Which, unfortunately, happened to be bloody dragons. Hagrid had shown them to Harry last night, and Harry had blinked in surprise when he remembered Hagrid had almost kept a Norwegian Ridgeback as a pet. There had been a Norwegian Ridgeback amongst the group of dragons, and Harry thought it was the most terrifying of the pack.
Draco hated Hogwarts. He hated Dumbledore. But killing him was very different than just hating him.
"Yeah, I guess I'll be leaving then-" Draco moved to stand, but Harry wrapped his arms around him quickly, taking Draco by surprise. He slowly hugged Harry back as the raven haired boy buried his face in Draco's shoulder, kissing his exposed collarbone lightly, making Draco shiver, and not from the wind this time.
Maybe before three weeks ago Harry would've expected a scowl paired with an insult. Maybe a week and a half ago he would've expected a shrug with a tease alongside it. What he expected now, he didn't know, but it definitely didn't include Draco smiling and saying "Yes, that I did."
He couldn't be with him how he'd like to.
That got him looking up. Draco had said his first name- and not in the spiteful tone it usually came out in. Harry sat up, shoving his glasses back on and looked at Malfoy, who was chewing his lip and looking at the book in front of him.
Harry couldn't help but wonder if it had all been a dream.
Draco, who visited Harry in the hospital wing at an ungodly hour, but Harry was awake still because he knew his boyfriend would be visiting him. Draco, who stared at Harry for a moment, still, before climbing into the hospital bed next to him and letting his tears escape because when Harry returned from the maze, still and hurt and tear-tracked, Draco's heart had stopped, because for one (awful terrible sickening) moment he had thought
Narcissa's eyes were like Draco's, but without the grey. They were icy blue, and they could read every emotion Draco had.
Salt water sprayed Harry's face as he stared over the edge of the cliffs of Azkaban. This was his first- and hopefully last- time here. Ethan Coldstone, his assistant Auror, stepped up nervously. The poor guys was just an eighteen year old trainee that had been assigned to Harry. Then again, Harry wasn't much older. Just twenty.
wasn't. He knew from the second the Savior of the wizarding world gave the bad guy in the tale a chance that he loved the green-eyed boy who lived. Love was the way Harry held Draco's hands while he taught him how to cook. Love was the way Draco patiently explained the proper history of ancient wizarding families and the way Harry would frown when stuck, and grin and kiss Draco's cheek when he understood.
And with that, he turned and walked away, his back to Harry.
A spell collides with the wall around them, sending smoke around.
When it clears, Draco Malfoy has gone.
Glancing at the mirror, Harry caught sight of his reflection for the first time in months. Unless you counted his eyes in the lake in the woods, or his glasses catching the light of Gryffindor's sword blade. Harry didn't count those. He couldn't help but force the stinging in his eyes to go away as he thought about his eleven year old self looking up at the towers of Hogwarts with anxiousness, excitement, and hope. Now, when Harry looked around, heavy purple shadows hung under his eyes. His messy and dirty hair sat, a tangled mop, upon his head, his once bright eyes now dull with stress and fear.
Looking at Ron, Harry frowned. He didn't want to upset Ron by shaking Draco's hand, but he didn't want to upset Draco by not. Who says he can't be friends with both? Harry looked back to Draco and reached out, shaking his hand.
However, Harry's grin fell when he heard yelling coming from Ron's open office. He came to a halt and peered in, surprised to see Ron, red in the face, arguing loudly with-
Draco's voice was hoarse from lack of use and lack of water. Without a second thought, Harry had conjured him a glass and levitated it towards him. Draco was sitting in a chair outside the courtroom, Harry leaning against the wall across from him. Ethan had been sent to the council to announce their arrival.
Yes, he for to laugh and talk and hug and high five and smile and be with Harry.
Good people like Harry deserved to live. People like Draco who made too many mistakes didn't.
Hermione, on the other hand, would be far more challenging. She'd ask questions. Probably ones Harry didn't have answers to, and probably ones that would stress him out.
He knew he was in love with Draco Malfoy.
He looked straight ahead as he walked, wiping his shaky and sweaty hands on his trousers as he made his way closer to the High Table. After three years of being in the spotlight, he had learned one thing. Never show your nerves. It would only encourage everyone. So, he ignored the jeers and protests about him being "too young" and a "cheat", and looked Dumbledore square in the eye.
They were on the outskirts of a run-down and empty town in some off road city far away from London. Harry scrunched his nose and turned, only to face a gas station that looked as though it hadn't served gas in years. The letters were peeling and one employee (a teenager) was sleeping inside. Other than that, there was no one around.
Though, he supposed he could relate to it. Confined in a space large enough to fly around and large enough to, if only for a moment, believe that you're free. But, when all is said and done, you are are still in a cage. You are still trapped. You are still not free.
For a split second, Harry thought that he actually had seen hurt on Malfoy's face, but the next second it had been replaced by his usual scowl. Harry was about to turn and go, but he caught sight of the
forgot his anger and spoke to Harry out of pure shock.

, he thought,
He felt Draco nod, and also noticed the mosh pit that used to be his stomach. He knew he had to pull away before he did something stupid, so pull away is what he did. "Who're you taking to the Yule Ball?" He asked, quickly changing the subject.
"'Course it worked, Freddie! Look at Malfoy!" The other exclaimed.
But Ginny shouldn't hugging him. Anyone that had gone through what Harry went through at the same age and the same time should be wrapping him in relieved arms.
A soft knock on the door made Draco tears his eyes away from the window, and he watched as his mother stepped into his room. She had an apologetic look that made it clear what she had come in for. She didn't even have to say anything. Draco's teeth clenched and his expression hardened as he stood.
Hence why he had struck up a relationship with his trainee. Seriously frowned upon, but he couldn't help himself. Ethan's brown wavy hair and electric blue eyes and his fit body from Hogwarts quidditch days had attracted Harry.
Draco nodded a little as though he'd been expecting this question. He stood and walked forward, standing in front of Harry. Harry held his breath, afraid to touch him, afraid he was a ghost that would shimmer away if he got too close.
friend."
Draco Malfoy.
Harry stood right in front of him defiantly. He was scowling and looking at Draco with a coldness that had never been there before.
The door appears.
he didn't love anything.
The blond then leaned back a little. "Yes, you do. Caring for you. It was never easy."
"Absolutely not!"
"Prat."
and the fact that he doesn't know and doesn't understand makes him want to rip his hair out.
Call it old magic, but Harry found his way to the correct cell purely based on his feelings. His gut led him in the right direction, right to Draco Malfoy. Or, what was left of him, at least. And call it boy-ish guilt, but Harry pulled his arm out of Ethan's grip when Draco raised his head to look at Harry.
badge, reflecting in the sunlight.
"What happened today?" Harry asked gently, throwing his jacket onto the table and seeing Draco's solid figure. "What did that man say? We did background research, he's nobody important. Just some guy that works at Flourish and Blotts."
He just wanted this nightmare of a conversation to end. Hell, it wasn't even that. Harry hadn't said a word.
Looking up again, shock overtook his shame for a second. "What? They're not keeping me overnight?"
A lifetime ago, it seemed, all of them, even the Slytherins, had entered Hogwarts without a trace of knowing what the future held in store for them in their minds. They were carefree, they were innocent, they were free.
, Draco, what's so hard to understand?"
Ron never knew what to do. But he always knew how to distract Harry.
- - -
However, they weren't very helpful when it came to walking past Malfoy. With Ron, Harry had been able to complain about the blond prat's jeers, but it wasn't the same with his new company. Neville just turned crimson at Mafloy's insults and Hermione insisted on ignoring him when Harry was in the mood to argue with him.
He kissed Harry.
"Why? Why do you mind so much?" Harry glared at Draco, who scowled.
was dead, not Diggory.
"You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there," Draco held out his hand to Harry.
"Still," Harry smirked, leaning back in his chair, "You're the one who came back."
!" Hermione hissed, roughly shaking his arm and snapping him out of his thoughts and back to reality. Most of the eyes that had been scanning the room had found him, and he gulped nervously as he slowly raised from the bench.
A second later he was lunging at Harry, knocking him to the ground, and landing on top of him. The tent was still as Draco hovered over Harry in a push-up position, both boys suddenly aware of how quick their hearts were hammering. They both were silent, breathless, and blushing. That is, until Harry giggled.
But Ron just glared and turned on his side in his bed, holding the covers to his chin. Harry huffed and went back over to his own bed. He looked back at Ron once more, only to be met with the words "Piss off."
“I’d be careful if I were you Draco, not everyone is going to be happy about you and Harry and they might decide to take their anger out on you.” Hermione said as a couple of fifth year girls watched them pass by with a look of disgust directed at Draco.
“Auror training?” Draco said in confusion, “But I thought –” Before Draco could finish his thought Harry gripped his thigh tightly to shut him up.
The Great Hall looked as splendid as it always did, though the students couldn’t help but notice the empty seats all around them. There were hushed murmurs from every table, as if everyone were afraid to talk in anything above a whisper. The returning would-be seventh years were given their own table as McGonagall thought that being surrounded by familiar faces would make the war battered students more at ease. She was right, to an extent. Being able to sit next to Draco and Hermione made Harry feel much better about returning to Hogwarts, but having their own table also meant that the rest of the school didn’t have to look far to stare at all of the so-called Hogwarts War Heroes, as
"Stop!" Draco yelled, gripping the cell bars tightly and shaking them.
Draco, who began to grow distant from Harry at the beginning of their sixth year, which clearly had an effect on both of them. It was shown in dark circles under eyes and permanent frowns on lips.
," He mimicked (terribly- mind you) Draco's French.
"And, Draco," Harry muttered, and both boys stilled at the use of Draco's first name. "I love you too."
"You did it," Draco was repeating, his face buried in the crook where Harry's neck met his shoulder and Harry found that he couldn't stop blushing. He laughed at Draco's concern.
Since the Dementors were the guards of the wizarding prison, Harry and Ethan had to make their way through the building (if that's why you would call it) alone. Which was fine- Harry wasn't planning on asking a Dementor for directions.
"What?" Draco spat.
So, with a groan and many mutters and rolling of the eyes, Harry and Draco were given the case information and apparated to the first location they were forced to inspect. It was quiet and it was awkward and Harry hated every second of it.
"No," Draco's voice came out hoarse. "I'm not leaving until he wakes up."
Harry thought about it. He'd only heard bad about the Slytherin house, but he didn't think it was fair to judge any of them, especially since he had no clue what they were twenty-four hours earlier. "Any house, I guess. Whatever's best," he said.
Yes, Draco knew all about love. But he had never said it. He never would- not when
. Okay?"
"Malfoy, good, you're here!" The daunting voice of Travers called as Draco walked into the cell room. He kept his eyes on the other Death Eater, not daring to look towards the bars. "I can't deal with him anymore, it's up to you now."
As a sixteen year old, it hasn't been very hard to follow these three simple rules. Stupid Granger still gets top marks, but Draco is behind her in every class besides Defense Against the Dark Arts, but he supposes that it's okay to let Potter feel glorified in at least one subject. When he spoke to the other Slytherins, it was either about them or anything other than himself. He was good at keeping the conversation away from himself.
"They can't do anything to me. They can't take anything from me. I have nothing left."
"If I were to go missing, I wouldn't choose this place," Harry muttered.
, had been assigned his first case. He had transferred from the Auror on-field work to the investigative to try it out, and ended up loving it. He had assisted the older detectives on a few cases but now he had gotten his own.
"Draco."
Nodding, Harry yanked open the door to the library and walked in, not bothering to hold it for Malfoy. They didn't have to be
"Those Weasley twins are
Harry groaned and almost dropped his head again, but Draco's next words stopped him.
The next fifteen minutes went by in a whirlwind. Between watching Moody argue with Karkaroff about

." He dropped his head in his hands, seeing stars as he pressed his palms at his eyes, tossing his glasses onto the table.
Harry looked up and met Draco's tear-filled gaze. Both felt their worlds crumbling.
Draco let out a snort, then quickly stopped.
"I do mind," Draco glared at Harry. But it didn't mean anything. They bickered because it's what they know. And if they didn't bicker Draco would lose his mind, since he always has the constant need to complain and insult. Luckily he found Harry, who ignores him when he does that.
"Yeah, Harry, don't you think I tried when I saw the case info? I can't- Smithstone won't let me."
"-see if he knows anything, but he probably won't-"
Hermione went to sit beside Harry and rested her hand over his entwined hands. “He isn’t going to leave. I’ve seen the way he looks at you and there is no way he would abandon you, not now that he’s got you.”
Harry laughed, “What is that supposed to mean?”
Harry stood frozen. Did he really just say that? Out loud? The door to their room was still open and Harry peered out to make sure that no one was in the hallway that could have heard his sudden outburst. When he saw there was no one there he walked into the room properly and closed the door.
Draco was still sitting on his bed, eyes wide and mouth slightly open. “Wha- um sorry can you repeat that?”
Harry had told Draco over the summer that he no longer wished to become an Auror, he had spent so much time having to fight for his life that he had no more fighting in him. It seemed that Draco was the only one who knew however, given Hermione’s comment.
"Oh so Malfoy's
But, that hadn't worked for Harry. He had gone and, like many other things in his life, messed it up. Last night he had told Draco what he felt. And he had told Draco how real his feelings were. And Harry knew, when he saw the look in Draco's eyes, the blond Slytherin felt the same way about Harry that Harry did him. The Gryffindor's mistake was believing that Draco would be vulnerable enough around Harry to tell him so.
Draco laughed. "Smooth, Potter."
For now, he settled on wrapping his arms tightly around Draco's waist, hugging him back.
Harry turned away from Ron and his eyes landed on the pale blond boy from Diagon Alley. He wore a small grin that made Harry more curious about him. He'd seemed cold at the store in Diagon Alley, but here he seemed like any other kid in this crowd.
When the funeral had finished, Draco walked over to the casket and pressed one last kiss on Harry's forehead, then watched as the lid was lowered.
. Because then McGonagall knew, and with sad eyes, she dismissed Draco and asked him to send in Ronald Weasley.
Harry took a step forward. "I knew, back in fifth year. I knew you knew about Dumbledore's Army."
"Potter, look at me!" Malfoy huffed, growing agitated.
"Alright?" Ron asked, watching Harry closely. Harry hadn't realized that his hand had come up and was rubbing his scar. He quickly dropped his hand and gave Ron a sad sort of smile, whispering, "Alright."
"Draco." The blond boy jumps and turns to face Harry, his quiet sobs shaking his body.
"Stop-" Draco breathed, his voice shaking.
When Draco Malfoy's arms wrap themselves tightly around Harry Potter's waist, Harry knows that this is right. This isn't like Ginny's grip. Malfoy will always understand Harry in a way that Ginny never could. White-blond hair tickles the side of Harry's neck as Malfoy buries his face into the younger boy's shoulder, and Harry feels Malfoy's tears through his shirt. Malfoy had just lost Crabbe, one of his life-long closest friends.
"No, it's fine, I don't care," Harry said hurriedly. "Dragons. That's the first task."
"No," Harry said firmly, a frown etched on his face. "No, you're coming home.'
When he followed the others through the tunnel that would lead into Hogwarts, he traced his hand along the side to keep him upright. Harry choked back his words as he thought about how they were
Since when had Draco cared who Harry was friends with? Harry had hung out alone with Pansy, Theo, Blaise, and even Crabbe and Goyle thousands of times before. But the second he tells Draco he's leaving to study with Hermione in the library or play Quidditch with Ron on the pitch, Draco's livid.
was carved into her skin. And when her questioning eyes caught his gaze, he gave her a nod and put on his brave face.
Harry glanced at him. In that moment, and every moment for the past five years, all he could do was think about those wonderful weeks he had spent with Draco. He had gotten know him, gotten to
But that would never be enough.
Harry shook his head. "I'll never accept that. Being without you will never be easier."
When Ginny throws herself into Harry's arms while the others in the Room of Requirement watch him with hungry and waiting eyes, Harry knows it feels wrong. It's a foolish and selfish and idiotic thought but Ginny should not be hugging him. Lavender should. Dean should. Seamus, Terry Boot, Hannah Abbot, Ernie Macmillan, the Patil twins, anyone from his year should. But not Ginny- she wasn't in that group.
Malfoy was shocked. He cleared his throat, struggling to come to terms with the fact that he wasn't
Draco winced when Harry said he wanted him, which only made Harry frown more. Draco's gaze hardened. "And I told you,
Harry, who was heartbroken.
However, Harry's gaze was only met with one of stone and hurt and anger. "I don't feel anything." Draco said clearly, gazing into Harry's eyes and sticking out his chin.
Harry flung his arms. "Because I've got no one else to tell! Because nobody will talk to me and although you only insult be at least you're saying
Risking everything, Harry takes a step closer to Draco. "Don't wipe away your tears," Harry shakes his head. "I know we're not together and I know I can't do anything about the reason you're crying, but... just let me be there for you."
"I promise I won't waste it."
around anymore, now have I?"
Only, Draco hadn't mailed this sweatshirt back. He must have worn it so much over the years that he hadn't even realized what sweatshirt he'd conjured from his home. The letters were a bit faded, but when Draco turned, Harry could clearly see the infamous
wrong
The playful grin that had been on Draco's face had fallen the second Harry stepped towards the snake. They had been chosen to be paired for Lockhart's dueling club, and were having fun, until Draco shot out the snake. Snape had stepped forward to get rid of it, but it was too late.
"Hmm, difficult, very difficult." Harry jumped as a voice came from the hat when it was placed over his head.
"So it's true, then? What they're saying on the train? Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts."
When Dumbledore said nothing, Harry continued on. He passed Snape, McGonagall, and Moody, using his willpower not to wither under their stares as he made his way to the back room where Cedric, Fleur, and Krum would be waiting.
And the lines on his face. One might have thought that this seventeen year old boy was actually forty instead. Worry lines creased his forehead and grime covered his face. Of course, whether it be luck, or irony, or neither, his scar still lay stark-white against everything else.
She could not tell you that Draco had grown so distant that he was too far away to hear the sounds of Harry's heart breaking.
He finds the wall he's looking for and paces in front of it three times.
Draco Malfoy is seventeen, just like Harry.
"Yeah, I did," he said softly. "All thanks to you."
done countless of times before. But he was frozen. Frozen with guilt and shame and sorry and every horrible feeling as he stared through the open doorway into Harry's warm apartment.
best friend!" He yelled, then his eyes widened as though he didn't mean to say that out loud.
For a moment that felt like an eternity, neither of them said anything. It had been a year since Draco's arrest, and it very clearly affected him. The sunken cheeks, hollow face, dull eyes, hair that brushed his nose, and ripped clothes, said so. But when Harry looked into Draco's eyes, he knew Draco was still there. Draco had not succumbed to the Dementor's evil, soulless, ways. He had held on, and he was alive. For now.
"Why?" Draco snapped, pulling his arm from Harry's grip. "Why are you with me? Is it pity? Hm? Or do you just feel obligated to be with me because you feel bad or something-" Draco's angry rant was cut off quickly when Harry pressed his lips to Draco's.
As he walks, Harry's eyes flick up to a circular, black, wired birdcage that hung from the hall's ceiling and frowns, noticing that there's only one bird in it. Now, Harry may have dropped Care of Magical Creatures two years ago, but even he knew that a singular bird that small didn't need a cage that large.
Harry definitely did not meet Draco's eyes now. He bit his lip and looked out of the window. They clouds were grey and stormy, as though reflecting the moods that everyone felt in the courtroom today.
Harry, who had lay in his hospital bed, giving Fred and George his Triwizard winnings and assured Ron and Hermione many times that he was alright and recounted the story to Dumbledore, but could only think about Draco and was relieved out of his mind when the boy arrived, holding him tightly.
Harry Potter could do and deserved so much more than a Death Eater.
Once he found the right one, he went back to their table and sat across from Malfoy, slamming the book in front of him. Malfoy didn't jump, but arched one pale eyebrow as Harry grabbed at his messy black hair.
In the end, it was decided by Barty Crouch that Harry was to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. He was now binded into a magical contract that couldn't be broken and would be performing in three tasks over the course of the year.
"I don't have an issue," Draco replies instantly.
Harry dropped his head on the table.
"Then," Draco whispered gently, taking a step away. "I'm sorry."
, I must ask you to leave-"
"Malfoy."
Salazar Slytherin
Things were much simpler when he was eleven, or twelve, when Draco was too naive to realize what his feelings toward the Golden Boy. Back then, everything was easy. Back then, Draco's walls were built up high, his defenses were secured.
"What's that?" Ron asked, curious as ever, and choosing the worst possible time to look up from his plate full of breakfast. "Whoa, Harry. You look like you could murder a Horntail. What's wrong?"
"Survival over the Yule Ball?" Harry asked lowly. "Survival over Hogsmeade dates and kissing and spending holidays together? Survival over sneaking out to the forest and studying in the library?"
"What?" Harry blinked, stupidly.
Before he could lose his wit, Harry led his younger boyfriend through the Azkaban entrance and into the dark prison. He gulped, keeping his eyes off of the insane and depressed prisoners who were either muttering to themselves, screaming at anyone who walked by, or both. Ethan kept very close to Harry, but of his hands wrapped around Harry's arm. Harry didn't mind. It reminded him he was human and he felt and he thought and he had a soul.
"Come on," Harry held out his hand to Ethan, who was peering over the edge of the cliff, a terrified expression on his face. There was also sadness there, and Harry knew it was the effect of the Dementors. Harry leaned to him and grabbed his hand, making Ethan look into his green eyes. "Let's just get in and get out, yeah?"
Draco, who had been called to McGonagall's office and was told that he had to go into the Black Lake for the second task because he meant most to Harry, but he could
Harry was silent for a minute that seemed to stretch much longer than that. "You left out something," he said finally.
Ron rolled his eyes and walked away, Seamus still at his side. Harry, still bubbling with anger and wanting to get this done and over with, arched up to Cedric and asked to talk to him privately. They stood a few feet away from Cedric's fan club, and the older Hufflepuff frowned at Harry. "Look, Harry, about the badges- I've asked them to stop wearing them-"
"H-Harry!" He exclaimed, hastily wiping at his tears. "What the hell are you doing here?"
. Harry shivered to and walked to Draco, taking his hand and pulling him inside, closing the door behind them.
Like,

me, at least. But that started a while ago, not because of the Tournament. So, I won't lie- I need help. And who better to ask than you?"
"Malfoy."
Then again, Draco wasn't Ron. And what Harry had with Draco wasn't the same as what he had with Ron. He didn't know why, yet, but he'd get there.

to the Ball, Draco could have taught him how to dance.
Harry walked toward her bed and threw himself on it with a loud groan. “Draco and I are sharing a room.”
“Well, there was a time, a few weeks before Christmas, where Ron left. We were all frustrated and feeling disillusioned with the task Dumbledore had given us and Ron was the first to snap. It was awful, Harry and I barely talked those weeks, we were so wretched. I think Harry feels that Ron’s going to slip away again and that this time he won’t be able to find his way back to us.”
“I will do no such thing! I cannot believe I am being slandered by my own boyfriend. I’ve never felt so betrayed in my life.” Draco moaned into Harry’s neck.
“Hermione’s going to kill me. I was supposed to do the rounds with her. Why didn’t you wake me?” Harry continued to squint at Draco, his glasses tucked away in Draco’s pocket.
Hermione waved her off and they headed out toward the Great Hall.
“No. I guess I just got in my head a bit and my thoughts started taking on a mind of their own.”
“Hey Draco. I was wondering where you two were,” she whispered so as to not wake Harry. “I was looking for Harry so we could start our rounds.”
The trees were a blur of green as the train flew through the countryside. Draco couldn’t believe that he was getting to see this view again, in a much more peaceful frame of mind than the year before where everything seemed so hopeless. And he owed it all to the messy mop of hair currently sleeping on his lap.
Harry looked into those deep grey eyes; he knew Draco would never pressure him into doing something he didn’t want to do. He nodded.
Harry hugged Draco’s waist and placed a soft kiss over his heart, “Thank you.” He whispered.
Harry moved over to look at Draco’s tray and picked up a biscuit, “You made them too thin, they over baked a bit.” He took a bite. “Still good though.”
Harry got up and walked to Draco and hugged him from behind, resting his head on Draco’s blond locks. “I’m sorry.”
Draco gave Harry a fond but exasperated look, “Sometimes I don’t think you’re real.”
Harry considered that for a moment, “Guess you’re right. Though I don’t think she anticipated us being together. I wonder if she’ll try to change it now.”
As they both began unpacking their belongings Harry started thinking about what exactly it meant to be sharing a room with Draco. Did he expect their relationship to move to the next step? Despite spending the entire summer together, they never actually spent an entire night together. Draco was always wary of leaving his mother alone for too long and Harry just wasn’t ready to spend an entire night with Draco. He was afraid that the nightmares would scare Draco off. Now however, there was no other option. Draco would find out just how damaged Harry was, and he might reconsider their relationship. Harry didn’t think he could handle living with Draco for an entire year if they broke up, it would hurt too much and after everything he’s been through, he isn’t sure he would be able to survive one more person leaving him.
I've discovered that I am terrible at ending chapters. I'm not particularly happy with the end of this chapter but it did give me the chance to introduce a few things that will become relevant later on. Hope you enjoy it!
Draco groaned and buried his face in Harry’s neck. He started placing small kisses on Harry’s neck and began moving up his face and peppering kisses all over Harry’s face. “I think we should stay in bed a bit longer.” Draco said as he adjusted himself between Harry’s legs.
“An old lullaby that my mother used to sing to me when I was a child and the shadows in the manor scared me.” Draco said, still avoiding eye contact.
“No, no but. I am here and I will continue to be here. I’m not about to let you go now I’ve got you.” Draco said and kissed harry gently on the lips. “Now if we are done with this nonsense, I think it would behoove us to go to bed early tonight seeing as you idiotically stayed up unnecessarily late last night and we both know how worrying makes you even more tired.”
Harry leaned over to Draco and whispered, “Finally something that I’ll do better in than Hermione. You should have seen her trying to make a lasagne over the summer, nearly burned the kitchen down. Kreacher banned her from going anywhere near the oven after that.”
“Nope, sorry. Admit it, you are a closet romantic. I bet you can’t wait to surprise me with a horribly sentimental gift as soon as the right moment arises.”
“He’s told me some, but I suspect he’s keeping the more gruesome aspects to himself. Doesn’t want to burden me.” Draco sighed.
Harry Potter and
Draco Malfoy could handle living in the same room together then surely the other houses could be cordial at the very least with each other. McGonagall couldn’t have known that the aspect of Harry and Draco’s relationship had changed so drastically over the summer, otherwise she might have had second thoughts at allowing a couple to share the same dorm.
“Back to the matter at hand, what is it that is really bothering you about our room sharing?” Draco said, tone shifting.
Harry woke up half an hour before the train was due to arrive at Hogsmeade.
“You are an idiot if you think a few nightmares are enough to have me running for the hills.” Draco said, placing his hand on Harry’s cheek.
“I just thought that maybe you’d want some help. I know you might not have much experience doing things the muggle way and I spent the first eleven years of my life as a Muggle, so I’d be happy to help out.”
“Why ever the hell not? Doesn’t Weasley expect you to be his partner when you start training?” Draco asked just as quietly.
“I’ll tell him. Thanks Granger.” Draco said.
“Not really, no. Now, tell me what has you so worried that I’m going to corrupt you.”
“No, of course not. But what if he wants us to share a bed or move our relationship along.” Harry moved to lie on his back, hands on his stomach.
They started out making tea, Merlin knew Harry would need it before the day was done. He presented them with the tea kettle, “Okay, we are going to start by making some tea. We’ve got a tea kettle for each of you to fill and set on the stove to boil.”
“It’s in the past, I’d rather forget about it and move forward. With you.”
Harry looked over at Hermione “But what if he can’t handle it and ends it. Then we would be stuck together for the whole year in misery.”aHarr
Draco walked over to stand between Harry’s legs and gently tilted his head upward. “Just promise me you’ll come up and rest if you need to during your break.” He cupped Harry’s cheek and Harry couldn’t resist closing his eyes at the soothing warmth of Draco’s hand.
“What time shall I meet you?”
Harry sighed again, “No, if we don’t leave now Hermione will begin to worry and I’ve let her manage our responsibilities alone long enough.” He got up off Draco’s lap and straightened his robes and glasses before reaching out to pull Draco up and out of the compartment. They walked hand in hand to the train’s exit. Before stepping out Draco held Harry back, placed his hands on his shoulders and gave him an affectionate kiss on his temple.
Harry walked back to his bed and hesitantly got in. He shifted until he was facing Draco, “This is ridiculous you realise right?”
“I’m going to get you to call me Hermione one of these days,” Hermione said before walking out of the compartment.
Harry shook his head, “No, I dream about that night a lot.”
Harry was it for him and it would devastate Draco if Harry was now having second thoughts about their relationship. He hoped that wasn’t the case, Harry seemed happy and if what Granger told him on the train was true then Draco played a big part in that happiness. Still, the self-doubt was there. After all Harry was the most adored man in the wizarding world, he would have no trouble finding someone worthy of him if he so chose to go looking. Draco, for all his redeeming qualities, was still a former Death Eater and nothing he did would erase that part of his life.
Harry looked down at the tray and gently poked the giant mass. “It looks like they all melted down and formed a giant biscuit.”
“And that’s bad? You spent almost all summer with him, don’t tell me you’ve grown sick of each other already?” Hermione said with a smile.
“Poor little Draco.” Harry said with a small smile on his face. “But by the way you’re avoiding looking at me I was sure it was nefarious Malfoy charm that you used.”
Draco nodded and gave Harry’s hand a quick squeeze before walking out of the room without looking back at either boy. Harry straightened his back and walked toward Goyle who by that point had figured out he wouldn’t be leaving the classroom undisturbed.
The house-elves took that as their cue to barge in with refreshments, having already cleared away the mess from breakfast. Harry accepted a goblet of pumpkin juice and wandered over to talk to the rest of the house-elves, Hermione pulled out a book from her robes and sat at the table to read. That left Draco and Goyle to stand awkwardly by the ovens, unsure of where to go now that they no longer had the excuse of baking to keep them from talking.
Harry wanted to wrap his arms around Draco's waist. He didn't.
Draco let his eyes wander across the apartment he'd become so accustomed to. The Christmas tree in the corner they had put up together and still hadn't taken down. The coat-wrack where all of Draco's cloaks hung (Harry's were thrown on chairs or tables). The photographs on the fridge (which Draco had taken a while to understand) that once were of just the Weasley's and Granger but now were mostly himself and Harry. The candle burning on the counter, causing the place to smell like it's title-
Draco had always gotten Harry. Harry had always chosen him. From the handshake in first year to the Yule Ball to even just partners in class, Harry had always chosen Draco. And Draco wouldn't even glance at anyone that wasn't Harry.
He took a deep breath and nodded.
Draco smirked, too. "Yeah. That's right."
And he finds it. Of course he finds it. His eyes are too trained
Harry, who kissed Draco firmly and told him that if Draco tried to tell a teacher about the
He had to clamp down his teeth on his lip to stop a sob from escaping. He tasted the warm trickle of blood from where he'd bit his lip, but he didn't care. He couldn't feel it. He didn't think he would ever feel anything ever again. Not without Harry. He couldn't feel anything without Harry.
who actually wants to help me."
Draco leaned forward and met Harry, sharing one last gentle kiss that was full of sorrow because they both knew it'd be the last. For a while at least.
It took all of Draco's willpower not to laugh at the look on Harry's face. "Yeah, so, you might want to tell me now if you're the Heir of Slytherin or not."
know. He supposed she had to. She was always too observant for her own good.
Letting go of the hair that he very much had been pulling at, his head whips to Hermione, who has a finger pointing to the plate in front of Harry. He looks at it, and sure enough, the bread is blackened. Hermione raises an eyebrow because she knows that Harry's able to do wandless magic when he's feeling very strongly about something and right now he's feeling very strongly that he wants to slap Draco Malfoy.
now?" He scowled.
he isn't free and will never be free as long as he is under his father's influence.
That had been Harry's first mistake. Being appalled at Draco's actions when they hadn't been any better than his own. But by the time he realized this, Draco and his kisses were gone. Draco was arrested, along with his parents. Harry had forced himself to move on. To be with Ethan.
He saw himself assuring Draco that he would be okay. That he wouldn't let anyone hurt him. He saw himself the night of Dumbledore's death being pulled aside by Draco, who kissed him, He saw himself shocked at first, but then kiss back with just as much force.
As quiet as he can possibly be, Harry pushes open the door and slips inside, closing it before anyone can catch him. When he faces the room, it's the standard Room of Requirement. Piles of, well,
So, with a burden no sixteen year old should have to carry, he raced to the bathroom, accepting the fact that the defenses he'd worked so hard to build were gone.

Harry smirked. "Yeah we're pretty
1) Always get the highest marks possible. Try to beat that damned Granger if possible.
Harry thought that that name was pretty cool until Ron laughed and Draco glared at him. "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe! You must be a Weasley."
Grey met green and both boys felt their hearts stop.
"Know so."
Then he turned sixteen and came to the worst realization of his entire life. He loved Harry Potter. And his morning pumpkin juice wasn't spiked with Weasley's Wizard Wheezes
"Anything else?"
Hogwarts is nothing like Harry remembers. All he can think about as he catches his breath in Aberforth Dumbledore's dimly lit house is what Hogwarts looked and felt like the first time Harry's young, bright green eyes landed on it.
Harry laughed. "Yeah."
"Where is he? Is he alright?" Came the worried voice of Draco. Harry grinned and swung his feet out of his bed.
So maybe they didn't find love where it was supposed to be.
Pansy lifted her hand and pointed a finger down the hall to bathroom, and Harry took off without another word. He practically shoved open the bathroom doors only to be met with a distressed Draco Malfoy.
Harry was now tugging at his hair again. He didn't stop.
Willing himself not to think or feel about the history he has with the boy in the cell down there.

"Are you mental? I've been hooking up with you during every weekend!"
Harry grunted.
Draco was shaking his head, his whole body now turned to face Harry.
Draco looked down and immediately turned the same shade of red that the Gryffindor sweater was. Harry laughed a little and saw the corners of Draco's mouth twitch and thought that Ron might have lied about not being able to switch Harry's partner.
"Malfoy, come with me," Harry said, taking the taller boy and his gang of Slytherins by surprise. Harry turned and began walking towards the castle. He looked back over his shoulder to find the boy standing shock-still. "Coming?" Harry called, turning back around. From the sound of footsteps, he knew Malfoy was following.
"Do it, Draco. Curse me. If you don't, they'll know. They'll know you're slacking. They'll kill you. You have to survive. Do whatever it takes to survive, right? Isn't that what you told me?"

Draco Malfoy has three rules he tries to follow all the time.
Draco looked up guiltily. He opened his mouth, but Harry just shook his head. So, Draco closed his mouth. He looked down, willing himself not to let his threatening tears fall. All he felt was shame, and if his tears fell, he'd feel it ten times worse. One look at Harry had told Draco that, based on the stiff jaw and hard eyes, Harry wasn't happy.
Draco let out a bitter laugh and shook his head, his grin full now. "Oh yes you did."
him. And Draco had just pushed him away.
on the piece of parchment and looked up, glaring daggers at the Slytherin table across the Great Hall. He was met with daggers right back, a cold glare from cold, grey eyes. Harry wanted to get up and yell at Draco right there, but he knew he couldn't. So, he looked back down at the box that held his tie and shirt he had left in Draco's dorm.
Ron, awfully oblivious and awfully hungry Ron, glances up, a forkful of eggs halfway to his mouth, and shoots an eyebrow up in question at Harry's food. The raven haired boy rolls his eyes and gets up, sliding his plate away from him.
He walked forward and descended into the damp and lowly lit dungeons he had visited only a few times before. Twice, when he was a child and his father needed to punish him. As both a seven and thirteen year old, he had spent a night locked up in a cell. Now, at seventeen, he's been doing the locking up himself.
Frowning, Draco sat up and looked at Harry. "You- you need a date, Harry. You're a Triwizard champion, and the champions always dance with their partners to start off the night."
, that no feelings were to get involved. That's how things get messy. That's how people get hurt."
"Are you the Heir?"
Draco lunged forward and caught Harry's face between his hands, slamming his lips against the shorter boy's. Harry stumbled back at first, but wrapped his arms around Draco and kissed back.
Harry wonders if Draco feels trapped. If Draco
Harry's head snapped to Draco in alarm. "What?!
Sighing, Draco ran a hand through his hair and dropped his quill. He barely looked up from the parchment when the door opened and Pansy walked in. He closed his eyes, which burned with tears, and when he opened them, the burn and the tears were gone.
So, all in all, yes, they quite acted like friends. But, were they? Could you really go from three years of being enemies to just suddenly being friends over three weeks?
And with that, he was gone, probably going upstairs to get a drink then back to London to torture more innocent people. That, or out with the others, looking for Granger and Weasley. They wouldn't be looking for Potter. No,
Draco sighed and fell back onto his bed, staring up at the top of his four-poster. "Dunno. You?"
"Would you stop saying his name like that?" Harry snapped. "And Draco's not... as bad as we thought. He's actually been quite helpful, and he's pretty funny, really..." He trailed off at the look on Ron's face. "What?"
"Let you know
Harry, who had grown to be quite pleasant when in Malfoy's company, glared at the redhead. "Well I haven't exactly got
2) Never say too much. If Blaise or Pansy asks what's wrong, don't say anything.
"Draco," Harry said quietly as they walked, and Draco noticed that Harry's voice was shaking. Draco immediately paused and looked at his best friend. "Why was everyone staring at me like that?"
Harry opened his mouth and some hissing noise came from it, getting not only the snake's, but everyone else's attention. Draco's eyes widened when he recognized the sounds as Parseltongue. Well, if they didn't think he was the Heir of Slytherin before, they definitely would. Draco grabbed his friend's hand and pulled him from the room.
"I know we aren't those kids, Draco. But that doesn't mean I don't love you!"
But then he did look at her. And he saw her eyes and how she had to take deep breaths in between each sentence in order to keep her voice steady. And how she kept glancing at Weasley, who would never be Ron, and who would give her encouraging nods. But when she looked away he would turn to his mother and cry on her shoulder.
"Why did you do it?" Harry's voice broke as he finally looked at Draco. "Why did you care about me?"
Smirking again, she mimed zipping her lips closed.
"Who would've thought we'd make such a great team?" Draco winked as he pulled away, but stayed in Harry's arm, his pale face now red.
"Where- where are you going?" Hermione asks, but Harry's green eyes are scanning the Great Hall.
Confusion took over Harry's features. "What? You- you
could sense that. So, no, the screams weren't too much.
Draco, who was so livid with Umbridge for hurting Harry that he threatened to hurt her, only to be told off be Harry himself. And he listened. Because he would never say no to Harry.
Today was not any better than any of the others. In fact, today was
The hospital wing doors burst open, much to the annoyance of Madam Pomfrey. Harry sat up quickly, wincing from the cut near his ribs, but not caring. He had done it. He'd successfully summoned his broom, gotten the egg from the dragon, and made it out alive and in one piece. He insisted on finding Draco, but Pomfrey had rushed him up here instead.
And maybe, just maybe, Harry was okay with that.
Draco scowled. "What? You mean to tell me the

Blaise and Theo caught on when Draco's eyes would not leave Potter at the Yule Ball. When Draco droned on and on about how the Patil twin Potter took wasn't even pretty, and how Potter couldn't dance and if he took
He ignores her. Because Hermione- well. She knows a lot, that girl. She can tell you what the ten most effective fungus are for potion-making and who took place in the Salem Witch Trials. But. She could not tell you that Harry had been in a relationship with Draco Malfoy since the Yule Ball back in fourth year. She could not tell you that right after their two year anniversary, Draco had ended things.
Sadness filled Harry's insides. He knew Draco's eyes and how the deceived him. Draco felt a lot, but of course he wouldn't say so. So Harry just nodded and pulled his hand away from Draco's, ignoring the crashing and burning of his heart in his chest. "Okay. See you around, then.
, I wish I had a camera!" The third- Ron Weasley- laughed. He grinned at Harry, who grinned back.
"And- and I did look at you at the Yule Ball. I knew where you were sitting. Every time I looked up you were looking down." Harry continued. Draco looked like he couldn't decide whether to cry of shame or embarrassment.
Ignoring Draco's protests, Harry grinned and walked closer until he had tackled a struggling Draco into his arms, holding the boy close in a hug. Draco sighed and gave in, wrapping his arms around Harry and hugging him back. "You're my number one, you needy prat. You got that?" Harry muttered into Draco's shoulder.
"Why so tense, Potter?" That familiar and annoying voice called. Harry couldn't help but do a double-take when he looked up to see Malfoy sitting in a tree. Harry smirked and rolled his eyes, the git had probably only gone up there to seem cooler than he was. "My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in the Tournament."
- right now. The task is in two days and I have to go meet with my
"Draco-" Harry's voice came out a bit more choked up than he'd've liked. He cleared his throat. "It's time for your trial."
. It did something terrifying to Harry's heart. Honestly, he's surprised he hadn't needed to gone to Madam Pomfrey yet.
Malfoy, though surprised, just leaned his elbows on the table and said lowly, "Why are you telling me this, Potter?"
They both snapped out of it at the same time, looking away and blushing slightly until Draco cleared his throat and pointed to the book. "Look, this won't help you. You can't research a dragon if you don't know which one you're fighting, because they're all different."
“It’s been okay actually. She apologized to me the first night and since then we’ve sort of settled into a somewhat companionable routine. We even sit together in Antient Runes, she’s really good at it.” Hermione replied.
He tapped Harry’s thigh to indicate he should get up and guided him to his bed, he then went to Harry’s wardrobe and took out a pair of pyjamas. “I am capable of getting myself ready for bed you know.” Harry said, a fond look on his face as Draco walked back to the bed.
“I’m sure she took all our personalities into consideration before deciding on who to place us with. I do wonder if she considered switching you and Draco out given your less than platonic relationship.” Hermione said with a smirk.
Harry rolled his eyes at the sneering tone, but pressed on, “I wanted to ask if you wanted to join Draco, Hermione, and I down in the kitchens tomorrow for a brief introduction in muggle cooking.”
“I’ll try, but you know Hermione once she gets going it’s a bit difficult to get her to stop. Don’t wait up for me, you’ve had a long day too.” Harry approached Draco and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek.
“Now as to my abundance of experience. I want to tell you something so listen close.” Draco said. “My previous experience isn’t something I am particularly proud of. I was angry at my family for forcing me into something I wanted no part in and I took it out on myself. There was little I could control, but what I could control was my body and how it made me feel.” Draco took a deep breath and continued.
“I heard that,” Harry said looking up sternly. Hermione giggled and even Goyle seemed less disgruntled.
“Are you alone?” Harry asked as he walked further into the room.
As the three made their way out of the Great Hall the eyes of the younger students could be felt on the back of their heads. “Really didn’t miss that feeling.” Harry muttered once they were out in the hall.
Apparently, Harry wasn’t as quiet as he had if Draco’s snort was anything to go by. “Chin up Granger, there was bound to be something you aren’t good at.”
Harry looked around the hall, he sighed quietly happy to be back to the one place he would always be able to call home. He looked up at the enchanted ceiling with a small smile on his face, despite the horrors that this place saw it could still hold such beauty within its walls. It gave him hope that one day he would be able to move past all that he and his friends went through.
“We are going to sleep in the same bed, and no this isn’t up for debate. Now, get in the bed.” Draco said, lifting the bedcovers for Harry to get in.
Harry hesitated. “I promise not to jump your bones the minute you’re within arm’s length.” Draco said as he offered his hand. Harry moved to sit beside Draco on his bed.
Harry obediently went to the bathroom to change and brush his teeth. When he came back out Draco had already changed into his night clothes and was lying underneath the covers of Harry’s bed. “What are you doing?” Harry asked as he stopped outside of the bathroom door.
Harry made his way to Hermione’s room and knocked quietly. “Come in.” came Hermione’s voice. He walked in and closed the door. Hermione looked up in surprise and stood from her desk where she seemed to already be working on a timetable for the term. “Harry, I didn’t expect to see you tonight.”
They made their way to their dormitory in silence, both too lost in thought to pay much attention to what the other was doing. Once they made their way into the room Draco went to sit at the foot of his bed. Harry froze at the entrance of the room, as if he were too afraid to take the final step into the room.
“Oh, Harry good you’re here. McGonagall just came by and handed out our schedules, so I’ve started putting together times to meet with all the prefects every few weeks. Is there a particular day that you want to keep free?” Hermione looked up at both boys expectantly.
“I’m never dramatic. I always react to every situation in an appropriate manner, as all well-behaved purebloods do.” Draco said with a raised nose.
Harry fell into the hug and smiled into Hermione’s hair. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. I’ll let you rest, see you in the morning.”
“You were expecting her to put us together?” Harry looked up at Draco, trying to gauge if he was okay with the arrangement.
“That doesn’t make it right.” Hermione said, putting down her book. “All Harry did was speak the truth, it was the Wizengamot that pardoned you, it isn’t the public’s job to judge you just because they don’t agree with the outcome.”
“I’ll help you.” Harry said, “Maybe once you start learning the theory of it all you’ll be able to wrap your head around it all.”
Upon reaching their room Harry was happy to see that it resembled the Gryffindor dormitory in miniature. The familiarity would surely help him keep the nightmares at bay, at least for a while. He only hoped he wouldn’t wake Draco when he inevitably woke up screaming.
Harry whispered back in the most polite and sincere tone he was capable of, “Hermione, you know I love you and you are so very talented in a lot of subjects, but I spent a year in a tent with you and I can say with the utmost honesty that your tea skills could do with some work.”
Harry elbowed Draco in the stomach, “Not helping.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and rested his forehead against Draco’s. “No, no objections at all,” he whispered and closed the gap between them.
Harry was a coward. For all his supposed Gryffindor courage he could not bring himself to talk to Draco so he spent most of the night down in the common room until he was sure that Draco would be asleep. He spent the majority of the time in his bed staring out the window through a gap in his curtains, unable to sleep for fear of waking Draco when he inevitably had a nightmare.
As the sun began to work its way through the dorm room Harry was slowly leaving the pleasant dream that he had succumbed to. He opened his eyes to the early morning sun and tried to shift his body but felt a warm pressure holding him down. Harry looked down at his stomach and was surprised to see a pale arm holding onto him. Then everything came back to him. The talk with Draco, going to sleep together and more vividly, the nightmare he had. He could almost feel the rough wood of his cupboard door.
Looking down at his hands Draco scoffed, “He had the gall to say that our relationship is the only reason I’m not rotting away in a cell with my father.”
Draco knew something was bothering Harry, as the day wore on, he got more and more distracted and by dinner time he barely noticed what was going on around him. The food on his plate was left virtually untouched, that in and of itself was worrying enough as Harry couldn’t afford to miss any meals as it was. He hoped that whatever was bothering Harry he would confide in Draco. Though they had only been together a few months Draco knew that Harry was it for him. He didn’t care that they were barely of age, they had survived a war against all odds and somehow, they fit together in a way that Draco never would have imagined.
“About half past six, we’ll be at Hogsmeade in about half an hour,” Harry stood up and stumbled blindly to the compartment door.
Harry’s returning class were given their own tower as the other dormitories would become too crowded with them all and the incoming seventh years. This meant that the houses no longer mattered in their dormitory, everyone was paired up with a random student whether they were previously of the same house or not. As luck would have it, Harry and Draco were paired up, perhaps this was another of McGonagall’s inter-house unity plans. If
Draco looked over at Goyle, “I grew up in a pureblood household too you know, are you saying you don’t think this assignment would be difficult for me?”
“I suppose yours are perfectly baked, professor,” Draco said as he picked up a biscuit from Harry’s tray and bit into it. Harry smiled at the mildly disgruntled look on Draco’s face upon tasting Harry’s perfectly baked shortbread.
“I didn’t do much really. Once I heard you crying out, I started running my fingers through your hair and talked to you, I tried to tell you that you were safe and that whatever it was you were seeing wasn’t real. That calmed you down some, but you were still a bit restless, so I –” Draco wasn’t sure why he hesitated in telling Harry that he hummed a childhood lullaby to settle him. It felt like an oddly intimate thing to do and he was afraid that Harry would see just how much he meant to Draco.
Hermione lay her head over Harry’s and sighed, “Well in that case, I’ve started putting together a schedule for us. Now, it’s a bit bare but once we get our classes assigned, I’ll have a better idea of where we are at and then we can divide up our duties and meet regularly with the prefects and Head Boy and Girl. That’s really all I’ve got at the moment so I’m afraid you’ll have to go and talk to Draco now and stop hiding out.” Hermione said as she stood up and grabbed Harry by the elbow. “Go on, be an adult and go talk to your boyfriend.”
Draco walked over to his tray of slightly burned but neatly arranged biscuits. “Mine seem to have taken on quite a bit of colour.”
Draco snorted and finally looked up at Harry’s smiling face, “Lucky for you I didn’t have to resort to my more nefarious methods.” In a more serious tone he said, “Do you want to talk about what you dreamt about?”
“Well, this is cozy.” Draco said as he walked into the room and sat on the bed that housed his trunk. Harry was happy to note that the house-elves remembered he favoured the bed nearest the window.
They whiled away the rest of the afternoon in their room, basking in the comfort that they brought to each other.
“Come on, the prefects I left in charge must be getting restless by now. They weren’t too happy to be supervising.”
Harry smiled to himself, “After breakfast, we’ll meet outside the Great Hall.” As he walked out of the classroom, he couldn’t help but release a sigh of satisfaction.
“Well, yes. I don’t think Harry will every stop being a mess in some capacity, but he’s a lot better than he was and that’s thanks to you.” Hermione stood up and headed to the door, “Tell Harry I’m fine doing the patrol in my own and he can help me set the prefect schedules after dinner.”
Draco.
It was Draco's turn to glare. "Why? You want to know why? Fine! Because even though the world around us is going to war, Harry, you still act as though we're the same innocent fourteen year olds we were when we fell in love."
She didn't. She frowned and walked over to his desk, her bright eyes scanning the paper, and widening as she read. When she finished, her eyes drifted down to the open drawer to see five more letters folded and marked with an H. Smirking, she grabbed the one on the desk, along with the others, slipped them into her pocket, and left the dorm.
"What?" Harry asked in a small voice.
Harry noticed instantly the the bird was shock-still in Draco's hand. Even thought he was unsure of what exactly happened, he knew that the bird was dead. And that by Draco's shaking hands and pale face, this wasn't a good thing.
? I don't know how to do that!"
? Well, that explained it. "Harry, you were speaking a different language," Draco started. "The language of the snakes. The language of You Know Who and Salazar Slytherin himself."
, it was worth the wait."
Ignoring Ron's "Where're you off to?", Harry raced out of the common room only to be met in the hallway with Pansy Parkinson, who was smirking. Harry froze and studied her for a moment before it dawned on him.
Harry pointed his wand at the lock on the cell door, and it opened with a click. A Dementor peered its head through the hole in the wall across from Draco's cell, and Ethan backed away, sliding his hand into Harry's, which didn't go unnoticed by Draco.
in Draco's eyes.
But the second he opened back up his internal gates, it was Harry Potter who had been waiting there. Harry Potter who cause pain far worse than any hit from his father or any hour that crept by without food. Harry Potter's pain was far worse.
, stacked to the ceiling. Utter nonsense that no one needs. Or, that everyone needs.
Draco wanted to say it back. And he would have, if his voice hadn't betrayed him and left. So, he did the next best thing.
Draco, who used only memories of Harry and in turn produced a stag Patronus that matched Harry's perfect. That night was full of kisses and smiles.
However, when fourth year rolled around and Potter's name was drawn from the Goblet of Fire and Draco knew what the tasks were because his father had told him, his blood froze. He watched Potter with wide eyes during the first task as he battled a dragon and winced when there were close calls that were a bit too close for Draco's liking.
Stopping beside the trunk, Malfoy jumped down and smirked, walking over to Harry. "He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five."
Harry, against his own will, slowly smirked, letting his eyes flick down to Draco's chest. "Nothing. Just- nice sweatshirt."
friend," Ron mumbled, laying down in his bed and pulling the covers up. Harry opened his mouth, utterly appalled at what Ron was saying. He looked to Neville and Seamus for help, but they just turned away.
When Neville showed up through Ariana Dumbledore's portrait frame, wearing an excited grin, the thought hit Harry like a truck. Neville was just a

were okay.
As Harry passed through the archway into the courtyard, he bumped into a taller figure. Ron, walking with Seamus. Harry glared at him and said, "You're a right foul git, you know that?"
Harry let out a tired and annoyed sigh, and pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment, eyes closed, before looking back at Draco. "No, Draco. I'm Head Auror, I have some authority. They're not keeping you overnight. Now, get up. That is, unless you want to stay here overnight..."
And with that, he turned on his heel, and walked away.
3) Do
A pang of what suspiciously felt like jealousy ran through Draco as he scowled at the red-haired boys.
"You never made it easy."
. Including the Slytherins. Including Draco Malfoy.
"Let's go."
- - -
"I'm not!"
The boy nodded to the two larger boys next to him. "This is Crabbe and Goyle," he took a step forward so he was in front of Harry, on the step above him. "And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
Merlin
The screams almost became to be too much. Almost. They didn't, though. They couldn't. Because if they became to be too much, that meant that Draco was weak and the Dark Lord could sense that- his
He hated Harry Potter with every ounce of his being. He hated how he could spit out as many insults as he'd like but his heart wasn't in any of them. He hated how his feelings for Potter were the exact opposite of hatred. And he would never harm a messy hair on that boy's head, if he could help it.
that you won't waste that."
Draco didn't seem to care about any of this. His face split into a smile and he rushed forward, throwing his arms around Harry's neck, hugging him tightly. This caught Harry by surprise. He couldn't remember if he ever hugged Ron, let alone as happily and passionately as Draco was hugging him.
"Is Salazar Slytherin your ancestor?"
Draco put the bird down and closed the doors, leaning his head on them. Then, much to Harry's surprise, he started to cry.
"Thanks again, guys, you two are geniuses," Harry walked over and high-fived the twins. He then fist pumped Ron Weasley, who was still smirking at Draco, who was sitting on the floor in his girl clothes, feeling awful inside.
He wished he wasn't. Harry Potter looked awful. His hair was longer and messier and his once bright eyes were dull. He was covered in grime and dirt, and his was sickeningly pale and skinny. Draco bit his lip, guilt crashing over him in waves.

So, yes, Draco had broken his third and probably most crucial rule. Crucial to surviving, at least. And surviving was beginning to get more difficult, especially when it depended on Draco's ability to murder Hogwart's headmaster.
Grief. Malfoy is feeling it, and Harry has felt it countless times before. They go tumbling off of the broom as the great doors to the Room of Requirement slam shut behind them. Harry groans and sits up quickly, Malfoy doing the same. The Slytherin freezes and catches Harry's eye. There's tears glazing over the silver-blue Harry always found so different and so intruiging.
So, with a deep breath, Draco launched into the story and explain what happen. How the man jumped him and how Draco shot a spell to get him off. What the man had said to Draco right before the Aurors arrived. How the Aurors blamed Draco.

He watched Draco lie at the Manor and save Harry's life. Saw himself pull Draco onto the broom. Saw himself refuse Draco's kiss this time bc he had seen in his dreams the amount of killing and torturing Draco had done in the Manor.
Draco leaned over to Hermione and whispered, “How is it that he’s able to do this so effortlessly but put him in a potions classroom and he turns into a hippogriff in a china shop.”
Harry cheeks pinked up, “Draco reckons I’m the only one McGonagall trust to not curse him in his sleep.”
“Hmmm,” Draco nuzzled Harry’s neck as he slowly woke up. “Hello darling.” He gave Harry a quick peck on the neck and tightened his hold around Harry’s waist.
At the front of the class Professor Jones began talking about the concept of electricity. “Now, electricity is difficult for most everyday Muggles to understand so do not feel discouraged if you don’t quite understand how it works as a power source. It can be a complex science and you typically need prior knowledge of other Muggle sciences. For the purpose of our class all you need to know is that electricity gives power to many of the Muggle appliances that we will be looking at this year. Of course, given that Muggle contraptions do not work within the walls of Hogwarts I have been given special permission by Headmistress McGonagall to take you all on a few little field trips throughout the year so you can see these things in action.’
He had to look away. Harry hated when Draco did that. When he leaned forward. When he smirked lightly. When he arched that

"Listen, you hate me, right?" Harry raised his eyebrows as they entered the school, and Malfoy said nothing. "Well, you definitely don't
Harry smirked and raised his eyebrows, pushing off the counter. "Dead, am I? Is that right?"
. You took everything, and now I get to take everything from you."
"Hey."
When Harry woke up every day after that, he kept hoping it was all some horrid nightmare. It wasn't. Every day for the next two weeks, until he faced reality, he had to deal with Ron ignoring him, dirty looks and insults from
But they found it.
"Parkinson," Harry said lowly, "Where is he?"
He hadn't noticed Harry's entrance, so Harry quickly ducked behind a pile (well, more like tower) of books and watched Draco from behind. He was standing in front of a dark and sophisticated cabinet. Holding his want to the sealed doors, Draco muttered words Harry couldn't hear, and then opened the doors. He bent down and placed a bird inside.

"Draco!" Harry exclaimed, clambering fully out of his bed and walking around the screen covering him. He still wore his champions uniform and his face was grimy and he probably stunk of sweat.
Ron shrugged helplessly. "Power of the elderly. Can't defy her."
Harry blinks, reality forming back around him. An older version of Draco Malfoy stands above him, biting his lip nervously. Without a second thought, Harry grabs it and Malfoy pulls him up. Before he pulls his hand away, Harry shakes it.

But now Draco was here and Harry found himself wanting to do nothing more than slap himself for being so naive before, and then hug and kiss Draco and pretend that everything was okay and that
