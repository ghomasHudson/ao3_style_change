“I…I’ll just go and get changed. It’s a bit chilly like this. I’ll be right back,” he lied, and quickly stepped out into the hall, closing the kitchen door behind him. Pressing his back into the wall beside the door, his heart pounding away in his chest, he tried to hear what was being said.
“You’ll let me know when you got settled in, in Wiltshire… I know it’s not that far away, but if you’re not here, at least make sure you miss me.”
“I’m afraid I need you to say it out loud.”
“I think we did it,” Draco said, his voice still hoarse from the earlier screaming as he looked outside. The storm had simply disappeared as if by magic and now the warm rays of the evening sun as it was just about to set fell in through the window, lighting his room with its warm golden glow.
“It seems like your pain lessens when I touch you and from what I can see the swelling and inflammation actually get less severe where my skin touches yours. I want to try if it matters who touches whom and what happens if we let go again.”
With Pansy’s help it didn’t take long for Draco to get dressed and cleaned up. They walked down the stairs together, her hand tucked in the crook of his arm, squeezing it reassuringly. The closer they came to the front door, the slower his steps became. He could feel cold sweat break out all over his skin and felt bile rise in his throat as panic threatened to overwhelm him. He started shaking uncontrollably, his steps faltering and stopping several metres from the main door.
“What do you say if we make some new memories for you to hold onto? As many and for as long as you’ll have me.”
“Fine, come with me.”
Harry’s answer was entirely non-verbal. He pulled Draco forward again and kissed him gently.
“Would it… Do you want to meet at the Leaky again later? I promise not to get too plastered to remember, but I’d really like to continue this conversation,” Harry said, feeling like he was going out on a limb. If Draco said no, there was no way that Harry would be able to protect him without Draco becoming suspicious. It was strange that as it was, Draco had swallowed Harry’s lies about the night before so easily.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Do you want me to stay until you feel better?”
Draco’s own terrified screams were what woke him.
“What are you looking at me like that for Gin?” Harry’s voice sounded slightly strained as if he was trying to keep his temper under control. His statement was followed by a long pause, until finally Ginevra decided to reply.
“I’ll be right over. I’m almost done.” Draco carefully spread some more dirt across the roots of the freshly planted lavender and gently firmed it down with slow even movements of his hands. When he was finished, he got up, carefully brushed the earth from his fingers, patted the dust of his trousers and went looking for Harry.
Harry carefully knelt down beside Draco, not yet sure whether he should wake him. He reached out and touched Draco’s cheek his skin was cold as ice. Decision made, he quickly withdrew his hand, got up and cast a series of spells on Draco, one drying his clothes, one warming him and one reducing his weight to next to nothing. Harry tenderly lifted the sleeping figure and held him close. Part of Draco seemed to realise that he was being carried inside, because he snuggled closer, pressing his nose into the crook of Harry’s neck.
“m'sure, he stays!”
“What do you mean?”
The air around him shimmers and weaves as if he is walking through water. If Draco moves his hands it seems to ripple and he can follow the waves until they reach the mother of pearl coloured walls and flow back to him, amplified but immaterial as they pass through him on their return. There is no sound, but the noise of his feet hitting the stairs. Draco knows he should probably be worried, but the warm light fills him with a sense of calm unlike anything he has felt before.
“Thank you. Will you take a seat?”
“Oh Draco, I am so sorry dearest, what a fucking arseh-“
“This,” he said and pressed his wand against the rim of the
After that night, Malfoy came by the lighthouse almost every day. The runes in the doorframe were slowly followed by runes on the floor, the windowpanes and eventually runes scraped into the bedposts in Harry’s bedroom.
“Wait.”
“Remember what you promised. You can’t stop now.”
It was one thing to stand guard over Draco in his invisibility cloak but using the ministry’s resources to follow him was completely insane. If he got caught, he would be drummed out of the ministry for sure. And then what would he be? A failed Auror, a failed hero and just another victim of the war that got left behind, because he was unable to adapt to the rapidly changing world around him. If he wasn’t an Auror anymore, how would he be able to protect Draco? His insides clenched painfully at the prospect.
“What the hell are you even talking about, Draco? I love you. I don’t mind that you changed the way you did, because I love who you are and not just some idea purely based on looks. I love how grumpy you are when we do Muggle Monday and I know that you only indulge me, because you know it matters to me.”
“Have you been following me? Is this some misguided attempt to get a story out of me for your best friend Ms Skeeter?”
Potter lips were slightly chapped but somehow Draco didn’t mind, simply enjoyed the slide of their mouths against each other. He untangled their hands to get a better hold of Potter, climbing into his lap and turning his head this way and that to get better access. They kissed for a long time until Draco’s lips felt puffy and slick with saliva. He wouldn’t have wanted to have it any other way. He broke their kiss, to pepper a series of pecks along Potter’s cheek, his nose, the closed lids of his eyes, his forehead and finally on the corners of his smiling mouth.
“Yes, Sir, Harry Potter, is something wrong?”
His hand still burned where it had come in contact with Draco’s skin, filling his mind with images of what could have been.
“I just told you to wait for me Potter. Can’t you even pay attention to the simplest instructions or do you need me to write them down for you?” Draco’s voice sounded sharp and out of place in the quiet of the library. He cursed himself for losing his temper over something as trivial as this.
Harry’s hand began kneading and stroking the hard length through the thin fabric that was soon stained with the first drops of pre-come. There was nothing tentative about the motion which made Draco wonder who Harry had been with before him. An irrational jealousy flared inside Draco and he kissed back almost angrily. He chased Harry’s tongue back into his mouth intent on making him forget any other person he might have kissed before.
“Well, being this perfect all the time isn’t easy.”
, a recent addition to the numerous magazines on the wizarding world’s favourite sport.
“Alright, alright, I’m awake now.” The huge yawn following that very statement belied its contents. “Or well, getting there.”
“Harry, please.” The voice broke. It sounded so sad it made his heart ache, but he didn’t understand why. “Come with me, we have to go.”
“Sorry, I am so sorry…”
“I know, Mother, I know.” He sighed. “I’ll be right down.”
“Yes.”
“Dunno, maybe a glass or two?” Potter seemed to seriously consider Draco’s question, counting on his fingers, when he came to five he returned his hand to Draco’s thigh and nodded. “Yes, two, no more.”
And suddenly he was floating. The pain had been replaced by numbness. Nothing penetrated the barriers around his mind. He looked out of his eyes as if they were a spyglass. Everything seemed unreal and far away, he could see Pansy touching his arm but he felt nothing. Curious the part of his mind that hadn’t fallen to pieces thought,
“I’m ready.” Draco is visibly bracing himself against the pain.
“There’s nothing to talk about, Malfoy. Now if you’ll excuse me?” The pressure on his foot increased as Harry tried to close the door. The ‘Malfoy’ had hurt.
Draco thoughtfully held the shell to his ear, not expecting to hear anything but the amplified noise of his surroundings. He almost dropped it, when – just like Pyxis had described – he heard a steady heartbeat. Draco held the shell at arm’s length studying it closely, noticing that the handprint had disappeared and then held it to his ear again. The heartbeat grew steadily louder. It felt as if with every sound something was pumped through Draco as if there was some kind of circulation, secondary to his own.  With every pulse he was overwhelmed with a feeling of longing and of love. It wasn’t as simple as desire or lust, Draco realised as wave after wave of feeling washed over him, this love was something so essential so pure and powerful it felt as if it was there only for him. He closed his eyes for only a moment wishing that he was capable of such emotions of loving and being loved like that, for himself with all his faults, for his soul and not for some ridiculous misguided notion of what he ought to be or was pretending to be.
They’d bought it together and the only reason Draco had decided to buy it was because when he’d tried it on, Harry hadn’t been able to keep his hands to himself, continuously running them up and down his arms and feeling his pectoral muscles and flat stomach through the soft fabric.
Draco looked towards where she had vanished long after she had gone.  It was at least another twenty minutes until he made his way downstairs to his own room. His mother must have been the one who had searched his room, it was the only explanation. Draco was both relieved and confused. He didn’t know what to feel about this. He felt betrayed, because his mother obviously didn’t trust him enough to take care of himself, but then he also felt loved, because he knew how much it must have taken for her to overcome her reserve and act on her worries.
They alight on the chaise lounge, a hand width’s distance between them, that feels like a vast ravine and Harry has no idea how words are supposed to bridge it. Draco is the one who is brave enough to speak first. He tells Harry of his time at Hogwarts while Voldemort was staying at his house, tells him how hard it had been to accept that Harry would hurt him the way he did, the scars a constant reminder and the fixed glamour he began to wear now a part of his very being. He talks about being lonely and how a loveless marriage hadn’t changed his feeling of constant alienation.
“Do you know how long it took me to get him to agree to leave the house after what happened? It took months until he would even talk to me or Floo to my practise and just because your stupid, fat mouth is not connected to your brain at all, he’s locked himself in his room again.”
“Well, at first there was the accident and while all of us where in the hospital wing to visit him one time or another, you never showed up. Not even once. And then the hickeys began to fade, both his and yours and while I know you went camping the year after and would have been away, this time you weren’t. I always thought it was a bit of a shame.”
As if snapped out of a trance, Potter took a hasty step back, his hands however were still entangled in Draco’s hair and sent his new glasses flying. They both heard the distinct sound of glass cracking, as the spectacles hit the floor.
“But what if they hurt you?”
Draco shakes with fear, unable to stop his body from broadcasting his emotion to the watcher at the window. He is straining his eyes in a desperate attempt to penetrate the darkness all around him and still he cannot make out who or what is attempting to gain ingress into his home.
“I’m not sure that’s even possible. If what you say is true, it’s probably protected against anything we can come up with.”
He tried to get his frantically beating heart under control by taking a couple of deep breaths and folding his hands reminiscent in that of a prayer, he knew his knuckles were turning white with the pressure he was applying, but he didn’t dare look to check whether Mrs. Malfoy had noticed his terror. Harry almost missed what Mrs. Malfoy said next.
He knows they are causing a commotion. His breeding kicks in and he tries to calm the angry creatures around him down, but every calming motion seems to only aggravate them further and all his apologetic words vanish unheard in yet another stream of bubbles. Draco feels scared again as more of them crowd around him and as if that wasn’t bad enough the air begins to grow cold.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Really now? And how could you possibly know that?”
“Where is my son?”
The lengthening shadows were shrouding the rose Harry had given him in darkness. The petals were now the colour of blood, twisting the symbol of hope and love into something darker, something dangerous. It loomed there over his bed, the long fingers of the shadow it was casting creeping towards him threateningly across the bedding.
“I can't-“ he stopped again, the memory still vivid in his mind it felt as if he was still staring down at where Draco Malfoy of all people had his cock in his mouth. It hit him then, the ridiculous notion that despite the lust and the gut-wrenching need, what he felt more than anything at that moment was something so much more than affection.  It was:
“There’s one good thing you can say about Mrs. Black, she had impeccable taste in choosing her roses.” He inhaled once more and then tried to hand the rose back to Harry.
“You just have to trust me, Draco, I can’t explain.”
“I was just topping off my mug for the fif—eh, second time, when he burst into my office.” Potter thought for a moment. “I tried to ask him what he wanted, but he simply kept coming closer, which was a bit weird, considering we don’t even shake hands usually.”
A fish wearing a dinner jacket and a top hat walks up to him. He puts on his monocle and eyes Draco from top to toe and finally Draco can see that he is wearing nothing but his dark green satin pyjama bottoms and that his feet are covered in grass stains. The fish looks at him disdainfully and begins to speak, but all that comes out of his mouth is a stream of small round spheres, like soap bubbles, that slowly drift into the air.
The night out is fun. When Harry sees his chance, he mentions to a slightly tipsy Percy that he needs to have access to some patient files and health statistics for a case he’s working on. Percy generously invites him to come to his office the next day, before Oliver pulls him away.
“Technically, I won it fare and square, Potter.”
“No it’s not alright. I shouldn’t have… Merlin, Malfoy you don’t even fancy me… I didn’t care, I would’ve…”
Harry, his Harry didn’t want him, didn’t need him. He’d accused him of not having a heart and maybe it was true. Draco felt empty inside as if half of his soul was missing. If he didn’t have a heart, it was because it had stayed with Harry.
Everyone was currently sitting in the living room, enjoying a glass of wine and laughing. Harry had just headed to the cellar to fetch another bottle when he heard a knock, so tentative to be almost inaudible, at the front door. He answered, even though he wasn’t expecting anyone else.
“I think we did it.” He said looking at his handiwork, not quite managing to keep a note of awe out of his voice. “Go ahead, have a look.”
“Witches and wizards?”
“But this could be anything…” Harry began only to see Draco smirk at him.
Draco was here, he was really here! Harry wouldn’t have been able to believe it, if it hadn’t been for the strong arms that held him. The time apart seemed to have been nothing but a bad dream, he was here with the man he loved and that was all that mattered, not how he got here or what happened, just this. Death and loss were a thing of the past, even Ginny. Ginny and the baby, his baby that he would now never get to know.
“I, …what? I don’t understand.” Harry whispered, clinging to Draco’s shoulders. Draco nuzzled the place behind Harry’s ear that he now knew drove him to distraction and then traced his nose along the shell of his ear, before beginning to speak. “You drank the potion, not me. You got yourself drunk and that’s why you couldn’t keep your naughty hands to yourself, but when I kissed you, all traces of the Firewhiskey and what was in it had already been washed from your system. You didn’t drug me, you understand?” Harry still looked confused when Draco pulled back.
“I did, but…”
“A few items, working under an assumed name really helped with the international sales.”
“I’m sorry. I truly am Draco, but if he’d known what’s good for him, he’d have held on to you! What are you going to do about it?”
“I am alright Potter, is there anything in particular you wanted, or are you craving worthwhile company at last?”
“Thank you,” Harry said, his voice coming out sounding strangled.
“God, you are hopeless!” Draco exclaimed after having watched Harry chase his pasta around his plate with a fork for the last two minutes, getting tomato sauce everywhere and making a mess of his shirt. He pointed his wand at Harry under the table and cleaned the stains from the fabric without a second thought and then reached for Harry’s plate with his own fork.
and that was enough for him. It also appeared to be enough for Draco, whose smile at this moment was something Harry would never forget.
The dew clung to Draco’s hair and eyelashes, making them sparkle in the bright light. His entire body was covered in tiny drops of water, the light from Harry’s wand turning them into liquid diamonds as it hit them.
, he thinks, but is too much of a coward to say out loud. Lionhearted his arse.
Draco wouldn’t enjoy that. In fact, he’d hate it if Potter died in the near future, and not only because he was the only one who could vouch for him and keep him out of Azkaban at the end of his sentence.
“You mentioned dreams?” Draco asked.
“Now, please tell me what caused this.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
His tears were quiet and there was no one to see them. He only wished for death, unable to remember anything but the cold and wet darkness and the feeling of being bound without a chance of escape.
“I… what… no! James!” Harry had jumped up and was shouting. It couldn’t be. His baby had to be okay. This couldn’t be happening. “I need to speak to Ginny!”
He was still hoping to somehow get back that funny if slightly desperate thing they had had that night at the pub but most days it seemed as if that Draco had either never existed or was slowly fading away.
“Then, you are here with me right now, because…because you love me?” Another nod.
No, there was no way around it. He would have to come up with a plan to speak with Harry somewhere away from the public eye. His newly found hope was somewhat derailed as the crack of house-elf apparition startled him out of his reverie.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Draco waited whether he would say more, but Harry had fallen silent again, all his courage seemingly spent on those few words.
“What about Luna?”
“Okay.”
Suddenly Harry bolted upright, startling Draco, who almost spilled his wine.
Draco felt himself move towards Harry, excitement and arousal curling in his gut at the look of raw desire in Harry’s eyes.
What Luna has led him to discover is likely to go up much higher than just a few badly filed reports and it wouldn’t do to alarm the wrong people at this time where he can’t prove anything. So he goes back to his first source, not Malfoy, he’s not ready to face him again, despite desperately wanting to know what happened to him and whether he is ok.
“Draco Malfoy fancies me,” Potter sing-songed.
Draco ran his hand along the dark wood of the mantelpiece, not a speck of dust clung to his finger. Harry had definitely been thorough in his efforts. Around a series of holiday photographs, they’d arranged some pebbles, seashells, bits of twisted gnarled old wood and a few feathers they’d found. There were many photos. Like always, Draco’s gaze was immediately drawn to his favourite picture of the two of them. Despite what others might expect, the ones from the holidays in Paris or Barcelona weren’t Draco’s favourites, his favourite was one they’d taken at the beginning of their relationship during an impromptu weekend trip to Hogwarts.
“I’m sorry. I just couldn’t let you leave like that. I don’t even know whether you want this, want me, but I had to try. Please, before you say anything, please think about it. And if you do, if you want this or if you don’t, send me an owl.”
Harry was genuinely worried about Draco, because the few times he had caught glimpses of him in the last two weeks, Draco had looked haggard. If only Harry could figure out what was wrong with him then maybe he could fix things. Not for the first time Harry wished that his silence about the matter wasn’t part of the contract he had entered into. He knew that if he could just be honest with Draco, he wouldn’t feel so disgusted about himself. Every time he had seen Draco, except for that first time in the pub, he had lied to him.
“Master Draco has asked Poxy to make sure Mr. Harry Potter leave the premises and check that Mr. Potter is not loitering.”
“I said my legs don’t bloody well work no more!” Harry exclaimed jumping up and proving himself right by promptly falling against Draco, clutching the man’s robes in a desperate attempt to keep upright. “And and and not beyond reason… just in-… what’s the ruddy word? Inhibition! Beyond inhibition, that’s exactly how drunk I am. Which I am not at all, I’ll have you know.” He vehemently gesticulated in front of Draco’s face before losing his balance again.
“Right. I’ll see what I have access to right now. I’ll request the rest and send it to your office later. I’ll be back in a bit.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked.
Draco sat up to investigate and surely there they were, hundreds of delicate elderflowers were spread across the wooden floor and the dark sheets like stars across a clear night sky.
A loud squealing noise rose from just beside his head and he could feel whatever had a hold on him slackening and sliding to the floor.
“Will you shut up,” Potter interrupted him. Draco found he was too gobsmacked to be able to offer a witty reply. “Shit, I think they followed me.”
Harry’s hand gently brushed over the marked skin, almost making Draco jump as he hadn’t expected Harry to be quite so bold. Shivering at the intensity of the other man’s stare as he caressed the Dark Mark, Draco still couldn’t have torn his gaze away even if he’d wanted to.
It had become harder with every day. Draco seemed to crave physical contact. The nature of Draco’s sentence denied him even the simplest human contact. Harry began to consider it rather cruel when he saw what that deprivation did to Draco.
Holly looked even more distressed at Draco’s tone and he felt a slight twinge of guilt.
Draco was as stiff as a board, before he buried his face against Harry’s shoulder and melted against his chest and let his arms sneak around Harry’s waist. Overcome with affection, Harry pressed a quick kiss to the crown of Draco’s hair, who hugged him even tighter.
“Do I look like I care?” Potter snarled, flicking his wand at the open door, making it slam shut with a resounding crash, without even once looking away. Sudden fear washed over Draco. Nobody would care what happened to him here. Nobody would even ask questions why Death Eater scum had accidentally tripped down a flight of stairs and got hurt in the process.
did those people end up like that?
on the square and they all join each other hanging over the space like a giant rainbow coloured upside down bubble bath. The fish pokes Draco in the ribs and it actually hurts.
“What time is it?”
“Takes one to know one!” The banter still came easy to them and added something surreal to the situation.
“Your wife will make a full recovery Mr. Potter.” Relief flooded Harry at those words only to be crushed when the healer continued. “I am afraid we couldn’t save the baby. Her fall caused early contractions which we were unable to stop and the foetus was too weak to survive. I am sorry.”
Draco stares at his bucket and then the crate behind him, doubtful that this will work. He hesitates a moment longer and when he looks up everyone else is gazing at him intently. There they stand, a row of people with their buckets half-raised their faces turned towards him and Draco realises that he knows every single one of them.
Draco didn’t know how long they stood there, before Harry began to speak, telling his parents about his life, about where he’d been in the last year and then he began speaking about Draco, about their shared lives and how much it all meant to him. Instead of sadder his voice began to sound more and more cheerful as he talked about how happy he was, about how he felt like he’d finally found a place to call home, where he was loved and accepted and about how he didn’t feel lost anymore, that he’d finally found his place in the world.
He sat up with a start. He was in his own bed, the soft morning light streaming in through the curtains he had forgotten to close the night before. The remnants of the dream clung to him like spider webs and it took a moment before he could remember. He was Harry and he was in his own bed at 12 Grimmauld Place, where he was supposed to be.
Harry was still in awe over the situation. He had never in his wildest dreams believed that he would be here now with Draco Malfoy of all people. He couldn’t have imagined wanting this as badly as he did, and most of all, he couldn’t have imagined Draco wanting to be here with him. For the first time in his life, it felt like being “just Harry” was actually enough.
Luna seems to hear something that Harry can’t and opens the door wider, letting him in. He strides past her, but all he catches of whoever was with her, is the faint sound of a door closing at the back of the house.
“Talking is overrated,” Draco replied after he let go of Harry’s cock. He twisted his fingers and rubbed against Harry’s prostate making him see stars.
Draco shook his head. He thought he knew what Harry was talking about, but surely it couldn’t be right.
Finally acknowledging that the only non-mouldy thing he can wipe his hand on are his robes and not in a million years is that an option, thank you very much, Draco draws his wand and casts a quick Scourgify on his hand.
“Exactly, what does it look like to you in this context though?”
“Yes.” It came out as barely a whisper.
After that, things had changed between them. Their relationship of earlier years hadn’t been restored, but Harry had become Draco’s protector, and as the months passed, he had come to care for him more than on a simply professional level. Seeing Draco open up to him, even seeing glimpses of his old snark, had delighted him.
He didn’t know how long they lay there, but after a while he could feel Draco’s softening prick slip from his hole, followed by the odd sensation of his come. It wasn’t the most comfortable feeling, but he still couldn’t seem to make himself move.
The water was cold and pleasant against his skin and the sound of rushing of the river as it passed by them, was comforting.
Draco didn’t quite meet Harry’s eyes, even after he had spoken to his house elf. It was almost as if he was afraid of what Harry would say.
“Sorry,” Draco said, not sure what he was apologising for. His pulse had quickened and for a moment Draco worried that his heart might beat loud enough for Harry to hear. Silence began to stretch between them until it became strained. Draco eventually lost the fight with his body to not clear his throat, at the same time that Harry spoke up again.
“I – no. I’m not, I was just doing some last minute paperwork before the holidays.”
His therapist’s smile seemed strained and Harry felt even worse when she went on to say, “If you must know, my little girl is sick and I need to go home to take care of her.”
“What’s going on,” Draco mumbled, his eyes still closed against the glare of the brightness of day. Apparently one of the after effects the mediwizard had mentioned was increased photo-sensitivity.
“Oh God, no, please no, it can’t be true,” Harry choked out, before tearing himself away from Draco and being violently sick onto his expensive carpet. His entire body shook and heaved until his stomach was empty, the shock of events finally having caught up with him.
Harry turned towards them, which was when Draco realised that Harry the reason Harry was flushed was because he was furious.
His hands were wet with perspiration, and his heart was hammering away in his chest like a tiny frightened bird flapping its wings desperately trying to escape the confinements of its cage. The sharp lines of the carved wood cut sharply into his back as he pressed himself against the door, his breath leaving his mouth in short panicked gasps.
The memory began to fade slowly as the last grains of sand trickled out of the bottle. Draco was overwhelmed with what he had learned and now remembered. What Harry had chosen to show him had become intertwined with his own returning memories. It was all true. He could remember everything from that night, every touch, every word they had spoken, even remembered the feeling of Harry’s wand pressed against his temple.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Harry, look!”
“Sorry, what?” Draco swallowed again, noticing that he was leaning back into Potter’s warmth. Merlin’s beard, he hadn’t heard a word that Potter had said. A dark warm chuckle and more warm breath against his ear were the only response.
At the time Ginny had been waiting in the atrium already cross with him, because he had made her come to the ministry during their week off, because he had forgotten to forward a case file to a colleague. He promised himself he would make it up to Draco later, and when he’d walked into his silent house after dropping Ginny off at the Burrow, he felt overwhelmed by guilt. Draco had obviously retired already. Some impulse he couldn’t explain made him enter Draco’s room. Harry could make out the half uncovered form of Draco’s sleeping body lying on the bed. As he stepped closer his gaze fell on Draco’s face, his features strangely vulnerable in sleep touched something deep inside of him. He found himself tucking the covers over the sleeping form, before Harry could even think about how inappropriate his behaviour really was.
Finally Harry turned to Draco, his eyes cold, he plunged his hand into Draco’s open chest and tore out his still beating heart, that was somehow still attached to him. Baffled at the fact that he wasn’t dead yet, Draco just stared.
Harry slowly closed the door in his face.
“He’s m’friend! I like talking about him, he’s fun!” Harry replied without much conviction.
Harry leant in close and pressed one last gentle kiss to Draco’s perfect lips. His upward motion to withdraw was cut short when Draco’s hand shot out, holding onto his neck and pulling him in for another desperate kiss, almost as if Draco knew that Harry would leave soon.
Draco had had enough. He gripped and twisted Potter’s wrist with such force it must have hurt a lot, considering the whimper that escaped his lips. His wand trained on the door, Draco tensed as a cheerful ‘ding’ announced their arrival at their final destination. The doors creaked and shuddered open, nothing like the smooth glide from only a few floors up. The tangle of grappling limbs trying to force their way inside would explain that.
During the next few days, Harry became an even more permanent fixture in Draco’s life, reading to him during the day, even though Draco was recovering quickly and would have been perfectly able to read by himself and cradling him protectively by night. Suspecting Harry enjoyed the shared activity as much as Draco did, he didn’t say anything.
“Pansy, don’t!”
I am sorry we fight
Back in the room he sank into one of the chairs in the sectioned-off area, Potter was still working, but in front of Draco now stood a hot cup of tea. He wrapped his, by now, cold hands around the mug and inhaled the steam rising from the liquid. Careful not to burn his tongue he took a sip, not entirely managing to suppress the moan that escaped him when he noticed that the tea was exactly how he liked it. Two sugars and a splash of milk; in other words, perfection in a cup. He didn’t have time to reflect on how whoever had prepared the tea for him knew just how he liked it, because at this moment Potter approached the table and sat down opposite Draco.
“No, I’m bloody well not alright, I went to bed in my own room and I woke up beside you.” he looked down at himself his eyebrows rising, “On top of that, I’m apparently almost completely starkers and wearing your clothes. You should be glad I don’t know where my wand is or this conversation wouldn’t be as pleasant to you as it is right now.”
“Because I was scared, because it’s such a big step and I didn’t know whether I was ready. I still don’t know to be honest. The last few days without you have been terrible, I thought I’d lost you and that it was all my fault for not being ready or able to commit to you. I was afraid that I wasn’t able to give you what you deserved. And I still am.”
It was only when his hand was already turning the handle that he noticed the soft shimmer of light seeping into the hallway from under the door. Maybe Harry was actually at home; maybe he was waiting for him in their bedroom, just waiting for him to come home. Draco’s heart sped up at the thought, filled with fear and anticipation alike. Anticipation won out and he stepped into the room, a happy smile lighting up his face, despite his worries that Harry might not want him back.
Harry had been pacing in agitation at Grimmauld Place for what felt like eternity. The only thing that kept him sane was the constant motion. He was afraid that if he stopped if only for a second, the despair and loss would break over him like the crest of a wave and carry him away back into the darkness.
The house elf seems delighted to do its job and Harry guesses that’s because Draco had probably forbidden it access to his private quarters after the attack. Once everything is done, Harry motions towards the bed. Draco sits on the very edge of the mattress, fretting with the sleeves of his shirt and not quite willing to undress now that the time has come.
After that Draco went back to devouring Harry’s prick. Overwhelmed by the glorious feeling of having his cock sucked, his head fell back onto the pillow and he voiced his pleasure in a loud moan. Harry could feel his hips involuntarily thrusting up into Draco’s warm slick mouth, that motion however was soon prevented when Draco held his hips down as his head bopped up and down quickly a few times.
She told Harry that she’d spoken to a few of her colleagues who would be willing to work with him, if he wanted, but Harry refused. He did want to talk to someone about everything that was going on inside him, but he wanted it to be someone he could trust unconditionally. With Ginny’s departure the number of people he trusted had shrunk to two – and even Ginny had not been allowed to see certain sides of him.
“Is anything the matter, Malfoy?” Potter asked innocently, as if the letters hadn’t just changed into words.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“I was thinking we could cast wards on the doors together. Since you don’t have a wand we need to find a way to combine our magic.”
Pansy gave him a look that made him shrink away. What was it with him and being affected by other people’s facial expressions, Malfoys should be above this, surely. He was the master of the Malfoy eyebrow for fuck’s sake; he should be able to handle other people’s looks. Still he felt himself whither under the force of her glare. He reached for the beanie, he had come here for a reason after all.
“Let’s say twenty and above, up until eighty to ninety.”
Her voice is melodious and strangely compelling where it materialises in his mind. Draco believes her. Still he hesitates as if waiting for some confirmation. The woman smiles at him benignly and offers him her hand to take. The skin exposed as the fabric slides up is paler than even Draco’s skin.
“I asked what the fuck is wrong with you?”
Draco feels his vision grow fuzzy. This doesn’t feel like a dream anymore, this feels real and he begins to understand that he is actually dying. He is too weak to keep fighting at this point. Draco wants to cry and maybe he is, but the water swallows up his tears like it did his scream. His vision slowly grows dark and his eyes drift shut. His single regret that he never told Harry.
Only when the trial begins do they find their way back into each other’s arms. It’s Harry who initiates it and Draco who doesn’t protest, but rather pull him closer. Harry takes his time kissing all the scars, first the big ones, then the smaller ones, every kiss another apology and the last ones Draco will allow him. They both know they have to move on from the past and forgive each other to able to stay together.
Unexpectedly a piece of paper slid from between the pages and sailed slowly to the floor. Draco could tell there was something on it, but the picture had landed face down and he had to bend low to pick it up. When he saw what it showed, he could feel his face heat. It was the picture of a young man, who lay among the debris in what seemed to be an artist’s studio. The broken remains of an easel, brushes and paints were arranged all around him. He looked peaceful, as if he had just been overcome with exhaustions and decided to bed himself down on torn canvas and broken furniture. Draco couldn’t help following the lines of his relaxed body with his fingers, but he avoided touching where the artist had drawn the man’s flaccid penis, which in itself seemed uncommon because it had been drawn in such detail and touching it felt too intimate.
“Hello?” Draco asked, curious where the shop owner might be, he definitely must have heard the sound of the bell, the shop was not that big.
Panicked Draco turned around but for once luck was on his side and the coat Harry had chosen was the same one he would have picked. Instead of throwing a tantrum like a child, he admitted defeat and simply nodded.
“I was actually looking for some blueprints of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. I don’t know what year the house was built in though, all I know is that it’s located near Kings Cross Station. I really hope this doesn’t make it too inconvenient to look for.” Potter said, as if the words couldn’t force themselves out of his mouth fast enough.
“Luna, I know you said you wouldn’t reveal any of your patient files to me.” He says and quickly adds “and I respect that,” when it seems like she is about to protest. “I looked into the data available to me without raising too many red flags, but I need more. I don’t want to pressure anyone into anything that would endanger them. I was just hoping you’d be willing to ask some of them to speak to me. For this case to move forward, I need confirmation and I need reports to be filed and people to press charges. If that doesn’t happen, I’m not sure how to help them. Especially since the only person I know who wanted to press charges won’t talk to me.”
“No, I meant-,“ he paused again, his hands picking at the fraying border of the duvet, “Could you stay here, in my room.” He swallowed, “with me.”
Harry raised his hand, requesting silence before anyone else could speak. He pinched the bridge of his nose and then pushed his glasses back up.
“Would you... can you take it off?”
He picked her up at her flat and they apparated to the gallery together. Pansy was wearing one of her delicate handmade black lace masks that hid half her face. Draco wanted to tell her that it made her look like a female version of the Phantom of the Opera, but he deep down he understood her need to hide just too well. That curse attack that had disfigured half her face had never been resolved. It had just become another name on a long list of anti-Slytherin hate crime victims. When it became apparent that the Ministry for Magic was not even investigating those crimes properly, there had finally been an outcry. Despite most attackers never having been caught, the victims received compensation because of judiciary negligence.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“…you’re going to catch your death… For fuck’s sake Draco, you’re scaring me! Talk to me! What happened…” her panicked sounding voice drifted in and out of his consciousness. She appeared to want something from him but he couldn’t for the life of him figured out what.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Are you even listening to me? I was worried sick! You haven’t been home in days and now you have the audacity to tell me I don’t care about what happens to you? Well, fuck you Potter! Fuck you!” He stood suddenly, his hands braced on the cluttered dark surface of his desk, staring at Harry, barely contained fury marring his normally calm features. “You dare tell me that I don’t care? Why did you even come back if you think that? Why didn’t you ask one of your little fanboys to come over and pick up your things if you were that desperate to get away? Oh yes, you didn’t get in touch with them either, that’s why! You let me on a merry chase to try and find you, because you were sulking like an immature four-year-old with no concern for anyone else’s feelings. Selfish, that’s what that is!”
Harry still hadn’t seen him and Draco felt stunned into silence by his mere presence. He’d dreamt of this moment for weeks, and seeing Harry in person all flushed and excited, even with anger, brought home to him just how much Draco had missed him. It finally compelled him into action. He realised that he must have made a noise, because Harry turned towards him. It was obvious that it took him a minute to recognise who was hiding in the shadows behind the bookcases.
Draco ran to his room, throwing on a different shirt and struggling into a fresh pair of trousers in record time. His hair stood on end but a quick spell took care of that and by the time he was bending over to tie the laces on his shoes Harry was already standing in his doorway.
“Hey Luna, I...”
“That’s kind of fucked up.” Is the first thing Millicent says to him, it makes him reel for a moment before she continues, “but then so are you and so is Draco. I believe things will be fine eventually.”
“Shhh, it’s alright, I won’t leave. I promise.” He gathered Harry’s shivering and shaking form close and placed a gentle kiss on the crown of his head.
Draco’s thoughts provided promptly. He barely managed to keep his treacherous lips from spilling his secret.
“Yes, Mr Potter. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I am here now Harry, I won’t leave again, I promise.” Draco bent down and gently kissed his boyfriend. “Open your eyes Harry, I am still here and I am not going anywhere.”
The pleasant respite is interrupted when a shadow falls across him. Harry reluctantly opens his eyes, a half-arsed excuse already on the tip of his tongue when he comes face to face with Draco Malfoy.
Potter’s breathing changed almost imperceptibly and his strong arms tightened around Draco, apparently he hadn’t been careful enough.
“Well, it worked with Rafferty, didn’t it?” Draco spat.
“Alright, for now remember to always carry some kind of tissue for your eyes. Eyebrows are necessary to stop the sweat dropping into your eyes and depending on what you get up to, it could get seriously painful.”
“So, what are we going to do about this?”
unfair to you.”
“Don’t worry,” he said, indicating his wand, “I’ll be careful.”
He carefully bent down and turned the picture over. This one was obviously by the same painter who had done the portraits on the wall, but this time the man wasn’t alone. The man with the intense eyes sat in a high-backed armchair, which Draco could have sworn still stood in his father’s study. His legs were crossed and he held a walking stick in his hands leaning it against his knee. Another slightly older man with fair hair and bright eyes stood half hidden behind the chair, while his hands rested on the backrest, left and right of the younger man’s head. His dress was distinctly less elaborate and expensive than that of the man Draco assumed to be his ancestor and his features didn’t suggest any family resemblance whatsoever. Why one of his ancestors would choose to be portrayed with someone so obviously below their station, Draco couldn’t explain.
“Did you hear that?” Potter asked, his words tense but still slightly slurred.
He tried to get up again and the pain, even though expected, made him pause for a moment. Draco couldn’t breathe, something aside from Sophia was on his chest and constricting his lungs. Bright spots began to dance in front of his eyes as the thing shifted, making breathing even more difficult. Draco shuffled around under what could only be a heavy beam. It eventually came loose and tumbled to the side.
“When?”
Draco nodded in acknowledgement and swallowed nervously when Potter stepped closer, pressing his front to Draco’s back and sliding his hand along Draco’s arm until both their fingers touched Draco’s wand. Potter’s other hand alighted on Draco’s hip and he couldn’t suppress a shiver when Potter began to whisper an explanation into Draco’s ear. This was neither the time nor place, but Draco was only human, even if he would deny it, if pressed for an answer, but no matter what he might have said, resisting against Potter’s closeness, especially after as long a dry spell as Draco had had was nigh impossible.
“Oh Harry.” Luna looks at him pityingly. It’s obvious that it’s not for what happened when he was a child.
Draco knew he would have to fight his way through them to get to the pedestal in the middle of the room, but for once in his life he didn’t care. Harry made a distressed sound as the tentacles drew tighter around him and Draco saw red. He rushed the villagers, firing spells left and right and never losing sight of Harry.
The darkness sweeps down, and Draco whimpers when he becomes aware of the horrors the creatures around him have turned into. His breath comes out in great panting gasps, fogging in front of his face as he runs. The darkness has caught up with him and is overtaking him easily now. The bubbles above him ring out like bells as they slowly freeze over and collide with each other. The ones that burst against him while he still tries to get away are filled with snarls and growls and make him wish he had never set foot on the large square.
“No, actually I don’t. I am on leave from the Aurors at the moment. As for making babies, I quickly discovered that’s not for me.” Potter replied, refusing to rise to the bait.
Harry’s legs were no longer squeezed between their thrusting bodies. His thighs had fallen wide open under Draco’s assault. In those moments of thrusting, writhing and pushing Harry couldn’t have said where he ended and Draco began. It was as if they had become one being shrouded in lust and need and want.
“Am not.”
Draco could only nod as Harry repeated his offer from earlier. The last thing he felt before his senses were swept up in wave of passion was the jerk of apparition.
“I… may I come in please?” This was going wrong already, Harry could feel it.
“Among other things, what I will ask of you concerns my son.”
Looking more closely Draco realised that the man’s body was covered in love bites and scratches. Someone had taken possession of him, had claimed him as his own and the way he lay there clearly told the story of how much the man had welcomed it. Draco’s finger rested on one of the bite-marks just on the inside of the man’s knee, thinking about what it might feel like to be marked there. Draco shivered as he imagined how the man’s lover had kissed his way further along the inside of his thigh. He could feel his cheeks grow even warmer and knew that his neck was probably covered in large, ugly red splotches by now, still he couldn’t look away.
“Ginny, please lower your voice, you’ll wake him!”
Harry’s legs gave way and he would have fallen if Malfoy hadn’t caught him.
“I’ll… I’ll just head home then.” He said, voice trailing off, even though no one was paying attention. Shortly before he vanished in the floo, he could see Potter’s dazed look when Ginevra broke the kiss.
Draco barely managed to shake his head. Probably sensing that he was about to come undone. She manoeuvred him into the room she had just emerged from and pushed him to sit down on a sofa before taking the seat beside him and resting her hand on his.
Draco was nervous. He had accepted the fact that he would most likely never have hair again and would have to rely on a combination of hats and hoods for the rest of his life. He was only lucky that wizarding hats hadn’t gone out of fashion. With the way his luck was going it was only a matter of time. He stood in the foyer of Malfoy Manor, tugging on his tuxedo as if to fix its already perfect fit. A hand slapped his away.
“Malfoy, I don’t know how you can think there ever was anything between us. I’m sorry if you have feelings for me, but I don’t have feelings for you. I don’t want you, nor do I think there actually is anything to throw away,” Harry said sounding as if he was trying to cut the conversation short.
“How do you think it’s going? What am I, your secretary?”
“Listen, if you need anything, just send me one of those memos I gave you, they’ll find me, no matter where, even without you having to use a wand. Ron’s waiting for me and I really don’t want a repeat of last month when he thought you’d kidnapped me to have your wicked ways with me and then stunned you. I’ll see you tonight.” His jovial attitude seemed forced but Draco didn’t get to investigate further, because Harry took the chance and – there was no other word for it – fled Draco’s presence.
He is shocked at hearing laid back, holistic, crazy and overall wonderful Luna use language like that.
“Well, I am glad about that. He might be hot, granted, but that nobility of his, ugh!” She pretended to gag. “He’d probably be a boring shag anyway, vanilla all the way. I suppose you were truly starved of decent company in the last year. I’m just glad to hear that you weren’t desperate enough to give in to the likes of Potty.”
“Find what?” Draco said, sounding dazed. He could see Harry smile fondly at him.
“I’ll come by some time later tonight.”
Harry takes Draco’s hand into his and places them both on his thigh, before removing his other hand from Draco’s cheek. There doesn’t appear to be any change.
Potter was on Draco’s side of the desk in an instant, grabbing his arms and pulling him upright, slamming his back into a nearby wall.
When he was close to just leaving a note asking for Scorpius to return as soon as he was finished, he heard a piercing scream coming from the rooms beyond his field of vision. Draco’s heart raced as he threw himself out of the fireplace and into Pansy’s parlour. He hit the ground running, his wand drawn. He knew that voice.
“Me too, Harry,” Malfoy said, trying out the probably unfamiliar feeling name in return.
“Here, look,” he said and went to show Harry how to effectively twirl the fork in the noodles and wind them around it without making a mess and ending up with a bite sized amount of pasta on the fork.
“Draco Malfoy, would you do me the honour?”
When Draco woke in the dream, he was back in his bed, tied to it with thick rope and naked apart from his pants. The sheets were soaked in blood and the little he could see of his torso was streaked with clean open wounds that oozed more blood. It slowly trickled down his ribs. He still couldn’t see the man who’d done this to him. Draco tried the ropes and had to admit defeat even before Harry returned.
He tried calling to her, but his voice was barely audible for lack of use.
Harry observes Percy while he works, like one might a peculiar species of animal in the zoo. Even his movements seem incredibly efficient, like everything he does is something he has put thought into, tested and then decided on the most cost effective way to do it. Watching him, Harry wonders how Percy didn’t end up the wizarding equivalent of an accountant but then he remembers about Oliver and suddenly he gets it.
“I believe, if we could get one or two people who have been assaulted, to press charges or at least attempt to press charges, we will be able to trace what happens to the reports and see who is behind the campaign of blackmail that must be going on for all those assaulted to suddenly claim they fell down the stairs. I believe they would have tried the same with Draco if his case hadn’t been so high profile and even then they just made the reports disappear by misplacing the witness statement itself and neglecting to preserve any evidence.”
Harry didn’t know how much time had passed when they eventually reached the bottom, but it felt like hours. Draco turned to him and grinned sharply, before snuffing out the Lumos. Harry looked around in wonder. It wasn’t dark as he had expected. The walls and ceiling were actually glowing which he hadn’t been able to see because his eyes were so used to the brightness of Draco’s spell.
Harry sat on the edge of the armchair Mrs. Malfoy had indicated and looked at her expectantly. He only hoped he would be able to fulfil her demand, something told him that while he most likely wouldn’t like what she was about to ask of him. Harry doubted that Mrs. Malfoy was likely to negotiate on the matter.
Draco felt like he’d been slapped. The tumult outside the shop was getting louder and by the sound of it the crowd was preparing to break down the door.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
He is so absorbed in his own world that it feels like he’s resurfacing from a deep and dark lake when his mother calls him to her side. Her tone is almost harsh. Draco walks over to her as if in a trance, he doesn’t know how long he stood by the window, but from the look on her face, she’s had to call him more than once. No wonder there had been a rebuke, however gentle. His mother isn’t used to being disobeyed.
“Get out of my way! Let me see him. Right now!”
Harry could feel his cheek heat with embarrassment at what he was about to ask. He hated feeling this vulnerable.
Harry’s eyes were closed while Draco was staring into the flames, eyes unseeing. As comfortable and perfect as all of it seemed. Something was still bothering Draco. Harry had remarked on the strange weather they were having earlier and Draco although supposedly free of the influence of the shell was still feeling drained and exhausted.
Thinking about his reasoning now is painful. He has had enough experiences with cases of domestic violence by now to recognise the arguments. “Look at what you’re making me do.” “If you didn’t break the rules, I wouldn’t have to punish you.” “It’s your fault, I’m like this.” “You know how I get when you do that.” He has heard it all before. Harry is overwhelmed with such a sudden wave of shame that he can hardly breathe.
Draco obeys and only when he does, does Harry cast the spell, taking a sample of the curse and siphoning the thin strand of magic off into the phial before magically sealing the stopper into place.
The tension drained out of the man in his arms entirely and it seemed like he clung to Draco for dear life. Seeing him relinquish the hold on himself and letting the mask of the confident saviour he presented to the world waver, if only for a second, before it was back in place convinced Draco that the man couldn’t and wouldn’t ask for what he needed. Not this time.
Harry just nodded happily and handed him the secateurs.
“But I thought—Harry?”
During the following weeks, Draco began covering all the mirrors in the house. It didn’t help. The dark hours were plagued by nightmares, of the cursed tissue spreading and consuming him whole. Later on, when he began writing to Scorpius to escape his loneliness, after his father had confined himself to the southern wing, afraid, as he said of getting infected, Draco’s dreams turned to the worse.
“Draco, this diary is empty, there is nothing written in here.”
“You’re coming with me.”
“What Harry?”
“Very, very quiet,” Malfoy breathed into the skin just below Harry’s ear and just for a moment Harry could feel his eyes drifting shut as pleasure rushed through him. No! He couldn’t do this. Harry struggled with Malfoy until Malfoy smacked Harry’s hand away so loudly that the men who had just stepped into the yellow circle of light of a nearby streetlamp turned their way as one man.
Harry took a step back at this.
After Merlin knew how long, Draco managed to break the kiss. His entire body was shaking with need.
“He must be close.”
“Potter!” It sounded like an insult.
It had been like a slap to the face, but Draco had left believing that Harry’s friends would inform him when Harry woke up. In the end it was through
— said. Draco would never be forgiven. Not for what he had done, not for his parentage, and not for “getting away with it all”, as
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Potter looked about ready to protest, but Draco somehow managed to expel several angry looking red sparks from his wand and Potter backed off. He sank to the floor in the corner opposite and Merlin help him, the man actually pouted at Draco.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“I suppose it doesn’t make much difference if they don’t really want to know the answer does it? The answer needs to be “ok” or “fine” or “fantastic” because everything else is unbearable. The only person who ever asks me how I am is Pansy and even then I’m not sure she actually wants to know the truth.”
Lying in bed beside Draco every night began to feel strange, because it was completely platonic. They cuddled up almost every night and even during the day, casual reassuring touches occurred more often than Harry could count. Nothing else changed though and Harry didn’t understand why. At this point he didn’t even know if he wanted things to change, because for the first time in a long time he was truly happy. It had been weeks ago when Harry had given up on the grudge he held against Hermione for his forced vacation time. She had been completely right, like always.
Harry cleared his throat when the silence became awkward. His mind however was drawing a blank.
“So where is it?”
They shared more slow kisses, uncaring of morning breath and other complications, simply taking pleasure in each other and the fact they didn’t owe anyone anything. This moment was completely theirs and they would do whatever they wanted.
“I’m sorry,” he says again and this time the small word seems to encompass everything that’s wrong between them and most of which is Harry’s fault. Maybe Luna is right and he’s a bit of an idiot sometimes, this time for letting things get this bad.
“You lied to me.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Gin was late as usual. Harry had received a memo earlier telling him that she would be ten to twenty minutes late. He chose to window shop to pass the time.
“Mother?” he asked, assuming he had been found by the Aurors and was now in his room with the curtains drawn. Draco decided that he must really be out of it, because his bed had never felt this uncomfortable.
“It’s alright; it’s not your fault, besides I could do with some fresh air after being trapped in a stuffy hospital room for weeks.” Draco said, quickly stealing a kiss from Harry before climbing onto the broom behind him.
The smile Draco bestowed upon Harry after this was one of the few genuine smiles in a long time and with it the last of his play-acted protest died.
Harry came home to a note from Draco asking him to meet for lunch to celebrate his quitting the Aurors. Harry fretted over how to reply and decided he needed to sleep over it, before he came to a decision.
He sighed contently, enjoying the gentle caresses and slowly felt himself drift off into a natural healing slumber that he somehow knew wouldn’t be filled with nightmares of one kind or the other. He was safe.
Despite his initial reluctance Harry had started to observe Draco from underneath his invisibility cloak. He only risked watching Draco at night when he would be hidden from sight, should the invisibility cloak slip.
When Harry removes his hands altogether to get a bit of distance between them, the colour flares up again and Draco cries out in pain. Harry hurries to place his hand back on Draco’s skin as fast as possible.
The floor was cold beneath his feet. Draco groggily walked over to the window, but just when he was about to close it, the wind brought the scent of freshly mown grass and just something that seemed to scream
He had reached the ground floor and the lush carpet muffled his steps as he approached the dining room, he was just about to open the door when he heard hushed voices conversing inside. Draco put his ear against the door trying to hear what was going on inside, not feeling the slightest twinge of guilt over eavesdropping on his mother in their own home.
Suddenly he caught sight of movement out of the corner of his eye, just by the window. Without conscious thought, Harry rushed over there to check. A relieved sigh escaped him when he saw that everything was alright. He could hear thunder in the distance and decided that he must have included the natural phenomenon in his dream. He stood by the window, resting his hands against the cold glass, the solid feel comfortable underneath his fingers.
Harry sat behind the desk in Lucius’ Malfoy’s study. Mrs. Malfoy claimed that it was where her son spent most of his time and she was keeping him occupied downstairs so Harry could search the room.
“Promise me you’ll tell me if anything I do is hurting you, ok?”
Harry was distraught. He shouldn’t have done this, shouldn’t be here with Draco, he should sit in the hospital like any good husband and wait for his wife to deal with her own sorrow so she would see him. He shouldn’t have tried to forget his grief by seeking out Draco and sleeping with him. And yet here he still was, dressed and ready to go, but still perched on the side of the man’s bed. Draco’s hair was ruffled and spread on the pillow like a white-gold halo. How could anyone not love this image. How could anyone resist or even want to. He knew that after tonight things would never be the same for him.
He sits up again, trying to push whoever is still hovering over him away. The person he can’t see in the darkness of the room tries to calm him but only makes it worse. Harry fights against them and manages to get away. He ends up pressed against a wall, frantically taking in his surroundings. It’s too dark to see anything but shapes all of them vague and threatening.
“Uhm.”
“I believe you were leaving.” Draco says indicating the way they came in, a house elf is standing there, ready to take Harry back to the gate.
Despite Draco telling him that he loved him during their last encounter in Harry’s office, Harry hadn’t been able to believe him. It probably was just because Draco didn’t have more worthwhile company that he thought himself in love with Harry.
It was still dark and Draco couldn’t tell whether it was because it was dark where he was, or because his eyes were closed. Deciding to put his theory to the test he tried to open his eyes. On the third try bright light assaulted his retinas and instead of trying to open his eyes, he now squeezed them shut to keep out the bright glare. Next he tried speaking, but all that came out was a croak. He tried again, more forcefully this time. “Where…?”
“Harry, what’s wrong? I really need to speak with you. Please let me in.” Draco knew he sounded dangerously like he was begging, but he couldn’t really make himself care.
“...do you think he was targeted specifically?”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Harry was stunned into silence. He had blown it, had blown any chance of happiness. Draco was conferring with someone on the other side of the door, closing it slowly in his face without even so much as goodbye. A house-elf appeared beside Harry and apparated him outside the Manor gates and beyond its wards.
“Indeed, however there is one memory or incident that I cannot quite place. It’s incredibly vague, but all I remember is something about someone not wanting me to leave and then going to say that whoever it was loved me. Do you know what the significance of that might be?”
“Bugger,” he said weakly. “Did I really—?” He left it hanging there.
“I’m investigating cases of domestic abuse and since you know they are an underreported crime I need access to statistics with suspiciously high rates of accidents or accident prone witches and wizards.”
He didn’t stay to watch but went into the kitchen instead. The coffee machine sputtered into life and started to slowly dispense its life giving elixir into the pot. Harry hit his forehead against the cupboard several times. What the hell was he supposed to do now? It seemed like something was seriously wrong here and somehow Malfoy was all tangled up in it. Harry had no idea where to begin.
“You appear to think you have done me a favour by saving me Potter,” Draco said, “I already owe you a life debt, why did you have to go and speak for me today? Wouldn’t it have been enough that I owe you my life once already?”
“Does what we have, what we feel mean so little to you that you can simply abandon it? Do I mean that little to you? Don’t throw this away Harry. I need you, and I know that you need me too. Just tell me what’s wrong. I need to know!” Draco’s voice was shaking as he spoke. He had to make Harry see reason, he just had to.
Harry spluttered as he tried to find his balance and gave chase. He managed to get up after the second try only to realise that he was completely starkers.
Draco suddenly turned serious.
“It’s weird, I always thought I’d feel something, his presence maybe, but I feel nothing.”
Lost in thought, he didn’t notice when Draco stopped and almost knocked him over.
“You look absolutely gorgeous with those glasses, you know that, right?”
Above him the sky has turned black and the light from the fountain reflects in the thousands of hovering spheres that clink and ring, making them look like stars. The rider leans down off the horse and reaches for Draco. If he didn’t know better Draco could have sworn the rider was offering him his hand. There is no time to think about this as suddenly all the spheres above him drop to the floor, shattering into thousands of sharp pieces, showering him in shards that bite into his skin and make him stumble backwards. The noise is so intense that even covering his ears isn’t helping.
still did.
Draco held her close to him, speaking softly into her black bob.
The hand let go of his and he could hear footsteps retreating and then returning shortly after. A hand was placed behind his head, gently tilting it forward, while the other was also very gently pressing a glass against his lips, helping him drink several small sips before the glass was removed. With the telltale sound of glass on wood reaching his ears, Draco concluded that it must have been placed on a night stand or something similar. His eyes still held tightly shut, he felt a soft cloth brush across his dry and brittle lips to remove the drops of moisture he hadn’t managed to swallow. The hand lowered his head back to the pillow and was then joined by another, both of them cupping his face, thumbs gently running over his cheeks.
“So, what you’re saying is that you decided it wouldn’t hurt to open your Christmas present delivered by owl and wrapped in WWW paper today at work, while you were catching up on paperwork.”
Both of them were grinning at each other now.
They weren’t human. Harry had once described his recurring dream to him and that was exactly what Draco saw. Reptilian faces with huge eyes, slitted noses, above thing lips covering grey pointy teeth and bodies that had elongated arms with hands that ended in vicious claws.
“I’m not sure this’ll help, but what if we both took our clothes off?” Harry asks.
“You’d be a right Arthur Dent then, wouldn’t you?”
19th century. Harry read all the pages the spell indicated had recently been read by Draco, but they didn’t give anything away. For some reason Draco had read up on about fifty years of Malfoy family history during which nothing had happened. Mrs. Malfoy had told Harry that there was no way anyone could have tempered with the records. The book wrote itself as members of the family were born, got married, had children and eventually died. If someone was awarded a medal by an official magical institution that information would also appear within the book. Mrs. Malfoy had explained that no amount of magical tampering or spells would be able to destroy the book, unlike with family tapestries, if someone was born a Malfoy, even as a bastard child, one would appear within the family chronic.
Draco complies and Harry kneels beside him, his wand at the ready.
Locking the door behind him, Draco leant against the cool tiles of the bathroom wall, eyes closed, panting as if he’d just stumbled across the finish line after a particularly taxing marathon and pressing the heel of his hand against his inappropriate reaction. What the fuck was wrong with him? He was here to get a pair of prescription lenses for Merlin’s sake, not to sport a raging hard-on after going insane over the fact that it was Potter of all people who was going to mar Draco’s perfect features by turning him into Draco “Four-Eyes” Malfoy.
“Now this might actually hurt. I’ve never had to cancel a curse that has been attached to a person for such a long time. While I really want you to tell me, if what I’m doing is hurting you, I’ll probably only be able to stop at certain intervals.”
It took a long time for Harry to fall asleep. I wasn’t like it had been for the last few days, when he didn’t know that anything or rather anyone was missing. Now Harry found himself turning over, seeking Draco’s warmth and finding nothing but cold sheets and loneliness in its stead.
“Hey, that hurt,” he shouts but all that comes out of his mouth are the same bubbles he can see rising upward all around him. The fish crowds him, and Draco stumbles backwards into someone else. An angry giant blackbird carrying an umbrella pushes him back towards the fish. Under the bird’s umbrella Draco can see bubbles bump into each other and then float upwards when it becomes too crowded for them under the umbrella, as the tirade that is no doubt flowing from the bird’s beak steadily adds to them.
“I also heard that you might not be opposed to spending Christmas Eve with a certain available frightfully attractive bachelor, if he was asking.”
“You don’t mean that. Tell me that you don’t mean that Draco!” He didn’t even care how pathetically pleading his voice sounded.
“I was there on the roof that night, petrified under the invisibility cloak.”
He can’t take it any more. None of it. The terror that comes at night, the jibes that he pretends don’t hurt and most of all, the one person he craves to be with but can never have. Defeated Draco sinks to the floor by the window, pressing his cheek to the cold glass, feeling just as lifeless. If only he could stop feeling this way, could stop being this pathetic empty shell of human being, driven by a craving that can never be sated. If only Draco could stop yearning for what he can’t have. His mind comprehends the facts and tries to make it easier for him to move on, but his traitorous little heart betrays him at every turn.
“Oh don’t play dumb, Malfoy. Why else would you show up here in the middle of nowhere, wearing a Glamour and hanging out in a Muggle bar of all places. Have you suddenly gone native?”
“How about you?” Draco felt obligated to ask a question in return. “Going to become Mr. Family Man?”
Harry had to call Malfoy’s name several times before he got any reaction out of him and was dreadfully reminded of the night by the cliffs. When Malfoy finally noticed him, his formerly relaxed face clouded over. Harry approached him, forcing his mouth into a smile
He felt his heart sink. This was it then, what he’d been dreading for months. He’d laid his heart and soul bare to the man, who somehow had no trouble getting past all of his defences, and now the man he didn’t want to be without was about to reject him.
He had never spent much thought on whether he might be bi or maybe even gay. Ginny and he were supposed to get back together at some point. It had been years and Harry still felt guilty about not talking it out with her. She was seriously casually seeing Dean and Harry found that he didn’t mind in the slightest. But he had never asked himself why he had got over her so easily. None of the women he had dated since had left a lasting impression.
is getting paid for his work!”
“But he never…” Draco pondered before continuing to speak. Then he pushed Harry away with a shove that was harder than intended and stood up. Harry followed him and tried to hold onto him. His fingers scrabbling for purchase against the fabric of Draco’s clothes. This time Draco didn’t push him further away than arms length. He looked him in the eyes to make sure he was listening.
“Can I come in? Your mother said I would find you here.”
feel that she was so proud of.
This had been a terrible idea, Harry decided. He had known that Draco agreeing to see him was probably due to Mrs. Malfoy putting her foot down. Harry idly wondered how she had done it without giving anything away.
Another year had passed, Draco had taken to getting his potion supplies by mail order so there was no reason to go to London anymore. Even Pansy had given up on trying to make him come with her. She still visited once a week, making sure he took a turn around the garden and ate at least one full meal on that day.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Harry decided to leave just as ‘last call’ rang through the pub. As he was making his way towards the exit he froze, turning to the left. It was almost as if… but it couldn’t have been. There it was again, the faintest shimmer that indicated someone in the left corner was using a Glamour to hide their identity. Harry felt an unstoppable wave of anger crash through him. He turned away from the door and stalked towards where he had seen the shimmer, his wand sliding into his palm. The man looked completely non-descript, everything about him was average and yet, when he moved or smiled it seemed as if his outline suddenly grew hazy. Whoever had cast the Glamour had forgotten to add the motion element.
Oh, Merlin! Has he just let himself get poisoned?
“To be honest, while this will have very little influence on the people feeling entitled to punish someone for the second wizarding war, because changing public opinion and making this practise part of public awareness will take a lot of time and effort, if we can charge someone higher up, maybe even on the level of Minister for Magic, we might be able to bring more of those attackers to justice instead of silently indulging them.”
“Oh God!” Harry moaned, when Draco’s mouth suddenly engulfed the head of his penis. He could see Draco grin around his prick before releasing it with a pop.
“You are too comfortable for your own good.” He proclaimed matter-of-factly. Draco smiled at this, feeling completely at ease. Their unexpected sense of camaraderie was shattered however when somebody knocked on the door.
Draco wanted to say that it was because he had bought it, but ended up telling the truth instead. “I can empathise, you know?” Potter looked at him questioningly.
Draco said smiling.
“I…” Harry didn’t seem to be able to find the words. Instead he settled for kissing Draco, trying to convey through touch what he couldn’t express in words. Luckily for both of them, Draco understood him perfectly.
“Stop it!” he hissed.
“Asshattery?” Harry asks, reduced to repeating the keywords in Luna’s statement.
At that, Draco had returned to the lighthouse and he tried to find Harry. In the end, he fell asleep from exhaustion and he spent the next two days looking for him everywhere. He even went back to the underground city, but found no sign that anything had been disturbed. Eventually, he went back to the nearest wizarding city to Floo for help.
He’d been mistaken about Harry’s feelings for him. Then again, how could he have been, after what had happened between them, after what Harry had shared of himself? Why would he do that if he didn’t feel anything for Draco? Maybe he’d just been convenient. Maybe he’d just been the temporary replacement for Ginevra while she was out of town.
“Please, wait for me,” he calls ahead feeling that familiar brush of bubbles rise past his lips and cheek as they get left behind and hover in the air. Seconds later he can hear his own words resonate around the narrow space as they collide with his pursuer and burst.
Before he could extricate himself, Potter had slammed him into the wall of the lift and was sucking wet kisses into his neck. For a moment Draco gave in, unable to hold back the moans that wanted to spill forth.
Yes, Draco decided, this was definitely the worst Christmas ever. Although except for the part where they were stuck in a lift, it wasn’t much unlike other Christmases he could remember. Potter leant close and licked his earlobe. Why does the universe hate me? Draco thought, why?
Draco felt himself drawn to the writing desk. He made his way towards it, taking care not to step on any of the discarded paper. A single sheet of paper and a quill lay abandoned on the small desk. Only hesitating for a moment, Draco reached out and took the paper. It was a letter, addressed to him. Taking into account the untidy scrawl and the many scratched out words, it had been written by Harry. Feeling slightly guilty, Draco began to read.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
He doesn’t feel the cold anymore, he feels nothing at all. His gaze is fixed on his reflection in the open window. He can feel a small welt beneath his questing fingers and he pulls his collar aside there’s more of them. His neck is covered in red love bites. But that can only mean… Draco spins around, staring at the gate. There’s nothing there and Draco’s spirits fall. He’s ready to give up, go inside and live his waste of a life when he sees a flicker of something not quite there, like the heat haze over a street in summer. Before he can even make a conscious decision he’s running towards the gate, ignoring the sting of the snow against his already icy feet.
“Draco darling, it’s me, where are you?”
No hello, no nothing. But then, maybe Harry doesn’t deserve cordiality from Malfoy. Not after everything.
When Draco’s tear stained hands touched the rough outer layer of the shell the glow brightened until Draco had to turn away because the light was hurting his eyes. The shell began to shake in his hands and turned hot making it painful to hold. Draco was terrified when he realised he couldn’t let go. The shell stuck to his palm and even opening his hand didn’t make it come loose. The pattern of the conch shell seemed to burn itself into the palm of his hand and he could hear himself scream in agony.
He was being punished for every wrong he had ever done. He just knew it. Why else would fate decide to take the one thing from him that had made him happier than anything in his life ever had?
“Oh, for fuck’s…” Potter shook his head disbelievingly and mumbled something that sounded a lot like ‘what a fucking idiot’ before taking Draco’s palms into his left hand casting a healing charm on them with his right. He sounded exasperated as he went on.
“Harry, what are you talking about?”
Harry had transfigured his glasses into a weird Muggle contraption that he’d called shades, he’d held up their camera with both hands and tried to take a picture of the two of them with the lakeshore in the background. Of course it hadn’t worked properly and after much giggling and many tries the photo on the mantelpiece had been taken. It showed the two of them looking into the camera laughing and Harry trying to hold the camera steady as Draco’s advances grew bolder with every passing second. The repeating scene in the photograph ended with them kissing passionately and Harry dropping the camera.
He’d almost dozed off, when Harry mumbled something into his chest.
“Yes,” he whispers and as soon as he has, the dragonfly comes closer and the small man on its back pierces the back of Draco’s hand with his rapier. A large drop of blood wells where the skin is broken. It runs down his hand as he moves to empty the bucket, having trouble reaching around Harry who is now standing behind him and gripping his hips from both sides getting into position.
“I… but how? Nobody has seen him for months, years even; nobody knows where he is, or what he is doing. He probably left the country and has forgotten all about me, happily fucking every bloke he meets for all I know,” Harry said, hoping that it wasn’t true.
“Nope.” Harry smiled and then helped Draco into his coat and some emotion Draco refused to look at more closely curled in his stomach. “Now let’s get to the border of your wards so I can Apparate us.”
Sophia’s anxious fluttering of her wings made him open his eyes again and look around himself. He was in a small attic room, half of the ceiling had collapsed, most likely when he had barrelled into one of the rotten beams, which had then graciously enough, knocked him out for his efforts. It was hard to see by the light from the observatory, because every tiny movement would cause a cloud of dust to rise and obscure everything. Draco could make out a desk and some shelves on the other side of the room, which stood beneath a filthy window, its glass too caked with dust due to years of neglect to let in any light at all. How strange was it that nobody had even known of this room’s existence?
“Who is it from?”
Potter was turning away from him and as much as that surprised even himself, Draco did not want it to end like this. Before they had got on the wrong track, he had actually had fun for the first time in ages. This time it was him that took Potter’s elbow and steered him towards where he wanted him to go.
Draco begins to struggle against her grip and he can hear the pearly laughter again. He waits to make sure she is not looking at him before pressing the Malfoy crest against the back of her hand as hard as he can. The laughter immediately turns into a shriek of anguish and suddenly her hold on him is gone. Draco begins to kick and strike out to make his way back to the surface, the knight’s presence reassuringly close. He can feel Ligeia’s grip slither off his ankle, as the knight grabs his hand and begins to haul Draco out of the water.
“I…no, how could I? We don’t read the Prophet anymore and I haven’t been in London since my case has been reviewed.”
Harry felt Malfoy’s warmth seep into his bones and sighed. He was safe, for now.
Harry opened his eyes and looked straight at Malfoy who was smiling down at him.
“Fuck!” The word didn’t do how Harry felt justice. Just when he thought he’d finally been able to make things right again, fate decided to show him just
Harry was in shock, how was this possible?
“Harry, what the hell is…? Oh Malfoy, it’s you. I should’ve known, who else would throw themselves at my husband like that in public?” Of course, Harry wouldn’t be alone. Ginevra was slinging her filthy arm around Harry’s waist possessively as she spoke.
When his racing heartbeat finally slowed down, he reset the wards and took off his shoes. The flat, located in a Muggle building within a Muggle neighbourhood, was too cold for him to take off his cloak. After casting several heating charms and consuming a lonely meal at the kitchen table, he took a shower and went to bed. If not for his taking a dreamless sleep potion before curling up underneath his cold sheets, Draco’s night would have been filled with nightmares.
“What do you think I should do?”
Draco found he agreed, but instead of telling Potter he was right, Draco simply took off his shoes, folded his socks and carefully stashed them in his footwear, before helping Potter to do the same.
On and on it went until they had to come up for air again. Harry slowly detached his hands from Draco’s face and wound them around his waist instead. When Draco opened his eyes, he could barely make out the man standing in the rain in front of him. How could it be foggy during a down pour of this magnitude he wondered, until he felt Harry shake with laughter.
“So you keep saying,” he eventually replied still avoiding Harry’s gaze.
“Not bloody likely! I am here to see the head optician, not to get poked and prodded at by the hired help,” said Draco disdainfully, still refusing to get up.
Harry had the grace to blush at the question before answering. “I watched you.”
“Oi, Harry!” Ron shouted over the din, clapping Harry on the back, startling him enough that he almost fell off the chair and only Ron’s quick reflexes saved him from falling on his arse. “Easy there. I thought you’d got lost on the way back. I see the big bad wolf got you instead.”
Draco felt the last spark of hope dying inside and finally the tears came. His friends found him soon after, huddled on the sofa, the tear-stained newspaper clutched to his chest. They tried talking to him but he only shook his head. Pansy sat down next to him, trying to pull him into a comforting hug. Draco sat on the sofa rigidly, unable to accept his friend’s comfort. The time for consolation would come later.
“I have no idea what you are talking about.”
Somehow he must have fallen asleep despite his paralysing fear, because the next thing he noticed were fingers tracing the line of his jaw, running across his eyebrows and coming to rest on his lips.
And so it had continued. Draco had shut himself away from the world more and more with every passing month, only going out to restock his potions supplies and even then only if he was running so low improvising wasn’t an option anymore.
“And do what? Give you the time of day when you wouldn’t give it to me? Listen to an explanation that’s five years too late, just so you can feel better about yourself? I don’t think so. Go wallow in your guilt like a good little Gryffindor. Go back to your little wife and play happy family. I don’t want you here.”
His eyes slowly drifted shut as the exhaustion of the day’s ordeal caught up with him. He’d rest for just a short while and then go back to the patio. He had to sneak back into the house before anyone noticed. Draco couldn’t remember why that was important as sleep eventually claimed him.
“Why not?” He heard himself ask, already knowing the answer.
“He does.”
They lay there for a long time, Harry breathing into Draco’s neck, clinging to his thin frame and Draco alternately holding him, gently rubbing slow circles into Harry’s back and whispering nonsense into the mop of hair that smelled of earth and roses.
Harry stepped up close to Malfoy, despite everything he was worried now. He raised his wand in front of Malfoy’s face and held it up high to get a better look. Malfoy’s irises were huge as saucers in his pale face and they weren’t reacting to the bright light. This wasn’t good, this wasn’t good at all. Something was definitely wrong here.
“What if you’re in my way?” he asked, noting that Potter’s eyes were flicking back and forth between Draco’s eyes and lips. He looked unsure and a bit out of his element, as if he knew what was going to happen and craved it desperately but at the same time was terrified of it. Draco could feel Potter’s heartbeat picking up where his fingers touched Potter’s neck. He traced Potter’s bottom lip with his thumb and Potter took in a shuddering breath.
“What happened?” Malfoy’s voice sounded small as he spoke, wrapping his hands around the cup without taking a sip.
“As much as it pains me, I think you should put that knitted thing back on and go back home. I’ll come by with one of my assistants after my shift and then we’ll look around your home and see if anything there might have triggered it. You might be a Black, but that house has some issues and I’m pretty sure there are still some dark artefacts left hidden somewhere. Did you do anything like clean out the attic or rearrange some furniture lately?”
As Harry released his hand, Draco could still feel the warmth of his touch as if he had been burned. Harry smiled and waved at him shyly, his back still turned to his friends, consequently hiding the motion, before stepping back into the rain and crossing the street to join the others. They cast a last look in his direction before they began walking away. Draco watched them until they were gone.
Harry ran out of the room, laughing loudly as Malfoy chased after him, throwing Harry’s slippers after him, as he ran. It seemed that no floor was sticky enough to warrant foregoing just revenge.
“Ok.”
He cast a spell that Hermione had taught him during their excessive study sessions for their make-up exams for their final year at Hogwarts. The spell enabled the caster to see which pages had already been read. The pages would pulse gently in a pale glow if they had been read before. Harry had modified it slightly and would now be able to see the pages Draco had opened.
At the last one, Draco feels himself cringe as the pain that had come from being cursed burns through him once more. He fearfully reaches for his chest, almost expecting to find his wounds reopened, but there is nothing there. He remembers the devastation and fear, remembers what it was like to live in a house so tainted by the Dark Lord’s presence that even years later, Draco sometimes still has trouble calling it home and meaning it. That last sensation was so strong that it blocks out many of the shapes that pass through him, what they invoke seems like a mere echo compared to the intensity of the one that came before them.
“Not really.”
Harry rushed to the foot of the stairs and looked up the sight of Malfoy in his bathrobe stealing his breath away. Malfoy had to repeat what he had said, because the first time round Harry’s brain had been busy appreciating the apparition in front of him rather than listening to the content of its complaints.
Soon after, he remembered, his dreams had turned to nightmares and he had to start taking dreamless sleep potion every night before going to sleep.
Being held and taken care of by this confident version of Draco was exactly what he needed. Harry leaned in, his lips only inches from Draco’s silently asking permission and when he didn’t pull away, Harry closed the distance between them. The kiss progressed languidly and gently. Harry traced the lines of Draco’s lips with his tongue and when he opened his mouth and their tongues touched carefully, it was as if the spark still alight in his heart grew and grew until he felt like his entire being was on fire.
“Do I mean that little to you, that you won’t even talk to me? Does what we have mean nothing to you?”
Malfoy’s hand was touching his. His skin felt electric where they were connected and desire so intense rushed through him that he quickly tore his hand away, wiping it on his trousers to stop the mortifying feeling. The entire exercise proved pointless. After months of peace of mind the want was back, burning hotter than ever before. The people surrounding them all but forgotten, it took all of his not inconsiderable self control to not lean in and close the gap between them and letting his fingers run all over Malfoy’s beautiful body.
“Let’s just go. It’s getting late anyway and I promised Charlene I’d be home for dinner.”
The healer had finally caught up with him and cast a silenced bubble around them to keep the disturbance he was creating to a minimum.
Ginny was sitting at the kitchen table, a mug clasped in hand, pretending to read. The grip on the mug was so strained that her white knuckles almost seemed to glow in contrast to the sturdy dark ceramic in her hand. She appeared to have waited for him for quite a while. The lack of steam rising from the supposedly hot liquid in her mug told him as much.
“So you of course just assumed they must have been talking about you.” Draco drawled, old habits dying hard.
Draco smiled.
They say their goodbyes and while they’ve shared something very personal they are not friends, not even on the way to becoming acquaintances, but somehow that’s ok too. Before she leaves, Millicent tells him that if he ever needs to over share his feelings with someone who won’t judge him, he knows where to find her.
Harry pulled Malfoy close to him to make sure he didn’t fall. Malfoy was as cold as a corpse, his face covered in rain and the strands of his hair wet from the rain. How long had he been out here? Harry removed his parka and draped it over Malfoy’s shoulders like a cloak.
Draco lowers his gaze and shakes his head. Harry understands that it’s won’t rather than can’t.
It was meant as a joke, Potter seemed to be able to tell and yet his face shuttered, the easiness from earlier gone. Then Draco remembered, Potter had been everybody’s darling for quite a while there. That is until it became public knowledge that Voldemort’s power had somehow contaminated Potter’s magic  and he suddenly was considered a danger to society not fit to serve as an Auror anymore. Potter had disappeared from the public eye after that. Until Draco had found him in his little shop, he had not even known Potter was still in England. Draco for some reason had always assumed someone as overly dramatic as Potter would have become a hermit somewhere like Iceland or something.
“Do you trust me?” Draco asked and offered Harry his hand, which he was just able to make out as his eyes got used to the dim light spread by the algae.
Draco’s head was suddenly filled with images of himself rushing down those stairs, crowding Harry into the banister and burying his hands in that ridiculous hair. In his mind’s eye he would push those glasses Harry still wore on top of his head while Draco kissed him breathless. He wanted that more than anything, even Pyxis’ thrall on him paled in comparison.
Potter came ever closer and Draco was both afraid and excited of what might happen if he let Potter touch him again.
Hermione describes how everyone had watched but nobody had done anything and how some people even smiled as if they enjoyed what happened.
Draco chuckled as he remembered apparating them to his flat, holding Harry tightly against him. Not knowing where Harry lived, he didn’t have a choice but to take Harry home with him, because the other man had steadfastly refused to give him his address.
Number Twelve Grimmauld Place was dark, cold and empty when he unlocked the door. Ginny it appeared hadn’t been back, not that he had expected her to. The old house had never felt less like home than it did now. He’d always thought his home after the war would be bright and beautiful, filled with his friends and their laughter.
“What?”
Harry crawled over to Draco again, lying down beside him. Draco was still lying on his back, breathing shakily. He turned his face to Harry’s and Harry drew him close into another tender kiss.
He didn’t even notice someone speaking to him until the person repeated what they’d said, sounding more urgent this time.
“So, basically, my theory is that whoever they were, they terra-formed our planet, which caused at least one of the mass extinctions. Their planet is a lot like earth. Our planet is a bit colder and we’ve got more landmass, but otherwise they are suspiciously alike.”
“What’s his name?”
Why couldn’t Malfoy be at least a tiny bit more amendable, Harry wondered. Last night had hinted at something beneath the snark, but it seemed that only booze and drugs brought that side out and wasn’t that a whole can of worms Harry wasn’t even close to addressing yet. How did one tell their unwanted houseguest something like that if he was already contrary about such random and unimportant things as general hygiene in your own home? Harry worried that if he didn’t tell Malfoy about last night and what had almost happened to him, Malfoy wouldn’t take the necessary precautions. And what if not being aware of the risks endangered him even more? What if Harry wasn’t there to protect him, thinking about what might have happened was unbearable.
“I guess...” Harry doesn’t know where to go from here. Should he explain what he is sorry for? Would it even make a difference?
“Now, since the curse has essentially been grafted into your skin and aura over time, I need direct access to the affected area.” Harry tries to sound as clinical as possible not wanting to sound like he just wants to get Draco out of his clothes. That hadn’t worked last time and wasn’t likely to have the results they both want and need.
He smiles, there is no mirth in it this time, only tenderness.
“This is your scroll Potter, take it and get out.” He could see the hurt stamped all over Potter’s face and part of him wondered why Potter had thought it a good idea to kiss him. How dare he ambush Draco at his work and behave like he still wanted him. He had no right! Draco forcefully stopped himself from following that line of thought.
, his treacherous thoughts added. The boy he remembered from his school days should not have been entrusted with carrying a raw egg across a room, let alone mess around with the insides of something as fragile as a watch. That very same boy would not have so freely shaken his hand in greeting either. Potter apparently had changed and not only in temperament if Draco was honest with himself, he had grown up rather fine as well.
“Never said I wasn’t!”
“You need to stop reading those old magazines that Dudley’s kid keeps forgetting to take home, Draco, they mess with your head. We’ll find a solution.”
Draco shuddered, suddenly feeling cold. Was Harry behind why he felt so tired lately? Had he been doing something to Draco in his sleep? Draco’s wand was in his hand and trained at Harry within the blink of an eye.
