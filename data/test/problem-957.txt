that she wanted him to leave but couldn't make him." Draco felt the fire of helplessness that had burned all last year. "He took things of hers, you know, pictures, keepsakes, little trinkets. They weren't valuable, most of them, it was just that she loved them and it hurt her when he stole them." He blinked back a tear, feeling stupid about crying about things like Grandmother's last picture being ripped to little pieces when so many other things had been lost. "He enjoyed destroying them. He liked to watch her face when he did it."
Harry was almost ready to feel sane about the whole cocksucking thing. He'd liked it, at least enough. Okay, he could deal with that. He'd gotten hard and he'd wanted to get off afterwards. He just wasn't sure what it meant. He'd wanted to get off after fooling around with Ginny before too.  Had that been feelings or had it just been friction?
"Nah, I'm good." Dean gave Harry a little squeeze and stood. "Got Charms first thing tomorrow." He caught the towel Seamus tossed him and wrapped it around his waist.
"Draco." Harry nuzzled at his temple. "I'll owl the Aurors this afternoon. I know just who to ask to pull strings." He reached out and cupped Draco's chin, gently turning Draco's face back towards Harry's waiting mouth. Draco closed his eyes, wanting to shut out everything but the kiss.
It hurt. It panicked him and it might have been ten thousand times worse because it was Malfoy, which wasn't a thought he could bear to examine right now. That body being currently battered by a wave, knocked over again and again each time he tried to stand—that body had been pressed against his own and he had always thought that maybe, maybe some time it would happen again in better circumstance, which was a stupid, stupid thought given who they both were and holy shite, what was he going to do?
"Sounds like a job for a prefect," Potter called back. There might have been an edge in his voice. A tiny dig, from someone who was now seeing the bright side of not getting picked for the position of power.
Draco's hips stuttered on that thought—Potter wanted cock stuffed down his throat, Potter was desperate to gag himself while he frantically rubbed one out. Potter was stilling and stiffening and his back arched and his grunts were turning ever deeper. His eyes were locked on Draco's in a way that might have been sultry if they weren't so full of need.
Harry sputtered around a swallow of too-hot tea.
"Professor McGonagall," Blaise said smoothly as she arrived with Filch in tow, as if he didn't want to run away like the rest of them. Potter included, probably.
“First he talked a good lot about hanging students by the thumbs—“ George put in, leaning over Fred.
“Answer me, God damn it!” Harry was standing over Draco now, his magic blazing. “You told me you loved me and that you’ll never use the key to change yourself straight, you fucking
Anyway, the arsehole had to be between the arse-cheeks, right? Harry put a hand behind the bollocks, feeling the smooth skin there. McLaggen gave an encouraging moan. Harry turned his hand and ran his finger back further, pushing between the cheeks until—yeah—he felt something. A little pucker, something like that. McLaggen rocked his hips and Harry felt it again and then again and then he went for it, pushing his finger in.
Draco stood up with easy grace. He put his hand on Marcus's chest—fingers spread, almost a caress—and pushed him gently back into his seat. Draco waited a moment, just long enough for everyone to be reminded that he was worth looking at, then he sat again too. "Seven," he said clearly. "One per day, every day, each and every week, for every one of you."
He reaches the Place and noses among the rubbish disgorged by the cabinet. Empty bottles that he knows from experience will sting his nose with their fumes, empty chocolate wrappers, and, when he’s lucky, plates full of food that seem to have been only picked at before being discarded here. These meals he eats gratefully (though they make his shrunken stomach wake up enough to cry terribly with hunger afterwards), but it is not for the food that he comes; it is for the other thing. The dog noses around the edges of the pile until he finds it. A jumper full of holes, covered in his own black hair. He noses at the collar and his body bursts open in feeling.
The words were right there, on the tip of his tongue and in the pit of his stomach, where they’d been lodged ever since that terrible day at the Manor.
With a loud woof, the dog came to a stop in front of a particularly impressive pile of filth. The cabinet that had vomited it forth was a dark oak wood, older-looking than most of the other cabinets, but with a more vibrant burnish to it somehow. It was clearly still in use—a faintly sweet air, as of over-ripe fruit, arose from the mounds of fresh garbage in front of it. There was plenty to scrounge from here, Draco realized as the dog nipped in and seized an old sausage. Whoever was on the other side of the cabinet didn’t seem to have much of an appetite—all around them were the remnants of night after night’s worth of barely touched meals.
The barrier wasn’t visible, but this time Harry was sure he could feel it shivering. Shaking. There was a spot right where they were focusing that was getting weaker. He kept the magic going, feeling as if he could do this all day—
Harry cleared his throat.
Harry summoned the rug with a quick wand twitch and dropped off the bed onto his knees, hiding his snort. He might not like McLaggen but he was getting fonder by the minute of Oliver et al. They'd been passing McLaggen around for years by the sound of it and thanks to them, Harry didn't even need to hide that he was getting off on this. It was just something
"Oh, no fucking way, mate," the Weasel said stepping up right next to Blaise. "Harry is
Comments and feedback keep the chapters coming and are always appreciated!
Harry felt the blood rushing in his ears. He hadn't been this angry since he'd been sharing his head with a snake-faced bastard. What had they been doing to Malfoy? "Who's got the contract? Is it Zabini?"
Harry stepped back from Draco, feeling almost ashamed to be thinking of life and love and the future in front of a girl who had been burned alive without ever having any of those things. “So, the Librarian knows where the key is?” he asked, determined to refocus this expedition so they could end it as quickly as possible.
The sun was streaming into the cozy bedroom, and the air still smelled of sex. Draco rubbed his head back and forth on Potter's pillow--no, on Harry’s pillow--waves of disbelief rolling inside him. Harry Potter wanted him! Had been wanking over Draco since fourth year! Wanted Draco in his bed!
“Do they? Like we did? Is that really what you think?” Blaise looked away, and Draco thought he saw a blush on his friend’s cheeks, his brown skin coloring burnt sienna.
"I think that's for Draco to say, if he wishes to." Zabini's face was cool and closed, giving nothing away. "So kind of you to worry about a friend of mine though, and a Slytherin, no less. There's a first time for everything, I suppose."
“What the fuck, Potter? You can’t just Side-Along Apparate me to fuck knows where” --Draco broke off to glance about-- “Some sodding Muggle street in the middle of London? What do you think I am, a bloody house elf that you can just shove about wherever you like?”
Or maybe it just meant some Ministry arsehole had drop-kicked their unwanted pet through the stone arch in the Death Chamber. That would be about right for the compassion level of the average Ministry sod, as far as Draco's experience went. Draco sighed, his breath gusting hard enough across the dog's back to make his fur flutter. "What am I going to do with you?" he asked the dog, starting to feel helpless and stupid all over again. Here he was, lost in the mist, and what had he done but get a poor animal's hopes up? The dog probably thought it had found a savior but the joke was on it—all it had found was an ex-Malfoy, who'd never been able to save himself let alone anyone else. "Do you have a home you're missing too, dog?"
"Course not." Seamus stroked his cock right in front of Harry's face. It was filling rapidly, getting thicker and harder by the second.  He grunted as it swelled. "I'm the youngest of all the cousins. I was always the one on my knees."
"He took away Draco's desire for women." Zabini whispered to the wall and the equation bloomed into an ugly twist of thorns. "See? That's the arithmantic equation for how to change your child's sexual preference. No reputable modern Healer would do it, but there's plenty of old-school Dark Arts practioners from Eastern Europe and Russia who know it well."
"He doesn't know what to do," Seamus told Dean, talking right over Harry's shoulder.
Neville's eyes swiveled slowly from Malfoy back to Harry. "Er?"
"Shut it, Theo. If he's stupid enough to offer it, don't stop him." Marcus's eyes raked up and down Draco's body. "Maybe he's that desperate for cock. Maybe he doesn’t even want anything in return. Our spunk is favor enough for you, huh?"
Harry stared at the folded parchment. “Thanks,” he said, trying to keep the amazement out of his voice. He strode through the gate without looking down at the letter. Better to look like he knew what had just happened. He hopped into the next lift heading down, pushing the button for the ninth level, then as close to the doors as he could, away from the scrutiny of a group of wizards gossiping in the back corner.
With the Veil fallen back in front of it, Harry could see that there was now a tiny hole in its gray shimmer, right at the spot where they’d focused their wands. When Draco pulled the curtain back once more, however, the spot became as invisible as the rest of the barrier. Harry reached out and carefully put his finger on the spot in the air where the hole had been. He could feel its edges, smooth as polished glass, yet even as he pressed against it, he felt it give way around him, rippling a bit the way water does when you dip your finger in. Draco couldn’t get out, but he, Harry could get in. He could step right into it, and through it, just one step and he’d be beside Draco again—
Draco knelt down and picked up the cup, turning it over in his hand. A few final drops slid out to the rim, collected and fell at his feet.
Harry’s feeling of horror was momentarily displaced by a familiar surge of resentment at pure-blood snobbery. But then Draco caught at his arm, holding him back a moment and leaning in to whisper, “I know, I’m sorry, but don’t make a fuss, okay? Cassie was caught by Muggles and burned to death. There’s no talking to her on the subject.”
"All right. Sorry. Didn't mean to hit a nerve." Potter shifted, fingers tracing a nervous pattern on the sheets. "My turn for a question. I was going to ask you about something else. But talking about all this—well, it makes me feel like I need to ask something else first."
Padfoot throws back his head and howls.
. Draco felt the heat and power of Harry’s magic against his skin, working into him as surely and as gently as Harry’s finger stroked the dimple of his hole. Teasing, asking. Harry was still sucking him, taking Draco a little deeper now, his tongue working the underside of Draco’s cockhead. His finger asking, waiting. Yes, said Draco’s body, his hips rocking down against Harry’s finger. Yes, said his mouth, a long moan of pleasure. Harry answered with a hum that vibrated deep in Draco’s cock. His orgasm was beginning to gather in his balls, taut against the base of Harry’s palm.
“But?” Harry asked, because there was always a ‘but’ when it came to being an adult.
Both twins straightened up and, as if they’d rehearsed it, saluted Harry in tandem and left. Harry shut the door and sank down on the bed beside Ron.
Dawlish snapped his fingers. “I think we’ve seen enough here.”
He tried to breathe normally and get his bearings. The five beds with their emerald drapes looked the same as they always had, lit by the cool light from the silvery lanterns overhead. The floor was dry now, and other than the Vanishing cabinet, which was still pushed up against the wall, there was no sign there had ever been a flood. It was as if he'd never left. As if he'd never spent two weeks high in Gryffindor tower, in Harry's bed, in Harry's heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
he said, and the wasp tornado cleared, leaving a stunned-looking Nott on the floor cradling his bleeding nose. Then he turned back to Harry.
Blaise was opening his mouth to say something utterly amusing (in his own eyes) when the click, click, click of heels echoed down the dungeon hall. Draco stiffened.  Every Slytherin knew that sound—they could navigate around it in the dark, like bats avoiding a hungry eagle-owl.
“With my boyfriend,” Harry said, his cheeks heating. “If he’ll stop being narked off at me long enough to let me get him alone in a room with a proper bed, that is.”
“Now that you’ve pinched it, you can’t simply
Normally, a magic fountain that wanted to be drunk was something to flee at great speed, he knew. But this one seemed different. There was an energy emanating from it, a magic both equal and opposite to Voldemort’s evil stone basin that had protected the Horcrux locket. Drinking the water in that basin had been painful, horrible, death-filled. This one offered life and health and love. And yet—
A hundred flowery phrases tried to form in Harry’s mouth all at once. His tongue twisted. “Er,” Harry said. “Yeah. I did.”
“This arsehole thinks I’ve done something with our sucker,” Nott said. “I fucking haven’t. Haven’t seen him since he skived off the sucks he owed me and Flint.” He glared at Harry.
He forced himself to stand upright, sucking in another gaspful of cold night air. "I'm going back to Hogwarts," he said, half telling them and half telling himself, as his brain struggled to make a decision. "If you've no objection."
Zabini shook his head with finality, anger fading into something sadder. "No. Now you talk to Draco. I've told you more than enough, maybe more than I should have. Anything else is for him to say."
"I'm trying to get you naked. In my bed. After kissing you. What do you think I want?" Potter paused in his unbuttoning, leaving an enticing sliver of chest on view. "Wait, am I being rude? Do you want to be seduced? Here—" He waved his hand again. A box of chocolates shot through the slit in the bed-curtains, sideways on, like a small beribboned missile.
Draco shivered, his hips thrusting toward Harry’s mouth. His heart ached with love and guilt and his cock ached with the need to feel Harry’s full lips around it.
Potter. Of course. A strange thrill filled Draco's belly, a mixed feeling of nerves and desire.
"Oi! You were going to have some fun too, Mr. F. Weasley, Esquire. Fill in for me, when and where you wanted." George's breath ghosted past Harry's ear, making him shiver. "Many hands make light work after all."
Blaise rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers. A scroll appeared in the air beside him, dropped into his hand, and unrolled with a snap. "Needless to say, our usual trove of Slytherin documents is currently unavailable. Fortunately, our Founder made certain that all records are also accessible magically. I searched the archives and voila-here it is. The official Slytherin Cocksucking Contract." He let his lip curl up as his eyes slid to Marcus. "Is that straight-forward enough for you?"
Harry was rubbing himself off on the sheets, he realized. Some of that whine was his and fuck, he was going to come with Ron's cock stuffed in his mouth. He couldn't do that, it was too weird and he grasped for something to bring himself off the boil. Hermione, he thought, before his rhythm could falter and Ron could look down and ask what the matter was.  Hermione has done this.
Dawlish might ask of him, no matter the consequences? How far should his loyalty to his family extend? He’d already lost Harry. What else was he prepared to lose?
Awful things happen in the dark, one part of his brain reminded him. Exciting things happen in the dark too, the other side said. That tingly sensation was already settling around his balls, cool and pleasant now, but ready to tighten if he didn't do his duty. There was just enough light to see the contract on the floor.
"Merlin, Malfoy. Of course I'll stop if you're uncomfortable. That's basic etiquette." Potter shook his head. "I'm starting to think that growing up in your House wasn’t exactly peaches and cream." He settled back, knees bent, stockinged feet flat on the bed. "Okay, ask away."
“Shut the fuck up and put my cock in your mouth, then. And mind the teeth.” He had to be snarky and prickly right now. If he wasn’t he’d do something stupid like fall to his knees and tell Harry how much he was in love with him and beg him not to leave.
McLaggen slid forward, making the angle easy, and Harry went right to it. He sucked the bell-end in and then kept going, pushing it down the length of his tongue 'til he was a hairs-breadth away from gagging. Harry kept it there a moment and felt his own cock go agonizingly hard. McLaggen smelled fucking amazing, utterly male.
He has no body to tremble or even piss—
Potter nodded. "Lucius must have known that too. It was deatheaters who Voldemort sent to kill Regulus so that part wasn't a secret in those circles." A ghost of a look crossed Potter's face. "Lucius really didn't tell you much, did he?"
“Shut it, Theo,” Zabini said. “Come on, Potter, we can talk in mine.” He led the way down the hall to his room, his bath cauldron bobbing at his heels.
Malfoy was rubbing his head—that had looked like a nasty knock—but he was searching frantically for his wand. Get the fucking door open before the water pressure is too high, Harry wanted to scream, but his telepathy was sorely lacking. Harry grabbed his wand and pointed it at the window and yelled
said McGonagall, in that tone that brooked no interruption. “It is eight-thirty in the evening. There are any number of places in Hogwarts that Mr. Malfoy might presently be. I shall ask Mr. Filch and the Hogwarts ghosts to keep an eye out for him, but I have every confidence that he will appear at breakfast in the morning, unharmed and completely dry. In the meantime, may I suggest that you, Mr. Zabini, return to your dormitory and take the shower that you appear to be dressed for, and mind that you take your bath cauldron with you; it appears to have followed you here. You, Harry, will go directly to Madam Pomfrey. I would like her to have a look at you, and perhaps prescribe something to ease your mind. Now if you will both excuse me, I have work to do.”
"Me too," Greg said. "I mean, I vote for me for sucker. Not Theo."
“Merlin, my fingers!”
Oh, fuck it. Harry was going to come. He knew it. Each stroke was getting more and more intense--
“Escaped the Snatchers. Lived through the Battle of Hogwarts. Got an O in Potions. Clearly I’m a lucky guy. I’ll risk it.”
He gripped Harry’s bare arse cheeks, loving the smooth skin under his hands, pressing Harry’s groin to his own, his hips rising up to match the roll of Harry’s hips, his cock thickening beneath him as he kissed and kissed Harry, pulling him down against his body, as if Harry’s weight against him could keep him from the rest of his life.
Draco buried his nose in Harry’s hair and tried to memorize the smell of it, the coarseness of it, the way it felt against his mouth. “I’ve always loved you, Harry,” he whispered, and his voice did not shake. “I love you so much.” He wrapped his arms around Harry and held him hard because it had taken Draco nearly half a lifetime to be able to say it, but by God it was true, and to say it now at the end was better than never at all. And he wasn’t going to cry, not now.
Draco scowled at him so viciously that Harry stepped back, his hands balling into fists, ready to swing in self-defense. Not that Draco was much for physical fighting, Harry thought, a memory surfacing of a thirteen-year-old Draco sent running by one good punch from Hermione. Besides, Draco was still holding the jar with the rat-key in it, and his other hand was planted on his hip, his bony elbow a perfect match for his pointy chin, stuck out like an advance guard for his scowl, which somehow extended to take in the whole street, as if each car and shop and pedestrian were a personal affront. Harry waited, and saw the moment when Draco’s shoulders dropped and he simply hunched into his robes, shivering in the evening wind.
Harry cast again. The knob let out a metal screech and turned, still protesting as the door swung open. Outside the sky was cloudy and weeds were sprouting in the small park across the street. Harry sucked in a deep breath, appreciating the London air, letting the car exhaust and the curry shop scents chase out the stink of old, dead magic.
“You are absolutely the most stubborn—no, wait.” Draco frowned, but it was a frown of concentration now, not annoyance. “Expelliarmus can be used to disarm someone in a duel because it sends their wand flying,” he said slowly. “And it does that because its essential nature is to push magic aside.”
And then they’d both be trapped behind the Veil. With difficulty, Harry kept his feet where they were, taking a breath to steady himself. “Here,” he said, wiggling his finger against the little hole. “Draco, put your finger here.”  Draco raised his hand, and their fingertips met, flesh touching warm flesh through the tiny hole they had made.
His chest felt a little tight, like the humiliation building in his belly was swelling and swelling, pushing upward into his lungs and making it hard to take a breath. McLaggen—he'd been out next. He liked getting sucked obviously, but Harry couldn't honestly say that he could see McLaggen willingly do anything to please a partner, other than offer up his own nicely toned flesh for appreciation. Then it had been Ron—
"In the arithmancy lab." She pointed a finger at a door at the back of the classroom.
“Ooh, what’s wrong, Potter?” Nott put in. “Not getting enough cock as the Gryffindor sucker?” He turned to Zabini and batted his eyelashes. “Rumor has it Potter’s discovered that Slytherin snakes are superi--”
But no. Malfoy was standing near the window, his profile still as bas relief. Harry might have worried Malfoy would see him if he turned his head, but all of the git's attention was focused on the cabinet that hulked against the wall.
“What’s that?” Draco asked, letting the tattered curtain fall back for a moment as he bent to pick up the cup. When he lifted the curtain aside again, Harry saw that the cup was now empty, the last of its water soaking into the ground at Draco’s feet. Harry felt his heart sink into his stomach. Why wasn’t the cup refilling?
“Not leaving then, I take it?” Malfoy sneered, his expression as cold as his voice. “Fine.
“Goodness gracious. It’s Draco Malfoy isn’t it? Whatever is the matter?”
No, of course that wasn’t it. Dawlish would have just taken Draco there if that was what he wanted. He wouldn’t need to threaten Draco into it. “I can’t go there by myself,” Draco said slowly, feeling his way into what he suspected Dawlish wanted, which was to obtain the key without drawing attention to himself in any way. “You know that. I’m not permitted in the Manor without supervision.”
“Harry.” Draco pushed himself up to half-sitting. “Forget the key. I won’t ever change back. No matter what.”
, get dressed and we’ll go down to breakfast.”
A shiver ran down his spine, hidden by his robe. Did he want to? Could he bear to?
Harry rubbed his eyes and sat up, drawing the sheet around his waist. He hadn’t bribed any house elves. But Ron didn’t seem to notice his confusion.
Draco nodded yes, not entirely sure what he was agreeing to but figuring if it involved Potter and further nakedness, it was absolutely fine with him. His head bob had barely ended before Potter's fingers were on his belt, unbuckling it then sliding his trousers off.
Harry lay on top of him, pressing Draco down into the soft linens. Draco went limp beneath him, loving the feeling of being held down by the weight of Harry’s bare chest against his own. Harry was whispering something in his ear. Words, a question. Draco breathed and blinked, trying to make sense of the sounds. He felt limp, overwhelmed. “What?” he asked, his own voice strange in his ears.
"Guess you'll have to," Potter said cheerfully, dragging him along at the back of the pack.
"I was looking for Zabini. Is he still here?"
Draco felt for a split second as if he’d been hit with a stunning spell. Then he leapt up, scrambling for his wand, but where was it? It was lost somewhere in the bedclothes and in a second it would be too late.
Harry opened the door anyway. It was small inside and mostly bed like Hermione had said, but a window filled the far wall, letting the rising moon shine in on white sheets. It smelled like clean citrus and the bed was wide and inviting, with blankets piled at the foot. He went with the smile. "It
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe, just maybe, this was the kind of revelation that would have been better experienced with someone who he knew liked cock? Harry shook that idea off as fast as it had come—it made him shiver to think of being that exposed. Someone else who liked cock might want to talk about it. They might want Harry to make admissions to other people, even. Then those people would talk to other people and before you knew it, Rita Skeeter would be calling for an interview--
Malfoy sneered. "Dinner just started. By the time they come back, find out something's wrong, get help, and get us out, we'll be blue, wrinkly, and very, very dead. Try again."
Draco drew a breath. He could do this. Potter was honorable in that unfathomable Gryffindor way. He wouldn't use what he learned against Draco. "I am Salazar Slytherin," he said, starting things off traditionally.
The door opened and there was a shuffling of feet. Draco didn't open his eyes but it had to be Longbottom standing there. Who else smelled like mimbulus mimbletonia?
and a firm
Mid-bound, the dog’s eyes catch up with his nose, registering Remus sitting slumped with his head on the table—
“Oh, that’s the problem, is it?” George wrapped an arm around Fred. “Don’t worry. Part of the contract. Only the dorm’s lads know. Can’t talk about it to anyone unless they’re male, of age, and in our dorm.”
The human word bursts against Padfoot’s consciousness with as much force as the spell hits the broken hinge. The stick is a wand! The boy is a wizard! And ... there is another wizard here too? Padfoot is a wizard? No, Padfoot is a dog, a good dog, he wants to be a good dog so he can be petted and loved and told he’s a pretty boy some more, he wants to be belly-rubbed by this Harry-smelling, Hogwarts-smelling wizard boy with a wand. Padfoot rolls over onto his back, exposing his belly and whining hopefully.
"Anyway, Potter," Draco said, going on, "no, I wasn't brought up to revere him." He wasn't going to mention the Harry-Potter-Is-Our-Hero children's book his mother had read to him when he was little. He might have to tell the truth but he didn't have to utterly embarrass himself. "Father was busy distancing himself from all of that after the first wizarding war. He supported pureblood culture, of course, but he never said he supported the Dark Lord."
He moved down a bit, just enough to rest his head on Malfoy's thigh, and enjoy the hand still carding through his hair.
McLaggen plumped down on the edge of the bed, giving himself a lazy tug as he sat. "Nice, huh?"
“Yeah.”
He thought of his mother, under house arrest at Aunt Andromeda's. How soon before she learned that her son was no longer part of the family? Draco knew, in some distant part of his brain, that he should go tell her himself, prepare her. But the misery of the idea eddied through him as heavily as a stone sinking in a lake, and he knew he wouldn't. He couldn't bear her face, her tears, and especially not the terrible weight of her loving disappointment at how he'd failed again. And again. And yet again.
The twins looked at each other, then at Harry, bafflement on both their faces.
His clothes flew on so fast it chafed—he'd have the trouser equivalent of rug-burn in the morning—and his buttons did themselves up with blinding speed. Malfoy had dived under the covers and Harry threw the charm his way too, sending an extra pair of trousers and a clean shirt slithering over to him.
“I brought back Sirius Black?” Draco asked, his cheeks now flushing pink.
"See? I said I'd show you." Potter pulled Draco's arm a little higher, forcing him into an undignified squeak.
Diagonally across the intersection, a small sign hung from a bracket affixed to the side of a large white townhouse that occupied the entire corner. On the sign, elegant gold letters proclaimed
“God forbid you invite people over to dance in your perfect 17th century ballroom,” Harry said dryly. “Or, you know, redecorate.”
"Oh, it'll still work," George said abstractly, as Fred levitated the now door-less cabinet over the lake, guiding it toward deeper water. He handed Harry a small metal token. "Take this. It'll show you the way to the treat we've got for you.
There. In the Hogwarts kitchen wing, of all places, in a small room Harry had never noticed that stood just inside the door to the kitchen gardens. And Draco wasn’t alone. As Harry watched, the name
“He’s dead,” Harry said, his voice just as wobbly as Remus’s. “Truly gone. Finished. I’m going to be an Auror when I graduate next spring, and... oh, Sirius, we all thought—” He broke off, not wanting to cry again, but it was too late; he was already crying. And it didn’t matter, because Sirius’s arms were around him once more.
, Draco translated in his head. Any number of things had been taken during the never-ending post-war searches of his home. Not that he was in any position to complain. “Sir?”
But still. Harry had fucking
“I can’t remember.” Sirius tipped his head, brow furrowing just like Padfoot. “It’s lost in my dog-brain. I can transform—”
on the telly over Dudley’s shoulder one night and being too scared to fall asleep in his cupboard afterwards. What did it say about him that he’d grown up to be something haunted houses feared?
Harry rolled his hips, the denim of his jeans rough against Draco’s bare skin. “I liked you telling me what to do,” he said, with a grin whose heat came from deep in his eyes. “How about you tell me how I should get off now?”
“You wanted to be the sucker anyway,” Harry said to George. “Tell everyone you’re taking my place, and if they want a suck, they have to come to you now. If they ask why, you can explain it’s your penance for nearly drowning me in the Slytherin dungeons, which it is.” Fred opened his mouth to speak, but Harry swung his wand back at Fred’s bits and Fred simply licked his lips and fell silent. “You owe me that,” Harry said. “Both of you. Now get the fuck out of my room.”
"Thank you, Widley. I'll... I'll be right down."
“The last time I saw the key was at the Manor,” Draco said. “But please, Harry, no more questions about that.”
Potter looked him up and down. Then he grabbed Draco and pulled him up to the top of the bed, settling them hip to hip, leaning back against the pillow. With a wave of his hand, the bed-curtains whooshed closed.
Harry did, of course, lifting his head to the October wind as if the cold gusts lifting bits of litter from the gutter might also clear away the remains of the bad feelings that clung to him. He was crap at knowing how to read other people’s emotions, much less deal with them--Ginny and Hermione always said so. But at least Draco wasn’t shouting at him anymore. Or hexing him. For the moment, he’d have to be content with that.
Sirius was frowning now. “There was something. No, someone. In the mist.”
Does he? The boy scowls at the cabinet, pushing his pale hair out of his eyes, and pulls out an ornately carved stick.
“Just don’t move.” It was all Draco could manage. Everything else was too big to say.
In our defense, the full moon in November, 1998 really does fall on the 4th, the day after Sirius's birthday. Clearly the heavens were aligned for angst, so what could we do?
? Outside his head, he shrugged and went with it. So far everything else McLaggen had said had been surprisingly brilliant. Harry went ahead and sucked his fingers in along with McLaggen's cock, getting them nice and wet.
The Lumière Hotel--or the Lumi, as Harry insisted on calling it, apparently because Granger had--was a good deal nicer than Draco had expected. The lobby was done in dark oak and cream velvet with small chandeliers overhead that cast imitation but pleasant candlelight from small glass bulbs. Draco gazed up at them, interested in spite of himself. Their crystal ornaments were plainer yet somehow prettier than the ones in the Manor, he thought, and then felt like a traitor. To make up for it, he focused instead on the way those holes in the wall where Muggles plugged in their lamps marred the otherwise smooth flow of the wallpaper. And then there was the bizarre and ridiculous form of Muggle money Harry was pulling out, a small, ugly plastic card he handed to the concierge, who then laid it on some sort of Muggle contraption that resembled nothing so much as a miniature clothes press. She ran a bar back and forth over it several times, and then handed it back to Harry again, which made no sense at all, along with a piece of paper on which the image of the card had somehow been inked by the clothes press thing.
"That's—well—that's—" Nev seemed to be turning it over in his head as he stood up.
“Okay. That’s it.” Harry spoke the obvious. The seal was holding. Water was already filling the cabinet, lapping up against the invisible barrier.
What would Father say? At that thought, depression crept back into him, so much more chilling than the cold of the lake. Funny—being near death had made him feel more alive than he had since Father had gone back to Azkaban. Now he felt pummeled again with the realization that he was alive and likely to stay that way for whatever grey span of time stretched out before he could swan off from this miserable existence—
“Up you get, now. Can’t pass the afternoon sprawled across my threshold, you’ll get trod upon; I’m expecting company at any moment. Besides, this floor’s still frightfully dank.”
. I never would have thought of that. Is that what you brought to the war, a keen sense of the absolutely obvious?" Malfoy banged his head against the wall a time or two but didn't let go of Harry. "The doors down here are charmed to seal shut if there's water pouring into a room. Flooding in a dungeon is serious business, Potter."
something’s happened to him,” said Harry desperately. “He might have gone to Azkaban to try to save his father all by himself, he doesn’t know that Remus sent the Aurors to get the werewolf out of his father’s cell. Or he might have--I don’t know, you know him better. What does Draco do when he’s upset? Like, really really upset?”
Shame followed fast on the heels of those thoughts. How could he possibly be considering the upsides of Father being in Azkaban? That was a cruel and unworthy thing to think. Draco moved on quickly to the meatball bushes, accidentally tearing the last pasta bundle in his hurry. He crouched down by the bushes, trying to focus on them and not the voice in his head that said how disgusted Father would be to see him out here toiling in the soil like a garden elf.
Harry didn’t wake. Draco kissed him once more, then put on his shoes and headed for the garden.
“You used me,” he said again. “You… you
Potter started squirming his way to the front of the crowd, pulling Draco with him. It wasn't hard to move up—the Slytherins as a whole were desperately unwilling to be first in line, it seemed. Pinches and jabs met him as they wiggled through, along with angry whispers. They were already blaming Draco for this, no matter what Potter said. Certainly no matter what the truth of the matter was. Truth was such a tiny thing compared to power—that's what life in Slytherin House taught you, if nothing else.
The tiny elf nodded and with another loud bang, disappeared.
Potter flushed a hard red from his face down to his chest. His cock jerked where it lay on top of the pillow and he had the look of someone whose pride was fighting with his wants. Then he bit his lip and dropped his eyes, not quite able to meet Draco's gaze, and let his hips start fucking his cock across the white cotton.
“For what?”
He was coming with Harry’s finger inside him. With Harry’s eyes on him while he wanked. Draco shut his eyes and turned his head away but it was too late; he pulsed over his hand, his hole spasming around Harry’s finger. “Fuck, yeah,” he heard Harry say, and then Harry’s other hand was on Draco’s face, cupping his cheek as Draco’s body tightened, shuddered, released.
“Draco?” Harry got as close to the curtain as he dared. He wanted badly to just dash through it and grab Draco and sort things out from there. Only a year ago, he would have done just that. He’d learned. He could be smart now, as well as brave. “Are you there? Can you hear me?”
,” because even he knew that much. Didn’t Potter ever read wizarding porn mags for fuck’s sake?
For one moment, Draco was paralyzed. If the key worked and Dawlish wiped his memory, how would he know whether Dawlish had followed through and freed Father? Or...Draco went cold. Maybe that was the whole point. With an undetectable obliviation spell, Dawlish could abuse prisoners and extort treasures from their families whenever he liked, wipe their memories after, and no one would be the wiser. Perhaps he could even make families forget they had a loved one in Azkaban at all.
Mclaggen beamed obliviously—of course—and swaggered in, hands already opening his flies. "Everyone gets lucky when I'm around. Just the way it works."
Draco nodded yes.
Draco almost gasped. “You mean, destroy your ancestors’ rooms? Erase the mark they left on the Manor, scrubbing their taste away like it was a stain?”
He pushed Potter's head a little deeper onto his cock, luxuriating in its feel. He pulled Potter's head back up, just a little bobbing motion, and rubbed himself with a little twisting motion across the tongue. His head fell back and he groaned then he forced himself to open his eyes and watch. He wanted every moment of this burned on his memory.
“No,” Harry said weakly. “I promise I’m not here to check—”
he handed it over, because so what if he was lying naked on a bed with the boy he’d been in love with since he’d first known what those feelings meant--his father’s soul was one Dementor’s Kiss away from being lost forever, his body one stumbled step away from being killed by the werewolf who shared his cell. The full moon was the day after tomorrow and Draco remembered perfectly well what he tried to tell Harry a week ago--that being a pureblood meant doing all sorts of things you didn’t want to do, because that was what you had to do to honor your family obligations and keep Wizarding society alive.
lovely. Thank you, Hermione."
. On the other side of that Cabinet is Remus! And Remus knows the dog’s name! He is Padfoot!
Blaise shrugged. "I'm just trying to be a good prefect. Keep you berks in line. A little daily peace and quiet is worth a suck or two, even for a limp-dicked mob like you." He put his terms on the chart and turned to Draco, curiosity lighting in his eyes. "I think there's one more offer to go. Draco?"
The Slytherins seemed delighted with this dressing down of the Weasel, but Harry didn't get to stay to see how Ron sorted them all out. Hermione already had her hand on his arm and was tugging him down the stairs. He glanced back at Malfoy, who was looking a little wan, but he couldn't exactly tell Hermione that he needed to stay to discuss the details of a magic cocksucking contract, now could he?
The name floated into the edges of his barely-awake brain.
A lick of excitement curled through Harry. "Fine. But I'm going to spank you as hard at this as I do at Quidditch." He took his position over Neville, in the same stance as Malfoy. "You're going down, Malfoy, and I mean it in every single way."
"We vote." Theo leaned forward. "Come on, let's get this done. I vote for myself, of course."
Now Harry was cupping Draco’s balls in his hand, rolling them between his fingers. Draco felt his sac tighten, pleasure surging up through the root of his cock and softening the edges of his anxiety, pushing it away into the shadows at the edges of the room.
Harry sighed. Remus was probably right—if he went into the Vanishing Cabinet Sirius had just come out of, he might be stuck behind the Veil himself. There had to be another way. And as he looked at Sirius’s haggard, concerned face, he realized what it was.
Granger stepped back, defeat written on her face. "Of course, Headmistress, I don't know how we'll manage, but we'll find a way."
he thought.
“I swear it.”
Because it’s love, Harry realized. That was the cup’s particular, beautiful magic, unlike any other in the world—the more you let it fill you, the more there was to give. His mother had understood that. It hadn’t mattered how much ordinary magic Tom Riddle had thrown at her. It would always be less than the magic of her love for Harry.
“Can I move now?” Harry asked
Marcus's gaze turned to Draco. His eyes were bright with a sadistic shine. "Then I guess the whole thing is off. Unless you want—"
“I love you, Draco.” Harry nosed into his neck, kissed him there and there and there.
Eyes still closed, Harry stretched out his free hand, fingers searching for Draco’s arm or shoulder. Or perhaps he might move his hand a bit lower--
He wasn't supposed to be here, wasn't supposed to be out of Hogwarts at all, yet neither of those transgressions worried him at the moment. Hogwarts rules seemed very far away at the moment, inconsequential compared to what lay before him: his family estate, with—if Tonks were to be believed—Father safely reinstalled inside it. The final sum in the equation Blaise had shown him on the Arithmancy wall. Draco blew on his hands to warm them, then reached out and touched the Snake's head. Instantly, an Auror materialized from out of the topiary, his wand pointed at Draco's chest.
"That was right fine, Harry." Seamus gave Harry's head a little rub as he wrapped up in his own towel and followed Dean out.  "Cheers!"
The wand stopped at Theo this time. He'd grown out of his rabbity looks sometime over the past year or so: the baby fat had melted off and the acne had gone with it, leaving olive skin and high cheekbones in their wake. His hair had darkened too, shading from mousey brown into light chocolate, and he'd grown it long and started tying it back with a leather cord. Draco tried not to bite his lip. Theo could be a threat. With a known Deatheater for a father, court connections or not, Theo could use a word in the right ears. A Ministry job, an introduction to the right girl—he could finagle all that with the judicious application of some favors.
The tingling scrub of a cleansing charm told him Malfoy was returning the favor. Trust a Slytherin to have a wandless way to remove the evidence, not that Harry was complaining. He was starting to realize all kinds of wonderful things came from keeping a Slytherin in your bed.
A sudden thought hit Draco, making his heart flop over. He'd glamoured over his scars this morning, hadn't he? He didn't want to talk about them right now, didn't want to know if Potter would apologize or put all the blame on Draco or, worst of all, roll away with a shuttered face. He chanced running a hand down his own chest and felt nothing there—the silvered scars were safely hidden away.
Zabini’s room was Draco’s room too, Harry realized. As Zabini shut the door behind them, he turned to look around, remembering the last time he had been in here. With the water rising and Draco’s cold wet lips on his. The silver candelabras overhead, the bed curtains billowing in the water, and there in the corner--oh. Oh, no. No. Draco wouldn’t have.
Harry's fists clenched. This was just like old times: he suddenly wanted to pound Malfoy's face, not his arse. But if that was the way Malfoy wanted things, then fine. Neville had just gotten his trousers open and Harry, irritated, yanked them down to thigh level in the front. Neville eeped a little as the waistband followed more slowly in the back, scraping across his bum, but lifted up obligingly enough for his pants to come down too. His cock sprang out, waving a little back and forth as it hardened.
What he actually did was push open the door to the Potions lab and slide smoothly into place in the circle. Nobody looked his way. He didn't rate that anymore of course, not that he'd ever show it bothered him.
“I didn’t get to go to Hogwarts,” Cassie piped up. “They killed me before I could go.”
on the door?" Malfoy's head tilted consideringly, cheek coming perilously close to the ever-rising water.
Widley returned with two trays, lovingly explaining the obvious--that this was shepherd's pie and pumpkin juice and etcetera, etctera—Draco stopped listening and just helped get everything arranged.
He grabbed his cock. Precome had slicked it up and it didn't take more than three quick, hard pulls before he was shooting long pearly ropes across the wet floor. He groaned, quiet as he could, and shook, and sat back, thinking hard.
“Of course,” Draco said and Harry wanted to hold up a hand and fend off this new of course because he wasn’t going to like it and pureblood Studies was a stupid idea because all of this stuff was better forgotten, not talked about and certainly not continued.
and positioned himself between Nev's legs, pushing them apart a little to make room. Coarse hair rubbed against Harry's hands and a shiver of nervous pleasure went through him. He pushed up and braced himself over Neville with one hand, searching out his target with the other. He felt his way slowly down Nev's body, which wasn't a caress, it was just feeling his way. His fingers brushed over a nipple—that got him a gasp—and then down and down until there it was—the unmistakable feel of a stiff cock.
But the boy ignores him, muttering words under his breath that cause more streams of silver to shoot from the end of his wand.
“Do you want me to push in?” Harry asked, and his voice was shaking.
Harry dropped his other hand back down to his cock and started stripping it, fast as he could, pushing it through his fist over and over. McLaggen was holding Harry's head, trying to keep it in just the right place and it was just so fucking much. He had a cock in his mouth and he was actually fucking a man with his fingers and he was tasting McLaggen's pre-come already flowing across his tongue.
Or maybe Draco really was awake, because dream Harry had never been this nice to him.
Draco froze. Literally, it felt. He suddenly felt cold all the way from head to toe, chilled against Potter's heat. "What else did Blaise tell you?"
If the boy came through a cabinet—
Harry straightened up from the fireplace and turned to Draco, his eyes soft and dark. “Perhaps it’s you who should make the plan,” he said, his mouth opening in a slow deliberate grin. “A little while ago you were accusing me of ordering you around like a house elf. I wouldn’t want that.” He reached out and hooked a finger into the waistband of Draco’s trousers, pulling him closer. “So how about you order me instead?”
Harry shouted.
“I didn’t lie about that,” Draco said. His voice sounded far away in his ears. “I’ll never change back. And I love you more than anything.”
Fred advanced a step or two, coming into Harry's space. He smelled of sweat and dust and cedar and his lips were quirked up in amusement. "You got what you wanted, Harry. What's there to fuss about?"
"Can you? Can you understand that while sending your child to Hogwarts for a first-rate magical education is necessary, it also represents a very real risk for the upper-crust? Your precious only son, sharing a common room with a half-dozen pureblood girls whose parents are pushing them to lure him into bed?" Zabini twitched his wand and the equation began to spin. "If your son gets some pureblood girl up the duff, Potter, he's got to marry her. You might be able to ignore a Muggleborn's bastard, but if some pureblood's precious flower lures your son into an ill-considered liaison, you're buggered. There's nothing you can do. He's got to marry her and her family—whether you care to be allied with them or not—has just gotten their foot in your ancient family door."
"Of course not. Testimonials are always appreciated." Draco licked his lips, for real this time. His mouth had started to go dry.
your family keyed you in third year?”
Draco checked the fine print on the contract, looking to see what charm they were using to measure favor size. There it was—the Wiggens Weigher. He wrinkled his nose—that charm tended to be a little biased in favor of the recipient of the service. He would have preferred the Scilodex Scale.
Nev gave him a friendly look as he climbed over them. "It's okay, Harry, really. I think you might have found something else you need to focus on for a while."
"I need to talk to you. I think you know why."
"Whatever he's done, I'm sure he deserved it," came a mocking voice from the doorway.
When Draco looked up, Blaise was studying him. Draco let his hand drop, suddenly self-conscious. Blaise would never say anything, especially at a time like this, but he knew when Draco was hurting. Physically, and otherwise. Draco jerked his eyes away, looking up at the chart instead. He'd missed what Theo had said, but the offer was on the chart already in cool black ink. Two sucks for two favors, medium sized, up to a size of twenty-five each.
at risk!" Even as he said that, voices were pouring in from every throat. Nott and Neville and Goyle and Seamus and well, it seemed like everyone was yelling at once.
“Well that was bollocks,” Zabini said when they were back in the hall outside the Headmistress’s office. He nudged his bath cauldron away from his hip, only to have it bob back again and begin trying to insinuate itself inside his bathrobe. “But you heard McGonagall. Draco can’t be at the bottom of the lake or the dungeons would be flooded.”
Malfoy wasn't in the showers. Harry finished as quickly as he could—it took a little while to scrub the lake smell out of his hair—dressed and scrambled off to breakfast, passing a sleepy Ron who was just heading up to the showers on his way.
In the background he could hear Zabini sighing with satiated pleasure and Neville sighing with resignation but all Harry could focus on was the feel of Malfoy's cock in his mouth, the taste of his pre-come, and the sounds of pleasure that was spilling out of him. He groaned around Malfoy's cock, lost in his need for it, and he finally got a hand on himself too. Malfoy seemed to notice, seemed to like that Harry couldn't help but wank himself while sucking Malfoy off. His body stiffened, tense, and a whine came out of his throat, and then Malfoy was coming, pumping shot after shot into Harry's mouth.
“Harry.” Fred raised his own wand and pointed it himself. A puff of dark purple smoke came out the end and hovered around his face for a moment before dissolving. When it did, Harry saw that Fred now sported a black eye to match his swollen jaw. “I’ll save you the trouble, yeah, Harry?” He winced. “Less painful this way.”
Potter beamed right back at her. "Yes, thank you very much, Widley. Can you fetch Mr. Malfoy's things from upstairs? He'll be moving into this room with me."
“You daft idiot,” Draco said. “I just told you I want to be here. You want me to show you how much?” He reached for Potter’s hip to pull him back down on the mattress, but Potter batted his hand away.
He pushed through the door at the end of the hall and found himself in the Hall of Doors. The door slammed shut behind him and the doors spun around him, finally coming to rest at one with a long silver scratch down the center. Harry felt his face grow hot—he had made that scratch himself, with the knife Sirius had told him could open any door. That hadn’t turned out to be true, had it? There had been one door he hadn’t been able to open at the age of fifteen: the Chamber of Love. Back then, Death had been ready to admit him, as had Prophecy and Time and even the Brain, but not Love.
The door slammed behind him, a hollow sound in a suddenly huge space. Shelves filled the room in every direction, layered two, three deep with every manner of junk, all covered in a thick layer of dust. The room itself stretched to the horizon, looking like some kind of ur-antique store, some platonic ideal of a kingdom of junk.
“Yes, and I need—” He hesitated. What, exactly, should he say? He couldn’t very well admit that he wanted to go down to the Veil in the Department of Mysteries because if his godfather had fallen through the Veil and then reappeared out of a Vanishing Cabinet, it stood to reason that Draco could disappear into a Vanishing Cabinet and reappear through the Veil.
If he'd had time to think about it, Harry would have felt shy and awkward and all kinds of things like that. As it was, he really only had time to think,
Zabini shot him a look. "Literal breeding, you understand me. Not just the metaphorical, use-the-right-teaspoon type of 'good breeding'. Making sure your offspring procreates with the right person is of utmost importance in those quarters."
Blaise put Greg's offer on the chart, where it was regarded with a general lack of enthusiasm. Greg was hardly a novice at the service—it was too useful a skill to be ignored in their House—but a square skull and a limp tongue wasn't much of pull.
"I'm not stupid!"
Professor Vector looked up. She blinked, as if it took a moment to place him—after a summer of dealing with star-struck fans, Harry loved that about her—then said, "Mr. Potter. Can I help you?"
And equally heartfelt appreciation to maesterchill, for her steadfast enthusiasm and eagle-eyed beta skills.
"For fuck's sake, Nott," said Flint, "let the man take a piss."
Resentment curdled inside him, along with what Harry didn't want to admit was a surprising pang of loss. He really had wanted to fuck the superior look right off McLaggen's face.
“A single knut? Cheapskate. What do you take me for?”
Basically, it was a bloody fantastic snog and Harry hated to end it but—
Harry nodded impatiently. What did this have to do with Malfoy and sucking cocks? "Of course."
. The founders thought if there was water coming in, it would be through a broken window. Which the students could then swim out of. Understand? Are there any other safety measures regarding living under a lake that you'd like to cover before our imminent deaths?"
“I messed up,” Harry said thickly, fighting back a sob. “The cup is from the Chamber of Love. It had all the water we needed. It kept refilling itself, no matter how much I drank, and we were supposed to use that water to get you out, just like when the water was filling the Slytherin dorms, like you said, it was the water that broke through the door, but I knocked the cup over and now it’s on your side of the Veil and it isn’t working and I—I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t—I don’t—I didn’t trust you, and I don’t know if I can. Maybe that’s why it’s not refilling anymore. But I love you, Draco, and I—”
“Salazar Slytherin,” Draco swore, as a tiny geyser of water suddenly shot out of the cup and hit him full in the face. He dropped the cup in surprise, and the geyser subsided as suddenly as if a faucet had been turned off.
“Sappy git,” Draco said, even as his heart stuttered,
“Have you brought what I asked you to retrieve from the Manor?”
"My forte is cleaning up fucking Slytherin messes. Which you ought to appreciate."
“I’ll snap out of it exactly seventeen hours from now when the full moon rises and I transform,” Remus said, his voice shaking. “Until then, Harry, for God’s sake have some pity and leave me alone.”
It was amazing he’d managed to defeat the Dark Lord even once, let alone multiple times. It was too bad he hadn’t been there the night the Dark Lord had melted the key to Draco’s sexuality in the enormous fireplace at Malfoy Manor. On the other hand, then Draco might be keyed to be lusting after girls now. No--for all the humiliation that night had brought to him and his family, he wouldn’t trade anything for this chance to be with Harry. Even if it might be his last.
Draco closed his eyes. He liked sliding a finger inside himself while he wanked, liked imagining the finger was a cock. Okay, Potter’s cock. Did he dare admit that now?
The next chapter will be posted on Saturday, June 16. Be sure to stay tuned, as we'll be getting back to some action deserving of our "explicit" rating, we promise!
“Because I was panicking, all right?” Harry felt a flare of anger in his chest. He took a breath and did his best to tamp it down. "Those fucking rat-keys were bad enough, but then that horrible--” he hesitated, not wanting to insult Draco’s childhood friend-- “those horrible bats,” he finished.
“Did the twins mean it to be you all along? Thought they’d make you into a right proper Weasley brother, something like that?”
Draco slid his mouth a little farther down Potter’s cock and wondered again if he was dreaming.
"Quit stalling and get on your knees," Nott said. He was already unzipping his flies, with quick nimble fingers that would soon be in Draco's hair, forcing his head down.
ALL THE THANKS are due Maesterchill, for her tireless and enthusiastic beta work. Any remaining mistakes are so very much ours.
Zabini frowned too. “I thought Draco was with you, Potter.”
Ron stiffened. His hands tightened hard in Harry's hair. "There. Right there. Suck me. Faster. Oh fuck, oh fuck, that's perfect, I'm going to—"
“Sir, why are you here? State your business or leave the phone box.” The Welcome Witch seemed personally unbothered, judging from the unhurried scrape of emery board across fingernails. She was probably reading from a script, Harry thought as she continued, “Other witches and wizards may need to access the Ministry. You have until the third beep to comply.” A metallic beep sounded from the phone. Then a second one.
Draco nodded. He knew. Aunt Andromeda had been close with Sirius, but Regulus had always been his mother's favorite. "My mother mourned for him," he said a little defiantly, with a glance at his own left arm where his Mark lay hidden beneath his shirt. "I know he was a deatheater, but my mother cared about him. She always tried to look out for him when they were at school together."
Dean dropped gently down and pulled Harry with him. The tile was cold beneath his legs, unevenly laid, and hard on his knees. Harry concentrated on those sensations rather than the warm strength of Dean, the feel of his chest pressed to Harry's back.
“What? Let me go, damn it.”
McLaggen didn't even look surprised, the berk. Never expected to lose, Harry bet, because bad things never happened to beautiful people like him. He'd probably sat the war out on a beach in Ibiza, checking The Prophet in the morning before taking a nice cool swim. Probably complained over dinner that Dumbledore was taking too long to win the war and really, didn't Harry understand that normal people needed to finish their education within a reasonable period of time?
Cassie plumped down on the bed. “In here, of course.”
"Right." Potter looked pleased at that thought, for some reason. Then he grabbed his sweater and pulled it off, pushing it past the bed-curtain to flop onto the floor. His hands went to his tie next—that slithered off into a heap next to them—then his fingers went to his shirt buttons. "Come on. You too. We need to get out of these wet things." He flushed, then went ahead and added a
Harry paused, winded from their wild run through the Manor, leaning over with his hands on his knees. He looked behind them but it was safe—no rat-keys to be seen. “I think they’re gone.”
Draco had seen that look when he'd watched Potter talking with his friends across the Great Hall. Genuine, concerned eyes meant for Weasley or Granger or even little Creevey. If by chance his eyes came up and he saw Draco watching, though, his expression would turn at once hard and angry. Draco didn't deserve that kind look and he definitely didn't understand why he was finally getting it. "Why are you doing this?" he asked at last, wishing he could let it be. Just enjoy it, whatever this momentary madness was.
Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to stay and join Remus in his misery. He needed to do something. A visceral memory of the feel of Draco’s body under his hands swept over him, terrible in its specificity: those bony clavicles, the silky skin at the base of his throat.
“I hate you like this,” Harry blurted. The words felt good even as they hurt, like pulling out a splinter. “And Sirius would hate you too if he knew you weren’t here for me when I needed you.”
"It's not the middle ages. There are charms for contraception."
"I didn't say anything," Draco snapped back, batting the finger away. A trickle of warmth crept back in anyway. Pansy always knew when his mood was turning dark.
Harry pushed cock down his throat almost frantically at the thought of seeing himself on his knees in Ron's old bedroom, Chudley Cannons posters flapping on the walls while he waited for the door to open, to see who it was he had to suck off next.
Washing off the thin film of existential dread? Substituting the caress of water for the touch of a human hand? "Ron spilled jam on my pillow," Harry said instead. It wasn’t really a lie. It just hadn't happened tonight.
"Oh?" Draco stayed where he was against the wall, doing his best to school his face into cool scorn, unsure if Nott was winding him up.
The general population, Draco was given to understand, thought that favors came in two sizes: large and small. Utterly ridiculous. Favors actually came in every size, from the mildly difficult to the monumental, and they were measured on a scale from zero to one hundred. A favor with a size of one might get you a saved seat at dinner. A favor with a size of one hundred would get you a seat in Wizengamot, if the person you contracted with could deliver it. Well, and if it was legal. Illegal favors were governed by an entirely different system.
“You can. Draco, there’s a hole in the barrier.”
“Aghh!” Draco cried out, reeling backwards, wiping dog slobber off his face but unable to hold back a grin. It liked him. And maybe it was a wet, sticky kind of enthusiasm, and maybe Draco had never, ever been the type to appreciate canine kisses, but on the other hand, he'd never quite needed unconditional love as badly as he did right at this moment.
Remus sucked in a heavy breath as he sat down, blowing it out slowly across the hot surface of his tea. “Given Greyback’s allegiance, there are a number of werewolves in Azkaban. We’re representing a few of them—some of them are clearly innocent of any involvement.” A fierce anger lit his features for a moment. “As if a general member of the public could tell one transformed werewolf from another in the light of the moon. We all look the same to them.”
Thank you again for reading! We'd love to know what you thought! And please come find us
“What?” Something jarred their mingled magic, and then Harry rolled off him, his cock sliding out of Draco’s body. Draco felt suddenly terribly empty. Harry reached for something on the nightstand--his glasses? No--he was fumbling with the jar, he was taking out the key, that fucking key.
The lights were out and Harry was in bed alone. Not that he was disappointed--of course, he was bloody lucky to be left alone. Still, he wondered if that was going to be it. If the whole thing was going to be a laugh that no one ever mentioned and certainly weren't going to do.
"I'm wet." Draco picked at his trouser. "Well, damp, at least. You too. We'll get your bed all mucky."
“You could… call me by my first name too.”
Malfoy hesitated, then grinned. "You want to ask a question? Beat me at a game. Winner gets to ask whatever they want, no holds barred. Loser has to answer."
Harry tensed all over, hope and fear tangling inside him. The cabinet in Draco’s dorm room had no twin anymore. Was it possible? It had to be.
Draco waited for the snarky follow up.
Harry grinned back at him. "I'll win. I always win against you. What's the game?"
Thank you to Tari_Vilya for the beta! Comments loved and appreciated—they keep the chapters coming!
Potter nodded and scrambled off the bed, digging through things under the bed and hopping back up with a little brass sneakoscope. Father would kill him—always use your own sneakoscope, someone else's could be tampered with—but he just didn't believe Potter would do that. Besides, he hadn't known Draco would ask for one and how likely was it that he had a doctored scope handy in his trunk?
Dawlish’s wand,” Tonks said, ignoring Draco's babbling and reaching out to catch the Auror’s wand as it jumped neatly from his hand into hers. Only then did she turn to Draco, the sharp frankness of her gaze shutting him up as easily as a silencing spell. “I’m not arresting
The potion burned his throat, but as it reached his stomach, Draco felt it begin to work almost immediately, slowing his racing heart and sending a curious tingling feeling through his arms and legs.
A low, pained sound came from the shape in the corner. No, not just a shape: the moonlight now illuminated a man, face turned towards them. No one Draco recognized, but he seemed innocuous enough, as cellmates went, and if there was anything in the man’s mild brown eyes as he looked at Father, it was worry.
Malfoy looked genuinely confused. "What does that have to do with it?"
. It had been magic, not desire. How could he have been such a colossal imbecile as to think Potter actually wanted him? He couldn't even bear to shake Draco's hand when they were eleven. Why would Potter ever look at him kindly, let alone want to stuff Draco's cock down his throat now?
Draco could have said if things had gone differently at the Manor this evening. If Father had only understood he--
Dean was watching Harry with that artist's eye of his—it made Harry feel more naked than naked, even though his eyes never strayed far from Harry's face.
Unless maybe it wasn't the twins who had started it? What about Bill, what about Charlie—had Ron had to service them too? Was that the duty of a younger brother in the Weasley household and fuck if the idea of a Burrow Christmas hadn't just gotten a lot more dick-hardening in concept.
Neville ran his tongue around his lips, looking a little more interested than a genuinely nice guy should. “What’s to stop the poor sap who gets picked from refusing to go through with it? Other than conscience and keeping a promise and all that?”
The twins’ faces lost their grins.
Harry's cock deflated. Not all the way, but enough maybe to answer the Neville/Luna question. In the combined girl/bloke sex-mad rubbing themselves raw image, it was the Nev parts that did it for him. Not the tit, so much as the male hand on the tit.
“You can’t yank me around like that,” he said, his voice tight. “I won’t have it.”
Zabini raised one perfect quizzical eyebrow. "I really don't." He twitched his wand and the equations swirled. "Unless you've come to learn what 'x' really equals? Or you yearn to solve for 'y'?"
“A what?” Harry stopped moving his hand.
Voices came from somewhere off to the side, the unmistakable sound of the twins talking over each other, rapid as one thought following another. Harry headed in that direction, trying to get the anger back but really only feeling the hurt.
, where we will post updates about this and other projects. <333
” Harry bellowed. An enormous black snake flew from the end of his wand and landed on the floor between them.
But he didn’t. “I want out of the contract,” he said instead. “I don’t care what you have to do, but do something. I’m not your sucker anymore.”
"How interested?" Malfoy asked hesitantly, like he was a bit afraid of the answer. "Short term interest? A little fun this year interest?" He stopped then started again. "It's okay if you don't know."
"What do you mean?" Harry said finally, because if he waited for the twins to stop enjoying his confusion, he might be here forever. This is what a tenterhook is, he thought suddenly, weirdly, and probably inaccurately. It felt like a tenterhook, at any rate. "Just spit it out. How did the contract work?"
Draco wobbled. Father was still alive. For all the horror Father had dragged him through, Draco still couldn’t bear to see him hurt. That softness, he supposed, was what had made him such a terrible Death Eater. It could make him a good son, though, if it helped him do whatever it took to save his father, right?
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not sure I ever needed to know how blue your balls are,” Dean said, from the floor next to Seamus. “But fine, I’m in too.”
Somewhere ahead of him was the mermish village but the token was keeping him closer to the castle, going down rather than out. Just as well, Harry figured. That cabinet was probably even now sinking toward the village and he'd hate to have to explain to a bunch of trident-armed natural swimmers why there was a cabinet perched atop their town hall.
“It’s traditional.” Draco was now leading the way to a small door set in the gap between two bookcases. “Oh, don’t look at me like that, Potter. This isn’t some Pureblood thing. Even the old Muggle libraries on the continent used to keep bats—they eat the insects that destroy books. Countless priceless collections have been preserved by this lovely species of bat.”
Clutching the sheet over his groin, Harry had leapt up from the bed and was pointing his wand at Fred’s throat.
“You know I spent the first half of my life being taught to lie and hide.” Remus finally looked up, brown eyes warm, amber flecks catching the light. “I’m not complaining, mind you,’ he added mildly. “Those skills served me well for a very long time. I would never have made it through Hogwarts if I hadn’t learned them.”
"Ooo, clever." Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Harry looked up at his other hand, resting on Malfoy's stomach. Silver words gleamed in the low light:
He moves further along the path, the scents in his nose unbraiding themselves into separate strands as his dog mind processes their history, their meaning. The smells of grief and rage and despair embedded in the dark gold scent of his urine are so overpowering at first he would not be able to stand it were there not another shining strand his nose detects even at this distance. One he knows he will find in all its fullness and glory if he tracks the scent of his suffering back to its origin.
Malfoy gave him a lazy smile. "Good timing, Blaise. I was just telling Potter here that he needed to see a true artist in action." He rolled off Neville—Neville looked a bit bereft—and over to Zabini. He undid Zabini's trousers and pulled them, together with his pants, entirely off. Then he settled himself in between Zabini's legs, preening a little under the indulgent smile he was given.
"OK. I can see that." Harry scuffed the floor with a ragged trainer.
. The scent of oil and sweat embedded in the wool belongs to
Harry felt all his hair stand on end, as if his anger were an electrical current. He would hex Nott into oblivion, right after he pummeled his stupid face, if he had so much as
Again the wand started to spin.
--” Everything went taut inside him, stretched to near breaking.
The next day Harry stood by the lake, shifting nervously from foot to foot, shivering despite his heavy cloak. He should leave. This was a bad idea. There was no situation involving the twins that ever wasn't a bad idea. It was a definitional thing, he was coming to realize. If you took your average dark lord's disregard for human dignity, added a sense of humor, and divided by two, you got Fred and George.
Then again, what did Draco really understand about why anybody did anything? He’d always thought McGonagall allowed Dawlish to use her office because she approved of that extra level of intimidation, that she wanted Draco to feel small and scared. She’d surprised him completely with her reaction to the flooding of the Slytherin dorms, though, hadn’t she? She hadn’t blamed it on the Slytherins in general or Draco in particular. She’d made sure the Slytherins were comfortably re-housed. Father would never have believed they might be fairly treated by a Gryffindor. Then again, the list of things Father had been wrong about was ever-growing, wasn’t it? Maybe Draco had been wrong about Dawlish too.
Draco didn’t know how to answer. What did he like? He liked not being spat on. He liked not being tortured, or watching other people be tortured in front of him. He liked knowing his mother was safe now. He liked not having to get on his knees for every male Death Eater who passed through Malfoy Manor.
"The laundry?" Draco echoed, unsure whether he was being insulted in some new way. The Aurors' grins turned nasty. "You didn't think we'd be letting Lucius Malfoy back in his bleeding study," Pribbling said. "Not when it's most likely spelled to the ceiling with Dark Magic. We've put your dad in the laundry room, where he can't get into trouble. Now go on. We've got gates to guard."
"Because that's how the contract works, Potter." Malfoy said patiently. "Everybody bids, says what they're willing to do, how many sucks per week they'll give, etc, etc, and what they want in return. Then negotiations begin—who'll do it for less, who'll do it more often, who'll offer more favors in return. Finally everyone comes to an agreement on who the sucker will be and exactly what they get in return."
Harry caught his eye and smiled. Then it faded. "Bellatrix was a Black too. She killed Sirius." He blinked fast a few times on eyes that had gone a little watery. "You didn't know any of this? Lucius must have known. I'm surprised he didn't tell you."
“It’s all right. I know how to do it.” Harry nodded, deciding. Draco’s way was almost right, but not exactly. Love’s magic would break the Veil for them, but not if they were on opposite sides. They had to be together for it to work.
The Auror flicked her wand again, casting a silencing spell that left Dawlish opening and closing his mouth like a fish. She turned to Draco and winked. “Better for him that he remains silent,” she said, “seeing that anything he says can and will be used against him.”
Potter scooted down the bed without another word, almost trembling with excitement. "I want to, I'm going to—"
felt embarrassed about it. It wasn't his fault Malfoy had to be out here planting what looked for all the world like a row of meatballs rather than eating breakfast with the rest of the students.
Harry's fist flared with pain. He yelped but it was lost beneath the din—Fred yelling out, Gryffindor confusion, Slytherin glee. He called his wand and stalked toward Fred, who'd landed on the floor by Neville's bed. A corridor had opened in the crush and Harry raised his wand, his head filled with the image of Malfoy drowning in his own dorm room, blue and cold and alone. If Harry hadn't gotten in—
Harry laughed and took the lead, leaping up the last couple of steps and pulling open the door to the corridor outside. He saluted the Fountain of Love as they ran past it, mentally congratulating it on its victory over its sad neighbor. How long had the Chamber of Love been plotting that? It must have been hard for Love to live next door to that miserable grey twilight. Maybe some of the other rooms were in on it too, he thought as arrived in the Hall of Doors. Had those floating brains dreamed it up? He pictured them escaping their tanks and sailing the seas of Love into the vastness beyond where the Veil had been.
“Onan’s Relief, The Fair Sex’s Honor Guard, The Eater of Sin,” Fred finished triumphantly.  “They had a lot of fancy names for the job, but basically it boiled down to one chap each year taking care of the rest, in the oral way.“
Harry moved behind him, wrapped one arm around Malfoy's waist, and covered his hand on the wand. "I think I proved your wand works for me," he said, not able to help the smile that curved his lips up as he pressed them to Malfoy's neck. "Come on now. The wand just directs the magic. We'll let our power flow through it together."
So Ernie McMillan had gotten the nod and Harry couldn't even really complain. McMillan had been a member of Dumbedore's Army, and he'd stood up to the Carrows, and he'd fought hard in the Battle of Hogwarts too. He deserved it as much as anyone.
Thank you, dear readers, for sticking with us during this longish posting pause. Although our posting frequency has slowed significantly compared to what we were able to achieve during the summer, the remainder of this fic is plotted and we will deliver more chapters as soon as we can!
to them. He could go to the library and find a Pagliacci score or two, something rousing and thoroughly Italian—
"No. It's not how it works." Harry shook his head as if he could shake that answer off. His fingers tightened, bruising the apple in his fist. "The twins said the sucker is chosen randomly but what actually happens is that one by one, people are eliminated, starting with whoever most doesn't want to do it." Harry took a breath. "Finally, one bloke is left. The bloke who most likes cock. He has to er, service his dormmates whenever they want.
Harry’s hand bumped gently against Draco’s arse cheeks. “Can I wank myself like this?” Harry asked. “With just the tip inside you? I won’t push farther in.”
. Something like that."
Harry nodded and took a bite of apple. He tried not to think of the type of question he hoped Malfoy would ask. Can I suck your cock?—that would be a good one. Would you like to suck mine?—that would work too. "Sure. Ask away."
, Potter would be keeling over, frozen stiff with that comically sincere expression still on his face.
you talk to me, Malfoy." Potter said. Except it wasn't like that. It was one word at a time as they rolled back and forth, each time Potter was on top. Draco was almost glad each time his grip gave and he went underneath again—at least he got to hear the next word in the sentence.
McLaggen moaned with delight. "Fuck. Yeah. Like that."
"I'm not—" Harry stopped. He wasn't sure what he was going to say.
“You can’t just sit here and drink yourself under the table,” Harry ploughed on, desperate to get back the Remus of this afternoon, the one who had given him sensible advice and told him everything would be okay. “You’ve got to do something, Remus, please, you’ve got to snap out of it--”
The dog settled under Draco's petting, its wildly wriggling rump finally calming enough to plump down on the ground. "Who's a pretty boy, then?" Draco asked, to the dog's immense pleasure, both of them disregarding the truth, which was that this particular dog couldn't qualify as pretty under even the most relaxed of standards. In fact, Draco realized as he sat back on his heels and took a longer look, the poor thing looked horribly neglected.
Harry followed Remus into the kitchen, where the kettle was already flying onto the stovetop and the cups were tumbling out of the cupboard ready for their tea. Had Remus never been able to move on after Sirius--had that been the real problem? Would it be like that for Harry, unable to move on after Draco? That was ridiculous, Harry was young, this would pass, of course it would, so why did it feel just the same? “You don’t mind that she’s with Charlie now?”
“Yeah? You want me to wank with the head of my cock inside you?” Harry’s voice turned rough.
“In my defense,” Remus said, breaking into a loose, lopsided smile Harry had never seen before, “I’ve had a bit of a shock.”
"Right then." Fred picked up the contract and recited the incantation. The candles squelched themselves and a beam of silver light shot out from the end of the wand. It passed over each of them like a tight spotlight: Neville, Dean, Seamus, McLaggen, Ron, Harry, George, Fred, again and again, spinning more and more slowly until finally it jerked to a stop in front of--
Malfoy let it linger there, hot against his own leg, then leaned forward, smirking. "Already with the mistakes."
"No more fighting." Marcus planted his feet. Theo looked relieved, to be honest. Potter still looked mad. "Don't want McGonagall thinking this isn't working. Had enough fuss moving in here. Not moving somewhere else."
McGonagall was evidently thinking the same kind of thing. She glared at Potter: if looks could
"I don't know what you want from me that's worth it." Marcus drummed his fingers on his leg.
"So what—"
Draco thought from somewhere far away.
It was dark except for a pair of candles burning in silver candlesticks at the head of the table. Remus sat slumped beside them, his head resting on his arms. A small glass stood beside his elbow, and further down the table, as if Remus had pushed it away, stood a half-empty bottle of Ogden’s 20-Year-Old Pale Fire. Sirius’s leather jacket was draped over Remus’s shoulders.
Circe only knew what the git was mad about now. Had he changed his mind about wanting the Slytherins here? Gotten tired of his little adopted puppy of a House now that he had to live with them? Resentment flared through Draco. "We're allowed to be here. The Weasel assigned this bed to us."
Harry said nothing. He wasn’t ready to attempt to explain to Sirius about Draco.
Harry cleared his throat. “Remus? Are you all right?”
Harry leaned his head on the leaded-glass pane, confused. “What does house size have to do with how old your family is?” He looked around but at least in here it seemed comfortingly ancestor-free. “‘Rest in peace’ is just a saying. It doesn’t require a bedroom.”
?” He didn’t sound even slightly grateful for Harry’s intervention. “What the
Blaise reached for his wand, pulling it out of the middle of the circle. "I'll go next. If you don't mind, Draco?"
"Funny you should mention that." Ron's look was turning ever more superior—and happy too. His hand had moved up Harry's body, resting now on his hip. "Speaking about the twins and what they like to get up to—"
The place he can’t escape—
"Hello?" Harry called out.
Padfoot paddles his paws in the nothingness, frantically searching for the floor of the cabinet for anything he might touch or smell.
George pointed at Harry then back at Ron. “Harry's your best friend in the whole world and he’s in. You followed him all the way from the Chamber of Secrets to the battlefield. You going to let him do this little thing alone?”
Fred snorted. His mouth was close enough now that he could almost have stuck his tongue out and licked a line along Harry's cheek, if he'd wanted to. "Ron's a good friend to you. Credit to the Weasleys, he is. He doesn't want to suck cock—don't we know it, George!—but he didn't want to leave you behind to sign any contract of ours."
Harry pushed a second finger along with the first, feeling a thrill as he felt it disappear. McLaggen's thighs were shaking and he was grunting now, deep sounds of pleasure.
"Oi," Ron said when he'd finally stopped panting and taken a look over at Harry, now lying back on the bed beside him again. He poked a finger in the direction of Harry's bits. "Don't be a bloody martyr. Get yourself off too."
Harry hoped it was McLaggen. He’d love to see that entitled mouth wrapped around his cock. He'd fuck him shallow at first, then deeper, hands bunched in that perfect blond hair as McLaggen sputtered through his thrusts--
“Er.” Harry licked his lips. He hadn’t thought that far ahead. He couldn’t just ask to go to the Department of Mysteries—it was highly restricted. He could say he wanted to see Arthur Weasley,  but then they’d probably send a message to him, and he’d come down to the Atrium to meet Harry, and there was no way Harry wanted to confess his plans to save the wizard he was in love with to the father of his former girlfriend.
Malfoy sneered. "The fact I got off is a testament to my being male, not to your skill, Potter. Sufficient friction applied in the generally correct area is bound to have an effect no matter how miserable the cocksucker is." He flicked a hand at Harry. "But go on. Get to it."
“More than you could ever know.” The words just popped out of Draco’s mouth all on their own. Merlin, was Gryffindor behavior contagious? Draco hoped to hell not; if so, he’d be dead within the week.
"I'd say, get a room but," and here Zabini paused long enough for the rumbling water on the other side of the door to make its own statement, "but I'm guessing that might have become, ah, problematic? Am I correct?"
Fred wrapped a hand in Harry's school tie, tugging him closer. "It was my present to George. Well, and to myself too. But we love you, Harry. We don’t mind if you pinched the present for yourself."
the Auror shouted, and Dawlish’s arms and legs were snapped tight to his body as thin cords issued from the Auror’s wand, wrapping around Dawlish’s limbs and snugging them hard against his body.
“No need, no need.” Fred adopted a conciliatory tone. “Harry here has already figured out the loophole, haven’t you, Harry-lad? If you refuse a request and the contract magic starts squeezing your bollocks, there’s nothing says you can’t just hex the bloke who asked you for a suck. When he withdraws the request, your bits swing easy again. Nothing to it.”
Of course Draco bloody hadn't. And Greg had to pick now, of all times, to stop ignoring him? Draco waved his hand airily. "Oh, any size."
Draco nodded again, relieved that this time Dawlish wasn’t going to toy with him before getting to the point.
Potter's mouth moved in sympathy and suddenly the trays were sliding over to the windowsill, out of the way. He pulled Draco into his lap and fell back against the pillows. "All right?"
Harry nodded absently. "It's got a window-seat." Harry remembered that first night he'd spent at Hogwarts. Sitting in the window, looking out across the grounds, feeling happy for the first time in years. He turned and impulsively gave Hermione a little squeeze. "Thank you. I am sorry about all the work I've made for you, asking McGonagall to house the Slytherins here."
"Harry." Ron sat down on the side of the bed. He gave Harry a long, solemn 'Percy Weasley, Prefect' kind of look.
"Harry?" Neville sat up a little. His cock bobbed back and forth across his stomach like a wet metronome. "Could you, you know?"
Greg's cheeks pinked but he looked pleased. "Fine. I'm changing my vote to Theo."
“Fine, then, I’m in too.” Seamus rolled his eyes. “Don’t think I can suck a dick sober. If I lose at least I'll have an excuse for spending the whole year soused.”
Malfoy's grip tightened around the shovel. He swallowed. "Of course. I should have brought that up myself. That was an inescapable rudeness, to make you mention it first." Misery suddenly sharpened his features. "I apologize unreservedly. I doubt you'll believe it, but I had no idea whatsoever that you were under a compulsion."
Draco was all ready to say the words in his most supercilious tone of voice. But when he opened his mouth, what came out instead was a… well, a whimper. Because Potter was stroking rather than pushing now, just gently stroking with his finger, and it was soft and slippery and sent electrical pulses up Draco’s spine in a way that never happened when Draco fingered himself. He drew up his knee as Harry had asked, and then, still nervous, he gripped Harry’s forearm.
Padfoot remembers everything.
Potter snagged the box, opened it, and squinted at the contents. "Do you like coconut? That's about all I've got left. Unless you like the one with the cherry that sits in that messy little syrup?"
Draco opened his mouth to say something—some form of bloody hell, yes—but Potter's mouth was already closing around the bell-end of his cock. His hips jerked up, involuntary, wanting more pressure, more slide. Potter lurched and gagged a little and drooled some too but all the time he was making the most needy noises and his hips were moving convulsively as he sucked.
He wasn’t going to cry. Only who would have thought that inside all Harry Potter’s headstrong reckless power, his magic that crashed headlong through the world and never looked to see what destruction it left in its wake, who would have thought that inside it was such terrible gentleness, such stillness, such love?
The dog whined. Draco sighed as he tried to undo a tangle or two. On one hand, maybe the fact that there was a dog here was a good sign. If the dog had been here long enough to start looking like this, then there must be something to survive on here. Maybe it meant there was another entrance, and better yet, another exit.
BUT! We'll post the first couple of pages of the next chapter on
George moved behind him, not pressed up against him, just close enough to run a hand through Harry's hair and down past his ear. "One by one, the wand picked the bloke who most hated the idea of sucking cock. One by one, it counted down to the bloke who most wanted to get on his knees for the rest of us."
“Rat-keys and bats are traditional in place like the Manor,” Draco said. “That kind of thing is important to my father.”
Fred and George looked at each other, some sort of silent twin communication passing between them.
"Regulus Black," Potter said, once Widley was gone and they had settled themselves in front of the trays, facing each other cross-legged on the bed. "Sirius's younger brother."
Draco laughed out loud. It echoed warmly in the mist. He’d ended up on the wrong side of the Veil after all. He wasn’t dead, though, so that was another thing his father had been wrong about. He could feel his heart thudding in his chest and taste the mist in his mouth. The Ministry had called this room the Death Chamber. He stepped forward, bonked into an invisible barrier, and bounced back.
"Sure. Good. Glad to help." Harry's PJ bottoms were damp all down the front but thank Merlin it was too dark for anyone to see. He climbed out of Nev's bed and back into his own, feeling a little lonely now. Nev had wanted Luna, but Harry—well, what did Harry want?
. Who didn't seem to think there was anything particularly weird about it, who thought it made them even closer, more like real brothers, which maybe he had the twins to thank for. Right before he murdered them.
“Oh, it’s an old technique,” Draco said, tugging at a blonde curl which seemed to be made of golden horsehair, smiling at Cassie as she turned to beam up at him. “There’s a canvas rolled inside the doll so the portrait-memory can enter. And then it’s just a matter of a simple
Draco wasn't sure there was any such thing as a 'we' when it came to people who loved him. There was just Pansy, who was the best friend anyone could ever wish for. Well, and there was Mother too, of course. And maybe Father, if Draco hadn't bollocked up anything too badly recently.
Sirius grinned at the ruined biscuits, looking not at all fooled by Remus’s attempt at normalcy.
Harry groaned in frustration. He knew exactly what the headmistress was thinking; that this sounded like yet another one of his cracked theories that he’d desperately tried to convince her of when he was a child. Snape's trying to steal the Resurrection Stone! Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin! Malfoy’s killed himself with the Vanishing Cabinet!
"You'll stay here with me," Potter said authoritatively. He nudged Draco inside with a warm hand on his back. "Ron won't mind."
. The other part—the sensible part—blew him a raspberry and said
“Charlie is wonderful with Teddy and Teddy loves him. I couldn’t ask for more than that.” Remus rubbed the back of his neck. “There are many people who would be frightened of the child of a werewolf.” His lip quirked up. “A man who tames dragons, fortunately, is not one of them.”
3rd November. Sirius would be thirty-nine today if he had lived. Harry’s sides ached with the tears he was suddenly holding back.
And transforms.
“If the wand chose
Harry mumbled out a vague grunt, eyes fixed on the still fiercely spinning wand. Not-me-not-me-not-me was all he could hear inside his head. Not-me was safe, not-me was the road he wanted to follow, the one everyone else was on.
Draco fumbled for his wand and tried to cast a warming charm on himself. He couldn't-some kind of magical interference pushed back at him, put there by the Aurors, no doubt, after they'd witnessed the tracking spell he'd cast earlier. He clenched his hands to his chest, fighting to stay warm. His palms stung, scored by tiny sharp stones he hadn't felt when he fell. He struggled to his feet, realizing as he did that his knees stung too. There were so many things you felt as you stood up that you'd missed on the way down. If he'd learned anything since sixth year, it was that. The sound of the vanishing cabinet closing with a gentle click. The sound of it opening again, the slow creak of its hinges announcing an incoming flood of anger and hate—
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where are we, anyway?” Draco asked, still scowling.
Fred laughed. "Of course we did, young Harry. Took you long enough, by the way. Was expecting you to come charging in days ago, mad as hell and asking what we'd done."
It wasn’t true, Draco knew that. Blaise’s loyalty was touching, but Draco wanted him to understand. “The Dark Lord got into me everywhere,” he said. “Even when I--even when I’m with Potter, what if Voldemort’s there, too?"
No cabinet. No mist. No boy. Nothing.
“Knut for your thoughts?” Potter inched closer, throwing one of his legs over Draco’s.
McLaggen stiffened first, his back arching. Harry shoved his hand in hard, feeling for that spot that made McLaggen whine and sob.
Harry turned the water to cold, fast. Don't get hard, don’t get hard, for fuck's sake, cock, listen to me--
"That's not—" Harry shook himself. The room wasn't what was important here. "The contract," he said, squaring his shoulders and standing up straight. "You tricked me."
Nott saw him, of course.
"Oh, Lucius isn't cruel." Zabini laughed. "No, wait. He is. Of course he would have removed Draco's sexuality entirely if he could. That doesn't work so well, though. Hard to put it back. Better to change it a little. Lock him into liking cock instead of cunt. Make him quite unable to tolerate the thought of cunt, in fact. That way he couldn't impregnate the wrong girl."
Harry dodged, slipping past him, twisting to avoid the spear as it thrust forward. The whole village was stirring but up ahead he could see the cabinet perched atop a green-columned building. Grindylows skittered past him, grabbing with sticky, sharp-nailed hands, and more and more mer-people were pouring into their streets—
Draco hung back, uncertain. Potter might be enough of a sentimental bleeding-hearter to want to make things up to the people whose every belonging was now underwater but he couldn't possibly mean Draco as well.  The Gryffindors would probably rather hang him by the neck until he was dead than let him in their rooms and he wasn't sure he blamed them. Maybe he could find some deserted room, some unused cupboard somewhere and set up a bed in there?
“Sir,” Draco said finally when he’d mastered himself enough to trust his voice. “I was informed you wished to see me.” He didn’t point out, of course, that this wasn’t the scheduled time for a probation check. Dawlish could check on him whenever he liked, Draco supposed.
“I never--” Draco began, and then thought better of it. If Tonks thought he’d done a good deed, better to let her think it. “Is my father all right?” he asked instead.
"That's how the other blokes who suck me like to do it. Don't need a hand to hold yourself up that way. You can do right by me while still getting yourself off."
Harry frowned. The last time he'd seen the twins this enthused, he'd wound up magically obliged to provide oral pleasure to his whole dorm. Anything they considered 'epic' probably involved massive property damage or, possibly, the invention of an embarrassing new disease. "Do I want to ask?" Or is this the kind of thing I need to be able to tell the Aurors, when they come, that I knew nothing about it?"
Still kissing Draco, Harry raised himself up to his knees and elbows, then moved one hand between their bodies, his lubed fingers fluttering over Draco’s balls, then further back to coat his arse. Then he stilled his hand, waiting.
Malfoy let his head fall forward until their foreheads met with a clunk. "No, Potter, it's
“That key is not the key to my sexual orientation,” Draco said. The words were thick in his throat. “The Dark Lord destroyed that key. During sixth year, to humiliate my father. This is a key that opens a grimoire Dawlish took. If I don’t give it to him, he’ll keep torturing father. Except it’s broken now. The emerald’s gone.”
“Sir,” he began, hating the tremor in his voice, “I know the key is broken. But I brought it as testament to the fact that I--that I’ll--”
“Harry, do you really think—” Remus began.
He listened with one ear to Potter telling Widley something else—ordering dinner for them in bed?—while remembering Theo's brother. Dead now, a deatheater killed in the Hogwarts battle, and Draco wasn't sorry about
Oh. Harry scrunched his face, trying to remember anything else about the charm even as that particular hope died a messy death. "It doesn't pull air from somewhere else?"
"I just meant, well, I thought I was close to Dumbledore, but it turned out I didn't even know we were both from the same village. It wasn't quite the relationship I thought it was."
Harry sucked the tip of Neville's cock into his mouth, tongued it roughly, then pushed it out. "Oh, and you know all about 'riding brooms', I suppose."
“I told you,” said Nott, struggling a little as Harry tightened his hold on a fistful of Slytherin tie, “I don’t know where Malfoy is. We thought he was in his room, but when we finally got the door open, he wasn’t, all right? Now let go of me.”
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of, Harry. You’ve been through terrible ordeals, and I realize I do not know nearly the full extent of what you’ve suffered. But getting into fistfights with other students--yes, I am kept apprised of what goes on in this school--skipping classes for days at a time, and now this again: convincing other students that some outlandish and wholly imaginary danger is imminent--Harry, these are clear signs of a lingering and very understandable trauma.”
