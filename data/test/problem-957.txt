‘Yes, but he thought you were the baby of a prophecy concerning him—a prophecy that foretold the person who would end his reign of terror. I will share the prophecy with you when you are older—I am still deciphering it myself—but it essentially foretold his death, and Voldemort sought to destroy an enemy before the enemy could truly become a threat.’
‘Oh,’ Zabini said, sounding relieved. ‘That doesn’t sound too bad. How can I help? And there’s no point trying to tell me the others shouldn’t know,’ he added before Draco could speak. ‘Pans especially. She’ll know something is happening and she will force it out of us eventually … so – how can we help?’
The more Draco spent time with Weasley, the more he saw why Harry would value his friendship so much. Weasley was gregarious and friendly and laid-back, rather like an overlarge, over-eager dog. He had a big heart, if a rather insecure disposition, and he had truly forgiven Draco despite their bad history. Draco was ashamed to have judged Weasley on the money he hadn’t had.
Draco can’t remember when he first realised he is different from his parents, but the truth is impossible to avoid when it stares him in the face whenever he looks in a mirror. Yes, he is pale and blonde and thin like his parents, but their skin doesn’t have that odd, unnatural glow like his; their teeth aren’t sharp and jagged like his; and their embraces don’t break bones. His parents tell him that he is a Veela – a special child they wanted so much, they scoured a dark, tangled forest for him, and he has given them such wonderful six years of their lives so far.
Potter’s eyes flashed, remembering Umbridge, remembering the indignation of being accused of a crime by the very institution he should trust. ‘Good for you, Malfoy, you’ll need it to save you from Azkaban when they find out what you are.’
‘Such a charming tale of brotherhood and camaraderie,’ Lizzy says with a sharp smile like a bare dagger. ‘It would naturally support the stories of Young Master Malfoy having turned over a new leaf – that he is not the Muggle-hating pureblood bigot his family was. Lovely. And, Malfoy, did you think such illuminating reports have reached our ears that it might be permissible for you to show your face before the people you abandoned at Hogwarts?’
How far has Harry gone, a single boy stumbling in the darkness? He has his wand at least, and he must be looking for the Chamber of Secrets; that is where the journal said Ginny Weasley was taken.
Potter stares back. ‘You’re bonkers,’ he says, sounding awed. ‘You’re absolutely crazy. You were trying to call Death himself? Why the
He thinks he terrifies his godfathers and Minnie with his fervour in embracing his sex. ‘Harry, listen,’ Remus pleads over the Floo. ‘There is nothing wrong with being omega, yes, but you have to understand what an unshielded omega scent does to unmated alphas.’
He swings around, and urges his broom into flight in a mere blink of an eye. Much as Harry appreciates the other wizard’s athleticism, he is alarmed by the rapidity with which the distance grows between them.
The jagged edges of his shattered mind click into place. He is alpha. He is a Veela. And he is Draco Malfoy, named for the fearsome, fire-breathing beast, and he
‘Fine,’ he says. ‘How do you want me to help you with your wand? I’m not an expert on unicorns. I’m only helping Grubbly-Plank with some research.’
‘I’ve seen Dark Marks,’ Potter said persistently. ‘And they shouldn’t look like that. You need to see Madam Pomfrey – there must be a potion or a salve or –’
She catches Draco’s arm, and starts walking quickly, but they hear footsteps hurrying after them, and he looks over his shoulder to see the man walking parallel to them, a fevered expression on his face.
Harry grinned, picking up his fresh pint. ‘Mione reckons I’ll be lonely without you. I disagree. I can’t wait to see the back of your ugly ginger mug.’
Draco and Potter were both riveted now. The Headmaster smiled wryly. When he was talking about his lover, he sounded stronger, his words not tattered at the end like rags.
But Harry only looks at him blankly, shakes his head and says: ‘I don’t reckon I have the time, mate.’ Hermione watches them, thoroughly disgusted, but she doesn’t say anything more to Draco than ‘I hope you know what you’re doing.’ Draco wouldn’t put it past her to suspect something, which only makes him more worried.
After he repaired the Cabinet, he would have to kill Dumbledore. His heart fractured further. Keeping his eyes closed, he probed along the fracture lines. He would kill Dumbledore, Wizarding Britain’s last hope against the Dark Lord, and leave Potter vulnerable and easy for the picking. Potter, dead, loose-limbed and white-skinned; never would he look at Draco with those brilliant green eyes and flash that smile that dared Draco to something equally rash.
Draco stared at Potter in disbelief. There was pure venom in Potter’s words. Potter had become taller over the summer, nearly as tall as Draco now, but somehow, Potter seemed … narrower, compressed. There was something great and overwhelming Potter had crushed within him, sealed off within that tall, lean frame, threatening to spill over. Draco caught a sense of imminent danger.
Standing in the middle of the chilly courtroom, the eyes of the public on his chained form, Draco had all the freedom to look at Harry Potter standing in front of him, speaking to the Wizengamot on Narcissa and Draco Malfoy’s behalf.
His godfather is stroppy, because Moony is out trying to recruit another group of werewolves. The last time he came limping back covered in bites and scratches. The Order’s work has become more urgent and dangerous since the Hall of Prophecy break-in, when numerous Ministry officials—including Fudge—saw Voldemort. Wizarding Britain is now girding themselves for the coming war.
‘I’m sorry, my son. I must say it to protect you. You have to forget him,’ she whispered, her breath smelling strongly of wine. ‘I cannot bear to see you like this … like the light in your world has gone out.
Two, the blond kid is a boy: the most beautiful boy Harry has ever seen, so pretty it’s ridiculous, and Harry has to rub his eyes behind his glasses, because the boy seems to be
He looks at Harry with those piercing, blue eyes, and nods calmly. ‘Wait for me. I will be there in a minute.’
He looks towards the stairs, and sighs once more. He shakes his head, and begins to make his way upstairs, footsteps leaden.
Draco’s parents don’t know this, but their soundproofing charm doesn’t work very well against Veela ears. If Draco presses his ears against the door and listens very carefully, he can hear their conversation rather well. They have set an alarm spell on the door now, so Draco has to be quite creative with his eavesdropping techniques.
curious how he could have known my intentions. We have only greeted each other at a distance a while ago.’
Draco doesn’t reply. He feels Harry’s sleepiness, distantly aware that the other boy is about to fall asleep. He watches Harry across the aisle separating them, the rise and fall of his chest. Later, if Harry wakes before him, he will be forced half-awake as well. There are many things inconvenient about their bond for Draco: the constant knowledge of Harry’s emotions, the transmission of any pain, and the maddening
She cups his face between her hands, brushing his tears away with her thumbs. Harry sniffs, dropping his broom to grab onto her sleeves. Minnie leans in, and envelops him in her arms. He buries his damp face in her shoulder, relieved and grateful. It’s okay; he won’t be going back to the Dursleys. Minnie said she would protect him. He will be good; he will work harder at being good from now on.
“Yes.” There was a triumphant sneer on his face. “Trying to kill you with the most potent poison known to wizardkind only saw you transform into a
Goyle was clearly scared of Harry – perhaps not of Harry, but of what he represented, which, Harry was learning very quickly, was intensely unfriendly to Slytherins. Well, if he wanted to help them, he would have to first convince them that he
The three of them stares at the massive pile of rocks, momentarily silenced by the apparent impossibility of it all. There is an opening at the very top, the edges crumbling away from the curved ceiling. Draco groans. He has to fly, of course. He staggers to his feet, shrugging off Ron and Neville’s hands, and straightens up, his jaw clenched.
His guest arrives on time, ducking into the corner booth Harry has chosen and apologising for making Harry wait. Harry stands, helping the other wizard out of his coat.
Narcissa and Lucius are barely listening. They are cooing over their new little boy. Adopting a Veela child was not their first choice—even if Lucius’ grandfather was himself an adopted Veela baby—and they took this path only after trying for years and years for a child to no avail.
Draco nodded. Potter fetched their cloaks from behind the door. After Draco muttered the spell sequence that locked the shop, he turned to face Potter. The other man smiled, draping Draco’s cloak on his shoulders for him. When he fastened the catch, his hand brushed the underside of Draco’s chin, sending a jolt through Draco’s body. Draco’s breath caught in his throat, and he kept very still, a mingling of terror and ecstasy in his chest.
A blonde man lays crumpled against a massive gravestone, enclosed within the wings of the marble angel crouching over him protectively. The backs of the great wings are stained black, the stone shattered in places. The man stirs, a breath wheezing through chapped lips.
Harry laughs, and Draco hears his heartbeat speed up, as if afraid—or excited. He reaches out, presses his palm against Harry’s chest. ‘What is it?’ he asks softly.
They return to Hogwarts for sixth year, but school has taken on a patina of unreality, as the wizarding world grapples with Death Eaters in the shadows. The Order and the Ministry have started the fight early enough that the Death Eaters have yet to publicly declare war.
Harry hails Malfoy, pulling his broom to a halt. The blonde wizard stops with a wide, smooth arc a distance away such that Harry must raise his voice in conversation. Malfoy is being cautious – a realisation that pricks Harry like stinging nettle. There is no light by which Harry could read the other gentleman’s face; the pale face is cloaked in the shadows of the inky night.
He stands in the field, watching with a grave face, as Lizzy spins around, laughing, in the midst of a windstorm of crisp autumn leaves she has Summoned. Pointing her into the darkening sky, she sends up a spray of brilliant orange sparks. When she finishes with her display, she turns around to face him, spreading her arms wide-open, and declares: ‘I am a witch.’
Three days after the Battle of Hogwarts, the Aurors found Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy’s bodies in a shallow grave on Malfoy Manor grounds. Draco Malfoy’s body was nowhere to be found. No one knew precisely what Voldemort had done to Malfoy; those who did were dead.
to his face. It has always been a distance Harry thought, rather despairingly, the other man does not want to breach. So it was
The Slytherins, who nurse a disdain for every Gryffindor, would taunt Harry by swooning in front of him. Parkinson would loudly deride Muggle-raised weaklings. It’s better for people to think he has stunted magic than to know he is omega anyway, so Harry doesn’t mind the Slytherins much. Draco does: he always has something nastier to say to shut them up.
you. Dumbledore was the one who took Harry out of the cupboard a year ago, but Minnie was the one who
Draco’s heart jolted. Under the bandage, his left forearm itched. He forced himself very still, forced himself to meet Potter’s eyes. ‘And you think you know what I am, Potter?’ he asked quietly. ‘And do you
‘There are alphas who choose to be with betas,’ Hermione pipes up. ‘It’s not set in stone. Sure, it is, if you want children, but I don’t see why alphas can’t be with betas, and if they want a family, they could very well use surrogacy.’
Bingley is reluctant to take his leave, looking about wistfully, but Darcy dryly reminds him of an appointment they must keep in Meryton, and chivvies his friend along. Malfoy draws Harry aside as Mrs. Bennet and Lydia walk the other two gentlemen to the front door.
Draco straddled Potter’s legs, taking a moment to admire Potter’s firm, perky arse. Potter looked over his shoulder, frowning slightly.
, when Harry goes somewhere he cannot follow. ‘Don’t go where I can’t see you,’ he hisses, fingernails digging into Harry’s flesh. ‘You won’t leave me again.’
Draco is abruptly aware of the life that moves warm in his veins, that sings in his powerful limbs. With every beat of his heart, he is declaring his place in the world of the living, here with Harry. They are both not dead—yet. And he knows—even clearer than before he lost Harry—that from now on, he would tear the Underworld apart to keep them together in life
The Headmaster had taken a step back and was leaning against the wall, face white as bone. ‘Who did you bring into the castle?’
‘Don’t pout,’ Sirius laughs, ruffling the top of his head. ‘You won’t be flying at school anyway. What about this – you show what you can do for the end-of-year exams, and
Draco steps back, wiping his muddy hands on his trousers, trying to rub away the sensation of having touched Potter’s waxy skin.
son will. If Snape won’t help us …’ She groans, and Draco hears footsteps run across the room, and back again; his mother paces when she is upset. ‘Salazar, will we have to send him to Beauxbatons? I don’t want him so far from us, Lucius!’
‘We have only known him a day,’ Harry interjects. ‘We are not certain he is as reliable as we wish him to be.’
, let me take it off. You take off your clothes too, don’t be selfish, you prick. Fuck me, you’re so beautiful, Draco. How are you
The twins find the Room of Requirement with the Marauders’ Map for the training sessions. Faster than anyone could have imagined, it becomes such a settled thing that they have to name themselves, and chose Dumbledore’s Army. ‘Well, Dumbledore is our general in the fight against You-Know-Who,’ Hermione says.
He screeched, tearing at the window catch with his bird talons, half-aware of the large scaly wings that burst from his shoulders. He caught sight of his oversized bird head and steel-grey beak and Potter’s disembodied frowning face reflected in the window.
do not think that you will be foolish enough to do this!’ Harry shouted, brandishing his wand in Malfoy’s face. ‘If you go out to
, all right? Have you been travelling all night? Fuck, I should have remembered that you walked all the way in too. I could have walked slower, you know. Bloody stupid of you not to say anything.’
Harry blinked. Malfoy looked at him, smiling genially. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his tailored school robes neatly in place, his silver-and-green tie perfectly knotted. Like the rest of them, he looked like any other eighteen-year-old Hogwarts student; it took a longer gaze to see the dark smudges beneath his unreadable grey eyes and the faint worry lines on his forehead.
‘It’ll be good for you,’ she added solemnly. ‘Promise me you’ll come for it. It’s on Tuesday night at 8pm at Hogwarts.’
‘He’s omega, you see,’ Mother explained. ‘Blacks can’t be omegas, we are too pure-blooded and powerful for that, but Sirius never cared. He’s even mated to a werewolf now, would you believe the gall of that man? I hear they are soul-bonded. They live in the ancestral Black home in London,’ she laughed, apparently impressed despite herself. ‘Oh, I wonder how the portraits of our ancestors have taken to them.’
‘No!’ Draco says vehemently. ‘No, it’s not that, Harry. I – I – you were hiding the fact that you are omega. You couldn’t let people know. I can’t – I can’t do anything to jeopardise your efforts during the war.’
Sirius and Moony step out of the way. As Harry steps up onto the pedestal next to the blond kid, he realises several things in rapid succession.
‘I thought you didn’t want to have a lengthy conversation in the forest,’ he snaps. ‘Quit yapping and start
Harry feels a piece of driftwood pushed about by the sea of people crowding Diagon Alley. Before today, his idea of a crowd was the Tesco’s off Privet Drive during sales. He clamps his hand tight around Moony’s hand, certain that he lets go, he will get lost – a thought that makes his stomach flip.
Draco takes a step towards Harry, who has gone still, and meets his eyes unflinchingly. ‘Tell me I’m right.’
‘Professor Slughorn!’ Filch wheezed. ‘I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?’
‘You did?’ Harry says in astonishment, shooting him a surprised look over his shoulder. ‘They’re very good!’ Harry is examining a photograph of Colette in the forest: she is dressed in white filmy robes, forever caught in the act of twirling around, her mouth open in a laugh as she calls out to Draco.
She was trying too hard to sound casual. He looked up at her, frowning slightly. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but she met his eyes unflinchingly, a determined set to her mouth that told him she wanted to get it off her chest, whatever “it” was.
But Dumbledore must have known, because the whole school is woken by the sound of a phoenix’s eerie scream, the sky flat and grey with pre-dawn light. Pushing through a confused and sleepy crowd, Harry and Draco run to Minnie’s room, only to see a note scrawled with
Ginny pulls him outside, where they might have the pretence of privacy in the crowded house. He looks at her curiously. It has become somewhat of a settled thing for Ginny to be part of the group, despite Ron’s grumbling about little sisters. She is always good for a game of Quidditch, and when Harry is Seeker and Ginny Chaser, they usually win the game against her indignant brothers.
Narcissa Malfoy was dead before her head hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange stuffed her fists into her mouth, muffling the sudden keening noise that emerged wild and beastly from her. ‘
Draco rolled his eyes and followed. He began eating the sandwich the house elves had fixed for him. Filch was muttering gleefully under his breath, occasionally addressing Mrs Norris. If Draco weren’t so irritated, he would have felt pity for Filch. Imagine being unable to do magic when you were surrounded by it, and the brats who had magic wouldn’t use it properly; they wasted it on silly pranks instead, making more messes for Filch to clean up.
Draco stared at her, floored. She was trying to absolve him of his crimes. She was putting down his terrible and cruel choices to upbringing and circumstance. He wanted to tell her that she was wrong and that he was simply a terrible person, but his jaw locked. He didn’t want to ruin her nice little fairy tale. She looked back at him, gaze steady and calm.
‘The op-ed about using the Sorting Hat to create a Slytherin Registry. The writer thinks we need to watch anyone who might be a Slytherin, claiming that every one of them is a potential Voldemort,’ her face twisted with distaste. ‘Professor McGonagall was furious. Madam Pomfrey had to force feed her a Calming Draught to stop her from marching to the
‘Well? Aren’t you going to tell me what happened to you?’ Harry asks impatiently, grabbing Draco’s arm and putting it around him.
Six months and twenty-eight days since Draco started working on the Cabinet, he succeeded. He was staring into the shadows, a puppet stitched together with threads of exhaustion ripping at the edges. His wand hung limp by his side. He didn’t think he could lift it up anymore. The last try had taken so much out of him.
Gripping his wand, his teeth gritted, Draco started down the corridor. He didn’t have the chance to check if Potter was safe, but he knew he would be. Here in Dumbledore’s stronghold, there was no doubt he would expend all resources to keep his protégé safe. But – a splinter of doubt – Draco, an unqualified student, did manage the impossible.
‘Draco,’ McGonagall kneels on the ground next to him, taking his cold hands in hers. ‘Breathe. Calm down. Focus on breathing.’
‘Did Zabini tell you that? That stupid big mouth,’ Harry grumbled. ‘It’s not true; Malfoy didn’t give me love potion. Or rather, he
Harry rose to his feet, shaking out the cramps in his thighs. ‘Turn around.’ Goyle did, his face wobbly with fear and dread. The big man looked as if he were about to burst into tears.
Draco suppresses the burst of hot anger. Ginny Weasley, the youngest of the veritable Weasley horde and inexplicably alpha in a clan of betas.
‘Of course,’ Sirius smirks, patting his chest pocket. ‘Never failed me once. Brought me through the war.’
Zabini came to his room that night, frigid with anger. He had no qualms and wasted no time in telling Draco precisely what he thought of the way he had thrown Pansy’s concern in her face. Draco watched his friend rant as he paced the floor in front of him.
Harry wanted to weep so he looked down and focused on giving Malfoy a blowjob instead. He pressed the heel of his hand against Malfoy’s bulge, causing Malfoy to gasp. Hiding his wicked grin, Harry crouched down, took the zipper in his teeth, looked up and began to slowly pull it down. Malfoy was staring at him, pupils blown wide with desire. Pressed beneath Harry’s chin, Malfoy’s cock was twitching in anticipation.
‘I guess you know how alphas can control their release of their pheromones? I have been suppressing mine when I’m with you, out of consideration of the fact that you live with Malfoy. We can’t have you going home dripping in my scent; Malfoy will think I’m trying to seduce you,’ Zabini smirks. ‘I’m releasing my pheromones now.’
The Bennets quit the party hastily. Bingley is distressed to be robbed of Jane’s company, but is immediately concerned to hear of Lydia’s “illness”. He promises to call on them the next day to give them news on the rest of the ball. He does not, and instead, dispatches a note begging off his visit. He does not promise to make it up to them on a separate occasion.
‘He was going to destroy the world,’ Dumbledore said. ‘You should be glad, Harry, that Draco’s ambitions are limited: he only wishes for his family and he to live.’
The boy who wakes up at the end of the nightmare to find it real, and no amount of screaming could drive it away, because at the end of the day, he remains alone.
Bingley does look the very picture of a man in love: attentive to Jane’s every imagined need, exuberant in his examination of her thoughts and opinions, and desirous in commanding her whole attention. Malfoy, standing between them, looks slightly nauseated. Mrs. Bennet is ensconced in a corner, watching Bingley and Jane with avid satisfaction. Over the course of the night, Harry realised swiftly that Jane was partial to
Draco is trying to be kind, while Harry has stupidly forgotten what is most important here: their friendship. He needs to try harder, or he would lose his best friend.
lengthy exchange that he must want to interrogate you. He lives in abject fear of my having circulated all his secrets.’
‘Harry, I’ve lived in the same dormitory as the two of you for the past five years. You are good at hiding your pain every month—I don’t think the others see it, since they’re betas. I see the way Draco behaves around you, behaves around Ginny and I. He definitely didn’t fool me with those poor sods he has been stringing along. Yes, mate, I
He knows that Harry doesn’t like it when Draco sleeps around. He doesn’t blame him, because Harry simply cannot understand why. It has to do with the soul-bond between them – another secret that Draco must keep from Harry. From the first moment they met, Draco knows that no matter how he feels about Harry Potter, the other boy cannot be dominated or won over by excuses like fate and destiny. If this bond between them is to be consummated, it will because Harry wants Draco on his own accord – and nothing to do with
He strokes Harry’s hair back, pressing his lips to Harry’s forehead. ‘One day, you will not be afraid to be omega. I promise. The day your parents died, Moony and I swore we would do everything we can to make this world better for
to meet Voldemort, so that—this could end. So that people could stop dying. I’m afraid for my godfathers, for Minnie, for our friends. I’m afraid for
, they hear a rustle in the bushes behind them. They look around to see an unkempt wizard two rows over in the midst of shearing a bush. He is frozen, staring at them with wide, goggling eyes, his wand raised in mid-air.
Draco groaned, pushing Potter away slightly. ‘No, you have Quidditch practice. You’re the captain, you prat.’
He only needs to know that being Harry Potter’s soulmate means that his strength does not only mean hurting the people around him; it can be useful. He leans in and says with a smirk: ‘Not so scared now that I’m here, eh, Potter?’
Harry quickly looks up and his stomach drops at the sight of the other boy’s face – still and pale, his eyes dark with fury, his jaw tightly clenched. Well, fuck, now he’s gone and pissed Malfoy off. He swallows, licking his dry lips.
Harry blinks at her. She sighs and releases him. Rising to her feet, she remarks obliquely: ‘I suppose I must inform Ron and Hermione that we are to bear Malfoy’s persistent presence once again.’
Draco looked at him and saw that his hair was sticking out at the back and remembered the way Potter liked it when Draco gently scratched his scalp as he kissed him. Potter’s face changed, the monster that bayed for Draco’s blood coming to the fore.
Draco exhaled, the wine-scented breath billowing against Harry’s lips. ‘Didn’t you say you would go down on your knees and beg me to come back to you?’
He shook his head. Now wasn’t the time to consider the Weasleys. He hurried on, dogged by the uneasy feeling that he was being followed. He glanced over his shoulder before he ducked into Knockturn Alley, but saw no one.
Draco jerks, looking up. Mathis is watching him across the clearing, dusk slowly seeping through the forest.
Potter was panicking, he could tell, so when Potter punched him right in the face, Draco supposed he shouldn’t be so surprised. In fact, later, when logic and reason was his once more, he reflected grimly that he rather deserved it: for outing Potter to his friends, whether he was bi or gay.
He sank back down against Draco, a hand on the back of Draco’s head. As they kissed, Draco continued rubbing Potter’s erection through his trousers until Potter drew away again, eyes dark with desire. Draco grinned wickedly.
The touch is transforming, heat spiralling up Harry’s arm, his skin tingling, and he shivers, pressing himself closer against the table’s edge. He tilts his head, unconscious at first, and then deliberate, because he understands now the natural indications of submission.
Tonight would probably be his one and only chance to do what he had been meaning to do for the past few years. He mustn’t mess this up.
The white-haired shopkeeper descends the ladder rather rapidly, his grey robes flapping around his pink trousers-clad legs. He jumps the last three steps, landing with a neat hop in front of Harry. His gaze sweeps Harry from head to toe—he feels Ollivander’s eyes on his scar as clearly as he might if the old man has pushed his fringe back to take a good look at it.
‘I miss you, pretty Draco,’ he said before rolling over and pulling the blankets over him; he went to sleep.
Draco couldn’t talk, making only distressed noises like a bird in a trap, and Harry stroked his beak and murmured reassurances, as Draco’s eyes fixed on him. He cannot remember what he said, but it worked, because with an effort, Draco shifted back into his human form, far too thin and pale. He still wouldn’t speak, but he allowed Harry and the house elves to take him to the bathroom, clinging to Harry’s hand as the elves bathed him. Harry watched the water dark and murky swirl down the drain for almost an hour before it ran clear again.
Dispassionately, with an almost lazy wave of his wand, Draco cast a Hurling Hex at Zabini. His friend was thrown to the ground and he picked himself up in the next moment. He could hardly speak, his outrage sputtering out in insults and curses. Draco kept his face blank.
Draco studies the familiar face in the darkness: wild dark hair, golden-brown skin, the curve of a cheek, chapped lips. His best friend. They have grown up a bit since first year; Draco is pleased to note that he is still taller than Harry. Growing up also means other things—Draco isn’t interested in dating, but Harry could be. His asking his godfathers about soulmates and love shows that he has at least been thinking a little about it.
‘I won’t need this,’ he hands Ron his wand. ‘Use it to find a way out. I’ll come back with Harry—and Ginny.’
"Beyond this overwhelming need to submit to you, completely and utterly?" Potter raises his eyebrows, stretching his scar. "Beyond this bone-deep awareness that you are made for me, and I for you? That our destiny was written in the stars, in the very foundation of our known world?"
‘Hullo,’ he says with a terse nod. ‘You look well.’ He turns away abruptly, addressing the shopkeeper. ‘Yes, we would like the standard set of robes for Harry, please.’
Looking up from his branded arm, Draco met Lord Voldemort’s snake-like red eyes, and was inexplicably overcome with the desire to laugh.
He whipped around, impatient, glaring as she reached his side, breathless with exertion. Further down the hill, Goyle and Crabbe were hurrying to catch up, loaded down with bags of sweets. Zabini was still down in Hogsmeade, spending the day with one of his Ravenclaw mates.
“No. I just omitted certain details,” Draco said sheepishly. “I didn’t want you to feel weird around me.”
furniture as well?’ Jane spends their first night as an engaged couple explaining the nature and limitations of magic.
Harry took that small, cold hand. His skin tingled where they touched, and when their eyes met over the handshake, Luc’s eyes were dark with an incomprehensible expression. Harry could only tell Luc was making him a promise, then and there, but whether that promise was in his favour, he had no idea.
They had been snogging for the past two weeks now, once a day, twice if Draco was lucky. It seemed Potter had his timetable memorised because he always knew when to catch Draco in the breaks between lessons. At night, it would be Draco, consulting the Marauder’s Map, who would seek Potter out.
Mr. Blaise Zabini is a tall, well-built, dark young man dressed in a beautifully cut coat accentuated with a bright, patterned cravat. He gazes around the room with frank curiosity, whispering at points to the lady at his elbow, Miss Pansy Parkinson. The lady is by no measure the handsomest woman in the room, but she commands a degree of cautious attention for her air of stout confidence and slow, sly smile.The last gentleman, Mr. Draco Malfoy, gives a striking impression: white-blonde hair fashionably tousled; dressed in dark clothes that seem almost plain, but upon closer inspection, would reveal themselves to be made from rich, vivid materials worth at least ten Galleons a metre; and a cold, reserved air that wards off the slightest attempt at approach.
‘I’m not having sex with them,’ he snaps. ‘It’s only snogging. I reckon you have it right though. Having boyfriends—or girlfriends—isn’t as much fun as people make it out to be.’
‘Such a pretty little boy,’ a man’s guttural whisper pushes against his ear, his breath carrying the stench of onions. ‘I’m going to take you.’
Harry was all hard angles and flat planes. Draco’s hands glided down his back, and stole under the T-shirt he was wearing. When his hand touched bare skin, Harry gasped, and thrust his hips against Draco’s. His erection nudged Draco’s thigh.
Draco is still holding Harry’s hand, even though his scrapes are healed. ‘Look,’ he says, bright with happiness, pointing at the sky, where the million pinpricks of stars are appearing from behind dissipating clouds. ‘Mother did say it’s going to be a clear night. This is where I practised flying, secretly at night. Mother and Father wouldn’t have been able to teach me, so I had to learn how to use my wings by myself.’
When Sirius and Moony heard about his invite, they insisted Harry bring Draco along the week he is staying with them. ‘They’d try to be nice, do you think?’ Harry asked Minnie anxiously. She pursed her lips and told him she’d write them a letter. But that is next week; now, he is walking through the woods to a place Draco calls his secret hideout.
‘What’s wrong?’ Mother repeats, glancing around the empty shop; the shopkeeper has yet to make an appearance.
!’ Draco shrieked, his frustration and outrage boiling over. ‘For fuck’s sake, Zabini, I didn’t Imperius Potter.
‘Since you are so kind to address me as Young Master, remove yourself from the room immediately. We do not permit servants in the drawing room,’ Draco said flatly.
They are eating in the dining room, as they have been since the Malfoys moved in. The house elves they brought from the Manor seemed to have regarded the state of 12 Grimmauld Place a personal affront, outraged that it has fallen into such disrepair in the care of a single ancient house elf, Kreacher. They have since overhauled the house, claiming the kitchen for their own and chivvying the masters into the dining room.
‘I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,’ Zabini interrupted. ‘He asked me about Nott’s father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he’d been caught at the Ministry, he didn’t look happy and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he? I don’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.’
What could Dumbledore say in face of such righteous fury? He nodded, shame-faced, and started explaining. He would have to entrust his discoveries to the few who were there: Minnie, Sirius, Remus, the Weasleys, the Longbottoms, Hermione, and of course, Harry.
They are defanging Fanged Geraniums, the buggers highly reluctant to let them do so. The greenhouse soon fills with yelps and swearwords as the plants nip at unwary fingers. Zabini obligingly offers to pull out the fangs, if Draco holds the plant open. ‘Since you’re stronger,’ the Slytherin says.
me, and you can be assured that your dear friends Weasley and Granger are going to get it from me.’ Draco is trying to wrench his arm away, his skin chafing under Harry’s palm. ‘I’m terribly sorry for taking up your time, Potter. Let – me –
‘Don’t be stupid,’ Snape growled. ‘The Dark Lord is a madman. You cannot change what he was born to be.’ Harry was irritated to find himself agreeing with the greasy git.
Draco is gawping at him, looking only more and more flabbergasted as Harry goes on. ‘The only reason you could have wanted me was because I was the only one there. I … I had to be sure that you would choose me if – if you had a choice to begin with.’
’ Harry screams, because Draco is falling, borne down by a suffocating weight he realises, shocked, for the first time in his life he cannot resist.
But the gold and silk were not what Draco wanted to show Harry. Over the past week, he brought Harry to the gardens, grandly showing off the vegetable garden he tended to with the help of the house elves, who beamed under Young Master’s praise; he took Harry flying across the expansive grounds, pointing out gleefully the shed he would hide in to avoid his mother’s scolding; he showed Harry his nursery, where his indulgent parents allowed him to scrawl on the walls,
The other gentleman’s smile fades. He looks down at his glass, and takes a long sip. Harry watches the way his long, pale throat convulses, an unidentifiable emotion stirring within him.
Potter raised his head, his fear still naked on his face. ‘What have you done to me, Malfoy?’ he whispered. ‘I want to punch you, but I want to snog you at the same time. Did you
‘No!’ Neville grabs Draco’s arm, yanking him backwards. ‘Draco, don’t let him do this. We can’t just blunder into Hogsmeade. We are giving Voldemort exactly what he wants.’
Draco wrinkles his nose as they enter the musty wand shop. The heavy, closed air and dusty shelves to his heightened senses. Ollivanders is unimpressive for a historically significant wizarding establishment, but his parents are insistent that a British wizard must wield an Ollivander wand. Being a Veela, he doesn’t need one to do magic, of course, but one must keep up appearances.
Draco was dumbfounded. Why would Wormtail’s name appear on a parchment Potter owned? Potter had to know Wormtail helped kill his parents. Not made by Potter and his friends then. He tapped the map again. ‘
Harry knows that she has nothing to fear, and he likes seeing how many of her former students still clearly remember and admire her. It’ll be nice having Minnie at Hogwarts, even if he has to remember to call her Professor in class.
Harry laughs, and shakes his head. ‘I would not do my courting in such a public space. It is quite ill-advised, when one could so easily be turned down.’
will always be more adept with such coarse weapons. Such as it is, I assure you that I am perfectly capable and willing to defend my own honour. It is a small matter of giving his scent to Rupert, I should imagine. Oh! Harry, could you steal me something of his?’
The knot in Draco’s chest—the hard-faced anger and bewilderment and betrayal—loosens, and, when Harry tilts his head, taking a step forward, unravels completely. Draco could have fallen to his knees, a supplicant at the feet of his lord and master.
Malfoy’s eyes snapped open, abruptly awake. He gave a little gasp, shoving Harry aside as he moved backwards. Cold air slid between their parted bodies. Malfoy shook his head. His terror – sheer, blind terror – was obvious on his face now.
There is a certain sense of unreality to the scene: Draco standing in his pants, Harry’s arms around him, the dark-haired man warm and pliant against him. Harry narrows his vivid green eyes, mouth poised to push Draco further.
Malfoy was clearly expecting more intense, needy kisses. He blinked in surprise when Harry began dropping soft, gentle kisses on his come-smeared face, tracing his cheeks, down to his jawline. Harry took Malfoy’s hand, brought it up to his lips, kissed the fingertips. He turned Malfoy’s hand over, kissed the inside of the wrist, felt the pulse against his lips. He clasped Malfoy’s hand to his chest, tucking his head beneath Malfoy’s chin, his ear against the other man’s chest.
Luc burst into laughter and his face lit up. Harry had thought him plain and mousy, but when he laughed – sweet Merlin, when he laughed, warmth flooded Harry’s chest and he could hardly think for the strange pain that twisted in his chest.
‘But where do we find the ones we know in the first place?’ Ron asks, frustrated. ‘They’re famous for being lost treasure! And the bloody Dark Lord would have hidden it better, once it contains a bit of him.’
Yeah, that would go down well. Luna suggested writing a letter, but wasn’t that too … personal? Intimate? She replied to his concern in her usual inexplicable manner: ‘But isn’t that what you want, Harry?’
Across the platform, the other boy emerges out of a seemingly solid brick wall, pushing a laden trolley at a run. He stops after a distance, and turns around, laughing with exhilaration, watching as his godfathers come out of the hidden entrance. Draco clenches his fists, gritting his teeth. Now, the connection pulses more strongly, akin to a second heart beating in tandem to his. He swallows, fighting back his nausea.
He adds it to the small pile on the chair next to him—his godfathers and Minnie gave him presents at the start of dinner. It’s Harry’s rule that he will only open his presents at the end of his birthday; after years of watching Dudley tear apart presents the moment he lay his grubby hands on them, Harry would rather savour the moment. Besides, half of the excitement of getting presents is not knowing what’s in them yet.
‘Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,’ Macmillan said, pointing to the small black cauldron on Slughorn’s desk. The potion was the colour of molten gold and had a rather merry feel about it.
He added with slight exasperation at the puzzlement on Potter’s face, ‘She’s in our year, you know. You Gryffindors are so insular. Admit it, you think Gryffindor is the best House and you don’t bother with people from the other Houses. Can you even count a Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff amongst your friends?’
Potter gives a bark of laughter. ‘Because Pans is always Drink-Disapparating. Mione would lecture her for hours if she finds out Pansy did it again.’
Harry flushes, hand pausing in mid-stroke of Draco’s hair. ‘I keep forgetting how little we talk about omega physiology.’
‘Apples, especially the big ones – they can be rather filling. I bet you live in a posh manor with grounds and all that. Do you have a horse?’
Yaxley shoved Snape in his chest, sending Draco’s godfather sprawling across the floor filthy with Draco’s blood and shit. Snape was shaking, his hands clenched into fists, his long greasy hair hiding his face from Draco’s view. The burly Death Eater stormed into the cell, hauling the unconscious Jackson to his feet.
ing the front of his robes. When they saw that he was not going to reply, they left him too, muttering about ungrateful bastards. He hefted his bag onto his shoulder and headed straight for the seventh floor. Safely ensconced in the Room of Hidden Things, he threw himself into his work and the rest of the world melted away.
He escaped into the hallway, just slipping past the hands of a stocky Auror he vaguely recognised. He pelted down the thickly carpeted hallway, heading straight for the street. In the large lobby, guests and employees were turning to look in the direction of the ballroom, alarmed by the raucous noise. None of them noticed Harry Potter fleeing the scene.
‘I know it was you, Malfoy,’ he snapped. Behind him, Granger and Weasley exchanged looks of exasperation.
The manic pain of the Cruciatus Curse; white-hot knives slicing his skin in the same spot over and over until he thought he might lose his mind.
Potter flicked his wand, levitating the Map from Draco’s hand. ‘Wouldn’t want to catch your filth, Malfoy. Do you know any good cleaning spells, Hermione? We would have to disinfect this.’
He looks exultantly around the empty land, his blond hair loose around his face, and Harry is looking at him, abruptly pierced by Draco’s beauty like the starlight now shining coldly down. He manages to forget most of the time: when Draco sulked because Harry sat with his Quidditch teammates at dinner, when Draco made a snarky remark about Ginny, when Draco thought it was funny to start a food fight by hurling cake in Harry’s face.
Around the table, Harry and his sisters sigh, some of them louder than others. Mrs. Bennet has taken up of late a campaign to persuade Mr. Bennet of the utility of a holiday. Naturally, Mr. Bennet, whose sole duty is to be obstinate with his wife for as long it amuses him, cannot be so easily exhorted.
He looks over indifferently. He is peering over Harry’s shoulder at the list of people who signed up for Quidditch try-outs. Narcissa sent a reminder letter this morning, predicting accurately that Draco would forget, and he dropped the elegantly wrapped packages into their laps, as they settled into the common room after dinner.
‘Oh. Yes, right, I forgot about that,’ Harry says, belatedly realising what Zabini is talking about.
Borgin swallowed nervously, wringing his hands tighter. ‘Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee anything.’
His father is talking about a man he has gone to see today, an old schoolmate from Hogwarts. ‘I should have known Snape wouldn’t do anything for us,’ Father grumbles. ‘Greasy prick. He has always been so quick to wriggle his way in to those with power. Good of him to cast us aside now that we have none.’
Draco smirked. ‘We’re snogging, Potter. You’re on your way to be less of an uptight prude, congratulations.’
Draco flinched, feeling each word as a physical slap. How strong was his Veela charm that Potter should still be attracted to him? He clenched his fists, fingernails digging into his palms.
Bright spots of colour appear high on Malfoy’s cheeks. ‘If you mean this room, Blaise spoke highly of Slughorn’s well-stocked library, and I wish to see it. I foolishly trusted his directions. If you mean this
Neither Voldemort nor Flitwick missed a step. They were smooth and graceful and Draco, unable to look away, threw up a little in his mouth, nauseous with the crippling cramps in his stomach.
Moony sighed and added with caution: ‘Snape and us—we weren’t on good terms when we were at Hogwarts. It’s a lot more complicated that Sirius makes it out to be, I promise. We did him wrong too.’
Luna focused the entire force of her beguiling innocent gaze on him. It was like trying to push away an orphaned puppy with three legs and a stump of a tail. His resistance wilted, his mind too fizzy with drink to provide much of a defence against her.
Draco caught the ruddy flush blotch on Potter’s cheeks before he opened the door and dashed out, leaving Draco alone in the disused classroom. Draco stood up slowly, straightening his tie, brushing the dust off his robes. He Vanished the empty bottles of Butterbeer.
Harry hesitates, looking at the stairs. He hears Moony and the school nurse talking, and there is movement. He tenses, his shoulders drawing up to his ears, thinking that they are bringing Sirius down to the kitchen, but he hears them moving up the stairs instead. He exhales, glancing askance at Dumbledore, wondering if the old man sees how much of a coward Harry is being, because the very thought of seeing Sirius, bloodied and broken, makes Harry nauseous.
Ron shrugged. ‘It doesn’t have anything to do with the Aurors … I just … can’t do it anymore. You know what I mean, Harry?’
Potter’s hand hovers above the curve of Draco’s cheek, close enough for Draco to feel the heat, for his skin to tingle.
He drops the box of chocolates on a stand in the foyer, as he waves them into the house. ‘Head down to the kitchen, Remus has some tea out. I’ll deal with the trunks—
‘I’m pleasantly surprised by you, Potter,’ Zabini says, his smile surprisingly friendly. ‘I thought all Gryffindors, with the exception of Malfoy and Granger, have no patience for the delicacy of Potions work.’
. ‘I … I suppose, in a way, yes.’ Colette, his Veela benefactor, has been writing him long rambling letters, whining at him to visit and to bring his mate along.
Harry munches on his sandwich, his mind cast back to Sirius bleeding out in the entryway. He feels the sharp edges of something darker and far greater than he can understand within him. The adults don’t tell him, but he gets the idea that being omega is something to be ashamed about, to be hidden. He wonders if the reason they don’t bring him anywhere is because he is omega. He wonders if being omega is the reason the Dursleys hated him so much.
They sat down for tea at a nearby café, Mother making self-deprecating comments about her age and the toil of shopping. At least the encounter with the Golden Trio had made her forget that she was supposed to be angry with Draco. He drank copious amounts of tea, trying to swallow his nervousness. When he thought Mother was comfortable and unwary enough, he acted.
It’s better now that the Malfoys have moved into 12 Grimmauld Place with them, so Draco is near, and Harry knows he is alive through that strange, unspoken awareness. Sometimes, he thinks Draco must feel the same awareness for him, because he replies to thoughts Harry has just formulated, but he doesn’t want to ponder the implications if it is true—Draco has only just come back to him.
‘I do not know what he means by such a thing,’ she declares at breakfast for the third morning in the row.
‘Yes, yes, you have heard about the soul-bonds between alpha and omega? You must have, my child, you are alpha after all – and an unreasonably powerful one at that. Yes, I see that you have already met your mate – the bond is active. Oh, dear, dear, yes, I see that I must place you in Gryffindor. Very well, you are not lacking in courage after all. So be it –
When they were seventeen and the four of them – Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione – were on that frantic journey across Britain, simultaneously fleeing and hunting Voldemort, Hermione asked Draco if he has met any omegas yet on a quiet night in early winter.
Irritation rushed through Draco. Apologise to Potter? Thank him? Draco had been raised to speak eloquently on all topics as a proper gentleman, but apologising and thanking Potter was beyond his abilities. He could not even begin to think about it.
‘As you’ve said yourself, Albus, he is going to Hogwarts. He will hear something of it. Would you rather he loathes us for hiding the truth from him?’ Minnie snapped. ‘If you will not tell him, know that I will simply have to tell him myself. Your folly, Albus, is always failing to see how much children is capable of understanding.’
Draco turns, and there is that smile on his face – the one tinged with disbelief and gratitude and exhilaration. He exhales, something between a gasp and a laugh.
He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand – all balled up in a fist, his skin cold to the touch – between his two hands. Draco stills. Harry takes a deep breath, looking up beneath his lashes. Draco’s face is blank, devoid of emotion. For all of Harry’s fears, the fact remains that Draco is
Harry stares at him, dumbfounded. ‘What? Do you mean after the anniversary ball? Suffer? What the fuck do you mean? I fucking enjoyed it, you twat. And you said it earlier—people you hate—what does that mean? I don’t
Yaxley stared at him and slowly nodded. He released Draco and Draco coughed, rubbing his neck. The burly blond waved with his wand, indicated for Draco to lead the way. The eyes of the others on his back, Draco hurried down corridors and up stairs.
“We have to make living arrangements as well,” Potter said brusquely. “You will be living with me. Don’t bother protesting. The wards around my house are strong, and I will be able to protect you best on home ground. Robards has already given the go-ahead, so don’t think you can appeal to the higher-ups.”
‘You are a strong boy, Harry,’ Dumbledore says gravely, as if he has heard Harry’s thoughts. ‘I’ve brought Madam Pomfrey—she’s the school nurse, and a very talented Healer. You have done well, fetching me like Remus told you to.’
It will suffice to say that Harry’s relationship with Malfoy is a strained one. There is the historic rivalry between their Houses of Gryffindor and Slytherin, the former to which Harry, Ron, Hermione, Lizzy and Lydia belong. Most students maintain a mere pretence of competition in homage to tradition, but the enmity between Harry and Malfoy was genuine on both sides. For Harry, it stems from disdain at Malfoy’s arrogance for a station in life
But it’s obvious to everyone that if they must parcel out roles in this coming war, Harry is the one who will lead them. He is good at spotting people’s strengths and helping them build upon it. He may be a relentless slave-driver, as Dean and Seamus moan, but he produces results, and no one complains when they emerge from DA sessions with a successful Patronus.
Hands grabbed his shoulder, and pain was a thousand needlepoints stabbing his body. His shriek tore at his throat; blood and saliva and sweet-salty pus flooded his mouth.
His father had been his teacher before Hogwarts, and exacted strict expectations. His father had often said he wanted great things from Draco because he knew he had the capability to achieve them. His father had been his hero, the man who had an answer for everything.
Draco blinked, bewildered. Jonas sat, the bed dipping under his weight. He placed a warm hand on Draco’s calf and smiled at him invitingly. ‘We have sex,’ he repeated, brazenly unaware of the awkwardness of his proclamation.
Draco inhaled deeply, catching the fragrance of the fresh autumn scent of the woods at the Manor, Quidditch leathers, and something that he thought he had scented just a few minutes ago outside the classroom. Potter passed him and the glorious smells wafted, momentarily intensifying.
He turns around firmly, stuffs his hands into the deep pockets of his jacket, and continues walking. Draco sniffs very loudly and mutters something that sounds suspiciously like
And what he wants is for his parents to believe that their son could be accepted by the wizarding community – even if Draco doubts it is really anything of an honour. He hates seeing the way his mother’s face pinches with worry, or the way his father attempts to smile. He
“Why are you so stuck on the idea of repaying? Have you ever thought maybe I do things out of my own selfishness?”
His mother would go for tea at the manors of other ladies, and more often than not would bring Draco along, despite her friends’ disapproval of having a sticky child underfoot.
’ He shoved Jackson out of the cell. ‘Come along, Snape! Young Malfoy failed the Dark Lord, just like his father and mother had, and like them, he must pay. Don’t be stupid and try to do something for him –
His friends were worried, he could tell. Pansy would look at him askance, making little casual comments about his schoolwork and the horrid bags under his eyes. It took most of Draco’s self-restraint not to snarl at her, mostly because he knew Zabini would skewer him for making Pansy cry.
Goyle emerged from the kitchen. ‘Good morning, lads. I didn’t know you stayed over, Harry. Do you want some breakfast? Where’s Draco? Oh, shit, I mean –’
‘And you think you haven’t learned enough about over the past few months?’ Malfoy asks sharply. ‘We study together in the common room almost every day. We talk every day. And we still have our weekly dinners. You still feel you hardly know me? Like I’m not truly your friend?’
Harry has brought Draco this pain—and he would be the one to take it away. He came back from death—even if he still doesn’t remember how—because of Draco,
Draco looks up, eyes narrowed. ‘We can’t Apparate in the Forest or in Hogwarts,’ he says in a tone that patently expresses how stupid he finds Harry.
He is pacing the length of the kitchen at Number 13 Grimmauld Place. Harry watches him, feeling a little guilty, because he used to think what the gossip magazines write is quite true. He thought that Malfoy was releasing his omega pheromones around him on purpose too, because the tosser smells inviting to Harry all the time, of warm treacle pudding and baking bread and fresh linen. He smells like home, and Harry is disconcerted to know that Neville, who is also alpha, smells nothing around Malfoy.
The man shrieks, thrashing beneath Draco’s claws. Draco yanks—skin tears—bones crack—and he is staring at a raw pulsing heart, blood spraying in all directions. The man is gurgling, awful wet sounds. Draco snaps his beak around that beating heart, and tears it out of the chest. The man stops moving, the sound of his thumping feet dying away. Dead—he's dead.
The body in his arm convulses, and abruptly, Draco feels Harry again: his soul, his being, his entirety flooding his senses. The warmth of his skin, the headiness of his melting-caramel scent, the light of his joy—Harry is pressing against him, arms around his neck, face angled upwards. ‘Draco,’ he says his name like a kiss, gentle against Draco’s face. ‘Draco, I came back.’
is done. It was done four years ago when you took me out of Hell. I had to save myself, and I did – as you have rescued
. He thought he would need to guard himself against Harry Potter’s animosity. The boy was scared of him, and Draco knows that scared people are the most vicious. It would be no trouble at all for the Boy Who Lived to disparage a Malfoy these days, to turn the class against Draco.
Draco burst into wild laughter and Harry pulled him back in again and he was drinking in the honey-sweet sunshine that was his lover’s joy.
‘Hullo,’ he says with a terse nod. ‘You look well.’ He turns away abruptly, addressing the shopkeeper. ‘Yes, we would like the standard set of robes for Harry, please.’
‘But you persisted, and you brought us here,’ the old wizard replies. ‘You have done very well – do not forget that. Come. Sirius is in Madam Pomfrey’s hands now. There is nothing else we can do here. Let us have dinner in Hogsmeade – you can meet my brother.’
‘Don’t be silly,’ he says dismissively. ‘Mother knows you’re my good friend. You’re important to the Malfoys. Besides, it’s much more useful to have it protect you than locked up in a vault. Oh! Perhaps I should ask Mother about the other things we have—they would be useful to you two as well,’ he says to Neville and Ron, who looks alarmed at the thought of wearing precious necklaces.
‘The old knick-knacks we have lying around the manor,’ Draco explains. ‘Where should we go? The Ravenclaw common room?’
But Harry cannot be some weakling that needs saving when he must kill the Dark Lord one day. He wakes up some nights, thrashing, feeling desperately useless, with no idea how he is going to save his family and friends from Voldemort.
Malfoy looks paler than ever, his face reddened where Harry held him. He raises his chin, his gaze grey and flinty as steel. ‘I’m sorry you had to suffer through sleeping with me last year.’
Now, Draco stands here with his mate’s blood on his hands, faced with the brutal certainty that he is about to lose the most precious thing he has: Harry’s friendship. He has forced the consummation of their bond with that kiss. A consummation Harry has no knowledge of.
‘Would you?’ Harry brightens up, looking from him to Moony, who is wearing a slightly aggrieved expression.
omega, and that's why we're here, aren't we? Oh, come on, shall we move this along? I don't feel safe in these parts—why the bloody hell did you choose
’s why you did all those things. Ruddy lies, I see that now. I’m sorry, I’m sorry I came here, all right?’
The first moment is the scent of hearty beef stew bubbling in the pot, and the sizzle of fish cakes frying in the pan, and the anticipation of bread baking in the oven. Malfoy is sitting there across the table, his blonde hair falling in his face, as he bends over double laughing at something Harry has said. The firelight dances across his face, and his grey eyes are luminous with a genuine joy that pierces through Harry’s chest bright as
Draco considered carefully. There were ways to tell the absolute truth and yet tell him nothing. The privilege of being able to root around in Potter’s head was too tantalising to give up. Reluctantly, he agreed. Potter beamed and Draco’s heart tugged. Impulsively, he gave him a peck on the cheek.
Before Potter could say anything else, Draco turned to Weasley and began talking to him about the case. Weasley acquiesced with relief.
There was nothing more wretched than being in love with a person who could never endeavour to care for you in the slightest.
knew now. How humiliating for Draco and subsequently satisfying for his former enemies to know how low he had sunk. Being under Potty and Weasel’s protection would mean spending time with them, and Granger too, no doubt.
be a bit obnoxious sometimes … but I think the two of you would get along really. You would have so much fun arguing with someone who’s finally on the same level as you.’
‘No, and that’s the problem. Neither of them sees what’s happening. Surely Dumbledore knows about this—he watches them at school. Why hasn’t he done anything?’
Harry wants to laugh. The day has taken on that sort of surreal absurdity that makes him think he has stumbled into a nightmare. He stares at Draco standing, defiant and sulky, in front of him. He looks down, and his eyes lands, dumbfounded, on the vial in his hand. The unicorn poo glows with incandescent glitter.
Outside the mullioned windows clouded with dirt, the foot traffic dropped away to nothing as the evening wore on. Even though the Aurors had caught the last Death Eaters a little over two months ago, people were still wary of the darkness. It would take more than the six months since the war ended for Wizarding Britain to truly recover.
Draco frowned at him, unsure what this had to do with Harry. “No. Healer Mitra wouldn’t tell me, which is very unethical of him. I have a right to know, as a patient.”
They are in Diagon Alley with Sirius and Minnie to get Harry’s school supplies, his Hogwarts letter tucked safely in his pocket. It seems like the rest of wizarding Britain has the same idea. Harassed parents are herding overly excited children along, often failing to rein them in. The street is lined on both sides by many shops with marvellously magical windows. Harry’s eyes are jumping from shop front to shop front, as he gawps in awe at everything.
Draco stepped into the living room, a dark, shuttered room that smelled of old socks and damp clothes. He flicked his wand, lighting the lamps. He sat down gingerly in one of the two dusty armchairs huddled around a small, filthy fireplace. Theo was clearly a poor housekeeper.
He thinks. He must marry to carry on the Malfoy line: an omega to bear his child, because alphas cannot mate with any other sex. When that time comes, will Draco finally look at him? He cannot imagine so far into the future.
‘Maybe it’ll be good for you to explore yourself as well, Harry,’ Sirius chimes in. ‘We know it’s hard for you to reveal your gender, but … maybe to one person. Someone you trust. That could be good for you.’
, and looked away from his face. His alarm had made him sound more scornful than he had meant. “You? Selfish? Saint Potty?”
Potter’s head snapped up and Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. Potter’s eyes were blazing with raw volatile rage, searing as dragon’s breath. It was the same dark creature Draco had glimpsed in Madam Malkin’s when Narcissa had brought up Sirius Black – the same dangerous creature that promised violence and Draco had stupidly provoked it.
I have to attend those dratted Slug Club meetings now,’ Zabini grimaced. ‘Rubbing shoulders with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs … Ravenclaws aren’t too bad at least, when they’re not going off tangent on some abstract concept.’
He made a face, but nodded. She searched his face carefully, and apparently satisfied by what she had seen, went on.
, those broad shoulders, and narrow waist – precisely the way Draco liked his men. Potter was all the more attractive with his utter lack of awareness of his own looks.
‘Of course,’ he adds with a snort, ‘once I knew you like blokes too … it was a forgone conclusion. I think I’ve always wanted you … your attention. Even if I couldn’t have
Draco shrugged, setting down his trunk with a flick of his wand and hating himself for liking the warm, welcoming feel of the house so far.
, they claimed, is the only testament to healing. On the contrary, Harry thinks it detrimental to healing to dwell on it for too long.
Mrs Parkinson’s daughter, Pansy, who is the same age Draco, sits across from him, her eyes glazed over, as she jabs at the half-eaten pastry on her plate. She is a pasty, snub-nosed little brat, who gave Draco a bored look she must have practised for hours in front of a mirror to exact its most dramatic effect. He is intrigued, because she is the first person he has ever met who is eight like him. Adults he has met so far are so dull; they are always falling over themselves fawning over him – S
Clutching the false Horcrux in his hand, Harry stares at Dumbledore’s dead body, and starts to shiver. Who protects them from Voldemort now?
‘Who are you trying to curse, Malfoy? Who was the necklace for?’ Potter strode forward, stabbing his wand into Draco’s chest.
Draco can’t remember when he first realised he is different from his parents, but the truth is impossible to avoid when it stares him in the face whenever he looks in a mirror. Yes, he is pale and blond and thin like his parents, but their skin doesn’t have that odd, unnatural glow like his; their teeth aren’t sharp and jagged like his; and their embraces don’t break bones.
Draco’s head snapped up. Potter had already turned away from him. Over his shoulder, Draco saw that Weasley and Granger were looking uneasy.
Dumbledore blinked, and smiled in assent. ‘I believe he has been weakened when he tried to kill you, but yes, I do think he is in hiding and in some form or another, very much alive.’
She tried getting both of them to tell her what was wrong to no avail. Zabini was a master at redirecting the flow of conversation and Pansy was far too weak against him to convince him otherwise. Draco was tight-lipped and nothing Pansy said or threatened to do could get him to say anything.
‘Harry,’ Neville whispers, and Draco Malfoy’s eyes jump to Neville, narrowing into vicious slits. ‘Who are
Harry is sorely tempted to yell. Instead, he takes a deep breath. Draco has been nothing but cordial; when their friends corner him, he insists he is all right, that there is nothing wrong, that he isn’t angry at Harry. ‘You must have done
‘Although it’s a bit much, innit, to have two couples in our dorm, now that Dean has given in to Seamus,’ Ron remarks to Neville.
Shrugging off Myrtle’s questions, ignoring her completely, Draco pushed through her out of the toilet stall, scarcely noticing the cold. He left Myrtle behind, composing a letter to Borgin in his head, the spectre’s chill deep and spreading within him.
you’re up to something. You didn’t need to stay here to watch me fly for hours,’ Potter pointed out. ‘Why did you?’
His voice comes out hoarse, his throat sore from shrieking in unbearable rage. ‘I cannot be here anymore. I want to—go … maybe … the forest.’
Weasley had said he and Potter would take shifts watching after Draco, but Draco had only seen him for one afternoon the entire week. It was mostly Potter.
But home for Harry has always been a person, and he doesn’t know how to return to him. Harry is a shattered sword and broken spear; what does he have to offer his mate that doesn’t bring bloodshed and tears?
They were silent for a long time after. Harry rubbed Draco’s back comfortingly. Draco lay back down, exhausted by the story. Harry lay back down with him, face to face. He held onto Draco’s hands, rubbing his thumbs over his.
‘I doubt it would have made much of a difference,’ Father retorts dryly. ‘Don’t you remember how much he pined for Lily Potter? I have always suspected she is the reason Dumbledore has accepted Snape so closely into his fold, even though he was a Death Eater.’
Potter rolled his eyes. “Well, at least he left traces of that Angel’s Trumpet Draught he used. We’ve sent it to the Investigation Department, and they should come back with an analysis by the end of the week. That should give us clues.”
,’ he said furiously to Harry. ‘Because they can’t bear to hurt me, and they know I would never betray you.’
‘He’s a blood traitor,’ Draco said automatically. ‘And he’s an easy target. Do you see the way he turns red when he’s angry?’
Harry shudders. He looks from Minnie to Moony, but they are helpless in making the decision for him.
The front of his face elongates, hardens, sharpens into the head of a raptor with an iron-grey beak. His hands transform into claws, cruel, blade-sharp. His body contorts, bending under the weight of his mighty wings.
Harry agonises over what he should do. Oh, how he wishes Lizzy or Hermione were here to advise him! Does he tell Jane that Bingley is in London? However, the knowledge is of no advantage to Jane. Shall he call upon Bingley then? He could discreetly enquire after the gentleman’s abrupt departure, but he fears that Jane might think poorly of him for sneaking behind her back. He does not want his sister to think him a traitor! After all, how does he know she
Fear slams into Eltanin: icy water rushing through his chest, hollowed out. He slackens, knees weakening, as he meets his mother's eyes, wide and afraid.
Harry bursts into laughter, and as he throws his head back, Draco leans in. He presses his lips against Harry’s, and their first kiss is the taste of starlight on a cold night with trees whispering their secrets to an infinite sky.
‘Bloody likely!’ Zabini snarled. ‘I was coming up the stairs when I saw Potter rush down, beet red and hair worse than usual. He looked like a boy who just had a long snogging session. I go into the classroom, wondering whom Potter is shacking up with, and whom do I find?
He staggers backwards, startled by her sudden embrace. He is blushing, although he wraps his arms around her obligingly.
Moony warned him to be careful, because Neville is alpha after all. ‘When you get older,’ he said. But Harry doesn’t believe Neville would ever hurt him, even after only a few meetings. The brown-haired boy was awed and grateful, when Harry promised to teach him how to fly. ‘Great Uncle Algie dropped me out of a window once, so I always find heights a bit difficult,’ he confessed, shame-faced. Harry thinks he doesn’t like Neville’s grandmother much either, if she allows such things to happen.
‘Well, yes, I’m late,’ Draco stated flatly. ‘I’ll be going then. Good-bye.’ He swivelled around, but Filch’s hand landed hard on his shoulder.
‘Ugh, of course not, you berk,’ Ron screwed up his face. ‘What are you lot doing here then? Drinks not ‘til eight at the Leaky.’
go and get herself Petrified, when they very much need her brains for this bloody stupid rescue operation, although he reckons she might have approved bringing Lockhart along, sans their threats to tarnish his reputation.
‘That’s going to be trouble, won’t it?’ Zabini asks exultingly. ‘Potter has Quidditch, and isn’t he rather good at Potions? How are your grades?’—barely passing, and that’s with Hermione and Harry’s help—‘Not very good, I see. What do you do when you’re alone then?’
Their week at Grimmauld Place passes enjoyably: Harry taking Draco into the Muggle shops and explaining the quite remarkable inventions they have to make up for their lack of magic. Mealtimes are noisy affairs, between Sirius’s endless repository of stories about working with Muggles and Harry and Draco’s chatter about school. It is very easy after all, for Draco to adjust to Sirius and Moony’s casual household.
The silence is awkward now. Draco looks around the pub helplessly, searching for something to talk about. It isn’t as if they don’t have anything in common. Morgana, it takes only a few conversations to realise that they have similar interests and tastes and sense of humour. But Potter seems determined to be difficult tonight.
‘Yes. Our Dark Lord has entrusted me with a great responsibility,’ Draco said, the words bitter as wormwood. ‘What that is, is of course something
Luc rolled his eyes and stepped back. ‘Take the spell off.’ Harry took the spell off sheepishly. ‘It’s illegal to put a Tracking Charm on a citizen without proper cause for suspicion – and you’re off duty at the moment, you have no rights to put the spell on me. But it’s all right, Potter,’ Luc held up a hand to forestall Harry’s protests, ‘I’ll let this slide. Just stay away from me. I don’t care for your smarmy, faux do-gooder principles. By the way …’ he leaned in close, close enough for Harry to smell the scone on his breath.
‘Do not exert yourself on my behalf,’ she retorts. ‘You are abysmal with a sword, brother – we must at least agree on the fact that
He watches the anger surge across Potter’s pallid face, the fists clench and the muscle tauten. Potter takes a threatening step towards Draco, stinking of death and rot.
Nott and Millie made a strange couple, a pairing of physical opposites: Nott who had fair hair the indistinct colour between blonde and brown, and was tall and thin with hunched shoulders like a slender question mark; and Millie who was built like a barrel and had four older brothers to teach her how to wrestle.
Harry raises his hands, presses his fingers feather-light against Draco’s chest. Draco shudders, pleasure sparking across his skin. Harry reaches out a hand, hovering over Draco’s beak, and hesitates, a question on his face. Draco closes his eyes, knowing he is well and thoroughly conquered by this improbable man. He dips his head and Harry presses his palm to Draco’s ice-cold beak.
Eltanin whines, quivering with a desire he is barely able to comprehend, digging his fingers into the back of the other man's tunic, pressing his body closer. He feels delirious, heat pooling in his belly, his groin stirring. He lowers his head, lips brushing the omega's neck, and is about to

‘I’ve learnt in the past three months that it doesn’t pay to hold back, thinking you will always have next time,’ he adds coolly. ‘We don’t always have a
Potter approached him at the end of Potions class. Weasley and Granger flanked him, faces hard with fury; their fighting had apparently been forgotten in support of Potter. Draco paused in the midst of shoving his parchment into his bag. Around them, the class fell into a hush, most of them remembering the way Harry Potter had viciously attached Draco in the Great Hall on the first day back from the holidays. Potter had been stripped of his Quidditch captaincy and given three months of detention for that.
Mrs. Bennet need not agitate herself for long, however, as Mr. Bingley, caught by Jane’s blue eyes from the first, soon asks Jane to dance with him after Harry introduces his family. Jane accepts, her smile sweet and a little surprised. Mrs. Bennet could scarcely contain her emotions, and when she finds Harry an unsatisfactory conversationalist, seeks out Mrs. Diggory. Harry is more than a little relieved.
It was a favourite nightmare of Mrs. Bennet’s that Charles and Lizzy would make a match of it, her deploring the Weasleys’ lack of fortune (‘Seven children, and their estate being so small!’) and the connection to Mrs. Molly Weasley that must be borne (there is a rivalry nursed on both sides that stemmed from their time together at Hogwarts). When Charles announced his engagement to Mr. Nicias Scamander, the second son of a prominent wizarding family from Cumbria, Mrs. Bennet was one of the first to greet the news with genuine glee.
one of the heroes of the war,’ Hermione said matter-of-factly. ‘It doesn’t look good, does it, it makes people wonder what it’s about the Aurors that drove you away.’
“What are you reading?” Potter leaned in; Draco caught a whiff of aftershave and soap, and felt the ghost of heat from Potter’s proximity on his back.
Potter turned and their eyes met. Draco was floored, his mind swept clean of everything except for the insistent thrum of longing. His heart was racing, his blood hot beneath his skin. He had to clench his fists, to force himself to stay still.
Harry waves his wand, summoning to him the teapot hovering near Jane, and pours himself another cup of tea. He resigns himself to yet another breakfast enlivened by his mother’s poorly matched sallies against his father, who reduces Mrs. Bennet to incoherent ramblings with a few choice ripostes. Harry detests watching such humiliating exchanges.
He yanks Harry in before Harry can think to say another word, and they are kissing again – this time, certain that it is entirely each other’s choice.
to die. I was a Horcrux—Voldemort doesn’t know—he probably does now, but that’s not important, I—I’m so sorry, Draco.’ His words are fervent, deeply meant.
Draco tries to take a step back, but Potter doesn’t let him. He holds Draco there in a cold dark alley, the night sky above them portentous with rain. Draco’s skin is on fire, the heat spiralling out from his arm where Potter touches him.
Thoughtlessly, even though Potter had pushed him away every time he tried touching him, Draco slipped his hand between their bodies and palmed Potter’s cock through his trousers. Potter’s reaction was astonishing. He tore away from Draco’s mouth, gasping, arching his back and pressing himself harder against Draco’s hand.
Draco is whimpering. Harry turns to him, stroking his downy feathers, wanting to comfort him. What does Draco feel across their bond? The grief that rises like black mud, pushing through the ice and snow. This must be a burden: bearing Harry’s emotions, when he doesn’t even want to face his own. Or—does he bury his feelings so he could better bear Harry’s?
Harry shrugged. ‘Yeah, I got lost because I was crying.’ He met Luc’s glare defiantly. The other wizard snorted, releasing Harry and stepping back. Harry rubbed the back of his neck where the edge of a pot had jabbed him. Luc was scowling. Zabini and Goyle hovered in the background.
‘Why didn’t you write?’ Draco asks plainly. ‘Just a “I am well” once a year would have sufficed. I wouldn’t have asked you for anything more. I … understand why you left, but … I
He shakes out his right sleeve, and a wand slips out into his palm. Without another word, he begins waving his wand at random at the surrounding shelves, causing narrow, flat boxes to come flying out. Harry looks nervously at his guardians. They smile at him reassuringly, Sirius giving him an enthusiastic thumbs-up.
like to stay at the manor, we could do that too. You wouldn’t like to leave your mother alone, of course. I’m sorry, I—’ The embarrassment thickens.
Madam Malkin clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ‘Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own any more,’ she straightened up, pushing pins along Draco’s right shoulder, ‘it’s nothing to do with being a child –’
Neville makes a face. ‘I don’t know, I don’t think about that. Isn’t it too early for any of us to thinking about marriage?’
‘Hmmm …’ Potter nuzzled the underside of Draco’s chin with his nose. ‘Godric, Ron will kill me for this, but I’d rather give you a blowjob than go for practice.’ Draco’s cock twitched in interest. ‘The team’s a mess and … I’m terrible at being captain.’
There is a knock on his room door. ‘Harry,’ Draco calls through the door. ‘You all right with Chinese take-out for dinner?’
Potter’s eyes – bright and shining in the darkness – dropped to Draco’s lips and abruptly, perceptibly,
Harry jumps, Draco tightening his arms around him. His godfather surges to his feet, and flings a hand out towards them, a wild humourless laugh reeling from his lips. ‘
So Harry zips through the air, his blood singing with exhilaration, despite the pinpricks of shame needling into him. It’s when he is flying, the world flat and green and grey and brown beneath him, the wind cold and harsh around him – that’s when he thinks he really might have magic. That Dumbledore didn’t make a mistake.
ing the plates, forks and spoons while Luc sent them back into their proper drawers and cabinets. They worked in silence, but it felt natural. Harry could hear Luc’s steady breathing, and for some reason, that soothed him.
He began pacing, as he always did when he was anxious. ‘Bell touched the bloody thing and she began flying in mid-air and screaming and for fuck’s sake,
!’ He grabs Draco’s hand. ‘Draco, he’s got Sirius! He’s got Sirius! We have to go—we need to save him—he’s got

‘Thanks for looking out for me, Potter,’ Draco says with a light smile. ‘Come on, let’s get you that drink.’
Harry had also seen Hermione and Neville twirl around the ballroom, her bushy hair fanning out as she threw her head back to laugh at what he said. They looked so buoyantly happy that even Ron could summon nothing more than a half-hearted wistfulness, especially since Kate from the shop had gone over to ask him for a dance. He gave Harry a cheeky grin and wave when he caught Harry looking.
As he talked, Draco refilled their glasses with the Refilling Charm. Gradually, they found themselves gravitating towards each other in the middle of the sofa, eyes darkened, and sated with very good wine. Draco had turned towards Harry, his face pressed against his arm on the top of the sofa. Harry was gazing at him, his words so soft at points Draco had to lean in closer to hear.
Draco shuddered. Even the sound of Harry’s voice was magic to him, stirring the longing in his chest. With a squawk – something he would
Jonas, who was trailing a hand up and down Draco’s chest, paused. ‘You not know?’ he asked, surprised. ‘But you are why I give the Dark Lord the – the – how you say – the words.’
‘I don’t … I don’t think I can take it up the arse yet,’ Potter said in a quiet voice and Draco was floored, because this meant that Potter had actually considered being fucked and allowing Draco to fuck him.
Draco blinked away the tears that kept springing to his eyes. After nearly eight months trapped in the dungeons, the soft glow of flickering candles in the drawing room seared against his eyes. His father had dragged him out of his cell, exclaiming that they had captured Harry Potter and it was all over, they were back in the Dark Lord’s favour, and wasn’t it marvellous, Draco, they were their lord’s favoured servants again!
Potter surged to his feet, his wand pointed at Draco’s chest. Draco took a step back, clutching his wand.
He entered the Room of Hidden Things, feeling the invisible weight settle around his neck again. He manoeuvred through the leaning towers of broken things and came to the Cabinet. It loomed out of the greyness, squatting amidst heaps of unwanted things.
‘I would thank you, Moody, not to volunteer to put my son in danger, when the adults were too weak to stop You-Know-Who the first time round,’ Remus replies, a growl starting at the back of his throat. Sirius has to put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down.
The ancient wizard’s face was abruptly twisted with regret. ‘Ah … that perhaps would be Voldemort’s lasting legacy: the taint of Slytherin House. Did you know … before Voldemort, there wasn’t such a definitive divide between the Houses? In fact, most of the times, Slytherins and Gryffindors made fast friends. No … no, in fact, House did not matter. We were … one. One Hogwarts.’
Harry stares, and blushes. ‘Sorry,’ he blurts. ‘I—I didn’t know that you—you were thinking of it. I … I didn’t know.’
Potter was crushing his hand. ‘Malfoy, we’ll save them, all right? I’ll tell Dumbledore and we’ll think of a way to save your family. You don’t have to serve Voldemort. You can come with me.’
But Harry loathes the suppressant potion more than anything else he must suffer in Snape’s presence. It makes him feel weak, the energy draining from his limbs. It is bad enough that the strongest manifestation of his magic is his ability to fly, but he does not show the spontaneous spurts of magic he knows from his books that children his age should be playing with. The day after he took the potion for the first time, he could not even get the broom off the ground, and Sirius had to hold him for hours before he calmed down.
Draco hadn’t realised Harry had stopped speaking until Harry reached up to run a finger down Draco’s jaw. Draco shivered under his light touch. For once, he welcomed the heat thrumming through his blood. For once, he gave in, pliant to the longing ignited by Harry’s touch.
Draco finds that it is very easy, after all, to be a Veela when people see him for what he is and yet, do not flee. His fingers slide along Harry’s palm and curls around his hand, fingertips resting on the back of the other boy’s hand. The other boy’s hand is warm and clammy. He knows that Harry feels the tug too—somewhere close to the heart—from the way his green eyes widen.
might react that holds him back. Will Draco think him a traitor – an omega lurking around him – for keeping it a secret for so long?
Draco stared at him, looked at his face, remembered what almost happened a few nights ago. He heard himself speaking, the words garbled as mermaid song above land. ‘I want you.’
The witch leads them to the back. Harry hears Sirius mutter a curse beneath his breath, and Moony’s subsequent hushing. The blonde couple has seen them as well, their faces looking as if they have smelled something foul. The man turns away, murmuring something to the blonde child still on the pedestal, but the woman steps forwards, blocking her family from view.

‘Frankly, I thought it made things a lot easier, knowing whom I’m meant for. I’ve had a lot less trouble than
His parents gaze at him, concerned and befuddled. He knows that they want to help him, but they are at an utter loss
"You hate me, of course," Potter says with a flash of hurt. "I destroyed your kingdom. I knew Voldemort has taken your throne. I thought—I thought to return it to you, to march into your city victorious and to place the crown on your head where it belongs. I thought that would earn me your love. But … war never turns out the way we plan it."
Harry demurs that he has been exhorted in any way, and puts it instead to his observations and logical deductions. From the way Jane looks at him, he suspects that his older sister has formed the same inferences about Darcy. Vexed by her siblings’ contrariness, Lizzy turns the conversation to the letter she has received from Mrs. Maeve Fancourt, her particular friend from Hogwarts, who has been attempting to lure her to visit Derbyshire, where she now lives with her husband.
The prophecy of Harry and Voldemort is an open secret now. ‘But this works in our bleeding favour!’ Moody exclaims. ‘The boy has the power to defeat the Dark Lord—power the Dark Lord knows not—we only need to clear the way for him to do it.’
by the people around them. It doesn’t make sense—does his father not go out for numerous meetings with this and that committee? Are owls not arriving with dinner and party invites every other day? Pansy has made a mistake, calling his family odd. He isn’t so sure he is so eager to make her acquaintance now.
Draco saw? Impossible; there weren’t any aesthetically pleasing changes to his appearance. He still had that sharp-featured, pointy-chinned face that he had to admit resembled a ferret’s. His hair was still white-blond, and his eyes the same fog-grey as his father’s.
Harry sits down hard on the cold stone floor, the sound of crumpling paper causing him to look down. His homework is balled up in his fist, ripped and singed in places. He stares at it blankly. Something hard and jagged is lodged in his chest, and he can’t breathe. Every gasp he sucks in tastes of ash and salt. In the silence, he can hear the rapid drumming of his heart and Moony’s murmurs echoing through the house.
Draco stares at him, feeling as if there isn’t enough air in the room. Above them, a neighbour is yelling at her brat for spilling Coke on the sofa. Outside the window, traffic trundles past, a ceaseless background noise.
He knows now what it means to be omega: to be omega is to be weak. That is why they must hide it from Voldemort and his followers. Minnie and the rest will deny it, but he knows it. He understands why Dumbledore wants him to hide it: it is a flaw their enemies won’t hesitate to exploit. Harry has learned as much in his readings—even if he doesn’t understand much of the dense text—that sometimes, people will pound at the cracks to destroy anything to get what they want.
A muscle worked in Potter’s jaw. He held Draco’s face tighter. ‘Fine, let’s do it your way. Let’s barter. I answer one of your questions – any question you can think of – and you’ll answer one of mine. And you must give me the absolute truth.’ His eyes were sombre and unyielding.
Harry doesn’t know what to think. The adults have warned him to be careful, that this secret will be too much for his friends. Everyone knows what omegas are like: pitiable creatures leeching off others, good for nothing but to be married off to alphas and have children. It doesn’t matter that Harry knows he is as capable as any beta, when the world has decided this is how omegas must be. He tightens his grip on his elbows, holding himself closer together.
Harry misses the rest of what Neville says. His wand flares with heat, and there is a crack in the air. The Malfoys, blond, thin and regal, Apparates onto the platform a few metres away from them. He grabs his wand, its heat unfurling in his palm, his heart jumping when he sees the blond boy. He meets cold, grey eyes, and clenches his jaw. The other boy is staring at him with darkest loathing.
Dumbledore shakes the ash from his robes, and hesitates, peering at Minnie, who is watching him with narrowed eyes and pursed lips. Harry, who has been on the receiving end of that expression too many times, winces on Dumbledore’s behalf. Sirius and Moony exchange looks, and Sirius breaks the tensed silence by asking Dumbledore take a seat and grab a plate.
‘A little more curious than your standard Ollivander’s visit,’ Moony says, a hand on Harry’s head. ‘But don’t mind what he said, Harry. You have a good wand, and that’s what matters.’
He scowls, thinking of Adam, his boyfriend of three weeks. He agreed to go out with the Ravenclaw seventh year, because he has dark hair and Draco realises he likes dark-haired blokes. But if he is going to whinge that Draco is spending too much time with his friends—there’s homework and DA sessions, for Merlin’s sake—Draco will have to break up with him.
Why should he have spoken up for the wretched man? He could not – and still cannot – account for it. He saw Malfoy’s name in the list of imprisoned Knights they printed in the
‘Oh, come on, admit it – you think they’re hilarious, even if they are pranking us,’ Zabini said. ‘They are bloody brilliant bastards. They would make fantastic Slytherins, don’t you think?’
He hears the loud footsteps thrashing through fallen leaves, accompanied by vehement cursing, and straightens up, his hand tightening on his wand. The man, who emerges from the bushes, squinting and holding a hand up to the
‘You-Know-Who hasn’t made it much of a secret that he is after Harry,’ Moony points out, accepting the platter from Dobby. ‘Thank you, Dobby.’
They are lying in Harry’s new bed, the window open to the sky filled with that pitch darkness of a night too late or a day too early. There is a garden out there; Draco smells the earthy soothing herbs in the air and on Harry’s body. His head is tucked beneath Harry’s chin, the other man’s arms wrapped tight around him.
Then the pain seared through his flesh with red-hot claws. He screamed, back arching, body twisting. His skin bubbled, and burst with blood and thick yellow-green pus. Ashwinder eggs were exploding and igniting every inch of his skin.
‘Zabini suggested that I might make recompense by asking you to dance with me,’ he finally says. ‘It appears that I must tell him to propose another method, for it seems that I am not only a poor dancer, but a deficient conversationalist as well.’
But Harry looks at Draco now, Draco’s fingers wrapped around his hand; aware of the heat growing between their palms; aware that the glass ball has shattered and his feelings are strewn at his feet, unknowable as the land slumbering beneath them.
‘Fred tells me that omegas in heat will be gagging for it,’ Ron says, eyes wide with salacious delight. ‘Sounds like a good thing to me.’ He remembers belatedly that Sirius is omega, and looks to Harry guiltily, but Harry is talking to a fourth-year on his other side.
He looks at Harry with those piercing, blue eyes, and nods calmly. ‘Wait for me. I will be there in a minute.’
Draco staggers only because he is caught off-guard, and returns Ron’s hug in bemusement. The commotion brings Fred and George out of their room next door, and soon, everyone in the Burrow is piling into the room, shouting greetings and questions at Draco, who tries to answer everyone all at once. Ginny comes too, giving Harry an amused glance, as if to say,
“Prick,” Potter muttered. “I’m opening my house up to you here, you might be a little more appreciative.”
Potter struck him, a backhand that caught Draco’s jaw and sent him sprawling over the floor. His ears were ringing, his jaw numb. He tried to get up, but Potter climbed onto him, pinning him to the ground. Draco scrabbled for his wand. Potter flung it aside, using a knee to hold Draco’s right arm down.
Between them, Goyle and Crabbe hauled the luggage up onto the racks, Crabbe scowling at Draco. Crabbe had a none-too-subtle crush on Pans, and despite knowing that Draco was gay, he didn’t like how Pans clung to Draco. Not that Crabbe stood a chance in hell with her.
Harry was the least surprised by his friends’ engagement. He witnessed for himself the light their romance has brought to their lives in those dark, desperate days four years ago. He watches contentedly the tender way with which his childhood friend addresses his pregnant wife. He is glad for their company in Longbourn. When Harry left the Aurors, they have chosen to remain with the Corps, and Harry does not see them but for a scant few times a year. They have now returned for Hermione to give birth to their first child amongst family and friends.
Draco refused to cry, especially with Potter watching them, but when Andromeda embraced him, the tears came out anyway. He was angry and embarrassed, and excused himself to the toilet. When he returned, Andromeda and Potter pretended they hadn’t noticed his reddened eyes and nose.
Somehow, Harry finds himself agreeing to lunch with Zabini after the meeting. They go to the pub nearby, continuing their discussion over fish and chips about the benefits of using mallowsweet in skin solutions.
The door bursts open, Potter barging in with his wand raised. His eyes are wide behind his glasses, darting rapidly around the tiny storeroom before fixing on Draco.
Draco doubled up, a painful sob rising from his chest. He pressed his fists into his hot eyes. He wouldn’t cry. He couldn’t. He
Rage burst into Draco’s chest, raking its claws on his insides and setting him aflame. He clenched his fists, biting down hard on his bottom lip to stop from screaming. The lights in the room shattered, glass tinkering to the ground. Jonas stirred, but didn’t wake.
‘You’re only half-dead. There, do you see the red thread? It’s still connecting you to the living world,’ Regulus pinches something between his forefinger and thumb, and raises it to eye-level; if Harry squints, he sees it, a red fading line tied around his wrist and stretching out back along the beach. ‘It’s usually gold, but yours is red. Red indicates the thread of destiny. You are soul-bonded?’
Three, his wand feels like it is on fire, and he grabs it to take it out, biting back his gasp of pain. The wood flames against his palm, the heat shooting up his arm and settling within his chest. It feels like a Niffler’s Fancy has bloomed within him, gleaming like burnished copper and infinitely rare. He stares at the blond boy in the mirror, his heartbeat roaring in his ears.
Regulus stares, astonished, and then exclaims in joy, reaching out to grab Harry by the shoulders. ‘Which year do you come from? Has the Dark Lord been vanquished? Did Kreacher manage to destroy the locket?’
‘Oh, no. Terry’s fancied Lee for ages,’ Luna informed him, taking the empty seat next to him, a crystal goblet of fizzing Dragonfire brandy in her hand.
Ron was the first of them to crack. He told Harry that it was as simple as waking up on a Tuesday morning and realising that the war was over. He marched into Head Auror Robards’ office and resigned from the Auror Office that very morning.
Snape was raising his wand. He pointed it directly at Dumbledore’s chest. Draco wanted to close his eyes, to forget this world. Potter was here somewhere. Was he going to do something? How could this end in any other way? Draco’s mind was cold and white as starlight.
it is, imaging the wetness around his leaking cock. A second finger, a third fits in easily, Harry writhing beneath his ministrations.
Draco clenches his fists, fingernails digging into his palms. It has become stronger throughout the night: the darkness dragging Harry further and further away, blooming like morbid flowers in Harry’s soul. Draco feels its roots take and spread, reaching across their soul-bond.
‘Mrs. Bennet is correct,’ Hermione says, her eyes following their former schoolmates around the room. ‘They must know that we live here. It is a simple matter of inventing a dying aunt or uncle to defer their friends’ invitation to Netherfield. This forces me to conclude quite naturally that they are in Hertfordshire for a purpose.’
‘I’m sorry,’ he mumbles, sweating beneath his clothes. ‘I’m sorry, I won’t do it again. I’m really sorry. Please—please don’t send me back. Please.’
The Dark Lord’s face contorted briefly in demented rage. Draco felt the fear deep in his bones, the primeval desperation to flee.
Lizzy is unable to keep herself from responding to this. She turns her head around sharply, and says with some heat, ‘I am perfectly pleased that
Harry already has Voldemort to deal with; he doesn’t need a bloody competition that puts kids in life-threatening situations. There was also the Death Eaters that appeared at the end of the Quidditch World Cup: tents trampled under panicked feet, coloured lurid green by
Minnie inhales sharply. She stands before him, a towering, silent figure. He keeps his eyes to the ground, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling. His eyes are burning, but he mustn’t blink, mustn’t cry.
Draco’s tone is light and breezy, his penetrating grey eyes fleeting across Harry’s face. He knows Harry would immediately want to know who
‘You can’t do this to me,’ he mumbles, voice muffled by his palms. ‘Not even if you are the prince. Please—just go.’
do not care what Darcy has to say either!’ Lizzy cries, bristling with scorn. ‘I am displeased with the prideful manner in which he thinks he has the privilege to regard the rest of the world, only because he was born rich and handsome! He has done nothing to earn that pride.’
He made a face. ‘What’s there to like or dislike? Being an Auror is work, and work is work, do you get what I mean? I don’t
‘Harry,’ Draco says again, and he is slipping off the armchair, kneeling down by Harry’s legs. ‘Harry.’
‘Harry,’ Draco says again, sounding irritated now. ‘Don’t be stubborn,’ he adds, grabbing Harry’s upper arm over the bedcovers.
Yaxley snarled wordlessly, fingers flexing to wrap around Snape’s scrawny neck, but Severus Snape was a character such that even mindless thugs like Yaxley knew to fear. Snape wasn’t the kind to let a grudge go; he let it fester and he turned it into poison.
Harry realises with a start that the tall, pale man standing in the middle of the narrow hallways, face serious and devoid of all other characteristics, is a stranger. He looks like Malfoy, and bears the name Malfoy, but he is so far removed from the boy Harry knows, Harry cannot help but entertain the fleeting thought that there might Polyjuice Potion involved here. He finds himself agreeing to Malfoy’s request, and when Lizzy asks afterwards what Malfoy might hope to achieve with a visit, Harry is at a loss to provide a satisfactory answer.
‘Smell?’ Father echoes, his brows furrowed, before his creased forehead smoothens when he realises what Draco means.
They are sitting in a large round tunnel, at the foot of an impassable wall of scree and blocky stones. Everything, including themselves, is covered in a thick layer of grey rock dust. Draco tries to think, ignores the throbbing in his head, pulling himself back from the cliff edge of dizziness. They are in the secret tunnels that run beneath Hogwarts, searching for the Basilisk before it—
Draco laughed, light and giddy. ‘Merlin’s balls, Potter, you bloody hell want it. Why in the name of Circe’s pigs have you been pushing me away?’
Potter looked up at him from his wineglass, and smiled. It was a slow, bashful smile that made Draco want to squish his face between his hands and drag him in for a kiss.
‘He isn’t a coward,’ Potter said snappishly. ‘And I really wish you’d stop insulting my friends like that. I don’t go around saying Crabbe and Goyle are morons, Parkinson is a hag and Zabini always looks like he has a stick up his arse.’
“I was thinking … I don’t particularly feel like cooking tonight. I’m thinking of heading over to visit my godson.”
Draco felt a prick of unease. Arthur Weasley was, after all, the man who capably led the raid on Malfoy Manor, the one who even Lucius Malfoy was grudgingly wary of. Father didn’t regard Weasley as a genuine threat, of course, but still …
‘I’m afraid our conversation does not interest the children,’ Mother says to the other ladies, nodding at Draco and Pansy with a benevolent smile. ‘Rose, what do you say to Pansy taking Draco on a tour of your lovely gardens? I think there would be enough there to entertain the children and keep them out of our hair.’
The other boy gives him a look of sympathy. ‘You know she’s not upset with you. It’s only … it has been a while since the group of us were together, hasn’t it?’
Harry was pressing his fist into his mouth, stifling the desperate sobs. His face was hot with tears. He didn’t think that he would live in a world without Malfoy and so hadn’t made an effort to care for it. Luc was right to call him a selfish prick.
Lizzy studies his features closely. ‘You are a loving brother, Mr. Darcy. I cannot fault you for any supposed overreaction on behalf of a beloved sister, as well I should know with the number of siblings I have.’
Harry acquiesces with a smile. ‘However, it is refreshing to venture outside of familiar circles every now and then, I do find.’
what does he expect from the boy who wanted to shake Draco’s hand despite Draco having only shown all signs of loathing from the start?
‘Yes, this is what an alpha with a broken bond is reduced to,’ the dark-haired man snarls. ‘You see how I am shunned by the other Veelas—not only because of my foul stench, but because … I am bad luck.’
He had not known how fastidious Potter was with his cooking, almost too anxious that his friends should be honest with their opinions of his skills.
s of the doors slamming shut by magic and the screech of wheels against the track. He waves at them furiously through the window, as the train starts moving. Harry is sticking his head out of the window, yelling his goodbyes at his godfathers, who are jogging alongside the train, waving to him. Neville shouts his promises to write his grandmother.
wand to the Dark Lord’s—it is not the same as the one the Dark Lord wielded. It is a powerful wand, and will aid you greatly in the difficult path that must lie ahead of you.’ Ollivander reverently replaces the wand in its box. ‘I fear I may never find a suitable owner for this one … All right, go on, try the other wand.’
Draco nods, unable to tear any more attention away from Harry groaning in his arms. Snape is crouched over them, the tip of his wand pressed against Harry’s temple, murmuring spells under his breath. Behind them, Hermione is sniffling.
Their bond breaks as it must by distance, when they go home for the holidays, but it is a gradual collapse, because Draco has time to say goodbye, assured that they would see each other in a few months. Never like this: stabbed by the shards of awareness that Harry has been taken somewhere very far away. He staggers to his feet, barely conscious of his friends looking round at him in concern. Hermione is grabbing his arm, saying something, but he cannot make sense of the words.
Draco stood in the doorway of his childhood home and stared at the creature that had taken it over. The monster that wanted to take over the rest of the wizarding world. Lord Voldemort stared at him with cold, pitiless red eyes.
Draco snatches up his wand from the bedside table, and flicks it. The dried blood disappears, and Harry’s skin, dark, smooth and luminous in the soft glow of the light spilling in from the hallway. Merlin, Harry is truly lying on his bed, half-naked, sprawled across Draco’s favourite burgundy bedspread. He raises himself on one elbow, an eyebrow raised.

—Mother said everybody thought you didn’t really exist!’ Pansy sniggers, her face more pug-like than ever. ‘Blaise was so jealous to hear that I would be meeting you first, and Daphne says she will force her mother to have tea with your mother so she could meet you.’
Harry blinks. ‘I don’t see any other way to treat you.’ He says it in such an offhanded manner that contrasts dramatically with its effect on Draco, whose heart starts racing again.
Before he came to live with Minnie, he had only the vaguest understanding that there is something different about him: Aunt Petunia had once commented on the unnaturalness of his
‘I … I didn’t think you would welcome my letters,’ Harry says, aghast, a hollow pit opening in his chest. ‘Merlin, if I had known—Draco, it’s not—I wasn’t rejecting you. I have never rejected you. You are my soulmate, and I—I am yours entirely. You didn’t—you didn’t think I rejected you, did you?’
His fingernails are digging into his palms. His mind is the same inky darkness of the night-time forest surrounding them. He is desperately casting around, but what does he say to the man he tried to forget?
What happened to no personal questions? Draco looked at Potter’s face – honest, open, hopeful – and knew he would not be able to walk away from this conversation. Especially since he

‘I’m his Head of House and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,’ Snape said brusquely. ‘Follow me, Draco.’
Potter’s eyes were fixed on Draco’s face, his mouth fallen open. Draco made a show of looking at Potter’s lips, flicked his eyes back up and slowly licked his own lips, even though he was feeling far from amorous at the moment. Potter was visibly repulsed; he jerked away, looking as if he had been punched in the face.
The Bennets are dining with the Phillips in Meryton, when they make the acquaintance of an officer by the name of Wickham, a new officer in Colonel Forster’s regiment. With his distinguished looks and bearing, and pleasing manners, he has captured most of the attention and admiration in the room. Harry is little surprised when Lydia imprudently insinuates herself with the captain, but he
He has also been made Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, which considerably warms him to the idea of going back to school.
He had their full attention now. Potter’s gaze piercing and suspicious. Weasley looking blandly curious. Granger’s slightly narrowed eyes and annoyingly aware expression.
He wakes in the night, vaguely aware of a presence, and opens his eyes to see Draco looming over him in the darkness. ‘So, you’ve decided to date Ginny while I was gone, have you?’ the blond asks coldly, and pulls off the blankets.
,’ Ron said doubtfully, after he and Harry made up, and Hermione dispatched him to talk to Draco. ‘I’ve never seen Draco so … weird.’
He touched his face and body frantically. There didn’t seem to be anything wrong with him. So why did he react so viscerally to Potter’s presence? Because it was
Harry cuts him off, barrelling on. ‘You shouldn’t be apologising. What the bloody hell are you saying sorry for? I’m the one who should be sorry—sorry that I’m not stronger. If only I could have shut Voldemort out—or if I have gone that night too. Maybe I was supposed to kill him then. I could have stopped it.’
He clings to her, terribly human all at once, soft and weak and breakable. Falling apart: first, his wretched face, then his body pointlessly strong when he no longer has a mate to protect, and last of all, his heart raw and weeping. He collapses in his mother’s arms—a doll tossed aside, unwanted, and shattered beyond
could ever marry a Muggle. ‘It is not so much our differences in culture and understanding of the world. It is, after all, no fault of their own that their world is so drab and colourless,’ she said, smiling, as she gazes down at the velvety darkness of the slumbering land beneath them. ‘I would hesitate to fall in love with any Muggle based on the poor understanding that we would have of each other’s characters. Only love borne of deepest mutual respect and trust could move me into matrimony – and how could there be genuine respect when a witch must hide such a crucial part of herself from her partner?’
“Yes, I’m sorry,” Healer Mitra did look contrite, thick black eyebrows furrowed. “It was the only way to save you.”
Malfoy’s face is white. ‘I see that I have been fooled into thinking that you could have had changed your opinion of me. I am still a coward and a bully. You do not truly think me capable of changing. Yes, I see that now. I must apologise for squandering your goodwill and kindness – they were indeed, wasted on
, their bodies together, but standing like this, half-crouched over Harry on the window seat, it’s impossible. He rolls them onto the ground, the cushions scattering around them. Harry laughs breathlessly, as he lands beneath Draco with Draco’s arms on either side of his head. Draco sees him by the grey light of the cloudy night, eyes momentarily invisible behind opaque glasses, lips kiss-bruised and dark hair unruly. His best friend shifts his head, and their eyes meet.
Malfoy’s desire to be elsewhere cannot be more palpable in this moment. Harry is acutely conscious of his own growing disquiet – as well as his culpability in banishing the ease and cheer with which they have previously interacted. He studies the other wizard, who is still and silent as a statue carved by starlight, and admits to himself now how he has missed – and craved – Malfoy's company at parties.
’s presence that roused him. Draco licked his dry lips, and swallowed hard, trying hard not to think about how Potter’s touch had sent his heart racing.
‘Pathetic,’ he said, tossing his head at Yaxley dismissively before striding out of the room. Yaxley continued to hurl insults and curses at his back. The other Death Eaters didn’t intervene, merely stared as Draco walked away, having won the fight.
Draco gave him a knowing look. ‘Right. Sure, Potter. That’s why you stayed to watch me wank that one time. Were you hard? Did you go back to bed and wank with your little Gryffindor friends sleeping around you? It turns you on – wanking to a filthy Slytherin, to
Draco hasn’t said a word after his laughing fit, only followed him into the kitchen, accepting the cup of tea. The lines of his beauty are softened in the warm yellow lights, surrounded by pink, froufrou curtains and cushions Harry hasn’t had time to replace. No longer marble, but pale smooth skin that would redden easily under Harry’s hands, pink lips wet and plush begging to be kissed, and half-lidded grey eyes darkened by desire and knowing—
The shopkeeper crows triumphantly, clapping his hands in almost obscene glee. ‘I am right after all! I knew it—Veela hair is the wand core for you. You responded fairly well to the other wands with cores from Fae creatures, after all, and I thought perhaps … Veela, eh?’
Dumbledore merely blinks those clear blue eyes at him, and gestures to the Floo powder bag. ‘Shall we?’
An underfed owl landed in front of Draco, a water-stained letter clamped in its dull yellow beak. Draco blinked, trying to focus his sleep-deprived vision. The owl dropped the letter on the table, hooting angrily. Goyle tossed it a bit of bacon and appeased, the owl winged away.
‘I don’t know,’ Neville frowns. ‘I’ve not … felt that he is, like how I feel it around you. I assumed he is beta.’
Thus, dispatched by Zabini, Harry crosses the room. Uncomfortably cognizant of the attention he is drawing, he bows to Malfoy and asks for the next dance. The blonde gentleman gazes at him, his expression impassive, and agrees. They take their places on the dance floor across from each other. Harry keeps his eyes on Malfoy, not wishing to look at his family for fear of their scrutiny.
They had to, because in the end, Crabbe squealed, when the Aurors promised protection for him and his family—something Dumbledore arranged. And the truth is out: Lord Voldemort has returned. Dumbledore very quickly summons what remains of the original Order of the Phoenix: he has been planning this for a while.
The space between his shoulder blades itches, the ache in his bones now the yearning of wings to be set free.
Harry is warm and soft against Draco’s lips. He gasps, and Draco slips his tongue in, a hand on the back of Harry’s head, deepening the kiss. Draco feels Harry shudder, feels Harry’s hold on his arms tighten. When Draco presses his tongue against Harry’s, Harry pushes back, his tongue hot and wet, his breath puffing against Draco’s lips. Draco cups Harry’s face, pulling back for a breath.
"I apologise that this is not quite the gardens we first met in," Eltanin says with a mocking gesture at the scraggly brown patch. "Did you manage to get your tour of the greenhouses?"
‘Do you mean,’ Snape spoke with chilling derision, ‘that I have done all this for nothing? I only wanted to keep Lily’s child alive. But you are telling me he must die for the Dark Lord to perish.’
The jeans were form-fitting, hugging Potter’s butt perfectly. As Potter waved a wand at a pot or leaned forward to chop up an ingredient, Draco’s eyes followed him.
He is relieved that they are able to have such desultory conversations, that his greatest responsibility for now is to choose a winning Quidditch team. He looks down at the parchment, running his thumb over the scrawled names. He must savour these moments while he can—like his time with Draco.
—and the helpless anxiety watching Harry lurch from danger to danger in the Triwizard Tournament coil within him, like an Ashwinder serpent smouldering in dead fires. Red sparks burst into the sky above the dark hedges of the Third Task, the connection between Harry and him shatters, and the Ashwinder in his chest flames.
A shiver rippled through the circle of watching Death Eaters. Aunt Bellatrix’s bone-white face shone out of the darkness, lit by her fervour and fury; she had laughed and clapped and begged her master to inflict greater pain on Lucius during the torture. Beside her, Narcissa Malfoy had stood silent and tight-lipped as an Easter Island moai, her features carved in bedrock by ancient Polynesian wizards.
The teakettle trilled, and Potter prepared the tea in silence. The loudest thing between them was the occasional clink of the cups being set on saucers as they drank their tea. Draco was staring at the stained table top.
He was staggered by what he was seeing. Knockturn Alley hadn’t ever been particularly salubrious, what with the dark twisty street, display windows of Dark artefacts and nasty patrons. In the year Harry hadn’t been here, the street had gone completely to hell.
His parents will be devastated. He tries again, beating his wings, straining with his arms, but it is so heavy, too heavy.
Well, heroes would promise anything to make themselves legends. And Harry Potter has always wanted to make a martyr out of himself, to carry every mistake and every agony by himself. Has he ever seen Draco as a soulmate, a helpmate, or
Bingley is of course, terribly apologetic and guilty for being so easily persuaded. He would write countless letters professing the strength of his feelings for Jane and his hopes for their shared future, despite the fact that he calls on the Bennets nearly every day since his return to Hertfordshire. He brings along Darcy – much to Lizzy’s displeasure. The other man does nothing, but sit in the corner, glowering darkly. It is far worse behaviour than the previous time he was in Hertfordshire. When
Harry freezes, and then launches himself across the room to the fireplace. Draco fists the back of his shirt to keep him from falling into the fire. Harry is openly weeping, the darkness in his mind melting away, the pitch dripping stickily.
Draco turned away and walked down the corridor, Potter’s monster having ripped open his chest and taken his heart, raw and bleeding. He had been haunted by the sight of Potter’s face in that breath of a second: a monster made of darkness hiding within shadows. There was only the suggestion of it, an impression.
It didn’t matter that he had gone willingly into Jonas’ arms. It was that the Dark Lord believed Draco was
They leave Neville at the top of the tower, staring after them with abject horror. As Draco starts winging downwards, their friend has already disappeared down the stairs. Harry tightens his arms around Draco’s neck, his face pressed against Draco’s shoulder. His body is tensed and trembling in Draco’s arms; how much smaller he seems when Draco is in this form, how delicate and breakable.
. Come on. What are you, scared?’ Without waiting for an answer, he whirls around and continues pushing his way through the shrubs on a path Harry cannot see. He hasn’t brought his wand: apparently, the moonlight is bright enough for his Veela eyes.
has evaporated for Harry from the moment he saw the memory Dumbledore left him. Dumbledore was talking to Snape, the only person who could know that Harry must die without feeling the need to do anything to change it. ‘It’s the connection between them that evoked my suspicion,’ the old professor explained, sitting across his desk from Snape. ‘Harry already has a soulmate, and even if Voldemort has one, surely the creation of Horcruxes would have ripped it to shreds. And Harry’s Parseltongue—a distinctly Slytherin ability, and he is not a descendent, far as I can trace his family line. I can only conclude that it is
Lupin turns, his face grey and hard. ‘Harry, go get Dumbledore. Use the Floo,’ he snaps, the command clear in his voice.
The precarious stacks stretched out far as the eye could see, a mountain range of trash. There had to be a window (and a wall) somewhere – Draco could taste the teeth-achingly cold night air and hear the random call of a bird – but standing where he was, he couldn’t see it.
The evening altogether passes off pleasantly for the Bennets. Mrs. Bennet sees her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Whatever tarnish the Slytherins’ presence gives is swept away by Mr. Bingley
Draco fucked Jonas every night over the next two weeks. The German was a wanton cockslut and often, it only took a few thrusts from Draco before he came, wailing and writhing.
’s offices. After that, Professor McGonagall was determined to have every single Slytherin – alumni and present students – attend the Ball. She’s been running Parkinson ragged with the invitations.’
mate. Draco cannot understand how Voldemort could exert this unnatural, evil influence, but it doesn’t matter; he must kill him now not only to avenge everyone who has suffered, but also to eradicate a creature he recognises as a rival on a primal level. Harry is his, and can only ever belong to him—that is what his nature demands.
‘Oh,’ Harry looks at him, perturbed. ‘Does that mean if you have a soulmate, it’ll be another Veela?’
Draco remembered the last night of the Triwizard Tournament, when Potter came stumbling out of the maze, white-faced, clutching Cedric Diggory’s dead body. Potter had looked small and broken out there in the middle of the Quidditch pitch before Dumbledore and the others closed around him.
Dumbledore stood no chance against Minnie, when she was on such a rampage. You would obey her, even if you don’t understand how you have come to do it. That was how Harry learned why Voldemort killed his parents.
The article read: “A certain redheaded Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies was spotted at Mulligan’s this weekend. The fiery little witch danced and canoodled the night away with an up-and-coming handsome Seeker from the Appleby Arrows. Note, dear readers, that the Seeker was definitely
Harry loops an arm around Draco’s shoulders, and drags him behind the headstone, Draco screaming when movement rakes red-hot pain between his shoulder blades. Harry drops him into the grave dirt, falls onto his knees beside him, his face pale and dirt-streaked above Draco’s. Draco struggles to breathe with lungs wrapped in iron bands. The pain burrows beneath his skin, crackling with hell fire, and he cannot think beyond one breath and the next.
It has always suited him to keep to the sides of the room, coming forth to take a dance only when goaded by his sisters and friends. He sees now how Malfoy’s presence has in a peculiar way altered everything: how he looks forward to parties now in anticipation of meeting the gentleman; how he is more likely to dance twice with Malfoy and to stand up with him for the rest of the night; how he has schemed to have a place next to Malfoy at dinner tables so that he would naturally monopolise the other wizard’s attention.
Harry opens his legs willingly, revealing his entrance, wet with arousal. This reminds Draco that he must be careful; he cannot get Harry pregnant during their first time.
While the Order struggles to find legitimate ways to bring Death Eaters to justice, the Death Eaters have no qualms about attacking members in the shadows. It is wretched to hear about the duels Pads and Moony have barely managed to win, while Harry is stuck here in Hogwarts, waiting and waiting for the moment to come.
No … he wouldn’t. No one would think Lord Voldemort would seriously take a sixteen-year-old for a Death Eater; that was the beauty of his plan, the Dark Lord had claimed. Dumbledore’s downfall would come from the people he would never expect: his beloved students.
Two, the blonde kid is a boy: the most beautiful boy Harry has ever seen, so pretty it’s ridiculous, and Harry has to rub his eyes behind his glasses, because the boy seems to be
Jackson’s footsteps: a rapid clicking against the stones, accompanied by the urgent murmur of his clothes brushing against each other.
It is three days later, after Minnie takes him flying and they are sitting down to lunch, that Harry feels just that bit lighter than he has since Sirius got hurt. Madam Pomfrey has managed to patch Sirius up all right without taking him to the wizarding hospital, St. Mungo’s, so he is resting at home for now, as Moony told Minnie and Harry over Floo last night. Moony looked so gaunt and pale, but he managed a smile for Harry. So when Minnie asks him if he might like to hear what happened to his godfather, Harry thinks that he must be strong like Moony, and he nods.
They pause, minds catching up with their impatient bodies. Harry reaches up, loosening Draco’s braid, and cards his fingers through Draco’s hair. ‘Have you … had sex with any of your exes?’ he asks, not quite meeting Draco’s eyes.
He has done his best to keep his other form from his friends, to pretend like he is human—even though he runs faster, hits harder and has to be so much more careful than the rest of them. But there is nothing else to be done: what is the point of his abilities if he is too embarrassed to use them to help Harry?
‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ Draco retorted immediately. ‘It will never be a burden being your son – both of you.’
, Blaise persuaded Slughorn of my redemption. I do not mean to appear before you so, Bennet – it would most certainly be ill-advised after Hertfordshire. If you will excuse me –’
He only let his Shield drop when he was out of earshot. He slumped against the wall, his arm trembling. A headache was pulsing at the back of his head. Merlin, the Shield had taken more out of him than he liked to admit.
‘Like sex?’ Draco asks baldly. ‘You can’t get pregnant by betas, that should be safe—it’s easier, isn’t it? No worry about unwanted pregnancies.’
This is basically an extended version of the fic I originally posted. I changed the ending, and added in tons of more chapters that cover all their years at Hogwarts. I've been working on this since forever, and it somehow turned into this monstrosity of 60k words! I'm glad that it's finally
‘Why did they want to disown you?’ Draco asked, remembering his grandparents only as a croaking disapproving voice through a scarlet-red Howler sent when he was five.
His sisters contribute more to the Bennet coffers than Harry himself. When he broached the possibility of him teaching at Hogwarts, Mrs. Bennet was mortified that he would give up being a gentleman for employment and was effusive in her pleas for him to stay. Jane would not hear of it, and Lizzy merely rolled her eyes.
Zabini was frowning at Draco now. He folded his arms across his chest, looking exceedingly unhappy. ‘And you think
‘Do you think you could carry us out?’ Harry asks, gesturing to the still form of Ginny. ‘She’s fine, I think. Riddle didn’t manage to suck all her life out.’
’s latest travesty of an article. He goes for flights in the Forbidden Forest sometimes; he’s alone then, because he doesn’t like Harry to see his other form, and it’s dangerous for humans in the Forest.
Harry looked at the pair of them and was abruptly breathless with the fury that choked him. His chest was hot and tight, the rage that he had kept screwed up tightly crashing through him, eradicating decency and reason. Why the fuck had these two worthless shitheads survived when Malfoy –
‘I wasn’t attacking an Auror; I was stopping the creepy bloke who had been following me for the past half an hour,’ Luc said through gritted teeth. Standing at half a head shorter than Harry, Luc glared up at him, his body taut with tension.
Minnie brought him to tea with the Longbottoms a few times—more in recent months, because she said he needed to get used to other children. Harry likes Neville, who is kind and eager-to-please. His timidity mostly stems from a lifetime of overbearing aunts and uncles. It only takes finding the right topic with Neville, like plants or secret attics, for the other boy to brighten up and burst into enthusiastic conversation.
even after he had told him he was going to kill Dumbledore. He couldn’t decide who was more insane – Potter for even wanting him or he for actually telling
‘What is your purpose here, Malfoy?’ He interrupts Lizzy’s description of the gardens of an estate not too far from Netherfield open on occasion to visitors.
And Draco is coming. He gasps, burying his face into Harry’s hair, and whispers: ‘I love you. I love you. I love you so much.’
Harry smiles at him, that warm, familiar smile that has always taken in everything that Draco is. He touches Draco’s face gently, his heart beating a tattoo Draco matches.
Unease stirred in Draco’s chest. He looked to the Dark Lord’s left, where Snape sat, nodding at something Rowle was saying. Snape met Draco’s eyes and acknowledged him with a slight nod. Draco nodded back and returned his attention to his potatoes, wishing dinner would just end and he could go back to his room.
There was the impression of sudden movement – an ankle appeared and disappeared. The doorknob twisted, the door opened, the door slammed shut, and Potter was gone.
Draco remembered the red slit eyes, cold and cruel as a snake’s, the high thin voice commanding an execution, a
Alcohol had ignited the heady rush of possibility and hope, like Felix Felicis in every mouthful of wine. He was so comfortable and so happy that he could no sooner turn off the Veela charm that was working on Potter than figure out how he turned it on in the first place.
. As a Veela, Draco’s instinct is to protect Potter and he knows that Potter is safest away from him. Harry Potter is too good, too bloody brilliant for a pathetic worm like Draco. He cannot be tainted by the likes of a Malfoy; Draco won’t allow it. He
Draco’s mouth opened, but he couldn’t breathe, the air driven out of his lungs at the thought of this boy – this vital, wonderful, maddening creature – standing in front of him,
He stares across the breakfast table at them, wondering what it means to be a Veela. How can it be that he looks just like them, but he can’t do what any of what they do so naturally? Should he be carved onto that door full of monsters? He runs his tongue over his pointed teeth, his fists clenched on his lap.
Draco made it a habit to check the Map for Potter every once in a while, whenever he was taking a break from the Cabinet. In the first two days since Draco had become the new owner of the Marauder’s Map, he watched as Potter dithered all over the castle. He had overheard Potter hiss, ‘He must have
The Sorting Ceremony begins. Hermione and Neville are Sorted into Gryffindor, although the Sorting Hat took rather a while for both of them. When it comes to Draco’s turn, instead of putting the Hat on, he asks McGonagall if he might go last.
Potter’s eyes flash and he steps closer. Draco pushes himself back but he is already against the door and there is nowhere else to run. His heart is thrumming in his chest, his blood rushing in his veins.
Ron and Neville give him identical looks of revulsion. ‘No, thanks!’ Ron says empathetically. ‘No offence, mate. Nothing against you, I just don’t go for blokes. And besides, didn’t I tell you? I’m seeing Lavender,’ he says to Draco.
is in the room, he is prone to ignoring her presence entirely – a development the girl delights in making fun of, by passing before his eyes deliberately and repeatedly. None of the family – save for Jane – does anything to stop her, for they are deservedly indignant at Darcy’s disdain for their family.
