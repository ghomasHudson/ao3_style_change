“Har,” Draco said as Harkin walked to the door, and she undid all of her spells before opening the door and storming out.
“Good, I’m adopting him since his father is in Azkaban as well.” Narcissa said as she walked towards the door. “Sleep well, both of you.” she finished before walking out the door.
“Her most famous artifact would be her lost diadem. No one alive has seen it.”
“Then why did you hate me so much?”
“Yeah, fine. I’m just confused.”
Draco woke up in his bed with his sheets pulled up around him, and he looked around the room to find it empty. He tried to sit up, but he felt a pain in his entire body. He grunted out in pain as he tried to get out of bed so he could go and find Harry. He stopped as the door burst open and his mother was at his side trying to get him back in bed. “My dragon, calm down. You are fine, you just have to heal. Everything is fine, my dragon.” Narcissa said.
Harry twisted in Malfoy’s arms, and stared up at him for they weren’t the same height now. “Malfoy…” was all she could say before Malfoy kissed her gently and briefly on the lips before pulling away.
“Theo is alright; I don’t blame him for anything that happened to me.” Harkin stated.
“No, I am, but since we weren’t having sex three weeks ago that shouldn’t be possible. Time for answers, Uncle Sev.”
Ever since that day, Draco has tried to get Harry’s eyes to do the same exact thing again but have been unsuccessful, until today. Draco smiled at the light that twinkled through Harry’s eyes, and the two boys looked over at Narcissa. She just nodded her head, and Draco pulled Harry off towards his bedroom. The two boys had a joining rooms, and they found Harry’s trunk and owl in his room. Draco pulled Harry over to his bed and the two plopped down on the bed next to each other.
“To see Ron and Hermione finally see that they love each other and to stop dancing around each other.” Harry said as he pushed memories of Ron and Hermione together laughing and the tree of them having fun together; them fighting side by side in all of the messes that they have gotten themselves into. Every moment that mattered to Harry about his friends.
“How would they even gotten in?” Draco whispered.
“Whoa, hey let’s not get carried away now, love.” Draco stated as he turned and stared down at her.
The next fear comes to light and Harry is sitting by the lake next to Sirius with all the Dementors attacking them both. Harry can feel as the fear and coldness that comes with the Dementors washes over him. The sadness is slowly draining him and he can’t produce a Patronus. He can’t find his wand. The screaming, his mother’s screaming is all he can hear it’s endless. Why hasn’t he passed out yet?
“I was only gone for a half hour maybe. The poor baby.” Harkin laughed.
“Yes, that boy definitely has a one track mind most of the time.” Harkin chuckled, and she sat down at the only place setting at the table. “So how does this work. I’ve never actually been to a fancy diner. My relatives didn’t exactly care to take me out places. They probably wouldn’t have sent me to school if people wouldn’t have asked when I was starting school.” Harkin stated. My life before the wizarding world involved knowing how to cook, clean, weed the garden, and make sure I didn’t do anything freaky.” Harkin laughed. “My life has been filled with obstacles, and I’ve been trying to keep my head down, but I just keep finding things that were worth fighting for.” Harkin trailed off.
“Yeah, no you don’t. Pregnancy sucks. The after math not as much. The constant vomiting and having to use the loo.” Harkin stated.
“Yes, eventually.” Draco walked into the hospital wing, and Harry pulled the invisibility cloak off of them and pushed it inside Draco’s back pocket. Harry trusted him that much; that he would put the cloak in Draco’s pocket and not his own. Draco set Harry down on the bed and walked over to Madam Pomfrey’s office at the end of the wing. “Madam Pomfrey?” Draco asked as he knocked on the door.
“Mum,” Draco whispered as he woke up.
Harry thought as he willed the screaming to stop. But her voice just repeated over and over again with flashes of green light. Harry curled up in the fetal position and covered his ears hoping the screams would stop, but they were in his head, and they were everywhere. And that was when it dawned on Harry, he was in his head that’s why the screaming repeated. He focused on his magic, he didn’t need a wand to cast his Patronus because he was in his own head, and he focused his magic on creating a Patronus, and his stag burst forth in front of his eyes.
“It is going to be a long break, isn’t it?”
“Why are you being so nice to Harry now?” Hermione asked.
“I was afraid you wouldn’t want me anymore, be-because of the potion that changed me into this. Be-because I’m now a girl.”
“Harry, do you like rough sex?” Draco asked as he smirked.
“Yes, but I also like the soft, gentle sex like we’re having right now, that’s my favorite. It makes me feel like they actually care about me, and not about my status.” Harry stated and then he turned away from Draco. Draco pulled out of Harry, and turned him around.
“Yes, dragon, of course he does. Just not the same way he did when we were first married. I’ve changed over the years as has your father, just from the mire circumstances we have been through. After my seventh year, Lucius pulled away from me, which is why we married later than most in our class. Lucius was a year ahead of me in school, you remember that right?”
“You know me so well little Potter, or has my nephew claimed your virtue already?” Bellatrix said as Harkin felt arms wrap around her and a knife pressed to her throat.
“Mrs. Weasley, that hurts. Injured remember.” Harry said, and she let go.
“Yes, luckily.”
Why are you helping me?
“You know how much I hate that word. My mother was a mudblood, Draco,” Harry stated as he sneered the word mudblood. Harry paced around the room and avoided looking at Draco; Harry had been trying to brake Draco of that habit since their second year with the whole chamber of secrets thing, and it hadn’t been working because every time that Harry thought that he had Draco broken of the habit, he would go back home and be thrown back into the environment where it is used constantly. Draco tried to trap Harry against the wall, but that got him nowhere, because every time that he thought he almost had him Harry moved slightly and was out of his way again.
I am so very sorry I haven't posted in a while. I was stuck with where I wanted to go with this, and I think I have figured it out. Hopefully, anyway. I hope you like it, and I'm hoping now that I've figured out where I want to end this fic that I'll be posting a little more until it is done. Hopefully. I hope you enjoy.
“Well, I guess we should start with your treatment at the Dursley’s, shouldn’t we?” Draco asked Harkin, and she nodded. “Petunia apparently didn’t get along with her sister very well, because she definitely didn’t like Harry at all. Harry’s bedroom was a little cupboard under the stairs from the moment he came to live there to the time that Hagrid came on his eleventh birthday with his Hogwarts letter. Where she was moved into her cousin’s
When Harry woke up the next morning in Draco’s arms, he looked up at him and watched as his features started changing. He could see as Draco was waking up, like he knew that Harry was awake and his body automatically started waking him up to be with Harry. The minute Draco’s silver eyes finally fluttered open, Harry was stroking his fingers up and down Draco’s side.
“May I ask where Draco is off to?” Lucius asked, and Harkin knew that her eyes widened as the question was asked, because how does she answer that question without saying that her and Draco just fucked on the dining room table that diner was going to be served tomorrow night to all of their guests for the party. “Do I want to know where Draco is at?” Lucius changed his question, and Harkin just stood there not knowing how to answer the questions he was asking her.
“What if he doesn’t want me after everything?” Harry asked and looked down at the floor.
“Ah, my apologies. I did not realize.”
“He’ll be taken care of, Draco I promise. I’ll do it myself. We just have to get Harry out of harm’s way first, alright?” Severus said as he rushed over to the angry teen. Lucius and Severus then felt the burn of their dark marks, a signal that meant the Dark Lord wanted them at his side. “We have a problem. Narcissa, can you handle the rest of this, the Dark Lord is convening a meeting now.”
“I’ll tell you tonight, after class."
youthful, your eternal look. N
Sorry, it took so long to post this chapter. I was having a hard time moving from where I was to where I'm going with this story, but I now have a few chapters that just need editing and be posted shortly. I just hope you like where I'm going with this fic. I'm not sure how I'm exactly going to end this fic yet, but for now here's the next chapter.
“Harry, did the healer inform you what you can and can’t do, until he gives you the go.” Andromeda asked.
“Something the know-it-all doesn’t know. Amazing.” Hermione heard Draco’s muttered voice.
“You honestly think that you can do better than me at my own job, Malfoy. I’ve been doing my job since before you were born, Malfoy, before your parents even realized they were expecting you yet.”
“Harry?” Draco questioned. Draco was trying to get Harry to look at him, but Harry just kept his eyes focused on the floor. Draco was about to try and say something else when Vernon walked into the front room.
“No, I just stunned your father, who used polyjuice potion to become your mother. That look she had on her face wasn’t something she would do, it was something that your father did, and you do it to,” Harry said as he stroked Draco’s cheek. “But there is nothing in this world that would make your mother put that sneer on her face, unless your father was impersonating her. Do you understand what I’m saying Draco?”
“It’s not getting my money while I live here.” Lucius stated.
“Potter, you’re getting… all over…trouser.” Malfoy panted.
“Well, you knew of the task that Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, and Mr. Potter were tasked to do by Albus before he died.”
“It is alright, dear. I don’t blame you for anything that man made you do. I understand and the only thing that makes it better is the knowledge that you are safe now. Everything is alright.” Arthur whispered, and Harry broke down she just kept muttering I’m sorry over and over again as she cried into his shoulder. Arthur just held her there against his side as she cried, and everyone just watched as Harry released all her grief. Soon she finished crying and Harry climbed off the bed and stepped back over to Draco, and he pulled her into his side.
“Yes, turns out he’s been playing Voldemort just doing the part that Dumbledore planned for him to do. At least according to him. I’m not so certain yet, but Harry took to the story quickly.”
“No, but the rule still applies.”
Harry was arched so much that it didn’t look possible that his body could bend like that. Draco thrusted himself into Harry, and continued for a while. Slowly Harry starts to unbend and leans his forehead against Draco’s shoulder, and Draco bent his head down to capture Harry’s lips in his own, pulling Harry’s face off his shoulder and pushing his back against the shower wall. Draco was about to slip his tongue into Harry’s mouth when Harry’s cum splattered their chests, and Draco came soon after. The pair slipped down the wall of the shower and let the water wash away all the evidence of their actions. Draco leaned forward and shut the shower off and leaned back against the wall next to Harry.
“This time it was another student, who is awaiting for the results of them hopefully waking before his punishment is delivered. Not to mention his parents, who will most likely be furious with him quite like his younger sister is right now.” Severus stated, and Narcissa looked up from Draco at that.
“How are you doing, love?” Draco asked as his fingers brushed through her hair to sooth her, and she leaned into Draco’s embrace until she felt the second wave of nausea. She covered her mouth and leaned forwards to throw up again, and Draco just kept her hair back so she didn’t get anything more in her hair. When she was finished dry heaving, she leaned back against Draco’s chest, and he wrapped his arms around her waist and held her against his chest. “Better now?” Draco asked as he stroked his fingers through her hair.
“Ah, and if she doesn’t get better?”
“That is true.” Pansy responded.
“Cissy, I’m wonderful. I heard that Harry was at St. Mungos by Arthur Weasley, and he only knew because he came for a check-up.”
I was going to give it back, but I just secluded myself this summer, and I didn’t know if you wanted to see me, and I figured, once I decided that I was coming back, that I’d just give it back at school if you still needed one. Harry thought.
“Why do you suddenly want me alive? What changed?”
“I’m fine. You can go tell them I’m fine, and I’ll get ready for bed.” Harkin stated before pulling away and climbing off the bed, and she headed towards the bathroom. She stripped down and climbed in the shower.
“Fawn…” Sirius started, but Remus placed his hand on Sirius’ arm, and he shut up.
“Snivellus.”
“What? N-no, that…that isn’t what it is. I-it’s just…” Harkin whispered as she burst into light sobs, and the entire room was staring at her. No one moved until Narcissa huffed and moved around the table, and she pulled her soon to be daughter-in-law into her arms.
“Well, my guess is that the potion I had you and Harry drink worked, but there is only one way to find out.” Severus said as he stood up and walked over to the pair and pointed his wand at Harry, and Draco was about to say something when Harry grabbed his wrist to stop him, and he didn’t move. Severus cast the spell, and it hit Harry and then expanded and then contracted. “Harry is no longer a Horcrux, and now for the other test.” Severus cast another spell, and an invisible cloud formed around Harry and started to expand and when the cloud touched Draco another cloud formed around Draco and they mingled and kept expanding around them until the clouds filled the room and then they sprung back towards Harry and Draco.
“It is going to be weird having you two here and not Harry.” Neville said as he stepped forwards.
“What are you going to do with them?” Hermione asked.
“No, I just miss them, fawn. I will be alright once I go home to Remus. I will think about dinner.” Sirius said as he turned to leave.
“Draco, dragon, I was wondering if you were going to join us, and I see Harry is alright. You gave us quite a scare, sweetheart.”
“Snape, what’s going on? Why is he acting like that? For Harry of all people.” Ginny said and she turned towards Severus.
“Are you sure, because you aren’t going to get anything until lunch if you don’t. You boys should eat something, and you shouldn’t wait until lunch,” Narcissa shouted back through the door. “Can I come in and talk to you boys, because I really don’t like yelling through the door?”
“What’s so funny?” Draco asked.
Everyone was waiting for them, and as soon as Harry stepped into the room, Voldemort’s voice could be heard. “And here comes our guest of honor, the now, Miss Harry Potter. Isn’t she magnificent?” he stated and everyone turned to look at her. She could see the hungry eyes and the disgusted eyes, but she wasn’t sure which ones she preferred because they were both unsettling. Voldemort walked up to Harry and took her hand and pulled her onto the dance floor.
“I have the perfect one. Dobby.” Harkin stated and said house elf popped into existence next to her.
“Now, you don’t have to worry. Just kiss me please, so I can forget about everything that happened in my head.” Harry begged, and Draco leaned down and was inches from Harry’s lips.
“Come.” Severus instructed, and Harkin and Draco followed Severus out of the Great Hall. They went up to the fourth floor and turned towards the East Wing taking the first right and the third left, and Harkin counted the seventh door on either side before turning towards the eighth door on the left. “Unus.” Severus said at the door, and Harkin heard the faint click of the lock before reaching for the doorknob and opening the door. He opened the door and shuffled them inside before closing the door. “Unus is your password. Do not give it to anyone. Your friends can know where your room is just not the password to get inside. Understood?”
“Yeah, I always read my textbooks over and over all the way through. I’m actually second in our class to Granger, love.” Draco stated.
“I know, thank you.” Hermione said as the Weasley’s left, Ron pausing before leaving with them. “Do you know where Draco’s room is?” Hermione asked as she turned to Remus.
“You realize that people are judging you, they are just not doing it anywhere near you. Your friends are with you 100 percent but some people are still stuck in the old ways, and they think that you should be kicked out of school for getting pregnant. A few generations ago you would have been, but we are slowly evolving and that isn’t the case anymore, because you can’t become successful unless you have schooling too.” Draco explained. “Though the people who matter aren’t judging you and don’t care what others are thinking. I sure as hell don’t care. These are my children, no matter what the biological tests are saying, and I will blood adopt them as soon as they are born so they will legally be mine. Thaddeus Nott will have no say in what happens to either of these children. I will fight the Ministry if I have to, and Mother will too. We will make sure they are safe and completely ours, and ours alone.” Draco said as he kissed the side of her neck.
“I don’t think I will, not yet.”
“Where were you?” Lucius said as he stalked around his desk to stand in front of the couple, and Harkin stepped forwards and glares at Lucius.
“Mmm… you feel so good, love.” Draco moaned, and he pulled out to push back in with a gasp. Harry reached her hands up and brushed her fingers against his chest, and Draco moaned at the touch. He took her hands, and he leaned forwards, pinning her hands above her head as he continued to thrust in and out of her heat.
We’re bunking together? Harry asked.
Okay, so i have a clear winner, and though it wasn't my favorite name, I'm going with it. I don't know when I'll incorporate it into the story because I'm currently writing a couple chapters ahead right now, but it'll be within the next couple of chapters. So the results come to Harley as the clear victor with five vote ahead of the other names.
“Good point. Alright, here we go.” Hermione lifted the sword and plunged it into the cup as a ringing sound rang throughout the room. Harry covered his ears and curled into Draco’s side.
“Thank you, Melody.”
“You can talk to my mother about that because I’m not exactly sure. If you could excuse yourself Harry and I were in the middle of something,” Draco stated.
Harry arrived downstairs to find that Draco and his mother were waiting outside with the front door closed, and Harry was about to open the door and bolt out when he was yanked back into the hallway and thrown into his old cupboard; then the door shut and locked. The little flap opened and Vernon looked through. “You aren’t going anywhere, boy. I’m not losing you to some snot nose kid and his mother. I need you to stay and do as you’re told, meaning after they leave you are going to scurry off to the kitchen and make us our dinner like you do every day. Got that, boy,” Vernon scolded through the tiny little holes in the cupboard.
“I don’t blame you, Remi; I still love you, and I’m sorry about this. Imperio!” Harkin screamed, ordering Remus to run back to the ball.
“Okay, so nothing to worry about.”
“He’s up in the Hospital Wing. His last detention was brutal.”
“What did you say to him? I don’t think I have ever seen anyone talk Draco down from the verge of tantrum.” Severus said as he walked into the room.
“Mum, don’t push, okay?”
“Family doesn’t turn on each other, Harry.”
She stepped out of the bathroom, and she froze when she looked up and saw the way Draco was looking at her, and blushed. “You look phenomenal. I don’t even have words to explain how beautiful you are.” Draco whispered as he pulled her into his arms and kissed her on the lips. “And unfortunately, we have to go to this party, and I can’t just stay up here ravishing you.” he whispered against her lips.
“Snape, you do that and you might lose a hand.” Lupin said as he walked into the room. “I have another solution.” He said as he pulled a goblet out of his pocket and set it on the desk, and he grabbed Severus’ hand and slit open his palm. “Get as much blood into the goblet as you can.” Severus held his hand over the goblet and squeezed as much blood out of the wound as he could. Everyone watched as Draco’s head snapped up at the smell of blood, and Remus cast a spell over Severus’ hand and the skin knitted together. Remus picked up the goblet, and he slowly walked over to Draco and placed the goblet in front of him. Draco snatched the goblet and downed the liquid, and when he was done, he gently put the goblet down and sat on the floor next to Harry. He just laid down and curled up next to Harry’s body, and everyone watched as he fell asleep.
“Your friends were asking me questions about the day I almost killed you.” Draco whispered, and Harry nodded. Harry pulled Draco down with him as he went to lie down, and Draco didn’t fight it. They laid there as Harry drew circles on Draco’s collarbone with his finger.
“You can imitate your mum.”
“I only suspected, I wasn’t certain, and I wasn’t going to say anything until I was certain.”
“Come lay down with me, Dray.” Harry muttered half asleep, and Draco laid down on the bed next to Harry. He brushed his fingers of his free hand against Harry’s cheek.
“I’m just upset that he is still out there as well. He was always good at hiding in plain sight, but I just wish that someone would just catch him already. Him being out there scares me, for both myself and you and the twins. I don’t know what he might possibly do if he found out about them.” Theo stated as his fingers rubbed circles on the small growing bump.
“Because he’s your legal guardian now, and when you just disappeared, Father called him.” Draco stated.
“Yeah, their magic is strong. Har is fighting and pushing most of her magic to protect the baby. I think her mind and magic doesn’t realize that they’re safe.” Draco explained.
“It’s alright, Mom. I understand. You had to do what was best for me, and I understand that, but I want to make sure that you are safe, Mom. You and Harry are the two people that I care about most, and I want you to know that I want you to be safe, too, Mom. That is all that matters, is that everyone I care about is safe,” Draco whispered.
“Miss Weasley, stop interrupting me, and I am pretty sure that your relationship with Mr. Potter is over, but if you don’t want to believe that wait until we save him and have him tell you that. Can I continue trying to explain what I was saying before you so rudely interrupted so we can go about saving Mr. Potter?” Ginny fell silent, and Severus continued, “Thank you. That isn’t Mr. Potter, yes, he is still in there, just not currently the dominant party.”
“Like I said, there may be side effects from being trapped in his worst nightmares and memories. Potter has been through more than most people his age, and who knows what happened while he was at the Dursley’s.” Severus said.
Draco was having a hard time finding all of Harry’s things, he called his personal house elf. “Tally.”
“This is not good, Mr. Potter. I don’t know if I can reverse this, but I will try.” Madam Pomfrey took Harry’s hand and pulled him down to the end of the room. “Mr. Longbottom, you may go, and please let Potter’s teachers know he won’t be returning to class or showing up today.” Neville bowed his head and walked out of the hospital wing.
“Draco, is Potter the one that you were doing in the shower earlier?” Pansy asked and Harry’s head popped up, glanced over at Pansy and then at Draco, who looked up at the movement. Draco leaned his forehead against Harry’s and pulled him in for a kiss.
“I do, but I think Granger would kill me if I didn’t tell her.”
“I don’t know, but Harry is safe, and it is late, so we should head home. Hermione, dear, are you going to be staying with us at the Burrow?” Mrs. Weasley asked.
“Lucius is dead, who killed him?” Lupin stated.
“What do you mean, Draco?” Narcissa asked as she looked up at her son.
“Yes, thank you, Draco.”
“Great job, Weasley. Now you’ve upset my elf.” Draco turned back to Tally and pulled the elf into his lap, and the elf curled into the embrace. “I haven’t used another elf, Tally. You’ve done nothing wrong. Weasley was just trying to get me in trouble and he isn’t doing a very good job at it.” Draco could feel Ron’s and everyone’s eyes on his back as he tried to comfort his elf, but Draco didn’t care what people thought of him.
“Are you saying that Mr. Potter is trapped in his own mind?” McGonagall said.
“Yes, how do we get to this prophecy?” Harry asked as she faced him head on.
There was a knock on the door, and the two boys froze. Harry turned towards the door and said, “Who is it?”
“I did, but I know that will only last me a few years. I’m going to get older and not be able to do the same things I was able to when I’m younger and I won’t be able to play anymore, so what would I do then, because I would have to do something. I couldn’t just sit around home and be a stay at home mum. I would have to be doing things all the time.” Harkin said, “But I would also want to be in my kids’ lives and do things with them too, so nothing that would take me away from that.” Harkin finished.
“Miss Harry is to follow Cali to Master Lucius.” The elf said and started pulling Harry towards Lucius’ office. “Cali brought Miss Harry, Master Lucius.” The elf said as she bowed and disappeared.
“Yes, it appears it does. Do you wish me to remedy that, or do you wish to get dressed and head down to breakfast. You are eating for two now.” Draco stated.
When she woke up next, she woke up to the sound of someone apparating into the room, and she looked up to find a house elf standing at the end of the bed. “Master has sent Mipsy to clean and heal Miss Potter for him.”
“Yes, that could be an option, too.” Draco said as Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, and Draco reached down and pulled Harry’s legs back up around his waist. “You know if you would have just put your clothes on after I finished drying you off you’d be warm by now.” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear. Harry buried his face in Draco’s chest and muttered something that Draco couldn’t hear.
“Wrong, Draco. But he’s in here. Potter has some fire that I might be able to use to get what I want,” Voldemort tilted his head to the side in a manner that was really not something that Harry would do, and he smirked. “Thank you for exploiting your relationship with him to me though, Draco. Now I can use you and Potter to get to what I want and under rocks that I couldn’t before. Especially seeing as neither of you informed anyone the danger that Potter was in, and that I am now using him as a puppet for my own bidding. Vampirism suits you, Draco. A beautiful specimen.” Voldemort said as he lifted his hand and stroked Draco’s jaw with his finger. Draco’s eyes fluttered as Harry’s skin touched his own. “I feel like him don’t I, Draco? I could probably get you to kill Severus for me right now and you wouldn’t be able to see the wrong in it until afterwards.”
“Harry, who did this? Is this from what I think it is?” he looked up at Harry, and Harry saw it. Pity and concern. Harry pulled away from his grasp, and backed herself into the corner.
“Yes, Father. I’m sorry, Father, but Harry and I were just catching up and sometimes Harry doesn’t like it when people over hear what he’s saying so I thought it would be best to lock the door and put a silence charm on it so some of our nosy house elves don’t over hear what we were talking about. I’m sorry, I thought that would have been alright,” Draco apologized and he looked down at the floor in shame to convincingly pull the lie off, and Harry did the same since he didn’t know where to look without giving Draco’s lie away.
“Draco, what are you doing? Relaxing time.” Harry muttered, and Draco’s hand skid back up her body. This time Harry was the one to chuckle. “I’m kidding, Draco. Go ahead if you want to; I don’t mind.” Draco chuckled as he pulled her flush against his chest, and she felt his erection against her lower back. “How are you hard already? We just had sex like half an hour ago not even.”
“Yes, just because you’re pregnant doesn’t mean you have to get married.”
“No, I’ll be staying here. Thank you for the offer, Mrs. Weasley.”
“Yes. I’ve talked to Severus. He will take custody of you, but you will be here whenever on break from school if you leave school. He will have every say in your care even if you wish he not know. We figured this would be easier than going through the trouble of having us gain guardianship of you. This will make getting permission for your marriage easier. Though because you are both still under 17 our rules are different than those of the muggle world.”
“Harry!” Weasley shouted and Harry stirred Draco wrapped his arm tighter around Harry, and he didn’t wake.
“Professor Lupin, that’d be great.”
“There isn’t a they. It was one person, and he will be dealt with, I promise, Draco.”
“Trust me, I don’t want to see anything that you also don’t want me to see.” Severus muttered as they continued walking. As they reached the fourth floor, they run into Ron, and Harri freezes as Draco steps in front of her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?’ Harkin said as she whipped her head around to face Draco.
“Yes. There are Twenty-eight pureblood families left most women represent both the Malfoy family and the Black family. So there are more like 15 women. I would like for you to start accompanying me to these tea parties, as you would call it. The next one isn’t until after the Holidays and after you go back to school with Draco. I will talk to the Headmaster about you getting out of school for that day. Here we are.” Narcissa stated as they stepped up to a brick wall.
“Did Dumbledore tell you about it?”
“He can latch onto Harry?” Hermione said as she looked at Harry and then back at Snape. “How do we stop that?”
“Thank you.” Harkin stated. “Though I am tired and would like to get some sleep.” Harkin finished with a whisper as she turned and walked towards the door to the bedroom, and she closed the door and started towards the bathroom. Harkin slipped out of her school robes and turned on the bathtub. She turned on the bubbles as Draco walked into the bathroom.
“Yes, I admit that my relatives are horrible, but not all muggles are like my relatives, some are actually alright.”
“My hero.” Harkin whispered as Draco leaned forwards and kissed her lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, that is true, but it does make you any less beautiful.” Draco said before kissing her lips. “You just need your hair and make-up done.” Draco stated and Mipsy appeared in the room.
“You are welcome, Miss Potter. Draco keep what I told you in mind, if there is one thing I know about relationships, it is how to ruin them. Don’t push her away, not with this bond between you.” Severus stated.
“Aunt Petunia never liked me, either.” Harry whispered.
“They would do that?” Harkin questioned as Severus latched the door.
“Well, that was interesting.” Healer Johnson said as she walked into the room. “Sirius, good to see you again. Draco, want to come back with me?” she asked as she gestured towards the back room, and Draco just nodded and followed her through the door.
“Draco and Harry’s first time was last week after he saved her with that potion.”
“Yes, they were. He really got rid of them.”
Harry turned his head to the side and looked at Madam Pomfrey, and said, “Can he at least finish what he was doing?” he moaned, and he glanced at Draco and their eyes met. They stared at each other while Harry wanked under the sheets, and Draco’s finger dug into the wall behind him as he smelled Harry come closer and closer to finishing himself. He heard a moan escape from somewhere and realized it was from himself, and the pair just kept eye contact the whole time.
“Yes, polyjuice potion.”
“Yes, did you know that some of these effects were done by wizards?”
“No, not in the normal sense of the word at least. I was rarely beaten, the only time that happened was when Dudley couldn’t find some other poor kid to use as his punching bag, and that was rare once we reached nine. The rest of my abuse consisted of me living in my cupboard for as long as I can remember. It was my bedroom and punishment up until I was eleven and my Hogwarts letter came with my cupboard on there as my address. My aunt and uncle kind of freaked and moved me into Dudley’s second bedroom where they kept all his broken or unwanted things. I was starved and locked in my room when I did something wrong or use magic when I didn’t even know I was using magic. I didn’t even know that I was a wizard until Hagrid broken down the door to this little shack that my uncle thought he could out run the letters from. They didn’t want me to go to Hogwarts and learn magic. They thought that they could beat the magic out of me. Merlin, why am I just spilling all of this personal information out to you? Even Ron and Hermione don’t know some of this stuff. They know some of it because of the way that I act sometimes, but they only guess about my past.”

“Yes, you are for now, but how much longer will you be Minister, sir?” Draco questioned as he stared the Minister in the eyes, and the Minister stared right back.
Harry snuggled into his side and buried her face in his shoulder, and Harry was startled as she felt arms wrap around her and Draco. She turned to find Mrs. Weasley wrapped around them. “I think you and Draco make a lovely couple Harry. I think you balance each other out, in both appearance and personality.” She said as she stepped away from each other, and Harry stared at her. She wasn’t expected them to except Draco like that, especially not Molly.
Hermione and Ron walked towards the Fat Lady, somewhere they haven’t seen in almost a year, but know the walk to from every part of the castle by heart. They stepped up to the Fat Lady and Hermione took a deep breath before saying, “Savior.”
“Better than my little sister. Astoria was devastated when father told her the contract wouldn’t be going through. That’s the third one father has tried to negotiate for her, all of them leaving because they fell in love. She wouldn’t even come back to school because of it.”
“Someone tried to rape her, didn’t they?” Draco heard the flat sound in his voice as he couldn’t look up from the bruises all across her pale body.
Meanwhile on the seventh floor, McGonagall and the rest of the staff hurried to the Room of Requirement. When they reached the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, they found Neville standing outside it. “Mr. Longbottom, we are here to help. Mr. Potter has taken a turn for the worst, and we must find this Diadem immediately.” McGonagall said as Neville paced three times past the wall, and a door appeared. Neville escorted them into the room, and they weaved through the stacks until they came across Hermione.
“Bloody hell!” Draco screamed, and he closed the distance between their lips. He lifted her up, giving him better access to her lips and neck, and her fingernails dug into his shoulders. “We really should get ready and head downstairs. You have a healer appointment.” Draco whispered against her lips as his thumb brushed back and forth across her stomach.
“We’ll cross that bridge if it comes up. Which brings me to another topic, Theo will be staying with us since his father will be going to Azkaban, eventually. This won’t be a problem will it?”
“Shit,” Harry whispered under her breath, and then she heard footsteps coming towards her and she realized she forgot her invisibility cloak. She pulled out her wand as she backed into one of the nooks next to the library and she held her breath.
“I need to talk to Severus. Have you ever heard of or been to Grimmauld Place before?”
“Where are we going?” Harry questioned.
“Morning, Dray. Did you pack my trunk already?”
“Har-Har-Harry. Please, can-can you mo-move? I ne-need you to mo-move, please,” Draco stuttered, and Harry pulled out and pushed back in and stopped his movement again. Draco screamed as Harry made this movement, and he whimpered after Harry seized movement again. “Harry, what are you doing? Please?!” Draco begged but Harry stayed still. “Harry, please. Baby, move. Move, now!” Harry pulled his face away from Draco’s ear and looked him in the eyes.
“I don’t like you assumption, Mr. Malfoy.”
“It’s alright, Lucius. The real question is what are we going to do? The Dark Lord is going to use her to his advantage, and possibly against the Order. If he has Harry Potter, the tables have turned on us. Harry can get the Prophecy, and the Dark Lord can convince her to get it for him.”
The rest of the meal went by rather quietly as everyone just talked small talk. Harkin stayed quiet for most of the rest of the meal, and when everyone was finished with dessert, Lucius escorted everyone to one of the many drawing rooms for drinks. They were all laughing by the end of the night, and Harkin was watching as her worlds merged together. She stood up and ran from the room, and everyone stopped and looked up at her after she ran.
“I will, now go. We’ll be fine.” Harry gave her Teddy, and then he gave her a hug and kissed Teddy on top of the head.
“I agree with Siri, cub.” Remus said as he walked around the table to Harkin as well. “You are not a freak, cub. You were a wizard, and now with your circumstances, a witch. Part of the magical community, and yes, your circumstances are unique, but that does not mean you are a freak. This is coming from a werewolf, cub. Siri and I will be there for you. You are our family, cub.” Remus stated, and Harkin had tears streaming down her face and smiled at the two older men. She slipped out of their reach to pull her arms up and wrap them around, pulling them closer together.
Harry watched as Malfoy left the room, and he wondered why he felt like he should apologize to him, but Harry could feel Hermione’s eyes examining him. “What is it, Mione?”
“Has that been there this whole time?” Draco asked with and arched eyebrow.
“No, my father cares so much more about blood purity, than he does about his only son’s happiness. My father would rather end the Malfoy line than have our blood purity be tainted.”
“Yes, but that is not why I am here. I would like for you to send for Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, while I go and fetch Draco. We have to have a nice little chat about the future of Harry Potter.” Severus walked out of the room and down to the dungeons where he found Draco asleep on the couch in front of the fireplace. Severus shook the boy awake and as his eyes fluttered open and landed on Severus, he sat upright.
“What’s going on, Gin?” Harkin asked as she glanced at her brother practically hiding behind her, and Ginny laughed a little at the look.
She was just about to turn down the hallway to go to potions when she felt a hand in hers and someone pull her in the opposite direction. She ended up pinned against the wall in the small alcove outside Snape’s storeroom. She was about to pull her wand out when her hands were pinned to her side and then dragged across the cold stone above her head. She felt the scraps across her skin, and she was about to scream when a mouth was attached to hers.
“A family issue that I need to inform you about.” Draco stated as he glanced form Dumbledore to Harry and back.
“Because you judge people, Ronald.” Harry said as she pushed her plate away and walked out of the Great Hall. Harry could feel everyone’s eyes on her as she walked out, but she didn’t care. She walked out of the Entrance Hall and straight down to the dungeons to potions. She was early but she was trying to do better in her classes anyway, and potions was the big one.
“I don’t want to think about it.” Draco whispered. “I don’t want to think about you like…that.” Draco stuttered.
“Draco, you can find him. You can find Harry, Draco. If there is any part of Harry left in his mind, you can track him. We might be able to have an advantage if the Dark Lord doesn’t know about the bond you have with Harry. Focus on your feelings and memories of Harry. Put all of your energy into him.”
“Can I come through? I just…I just need to get away from Draco for a while, and maybe teach him a lesson. Can I come through, I just need to talk to someone who isn’t a Malfoy. I know that they are just trying to help, but I just need to be away from them.” Harkin stated, and she could see Remus understood.
“If? You said he was good if these spells were cast.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Harry just laid her head against Draco’s shoulder and closed her eyes. Harry felt as Draco’s arms wrapped around her and his one hand slid down her abdomen and between her legs.
“No, not that. He would have known how to react to my outburst, but you were calm and collected, and Ron doesn’t know how to react to that.”
“Draco, he will be dealt with, I assure you of that, but right now Harkin needs you, and you can’t go running after revenge and help her. You are what is keeping her as stable as she is. We need you to keep doing that. Do this for her, Draco.” Severus stated as he reached up to make Draco look down at her, see how pale she was, feel the instability of her magic. “She needs you, and the twins need you, Draco.” Severus finished, and Draco practically collapsed next to her bed in soft sobs.
When she was finally finished, the dishes disappeared, and a note appeared on the table. “For Albus when he comes looking. Come.” Harry stood up, and he wrapped his arm around her waist, and Nagini slithered up and over his shoulders, and they disapparated. The appeared at the front gates to Harry assumed was Malfoy Manor. Mipsy appeared next to them carrying all of Harry’s bags, and she felt sorry for the elf.
“Yes, or otherwise the baby will be born out of wedlock.” Harkin stated.
“Those are interesting observations, Mr. Malfoy, and very good logic, I just hope your mind doesn’t get you in trouble, my boy. And I would most definitely inform you of the date of her extraction. May I ask if your mother knows you are doing this for her?”
Draco’s eyes zoomed from Harry to Vernon in an instant. “You cannot treat him that way, he is your bloody nephew, not your bloody slave. Harry is coming with me and you have no say,” Draco shouted, and he turned to Harry and whispered, “Go pack, Harry. You’re coming home with us.” Harry finally look up at Draco and his emerald eyes met Draco’s grey, and then Harry’s eyes zoomed over to Vernon and back to Draco before he ran upstairs and packed his trunk. When Harry was finished shoving his stuff into his trunk, and he grabbed Hedwig and his trunk, and he pulled them down the stairs.
Her hair was much longer like she was trying to grow it out as long as it could be. She looked skinnier than she used to be, and paler, too. She actually looked rather sickly. Harry wondered if this was because of him or something that happened because of Voldemort or the war.
“Sirius Black? Harry, isn’t he a…”
“What is it Draco?” Harry questioned as he raised his eyebrow at Draco.
“Sirius said that Harry didn’t say a word in Parseltongue. Nagini is under the control of the Dark Lord, and she was probably following his orders to protect Harry. Harry tried to stop her, and she got hurt and doesn’t have medical attention. How would you feel if Harry died trying to save your father, Ronald, and he lived. Your best friend, and you turned on her after the event without even getting her side of things. We don’t know what’s happening because we don’t have contact with her. So I say until we hear from Harry, we don’t judge her.” Draco said driving everyone into silence. “That is what I thought.”
“Yes, but I’m a prefect, they wouldn’t do anything that would get them in trouble.” Draco stated.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy. I figured you’d be the one responsible for this. How’s Mr. Potter doing?”
“Morning, Blaise.” Draco said.
Draco groaned in pleasure as he slipped her pajama bottoms off along with her panties, and he pushed her legs farther apart. His fingers playing with her clitoris as she gasped and moaned underneath him. “D-Dray…y-your turn.” Harry stuttered as her one hand slipped down his back and tugged at the waistband of his trousers, and Draco understood. He pulled away reluctantly, and stripped down to nothing, and he climbed back on top of her stripping Harry’s pajama top of buttons leaving her shirt open. Draco went back to ravishing her neck but quickly moved to her collarbone as his fingers found their way back to her clitoris. His erection was pushing against her inner thigh, and Harry’s hand managed to find its way between them to grasp it in her small hands.
“They aren’t, now. But because of my uncle and Queen Elizabeth and other situations with other wizards, we were eventually hidden away from muggles. The wizards of the time thought it best to hide us away, because they felt that muggles only wanted us around because of our magic. Wizards were pulled out of muggle society and forgotten about or stayed but hide half of who they were at all times. That is right around when the Malfoy’s started their views on muggles.” Draco finished as he pushed the doors open to the great hall and the entire room went silent as everyone turned to stare at the two.
“That is alright, Tally, and thank you for the update. I just had some questions for you, or well Weasley but he needed to see you.” Draco turned towards Ron and said, “Weasley?”
“Yes, I suspect that this will move up her delivery date by quite a bit, but we won’t know until it gets closer to the date. I am definitely going to have to keep a closer eye on her and the progression of their growth.” Melody stated, and then she lowered her voice. “These two babies will be extremely powerful, Sev, so powerful that they might be the next…” Melody cut off, but Severus knew what she was going to say: Dark Lord. Severus hoped not. With the amount of love and smothering that these two children will have, he hoped that they wouldn’t be anywhere near what the Dark Lord was capable of.
“9 broken arms, 6 bruised ribs, 3 broken ribs, 2 broken legs, several concussions and stitches, plus being raped twice, not to mention the starvation and the confinement to the cupboard under the Dursley’s stairs.” Harry flinched away from Snape and collapsed on the floor, bringing her knees up to her chest.
“What are you doing, Malfoy? You do realize that this potion may wear off or they might find out what’s keeping me this way.” Malfoy started kissing the side of Harry’s neck. “Why now, Malfoy?” Harry panted, and her hands rested on Malfoy’s shoulders. “Merlin why does that feel so good? I’ve never been this sensitive.” Harry moaned, and Malfoy moved his lips up behind Harry’s ear.
“I can’t guarantee that, but if it is possible I will do my best to try and keep that promise. I can’t guarantee it because I don’t know who is going to be around and obstacles that may be there.”
Harry’s eyes grew very wide at the sight of Tonks holding her wand to his face. “What the hell is going on?” Harry screamed as he struggled to get away, but Tonks held him tight. “Let go of me. Dray, Narcissa, what’s going on?” Harry directed in their general direction.
“Yes, I’ll take them to the room.” Andromeda walked over and rested her hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Come with me please.” Draco nodded at her and picked Harry off the floor, and Draco and Narcissa followed Andromeda to her safe room. “You should be safe here. We will come and get you when we know it is safe.” She walked out of the room and Narcissa turned to Draco, who was now sitting on the floor in the corner with Harry curled in his lap.
“Num-nums.” Teddy muttered enthusiastically towards the bottle in Harry’s left hand. “Num-num, num-num.”
“Well, you've had three plates, I’m sure you have eaten enough for the both of us.” Harkin stated, and the entire Slytherin table that heard busted up laughing.
“Can I ask what condition you found her in?” Hermione asked.
Harry remember Bill and Fleur’s wedding, he remembered Kingsley’s Patronus crashing the wedding, he remembered running for Ginny and being pushed back. He remembers apparating to where ever they apparated and getting coffee. He remembered Grimmauld Place, Kreacher, and the Ministry. He remembered leaving that Ministry and Ron getting splinched. He remembered Ron leaving and Godric’s Hollow. He remembered getting the sword out of that little pond in Dean’s Forest, and Ron coming back and destroying the horcrux. He remembers going to see Xenophilius Lovegood, and the Death Eaters attacking them. The next thing he remembers is Malfoy Manor, and then things start to get fuzzy.
Accidents lead to more accidents.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, but it can wait until after breakfast, dragon. If you don’t mind me dragging you away from Draco for a little while, Harry, dear?”
“Go away. Why do you care now? No one has before.” Snape closed the distance and kneeled in front of her and placed his hands on either side of her face and he dived into her mind. He saw every injury Harry had been caused all the way back to the first broken arm Dudley gave him at age 4. He pulled away and stared at Harry.
“Is this the elf you saw or not.” Draco almost snapped but thought better of it.
“Harry. We are here to pick you up.”
“She is upstairs sleeping again, Mum.” Draco whispered as he brushed his fingers through his hair, and Narcissa knew that he was worried because his hair was falling into his face and his hands were shaking slightly. Narcissa stepped forwards and wrapped her arms around her son.
“Draco, no. I don’t know what that will do to Harry or the Dark Lord.” Severus yelled, and Draco released and glared up at him.
Draco could see that he was about to say something so he walked over and placed a finger over his lips. “Don’t speak, Potter. You’ll drain your energy.” Draco removed his finger as he sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed. “So I’m going to cast a spell, and it’s going to let me read your thoughts. I am going to be the only one that will be able to read them. All you have to do is think what you want said and push them outwards like you were actually saying them.” Draco pulled his wand, and Harry noticed that it was the wand that Harry hadn’t given back yet. “Yeah, I found it in your trunk last night trying to find your pajamas. I also noticed that you updated your wardrobe; I do approve of the new choices though.”
“That is where the misconception is wrong Septima, he is indeed still here, and in fact he is in this room as we speak. Mr. Potter has since been trapped inside his own mind. I just hope that he can find his way out. Now, this does bring me to the reason I have brought us here. The Dark Lord has been able to preserve his soul in the absence of his body in the use of Horcruxes.” Everyone gasped at the notion. “Yes, as a matter of fact he had seven, but thanks to Mr. Potter, his friends, and Albus, there is only one left, and I believe Miss Lovegood can help us in the recovery of the object in question. Miss Lovegood if you please.”
“Why is it really hot in here and why are we naked?” Harry asked. Shifting so his arms were around Draco pulling him closer.
“You are definitely peculiar, Harry. I’m glad I changed that.”
“I wish for the prefect to escort all of the students to their dorms and not to leave until your head of house states so. Your head of house will take roll call and you will stay in the dorms until farther notice.” Dumbledore said and then dismissed the students, and he turned to the staff. “As soon as roll is done I want the staff to find all of the students not accounted for. We will find who is responsible for this disturbance at punish them accordingly.” Dumbledore then dismissed the staff and they headed off to their required sections.
“Excellent, sir. I will see you then.”
“That is a good question, Mel, one I do not have at this moment. Poppy, can you stabilize Mr. Malfoy, please. We are going to need him in as good of condition as possible to even think about saving Harkin and the twins.” Severus stated, and Madam Pomfrey immediately hurried over to Draco and started casting spells on him to stabilize and heal him, while Melody and Severus did everything, they could to help Harkin and the twins. Severus started casting healing charms on Harkin while Melody started checking on the twins and trying to stabilize the magic Harkin had webbed around the twins. Melody was actually surprised at the amount a magic she had webbed around them to protect them at all cost; she had such strong magic around them that nothing could probably get at these two babies until they were ready to come out.
“Yeah, I’ll be out to help you in a minute.”
“Well, if you can’t help me then I’ll ask her alright, how about that?”
“You are a horcrux.” Sirius stated in shock.
“I’m supposed to turn myself into the Ministry by 2 this afternoon.” Sirius stated as he pulled her back in, and Harkin rearranged herself so she was more comfortable in his embrace; she was practically straddling Sirius’ lap with her arms wrapped around his neck.
“Not a soul.” Arthur opened the door and lead theme into a circular room. Harry was about to close the door when Arthur stopped her. He walked over and opened another door and they stepped through into a room. Harry wasn’t sure how long Arthur was going to help, but she was sure it wasn’t going to be long. And sure enough as soon as she thought that Arthur turned around and looked at her.
Draco did exactly that and he walked over and sat down on the bench next to Severus. “What answers? I’m just looking for Harry.”
“Why wouldn’t anyone accept you, love?” Draco asked as he stroked his fingers against her cheek, whipping away the tears.
“I don’t know if I could go down there and face them after storming out like that. I feel so stupid about what happened. I mean I stormed out because everything was going so well with Remus, Sirius, and your parents, and I don’t know how to confront them after that.” Harkin whispered.
“It’s alright, Draco, darling. I still have my son, I still love you. Why don’t you go back up by Harry, dear? It’ll make you feel better.” Narcissa said as she turned and walked him out of the room. “I’ll deal with Mr. Potter’s friends.” Narcissa said as she released her son and walked back into the dining room. “Why are you making my son relive one of his worst memories? We have done nothing but take care of Mr. Potter. He is safe here and if you wish to stay to see him or ever come back to see him again off you do leave, you will not question my son about actions that he had no control over.” Draco heard his mother say until he was out of ear shout and could no longer hear. He continued to his room where he found Harry staring at him when he opened the door.
“Not until I know for sure.” Harry whispered, but kept her face down.
“At least you’re honest.”
“No, Mr. Malfoy. You and Miss Potter are free to go.” Professor Umbridge said as she walked towards the door.
“Of course, dear.” Madam Pomfrey stated, and then turned back to Ron. “You don’t move, I am not done with you yet.” She scolded before turning and heading into her office.
“Come.” He said as he grabbed her arm and pulled her from the bed and down the stairs, and they ended up back in the ball room that was now empty. They stood there and soon Death Eaters were filling up the room again. Once everyone was there, Voldemort started talking. “I’m sorry for the late hour but something urgent just came to my knowledge. Miss Potter is to be unharmed. No one is to touch her in any way possible. If I find out that anyone has, you will face my wrath. Is this information understood?”
“Longer than I care to admit, Potter, but long before I got this mark on my arm. There’s a reason I do what I do, Harry. That’s why I couldn’t tell her, Aunt Bella. You asked me once why I didn’t tell her. This is why.” Draco said as he placed his hand on the side of Harry’s face massaging his thumb against Harry’s cheek. Harry turned into the embrace, and his hands slide out of Draco’s hair and down his shoulders to the collar of Draco’s dress shirt. Harry pulled the Slytherin tie off and started unbuttoning the shirt.
“He’s asleep.” Draco stated.
“That’s a tricky question, Professor. My mother may know, but I did not tell her. She is where I get most of my intuitive nature from. She can figure out the smallest things from the smallest actions or speech.”
“I can’t answer that yet, but if my calculations are correct he should be completely free by the end of the school year if not before. You may have to testify since you were a witness in your third year to the events in the shrieking shack, but I will push for that to not happen, given by the time they will need you to testify you will be four to six months pregnant. Given the circumstances behind your pregnancy I want it kept secret as long as possible. I have talked to professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Severus about you both having access to each other’s common rooms, and Draco getting a private room. Your bond is essential to your lives now, and that is important. I also talked about the school being informed and them not being able to say anything about it to anyone.”
“Mr. Malfoy, I don’t see why a woman would do this to that girl out there, what would be the point.”
“Snape has him?”
“I understand, Mr. Malfoy. The healer should be here in a few minute, Professor McGonagall has to clear them and give them access to only the path from her office to this ward and back.” Draco walked back over to Harry and sat on the bed, where Harry had fallen back asleep. Madam Pomfrey followed him, and she stopped once her eyes landed on Harry. “Mr. Malfoy, you might have under exaggerated his condition.”
“Oh, Harkin, darling. We were wondering when you and Draco would come down. Where is Draco?” she asked.
“Fine, I gave her access to Remus. Are you happy, Cissa? She has been nothing but an annoyance since she stepped foot in our home. Almost getting us killed by the Dark Lord, and then Severus with his experimental potions that could have killed Draco. Nothing but trouble and now…now she’s pregnant, and it’s not even Draco’s fault. It’s Severus’ with his stupid potion. Nott fucking raped her getting her knocked up, and now my son is the father because of that potion. How is that fair to Draco?”
“Just because you’re on top doesn’t mean you can’t get fucked,” Harry retorted as he moved his hands south and pushed a finger into Draco’s entrance. Draco groaned as Harry pushed the finger all the way in and stopped.
“Not funny, Harry,” Draco said as he pushed Harry and then moved to straddle Harry’s hips. “You know we could just skip diner and do other things.” Draco smirked as his fingers ran down Harry’s torso and into the little hairs around his newly formed erection. Draco started twirling his finger in the little hairs, and then stopped as Harry’s stomach growled with hunger. “Well, I guess that answers that question.” Draco chuckled. “Let’s get cleaned up.” Draco climbed off the bed and pulled Harry to the bathroom and into the shower.
“Fine you want to run across the room now. We can stun him again and run across the room.”
“So, you think that a house elf poisoned you?” Melody asked, and Harkin nodded. “So, they gave a house elf the poison and told them to poison you. Merlin, they have gone too far. Something has to be done, but they can’t find them.” Melody stated. “But the good news is that the antidote is easy to brew. Madam Pomfrey, can you go and get Severus, please.” Melody asked, and Madam Pomfrey nodded before hurrying to her office to floo Severus. A few minutes later, Severus walked out of Madam Pomfrey's office, and he walked over to Harkin.
“Good deduction Ms. Granger, but the Dark Lord is skilled in wandless magic.”
“Malfoy, where is Harry?” Granger shouted first.
Draco walked back downstairs to find Granger waiting impatiently at the door to the dining room. “Where is he?” Granger asked as soon as she saw Draco.
“Because I said so, Mr. Weasley. Maybe with one of his detentions you won’t go around punching people because you are angry and feel they deserve it.” McGonagall stated and then completely walked out of the room.
“Shit.” Severus swore as he hurried over to Draco, who had his hands covering both his ears. “Draco, focus on her not the pain. Which way do you feel her from? Where do you want to go?”
“The Dark Arts aren’t my forte, Mr. Malfoy.”
“What do you mean? You can’t go yet.”
“Well, Draco found Jamelynn, which was like my Dad’s name, and I still wanted to represent him. So I kept it, and Harkin was as you said unique, and it means dark red or fiery one, which Draco thought was fitting given my sorting.” Harry explained.
“I might say you make a beautiful lady, Potter.”
“Ready to go?” Severus asked, and Harkin nodded in response. “Okay, did you want to stop at the hospital wing to get some bruise-healing paste?”
“Potter, even though this exerts less energy doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exert any at all. I accept your truce. I was actually hoping that we could try and be friends this year, since we are bunking together.”
“Yes, we may go, Mother,” Draco responded, and then Narcissa disappeared. They ended up at the Manor, and Harry stumbled as they landed and he stumbled into Draco. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry to help stabilize him a little bit. “Sorry, Harry. I forgot that you’ve never disappeared before. How are you doing?” Harry looked up at Draco, and he just nodded his head.
“A prophecy. I was told what it says, but it turns out that there was more than what my spy overheard, and I want to know what it is. Are you curious yet, Harry Potter?”
“What did you want to talk about, Severus?” Draco asked as he placed his hand on the table next to Harry’s unconsciously, and the three adults looked at them. “What?” he looked down to see he was aimlessly stroking Harry’s hand with his fingers.
“Thank you, but you are a little biased.” Harkin muttered, and Draco smirked as he pulled her into his arms.
“May I ask how you think you know more about Mr. Potter’s intentions than I do?”
“I think she hoped not to worry you, that Severus would be able to spot them, or that they would soon be caught.” Melody explained.
“Always, dragon.” Narcissa said as she pulled away. “We should head back inside the hour is almost up.” Draco looked at his mother and them up at the building they walked out of, and Narcissa chuckled. “Come, dragon, let’s get you back to your love.” They started walking inside when they stopped because of yelling that filled the room.
“I couldn’t let you get punched, Dray. He is mad at me, just let him get it out of his system and he should cool off.  He has been my best friend for 5 years, I do understand him, most of the time anyway.” Harkin stated as she glanced over her shoulder for Ron to see the bruise starting to form on her face.
“A blood replenishing potion. I figured he would need it considering my condition.” He stated without looking up from Harry. Madam Pomeroy though snatched the potion out of Harry’s hands and examined it.
“Are you making fun of me?” Draco said.
“You will always be my favorite.” Harkin whispered in his ear. “But don’t tell them that.” Harkin laughed, and so did Sirius.
“You are with Potter?” Lucius questioned as he looked back and forth between Harry and Draco. “Son, are you really going to continue with this blasphemy? I can’t believe you are still on about this blasphemy; it’s disgraceful to this family and the generations of this family to come. It is disgraceful, Draco, whether or not you see it yet or not. Just think about it, Draco. Without you there is no longer a Malfoy line. It will end with you, Draco. Think about that, please,” Lucius expressed.
“How do you know that Dumbledore knows?”
“Your mother doesn’t want you wandering around without an adult with you until your father and Thaddeus are caught.” Severus stated.
Draco pulled out of his daydream and he growled at Voldemort. “No! Let him go.” Draco snarled. “Let him go.”
“Wedlock? What are we in the early 1900s? No, we’re almost into the 21st century, you don’t have to worry as much about having a baby out of wedlock.” Hermione stated.
Harry woke the next morning with Voldemort sitting in a chair by the window which startled her. “I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to startle you. I just wanted to get an early start on the morning, and your mind is so easy to penetrate in your sleep. So how long has Lucius and Severus been trying to help you escape?” Harry just stared at him.
“I’ve always had a thing for you, Harry. I’ve just never done anything about it, because I have an obligation to my family to produce heirs to our family. I’m bisexual, Harry, but it’s not alright when I have to produce heirs.”
“What happened to him?”
“Harry, I will never do that to you. Okay. You deserve to have a friend, Harry, and I’m hoping it will always be me.” Draco pulled Harry out of the house, grabbing Harry’s trunk and Hedwig before exiting the house.
Draco stopped in the middle of the hallway, and Narcissa stopped behind him as Draco ran his fingers through his hair. “Mum, if she dies, I die. If anything happens to us, I want you to take care of our baby, and I don’t mean how father raised me. I want my baby to be raised properly. The pureblood stuff can stay, but the rest of the bullshit can disappear. I don’t know if you will ever have to trust you with this, but with the bond I can’t not have a plan if something does happen, I need a plan.”
“No, but my father beat me to make me the way he wanted me to turn out and look at me now. Doing exactly what he never wanted me to do, despise his ways and the Dark Lord. I want my mother to be free of his grasp and out of danger. And I want to get to know this beautiful woman and actually fall in love with her even if that means she might turn back into a him, eventually.”
“Hermione, they’re here to help. Somethings up with Harry, and we have to find this thing before we lose him. I don’t want to find out what it is like in a world without Harry. Do you?”
“Mr. Weasley, I believe that will get you a detention.” Severus started, but as Ron started to protest, Harkin stepped forwards.
“150 Galleons.”
“Yes, well, the night that the Dark Lord went to kill Harry Lily’s blood magic saved him, causing the Dark Lord to vanish without a trace, but his soul latched on to the one living thing that was in the room.” Narcissa stated, and Sirius’ eyes widened.
“Thaddeus Nott’s.” Lucius finished.
“Yes, I know, love. Wizards have a higher sex drive. Hadn’t you noticed?”
“I know. I’m not and you weren’t, but Siri and James and apparently Draco.” Remus stated as he bowed his head. “I know Draco can’t find you here, but you should let him know that you are alright, cub.” Remus whispered.
“In your explanation, you said, ‘…and making sure mother and I made it out alive and not in Azkaban…’ Why not your father?” Remus clarified.
“Malfoy Manor. The Dark Lord wouldn’t trust Nott with Harry again, and even with my Father’s indiscretions, he’s still better and more powerful than all of his followers that are free from Azkaban.”
“What do you mean?”
“I-I…when?”
“Yes, it wasn’t the best experience. Which is why I never wanted to do it again.” Draco said as he gave Harry a look.
“As you wish, love.” Draco whispered against his lips, and he closed the distance between them. Draco slipped his tongue past Harry’s lips, and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling him closer to him. Harry shifted underneath Draco and rolled his hips upwards, and Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth. Harry felt the vibrations throughout him.
“Something that I should have done when the Ministry interviewed you 14 years ago.” Narcissa said. “Stupefy.” She shouted.
Narcissa walked back to Draco’s room, and she placed Harry gently on the bed next to Draco. Narcissa watched as Draco pulled the covers up and over Harry, and he pulled her into his arms. Narcissa the turned towards the room and started casting a few spells, and Draco looked up at his mother with confusion in his eyes.
“Six parties. Merlin, I have no sense of how to do parties. The only reason I have an alright wardrobe is because I had help. I can’t plan a party.” Harry stated, and she felt like she was going to have a panic attack.
“No. No, Severus I can’t risk it, not her. She’s perfect and special, and I can’t risk doing it wrong. I can’t, Severus. I can’t.” Draco repeated as he continued to try and get away from Severus.
“I would assume that no one told but I don’t know that for sure I just know that I didn’t and Draco and Harry most likely wouldn’t. I’m assuming that I can trust that none of you told my husband where I was.”
“Or so he says anyway.” Harkin stated, and she felt Draco chuckle against the side of her head.
“Because one Draco would kill me; two she isn’t the spitting image of her father anymore and three Lily will haunt me from the grave if I hurt her pregnant daughter.” Severus stated as he stormed out of the compartment.
“I didn’t.” Harry said as he pulled his hands from his ears and rested one against Draco’s cheek. “Draco did.” Harry said and everyone looked towards Draco and he was gapping at Harry.
“Thank you, Remi. I appreciate your reassurance, but I should still head home.” Harkin smiled as she stood up and walked over to the fireplace, and she grabbed some floo powder.
Eventually, Madam Pomfrey walked back into the room, and she had Professor McGonagall with her. Harry groaned aloud as he placed his face in his hands and his now long hair fell in his face. Harry brushed it behind his ear quickly and looked up at the two women. “I’m stuck, aren’t I?” Harry questioned.
“You think he’s up to something or that he might have already done something?”
“Blaise, I’ll be out in a little bit.” Draco said over Harry’s shoulder whose face was pressed into Draco’s shoulder so Blaise couldn’t see him. Blaise rolled his eyes and walked out of the room closing the door behind him. “We didn’t have a locking charm or silencing charm on the door.” Draco realized. Harry pulled his face away from Draco’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes. “Yes, Harry, I’m a screamer when I get fuck, that much I do remember.”
“Now that the Dark Lord is a squib, I will be upstairs taking care of that, and attempting to get him out of here as soon as possible.” Severus walked out of the room, and Harry collapsed into Draco’s chest.
“Come for me, Dray.” Harry whimpered, and she dug her fingers into his skin. Draco came inside her, and he bit into her shoulder. After they came back down, their grips loosened, and they looked each other in the eyes.
“I will, but don’t tell anyone I did so.”
“Draco, you’re my cousin, and Harry Potter. My god. What are you doing in my house?” Tonks asked with surprise in her voice.
“Well, yeah. I’m me, and he hates me.”
“Yeah, this alcove is sound proof I once spent an entirety of my Father’s meetings in here laughing and no one noticed.” Draco said as he kissed her again and lifted her up onto one of the small shelves in the space and slid back inside her. Harry moaned and entangled her fingers in Draco’s hair as he trusted into her. Draco heard every moan she made right next to his ear, and he could feel as he was about to go over the edge, and moaned her name as he came. She screamed his name as she came, and she collapsed against him.
“I-I un-underst-st-stand,” Harry stuttered with a whisper. Draco leaned down and started kissing the nape of Harry’s neck. Harry moaned as Draco sucked on the side of his neck, and the only thing that was keeping him up was Draco’s arms around him. Harry rested his hands on Draco’s waist and pulled him closer to him; their erections rubbing together causing the boys to moan. “Draco, your parents. Won’t they hear us?” Without removing himself from Harry’s neck, Draco lifted his wand and cast a silencing charm on the room. Draco was creating quite a hickey on Harry’s neck when there was a knock on the door.
“Still, weight is a tricky subject for women especially pregnant women, mate.” Blaise stated.
“Tell us, Severus.” McGonagall was the one to answer.
Harkin loved watching as everyone’s faces light up as they watched the little beans move around inside her, but when everyone left and it was just her again, she felt so alone in the giant manor. Draco usually would come to bed after she fell asleep and would be gone before she woke, which upset her, but she understood.
“I understand it is intimidating, Miss Potter, but it isn’t as bad as it seems.”
“Boys,” Narcissa stated with a sneer on her face, one like the one that his father always wore when something went his way.
“Draco, how do you have that much?”
“Okay, and what about those things?” Draco asked.
“I know, but that doesn’t mean I was expecting you to comment about your prick size.” Draco responded.
“We can fix that. You were innocent; it isn’t fair that you shouldn’t enjoy your freedom. Lucius can go and talk to the minister about it right now if you wish.”
“Wow, Potter. You are amazing at playing along,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear.
“Thank you, Uncle Sev. Sometimes I think I just need a reminder that we feed off of each other’s magic, I stabilize her, and she stabilizes me. I’m sorry, I thought I was doing the right thing.” Draco stated the last part more towards Harkin than Severus.
“Well, suck it up, Potter. I’m going carry you up to the hospital wing.” Harry’s face scrunched up as Draco stood up and leaned down the scoop Harry into his arms. Draco was about walked out of the room, when Harry stopped him.
“I’m a Malfoy, mother.” Draco stated without turning around. “I wasn’t going to go to some shop and buy a ring off the shelves for my Harry. She’s special and unique, and she needs a ring to compliment her.”
“Wait this shows where everyone is right now?” Draco asked as he came to a stop.
“Yes, want answers. You can give them to me?”
They stayed like that for a while until they heard pounding on the door, and Draco untangled himself from Harry and stepped out of the tub, grabbing a towel to wrap around his waist as he went. He opened the door a crack to peek out and see his mother. “Mother, can I help you with something?”
“I love you too, my dragon.” Harkin whispered as she turned in his arms to kiss him. Draco's hands moved up to the side of her face, which caused her to wince in pain from the bruise that was now a lot bigger than before.
“Perfect. You owl Fred, and I will owl mother.” Draco stated, and he turned towards Harkin, who was starting to look pale. “Love, are you feeling alright? You look a little pale.” Draco observed, and she looked up to Draco.
“I’m going to fix you, love. You just need to hold on just a little longer, love, so I can make the potion you need to get better. I love you, just hold on.” Draco said as he kissed her flaming skin, and he stood up and walked out of the room and down to the drawing room Voldemort has taken to settling in after the incident. Draco slammed the door open, breaking all the wards that Voldemort placed around the room so no one could enter, and he marched up to the snake and said, “I need your snake, and I need it now. If you don’t give it to me, I’ll kill it right now to get what I need.” Draco stated with no stutter or flinch when Voldemort stood up and stepped towards him. Draco didn’t even stop staring the man down as he stared into his eyes. “Try Legilimens on me and you’ll regret it old man. I’ll deal with you later.”
“These bruises there from him aren’t they. Thaddeus, when he raped you.”
“Good. Unpack and get some sleep. I have your new timetables for you, and Harkin for all intents and purposes you are under my charge. Minerva has agreed to turn you over a Slytherin charge. She isn’t incredibly happy about it, but given that I am your guardian now, at least until Black is cleared, she is willing to let me have you.”
“When do you think that happened?” Lucius asked.
“No, he wanted you out of our lives and didn’t care what he had to lose. Including his wife, son, and grandchildren.” Draco stated as Narcissa walked into the compartment with Hermione and Theo.
“Bloody hell, Weasley. What the hell?” Draco shouted, and the entire hall was staring at them.
“Yes, my raven.” Draco questioned.
“What that doesn’t make any sense?”
“So the last thing you remembered was looking into my eyes, Potter?” Harry nodded causing their noses to rub against each other. Draco’s hands moved forwards so they were positioned on either side of Harry’s hips. Harry slide his hands forwards so they rested right in front of Draco’s hips.
That was when Harkin noticed the tie that Draco was wearing, and she smiled; he was wearing her Gryffindor tie to match her dress, and Draco noticed the smirk. “Don’t say it. I just didn’t have a red and black tie to match your dress. Don’t think this will ever happen again, because after tonight I am going out and buying my own tie.” Draco stated without even looking at her.
“She’s alright and so is the baby. Melody will take you back to see her. Go on, dragon.” Narcissa said as she lifted her hand to brush some of his hair back that fell in his face.
Draco looked to his mother and pulled her in for a hug. “It’s alright, mum. I know, Father, can be, well, Father. You don’t have to apologize for that.” Draco let go of Narcissa, and stepped back to Harry’s side. That’s when Lucius walked into the room, and Draco unintentionally stepped in front of Harry protectively.
“Alright, Harkin.” Severus said with a slight bowed head before turning toward Ron. “It seems that you are off the hook this time, Mr. Weasley, but I can assure you that next time will not be the case.”
“But dear you would be left out.”
“Harry, he’s dead.”
“Potter! Shut the bloody door. Either get your bloody ass in the bloody house or get your ass out of my house. But I would rather have you get your friends out of my house and get your bloody ass in the kitchen and make diner,” Vernon yelled.
“Well, I think Hermione’s figured it out. You wanted to eat.” Harry beamed as he turned and walked over to his bed and sat down, pulling one of the plates over to him in the process. Draco walked over and sat down behind Harry, wrapping himself around Harry’s back side, and Harry moaned as the heat melted into his skin, leaning into the heat as he ate. Draco pulled one of the plates over and started eating himself.
“Madam Pomfrey said you could come down for lunch, love. Would you like to come down?” Harry rolled so she was on her side and trapping Draco’s hand underneath the side of her face, and her hands came up and wrapped around Draco’s arm.
“Yes, why, Draco? What’s wrong?”
“It isn’t a competition, Siri.” Harkin smiled.
“No, Severus’ orders were exact he said I had to do this, and only I could do this. I just want it to work.” Draco cut his mother off, and stepped closer to the bed and sat Harry up so he could slip behind her. Draco heard her moan and try to snuggle into his side, and Draco smiled at that, she knew it was him. “Mother, Severus said it was best if we were alone for this. I don’t know why, but if it wasn’t Severus I wouldn’t say anything. Please.”
“That’s why he wanted to talk to you after class?” Pansy stated.
“Tea with the Sacred Twenty-eight?” Harry asked.
“Harry, what’s the matter?” Draco said and he was across the room in a few seconds standing next to the bed. Harry took his hand and gently pulled him onto the bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Getting out is futile, my dear. And if you continue with that you will harm your beautiful skin more than you already have.” Harry looked up and saw Draco standing there, and it was his voice, but Harry knew that this wasn’t him. Draco wouldn’t hurt her, and he definitely wouldn’t do this. He’s had plenty of free time to do something like this.
Harry is the Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team and also the seeker, though he got on the team differently than he had in the books. Draco and Harry had been messing around during their combine flying lesson with the Gryffindor’s while Madam Hooch was taking Neville to the hospital wing for breaking his wrist. What the two boys didn’t know was the Madam Hooch ran into Professor Snape on her way into the school and asked him to go out and check on the students while she escorted Longbottom to the hospital wing.
Sorry i haven't posted in a while. my roommate was in the process of moving out and having my new roommate move in. so it's been a busy couple of weeks. here's the next chapter i hope you enjoy what enfolds in this chapter.
“Speaking of dinner, Lucius, doesn’t know when he will be home,” Harry laughed as Draco pulled her into his lap, and he kissed her temple. Harry wrapped her arms around Draco’s neck, and she kissed him on the lips.
“What is it?” Severus asked.
“I hope you feel better, cub.” Remus whispered as she pulled Harkin into his arms one last time, and she stepped into the fire and was then standing in the drawling room of Malfoy Manor. She looked up to find Draco pacing, and she walked over to him and stepped in front of him. He almost nearly walked into her but he stopped just in time. He froze for a moment before stepping forwards and wrapping his arms around her, and she stood frozen this time, until one of Draco’s hands weaved into her hair pulling her face towards him and into a kiss. She was shocked until she finally melted into the kiss, bringing her hands up to his face and wrapping her arms around his neck, weaving her fingers into his hair.
“Oh, my sweet boy. If you think your father and I didn’t have sex before we were married. You’re more precious than ever.” She said as she caressed his cheek. “We are taking her to our healer, and having her checked out, and then I want her on conception potions. Understood?”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, you are both up, you may leave I have done my test on Mr. Potter and have cleared him healthy. Though, I do want to warn you about any snacks you may want for the next 36 hours to be cautioned, or non-existent would be preferred. Understood?”
“No, I think we will talk about what you and your mother can give us if we were to help you out. I mean if you want my protection you have to give me some information that I can use.” Harry brushed her finger along the outline of Malfoy’s erection.
“Interesting, father never told me that story.” Draco stated.
“We’re not going to have to get me a heat lamp, are we?” Harry joked, his teeth still chattering as Draco started rubbing a towel over him.
“Yes, is that a problem, because if it is I might have to find another place to keep my family safe? Draco is my son, and if the only way for him to be happy is without his father then so be it.” Narcissa stared her sister down, and she took Draco’s hand and started pulling Draco off the couch.
Draco cradled Harkin in his lap, and they waited for her healer to arrive, and soon Melody arrived followed by Madam Pomfrey. “Draco, what happened?” she questioned.
Narcissa planned their holiday that they were going to take, and she spent the next two weeks trying to plan a new holiday that Lucius wouldn’t be able to find them. They were going to take this holiday for the rest of the boys’ summer holiday. She was planning it to get the boys out of the country until their next term started, because she wanted them to forget the events that happened at the Manor, and she wanted it to be impossible for Lucius to find them until the boys were safe at school. Narcissa wanted her boys to be safe and that was all that she cared about at that point.
“Yes, but wouldn’t this spell here work for that?” Draco looked that over and they went on conversing like that back and forth until they had ironed out the wrinkles. Draco kept glancing up at Harry to make sure that he wasn’t too far gone. Once they had finished Draco put the parchment down and looked up at Harry to find him looking back at him. “Potter?” Draco questioned, but Harry was unresponsive, he didn’t even blink. “We need to hurry. Start casting those spells,” Draco ordered as he rushed over to Harry’s side, and closed his eyes so they weren’t staring, and then he placed his fingers over the pulse point in Harry’s neck. It was still beating, very faintly, but it was beating.
Alright, everyone so this is the last chapter, but let me know about your thoughts on this one, if you want a sequel, or your thoughts on the vampire aspect of this story. Any thing, just let me know.
“No, I was completely a virgin before that day you took me into that empty classroom.” Harry muttered. “But I have fingered myself.” Harry finished.
“I am still a witch.” Harkin said with a smirk.
“So, my nephew has taken your virtue. Mmm…and he even knocked you up while he was at it. Lucius, you forgot to teach the boy proper protection charms; though, father like son, right?” Bellatrix said, winking at Lucius like she knew something Harkin did not.
“Aurora, I believe what he is trying to say is that Mr. Malfoy is a vampire. What does Mr. Potter have to do with that, Severus?”
“Just like last time follow me, and don’t pay attention to anyone else. I won’t let you fall.” Draco whispered in her ear, and she sighed into his chest before nodding. Draco nodded to his mother and father, and Lucius turned towards the band just like Draco had the last time, and they were off. The four Malfoy’s twirled around the dance floor, and eventually when people were allowed to join in couples slowly started migrating onto the dance floor, and Harkin caught sight of Remus off to the back of the room by himself, and she frowned. “What’s the matter, love?” Draco asked without a missed beat, and Harkin looked up at him.
“In other words, I would be their science experiment. I’d rather not be a science experiment, Madam Pomfrey.” Harry stated and then turned to look at Draco and asked, “Did you bring me a change of clothes?” Draco rolled his eyes, and he reached into his bag and pulled out a neatly folded stack of clothes, and he handed it to her. Harry smiled, and she climbed off Draco’s lap and the bed and stepped over to the bed next to hers and she closed the curtains while she changed into her school uniform.
“Because I know how to fix you, Potter. I just need a little help from the Healer that helped you.” Draco stated that fact, because it was true and because he didn’t want to say the real reason without Harry admitting something to him first. Well, actually admitting it and remembering that you said it.
“Yeah, everyone can stay at my place. It might be uncomfortable but we can figure it out.” Bill said as he took hold of Fleur’s hand. “Come on, Mom, Dad. Let’s go.” Bill said as he pulled Fleur towards the door, and the rest of the Weasley’s followed. Ron turned back towards Snape.
“No, the Dursley’s treated me like you treat your house elves. Well not anymore, but before like Dobby.” Harkin stated. “Only probably worse because I didn’t actually do as I was told most of the time. At least at first, and then I realized that in order to survive I needed to adapt to my surroundings. I got beat less and locked in my cupboard less. Until I started using accidental magic, and then it got worse again.” Harkin continued. “I learned that the only way that I would survive was to make sure I knew how to take care of myself. Make sure I didn’t die in that house.” Harkin finished.
“We have a problem.” Severus said. “He’s moving her, and we don’t know when, but that isn’t the only problem.”
The next morning Draco woke up before Harkin, and he just watched her sleep. His fingers brushing through the loose strands of hair. Draco picked up the textbook he had sitting on his nightstand, and he started reading. He didn’t notice when Harkin woke up, but he suddenly felt someone drawing circles on his inner thigh with their finger. He looked down to find Harkin staring up at him. “Hey. How long have you been up?”
“It’s alright this has nothing to do with the Dark Art. This is about spells conflicting with other spells, you do know that, right?” Draco asked.
“Ron, stop.” Hermione tried, but he interrupted her.
“Yes, professor?” Draco asked him.
“Think about it, put two and two together, and you get…” Draco said with a smirk. Weasley looked at him like his mind was going to explode. “Don’t think about it too hard, Weasley. What do you want I’ll relay the message?”
“I’m not sure. They are planning something, I don’t know what it is or when it will happen, but I know it involves Harry and the Department of Mysteries, but in know that after that happens I want her out, if not before. I just don’t know what is happening to get an exact date. I only assume you have inner intel since you claim you know all the information I have, maybe you can talk to them about when might be the best time, I just wish to know when you plan on acting.”
“You giving me tips for later, Harry.”
“Yes, I know that, but Remi can…” Sirius started but was cut off by Severus.
“Just past 9. Are you hungry?”
Draco stopped and turned towards his godfather, and he asked, “Sev, what’s going on?”
“Alright, meet me in the main drawing room. I’ll be right down.”
“Why don’t I get to know?” Ron huffed.
“Thank you.” She whispered again, and then she turned and took Draco’s hand. The couple then headed out of the hospital wing and down to the great hall for breakfast with Severus on their tail. As soon as they reached the great hall, Draco immediately pulled Harkin over to the Slytherin table to apply the paste for her black eye, and everyone immediately started asking questions, which made Harkin smile. The Gryffindors never do that, your close friends like Ron and Hermione and eventually Ginny did, but not everyone at the table practically. Harkin just smiled and said that it was nothing, which upset Draco, and he ended up telling them the story anyway. The Slytherin table was in a small uproar about the whole thing, until Ginny walked up with Ron a small distance behind her, and the entire table was in silence as they waited for Harkin to react.
“He’s been better, but now that Voldemort is gone he can stay with me and not have to worry about working. I’m just glad you got your mother’s hair. Your father’s was always unruly and untamable.”
“Why? It was an interesting topic, and you seemed embarrassed about it. So my comment.”
“He looked happy about it, but not a happy like he gets to be partners with one of his friend, but happy in a devious way. Happy like everything in his plan was aligning. I see that look on your face sometimes when you’re planning something against Harry.”
“James was stubborn.” Sirius muttered as he pulled Harkin closer to him, and she laughed.
“Hermione asked to switch with me, professor. Something about being late on a paper, which I didn’t think was possible for ‘Mione, but she is my friend, so I did this for her anyway.” Ron stated, and Harkin held in the snort she so desperately wanted to make. Ron had been on the outs with Hermione ever since Hermione took Harry’s side in the argument that Ron had created between them. She held it in though, because she was too tired to actually start anything with Ron right now, and definitely not something that will most likely result in him getting detention and blaming her for that as well.
“Holy shit!” Draco whispered under his breath. “If we can do that, we’re invincible.”
She slowly moved her hand down as to not wake Draco, and she slowly turned so she was facing him as she reached down to unbutton Draco’s trousers. She finally got them unbuttoned, and she slipped her hands inside so she could slip his pants down to free his erection. She kissed him lazily before she slid down in the bed so her face was level with his crotch and erection pointing out at her, and she gently moved Draco onto his back so she would have better access and a better angle. She gently positioned Draco exactly as she wanted him, making sure the sheets were pulled up to underneath his armpits.
“You really do like breaking rule. So much like your father.” Severus drawled as he walked into the room. “Have you discussed her guardianship yet?”
Neville nodded, and Harry released him, and they continued on to the hospital wing. They stepped inside, and Madam Pomfrey hurried from her office. “What is it, Neville? What potion did you spill upon yourself this time?” she said, and then she noticed Harry for the first time. “And who is your friend, dear?” Harry just put his face in his hands and shook his head.
“Side effect. He got upset over something Blaise said and locked himself in the bathroom, and I couldn’t coax him out or figure out how to unlock the bloody door, and when I finally did he was cold as ice and he was barely breathing. I really hope he’s not going to have to deal with this the rest of his life because then winters are going to be brutal for him. We’re going to have to move somewhere warmer or otherwise I’m going to be worried all the time about whether or not he’ll freeze to death.”
“I didn’t even think about that. Shit! He won’t notice, you think.” Draco questioned.
“Yes, are you going to take my advice or not.”
“That a relationship isn’t just sex. Cissy, isn’t it our duty as parents to help him through our mistakes. I would have ended the world for you, and Draco is going down the same path I was.”
“Dray, it’s alright. I’m fine, just surprised by the sudden pressure. Keep going, please.” Draco continued to stretch Harry’s entrance, when Draco felt they were both ready he slipped another finger in, and he started stretching Harry further. “Dray, please.” Harry pleaded after a few thrusts of his fingers, so Draco slipped his fingers out and he lubricated his erection. After lining up his erection with Harry’s entrance Draco pushed his way into Harry causing a large groan escape from Harry’s lips. Draco leaned down and started kissing Harry as he started slow rhythmic thrusts into Harry.
“Great, now that that is over I have something else to worry about. Will you tell the Ministry that Draco and I have somehow absorbed his powers?”
“Yes, it’s phenomenal.” Severus stated. “That I could have created something so brilliant. Though the potion will probably will never be used again.”
“Don’t try to over think it, Potter. It’s alright if you don’t remember. Well, it’s time to get you up to the hospital wing. Do you trust me, Potter?”
“My sister doesn’t have the guts to fight me. She fears me just like anyone else.”
“Did you know that Rowena Ravenclaw had a daughter? But her daughter died by the hands of the one she loved before she could have any children of her own. She is the only founder that knowingly didn’t have any descendants. It is unknown whether or not Godric Gryffindor had any children or not.”
“My dear, you look beautiful. Now I’m here to fix your hair and make-up. I hope you don’t mind.”
“No, don’t think like that, love.” Draco said as he brushed her hair out of her face and tucked it behind her ear. “He will understand that you were just trying to keep yourself alive, love.” Draco said as he pulled her against his chest. Narcissa walked in the room then and walked up to the fireplace, and she grabbed a pinch of floo powder.
“One of my friends is going to be here soon to help me with my renovation to the house, so you picked the wrong day to come here.” Harry shifted Teddy in his arms as he pulled his wand from his pocket and gave it to Teddy for better access.
“In the nook asleep. Why, Lucius? What’s going on?”
“Alright Kiddo, come here.” Harry said, holding out his arms for the little man. Andromeda handed him over to Harry.
“I didn’t forget the spells I just forgot to use them.”
“Thank you, Harkin. I always wanted siblings, and though you are technically the mother of my new sibling, I feel like you’re a younger sister to me. Thank you for believing in me." Theo stated, and Harkin hugged him back.
“No, it actually looks better like that.” Draco looked up and started laughing with Harry. They were still laughing when they walked up to Narcissa. She just gave them a look and she took Harry’s trunk and owl and sent them to the Manor.
“No, but we need to know what the worst possibility is so we can prevent it, hopefully.” Draco said as the Healer walked into the wing.
“If you haven’t noticed Harry is now a girl so it is inappropriate to call her mate.”
“Dray…Dray...” Harkin tried to get Draco’s attention, and he finally looked at her. “This is not your fault, Draco. You are not your father, and you most definitely can’t control him. I don’t blame you, and nor should you blame yourself. Lucius is an arse, who can’t see through his past, and that has blinded him from the future; the path that you have decided to take. I love you, Draco Malfoy, and I do not plan on going anywhere.” Harkin stated, and he leaned in and kissed her on the lips.
“You can stay as long as you like.” Draco stated. “Mother and Father won’t mind, and I think she’s going to need you close by until this is all over.”
“The three of us.” Draco whispered with a smile as Harry’s eyes fluttered open.
“Yes, of course. Dobby would be honored to make Miss Harry Potter's food for her and her babies. Dobby won’t let anything happen to Miss Harry Potter or her food.”
“Since before I came out, it’s why I broke up with Ginny. Thanks for being nosy and making me say that before I even told Draco. Thanks.” Harry stood up and stormed over to the bathroom. Draco was about to follow Harry when he slammed the door, and he heard it lock.
“Yes, I do. Do you really think that my father would do that?” Draco questioned as he glanced towards the door. “Why are we hiding in the bathroom?”
“What are you talking about, Severus?” McGonagall asked.
“Yes, please.” Harkin stated with a small sigh, and Draco grabbed their bags before they started walking out of the room. They walked back down to the hospital wing, and when they walked inside Madam Pomfrey was attending to a redhead at the end of the room, which made Harkin stop dead in her tracks. Ron had glanced up at the sound of the door opening, and he immediately glanced away at seeing Harkin and Draco. Draco had a confused look on his face, which Harkin saw, and she realized that Draco didn’t do this to him, but if Draco didn’t who did. The answer was given as they got closer and heard Ginny screaming at him from across the room, which made Harkin blush with laughter. The sound that escaped Harkin’s lips made Ginny shut up as she glanced up and saw the group coming towards them.
“Harkin!” Draco yelled.
“I am aware, that brings up my topic of arrival. We need to talk.” Narcissa stepped out of the way to let the pair inside, and he walked inside like he owned the place, dragging Harry with him.
“Alright, Madam Pomfrey, now this is where I’m going to need a little help, I think you might be able to help.” Draco said as he brought the list over to her.
“No, cub. That isn’t what I think at all. You are both important to me, both of you are my family, my pack, I can’t lose either of you. You saved him, cub. You saved him.” Remus said as he pulled Harkin into a hug as she started crying on his shoulder with her arms wrapped tight around his neck. “I already knew that he was going to come back. He will. They can’t take him away, not after what they did to him the first time. He’s going to make it out of it this time. I promise, cub.” Remus whispered in her ear, and he heard her sniffle.
“What?” Draco questioned, not sure what they were talking about and that was when Severus stepped into the doorway. “Severus, what are you doing here?”
“What spells were used on Harry during his stay? Things that involve his treatment at St. Mungos, because if they cast one wrong spell, I might not be able to help him, and the entire wizarding world will lose a great person and asset to our survival after the Dark Lord’s demise. This is for Harry, and the rest of the wizarding world, Madam Pomfrey. I can’t risk it.”
“I am glad I’m capable of the unthinkable.” Harry stated as she laid down and just fell asleep.
“You fell out of the bed, Harry. Are you alright?”
“I can g-give you n-names of D-death Eaters and w-where they a-are staying. I can tell you some of the plans that I overheard my father talking to the Dark Lord and other Death Eaters about. The only thing I don’t know about is what they’ve been talking about since school started, but my mother might.” Malfoy breathed, and Harry nodded and took his erection back in her hand and brought him to completion. He arched his back and screamed as he released.
“But sir if you know where all the Death Eaters are planted and living currently, why don’t you do something about them?”
“Did you ever think about becoming a professional Quidditch player?” Draco asked.
Alright so i know i posted a chapter last night but i just got a really bad review for this fic on my other site about me pairing Hermione with Ron, and i just want to post another chapter because i can. if you have problems with anything that is wrong with this fic i'll be glad to hear it but if it something as bashing my story because i put a canon ship in my story you can shut your mouth and not say anything, because i don't care if you don't like it. if you don't like it don't read it, but honestly i just put it in there because i might pair them i haven't actually written anything in this fic that actually supports that pairing. i will write what i want and don't right me a long ass review on how i don't have that many followers on my page because i pair Hermione and Ron. they aren't even the focus of my story. so if anyone wants to comment on my pairings i don't want to hear it. it's cruel and you're just being an asshole for saying it.
“Harry?” Draco forgot about Lupin and he was gone, he was standing in the doorway to his room staring at Harry. “Harry?” he questioned again.
“Can I see Ginny? In my head I haven’t seen her in nine months, and I need to see her.” Harry asked as he sat up and winced in pain a little bit.
“Touché, touché Draco she’s a keeper.”
“Yes, I didn’t have anywhere else to put it. I’ll go and get your clothes and be right back.” Harry pulled the cloak around her and stepped from the alcove, and she walked over to the table her and Draco were at before, and she picked up Draco’s trousers, pants, and vest, and her panties. She walked back to the alcove and pulled her cloak off and gave Draco his clothes.
“Do you want to go back down stairs, or do you want to stay up here and go to bed?” Draco asked, and Harkin glanced up at him.
“Yes. We were betrothed at a very young age. I wanted Draco to fall in love, but Lucius, of course, had a back-up plan. He had a contract with the Greengrass’; if Draco didn’t get engaged by 20, he is to marry their youngest daughter, Astoria, who will be 18 and just graduating from Hogwarts. Draco doesn’t know about this contract, and Lucius doesn’t know that I know, but I have tea with the main ladies of the Sacred Twenty-eight; Mrs. Greengrass is one of those women.”
“My sanctuary. Place your hand on this brick.” Narcissa said as she gestured towards a brick at eye level, five from the corner, and Harry did as directed. She felt a tingling sensation as Narcissa cast a spell, and the wall slowly started to move towards the corner.
Harry thought as Madam Malkin measured her and made a few uniforms for Harry. When they were finished, McGonagall walked them to Gringotts and took some money out of Harry’s account to turn into muggle money.
“It isn’t possible.” Voldemort walked forwards and dived into her mind and saw all of the dreams that were his memories. He knew of only one way that it was possible. Voldemort pulled his wand and pointed it at Harry, and she flinched and tried to escape. “I’m not going to hurt you.” he cast a spell and gasped as it bounced from Harry back to him. “You’re a Horcrux. My Horcrux. How is it possible?”
“Snape as in that traitor who has been torturing us for the past six months, Snape.”
“I don’t know.” Harry said as her brows furrowed together. “I’m not very good at chess. Ron tried to teach me when I first came into the wizarding world, but he gave up after our second year.” Harry explained.
“Can you feel them?” Hermione asked.
“Bloody hell. I can’t believe it. He actually got Potter to cooperate, has that ever happened?” she said as she walked up to the bed he was lying in.
“Yes, Mr. Potter. The ring had a curse upon it that would have killed him within a few weeks if I had not contained it and slowed its effects. He wanted to give you the most information that he could before he died, Mr. Potter.”
“Never mind, don’t want my own room.”
“What is this?”
“That may have worked if the Dark Lord never found out, but now that he does, he won’t do anything to sway Harry from his side. He will also move any remaining Horcruxes that he may have and keep them close.” Severus stated.
“Well, we’ll get that checked out as well.” Narcissa said as she turned away. “I will make an appointment. Don’t forget your protection spells.” She said as she disappeared around the corner. Draco slipped back into his room to find half-lidded emeralds staring at him.
“That’s fine Harry knows where to find me.” Sirius said.
“Yes, my Lord. Term doesn’t end for another week and a half.”
“How many are you planning on having me pop out, Draco?” Harkin asked.
“Of course, I am. Come sit with me?”
“Oh, of course.” Severus said, and they walked into the back room. Draco sat down on the couch and he placed his head in his hands. Narcissa sat down next to him and wrapped her arms around his waist.
“I’m mending. I’ll be better once the dark magic is out of my system.”
“I did not. She isn’t eating and taking care of our children. We both need to be at full power to help maintain each other. I had three plates when she has barely had half. I am looking out for her health, my health, and that of our children’s.” Draco argued.
Draco slid his hand down along Harry’s side, and between Harry’s legs; Draco gripped Harry’s newly reformed erection. “I can’t hear you, Harry. Speak up.”
“Because I need you. You are the way to help me, Draco.” Harking yelled, and Draco stuttered.
“That sounds great.” Ron said, only not as enthusiastically as Harry would have liked. Harry turned back to the window as Ron dropped out of the conversation, and he turned towards his sister. They broke into a small argument that Harry decided not to pay attention to. The time past quickly as they grew closer to Hogwarts and soon the cabin lights were turning on as it got darker outside. They changed into their school robes, and the train came to a stop at Hogsmeade station.
“Har, you look fine. Plus, I have a concealment charm hiding our children from anyone who doesn’t know. Okay?” Draco stated.
“Draco, if I am pregnant I am not ‘taking care of the problem.’ I’m going to keep it. With or without you or your parents.” Harry stated, and Draco just stared at her.
“Not a problem, Granger. Potter has been through a lot in the past few months, and I’m actually surprised that he decided to come back this year.”
“No, but the rest is between Draco and I.” Harry said.
“I love you, too, Harry.” Draco whispered back as he leaned forwards to kiss her lips before pulling back and going back to eating his food, smiling. Harkin did the same, and the rest of the people at the table started smiling as they continued to eat.
“So if he’s invaded Harry’s mind where does Harry go?”
“Luna, what can you tell us about Ravenclaw?”
“Well, you are welcome whenever you like, and anyone you wish to bring with you. I would also like to extend an invitation to our Christmas ball on the 24
Harry walked over and opened the door to see Andromeda standing there. “Harry, I’ve lived here for the past three months, I think it’s time for you to adapt the wards to let me and Teddy in. I know you don’t want anyone allowed access to your home other than you, but I think Teddy and I are the exception. Don’t you think?”
“You know I didn’t kill Bella, right?” Harry tried.
“What are you doing wandering the corridors, Mr. Weasley?” Severus questioned.
“Yes, Harry, I can. I just need you to get me this one thing before I have all the answers myself.”
“Better or worse than fantasy?” Harry whispered.
“It makes that love stronger, more profound. The bond makes it so you either kill each other because of your hatred for each other, or you fall in love and live forever with each other. Harry never hated you, Draco. He despised you at times and was extremely suspicious at others but I’ve never heard him say that he hated you. I guess I see that now. Ronald and I on the other hand have hated you, and I’m not sure how I feel about you right now or in the future, but I see that you will be a part of our lives whether or not we like it and I’m going to have to get over that and I can for Harry. But we have to do this to even have that future. Or at least try. Harry is in trouble, and if we don’t try we will lose him. Forever.” Hermione said as she stepped towards Draco and rested her hand on his wrist. “I know that you know that I don’t trust you, but this is Harry, and after how I’ve seen you two together if there is anything that I trust you with it is him. You are our only hope to get him back safely. While you two work on that Ron and I are going to try and find the Diadem. If it’s still here we will find it.” Hermione said as she backed out of the room taking Ron’s hand and pulling him with her.
“Tomorrow.”
“Yes, sir.” Draco stated, and he picked up his bag and Harkin’s as well, and the couple hurried out of the classroom. Draco kept the concealment charm up until they reached the Great Hall, and Harkin took his hand.
“No, I was never interested in vampires. I had no reason to learn about them, and our Defense classes haven’t exactly been complete. We learned about them third year with you, but not very in depth.”
“If treated properly, which I’m not sure if the Healers at St. Mungos know how to do. Fortunately, I do, but I need to talk to the Healer that was treating Harry and see what they have done to him in the first place, because that might conflict with the magic that I need to cast.”
“Well, I guess I am to lead you to your room.” Snape said as he turned and Draco started following him with Harry in tow.
“Fine, we’ll try this my way.” Draco said as he leaned forwards and latched onto Harry’s neck.
“Harry, I have a question for you.”
Potter.” He snarled the word miss, and Lucius bowed before leaving the room and the door shut behind him.
“She shares magic with you, my little dragon. Of course she is connected to you. You feel your other half, and when she is gone you don’t feel whole. I think I know how to make her better, and in return you. I’ll be right back.” Narcissa walked out of the room, and she walked down the hall to the room they had for Harry. She walked over to the wardrobe and shrunk it down along with the dresser and her trunk. She then walked over to the bed and cast a stability charm so Harry wouldn’t be disturbed. She then levied Harry off the bed and walked out of the room with Harry hovering behind her.
“I would very much not like you to bring your mother up just as we’re about to have sex it kind of kills the mood we were setting.” Harry whispered, and she watched Draco’s eyes widen and then blow out with lust. “That’s my boy.” Harry pulled him back down to kiss him, and he slipped his tongue inside her mouth, and Harry moaned around the organ causing Draco to stutter. Harry could tell Draco was losing his mind as she moaned underneath him, and she slipped her hands down his back and pulled his dress shirt from yesterday that they never changed out of and pulled it from his trousers slowly unbuttoning the buttons on the shirt as Draco attached his lips to her neck and started sucking and nipping at the skin right below her ear.
“What is going on here?” Narcissa’s voice echoed through the ballroom, and Draco looked up at his mother’s voice.
“Oh, look at how big he’s gotten. You need to bring him over more often, Harry. I’m going to miss him growing up.”
“What just happened?”
“Draco, what’s going on between you two, is all we want to know. You’ve been acting strange the last couple of days and it’s starting to freak us out a little. We care, but you’ve been giving us the turn around since we got back to school, and we’re concerned, that’s all.” Blaise said and then elbowed Pansy as she went to say something else that would probably ruin what Blaise had just fixed.
“I know.” Draco responded, and he took a deep breath, and as he released it the concealment charm dissipated. “Let’s get this over with. Do you want to sit at the Gryffindor table or the Slytherin table?” Draco asked.
“Now that Lucius is in Azkaban, Draco is the head of the Malfoy family. I have ensured our safety with the Aurors; stating that we weren’t involved with Lucius’ and Bella’s actions. They also are working with my new solicitor in getting all of the Malfoy accounts transferred into your name instead of your father’s, which you and I will be going through and seeing which ones we want to keep. I will also have to go through the house and vaults with the elves help to collect all of the dark objects and turn them over to the Aurors.”
“Merlin, I hated that woman, and to insult my mother right in front of me was the biggest mistake she ever made. And the Dursley’s faces were priceless as they watched her inflate like a balloon.”
“The Yule Ball in our fourth year. You took Pansy, and I took Astoria; I couldn’t take my eyes off of you most of the night, and I couldn’t help but get distracted while I danced with Astoria. I think she might have known, and she kind of let me off the hook. I went back to the dorm and went to bed around 10 pm, because I just couldn’t stand being at the dance watching you in your dress robes with Pansy anymore.”
“Draco, Harry. Dinner is on the table if you would join us, please,” Narcissa said through the door. Draco pulled away from Harry and looked to the door, and Draco undid the silencing charm and responded to his mother.
“What for, boy, I didn’t let you in.” Draco smirked as he went around the corner, and found a statue of Godric Gryffindor that he had never seen before, and he said the password. The statue moved backwards into the wall, and Draco stepped inside and watched as the door moved back into place behind him. Draco turned around and looked into the room, and he knew he was in the right place. The room reminded Draco of Harry so much, the room was red, gold, and silver, the bed spread was black with hints of green in them. There were posters for Puddlemere on the walls and magazines all over the floor. Draco walked over to Harry’s trunk and saw it was empty except for a few knickknacks, so Draco walked over to the dresser and started pulling out Harry’s close and putting them on the bed.
“But what if I’m no of that by the time I’m free.” Harry whispered again. “What if I’m used and filthy?” Narcissa’s head snapped up and forced Harry to look her in the eyes.
“Your mother is making a healer appointment for me.” well that saved him the trouble of having to figure out how to bring it up.
“Wow, Malfoy. You’re actually quite good.”
“I’m warming him up. It’s a side effect of the magic that was cast on him.” Draco said still eating, and Harry picked up another plate and continued eating, not saying a thing.
“I think I’m sick of waiting for Ron to come around, Hermione. Something happens and his faith in our friendship is shaken and he runs. I’m sick of waiting for him to come around and realize I was in danger and right all along.”
“Siri, you’re not going to cry, are you?” Harry asked.
“That diary was a Horcrux?” Ron said.
“Yes, before you killed him.”
“I think she will do fine. She doesn’t take shit, and I think she will hold her own rather well. We’ll see.” Narcissa stated. “But let’s not think about that right now. I want to talk about the wedding. I am planning for the wedding to be over Easter break. I know you will be just barely showing then, but it won’t be that hard to hide that. We’ll have a small party, and when you are older and out of school, we’ll have a proper wedding ceremony for you.” Narcissa stated, and Harry was about to comment, when Draco cut her off.
“Does it look like I care? Enjoy the moment and let go, Potter.” Malfoy said as the door banged open, and there stood Umbridge. Harry swore under her breath as Malfoy turned around, but stayed between Harry’s legs, resting his hands on the outsides of Harry’s legs. Harry kind of hid behind Malfoy, for she didn’t want to deal with Umbridge right now, and now that she was a she, she was shorter and Malfoy hid her pretty well as she stayed perched on the desk.
“Of course. It is something that you love, and you would be able to do it well, and you might be able to get onto the Holy Head Harpies’ team.” Draco smirked. “But it is getting late and we should be heading to bed.” Draco stated.
“Ah, the princess has to have her escorts back to her rooms, especially in her fragile stated I assume. Well, don’t let me hold you up.” Ron muttered, and he stepped aside. Harkin could feel Draco’s anger on top of her own, and she gripped his hand tighter, which he just squeezed back.
Draco turned and hugged Harry and whispered in her ear, “Just go with it.” Harry hugged him back and as he pulled away he swung her bag over his shoulder and placed it on her shoulders. Draco stepped back and said, “I’ll talk to you later.” His smirk spread across his face making Harry blush, and they both turned on their heels and walked in opposite directions to their own tables.
“Mate what’s going on with you and Malfoy?” Ron asked bluntly.
“We will find them. Tally.” Draco shouted the name of the elf, and there was a faint pop as the elf appeared in the room.
“I have an idea, but first, when you were a guy, had you ever been bottom with another guy before?”
“No, that was what we were talking about, I just wasn’t expecting you to say that.”
“Have a good rest of your night, and I hope Miss Potter and the baby are alright.”
“Let him figure it out. They are still young. Let them figure out the problem with having sex every chance they get. I learned the hard way, also in that very alcove. Tell the boy he was conceived in that alcove and he may never have sex again.”
“It is, Mr. Malfoy. Why do you suspect Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Weasley?” McGonagall asked as she turned towards Ron.
“How do you know about this stuff? Sorry, I know; that was phrased wrong. How do you know about this magic specifically? All Dark spells and magic is different depending on the caster and the user and the method the magic is applied to the victim. Sorry, I’ve been doing research on the Dark Arts. Professor McGonagall gave me permission to use the school’s library resources on the subject.” Hermione defended for Draco had given her a questioning look.
“Can I escort you back to Gryffindor tower?” he asked avoiding the question.
“It’s alright, Tally. I said try to go unnoticed, if you were seen it is fine I can deal with Weasley.” Draco said as he tried to comfort his elf. “Tally, can you do me one more favor? Keep me posted on Master Harry’s condition.”
“Mom, are you sure that this is a good idea, to still go on holiday. Father could find us, and since he is the one that you are running from.”
“So I’m a trophy now. Not a human being. I have no say.”
Rodolphus walked back to the table and came back with a sword. Rodolphus didn’t notice the swinging that Harry was forcing, and as soon as Rodolphus was close enough, Harry swung his legs up and around Rodolphus’ neck, turning him so he was facing away from Harry. Harry used his leverage to push Rodolphus down on his knees, but Rodolphus did something unexpected and brought the sword backwards and into Harry’s chest.
“He is perfectly safe there, Severus, I don’t know what your concern is. Why do you even care about the boy?”
“You think that is true don’t you.” Lupin said as he grabbed Draco’s arm and twisted it snapping the bone. Draco pushed the pain away, but he heard a blood curdling scream come from upstairs.
“Alright. Just be careful.” Sirius stated.
“Okay, I’ll do it. I don’t have anything to wear. Oh, Merlin. What am I going to do?” Hermione started freaking out.
When Draco was finally done, Harry released him and Draco plopped down on his bed next to Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry. The pair just laid there until there was a sudden pounding on the door. The two bolted upright, and they looked from each other to the door. “Draco, what are you doing in there? Unlock this door, right now. I will blow it open if I have to,” the voice of Lucius Malfoy echoed throughout the room as the two scrambled off the bed and started pulling their clothes back on. Draco was fully clothed and Harry just had his shirt left to pull on when the door blew off its hinges, and Harry quickly pulled his shirt back on before the dust cleared.
“Well, that sounds pleasant let’s hope that doesn’t happen.”
“First, Harry must change. Mipsy will take her to her room and show her a special gift that I got for her. Mipsy!” Voldemort shouted, and the elf appeared. “Take Harry up to her room and show her that special gift I got for her.”
“Have a great night.” Draco said as his friends stood to head to the Slytherin common room.
“Okay, well, honestly I just met you the other day, so for all I know you could have been involved. I’m sorry that I blamed you for that. I’m going to message some of my Auror friends to come and help me with this.” Tonks dragged Lucius out of the room and locked him in a closet.
“The first is that you were just stunned by the stasis that I put on Harry, and that he is still currently in his stasis safe and sound. The second option is what scares me and means that we have to move quickly to find the last Horcrux, because that means that the Dark Lord has taken over Harry’s mind and possibly his body. Unfortunately, if he has taken over Harry’s mind and only his mind we won’t know until he wakes.”
“I don’t know I wasn’t there for that meeting. Narcissa was very pregnant ready to give birth at any moment, and she was bed ridden. I tried to be at her side as much as possible.” Lucius said as they reached the gate, and he opened it. Nagini slithered up Harry and draped herself over Harry’s shoulders. Then they disapparated.
“I would have told poor Theo anyway if you hadn’t said anything. In fact, I’ll write him myself and see if he would like to join us for dinner tomorrow. Oh, and Draco, darling, you’ll be sitting at the head of the table.” Narcissa stated as she walked out of the room.
“I can see it in your eyes and the way you acted different all class. People don’t notice me, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t notice them. I notice everything, especially the way Zabini looked when Snape said that he’d be Harry’s partner for the rest of the term, and you’ll be with me.” That got Draco’s attention.
“Everything will be alright. I can help you with that, darling.” Narcissa stated. “But first I think we should finish our lesson about diner etiquette, and then we can discuss your pregnancy symptoms. Alright?” Narcissa said.
“When don’t you have to prove each other wrong?”
They walked into the dining room and Harry pulled Draco to the end of the table where he sat at the end and she sat next to him, placing her foot against his inner thigh. They both started placing food on their plates as Narcissa, Lucius, and Severus started at them, and Draco looked up at the same time Harry did to look at them.
“You know who they both are, and they are most definitely wizards. Remus taught DADA in third year and Sirius might be just as famous as I am not to mention he’s related to you, but you can’t tell anyone I’m in contact with him. He’s supposed to be off grid.”
“Were any of you allowed to be flying your brooms while Madam Hooch was off the hospital wing, because I know for a fact that no one was allowed to leave the ground?” The two boys’ heads drooped down not looking at the professor.
“I agree. Miss Granger, Miss Lovegood.” Severus said, and the pair left.
“Probably not, but I am mostly going to be paying attention to it in the morning before breakfast and at night after dinner. I will escort you to breakfast and then back up to your rooms after dinner. Can you deal with that?”
“Is it just not in this room or is it difficult to find in the room.”
“But because of that, I neglected you, my fiancée, and my other half. You look pale.” Draco said as he walked over and brushed his fingers over her cheek, and she leaned into his touch.
“No matter how much I would enjoy that, your mother would kill us if we didn’t at least make an appearance tonight.” Harkin stated and then pecked Draco’s lips, and she continued, “But that just means you can do whatever you want to me later, after we make our appearance.” She smirked, and then gently pulled out of Draco’s arms and walked out of the room with Draco right behind her. He caught up with her quickly given the high heels she was wearing, and he captured her hand in his as they walked down the hall together.
“Yeah, thanks, Molly.” Harry said as he pulled away, with Teddy still in his arms.
“Over Christmas holiday?”
“I just mean, you are pregnant. One I shouldn’t have yelled at you, it was the wrong reaction, stress isn’t good for the pregnancy, and I think you’ve had too much of that as it is. Two you’re sensitive. I’ve read up on pregnancies, and a woman’s body becomes sensitive to touch. I could touch you just right once, and you can be turned on. Not to mention, your emotions which explains your reaction to my father earlier, though completely justified. He had no right talking to you like that. He’s not someone that you trust, I know that, he knows that, or at least should, and he had no right. I’ll talk to him about that.” Draco stated, and Harkin smiled wider.
“House elves.” Harkin whispered hoarsely, and Draco, Melody and Hermione all looked down at her.
“I don’t know, but I’ll take her to St. Mungos.” Narcissa said as she cast a lightening charm and picked Harry up, and they carried her out of the garden and to the drawing room. Narcissa was grabbing floo powder when Lucius walked in with Severus behind him.
“Worse now that he has gotten up and walked around, he literally just drained all the energy that his body had been compiling while he slept, and he drained it out of his system. If he keeps this up he’s going to slip into a coma.”
“I don’t want you to go. Not yet. Please.” Harkin begged as she reached one of her hands out to the older man and brushed her fingers along his jaw. “I can’t lose both of you. After all of the good that has happened…” Harkin trailed off.
“I’ll take care of it, Tilly.” Lucius said and the house elf disappeared with a bow. “Stay here, I’ll be back.” Lucius walked away as Draco held Harry upright.
Sadly things sometimes have to get worse before they get better, and i mean it is Lucius what were you expecting.
“But if you would have let me finish, he will most likely gain most of it back, once he starts up where he left off, coming back in bits and pieces. That is the good news, Granger.” Hermione looked over and a smile slipped onto her face.
“What happened to Harry?” Neville asked and Draco looked up at him.
“I find it strange that its the day back from break, you and Weasley come back after not being here all year, but Draco doesn’t.”
“It’s Harry, Madam Pomfrey; I, uh, spilled the potion on him. Professor Snape wanted me to give you this.” Neville said as he handed her a piece of parchment, and she took it and read it over and then looked up at Harry with wide eyes.
“Oh, this can’t be good. She is still rather early in her pregnancy. I will stabilize her, and then send for her regular healer. I sadly don’t specialize in pregnancy, given I work at a school full of children.” Madam Pomfrey stated, and she cast a few more spells before hurrying back to her office.
“But you were a death eater?” Sirius stated.
“Yes, please.” Draco whispered.
They then walked out of Dragon Alley and into Muggle London, and Hermione dragged them around to the best muggle shops. Their first stop was a shoe store, because Harry’s feet were much smaller than they normally were and his feet were flopping around in them, hurting his feet. They ended up getting a pair of dress shoes for his uniform, a pair of converse, a few pair of ballerina flats, and a low pair of heels. The next store that the went to were for bras, which Harry didn’t like at all, but after realizing what it did was fine with the contraption; they also bought some knickers there for him.
Snape said, “Harry, we don’t have much time to explain. Dumbledore will be here tomorrow night with the order to get you out of here. Lucius and I can’t break cover just yet, but once you are safe we will. Just try and stay out of trouble until then please.” If Harry didn’t know the Professor better she would have thought he was begging for her to be safe.
“I understand. I didn’t plan any of this, I promise you Narcissa.” Harry whispered, and Narcissa pulled her closer to her. Harry was almost sitting in her lap.
“That is wonderful, Dobby. I do need your help, Dobby. You see your old master is trying to hurt me again, he's poisoned my food and I know that you would never do anything of the sort, you would protect me, so I would like to request for you to make my meals for me until Lucius is caught you see. We just want to make sure he can’t hurt me or the babies again. Do you understand?” Harkin stated.
“What does that mean, Remus? I don’t understand.”
“Alright, look in, on, under and around everything. It could be anywhere.” All the teachers started moving, and Hermione grasped McGonagall’s wrist before she could go far. “What do you mean somethings up with Harry?”
“No, I take it back; that is barbaric.” Hermione stated.
“It must be the way that your cores are combined.” Severus stated as he started pacing back and forth in the study. “It’s interesting the way that your bond is constructed. I can’t believe that I created this bond, granted it wasn’t supposed to be a bond, but this is amazing. I just can’t believe that this is possible.”
“No, that is not a problem, Cissy. I was just making sure it wasn’t a problem for you. I’m glad to hear that you are alright with your only son and heir being gay. You have come a long ways, Cissy since we were young and naïve.” Andromeda smiled at Narcissa and then at Draco and Harry. Draco sat back down on the couch next to Harry and pulled him closer. “Do you still want three rooms or do you want two rooms?” she joked. Harry looked over at Draco and then at Narcissa, and then Harry looked down to the floor. Harry knew there was no way that Narcissa was going to actually allow him and Draco to share a room officially.
Severus walked to the Great Hall where he dissolved the wards around the room and stepped through the doors to find all of the students and teachers still in the room, but everyone turned at the sound of the doors opening. “I want all of the Heads of Houses to escort your students back to their common rooms and make sure no one is to leave or exit unless accompanied by a Head of House. This is to be enforced and not a minor issue. Hogwarts is in danger, and not by some monster, it is by someone who is more dangerous than everyone in this room combined. So I advise students not to go against these orders and I wish for the teachers to take this into account as they take their students to their common rooms. The teachers are then to find their way to Professor McGonagall’s office. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger if you will accompany me to Professor McGonagall’s office as well as Miss Lovegood.” Severus said as he stayed standing in the doorway, and Ginny Weasley stood up with her brother and Hermione as they made their way to Severus. “Miss Weasley, you are to go with Professor McGonagall to your common room.”
“Not that much.”
“I’m your second half now, Harry. You trust me naturally because no matter what happens I will always be there for you. And I am going to make sure that you are never treated like that again. You are everything to me. I will protect you with my life, you are mine, now and forever, Harry James Potter.”
“Yes, Minerva. He is tied to Draco’s life force and vice versa. If Draco dies Mr. Potter dies. If Mr. Potter dies Draco dies. If Draco lives Mr. Potter lives. If Mr. Potter lives Draco lives. Anything that happens to Mr. Potter happens to Draco, and lastly if anything happens to Draco it happens to Mr. Potter.” Severus stated. “Though there bond is rare because Draco can live without just having to drink from Mr. Potter to survive if he wishes.”
Draco relaxed against the bed and Narcissa sat down on the side of the bed next to him and looked him in the eyes. “She will be fine as long as you get better as well. Severus said that there might be a side effect that might affect you magic and health, if either of you are injured or sick.”
Now they were at the summer before their sixth year at Hogwarts, and Harry and Draco were finally together. Though, now Harry had doubts about his relationship with Draco once again. Why couldn’t Draco just act consistent like everyone else? Why did this have to be so difficult?
“Please tell me that came from your allowance?”
“Thank you, Professor.” Malfoy said as he bowed slightly, and he turned towards Harry and took her hand, pulling her from the room. They followed Umbridge from the room, and they went in opposite directions. Malloy pulled Harry up the stairs, and Harry tried to ask questions, but Malloy wouldn’t answer any of her questions.
Harry wanted to respond but he couldn’t remember how to respond, because Draco’s hand was still holding his erection, and Draco must have realized that Harry was having a hard time thinking at all at this moment, because he suddenly let go of Harry. Harry slid down the shower wall and sat on the floor. “This is why I can’t talk to you about what I am thinking, Dray. I have a hard time thinking around you period. Especially, now that I’ve seen you naked and felt you in me and around me. Dray, I’m an awful mess, when you are around me. Why do you think I locked myself in here, away from you? I needed to think, Dray. I needed to figure out if this was real or if I was going to regret going to this relationship with you. I needed to have thinking time, and lately I haven’t been the best of thinker, and I figured it out today, when you hugged your mother. I don’t know what made me figure it out at that moment, but I realized that I was starting to doubt our relationship and I was wondering why that was, and I realized that this is the first time in a couple of days that you weren’t touching me or near me, and I just had to get away, and sort myself out before I talked to you about what was going on.” Harry paused and Draco started talking before Harry could continue.
“I will have the house elves prepare two rooms for you.” Lucius said as they passed, Harry turned and mouthed, ‘I’m sorry,’ to Lucius as Nagini dropped from Voldemort’s shoulders to slither behind them.
“Minerva, how nice of you to drop by. I assume you got my letter.”
“Because I’m a freak. I’ve always been a freak. It started when my parents died and I survived the killing curse. It continued when Dumbledore left me on the steps of my aunt and uncle, and I started experiencing accidental magic. And progressed as the beatings and abuse progressed, and then I found out that I was a wizard and everything got better. At least until school ended, and I went back to my aunt and uncle’s house. Everything got worse from there, and then this happened. I’m a freak, Draco, and nothing can change that.” Harkin whispered as she tucked her face against Draco’s chest, and Draco lifted her chin so she was looking at him.
“I’ve been better. Where am I?” Harry asked as he looked around the room and his eyes landed on Draco. “Malfoy?” Draco could see as the confusion spread across his face, and Draco knew that Harry didn’t remember the last few days.
“In all of the books you have read Hermione, you have never read one about vampires?”
“Draco, I’m tired.” Harkin whispered as she took Draco’s hand to pull his attention away from Ron, which worked, and Draco was looking back at her, which also drew Ron’s attention to her as well.
“He will be once we make sure that the Dark Lord can’t return. Narcissa they can stay here until that is done correct.”
“Well, this would be so much easier if Severus was here to explain, but I will try. Severus created a potion to remove a horcrux from a living thing. You know what a horcrux is, right?”
“Not needed. The question is where would she go with her and how long do we have?”
“Well, as you may know from experience, at a young age it is difficult to keep your hands off your partner. Well, your father wasn’t coming back to school with me, and he was just starting to officially court me. We were both nervous about the other being unfaithful, and the week before I left for school your father invited me to France with him. He told my parents that his father was coming with us, and we were going to be locked on our own rooms. It turned out it was just going to be the two of us. We had a marvelous time, and he brought me back so I could leave for school.”
“Weasley.” Draco drawls.
“I think we better be going and getting Lucius to take you to the Ministry.” Voldemort said as he stood up and took Harry’s hand and pulled her from the room. They went and found Lucius sitting in the dining room eating diner. “Lucius, I have a task for you. I require you to take Harry to the Ministry so she can complete her task. I want you to make sure she gets in and out without a problem.” Lucius stood and bowed the Voldemort.
“How did you know that I tortured him?”
“Draco and I are good. We aren’t hungry right now, Narcissa,” Harry yelled through the door.
“Alright.” Narcissa smiled. “So the first thing that you should know is to work from the outside in. Soup spoon, salad fork, dinner spoon, dinner fork, and dinner knife. The dessert spoon and fork are up here. Your bread plate and butter knife are above your dinner fork. Glasses from the inside out: water glass, champagne glass, red wine glass, white wine glass.”
“No, I didn’t really look around much. Though I find that nice of them to give us a room with a nursery for the twins.” Harkin said as she rubbed her small baby bump. “Is it weird to say that I feel if this would have happened in the muggle world, I would have been judged just a little bit more for having kids while still in school?”
“Harry, if you weren’t my best mate, I’d be all over you. You’re smoking hot, Harry.”
“You have an appointment with our healer at 1 this afternoon. Healer Johnson is amazing and very discrete. She is probably the only one outside of the family that’s seen Draco’s…”
“I am concerned about the baby given the circumstances, so I want to see her every other Saturday. I figured that would be the best day.”
“Sev, please, don’t. It won’t help the situation and I don’t want to press charges. I just want to go and lie down, please.” Harkin stated, and Severus bowed his head.
“Thank you, Draco. That would be excellent. I would love to go on holiday. Thank you.” Harry’s face lite up as he pulled away from Draco, and that’s when Draco realized why he wanted to be friends with Harry in the first place. Draco loved Harry, and loved watching his face light up when he got excited about something that he’s never had. Draco remembered the first time that Harry stayed at his house over the summer.
“No, Harry, you listen. I am not going anywhere. I love you, and I’m going to have you in my life for as long as I can possible manage. You cannot change that, and you are not going to try and change that. Understand, Harry? Because every time that you start to doubt or think about leaving me, and I’m hoping that this is the last time, I will do something like this to convince you that you can’t run from your problems all the time Harry. You need to learn to face your problems head on and talk them out sometimes. This isn’t like all your other problems Harry. Defeat the bad guy and just walk away. Everything will be peachy. Not this time. You need to actually talk to me about what you are thinking, Harry, that is the only way that this is going to work. I can’t be trying to figure out what is going through your mind and deal with what is going through mine at the same time, love.” Draco spun Harry around, so he could face him. “Do you understand what I am telling you, Harry?”
“You don’t want to come?” Draco’s voice went flat almost sad, and Harry couldn’t stand to see that look on his best friends face.
“You can call me Narcissa, dear, and no. The Dark Lord was always Lucius’ thing. I had some of the same views, but I changed after Draco was born. But I will support my husband until he comes to the same conclusion. I never wanted Draco to grow up like he did and still is, but he’s changed since your accident. I haven’t seen him, but I can tell from his letters. He seems happier and better, more open with his emotions, which is how I wanted to raise him.” Narcissa whispered and the she opened the door and they walked out of the bathroom. Nagini was curled up waiting for them an as soon as the door to the bedroom opened they were walking down the hall with Nagini leading the way. They went down what felt like three flights of stairs before the entered a huge ball room.
“Thank you, sir. Good night.”
“What’s the matter?” Draco asked as he brushed her hair behind her ear.
Harry rolled over and into Draco’s side. “Draco, it’s alright. I have known your father for a few years now; I think I understand how your father can be, Dray,” Harry stated and then went quiet, and Draco knew the look that he had on his face, like he wanted to say something else but wasn’t sure if it was alright if he said it or not.
“Yeah, I assume, Hermione filled you in. Why? What’s happened in the past five months? I remember very little.” Ginny leaned back in and kissed him again. She pulled back this time right away, and she snuggled into Harry’s shoulder.
“No, don’t. You’re going to be a little sore, and I’m not the right person to tell you what happened, so I’m going to go and get Madam Pomfrey, and she can explain this to you. Alright? I’ll be right back.” Draco let go of Harry’s hand and he walked over to Madam Pomfrey’s office and knocked. “She’s awake, and I don’t know how to tell her what happened.”
“Have I liked you?”
“And the paternity?” Narcissa asked.
“Already taken care of. My father is taking my mother on a second honeymoon of sorts to the Bahamas so I will be staying at Hogwarts for the holidays unless otherwise asked by other parties.”
“You. Don’t find her, Ron; Hermione does.” Luna said. “I would have had Harry do it because everyone likes Harry, but given our predicament, Hermione is the best option. Sorry, Ron, but you just don’t have a very likable personality.”
“Alright, you will probably get a letter from the Ministry, but since they don’t know where you are it will probably come here.”
Madam Pomfrey looked at the list and she started going through the list and making changes and marking spells off and writing new ones down. Draco watch Harry while Madam Pomfrey retreated back to her office to work through the list. Harry’s eyes would flutter open every once in a while to close again right away. The spells were working faster than Draco intended, and they needed to work faster than anticipated.
“She’s three weeks pregnant.”
“So, Potter is raising my cousin’s son?”
“Wait, Harry’s been captured.”
“What? When I first approached you, this is not what I had planned. Yes, I fancied you, but I never expected this to happen. I originally just wanted your help with getting rid of the Dark Lord and making sure Mother and I made it out alive and not in Azkaban. This just kind of happened, and that also doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t have asked you out when you were a guy, because I might have, eventually. I honestly don’t know what would have happened because it didn’t happen this did.” Draco defended himself.
“It isn’t about whether either of us can dance; it is about making the other person feel better. Sirius was always the one who could dance, and he would always parade me around the dance floor, spinning and dipping and everything else that he could do, and it would make me laugh. That’s what dancing is really about. Making sure your partner is having a good time. Even in school when we would have a dance, and Siri and I weren’t even technically together, but James knew we would end up together, Siri would always parade me around the dance floor. Because he would see me sitting in the corner of the room, by myself, because James would have a date and so would Siri, and Peter,” Remus took a deep breath at the mention of their ex-best friend’s name, and then continued, “Peter would never go, because he didn’t like dances too much.”
Harry and Draco have been friends since Harry decided to accept Draco’s friendship before the sorting at Hogwarts, and Harry ended up being sorted into Slytherin during the sorting in their first year. Harry ended up not being friends with Ron because of the sorting and Ron and Hermione never became friends, though now that they are now in their sixth year everything might change for everyone.
“No, that’s not the first time that someone has had rough sex with me. I was upset the first time because it hurt like a bitch, but after the fifth time it was quite enjoyable. If you want me to be upset I could but I’d rather not because I’m not.”
“Lucius, why are you doing this? Please not in front of our guest, can you talk to him in the morning either after or before breakfast, please,” Narcissa begged.
“Yes, Siri. I was gardening in a dress.” Harkin said and smiled bigger.
“What? Why? Mother!” Draco said as he started to get out of the bed.
What Andromeda said had made up Harry’s mind, so he walked over to the desk that currently in his bedroom while he was fixing the rest of the house. While Harry was renovating his bedroom and attached study were under construction. Harry started with the fourth floor, which is why it’s the only livable floor of the house. Harry sat at his desk and pulled out a quill and some parchment to write Minerva a letter.
“I’m sorry, Love. I didn’t want to do it, but she just wouldn’t leave if I flat out tell her that I’m with someone. I want to say that I won’t do it again, but first of all we both know that it will, and second now she will be bound and determined to figure out who I’m with.” Draco explained. “I’m so sorry, Love.” Draco kissed the base of Harry’s neck and kissed his way up to Harry’s jaw, while still slowly thrusting into Harry.
Draco doesn’t know how long he laid their just staring at her, before she started to stir, and when her eyes fluttered open, and she smiled up at him. “Hey, how are you feeling, love?”
“Of course, though you should stop doing that as well. Food is fuel, fuel makes your magic more stable.” Severus stated.
Draco then quickly made work of his trousers, and he slipped inside her. She released a gasp as he seated completely inside her, and she sucked her bottom lip between her teeth as her eyes fluttered closed. “Mmm…Dray…” she moaned, and Draco pulled out and thrust back in, and he set a moderate pace. Harkin dug her nails into Draco’s shoulders, and her legs wrapped around his waist and legs.
They walked down to the Great Hall like that running into none of their classmates for everyone was already at lunch. When they walked into the Great Hall everyone turned to look at them as Draco walked Harry over to the Gryffindor table and only let go of her after she sat down between Ron and Hermione, and then he walked over to the Slytherin table and sat down between Pansy and Blaise. Hermione’s eyes followed Draco all the way over there and then stared as Ron did the opposite and stared with his mouth hanging open at Harry.
“Mione had a time turner third year. It’s how she got to all of her classes, and how we broke you out of the tower while saving Buckbeak.” Harkin stated then froze. “Oops.”
“So, you’ve been awake this whole time?” Melody asked.
Draco stood on the other side of the door with his palms against the door along with his forehead. “Dragon, you are going to be in a lot of pain if you stay like that.”
Harry thought as Neville escorted him up to the Hospital Wing as he apologized over and over to Harry. Finally, Harry stopped and placed his slightly smaller hands on Neville’s shoulders. “Neville, please stop apologizing. There was nothing you could have done to stop this from happening. It was a small mistake that might just change my life forever. You grabbed the wrong ingredient and accidently put it in. No one knew this was going to happen. We can’t change it now, but we can hope Madam Pomfrey can. Just please stop apologizing.” Harry stated in his slightly higher voice.
“Well, that makes it even better. Mother can do your fitting and then dress you up to the nines for the grand opening. It’s at night, right?” Draco questioned.
“I will continue to put it in your food whether you eat it or not. So eat.”
Alright, so if anyone has read chapter four, i want to advise you to make sure you read the right chapter for i had a tiny chapter mix up. i have it fixed now though. there will be possible triggers in this chapter. i do have a picture of a dress that Harry wears in this chapter, i felt it would be something Narcissa would pick out for a ball for female Harry.
“It isn’t, dear. I plan parties. That is really all I do, other than tend to the gardens. I do a New Year’s party, a Valentine’s Day party, a National day, and Easter, Halloween, and Christmas.”
“How do you know I was in London? I didn’t tell you where I was going, and you shouldn’t know where I went anyway the place is under a Fidelius Charm.” Harry stated confused.
“I just wanted to check in with how you’re doing with all of the life changes in the past couple of months?” Narcissa asked.
Luna stopped in front of Severus and said, “You better just let her, even if Harry isn’t the same and Draco is his…friend now, she won’t listen to you, she has to find out on her own it is the best option.” She then continued past. Severus turned on his heels and followed. When he reached McGonagall’s office he found Draco crouched next to Harry’s body growling at everyone in the room.
“Did you get fuck your first time?” Harry asked the second question because he wanted to know more about Draco.
“It’s a guess. The Dark Lord’s greatest fear is his death, it’s logical. I know of one he had as does Albus, and Potter was the one to destroy it.”
“Okay, and what does my potion have to do with it?”
“Yes, they came with the paperwork she requested for her name change.”
“Now, Harry, I don’t have a problem with half-bloods, because I’m a half-blood as well, and muggleborn aren’t as bad as their parents are they have magic in their line somewhere it’s just way back. I have a problem with muggles, and I know that you do too, given your relatives and their treatment of you.” he said and stepped closer to Harry.
“You can do that?” Hermione questioned.
“You’d be surprised, Potter, who you let in when you think they’re your friends. Polyjuice is a wonderful invention. I want to thank whoever it was who invented it.”
“Ah, Potter. You are finally awake to endure my torture. I’m sorry I got a little spell happy while you were asleep and started already. I hope you don’t mind.”
“Everything will be alright, dragon. Harry is a strong woman, and she will pull through.”
“Where you the one that blew open the front door?” Harry asked as he glared at the front door of his uncle’s house. Draco turned around and looked at the door.
“You’re a woman now, Potter. I can do things to you and make you feel things that you wouldn’t imagine in your wildest dreams.”
“No, that isn’t Harry.” Severus said.
“No, I guess I cannot, but I am still the Minister, Mr. Malfoy.” Fudge said as he stood up and walked towards Draco.
“Harry wouldn’t have a reason to have her things? What if it was Harry? Where ever she is maybe she has access to house elves, and maybe she sent for her things.” Draco suggested, and everyone turned to him. “What? It is a valid idea.”
“I know, and he can’t hide forever, Dray. He will be found, and he will pay for everything that he has done.” Harkin stated, and Draco nodded.
“The Weasley’s and them being able to live and survive this war without losing anyone and still being the family that they have always been after they find out what I’ve done in here and out there.” Harry pushed every motherly and fatherly moment that he had shared with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past seven years. Every moment with the twins, with Bill, Bill’s wedding, the few moments with Percy.
Harry started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, but Draco had the same idea because he pulled Harry’s shirt off over his head and then he just pulled his own over his head. They went back to kissing as soon as their shirts were off, and Harry reached up and intertwined his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling him closer to him. Draco opened his mouth as Harry slipped his tongue into his mouth, and Draco groaned as Harry’s tongue was exploring his mouth. Harry pulled away suddenly and looked Draco in the eyes as a small whimper escaped Draco’s lips.
Harry quickly sat down at the table next to Hermione and started piling food onto her plate, and she could feel the entire Gryffindor table’s eyes on her, but she didn’t care about them; it was the eyes across the hall that she knew belonged to Draco Malfoy that she was smiling about. She could feel the blush rising in her cheeks as Ron trying to get her attention. Finally, she caved and whipped towards Ron and said, “Yes, Ronald.” And Ron stopped and stared dumbfounded at Harry. Harry immediately started laughing at the look on his face.
“Yes, it would, but enough about that for now. I think we should get to some gardening, some of these plants do like their attention at a certain time.” Narcissa said as she grabbed her pair of gardening gloves, and Harkin grabbed hers, after she grabbed a pair of gardening coveralls from the cupboard to cover her dress. Narcissa and Harkin spent the rest of the morning in the garden, and when lunch came around, Narcissa and Harkin stood and walked out of the garden exactly like they had when they walked in. They made their way to the dining room and found everyone already at the table.
Draco turned and stunned the snake and then hovered it off the ground and out of the room. Draco took it down to the potions lab in the dungeons and extracted the venom that he needed for his potion; he then sent the snake back up to its master and away from him before it woke up. Draco started on the very complex potion and followed Severus’ directions to a tee and being extremely careful in doing so. After a few hours in the potions lab Draco’s potion was almost complete, and Draco was done. He just needed to make two more potions before he was done, and he needed to make sure he didn’t mix them up.
“No, she said I wasn’t allowed to talk about it, and I won’t tell. Good night.” Draco said pointedly, and then he walked away and up to his room with Harkin. He walked in to find her curled into his sheets, and he walked over and stripped down to his pants. Then he curled into the bed next to her, and he found she took a shower for her hair was damp and sprawled wildly around her. “You know I can braid your hair if you wish.” Draco smiled, and she lifted her head slightly to look at him.
“Plus you have that time he blew up his aunt before third year. Wandless magic.”
“Well, that’s not exactly true. I have kissed people before just not like this, and it’s not like I never wanked. Though it would be different now since I don’t have a penis.” Harry said bluntly, and Draco chuckled.
“So, my insane aunt has her. My apologies, Mother.” Draco added.
Hermione kneel down on the floor and brushed Harry’s hair away from his face. Harry’s eyes fluttered open, and they met Hermione’s concerned ones. “’Mione, what happened?”
“Did she tell anyone about the dreams other than you two?”
“Yes, I figured if we didn’t have to worry about packing, we could spend some more time together. Since I spent so much time going through my father’s accounts since Christmas.”
“I thought you were gardening.” Draco stated, and then pulled Harkin in for a kiss.
“All right, Potter, but when you find out who you’re bunking with you can’t yell at me.”
“Raped?” Everyone turned to see Draco standing in the open doorway, his hand still on the door handle. “Twice?”
“I was gabbing you in my sleep with my elbow. I’m sorry, Dray,” Harry apologized as he rested his head back on Draco’s shoulder, and he stared down Draco’s abdomen, avoiding looking at Draco. “I was having a nightmare last night, about the day my parents were murdered, again. I didn’t realize that I was disturbing your sleep, Dray.” Harry started to roll away from Draco and started to move to get off the bed when Draco caught his arm and pulled Harry back towards him.
Harry felt his lips against her neck, and she moaned at the touch as his fingers wound into her hair, pulling her head back to access her neck better. Harry moaned again, and Draco rolled them to the side so he was on top of her. “Mmm…Dray.” Harry moaned as she fed her fingers into his hair, and Draco continued ravishing her neck as he had one hand pinned under Harry’s lower back and the other was entangled in her hair at the back of her head. Draco rolled his hips accidently pressing his budge to Harry’s thigh causing him to moan and her to gasp. “Ah…Dray.” Harry moaned as Draco slid his hand on her lower back into her pajama bottoms grasping her ass. Harry gasped again and her hands briefly tightened in his hair.
“I didn’t feel it was necessary Dolores, for the investigation into who is behind this is left up to Professor McGonagall, seeing as the student is from her house. The incident will be handled.”
“So you trapped us in the bathroom.”
“Yeah, you want me to stay.”
“You’re eating like it’s the end of the world, Hermione.” Seamus said as he walked up to the table. Hermione stood up and gave him a lose hug.
“S-south.” Draco stuttered.
“I found them.” She heard Draco shout from behind her, and she visibly flinched and bowed her head as she placed her face in her hands. Draco froze as he saw his father standing there talking to Harkin. “Oh, hello, father, I didn’t see you there.” Draco stuttered.
Annie, I went out to get supplies, Teddy was still asleep when I left so I put him in your room so he hasn’t been feed yet. I’ll be back soon, so don’t worry. Harry He then added in invisible ink: Annie, Rodolphus Lestrange has me. Get help, he’s going to kill me. Harry
“No, it’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.” Draco said as he kissed her on the lips pulling her closer. Harry pulled away a little, and looked into Draco’s silver eyes.
When Harkin woke up, she was rather warm, and she turned to find Draco wrapped around her and something poking her in the hip. She was about to try and move away from Draco when he moaned and his hips thrust against her own, and she realized exactly what was poking her in the hip and why it was so warm in the room.
“You aren’t the only one.”
“No, I don’t deserve you, my raven.” Draco whispered. “Let’s go to bed, you must be tired.” Draco whispered as he stood up, keeping her in his arms, and he carried her up to his room. When he got to his room, he placed Harkin on their bed, and he pulled her shoes off before tucking her into bed. Draco was about to walk away when Harkin reached out and grabbed his arm.
“Ow. What the hell, Snape?” Harry snapped and the white dress started blowing around her along with her hair, and everyone was staring at her. “Seriously, I want answers. What the hell did you do to Draco and me? Why did you do it? What did you think was going to happen? And anything else that might come to that greasy head of yours.” Harry shouted with her magic just bellowing off of her in waves. Draco stood up and wrapped his arms around Harry, and she calmed down a tad. Draco could tell she was still seething.
“Mr. Potter isn’t in trouble, Mr. Malfoy, and neither are you, Mr. Malfoy.” They both looked up at Snape and stared at him.
“Oh, darling, they plan themselves. I really just set up a layout for the ballroom. It’s rather easy, really. For Valentine’s Day party I usually do a theme, but other than that the parties are rather simple. Then of course there’s the scared twenty-eight tea parties I told you about.”
“Well, Granger can’t come in here, and I was coming in anyway, so she asked me to check on you while I was in here. You’ve been in here for most of the feast and it’s now over, so she’s freaking out.” Harry sighed as he tried to get up and leaned into the wall as he couldn’t stand up right.
“Then why do you like me now?” Harkin asked.
Harry placed her hands on top of the ones that were wrapped around her, and she pulled them back around her and twisted to face him. “What are you doing, Malfoy?”
Malfoy grabbed her upper arm and pulled her back into the room. “No, I want to know. How do you know what the Slytherin common room looks like?”
“Yes, thank you.” Narcissa said as she wrapped her arm around Draco’s waist and guided him towards Healer Johnson’s office. Narcissa opened the office door for Draco, who shuffled past and placed Harry on the couch as Lucius and Severus walked in the room with Healer Johnson following them in.
“Albus?” McGonagall asked as she turned towards the man.
“So what name did you decide on to be your new name?” Narcissa asked.
“I’ve just gathered the ingredients. Snape doesn’t let me actually start putting the potion together unless someone is helping me.”
“Yes, but it wasn’t his fault. His father was an abusive arse, and I’m 100 percent sure that Thaddeus beat him. Theo did it to save his life.” Harkin defended. “And given my past I would be a hypocrite not to forgive him.” Harkin finished.
“Dray, what does this make us? What are we now?” Harry contemplated as he gave a questioning look to Draco.
“We were captured by a bunch of Snatchers, and they realized who I was even though our best abilities of hiding it. We were then taken to this house well it wasn’t really a house it was a manor. It was an extravagant manor too, even though I was being taken to my death. We were dragged into the house, and I was placed in front of this rather tall and skinny boy with rather pale blonde hair and pale skin in comparison. He looked me as to confirm who I was, but he wouldn’t say that it was me even though I know he knew it was me as his silver eyes looked deep into mine. Then my memory went blank.” Harry said as he leaned forwards so their noses were almost touching.
“Mr. Potter was Mr. Malfoy’s first? But firsts are…”
“Just you, Draco. Just you,” Harry said with disappointment rushing through his words. Draco just stared at Harry, and he reached for Harry’s hand and pulled him up and out of the cupboard.
“Father, what is it? What’s going on?” Draco questioned as he looked at his father, just standing in the doorway. Lucius was staring at Draco and then his eyes zoomed over to Harry sprawled across Draco’s bed, and his eyes narrowed.
