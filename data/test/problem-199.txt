“Then you have the transformation of perception. You see that, there? What they’re sacrificing? On the altar? They’re supposed to represent sensory perception. Sound – the cymbals – sight, touch, taste, smell. Etc. The individual is being freed from the material.”
He turned around, his face bare. “What I want is so simple. So very simple. We can pretend it isn’t, but it is. We can pretend this is about me, but it’s about you, Harry.”
“Hi,” said Draco. He was looking all over Harry, up and down the length of him, across his face. Harry tried to remember what he was wearing and couldn’t.
The next day, Harry climbed up the mountain himself. The walk was hard in the heat, sweat dripping down his forehead and gathering under his arms, but the view was beautiful.
All of a sudden, Harry couldn’t stand it. He sat up. The room was spinning. He grasped the mattress, gasping. Were the walls concaving?
“Thanks, Osh,” Harry said tiredly. He was looking at where Malfoy was still making muffled noises. When he managed to lift his head, he took one look at the lettering on the tank, and bit down on his lip. Hard.
Sometimes it was not even pain. It was more a feeling of not fitting right, of not belonging, of constant discomfort. He had thought his life was wrong, and so he had changed it. But it was not his external life, it seemed.
In his defence, the altitude was different here. All crazy. It wasn’t his fault he’d forgotten to breathe.
“Malfoy,” says Harry that night, twirling a lock of white hair between two fingers. They’re splayed across each other, the leftover lumos from Harry’s wand illuminating the sweat glistening over their skin. “Draco,”
Harry looked over again, to where Malfoy was hitting Oceania’s shoulder with the tea cosy as she held him down like a wrestler. He felt an abrupt wave of – not fondness. But rather, an acknowledgement. An acknowledgement of the fact that there was something just a little wonderful about Gay Dragon Village and all that it encompassed.
“Fuck,” she says, after a couple breathless heartbeats. She slides back out slowly. “That was fast.”
“Well, don’t hold it in,” muttered Draco, over the sound of clattering. “I wouldn’t want you to strain your poor Gryffindor soul.”
“You tore me apart,” says Malfoy, breathing heavily. “You ripped up my skin. Now I’m going to rip up yours.”
When he opened them, Jane was swallowing the meat, her wings flapping a little as it disappeared down her scaled throat. He looked over his shoulder, and Malfoy was smiling, just a little, in the corner of his mouth. His eyes met Harry’s.
Inside the room, Harry took off his jacket and put it on the bed. He was acutely aware of the sweat drying on his neck.
“It’s…” Harry ran a hand over his hair. The words he was about to say played over and over in his head. He had never thought he would say them. He had never thought he would be able to.
“Then I should apologise too,” he said, finally looking back up at Harry. “I also shouldn’t have said what I did.”
At least, Harry felt this way. He had been brave, but he was not brave anymore. Or perhaps, there was more than one type of bravery. It was one thing, he felt, to be brave during war; something else, completely, to be brave in the day to day. The kind of bravery he needed now was a more personal strand.
Harry nodded and then lit his. He passed it to Oceania. “You’re going to want to take slow hits first,” she said, smiling at him.
Potter keeps on coming back. It messes with Draco’s tea-making routine. The water takes longer to boil. She keeps running out of milk.
“What?” Harry glanced around at the pulsing purple lights, flooding the lengths of the walls and bouncing back off the glittered columns. “It’s not?”
“What the fuck,” Draco said, mesmerised, and brought his hands to his mouth, muffling his words. “What the actual fuck.”
“Great,” said Harry, thinking of the spectacularly amiable mermaids in the Great Lake at Hogwarts. He looked up and down the dragon and it practically glared at him.
“That’s why you’re here, isn’t it?” she asked, tilting her head upwards, “Because you want to feel safe?”
He had developed a routine over the last few weeks. Back, out past the hotel and into the forest. It was patchy, darker in some places than others, but that didn’t matter much when it was already night-time.
Under the loch, Draco was suspended facing him. Somehow, there was orange light under the surface, too. Draco wasn’t naked anymore. Instead, he was covered entirely in real flowers, pink and pastel roses framing him almost like a dress. Harry stared. How could he find anyone else beautiful after this?
Once their taxi has dragged them through the thick, sluggish air of the city to their hotel, they check in and head on up. Draco unzips the suitcase as Harry drops eagle-spread onto the neatly arranged covers of the double bed.
Harry tried not to look surprised. “You don’t have to,” he said. “I mean – Ron is right, you don’t have to, like – I mean, I’d get it if…you didn’t want to.”
“Which one?” Oceania was busy rummaging through her drawers, presumably for a top, although you never knew with her.
“I love it here,” said Harry. It was true. He hadn’t entirely known until now – but he did, he loved it so much. So much more than he thought he would.
“Potter?” says Draco. When Potter’s gaze finally locks onto the other woman, she swallows and furrows her brows.
Harry was drinking beer, because Harry was a basic bitch. He ran his thumb over the swelling bulb of the glass and shrugged. Having never been to a gay bar, he couldn’t really tell the difference.
There was nothing to say. A few moments of silence passed as Harry rolled around noisily, trying to get comfortable. Draco didn’t move at all.
“Morning,” he said to the receptionist. She looked up from her copy of readers digest to glare at him.
“Okay, Draco.” says Harry, steering his crestfallen boyfriend towards the exit and away from the narrow-eyed museum curator. “Let’s go get some ice cream.”
“You’re such a Gryffindor,” Draco complained, as if Harry had just kicked a puppy in front of him. “You can’t just blunder your way into a work of art and demand for things. It’s so
Harry had never seen Malfoy like this. Not ever, not even when they were at Hogwarts. The red had bloomed across his face, a violent, ugly red. His lips were stretched tight, his eyes alight. Harry didn’t even know someone could look that angry.
“Indeed!” Charlie cried, and then his brow dropped considerably. He tugged his bathrobe with tiny dragons printed on it tighter around his torso and stepped out onto the porch.
But he needed this. It wasn’t as though he’d never flown before. It wasn’t even as though he’d never ridden a dragon before. But this wasn’t about that.
Falling back to the grass, Harry let his arms slump out around him, one of them thudding against Malfoy’s chest. He was breathing hard, still gulping down laughter, tears forming at the edges of his eyes.
“You can always talk to the others about it,” she said, once he’d gotten control of his breathing again. “They’ll all be really nice about it. Especially Draco.”
“What do you think?” Hayden brushed past on their way to the kitchen. Their eyes were trained steadily on Harry’s as they set down two cups.
But his chin tipped at the last second and his mouth latched onto Harry’s neck. He felt the sensation of it before he registered what it was. The warm opening flesh, the jagged row of teeth. The pulling at his skin, the pulling of him in, the beckoning – the feeling of being wanted, of being wanted so much he was being taken in, he was being willingly enclosed around in the mouth, the mouth – it was a seduction, all of it. Harry tilted his head back and felt the seducing happen inside him, as easy as going to sleep.
Draco Malfoy was standing the edge of the pen. His eyes were wide. His large leather satchel was draped over his left shoulder.
This was too much. Harry stopped looking out the window and glared at her, really glared. “Right. So you think you’re qualified to tell me what’s what. Since you’re obviously the mental health expert.”
His flat was one of those English-style ones that opened from the communal hallway straight down a set of unnecessarily but delightfully grandiose steps with the curly black railings into the pavement. People with Tesco shopping bags and children and dogs walked past him. There were white spots of gum pressed like dried flowers into the black tarmac. Weeds bloomed on either side. Cars roared past him, dragging behind them the noxious perfume of petrol.
“What The Fuck,” he said emphatically, slowly raising his hands from his head back up to the sky. “Does That Even Fucking Mean.”
Hayden laughed then, delighted. “Merlin,” they said, once they’d calmed down. “I know we’re strange people but Merlin – we’re not that daft.”
Harry had felt fear many, many times. Perhaps overexposure ought to have desensitised him to it. But there were many types of fear, and it was just as strong each time.
“Ha ha.” Harry reached into her peppermint ball in retaliation. She let him, because she liked him back, really.
said the busty woman, gripping the handle of the whip. She had short hair gelled back and tall, aristocratic features.
Going to be straight up - I have no idea where this is going. My love of slow-burns meets my distinct desire to wrap this up in the next two chapters. It was naive of me to assume Draco and Harry could ever be brought together in less than 30, 000 words. I am unwilling to commit to that, and yet suspect the rest of this story will inevitably start flashing in stop motion behind my lids at night if I do not. I can promise that I will not leave this unfinished, because it goes against principles (I've been hurt too many times by other people's hiatuses).
“I always took you for a romantic,” Draco drawled, just for something to do. Merlin, there was Harry Potter’s torso.
Her lips, her hair. She touches her lips and her hair. She touches the same lips that Potter touched, and the same hair that Potter touched, and feels the bloom of her mouth as it stretches over her teeth and digs into her cheeks.
He turned to look at Malfoy again, and this time, Malfoy was already looking back. His mouth was parted.
He peered carefully up at Charlie. Charlie was just sucking at the fruit juice unconcernedly, the empty carton making a thunderous crumpling noise.
Hermione took her hand off his and leaned back. The sunlight spilled a little across her black hair and dark brown skin.
“You were adventurous in all the textbook ways,” she said, when she had re-emerged. “In the Gryffindor way.”
Charlie rested his hand over Harry’s. “You’re going to be okay.” His voice had dropped to a soothing bass. “Just dandy.”
“Oh god,” says Harry, from where she is lying naked on Malfoy’s bed, heart still racing from her last orgasm. “Really?”
“I’m sorry,” said Harry, “You’re right. I haven’t been looking at you like a full person. I haven’t respected you. I’m sorry for that.”
“Maybe that’s because, deep down,” Draco says after a moment, pulling on a pair of black tights, rolling them over her calf and thigh. “Deep, deep, down, you don’t think women are people as fully as men are.” She moves on to the other foot, flexing her ankle as she dips it into the filmy material.
She came over immediately, wrapping her arms around his head and pulling him into her chest tightly. Harry reached for her too, desperately, and somehow she ended up in his lap, clutching onto him. She had started crying again. He was crying just a bit too, and buried his face in her shoulder to hide it. She smelled like childhood and cleverness and
Malfoy laughed, and it filled the empty space, just for a moment. “Well,” he said, once he was done. “That’s one way of putting it.”
Behind him, Malfoy had clearly fucking lost it. Harry threw a fiver on the counter and managed to get out a sound between “Sorry” and a sort of strangled whimper, before promptly getting the hell out of there and back to the relative safety of the table.
It had taken twenty minutes to attach the elaborate ensemble that Harry was now wearing, which consisted of a corset, a waistcoat, shorts, thigh highs, knee and elbow pads, a choker that looked suspiciously like a dog collar, gloves, some weird strappy things that Harry was fortunate enough to not know the name of, and finally, socks. The corset wasn’t done up right and Harry had drawn a hard, hard line at thongs, but all in all, Malfoy should be so fucking grateful.
how much, just how big. It was so deep that sometimes it felt like hurting, so deep that it felt like something inside him that was moving and rolling over in its sleep.
Harry was staring at him. When Draco looked back over he glanced away instinctively. But he looked back again.
“Osh,” he said. He swallowed. He felt that his eyes were too big – big enough that she could just dive in and see everything inside him right now. “I…I think I’ve done something bad.”
“Fifteen ten, well isn’t that just impressive? And to think, this is what is just sitting on hand for you. Now one thinks it rather would be worth a trip to the pantry.”
“Is it too much to ask that you fuck like a civilised person, Potter? I supposed you learnt that trick from our barbarian of a groundskeeper – ”
There was another silence. When Harry looked over again, Tom was looking out towards the mountains. The light skittered off his high nose, his square jaw, and Harry tried to imagine, even though he knew he couldn’t, what it must have been like to open yourself up like that.
“I was going to go on a run.” Harry straightened up and brushed as his trousers. “I thought that you should come with me.”
It had been so long since he’d been on his own around other people. There were so many other people. The city centre was a vast, vivid, interweaving thing. He couldn’t stop looking at all these strangers, all busy on their own strands of existence.
“Okay,” Malfoy had said, biting into the orange balanced precariously at the end of his fork. “Don’t worry about it.”
He looked up at Draco, trying to project a general air of exasperation. The other man’s lips were curved up into a sharp line.
“Different kind of balls,” Harry muttered, refusing to dignify Malfoy by looking over. In his peripheral vision, Malfoy raised a brow and lowered his head.
Oceania herself was hard at work underneath one of the light fixtures. She was perched up on one of the sofas, her denim coveralls rolled up to reveal her bare feet, which were also somehow covered in paint. On her ankle shined a silver bracelet, not unlike Draco’s.
Harry leans back against the kitchen table as Malfoy brings out two cocktail glasses and an ice box. The apartment is surprisingly simple, clean, modern – not quite how she imagined Malfoy living. Then again, nothing here is how she imagined it would be.
“Even if you were,” Oceania continued, oblivious to the state of paralysis that was taking over Harry’s body. “Why would it be a bad thing to love you? I love plenty of difficult things. Mustard. Knitting. Draco.”
“Harry.” Luna’s melodic voice floated into his periphery. He turned to find her standing there in a watery dress that fell to the ground, her pale hair pinned back over her ears. “I didn’t see you arrive.”
“Is this a fantasy for you?” asks Malfoy, a hand dipping into Harry’s trousers and plunging in two fingers with no warm up, so that it would have probably hurt, if Harry wasn’t so wet. “Tell me, is this just a fantasy for you? Is this how you would have liked it when you were dating men, when you were fucking the Weasel? Is this how you imagined it, all this fighting back, all this hate, all this hurt?”
Harry Potter was by no means a stranger to being brave. But he had told Draco once, when he was drunk, that the bravery he had had during the war didn’t belong to him, and in many ways, this was true. That was the thing about bravery. It was so often squeezed out of you, a product of circumstance rather than any particular singularity of character.
Hayden sat up straighter and wiped their sexually ambiguous mouth on a napkin. “Surely,” they began. “If you were mad, you wouldn’t want to know. I wouldn’t.”
Malfoy leaned back, eyebrows pushing into a fold. When Malfoy was uncertain, his eyebrows formed a crease that was more a dot than a line.
“You’re still not funny.” Harry eyed up the framed pictures on the wall as he came in. He hadn’t noticed them last time, probably because of the trauma.
Malfoy closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths. The corner of his mouth twitched. And then he seemed to gather composure again.
“Would you not be my friend if I was slimy?” Harry asked. He couldn’t help it – the smile was coming out all on its own accord, and there was naught to be done.
“Come here,” he gasped when they parted, and pulled Draco half onto his lap. Draco glanced down nervously. “But I wanted to –”
“Knitting,” said Draco, turning his attention back to Harry. He looked quite serious. Oceania turned back to her tomatoes.
Luna wasn’t in sight when he entered the studio. The lights were white, and they beamed down onto a blond head that was facing away from Harry. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, the way it had when he had first discovered magic and the previously impossible had become possible.
“You and me both,” said Charlie, and raised the fruit juice to clink it against Harry’s freshly arrived coke.
Harry glanced at him, then tentatively went over and sat on the edge of the bed, watching the process. Something between nerves and anticipation was building in his stomach.
Ron somehow still manages to start spluttering and coughing, and Hermione is forced to give her boyfriend a couple hard slaps on the back.
“So am I,” said Oceania, after a long moment in which Harry primarily stared at Draco’s left eyebrow. “Gender identity is very important.”
Harry pointed a finger gun at her. She pointed one back. He could almost hear the breeze rustle between them, the dingy office temporarily reminiscent of anywhere in Texas.
Despite the somewhat chaotic events of the early afternoon replaying in Harry’s mind, he could not help but notice that Charlie’s house was not actually as dragon themed as one might have expected. But then they got to the lounge, in which there were two large inflatable dragons sitting on one of the sofas, a dragon shaped mirror, and a table with dragon claws, and Harry vowed then and there to never make judgements based on first impressions ever again.
There was nobody with Jane, either. Harry didn’t entirely want to see her, even though he knew he should, but he checked anyway.
Sometimes, when Draco’s hands start shaking, she finds that it’s difficult to make tea in the morning. Sometimes she wakes up, but she can only sit by the window in her pyjamas, for the whole day. She used to wear silk pyjamas, but now she wears cotton. There’s a patch near the hem of her pyjama top that has been rubbed thin from between her first finger and thumb.
“Do you want me to take that off?” Draco gave him his jacket, and watched the way his fingers ran over the yellow, brushing the shittily done flowers.
“Don’t hold your breath,” said somebody, and then he was awake. Reality was thudding around him. He gasped out loud, and it caught like a sob.
“Well, it’s not officially a gay club.” Malfoy licked at his lip again. “There’s a lot of straight people who come here too. But it’s also where all the gays come to hang out.”
It had been quite a while since he’d been down to the actual village of Tengboche. Harry found the absence of dragon-taming pens a little strange, and then immediately had to fight the urge to laugh at himself. He was starting to see the world like Charlie.
Harry leaned forward on his mat into child’s pose. He felt the strain in his back as the muscles were pulled forward, felt the tightness of his shoulders as they were persuaded open, felt it in the basin of his palm and slimness of his fingertips. The mat was soft against his chin – he pressed his face into it and closed his eyes.
He had hurt Ron and Hermione. Quite a few other people, too. He knew that. But he couldn’t stay for them. Did that make him a bad friend?
In the dream, he walked into Draco’s house to find him gardening. It was in the middle of his lounge, amidst all the books. Draco was crouched over a small square of soil in the middle of the floor, his hands stained green. Without turning around he said, “Why don’t you try it yourself?”
“Both as a lover and platonic companion,” Oceania added helpfully. She was now eyeing him. “Would you like me to introduce you?”
“Mm,” said Charlie around the fruit juice straw, before putting it down. “I guess. We did a fire-walk once. That was fun.”
Harry took a deep breath through his nose. “Okay,” he said. “Fine. Thank you.” He took the tank and disappeared into the bathroom.
“Just,” said Harry, and took a breath. “Just…I put my hands on my knees first. Middle finger to thumb. So…do that.”
Harry took this moment to study Tom, instead. The robes made his presence seem quite big, sometimes, indeed filling this temple – but he was actually quite small, for a man. It was not just that he was short so much as it was that he simply seemed to have been set from a lesser mold. His hands, in particular, were slim and nimble where they were wrapped around the prayer beads, noticeably more so than Harry’s.
Draco was staring at him. At his lovely brow skin, his golden glow – the thick unruly mass of his hair. His shorter build. His eyes, as green as anything, as green as God, as green as hope. His slim collarbones. The way his hands were put together. Everything that Draco loved, spread out before him – here to ruin him again.
“Good.” Ron clapped him one more time on his shoulder and then let go. “I mean, it would be fine if you were. Whatever makes you happy, man.”
He could tell the exact moment Draco saw him. He saw him searching around the room for a moment, his slight frown marginally obscured by his fringe, and then his gaze brushed over Harry and the frown went away. He slowed, the people behind him overtaking him.
was nosing at his shoulder. He turned around and snapped, “Yes, yes, alright, I get it, just wait for
Harry hadn’t really known what to do with that, so he had just taken the vitamins Hermione had given him.
The water opened up. They were in a clearing, and then Draco was standing at the edge of it, looking out at the view. In real life, Harry would have wanted to look at the view too. But here, in the dream, under the loch, he just wanted Draco.
“Oh, I bet they were,” he murmured, and when Harry glanced over he was smirking devilishly. Harry rolled his eyes and willed himself not to flush.
“Well. It’s the closest we have to a gay bar. What were we going to do, fucking apparate back to London just to drop in at the Village Soho? I don’t think so. You were the one almost puking on the way here.”
Tom was still looking at him. Harry had to look away. He felt like he was being told a secret, like he was being exposed to something private, even though Malfoy had already said something along those lines. Was Tom betraying Malfoy? Surely, they had some sort of understanding. It certainly looked that way.
“Should be,” Oceania replied. She set her glass down and wiped her mouth. It’s a pretty safe crowd. And we can see it from here. He’ll know where to find us.”
“They’re cool.” Harry looked away from a black and white depiction of two corseted women punching each other in a boxing ring to where Malfoy was standing. There was a slight indentation between his pale brows.
Everything was quiet around them. It was just Malfoy and him, here in his little hotel room, trying to find something. Harry realised he was leaning forward, and he didn’t move back.
Oceania didn’t open her eyes. Her lips were rested in a calm half-moon. With her other hand, she reached up and pressed her fingers against Harry’s chest, over his shirt. He let her.
But then they came out the other side. Harry had never been this way before. They came out on the edge of a small green hill, which steepened until they were on a set of other hills, or maybe one long continuous one. Here, Harry realised, were the rest of the taming pens.
How long had it been now? A few weeks? A month? It was still sitting there, in the middle of his floor, amidst all the clutter. Every morning, Harry had to make sure he rolled over on the right side in order to avoid stepping on it.
“I should go,” said Malfoy. He was looking at Harry attentively, and Harry was suddenly thinking about what he must look like.
to Draco, hadn’t he? The leggings, his face structure, the quality of his skin – there had always been a pull, and it was all of a sudden so fucking obvious that it was about sex, really, wasn’t it? Or that sex was at least a factor in the warmth Harry had felt at different points regarding him. It was obvious now, wasn’t it? It was obvious.
“Draco!” squealed Oceania. Her entire face had flushed an alarming shade of red, the kind that instinctively inspired warning bells in any warm-blooded mammal. Malfoy used this opportunity to get up and order another round.
“I’m quitting,” said Harry, and started to storm off. “That’s what I’m doing, telling Charlie that I’m quitting. Have a nice life Malfoy.”
The touch fluttered away like a butterfly. Harry opened his eyes. Malfoy was zipping up the bag and standing up and back. Harry stared up at him.
Hermione had said, clutching her hands together and kneeling in front of him, her eyes wide and watery.
She breaks up with Ginny too, in that time – a quick conversation, the kind that only occurs when you’ve both been broken up for a while already – “I’m sorry,” say Harry. “No you’re not,” says Ginny, looking at his glass of orange juice. “And that’s okay. I’m sorry, too.” – he’s traveling now, exploring the world on a professional broom.
“It’s,” said Harry, and stopped. He swallowed. “I guess it’s that I feel like…like I’m not really living. I’m just passing time. And I’m so lucky to be alive. I know I am. I really, really am. I know that. But I feel like I’m wasting it.”
The kitchen lighting was strangely flattering on Draco. “Yeah,” he said softly, looking back at him. “I do.”
Malfoy stiffened, and then continued stacking the mats. He seemed to be organising them by colour, and then thickness.
There is a part 2 coming soon! Thank you so much for the support so far! The song for this chapter is Lost In The World by Kanye West and Bon Iver. During the flight scene with Jane, I always imagined Life of The Bird by the Cinematic Orchestra however, if anyone is curious.
Harry felt himself flush and kept silent. After a moment, Hayden sighed and rubbed their forehead. “It’s called genderfluidity. Look it up if you must. Pronouns are they/them.”
“Everyone needs something to believe in.” says Draco, his voice soft, and he thinks that these beautiful places of worship aren’t really for the various muggle gods at all, but rather for themselves. God is just a place in your mind, and everybody needs beautiful places for their minds to go.
Harry looked back at him. Malfoy was so close, and so far away. He was the strangest thing of all, Harry thought.
“I don’t,” said Harry, then glanced around to make sure no one had heard him. “But I like Luna. And I do like some crafts.”
“Right,” said Malfoy. His ears were a bit pink, and he sounded out of breath. Harry put his hands into his pockets and tried not to kick the dirt in front of him.
“That’s a classic, you know,” he admonished, but missed a believable disapproving tone by about a thousand marks.
Harry caught the vase on reflex and shot Malfoy a sidelong look while he did it. “I think you’re just supposed to look,” he said lightly.
It was still dark inside his mind. He focused on his breathes, on the feeling of life hidden within the cavity of him, and quietly pulsating through his flesh and tissue. He felt so human sometimes when he did this. It grounded him, more than anything else.
Draco didn’t say anything. His lashes flickered, and he swallowed. The silence between them felt worse than the shouting, to Harry.
Time moved disproportionately. How long since he had come to Gay Dragon Village? How long since Hermione had sent the letter? A month? Two months? Three?
“Mm.” Malfoy’s gaze flickered past Harry’s shoulder and then back to his face. “I mean. You ran up to me and grabbed me.”
Malfoy produced a handful of raw meat – did everybody just keep raw meat on them all day here? Like, oh look, here’s my wand, and also an entire dismembered fucking cow – and held it out to Jane. She stared at him.
Pansy shot him another, final incredulous look. “Yeah,” she said. “We're friends. The point is kind of
“Come on,” says Malfoy, laughing breathlessly. “Did you really come here to argue with a dirty little Death Eater like me?” She grabs Harry’s hand and pulls her into the middle of the dance floor, ignoring her sharp intake of breath.
“A lot of people want to understand beings so they can control them,” Malfoy was looking off, towards Jane. Although he was taller than Harry, he was also very, very thin.
Hermione, to her credit, only widened her eyes a little as she took a sip from her beer. Ron, to his, didn’t
He had moved closer. Someone bumped into Harry on his right side. The crowd had knitted itself around them, stretching and tightening in time with the rhythm. It was easy to move closer. Harry was struck by how much he wanted easy, for once.
He came to a stop beside one of the larger trunks, and amidst the vibrant greens and velvet leaves and the blossoming sound of birdsong, he let the question rise up in him like a bubble to the surface of a loch:
The corners of Malfoy’s lips were twitching uncontrollably. He abruptly turned on his heel and strode deeper into the store, where the floggers and whips were hanging. There he stopped, appearing to gather himself, that turned back to the room at large.
The table really was very small between them. They were on stools, and the wine took up most of the room. Malfoy’s hair stuck to the side of his brow, and his lips were thin and pink above the white pyramid of his chin. He didn’t look like a woman, and he didn’t look like a man either.
Harry wanted to ask him if he was alright but couldn’t think of a way to that wouldn’t offend him. He settled for, “I don’t have to use all of the photos.”
Harry closed his eyes and inhaled. He brought forth the image of the physical landscape again, a map made up of muscles that flexed and ached in diverse ways, of skin and limb and bone, all slotting together to allow him to move like this. Like this: lifting into high lunge, sinking his hips to the ground, dripping salt residue down his neck and shaking in his ankles. Like this; forward into warrior three and then up, his leg groaning the whole time. He brought his knee into his chest, balanced on one leg, and for the first time, held his balance.
“Erm.” Harry side-eyed the shopkeeper, who’d been unabashedly watching their every exchange. “Is that okay?”
“Here.” Harry looked up as Malfoy handed him the water bottle. He was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Draco,” said Harry, and his voice had the gravelly edge to it that was so loved. “I’m asking you out because I want you, you idiot. Can’t you tell?”
“There he is!” said Seamus once he got closer, clapping him on that back. “Good man. Didn’t expect to see you tonight.”
Harry pursed his lips, and then pushed back on his desk with his foot so that his chair was balancing on its back two legs. His gaze drew up the length of Draco.
Draco crossed his arms, keeping his face carefully blank. He didn’t trust himself with this, not even a little bit. He had waited far too long. He had wanted far too much.
“Thanks, Osh.” He was a bit choked up. Behind them, he was aware that the others had started up their own conversation. He was glad for the chance to bury his face against someone’s shoulder and catch himself.
“I do,” said Hayden. “But I also know how much I’d like some blue cheese, especially on my bao zi in the mornings.”
It was perhaps a testament to the spectrum of Harry’s life experience that he did not so much as blink as his superior told him today’s objective was to interview a dominatrix.
“Don’t do that,” said Harry, and without thinking leveraged Malfoy’s face to keep looking at him. Malfoy’s eyes burned hot.
Harry pushes her back onto the table, shattering a cocktail, the sound of glass breaking as her fists lock around the other woman’s wrists. She hitches a leg up, knee at Malfoy’s groin, and pushes into her so hard it might be bruising. Malfoy just moans, grinning slightly, and Harry leans down and bites her neck, then tears away the front of her shirt too.
The crowd seemed like a much smaller thing from up here. He could see the people who were dancing, the people who were drunk. The people who were touching. He wasn’t sure, but he thought he saw two men together at the edge of the crowd. He thought he saw two women as well. He could definitely see some men and women together.
Harry ran a hand through his hair and shook his head. “Ah. No. That’s okay.” Charlie made a sound of relief beside him. He bit his lip and then sighed, lying back down onto the ground. The sun was orange-hot on his skin.
“You know,” he said, in an attempt to rescue them from the general tenseness, “the way you guys talk sometimes makes me feel like I’m lucid dreaming.”
Hayden raised the other brow, and then set them both down. Presumably, all that brow-lifting caused headaches after a while.
Draco finally looks up into Harry’s gaze, and there’s so much person in there, there’s so much earth that Harry just wants to bury herself inside.
“Ah,” said Luna now, and she said it as if something had just slotted itself into place. “And how was he?”
Harry didn’t know why he was doing it. There was no reason for him too. If he really wanted to communicate with Draco, he certainly could. He hadn’t yet. But he could. So there was really no reason for him to do this.
Pansy screwed up her nose, just a bit. “I wouldn’t call journalism writing,” she said. “Or if it is, I wouldn’t call what Blaise does
Harry quickly lifted his face from Ron’s shoulder. “Here,” he said, and reached for the tea, ensuring its safe landing.
He had wanted to live a new sort of life, but he would have had to become a new sort of person first. And how did you leave everything that had ever defined you behind, just because of one nonsensical whimsy? It was stupid. He had been being stupid. He had stayed.
“Ron’s always been a little feisty,” said Charlie, swinging a few slabs of raw meat over his shoulder, “You know that.”
“What's wrong with my planes?” asks Harry, slinging an arm over Draco's shoulders. Draco just scowls.
He laughed, leaning back against the wall. She grinned wider as he rubbed his hands down over his face. “Fuck,” he said eventually. “Why not?”
“It’s alright, Harry.” Oceania had stopped smiling, but her eyes were warm. “Do whatever you have to.”
But Harry looked at all the mountains, with their rocky, intimidating terrains, and the forests, with their rich, private lushness, and the sky, with its never-failing blue – and he didn’t feel suffocated by his own human constraints, for once. He was just happy to look.
There was a tense moment filled only with the sound of fluttering pages as Harry flipped open the list of questions Bolson had bequeathed him. Once he’d found what appeared to be the first page – the top of the page merely stated, in comic sans,
It’s terrifyingly easy to lie to the people you love. And Harry found that, after lying to them, you can’t quite love them the same anymore.
This was not successful, largely because the three of them were laughing so hard they all kept curling over, but also because it was a stupid fucking idea. Eventually, they decided to try it the other way around.
“Alright.” Malfoy swallowed, flared his nostrils. Harry understood, more fully now, that he really didn’t know Draco Malfoy at all.  “Let’s go for a walk.”
They watched Hayden go. Oceania looked at Malfoy and sighed, rummaging through the remaining bag. “Now you’ve upset them,” she muttered.
A moment passed in the forest. Malfoy was right; it was lovely here. It was so, so lovely. Beside him, Malfoy lay down.
Malfoy turned back to look at him. The light from the window made it hard to see his eyes; the entire right side of his form doused in sunshine, and Harry still had so much trouble when it came to reading him anyway.
“I like the rush. I like the precision of it. I like the way they give themselves up to me, the complete and total trust.”
If Malfoy had looked angry before, he looked ready to catch fire now. Harry half-expected him too. Everything was blue-hot.
He scrubbed his face with the towel, and headed back out, not sure what to do with himself. He padded into the lounge, deciding to look at Oceania’s paintings again.
Malfoy leaned back into her arm. “About whether or not you have any sushi hidden in that hair of yours.” He rubbed the end of her nose his thumb as well, and she wrinkled it comically again. “I’ve in a craving kind of mood.”
Once tea was made, Hayden led them to the bedroom. They sat in the middle of the bed and produced a bag full of purple fluff, and then reached over into one of the bedside drawers and returned with several sheets of white paper and filters. Oceania came in carrying the tea, handing one to Harry. She’d calmed down, but her face was still slightly pink.
After, Potter had kissed her eyelids and had gone to get biscuits from the cupboard. She had brought them back, and got crumbs all over the mattress, and then they had done it again. And then again. And then they had a bathroom break. And had done it again. And then Potter had gone to actually make tea, except Draco followed her, and watched – and there had been something so delicately aching inside as Draco had watched her boil the water and make the tea. Watching the bubbles climb each other angrily. Watching the shift of Potter’s brown arm as she lifted the handle. Watching her add the milk, and all the while something delicate was shattering, beneath the white skin of Draco’s body.
Everything outside Harry froze up too. It was strange, the sudden flexibility of the moment, as it happened over and over again, like an echo, and Harry’s mind tried to bend it into a shape that would make sense to him. Something was happening, and it was somehow both larger and smaller than Harry ever thought it could be.
“Probably.” He didn’t move. Malfoy was wearing earrings, he saw now. Little pearl things, the kind of earrings a real woman might wear to work, or dinner.
But he was already outside, the autumn wind hitting his face. He looked up and down the streets until he found that white head again, at last, just about to cross the road. He jogged over and grabbed his elbow just as the lights changed.
“Malfoy,” says Harry again, stupidly, staring at her, feeling compelled, for some reason, to say things, without actually knowing what things.
“Dramatic? Pray, do not throw about such accusations.” Malfoy’s eyes were starting to sparkle above the pout.
Malfoy shrugged, one pointy dip of his shoulders, the mesh sliding down on one of them. His skin gleamed under the electric lighting.
“So.” Charlie flung open the cage door with more casualness than Harry deemed appropriate and stepped back. “The first step is to think of a name.”
“I’m sorry,” he said. “For how I acted when I first came here. I don’t want you to think that I’m…that I’m – some kind of homophobe.”
Harry had to admit it was pretty cool, in a sort of goth way. He didn’t know what he had expected – snakes and emerald windows, maybe. He stepped around the coffee table to get a better look at the Gene Bilbrew print.
And when he pulls back, Harry just smiles at him, smiles such an innocent, peaceful smile, his eyes drooping and soft, and Draco thinks his entire body might already be scattered, and brilliantly so.
Blaise cleared his throat. Somehow, it still sounded very silky on him. “Would anyone be interested in a drink?”
Walking was good. He felt like he was airing out his mind. He hoped that, if he walked long enough, things would start to make sense. He should start at the beginning.
Harry let his head tilt to the side. Being drunk wasn’t like being high, but the air was still thick, still viscous. Everything still loosened right up.
In the end, Pansy didn’t get the most expensive option. She got the octopus rolls. And a shot of sake.
He handed Harry a piece of raw meat without looking at him. “The dragon isn’t a machine. It isn’t a tool. It’s a being. You have to understand it before you can communicate with it.”
It’s not exactly a momentous occasion as such – it’s not that one day she wakes up wanting to kiss them and hold their hands and adorn herself in rainbow robes. It’s just that, over the course of a couple months in that year, the line of thought draws closer and closer to the front of her mind.
“She stole one of Benjamin’s hairpieces.” Malfoy seemed to realise he was still holding down Harry. He retracted his hand immediately, fumbling with his wine glass.
Harry blinked, and then looked away, running a hand through his hair. “No,” he said. “No, I – it doesn’t matter. I – that was kind of you. Thanks.”
His eyes were burning a hole into Draco’s skull right now. Draco privately reinforced his legilimency walls, not that there was much point now, he supposed.
The flush in Malfoy’s cheeks was spreading all over his face. He tried to nod in Harry’s steel grip, best he could. Harry’s lips lifted.
Draco threw his hands into the air, as if out of all the things Harry had said to him, this was by far the most ridiculous and farfetched. “Why?” he asked the ceiling, which was the only part of the room free of books entirely. “Pray,
“Alright,” said Charlie. He rubbed at his brow, and then looked up at Harry. “Not really sure how to go about this. It’s a bit – well, it’s about Jane.”
Harry was watching Malfoy, the way he was leaning quietly against the tree, his expression too far away to accurately determine. Oceania’s hand came up to his shoulder.
Charlie looked up, and when his eyes focused on Harry he beamed. “Harry! You came!” He gestured to Oceania’s lap. “Now, sit down.”
“I’ll show you where you’ll be learning tomorrow,” said Charlie as they reached the top of the hill, “It’ll be good fun, Harry.”
was poised on top of Harry’s tongue, but he felt a tugging of something stretched tight just south of his mouth, and it kept him in line.
He didn’t know entirely where it came from, or what it was – especially at first. But somewhere, perhaps hiding in the corners of his new flat, or lining the edges of the pavement, or just beneath the roaring of the passing cars – there had been something, something dark and bad and cold, and eventually it had creeped out and seeped into his pores – and everything inside him had just gone blue.
Sometimes, he felt like Malfoy noticed everything. Like Malfoy could see deeper into Harry than Harry could himself. He had said he was good at finding paths into people, and Harry believed him.
“What about that one?” He asked, and gestured to a smaller one in the corner that had a rough sketch of what seemed to be a temple on it. Hayden’s smile instantly dropped.
“You don’t have to,” he said, but Malfoy was already standing up, his long legs unfolding and taking him away.
Hermione’s eyes softened at the edges. There was something very old about the way she was looking at him.
Draco looked down at him. He was entirely rosy, fully dressed. The damp spot on his trousers had long stiffened, and the thought of that made Harry want to throw him back onto the sofa and have his way with him.
Harry almost fell off the countertop. Both his balance and his composure were only half-successfully regained.
Before he knew it, the water must have been at his waist. He must have paused, just to admire the moon.
“That’s not quite right.” Malfoy’s voice was feather soft beside him. “I’ve always known, to an extent. I’ve always felt that way. It was around third year that the thought really crystallised in my mind, but even then, it was like meeting a stranger that feels familiar.”
Harry looked over to where Malfoy was now slumped against the sofa next to him. He wasn’t quite sure when he’d gotten there. Across the room, Oceania was trying to bowl from atop Charlie’s shoulders, and the counter girl was passing the balls up to her.
Some dreams felt more vivid than reality; this was one of those. Already, the details were fading – but the feeling was printed into his brain matter like the ghost of a bright light in his retinas. The more he thought about it, the more his stomach seemed to hurt.
He was teasing. Harry looked at him for a long moment, and then looked away, out, out past Jane and over all the mountains, the jagged edges and snow tipped peaks, the clear, ripe blue sky.
“It’s not that I’m pretending I’m someone I’m not,” Malfoy continued, “I’m not like you, I know. But – I just think you should know that decency isn’t required for someone to still be human. I’m not excusing flaws. But…just because I’m not like you, doesn’t mean I’m less than you. Do you understand?”
There was more silence. Harry picked at a loose thread on the sofa. There was a patch of sunlight warming the side of his thigh through his jeans.
A sharp laugh echoing from the bathroom indicated that any timing precautions taken had been futile. Oceania just quirked an amused brow at him.
“Draco! Baby! Bitch!” Oceania shouted as she heaved one of the shopping bags over to the table. “We’ve got persimmons!”
“I thought you’d forgotten,” Draco said eventually. He said it softly, and if Harry closed his eyes now, it would feel like the words were coming from inside his own mind.
“You can,” said Hayden. “I think I’m going to go write a bit. Or perhaps, lay myself down in the dirt and mutter curses about whoever invented the cookie.”
Sometimes, over the last few months, Harry had been surprised by how soft Draco’s skin had been, how gentle it was to touch, like silk, like expensive face creams, like a cloud. She hadn’t been able to understand how something so soft could be so biting, could be so cold, could be so sharp. How curves could make up such hard lines. How people could be intimate, even whilst sharing so little, whilst being so dishonest. She hadn’t understood how walls could be built out of cotton, out of kisses, out of things so vulnerable. She didn’t understand relationships, and she didn’t understand how opposites could entwine like that.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but relaxed a little against the wall, watching her with fondness. Again, Harry felt like he shouldn’t be watching.
“Anyway,” said Pansy, going back to dipping another roll in an excess of soy sauce. “It gives him a purpose, which is what’s important. Lord knows Blaise could do with one.”
Sometimes, though, he still felt like he was walking that walk. Like he had never gotten home. He was just passing time; he was just following the road. But the road never led anywhere.
“I’ll make sure to wear it next time! Just for you!” Malfoy yelled back, but Harry was already stepping into the street and apparating.
She picks her way over a fence and makes her way down a set of stone slabs to the beach. The water makes a gentle roaring sound, and the pebbles shift under Draco’s soles.
Big, bright, blue. A few birds skittered, black sparkles, across the length of it. Harry felt his rib cage open, just enough, and it gave him courage.
“Yes,” said Hayden and relaxed a little, leaning back on the counter. “Oceania’s like that. More so with Draco, though.”
The place Zambini recommended was the same place Luna and Harry had gone to the other day. Harry had been so surprised that when Zambini had told him the name he had blurted out, without thinking: “That’s where Luna and I went the other day.”
His muscles were aching, but he had already trained himself to endure this, and so it was not difficult. Next to him, Malfoy was breathing hard. Harry was reminded that although Malfoy was in fit condition, he had not trained himself in running. The pain was still novel.
“Have you considered theatre?” asked Harry lightly, “You could have dropped out of Hogwarts and been a star, Malfoy.” Harry put on the most extravagant voice he could and thrust his hip forward. “A
“A bit,” Harry admitted. “But it didn’t seem that weird.” He paused. “Nothing in comparison to how it felt to see you in your leggings for the first time.”
“Oh,” said Harry, and tried not to sound too confused. Hayden got up, and took both their empty bowls back to the kitchen.
“Draco,” she breathes, leaning in to lick the tears off Draco’s cheek. “Darling, I’m here. I’m not going to leave. Draco, I promise.”
The path had crossed over the threshold of the forest some time ago, and now they were inside it, surrounded on all sides by elegantly limbed trees and ripe green florae and golden sunlight, pouring in generously through the gaps in the trees above. The fertile scent of ungoverned nature wrapped itself around them, enclosing them in their own little slice of paradise.
“Tea would be fine.” Draco came and leant on the island counter as Harry put the kettle on. “I thought Osh was staying with you.”
“I didn’t know you liked polka dots,” he said, smiling and looking straight at Draco, and when Draco looked up his eyes fluttered away from Harry’s gaze in a way that made the mess in Harry sweeten even further.
“Ah, yes.” Malfoy’s thin lips twisted around the words. Harry had forgotten it, mostly – but Malfoy was not a handsome man. His nose was too long, his eyes too narrow, his chin too sharp. The hollows in his face had a permanent sunken-in appearance. His transparent skin betrayed his hatred, when he felt it, all too easily.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d almost think you sounded disappointed.” Malfoy smirked around the edge of his white Russian, one arm pressed against the counter and the rest of his body slinking back. He took a sip, licking the white moisture off of his upper lip in one elegant movement.
He stood up and crossed the room. Felt for his jacket and shoes. He could turn the light on, but it didn’t feel right.
“You only shut up when I’ve got your legs spread,” She tells her. “You’re only worth hearing when I’ve got you flat on your back like the wet bitch you are, like a whore trying to earn her next meal.”
“Oh.” says Potter. “That’s okay. Sugar. Who needs it?” She laughs uncomfortably, and glances around the room.
“Fuck you.” Draco walks back into the room, but before he can bend over to retrieve his four body lotions, Harry leans over and curls an arm around his waist. Draco grabs his hair as the other boy rubs his face into Draco’s belly.
“Breathe in,” said Harry. He tried to smooth his voice out, the way Oceania did when she was teaching yoga. “From your stomach to your chest. Then back out, from your chest to your stomach. Let it go.”
“How did you realise otherwise?” Harry asked unthinkingly. Oceania tilted her head to glance at him, and this time there was a slight smile, hiding slyly in the indent of her cheek.
“Well, what the bloody fuck are you into?” Harry blurted out. “Fucking…chest hair? Noses? I’m pretty sure I’m the least kinky out of all of you.”
There was something intrinsic about Oceania’s strangeness that made it seem as though she’d been born into it, perhaps like Luna Lovegood. The thought that she had had to fight for it, that she had had to
“That’s –” they said, and then stood up quickly as if they wanted to go over and take it down, “–Something else.”
century warlock, and not a functioning bookstore. Draco climbs an old rickety ladder with secret delight, and feels Harry's eyes on him as his fingers are brushing over the spines of a pretty hardback set.
Draco couldn’t remember the question. Harry’s hands were solid on Draco’s knees, and he couldn’t remember the question. Harry was stepping closer, and he was every answer.
It was strange to think that Malfoy could have held him like that and not felt the blue too. Harry did not know how to put it into words. He rather suspected that feelings and words were different mediums.
Besides, Ron and Hermione had had each other. And here was another awful truth: even though he had loved them – been beyond grateful that they were alive – sometimes it felt like they weren’t enough. Not for the brimming inside of him.
About an hour later Oceania leaned into Harry’s chest and fell asleep. When she woke up, she blinked into the dark haze that had now settled around the group. Someone had put lit a fire a while ago and it crackled now, flickering a vibrant red and orange between them.
“You’re not even gay.” Says Malfoy, loudly. “You have a ginger boyfriend who likes brooms entirely too much for any straight man. Tell me, do the curtains match the drapes? And if so, have you considered shaving little lightning bolts into it? He might have failed at murdering pussy, but will surely rise again – ”
Malfoy was halfway out of his floral leggings, staring wide-eyed at Harry. Wide-eyed, Harry reasoned, was better than murderous.
“Shall we go find her?” asked Malfoy. “I have the most wonderful idea. I think she would like to hear it out.”
Harry swallowed again. A breeze rushed over the skin of the loch, wrinkling it, and Harry closed his eyes in time to feel it on his eyelids.
He didn’t know when it had come to this. When he had transitioned from the Harry Potter that could feel pain in a way that was still okay, to a Harry Potter that couldn’t feel okay at all. He didn’t recognise himself.
“Where’s Oceania anyway?” Malfoy asked after a while. He glanced around the counter like she might be sitting on it.
If anything, this only served to make Zambini’s grin even more sharklike and his eyes even more glittery. He sounded very amused when he spoke.
Mayo squirmed against his neck. Harry felt that this was unfairly endearing of him. He said, “Come off it Malfoy, it’s not my fault your dragon likes me so much.”
“Oh yes.” Charlie paused and squinted at him. “Are you trying to affect a sort of casually disinterested tone? Don’t, ever. Being earnest and blunt suits you.”
Malfoy made a high, wailing sound, his forehead crumpling as if in pain. Harry dug his thumb in deeper. Malfoy relaxed his throat.
Malfoy lifted his chin, just a little. The light settled into the lift of his mouth and the dip underneath.
So Harry was staring. The woman with the huge nose piercing and a shawl with winged potatoes on it stared right back. Harry touched his hair self-consciously.
By the time he came back, he was watching Hayden roll another joint, the purple a soft exposed line, before being swallowed by the paper. He blinked over, and Oceania was there, blowing smoke into his face. He reached out and touched the tip of her nose. She smiled, but it didn’t wrinkle.
“I need you,” said Harry, and took Malfoy’s hand in his own. It was soft, and much warmer than Harry had expected, for some reason. He wrapped both hands around it. Malfoy’s eyes were glistening.
“Nope, not at all.” As he said it, however, the coffee was already disappearing from the fabric. Harry leaned back. Draco made a point of being very busy with his putting down of things.
“Mind your own damn business,” Draco told him, but he was smiling rather viciously as he pushed Harry away with the tip of his tea spoon on Harry’s forehead.
Harry responded by throwing one of the books at Draco’s head. Draco swore through his laughter, and then picked himself up, his palms pressing into the ground. His eyes were wide and excited.
Harry swallowed and nodded. He wished Malfoy would wrinkle his nose again. “We can do it again,” he blurted, without thinking about what he was saying. “If you want. If, like, it actually helps. Help you get better at it.”
When Draco looks up, Potter’s dark brows are very close. Her eyes are swimming. “Malfoy.” she says, her voice suddenly, suspiciously soft. “Let’s have tea now.”
“I…” said Harry, and swallowed. He felt as if he was missing out on something he shouldn’t be. “I suppose.”
Draco glanced down at his feet in a harried sort of way. “Nothing,” he said, and then did a double take upon seeing Harry's expression. “
And although Harry’s mind had already been prised open by the sheer wildness of his life and Gay Dragon Village and Jane, there were still some things that he wouldn’t be able to wrap his head around, that he couldn’t bend to make sense of the right way. He didn’t think about it because it was too much, much
but there is nothing here, except her tea and her cottage and all these ghosts – there is nothing here but herself, and she is struck with the sudden and utmost fear that she can scream as loud as she wants and no one will hear.
“Merlin.” Malfoy pushed himself off the island and went around to the sink, back to Harry. There, he filled a glass with water, the muggle way. He drank it slowly, pacing himself. Harry waited.
A brief scuffle ensued, in which Harry attempted to prise Malfoy’s fingers from his effulgent complexion and Malfoy succeeded in elbowing Harry in the ribs. Harry was laughing, and as they slid a few inches in the grass and Malfoy grabbed onto the ground for support, he glimpsed a neighbouring smile trying to tuck itself away in the corners of Malfoy’s mouth.
It was the loch, again. And it was Draco, again. In this dream, the light was a golden orange for some reason, glowing thickly through the trees, and it made the loch seem more blue. It was a lighter, richer blue than it had been in real life, Harry was sure of it. And then Draco took a step forward that Harry was sure he hadn’t taken in real life either, and then he plunged under.
“Is it enough?” he heard himself whisper. Oceania’s hand came up, and she stroked a finger down his nose.
Malfoy shoots her an incredulous look. “It’s a not particularly heart-throbbing story,” she says. “I just looked at some tits one day and thought: “Fuck, I want those in my face.”” She frowns. “That, and six packs were about as appealing as a loaf of bread.”
Malfoy said, distinct even through all the obstacles, and Harry tightened the grip on his throat. He rolled again.
“You’re making fun of me,” said Oceania, swaying and squinting impressively across at them, “Both of you. I’m going to go and sit beside ‘arry.”
They went for a walk. The side of the mountain was beautiful, candy-green grass and crumbling rock, tiny pieces of it skittering over the edge and falling down into the village below. Harry followed Malfoy, his eyes stuck on his white head, the bend in his legs as they climbed. He didn’t know where they were going.
There was nothing obviously remarkable about the pub. It appeared at first glance to be just like any other stereotypically British pub in Glasgow. But Luna had said that she liked the place, and so here they were.
He pulled back, pushing at Draco’s hips. They were absolutely as bony as he had always thought they would be. “Here, here – yeah, like this.”
“That’s two-fifty.” She was already turning back to him with the coke. He realised his window of opportunity was probably closing. He wasn’t sure, but he thought that he could maybe already hear Malfoy giggling.
“He’s fun. Everyone else likes him. I know you guys had a bit of a thing in Hogwarts, yeah, but the past is past Harry. Every day’s a new one.”
In fact, Harry thought dizzily, he looked like he was burning his own sun inside of him. Like he was burning a thousand suns. Like he was burning Harry.
Malfoy looked back at Harry’s face. “Yes,” he said steadily, and then shook himself, pulling his shirt down. “What – what are you doing here?”
“Ronald,” said Hermione, but it was pretty soft, as far as reprimandings go. She had her chin in one hand, her work robe transfigured into a sleek blazer that was resting over the back of her chair. Harry liked to see her relax.
It was a long time, but also, it brought forth the idea of Tom having existed somewhere before this temple, and it was just very difficult to imagine Tom existing anywhere else. Even though he couldn’t possibly pass as a local, there was something very natural about his presence here, like he had grown up out of the soil alongside this temple, up on this mountaintop – face forward to the whole wide world. Harry couldn’t imagine living like him: waking every morning to light the incense and polish the gods and sweep away the dust on the floors, before settling down to pray – but for Harry to make a judgement on this kind of life would have been like him trying to make a judgement on the quality of a tree’s life. Perhaps it seemed simple, but Tom and him were different species, and seemed to require different things. Harry was slowly coming accustomed to the idea that there were disparate brands of humans living around him.
He was waiting in the corridor, leaning on the wall next to the door to Harry’s room. He looked up as Harry approached.
Draco knew he was in love, but he didn’t think this was any exaggeration. It couldn’t be. Surely, it wasn’t Draco making Harry glow like that – surely, surely, his skin was really golden, his soul was really flickering, a candle in the dark room. Maybe it was the temple that made it more intense – maybe it was having him next to Tom. Tom, who was lovely, Tom who was important to Draco – but who he could hardly see next to some stupid Gryffindor boy that he had never befriended, that he had never kissed, that he had never made love to or shared secrets with.
Harry looked up to find Luna looking at him. He blinked, and realised she was still talking about the mats.
“What am I supposed to do?” asked Harry, amused despite himself. “Whip out a bottle of cleaning solution and some rubber gloves?”
There was nothing accusative about it. Ron was looking up at him, eyes clear and sincere. He had grown up so much since Hogwarts that sometimes it almost jarred Harry. He felt his eyes begin to well up again.
Tom nodded. He was studying Harry, but there was nothing intrusive about it. It was just the way that Tom looked at things. Like he was soaking it in, a member of the audience instead of a character on stage. It’s not that he wasn’t present, Harry thought, but rather like he was once removed. Out of all of them, Harry felt that Tom was the furthest away.
“Oceania kicked me out because the bowling girl turned up to confess her undying love,” Harry said in one breath. “How has your evening been?”
“Right,” says Potter all of a sudden, her cup coming down to meet the counter loudly. Draco starts, and clutches at her own cup.
It was empty. Harry licked his lips, and then crossed the archway and went into the storeroom. He took one of the mats.
“I’m not taking your job seriously?” Malfoy was still sitting down, nearly gutting himself with incredulousness. “Do you actually hear yourself when you talk?”
“They’re fine. We all lived together for a while, which was nice – they have children now, you know.”
“The camp’s really spread out,” Charlie said as they left the cafeteria area and began the ascending path up a small hill. “Needs to be, s’just the nature of dragon training. So the actual training sites are all around here.” He waved vaguely at the surrounding mountains, and Harry looked up, taking in the black and white of the peaks, the jagged edges that seemed to spread out endlessly before them.
“What does that mean?” asked Draco. He was rubbing the edge of one foot into the carpet and only occasionally glancing up at Harry. He was obviously anxious and obviously trying very hard not to look anxious, and even though Harry suddenly found himself in the very rare position of being able to decipher Draco Malfoy, he found that it in no way gave him any power over the situation at all.
Harry made solid agreeing noises against him. He licked a bit at Draco’s nipple, and Draco made another lovely sound and arched his back, which was great.
“Yes, but it serves the same atmospheric purpose,” said Malfoy, sitting down next to Oceania. She threw an arm around him and passed him a bottle. “Oh lovely, you’re drunk already.”
“Yup,” she said eventually around a mouthful of apple sauce, looking very pleased with herself. “You’ve never been to a gay bar.”
Well, that was a little more forward than he’d expected. “Urm…” he said again. Gao just looked at him patiently.
Harry thought about the long line of his back. He thought about it drawing down, down, and down. His hands, chest, and shoulders, all under the loch. His thin lips. His grey eyes.
Malfoy ran a hand through his already ruffled up hair and sighed as he pulled himself towards the counter opposite Harry. He slowly dragged his hands down over his face.
Hayden laughed. Harry forgot about not looking at other people and glanced up to meet Malfoy’s gaze as he was laughing himself. It was strange, like he had just figured out an answer to a question he hadn’t meant to ask. Harry felt his laughter die.
There was a knitted rug with indecipherable patterning on it, as if the knitter couldn’t make up their mind about they wanted to depict. Also a sparkly glass light fixture. Also a gay flag hanging behind the bed. Also shelves for more books. Also a dressing table.
At least Oceania had only given him the corner of the ceiling. The only way anyone would be focusing on his painting was if they sat down on the armrest of the sofa and immediately craned their head up. He tested this theory himself, and was forced to admit that the effect was somewhat alarming.
Day two of the Mani Rimdu meant dances. And according to Draco’s hissing voice in his ear right now: “You can’t miss the dances Harry, you just can’t.”
He caught Draco's arm and reeled him in to kiss his cheek, because he could and he wanted to. Draco stopped looking at the green and started looking at him. His lips quirked up.
Because this place did attract an interesting hoard of people. Spiritual people were always a little odd to begin with, in Harry’s opinion (the fact that he was now somewhat spiritual had done nothing to change this, as he was decidedly odd himself), and spiritual people who were willing to travel to a somewhat obscure festival in a remote corner of the Himalayas were even more odd. Spiritual people who were willing to travel to a somewhat obscure festival in a remote corner of the Himalayas
She wraps her fingers around the plastic handle and brings it over to the tap. Water sloshes over the edge as she fills it right up, dripping down the shiny silver metal like rain. She sits it back on the heating element, and flicks on the switch with her thumb.
Was that it? There were always reasons to be unhappy, small reasons, small misfortunes to endure. And maybe some of the reasons weren’t small, but even so, they didn’t seem to explain the sensation of the vast open ocean of despair that was always tugging at his chest, even during the better moments, even when he could almost call himself happy –
Downstairs, someone was talking on the phone. There weren’t any noises coming from upstairs. He wondered if there was even anyone else staying in the whole hotel.
“Well I certainly have sugertits,” said Draco as he hopped up to sit on the surface. He caught Harry’s eye and winked at him.
Draco wasn’t smiling exactly, but he air was lit up around him as if he was. He turned fully, leaning back against the bookshelf. He looked so much like himself at Hogwarts in that moment that Harry was jarred.
“You know full well that I have more feelings than the three of you combined,” Oceania said breezily, pulling a fork out of her hair and handing it to Malfoy, who frowned slightly before wiping it on his shirt.
“Another project?” Ginny smirked, a little. She looked glad for a reason too. “What is it this time? Weed bacon? Tattooed eyeballs?”
“It’s interesting,” he admitted. “Like, obviously, no matter how much they’ve changed it doesn’t excuse the past. But they have changed, you know?”
“Oh,” said Harry. He shifted a bit in his seat. He was beginning to get a bit drunk. “It’s okay. I’m okay. I just have a lot of time, I suppose.”
He rolled onto his side, stared up at the fuzzy white of the moon, obscured through the cotton curtains. He’d tossed over so many times that no part of the sheets was still cold.
They were up, and for a wondrous, heart-rendering moment, Harry was surrounded in the blue. He was overcome by it. It wasn’t the blue of the Loch, of his heart, of Jane’s – it was the blue of breathing, the blue of life. It was wide, and full, and almost jarringly vivid. He had to close his eyes to it.
Malfoy had already been snickering, but when Harry looked him in the eye and said: “He’s a brownie,” he lost it, dissolving into helpless laughter and clutching at Harry’s shoulders. Harry looked at him, dead serious, which seemed to be cracking him up again. When Malfoy laughed, his face folded in like origami.
“Come here,” murmurs Potter, and she feels her lips brush over hers again, back and forth, back and forth. An arm wraps around Malfoy’s waist, and their lips press together, soft, for a couple moments. Malfoy can’t remember when she closed her eyes. She’s not even sure if her eyes are closed. Potter moves against her, and the inside of her mouth can’t be as dry as the outside because her breath is hot and humid and wet against Malfoy’s. And her cheeks are right there, her brows and lightning scar are right there, and her eyes are right there.
Oceania had already picked it up, both arms wrapped around the middle. She was holding it the way Harry would hold a box of feathers, or possibly, a single leaf.
“You do that,” Luna encouraged, and then she was gone. Harry stared at the fire place for a minute, and then he got up and went to have a shower.
The girl behind the counter looked up as he approached. She raised a brow. He could already feel his palms clamming up.
It was Harry’s turn to raise his eyebrows suggestively. “I’m all sorts of things you wouldn’t expect, Zambini,” he said, slurring only a little.
“Hello, Harry.” She blinked warmly at him and then led him through to the kitchen without a further word.
Hayden let their eyes run languidly over the testosterone drenched landscaped before them. A soft smirk curled around their lips.
“We should get off,” he murmured, absent-mindedly, and when Draco didn’t say anything he brought a hand up and slowly, slowly, touched a finger-tip to the knuckle of Draco’s pinkie. The touch was so light he almost couldn’t feel anything. The skin was pink there, like a watercolour painting.
“Because you’re a fucking asshole,” said the receptionist, and shut the door in his face. He was going to miss her.
“I didn’t disturb you, did I?” Malfoy was being polite again – but that wasn’t quite it. There was something strange in his tone, a mixture of awkwardness and comfort, a flagrant familiarity that immediately had Harry feeling like he was outside of something. But perhaps it was just the temple – everything was intimate here.
“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unless my eyes betray me, that is indeed a bow tie upon thy neck.”
Harry looked over at Malfoy, who had flushed pink, and tried to tamp down the laughter rising in his throat.
It was Harry’s turn to shuffle. The “For Dummies” copy jabbed uncomfortably into his ass. “Urm,” he said. “Not really.”
It was a bright, philandering shade of red. Like a bud caught ripening, displaying its fertility to the world. And here he was, participating himself in this social painting of his face. Art for art’s sake, art for sex’s sake. Were they so different to flowers after all?
This was good. He liked this. He dropped his hand back to the bed, touching the sheets around him. They were so, impossibly soft. He wanted to be that soft. He wanted someone to be that soft with him.
Two more shots later, and they had got Charlie to pretend to be a bowling ball and roll down the alley (which only worked halfway before he completely collapsed in the middle and the security guy decided to haul him back), Malfoy to attempt the bird of paradise pose on top of the table (which worked for about two seconds before he lost his balance and toppled over onto the adjacent sofa in a display of sheer hilarity according to drunk Harry’s brain, and Oceania to also hit on the girl behind the counter (which worked too well, and Harry was pretty sure they were maybe doing lesbian sex things earlier in the girls’ bathroom).
“Dragon vomit,” Draco explained. “Everywhere.” He made an explosive gesture with his fingers, and then dropped back down onto the grass. “All over Charlie’s jeans, too.” He smiled.
Draco slaps his hand away and Harry laughs at his expression. “Come on,” he says, pulling him to his feet and kissing his collarbone. “Let’s go be selfish.”
catching at the black glass of Harry’s living room. He thought he could see rain emptying itself into the gutter down the street.
But here – it was happening, his fingers were brushing the skin of his cheekbone, and then his palm was cresting the arc of his jaw, and it was all softer and smaller than Harry had known it would be. Malfoy’s face was very hot, and his eyes were still cast down, and Harry’s skin looked so very brown next to the mottled milk of Malfoy’s skin. He couldn’t get over it, how deep and warm his hand looked on Draco Malfoy’s face, and he didn’t mean to fetishize here but it really was exotic; Malfoy was as white as a dove, white as virginity, white as violence. Harry was holding him in place without using any force at all.
“Sometimes I swear you just love to fight,” said Draco. He was standing up, straightening his leggings with his free hand. In the other, he was barely keeping his cup of tea from visibly trembling.
It turned out the temple wasn’t actually a temple. It was a temple-like entryway, which led to another courtyard and a long set of stone steps at the far end, which seemed to lead to actual temples. Malfoy was in the corner of the courtyard, stacking the mats away in what appeared to be a spare room.
“It’s just so –“ Harry abruptly sits up, the sheets pooling at her hips. She gnaws on her lips as she thinks it through. “It’s so quaint. It’s just so…nice.”
Harry himself felt similar to how he had felt when he had first arrived at Gay Dragon Village. Like a tourist. Maybe it was because he wasn’t used to nightclubs, maybe it was because he was supposedly straight; maybe it was just him. Either way, despite his appearance, he once again felt that it was a palpable thing, his foreignness, expanding like a bubble around him.
“I,” said Harry, and stuttered to a brief halt, aware he was blushing, “It’s not – I didn’t – look, Malfoy said it. The other day.”
“You cannot tell me you saw that coming,” Ron bellowed from the bedroom. “ ‘Mione, you cannot tell me you actually predicted Harry –
“Tell me what it’s like then.” Delia spread her arms, cream satin brushing a pencil sharpener off the desk. She paid it no mind. “Sing for me, my angel of music.”
Harry wriggled closer. “To build a life for myself. Get better. Get happy. Be brave about it, like you said.”
“Draco,” said Harry. “Have you ever tried to actually read Jane Eyre? In the first chapter she feels the need to mention that Jane is reading a book about the history of British birds. British
“Those bastards,” said Malfoy. Oceania grinned and gestured for them to follow her. They headed towards the neighbouring forest and took the same path that they had taken the first time Harry had gone drinking with them.
“I won’t flirt with you if you don’t want me to, Harry,” he said, and then waved his hand. “Come on, or we really will miss the dances. Stop hugging that tree.”
Zambini raised his brows suggestively at Harry. “I’m all sorts of things you wouldn’t expect, Harry Potter.”
The next act opened up, a Queen with hair even redder than Ginny’s. They didn’t talk again until the next interlude.
“You said that about Draco,” said Hayden, voice dry again. They were running their finger along the handle of a spatula.
“I know you love me, Charlie,” Malfoy told him clearly, and he relented, leaning to rest his forehead on Oceania’s hair.
She shuffles closer to Draco and cups her cheek, drawing her in for a kiss. Draco opens her mouth obligingly – obliging it all. Harry’s tongue is sour and there is a white film on the inside of her lips. Draco opens her mouth more.
They kept stumbling down, the gravel crunching loudly under their feet. Draco didn’t say anything, and after a moment, Harry thought that he just wasn’t going to respond.
Draco pushed back his long white fringe and peered at Harry from underneath it. He smiled devilishly.
“Okay, Harry.” says Hermione, after a couple awkward seconds. “That’s fine.” She puts a hand over Harry’s.
It was strange, how this place would keep on being after he’d gone. That it had being before he had arrived. This place was bigger than him. He was glad for it.
“Please,” she whispers, growing more desperate as more buttons are undone. “Please, Harry – I can’t –“
“Does anyone?” The person smiled wryly. “I’m Hayden. You still have to meet everyone. Not that there’s a whole lot of us.”
Harry bit his lip. “Charlie wasn’t as good as you,” he said after a moment. He tried to look woeful. “Jane didn’t even let him stroke her.”
Charlie looked back up, froth somehow now on his forehead. “Right,” he said, “Yes, sorry. Excuse me, ma’am…” He turned to the girl behind the counter, who had totally been listening in on the entire conversation.
Potter comes over and sits down on a sofa. She crosses her legs and clasps her hands on one knee. “Malfoy,” she says again, voice so low it almost scrapes the floor. “It’s been a while.”
There was bit of queue. Delia rocked her weight from foot to foot, her reusable mug readied in one hand. The mug said,
“I don’t read books for their high morals,” he said, quite honestly, and Malfoy bit at his mouth.  Began to smile.
“Maybe that’s enough for today,” said Oceania. She was considering Harry carefully, smiling gently in a way that made Harry want to cry. He stood up and exhaled roughly, leaving her with Jane and walking away. When he got back to the trees, he ran a hand over the bark and blinked at the undergrowth, trying to get his breath back.
shrugged. She was smiling now. “It’s good to be honest,” she said happily. Harry was abruptly reminded of Luna.
He hadn’t understood it, so he had ignored it. He wondered what kind of person that made it him. Perhaps most of the wrong doings in the world could be explained away by that specific human flaw.
“Here,” she said. Her voice was soft. She took his hand and slowly stretched it out, pressing it to Jane’s nose. Harry felt Jane exhale a little roughly against his palm, but apart from that she didn’t move. He realised he was holding his breath, and let go.
“No, no.” Malfoy’s voice fell to a hush, and he gained confidence suddenly, standing up straighter. “Harry, you should see the way they fold right up on themselves and just…wait. For whatever I say. Whatever impulse I entertain. They’re so still. You wouldn’t believe it, that total submission, unless you’d seen it.”
“Yes. Harry here loves gay bars now. I guess gayness is contagious after all. Don’t tell the monks. Won’t you let us in, love?”
The walk back is always shorter than the walk there. Draco comes down the stone path and goes into her cottage. Somehow, it seems even smaller than before, but that’s okay. The paint is peeling off in places as well, and at least that she can improve.
It didn’t bother him, like he might’ve expected. Instead, he felt more relaxed around Tom than anyone else.
Harry applauded as she swept off to the side, where there was an iphone lying on top of a pair of huge speakers. She fiddled with the password. A familiar whir of alarm bells rang through the building.
Harry paused in his shuffling and regarded her. She blinked back and rubbed her nose with the side of her hand.
Malfoy was still giving him that look. Harry glanced over at where Mayo was chewing on the meat and repeated what he’d said in his head.
“Neither am I.” This was already convoluted. Harry didn’t understand why Malfoy was talking in circles. “Just tell me.”
Oceania clapped loudly and whooped as he got up and walked over to the counter. He didn’t know why he kept allowing these things to happen to him.
“Neither can I,” Charlie said cheerfully. “But I didn’t get sorted into Gryffindor to stand idly by whilst there are ceilings to be painted. Come on, Harry. Be a champ.”
As it happened, Charlie was standing underneath the impressive archway. He came over and took some of the coloured sand bags out of Harry and Hayden’s arms, smiling brightly at Harry.
Harry looked down between his feet at him. Draco put the extra pair of sunglasses on his head on top of the ones already on his eyes.
Draco feels her breath hitch and fall like a child’s – and she feels like a child, like the whole world is so much bigger than she is, and it’s all absurd and out of control – and then Potter presses her lips to Draco’s forehead and puckers them.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and Hayden smirked and Harry sort of felt like he was being bullied for being straight, except saying that out loud with this lot would probably end with him rotating on a spit, so he settled for a long sip of shite beer.
“Like…” Harry racked his brain. “I’ve gone diving in Majorca. I learnt how to make pearls. I’ve shaved my head bald. I’ve built a chair from scratch. I’ve made a soufflé. I’ve visited every Starbucks in Glasgow.”
“No offense,” said Ron, “But I’d say they were a bit more than wrong, mate. Parkinson tried to hand you over to Old Voldey, remember?”
“I’m sorry I don’t have a bloody leg kink!” Malfoy cried out, waving one hand expressively in the air. “God forbid I enjoy other body parts.”
Oceania stayed with Jane for a few more moments, and then stood up. She looked over to Harry and beckoned.
Malfoy came and sat beside him. Harry could practically smell his amusement. He growled and rolled over, well aware he was throwing a toddler tantrum but to fed up to care.
Hayden lived in one of the cottages just below. There was a dampness to the evening, the kind that suspended the day in that grey space between afternoon and evening. It clung, thick and persistent, to the growth around them that grew steadily higher as they deepened into the residential area. Hayden’s cottage was the last one in line.
“Fuck,” groans Malfoy, and she arches her back as Harry rubs her, easing her open with her fingers before pushing in the tip, teasing.
Harry leant back and dropped his hand. Dropping the hand made holding it in the first place seem more incriminating. He brushed his fingers over the dusty carpet and looked away.
The third eye chakra, Harry had learned, was for intuition, for inner vision. He didn’t fully believe in it, but the metaphor worked, and that was what mattered.
“That’s why – he had a lover. Some boy he kept safe in an abandoned house.” Draco rushes on, blinking back the stinging in her eyes. “I’m not saying it’s excusable, what he did. I’m just saying – he wasn’t… made of stone. That’s how you made it sound.”
For some reason this made the heat churn up into Harry’s neck, his face. He could feel it under his beard.
Harry Potter. He could acknowledge their shitty, childish, fucking cringy ass past all he wanted, but Draco? Draco was –
Potter nods. “I like having tea with you.” she breathes. Her head almost seems to be swinging back and forth, slowly, a flag in the wind. “I like it lots.”
“Thank you,” said Harry, as Hermione pressed a hot cup of tea into his hands. He was sitting on one of the sofas in the lounge. The sunlight illuminated the wafts of heat swirling up from the tea cup.
“I’m glad you think so.” Draco rolls onto her back as well, and stares up at the ceiling. Harry looks back at her over her shoulder and frowns.
“Yeah.” Charlie scratched his head. “Thing is, well, she’s not quite right. I don’t really know how to put it. Sounds a bit stupid out loud.”
The water sluices over Draco’s head and back, and she shivers as Harry’s hands come up around her torso, trailing over her stomach and breast and up to her shoulder. Harry kisses the back of Draco’s neck, her mouth somehow hotter than the shower water, and Draco sighs and relaxes back into her body. Everywhere Harry touches prickles, and shakes, and aches, and the ache is so sour it’s sweet, and the ache is so sweet that Draco arches her back and groans.
And he looked at Draco like he finally understood everything. It wouldn’t be so bad if he did, Draco thought. It had taken him long enough.
Fear was a curious thing. It was one of the primary colours of emotion – a key ingredient in so many of the other, more complex feelings that life had to offer. It was simple – but no matter how many other feelings it was mixed in with, its presence was always distinctly salient. You could smell it in the air, know it in the bite of each inhale. It knew you. Fear, like love, was powerful because it was intimate.
“I’ve spent a significant portion of my recent life telling you what to do, Harry,” said Draco. His voice was warm and quiet with sleep. “You’ll have to specify.”
Harry slid off the stool and crouched over to pick up as Malfoy and Oceania came jogging over. They were both pink and flushed happy, like school children in a playground.
“Hayden,” said Tom. His tone was soft, but somehow reproving. Harry was surprised when Hayden met his eyes and only twitched a brow before shutting up.
When Harry had first gotten to Gay Dragon Village, he had thought Malfoy was a clown, with his leggings, his makeup, his obscene jokes, his – well, if Harry was being honest – his
Harry was suddenly immensely grateful that she had asked him to come gardening with her today. She was right – it was better like this. It didn’t go away, but it was better. Became…less immediate.
“How the…” Draco trailed off and took his hands back down. They dangled at his sides. “How did you get up there? How did you get her to…you know what? Never mind. Never fucking mind. You’re fucking Harry Potter. How could I forget? How could I
“Malfoy. Draco.” Harry pushed himself up on one hand. Malfoy had succumbed to it again. “God. Damn you. Why are you so giggly all the time?”
He managed to catch his breath, wiping his hands over his face. And then, with his eyes still closed, chuckling, he whispered, “The coke is still two-fifty,” and lost it again.
Later, when he got home, he put the coffee machine on. Oceania was staying with him, but Hermione had agreed to show her some of her charity work, so he was alone in the house. He thumbed the curtains thoughtfully as he waited. Maybe he should get another bookcase. His was almost full now.
Ironically, Harry did have tame dreams that night. When he woke up, he woke up feeling uncomfortable.
said Hermione, quickly grabbing up her napkin and holding it out uselessly in his direction. Harry thumped him on the back in a kind of encouraging way.
“Does it bother you?” she says a couple minutes later, as Draco pulls her onto the bed, a hand on the back of her neck. “That I like boys as well?”
Harry had almost lost the entirety of his thought. Malfoy’s lashes swept his cheeks, darting back and forth like an unhappy butterfly, and then Harry figured it out.
Draco just blinked lazily and kept smiling. “This isn’t high school,” he drawled, but scooted up anyway, raising himself up onto his elbows.
“Today is an exciting day,” announced Oceania as she plopped down opposite Harry and Hayden. “A historical day, in fact.”
Oceania stared at them blankly, which was so unlike her that it was highly disconcerting. Harry’s darted looks between the two of them.
Malfoy sighed and stepped away. He bent down and rummaged through the backpack he’d brought. “Just put the trousers on,” he called over his shoulder, “You’re only amusing up to a point.”
Harry thought about what he wanted. But he couldn’t get past how nice the forest was, and the mountains, and the company. Maybe this was all there was to want.
They both stared dumbly at him, stunned into silence. Neither of them said anything as Harry paid and they stepped back out into the street. The day seemed very bright.
“Surely,” said Harry, as they got out the taxi and stepped back into the bustling grey noise of the West End at night, “there is nothing wrong with pen-paling.”
The song for this chapter is Pretty Boy by TAEMIN, which is absolutely Draco's theme song, so every time he enters a scene please feel free to go ahead and press play for the full Depressed Gay Dragon ExperienceTM. Also, thank you to everyone who has left comments thus far!! I go back and reread all of them when I feel sad, and also when I feel happy.
There was not a single part of that speech that did not catch Harry off guard. He opened and closed his mouth, and then opened it again.
“Well, it’s not like you can blame me. Have you met yourself? You don’t really give the impression of being a laborious academic.”
“Did that vision involve a violently vomiting crayon, perchance?” Malfoy asked politely, and Harry snorted, before trying to turn it into a cough.
“Shakespeare had a boyfriend.” Harry points out, but ducks his head as he drags the shirt back over his torso.
“You can’t tell him I said that,” Harry hissed desperately. Draco would probably feed him to one of the dragons.
“Hibernating.” Benjamin picked up the Merlot and drank directly from it. Malfoy stole a stool from a table occupied by a couple who had gone out for a smoke. They both settled in and ordered more wine.
Whatever Malfoy said next was muffled by more lasagne, which unfortunately reminded Harry of last week, when Malfoy had been trying to talk through the gag. He shifted in his seat.
“It’s mostly Draco that calls it that.” Hayden was still using that careful voice. “He reckons the dragons attract them.”
“Shit is right,” Draco snapped, and Harry’s lips quirked. Draco glared – god, it was exactly like how he had imagined it in Hogwarts – and then he glanced down. His eyes widened.
Draco walked over. He felt aware of every inch of his body, the way he was being watched. He hopped onto the edge of the table, just to make a show of being at home, and then, in his dullest voice, read the label of the Cognac.
“Well.” Malfoy gestured to the mirror on the adjacent wall. “Aren’t you going to take a look at yourself?”
“Are you okay?” Malfoy was standing there, amongst the trees. He had phrased the words in his mouth very carefully. Harry could hear it in the way he had spoken. His fingers dug into the bark a little tighter, and he forced himself to breathe deeper.
As it was, all he did was make sure Harry was stable, and promptly left before he could regain consciousness. It had been a long enough day.
Draco took a breath. He closed his eyes again, softly, softly – trying to contain the strange, sudden urge to tremble that was stringing its way up through his body. Everything was dark, but it didn’t feel dark, and Harry’s hand was still touching him. He was telling him to breathe. He was –
They sat like that for a while. All this time, Harry had been wondering what love felt like – it turned out, maybe, it was just like this. He had been right. It was almost morning. The birds grew louder; the sun came up.
“I’ll show you funny,” said Draco crossly, and unzipped Harry’s jeans with fervour. He wrapped a hand around Harry’s erection without even looking at it.
She opens her mouth, tipping forward and letting her arms wrap around her middle as her fingernails bury themselves above her elbows – but if she screams, and no one is around to hear it, is she even really screaming at all?
Oceania maintained eye contact with her for a few moments, and it was clear something was been exchanged. And then she leaned forward and pressed a hand to her nose. Jane let her.
“I just don’t understand,” Draco said eventually. He no longer looked pained, just tired. Harry hated that he had made him look this way. He hated all of this.
“That’s good,” said Oceania, and she sounded genuinely pleased. That was the lovely thing about Oceania. She was always so genuinely good.
Malfoy sighed but came and sat down, cross-legged, on one of the mats, but not before snatching one sweet off an offering tray. To Harry’s surprise, Tom didn’t even blink. The sound of Malfoy unwrapping it filled the temple as Harry came and sat down.
He almost laughed. There was nothing in him that wanted to limit her happiness, and now that he understood he wasn’t afraid.
Tom nodded, still studying. That was another thing that Harry liked about Tom. He never made a judgement on Harry’s feelings.
Harry just smiled. He felt like he should be surprised. But something about this felt as inevitable as everything else that had happened.
If Harry blushed any further he might simultaneously catch fire. It would probably be for the best. “Just,” he said. “Like. All the obvious stuff. You know. Their hair. And figures. And like, legs.”
“Alright,” he said, wiping his mouth and coming to sit at the squat, plastic table. “Let us commence with our fates.”
“Get in some good shots. I want to see frilly knickers, whips, that sort of thing. We want to dig into the dirt.”
Luna was looking at him. There was something very knowing about the way she looked. Then she straightened up and asked, “Would you like some more olives?”
She turned to Harry and handed him the glasses. “Come on,” she said. “Let’s go and sit on one of the sofas. It’ll be nicer.”
“Well, he was,” said Oceania. Then at Harry’s confused expression, she clarified, “They used to date.”
“Fuck,” Harry says again, panting as they step out from behind the glass barricade of the air-conditioned air-port and onto the dusty pavement. “This really isn't England, huh.”
“I don’t think that’s out-of-character,” said Harry. “I’ve done plenty of things you don’t know about.”
This running didn’t look like healthy running. He couldn’t even tell if it was helping. The familiar compression in his chest and nature smells weren’t calming him this time. It only felt like his body couldn’t keep up with his mind.
The way the light was hitting Harry’s eyes made them look liquid. There was something curious and tentative, something that, to Draco, looked as if it wanted to reach out and touch him. Perhaps it was his imagination. He’d been reading too much.
Malfoy nodded sharply, still not looking at him. “Merlin, the finish on this. I should do something like it myself. And what have we here?” He was opening the cabinets, turning his back to Harry. “Shakers? Are you a bartender as well as a journalist as well as being the saviour of the Wizarding World? Remarkable. A true renaissance man.”
“It happens every year,” Draco added. He was sprawled out on a yoga mat at the bottom of the wall and was wearing sunglasses, both on his head and on his face. “Things are going to fill up in our village too.”
Harry sat down. The smell of the prayer mats and the incense were so familiar that sometimes he even dreamed about them now.
Once he was dressed he went through into the lounge/hallway/kitchen. He let himself remember, from a distance, all the mornings he had spent in here on his own, which turned into afternoons, which turned into evenings, which turned into nights – hiding, always hiding.
And so he didn’t. He was tired. He went back to his flat and the blue grew around him, spilling like a running tap. He couldn’t find where to turn it off. And so it spilt, and it spilt, and he drowned.
Blaise stopped sitting back. “That you can,” he said appreciatively, and only briefly admired the aforementioned asset. “But no one looks quite as good in a pinstripe suit as yours truly.”
“You think I’m weak,” he said, and it didn’t sound sharp, like an accusation. But it didn’t sound soft, either.
“What the fuck,” said Harry, and raised his hands to the heavens, “Gay Dragon Village? What does that even mean?”
Oceania tilted her head at him. Unlike Harry, she didn’t seem to care much about using the bathroom, and was standing in front of him with her coveralls already draped around her hips and her bright green bra on show. Harry supposed he should feel weird about this, but all his concern was rather more focused on the prospect of the mesh.
“I love fields,” said Harry quietly, and Draco looked over at him again. He had his eyes closed, breathing in. Draco leaned in, almost without choice.
Oceania looked over at him and grinned. Then her eyes fell to his body, and she made an “O” with her forefinger and thumb and kissed the tip of it.
It was strange, but Harry had never been to a temple. It was different from a church, or a cathedral. Not so polished and proper. Not so civil. It roused something primal inside him, some deep-rooted instinct of worship, of silence. A desire to go to his knees. To offer himself.
There was a knock on the door. Harry rolled off the bed and went to open it. He hoped it wasn’t the receptionist – whose name he really ought to have learned by now – here to half-heartedly throw his duvet around under the pretence of ‘room service’. He wondered what on earth it was she did during the day. He wondered if there was anyone else running this hotel.
“God, Hermione,” Harry said. His eyes were a bit watery himself. He had never been able to stand seeing her cry. “Come here.”
“Is this what you wanted?” growls Draco. “All this ass, all this pussy, these tits? Is this what the fuck you wanted?”
Malfoy smiled wryly at Hayden. “What Hayden is trying to say,” he drawled, “is that straight people are privileged hypocrites who are used to having the world cater to their sexualities in every aspect of their lives and can’t seem to appreciate a perspective wherein the world hates your gay dick and everything attached, thus forcing you to crush all normal human desire right up until the cusp of adulthood, which you then spend traumatically dealing with years of repression and shame via the comforting validation of gay jokes, and also, fuck right off.”
And how femininity could be this terrifying thing – a place where love and violence overlapped like lips over teeth, and teeth over tongue – and how everyone knew that girl’s bodies could be soft and beautiful, and that they wobbled all over when they loved – but failed to understand how a woman’s back could snap in pleasure like some kind of injury, how slender fingers could coil around bed sheets and hair in some kind of unrestrained destruction – and how orgasm could feel like some violent, torturous thing, when the woman you love cannot reach you, cannot touch you through all your wobbling, rounded flesh; and try as you might bind yourself to love to save you, all that ever comes of it is this breaking, be it your shell or your bones.
“Free isn’t quite the right word,” Harry went on. His voice was soft, almost indistinct in the small space. “But he made me feel…better. Healthy. Like…being in the sun.”
“Thank you,” said Malfoy, breaking the silence. He was still seated on the floor, looking up at Harry. The angle made his eyes seem bigger. Harry didn’t look at him long enough to read his expression.
His body was tenser than it had been for a while – perhaps because he hadn’t slept well. At three o’clock, he had opened his eyes and looked at the moon – it was almost full, almost old. Soon it would be new. Harry had stared at it as if it would swell to completion in the short time he was watching.
Harry leaned towards him. “Do you want to clean my glasses?” he asked in what he hoped what was a semi-endearing tone. Even without his vision, he could tell that Draco had gone all pointy.
Draco looks at her, her heart hammering in her chest, and then Harry slowly lowers her smile onto Draco’s mouth and kisses her again. Her body is hot and slow as it moves against Draco’s skin, and all Draco wants to do is wind her arms around to the small of her back and secure her there.
“I want to be respected,” said Draco. The wind was cold on his face. In his peripheral vision, everything was green.
let it just be said that I never anticipated that bowling would become such a present part of this story.
Hermione reached out and put a hand over his. It was so much like what she’d done right before he’d left that for a moment Harry felt dizzy.
“Sit down.” Malfoy grabbed his shoulder over the table, even though he was already sitting. The hand didn’t push, just held him in place. “Don’t tell her I said that. Who did you see last time you were here?”
There was a longer pause. And then Draco finally moved, the sound of the turning duvet was incredibly loud in the small room.
“Draco’s a complicated person,” she told him. “If you really want to understand him, you should ask him yourself.”
Harry looked out to where Malfoy and Oceania were still bowling. Malfoy had his hands in raised triumphantly in the air, and as he watched, Oceania leaped onto his back and tackled him, getting an arm around his head. They both crumpled to the floor, the sound of their laughing audible from across the room.
When he reached back down, it was to reveal a small pink bow, perched atop the “head” of the sunflower.
“No,” said Harry, nonsensically. He felt very aware that he was topless. He tried to cover his torso with his arms without making it look like he was trying to. “Did you need something?”
The blue made you want to run from it, because it scared you, because it was bigger than you. But if you didn’t swim into the waves, how could you ever expect to reach calmer water? Draco was in the loch of his mind again, but this time it wasn’t Draco, it was Harry, and the water was climbing his skin; and he was letting it. He was going deeper. He was not afraid.
His hand was already closing back around Harry’s cock. It was a bad angle, and dry – Harry didn’t care. Draco was bundled on his lap; he was close; he wasn’t going anywhere.
Malfoy held onto him as he sobbed. He wished he was anywhere but here. He wished it was anything but this.
Tom was looking at him. He also looked like he had figured something out, but he didn’t seem to mind the answer. When he saw that Harry was looking back, he smiled.
Malfoy looked at him. He looked at him as the blonde Queen finished and the crowd clapped. He looked at him as the curtains lowered. He looked at him as people were putting on their coats.
“I also don’t understand why this is necessary.” Harry gestured to the leather waistcoat Malfoy had got him in earlier. “This isn’t even fireproof.”
“Fuck you,” he said again, quieter, and then turned to look at where Oceania and Charlie and Counter Girl were still fucking about. He looked at all the empty alleys. He looked at the lights.
So she does, she winds her arms there and lower, gripping Harry’s hips and buttocks in her hands, and Harry mumbles against Draco’s lips and presses her thigh right into her.
Hope you guys enjoyed that chapter! Bit shorter, but the next one's looking like it'll be thicc. If you did enjoy, please leave me a quick review and/or kudos! This chapter's song is Human by Rag 'n' Bone Man. Merry Christmas Eve!!! I swear I'll try and upload the next chapter quicker - it should be more doable as I don't have exams now. Thanks for reading :)
This must be the earliest I've ever uploaded a new chapter. You can thank quarantine for that, I suppose. This chapter's song is The Love We Almost Had by Rhiannon Giddens.
“Astoria. Astoria Rabbit.” When Harry continued to stare blankly, Benjamin stopped prodding his eyelash and hummed exasperatedly. “The blond fag whose house we’re in.”
Potter leans back onto the counter. She picks up a cup and looks at it, whistling. Draco shuts the door, and frowns.
“Yeah.” Harry leaned against the side, ducking his head. He was in his most holey pair of sweatpants. He normally saved his worst clothes for yoga, because they always got so sweaty.
Harry shook his head, glancing briefly at Tom, whose smile had softened at the edges. “Nothing. I just. I can’t…it’s a long time.” He finished lamely.
Harry kind of wanted to ask, but the pressure was now entirely on him to inject at least a modicum of professionalism into the conversation. Otherwise, he was simply sitting in Draco Malfoy’s kitchen having a gossip about his sex life.
Pansy just made a sort of “mm” sound. She was observing Harry in a way that was so rakish he felt like he was deeply underperforming. He opened his mouth, and it was a faucet turned on.
Maybe it was ridiculous – but as he did, he felt the blue begin to dilute in him. It was like the air became less humid, clearing with each tug it took to filter it through his lungs. Maybe it was ridiculous – but maybe he was just being narrow-minded. He would never have done something like this in Scotland.
and Draco says, “Come here,” and Harry gasps and squeezes her eyes shut and digs in her fingernails, and her hips go erratic as she comes onto Draco, and Draco watches, brushing her hair off her face and reaching up to kiss the corner of Harry’s mouth.
Draco sat back a little. Their faces were very close; close in a way that was closer than kissing. Draco’s eyes were almost colourless in the lamplight.
“It’s in the bathroom cupboard.” Oceania emerged from the drawers triumphantly, her fist clutched around a ball of fabric, although at this point it could still contain as yet unknown horrors. Harry waited before Malfoy had brushed past into the bathroom before saying, “Isn’t a mac a type of sandwich?”
confused,” Oceania piped up eventually, resting her chin in her hands. Hayden smiled at her fondly, which was a curiously unexpected expression on their pale face.
It was only after living in Gay Dragon Village for a while that Harry had considered what had actually happened to Draco Malfoy, the person. His father would have just gone to Azkaban, his mother mute with despair, or perhaps selfish with relief. Perhaps she moved to France with a handful of house elves, or locked herself in the master bedroom and only consumed cold soups, or invited over other surviving Death Eaters and thrown tea parties above the dungeons still sticky with muggle blood and fantasised about another war.
They were walking back to her cottage together when Harry felt it. The curious, magical tugging to the side of him, perhaps towards the set of trees to his right. He touched Oceania’s shoulder.
Malfoy finally opens her eyes again, staring up at Harry, dark hair spilling all into her face and sticking to her skin, and swallows.
“Anything you like, dear,” Harry said, grinning too, and tried to move his head back further but couldn’t. Draco was surprisingly silent.
“I think that might just be Malfoys,” said Harry, straightening up. Then he bent over and shook his water-logged hair in Malfoy’s direction. Malfoy, honest to God, squealed.
“Do you want to take that off?” he asked, nodding at Malfoy’s waterproof. It was bright yellow, and had pink flowers stitched on to it. Malfoy opened his mouth, and then nodded quickly, tugging it off his arms and handing it to Harry’s outstretched hand. Harry also put it on the bed, though with slightly more care. Some of those flowers looked like they might come off.
Suddenly there was a shaky exhale. Draco laughed, a little, incredulous. “Harry,” he said, and had his voice always sounded like that? It was so desperately true. “I have always wanted you.”
Oceania grinned, the light glinting off her eyes. She leaned back in the plastic chair, swinging until her back hit the wall of the corner shop.
“Would you?” Harry shot back, and then looked away. His gaze unfocused, and the image of the letter rose up again. Then it refocused and fell on a floating light. It was only then that he really noticed Hayden’s house.
He didn’t say a word until they were seated at the deli – it was really was close by – and their coats were being taken away by the waiter.
“Like.” Harry made a clumsy gesture with his hands, a flurry of movement before dropping them back to the grass. “
All Draco had wanted to do earlier was look away, but now it was like being trapped in a serpent’s gaze. Harry was in front of him, his hands reaching. Sitting down, he was taller. His hands were on Draco’s hips. His thumbs were curving around to press at the silk over Draco’s inner thighs. Slowly, slowly, they slid outwards, parting Draco’s legs.
“Get off me!” he squealed, laughing, trying to wriggle out of her grasp. “No – God, woman, I’m a poof! A flagrant poof! Control yourself!”
“Shacklebolt sends his wishes,” Draco had said in the ward, stepping forward only to pass Harry some of the papers he had been working on since the incident. He had kept his eyes trained down on the carefully drawn diagrams. “I figured you might want these, considering your dysfunctional relationship with inactivity.”
Harry just smiles a little, despite herself, and leans against the doorframe. Malfoy is so small, she realises suddenly. Her presence is normally so vast, so liquid – filling up the container of their setting. Without her makeup, her dangerously straight hair, her fucking thongs – she becomes more real. Most touchable. More honest. Until now, Harry has only been fucking an idea.
Malfoy pushes back against Harry, trying to free her wrists, expression murderous. But although they’re roughly the same size, Harry is broader, and besides, she still has her magic. Malfoy brings her closer with her legs when Harry starts licking at her cleavage, scraping her teeth over the thin material of her bra, and she groans like an animal in pain.
Draco stares as Potter takes an extended sip of tea.  She stares as a drop of water rolls down from the corner of Potter’s mouth and clings to her chin.
Harry laughed, a little breathlessly. He kept tracing along the white line of the pinkie. Then he dropped his hand and tipped his head back. God, the blue was so vivid.
Charlie lifted his head from the straw. There was froth on his nose. “Draco,” he said, sounding quite beside himself. “This is miraculous.”
In the end, Draco looked up one night that was so like that night before it all and saw the constellation he was named after. He pointed it out to Harry.
Harry shook his head and stood up as well. “We’re done,” he said. Malfoy went to gather up his stuff, smoothing his fingers over the front of his leather satchel. Jane had stopped chewing, and let Malfoy stroke her. Harry tried to tamp down the familiar splash of jealousy in his gut.
They walked back to the camp. Harry wasn’t sure if it was appropriate, but he didn’t know what else to do. He took Malfoy back up to his room, gave him spare clothes to sleep in. After doing all that, falling to sleep on the same bed didn’t seem strange. In the sensible grey shapes of his room, the memory of the loch seemed unreal.
“We connected,” she told them all, mysteriously and with great significance. Harry blinked over the edge of his cider, but no one noticed.
Malfoy waved a pink bottle in front of Harry that said “THE THIRST IS REAL” and in smaller writing underneath, “PINK”.
In the dream, it happened like this. Draco was in a lake in the Himalayas and the moon was above him. It was a perfect setting. He took off his clothes and went into the lake. It was almost a perfect memory.
“I don’t blame you,” said Malfoy. When he smirked, dainty half-moon lines appeared at the left side of his face. “Dragons are pretty scary.”
Draco swallowed. It was a long, slow swallow, that seemed to move in more than his throat. “Okay,” he whispered, again, and closed his eyes. His lashes fluttered against his cheeks.
“That’s good.” Oceania tilted her head to the side as if she was trying to read something that was a strange angle. “I thought you would.”
Did she think she was okay, making tea every morning, in the same cup, in the same kitchen, in the same cottage on the same island, boiling water in a pot? Did she really think that this was fine, that she could live like this – because she could, she could go through the rest of her pathetic existence making tea in a cottage and staring out of the window, comfortable, always staying dry when it rained – but did that ever mean it was
“What the fuck are you laughing for?” Draco scowled, even as his hand returned to Harry’s chest, dragging it down over Harry’s happy trail. Not like someone who had just professed their unrequited love at all.
This was about the way the ground trembled and then suddenly fluttered away beneath them, about the way the trees elongated parallel to their knees as they traced up their trunks. This was about the grass and green, which had been such a freedom to Harry before, seamlessly parting ways for them. This was about the way the world of Gay Dragon Village opened up like a cornucopia beneath them, and floated away.
So now here he was. At the precipice of sanity, and probably his heterosexuality, too. Harry briefly questioned all the consecutive decisions that had led him up to this moment in his life, and then stepped out of his room.
Draco goes into town to buy sugar. And then she comes home – and the walk down the stone path is really much prettier this way, it really is – and then she makes the tea, and every step of it feels like making love.
Jane blinked at him. From this angle, her eyes looked even bigger, glossy and black and deep. How could you ever really know what a dragon was feeling?
“The dragons?” Harry also threw up his hands. Oceania raised a fist for him to bump without looking in his direction.
Muted saffron was settling into the space, exhaling light onto the walls and furniture. Hayden and Oceania were sleeping next to him, sprawled across the pillows and each other. Oceania’s foot was on Harry’s stomach, Hayden’s elbow brushing his hair.
Harry felt his eyebrows go up. Malfoy laughed and then, tugging on Hayden’s arm, said, “Come on golden boy. You won’t lose your Gryffindor badge of honour in one night.”
Now Malfoy looked at him. His eyes weren’t as big as Harry remembered, but they were clear all the same.
When they finally navigated their way back to the bar, Oceania ordered some iced water for the two of them. She hopped up onto one of the stools, and as Harry sat down, he realised how grateful he was for a break.
“But, I do also think it was good that it ended. It’s not really in Draco’s nature, I think, no matter how much he wishes it was.”
“I know,” said Oceania, but managed to swallow her grin before turning to Harry. “Harry,” she said. “Are you doing anything this afternoon?”
Charlie met Harry’s eye. “I didn’t buy them,” he clarified, apparently having seen something in Harry’s expression. “Draco bought them for me. One for each birthday so far.”
Harry blinked. He found that he didn’t want to move away from the wooden door or its many strange locks. But Malfoy was sitting down on his bed and looking at Harry gently and if he stayed by this door, he’d never get anywhere.
His body sagged. He crumpled to the ground, Malfoy’s arms slipping from his stomach to his arm pits, losing their grasp. He felt aware of Malfoy crouching down behind him, the hands hesitating against the wall of Harry’s back. The tears had crystallised in his eyes, stiffened like sap down his cheeks, and he rubbed at his face with the heel of his hands. Beside him, the loch reached for him, its glistening surface impassive.
“Wuthering Heights.” Draco reached for the book and passed it to Harry like a child showing off his new drawing. “You might not have heard of it though.”
“Great.” Oceania beamed at him. The she pulled on her top in one fluid motion. It had a picture of Putin in a tutu.
Harry was careful with his next words. He remembered the shade of red that had tinged Malfoy’s cheeks up on the mountain. “Where have you got to?” he asked.
He had expected to get the letter. He hadn’t thought there would be a problem with the letter. But now the letter was here, and Harry was leaving it on a hotel floor and stepping around it every morning. Harry was avoiding his room more than usual because of it. Harry was running, at every opportunity, around the perimeter of Gay Dragon Village, and he was always running away from it.
It was the second Thursday of the month, and according to the stunted population of Gay Dragon Village, that meant it was Charlie Night. When asked to further explain what Charlie Night entailed, Harry had simply been told that they were going bowling.
Harry tilted his head to the side. He smiled a little. “Urm,” he said, not bothering to keep the confusion out of his tone. “Okay.”
“They’re a tribute to Vincent,” said Oceania shyly, stroking the bristled end of her brush. “I’ve always liked him. I feel like we would’ve got along.”
“Oh my god,” he said, raising his voice. “You know the word chakra? Harry, do you, like, do yoga or something?”
The grass was well-trodden where they walked. It wasn’t too long before the trees thinned a little, and then it opened up. Not quite a clearing, but almost. There was a house – a cottage.
“Hello,” whispers Draco. She tucks her hand under her jaw and nestles her head closer. Harry smiles.
“Catch.” Harry only had a moment to half-inhale before he was opening his hands out, instinctively, to catch whatever the hell it was. He blinked, and looked down at the yoga mat. It was pink.
Then her knees really do buckle, and then Harry is there, an arm around her, frowning deeper – and for the first time since Draco’s seen her again, looking focused.
At the very beginning, Draco didn’t let himself think about that either. And then he realised what he was doing, and made himself stop.
“Because.” Draco shrugged his shoulders, incredulous. His eyes were still very wide. “It’s your first flight. It’s tradition. It’s sacred. It’s…supposed to be about the bon –”
He was good. You couldn’t get that good without practising at all. Harry had seen him wear it often. He thought about Malfoy, up in wherever it was he lived, applying makeup like it was just another part of his morning routine. Like a girl.
It wasn’t all that easy, in truth, to cast a patronus with the sickening crack of Harry Potter’s body playing background, but Draco was good at his job. Very good. So when his patronus emerged, it was no surprise to see its full form.
Harry’s hands were trembling, which was ridiculous, because he’d been living in Gay Dragon Village for at least a month now. Jane was in front of him, in all her towering green glory, and Harry swallowed. What was he thinking when he said he wanted to tame dragons?
“Oh.” Harry swallowed, and was a bit relieved when she looked back down. A slice of sunlight cut over her side-profile. She had spoken about all of this very easily, a simple recounting of facts, like telling a fairy-tale, but it must have been strange. Very strange, to only figure something so essential out once you were already practically adult.
He had been afraid of it for a long time. But it was here now. It had always been here. Of course. It lived inside him.
“Oh jeez,” said Blaise. “We’ve reached this stage of the evening.” He waved a waiter over and politely asked for a round of shots.
He closed his eyes for one quick moment. “I,” he said, and cleared his throat, “He said that this was… “Gay Dragon Village”.”
In the most respectful and spiritually enlightened way possible, Harry thought that the dances were fucking sick.
It was the only way to ever really go, after all. The grass and mud, cold and compressed beneath the roughened bits of his feet. He felt it between his toes first, the change from ground to silt to water-surface; the gradual dampening, and then the sinking in. He was up to shins. He was up to his knees.
Draco’s eyes – which were normally so grey – seemed vivid and vibrant with the help of the camp fire, the searing flames flickering hotly in the liquid of his pupils. He smiled when Harry looked at him, and raised a brow and a bottle in sync. Harry felt the heat flicker in him, too.
“Alllright,” said Charlie, his eyes darting between the two of them as he interrupted their glaring. “Maybe we should, uhh, go over, you know. What actually has been a-happening.”
soup drinking?” Harry pushed himself up cross-legged next to Malfoy. “I’m not sure if I’m ready for this.”
He broke off, inclining his head even more to the side. He hadn’t meant to say that last line. It wasn’t necessary.
Harry wasn’t good at finding paths in anything. He was nearly always lost. Right now, he felt attached to reality as he knew it by little more than a thread, with the music playing so loud it was practically grasping his head and Malfoy dancing like that in front of him, his skin glistening with sweat. No one should have been able to look good in neon mesh.
Harry had to swallow down his laughter. For a moment, they both enjoyed the simple pleasure of the empty cafeteria combined with the soothing clacking sounds of a tea cosy in the process of production.
But then she catches Malfoy’s eye – Malfoy who is dressed in a slinky silver dress which barely covers her crotch, Malfoy, who is quite obviously not wearing a bra – or maybe Malfoy catches her eye, but either way she finds the pair of them having a stand off by the bar again, only Malfoy is definitely tipsy.
Kissing became such a transformative thing when knowledge was there. When Harry kissed Draco, he thought about all the little things that made him up, like his leggings and the way he spoke and his dragon and the movement of his wrist as he gelled through his hair – and the way he tried, the way he always seemed to be trying, so hard and so earnest it was like a natural energy moving with the earth. When Draco kissed Harry back, it was a similar thing. His pale hand came up and brushed the ridge of Harry’s jaw, right where you could it open. His tongue pressed into Harry’s lower lip, and then slipped inside. It was a consummation. His teeth bit down on the flesh. Harry was hard in his jeans.
It was easy to forget, sometimes, how much of Gay Dragon Village was about nature. Sometimes, Harry got so caught up in the distractions of the dragons and the yoga and the people and the unforgiving silence of his own four walls that he let himself forget – but the wilderness was always there, brimming peaceably at the edges of it all. It was a reminder that none of this belonged to them.
“Alright,” Draco eventually snapped, reaching for the proffered glasses, but he didn’t sound angry. If anything, he sounded a little flustered. Harry’s mind creeped towards the last time he’d been here, back to when he’d been sitting and watching the shape of Draco’s sharp profile. He remembered the way Draco had been looking at him, and the feeling of something felt but not yet articulated swelling in the back of his mind. He was feeling it now, again, and the cotton of Draco Malfoy’s red jumper was almost unbearably soft against his cheek.
“Blaise,” said Luna, and although his eyes remained glittery, he leaned back from Harry, reaching for an olive and eating in self-satisfied fashion.
This was starting to sound eerily like Draco’s own complaints. He eyed Harry warily. Not that Harry would pick it up.
Harry leaned against the door frame. “No,” he said. “Even if I had thought about it, I would still have got it wrong. You are –” He had thought he was going to say “too much to fit in my mind.” But halfway through he had realised he was going to say “unlike anyone I’ve ever known.”
“I don’t know,” she said slowly. “The kind of person to eat a Sunday roast even when it isn’t Sunday? You always were a bit odd, truth be told, but never particularly…adventurous.”
Draco didn’t say anything. All that happened was that his mouth moved, almost inadvertently, and his thumb twitched over his clenched fist. The air came rushing back into Harry’s lungs like water. He gasped.
“Cut down again by my quicksilver wit.” Delia gave up on trying to uncross her legs and spun back around to face her computer. “Is he an ex?”
“I made it!” They both looked up. Oceania was literally on top of the archway, one hand braced upon the head of a sculpted lion, a maniacal grin on her face. It was quite the sight.
Harry hadn’t been out to enough pubs with people to know if this was customary behaviour or not. Knowing Luna, it was more likely that she just liked the olives.
“Hello,” said Draco, finally, but he said it like a whisper, like a spoonful of sugar. He smiled again at Harry, and it was so sad and so soft, and all of Harry’s muscles ached like strings being plucked. Draco began to shift off his clothes. He was coming closer, and he was so pale, and there was so much of his skin. Harry couldn’t breathe breathe breathe –
He put the pyjamas on. The top was bit tight on him, and the trousers were too long. He stared at himself in the mirror for a few minutes, and tried very hard not to be overwhelmed.
Harry straightens up and kisses her deeper, her tongue rubbing the back of Draco’s throat, pushing Draco’s shirt off her shoulders, and then she unclips Draco’s bra and Draco begins to cry again.
He wanted to go to that place he and Draco had gone to the other day. But he didn’t know where it was, and he didn’t know how to find his way.
Harry looked up and raised an eyebrow at him. Malfoy’s eyes were doing that smirking thing. They seemed to always be doing that around Harry lately.
Ron shrugged. Hermione looked between them, a little tense. “Alright,” he said. “It’s great of you to like, forgive them and all that. But like, no one would blame you if you didn’t. You don’t really owe them it.”
Harry understood, and felt it in himself only. It was enough, to know his own pain. It was enough. If you knew it in yourself, you knew it in the world.
“Really?” said Draco. His cheeks were pink. He looked exceptionally pleased, although for the life of him Harry couldn’t understand why.
“Thanks,” said Oceania, and then nodded at him, “You should put that away. Normally Draco does it, but he’s annoyed with you.”
Draco was quiet for a moment. “No,” he said, eventually. Then – “Aren’t you ever terrified of yourself, Harry Potter?”
The difference was this time the fire was already lit when they got there. Hayden, Charlie, and Tom were all sitting there, sprawled across the logs and clearly merry. Someone from somewhere had gotten quilted pillows, and marshmallows.
“You use the word cleaning rather boldly.” Draco’s nose was all wrinkled, like a rabbit that had eaten some not so great grass.
“I would have thought you, of all people, would have figured that out,” he continued in that same low voice. His gaze was fond, Draco realised. He felt it wrap around him like perfume.
Hayden nodded again, the edge of their mouth curving up. There was something appreciative about their gaze. “I did.” And then, “I like your shirt.”
“I don’t think Harry means to buy one, Ron,” said Hermione, her eyebrows pushing together, “At least I don’t think so – You don’t, do you Harry?”
Draco was already looking at him. His lashes fluttered, and then he leaned in, and was right there. His mouth captured Harry’s.
Tom considered the question. Outside, the birds were calling to each other, their high-pitched songs darting through the open space.
“It doesn’t mean anything,” he rushed out, and then shoved his hands deep into his pockets. “I, uh – should it mean something?”
He looked at Jane. In the reflection of her big black eyes, he could see himself. He had been running for so long, just to stay afloat, but at some point, you had to stop and face it.
It almost a surprise then, when Harry went inside, that the rest of the house was not also blue. But, he supposed, colour schemes demanded a certain rigidity of character, and this was Luna Lovegood, whom no one in their right or wrong mind would describe as rigid.
Harry grinned, folding his hands back over his head. He threw his feet up over the arm rest of the sofa. “Mmm,” he agreed. “I mean, there’s nothing that gets it going like flower leggings.”
“Dunno.” Harry’s hips were a heroic force. “Guess I’m just a light in the dark.” The words were offhand but Draco wasn’t quite so far gone that he missed the reference. He closed his eyes.
He suddenly realised he had been quiet for too long. He was here to help Malfoy. Hastily, he tried to remember his own process when meditating.
He went back to the hotel. He slept. He focused on the actions, and nothing else. It was easier that way, to keep going.
“No,” Harry answered truthfully. Then he caught himself. “I think it might’ve been though, if I’d sat down and thought about it.”
When he got home, Harry did a yoga workout for an hour and then went for a run. By the time he was done he was just about ready to pass out. But still he dreamt.
Harry waited. Malfoy glanced back to him, and his gaze softened. “It was good,” he said quietly. “Thank you.”
“No, I’m not –” Draco gritted his teeth and looked away. Then he bent down and started rolling again. When he spoke again, he sounded tired. “I’m not angry with you, Harry.”
“You can pick me up,” Draco says suddenly, voice hoarse. She clears it, and straightens her back even more. “At seven, on Wednesday evening, if you’d like. And not to take me to just anywhere, thank you very much – I have standards, as you know, and –“
The second he was in positon he was shuffled so that a large arm was squishing him against the other two. His forehead was indented in Charlie’s neck and Oceania’s face was very close. He thought one of her legs might be on top of his.
Everything seemed to be brown, white, or grey. There was a lot of wood, and in the corner a modest bookshelf. A few paintings were stuck on the walls.
He had still to cook dinner. Too often, he forgot, and ended up just having toast. Today he made himself get up and make spaghetti. He’d never cooked when he’d still been using magic, so didn’t really notice the extra work.
Harry opened his eyes. He didn’t remember making the decision to close them. The mountain they were closest to was cut more profoundly that Harry thought any statue could look.
But it was different, now he’d had the dream. The abstract, loose concept of sleeping with Draco Malfoy suddenly had a reference point that was all too vivid. Harry thought about how soft it had been, about his skin and the roses and the brash surprise of the easy familiarity with which Draco had maneuvered him, had undressed, had taken action. He thought about Draco’s quick witted smile and the line between his brows when he acted all spoilt and the way his mouth curved when he’d just finished swearing. And the sudden rush of arousal was so rich that it was a like a film over his eyes, like a fog that had encompassed his body. He inhaled quickly.
“You should see yourself,” says Harry. “You should see yourself when you’re like this.” She pushes in, hard, and Malfoy yelps, eyes snapping open as her legs wrap around Harry’s waist.
Harry went and got changed in the bathroom. The blue material turned out to be a set of pyjamas. It was surprisingly plain, with nothing more extravagant than tiny daffodils printed neatly across it, small enough to be subtle. Harry had expected something more ridiculous. He glanced at the locked door, and then without letting himself acknowledge the action, pressed the material against his face. It was soft. It smelt very human. Like him.
He had made his way down and was now leaning against the doorframe. He didn’t dare take off his own robes.
The phrase echoed through his head for the rest of the day, between coffee breaks and Bolson cussing him out and the weekly power cut. He thought about it as stood at the printer, his burger image only half-printed out. Around him was the familiar roar of complaining as the entirety of the office lost whatever article they’d been working on.
Malfoy looked away, eyes scanning the room like he was looking for an emergency exit. His blush disappeared beneath the pussy bow, skin trading in for silk. Harry wanted to pull it lose.
He didn’t know why he had done this. He could have kept quiet about it, and not gone around telling people about letters and feelings and real things, strange things,
infused moon fragments, and they sent halos rippling down over Malfoy’s marmoreal forehead. Harry wanted to dip his fingers in it.
“I didn’t say you weren’t capable of love,” said Harry. He was leaning back from Malfoy’s sharp gaze.
“He’s got all these layers,” said Oceania. “Except you’re not quite sure where which one ends and the other begins.”
He looked up, and he was right, see, because there it was, bright and full and heavy, almost bursting against its pearly skin, thought Draco – just like him. Something was inside, that could not be contained, and the truth was: sometimes he was strong, but mostly he was weak.
“Wow,” said Oceania. “I never knew you had such a lovely figure, Harry. You should show if off more.”
“The Mayo-Masters keep raising income tax,” Harry told him solemnly. “It’s tearing Condiment-ville apart.”
“Sure you are.” Delia spun back to face her computer, bored now. “You’re the most average man I’ve ever met. You’re, like, a caricature of normality. No offense.”
Oh, Lord. At least, Draco supposed dully, he had given him time to put down his coffee. It was more than he could have suspected.
“Whiskey,” growled Pansy, at the same time Luna said, “But you’ll miss out on the interesting dynamic.” Blaise raised a brow, but stood up anyway.
Then, at the bottom of the path, Draco stopped. Harry turned to look at him. He was smirking, and Harry’s gaze was hopelessly drawn to the dainty curl of the side of his lips.
Harry grumbled and let go of the tree. It wasn’t easy. He had liked the way it had supported all of his weight without berating him for getting drunk the night before a religious festival.
Harry stared at him. He blinked hard, several times. “I’m not getting drinks with you,” he managed after several moments, successfully keeping most of the astoundment out of his voice.
All that skin was so pale. Harry looked, and then looked away when Malfoy bent over to reach for the mesh. Oceania met his eyes and wriggled her brows.
The camp Harry was going to was near a small village called Tengboche, which was located in the Khumbu region of north-eastern Nepal. Harry didn’t really know where Nepal was. If he was being honest, he wasn’t entirely sure where the Himalayas were either. But, he reasoned to himself, it wasn’t like he was going all the way over there for a lesson in geography.
“Damn right,” said Malfoy. He turned to the girl behind the counter and ordered a round of shots, then turned back and pointed at Charlie. “Charlie, you are not leaving just yet.”
Malfoy bent over and picked it up. The sunlight dripped down his calve muscle. Then he straightened back up, and the letter was in between his white fingers.
Draco was laughing. Once he’d stopped he straightened back up and started at Harry, wide-eyed, where he was perched up on top of Jane’s back.
“Ah,” said Oceania, and turned to her drawer only to take out another mesh shirt. This one was neon purple.
The monk’s expression melted into fondness. Harry didn’t blame him as he watched him roll his eyes and pat her dismissively on the arm. She grinned and made her way over to them.
But sometimes one just needed to be quiet. Draco could get that. He blinked back at her, and then started to stand up and stretch.
Harry didn’t scream. He just said, “Draco.” Felt the feathery weight of the word balance on his tongue, float out into the air. He took a step forward too. And then he was under. There was a brief, sharp, pitching fear that for a moment consumed every thought, but this wasn’t the real loch, this wasn’t the same one.
Draco glanced at his like he’d forgotten about it. He knocked it back like a shot, barely tasting it. Harry laughed.
Draco huffs a laugh, and then bites down on her lips. “It’s a cottage.” she says, and opens the door wider. “Come in.”
Harry opened his eyes, and they were green enough to be their own kingdom. “Brilliant,” he said, and smiled as if it were the easiest thing.
“So glad to have your approval,” sneered Pansy. “I’ll let my therapist know that we can continue after all, since Harry Potter’s given me the thumbs up.”
Pansy put her hands on her hips. Besides her, Blaise was smirking and somehow leaning in mid-air, an already lit cigar in his right hand.
“You and your writing,” Malfoy said fondly, and then stood up. The (pink) table rocked a bit. “Harry. Charlie. Let’s go.”
“Effugium,” said Oceania, then licked the edge of the paper and sealed it, handing the final product to Harry. It was too light in his palm. “You’ve never had it?”
Malfoy breathes heavily as she stares at the other woman, at her simple grey vest and exposed shoulders and not-quite-so-thin lips, and then Potter smiles and takes her hand and says:
Harry did. He tried to focus on that, and think of nothing else, but he couldn’t help being aware still of the temple around him, of Tom and Malfoy sitting next to him, of the vulnerability of his closed eyes. And there was more, he found, rushing to the surface now he wasn’t distracted, things like Jane as she snarled and bit at him, things like the letter waiting for him in his hotel room, things like Hayden and Oceanias’ bodies piled over each other on the bed, things like the cold dampness of Draco Malfoy’s back, turned away in the loch, things like the huge wide stretch of the mountains before him, before him, before him, and there was only ever him there –
He thought of flowers. Soft, furtive petals, veiny and pale as they allowed themselves to unwrap like presents. It was a natural process, profound without intention.
The mat selection was not as great as he had hoped, which was stupid thing to hope for he now realised, as there was only so much variety to be had with mats. He was just thinking of the mat room in Gay Dragon Village. Shaking his head, he stepped forward and began to gingerly inspect the nearest mat.
Harry saw Draco nod in his peripheral vision. He was looking outside the window, towards the mountains and forests, thinking about the shape of her turquoise form flitting through all of it, and how it must, for now, feel a lot like escaping.
). Eventually resorting to shameful self-help books which definitely made things worse. And then – and he would take this to his grave –
A visitor lured Luna away after that, asking questions about a tapestry woven into a branch on the other side of the room. Harry gave Malfoy a look.
Draco moves past Potter to the sink and fills the pot up with water. Potter doesn’t even notice that she’s not using the kettle.
The walk down from the temple wasn’t long. When he turned the final corner, Jane was sitting down, her turquoise wings folded up under her. When she saw Harry she stopped licking at the corner of one and did the dragon equivalent of raising a brow.
Harry bent forward. The fingers dug, just a little, into his hips, pressing down with emphasis. “From – here,” said Malfoy. “There. See it doesn’t hurt your back, this way.”
Hermione and Ron had been the only ones who ever found out. It was when he cut off all his hair, and they found him six hours later, sitting alone in a circle of his own black hair, that they had finally realised something wasn’t right.
Draco re-appeared in the doorway. He had one set of fingers wrapped around the edge of it; he blinked at Harry.
Harry swallowed. Malfoy’s finger continued to move. It was a strange sensation. He couldn’t remember the last time someone had touched his face.
The door wrenched open. Oceania was standing there, dressed entirely in denim and what Harry guessed was every woman’s dream shade of ochre.
He chucked one of the lubes at her. It missed, knocking over an empty coffee cup and landing securely in one of the dying office plants.
Draco looked very strange. He was staring off into the unlit fire, but it was a little like he wasn’t staring there at all, like he was seeing something else. His finger on his now empty beer bottle twitched, flitting against the curling edge of the unpeeling sticker.
“Cool,” said Tom, which struck Harry as weird for a monk (but what even was weird anymore? Weird stopped existing without a relative point of comparison) and beckoned for Harry to sit down. Harry startled.
“Sure.” Harry let the spoon slow in its circles as the syrup thickened, until it was dragging languidly against the translucent ripples. He turned his back to it so he could lean as well, facing Malfoy. “I didn’t fuck the men on Mount Everest.”
Harry swallowed. The light in the room swelled, pushing at the wallpaper, and then dimmed. He felt abruptly empty.
On the upside, Draco had procured fifteen Starbucks lattes from somewhere, which admittedly broke up the monotony for their taste buds, and probably had some nutrition somewhere. On the downside, Draco had consumed nine of these coffees himself thus far, and it was only three ‘o’clock.
Malfoy didn’t watch Harry approach, but Harry could sense he was waiting. As he got closer he saw that the samplers had erections embroidered into them, above lilac lettering that spelled out:
“Yeah,” said Harry, and cleared his throat. “Yeah, sorry.” The paper was smooth between his fingers.
,” said Draco, and then he scrambled up, sitting back on Harry’s thighs. “Yes, how, how do you want me? Do you want me like this? Do you want me –”
It was like they were growing out of the house, Harry thought. Like they were part of it, as organic a by-product of human existence as a toothbrush, or hair stuck in a comb, or butter in the fridge. They were more than decoration, more than a means of education – more than another past time. It seemed that they were a very staple of life, here in this house, an unquestionable necessity. Harry looked at the books, at the way they were, and thought he understood something about Draco.
“I think,” he said, and then swallowed and glanced at the empty space of the cafeteria. The thought came together and he screwed up his nose. “I think that I might just not be very self-aware.”
“That’s really respectful of you,” said Harry, and Malfoy finally looked up, narrowing his eyes. The eyeliner around them had smeared down his cheeks, and there was a pillow indent pressed against his left cheek. His gaze dropped to the cereal bowl.
On fifth morning, he decided to try adding mediation to the end of his practices. On sixth, Hayden caught him as he was heading back to the hotel.
Harry forced himself to relax his arms at his sides, to step forward. He tried to broaden his shoulders.
Hayden raised a thin brow. “What I say,” they said, and then leaned forward on the counter, mimicking Harry. “He won’t use it.”
