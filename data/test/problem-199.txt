With a smirk he held them up and instead of giving them back, slid them onto his own nose.
“No one,” Draco scowled, sliding the letter into his pocket, promising himself he would write an extra long reply as soon as classes were over. Harry scoffed but didn’t push him to answer and, even if Draco would have told him if he had, he appreciated it.
“I’m not finished yet.”
Draco said nothing for a moment, just continued to stroke Pepper.
Blocking out the wave of inappropriate thoughts that filled Draco’s mind, he averted his eyes and walked over to help Harry look for his glasses. Harry took a step aside, not putting nearly enough space between them. Draco scoffed as he leaned over and plucked Harry’s glasses up from where they sat on top of his book. “Merlin, how blind
In the back of his mind Draco knew he’d let this go too far. He couldn’t be friends with Harry. It would only end in him getting his heart broken. Harry didn’t even want people to know they were
It was weird how easily they could talk to each other and Draco was struck by just how much they had in common. He had shown Harry the Draco constellation, pointing out each star and telling him their names. Harry had listened intently and told him that despite their many astronomy lessons, the only constellation he could remember was the Big Dipper. Draco then listened as he explained how he would look for the Dipper at night when he looked out his window of his aunt and uncle's house, wishing he was back at Hogwarts. When he had asked why he wouldn't want to be with his aunt and uncle, Harry had seemed uncomfortable, so he dropped the subject.
Harry faltered for a second, thinking maybe he was going to be partnering with Pansy or Blaise. That would leave him stuck with the other as he’d abandoned his own friends. In their first practical lesson with her, him, Hermione and Ron had tried to work as a three, but she had told them she wouldn’t allow any special treatment and that he would have to find a partner like the rest of the class. He would usually pair up with Neville, he felt kind of guilty about leaving him on his own now. He could see him looking around for him, wondering why he wasn’t there.
He smirked at me and said, “It is, can I be there when you tell them?”
I knew then that I was the key to his curse, but I wasn’t sure I knew what I was getting myself into.
“No. I just… I wanted us to slowly tell others and not suddenly have the entire world knowing. I can’t be mad at Hermione being happy for us, nor at you for wanting to tell others.”
"You wish, Malfoy." And we kissed again. I felt that with that kiss we were finally getting to a place where we both understood each other. I could not wait to see where it took us next. Maybe we'll have more dates to come. But for now, we enjoyed the feel of the stars around us as we held each other in our arms.
“Draco. Thank you.”
“Why, you were so determined to keep him away, but now…?” I asked confused with him.
“That actually makes you sound like a human being. Have you thought about telling the person you love how you feel?”
“Draco, Harry was telling about going to check on the injured, but said you had something interesting to share with me.”
We were talking about Hogwarts and their wish to teach those who couldn’t be taught due to the war last year, and whether we wanted to return to school. During this talk, which lead to more laughter, Harry just suddenly stopped laughing and spoke with such sorrow. “I have never laughed so much in a summer before. Draco, this has been the best summer of my life. I must admit that if this is what summers will always be like this that it can only get better from here. Jeez, before Hogwarts I never smiled. I had no reason to smile, but thanks to you and others I have learned the importance and value to smiles.”
There will be Lyrics from a Song that is definitely not mine so please listen to the original Hero by Enrique Iglesias. Thank you and enjoy!
Oh, hold me in your arms tonight
This was how I was no longer at a loss, but now had no clue what was going to happen next. I fell asleep wondering what my fate be.
I froze. We had only been officially dating for a month now, it felt to sudden, to fast, but I knew he was serious. I looked at him and the ring that was being presented. On it I could see two different engravings, I couldn’t quite read them in the box, but I had seen this ring before in a picture of the Potter family before they had been killed on the hand of Lilly Potter, Harry’s mother. I was reminded of pureblood traditions that put this type of engagement as one of purest love. I wanted to cry tears of joy, but I kept them in as I had to answer him. I looked into those Emerald green eyes that had always enchanted me. I opened my mouth and spoke from my heart. “Yes, yes, yes!”
“So, who do we start with?”
“Yes. Is it so hard to imagine me in love with someone?”
“It’s been a year?”
He grabbed the other gift an envelope that I had spent hours thinking on. He looked at it slightly confused as he opened it. “Why give me a…” He stopped getting a look at it reading it. He looked up at me shock on his face. “Is this real? You are really willing to tell the whole world about us?”
"Sorry, that was me I always wanted to go on a date with you, so I guess this was what the room decided I needed."
“I planted these after you told me of the tradition of planting flowers here. I thought that something that represented both of us would be great for the flower that represents our love. Draco, so long as we love each other these flowers will bloom forever. Do you like your present?”
“It’s a deal.”
When I got there, I saw Harry talking with Hermione. “Good morning, Hermione, good morning Harry.”
I saw him hand the book to Hermione a week later. I was jealous that I heard him call her by her first name, and I briefly thought it was her that he liked. But, his answer to why he calls her by name floored me. I managed to answer, and ask about his loved one. I managed to convince him to tell me what it was like to fall in love. I will never forget what he said. “Hah… It was shocking once I realized I loved them. At first, I was jealous of what they had with friends then as I got older, I kept looking at them wondering when I could be the one to make them smile, to be the one who would make them want to try harder. I thought that it was a faze, something I would grow out of, but I never stopped hoping that I’d make them smile. I felt like I was going to die when I heard that my parents sided with Voldemort because I knew that meant that I would one to hurt them the most. Then I knew no matter what would happen I couldn’t tell them, because they live in the light and I- I am stuck in the dark. They mean the world to me, and as much as I want to tell them, I am not worthy of anything they give me.”
I yawned. Harry giggled. “We should get some sleep I’ll walk you to your room.” So, he did. It was slow and purposeful, but we eventually made it to my door. I gave him a quick kiss. He smiled and walked away. I was able to sleep peacefully that night.
“Wow that means…”
I awoke to the sight of the same people who were in the dungeon surrounding me on a bed in a place I didn’t recognize. I was no longer chained, but I had no idea what had came to be after I had fainted in front of the Boy who lived. I looked around at faces of people I pretended to hate during my school years and moved to sit up, but someone stopped me.
Or would you laugh? Oh, please tell me this
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero baby
“You only have to tell me once then I won’t ever ask again, I promise.”
Ron spoke up next. “Harry, we are wizards and though it is hard for wizards to have children, Draco is a Veela and Veela are able to have children no matter their gender.”
Then reality set in. Hermione and Ron showed up, but I let him know that he wasn’t getting away from my feelings without answering them. Shortly after, Ron got weird and left us by ourselves. We needed to get the Sword of Gryffindor, it was our best chance to destroy the creepy thing, Draco didn’t like the idea Hermione and I had, but it would work. We were left alone when she went to get more water, and I was finally able to talk with him. Well, more like argue with him, I tried to get it out of him but he left me hanging. Then I saw him fall, hard, I ran to catch him tears streaming down my face, when I did, I carried him gently to his bed and messed with his hair. I realized then that the curse was really killing him, and I wanted to die right then, before death took my heart.
“Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Potter my name is Draco Malfoy. You don’t know me but your son does. He has saved me from certain death like he saved so many others, like you saved him. He is so kind and brave, but so very worry some. We came here with him to help but I don’t think he thought of a better way of finding the other Horcruxes. This is why he has to be safer I mean he would probably risk his life to save everyone else.” I was quiet as I realized that I wasn’t wrong. I heard Hermione scream and ran to it, but stopped to say one last thing to the graves. “I don’t want to tell him but I love him more than I have ever loved anyone before and you need to keep him safe for my sake because I promised to tell him when this is all over and trust me I want to.”
“Harry, we are in no rush for those things. No ones pushing us to be apart yes, but if we hurry things people will think bad things about us. Plus, I insisted so that we could finish school, so that any future we dreamed of would be easier to obtain. Harry, we can have those things next year… maybe.” I said this blushing. “It’s not as if we will never have this.” I mumbled.
"Shut up." I kissed him then. I finally got to kiss him, and hold him, and love him without him thinking he'd lose me. He broke the kiss. "So, I am really your mate?"
Ron blushed. “Well after Bill married Fleur, her cousins surrounded me, and after seeing that she pulled me aside and told me that all Veela regardless of gender, or if the are full-blooded or not, she told me that should I try messing with one of her cousins with those intentions that I at least protect all involved. I didn’t want to remember that ever again, but when he said what he did, I remembered.”
“Very well, Draco, Harry.”
“Well, you have far more people to tell then I and my side won’t threaten to kill you if you hurt me.”
Then I waited, and waited, …and waited, until I was physically worried that something might’ve happened to them. I didn’t know why I was there to begin with but I knew I had to be there for some reason. The pull that I felt every time I was near Harry had only gotten stronger now that I was alone, and I had a million urges to speak how I felt aloud. I had to stop myself from it, but I couldn’t quite stop myself from mouthing the words ‘I love you’ every five minutes or so. It had started five minutes after Harry had left my sight, which had been over an hour ago. I was waiting for the three of them to get back, so I cleaned the tent … again when finally, I heard the pop of apparition. I ran to see who it was that had come back.
Weasley talked too. “If it’s the curse I think it is then, Harry, he’s lucky to be alive.”
I will stand by you forever
He leapt out of his seat and jumped into mine hugging me close to him. “Thank you.”
“Then why not save us both the trouble and just tell me now.”
I will stand by you forever
I followed her out of my room. We walked in silence through the hollow house, the sound of our shoes echoing as we make our way to the garden. We made it to the edge of the garden where we planned to start the wedding march. Mother and I walked toward Harry. It took everything in me not to run to him, but I was determined not to embarrass myself. I made it to the altar where he was standing. I wasn’t paying attention to anything that wasn’t Harry, so when we were to read vows his voice was the clearest thing I had ever heard.
It had been a week since our stargazing date, and I was finally content in being Harry’s mate. We had been on many dates like our stargazing one, and it was during a quiet picnic, in the Room of Requirement, that he reminded me of the outside world. “You know our dates will eventually have to be outside of this room, right?”
“Harry that’s not going to happen,” I put my hand on his face to make him focus on me when I continued, “I will always be by your side no matter what.”
“For everyone’s safety I can’t tell you, but I can tell you that no one should be able to find you. We aren’t sure we should trust you Malfoy, but we are willing to help you heal at least.”
“Can you tell me what it was like finding someone you love?”
We had to keep looking for these death devices that could kill the Bald menace once and for all. Draco didn’t want to impede us, or shock anybody with his return so, he watched the camp. When we finished getting the stupid neckless that had a piece of ye’old Baldy in it, I went ahead of Hermione and Ron to give them time to cover our trail. I saw him, and felt like blushing at the warmth I was feeling. Even though he was cold, I felt like I had a warm drink bubbling in my belly, even though the tea wasn’t done. I teased him for not saying how he feels, and he pointed out that yet again, my mission was more important than his love life.
I decided to speak up. “Longbottom… I know you won’t believe me, but… I was with Harry, Ron, and Hermione just before I fainted. Ron had left the three of us before we went to Godric’ s Hallow and the two of them had to leave quickly and left me behind. If you don’t believe me stored in my wand are memories of the time, I spent with them. You are free to look at them. I am going to go to the restroom now.”
“I have everything I could ask for right here in your arms. I don’t really want anything for Christmas. What about you, anything you want for Christmas?”
I felt this since of wholeness till I heard a sharp gasp. I turned around and saw…
“Draco, I am positive that it won’t matter. The curse is working right now to convince you to tell them until you can no longer live. You should tell them before you are dead.”
“Are you mad?”
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
“What do you want me to do?”
She froze. Coughed and then started talking.
How could I not? I had to stop and think of what the best plan of action could be. After all I was a Slytherin and Slytherins think ahead.
Reluctantly I said, “Fine, but I decide when and who we tell it to. Is this all right?”
“Yes.”
It was finally the start of summer and Harry and I finally made it to my mothers’ house with joy apparent in our faces. We made it to the door where my mother had already opened it for our arrival. “Draco, my son, how are you? I see you brought Mr. Potter to my lovely home.”
Oh, I just hold you
That shook me into my senses. “What? Why?”
Granger asked a question. “What curse is that?”
She looked at me with tears in her eyes before she spoke again. “I shouldn’t have left your side, I should have brought you with me, but your father insisted and thus you stayed at home and were tortured, and the curse started. I am so sorry for leaving you behind my little sunshine.”
We had picked out everything for the wedding and were simply waiting for the day to arrive. Harry and I decided to do things for ourselves. Harry chose to find our song, I picked the rings, He picked my garter (which I wanted for tradition sake), I picked his suit, he picked mine, and we kept doing that till we pretty much were done but there were still the vows. We wanted to have our own, but I wanted to read them to make sure we didn’t overlap and Harry refused to write them down always saying he had them memorized. I had written mine down and let Harry read them; he had smiled and said, “These are great Draco, but I was hoping you’d let me go first if that’s alright?” I nodded but wondered if he’d ever let me see them.
“You didn’t know?”
“That means, I really was the person you had to tell. Are you going to leave me now?” I could smell his sadness that cloaked that wonderful smell of his. Apart of me wanted to kiss him into silence then tell him I was never going to leave him, but I knew I shouldn’t do that to him. “Calm down Harry, I will be fine. I can’t even move right now, so how can I leave you?”
“Harry, he was caged in his own family’s dungeon, for who knows how long, we should be better than those we fight against and heal all wounded people regardless of their past.”
"Well I kinda h-have to go do-um-something, uh, now so, can it wait?"
She hugged me after I finished speaking and left me to what I was doing. As I finished Harry entered the room and watched me for a while before he spoke. “You call Hermione by her first name, but Ron and I get called by our last names. Why is that?”
And before I could answer my tiredness and wounds caught up to me and I fainted before I could even think of what to say to my first crush Harry Potter.
The next morning started early. I had to get dressed and ready and that alone took me two hours. There was only one hour left till I was going to see Harry once again. I was feeling anxious, I couldn’t wait to see him. My mother came to me and looked me in the eyes. “Now remember Draco, the only person who matters today is you. No one can take this from you. Now lets start walking to the Garden we’ll get there just in time for your entrance.”
It did not matter to me, and it was short lived before the battle started up again. Then after the ruckus, there was only silence as I waited for Harry to come in and save the world, my world.
“Hmmm…” Harry seemed to think about it. He smiled before he gave his answer. “Well, unfortunately the only present I wanted this year was to marry you, and you insisted on waiting a year.” He laughed at his small joke as I glared at him. “Honestly, Draco there really isn’t anything I want. Though I would appreciate something to let others know I’m taken. I get a lot of random people asking me out and some of them don’t believe me when I say I am taken so maybe something to ward people away from me?”
"I promise you I am actually curious now."
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?
Harry spoke then. “Why won’t you?”
“Yes. I was already a Veela dealing with the separation and the increase of magics around me plus hearing his call for you prepared me for death. I thought that I would have lost you when he called for you I was waiting for the moment when my body would start begging for death. I sat there waiting but it never came. I started to have the smallest amount of hope for my life and for yours. Seeing you lying in Hagrid’s arm as if you were dead nearly killed me. I had to wait and see though before I reacted to the need to violently kill Voldemort and die at the same time. It took everything in me to not launch myself at him and kill him. If you had truly died that day I wouldn’t have cared.”
I knew then that my day was going to be a long one, as I sat in the library waiting for him to come and see me. When I did, I didn’t bother trying to tell him then. The day was rather long, but dinner was when it all started.
“And if they stop loving each other?”
“Ron and Hermione are covering our tracks they won’t be here for a while. Besides Ron wanted time alone to tell Hermione how he feels about her. He’s got the guts to tell the one he loves that he loves her. Unlike someone I know.”
At that point, I wished it was me he was talking about. I wanted it to be me who made him feel like that. I wanted to be the one who brought those sapphire eyes to life, that put the smile on his face, that made him glow with happiness at just the thought of them, and that was killing me. I hadn’t realized that I hadn’t answered him, so I called him by name and told him what would happen should anyone say those words to me. We left Black Manor shortly after. I hoped that one day he would tell me who it was he loved.
I smiled at him. “How else do you think I managed to hide it for so long? I wrote it to release all the emotions I felt for you and then it was great that I did it. I could share with my children and grandchildren just how much I loved you before I was a Veela. You know you could write how you felt about it too, and when it’s time we can both share how we felt. Plus, it might make you feel better, and you might be able to finally write those vows of yours.”
Would you cry if you saw me crying?
“The curses of each pureblood family and what they do.”
I smirked as I spoke. “Ah but, you see Potter, I’m not yours yet so… Maybe next year.” We laughed at the stupid joke before deciding we needed to go to sleep. Harry refused to let me go before giving me one last kiss and whispering. “Maybe next year, taking you to bed will mean something else.”
“I can’t force THEM to stay out of danger, so at the very least I will stay safe for their sakes.”
“In time yes, but if I say it for all we know my mate could be in league with Voldemort and I’d be forced to join his side.”
When we entered the room and he sat me in a chair that magically appeared behind me. “Draco turned into a Veela. Hermione, we need to keep him from the battle.”
“Or?”
I was in the dark with no where to go. I hadn’t realized that I feared anything anymore, but I was wrong. In the dark, every turn had visions of death, which wouldn’t normally scare me except, they were all of Harry dying in front of me. I was terrified. The pain of breathing got worse, it got colder, and colors had all been drained from everything. I sat there wondering if everything was just a dream, that I hadn’t been saved, that I wasn’t a Veela, that Harry didn’t love me. With every thought it got darker and colder, and breathing was almost impossible.
Shortly after we built the Great Hall people no longer sat in the sanctioned seats of their house but sat with friends. That night I sat with Harry and all his friends at the old Gryffindor table. He was telling Hermione about the funeral. I didn’t want to listen but couldn’t help it when he got to the part where he discussed his conversation with a mother who was there. “She was glad that the future generation of wizards would have me and my family to lead them. She said that she couldn’t wait to hear about the next Potters coming in through Hogwarts.” He looked sad as he spoke the next part. “I couldn’t bear to tell her I won’t have any children.”
Harry may have talked a little more than he had intended. When he suggested the quidditch match, that was all he expected to happen, the talking was just an unexpected bonus. And it was nice. He never would have thought he’d enjoy just talking to Malfoy so much. He feels a little out of his depth if he’s honest. He only wanted to make things less awkward between them, but he seems to have gotten carried away.
“They will?” Harry hadn’t thought about that. Maybe if he wound him up enough, he could get Malfoy to hex him and he’d have the room to himself.
“Oh. Sorry. I didn’t think I was that tired,” he muttered to himself.
"Why do you have a snitch?"
He was
There are some things in the previous chapters that I really want to change but I’m going to wait till the end then edit the whole thing
“So you can sit in your room and feel sorry for yourself?” Blaise asked, raising his eyebrows.
“You know he has nightmares, Ron. He doesn’t get much sleep.”
“Um…” he searched for an excuse not to but gave up when he realised he was fighting a losing battle. And he wanted to spend more time with Harry anyway, even if he hated that he did. “Okay.”
This seemed to be a satisfactory middle ground and they were all able to focus back on their work. The silence lasted a few minutes until Ron once again said something that Hermione took offence to. Then they started arguing again in hushed voices. Harry wasn’t sure what it was about, he was hardly paying attention. He had been distracted just a few seconds before when Malfoy had walked through the door.
“Hey Draco?” There it was again. Harry saying his name, sending a thrill through Draco’s heart in a way only he could. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to it. It felt like a privilege he had to hold on to and hope to never loose.
“Maybe you shouldn’t stay up all night playing quidditch,” Draco said just as quietly. He was irrationally unsure whether he was allowed to mention the night before. He was still waiting for Harry to get bored and stop talking to him. It felt easier to give him the option to back out if he wanted to, to pretend this last month never happened and go back to hating each other. But now Draco knew how it could be, he desperately didn’t want that to happen. He wanted Harry to seek him out when he thought he didn’t want to be found. It was becoming apparent he always wanted Harry to find him. He wanted Harry to smile at him the way he did last night, with his eyes crinkled around the edges and his nose scrunched up in the most adorable way.
“Do you always talk so posh?” Harry said suddenly side-tracked.
“Don’t you have something better to do?”
Malfoy stopped suddenly, spinning around to face Harry and bringing a hand up as if he was going to grab the front of his robes. Instead he let it hang in the air between them. “Just leave me alone.” His watery red rimmed eyes met Harry’s for a brief moment and his breath caught in his throat. He was startled by the intensity of his gaze, Harry could see all the raw emotion he had clearly been bottling up and trying so hard to keep concealed. And then Malfoy schooled his features until the only emotion left was anger. He turned away and continued his ascent up the stairs. Getting a rise out of Malfoy wasn’t as satisfying as he thought it would be. He just felt guilty.
"What are they for?" he asked as Potter dug through his trunk until he pulled out a bundle of silky material and a worn piece of parchment. Instead of answering he unfolded the bundle so Draco could see it was a cloak, then he wrapped it around his shoulders, his body seemingly vanishing. "Ah, of course you have an invisibility cloak. What about that ancient piece of parchment?"
“It’s not my fault you have such low standards Potter.”
"Really? Aren't you playing this year?" he asked, confused. Quidditch practice had already started but of course he shouldn't expect Potter to notice if he was attending practices or not. He had started getting up even earlier than Draco to practice with the Gryffindor team, he would come back muddy and smelling of sweat but with a beaming smile on his face. Sometimes he'd tell Draco about the stupid things his teammates had done-usually Ron-which Draco would listen to with a fake bored expression. "Come on, that's funny" Harry had said once, when Draco hadn't laughed at his enthusiastic retelling of how Ron had face-planted while trying to catch a quaffle. "Gryffindor's are all morons" Draco had replied.
It was with that in mind, that Harry stepped out into the hallway. “Let him go,” he said, drawing the attention of both boys. He pulled out his wand and pointed it at the Hufflepuff, who's eyes widened. He seemed surprised anyone would bother defending Malfoy.
“Of course. I remember all my house elves.” This was true, out of everyone in his family Draco was the one who treated the elves the best. Though he didn’t see this as an act of kindness but rather the result of disinterest. Having grown up with house elves, he hardly noticed their presents. But unlike his father he had never harmed them and would refuse to punish them when they made a mistake. He had never enjoyed violence.
He snatched the bundle of robes from Potter and despaired at the wrinkled material. He could see Potter grinning at him from the corner of his eye, which he chose to ignore for the sake of his own sanity. He walked over to one of the nearby benches and started to change.
“Harry have you painted your nails?” a voice said to his right when he finally sat down at the Gryffindor table for lunch. He turned to see a head of long ginger hair and Ginny smiling at him. Across the table, opposite Ginny, sat Luna. The two girls had been spending a lot of time together since the start of the year, enough that no one questioned why Luna wasn’t sitting at the Ravenclaw table. They had been lucky enough to be put in a room together and were now inseparable.
"Maybe they do now," he sounded sceptical. He had started fiddling with a long bit of grass. "My aunt and uncle didn't like me much."
Draco spent the rest of the lesson discreetly watching the trio of friends bickering over how best to make the potion, while pretending to be finishing up with his own. Slughorn had ignored his raised hand for about five minutes and in the end, Draco gave up trying to get his attention.
“Then I guess I’ll have to trust you then. You are always right after all.”
Potter only started to stir another hour and a half later. He was relieved. He’d started to think he might have to wake him up himself. He had already missed breakfast, but Draco had decided that wasn’t important enough to disturb him. He placed the cat back onto the floor, who seemed to be offended that she was so abruptly awoken from her nap, then headed out the door to class.
“Finally! What took you so long? We were starting to think you'd changed your mind,” Ron said when Hermione stopped and slid open the door to their compartment.
“Go away,” he said into the pillow, voice heavy with sleep.
“Because she likes me better,” he said smugly. As if to agree, Pepper started purring. Draco almost laughed when he looked up at Potter’s face, he looked betrayed.
“I am not and I don’t want to hear any complaining, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said sternly. “I have made my decision and it is not going to change.”
Harry didn’t give up easily, and he didn’t think the lesson had gone that badly. Him and Malfoy hadn’t even really argued, like he had expected, and even when they had it was almost pleasant compared to their usual interactions. So, rather than being put off by Malfoy’s unwillingness to be friendly, he decided to persist.
Harry shrugged.
He looked up at Draco with wide hopeful eyes and Draco was forced to reconsider the answer he was about to give.
"It's a map."
He turned to look at him then. He had always been infuriatingly handsome. It wasn't fair. It would be so much easier to hate him if he wasn't so goddamn attractive. With his scruffy black hair that was practically begging Draco to run his hands through it, either to smooth it out or mess it up more. He wasn't fussy. His brown skin was perfect and smooth, not a spot in sight, the only imperfection being the scar on his forehead. And even that was to be admired, though Harry had a habit of hiding it under his hair, as if that would stop people recognising him. His eyes were so green it almost looked unnatural. Draco had wondered on more than one occasion what he would look like in Slytherin robes. His eyes found themselves drifting down to his lips, they were slightly parted and so very tempting. He'd never looked at him up close for this long before.
He set his trunk down against the end of his bed before flopping down on the mattress. Instead of the usual Gryffindor red sheets, the ones on the bed were plain black. Pepper climbed up beside him, watching expectantly, Harry scratched her ear and she purred quietly.
"Yes."
Standing in the middle of the new 8th year common room, Harry gaped up at Professor McGonagall. “You have to be joking.”
“No, they’re not.” They were dark green.
"Are you awake?"
Draco scoffed. “You’d be surprised” Draco said, in a tone that suggested he was talking about something specific that Harry didn’t know about. “I’m sitting here with you, aren’t I?”
Anyway I hope you liked this chapter! It's my favourite so far. (By the way I really appreciated constructive criticism, I know my writing isn’t the best sometimes)
"We won't." His certainty both reassured Draco and pissed him off.
“Wasn’t complaining,” he mumbled, pouring a spoonful of baked beans onto his plate.
“Why not?” She sounded disappointed and Draco felt slightly guilty. He didn’t mean to push his friends away but he felt so disconnected from them. He enjoyed their company but he preferred being alone. When he was with them, he would feel fine and then suddenly he would want nothing more than to be alone. But the most frustrating thing was that once he was alone he couldn’t help but feel lonely. It made no sense and it made him angry with himself.
Draco perked up. “I can do the other one.”
After a moment he gave in, making sure to grumble and sigh just the right amount so Potter knew just how much he didn't want to be spending time with him. Potter just grinned. He unhooked his Slytherin jumper from his wardrobe-he took pride in his appearance, unlike Potter who walked around unashamedly in permanently wrinkled clothes-and pulled it on over his silk pyjamas. There was no point in getting dressed, there wouldn't be anyone walking around at this hour.
Draco threw out an arm, removing the hand that was gripping his shoulder, shaking him. “Let me go!” he said through a whimper, panic seeping through his voice in his disorientation. He kicked out, pushing himself back against the headboard of his bed and away from the person standing over him. With his heart still beating rapidly, his eyes moved frantically around the room, looking for the dark figure but finding only Harry with his hands up and a guilty look on his face.
“No. Sod off I’ll start again,” he pushed Malfoy’s hands away before he could get hold of the knife and put more fluxweed onto the chopping board. Surprisingly, Malfoy gave in straight away, going back to stirring the cauldron.
She turned to look at him, her perfectly shaped eyebrows raised and a knowing smirk on her face. Pansy lived to tease Draco. She hadn’t had the chance to these last few months, both out of pity and lack of things to tease him about.
“Well that’s not surprising when he’s being forced to share a room with Malfoy,” Ron said his name with disgust, like he couldn’t believe his friend was being put through something so terrible. Hermione rolled her eyes. “He’s probably terrified for his life. But that doesn’t explain the other stuff.”
“Morning,” he said, pushing thoughts of love deep down, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to function. He shouldn’t feel nervous about this. It was a perfectly normal thing for friends to do, and that was that they were now. Friends slept in the same bed all the time, he was being ridiculous, as usual.
Everyone else had gone to their rooms to unpack, leaving only Harry, holding Pepper, Malfoy and McGonagall standing in the middle of the common room. Hermione had been right, about half of their year had returned, the amount of Gryffindors making up for the lack of Slytherins. Malfoy, Pansy and Blaise were the only Slytherins to come back. They had stood awkwardly at the back of the group as McGonagall read off the names of who would be sharing a room with who. Every student was sharing a room with someone form a different house. McGonagall said they had decided the house system caused too much rivalry between students. New students were still being sorted into houses but they were separated by year for their dormitories and common rooms. The eighth year common room was very similar to the old Gryffindor one but with neutral colours. It was a large circular room with a few archways that led to the dorm rooms and there was a huge fireplace with lots of sofas circled around it.
The rest of the lesson went by uneventfully and soon enough they had a vial full of glittery dark purple liquid. Harry was proud of how perfect it was. Except with the help of Snape’s potions book, he had never been able to complete a potion as accurately as this one. Perhaps being Malfoy’s partner had more benefits that he initially thought. They made a good team. When Slughorn reached their table, last since it was the furthest from his desk, he praised the potion and exclaimed that it was the best one he had seen so far. Harry grinned at Malfoy and received a scowl in response.
“He doesn’t deserve to be here,” he argued weakly, an undertone of sadness beneath his anger. Harry wasn’t sure what exactly he meant by ‘here’ but he ignored him anyway.
Draco woke up the next morning to the sound of birds chirping and for a few blissful seconds his mind was completely blank but for the feeling of the soft covers surrounding his body and the warmth of sunlight on his face. He squinted against the bright light and blinked his eyes open. He knew he should have shut that curtain. It would have saved him the torture of seeing Harry’s adorable bedhead and Pepper sprawled out next to his chest, hidden under his arm. Draco almost jumped at the sight of another person in his bed but relaxed when the memories of the night before came flooding back. A blush had darkened his cheeks before he could stop it. This was why he put up silencing charms around his bed every night. To stop this exact thing from happening. He must have forgotten to cast them, been too distracted. He and Harry had been talking. He didn’t even remember going to sleep.
“Then where-” Draco said with exasperation before Harry cut him off.
“Do you have to?”
“Alright,” Malfoy agreed, his refusal to speak to Harry apparently winning against his want to disagree with him on principle.
“No!” Hermione always got angry when they suggested she should do their work for them.
He wondered if maybe Malfoy had said something to cause this reaction. But he had been keeping to himself since the start of term, why would he start causing trouble now? Besides, Harry had seen the way the other students treated him, and that was with other people around. He wouldn’t be surprised if this boy had followed Malfoy until he was alone.
“Can’t you just do it for me?” Ron suggested, giving her a hopeful look through a gap in his fingers.
In the end he decided, or was forced really, to keep her. He had to admit she was good company. It got kind of lonely living in Grimmauld Place on his own, it was a lot of space for just one person. Hermione tried to convince him to decorate the house to make it feel more homely but he couldn't find the motivation. He didn't plan on staying there for long anyway, it was just convenient for now. He had connected the building to electricity though. He didn't care if the wizarding world refused to use it, he wanted to watch TV when he got bored. Mr Weasley had been beside himself when Harry had let him use the remote when he'd invited him and the other Weasley's round for dinner.
“She doesn’t need to be useful, she’s so cute,” Hermione said, cuddling the cat even closer to her chest. Pepper purred and closed her eyes, apparently deciding she liked Hermione now.
Harry jumped at the sound of her voice and looked over at her in surprise. Clearly, he had been too preoccupied to noticed her standing in the doorway. “Oh, hey Hermione,” he said. He glanced quickly at Malfoy, looking wary. “I’ll be down in just a second.”
“Malfoy isn’t as bad as he used to be.”
“What time is it?”
Potter looked at him expectantly and Draco realised he hadn't said anything, too distracted by the way Potter had balled the cuffs of his sleeves in his hands and his tousled black hair that was even messier than usual.
“It’s not that bad Ron, you won’t even have to talk to him.” Hermione rolled her eyes. That was true, Harry thought, at least he wouldn’t have to speak to him and he doubted Malfoy would be in any hurry to speak to him either.
Draco’s heart sank as he realised he desperately didn’t want to be alone right now.
Oh shit. He threw his covers aside, getting out of the bed so fast, stars appeared around his vision. “What time is it?” He grabbed his glasses from his bedside table and shoved them on so he could see the clock on his wall. 10:04 am. The train would be leaving at 11 and he still had to finish packing.
So, he came up with a plan. First, he needed Malfoy to get used to him being around without thinking it was weird. He had already permanently moved to the seat besides Malfoy in potions. The first and second time he had done this, Malfoy had regarded him with confusion and surprise, now he would just sigh as if it was what he expected. They’d work together in silence, Harry occasionally attempted to start a conversation, which Malfoy responded to with short answers and refusal to hold the conversation.
He started to protest but then caught Hermione’s eye and gave up. He narrowed his eyes at her and she shrugged. “Malfoy...” Harry mumbled.
“Shut up,” he snapped.
He had almost decided to ignore the them when the voices started to turn more aggressive followed by a thumping sound. He pushed away from the wall and made his way over to the hallway, careful to be quiet so he wouldn’t be noticed.
He sighed. Perhaps she had a point. Pansy was an excellent judge of character. “Whatever.”
Pansy and Blaise were the only other Slytherins to have returned with him. Goyle was too stupid to complete his OWLs let alone his NEWTs, so he had opted for finding a job that involved physical work, Draco wasn’t sure whether he had succeeded. And honestly, he didn’t care.
It took him ten minutes to finish and then another five to dig out and put on the clothes he had chosen to wear on the train and accidentally packed with everything else. By the time he had eaten breakfast and stuffed everything into the taxi he had called (his trunk was too big for apparation), it was almost 10:30. It usually took around 25 minutes to get to Kings Cross station from his house and then he had to actually get to the platform. He didn’t want a repeat of 2nd year and he had been looking forward to his last journey on the Hogwarts Express.
Seeing Potter at the welcome feast with the newfound knowledge of his feelings and without a war or trial hanging over him, Draco wondered how he hadn’t noticed it before. His obsession with him was so obviously more than just hate. He craved his attention. He longed to be sitting on the other side of the Great Hall next to him. It made him feel pathetic.
“Sorry! I overslept.” Hermione took Pepper when Harry passed her over so he could carry his trunk. “Is everyone else here?”
“I get nightmares too,” Harry mumbled after a while. Draco’s heart clenched inexplicably. It was nothing he didn’t already know, but something about how small Harry sounded made him want to close the distance between them and wrap his arms around him, whether to comfort Harry or himself he wasn’t sure. Perhaps it was both.
"That was a cheap move," Draco complained.
He’d learnt to just go with it when it came to Harry and his weird behaviour.
“Was Malfoy bothering you?” Ron asked, looking ready to go after him and defend his friend. Harry appreciated it but shook his head.
“Was it good?” Harry asked as they started in the direction of the castle. “The book, I mean.”
“Really?” Her smile widened and her eyes danced with mirth. “Because I’m pretty sure I just saw the two of you walk out of the library together. Potter looked very pleased with himself.”
“Well don’t.”
“I just thought you might like to talk about it,” Harry shrugged. This was true, but it was also because Harry felt like he always talked about himself when he was with Malfoy, trying to fill any silences before it got awkward. He didn’t want to be the only one talking. He wanted to know pointless things about Malfoy. “Is it good?”
“We were talking about who’s going to be back this year,” Ron said. “Neville, Dean and Seamus are a few doors down but I didn’t get to see anyone else.”
“Really?” Ginny turned back to him, a curious smirk on her face.
(Just as a side note: I now have two kittens and one of them is named Pepper!)
Ron turned to look at her properly. Seeming to realise she was being serious, he frowned. “Do you believe that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"The ones you live with?" He had assumed Harry had some relatives that looked after him but he always pictured a perfect family. He definitely didn't expect him to have the kind of family that made him shrink in on himself as soon as he mentioned them.
“Did you finish the book?” He asked as he stretched his arms out to the side, almost hitting Draco in the face.
"That sounds lonely." It did, living alone in your dead godfather's house. Draco had never realised just how alone Harry was. Despite his fame and friends, he was just as lonely as Draco was. He supposed that was probably how he ended up with Pepper.
They didn’t have potions the next day but when he walked into the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, the desks were pushed against the walls to clear a space in the centre of the room. Everyone gathered in the space and waited for the new professor to give them instructions. She explained that they would be practicing in pairs, which was convenient for Harry. He scanned the class and found Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini standing at the back. He subtly edged closer to them, only half listening to the professor, until he was standing right next to them. He vaguely registered that they would be practicing casting non-verbal spells.
She smirked, his lack of comeback meaning she had won. Her eyes flicked from him to across the hall to the Gryffindor table. “He’s looking over here.”
“Need a partner?” he asked Malfoy, making him jump. He had to suppress a laugh as Malfoy turned to glare at him.
Harry snorted softly and said, “You do now.”
“Yes.”
Harry reached a hand down and Draco reluctantly took it, letting himself be pulled up. He brushed the grass from his trousers and picked up his things.
“Good, we’ve got our first game next week.”
“Fine then. Keep your secrets.”
"What?" Harry said defensively, inexplicably confused at Draco's reaction. His hands had stopped playing with the grass and were now resting on his sides, arms wrapped folded over his stomach. Draco wondered if he was cold. He had put his Slytherin jumper back on over his quidditch robes but Harry had refused to put his own on, claiming he didn't feel the cold.
Harry stirred awake to the feeling of a wet nose pressing against his cheek. He brought a hand up to brush the feeling away, burrowing further into his pillow to hide his face. He had almost drifted back into a sleep filled with broomsticks and snitches, when the nose returned to the back of his neck, nudging more insistently.
“Well, they didn’t offer
The only reply he received was a meow and the soft pat of a paw. With a resigned groan Harry shifted onto his back and grabbed the ball of fluff that had fallen to the side from his movements. “Remind me why I kept you?” he asked, as he wrapped his arms around his needy cat, hugging her to his chest. Instead of curling up on top of him like she usually would, she wriggled free and meowed loudly at him.
Harry was about to follow him when he saw Hermione and Ron at the top of the stairs. They passed Malfoy on their way down and eyed him suspiciously as they passed, probably noticing how upset he was.
I feel like I sometimes waffle on and nothing actually happens? I hope you guys don’t think that but I promise stuff will actually happen in this fic
He had been subtly looking over at him while also pretending to be invested in Pansy’s story but apparently, she had noticed.
But he couldn’t tell his friends that. He thought about how uncomfortable Draco had been when Hermione walked into their room. He clearly didn’t want people knowing.
“Are you sure it’s alright for me to take this?”
Harry and Draco’s late night quidditch games had become a regular thing, and after not sleeping all night, Harry had formed a habit of sleeping during the day. Usually coming to find wherever Draco was sitting quietly reading and falling asleep next to him. Draco didn’t seem to mind. Which was why today, before he was rudely awoken by Hermione, he had left his friends in the common room and come to find Draco in their room. He did not however, come for a manicure.
“Stop complaining and take the bloody food,” Harry said with exasperation. “You’d be eating it upstairs anyway.”
“I-” Pepper, apparently unhappy with the lack of attention she was getting, jumped up onto the table. Draco jumped, he hadn’t seen the cat approach behind Potter. Subconsciously, he lifted a hand to pet her, then remembered that Potter was watching him and retracted it. He balled his hand into a fist and lowered in onto the table. Potter slid Draco’s ink pot away from Pepper’s swaying tail and said, “sorry, she sort of just does what she wants...”
“I don’t think so,” he said, appreciating the slight change in subject. “We don’t talk much. Or at all really.”
“Alright.” Harry made a quick decision, he had nothing else to do today and he didn’t have the energy to go anywhere. He already said he’d meet Hermione and Ron at dinner anyway. His knee bumped into Malfoy’s as he uncrossed his legs and stretched them out, getting into a more comfortable position. “Let me know when you’re finished.”
If he was honest with himself, and he rarely was, he quite enjoyed the lessons. They worked well together, with Potter’s practicality and Draco’s intellect, they complimented each other. It was almost as if they really were friends. He gave his obligatory protest to keep up his facade the first time, but could only bring himself to glare when Potter kept coming back. He suspected he would do the same in every lesson if there weren’t a set seating plan in all their other classes.
“All the Gryffindors are back and I think about half of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs,” Hermione said, because of course she knew. Harry wasn’t going to come back, he didn't exactly enjoy school. But then Ron told him that Hermione had convinced him to go and he hadn’t known what else to do with himself. He could have started his training to be an Auror, the Ministry had offered him numerous times, but he didn’t wanted to go without Ron. Besides, he’d been having second thoughts about being an Auror. “I’m not sure about the Slytherins, but I’m pretty sure I saw Narcissa Malfoy out on the platform.”
Malfoy glared at him. “What does it matter what I read?”
He wouldn’t have chosen to come back to Hogwarts if it wasn’t for his fear of being unemployed. He could always live off his family’s money but that sounded mind-numbingly dull, sitting around the Manor all day with nothing to do. His mother had been telling him it was what was best for him ever since it was announced that students would be welcomed back at Hogwarts to complete their NEWTs. He had protested at first. Why should he go back to a place where everyone hated him? But in the end, he couldn’t deny she was right. It was going be difficult enough getting a job with his reputation, there was no point making things harder for himself by not finishing his education.
Harry started to panic, he’d never been very good with emotions. He considered letting Malfoy to get over it on his own, that was clearly what he wanted. But Harry couldn’t help but think of how lonely he must be at the moment. The few friends that he had never seemed to spend any time with him. Not many Slytherins had come back for eighth year, most of them too cowardly to be back at Hogwarts. Maybe Malfoy wasn’t as much of a coward as Harry thought.
He couldn't see if Potter had followed but he'd always had good reflexes so he was sure he had. Draco hadn't been on a broom in so long, it was refreshing to feel the wind whip around his body and through his hair. He couldn't stop the grin from spreading over his face if he tried.
Harry smiled at him when they reached the doors and clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. It was the kind of gesture you saw guys do with their friends because they thought they were too manly to hug. “See you later, then.” Harry let go of his shoulder with a squeeze, his fingers brushing down Draco’s arm as he lowered it and walked away. Draco’s hand followed as if it were magnetically attached to Harry’s.
He looked over at Harry for the hundredth time, giving up on the paragraph he had attempted to reread just as many times. The beams of orange sunlight that shone through the leaves of the tree they sat under made Harry’s skin look almost golden. He was reminded of an article he’d read in the Prophet, they had called Potter their ‘Golden Boy’. He’d scoffed at it at the time, but now he could only think that it was fitting. Even his Gryffindor tie had stripes of gold. He shone so bright Draco forced himself to look away.
Harry continued to walk down the empty aisle, Pepper following, and stopped just short of the wooden table where Malfoy sat. His head was bent over the desk, where he was scrawling on a piece of parchment in small neat handwriting. He must have heard his footsteps as him approached but he didn’t look up. “Want some company?” Harry asked.
An hour later he saw something small and black jump from Potter’s bed and wander over to where he was sitting. He looked down and to find Potter’s cat staring up at him with wide eyes. It was a long-haired black cat with white socks and blue eyes. “What?” he asked it. The cat just blinked so Draco decided to ignore it, turning back to his book. It continued to stare at him but Draco determinedly didn’t react trying to re-find his place.
“Your hand was just hanging there. I couldn’t not do it.”
He leaned his head against the raindrop spattered window, eyes still heavy from his nap. He sighed softly as he watched Draco dip the brush and gently grab his hand again. It was silent but for the heavy raindrops hitting the window pane and Harry’s eyes travelled from Draco’s long fingers up his arm to where he knew the dark mark was hidden beneath his sleeve. He could almost see the outline of it beneath his thin, white shirt. He was always wearing long sleeves. In fact, Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen him wear anything but his plain white dress shirt since 6th year. He wasn’t surprised, people reacted badly enough to Draco without him displaying a reminder of his mistakes on his arm.
No. This was marginally better. At least he wasn’t willingly part of a cult lead by a sadistic maniac anymore.
Though I didn’t feel that overwhelming feeling of darkness anymore I did learn why I was having that hard problem, and it was not something that I was aware of until this day of darkness. It gave me much to think about and I had to consider how Harry would take the news. I just hoped I would never have one of these dark days ever again.
“Who are you?”
Fun fact! I combined information from a movie I loved to watch as a child plus a bit of knowledge of the stars to make up the story of the Dragons heart. It is not the name of the star in the constellation, but it's romantic. And to any constellations fan out there being mad that it’s not accurate, this is a fictional story so does not have to be.
“I can’t. We have got a war to plan for.”
Apparently, that was all I needed because I stopped asking him to write them down.
Doing this allowed me to force him to take breaks. He actually took that time to work on homework and improve himself. Then just before the last class final he approached me. He grabbed me and hugged me to his chest and whispered in my ear, “Draco, I wouldn’t have been able to feel so accomplished with how well I did in any of my classes had you not shown me a way to balance my needs with the needs of others.” Then he smiled that wonderful smile of his and I fell even deeper in love with him.
I remained laying down trying to see if I could find something familiar in the room that I was in, and nothing looked like something I had seen before.
He left the library laughing. I smiled to myself as I wondered if I would ever be able to tell him or if the curse will kill me first. See what I hadn’t told Harry was something I would keep with me till I died or got a little too close to death. I read it out-loud after I was sure he was gone. “‘If the other person rejects them then they will die because Veela cannot handle rejection from any possible mate.’ How can I tell him I love him if he ever knew the truth?”
My heart hurt and twisted on those words. I turned to him ready to tell him everything, but I was stopped as soon as I saw his face. “I know it will hurt not knowing, Harry, but trust me it will be all worth it when you win this war and destroy the cruelest monster in this world. You will survive this war Harry and if you don’t I will have no reason to carry on. If I could tell you without risk of betraying my heart I would, but there is too much at risk. I can’t-won’t- risk letting the curse get me.”
“No, I just want to see what kind of person got your attention Malfoy.”
You can take my breath away
“I know, but I really want to tell my friends that I have someone who means the world to me, and most of mine know you’re a Veela so none of them should say anything about it.”
“It was during the battle before the end when Voldemort called Harry out for a sacrifice to save the students of Hogwarts. I was with them when he entered the part closest to us. Voldemort had shot the killing curse at him and ordered me to check and see if he was dead. I froze, I had a feeling that he was the boy you had told me about for ages and I was worried that I losing him so soon after the curse took hold of you would kill you so I asked him if you were alive, he answered with a small nod of the head and I told the monster that he was dead even though he wasn’t. It was why they let me off with house arrest instead of Azkaban. Thank you again Harry for your written alibi for me it got me more freedom than my husband and now I can meet you and see my son.”
“I know. But once we start going other places, the world, mostly our friends, will need to know. I don’t know much about your friends, but I think most of them, like mine, will not like the idea of us dating.”
After waking up, I had to wait a long time for my injures to heal before I was allowed out of the hospital wing. That had taken a week. Then I began helping with the reconstruction of Hogwarts, and that had taken another week. I had had enough. I walked around till I found the boy who had been plaguing my mind for weeks now. "Harry Potter."
“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it ok? For now, just be here.”
I wept for a small while and then hugged him hard. “I will make sure that every summer is the best summer Harry because I always want to see you smile.”
Even though it was winter some of the plants were still blooming, and Harry stopped me as we passed them. “Why do these plants still bloom even in winter?” was all he asked.
He looked at me, with those eyes of his, practically begging me to say we tell others. Thing is, I didn’t want to tell anyone else. I had told the one person that mattered the most, and hadn’t even thought to tell anyone else. Yet, I knew that Harry needed everyone to know.
I can kiss away the pain
I felt like stone as I sunk onto the floor. I saw Longbottom staring at me, and I wiped my face to find tears. “I saw your memories, and I believe you. I won’t ask you about what I just witnessed, but I will tell you this. You better tell him what I just saw if he lives through this.”
“This is the last time I tell anybody anything.”
Then the nightmares got worse and worse until all I dreamed where them. I was lost in the nightmares that plagued my mind and it was all I could see. It felt like I spent years in the darkness, but when I awoke, I was glad to know that only a month had gone by.
Both Luna and she nodded their heads. “You forgot that Veela, who have found their mate but haven’t completed the bonds, once away from their mate will slowly fall into a sleep state until either their mate is there, or something with the scent of the mate is near them. That is something you should remember until your bonded to Harry.”
As much as I wanted to cheer for his success if I had tried that at the time I would have gotten close kissed his lips and spoken the truth to him. I mean I had gotten so close to revealing the truth that I had a great set up of just straight up telling him how I felt, but I couldn’t tell him because it would put everyone in danger including myself. I decided to tell him this, “I am glad that you did it. Here sit down and wait for me to brew you some tea that you can drink while we wait for the others.”
I decided that we had to go to Godric’ s Hallow. So, we went, and Draco fallowed. Hermione and I went into my old house and Draco stayed in the graveyard. When all hell broke loose, I was not expecting to lose him. He was gone, lost, most likely dead, and it was all my fault. I wanted to cry but, figured that at least it wasn’t the curse that killed him. Ron came back after we found another one in the vault that we stole it from. I was hollow, empty, and lost. I was remembering everything that happened that lead to this point. It didn’t matter to me anymore who he loved, I just wanted-needed-him back in my life breathing right next to me. But he wasn’t and that was my fault.
“Hermione, I would be a fool not to trust you after all you’ve done for me. You convinced Weasley that I wasn’t a spy, you healed me, and are letting me join you even though I have done nothing but hurt and mock for as long as I’ve known you. So, this is the least I could do in return.”
“Will you at least think about telling the person you like them after it’s all over?”
We destroyed two of those stupid life lines and knew that there had to be more at Hogwarts, so we made are way there. When we got there Neville greeted us with a smile. He dragged me off to the side, “Harry, you won’t believe this but Draco Malfoy is on our side! He is probably in the girl’s room that Moaning Myrtle used to hang out in right now, but I wouldn’t- “
I blushed unsure of how to respond. I gave a nod and opened the door leading him in. We got ready for bed and I slept with my arms around his waist and my head on his shoulder. There could never be a better way to start off my summer than this moment right here in his embrace.
“Father never planted one. He said the practice was archaic and frivolous and refused to ever plant one. I’m kind of glad though because it would have rotted this garden ages ago.”
“I will make sure that the battle doesn’t even reach this room. I will protect you Draco, and when it’s over we will talk about this.”
When he finished talking Harry came over and talked to me. “I know it must hurt being kept from the one you are mated with, but just this once, stay here and wait for it to be over. I need you to be alive when this is all over, so that we can talk about this. I promise that I will see you after this battle.”
“I will not risk it, not until the war is done.”
“Ron, I know that, but no parent would just sit by and let this happen for a year without a reason, and personally I don’t think that is the reason.”
Then as if by magic it was suddenly Christmas morning and the three of us sat down by the tree having breakfast before we started opening the presents. “Alright boys, it’s time for presents.”
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived stood in the wards I had placed very carefully around the camp site, was the one who stood in front of me when I went to check. I nearly froze as I saw him, the pull I always had around him wanted me to kiss him and beg him to never do that ever again. Instead I of course went back into the tent to make some tea for all of us since Harry returned that meant that the other two would soon be coming.
“Yes, I do.”
Finding you the perfect gift was extremely difficult to do. I found you a jacket that I wore for a month that I will give to you, but I thought that it wasn’t enough so I found something really pretty and will show it to you later.
“Well no… But, oh well it doesn’t matter now. I will tell you but you must listen all the way through with no questions till the end all right?”
“Yes, we understand.”
I spent days in and out of the girl’s room away from the place that I met him. Everywhere I looked I couldn’t help but think of him, not even the girl’s room. Still, it was quiet and I needed that. I would continue to go to the mirror and try to find those lost words. But, I never could. They were as lost as a sailor alone on the sea for the first time. I would try to find them, but I always end up back on the floor with Longbottom dragging me back to the Hospital Wing.
I never thought he would actually leave me behind. He did, but still it was shocking. I still remember them coming up to me and telling me what was going to happen. “Look Draco, Hermione, Ron, and I are going to go lead the battle and try to stop this war before it starts. We, however, cannot just leave you alone. If we did you probably would get yourself involved, so we are going to have someone guard you.”
“That isn’t even half of the present. In the envelope is also the Malfoy family ring. Consider it your mark of being claimed by a Malfoy.”
I didn’t answer her and instead just went to the table for breakfast. Shortly after, while she was handing out the plates, Harry woke up and made his way to the table and sat next to me. Breakfast was a quiet affair until Harry spoke of our next move.
Well, I don't care, you're here tonight
“Potter, I can’t ever tell anyone how I truly feel about them because if I do, I will awaken the Veela blood within me and that will cause me to fallow my mate whoever they maybe.”
I woke up in the medical wing of Hogwarts. The first person I saw when I woke up was Madam Pomfrey and the second was Neville Longbottom who was talking with her.
He turned around and sat face to face with me. "This was the best first date I ever had. Thank you, Draco."
She opened the present and inside was a golden Narcissa plant with Lilly leaves. She gasped, and Harry responded. “A gift for both my mothers given to the one who is here to receive it. The gold changes colors depending on your mood.”
He relaxed at that answer but the tug that pulled at me wanted to get closer to him to ease him with myself. It was a strange strong pull that felt impossible to pull away from. I felt my heart grow weak and my mouth go dry. It felt like the first time I realized that I loved Harry Potter. I looked at him hoping the pull worked both ways but was surprised when he spoke. “You can go to the library and read whatever you can find.”
“Draco?”
"I don't need this build up just tell me."
He smiled at me and tugged me towards the exit of the garden and brought me inside where we had cocoa and snuggled for the rest of the day.
This time the kiss was swift and gentle. He looked me in the eyes before he spoke next. “What did I do to deserve someone like you to be mine?”
“I know that Draco, but I fear the people will try to tear us apart and I know I can’t spend a day without seeing you in it.” He sat me against the tree pulled my hands to his lips and kissed them. He put up one knee pulled out of box and moved it closer to me. “Since I can’t spend a day without you in it, I figured I’d make you mine forever to the public. Draco, will you marry me and be mine forever?”
I gave a soft chuckle. “And you look sexy.” We didn’t talk much after that. He and I worked together unsure how everything would work, but once the flame was ignited it didn’t stop. We got to see the stars that night. I was on Harry’s chest after many times of love making. Harry used a charm to make the roof to the room invisible, and we looked at the stars. After naming as many stars and constellations he finally stopped and gave me another kiss. Even though we wanted to talk some more we were exhausted and fell asleep shortly after the star session.
I remembered what happened and flinched feeling the left-over bruises. I also felt the pull of a strange force, but decided to ignore it for the time being. It was then that I heard shouting coming from below us.
I will stand by you forever
I felt a warm spot forming on my shirt, I looked down to see him crying. "Why cry?" I whisper. "You tell me such a romantic story of your namesake, and include a connection to my Godfather who I lost because of that lunatic. You even put my hand to your heart. Why now? Why did you not start with holding my hand? Why wait till the end to put my hand on your heart? Why are you being cruel to me?"
They argued till the door to the room I was in opened and I saw two more people I have tormented. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Of course, Harry Potter had to save me from death’s door, or Fathers whip whichever comes first. Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived, who saved us all when he was just a baby, the boy who’s story I had heard a million times before I actually met him, and the boy who was so eye catching that I felt the feeling of falling in love. I was such an idiot though and loss any chance at being friends with him when I insulted his new friend.
“Then, it would be you who’d leave me before I’d leave you.”
This picks up literally right after chapter six. Enjoy!
“She didn’t, but I read up on Veela when you handed me the book. It was so I would know what would happen. Just so you know, you and Harry might be mates, but that doesn’t mean you are bonded.”
So, we waited, and waited… and waited, until we heard a scream. “That sounded like Ginny. She never screams, what could it be?”
I turned back and entered into Hogwarts. I went to search through the library in hopes to figuring out what caused my hard problem. It was hard to concentrate on any of the books, and it didn’t take long for me to give up the search. I sat back in the chair and realized that this, besides going to sleep, was the first time I hadn’t spent time with Harry. I suddenly felt really cold, and empty. It was as if all the light and warmth of the world was drained from it. It hurt to breath, and not smell his sent, it felt like something was missing from everything. It was like I was locked in that dark room chained and in pain.
“Where is the plant for your mom?”
“I think he put a horcrux in Godric’s Hallow. I need to go there to find out for sure.”
"I am only going to say this once Harry Potter. Are you focused?"
"Harry, you are my mate." He froze in my arms. I took the opportunity to feel his hand in mine over my heart, to breath in his sent, to feel him in my arms. I wanted to kiss him so badly. "You're not lying right? Cause that is cruel if you are. I mean if you are lying to me than you are the jerkiest arsehole in the whole of England, no in the entire world!"
“I know. Hermione thanks for the shirt. I would have hated feinting in the library, and I wouldn’t have enjoyed waking up to his face covered in tears.”
They both stopped talking when Granger shut them up.
“Why is it different now?”
For a short minute the Veela in me was sad because that sentence meant that the family it had, unknowingly, dreamt up for Harry and I wouldn’t come true. It was sad until Hermione gave him a question.
"And I love you Harry… Still scared Potter?"
Would you swear that you'll always be mine?
We planned to have our wedding to be the next summer at this very garden with all our friends and family at this place where I learned the value of my smiles for him. It was my way of making sure that next summer he’d smile for sure. He laughed at that comment but told me that it was perfect. It was my way of giving him just one more smile for the day.
I smiled knowing exactly what to get him. “Alright, Harry I will get you something. Personally, I wouldn’t mind something like a big jacket that reminds me of you, preferably with your sent on it. I’m sure you can think of something to get me.”
“Why?”
“Look at him Ron, he would’ve died down there at least now he can help us since he probably knows Voldemort’s plans.”
“He did?” I looked at Harry and saw the innocent look on his face. He was playing a game with me. I smirked as I thought. Well two can play at this game. After my name had been cleared shortly after the battle, and I had begun to help rebuild Hogwarts; most people thought that I had became friends with Harry and I took advantage of that thought to casually pull him to my side and then hold him there by his waist. I spoke only loud enough for Harry and Hermione to hear me. “Harry here is my mate.”
“I am sure we will. You all have a battle to prepare for, so may I have some time to myself.”
I started to cry, and he held me close and whispered to me. “Hey, don’t cry you given me a reason to smile. I would rather see your smile than see your tears. The only tears I ever want to see are tears of joy okay?”
I was shocked to hear why the three of them were there out together doing who knows what. It made me frightened as to what they were searching for. I found out that they were looking for horcruxes that Voldemort made many years ago. They couldn’t have been even more insane then they already were yet they shocked me with that information that not only did these things exist, but that they had to find all six of them.
“Then we can get some information out of him. Now, would one of you please bathe him?”
Red hair like fire as they danced along with black cinder. Two men, brothers fight back to back against the cinder. They are strong, but the cinder men out number them. They look at each other, at the face that they not only see in the mirror, but that they see from the person beside them. They both smile at each other, but the one with blue eyes protects the one with green. He takes the hit of a spell that kills, and falls down in silence, a smile on his face. When he lands a voice is all I hear in my ears. “Protect him, for he holds an important fate in his hands. Guide him to her when he is ready, for your sister Veela is ready.”
I went to bed that night with dreams of a smiling Harry, and a really hard problem. I knew that one day I would have to convince Harry that this particular problem is one I cannot solve by myself, or rather don’t want to solve by myself, and ask for his assistance but I would never rush this. I couldn’t ever rush him into any of this Veela-ness. I just knew that a week into any relationship, especially ours, is not the time to discuss such things. I dealt with the hard problem by myself not really feeling satisfied, and I went to bed hoping that tomorrow I would feel better.
I knew what my next move was but, I didn’t know what was going to happen to Harry and the Golden Trio. I couldn’t help but think of all of the things that had happened to me and wonder if they will be okay. I was sure they’d be fine but I wasn’t absolutely certain that they’d be fine. I fell asleep in that cave worrying if things were going to be okay because I wanted to see his smile one more time.
We eat in silence and once we are done his smile falters for a second. "Scared Potter?" I say jokingly at him. "Terrified, actually. I am terrified that what you are about to tell me is that you will have to leave me and go find your mate. I'd rather just sit here with you and watch the stars." I could feel his sadness in radiating waves of hurt and pain. I pull him in a way that he is sitting on my lap.
“Those are my wings, and currently they are protecting us from the on rush of students begging for our attention.”
“I promise. Hermione… will you and Luna please stay with me?”
I thought no one would save me or even help me, but I was running out of options. After I started the summer before my sixth year at Hogwarts, I was faced with a nightmare many thought dead for years and yet there he was standing to greet me as I entered my house for the summer.
I saw him, standing there with a mixture of shock and happiness on his face. All I could feel was this immense pain trying to throw me deeper into the curse. I smelt the air, and suddenly smelt an intoxicating smell. I knew that the owner of the smell was near, and that they were mine. I felt my muscles pull apart and reshape themselves. My shoulders felt heavier when my wings started to grow. All the time I can’t keep my eyes off of Harry.
I had never before heard Harry sing but it was beautiful. The song was slightly sad sounding, but he sang it with a smile on his lips so I couldn’t help but be happy. We danced the night away to many more songs, but eventually we bid our guests ado.
The two of them looked at him weirdly. “What? Harry? Hermione? Was it something I said?”
“That won’t be hard because all you have to do is smile and my day becomes my favorite day. I love you Draco and being by your side makes this summer the best summer.”
He didn’t answer me with his voice, but rather is nodding head. So, after three weeks of dating I had to let him leave my side. I watched him leave Hogwarts wearing Gryffindor colors, as if he was going on a school trip. I could feel the sadness in the air.
“Well, I saw all those hands coming over, and thought that they would touch you. I wasn’t going to let anyone but me touch you for at least another month, and I really don’t want to answer a million questions from your fans anytime soon.”
“Love?”
“Harry, we have been over this before. I won’t risk it not when it could mean the end to life as we know it.”
He smiled back. He then whispered in a small voice that only I could hear. “I could be a dad, one day?”
It had been now two whole months since I was saved by Harry Potter and co. and I haven’t been allowed to leave the room I’ve been forced to sit in for that time. Granted that’s not quite true I have been allowed to use the restroom down the hall (when I was healed enough to walk), but I haven’t been told that I am free to wonder. I was getting bored and decided to see if they would allow me to read some of the books in the library so I went to ask the three of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We haven’t even sat down with individuals and hear them threaten to kill you if you harm me yet. The troubles have only begun Draco.”
I felt like purring at the nickname but held back for now. “I would like it to be a long engagement half a year minimum, a year max. We just started dating and even though we have known each other for years people still only see me as the Death Eater’s son; if we go to fast with this they will all think I put a spell on you or something. I know its not fair to you, but I don’t want you have to prove it to the world that you aren’t. Can we do that, for me please?”
“And if they aren’t?”
Harry had frozen at what I had said. He turned to look me in the eye and said, “I can hurt you by leaving you alone?”
This was the last place on earth that I wanted to be. I didn’t think that being caught by snatchers would lead them to bringing us here. But then again, last year I would never had thought I would go anywhere, but Hogwarts. It was a big shock to learn about Voldemort’s plan of eternal life, and way of defeating me. Horcruxes, some gross, nasty, little things made whenever some wizard kills someone and splits their own soul into an object. Dumbledore told me about these things last year, just before I watched Snape kill him. I promised him that I would find all them, and destroy them before trying to end the Bald menace, better known as He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
“I know Hermione, but that only happens to…Oh my… I am a submissive Veela aren’t I?”
“I will call you ‘Harry’ the day you call me Draco, Potter.”
I can be your hero baby
“Yes, you can.”
“Well they might if the introduction I plan to make didn’t start with. ‘When I turned Veela my mate turned out to be…’ and you know them knowing that threatening a Veela with killing its mate would get you dead they wouldn’t dare.”
"Harry." I say to throw him out of his train of thought.
“I say we start with Hermione, then go tell Ron, then the rest of Weasley clan, then we hit up my side with my mother, Blaise, and then Pansy.”
“Mama, Harry wanted to spend the summer with us is that alright?”
Even though they had gotten some hair from her when leaving the Manor, it did not mean that it was the best course of action. So, they thought of a plan without me. When they were done Hermione went to find water so Harry and I were left alone.
That was till I smelt the familiar smell of rain in fall, like chocolate being heated up, like vanilla in the wind, like Harry. I turned towards the door, and was shocked not to see Harry, but rather Luna. “You shouldn’t have let him go alone quiet yet, the Nargels will get you.” She handed me a shirt I recognized as Harry’s. I held it breathing without pain for the first time that day.
“I think I will save that story for another time. I would love to finish our picnic and then we have to go pack for the summer.”
After that we decided that we would return to Hogwarts for one more year. Though we were worried about being separated, we knew we could find ways to stay close even though we were in different houses. I decided then that every summer with Harry would be the best summer ever.
“I will try.”
They looked at each other and answered in unison. “Yes”
Once Christmas was over and classes had started up again, I had no more time to spend by Harry's side. This did not make me sad, instead it gave me strength to get through the harsh tests and seemingly endless papers that I had to complete. Even though we had little time where we did nothing, Harry and I would do nothing together. Those moments where we did nothing were my favorite because we would simply sit and enjoy the company of each other.
I smiled at him. “It’s okay, now you know, and it doesn’t hurt anymore.” Which is true, when I heard that he didn’t know that my heart fluttered, and I felt extremely better.
I watched as they talked amongst themselves not listening to them when I felt the pull get stronger. I didn’t know why this was happening but I had a feeling that I had to do something.
(See the end of the chapter for
We sat together for a while and Harry sighed, turned on some music and offered his hand to me for a dance. I smiled taking the hand and going for a dance with Harry. “You know,” He said as we swayed, “ever since you said you could have kids I was sort of hoping for little ones being my present this year, as well as calling you my wife as we danced. I guess I was hoping to shout to the world you are mine by now. Don’t get me wrong the first two weeks after the war were awful with people blaming you for your fathers mistakes, and I knew then you were right in asking for me to wait, but after a month of us publicly dating things died down and I was hoping that you would change your mind about it. I kept wondering why you wanted to continue to wait.” He twirled me around and pulled me in giving me a sweet kiss before we continued our swaying.
“Draco, I have been wondering about how we would see each other from now on and I thought I might have to spend the summer without seeing you…”
“Call me Mother, Harry it would please me so much.”
Hermione appeared behind Luna a book in her hand. “I know that Hermione, but that doesn’t mean I can’t let him out of my sight for one day…I’m an idiot, aren’t I?”
He hugged me, pulled back and placed the ring on my finger he went into kiss me, but I stopped him. “Harry, I have one request before we get excited and end up snogging all day…again.”
“I didn’t know wizards read muggle books,” he said offhandedly. He thought this was an acceptable way to start a conversation with Malfoy. He was always reading, Harry thought maybe he’d appreciate being asked about his books. Apparently not.
“Wow, you’re good at this,” Harry said as he struggled to unstick his feet from the ground. Most spells like this one wore off pretty quickly, even when they were cast verbally. Malfoy must have practiced non-verbal spells before. He was so focused on pealing the sole of his shoe from the floorboards that he missed the faint blush that rose to Draco’s cheeks at the compliment.
“You were,” Blaise said. Draco glared at him.
“Ok, how about I chop everything up and you put them in and stir?” He could tell that Malfoy wanted to argue for the sake of it.
“I hate you,” he said, holding his hand out to Draco.
He gave a clearly confused Ron his broom with a promise to meet him and Hermione in the great hall, then started walking across the grass field to the edge of the forest, hoping Ron wasn’t paying too much attention to the direction he was going.
“Do you want to eat breakfast together?” he asked, awkwardly.
Then again, she should have a bit more faith in Harry. If he thought Malfoy was trustworthy, then so should she. Maybe Harry knew exactly what he was doing and she was worried for no reason. Maybe she had misjudged the whole situation and they really were just friends. It was none of her business anyway.
"Yes we are. Come on, get up."
“Can’t you bring some food up for me?” Draco said hopefully.
“No, you’re just too forgiving.”
Harry went to agree, because that was the reason he started bothering Draco in the first place, wasn’t it? But then he stopped. He hadn’t really thought about it since he’d first sat with Malfoy in potions, something he did now without thinking. But it wasn’t like that anymore. He liked Draco, and he liked spending time with him.
“Is this... something you do a lot? Eating down here?” Draco asked. Harry seemed like he’d been down here before, he even knew some of the elves by name, and Draco was curious why.
Frowning, Draco leaned over and opened his curtain to look at him. He was facing away from him, wearing red checked pyjama bottoms. Without a top. Draco swallowed as Potter stretched for a moment before bending down to retrieve a discarded jumper that was lying on the floor. His muscles shifted under his skin and Draco suddenly very aware that he had never seen Potter shirtless before. What a pity. He had been missing out. He then turned around with his arms half in the sleeves of his jumper giving Draco a fantastic view of his chest. He was toned but not too much, just the right amount in Draco's opinion. He itched to cross the small space between them and run his hands down his smooth brown skin. Draco's thoughts were interrupted when Potter pulled the hem of his jumper down over his chest. His golden brown skin was now obscured by a big blue H stitched on the front of a scratchy looking jumper that was slightly too big.
He glanced over at Malfoy who was now stacking his books on his desk. He still hadn’t said a word. Something about him was off. Harry had noticed it at his trail as well. He seemed dejected, like he hadn’t smiled in months. Harry supposed be probably hadn’t. There wasn’t much to be happy about in the Malfoy household at the moment. It made Harry uneasy, he was used to Malfoy’s confidence and overall superior nature. The person standing on the other side of the room seemed like a different person all together.
He lugged his trunk up the stairs and clumsily opened the door with his foot, apparently making too much noise if Malfoy’s annoyed look was anything to go by. He was standing by a big window, one that had a seat, the setting sun giving him a soft orange glow. He had already chosen the bed on the right and was currently putting his stuff away neatly. The room was a circular shape with a chunk cut out of it like a crescent moon, where the stairs cut into the room. They were in one of the turrets that stuck out from the tower. Two beds were placed on either side of the window, beside each of the beds was a desk and chair. It was nice.
"You know, Ron and Hermione were the first friends I ever had."
“How’s it going with Malfoy? Have you tried to kill each other yet?” Ron asked, when Harry sat next to him at dinner. He had spent the rest of his afternoon unpacking and settling into his room.
Harry’s face lit up again and despite himself Draco’s lips twitched into a smile. Something about Harry wanting him there supporting him made his heart grow about three sizes.
“Come on.” Harry walked up to the table full of food that hadn’t been sorted through yet and started filling up his plate. Neither spoke as they piled up their plates, Draco with more uncertainty than Harry.
“I barely tolerate you.”
Pansy still looked concerned but she let it go. She knew it wasn’t easy to get Draco to talk about his feelings. “Because we’re going to Hogsmeade,” she said, as if it was obvious, as if they had talked about going together.
"You'll see," he said evasively. It was almost as if he knew Draco was curious where he went on his midnight walks and was using it against him.
“Well I won’t let you,” Pansy said defiantly. So far they had let him mope around and avoid them but apparently they’d had enough.
It gave up waiting eventually and Draco thought the thing would finally leave him alone until it jumped up onto his lap, knocking his book out of his hands and onto the floor. He sighed in exasperation, trust Potter to have a cat that was just as irritating as him. He picked the book up again, glaring at the cat. It meowed defiantly and nuzzled its head into Draco’s palm. It was quite cute. And he had always liked cats. They were independent and only affectionate when they wanted to be, which was something Draco could relate to. So instead of shoving Potter’s cat back onto the floor, he let it curl up on his lap, patted its head with one hand and continued reading with the other.
“It’s another curse of mine. A long time ago a Veelas intended mate was a Malfoy but they were also heir to the Malfoy name, and so out of fear of the loss of the great Malfoy name they forced the intended mate to marry someone else and cast off the Veela. The rest of the Veela society placed a curse on the Malfoy’s that said, ‘Should one of you ever tell your true feelings to someone you’ll become one of us and finally know our pain.’ Merlin was there that day and added his curse to it.”
“Hah… It was shocking once I realized I loved them. At first, I was jealous of what they had with friends then as I got older, I kept looking at them wondering when I could be the one to make them smile, to be the one who would make them want to try harder. I thought that it was a faze, something I would grow out of, but I never stopped hoping that I’d make them smile. I felt like I was going to die when I heard that my parents sided with Voldemort because I knew that meant that I would one to hurt them the most. Then I knew no matter what would happen I couldn’t tell them, because they live in the light and I- I am stuck in the dark. They mean the world to me, and as much as I want to tell them, I am not worthy of anything they give me.”
The man in front of me had no nose and wore nothing but black, which made is pale skin eerie rather than luminescent like my Father who stood beside him, and had a snake that coiled around his feet as if preparing to strike.
“Why wouldn’t you have family? I mean you’ll have Draco, and us, and…”
Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived to Steal My Heart.
“Of course, its not something most people would just automatically understand. Take the time but promise me you’ll tell him.”
It had been a week since I had learnt the truth about my curse, and everyone has decided to leave the Black Manor before someone finds us. Hermione came to talk to me while we packed. I handed her the book she looked at me confused and then asked me, “Why are you handing me this book?”
He entered the room a big smile on his face and dirt covering him. He ran to me practically causing me to fall, he kissed my lips again and I was the happiest I had ever been. It made me wonder why I ever hid my feelings in the first place. I was ready to tell him everything, but I was exhausted and before I could think about it, I had fainted into his arms asleep. I told myself that when I awoke, I would tell him everything… Hopefully.
I was being pulled away from the front door and towards the dungeon that hadn’t been used in years. This man was Voldemort someone I had only ever heard of how ruthless he could be. I knew I couldn’t be reckless or I would die. I watched as both my wrists were chained to the wall without me trying to scream, and all the while he watched me. He finally smirked at me when my eyes met his.
She stopped and looked me in the eyes while saying, “You have to tell him the truth, sooner rather than later. He needs to know before you to bond for life.”
"What?"
“She saved your life? You never told me that! When did that happen?”
I was shocked, and in that moment, I felt mad at someone who wasn’t the Bald menace. I felt that I should help him.
“Yeah, but then we get to see each other till the end of time so I think a couple of hours is nothing compared to eternity.”
He smiled for the rest of the day till he escorted me to my room. I watched him walk away and as I looked at him I wondered if his joy was sometimes too bright.
It was Hermione who told me Harry wasn’t even telling them what he was going to say. I knew that no matter what Harry said it would be perfect, but I needed to know that it wouldn’t clash with mine. It was after that when Harry told me it wouldn’t.
"You're welcome."
“Mr. Longbottom! This young man was missing for entire year! Even if he was a spy Dumbledore would’ve wanted him treated just like any student! I will not let you hurt him in any way!”
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
“I was hoping to get rid of some boredom and start doing some research about the curse that my family has, and since this is the Black ancestral home it would probably be the only pureblood library that houses the information.”
I don’t remember how long I was down there when he finally just tried talking to me. I ignored him, which isn’t a good idea I guess since it got much worse after that. I was beaten every day, no stopping or breaks and very little to eat. I wondered if this is what hell was like or if it could get even worse than this. But it did. He’d add more to what was done to me every day when finally, he asked me to join him. All I had to do was accept him and follow him and I could be free, my father would sometimes join him in trying to persuade me it didn’t work.
I giggled. “We can find a place together or live somewhere you are comfortable with. I have been disowned, but Mother left Father after she heard about what he did to me. She would love to meet the Godson of her cousin Sirius, and the fiancée of her son.”
"Well, we must not let this food go to waste. Let's sit down and enjoy our meal together."
