"What?"
I pick up the box that the love potion was in and start to read the back.
Harry was in bed, sleeping peacefully, to my relief.
"Yeah, yeah, he was."
“Really?” Ginny piped up, and Luna turned around and said, “Oh, Harry, you’ll be
God, he hopes this is the one.
It reminds me every single day what I've done.
Draco shook his head in disbelief.
"Aren't Sober-Up potions incredibly hard to make?"
Maybe I should just avoid him. That seems like the best option. Much better than my other choices...
“Oi, sorry, mate. We’ll get out of your hair. Or, uh, house, I guess.”
I’m dating the Chosen One.” I scowled and leaned in to kiss Harry. He responds immediately, as always, and slips his tongue into my mouth. I graze his bottom lip with my teeth, and he pushes me into the wall. I have a quick flashback to my first time with him.
That's a new low, even for me.
“Pansy, I’m really worried about Harry.”
talking, no,
“Turn to page 596.” (
Others nodded, and started to aparate out. (Harry had adjusted the wards so they could.) Luna threw her arms around Harry, and then backed away. Ginny pulled Harry into a tight hug, and whispered, “I really hope that this is the one, Harry.” Harry breathed in her scent, said “Me, too, Ginny. Me too.” and then backed away. Ginny gave him a kiss on his cheek, and then went over to Luna, grabbing her hand, and then apparating them out of Harry’s house.
As the guests made their way into the dining parlour, Draco’s nerves were alight. He continued to peer over at Potter, finding him politely talking with someone, taking a photograph, signing autographs. Was he here just to show off as he used to do at school?
Harry nodded, sitting at the dining table, tapping his fingers quickly on it.
“Work. I’m amazed at how you define ‘work’. You’ll just be on holiday.”
And when he finally did, it was to find Potter squirming in his seat, his eyes trained on the wand, his hands fidgeting in his lap, his bottom lip caught between his teeth. It almost looked like… he was interested in it? Potter turned to Granger, who lightly shook her head. It seemed to settle Potter, who nodded once and flicked his eyes to Draco.
“Malfoy?” Potter’s fingers snapped in front of Draco’s eyes and he shook his head, trying to regain control of himself.
“I want to see it,” he suddenly says as if he’s just now noticed you. You stop, deep into him.
“Look, the truth is that yes, tonight I spent the night at your dorms, but this morning someone—”
Why was this one of the worst hangovers Harry had ever experienced? Not only did his head feel like thousands of bees were stuck in it, his stomach was turning like a roller coaster, and he still had this weird feeling on his skin that was starting to make him nervous.
In the next ten minutes, they filled him in. Apparently, at Luna, Rolf and Neville's party he had met
“Dammit, Dray!”
And I couldn’t be more sorry about leaving you hanging! But I have great news…
must not die. I won't allow it. My mother's expression is so full of pain. I want to free her of that expression.
“There’s the spirt, Pans. Now, let’s do what we do best and come up with a 100% believable lie.”
your sex toy! We haven't shagged for a year!"
He wasn’t eating, and it looked as though he was going to fall asleep at the table. Harry wanted to go over and wrap an arm around him, pulling him into his chest, then rub his shoulders in just the way that Draco loved-
I hear him plead with Hermione, asking her to help him. With what? I’m a lost cause, Harry. I did this to myself. This isn’t your fault. If I die, it isn’t your fault.
Blaise shared a look of understanding.
“I’m so
Draco then grabs some of his clothes, and walks out of the dormitory.
I sigh inwardly, resigning myself to the fact that I’m going to have to talk about this with her. I look up at her.
you can’t even do that
I give him a mischievous look and then say, “And we’re
“Okay, Pansy. And what was C. all about?”

I place my hands on Draco’s chest, and I don’t even think of an incantation. I think about closing the cuts all over him, and I pour my magic into him. It feels like I’m a bottomless pit, I just push it into him, focusing on his chest.
There’s been an increase in the population by at least 10%.) I’m pretty sure, no,
That letter had me crying for hours. It's tear-stained now, and I laid down and cradled it to my chest, trying to absorb all the love Harry put in the letter. I crawl to the edge of my bed and grab the package that Mrs. Weasley gave me, and I open it. It's a darkish green sweater, with a
(Cauldron explosion, wand backfiring, broom crashes, etc.)
I wake the next morning to a pile of presents stacked at the end of the bed. I stare at them, willing them to be things that mean something to me, instead of the fucking expensive garbage I always get. I remember Harry telling me about the normal presents that he gets, and they're things like chocolate frogs, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, fudge, socks, and books. And his personal favorite has always been his Weasley sweater. He wears it every chance he gets, I swear.
I place the blade horizontally across my wrist, and then push push in. It hurts a lot, and I feel a few involuntary sobs work their way out of my throat. The tears slip down my cheeks, and I try to not cry. I keep pushing, going directly under my mark, and lift up once I reach the end. It’s so bloody that I can’t see anything, and, even though I don’t really care, I don’t want to die just yet. So I mutter a healing charm, and it barely works. It seals the cut a bit, stops the bleeding a tad, and I stare at my arm. I peel the bit of skin that I cut off up, and there’s more blood. If the Mark works like a Muggle tattoo, it’s only inked into the top layer of skin, and I cut that off, so it shouldn’t be there anymore, should it? I hope that I got rid of it… then I could be free. Nothing holding me back. I could go back to the way things used to be…
He looked over at Draco, who was above him. He had been circling the same spot for most of the game, and Harry was worried he was going to fall off his broom. He was slumped over, and Harry wasn't sure if he even had his eyes open.
I shake my head, and then mutter the password.
he thought to himself. Harry, replied, “Angelina, I know what’s good for my health. Of course I’ll listen to you.” Angelina gave him a bright smile, and then said, “This way,” and headed out of the room, coffee cup in her right hand, wand in her left. Harry followed next to her, on her left, hands in his pockets. Angelina turned her head so that she could talk to him. “So, we had to put him in a magical coma around a week ago. He was stressing himself out too much, and as you know, that’s not good for an Omega’s health.” Harry murmured an agreement. “Sorry I didn’t tell you.” Harry said, “It’s all good, Ang.”
Merlin, that nasal voice and theatrical mannerisms — there was no doubt, that one was Draco Malfoy.
“He’s not that bad,” Ron had said when Harry saw Malfoy for the first time at Neville’s birthday party.
Draco settled back on his heels, huffing loudly. “I’d never come again anyway, at least not so quickly.” He looked down at Potter’s stretched form, the way his eyes were almost closed, his mouth swollen and relaxed in a half-smile. Draco bit down hard on his bottom lip, forcing himself not to lay down next to Potter. Definitely not to lay down and spoon him, wrapping an arm around Potter’s waist and pulling him close.
Trying to gather his control, Harry left the package on the floor, next to the marbles, and picked Teddy up, lifting him above his head and peppering his face with kisses.
Hermione’s voice was exasperated, but fond, and Harry snorted a bit, feeling his head throbbing again at his own voice, his body shaking with a new wave of nausea.
Potter had started calling him by his first name and hearing it said by him had been new and exciting, sweet, real.
Draco exhaled deeply, handing Jerome his credit card.
“Draco? You’re scaring me. What’s happening?”
He downed it in one go, breathing deeply as the world around him started to look clearer and brighter. Much, much better. He splashed some water on his face too, then turned to glance at his wall clock. It had been a present from Hermione, to ‘make you appreciate more Muggle culture’. It was useful, indeed.
Ron and Neville, on the other hand, are convinced Harry won’t even be able to step foot into the Great Hall without hoards of fans
"What's so funny?" Asked Malfoy, his annoyingly gorgeous scowl deepening.
He launched into the pancakes, spreading what was probably too much marmalade on them, side-eyeing Potter.
“I don’t wanna talk about it again. We’ve been back and forth for twenty years, Harry. Twenty. You’ve got grey hair, my eyes and mouth are ploughed by wrinkles. It’s about time you resign to this.”
Tori hid her head in Ginny’s neck. “Yeah, I can understand. I was jealous of Harry too.” She shifted to make space for Ginny. She sat and clutched her hands.
Harry snorted, allowing himself to relax and slump against the back of the couch. Malfoy rested his head against the pillows, next to Harry’s knees and he was taken with the sudden urge to dig his fingers through Malfoy’s hair and massage his scalp.
“Sure, mate.” Seamus waved his beer to him in mock greeting and Harry stuck his tongue out at him. If his friends were going to keep on with this, well, two could play at that game.
Harry was still convinced Hermione and Geremia would find a solution, still wrote on ‘The Mighty Lions’ chat from time to time. Draco thought he was delusional; they were destined to be blocked forever.
Potter’s eyes sparkled and one side of his lips quirked up as his cheeks tinged red. "I was thinking… you seem to spend all your time closed in your lab. Why don't we go have a drink together tonight?"
we created it aren’t for you to know. We started to work on it ten years ago, as a Secret Project, but after a couple of years working on it, we understood we needed help from other people too — Aurors, Philosophers, Scientists. And now, we think we completed it. To be sure… we need to try it out and to get a final opinion from some external expert.”
That was new.
While walking toward the buffet, all the worst scenarios replayed in Draco’s head — from Potter refusing to shake his hand
Draco raised an eyebrow and proceeded to do the last checks on the turtle, using his hands as the final step to check the consistency of its shell. His movements felt stiffer and awkward with Potter there, the embarrassment of having to share silence with your former nemesis, then former friend, and finally former boyfriend, heavy in the air.
, to just beg for Malfoy to fuck him already.
“Tell me when it hurts.”
“Er,” he said, “maybe?”
Draco looked at Harry, internally begging him to say something, anything to avoid him opening his mouth instead. He wasn’t sure words would come out. Harry smiled at Astoria and turned his head towards Ginevra. “He is. We have something to tell you, girls.”
Harry pulled back just a fraction, his lips still brushing Draco's —
“Okay,” Harry said. Then, again, “Okay.”
Harry nodded distractedly, still shook by what they had learned. Malfoy crooked his head and hummed, reclaiming his attention.
done it. If he couldn’t have sex, then endless wanks would do.
“Potter, I—”
went as planned, just like with the spaghetti—
Before Draco could grasp that his magic had probably gone completely crazy, Potter burst through the door of the cubicle with a bewildered face and wand in hand. He was still facing backwards at the incriminated toilet when he turned and saw Draco. His face scrunched up more, his eyebrows drawing together, almost colliding, his wand pointing to Draco’s chest.
“What the fuck does that mean?”
“Your problem—” Malfoy had whispered that first night into Harry’s ear, right when he was starting to doubt his decision-making skills.
, and holding a turtle and— holding a turtle?
"Don't ask it as if we haven't spent the last twenty years together." Draco was always quick to retort, his witty replies as prickly and pointy as his own body.
Potter looked as if he’d drank the sweetest nectar, as if licking the glass had been the most natural thing in the world. He would occasionally stop to lick his own lips, little moans escaping him. Draco stared the entire time, transfixed.
“You remember the Dementors, right? Well, when they were near me I would always…
“Won’t ask you to do anything you don’t want to, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled as he mentally counted to ten in his mind, desperately trying to slow down his racing heartbeat.
Harry looked at him unimpressed — Malfoy's red cheeks told a different story than his words.
“Well, I mean, I consider it a victory that our wives are standing up for us. And I am not stupid! Don’t kill the moment, Harry!” Draco crossed his arms, faking offence.
The glare Potter shot him electrified Draco, but when his face morphed into a smug look Draco started to worry that he had gone too far. “You’re right. But you know what, I’ll just thank you instead. Come to think of it, the voice sounded an awful lot like yours…”
“I deeply dislike you,” was what Harry chose to tell Malfoy, out of the blue, at Ron and Malfoy’s graduation from Auror training.
Even after you’re finished, you find yourself feebly thrusting inside him; pathetic, honestly. But you can’t get enough of being inside Harry fucking Potter.
. Sometimes even more than once in a row. Oh, god.”
“Bloody hell, Malfoy, this is delicious!” Harry watched as Malfoy blushed bright red, not even trying to hide the satisfied grin that spread on his face at the praise.
“At least look me in the eyes when you say that, you don't sound like you believe it.”
“Drink, please. I knew you’d freak out.”
Harry looked at Ron as if he’d grown a third and fourth arm. “Really, Ron? It’s Malfoy!”
“Or me,” Ron concluded, one eyebrow raised. “We could ask the others, though, just to be sure.” He snorted, taking out his mobile.
Harry placed a pillow under Draco’s groin, lifting him up, watching amusedly as he muttered, “Mother? Father?” So, Harry had no idea what was going on in Draco’s dream right now, but whatever it was, he wanted nothing to do with it if his parents were there. But after a few minutes, Draco smiled, looking infinitely cute with his face resting on the pillow, his hair laying on it like a golden halo. He smiled and murmured, “Harry,” and again, “Harry.”
Harry turned to look at Draco, seeing him lose several shades of colours from his face, now whiter than ever. And only now realising something else...
“Malfoy, I…”
"We'll grab a taxi," Harry said, taking off the Invisibility Cloak and quickly folding it into his pockets.
Back in school his friends would talk about weddings with the perfect pureblood girls, kids, and a castle-like house with a big garden. Draco would listen to them, knowing he should say something along similar lines, but only able to think that he really wished he didn’t have to marry a girl. Girls were gross. If he had to choose between Blaise and Pansy, he would have chosen Blaise a thousand times.
Okay.
Draco couldn’t hold back the inelegant snort that escaped. Potter really liked to take their games far, didn’t he? Draco cleared his throat in a desperate attempt to hide the discomfort in his voice. “Then I’ll sacrifice a life of sex for a life full of magnificent food. I’m sorry, but that’s the most important thing.”
He’s talking to the barman, laughing, elbows on the counter, chin resting on his hands. Lips pursed, back arched, arse propped up: he looks straight out of a porn movie.
“Malfoy, what the hell are you doing here?”
“I’m reading,” he replied calmly, eyes glued to the book. “It’s a muggle book called
Malfoy raised an eyebrow to her but a knowing smirk was playing on his lips. “Let’s go, then,” he drawled out.
Ginny stopped right outside the door and twisted to look, nay,
The meaning of those words had finally clicked and Harry stopped, salt still trapped between his fingers. He had turned abruptly to Draco, now sitting relaxed at their kitchen table, smirk in place, fidgeting with the vial.
Malfoy stood up, knocking down the remaining liquor in his glass and putting it on the coffee table. He giggled as he started unbuttoning his shirt. “I knew it,” he said, still laughing softly. Harry’s cock leaked pre-cum as he watched him undress. Somehow he managed to be both sexy and funny and Harry found himself laughing on the couch, biting his lower lip with a hand on his cock the entire time.
“No one could ever make you fall apart like this, right love? Only me. You’re so hot, Harry, so hot. What else did we do, then?” His voice was starting to break, his movements incoherent and messy against Harry’s arse. He murmured the lube spell again and Harry heard him grasping his cock, the sound of his wet hand sliding up and down its length mixing with Malfoy’s gasps, making Harry crazy with want.
You know you don’t have any right to be angry, that you deserve all this and worse, but you are. Angry. Disappointed.
Panic wouldn't help him in an emergency situation like this, that was one of the few rules he learnt during his three months as an Auror that never left him.
Before Draco could mock Ron for being scolded, Hermione went on. “Draco, stop falling for Ron’s mockery. Dear Godric, it’s always the same with you two.”
"It works in a completely different way. When you open it, with the right spell, you decide the exact era you need to go to, and then the magical gears in it transport your body to the destination. When you set up the travel, you also decide how long you need to stay away, depending on what's your purpose."
"Is Hermione okay with this?"
swore.
I lay back down on my bed, sighing. I really don't want to open the gift from Harry, but at the same time I want to. It just makes it
Hermione and I start dancing around.
And then I hear this:
I thought this bathroom was abandoned. I would have decided to end it somewhere else if I had known that…
Suddenly, out of the blue, Harry slammed his fist down on the table. Ron nearly choked, and Hermione almost fell out of her seat.
we're out. They're hardcore drinkers, they are. And they're all drunk to hell and back. All of them are either passed out on the floor, puking on each other, are shagging right next to everybody, drinking mug after mug, or are talking wildly, and laughing their butts off."
My boyfriend will have to kill me.
mark, it won't disfigure it. I've tried. Too many times.
Not- not a word. O- okay? I- I need you to- to promise me, Pansy." I nod and say "You have a Slytherin's word, Dray." He nodded, and then pulled his hands away. He backed up a bit, and then his hand moved to his sleeve. I was confused, and then he pushed his sleeve up. I almost gasped, but I hardened my face. I didn't let a crack of emotion show. I heard a small gasp from Blaise, but nothing more. I wanted to ask lots of questions, but I was at a loss for words. My hand twitched at my side. I wanted to ask, to know
This is quite awkward.
“I... I told them you went back to your old prejudiced self...”
“So, how is it?” Angelina asked, and Harry realized that he had completely forgotten that she was there. He had forgotten everything other than the
When I turned 14, I filled out. My skinny, short, frame was filled up with wide hips, a nice round ass, and bigs boobs. Everything else stayed nice and tiny, and, to my delight, my waist was small.
With a last thought about the way Potter’s face had looked at peace and relaxed on his sofa the night before, Draco stepped into his fireplace, a pinch of Floo powder between his fingers. He hoped it would be a busy day at work.
Draco got up from the bed too, grabbed some clothes from the wardrobe, clutching them to his damp chest.
“Erm, I mean, yes, it’s true.”
He lapped at the furled skin with the flat of his tongue and Harry saw stars. He panted, “M-Malfoy, please, I beg you… s-suck—”
“Close your eyes,” Harry whispered, a finger trailing feather-light down Draco’s chest. Draco couldn’t do anything else other than comply. He closed his eyes, holding his breath.
On the third time he added his teeth; it was only a graze, quickly followed by his soothing tongue as he mercilessly lapped around Draco’s cock.
It shouldn’t have aroused Harry, but he had spent too long desiring Malfoy, dreaming about him, the bittersweet memories of this room were confusing him.
Draco turned and grabbed the handle of the door, lingering only a second before opening it and exiting without turning back.
Right. Malfoy had been sentenced to a year of exile in Muggle London after the war; Harry had never given it too much thought. With a sigh, he dropped his head on the table. “Malfoy, I’m sorry. It wasn’t fair of me to order you to reply, you shouldn’t… I’m sorry. I don’t realise it.”
They smiled at each other, and Harry felt the room getting warmer all of a sudden. He would have never imagined talking like this with Draco Malfoy, his school rival, former Death Eater, and possibly the most gorgeous man he'd ever met.
“Ginny, Tori, what were you thinking about?!,” Hermione managed to grit out through her laughter.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck! Malfoy! I need, damnit, I need...
Harry nodded, trying to remember when he said so, but coming up with only the memories of Malfoy’s lips on his ear, neck, Malfoy’s hard cock pressed against his, his body sliding on his, his low moans the only sounds Harry could recall.
Draco felt the tip of his ears growing hotter, a tingling sensation on his cheeks. “Damn, I was so embarrassed. Thank fuck you taught me at Hogwarts and not together with Astoria. I thought I’d given myself and my feelings away, but thankfully you’re a chronically oblivious idiot.”
She nodded, a little smile pulling at her lips. “Thanks, Harry. I can’t face this right now.” Harry nodded back; he was still trying to understand how the fuck would he behave differently to convey straightness. He was preparing the table when a loud bang made him drop a dish that shattered on the floor.
It’s in this atmosphere that they never lost one of the first traditions they had started from the very beginning of their friendship: to have dinner together with their wives every Friday, after Harry and Draco’s departure from Hogwarts. They would meet at the restaurant and reconcile before the weekend started and children and life would swallow them.
"Are you done?"
Right. That was true. So Harry tried to be brave and had made love to Ginny.
Draco broke the kiss, lightly brushing their noses together. “Do you remember when…”
travel.”
“I said, tell me to lie to you.”
“Yeah,” Harry muffles into his hands. “Just bits, fuzzy memories. Sensations, some thoughts, but I really can’t remember who the guy was.” He clears his throat, presses his fingers to his temples in a desperate attempt to make the pain go away. “I know his House, though.”
Potter had nodded, his hands already unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, fingers ripping the buttons apart. “I agree, no feelings. Just sex.”
Suddenly, all the memories linked to it rushed to Harry’s mind.
. In the ocean. Or worse, we’d end up stranded on a desert island filled with cannibals—”
“Rookies,” Harvey exhaled, voice mussed from sleep. “Always want the action. Ah, young man, when you’re in the field you’ll mourn these days.”
“I…” he hesitates, rubs his forehead on the pillow. “I want to do this looking at you today. Do we have time?”
It was all a show, an anticipatory show to finally get to see
“Fuck,” you gasp, because
“What was my name, again?” Potter slurred once they finished. Draco smiled, snorting.
mhmh.” Draco tried to wiggle his eyebrows suggestively, approaching Harry and sneaking an arm around his waist. He pulled him close, making their chests bump together.
Malfoy responded with abandon, attacking Harry’s mouth, nibbling at his lips, the scrape of his teeth sending jolts of pleasure through Harry’s body. Harry slid a hand up Malfoy’s spine, reaching his neck, then sank it into Malfoy’s hair— it was even silkier than it looked like.
Draco looked around his studio at the fireworks stacked on the desk, the wild amount of flowers dispersed all over the room, the two tickets for a Portkey to Paris, the spellbook open on ‘
With his heart racing, Harry finished washing away the soap and rushed to dry and redress himself before running to the bed to read Hermione's list.
"You want me to be turned on?"
“Fuck!” Draco cried out, fisting the blankets. He could already feel his hole fluttering under Harry’s tongue as Harry’s fingers spread Draco’s arse cheeks.
“Sorry, love. I always read it, but I must have missed the last one,” Draco said, trying to sound convincing. He loved Pansy, he really did, but he couldn’t care less about reading articles concerning the latest laws and arguments held at the Ministry of Magic. He only cared about one section of Pansy’s magazine, and he could easily get information about it when seeing her. If he were careful. Which this wine wasn’t helping him with. “What wine was this again?”
Malfoy wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and approached Harry again, his lips brushing Harry’s when he whispered, “Meet me in your bedroom in ten minutes.”
As soon as he stepped outside the pub, Draco had to brace himself against the wall in his disappointment. Potter wasn’t there. Draco must have misread the hints; Potter was likely still pissed at him. And he had a right to be, really. Draco had been so stupid.
“I’ll go. See you in three days.”
“Yes,” said Harry fervently. “All of that. And more.”
“It came with the house,” was Harry’s reply, voice slightly muffled with laziness.
He uncorked one bottle, sniffed it and let out a breathy moan. “Good stuff,
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but she held out a hand. “Don’t you dare say a single word, Potter! I am not listening to you. Telling us over dinner, in a restaurant where everyone knows us, like we were… like we were some kind of joke to you! You disgust me!”
Draco swallowed his pride, his sexual preferences, his very persona, and married Astoria. They'd been happy, and Scorpius was the light of Draco's life, but something never felt quite right.
"Wait, 'Mione," Harry said, reaching a hand to her shoulder and snatching it away as if he had touched fire.
Geremia's sneer widened and he all but gloated. "Then we'll do one more, longer this time. Hermione suggested for you to go back further in time, to New Year’s Eve. If you can confirm your story, we'll dig deeper into it."
Malfoy’s free hand fished out a tiny vial from the pocket of his trousers. “I, erm…This is Veritaserum. I took it from the game for… Well, you can use it on me, if you wish. Ask me whatever.”
Thanking all the powerful wizards in history that the mobile still had a few bars of battery power, Harry immediately swiped on Hermione’s notifications, aggressively plastered on the screen: ten missed calls.
“Of course. The great Harry Potter is also a certified Animagus. What do you transform into? A majestic lion?”
Their order arrived just mere minutes later; the waiters all knew Draco by now and regaled him with special attention. Of course, it wasn’t one of the reasons why Draco loved the restaurant— Draco wasn’t in such a desperate need for human attention. He
Harry nods. “Goyle, you said?”
Hermione inhaled sharply, looking slightly terrorised by her colleague, and cleared her throat.
“You’ve been staring into nothingness for the whole night like an idiot! It’s your turn again.” Ron wiggled his eyebrows, pointing at the bottle which was indeed turned toward Harry.
A pen flew through the air and smacked into Draco’s forehead.
If it wasn’t Potter’s doing — and at this point, it really didn’t seem to be — these weird events looked a lot like wild magic. But wasn’t that a thing that happened only to very young witches and wizards? And surely, it couldn’t be Draco’s magic, because—
"Well, that's simply… luck. Now, we have more important matters to discuss."
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. “Bastard,” he hissed, and a second later he was jumping up and down like a damn rabbit. Harry laughed despite himself.
Draco exchanged an amused glance with one of the waiters, trying to fight a smile. “Well, honestly, no. But this fucking Manor is so big that I wouldn’t be surprised if they find a dragon in the basements.”
Harry woke to the rays of sunshine warming his face and a distinct feeling of discomfort in the pit of his stomach. His mouth tasted like a troll had pissed in it and he winced at his own breath.
Apparently, everything. Everything could go wrong.
Harry closed his eyes, caressed Draco’s hips, said, “I want to kiss you.”
Draco could practically feel the exclamation points at the end of every word and chuckled into his glass of Pinot Noir.
Draco swallowed around his dry mouth and shifted on his chair, hoping no one would notice him. That damn, absolutely abnormal, thing was having a weird effect on Draco.
"Malfoy?!"
“What? No, you git! I’m a wandmaker! Gosh, you really have lived in isolation, mh? I just have an eye for wood now. And cherry wood is a really interesting one. Did you know that for its property, it is particularly indicated for unyielding wands? And it carries music so well that in special circumstances you can… well, did you ever notice that sometimes with the wind it echoes it musically?” Potter’s eyes were glowing with the excitement of talking about wood with someone and Draco couldn’t find it in himself to make fun of him. Fuck, what was wrong with him today?
They started chatting about this and that while ordering their dinner, and Draco was indeed happy to see that Astoria and Ginevra had already started to drink wine. He poured a generous amount for himself and Harry too, and took a great gulp almost immediately.
“Oh.” Now Harry understood why Ron said anyone else would have taken advantage of the situation. “You like it.”
“What’s the matter, he asks!” Draco cried in a dramatic tone that made Boo-boo snort and Harry smile amused.
Draco chuckled, hooking his arms around Harry’s waist and landing a light kiss on his lips. “Poor Potter… can’t even get into a hobby without making the front page.”
“Fine, fine! Damn, don’t tell me the story of your life in five minutes, Potter, breathe."
Potter’s hands roamed lower still, tracing over the waistband of Draco’s joggers as Draco’s muscles quivered under Potter’s touch.
“Potter, wait!”
And yet…
She widened her eyes and crossed her arms. “I don’t care! I just! Well, try to be straight for one more brunch, okay?” She turned to go away, but Harry called out to her.
“What the fuck…”
"I…" Draco started, a lump in his throat. Whatever he would say, however he would act cold and distant, he knew he had fallen in love with the git. "Lucius wrote me a letter."
“Draco, wait!”
His head was throbbing, and he could feel an annoying itch throughout his entire body, probably due to being tied up for who knows how long and… doing who knows what.
Draco schooled his tone to be the sweetest and clearest possible when he said, “Oh, honey, didn’t I tell you Ron and I have a secret romance?”
"Not now!" Harry motioned for him to follow them out of the house, to the street.
Harry slipped out of him, wanting to carry on the game just a little more. He brushed Draco’s arsecheeks, massaged his back. Murmuring under his breath he cleaned them up and dressed Draco, only wearing pants for himself.
Harry snickered, awkwardly climbing off the bed and stretching, finally feeling good about standing, eating and talking with people.
Everywhere he looked there were lush bushes of flowers and trees of every kind — Draco had told him his favourites were the orchids and the peach trees that were currently flowering so that the ground all around them was a stunning big pink carpet.
“I am sure you can articulate something even with your little Gryffindor brain,” Draco snarled, his hot breath tickling Harry’s collarbone.
are perfect.” He inhaled slowly. “Yes,
and then this—”
When they arrived home, Draco took off his coat and shoes and smiled at Harry. “It was a weird lunch, but I feel so lucky, love.” He cupped his face and kissed Harry, who readily wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pushing him closer.
“I’m 99.9% sure, yes. Oh, Herm, what the heck happened?”
. It was only eight in the morning and he was already tired from all the thoughts and images of Potter that kept sweeping through his mind.
“And their rings.”
Harry’s mouth hung stupidly. The sight was more than he could bear. Malfoy, on his knees, at Harry’s feet,
Harry looked between Hermione and Malfoy, stretching his hand, finally not feeling it burn anymore.
But the sight that really stole Harry’s breath away was Draco crouched in front of the wider wall, a brush in his hand, completely splashed with paint, a concentrated frown on his face.
“Oh c’mon, let us see!” Hermione was always the most curious and excited when there was something to discover.
As Malfoy proceeded to drag his cock out centimetre by centimetre stopping when only the tip was inside, he stilled, perfectly composed, to say, “So you know how torturous that felt to me.”
“The things I’d do to you, Potter,” Malfoy murmured. He was so close his breath ghosted over Harry’s cheek, making him tremble. A shiver ran down Harry’s spine and he found breathing difficult all of a sudden.
Ginny raised her head. “I’m asking myself who has
An acrid smell hit Draco’s nostrils and he hurried to turn off the heat as black smoke started to fill his kitchen. He sighed, looking grimly at his burnt dinner.
She burst out laughing, waving a hand at him. “Oh, forgive me, Harry. Ron’s been away on a mission for three weeks now. It's been so long I've got cobwebs.”
He pushed his cock just a fraction more into Potter’s mouth, grazing the back of his throat, making him gag. He’d be worried if this was the first time they were doing this, but by now Draco knew for a fact that Potter loved having Draco’s cock throat-deep in his mouth just as much as he did bollocks-deep in his arse.
Draco swallowed around his parched throat. The words barely made it past his lips.
The temptation to reply and make Malfoy’s rant start all over again was suddenly so strong Harry had some difficulty masking his snort.
“Meet the Greengrasses, dear,” your mother says. Her eyes are puffy and streaked with blood. You’re sincerely scared.
The room they had just entered was empty but for a tall man in a blue suit, bent over a desk — goggles and ear protections in place — who hadn't noticed them arriving.
Draco took a deep breath, deeply inhaling the ocean smell, closing his eyes and letting the gentle lap of the waves guide him to Potter.
One day you’ll understand how he can always find you.
“Err, I actually transform into a white wolf.” Harry took a deep breath, tilting his head to the moonlight and closing his eyes. It was reassuring, calling gently to him as it always did since he transformed the first time.
Harry looked at her retreating form, mixed feelings confusing him. He turned his face to Malfoy, exhaling, “Now what?”
as Moody always used to say, was still the first survival trick they taught you.
And then, the day travelling by the hot air balloon Draco now knew how to conjure, the picnic at high altitude, with Harry’s favourite wine. Landing on the top of the
“I’m going to tie you up,” Malfoy said as he opened his eyes. He
He sighed as he took in the amount of sand that covered the floor and every surface of his workplace; that had been another hard thing of Mexico — sand was
“There’s something I should tell you,” Harry said to his glass.
Hermione mouthed ‘good luck’ before setting the Time Machine to New Year’s Eve. Harry smiled at her. He knew he could trust her.
,” he then barked, effectively making goosebumps burst across Harry’s skin.
After discovering that Harry could bear very short and soft touches, they’d started to do it more often, almost kissing, brief grazing of lips on foreheads, hands light on hands.
Little she knew of what was to come.
Ten months in, Harry and Draco had adopted Boo-boo. Not literally, but the feeling of familial affection came naturally.
Thoughts of long lost times, years ago. Draco had just turned eighteen and the repeated seventh year at Hogwarts was coming to an end.
France had definitely been the best period Harry and Draco had spent during their time-travelling.
Harry looks at his friends as a new wave of nausea hits him. “Give me a Sober Up potion, please, guys.”
“Ma wife here, says I need air. Oh, Malf-oy, happy birthday!” Ronald patted a hand on Draco’s shoulder, swinging forward and Draco had to catch him before he toppled on him.
"You are, you moron. Just sit down. I reckon we still have two or three hours to spend here; we arrived around 9 pm and now it's dawn, more or less... Relax and get comfortable. Some sleep won't hurt you, either."
“Mother, what’s this travesty?”
Malfoy sagged against him, sighing tiredly, resting his forehead on the back of Harry’s neck, mouthing clumsily at it. He pulled out his cock, tugged to make Harry face him again, cleaned them both with a silent spell. He was smiling, that unguarded curve of his lips that Harry had craved to see again for too long now.
Draco took a moment to look at the pink glittery banner saying, "Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy Wedding" hanging from the wedding arch behind Harry, and found himself laughing. Finally, they could scream at the entire world who they truly are. He flicked his eyes down again and met Harry's, those breathtaking green eyes. A warm smile spread on their faces and Draco’s heart swelled in his chest.
Veritaserum. It’s a new formula I’m trying for the Ministry: it runs longer, and it’s more accurate, so your lot can give better interrogations and—” Malfoy’s eyes widened before he took a deep breath and tightened his lips.
In a couple of steps, Draco reached him and took off his shoes too, advancing enough to be ankle-deep in the ocean.
A heavy silence enveloped them, holding the implications of what she said clear between them. Astoria went on, “I love Draco. I do, even if… things weren’t wonderful, even if sex… wasn’t our greatest strength. But I love him, Gin. How do you recover from something like this at sixty years old?”
Draco locked eyes with Harry and smirked. He took his cock in his mouth again and sighed contentedly when Harry came, splashing his throat with sweet semen.
Harry blinked. “No? Why are you reading out loud?”
Immediately, Malfoy’s lips parted as another of those soft sighs escaped him. With a jolt of his stomach, Harry realised he had just given another order to Malfoy.
Ginny approached her and stole her bowl of ice cream. She looked inside of it and frowned at the amount of liquid she saw in it. Melted ice cream didn’t look like that. “What the fuck is in here? A calming potion? Drug?” She dipped a finger in it and licked it. “Tori! This almost intoxicated me and you’ve been eating it for the last half hour! This ice cream is drowned in whisky!”
but it might work!"
And yet, after he’d seen Potter’s dedication to the task —how Potter moaned and licked Draco’s spunk until the last drop— Draco knew he could never do without it again. Snapping out of his memories, Draco extended his hand to Potter who promptly lifted his head and met Draco half-way, slipping out his tongue and licking Draco’s fingers in earnest. It should have surprised Draco how Potter’s tongue felt smooth against his fingers, so delicate compared to the rough sucking of his mouth, but it only made sense; Potter licked and sucked Draco’s fingers in the same manner as he did with his cock
He turned, grabbed the handle of the door, opening it and entering the room. He wasn’t ready for the pang of nostalgia that hit his stomach, thousands of images filling his vision.
Potter had turned, a pan in his hand, with what looked like pancakes still frying in it. Draco felt his cheeks growing hot under Potter’s steady gaze and his brilliant smile.
She’d help him get up, put him under the shower, called a Healer. Draco refused to get any kind of treatment but in the end, they’d found a compromise. The Healer created two little identical pendants, one for Pansy, one for Draco. They’d have to wear it every day, every moment, every place. Inside them, a swirl of energy, of their united magical cores, connecting them. Whenever Draco was in danger —or felt like he was— Pansy’s pendant would warm, warning her. It worked both ways, to give Draco the impression he could be helpful too, but it was actually only Pansy supporting him.
“Guys,” Hermione’s voice interrupted his rant, “stop arguing about who knows Harry better. Ron, stop ruining Draco’s plans; they’re perfect.”
“Confunded you, I know,” Draco interrupts and now he’s biting on his lips so hard Harry fears they’re gonna break.
“But I decided I don’t care. You do it, sometimes. Disappear...take your time. Are you okay now?”
If he wasn’t sure of this decision, the happiness reflected in Malfoy’s eyes did the trick.
“Hey, what about we go to Hyde P—”
Again, Harry felt his gut wrench when he suddenly appeared in a dark alley with Malfoy. They looked around in confusion for a few minutes, walking up the alley, under the Invisibility Cloak, until they saw the outline of St. Mungo’s.
There had been one — was it… Jared? Jacob? Whatever — very insistent, but Harry had been able to brush him off. Right?
“I know shit!” Harry snapped before he could think differently. Damn, he was an Auror, he should know better than snapping at a bit of Veritaserum in his blood. Except this wasn’t
“Huh.” Hermione reached for the bread at the centre of their table. “Gosh, I love this restaurant.” She smiled, crooking her head. “Harry, darling, is there anything that happens before you feel like this that could be triggering it?”
It was painfully obvious to Harry right at that moment, with a disheveled Malfoy in front of his eyes, shirt wrinkled where Nott’s hands had wandered, hair soft around his pointed face, that he ached for Malfoy. He ached to touch him, to take him, to make him moan harder than he had with Nott.
and when the lights went on, Astoria’s hand was clenched around her wand, pointed at him, her eyes bloodshot and shimmering with anger. “Do you know how much I want to hurt you, Draco? How much I want to scream, to tell you that you’re a monster, you should leave and go to hell? But — ” She lowered her wand, running a hand through her hair. “I won’t. Because I love you. Because all I can think about is — you’ve known Harry for a lifetime. A lifetime. You work together. You see each other every bloody day. And, do you wanna fucking know what it is that I am really thinking right now?”
“I see you’re still here. Came back for me?”
"Oh yes, he's sick, sickly in love with the gorgeous Draco Malfoy. Wanted a piece of me for yourself, didn't you,
On the way to his flat, Draco passed a magical newsstand and eyed Pansy’s magazine. The cover read ‘Is Your Neighbour Really Trying to Grow Muggle Weed?’. Really, Pansy should have known better than to hire Luna Lovegood as the editor of the Botanical and Magical Creatures section.
Just as Draco was about to burst out again, the portrait resumed:
Without too much preamble, Draco pushed Potter down on the sofa. He raked his hands under Potter’s t-shirt, touching his bare chest and stomach while grazing his teeth over Potter’s jutting collarbone. Right when Potter lifted his hips to rut against Draco, Draco grabbed them and turned Potter around, until his face was pressed up against the cushion.
His fears forgotten, Harry lubed his cock and lined up with Draco’s rim, stilling to observe him. His eyes were still closed, his breathing only slightly altered. Holding his breath, Harry delicately pushed in, only as much as to push the head past the tight furled rim, totally incapacitated to restrain from groaning.
Then, more recent memories. Malfoy in his Potions laboratory, goggles tight on his forehead; long, silky hair dishevelled where the band fit against the back of his head; red circles around his eyes. Icy, stormy, brilliant eyes. Rolled up sleeves, the golden hairs of his arms exposed, flasks all around him, pearly beads of perspiration above his lip, his neck, his collarbones.
Sagging against him, you think you’ve never appreciated hugs so much. After what feels like an eternity, Potter kisses your temple. “Don’t. If you don’t want to, don’t get married. Come stay at my place with me.”
.” He burst in peals of laughter, sending what Harry suspected was a voice message.
The first two months after the N.E.W.T.s are a blurred hell for you.
Hermione turned to face Harry and Malfoy with a serious expression. "Okay, listen. This is the
It was almost 5 pm. He flicked his eyes down again, looking out through the doors. A little crowd of people was advancing toward them, walking slowly through the garden, stopping here and there to admire an azalea or smile at a curious peacock.
Everything seemed to stop at once, Draco’s heart, everyone’s breathing, the ticking of the clocks. Hermione Granger had just offered a mind-boggling amount of money to obtain a property where she most certainly couldn’t have any good memories. What the fuck?
Tori.”
Draco’s entire body was thrumming with the excitement of having Harry for himself, finally, of being free to tell him these kinds of things, of being free to think he’s handsome when he smiles, speaks or even only breathes. But they still had to be careful in public. “Do you want to grab something at the pub? I want to know everything.”
Pansy shook her head. “It’s okay… Draco, I need to ask you something, but you have to promise me you won’t freak out.”
faded into the background, as a distant memory, as a blurred buzz of a bee outside, as if… as if it wasn’t there at all.
"I know you're there, Harry, you never fooled me with that Cloak. So?"
at me, instead of talking to me, why you fucking went away even after I offered my help at the infirmary, why you—”
James regarded Harry furiously, narrowing his eyes at him. “Scorpius called us this morning. He told us very interesting news, Dad.” He spat that ‘dad’ as if it was the worst word in the dictionary. Albus was nodding next to him, but he looked less angry and more curious.
No, Malfoy was up to something, and Harry would be the one to unveil the truth.
What did that even mean?
“I have a grey hair! I’m
They exited the room, approaching the veranda of the beach house. Harry and he had searched for the right place for months but they eventually agreed that their beach house was the right one, full of good memories and witness of their growing love.
Without another word, Draco turned and walked to the bathroom in their room.
Ron raised an eyebrow and smirked. “I know Harry better than you and he doesn’t like big gestures for his birthday.”
A breeze passed again, cooling Draco’s nerves, shifting the hair at the nape of his neck. He closed his eyes, shivering slightly. Inhaled once, twice. “Okay, okay. I know I can do this.”
“But, my Allure, er, isn’t…” Harry’s heart tripped violently against his ribcage. It all felt so unreal.
Harry could understand his arguments, he really could, but the temptation to row with Malfoy was too strong.
Harry groaned. His green eyes sparkled as he smiled softly.
“Ron didn’t, Draco. I felt it when you spoke to me about him. And I know you felt it too.”
“Fucking hell.” Draco felt dizzy all over again. He turned in Harry’s arms, bringing his hands to Harry’s face; to Harry’s chest, to his head, saying, “Are you okay? Are you hurt? Are your ears hurt? Are you—”
“Where have you been?” Draco snapped, getting out of bed and casting a perfect drying charm on Harry. Harry sighed, choking out, “I want to hug you.”
He witnesses the scene from a few feet apart: Draco’s cheeks are bright red and the tendons in his throat are tight. He looks furious.
Thick tears started running down Draco’s face, covered by his hands, fingers pressed against his eyeballs. His chest was heaving, his throat constricting and he knew, he knew he’d die if—
Draco clenched his jaw. Of course Potter didn’t know a thing about him, and why should he. Draco was only the most famous magi-zoologist of their century.
?" The hot man in a tight blue swimwear asked Draco, flashing him a bright smile. "I could show you the
As soon as the Patronuses released their message, they disappeared. Draco turned to Harry. “Oh man, do you think it’s a good thing? The two of them, alone, there?”
“Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,” Ron interrupted their bantering, holding up a hand to obtain their attention. “Are you suggesting… that this
It was almost midnight, around ten beers later when Dean looked at Harry smirking, all but purring, “So, Harry, did I hear correctly, you’re
Draco opened his eyes, scowling.
“Oh, c’mon, just tell us!”
“So, no one wins the bet? Tough luck,” Seamus comments, rolling his eyes. “You didn’t lose your virginity the first week back here—” he goes on. And dear Godric, how Harry would love for him to just. Stop. Talking. “—and you didn’t wait for the right guy.”
it, dreaming about it, but murmuring freely, without control, to Harry.
Draco was fucking Harry with his fingers now, blowing him off at the same time. Harry was close, he knew it. He learned the signs of Harry’s orgasm well before that day. He dropped Harry’s cock, eliciting a scandalised cry from him and gave a lick at Harry’s balls, whispering, “Fuck, Harry, do you remember that time… oh, I miss our twenties, we came only from talking about what we would have liked to do to each other…”
The words Pansy said earlier echoed in Draco’s mind. “A handshake?” But… Could he, really? Just go up to him, after all these years, after never thanking Potter for testifying for him, and… shake his hand? He took another sip of his wine, a deep breath, and got up, excusing himself from the table.
Malfoy's breath kept blowing on his ear and neck, his usually faint citrus scent now lingering heavily all around Harry, making his ability to concentrate shatter. He was wearing his black fitted uniform, as if it was of any use in a situation like this, and Harry found himself tripping over his own feet more than once.
? He's won the 'best smile' prize for 2005. I mean, who do they think he is, Lockhart?"
Harry stopped in his tracks, mesmerised by the view of Malfoy's arse in the air, his long legs stretched out and his head between his arms on the ground. A yelp escaped his lips when his cock filled in for the second time that morning.
“Any news?” Harry asked, hoping to change the subject.
"Your observational skills will never cease to amaze me, Harry."
Malfoy entered some time later, interrupting Harry’s stream of conscience. “I didn’t know what you like most in the morning— or, well, if I had to go with our Hogwarts years, I’d prepare treacle tarts and pumpkin juice but there wasn’t time, so…”
Malfoy huffed in annoyance, starting to move away, Boo-boo following him with a little flip in the air.
They had entered a McDonald’s and he’d slowly approached the counter, undulating his hips, snarling, “Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly—”
But he says your name and you drop to your knees.
Cocking one eyebrow, Blaise held out a hand to shake Draco’s and patted him on the shoulder. “Wanker. How are you, mate? Fuck, when I saw the gates of the Manor open I had a mini-stroke. I didn’t know they did that anymore!”
“Yes,
Draco wrinkled his brow, confusion fluttering through his brain. The first thing Draco thought was that Harry could cook Sweet Prophecies’ dishes because he was the actual chef, but that was ridiculous. And yet, the more he thought about it, the more…
“I— yes. I’d love that.”
Harry grabbed the edge of the desk, his knuckles turning white, his stomach whirling in an unpleasant way.
Hermione inhaled slowly, nodded and slumped back on her chair.
“‘m tired,” Harry mumbled, chin propped on his hand as he chewed on scrambled eggs. “Give me some orange juice.”
Draco was hot for him, even in his sleep.
“Oh, shush. Listen, Ron, you don’t need to do anything. Salazar help me, for reasons completely unfathomable to me, Pansy is already impressed by you. Just ask her out. And maybe help her with her polls.”
“First off, come down, breakfast’s ready. Second, it’s day 681 and we’re still fucking. Or maybe more?”
Potter pouted and batted his long eyelashes, something Draco really had never been good at resisting. He rolled his eyes and mumbled, “Well, I guess you could if—”
Harry whined at the loss of Draco’s grip on his cock and pushed it against his thigh, voice amused. “It’s not me! I thought it was you, actually. C’mon Draco, I don’t want to wait any—”
Draco’s voice trailed off, before taking a deep breath that burnt his lungs. “I’m not good with my feelings. I needed a way out.”
“What kind of a question is that?! Of course, I do!”
“Are you into doors, Potter?” Draco smirked; this was known territory, the bantering.
Potter seemed to snap out of the moment at the mention of the turtle and his cheeks quickly tinged a blotched red.
, but they had discussed the option — Draco gave him his permission, he said he really wanted to be penetrated while asleep.
Ten minutes later, Hermione, Ron and Harry were sitting in a bar close to the hotel, ordering breakfast together.
Ugh. Everything that had happened the night before came back to Harry’s mind in blurred fragments and he curled in on himself, burying his face in the pillow.
Hermione’s eyes were comically wide. “Then the news mustn’t have reached me, Harry.”
Draco nodded, feeling Potter’s stubble scratching against his chin, his curls tickling his cheek. “Well, then, Harry. I probably owe you an explanation.” He cleared his throat as Harry moved his head to look at Draco again.
“Sure you can, mate. And I promise you, everyone will love what you did, it’s wonderful here tonight. Just smile at everyone and I am sure you’ll be fine.” Blaise briefly patted his shoulder.
His step-aunt snorted, shaking her head lightly. “Don’t you think he looks cute with this platinum blond?”
Draco gasped and put a hand on his chest, trying to sound outraged. “And here I was, thinking I was fucking with the Saviour of us all!”
“When did it happen?” Draco gritted out, spitting every word with as much venom as he could muster.
"I wanted to kiss you and kiss away your sadness, Harry. That's why I went to the bathroom… we—"
They classified the
The title read
a kink of yours!” He raised an eyebrow to Harry, stretching out his legs, wiggling his toes.
Hell, who was Draco kidding? He missed the git.
“I can’t believe this! I can have it all! Delicious food, extraordinary sex, and love? That’s the dream!”
Harry shook his head. “Of course not, you prat. It’s against any consensual activity.”
“Have you seen Potter?” Malfoy’s voice sounded strained. Harry could picture Kreacher’s face scrunching up in displeasure.
checking — as Tori would teasingly say — articles about Potter, about his marriage with Ginevra, his three kids and then his divorce. His promotion to Britain’s First Magical Representative of International Cooperation.
“Are you saying…” Harry couldn’t even bring himself to say the words.
“You’re a wanker,” Malfoy said. He crossed his arms, looking very cross and too cute for his own good. “It felt just the same.”
“I—” Draco took a deep breath, trying to control himself. “Harry, slow down, I’m c-close.”
It hadn’t been a good night. Harry and Malfoy stayed up late, talking about everything that might have happened.
“I… don’t know what to say. E-everything I feel is so en-enhanced…”
The air finally cleared and Harry took in a big gulp of air, opening his eyes and only then realising he had closed them. Malfoy’s achingly beautiful face came into focus and Harry couldn’t possibly contain the grin that spread on his face.
“I guess that explains things,” Harry mused, deaf to whatever conversation Ron and Hermione were involved in.
They sat in silence until Malfoy finished his cigarette and started laughing instead. “By Merlin, what the hell was that, Potter? At the valley?”
“Listen to me—” Malfoy said, and he sounded so broken Harry wanted to turn and hug him right there. “Yes, I wanted it, but only because— the Allure.” He sounded uncertain, even to Harry, who rarely noticed anything.
Blaise chuckled. “Not what I asked, but—” Pansy was sitting on the other side of Draco and leaned in too, probably feeling cut off from the conversation. “What are you two whispering about?!”
He shrugs. “Both.” He sits next to you, takes out the liquid lipstick from the bag. “Here, let me…” he whispers as he grasps your face. “Part your lips.”
Hermione burst out laughing, shaking her head, tears already stuck in her eyelashes. “Finally admitting your one and only true love, Harry?”
Surely, it wasn’t like Draco had been too distracted by Potter to understand what happened. He hadn’t been thinking about the way Potter’s back felt against his chest, hot and slick as Draco fucked him into the sofa. Draco’s cock stretched in his uniform and he narrowed his eyes at the door as if daring it to contradict him.
After lunch, they went back to the Unspeakables laboratories with Hermione and Geremia to try and solve the problem with the Time Machine. Geremia still had his sceptic attitude, rejecting every possible explanation Hermione tried to come up with, until Draco rummaged in the pockets of his jeans and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. He looked over to Harry, calling him close to him, landing a soft kiss on his cheek.
His best friends burst out laughing, Hermione barely breathing when she choked out her, "Oh, Harry."
Hermione raised a sceptical brow but nodded. “You’re smarter than this, Draco,” she added before going back to her papers.
Opening the door of the restaurant, Draco stepped inside, a puddle of water already forming at his feet. The waitress, Sarah, laughed, shaking her head. Everyone here knew him by now.
Involuntarily, Draco smiled, thinking of how naïve Potter could be. Florence had a similar smile on her face when she replied. “Harry, I had the immense privilege and bad luck to be born into a pure-blood family. Rules were even stricter during my times and I was forced into a loveless heterosexual marriage. We never had children, nor touched each other, it was only for appearance, you see? I was the shame of the family, being lesbian and oh-so-liberal. I only hope Draco here won’t repeat my same mistakes.”
I need to cover my mark.
And it'll kill me.
I swear on my life I would die to be a normal kid who gets normal things and has a normal family that doesn't roll around in gold and they aren't worried about table manners and parties, but playing Quidditch in the backyard and doing housework.
I felt shock, and then anger.
And in smaller letters at the bottom, it said:
”I’m sorry too, Pans.”
"Oh, fuckkkkkk." I said, moaning.
He started to feel completely numb again. Just numb. And like the sky was on his shoulders. He just felt down, depressed, done…
I will
ALSO, if anyone would do fan art for this, I would be SO, SO, SO, HAPPY! Like idc if it’s like two year old scribbles, anything would be amazing! Just send me the link if u do! PLEASE? I’d love you forever!
"Hi, I need to see Dr. Johnson as soon as possible." Harry said, with a blinding smile. The girl's face fell, obviously she thought that he was mated to Ang.
Ron was thinking about how if Harry wanted to hurt the twitchy little ferret, he wouldn't be able to stop him. No one could. He might even die...
“PANSY! Calm down! I tried, and you always do things a thousand times better than I do. So don’t worry about it. You can just talk to Draco in a bit, sort things out, calm things down. You’re much better and the feelings rubbish than I am.”
I thought that we were done with them!"
not-”
I nod quickly.
"You're- you're not yelling. Was it, 'Okay, it's fine and I'm supportive of you', or was it, 'Okay, I'm leaving this room as soon as I regain full use of my limbs and don't ever talk to me again'?
I find what I'm looking for eventually. I rip open the letter on the top open violently, and I watch as the letter falls to the floor. I stare at it, recognizing Harry's handwriting quickly. I think I know it better than my own. My hand darts down to grab it, and I read it quickly.
Blaise and I read it at the exact same time.
I let the water wash away all of my problems.
I don't want to break him. Or me. Or lose him.
Ron and I were taken aback.
but I try and not let it show. I knew Pansy shagged people regularly, and I'm fairly sure that she's shagged almost every male at this school that's 4th year and up, but I didn't know that she could walk up to anyone and say,
He dismissed the thought and tried to sit up, letting out a small whimper at the pain in his head, and then he screeched “Dammit!” when he shifted something in his ribs and it caused a hot, sharp pain to run through him with a vengeance. He cradled his wrist against his chest, and then started to crawl.
been a lot of stress, being ‘The Chosen One’ and all, but yet, Harry missed it. He missed hanging out by the lake with all of his friends, talking about small things like there wasn’t a war going on.
“Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, a smile on her face. “You must be stressed right now.”
I miss Harry.
happy with this one, I’m sure of it.”
“So, wandless magic is complex, and hard, and apparently it’s tiring to do, so that’s why most wizards prefer to just use their wands. But, the thing is, wandless magic is more powerful. Almost like a force of nature… Anyway, let’s say you were to cast a healing charm. If you were to place your hands on the person that you were healing, per say, and cast the charm, it would be much more powerful. It’d heal the person much more effectively, for one, but would also heal them much quicker. It’s quite a gift, Harry. Anyway, it’s quite taxing, and most wizards or witches pass out after casting powerful spells the first few times. That’s why it’s better to practice. It’s like working out, the more you practice, the stronger you become. And when you use it, it’s like flexing a muscle. So, again, I think that you should practice.”
Thank you,
My though is cut off by the cold voice. "It is an

Ron and I smiled, and then Ron said, “You are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?” Hermione’s brows furrowed, and then Ron laughed. “That’s the most brilliant idea you’ve had yet, Hermione.”
*cough*) So Harry would go back to (seemingly) hating him. If that's what Draco wanted. Harry loved him too much to hurt him. He wouldn't go running after Draco, drooling. Maybe he would get a girlfriend, just to prove that he was over Draco. Yeah, he would maybe do that. He could go back to the glares in the halls, the mean words, (After all, they were just
"Did you break up with her?"
He gave me a small nod, and I kissed his forehead. I headed out of the room, (Still strutting like I wasn’t dead tired...) marching straight towards my bathroom.
I laugh, and then hug her.
I felt horrible, and I moved to give him a hug, and he slapped my hand away. “WHAT THE FUCK, DRACO?!” I screamed, jumping off the bed.
Blaise’s smirk is wiped from his face, and he backs up and turns to me.
I find it in me to listen to Hermione and Harry. This is going to be the last few things I hear, and this might be better than dying in silence. Harry’s trying to save me. To bring me back. Even if he’s just doing it because of his savior complex, he’s still trying. He’s doing everything he can.
Anyways, enjoy, it might take me a bit to get back into the swing of writing, so please bear with me :)
My head hurt, and all the noise in the Great Hall was doing nothing to make it better.
Hey guys, I really just wanted to apologize for how sad the last chapter was, and if I did something to fuck you up I’m really sorry. So, on that note, this chapter is much happier. I specially want to apologize to aexthetic_luv, please feel better soon! Hope this chapter cheers you up, cuz this chapter made me go ‘I REALLY NEED THE FUCKING SUNSHINE IN THIS FIC’, so, enjoy!
I don't think that I'll ever be warm again.
Harry missed Hogwarts so much. It
It hurt just a bit to crawl around on the stone floor, if you could even call it a crawl. It was more dragging himself around.  He couldn’t stand the sharp flashes that he was getting every few seconds, so he cast a temporary pain relief spell.
Draco had not said a word. The tears were going to break free any second. Later, where no one else could see, the sobs were going to shake his body. His emotions would be a hurricane. The pain, the depression, the numbness, the anger...
"We should go... the train is leaving soon." I jutted out my lower lip and pouted shamelessly, and Harry smirked. He detached himself from me, and I crossed my arms. His smirk widened, and he leaned in and gave me what was meant to be a short kiss. My hands immediately went to his hair, rooting him to the spot. I pushed my tongue into his mouth, and pulled his body onto mine. Harry lost himself in the kiss, but eventually had the sense to pull away. "Come on, Draco. We have to go. You'll miss the train."
(See the end of the chapter for
When Draco got up there, he couldn't believe his eyes. He was standing in a dusty room, the artificial light flooding his senses, holey white sheets covering the windows, and boxes scattered all over. But the appearance of the room was not what he was thinking about. It was the teens.
Ron and I pulled Harry out of the Hall quickly, dragging him through the halls and up and down staircases. Ron was supporting almost all of Harry's weight. He was pale, and his face was contorted into one of his famous expressions.
I watch as Hermione grabs Ron’s hand.
"Yeah, we talked about it a long time ago. I wanted to shag a lot more often than her, and so she said it was okay for me to shag people, as long as I didn't get in a relationship with them."
My sweet sœur! Poison?
I don’t pick up on the next part.
he though to himself.
I think I see Draco move his arm a bit, but before I can make more of it, Ron taps on my shoulder. “What should I do, ‘Mione?”
I'm numb inside.
Blaise shakes his head again, and then says, “No, it won’t. At least probably not. Have you met Harry? He’ll get past it. Eventually. It’s more
"'Mione... What are we going to do?"
"What happened? What happened to my sweet sœur?" I said quickly, wanting an answer as quickly as possible.
I can do wandless magic.
And one more thing. I‘m convinced that the voice in his head is Hermione. So, yeah.
“That’s okay, Harry, most people don’t get it on their first try. Let’s try again, shall we?”
I wipe my forehead, and let out a breath loudly.
life every once in a while!"
Ronald!” Ron stood up, and they ran out of the hall after him, watching as he turned the corner.
“Thanks, Luna, but I don’t even know if they’ll be compatible with me-”
Pansy gave me one last squeeze, and then stepped back.
a small voice said in the back of my head.
Pansy
“But she- I-”
My Aunt goes as far to say "This is of the
I don't want to break him. Or me. (Because I'll be the one that suffers the most from this, obviously.)
I give another nod, and she sets a quill on the table.
I'm numb inside.
He's going to kill me.

Draco started talking quickly. "-I didn't have a choice Pansy! I was forced. He was at my house and so were a ton of other Death Eaters and would have died if I hadn't done this but I should have died instead of this- and, wait. Pansy? What did you say?"
Draco!
"Pans! I am
The Headmaster cleared his throat, and I looked up at him. "Your sister-"
I stop for a moment. I knew this would upset him.
I fall asleep to these thoughts.
He scanned the rest of the room, looking for the familiar colors.
hopeless. I can't even make a dramatic exit without grabbing my boyfriend. I'm so needy. We eventually made it to the train station in Hogsmeade. It was filled with students, all chatting, and some were clutching there cats so hard I thought that they might die of suffocation. Harry leaned down and kissed me quickly, not making a scene of it. I pulled him into a hug, and he whispered, "I'll miss you. But I'll make due for a bit. See you soon. Enjoy Christmas with your parents." I pushed my mouth up to his ear and whispered, "I'll miss you, so much, baby." I stopped, unsure of what to say. "I wish I didn't have to go." I muttered under my breath. Harry gave me one of his famous smiles, and said, "Enjoy it. Not everyone lives in a mansion." I smirked a bit, and then I heard the boarding call for the train. Harry leaned in to kiss me once more, squeezed me hard, and then stepped back. I got on the train with a sad smile. I got into a compartment towards the back, hoping no one else would decide to come in. I stared out the window. My thoughts were running along the lines of
Honestly, wet dreams. Such an unpractical thing, but now I can appreciate them. That's the only time I get to have sex, since... Well, I'd rather not go down more painful pathways, but I've been fucking horny and this is a good thing. Closest to the real thing, even if it's all fake. I'd rather have to orgasm in my pants than to go without it at all.
Draco honestly didn't know.
Dray smiles half-heartedly, and then a sad look replaces his blank one.
Snape went to the front of the room, turned around, and then his eyes scanned us. He went from left to right, and his eyes stopped when he saw Ron.
welcome back!
“Okay, Harry. I thought that we’d start with some simple spells at first, and then slowly work on harder ones. I have a list of spells we worked on in our first year, and I’d thought we’d start there, if that’s okay with you?”

I shake my head. “Of course it isn’t. But you’re sixteen, Pans…”
I pick up the knife, and lay back down. I push up my right sleeve. I haven't taken off my pajamas my mother put me in after I passed out that day. I can't look at the skin on my left arm. I haven't looked at the Dark Mark. So that means I haven't showered in three days. (I normally shower every day.) I stare at my left arm for long periods of time, though. It switches between that and the ceiling.
Maybe we could just… well, um… oh! We could practise on this cabinet, over here. The key should be somewhere around here…” She got up, and started looking by the cabinet.

that Harry had looked up at him. For a second. It was enough to make him feel good. But now he thought that he was imagining it. He probably was. So he pretended, lied to himself, and said that he didn't feel anything,
“I’ll take that as a yes.”
So what does that mean about me?

Oooooooh! Folks, please tell me what you thought. Also, I wanted you to forgive me for my sins, and show that Harry DID feel bad about 'cheating' on Draco. So, guys, please feel better.

Blaise laughed. "Okay, I suppose that those are all valid points... and seriously, where else are we going to get more Weasley sweaters?"
Hope you enjoyed the chapter!
This could only be bad. Parents don't just come for visits to the Headmaster's office.
fucker, yet. We'll wait until we're sure about things before making such remarks." Ron glared at her, and Hermione just ignored him. "How are you, Harry? I'm sorry I didn't ask that earlier." I gave her a half-hearted smile, and then said, "As fine as anyone could be after their boyfriend completely ignores him." Hermione leaned over and gave me a hug, and I rubbed her back. "Well, considering that happened, and this has happened before, kinda, I suppose I'm doing better than your average person. It still hurts, though. I mean, I can go on if he doesn't want me. It'll be fine." I was more talking to myself at this point. "That's the spirit, mate!" Ron said. Hermione just squeezed me a little tighter, and then she pulled away. I was able to smile convincingly at this point. Hermione still looked concerned, but Ron just smiled a bit wider, and then said, "Well, we could open up my supply of Chocolate Frogs?" I nodded, and said, "That sounds great, Ron."
Dray nodded, and then hugged me. "Pans, you don't know how much this means to me. You understand why I can't be with Harry, right? I'm not good enough for him anymore. He's the one who's supposed to rid the world of the Dark Lord. He's supposed to be the Chosen One. And I'm one of the Dark Lord's fucking cronies. I- I- I can't. He'd kill me if he knew." Draco started sobbing towards the end. Blaise cleared his throat. Huh. I'd forgotten that he was here. "Uh, Draco, you didn't exactly have a choice here... so I suppose I can stay. But if you did this by your own accord, I'm going to leave. Sorry. I- I don't support

It was a Hogsmeade weekend.
I was staring unblinkingly at the ceiling.
honor, Draco. You should be running over here to get your mark! There is no refusing the Dark Lord." I just stand there. It stays like this, and then there is a soft hissing noise. I watch as a huge snake glides to the armchair. Oh. It's Nagini. The Dark Lord's snake. I nod stiffly after a bit. It's be a Death Eater or death. I want to live. But I don't want to become a disgusting Death Eater. I walk over to the armchair, and my father smiles. "Good, Draco," the Dark Lord says. "You have made the right decision." Auntie Bella gives a high-pitched squeal. "
bloods are. Of course we were drunk. Ever heard of a Sober-Up potion?" she said.

He wanted his Draco back. The one that was all cuddly and smart and had this irrational fear of Harry leaving him. (Which would never happen, well... unless he though it was for his well-being.) (He might do that... but he's quite selfish when it comes to Draco.) Harry didn't want some fucked-up prejudiced bitch. That wasn't his Draco.
“I’d love to, ‘Mione.” I said when I’d recovered.
I grabbed a piece of bacon, and waited for a response.

“I- I guess you’re right. You’re lucky, Blaise.”
A house elf came into my room.
Harry nodded, and forced a smile onto his face.
Dumbledore stops for a moment.
It'll hurt. A lot. For the both of us. I think it will hurt me more, though. He has a life. And a gigantic hero complex. And a saving people thing. And friends. And a bunch of girls that would marry him in and heartbeat. (Don't think about that, Draco...) And a house. And any career he wants. Anything he really wants, he can get. Because he's our savior. I know he'll be the one to do Voldemort in, if anyone can. (I'm starting to think it's impossible, though...) And the fact that you can throw anything at Harry, and he'll get over it, with time.
Scarhead,
Hey guys! I’m so sorry, I don’t have much time to talk right now. I’m going into the fucking wilderness to camp in an hour, so I’m kinda busy rn. I’ll be back Monday, so don’t worry. Also, sorry for the cliffhanger.
I fucked up. Bad.
I think she's talking to herself, in the end. I feel a tad bit
A look of horror came over his face, and then he whimpered. The tears picked back up up, and eventually his body was being racked by angry sobs.
And there he was, still in the same spot.
I looked at my face, evaluating it. My traditional black mascara was a bit smudged, as was my heavy eyeliner. I did cat’s eyes with it, and it went
"I know."
“Nnnnno…” he stutters out, and rolls over with a small yelp. He pushes his face into Harry's chest, and I watch as a few tears roll down his cheeks. He’s saying something, way too quiet for me to hear. I come back to my senses, and I start to cast a few healing charms on Draco, but there’s not much I can do.
Should've just died.
I don’t have much more time to consult with the voice in my head that sounds strangely like Hermione, as I make it into the bathroom.
He would go back to their old rivalry, if that's what Draco wanted. And it seemed that he had made that part clear. (
I walked into the manor, looking around. I had forgotten how big it was. Harry was right. I am a lucky fucker. I through the house, and a house elf came and took my trunk upstairs, presumably to my bedroom. I strolled through the many rooms in the house, vaguely heading towards my mother's favorite sitting room. I walked through a room full of big oil painting. I knew that they were priceless, and we had at least ten the room. I don't think that you can get much richer than that. Harry's made me realize just how good I have it. I open the door to the dark sitting room that my mother spends most of her time in. It's a big room, all dark and made of dark blues, reds, and blacks. It has a huge fireplace, and I have yet to see it
Maybe he can?
I keep doing it until my whole arm is full of blood and angry red marks.
He still tried, after all this time, to smell Harry’s warm scent. He still couldn’t smell it.
"Pansy! Pansy,
“We’re-”
Draco was crying, the tears slipping down his face silently.
Hey Guys! READ THIS FIRST PART. Okay, I'm REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, sorry for not updating for a week. I had to take a bit of a break, A. for my mental health, and B. I lost motivation. (I haven't been getting very many comments!) Really sorry, my mental health has been pretty crummy lately, so I hope it gets better soon. NOTE FOR THIS CHAPTER, this switches between no one's POV, to kinda looking in on someone's thoughts, back to no one's POV, and then to Hermione's, and then back to the kinda focusing on someone. Also, PLEASE comment. It makes my day a bazillion times better. And, speaking of commenting, a BIG thank you to the amazing, spectacular, lovely, stupendous, incredible, stunning, magnificent Goblet_of_fire4. He of She has reviewed my every update, and the reviews are so wonderful that it makes my heart hurt. THANK YOU! Guys, I really would just LOVE if you would review, even if you are reading this once it's finished. It keeps the story going! Anyway, a bit of a sad chapter. :( Sorry guys. Also, go listen to the song Issues, by Julia Micheals, Skinny Love, by Birdy, and Goodbyes, by Post Malone. Those are the songs that inspired that inspired this chapter. (Lol. I love music too much.) LOVE YOU GUYS! (Sorry for the long note.)
Blaise just looked a bit awkward, and then said, "You're still my best bro, though."
"Anyway, Draco, as much as I've enjoyed this little conversation, I'm sure that Harry would like an arrogant tosser like you out of his face. By the way, ferret, don't expect to have any friends in Gryffindor. They're all mad at you. Who wouldn't be? You're a fucking prick, and Harry's right. He should have never dated you."

Hey guys! I’m so sorry for not posting yesterday, I actually wrote this chapter three other times and it just didn’t seem right. One outcome actually ended with Harry finding a stray puppy, and keeping it. SO. Anyway, please comment! More angst coming soon, and more story development. Also, thank you to all of my wonderful reviewers, particularly Obsessed_with_drarry. YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!

Draco nodded slowly, and then replied, "If you don't want to be here... go. But, if you want to know, I didn't have a choice. So... yeah."
Wait. No. He’s on the floor.
She must be really mad. She only uses someone’s middle name when she’s really mad.
I really gtg, more chapter coming out today!
The blood was satisfying. I hadn't done this recently, but I now remember why I did it in the first place. It made me hurt, which is what someone like me should be doing. Constantly. I put the knife back up at my wrist, and then pulled it back down. I only did it light enough that it would cause me pain, but not permanent damage, well, other than scars. But those will probably heal. With time. Maybe not completely. The hope is that they'll serve as reminds for what I am.
I've always wanted a Firebolt. Father says that I already have a good enough broom, no matter how much I beg. It's unlike him to not get me anything I want... but not unheard of.

seen her hug anyone. "That little fucking asshole. I will kick his dramatic bitchy ass when I see him," Pansy said. Ron and Blaise were staring at me, with a look of pity on their faces. Blaise looked at Pansy, and then said, "We should go talk to the fucker, I suppose. I mean, how are we going to be all fine again if we don't?" Pansy just nodded a bit. She pulled away, and Hermione did too. Ron came over and slung my arm around his shoulder, like he was worried I would collapse. I wasn't sure if I
Little did he know... Draco had been watching him the whole time. And not to follow him when he dove, presumably having sighted the Snitch.
I haven't had a panic attack in a long time, and this feels like hell.
I'm laying in my gigantic bed, in my cold, empty, room, that is dark and dank and damp and most of all cold.
I was holding a bit of Harry's weight, but nowhere near as much as Ron. (This would have been a lot easier if we had been dragging him around last year. He was always such a twig, but thanks to all of his Quidditch practice, a growth spurt, and Mrs. Weasely's cooking, he was finally muscular, and quite tall, actually, but is still more skinny than I would have liked.) Harry was shaking, and his expression was sad, (no,

I'm not sure I'll even do that, though. Maybe it's better if I live. No one would care, though.
“Did- what- what did I just do?”
I sigh, and look away, not wanting to meet his eyes.
