“I’d actually like to add something,” she said, wiping her eyes. “George wouldn’t want this to be a morbid, sad event. I’m sure that wherever he is, he’s looking down at all of us just
“Mother, I would prefer not to sleep here,” she said quietly. “Too many memories.”
“Leave them be, Hermione,” Sarah said. “They’re planning for their future.”
Meanwhile, Lyra and Draco’s joint Potions and Alchemy business was flourishing more than ever, a fact that had been the determining factor for Harry, for Draco could remain at their Hogsmeade home to take care of Lily while Lyra took full control of the business.
“Harry has been trying with his Occlumency,” she said into the darkness. “It’s been getting harder for him to control the visions recently. But he
Remus smiled tiredly at her. “I’ve been underground,” he said. “Almost literally. That’s why I haven’t been able to write.”
“What’s going on?” Lyra asked quickly, jumping to her feet, wand held tightly in her hand. “Severus, what’s happened?”
“You’ve got him,” bit out Harry. “He’s here’s. I know he is.”
“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly.
Sarah turned to Amanda.
Sarah just grunted and relaxed her neck further when Theo rubbed on a tight knot in the muscle.
“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggleborn Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to be travelling with Tonks, Cresswell and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news.”
They spent the rest of the afternoon wandering through Hogsmeade, occasionally stopping to get Christmas gifts for their friends. Harry stopped in at Honeydukes to get Draco some more Sugar Quills. At one point, Rita Skeeter appeared, Quick-Quotes Quill in hand and Sarah gleefully gave her the finger, smiling widely at the reporter’s flabbergasted expression.
“That’s your choice though,” he argued, raising an eyebrow.
“Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.
“Harry, you can’t give up now,” Hermione said quite sternly, “We’ll figure it out.”
“Bullshit!”
“Look at this.”
Everyone stood up in the stands as Harry saw Draco and dropped into a dive as well. The two Seekers were neck and neck, but with Harry’s Firebolt, he was a fraction of a second faster than Draco. Draco had flattened as close to his broom as he could and reached out a long arm. Harry was immediately beside him, his own arm reaching out as their fingers battled for those last few centimetres. Then Harry knocked Draco’s hand out of the way and –
“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin as they came to a stop before the staffroom door. He opened it for them and allowed them to shuffle through into the large room.
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
“Umbridge wouldn’t walk,” Draco stated. “She believes she’s too important for that.”
“Bloody hell, Harry, what did you do to my neck?” Draco exclaimed, holding his collar down in front of the mirror.
“The Death Eaters have gotten into the school,” Severus said darkly.
be here when he does.”
She didn’t wait for anyone to reply and quickly exited the kitchen. She trekked up the various staircases until the last level, where the master bedroom stood. The door was slightly ajar and she could hear soft voices filtering out of the room.
“Has Mum cornered you yet?” Fred asked Sarah as Draco began making faces at Teddy while Harry tried to hold the struggling boy. “I saw Narcissa talk to you.”
“Yep,” Sarah said, opening her robes to show him the cloak stuffed into the inside pocket. “I asked to borrow it at dinner. He was confused but agreed.”
“Charlie, you’re double my size,” Sarah yelled back. “You’d knock me out of the air immediately.”
!” she said, cackling. “You think people will take them seriously if they’re published in
“How did you get into the room?” Harry asked. He began piling food onto his plate, suddenly ravenous now that his stomach had stopped trying to do the Samba without his permission.
Sarah worked quietly as everyone waited tensely for the next pair to arrive. Seconds turned into minutes and there was still no sign of the others. Fred and George were whispering quietly to each other as Sarah sat with Harry, their hands clasped tightly while they looked out the window. Ginny, Hermione and Mrs Weasley had disappeared into the kitchen some time earlier.
“What?” Draco said in surprise.
, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. “And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so yours might have to wait for the following issue,” said Luna. Sarah just shook her head at Fred when he went to ask.
“Way too long for your attention span, Zabini,” Hermione said suddenly, not even turning away from one of the bookcases lining the walls.
“We had him just before,” said Lee Jordan, the twins’ best friend. “Hey, little snake,” he added, holding out a hand to fist-bump Sarah.
“Still…”
“Sometimes,” muttered Sarah bitterly. “That’s an understatement.”
“Have you told McGonagall? Snape? Dumbledore?”
“Is that seriously the only thing you got out of that?” Sarah asked in bemusement.
Harry nodded and helped her back into the chair.
“POPPY!”
“Little bastard bit my ankle,” Fred shrugged. “He deserved it.”
Harry nodded and sighed.
many times, Kevin? You –
“Well, now that that’s all over, I’m starving,” Sarah announced, jumping off the bed and grabbing Harry’s arm. “Come on, darling, we’re getting food. You’re looking a little peaky.”
Harry, unfortunately, had been taking a sip of pumpkin juice and promptly choked at Pansy’s comment. Sarah smacked him on the back a few times as he cleared his throat, blushing bright pink. Pansy looked extremely smug.
“That’s not natural,” Sarah explained. “The voices – they sound like my mother.”
“Harry, drink this, drink it!” she said urgently and she threw towel upon towel on him. His face and arms were covered in thin scratches and he was breathing heavily, coughing up large amounts of water.
“I never said you couldn’t – Ron,
“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St Mungo’s,” said Ron under his breath.
“We will see each uzzer again, I ‘ope,” said Fleur as she reached Harry, holding out her hand. She turned her bright smile on Sarah and the other and said, “I am ‘oping to get a hob ‘ere, to improve my Eenglish.”
Every nerve in her body seemed to tauten. She put down her tea and pulled out her wand, moving slowly into the shadows of the stairs leading to the entry hall. The door opened and she saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside as a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it.
“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that goblet – I – I reckon they’re trying to do you in!”
Draco flushed and said, “Just because I’m a prefect doesn’t mean you shouldn’t follow the rules.”
“I understand that, Weasley and I don’t expect you to,” Lyra stated evenly. “I only ask that you offer them the same opportunity you’re offering me. Most of their actions are purely facades put on to satisfy their families.”
She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and they stood up too.
“We told you,” said Pansy suddenly, “we haven’t got as far as werewolves yet, we’re still on – “
“Honestly, Draco, that was one time – “
Sirius huffed but said nothing, instead, quickly moving toward Harry’s bed and resting his hand on his godson’s shoulder.
“It won’t be for a few months,” Fred assured. “There’s still heaps to do with the building lease – “
“Lee, stop being a dickhead and let her up,” Verity said sternly, “or I’ll cut your lunch break short.”
“I used to be on there,” Sirius said, pointing at a small, round charred hole in the tapestry. “My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home – Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.”
Harry nodded solemnly.
“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.”
“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English.
“Where are we going to go today?” Sarah asked, barely getting the words out before slumping back against the spare bed in Hermione’s room.
Draco propped himself up with an elbow and laughed shrilly. “As if
As she had turned a corner, she ran into someone, knocking both them and herself to the ground.
“I had…no idea…he was…flattering. He seemed to…to understand…to sympathise…”
“You need to go downstairs down,” Hermione whispered, her brown eyes wide and worried. Immediately, Sarah sat up straighter and began pulling on the dressing gown Hermione handed her.
They could hear Ron thundering along ahead of them and his shouts at Crookshanks.
Sarah thought about her happy memories: time spent with Draco, her mother, Harry and the others. She thought of the warmth that grew in her chest whenever her friends did something to make her feel loved. She remembered the quiet times spent with her mother, lounging around the Manor grounds and simply enjoying each other’s presence.
They spent the rest of the day repeating the events of last year, where Sarah and Harry had picnicked on the lawns and flew around in the Quidditch Pitch. Draco and Sarah ensured that the conversation veered away from parents and family.
“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he duelled Grindelwald, and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.”
Sarah just shook her head and looped her arm through Draco’s good one, pushing open the door for him when they arrived outside the Potions classroom.
“No, no, no,” said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Sarah and Harry, then back at Neville. “No, let’s see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents…Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy – “
, Luna. That’s sort of the point.”
“My, my, Potter,” she said, “I never would have pegged you as the type.”
way to Harry. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong or unfair or strange. You should
! Completely ludicrous!”
Granger looked sharply at Potter. “Harry, why didn’t you tell us?”
,” she emphasised, cutting of Blaise’s protests, “you have to tell Snape that you feel more comfortable in it. Wear it the entire day or I’ll charm your eyebrows off for a month.”
“Anyway, we’re off,” Fred announced, dropping a kiss to Sarah’s head. “Good luck for tomorrow, Harry.”
As the little man in black droned on, there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects too. They did not move into the open but Sarah saw them standing quite still, half hidden in the shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Sarah remembered her first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time she and Harry had ever encountered Voldemort.
“He is a classmate of yours, no?” Voldemort continued. “From what I’ve heard, he has been causing you quite some trouble this year. Come, now, and rejoin your rightful place among us.”
“And you didn’t see them last year?” she clarified.
“Range of sweets to make you ill,” Fred whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. George and I have been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, colour coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half – “
“But seriously now,” she said, dropping her smirk. “Do you want to talk about it all?”
“We know everything important,” Harry went on. “We know they’re stopped Apparation in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floor Network now, because Draco heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge’s office is, because of what Sarah heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate – “
“You’re right.”
“Exactly,” said Harry gratefully. “And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend – “
“A bit over the top, but it’ll do,” Sarah muttered as door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. Harry was practically hyperventilating beside her so she grabbed his hand and gripped it tightly. She spotted Professor McGonagall’s hat in the crowd and shouted over the noise, “PROFESSOR! PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL!”
Harry choked out a laugh, taking another bite of chocolate.
Harry didn’t look very comforted by this thought. The carriage began to move, bumbling over the rough ground and toward the castle.
Snape nodded solemnly. “They may be regardless,” he said. “But do not make it worse by actively opposing her.”
“That’s it!” exclaimed Sarah, standing up and gripping her wand. “Harry – change of plans, we’re going straight to curses and Draco has just volunteered as test subject.”
“Sarah, Madam Pomfrey wants to see you.”
“I don’t want to hurt anyone,” Goyle muttered. “I don’t want to do this.”
“Yes. Are you?”
“I woke up at the arse-crack of dawn,” she complained. “So I went to the library to get some work done.”
Sarah took a sip of the frothy beverage and raised her eyebrow in surprise. It was sweet yet not too much so. It was like a butterscotch coffee without caffeine.
“Thank you for just volunteering for being the practice dummy,” Draco said, walking inside hand-in-hand with Harry.
Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.
The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out. Sarah grimaced at how easy it was for Rita to come up with a headline of questionable nature. Fred’s sour expression showed how much he liked the idea.
“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have left it?”
“Do you really think we needed to be that careful?” Harry asked curiously, taking a seat beside his boyfriend.
“The others – everyone at the wedding – “ he started.
“How about now, Draco, dear?” she exclaimed. “Does he look more like Potter now?”
“Horcruxes?”
“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater. “That was a stag, it was Potter’s!”
“He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, closing his eyes tight. “He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him…and then…then…”
“Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand –
“So, we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out there?” Sarah said.
built the Chamber, wouldn’t it make sense for him to put something down there that he could control?”
you!”
After a long while, he was finally sleeping peacefully, his injuries healed.
“What does that mean?” Ron asked.
“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”
to cause some havoc.” A few scattered laughs sounded. “That’s why I actually brought something with me.” She reached into her pocket and smiled reassuringly at the slightly wary guests. “Don’t worry, it’s not anything dangerous. It’s a Pygmy Puff.” She withdrew it from her pocket and displayed it so everyone could see. It was a horrendous bright green with a lopsided red mark on its chin. Two tufts of fur on its head made it look like it had horns. “Hideous little thing, isn’t he? George made him for me not long after Fred and I started officially dating. I never told anyone about him, because it was George's and my secret. He said that he wanted to give me something that reflected who I really was.” She smirked wryly at the ugly ball of fluff. “I wasn’t sure if I was meant to be offended or not until he explained further. He said that, no matter what happened in life, I could look at LS and remember that I may be soft and fluffy on the inside, but on the outside, I’ll always be a horrid little snake.” Laughter burst from the crowd as Fred stared at her incredulously. “I obviously hexed George tremendously at that, he couldn’t walk straight for a week” – more laughter, now mingled with renewed sobs – “The point is that no matter how dark or scary life gets, you always have the ability to make yourself or someone else smile, but only if you let yourself. Regardless of how offensive it may be. George would want us all to live our lives to fullest and to not get stuck on the bad times. Remember George and smile. And then make someone else smile.”
They found Draco, Ginny, Luna, Neville, Hermione and Ron being led out into the entrance corridor of the Department by various members of the Order. Hermione and Ron were on stretchers, both unconscious. Ron had great, winding red wounds on his arms where the brain’s tentacles had latched onto him and Hermione was deathly still.
to him about this at all?”
Tom tutted. “You need ter be careful with yer pa, he’s a right ‘andful,” he said. “Come on, I’ll show yer ter room.” He turned around and began walking up the rickety staircase.
Draco’s face suddenly split into a smirk. He turned to Verity and smiled his most dazzling smile. She went slightly pink. “Ah, so you’re the one who Lyra tells me offers the most exquisite compliments. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Draco snorted and dropped into a free seat at the end of the Slytherin table. A moment before Lyra dropped down beside him, he was hit with a warming charm. He jumped in shock as steam floated off his body.
Harry and Ron had stormed off as soon as class had ended, Hermione scuttling after them with exasperated glances at Sarah and Draco.
“What about Pettigrew - ?”
Harry had just closed the door on Myrtle’s gurgling sobs when a loud voice made them all jump.
And then she left.
“Psst – Harry! Snakes!”
“How often has this been happening?” she asked him quietly, stroking his hair.
Sarah nodded, eyes fixed on the two boys who were nearly at the front of the Hall where the eighth years’ table sat separate from the four House tables.
Draco felt his face flush slightly. “Well,” he said primly, “I couldn’t just let you both wreak havoc on Hogwarts.”
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves. Sarah could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed Harry in front of her like a shield –
Harry dropped his wand: it hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparked into his eyebrows, which ignited.
“Sarah…” Remus muttered, rubbing up and down her back. “It’s okay to be upset – you just lost your father….”
“Harry! HARRY!”
The girls ran down the corridor a bit before Sarah stopped Hermione.
“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.
“So what?” Draco asked, not turning away from his countertop where their dinner was currently cooking.
“Oh definitely,” Harry assured. “I have great plans for the team this year.”
“You deserve it.”
Blaise rolled his eyes dramatically and threw himself across Draco and Pansy’s laps.
They heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same moment that a jerk behind Sarah’s navel pulled her away in a whirl of wind and colour, Harry and Cedric with her…They were going back.
Sarah beamed at her boyfriend and kissed him briefly.
She punctuated every word with a blow; Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced.
“How angry was Snape?” she asked cheekily.
Professor McGonagall ushered them away from the chattering crowd, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
“It’s not as though they haven’t got brains,” Mrs Weasley continued irritably, oblivious to the nearly empty kitchen, “but they’re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble. I’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry on the way they’re going, they’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.”
“Also, you don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said Ron reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here…”
A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back towards them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along looking excited. His hair was longer than Sarah had ever seen it: he appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forwards on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled, “I know you’d come!
Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers’ table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.
“Yes,” Draco confirmed. “We both went to Hogwarts.”
“Yes, but – “ Remus started but something in his voice made Sarah frown.
Sarah immediately returned to her star chart and inputted the remaining constellations. Just as she was checking to ensure everything was correct, there was a loud
?” hissed Draco furiously.
“Oh, Sarah, that’s horrible. I hope she’s okay,” Hermione murmured, hands covering her face slightly.
He was still frowning when she walked away.
“You can take him back to mine or yours…if – if you don’t mind of course?” Harry had no idea what made him ask Draco that.
“How you two function without me is a mystery,” she said. Suddenly, her face brightened. “Oh! And guess who I saw walking down the street looking like an absolute
Professor McGonagall was striding toward her from inside the Great Hall.
“See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking.
Antonius growled and grabbed her arm tightly.
“Damn, you’re good at that,” Ron muttered.
!” Sarah gushed, brushing out her own hair.
“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the elf. “Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work…So many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open…Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locker! And his Mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave…”
“Draco, I know you can fucking do better!” screamed Ginny as Bill scored a point for Sarah’s team.
Sudden awareness of what she was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Sarah as Harry spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, she felt a violent urge to fling the locket from her. Mastering herself, she shuddered slightly and thrust it back into Harry’s hands.
“You just had breakfast!” Fred said with a laugh, drawing his son in for a hug.
Sarah and Fred looked up and Sarah let out a delighted squeal.
Sarah burst out laughing. Lying a crumpled heap on the ground were Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.
,” then he smirked at Goyle and led him up the steps into the castle.
You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Sarah said, closing the book, “because she doesn’t both doing anything later than the nineteenth century.”
“Knock it off,” she said, smiling. “You sound like a dying hippogriff.” Harry pouted and crossed his arms over his chest. “Anyway, I’m tired and miss my boyfriend. So we’re going to go to Gryffindor to grab him and then all of us are going to Slytherin so you can make up with
“Dinner is about to start, lovelies,” announced Ginny.
.” The redhead shuddered to emphasise his point.
“He’s being a gentleman,” Sarah said with a fond smile. “He likes walking me to class.”
,” Sarah said, “I’ve been studying for
Sarah shot him a shit-eating grin. “You’ve been warned, Potter. Don’t piss a Jacobi off.”
“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve got to take clothes and salaries!” said Fred warningly. “You’ll put them off their cooking!”
Sarah channelled all her inner pureblood propaganda and drawled in a high voice, “It was only a matter of time, Yaxley, before people realised how much of a problem these
“How long have you been out here?” she asked Draco quietly.
“Are you crazy?” Sarah shouted as Harry sprinted toward the blind dragon.
“I wish you to have a drink with me,” she said, her voice becoming more dangerously sweet. “Choose one.”
“Oh,” Harry said. “I thought he would have wanted to join us.”
“So, what if we use an external factor?” Sarah suggested, thinking fast. “We need something that will play to Harry’s strengths but will also be in the rules.”
“They would have been the azaleas,” Draco said in a choked voice, reentering the room. “They’re my mother’s favourites.”
Remus rolled his eyes as Sirius made kissing faces at them all.
It was a very tight fit. The fact that the three boys had grown taller throughout the year didn’t help. Sarah and Hermione had to awkwardly hunch in front of their bodies and lead them to ensure that everyone’s feet were covered.
“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter and I shall be.”
“You’re not a part of the wizarding world at all, are you?” Potter asked softly.
“Grindelwald’s in prison,” Draco said. “He’s not exactly hard to find.”
Their words overlapped as Sarah and Draco both leapt forward to hug Narcissa, who laughed softly before hugging them back.
“You guys can decide to do what you want, I don’t want to be a part of it,” stated Sarah, resting back against the couch. “I’ll keep an ear out for any news and I’ll help let you into the common room, but other than that I want nothing to do with it.”
The barman entered the room.
“I am
Fred’s eyes glinted in interest. “Can we join?” he said with a sly smile, leaning down to place a longer kiss on Sarah’s lips.
Lyra snorted. “Who knew that would be how you inherited the place?”
“W-What?” Draco said in shock. “Mr Crouch
“I’m not sure,” Hermione said cautiously. “Ron mentioned in his letter that he and his brothers were going to check him in a few days if he didn’t reply soon.”
There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Sarah couldn’t blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight.
Fred shifted all the way back to allow Sarah to sit up properly. He grabbed her hand and kissed her knuckles.
gender. You wouldn’t want to cause any misunderstandings, now would you sir?”
“Naomi, come restrain your dog,” Draco said, “I don’t want her sniffing around my boyfriend.”
“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.
The Weasleys all flinched at the name. Harry rolled his eyes slightly.
Ginny moved over in her seat. “Of course you can, Luna.”
“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccoughing herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!”
.” Harry couldn’t go on. Draco held him tightly to his chest.
Sarah sighed and leant back against Fred, staring at where the train had disappeared around a bend.
Harry looked around the room. Sarah had to admit that despite their best efforts, it was still hideous. The walls were covered in mouldy black wallpaper which was peeling in sections. The furniture was old and had had to be transfigured into something that wouldn’t collapse underneath them at first use. The carpets were scraggly and threadbare. Thank Merlin, they had gotten the fireplace cleaned a working, else the room would have been an ice block.
“Okay…” he acquiesced. “Just – look after it, please?”
allowed to play, get the fuck off my pitch.” Giggling groups of students darted to the exit and Sarah saw Pansy give them a sarcastic little wave.
Sarah smirked fondly. “You’re not my only best friend, remember?”
The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, followed by Neville, Ginny and Luna. Ron, Draco, Hermione and Sarah stepped out and looked around.

“That boy has too much confidence to be chasing girls three years above him,” he said, shaking his head.
“I’m holding you to that.”
Draco felt his face contort into a grimace.
“I am – very,
“We wanted to ask if you could teach us how to repel dementors,” Sarah said evenly. “We saw you do it on the train and again during the match.”
“You mean you slept in till the last minute and didn’t have any time to do anything but pack?” Sarah clarified, smirking in delight. “I’m touched that you were so excited to see
“And Harry is just dependent,” Draco said as his boyfriend waved impatiently at them. “We better go before they come over here and drag us away.”
Sarah and Draco scoffed.
“Really, what has gotten into you all today?” said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint
Sarah took a moment to breathe as the Gryffindor stands erupted into cheers. The teams were tied now and she saw Draco looking carefully for the Snitch. She dove back into play as the whistle blew and caught the Quaffle that Pucey passed her, flattening close to her broom to speed between the players. Just as she was reaching the other end of the pitch, a Bludger appeared out of nowhere and smashed into her arm, causing her to cry out and drop the Quaffle.
“Can we say goodbye?” Edward asked shyly.
“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said Hermione, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.”
“Harry, please tell me you haven’t written more than three-feet for this assignment,” Ron beseeched.
Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry as Sarah Disapparated with Draco.
pretty.”
“Just make sure you both are after the same thing, okay?” she told him. “I don’t want you to get hurt.”
“It doesn’t change the mindset of people,” Draco stated. “But it doesn’t matter. Lyra and I will both work hard and hopefully, someone will act like an adult and give us an opportunity.”
“I could get used to this,” Sarah sighed after they had finished their food. She leant back further in her chair and saw Harry and Draco reclining in a similar manner, their shoulders brushing.
The crowd startled backward and the three of them quickly took their exit, with Sarah rushing up the girl’s stairs while Draco and Harry disappeared up the boy’s.
“It’s ok, I’ve got this one.”
Sarah turned to look down the table and saw that there was a pretty sixth year watching Pansy appreciatively.
“Fuck,” she muttered. “You can’t tell anyone that, okay?”
“If you’ll excuse me,” she said curtly, “I need to go have a word with the headmaster.”
“What about
“Dumbledore and Harry had to leave the school,” Draco explained as they began to move down the corridor again. “Harry thought something would happen tonight because he heard Crabbe celebrating in the Room of Requirement.”
“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly surprised.
“Sarah,” he said in greeting, “I’m afraid I’m going to have to take Mr Goyle with me to the Ministry – “
Sarah, on the other hand, moved further away from the case.
Care of Magical Creatures was the only class that had taken a turn for the worse. Despite Draco repeatedly telling Hagrid that the Buckbeak incident wasn’t his fault, Hagrid had adamantly put his foot down and as a result, they were now learning how to look after flobberworms.
“So, this is what all of this was for,” Sarah said with a smirk, indicating the lights and the food.
“Oh, my – “ Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm.
“I don’t why,” he muttered. “It just made me so
Draco shot her an offended look. “Whatever did I do to you to deserve such slander against me?”
But Harry had stopped walking. Sarah tugged at his arm but he didn’t move. He was staring toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging them along with him.
“Actually, I dropped two, I just picked up Alchemy,” she corrected. “Huh, looks like Snape did find enough people who wanted to do Alchemy.” She peeked over at Draco’s schedule and beamed. “Brilliant! Guess you’re stuck with me.”
Fred nodded again and drew his wand. His hand shook slightly as he silently cast a spell at George’s body before taking it securely into his arms.
“The Death Eater searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Remus went on. “They found the ghoul but didn’t want to get too close – and then they interrogated those who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but nobody knew where you had gone. Sirius and I were already gone by then but Arthur filled me in via Patronus.”
“Listen!” whispered Neville.
The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way. Sarah leant over to pat its soft head as Harry continued detailing the letter.
“That’s all for tonight,” Harry called. “We’ll contact you about the next meeting soon.”
“They can’t honestly expect us to just go along with her butting into our business,” Pansy said indignantly, interrupting Millicent’s reply.
“Or let them deal with you,” Blaise said with a leer.
“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?”
The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. They hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding their wands out in front of them.
“No, we’re not – “
Sarah crossed her arms in anger and glared at the redhead, who made a quick escape.
She waited with her hand out until Harry had passed over the Horcrux, but instead of slipping it around her own neck, she dropped it into her jacket pocket.
Harry paused, closing his eyes, and appeared to be listening intently to something.
“Last year,” she said slowly and in a quiet voice, “we weren’t serving a psychopathic madman and given a task meant to get us killed.”
“What are you on about?” Harry asked, walking closer to the group with Draco trailing behind him.
“What about my father?” Sarah asked. Theo shook his head.
“Sorry, Moony,” Sarah said apologetically. “But we can’t do that.”
!” growled Snape.
“I’m so happy for you,” he said brightly, drawing back.
“Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you – “
The pair joined the others in the backyard. Harry, Ron, and Hermione immediately jumped up to embrace Sarah, having already greeted Draco.
They found Hermione, Harry and Draco downstairs in the kitchen. They were being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and looked much more awake than Sarah felt. Hermione was wearing a slightly manic expression that Sarah associated with exam review.
Ron growled from behind Sarah and she held a hand out to stop the redhead from charging Crabbe.
“That’s my girl,” grinned Mila. “Vhere’s your boyfriend?”
“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge.
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: he slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another spell at Sarah: shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Sarah head to foot – the waitress screamed and ran for the door – Draco sent a Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Sarah, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. Ron dived for cover in another booth and shot a spell blinding over his shoulder, clipping the standing Death Eater’s arm.
She lowered the light enough so that she could read but wasn’t blinding Fred. As she read, she slowly threaded her fingers through Fred’s soft hair. He hummed in response and sunk boneless into her touch.
“Okay, I’m sorry,” she said. “I’m just worried. I want to help but I think Snape’s lessons are just making it worse.”
“ – or anyone can read it,” Fred said warningly.
“It’s Amortentia,” he said in a slightly dreamy voice. Sarah flicked his nose and his eyes cleared. He grimaced and scrunched up his nose. “Well, that was embarrassing.”
“Go home, then,” said Harry.
more screwup and you’re nothing to me, got it?”
“You should stay the night,” Harry told him. “I can give you some pyjamas to wear.”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Sarah, butt out of it!”
“Screw you, Sarah. You can’t fix everything!”
“Disarm him, Draco! Now!” Severus barked, eyeing the old headmaster carefully. “If you want to live, you’ll disarm him.”
“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance.
“Thank you for the lovely dinner,” he said quickly. “I’m so sorry to be rushing out like this – “
“Well,” Remus said once they had finished their lunch. Fred and Sirius had managed to eat half the sandwiches between the two and still looked ready for more. “I think we better get back and cleaned up before Draco arrives. We don’t want any delays.”
“Harry, stop that,” Hermione hissed, putting her hands over his. “You’re going to wrinkle them.”
“Back to lunch with you, Potter!” cried Umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds’ start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was.
“I’ll text you when I’m on my way home,” Harry said. “Thanks Draco, I really appreciate it.”
“I really think you’re overreacting slightly, Harry,” she replied bluntly. “I doubt Draco is actively out to get you by showing off his chest.”
only a few blocks away! I would have thought a major bookworm such as yourself would have been drooling at the thought of all those rippling muscles hauling around a new shipment of sweet-smelling paperbacks.” Rosie’s face grew serene as she slumped against Draco’s desk.
Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He did so, but extremely begrudgingly. Sarah, Draco, Ron and Hermione kept him company whenever they could, with at least one of them always staying until Madam Pomfrey kicked them out.
“We should ask Ron if we can go with him,” she repeated.
Sarah nodded. “Yes, I do.”
Sarah pulled Draco over until he was resting against her. The others looked at him sympathetically.
“Of course I won’t be safe,” she sighed. “But I’ll be with the others and we’ll be smart.”
“Harry?” Sarah called when Harry went to look further down the corridor.
“Harry.”
didn’t have to tell everyone else.”
“Can we go now?” she demanded. “We are expected back soon.”
“Where do we go from here, then?” she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day trip.
“What’s happening?”
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, “The
“What am I going to do about it?” Harry repeated.
Harry look terrified for a moment before he said, “Er…well, I think Lyra is right, Ron. Even though Kepler is a good Chaser the others are a bit…well…”
“You have a lovely home, Mr and Mrs Granger,” Draco said. Sarah scoffed silently at him; years’ worth of etiquette lessons shining through his gleaming smile.
“No problem at all, Mr Weasley. We are grateful for your family’s kind hospitality,” Draco replied smoothly.
“There’s no way that will work,” Sarah disagreed. “Even if it did work, how would you explain to your parents how Harry got here?”
“You shouldn’t have to do it, though!” she exclaimed. Sirius nodded firmly in agreement.
“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.”
“I guess we’re stuck here for a while,” she said despairingly with a sad look toward the piles of finger foods wafting enticing scents her way.
A bell rang somewhere in the castle, indicating the end of lunch.
“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, turning his back on Sarah.
Sarah snorted. Pansy looked up suddenly, the Hangover Cure having done its job admirably.
“Well, mother and Narcissa both taught us French growing up,” Sarah started.
“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron. “I dunno exactly where but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn’t be hard to find.”
And then, Sarah did not quite see how it happened, both women were crying and hugging each other. Fred, Draco and Harry turned to look at Sarah with bewildered expressions but she just shrugged, equally as startled.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped nearly in front of her. “The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L year.” She smiled sweetly at all of them. “You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.”
Sarah sat up suddenly. “We should go with them.”
“Excuse me,” Sarah muttered to the table, pushing herself out of her chair.
Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug, and they sat down too, Draco close to Harry. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute until Sarah stepped in.
Harry stared at him in stunned disbelief for a moment.
Draco heaved a great sigh and muttered, “I, too, am sorry for the curse I nearly sent your way and I forgive you for your lack of consideration regarding your spell choice.”
Professor Snape stepped forward from the shadows and drawled, “The usual limit for a suitable schedule is ten subjects. You three, however, have chosen to disregard that.” He stared down at them, lips curling slightly. “It has been decided that a Time-Turner will be provided by the Ministry to allow Mr Malfoy and Miss Granger the ability to complete all their chosen subjects. You two will share it and use it only when for class.
Hermione let out a shuddering breath and cleaned Sarah’s hands for her.
“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking free. “Are we the last back?”
Neville went scarlet. Draco glared at his godfather; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.
“You just want to sneak around Hermione and Ron without getting drawn into their fight,” Draco noted knowingly.
“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity. “Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?”
“We should get up soon,” she said eventually.
“Blaise, here, thought it would be a wonderful idea to hook up with a girl while he was already involved with another,” Theo explained.
“Shh, it’s okay,” Harry said quietly, rubbing his free hand up and down her back. “You’re okay, Sarah.”
“Now, Professor Snape has informed us of how this injury came about,” Professor Dumbledore began. “He also has informed us of your request, Lyra.” Dumbledore held up at hand as Lyra’s mouth opened to reply. “Steps are being taken to ensure your safety and your mother’s safety.”
“Give the prophecy to me,” growled her father’s voice at Harry, “or she dies – “
“Draco is the best friend anyone could hope for,” Sarah said sharply.
Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.
“Draco! Harry!” Sarah cried, wrenching herself from Hermione’s bed and scrambling through the growing crowd on the stairs.
They stook a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Sarah heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: they zoomed through it. Water filled Sarah’s eyes and mouth: she could not see or breath; then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Sarah heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something and felt herself glide back towards the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
“What do you mean?” Hermione said, frowning.
Draco snorted slightly, remembering that horrid book Hagrid had assigned them in their third year.
“Hi.”
The day was relatively quiet, not that Draco was expecting a huge rush. He had just sent Rosie out with a late lunch order when the bell above the door trilled.
“Stupid – useless – thing – “ He muttered, whacking his wand furiously on the desk.
Blaise simply huffed.
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out of the corner of her eye, Sarah saw Draco rocket higher than the rest of them, his white-blond hair gleaming in the sunlight.
"Don't be rude, Pans," Draco huffed. "It'll be fine."
“It’s okay,” she said, smiling. “I didn’t want my father to recognise me should he choose to drop into Diagon or the Leaky.”
Sarah settled against Draco’s side with Harry sitting on her other side, his hand wrapped tightly around her own. She smiled in exasperation at Hermione, who shook her head in amusement.
And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn’t believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the other students of Durmstrang came to a halt too, staring curiously at Harry. Sarah saw Viktor, Mila and Aleksander roll their eyes and whisper to each other.
“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a password because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind it split in two. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward. As the trio stepped onto it, Sarah heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher – giving Sarah slight motion-sickness – until at last, she saw a gleaming oak door with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.
Lyra thought that the image of her mother surrounded by different coloured wool, knitting needles clacking as Teddy crawled on the floor, was quite hilarious.
Draco flinched and Sarah tightened her grip.
“She joined me in the library while I was studying,” Blaise said simply, his lips twitching slightly, “she was very lovely so I asked if you wished to accompany me to the Ball.”
“So you think you saw a death omen?” Sarah asked, trying to keep her voice even to avoid laughing.
Sarah had tried for days to figure out what Draco might have been hiding but he kept deflecting her, claiming that it was just nonsense that his father was sprouting. She knew better than to push him too hard, so she had dropped the issue. She suspected, however, that Harry’s problem was not so much with the information itself, but the fact that he believed Draco was keeping him in the dark.
The three Gryffindors finally reached her; Potter sitting down immediately in front of her while the other two awkwardly shuffled behind him. He gave them a pointed glance until they sighed, settling down on either side of him.
“Next Hogsmeade trip,” Sarah declared. “You, me, robes shopping.”
“Did you just break?” Draco asked on a laugh. “Because I will
“Why indeed?” Draco said drily.
“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said Harry sarcastically. Sarah snorted but Draco frowned slightly.
For a split second Sarah thought it had worked – Fred certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after George – but next moment, there was as loud sizzling sound and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible hand. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to the injury, there was a loud popping noise and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.
“Sounds good,” Ron said. “But first can we get lunch? I’m starving.”
Sirius joined them in drawing room after lunch as they tried to clean out the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantlepiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Sarah could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Sarah was quite sure was blood.
“Touché, Potter, touché.”
Sarah managed to avoid leaving the hospital wing and ripping McLaggen’s head off, but only barely. After she and Madam Pomfrey had fixed Harry’s cracked skull, she let Draco and Hermione in.
don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.”
“No idea, we haven’t been allowed any visitors yet,” said Hermione. “Apparently, after our attacks, they closed off the hospital wing – didn’t want to take any chances.”
“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had Sarah seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my wand!
“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron.
“Although he seems to be
“My dad was an Animagus?” Harry said in amazement.
“He’ll do the right thing,” he promised. “I don’t think he really realises he needs to suck up his pride and apologise.”
“You’re so cute, you’re making me lonely,” Sarah complained. “I want cuddles.”
“Hey, Sarah,” Amanda greeted. “Da said you dropped in last night. Gave him a right old fright.”
Mr Crouch stepped forward into the silence and told the champions that the first task would take place on the twenty-fourth of November and that they would only be armed with their wands. They would also be exempt from their end-of-year tests.
“Oh shush, Hermione, just let him do it,” Fred said from behind Sarah.
, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated horrible, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.
Sarah cringed slightly as Harry whipped his head towards them.
“Did you not listen to a
“There you two are, good. I was beginning to worry you had gotten a compartment with the hag,” Pansy said sharply. She strode into the compartment and flopped down beside Sarah, placing Sarah’s feet in her lap.
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Dumbledore.
Sarah frowned and hesitated before saying, “I’m not too sure, Hermione.”
The fear that she had felt in the graveyard was quickly returning and she found herself beginning to shake again. Fred glanced over at her, concern etched upon his face and shouted over the adults.
” – she put a great deal of emphasis on the word – “became Gryffindor Keeper.”
“Why?” Harry asked.
“I’m fine, pup,” Sirius said, managing a small smile. “It’ll take a lot more than a few harsh words to break me.”
“Impressive,” Harry said to the twins quietly, grinning. “Very impressive…You’ll put Dr Filibuster out of business, no problem…”
“You have scars.”
Harry’s happy expression suddenly dropped. “Now I just have to manage that when working with Snape,” he said bitterly.
When they reached ward Mr Weasley was in, Draco pulled her out of the main hallway and wrapped his arms around her. His breathing was ragged and harsh and he hid his face in her neck. She felt hot tears fall onto her skin and she gripped him tightly.
“You like me?” Draco asked very quietly, eyes locked on Harry’s face.
George coughed awkwardly and avoided her eye. Instead, he jumped and grabbed the lowest branch, pulling himself up into the tree.
Sarah smiled weakly and climbed back through the window, letting Ron and Draco pull her into the car.
“So how did Ron and Hermione take Harry’s news?” George asked Lyra as she twirled a pen around her fingers.
“Don’t lie to me!”
“What?” said Ron loudly. “Are you mental?”
They were in a neighbourhood full of identical-looking houses – same bland colour, same perfect lawn. The only thing that ruined the ‘perfect suburbia’ image, was a set of bars over one of the second-storey windows of one of the houses.
“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. “We’ll – we’ll find a way to repair it.”
“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again…one – two – three – “
“Blaise, your pervy characteristics are beginning to become worrisome,” Theo noted. “Be careful or you may get arrested.”
that automatically it means he was as Dark wizard?” said Harry, glaring at the girl. She wasn’t given an opportunity to do more than shake her head quickly before Professor Binns interrupted.
Sarah beamed at her boys and threw an arm over Harry’s shoulders.
“What on earth are you doing here?” she continued.
Sarah shot up as though she had been hit in the face. Familiar shouting was coming from another dormitory but it sounded too far away to have been a girl’s one.
“Oh for fuck’s sake -  “ swore Draco, spinning around and grabbing Sarah’s hand to drag her along with him.
Fred said, “Ha!
“I swear those two are my favourite people ever,” Sarah sighed, still looking at where the twins disappeared.
“Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s it, Sarah…now, bow…”
Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students.
“We’ll just stay here,” Draco decided.
“Think, Miss Deaumont,” she said sharply. “Getting on the wrong side of Dolores Umbridge will not only have negative consequences here but also outside Hogwarts. Think of what she could do to someone like Remus if she found out you were his goddaughter.” Professor McGonagall turned to Harry. “Or Arthur Weasley, who
Harry turned a bright red and turned to escape, but the corridor was blocked by a line of first years. The dwarf cut his way through the crowd by kicking people’s shins and reached Harry before he’d gone two paces.
“Who was he tryin’ ter curse?” Hagrid asked.
“I’ll take it,” Blaise acquiesced.
“To drink, Mr Potter,” she said, smiling still more widely. “Tea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”
The round-face Gryffindor boy was holding what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except it was covered in what looked like boils rather than spines.
“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said Percy. “Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.”
“I can’t believe I never knew this was here,” Draco said, shaking his head. “The amount of effort it would have saved. I’ve been getting Pansy and Blaise to buy books I need from Diagon for ages.”
“You said he was fit twice!” Lyra countered. “And you were practically drooling as you watched him play Quidditch with the Weasleys. I was so sure you’d catch the Snitch, your mouth was hanging that far open.”
The handwriting belonged to her father.
Sarah raced down the stairs to the others, who were all standing with their wands out, trying to keep the Dementors at bay.
The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval.
There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Draco pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. One either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.
Rosie huffed and crossed her arms over her chest.
think!”
Suddenly, she noticed Hermione catch Harry’s eye and nod. With Snape’s back turned, Harry moved, lighting what seemed to be a small firework before lobbing it into Goyle’s cauldron. Sarah ducked and pulled Draco down with her as Goyle’s cauldron exploded, showering the class with splashes of incomplete Swelling Solution. Pansy let out a high-pitched shriek as she got hit on the hand, which immediately began to swell grotesquely. Sarah saw that Crabbe and Goyle both had it the worst, being directly in the line of fire – both their faces and bodies were oddly swelling in different places. Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.
“Do you think I have an ounce of courage within me, Harry?” Draco asked him incredulously. “Every time I tried to get the nerve to confess, I would always talk myself out of it with some half-arsed excuse. Lyra nearly started pulling
Sarah smiled unapologetically back. “Maybe.”
And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face.
“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be one of the best at magic!” shot back Ron.
“What the
Draco laughed. “I’m sure you would have bullied to Sorting Hat to put you in Ravenclaw with me.”
“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.
A tiny bed sat in the corner with a threadbare blanket pushed messily at the end. From the closet spilt old, oversized clothes which Sarah had seen Harry wearing at school. The room was void of any decorations except the leather-bound book that Hagrid has given Harry at the end of last year.
Harry, despite the brief happiness of having Draco comfort him, still look devastated.
“Relax, mate, the twins aren’t here so you don’t need to worry about anything attacking you,” Weasley said around a mouthful of biscuit. Where he had even gotten one remained unknown.
“What? Making all the boy’s gaping perverts?” said Sarah, leaning over to flick Blaise on the nose. He let out an injured sound but quickly dug into his dinner, not looking at Pansy.
“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. “There is no Chamber and no monster.”
She had blasted a hole in the sitting-room floor. They fell like boulders, everyone still holding on tight to her. There was a scream from below and she glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. Sarah twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in her ears as she dragged them all once more into darkness.
Draco bit his tongue to stop the words from flowing out of him.
She just glared pointedly at him. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten what curse
She threaded her arm through Draco’s and calmly began walking back into the entrance hall. She felt more than saw the others fall into step behind her, each nodding politely at the Minister.
Harry smiled and shook his head slightly in apology.
Draco only had a split second of horror to realise that Lyra’s eyes were filling with water before she burst into tears. He hastily embraced her and put her head on his shoulder, rubbing a hand down her back as she sobbed quietly into his chest.
“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Crabbe, flipping the paper over and holding it up. “A picture of your parents outside their house – if you can call it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?”
“Mum thought we’d been duelling,” said George.
“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. “You were just a little – overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er – perhaps it will be best if we don’t revive him until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take him like this…”
“Easy,” he said. “Blaise, truth or dare?”
“How does the wand pass hand to hand?” Harry asked.
“Harry?” Draco asked.
“He’s just being annoying,” Draco said, still not meeting Harry’s eyes. “It’s just stuff my father was saying over the holidays – I doubt it’s even true.”
I swear this fic started killing me around this point
“You did it!” Sarah screamed, jumping at the boys. They cried out in surprise but caught her. She smothered Draco’s face in kisses and ruffled his blond hair. “I’m so proud!”
“May I cut in?”
“What?” Sarah asked, smile broadening. “Show you some sense?”
“Well, they seem to be getting along swimmingly,” Draco murmured to Harry.
The shadows of the war were distant memories in their minds and as Lyra looked upon her family - the one that they had fought for, that people had died for - she realised that she would never change anything. She would willingly go through everything she had if it meant she ended up at this moment right now, surrounded by her beloved children, husband, brother, nieces and nephews, and friends.
Draco managed to wrestle Sarah’s copy out of her hands and he read it quickly; his silver eyes turned hard like steel and his jaw tightened. He very calmly began shredding the paper to pieces.
And then Neville moved.
“A few days ago,” she replied. “Nearly set it on fire at breakfast when I saw it.”
Sarah stared at him, open-mouthed.
Lyra nodded. “I think I need to,” she said. “Cutting those last ties and all that.”
“What about the Zabini kid?” Amanda prodded. “He seemed like one of those flowering ladies’ man type.”
“Hermione, calm down – “
Before he got too far, Lyra grabbed his wrist and pulled him to a stop.
“It’s part of a matching pair,” Draco explained quickly. “I – er – have the other one. It connects us so that we’ll always be able to know if the other is okay. If we ever get separated or are in trouble, the bracelet will heat up so the other knows. I wasn’t sure if it allows us to Apparate to one another but we can’t even test that yet, so I guess it’s not important but if you don’t want to wear it it’s absolutely okay, I know it’s not exactly your style – “
Ron and Harry both looked shocked from her blunt words but she didn’t care.
Sarah let herself float upward and broke the bubbly surface, pushing the water out of her face. Draco and Harry burst up beside her and shook their heads vigorously, droplets spraying everywhere.
“You can borrow mine,” said Draco, standing up and pressing his hawthorn wand into Harry’s hands.
The rest of the spiders swarmed forward and Sarah didn’t think. She stepped in front of them and shouted, with as much fury and pain and fear as she could possibly draw from her body.
on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain.
“What do you think you’re playing at?” Justin shouted, looking terrified. Before Harry could reply, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns’ every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. He looked completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.”
“Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?” said Angeline hopefully.
“And that is as much information as you’re sharing,” Harry said quickly, covering Draco’s mouth with his hand. When he was sure Draco wasn’t going to say anything else, he sat down beside Fred.
Draco nodded slowly. “That could actually work…”
Sarah cringed but took it – she wasn’t that much of a fan for chocolate. Harry didn’t eat his either but that was because he was staring intently at Professor Lupin.
“Sarah, that was stupid,” Draco reprimanded. He looked entirely unimpressed. “Rest, now.”
she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid motion, rose into the air and settled, fully constructed onto the ground before Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a rope.
“Yes,” Sarah said, slipping her shoes on. “I told the boys to wait in the entrance hall – I want to make an entrance.”
better job than you because I won’t be actively making his mind weaker through harsh treatment. I’ll actually respect the fact that he is a
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning, Hermione, Draco and Sarah gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.
Draco sighed through his nose but closed his book. Once Lyra got an idea in her head, it was difficult to get rid of it.
“Er – “ he started pathetically but Draco interrupted him.
“After you’ve gotten used to that,” she continued, “I would recommend spending some time with just him.” She spun around suddenly, her eyes bright. “Lessons are the perfect excuse to get close to him! You can sit next to him!”
“Kinky,” smirked Blaise.
Sarah launched herself forward but her foot caught on something and next moment, she was lying across someone’s legs. Looking around, she saw Neville’s pale, round face flat against the floor.
“What if it’s like me?” he whispered, stricken. He crumpled into his chair, head falling into his hands. “What if I’ve cursed it to a life of hatred?”
“It’s a disgusting piece of wall,” Sirius said, shaking his head.
“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re – “
down into the lake and the champions had to retrieve them.
“I thought so, but I only saw it for a second…”
“No,” Lyra said sternly. “Our generation dealt with far too much. You lot are just going to enjoy school and stay safe.”
“Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs Weasley.
“Um, yes we did,” Harry said as though stating the obvious. “We didn’t mean to fall asleep.”
“It’s entirely your fault,” he said loftily. “You’ve always stoked my ego.”
“Just be civil, please,” she begged Draco. “You don’t even have to like them.”
Crabbe and Goyle were standing in the doorway. All of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing than Sarah had ever seen them. It infuriated her.
She turned toward the dark-haired boy who flinched at her words. He opened his mouth to reply but was cut off by Madam Pomfrey.
Draco jumped slightly as Rosalyn’s hand appeared in front of him on the desk. His eyes followed it up to her face, which was smiling smugly at him.
“Good work today, by the way.” Sarah paused and turned to see the older woman standing as well, a warm smile on her face. “Take next week off – focus on your other studies.”
Sarah laughed, bright and loud and hugged Fred again.
“I can’t do this,” he said, pushing his homework away. “I think I’ll go to bed.”
“Doing prefect duties,” Harry said glumly.
“Now, Severus, I’m sure that’s not the case. I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it admirably.”
“But – “
The boys looked at her like she was quite mad before Harry continued on the conversation.
When Monday’s Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson came around, Professor Lupin was back. It certainly looked as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nonetheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape’s behaviour while Lupin had been ill.
"For your sake," she said, "I hope it is."
“Keep being a sexist bastard and a few bruises will be the least of your worries,” Sarah snarled.
Blaise smirked. “The more the merrier, Pansy, darling. We can host it in the Room of Requirement.”
“But he needed to break through Lily’s protection,” countered Sarah. “My blood would have been useless. Besides, the Death Eaters only arrived
“We’ve been trying to talk to him all year but he keeps avoiding us,” explained Fred.
“Go ahead,” she said weakly. She scanned through the article and saw that Rita had included everything she and Harry had said, nearly word for word.
“Be quiet!” shouted Sarah, but it was too late – Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, “
“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hand very slightly and looking awestruck.
something we haven’t seen before…Oh, this could turn nasty…”
Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr Lovegood.
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up.
Sarah frowned. “I suppose you could,” she admitted. “But there is a way to stop that.”
“Don’t glare at me, Sarah,” George pouted. “I was feeling excluded.”
“The important thing is, I was watching it as I knew you five would most likely sneak out to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed,” continued Lupin. “Imagine my surprise when you left his cabin with Peter Pettigrew with you.”
“We can’t do it, Severus,” she agonised. “We
“You – you – “ he stuttered.
“To set off the Mark?” asked Harry.
“I have to tell you something,” he told them, gesturing for them all to follow him.
Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went. Shocking pink Catherin wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched.
Sarah and Madam Pomfrey looked up at the sudden shout as the doors to the hospital wing banged open. Professor Snape staggered into the ward, supporting a white-faced Draco, both of them covered in blood.
Sarah yawned. “He’s fine, except for the missing ear of course.”
“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”
“That’s wonderful, Draco,” said Molly. “I hope you don’t work yourselves too hard.”
“Um – thank you?” he said uncertainly.
“You’d be having the same reaction if you saw the place,” Rosie assured him. “It’s like a wet dream and your hunk of a man is the main star.”
“Yeah, we thought you were both having a fit or something,” said Ron, who still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid and then Harry fell off his seat and started twitching. You were whimpering, Sarah and nearly fell off before Lupin caught you – “
“Nah, they just don’t care enough for him to deem it necessary to talk about,” Sarah smirked.
“I…” She looked anguished. “Yes – yes, I’m staying, Ron, we said we’d go with Harry, Sarah and Draco, we said we’d help – “
Draco was twitching slightly beside Sarah; punctuality had been trained into them since birth and the thought of being late to the train filled them with anxiety.
“Oh, haven’t you heard?” Mr Weasley asked brightly. “I thought Hermione would have been on you about it in an instance.”
“That’s horrible, Lyra,” Hermione breathed.
kill McLaggen!”
Remus let out a wet laugh. Harry came up to him and put a hand on his shoulder.
“Viktor – you next!” Another whistle blast followed Bagman’s words.
Sarah sighed happily and spread her arms out wider as her broom continued to glide forward.
“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they’re back.”
Sarah screamed and shot toward him, followed closely by Draco, Fred, and George. She distantly heard the ending whistle as she reached the ground, jumping down just as Harry slammed into the mud in front of her.
“No, we’re good thanks,” Ginny said.
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from the stands. Sarah looked around, half expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. Sarah winced as turned back to Ron, who looked extremely confident.
“Come on, we have to get him to the hospital wing,” Draco said and Lyra rushed forward to take some of Blaise’s deadweight. Pansy tried to assist as they trudged along the corridors but she was still blinded by tears, her face as white as a sheet.
Tears of mirth blinded Sarah as she fell into a seat opposite Blaise, who was primly eating his breakfast without a care in the world.
Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him.
“What?” she asked, laughter threatening to bubble up out of her. “I
“She’s – she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly.
“Well…I guess we should put our things away,” suggested Hermione. “Let’s meet in the dining room to discuss what we know.”
“But Sarah, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and it’s an extremely dangerous thing to have in a house - !”
“Severus – be reasonable – Harry has been locked up – “
“But she didn’t,” Draco said. “And she knows what Smith did and he’ll be punished.”
Sudden movement caught Sarah’s eye as a broom materialised directly in the distance and streaked toward the ground –
“Not her own Floo,” said Sarah lowly. “Harry’ll have to use it to contact Headquarters.”
“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.”
Sarah ignored her friend’s sympathetic looks and rose to her feet, dejectedly following her Head of House out of the Great Hall.
“Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder out the window. “What’s that thing outside?”
“Of course,” Sarah smiled. “It’s a good idea. We just have to be smart about how we ask Harry. And if we offer to support him instead of leaving him all alone to run it, then I don’t think we’ll have a problem.”
She glowered at Ron, who took a step back.
“I am sorry for your loss, Lyra,” she said sincerely. “I’m sorry you didn’t get to have a normal childhood and I’m sorry that your father let you get hurt.”
It was true. Draco had fallen fast asleep on top of a pile of books, his quill still dangling from his long fingers. Sarah sighed and leant back into Theo’s legs, enjoying the sensation of the massage.
“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to - ?”
“But I don’t mind talking to you about it,” countered Sarah. “And Harry, Draco, Sirius, Remus – I have plenty of people to talk to.”
“And we will.”
“Because you’re being a fucking dickhead to everyone!” cried Sarah, throwing her hands in the air. “I knew you could get jealous but this is to a whole another level, Ron. You’re risking your friends and for what? The fact that Hermione kissed someone
“Mr Potter,” Draco called and Potter’s head whipped up, his green eyes meeting Draco’s. He got to his feet, holding his cat carefully to his chest and jerking his head at Teddy to follow him.
“Don’t ever think you’re not good enough,” she said fiercely. “You’re my family and I need you, but so do they. You need to be with Sirius and Tonks right now and when they’re born, you need to look after your child.”
Sarah and Draco were stumped.
,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. “I don’t think
“What’s going on? Minnie called us here but didn’t have time to explain,” Sirius asked.
“You should be honoured that I’m gracing you with my presence,” George said. “Didn’t Draco kick you out of the house because you wouldn’t let him read in peace?”
“Is there where you disappeared to last night?” he asked Sarah, ignoring Blaise making crude gestures from across the table.
Sarah had made the effort to smack Ron around the back of the head as she passed him, causing Seamus, Neville and Dean to break out into fits of laughter.
“Uncle Harry, I believe you,” Callisto continued. “Unlike Scorp, I actually know you rode a dragon. Dad told me and Ori all about it years ago!”
“Get – away – from – there – “ Percy said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. “Don’t you
Sarah smirked devilishly at him. “We give each other pointers,” she said, enjoying the way Harry’s blush got darker. “It’s
“Perhaps, darling, the simplest thing is to simply
And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Sarah’s hands were numb from clapping.
Draco was watching her in worry. “Kingsley told us,” he explained when Sarah turned to look at him. “Once Tonks revived us we wanted to know if anyone else had been injured.” He sighed and put his head on Sarah’s shoulder. “Have you heard anything about Harry?” he asked.
“There!” she exclaimed, pointing at the bottom left corner.
“I still don’t even know what I want to do after school,” Lyra sighed, moving so that she was leaning heavily against Draco’s side. “Have you guys thought about it?”
“Calm down, child!” Madam Pomfrey ordered, shoving a potion in her face. “Drink this, then I’ll answer your questions.”
Harry nodded but looked like he didn’t believe her. Regardless, he let the matter drop and pulled out his Charms homework. “Help me, please?” he asked hopefully.
“I forgot how uncomfortable these robes are.”
Everyone starting firing again.
“And this is another promising pupil of mine!” cried Slughorn loudly, suddenly right in front of Sarah. She narrowly avoided being smacked by his waving hand as he indicated toward her. His red cheeks indicated that he had been enjoying the proffered drinks for a while. “Sarah Deaumont, such a bright mind! Sarah, this is Eldred Worple, I was just talking to him about Harry and Draco – “
,” Sarah muttered, shaking her head.
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what Harry had gathered, Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs Black and Mrs Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.
“Well – goodbye, Harry, I’m sure we’ll see each other at some point this summer, if Sarah has any say about it,” Lupin grinned. “I’ll see you at the Weasley’s once school has ended – I’ll owl you.”
“Sword,” he grunted.
“Oh, are we making jokes about that now?” Sarah asked. “That’s excellent character development, Harry.”
Sarah and Pansy stuck their tongues out at Draco, who scoffed and turned back to Hermione, Padma and Terry.
“To be fair, Dumbledore didn’t really tell Harry anything,” muttered Sarah.
Oooooh it's starting.....
“We’ll see about that,” teased Harry.
“Let’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,” said Harry.
“Thanks, Sarah,” Mila smiled. “I heard about your boyfriend. How’s his beard?”
“But sarcasm is my oxygen,” she said. “Being without it would be like asking me not to breathe – “
Out of the corner of her eye, Sarah saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: he was laughing at her. “Come on, you can do better than that!” he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room.
“Thank you so much, Professor!” said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice. “I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn’t sure whether I had the
“Bill! Thank God, thank God – “
“All right,” he said, poking her velvet-clad thigh. “No need to wet your panties about it. It’s just a bookstore.”
“So, there’s really no problem with it?” Harry checked.
Lyra stuck her tongue out at him.
“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George. “We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn’t have confiscated it.”
Sarah followed quickly after, tucking the cloak close to her body. After sliding down a stone slope, she landed on cold, damp earth. Harry helped her up and she pulled the cloak off – they wouldn’t need it until Honeydukes. Sarah lit her wand with a Lumos while Harry cleared the map. Hearts beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, they set off.
“Are you threatening - ?”
Harry felt his face go warm and Sarah’s mischievous smirk didn’t help.
When she remembered, she frowned and turned back to her own attempts. She thought of a few weeks back, when Blaise and Theo had waited up for her to make sure she was okay. She focused on the warm feeling she had gotten then, let it fill her up until her fingertips were tingling.
“Looks like someone is going to be enjoying detention tonight,” Draco muttered to Sarah.
“Did you know?” Fudge cried at them but before they could reply, Bagman’s voice filled the box again.
“We’re meant to pack – “ Hermione started but Lyra tutted and waved a finger.
“Oh, he’s very handsome,” said Mila. “Are any of his brothers single?”
“Shut up, of course, it does,” Pansy sniffed. “Besides, we’ve already given you your gifts, we’re not getting you more.”
She smiled brightly, forgetting for a moment that she was meant to be angry at him.
Harry began to really panic the morning of the first task. The four of them had practised until Harry could summon anything they told him too, they even made him summon things from across the castle. Sarah was confident that he’d be able to summon his broom from his room.
Sirius” – Kreacher sounded as though the words were poison in his mouth – “told me to check on you.”
“Yeah, of course,” said Harry.
“Is he all right?” Harry asked quietly.
The room went quiet. Sarah didn’t really want to think too closely about what scared her the most – she knew that anything she saw would not be pleasant.
Harry still looked uncertain so Sarah punched him in the arm and rolled her eyes.
Seamus stiffened. “You don’t know anything,” he said. “Me mam and I know you’re lying about Who-Know-Who. There’s no proof – “
“Well, it could have been anyone,” Hermione frowned. “I just don’t understand how she was expected to get it into the castle…”
“Nice form, Ron!” Sarah shouted as Ron hovered in front of the goalposts.
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. “It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilise everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!”
Professor Snape soon came around with their timetables and the Gryffindors bid them goodbye to go collect their own.
Draco smiled down at her. “Good idea,” he said brightly. “Maybe that way you’ll actually get some sleep this month.”
Two weeks.
His expression darkened significantly.
“Sarah!” We heard a noise, and someone said something about the Dark Mark – “ began Ernie Macmillan.
“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part of it!”
Sarah stood up to lean over the railing.
Harry beamed at him stepped back slightly, not missing the way Draco seemed to lean toward him.
She stood up as the others began chatting about the show. Gripping her bag tightly to her chest, she sat on the bunk and resisted the urge to rummage for the notebook she knew was buried right at the bottom of it. She had removed the charm that allowed her and Fred to communicate through it but she hadn’t had the heart to leave it behind.
Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.
want to hear about the times McGonagall stopped you from doing something revolting,” Pansy shuddered.
“Harry? Harry, what’s going on?” Sarah fired questions off questions as Harry raced around the boy’s dorm.
She spluttered and hissed, launching it back at him and causing him to fall flat on the bed. “Of course, I do!” she announced. “He’s nearly one! He can say my name now!”
“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermione and Draco are right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.”
“Coward,” Sarah muttered.
“Did you get any sleep last night, darling?” Sarah said quietly to Draco.
Draco gaped at her but she ignored him, instead riffling through his wardrobe once again.
“Well, I think I’ve always felt different with Draco,” he told her. “But recently, it’s started to feel different – stronger or something.”
“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” said Sarah, in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as good him as ours is, Travers.”
Lyra’s knees buckled and Blaise caught her before she hit the ground. She blinked away tears as she struggled not to break down.
The days quickly passed until finally, they were getting ready to leave for Diagon Alley. Mrs Weasley had woken them up with plates full of bacon sandwiches and Sarah had barely managed to grab one before the boys and Ginny were descending upon them.
“I never picked fights,” Sarah said in an affronted tone. “Trouble usually found me because I was always with Harry.”
“I didn’t see that part of it,” Harry said in surprise.
a Gryffindor after all.”
Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defences were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time.
“You need to go to sleep,” Draco decided. “Bed, now.”
“I’d want revenge if it were me,” Crabbe continued. “I’d hunt him down myself.”
“We’re seventeen in April,” George said as though that was a valid reason to enter. “They’re not going to stop us from entering.”
“It’s important though, Draco,” Harry argued. “This time, us, our friends – we need to cherish it.”
“Well, I thought it would work better if Harry taught us and then we all practised together,” Hermione facing, flushing slightly.
Harry and Sarah shared a glance, one that was pretty obvious in Sarah’s opinion. It practically screamed that they were hiding something. But there was no way Sarah was going to admit that Harry was hearing voices. Voices only he could hear….
“Right,” said Harry uneasily.
“You buried the elf,” Griphook said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. “I watched you, from the window of the bedroom next door.”
Sarah waved down at Harry when the team walked into the pitch. All around them, gasps of awe cut through the air as people caught sight of Harry’s Firebolt.
She didn’t stop until she was standing outside Professor Lupin’s office, fist raised to knock on the thick door.
Ron opened his mouth to reply but Sarah quickly interrupted.
She hardly noticed the tears blurring her vision as she kept casting, praying to every god and goddess and otherworldly power she knew of to keep him alive, to bring him back to her.
“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning around at it. “We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was a broom cupboard then…”
knew you liked each other,” he said. “When you and Lyra came back I was so sure that you would take the night to think about it and then confess to him in the morning but she was sure you would go straight to Draco.”
“My father,” Sarah said flatly. “Honestly, I really don’t want to talk about him now. Let’s talk about you. What happened to you?”
Pansy elbowed her suddenly and Lyra opened her eyes, not realising that she had closed them in the first place.
“We’re definitely friends,” Sarah promised.
Harry panted heavily near the doorway and shot her an angry look. Before he could say anything, the door swung open and Ginny walked in, followed closely by Luna, who looked like she had entered by complete accident.
Sarah blinked repeatedly at Mr Weasley in confusion. Ron just gaped and then closed his mouth, shaking his head and dragging Sarah out of the tent.
“Ron, no – please – come back, come back!”
He was right. Madam Pomfrey was anxiously hovering at the edge of the lake, a large table in front of her covered in towels and potion vials.
Blaise’s shout made both Harry and Draco turn their attention away. The Slytherin was half off the couch now, Lyra perched above him, a pillow held threateningly in her hands.
Mrs Weasley called everyone to dinner, effectively cutting off the conversation between Draco, Fred and Tonks, which was now reaching worrying levels.
“I am so disgusted right now,” muttered Sarah just as Harry and Draco managed to break through the crowd to them.
“Do you know him?” Harry asked tentatively.
Standing in the doorway was Theodore Nott, an arm wrapped securely around Daphne Greengrass’ waist.  Lyra froze and felt Blaise and Pansy step up beside her. Draco walked in front of them and casually addressed the pair.
“How was your business, boys?” Mr Weasley asked.
“But she knew we couldn’t be there,” Lyra countered. “I’m sure she’d be okay with us staying here.”
“Am I allowed to at least throw one hex?” asked Pansy in a small voice.
“We’ll leave you guys to it,” Sirius said, patting Sarah gently on the shoulder as he stood.
Remus pursed his lips, his amber eyes swimming with worry.
“I’ll work on it for you,” Draco said, rubbing Harry’s back. “Then we’ll go through it tomorrow.”
“That’s fine, thank you for everything else,” Sarah said with a smile.
“What?” said Sarah, Ron, Harry and Hermione together.
The words burst from Harry’s mouth and echoed through the graveyard. His green eyes cleared and he glared defiantly at Voldemort.
Sarah was dimly aware of Draco grabbing her arm and leading her further down the corridor as Percy, Fred and Harry carried George’s body, Ron and Hermione clearing a path in front of them. They stopped in a niche were a suit of armour had stood earlier. The boys, gently placed the George’s body on the ground and Fred crouched down beside him again. At the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, Sarah saw many people running backwards and forwards, whether friends or foes, she could not tell. Looking up, Percy let out a null-like roar, “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.
“I brought the death of Albus Dumbledore!”
After breakfast, Sarah dragged Harry and Draco away into the living room, shouting over her shoulder that they had some things they needed to do at her Manor and would be back tomorrow morning. She then shoved them through the Floo and they disappeared in a whirl of ash and smoke.
“I’m not going to force you into a tie when you’ll inevitably take it off within five minutes,” she explained at Harry’s questioning glance.
“Hello, sweetheart,” he drawled, throwing another spell her way.
“Oh wow, you look dreadful.”
, Potter?” breathed Crabbe, his dark eyes narrowed.
Remus laughed and ruffled her hair slightly.
Draco shouted as Buckbeak reared up on his hind legs and swiped at Crabbe, who jumped out of the way and pushed Sarah forward, directly into the path of the giant talons. Sarah closed her eyes and raised her arms, expecting to feel razor-sharp pain, but instead, she was roughly shoved backwards.
Harry laughed at Draco’s mock-hurt expression. But then he sighed and stared at the ceiling.
“I guess you’re right,” he admitted. “I do feel tempted to go down there and strangle that hag with my own two hands.”
“Potions?”
“If it gets too much I’ll drop Astronomy,” Sarah said, waving a hand. “Ancient Runes and Ancient Studies are a breeze; I’m not worried about those.”
Lupin shook his head sadly. “Sirius thought it would be amusing to tell Snape that all he had to do what prod the knot on the Whomping Willow and all his questions would be answered…Snape glimpsed me but James and Evelyn pulled him back at the last minute. He was forbidden to by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was…”
“How do we get past?” yelled Lee over all the screaming, but before either Sarah or Fred could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.
“Okay everyone,” Angelina Johnson called. She had taken over as the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain since Oliver Wood had graduated two years ago. “We’re going to work on some passes just to warm up, the whole team please – “
“I hope you’re right,” said Sarah. She pressed a hand over her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if – “
refuses to let me go to the back. As if I didn’t work here all last summer!”
“Sarah, I’m asking if you want to go flying with me, not forcing you to sit down and go to therapy,” he said. “Come on. It’ll be fun. Just me and you like back in third year.”
Sarah laughed in delight and waited until Ron had recovered enough to remove his hands.
Teddy nodded without opening his eyes and Harry stepped forward, heaving the young boy into his arms.
Just doing some edits of a few chapters :)
“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.
Sarah and Blaise jerked awake, blinking in confusion.
“What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Sarah’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most. “he never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given a chance to expel him, all the same…”
“Get stuffed, Crabbe,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron…”
Ginny turned, helpless, to Sarah, Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione.
Sarah looked up and immediately felt her face lose all its colour.
They grouped around Hermione, who was pointing at the topmost windowpane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.
“Have you spoken to Harry and Hermione?” he asked.
“Er…sorry…?” he muttered sheepishly.
“Shut up,” he mumbled. “It’s comfy.”
“Thank you,” said Harry, “we can’t thank you enough. You saved our lives.”
“Brilliant, your office, five o’clock right?” Sarah said sarcastically. “My scar’s become a bit dull and we wouldn’t want that, would we?”
“I’m sorry about him,” Dean said. “For the record, I don’t think you’re lying.”
“He just put a Sticking Charm on her curtains,” Draco revealed.
“You can be terrifying when you’re being supportive, you know that right?”
The most terrifying sight though wasn’t Voldemort or his followers. It was the body, strewn spread-eagle on the ground to her left. His chocolate hair was spread across his forehead and his dark eyes stared unseeingly into the sky. Cedric. A sob built up in Sarah’s chest but was trapped behind the massive lump of terror hiding in her throat.
“No!” she screamed. “Let me go, Sirius.
so fast that his eyes blurred. Sarah took one last look at her notes before putting them away and turning to her breakfast. There was no point stressing out about it, she was confident she knew everything she could for the exam.
“And you don’t think I know that you willingly walk into it after him?”
“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter…not even ‘
Draco’s affronted protests mingled with Sarah’s laughter and were swallowed up by the night as they walked back to the house.
“Uh – thanks, Colin,” Harry said.
Sarah turned on the spot, concentrating with all her might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. Seconds later, Sarah’s feet found pavement and she opened her eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence.
don’t know…I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them. “It’s over there, it got washed out…”
“That was a nightmare,” muttered Madam Pomfrey, her light hair dishevelled into a wiry halo around her tired face. “Remind me to give Professor Slughorn an earful at dinner.”
to Slughorn instead of an antidote,” Sarah said, slapping his arm. “Completely ridiculous.
