“Why do you need the library if you’re only working on spells?” Draco asked disbelievingly, though in truth, he was quite happy to have an excuse to break away from his time-consuming essay.
Narcissa only took a few more minutes before standing and transfiguring a book into a bassinet and placing the sleeping infant inside.
But she's family, I'm not.
He was shaking, mumbling, fidgeting. Whimpering.
Harry turned a corner at shivered as he drew closer to the flat. A red light stopped his tread, and a guilty sigh of relief left his body. A familiar thought intruded his mind, and he found himself mumbling that “as long as Draco knows I love him, everything will be alright.” He said it so much that had became a mantra of sorts. Perhaps even a coping mechanism when thoughts became too loud and Harry became too desperate for Draco to return his words.
Harry, also eager to change the topic of interest, smiled widely and began to talk of things he'd always wished to do as a boy. Hours passed before Harry returned himself to the Malfoy Manor. His stomach full and his mind hazy from his time at The Burrow.
Draco however, fell silent at that accusation.
Draco Malfoy had never been a fan of waking early, he’d been like that since he was a baby. His mother always said she enjoyed not having to wake up at first sign of daylight, because apparently even infant Draco was a cranky little night owl. But now, none of that was helpful in the slightest.
He was regretting this choice tremendously, after all, he had so many other witch and wizard companions that he'd met over his years at Hogwarts that he could have confided in. Ones that may not have screamed at him for drenching another person in water as if the act was enough to throw him in Azkaban for a lengthy amount of time.
The thought of Draco simply… not loving him not only didn’t make sense, but sickened him to his very core. Harry wanted to spend the rest of his days with the twenty-three-year-old, giving him as much joy and care as he needed, as he wanted, as he deserved. He deserved so much, in Harry’s opinion at least.
“I am,” Professor Wilson walked over to his desk and began to reorganize his belongings. Draco understood, because no one really wanted to be the entertainer to a boy riddled with anxiety. “It was quite the surprise to me and my family, but it was always fun to show them the things I learned.”
When they’d awoken, Harry acted as though the sadness of the last day of October had never existed, instead focusing on the excitement of the new month.
, it's an
Harry was undeserving, he often felt as though he was, and perhaps Draco was just expressing those thoughts in the open. It made sense, and Draco rarely did things that didn’t make sense.
"P-Pansy? Pansy Parkinson?" Pansy picked up the paper and looked at it. Slowly, very slowly, her eyes, dangerously calm, looked up at Harry. He took a step back.
What reason do I have to believe you, boy?
“Just Professor will do, Mr. Malfoy,” he winced at the name, but didn’t stop her. Would it be rude to correct her? He thought it might, but he didn’t want to come off as disrespectful on only the first day. It simply wouldn’t do. “I believe you will find this-” she handed him a foot-long sheet of parchment. “- quite helpful. I’ve put Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms,
However this arrangement offered a unique proposition. This being: Harry Potter seemed keen on visiting him and checking on his progress.  Though he’d stayed less than 48 hours, Draco had found Potter in his visiting seat more times than was probably normal.
Draco scoffed in complete disbelief that after all that had just been said,
, and as he repeated the sentence in his mind, allowing the words to roll over and over in his brain until they were perfectly smooth and he could imagine himself saying it in the most confident of ways, he began to believe it to be the truth.
"As friends, of course. Just like if you'd move in with me. Friends" Harry reassured.
"Wait... If Draco is replacing Ginny... well, their one in the same then... Aren't they?" Ron began, Hermione rolled her eyes. Ron never understood anything. "Harry?"
“We have one more
“I suppose I ignored it long enough for it to go away.”
"I've lived with you and your mother with my godson for almost two years, correct?"
"Oh, honestly, Ron! Ginny would've been his mother, James' love interest, isn't that correct Harry?" She turned her attention back to Harry and Harry nodded.
"So... Me, You, Ron, Neville... Luna, maybe. And?" Hermione began after a while. Harry was truly grateful that she was even considering his thoughts; all throughout their school years, the two had always found his ideas somewhat skeptical. Maybe they were finally beginning to realize he had some brains after all.
else’s. He could practically feel the frigid heat that would overcome him when the Dark Lord felt it necessary to touch him. The man, if you could even call him that, had always squeezed where he placed his hand, making sure his sharp nails dug into Draco’s skin, as if Nagini herself was taking a large, and rather
Pansy? Did he take you? Pansy!
Going away was something he’d longed for even when he was a child. When his father would hurt him and call him horrible things, he remembered his adolescent self wanting to be
Sunday afternoon was the third time Draco was imposed by Potter’s presence. This time, it was in the Hogwarts library rather than the Eighth year common room. Draco was working adamantly on an assignment from his Transfiguration class, trying to perfect it. Harry had approached his table in the far back corner claiming to be working on spells for Defense Against the Dark Arts.
! He and Pansy and Blaise hung out
“That they are.” Draco could hear the slight smile in his voice without having to look up. “I find it quite soothing actually. To just have them frozen in place so that I can remember them just as they are in this moment. You don’t have that in wizards’ photos.” Draco nodded, supposing he was right.
“I’m-” Draco had taken his face off of his knees, and now stared in fear at Harry.
he thought hopefully before quickly shaking away such questionable thoughts.
At least someone's found the love of their life, Draco thought.
"Exactly!" Harry exclaimed, grateful that one of his friends had faith in him. A tenfold more grateful that it was Hermione, whom had a much better chance of changing the mind of Ron than even Mrs. Weasley.
But now, almost two years later, she and him and exchanged a couple of owled letters, along with a few sittings at tea time and sometimes a good book to read. Neville, an apparently old friend from school despite the boy being in his year, had joined their midday meetings nearly five months before this meeting.
It had been strange not sleeping there, but he had enjoyed the change in scenery.
"I want to have a break. Live in the muggle world, like I sued to. I want to do the things I dreamed of doing ten years ago, before Hogwarts came into mind." Harry explained himself after a short while. Draco just sat there, ashamed, head down, nodding. Harry scoffed, "to think it was only ten years ago. So much changes in a small decade, Draco."
Draco looked down at his shoes, eyeing the suitcase that was under his chair. A faint blush lined his cheeks as he stuttered out an explanation "I thought, well-" he inhaled quickly before continuing. "I thought to bring money to exchange in America. I was told you could do that." The longer he spoke, the quieter his words got.
He wanted to wake up every morning to messy blond hair and splotchy freckles and loud yawns that seemed to fill the whole house. He wanted to go to the local shop at 2 am and buy as many gummy bears as he could, just because he enjoyed the way Draco’s eyes brightened when he saw them. He didn’t mind staying in bed for hour long cuddles, just because; and he didn’t mind watching children’s television because he knew they made Draco happy.
"Hermione," he began, mouth full of food, eye watering from the lack of liquid and the over eating of bread. "He was mumbling. Sounded as if he'd been confunded or something. Inaudible incantations were the last thing Cissa needed with Teddy and Pansy in the house."
Eventually, Harry quieted down and resumed his groaning as his chest heaved up and down. Draco quietly stood and made his way back over to his bed, opening his book again and tediously turning the pages. He assumed Harry had fallen asleep, and with another hour and a half of the feast left, he had no interest in waking him. If the boy wanted to sleep, he could. He didn’t much mind Potter’s presence anymore, seeing as the boy had continuously helped him throughout the month, or at least tried his hardest. So, yes. He’d let the boy sleep.
“Oi!” Harry said, and Draco felt rather smug at his string of insults, though deep down he wished they hadn’t been said. The ruder and more unkind he was in the day time, the more his nightmares would haunt him at night, reminding him of all the reasons why he, being not only a Malfoy, but
it. Enjoy the simplicity while it lasted? Because now he was an adult, and he was hated among the world he’d grown up in.
But now was the worst possible time to leave him alone in the house, with Harry Potter as his only other companion.
“You’re an idiot.” Draco turned to the source of the voice, wiping a tear from his face. He didn’t really care anymore, he didn't care if people saw him crying. Maybe then, they’d see that he was truly human, and not some horrible manufactured entity that served Dark Lords. He had a feeling that no one saw him as a human, as a person with a soul and a heart, because he didn’t really see it himself. “An absolute idiot.”
a human, was it possible for Harry to be anything less than perfect?
“The dorm rooms have been made to be about four rooms larger, and thus, every house will take its own. Us Puffs call the first one!” And the boy,
“I don’t know Harry.”
“And now, welcome our new teachers! Professor Wilson, our Muggle Studies teacher, Professor Fernsby Dankworth, our Potions teacher, and Professor MacQuoid, our new, and
Everyone else was quiet too, and Draco was so very close to jumping into the fireplace to escape it. Whether it were to Floo home or to burn alive, he didn't yet know.
Draco laughed quietly and tightened his hold around the blanket, allowing the silence to overcome them again. He turned slowly and eyed his bed, where his tea was growing cold and his book lay askew across his pillow.
And it wasn't just the trip, it was literally everything else Harry had asked him over the past couple of months that had seemed to go completely ignored by the other party.
It wasn't.
"No mother, it is horrid."Narcissa Black squeezed the shoulder of her son, signalling for him to continue.
A rather strange sixth year girl that laughed quite a bit, too much for Draco’s liking, was taking the class, along with a group of four third year boys. 11 people total, which Draco found strange. He’d thought that with the current situation that the world was attempting to push behind them, tons more people would be taking it. When he’d asked the professor, he’d claimed that there were about the same amount in every class, and that he’d just split them rather thinly. Draco supposed he didn’t want to deal with twenty children per class, and he understood whole-heartedly. People in general gave him anxiety.
He stood in the entryway of the kitchen, Draco was across from him. All the way on the wall. His face was pale, paler than usual. Almost blue.
to school after everything he’d done. Then again, when had he ever thought straight enough to realize when he was making a bad choice? He was already at the school anyway, there was no chance of being able to leave unless something drastic happened.
“That’s nice,” Harry said, taking a seat in the sill when Draco curled his legs up into himself, knocking his papers off in the process. Draco stared at his hair, not being able to look him in the face. Harry looked at him though, which only made things more awkward. Draco didn’t say anything, and neither did Harry.
Harry, feeling smug after his talk with Narcissa, smirked up at Malfoy, placing his book to the side.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not at all, just extremely playful. And his morphing is getting out of hand. Just this morning I awoke to Draco's face directly in front of mine, yet a baby body underneath. When I say I screamed," Narcissa smiled fondly as she thought of her adopted child.
“It’s alright, if you’re not that is.” Harry offered, gently placing his hand on Draco’s boot. Even through the leather, Draco could tell that it was warm. It made sense that Potter
Was he doing something wrong?
It sickened him to think that, to Draco, perhaps this was all a game. Perhaps this was just an experiment. Draco testing his waters, as if to make sure this “dating boys” thing was for him.
"Er... nothing?" Ron stifled a laugh and his ears began turning beat red. Whether from second hand embarrassment or the lack of brains Harry had, he didn't know.
So yes, it was safe to say that Harry was vaguely irritated by Draco's very chaotic entrance.

with them enough to know.
He squeezed the camera, telling the voices to
“Seems so, but-” And suddenly Harry was up, opening his robe and reaching his hand in deep, as though he had tons of things hiding inside of his inner pockets. “I’ve got some candy here, Muggle kind, I doubt you’ve ever had any. They’re great, honest. Try some?”
Harry sat on his bed, an old computer in hand. Hermione had gotten it from her parents, who were muggles. He being basically muggle born himself, knew how to work it exceptionally well despite never actually having any electronics in his youth.
would talk about my well-being with you. Now I’m
"So..." Harry began, breaking the silence. "May I ask you something?"
"Jumping to conclusions, never really had a problem? Hermione! Might I remind you that in second year it was you who made the Polyjuice Potion so that we could sneak into the Slytherin Dormitory." Ron said, ears red out of anger, not embarrassment.
“Ah, I see.” Harry laughed and threw his hands out in front of him, spreading them wide as though he were broadcasting something. “Pristine Purebloods!” He dropped his arms and gave Draco a look, a look that made the blond feel as though he were in on a secret. One Harry had told just him. “Sounds like a sob story article written by Rita Skeeter.”
For a moment, Draco shuttered at the idea that he’d gotten the times wrong, and that it was only a matter of seconds before waves of students came crashing into the common room, but Harry eased his thoughts quickly with the spluttered mess that left his mouth as he rushed into the dorm.
If he felt in the mood, he’d conjure up a small sandwich and some water to quench his thirst and hunger, then he’d settle down again. His books didn’t have fascinating tales of dragon-fighting and magic duels. Instead they were filled to the brim with day to day muggle activities, and it seemed Draco could never truly get enough of it.
He checked the clock that had been hung above the entry door of the dorms, and sighed in relief when he saw that it was still quite a few more hours until the normal Halloween festivities came to an end, and the students would refill the eighth year common room.
"A little, I have like... five friends now!" Draco said happily to his mother. His mother smiled big, Draco's words taking her back to a time when Draco was cheerful all of the time. Before Hogwarts, before Lord Voldemort's return; when he was just a tiny little boy, making friends with other tiny little kids.
“Full- full stomach.” The boy, and all the others who’d been concerned, made a noise of understanding.
Lucius Malfoy appeared right in front of him, pulled him up from his cowering state.  Yet?
Harry chuckled childishly, earning a glare from Draco.
family was downright horrible, why couldn’t he allow them to be close to him? Why couldn't he just be content in Hogwarts, the only place where he’d truly been at ease? He didn’t need to always be on the tips of his toes, in case his aunt was coming to teach him to kill people. He didn’t need to look out for when his father was in a fit, he didn’t need to know when to avoid his parents in order to not get hurt.
of his wand and light mumbling of a charm, his room was clean once more.
“I’m fine, Potter.” He kept his answer short, just in case his latter thought was the correct one and Harry was in a rush, but it only earned him a confused look.
"Yeah." He said, astonished that she had caught on so fast. This theory had taken months to think about and accept. Ron, however, sat across from Harry, looking rather cross. Whether it be because Hermione had shut him up, or because the thought of anyone, especially his best mate, dating his sister made him fairly upset, no one knew.
Why did he have to be a Malfoy?
"I was just-" Draco held a hand out and Harry took it as an offer of silence.
“Do you miss it?”
His mind raced in and out between accusations towards his mother and thoughts of Harry Potter; and his dissociation was becoming deeper and deeper, so much so that the surrounding voices that had once sounded distant completely withered away. His memories swirled about in his brain, until he landed on a specific one from his childhood that he supposed
Draco and Harry were nearly there, and Harry wanted to turn back and never return. He felt an immeasurable amount of guilt. He knew there was no need for it, because deep down he knew it wasn’t his fault; but he didn’t think he could live without placing the blame of his parents death on someone.
"Are you in a better mood today?" Narcissa asked, rubbing his thigh. Draco nodded and allowed a small smile to spread across his face.
“Welcome, welcome, welcome students!” Draco whipped his head around to face Professor McGonagall, ever so thankful for the mass distraction. “Welcome back to another year, this time, with much luck and constant hope, may this year be as uneventful as possible. I think we
has gone away?”
He certainly hadn't browsed a Diagon Alley magazine in search for a travel bag either.
rather than someone who lived in the past.
It was Harry's turn to shift and he stared hard into the place he knew Draco was.
He wanted to insist further that he was quite alright, never been better, but he knew that both parties knew the truth.
"Oh, he's doing fine. He and Angelina are getting married this year! I'm rather excited. And with her being half-blood and all, it'll be a relief to see some diversity in the family." Their children would be 75% magical of course, but being pure-blooded wasn't as special as it was five years ago; and if people didn't know your belief during the war, you could be looked down upon for your status.
anymore.
She laughed and walked towards him. His cluttered floor was cleared of all robes and muggle clothes with every step she took towards him. He noticed and tried to step back but he was flung into his right wall. She's definitely going to bloody kill me.
much, Draco.” Harry began, and it sounded so much like begging that he cringed. “Please,
remind him of the current chaos happening.
A bit upset that he’d been interjected, Draco somewhat snottily asked: “And what is that, Potter.”
Shaking his head frantically he let out a stuttering, "Nothing!" Draco eyed him questioningly, but he ignored the usually annoying Gryffindor other than that.
"Well, that is if Hermione didn't answer whatever question he has. If she did, and she probably did, then he has no use of us," Ginny said quietly, concentrating on pouring her tea.
"Thank you, Draco. Continue, please." She said offering a small nod that went completely unseen by her child.
She looked rather proud of Harry, whilst Harry sat across from her feeling quite exposed. It was Hermione, she was always able to think things through, logically, very quickly. Now wouldn't be any different. So why did Harry feel so strange to have told her what he had? After all, he wasn't so exposed, was he? He wasn't so readable, wasn't so obvious. Ron didn't understand what he had meant to say.
"Here me out!" Harry said defensively. His hands went up, shielding his body.
“Yes,
“Am I correct, then?” Draco gave him an unimpressed grunt. “Yeah, I suppose I’ll drop it.”
Hermione had already ordered plane tickets, and good ones at that, both of them wanting their friends to have the best possible time throughout the trip.
Both Draco and Narcissa stared at his bedroom door, Draco standing up upon seeing the face of Harry Potter in the door frame.
Another turn, another light, another sigh of relief. The more he pressed his foot on the brake, the more a sliver of anxiety washed away from him. But it did nothing, not really, because every time his foot switched pedals, every time he surged forward, it felt as though the weight of the world crushed his shoulders.
Perhaps he was overthinking. He did that a lot. Draco always told him to take deep breaths and focus on things that made him happy. Harry always thought of Draco, because the blond
"Come into my house with that filth all over you, see what happens!" Ginny said. Neville, a smile still stuck on his face, backed away and swished his wand, cleaning himself up.
"At the most?" Harry retorted back, though not unkindly. Draco nodded, he wouldn't be outsmarted by Scarface. He wasn't talking that much, that was final.
purebloods deserved the treatment, but he supposed
"Oh yeah, she invited me to one of her games! Next month. And I've been invited for tea this Wednesday. And, Neville has been invited back to Hogwarts to be Professor Sprouts new assistant, in hopes that he becomes the next Herbology teacher. And-"
Narcissa had left hours before, she and Teddy were going to visit Andromeda for the rest of the week. Something that was planned weeks in advance yet couldn't be at a worse time.
“A classic?” Draco asked. He wanted to reach out his arm and
"Harry, if you feel completely ready for moving out, then by all means, go." Narcissa stood from her place on the other couch and moved to Harry's. She placed a hand on his thigh and squeezed it reassuringly. "Before you ask," she put another arm around Harry's back and pulled him in for a hug. "Teddy is more than welcome to stay, and you are more than welcome to visit any time you like."
He merely tuned them out and waited for the topic to change back to him and his horridness for splashing poor Draco Malfoy in the face with water.
dead people looked, but how absolutely horrifying dead
“Brilliant idea.”
" Harry rolled his eyes at the Slytherin's antics. "Why not apparate over?" Draco sat down on the ottoman near the door, realizing how persistent Potter was and knew he'd be talking to this stubborn "man" for quite a while before he could finally leave.
i know its short! i'm sorry!
"I... I... I'm not sure." He stuttered out, taking another sip of tea wishing for a big cup of butterbeer.
“They truly don’t move?” Draco asked, touching the photos in a slight trance. He’d known of course, that muggles didn’t have moving photos like the wizards did, but it’d always seemed extremely stupid. “They’re just…
“My mum’s a primary teacher, and I went to school before coming to Hogwarts,” he explained. Draco, utterly confused at such a notion, gave him yet another stupid look.
So he was doing them a dishonor by denying them a simple consideration of their offer. He was doing Luna a dishonor by disregarding everything she had done to help him get back to a normal place in society. Finding people that didn't judge him, didn't look at him in disgust.

Draco hid his smile, hoping Harry would take the bait.
Harry sighed and disappeared himself.
*hands blanket*
,” Harry whispered under his breath, and Draco found a dry chuckle escaping his lips. “Well you are! You’re stubborn.” Harry grabbed a treacle tart off of the platter he’d sat next to him, and bit into it, before leaning back onto the bed and groaning at its taste.
“Because I was rather busy saving the Wizarding World’s arse, I’d say.”
Unfortunately, when it came to making such rash and sudden decisions such as that, he was weak. He shuddered at the thought, mindlessly wondering what his father would say at the notion.
“On a happier note, let us welcome our new first years into the school!” Draco only then took notice of the large group of tiny goblin-looking humans at the front of the hall, closest to the teachers. First Years. “Let us sort our newest additions to our school family!”
"And Luna Lovegood? That's the young lady that-"
"The poor boy!" Ron spoke up for the first time that morning, not including his greeting to Harry when he knocked on the front door. "The poor boy? Sounds like you have a liking for Malfoy, Hermione."
“I still don’t think it counts.”
“I do.”
He approached the door that opened to the stairs, but his breath hitched as he realized that he wouldn’t be leaving to go down to the fields, but to be amongst a large group of people
"We could invite George, he'd like to come probably."
“Your victory! I’m the pureblood here!”
Rightfully so? Looking back, absolutely. At the time? She might as well have threatened his mother in his eyes.
“It seems I might never stop,” The Baron replied. “Your presence is requested in ten minutes in the Great Hall. The Headmistress suggested five however, because students will clamored together.”
Maybe he'd do better asking Narcissa first, getting her opinion on matters always helped him before. Getting the input of any maternal figure in his life was very relieving to his traumatized mind, quite frankly.
Ron rolled his eyes and looked at Harry expectantly.
filled himself, he stood and walked over to the large doors that led back into the main part of the school. He had a thousand things to do, from cleaning himself up to making it on time to his first class, and he was certain he only had a short time to do it.
It was quiet for a few minutes but to Draco, each passing minute became more and more awkward. It was so quiet, he felt that if he moved it would be louder than Moaning Myrtle.
"Harry, what is wrong with you?" Hermione had dropped her high-pitched voice of accusations down to a low, whisper full of threats. He took a few steps back and shuddered. Who knew his friend of nearly a decade could be so terribly terrifying?
He, of course, never made it to his bed chambers and had instead fallen into the nearest restroom to sulk.
well-being.
Draco sat in his usual seat inside of the circular window sill, assignments in hand. He stared out into the night sky, feeling a bit strange as he searched for the Draco constellation. It had been a life-long struggle for him deciding if his love for the constellation was a form of conceitedness, but overall he’d decided that he was far too stressed to care anymore. So he rested his back against the cool curve of the sill and scouted the stars.
Distancing himself would be beneficial, for both parties. At least that was what he tried to convince himself, but to no avail. He was nothing but a teenage boy that missed his mother dearly, and the only thing stopping him from seeing her was his own selfishness.
"You're always there for me, even though you don't and didn't want to do most stuff. Like the spider, in year two. You remember? And Grawp."
like Draco really cared for him. Really loved him. Even though he never said it.
“Glad he did some good for some people. He’s brought nothing but disaster for me.” Harry said not even looking at Remus.
Thanks for reading!
I don't mean on the phone
“Can’t they be considered engagement rings?” Harry asked pleadingly.
“He told all the other kids that we couldn’t play in the snowball fight because we couldn’t throw a snowball as far as he could spit.” Albus said.
“Not really.” Harry said quietly. “I’d like to see you for a moment.”
“A marriage proposal isn’t enough?” Harry asked. He tilted his head in confusion as Draco laid down sort of under the tree.
“So I heard you liked French toast.” Potter said instead as he stepped back into the informal dining room.
“He started it.” Ron said with a grin earning an eye roll from the girl.
“Do I need a reason? I’ve wanted to do it for awhile now.” Harry said.
“Fly forever and not feel weighed down?” Harry supplied. The blond gave him small smile.
“Happy birthday, father.” Scorpius said instead of explaining.
“This is the list of people you and Draco will make house calls on, ending at Mrs. McGonagall’s.” Hermione said as she handed a piece of paper to Harry. She walked over and covered her typewriter.
“Just presents.” Harry said taking a sip and humming in appreciation. Hermione grabbed her mug and sat next to Harry.
“Yes.” Draco said decisively. Harry walked back over to wrap his arms around him and give him another kiss similar to their first one.
“Is anything wrong? I-“ Draco started as he came into the office but stopped short at seeing the other man. “Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-“
“Hermione.” Hermione jumped at the sound of Harry calling her. He jogged to catch up with her. “Sorry.”
“Oh?” Draco asked as he looked at him expectantly.
This is the last chapter. This is a first for me, finishing a chaptered story!
“Why are people like this?” Hermione asked rhetorically. Blaise just shrugged and held his arm out for her to take. She shrugged and took it, walking back into the Great Hall.
“It’s platinum and the eye is diamond so you can wear it while brewing potions.” Harry said. “It has a few protection charms on it as well. To, well, protect...” Harry ended with a shrug. Draco laughed and shook his head.
“I don’t have any presents for you. I went to see Mr. Malfoy.” Harry guessed at what his daughter wanted. Lily pouted and detached herself to leave. Harry rolled his eyes fondly. They spoiled her too much.
“What brings you to this part of town, Draco?” Remus asked.
“I... actually don’t know how to feel about this.” Draco said. “It’s a relief but...”
“Should we expect Mr. Malfoy to make more appearances?” Ginny teased as she walked over to the kitchen.
“Well I’m usually here waiting for you so I know you’re here. Also, honey?” Harry asked as he kissed Draco as usual.
“You’re an Auror. A damn fine one if the stories are true. What does your gut instinct tell you?” The man asked.
“What?” Harry asked confused.
“So?” Harry asked with a smile.
———————————
“I can see why you would be distracted.” Draco said finally coming out of the bathroom.
“I get it. This is a bit bizarre and hard to believe. I’m not one of the more important angels, of course. But I was assigned to this district temporarily.” The man said as he walked over to the chairs by the side table.
“He’s an astounding man. He pointed out to me what I could really do with my money. Help the hungry and the poor, those displaced and those with nowhere to go. As noble as your new building would be, housing and provision are more needed.” Mrs. McGonagall said. Draco smiled at the suddenly generous woman but startled when Harry stood up.
Harry apparated them outside the Weasley’s property since they had plenty of protected area to fly, thanks to Ginny’s Quidditch career. Even though it was freezing, flying warmed them up. They played a few rounds of seeker catch but had to end it when they lost the light. Harry debated on whether he should apparate them back to London or just crash at the Weasley’s. He was tired from flying and London was a long way to apparate.
“See, I can’t explain.” Harry said desperately. Draco looked up at him with hurt in his eyes.
“Such a charmer.” Draco said. “I think we’re squishing the tickets.” Harry lifted up and saw that the tickets had been trapped between them.
“Well, of course. I want you to be happy.” Harry said with a lopsided grin.
Thanks for reading!
“I know, it’s easy to forget.” Hermione teased while wiggling her wand. Harry gave her a sheepish smile.
“It’s lovely. Especially on you.” Harry said once more turning to look at Blaise. Draco smiled happily and walked up the stairs.
“Did we really ruin your weekend?” Albus asked.
“No problem, nerd.” Blaise said as he stood up. He gasped at the stinging pain he felt in his butt and turned to see Draco glaring at him while putting his wand away. Blaise just grinned and sauntered away.
“Oh, Love. You didn’t say anything.” Draco said. Harry finally looked at him.
“Then we’ll see you tomorrow?” Draco asked.
“Be good or you won’t get your present.” Harry said. Draco looked thoughtful and then threw his leg over Harry’s while placing his hand on Harry’s thigh and squeezing.
“Draco, look at the bigger picture. I want this new office to inspire hope. To be a place that tells people the law is on their side. I want-“ Harry started.
“Oh never mind Harry. Keep it for your next committee meeting.” Draco said tiredly as he headed to the dining room. Harry followed after.
“If you insist on being here at all times either clean or help pay rent.” Draco said with a smile as Harry once more greeted him with a kiss.
“Luna, what are you doing here?” Draco asked perplexed.
“Know what, mother?” Draco asked suspiciously.
“I’ll tell you all about it after I take a shower.” Scorpius said. “I’m surprised Mr. Potter is still here.”

Leaning against the wall next to the tree was another smartly wrapped gift box. This time the box was extremely long, like a wand box but ten times bigger. Draco grabbed it and looked at Harry with a furrowed brow. Harry sat down and patted the spot next to him. The blond sat down and placed the box on his and Harry’s lap.
Harry walked passed the Ministry seeing a flyer on the bulletin board listing the benefit he missed. He kept walking just letting his feet take him anywhere. Before he knew it he was outside Professor Lupin’s flat. Without thinking he rung the bell.
“Potter, this better not be a deep present because it’s been the longest short day of my life.” Draco said as he walked in the door looking haggard.
“Harry, what brought this on?” Draco asked slightly startled.
Mrs. McGonagall walked out of the room, Draco moving quickly out of her way. The rest of the committee followed behind. Luna was there with everyone’s coats in hand. Draco held the door open for everyone as they exited, the last woman actually responding to his farewells and then covering her mouth as if she had done something forbidden.
“They aren’t!” Harry said harshly making Ron jump. “They aren’t dating. They’re just good friends.” Harry said calmly.
“Well, get turpentine, or call a furniture shop, or do something.” Mrs. McGonagall said. The butler nodded and left the room. “I’m sorry about this. Please take a seat.”
“Because he’s incompetent. He can’t do his job. And I can’t stand the sight of him.” Harry said. With that he walked to the drawing room and slammed the doors behind him.
“Yes.” Harry said feeling irritated at just thinking about Zabini.
“Hermione, get Mrs. McGonagall on the phone.” Harry said. He missed a day of appointments yesterday trying to be with Draco so he had to make up a few. He glared at Blaise who was hanging around his office.
———————————-
“Potter, you’re getting too rich for my diet.” Draco said.
“Yes. But I don’t want to let you go.” Harry said.
“The fact that I’m letting you lead me somewhere with my eyes shut is amazing. Can I open them now?” Draco asked as Harry led him down a street after apparating. He told the blond to shut his eyes as he led him to the restaurant and was surprised when Draco did.
“I can’t thank you enough for sending him to me.” Minerva gushed as she gestured for them to sit. “Meeting Blaise has been the greatest spiritual experience of my life.”
“Friends of yours?” Blaise asked as he glanced over at the people.
“Luna.” Harry said sounding scandalized at hearing the girl say shagging. He was used to it from Ginny but not from her wife.
The ornaments from Tiffany are $100-150. I’m sure with collectors value they go up in price each year.
“Me and Lily.” Narcissa said. “And no we can’t leave James and Sirius off the guest list.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, actually. I wasn’t expecting that.” Harry said.
Draco once more carefully unwrapped the paper and set it and the bow off to the side. With Harry’s help he got the top of the box open and audibly gasped at what he saw. Harry pulled the display box out of the gift box so Draco could see it better.
“Hello Draco.” Remus said with a small smile.
“Would you Luna? That would be grand.” Blaise answered instead. He smiled charmingly at Draco. Draco stared at Blaise with a slight frown but turned to Luna and nodded.
“Do you not want people to know you’re engaged?” Harry asked.
“And Draco?” Harry asked.
“Hmm, no. I’ll walk.” Draco said. After a few more moments of hugging Harry he let go and elegantly fell on the couch. Harry shook his head.
“Oh? Keeping secrets Potter?” Zabini asked looking amused. He took a step back while holding his hands up at the nasty look he got from Harry. Hermione rolled her eyes and dragged Harry passed Zabini.
“Its a shame that only you and I know the lost genius. The world lost a great composer.” Blaise said as he approached her. She looked at him in surprise.
“I’m better at rubbing.” Harry said making Draco laugh harder.
“Yes but how long?” Harry asked.
“I went to the library. What do you expect me to do? Not check out a book?” Hermione asked. Harry and Ron laughed.
They sat every morning, noon, evening, and night for all the meals of the day together. They bid each other good morning, noon, and night. They even watched little Teddy together on nights Narcissa just wanted to herself.
many. He couldn’t imagine losing his Mum, despite how upset he was at her; but the thought of losing someone as close as a
"And Luna would be?" Ron asked quietly, looking at Hermione with fake apologies written all over his face. Hermione scowled and rolled her eyes.
Harry rested his head onto the wall, seeming utterly defeated. There were tears streaming down his cheeks -although Draco couldn’t see them- and his mind was chaotic filled with image upon image of Sirius falling into the veil, and the sound of the blood-curdling shriek Harry had let out when it had happened.
"Well, I've never really had a problem with Malfoy, you two were the ones jumping to conclusions all of the time." She said matter-of-factly.
"Mother, there is no way that
Teddy was gone.
A flick of his wand and a feast fell before him, a recently magicked table groaning slightly under its weight.
"Is he ill?" Harry questioned.
Yes he
. If he didn’t he’d bring attention to himself by being a “loner.” But if he did, the victim of his horrendous social skills. As he continued overthinking, his breath began to labor yet again.
“Then I suppose your parents will do.” It sounded like Draco thought he had a say in the matter, but both parties knew that was far from the truth. He supposed it was just the way that he sounded, and Draco couldn’t be held accountable for something he couldn’t control. Well… Harry supposed that was a topic for another time.
"You never answered my question from earlier. That's what I came in here to do, mostly." Harry said out of the blue after after a few beats of awkward silence.
But Draco Malfoy wasn't doing anything.
"Good morning, sunshine!" Harry said, a huge, sarcastic grin plastered on his face. Malfoy scowled at Harry.
“Absolutely not, we’re not done with this conversation.”
lost their lives unjustly.
"Good for him, I know everything's been hard since... well, you know. And what of the shop? Any talk of reopening it?" Harry conversed while stirring his tea. Mrs. Weasley, with no more children left in the house, wasn't as busy with cooking and cleaning and had plenty of time for chatter.. Harry hoped she was enjoying it.
"I just didn't want to be stuck at home. I didn't want pass up the opportunity and risk being rude on top of it all," Draco whispered as he ate his food. Harry wondered why he seemed to be afraid of talking to loudly. Everyone else was nearly shouting and it was already hard to hear your conversation. What was he so worried about in the first place?
Draco widened his eyes at that, getting chills at the thought of all of those sweaty bodies touching one another. The Baron saw him and sighed, “That way you could blend in, you’d be much less noticeable if you’re with everyone, wouldn’t you think.” Draco sighed, immediately seeing the genius in the plan.
"My baby is never going to hear the end of their mother's mistakes. Their father's mistakes."
"Mrs.- Mrs. Weasley. These- these are, are for you." He handed her the flowers and shook hands with Arthur, who had also stalked over to the door. Mrs. Weasley smiled and thanked the boy before turning away to put them in a vase.
They hadn’t put on the proper attire for the cold weather, but they had on black robes, and Harry thought it was fine just as it was.
After everything he did to that boy, how dare he. He didn't know how Harry could be so forgiving as to forget the previous seven years at school, but he was extremely grateful. He certainly couldn't bring himself to forget the horrid things he had done, forced or not.
something.
The realization hit Draco like a bludger crashing into him. Sirius was so
“Please eat, Draco. Hermione will be rather upset if she finds out you didn’t.”
"If anything, Draco, Ginny could beat you up herself. She doesn't need a man, she's an independent, Gryffindor woman; who, might I add, is playing for the Holyhead Harpies only two years after an uncompleted education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
amount of respect.
"Draco?"
I know I said I'd be updating every week, but I LIED. I'm trying my best to update normally but my brain says no and idk what to do about that. I meant to post this yesterday, but at least it isn't too late, right? Anyway, I hope you enjoy rude Harry and more sweet baby Draco who just wants love and attention!
He hadn't successfully gotten over anything yet. Despite knowing, understanding, that Draco was forced to do a lot of things, those people were his... everything.
And apparently, one that bawled his eyes out at the invitation of staying at another's place of residence.
“I’ve been thinking about it and,” He started. “And well, I reckon it’s for the same reasons I don’t like it. Or, similar, that is.”
scared him to no end. He thought of the sixth year Gryffindor, Dennis, who looked so sad. His own brother had died, and that was all he’d had. They’d been muggle-borns and Draco couldn’t imagine the pain of knowing your son was dead, but not knowing why. The situation had never affected the Muggles, but so many Muggles were dealing with the after effects.
"You think it a mistake to befriend me?" Draco said rising from his chair next to Teddy's floating baby seat.
Malfoy eyed Harry angrily before sighing and sitting himself next to Harry on the couch. "I slept horribly last night. Tossing and Turing about. Couldn't sleep a wink until morning. Went to bed at six o'clock." Malfoy rubbed his eye and slammed his body into the back of the couch.
Wasn’t he meant to be the hero? Heroes aren’t meant to be selfish. They aren’t supposed to want what others have. This was what young Harry wanted, wasn’t it? He wanted people to see him, to know him, to be kind to him and love him. He got his wish didn’t he? A small price to pay for a childhood dream, he supposed.
"And even if Blasie wasn't a first hand death eater, he's still got his stepfather's deaths to be accounted for. He could be brought to court any day for that!"
If he had inherited any of it, it had been cast away the moment Potter opened his mouth and asked Draco to live with him. He had stared at him for a good minute and stood, leaving behind both his food and his wand, and retreated up the stairs. Each step he took away from The Boy Who Lived quickened his pace until he was, quite literally, bolting to his room.
Because Harry’s love wasn’t perfect enough? And so he simply couldn’t return such a thing?
He groaned in quiet agony as his head hammered insistently with jumbled thoughts, and he wished he could be better at lying, if only to get Harry Potter off of his case. The boy was stubborn already, and he’d never stop pestering Draco with his hero complex if he didn’t make things believable.
Draco shook his head. His father had never been the type of person to take Draco trick-or-treating, even if the other October problems hadn’t been in place. No, his mother always would give him a few treats, perhaps a handful of candy, and allow him to read a few scary stories before bed. It had never bothered him when he was younger, because most of his friends were the same way. Pansy never went trick-or-treating because her parents weren’t fond of taking treats from probable half-bloods, or even worse, Muggleborns. As was the same for Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. Blaise Zabini always had lavish parties, but his parents usually handed him over to a babysitter, so he didn’t get to be in them until he was a bit older.
*whispers* Sorry!
In the mornings he’d found that going out onto the lawns of the castle and laying in the wet dew. At first, he’d been appalled at the way the grass soaked his cloak and hair, but then the sun had come up and he’d felt the heat on his face. His clothing dried quickly and left him feeling a new sense of cleanliness he hadn’t quite reached before. In fact, most of his day was spent outside. He’d bring along his new books and sit against a tree and read, basking in the sun.
"Potter!" Pansy burst through Harry's door. Harry, who was looking for his glasses, through a newspaper at her.
to. He’d been taunted with his parents' images since he was eleven, hell, maybe even since he was thrust into the parental guardianship of his aunt and uncle.
“I don’t want to.”
"Ginny Weasley?" Draco nodded his head as he sat on his bed. His mother was sitting on the edge, a fresh set of recently washed robes next to her.
Luna flicked her wand, opening the door and revealing a muck-covered Neville. He started to walk inside the doorway, lopsided smile already growing on his face, but an angry Ginny came out, now dressed in comfortable robes, brandishing her wand.
The two stared at each other for a long lasting moment, as if they were stuck in time, before Potter cleared his throat and looked away. Draco smirked a bit, seeing the aversion as a small victory. “Anyway, you’re fine?”
, you Gryffindor mutt.”
"Good."
Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco's explanation. It made no sense but he wasn't going to pressure him. After all, Draco continued a moment later.
Sirius Black was the only parent he’d ever gotten to know, and on the day honoring his birth, Harry could only think of how he had only screamed Sirius’ name, rather than try to save him.
“You say that a lot,” Harry said, stuffing the rest of his treacle tart in his mouth. Draco cringed and nodded, but soon realizing that Harry couldn’t see him, answered cheekily with another “I suppose.”
"Wait! Where are you going?" Harry questioned the young wizard.
He no longer used the excuse, "I'm a Malfoy!" and now was a perfect example. Had his father not been shipped off to Azkaban for his misdeeds to their fellow witches and wizards of the magical world, he'd be berating him most severely right about now.
“He’d be turning 39 if he wasn’t gone.”
,  and Herbology as your classes. Will that be fitting for you?”
A thought at the back of his mind reminded him that in the time he was unbothered by the usual buzz of students, he should spend catching up on assignments he’d neglected during the weekend, but everytime the thought made its way to the forefront of his mind, he made sure to push it as far back from him as possible. There was a time for cramming useless knowledge into his brain in order to forget hours before a mock exam, and there was a time for self-care. Hermione was keen on him doing the latter, and he didn’t much object to the idea.
Draco shuttered as he sipped warm tea from the mug that Hermione had kindly placed on his bedside. The room was rather cold, but he was too out of it to walk down the stairs in order to sit in his usual window seat. Instead, he found himself longing for the warmth the circular sill brought in between paragraphs in his book.
He was remembering his godfather, Severus Snape, and how everyone was surely thinking him a hero now, but Draco remembered the days he’d been in Snape’s care as a young boy. The days where he was taught to master certain defense skills, or wouldn’t be allowed to eat dinner. The days he’d tried to get the attention of Severus, only to be thrown aside and reprimanded. God, it had felt so
“More than anything, Potter.” Draco sounded subdued and his breath was labored when he exhaled.
Draco nodded, still keeping his no talking streak. Instead, he grabbed a handful of Every Flavor Jellybeans and picked through them, though never ignoring the boy.
It was dark besides the light coming from the large windows across the hall. Draco shook his head slightly, confused as to how the Saviour of the Wizarding World could ever be confused as selfish. Careless, sure. After all, he was only a boy. But selfish? It seemed unlikely, impossible even. It made Harry Potter seem human. And although he clearly
Narcissa slid down next to her son and wrapped a thin, yet warm arm around his back. She pulled him into her and kissed his forehead, lovingly.
“Amazing!” Harry bit into the tart again, almost savagely, and Draco thought he was exaggerating just a bit, if only to get him to eat himself. “This, this right here, is the only good thing about Halloween.”
“Yes, Potter.”
"Whatever."
"Us? Incarnations of... of bloody Severus Snape?" Ron was understandably not understanding Harry or his theory. But Hermione had a thoughtful expression on her face.
Neville was quick to take out his planner, and checking the date, he confirmed to the small group that it was in fact, most definitely, November 3rd. The confirmation gave birth to a collective realization and understanding of Harry’s sudden mood change, and for Draco, a blatantly obvious sign of proof that Harry’s anger was in no way his fault.
“Yes, Professor.” He racked his brain with something else today, not wanting to keep this stiff response at the forefront of his mind. “You as well,” seemed to be the only thing he could think of. Though, he supposed it was
But each and every time Harry whispered the words “I love you,” into Draco’s ear during a cheesy but sweet movie as they cuddled one another, or yelled it through the house when he saw that his favorite jumper was washed and hung in his wardrobe, the words were never said back.
Harry sighed loudly, hoping the audible noise was enough to make the thoughts and screams dissipate if only for a few moments.
When they’d all sat down and settled themselves, Professor McGonnagall cleared her throat and welcomed them. “It’s truly wonderful to see all of you again, smiling this time.” She was met with a murmur of agreement, smiles wide as if to please her more. “But I think we can
Draco had emerald green robes, his hair was combed back and looked rather perfect in his opinion. He shrugged his shoulders, making sure to keep his head down. "Is it because you'll have to share a room with me? I won't do anything," he reassured quickly, his hands flew up defensively.
I think it's safe to say that regular updating isn't gonna work for this fic, but please know that I love TBAW with my entire being and wouldn't end it for the world. I'm sorry for being so inactive, but placing all your emotions into fictional characters really does do wonders lol
"I wasn't going to say that. I meant the time she invited you to go hunting for those... strange animals she's claimed to have seen."
“I destroy
“Eat then.”
Everyone picked up their things and started to group themselves, smiling and laughing and talking as loudly as they pleased. He shakily put a hand around the felt hat and pin cushion that sat on his desk, but couldn’t find the strength to stand. He knew he should, because not standing would draw unwanted attention, but the thought of talking to anyone scared him to no end. He could feel his face pale, and he really didn’t want that happening, because a pale face would only get him more recognized.
He nodded his head, too tired to say anything and risk starting up a conversation.
"Pansy, he's told us he had nothing to do with the deaths." Draco said, continuing to feed baby Teddy. "We both know it was all his mother."
"I don't really think just living with him makes me any less Slytherin. I still have my last name, I'm still the child and descendant of tens on tens of Slytherins. I still have green walls in my room, Quidditch robes in my trunk, I'm still me, Blaise." His breath caught as he finished, and his heart dropped at the realization of his words.
"I am?" He shot, confused and trying to think of when he'd ever considered that.
He took in a sharp breath and stared at her, confused. Completely and utterly confused. “What?”
He slid down the wall until his neck was right in her grip. She pushed down and he gasped.
Mrs. Weasley, ever the mother, raised her wand to fix yet another plate of food. "Here you go dear. And please, don't hesitate to ask for seconds. Merlin knows you and Harry've been starved." Draco gave her a surprised and offended look that quickly made her explain herself. "I'm not talking of your mother of course. I've had quite a few teenage boys in these kitchens, I know what the lot of you do."
But it was completely fine that Harry was  stuck in his bedroom, he already had so many things to do. With the trip a week away and the prospect of traveling with six pure blood wizards who had never so much as seen a real television in person, there was a lot of pressure on both him and Hermione, and absolutely no time at all for listening in on the Slytherin duos' conversation.
He wondered if they’d hurt him, or if they’d treat him like the scum on the bottom of their shoes. He knew he deserved either treatment, possibly, no
At a complete loss for words, Draco let out a quiet “I’m sorry,” as he ran a hand through his hair.
"We were children?" Pansy recoiled. She had apparated to his house just an hour before, as soon as she got Draco's family owl. He was sure Blaise would be furious he was taking away their time together, but they were dating. They had all the time in the world to "spend time together."
"I'm guessing you'd be your father?" Hermione said after a thought. Harry nodded.
hungry?” Harry asked eventually, sitting on one of the beds. Draco tentatively sat down on one closer to Harry rather than his own. “You haven’t eaten since yesterday morning.”
Even now, his immediate thoughts went to Hedwig, his beautiful, snowy white owl whom had died in the war. After all, it proved to be extremely hard to forget the death of your loved ones, no matter how many years you put between you and their passing.
“They could have had another child, they could have
have warm hands, though he didn’t know why. Nevertheless, he allowed a small smile to come across his face when the touch remained. “What happened was quite intense, and it’s fine if you need time to recover.”
"Do you, Draco, want to go to America Harry and Hermione and Ron?" She explained.
considering packing for the holiday trip to America. The mere thought was absurd.
“How would you know, Potter?” Draco asked, voice hostile and defensive.
"Or," he added quickly, brushing his hair out of his face. He hadn't bothered to do it this morning. "Expecting to expect?"
Draco allowed his eyes to wander, hoping that the movement would stop the tears from leaving their spots. He saw Poppy Parkinson and had half a mind to get her attention but stopped himself. Pansy would
Draco's eyes, ever wide, ever fearful, blinked rapidly after his father directed his attention to the baby beside him. "No!"
To serve the dark lord.
, was given his book back, and he pocketed it away before giving his attention back to the professor. “When I was a boy, I despised them so much, but as I grew, they got more and more beautiful. I think you’ll enjoy the others.” Draco nodded, feeling quite a bit more happy than when he first walked in.
“Any other ideas?” The professor said quickly, noticing Draco’s body language.
Draco Malfoy came stomping down the steps, dressed head to toe in a tailored black suit, and holding his robes.
"Well... you might be hungry. I don't have my wand. You could magic yourself up something?" Harry offered, glancing hopefully st Draco from the corner of his eye.
Now Potter was mocking him, albeit in his head, it was mocking nonetheless. Of course, this was not true.
The bird flew over to his desk and all but passed out from what must be the exhaustion of having to haul such a large package for such a long distance.
"Me and you? We are not dating." Draco said, extending his hands infront of him as if that would block whatever ideas in Harry's mind form coming out.
to ask for help, his position in life didn’t grant him that luxury.
To Draco, was Harry so imperfect that he simply couldn’t express his love for him?
Draco understood that his mother wanted some quality time with at least one sane family member, he understood that his aunt Andromeda was Teddy Lupin's grandmother, he understood. Truly he did.
He’d fallen asleep in a quiet, calming setting that was the unoccupied Hogwarts castle and awoken to the buzz and sudden fullness of September First Madness.
"What's it to you, Potter?" Draco sneered, face contorting into a scowl. In truth, however, it was half hearted. The hatred for Harry, the hatred he had thrived on for years, just wasn't there anymore.
He looked around, but he was careful not to look directly at anyone, in case he made contact. In case he got himself caught. Though, he was sure Hermione would be on it the moment class ended.
“You wish you would’ve stayed dead that day?”
"Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll, I'll go to The Burrow to talk with Mrs. Weasley. She probably needs help with... with sweaters or something." Draco nodded dismissively and apparated away.
"I don't know, you used to hate me. And now, we've slowly become... acquaintances to say the least." Harry, although he didn't smile, sounded like he did.
on keeping a pleasant attitude. But he allowed his new teacher to hold his book a bit longer, wanting to know what on Earth a ‘classic’ meant.
“Oh wow, that’s so cool!” Draco gave a tight smile. “Anyway, your table is there!” She pointed to the middle table and Draco nodded quickly.
Pansy glared at him, whether it be for interrupting her silent baby time or the sudden question that made her angry, he didn't know.
“”Oh that’s yours, mate?” The Huffle asked, Draco nodded tightly and adjusted his posture. “That’s fine, enough for the lot of us, I suppose. You sure you're alright though?”
group of students to welcome before settling into normal announcements.” Draco tensed at that, putting his head down slightly. “Our Eighth years, returning to complete their education. Along with yourselves, our Eighth years risked their lives for the fate of the Wizarding World. Welcome back students, you have been missed and the lives of your peers who cannot be with us today, are well remembered.” The table began to shake from the violence of the claps and cheers that had suddenly erupted. Draco chose to join in, so as not to cause attention to himself, but deep down he knew that wasn’t the only reason.
“Ah so Potter is here-“
“I explained how being with me would be bad and how the press would never leave you alone about it. Yes, they’d come after me but I have the mental and emotional strength-“ Harry raised an eyebrow with a disbelieving look making Draco purse his lips but continue, “externally. So the press wouldn’t get a rise out of me so easily.” Draco finished.
Harry had bought finely crafted robes for Draco. They were black so they could be worn anywhere. They were definitely winter robes though because the entire inside was fur lined. He knew that the fur was humanely sourced and that there was a type of preservation charm that kept the fur fresh and clean. He had been too busy imagining Draco in them to listen too closely to the salesperson.
“Here.” Draco said handing the coin to Harry.
“Blaise, not once have you looked at my palm.” Draco pointed out. “I don’t know if you’re joking or if you’re serious.”
“It’s complicated.” Lucius said setting his empty tumbler down. He huffed at the flat look he got. “I’m happy he’s happy. It’s not a terrible match. But the Potters...”
They both sat down at opposite sides of the long table in stony silence. Draco ate his starter quietly as Harry stared at him. He glanced at his food and moved it around a little but didn’t eat any.
“I’ve never fought an angel but I suggest you take off your coat and put up your dukes.” Harry said.
“Well then I’m sorry I ever learned anything.” Blaise said almost seriously. Draco shook his head.
“I am always “nice” and dignified.” Lucius said. “Unlike certain people.” He added. Narcissa rolled her eyes and headed to the door.
To a platinum mine
“Should I look under the tree?” Draco asked as he headed over there before Harry answered.
“Well, if they’re dating-“ Ron started.
“Lunch. One o’clock. You made the appointment over a month ago.” Hermione explained. She then turned and grabbed her large purse. She turned to look at Harry as she left the room, slowly closing the door behind her. “Goodnight Harry.”
“I worked in Paris and I’ll have you know they liked my French.” Blaise said.
“No. It was me. When an immortal finds himself envying the mortal entrusted in his care that’s a danger signal.” Blaise said and then gave Harry an intense look. “Take him in your arms and hold him tight.” He once more looked up. “Alright, coming. Kiss him for me, you lucky Harry.”
“It says your name on your card.” Blaise pointed at the little information card that was on the dash. Neville hummed in response.
“Sometimes. Angels must rush in where fools fear to tread.” Blaise said.
“You did?” Draco asked happy at his son’s excitement.
“Hm. Maybe Luna got it for her.” Draco said quietly. He then walked over to the bathroom. Harry quickly followed him in and shut the door behind them, taking Draco into his arms.
“It seems you have a gift under the tree.” Draco said with a smirk. “You should unwrap it and enjoy.”
“No! I am daft. I’ve been daft from the very start!” Harry said vehemently. He was starting to get worked up but calmed down when Draco grabbed his face and made him look him in the eye.
“Oh yes, of course.” Harry agreed flatly. He glanced at the clock and kissed the blond, then stood up.
“I trust you had a profitable afternoon, Blaise?” Harry asked.
“Let’s go down and drink some. Let’s drink to us. To our happiness. To our many years together and forever. Then let’s smash the glasses in the fireplace.” Harry said.
Draco laughed as Harry growled and tackled him to the couch. Harry just attacked him with kisses. Draco hummed happily.
“Right?” Blaise asked amused. He yelped when the Prophet burst into flames.
“Of course we’re more than friends now.” Harry said as he held Draco’s waist.
“With?” Harry prompted.
“Fleur.” Draco said warmly. She leaned in and kissed both his cheeks.
Scorpius set his over night bag down, which a house elf quickly appeared and disappeared with. His father usually appeared a few minutes after he arrived home. He was taking longer than usual. Hopefully his father was fine and just sorting out his guest.
“Well he’s been in love with Harry for years now. I don’t see why not.” Luna said and then hugged Ginny. “A baby born from pure love.” She said with a happy sigh.
“You’re right. “Scarhead” has such a lovely ring to it.” Draco said as he headed over to the couch after glancing at the tree.
“Yes.” Harry said.
“Is that so?” Harry asked as he shut his eyes in annoyance.
“Maybe I wanted to start a new tradition with you alone.” Harry said. “And everyone but you knows where I’m taking you tonight.”
“What? But Scor wasn’t aiming for that!” Draco said.
“I see Mrs. McGonagall has pledged quite a hefty sum but has not yet sent her check.” Blaise said waving the small index card around.
“A gourmand, eh?” Fleur said. She then listed a meal in French that she thought would be perfect. Blaise responded in French with an alternative. Fleur nodded but rolled her eyes as she walked away from the table.
“Why’s that?” Draco asked, seemingly innocently except the dilated eyes gave him away. Harry just smirked and kissed his blond deeply.
“I’ve been doing some social services in town.” Blaise said.
“We are?” Draco asked.
“That is The most ridiculous thing.” Draco said.
“It’s fine. What’s up?” Hermione asked.
“What brought this on? The end of the school year isn’t for a few more months.” Draco asked curiously. The flash of something in Harry’s eyes really got his attention.
“Thank you.” Draco said. His eyes widened when he caught the time on his watch. “I have to go. It was lovely seeing you Severus. Professor.”
“Alright, well goodbye.” Remus said trying to once again sidestep the man but was  once more blocked.
“Nothings wrong I just really, really, really wanted to give you this.” Harry said presenting the rectangular box to Draco with an excited smile.
“Then do it. Build my building for me. With one wave of your hand.” Harry said.
She smirked at the scandalized look Draco had on his face before she shut the door gently. She hoped Harry wouldn’t suffocate himself with how hard he was pressing the pillow against his face. She headed back down to start over the chapter she had been reading. Hopefully Lucius wasn’t waiting for attention.
“Oh...” Draco said.
“It’s beautiful Luna.” Draco said.
“Of course I’m sure.” Harry said incredulously. “I want to marry you.”
“That doesn’t answer my question.” Harry stated as he started to lower the ring box down.
“Get your smug arse over here, Malfoy.” Harry said after snorting.
“What happened?” Harry asked startled wanting to hug his blond but not wanting to irritate him. Luckily Draco took that decision out of his hands and wrapped his arms around him and clung to him.
“Harry, you have to remember that the real world will probably be cruel to us.” Draco said running his knuckles over Harry’s cheek.
“Yes.” Harry responded just as slowly. He glanced at Hermione who’s eyebrows were furrowed in concern while looking at Ron.
“That’ll take you out of your way.” Neville pointed out.
“Yes. Should she not?” Draco asked warily. He was confused when Harry rolled into his pillow to groan and then mutter something. “Come again?”
“Naughty gets you a spanking and no gift.” Harry said. He held his breath as Draco seemed to think about which one he wanted more. The blond let out a put upon sigh.
“Oh.” Harry said breathlessly realizing what Draco had in mind. “Yeah, the best Christmas.”
—————————————
Hermione threw a notice-me-not charm at Harry as she walked away. She knew that small paragraph would annoy Harry. He was always so irrational when it came to Draco.
“Erm... Together?” Harry asked. Hermione smiled and shook her head in amusement. She canceled the silencing spell and turned only to jump back in shock, knocking into Harry who steadied her.
Draco hummed and brought the two gifts closer to himself. They were both in a familiar shade of blue boxes with blue ribbons, small T & C.’s adorned the boxes and ribbon. He pulled on the ribbon of one and lifted the lid up. He delicately lifted the ornament and stared in slight awe. It was a blown glass ornament made of translucent blue glass in what looked like a traditional Christmas lightbulb shape. It had strips of glass adorning the middle with Tiffany & Co. stamped right in the center. It had the signature blue colored ribbon as the ornament hanger.*
“Oh? Excited?” Draco asked with a smirk. Harry felt himself start to blush.
“Thank you.” Draco said staring at the band smiling down at it. He then blinked and looked at Blaise. “Not even going to ask who?”
“Draco doesn’t.” Blaise said with a smirk.
“The tacky lightning bolt charm? Yes.” Draco said.
“Excellent. Follow me.” Remus said.
After months of healing he was back in tip top shape. He had actually done his therapy faster than anticipated. His coach, team manager, and team healer put him through rigorous tests to make sure he was actually healed. It had felt like tryouts all over again but he passed with flying colors. He was scheduled to practice the week after but wouldn’t play in any games until the new season.
“Draco... Get out. Get out of my house!” Harry said riled up.
“I could guess.” Ron said with a smile. Hermione looked at him questioningly.
“With Blaise?” Harry asked tensely.
“Well... you could eat at the Slytherin table if you promise not to attack, maim, kill, or death glare at Blaise.” Draco said.
“Harry I’m so relieved. You found someone to help. Where are you from?” Draco asked.
Narcissa smiled gently at the two boys laying on the bed. Draco was spread out trying to take up as much room on the bed. Harry was laying properly on the bed but was slightly curled up. He was looking at her curiously. They appeared to just be hanging out.
“I guess...” Harry said. “I love him so much.”
“We had a wonderful time.” Draco said as he walked over to hug and kiss him. “I wish you were with us.”
“I think you should wear this anyway.” Luna said as she grabbed a garish looking scarf and turned to Blaise. “I bought this for Harry last Christmas but he’s never worn it.”
“What should I do?” Harry murmured, resting his hands on the fireplace mantel. His eyes widened when the picture seemed to glow. He stared in amazement but snapped out of it when he heard his office door open and close.
“I’m sorry, what?” Harry asked. “Since when have you two been getting on with Zabini?”
“I can’t ice skate.” Neville said.
Draco gently lifted the item out of the box, which Harry moved to the coffee table, and ran his fingers reverently over the polished wood. Harry had gotten him a broom. Not just any broom though. There had been a series of re-released brooms that had come out. The collection was called Brooms Through The Decades. Harry was amazed at the range of styles. Some were limited releases such as the one he had gotten Draco. Of course the blond’s favorite had been the most expensive. It had a light blue stripe running through it. Apparently it was a special stone. The look of awe on Draco’s face was worth the price he paid for it.
“I expect you both to be presentable for dinner.” Narcissa said as she started to leave. Before she shut the door she added, “Use contraception.”
“I’m telling you I love you.” Harry said, which made Draco blush and look away from him.
“Alright. The plaque on his statue won’t be just a tiny brass thing.” Mrs. McGonagall stated.
“Scor, you’ve been looking forward to this camping trip since you came home from school.” Draco said.
“Make my desk fly around the room.” Harry said.
“Of course I do... Was it Vienna?” Remus asked.
——————————-
“Ah, Yes. His work. He’s much too busy to see us anymore.” Fleur said not masking her disappointment. “We understand though. Of course we understand.”
“Of course I want to!” Draco said firmly.
“You know I don’t like going to these events alone.” Draco said. Their attention turned to look at Blaise who had stepped closer to them. Harry’s face turned stony.
“Severus?” Remus asked in surprise. The man chuckled.
“I’m not surprised. Plus you and Pansy probably made bets about it.” Draco said blandly.
“Oh yes. I know it. It’s been years since I’ve been.” Draco said.
Draco and Blaise watched as a man tried the jacket on with the help of a shop attendant. The shop attendant was touting all the great features of the jacket and how it wasn’t for everyone. When the attendant stepped away, Blaise stepped into view in the mirror the man was looking in. He caught the man’s eye and shook his head in the negative.
“Where did you find him?” Minerva asked curiously.
“He won’t remember. Nor the kids, Luna, Professor Lupin. No one.” Blaise said. Harry stared at him.
“Harry.” Draco said for maybe the third time in his life.
“Hello. Mrs. McGonagall? Yes I must speak with you, this afternoon if possible. No?” Harry asked. Blaise tilted his head. “Five? That’s perfect. I’ll see you at your home at five o’clock. Good bye.”
“At least someone had fun this weekend.” Ginny said. “Everyone’s fine. Just something to do with poison ivy and poison oak. The boys won’t tell me the specifics.”
“And why are you not rushing up to protect your son’s chastity and throw stinging hexes at his paramour?” Narcissa asked teasingly.
“No, no. Don’t sit in that seat, this is the best and most functional chair.” Remus indicated an old worn leather seat, which Harry sat in. “And I’m not your teacher anymore, call me Remus.”
Instead of a verbal answer, Harry cradled the back of his head and kissed him. Draco tensed up for a moment but relaxed into it when the other man didn’t pull away. The second he leaned in it was as if Harry had been holding back.
“They’re little kids. I don’t play with little kids.” James said stubbornly. Draco just raised an eyebrow.
He had been in the Great Hall eating breakfast wondering why Harry had rushed out. A minute later he had felt the coin Harry had given him warm up. Harry told him how Granger had created it and wasn’t that surprised it was her. It was brilliant after all. He had casually glanced at it and stopped breathing when he saw the code for Urgent on it.
Harry watched Ron like a hawk. Ron blinked a few times, looked at the floor, looked at him, then walked over to sit on his bed. He opened his mouth then shut it and then just stared at Harry’s bed. Harry sat gingerly on his bed across from the red head.
“It’s more than that, you wanker.” Harry said. “Now open your gifts and then I’ll get us some food.”
“Harry, I’m sorry but Mr. Shacklebot is on the line. He said it’s urgent.” A no nonsense looking woman said stepping out of a room across the hall.
“Fell in love with the food or Harry?” Blaise asked.
“Alright. You want me to wear it on my hand?” Draco asked.
And now, well now he was an adult, a war fastened to his belt, and a lifetime of guilt right along next to it.
that the wizard before him was a muggle-born, but it didn’t stop him from wishing he’d gotten to experience the book like Professor Wilson so clearly did. “Pride and Prejudice,” he began, his voice full of surprise. “I’ll say, I haven’t read this one in ages. It’s truly a classic.”
, Draco thought, though he wasn’t sure whom he was directing the insult at. Himself, for even mentioning such a thing to Harry, or Potter, who had mistakenly mentioned such information at the worst time. He rolled his eyes and began to turn away again, deciding that that day’s conversation with Harry Potter was over with.
"Draco, may I come in?" How was Harry's voice so clear, not a bit of worry lined any of his vocals.
Draco had chosen a simple breakfast for the day, beans on toast, as well as the ever-classic pumpkin juice it seemed no witch or wizard could possibly go without. Rather than waking early and rushing to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, he’d waited for his fellow peers to wake, deciding to join them instead.

To sulk.
He wondered what she thought the media was lying about, but he didn’t ask. If she chose to tell him, he’d know. And if she didn’t, he’d have one more question weighing on his shoulders. “Are you okay?”
"Draco, dear," she swished her wand and Draco's face cleared of any signs of weakness immediately.  "Draco, what's this all about?"
“I want to visit my parents’ graves.” It was sudden, and his voice was sharp, and he meant every word. He didn’t
He flung a brush through his hair, and threw his cloak over his clothes. Wincing at the wrinkles in his shirt, he tightened the cloak, hiding his under clothing completely. He made sure his arm was covered completely, before pocketing his book and tucking his wand up his sleeve.
"What's that got to do with it?"
bit out of him.
Harry knocked once more and Draco was able to confidently open the door and meet him, although he definitely didn't look him in the eyes. He was far too ashamed to do that.
As weird as that sounded, it meant taking them grocery shopping and looking at kittens. Going to bookstores and watching movies at theaters. And
"What do you mean theory," this was Hermione. She, unlike Ron, looked rather curious in his "theory" and Harry was grateful. Hermione always listened to him, even if she didn't agree in the end, she always listened.
He backed up, arms extended in front of him. His wand in one, the other going to protect Teddy.
His mother lay shivering in her bed, and Draco was by her bedside. A large storybook lay in his lap, and it looked even bigger than it was on his tiny body. He remembered grinning up at her every so often as he struggled his way through the fairytales, and he recalled the pained look on her face being replaced with a faint smile every time he did so.
He put the water to his lips and called his name one last time.
Draco’s brief moment of weakness had begun a strange and rather unlikely friendship between him and Harry Potter. A friendship that consisted of offhanded insults that almost always left either boy feeling some sense of self hatred and confusing conversations that were never solved due to extreme lack of communication. But a friendship nonetheless.
"And, Merlin, this is a terribly confusing story. When Hermione obliviated her parents memories and sent the to Australia, they conceived! So Hermione has a baby brother, but she finds him rather difficult because he's only about Teddy's age and so much younger that...
“I suppose that all depends on you, Mr. Malfoy.”
This chapter is long overdue, but I hope this made your wait worth it!
time Draco felt it was a normal amount of calm. It wasn’t eerily sweet, rather, just fine for normal conversation. It didn’t remind Draco of condescending adults or mock-understanding professors. It simply felt like a conversational tone, in which Harry was asking how he’d been and Draco was filling him with answers. Potter’s voice was
When he’d
"Bloody hell, Harry. You've come up with far more far fetched tales that turned out truthful," Ronald said, slightly exasperated. Hermione nodded beside him, though not unkindly.
-----
"Harry, dear." Mrs. Weasley started as she leaned against the counter in the kitchen, relieved to have a break from the cooking and cleaning she'd done so early in the morning. "Draco isn't coming then?" With those words, the entire room fell silent, eager to hear the story of the missing person.
How did he get here?
he didn't know why he’d been expecting something much worse. “Would, erm. Would Potions be a possibility?”
Had Neville been rude and harsh to Draco? Absolutely... not.
To Harry, the silence was easy as he was contemplating how to ask the questions he wanted. He wasn't like Draco. He didn't plan his conversations on paper, practice them in the mirror. He went for it. Always had, always will.
deserve even an ounce back?
he liked it, seeing as it was messy and completely idiotic. The boy never brushed it through, at least it didn’t seem like it. And it had no order whatsoever, it was just
“I just won’t go,” He said to himself, mentally preparing for when nearly forty teenage boys would walk through the dorm room door and see him.
"Draco?" Harry turned around to face Narcissa Black. Her face drained when she saw the state of her son. "Draco? Harry? What happened?"
Harry nodded, seemingly unable to speak, and went in for the hug that Draco was offering. “I’ve a question, Draco.”
Draco was thrown aback as Harry slammed himself down onto the Eighth Year table, throwing a few things onto the plate that appeared in front of him, and pulling a goblet of pumpkin juice  so forcefully that all of it nearly sloshed out. Hermione and Neville and Draco, along with every witch and wizard in the hall, goggled at the boy who seemed to be the embodiment of rage itself.
"Friends." Harry answered simply.
He tiptoed down the steps of the manor and made his way to the sitting room where Narcissa was sure to be, rocking soon to be two-year-old Teddy Lupin to sleep.
it was a muggle book, and he
"To hell with that, Potter! Is that all you mudbloods are good for? Lying!" Draco raised his voice, knowing Harry would react to his comment and he'd get some information. It worked, of course, but not how he liked.
If Teddy so much as heard another voice while he was trying to sleep, he'd try to morph himself to what he heard. And as Harry heard her say so many times within the past year, Mommy was not having it.
disrespectful?
Sitting down, he allowed himself to glance around.
They didn’t talk much, but Potter had thanked Draco for his help and bid him goodnight, and Draco had done the same.
“I only realized why I shouldn’t like Halloween a few years ago, in fifth year. Sirius told me, I hadn’t any idea beforehand.”
"Ginny wasn't even upset with me, we didn't talk about me or Harry or even Hogwarts!" Narcissa nodded her head, slowly and calmly, making Draco yawn as he continued telling about his day. "We just talked about stuff we liked, like normal people do. Neville talked about plants,  Luna talked about going on a holiday trip to find exotic creatures, and Ginny talked about the Holyhead Harpies.
, both. He wondered if Harry Potter would join in and lead the slaughter or watch from the sidelines, quietly cheering them on.
He dared not pick up his feet even an inch as he slid, literally slid, past Draco Malfoy's  bedroom. Despite him have lived in Malfoy Manor for almost two years, he and Draco could only say they were acquaintances.
confused him. It was not, death was painful. His mother, father, godfather, friends. All dead, all painful to think about.
Stopping himself, he debated finishing the sentence. Would opening up to Draco more than a surface level friendship backfire on him, or was Draco also emotionally damaged enough to understand his pain? Draco was one of the only people that saw Harry as human. Not as some god, or a saviour, but a human. Able to make mistakes and feel emotions.
“I don’t need anymore time to recover, seeing as I’m-” Draco widened his eyes as he realized that he couldn’t bear to finish the sentence. He
"Stupid girl!" He shouted at her, Pansy didn't even flinch. As a Slytherin, as a friend, acquaintance, of Draco, she was used to this.
"How long?" He asked Pansy. She was a few feet away, arms crossed and her expression worried. It was humbling to know a Slytherin could feel worried for someone.
“Are you alright, Malfoy?” Draco looked at her and nodded his head, hoping his eyes told the truth because he definitely wasn’t. She gave a quiet laugh, though he knew she found nothing funny. “You’re such a liar.”
But, he reasoned with his mind, this had a fifty percent chance of going very well! While Lucius Malfoy was rotting away in Azakaban for his crimes, Narcissa now fell into the category Mothers-Harry-never-had. Hopefully this  Malfoy would like him as well, maybe Draco would take after his mother.
As sad as it was, Draco fell asleep to the lovely thought of being an unrecognizable being, free to roam the world without the past to haunt him.
“Then I suppose you’ll just have to get accustomed to my anger.”
"I'm planning on, or asking permission to... move out?" Harry, nervous than Hermione during an exam, stared intently at his cuppa, not bothering to look at Narcissa.
And as he drove home from working, searching his stress-riddled mind for some sort of excuse that would grant him the option to return to his flat later than usual, he really wished that he didn’t love Draco Malfoy as much as he did.
if you made it to then end, thank you. and idk if you guys know this but im quite self conscious about my dialogue so if you could ignore the horridness you just read, it'd be great lol. next weeks fic chap will probably be a bit postponed seeing as this weekend is my birthday and i might not be able to work on it.
“Oi mate, are you alright?” Draco snapped his eyes open, his labored, yet quick breaths starting up again.
"Ginny... is dating Luna though," Hermione began, slowly, as if thinking through her words as she spoke them. "And you're saying Draco would contribute now. Meaning he didn't before... Correct?" She popped her head up, a smile growing across her face.
"Why would you invite me?" Draco retorted, although the effort wasn't anything like it used to be back at school. It was quiet, and somewhat kind.
Harry, who had been in charge of booking the hotels, was now looking at "Things Americans do for Fun." Hermione and him had decided that, rather than doing the normal "sightseeing, busy streets, crowded areas" thing, they should give their friends,
“That good, eh?” Draco asked, running a hand through his hair.
The professor took the camera out of his hands, probably not wanting his callous hands to break it.
It didn't matter what he did, did it? He would always be Draco Malfoy.
“So you’ve read them?” Draco asked with a hint of resentment and disbelief, though in his mind he was sitting at the edge of his seat.
usually got me tons of attention the first few weeks of school.” They were photographs, the square shaped papers. They were still photographs of the professor’s family it seemed, and in them, all sorts of foreign things Draco could only assume were muggle things.
“Five minutes,” he whispered. He gave a small bounce before flinging himself out of the door, knowing that if he didn’t do it then, he wouldn’t do it at all. He walked quickly and efficiently to the great hall until he hit the flood of human flesh.
“Well, we’ll put a silencing charm up, get your rest mate.”
When he sat down at the Eighth year table, a plate of food appeared before him. He wished so desperately that he could be allowed a few simple moments of peace, so that maybe he could read his lovely Muggle book and enjoy some breakfast, but he knew it was a lost cause. Peaceful breaks were something he wouldn’t be getting. After all, did he even deserve them?
(See the end of the chapter for
on the door when it flew open, and in the frame stood a rather tall man with lanky limbs and a kind face. “Why, you must be young Mr. Malfoy,” he said with a soft voice that calmed Draco’s nerves nearly immediately, despite being called “Malfoy.”
“Sirius Black’s birthday was November 3rd, 1959,” He stated, his voice a bit monotone as if he was reciting a rather boring piece of memorized text, which he supposed he was in a way. He looked up, focusing a bit back into the room, slightly surprised to see the eyes of most people around him were now staring at his own.
his book from Wilson’s arms, returning it to its rightful home in his robe pocket, where it’d be safe from harm. Unfortunately, it seemed rather rude, and he was
Draco Malfoy was standing back, watching it all happen before his eyes. This was the true magic, knowing something was happening in your body yet not realizing you were doing it.
"'S okay. I just, I'm not used to it, I guess."
To Harry, this wasn’t a game.
“I don’t really have anything in mind… anymore, Professor.” Draco said, embarrassed. “There aren’t that many options for- for me. Are there?”
"That's cool. I haven't spoken with Ron in forever." Harry said in an attempt to have a successful conversation with the other boy.
———————
“I don’t know who he is, Draco. But I don’t trust him.” Remus said leaning in towards Draco while eyeing Blaise who was just smiling.
“I would have never guessed.” Hermione said sarcastically. Harry pouted at them but didn’t negate that fact. He just wrapped both his arms around Draco instead.
“Why?” Draco asked, disgruntled.
“I have something to tell you.” Harry said slowly turning to look at him apprehensively. Ron frowned.
Board meeting 11 AM. Tomorrow. Thursday.” Hermione repeated back while writing it down in Harry’s calendar.
“Let’s go in and buy it.” Blaise said reaching for Draco’s arm.
“Something like that.” Scorpius said. “And you were right, I did come early to make my trip on time.”
“That doesn’t matter. What matters is I’ve succeeded and no longer need you. Now leave me and Draco alone.” Harry said.
“Remember that little charm I got you on one of our first dates?” Harry asked.
“Marriage?” She asked a little shrilly. Harry just nodded. “Oh, uhm, what did he say?”
“I do love you though. And I want to tell people.” Harry said sincerely.
For as handsome as the well dressed man is, he is easily over looked and forgotten. Even helping a half blind man crossing a busy road or catching a baby carriage before it rolled into traffic made him forgettable, but not the feeling of kindness for the man, nor the reprimand for the mother.
“Obviously no lie in, typical of kids,” Harry said, making Draco grin in agreement, “no working. It’s your birthday.”
“Now who’s making Abraxius roll in his grave?” Narcissa asked rhetorically. Lucius just pursed his lips at her. She gave him her full attention. “Does it really bother you?”
“I just want to be with you.” Harry said sounding pathetic to his own ears.
“Oh Harry! Sorry we’re so late.” Draco said as he balanced against the wall. Blaise was helping Draco take his snow boots off.
“First, I’m sorry for being short with you earlier this morning.” Harry started. Hermione smiled and nodded taking the apology. “Second, I’m in love with Draco.” They stared at each other, Hermione still smiling. “Which you knew, of course.”
“Sorry what?” Harry asked, looking between Hermione and Ron confused.
“I dunno. You look like you got yourself a present.” Ginny said from the opposite doorway. She flicked her wand and he grimaced at the cleaning charm that ran over him.
Harry jumped a little when Draco sat up. Apparently he had dozed off. Draco just smiled at him and ran a hand through his hair making him hum happily. Draco stood up and walked over to grab his bag. He then walked over to the Black ring box and took his ring off making Harry jump up.
“Come here you two.” Blaise said as he saw Albus about to explode. “I’m gonna show you the perfect snowball and the perfect throw.”
“There isn’t. It just annoys me.” Harry said.
“This must be a dream.” Draco said breathlessly.
“Get up and I’ll show you.” Scorpius said excited.
Just a reminder that this is based on an AU where Draco had nothing but his Potion Mastery and worked hard to earn his own money.
“Father!” Albus came running over holding Scorpius’s hand. Albus looked mad while Scorpius looked like he was about to cry.
“Yeah, Harry, he’s been perfectly pleasant.” Hermione said watching Harry like a hawk.
Mrs. McGonagall stared at him for a few seconds but then smiled and finally left the room. The butler smiled in amazement at Blaise and then quickly straightened his facial features. He quickly followed Mrs. McGonagall out.
“It’s a game we play. He pretends he’s never seen me before.” Blaise explained.
“You seem so out-doorsy.” Draco said, waving a hand trying to find the right word. Potter chuckled.

“You didn’t!” Draco said, as he gently opened the box.
“No, no. The blond man.” The man clarified.
———————-
Blaise had been in the drawing room with the children telling them stories. Harry hadn’t been in the best mood walking down the stairs so seeing that irritated him more. He felt like he was being replaced. In his own home.
“Congratulations.” Blaise said sincerely finally letting Draco’s hand go.
Draco set the glass ornament back in the box and opened the other one. He lifted out a solid star. Harry thought it looked kind of cartoony since the points were more rounded than straight but it was designer. In fact, it had the designers signature on the back, along with the Tiffany logo and the sterling silver stamp. He got it engraved as well with a simple H <3 D.
“Yes, well, more like acquaintances. They’re part of the committee to get the building up and running.” Draco explained. Fleur approached them to give them menus.
“Merry Christmas, love.” Harry said, after the tears stopped flowing and they just held each other.
“Bye Albus, Scorpius, James, Lily. Have a great day Draco.” Blaise said. Draco nodded and followed his children out, Blaise shutting the door behind them.
“Downstairs there’s a big bowl of punch.” Harry said.
“Tried to be witty. You look like you had a fun time.” Ginny said. “I am familiar with how you look after snogging someone.”
“Dracooooo.” Harry whined. Draco rolled his eyes but turned to look at Harry.
“Uhm.” Harry said looking bashful. Draco looked at him questionably.
“Harry, staying for dinner?” Narcissa asked. She kept from smirking at the slight panicked look. “I spoke to your mother.”
“They couldn’t throw a snowball before.” James said as he kicked at the snow, not looking at Draco. Draco handed Lily to Luna and gave James his full attention.
“Where are you going?” Draco asked.
—————————-
“I’m much older than you think.” Blaise said with a smile as he guided her to the couch. She stared at him as she slowly sat down.
“Good boy. Now close your eyes.” Harry said. Draco narrowed his eyes slightly but shut his eyes.
“My superior officers.” Blaise said.
———————————-
“I agree.” Neville said. “Too many people don’t stop to smell the roses. They’re trying to get somewhere too fast but they don’t know where. You two are the opposite. You know exactly where you want to go but you’re taking your time.”
A handsome, well dressed man is strolling the snow covered streets. The traffic is heavy but the foot traffic is even heavier in the city. It was only a few days until Christmas.
Santa honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
Thanks for reading!
“A massage?” Draco asked. “I’ve never had a proper one.”
“May I look at your hand?” Blaise asked.
“Isn’t it too early for presents, love?” Draco asked as he spotted a smartly wrapped gift box under the tree. Definitely not wrapped by Harry.
“Harry!” Remus exclaimed surprised as he opened his door. He ushered Harry in.
Malfoy usually did hourly sessions with his clients but since he didn’t trust Harry on his own he actually moved in for the duration of Harry’s recovery. Harry had been so angry about that but when Malfoy casually mentioned what Harry had done without any supervision suddenly all his friends were pro-Malfoy. It was annoying because Malfoy verbally treated him the same like they were back in school but his actions contradicted him. He’d be making fun of his hair while preparing his food and nutrition potions, or he’d sneer at him while helping him go through stretches as gently as possible to minimize pain.
“No, I came back this early to spend the whole day with you.” Scorpius said.
“How about we get some food?” Blaise said also watching James. He used a little angel magic to dry the worst of the moisture. James’ tense posture relaxed a little.
“Well, thank Merlin for small mercies.” Draco said with a smirk.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked a little breathless at being pressed up against Harry.
“When’s the wedding?” Luna asked curiously.
“Honestly, Harry.” Hermione said, once more dousing the flames. Zabini hid behind her at the look on Harry’s face.
“I don’t know what you are or where you came from or who sent you here. I just want you to hurry up with whatever you’re here to do because there’s no time to lose.” Harry said agitated.
“You’re a friend.” Draco said trying to find his keys. Blaise opened the door.
“I’ll believe it when it happens.” Harry said. Blaise then turned to face him.
“I am glad you knew about Fleur’s. It’s so nice to be back here.” Draco said looking around fondly.
“Well then isn’t it nice of you to pop out to the store and grab some and some food to eat.” Draco said as he sank back into the couch, tucking the cheque back into the envelope and setting it on the coffee table.
“Don’t you like me?” Harry asked with a pout.
“I’m afraid I can’t Minerva. I have a great deal of work to do.” Blaise said as he took the hand she held out. “But don’t keep Harry and Draco waiting.”
“I’ve been friends with Draco for a little while now.” Harry said as he walked into the room. “So poison oak and poison ivy?”
“Keep the soup warm, Harry had to take a phone call.” Draco said to Luna as she came to collect the barely eaten starters.
“And get a good dessert.” Draco said as Harry reached the door.
“Yes. He has seen happier days I admit. Do you know him?” Remus asked curiously.
“It’s a wedding band, Harry. We’re not married yet.” Draco pointed out.
When he approached the doors he saw Hermione pacing outside holding something. When she saw him she came over and dragged him away from the Hall into a quiet alcove, quickly putting up privacy charms. His stomach dropped at seeing a late edition Daily Prophet in her hand.
Before Harry could spiral deeper into self depreciation and think of ways to make it up to his boyfriend, Draco came out of his room wearing what Harry had bought him. All negative thoughts died when he saw the happiness radiating off the blond. Draco did a small spin for him to show off what he was wearing.
“I don’t trust people who chat unnecessarily.” Draco said as they headed up the steps to the front door.
“Nothing’s wrong. Calm down.” Scorpius said, patting his father’s shoulder. Draco fell back on the bed.
“What’s wrong?” Blaise asked.
“We’ll be right there, Luna.” Draco said not taking his eyes off Harry as Luna left the room. “Harry if only you could see your poor harassed face.”
“I won’t say no but all my presents have been wrapped so nicely. I’ll give you a four.” Draco said.
“The large house at the end.” Harry said to the driver as they got closer. “I trust you have money for the cab.”
“Good morning, Draco.” Blaise said as Draco walked the rest of the way down.
“I do. He’s a nice chap.” Blaise said with a straight face.
“What time was that?” Harry asked trying not to sound surprised.
“Just walk. Like we used to. We can shop and watch the ice skaters. And get lunch together. At Fleur’s.” Harry said. He relaxed under the happy smile Draco aimed at him.
“Yeah.” Harry said as he ran his free hand through his hair feeling awkward.
“Father.” Scorpius groaned. “This isn’t about me! It’s about you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Proof? Like a document? An angel needs no passport.” Blaise said.
“You usually have breakfast now.” Scorpius said. “But I’m guessing you decided to have a lie in.” He added sheepishly.
Come and trim my Christmas tree
“Yeah. I remember mud being a lot more fun when I was little.” Al said.
They were back in Draco’s flat sitting on the floor in front of the tree. Dinner had been delicious. Harry had felt like they were in a world of their own. It continued after they left the restaurant. They had leisurely walked the streets of London until it got a little too chilly.

“Who told you I asked for help?” Harry asked.
“They can’t be on my team!” James called from next to the fortress. Everyone laughed.
“I promise this won’t be fourth year again.” Ron said solemnly getting a half smile from Harry.
“Whenever you’re ready.” Draco said. Harry nodded. “Goodnight Blaise.”
“For why?” Draco asked, hesitant to take anything. It looked too good to eat. Potter poured syrup over Draco’s perfectly presented French toast and slid the plate and fork closer to him.
“This is...” Draco said as he ran his fingers over it.
Gossip rags speculated about every person who was spotted out with him. Thank Merlin for their teams personal PR manager. He had it on good authority that he was one of the favorites for PR because he was, as his team’s manager put it, a “triple threat.” He was already a celebrity, he was an actual skilled flyer, and, even though there were crimes committed during the war, he actually kept to himself and caused no trouble. It helped that he didn’t date. Been there, tried that, and been traumatized each time.
“But then it won’t be your special day!” Scorpius said. Draco chuckled.
Harry suddenly had plenty of energy to apparate back to London.
“Ah this? Reminds me of my childhood. But me and Severus bantering about the price is a yearly ritual for us.” Remus explained as Severus walked back over giving Remus a sour look.
“After all, I have you.” Draco said. Harry melted and squeezed the hand he was holding.
“Yes, But I’d like to stop by a few of the shops on Main Street.” Draco said. His stomach growled earning an amused smile. “Perhaps food first. Where did you have in mind?”
“That was something said in the heat of the moment.” Harry said.
“Fleur’s? It’s been years since we’ve been there. You mean it? You’re not busy?” Draco asked.
“I’m sorry for what I said and implied at our last meeting. I agree with the changes you want.” Harry said. Mrs. McGonagall blinked in surprise but sat on her couch, indicating for Harry to sit with her. He grabbed the wooden chair next to him and sat it right across from her.
“Make me.” Draco said airily.
Harry watched as Draco went up the stairs while Blaise watched him. Harry finally turned to look at Blaise. He took a few deep breaths and unclenched his hands from behind his back.
“Gin and Luna,” Potter said making Draco tense up, “with help from Bill and Fleur.” That made Draco relax.
“Ah Mr. Potter. Right on time. Simone will take your coats.” The man said as a smartly dressed house elf appeared. Draco turned slightly after giving Harry a look. Harry took the blond’s coat off for him and handed it to the elf. Draco did the same for him. “Please follow me, gentlemen.”
“Is there a problem with your place or are you trying to tell me something?” Draco asked.
“You’re a pain in my ass.” Draco stated. He kept talking before Harry said a perverted joke. “You go to your class and I’ll meet you back here.”
“Come on, Neville. Let’s go skating.” Blaise said before he got out of the car. Draco was already out watching the scene.
“Of course.” Harry agreed.
“Owlery.” Harry said almost harshly before storming off.
“Zabini?” Ron And Hermione asked at the same time.
“I wonder what Harry requested.” Hermione asked. She didn’t bother to read the rest of the letter since it just restated the ban that had been placed on the trio.
“Thank you, Luna.” Blaise said genuinely.
“He’s not supposed to be.” Narcissa said smiling fondly. “Being romantic, love?”
“You may because your prayer has been answered.” Blaise said.
After taking off their coats and shoes, Harry made hot chocolate with whipped cream. When he had entered into the living area the only light on was the string lights on the tree. He walked over and handed the drink to Draco. After sitting in the quiet room for a bit Harry gently nudged the blond.
“I’ll try to make this short.” Harry said.
“Scorpius,” Draco said fondly, “go back to the Potters. We can celebrate when you get back.”
“James says they’re not that good. We only take the best on our side.” The kid said snidely.
“Oh?” Draco asked. Harry nodded.
“Thank you.” Draco said after a moment. “James tries to act mature but then he does that.” Draco said making a vague gesture. “I think seeing all those toys in the windows on Main Street addled his brain.”
“The building must be built?” Blaise asked.
“I hope you have no appointments tomorrow.” Harry said conversationally.
“I love you too. Tacky scar and all.” Draco said.
“I’m not sure.” Harry said tiredly.
“What’s up, Mate?” Ron asked. Harry tilted his head and headed for the dormitory stairs, Ron following him up.
“Harry and I are going out today.” Draco explained.
“Alright. Are the children still up?” Draco asked as he went over to the stairs.
“Then I understand why you love it.” Blaise said. He looked up and saw a woman dressed as a fortune teller walk by holding cards. He got her attention and she walked over to hand him a card, then walked off. “Palm reading. Want your fortune told?”
“I will say this. Neither of us was expecting engagement.” Blaise said.
“I wanted to do that.” Harry muttered as he melted at the gesture. Draco grinned against his hand.
“Which one?” Harry asked curiously.
Once he healed and was discharged from the hospital, he had immediately hired the best physiotherapist. This man was renowned throughout Europe, mainly mainland Europe. Injured players clambered for this doctor’s attention. Harry knew he paid a small fortune for this guy but he felt restless and useless when not flying. Imagine his shock at having Draco Malfoy appear at his home and tell him he was his physiotherapist. The blond had given him a raised eyebrow and told him he could refund him most of his money but he’d take a small stipend for travel expenses. Harry had quickly shut that idea down and invited Malfoy in.
“Got myself a present?” Harry asked. Ginny shrugged her shoulders.
Harry startled as Draco suddenly stood up. The black box fell to the floor with a small thunk. Harry watched wide eyed as the blond disappeared into his bedroom. Harry felt a heavy weight in his stomach. He knew this was a bad idea. Of course the blond didn’t want something so opulent. He probably thinks Harry’s rubbing it in that he can afford things like this and Draco can no longer throw his money around.
-----
Even without his glasses he could tell he was in trouble.
That wasn’t his fault, he reasoned. He was too numb to really care about it, and everyone else was merely too kind to mention it. At least, that was what it seemed like. Potter's, of course, was intentional. Everything Potter did was intentional.
Drao’s eyes widened in surprise,
"Will... will you move in with me, Malfoy." Harry looked down as Draco took the ring box hesitantly. "Please... please, Draco?"
It was.
“Yes,” Draco answered softly, and his mind wandered to his regular window seat. Despite it being closer to the outside than any other seat in the common room, Draco felt as though it was the warmest. A spell must have been cast over the windows down there, stopping any cool air from coming in.
"Can I help you Draco?" Harry asked, his voice laced with annoyance. He couldn't help but be slightly aggravated at Draco's lack of reservation. He didn't understand how difficult it was to just... just answer.
"Peter? Neville!" Ron exclaimed, his eyebrows scrunched and his eyes wide.
A/N: Hello there!
"Oh, yeah. So, we'd be going as friends?" He looked back to his mother but wasn't surprised to see that she had apparated out of the room, probably quite some time ago.
of you. For your sacrifices.”
I'm sorry about this chapter! It's kind of a filler, and probably not that good! But nevertheless, I hope you guys like it! Thank you for all of the lovely comments on the last chapter!

and..." He sat on his bed, clearing away clothes by throwing them on the floor. He didn't notice his mother's eye twitch as he continued messing his already destroyed room. "And I can't tell if he seriously likes me or if he's just... just being forced by Luna or Hermione or something."
Draco smiled. If he knew one thing in this world, it was that Luna Lovegood was
“Sorry Mr. Pureblood, but I do believe we are.” And like that, Potter had apparated out of the library. Draco shook his head and stared with a puzzled look at the spot Potter had just vanished from.
Harry walked up the stairs in hopes of finding Narcissa and asking what she thought on the matter. After all, it was huge to Harry. Giving a second chance to a Malfoy like that.
“Professor.” Draco nodded his own greeting, and sat down at her desk. She was already sitting there, glasses on her nose and her classic bun still atop her head. “You wanted me?”
He was standing awkwardly to the side, quite a length away from the staircases, but he began to make his way over.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, figured as much. I haven’t either. The Dursley’s never let me, and Dudley always ate all of his candy. But somehow, I’d get ahold of a few pieces, I reckon it was a bit of childhood magic.” Draco nodded a bit absent-mindedly, still thinking about his tiny version of Halloween.
It was only a few minutes after Draco deemed himself full enough that Harry groaned in pain from all of the tarts. “Merlin’s beard, I’m stuffed.”
"Can't forget about Grawp." Ron said, his smile growing on his face. As upset as he was moments before, being compared to Sirius by Harry Potter himself, was an honor.
(("Weird" Things That Draco Malfoy Does Now That He's Trying To Change is a thing i wrote a few months ago when i was brainstorming for this fic, so i apologize if it isn't,,,, good? i might update it a bit so it'll be top tier for yall tho! ily!!!))
He was remembering Vincent Crabbe, who’d he’d grown up with from even before their days at Hogwarts. He was remembering how he looked when he’d died. How absolutely
"What does that even mean Malfoy?" Harry asked back.
Though he tried not to, he felt a sense of jealousy wash over him when he saw that the professor stared at the book like it was an old friend. He
“I-” he stopped, surprised when a single tear fell from his eye. He cursed himself for not being strong enough to hold them in, knowing just how much Draco hated crying.
He sighed as he realized how dumb that sounded. Yeah, I definitely wouldn't have been sorted into Ravenclaw.
"You're asking me?" Narcissa was finding the entire conversation humorous, she constantly found herself wishing she had personally known the boys biological parents so that she could have someone to compare the boy too. He was quite adorable.
"Who are they?"
All Harry had wanted to do was come to his two best friend's home, which they shared even though Hermione insisted is was nothing out of the ordinary, and get some reassurance on the Draco Malfoy situation he was having.
“I’m sorry, sir. I-”
It seemed a decision wouldn’t be necessary when Harry Potter answered it for him, stopping Draco immediately with a rough hand on his bony shoulder and a slight tug that turned him around completely.  “I’ve a question,” he whispered a bit, which Draco thought was simply odd, seeing as he had absolutely no problem yelling to the rooftops moments before.
"Oh," was all he said. "Oh, yes. That... that adds up. Y'know, makes sense."
He sniffed, and he felt his cheeks begin to burn too, he was
“All that time, celebrating like nothing was wrong.” Draco could tell that Harry was getting emotional, the cracks in his voice and small pauses were a dead giveaway. “My aunt and uncle never told me, but that’s expected, I guess. Dumbledore, he didn’t either.”
Eventually, when the silence became too great and the sounds of Potter trying to hold in his tears became too much to bear, Draco inhaled sharply and let the words roll off of his tongue.
"I dunno. I was reading upstairs. Pansy told me."
He's busy morphing his hand, he thought. Now is the perfect time to start a fight, bring it Pansy!
eat, it wouldn’t harm anything. What did it matter if his body got back into the swing of things, he’d have to do it the next day anyway.
could go with Weasley, Potter, Lovegood, Longbottom, and Abbott all the way to bloody America!" Draco's forehead furrowed as he darted his head side to side, taking in the clutter that filled his bedroom.
"It's only me." He reassured although he didn't think Draco was listening to him. "It's just Harry." He took his wand and put it in his back pocket.
"Anyway," Mrs. Weasley clapped her hands and wiped her eyes as quick as possible, not wanting to dwell on such sad topics for any longer. "Are you excited for the trip?"
- with one of peacefulness and of bliss.
He cleared his throat and hurried to startup a conversation before anyone started talking to either of them. "So. What made you decide to come Draco?"
Draco sighed and shook his head, placing it on his knees. Nothing was making sense. Everything he was thinking, he had no way of telling what was actually true. And though he was only thinking of hair, even
Draco darted up into a sitting position. "Ginevra Weasley knows?"
“Is that helpful?” He asked slowly, succumbing to the slight embarrassment being gawked at had on someone.
“Ron, he’s talking to you,” Hermione pointed out after a second, clearing her throat.
“Of course, Saviour.”
fine, that much was obvious, but the sudden inability to lie his way through the unwanted conversation would only bring that fact more into the light.
When he’d returned to class the following Monday morning, Potter hadn’t acknowledged their meetings nor anything Draco had said Saturday. He’d simply given a nod of his head and continued working with Ron Weasley, while Draco split his partnership with Neville and Hermione. He was grateful for the silence, but he was suspicious nonetheless, feeling as though at least someone had been told. There was no way Potter could keep a secret, Gryffindors were shit at such things. At least that’s what he told himself, because really, he only wanted a reason to be cross with the curly-haired boy.
Gone.
You're only fucking. And snogging. It doesn't need to happen 24/7, does it? He thought.
“Yeah,” potter said, off-puttingly. As if nothing had happened. As if Draco hadn’t seen the way Harry James Potter, the defeator of the Dark Lord, the boy who defied death itself, wither at the prospect of a full moon. “Perhaps it is.”
“Do you think they had planned something for his birthday? Do you think he drank in their memory or was he already incarcerated?” They kept walking, getting closer and closer to the graves. Harry was beginning to feel sick.
"Lovely, mother-" A long yawn interrupted his sentence, "-Luna Lovegood invited me to her and Ginevra's home."
“Never.”
A collection of “Here, here!” and whistles filled the room, and Draco felt his nose burn.
in general,” Said Draco cheekily.
was going to someone who couldn’t even return his feelings was enough to make him pale and shaky.
Things were changing, for the better. For Draco Malfoy, at least.
They didn’t speak a word as they were transferred somehow (Harry chalked it up to magic) all the way to Godric’s Hollow. Harry thought there would be a sense of familiarity when he finally came to the very first place he’d ever called home, but there was nothing, and he realized that hurt more than any nostalgic feeling he’d thought would happen.
They nodded and everyone went back to their conversations, understanding that Draco wasn't in the mood for much of a talk. He sighed and continued eating; he may have been uncomfortable, but it was nice to have people interested in you.
“H-harry?” Hermione was the first to speak, and she tentatively reached a hand out to comfort him, only to be glared at by the angry raven-haired wizard. She withdrew her arm and looked at him with concern, then turning her gaze to Ron, who shook his head with confusion and shrugged his shoulders. Hermione rolled her eyes but nodded and slowly, she tried to restart the conversation with Neville and Draco.
Lucius Malfoy raised a hand to strike his son. His idiotic, blood traitor son. The boy who houses Harry Potter and his bloody godson. The son who had every opportunity to kill Potter, to kill Dumbledore, to kill McGonagall. To help the dark lord.
“Yes, I suppose that
(See the end of the chapter for
“Such language doesn’t belong in the library, Potter.” Draco said playfully. He shook off his thoughts and simply allowed himself to be distracted by the playful banter they so easily assumed when they spoke to each other. Though he supposed he might have enjoyed a normal conversation every once in a while, it had only been a week since they began actually speaking to one another rather than shooting glares and insults. He had to admit, it was much better than having Harry whisper horrible things in his ears and snickering away.
“Harry, I didn’t come to your aid to do parlor tricks.” Blaise said.
“Is there a present today?” Draco asked.
“Father also said that with you here maybe we’d actually see dad.” Albus said, sounding a little snide about it. Blaise’s eyebrows raised in surprise at the tone.
“Out of ten.” Draco said. Harry glared at the blond. His glare lessened when Draco kissed him.
“Oh... Oh!” Hermione said in surprise. “So this morning with Zabini whispering in Malfoy’s ear... I don’t think there’s anything to it.”
“Of course.” Draco said as he headed to the front door. Luna helped them put their overcoats on and opened the door for them.
“Yes. That boy is way too precise in his flying. He could be a professional.” Lucius said distracted by the thought. Narcissa kissed his nose to get him to focus.
“Thank you?” Hermione asked. “Don’t forget you speak at the junior assembly at the Hotel McGonagall.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked. Draco quirked an eyebrow.
“Please do.” Draco said a little imploringly.
“Who are they?” Draco asked still staring at the table.
“Depends on what you use it for.” Harry said. He handed Draco an unsealed envelope. Draco opened it and it took him a second to understand what he was looking at.
“Your black trousers and white button up would have worked.” Harry said. Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “What?”
“Ron!” Harry said loudly in the quiet of the common room getting everyone’s attention. He hunched down a little but perked up when Ron immediately stood up to head over to him.
“Is it so bad?” Narcissa asked. Lucius let out a long sigh as he leaned back in his seat.
“Father.” Scorpius said embarrassed but turned to give his father a hug. Draco hugged his son to him and got a little misty eyed at the fact that his son was taller than his shoulders.
“Yes mother?” Draco asked, lifting his head up off his bed.
Whenever Harry started to get in his head his magic reacted. When he was agitated it felt like static electricity. When he was sad it felt like a thick fog. Draco didn’t know how he knew how to pull Harry out of his head but he did what he could.
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
“It’s a formula meant to dissect transmutation in a combination of potion and spell work to-“
“What is the meaning of this?” Mrs. McGonagall asked the surprised man.
“I can see that.” Hermione said smiling gently at the lovesick smile Harry had on his face.
“Well, obviously.” Draco said pompously. “Not that I’d give them the time of day, of course.”
“I sorta remember in school you had fur lined winter stuff. I hope you don’t mind that.” Harry said now nervous as the blond just stared at what he was holding.
“You promised though, Harry.” Draco said.
“I’m glad.” Draco said happily if a little confused as he and Harry sat on the couch, Minerva on the seat next to them.
“What’s this?” Harry asked as he turned the coin over in his hand.
“Running errands. I want you all to get home, dried, and warm.” Draco said as he kissed the top of each boy’s head.
“So you don’t think it a statement to the people that the new building is ‘for the wealthy?’” Mrs. McGonagall asked.
“You like?” Harry asked breathily. Draco beamed at him.
“That’s right. I’m here to take care of things and make sure Harry gets the rest and relaxation he deserves.” Blaise explained.
“Sorry, dad.” Albus said actually sounding sorry.
“Embossed and in calligraphy.” Draco deadpanned.
Blaise decided to do a whole routine that took up the entire skating pond. Everyone who had been skating stopped to make room and watch. Before he knew it, Draco was part of the routine. He had no idea how he did most of the steps he did but he did them without falling.
“You need a shower.” Father said. Scorpius rolled his eyes.
“Lucius! They’re not even out of school.” Narcissa chastised. Lucius looked unrepentant. “I’m going to check on them.”
Thanks for reading!
“Did you compromise your principles?” Blaise asked.
“Hm?” Harry hummed.
“Never mind those, that’s work for a bookkeeper not an a-angel.” Harry stuttered.
“Of course.” Blaise said.
“Anytime.” Potter said happily. Draco felt very awkward as the other man just sat there looking at him. He wasn’t sure what to do.
——————————-
“Wow.” Someone said startling both of them.
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
“Yeah. Yes.” Draco said, and then corrected himself, as he rubbed his eyes. “It is Saturday after all. And you are supposed to be enjoying the day with the Potters.”
“Why?” Draco asked confused.
He entered the room and glanced around. He heard a harp strum and turned to see a beautifully ornate harp. It was well taken care of. He started looking around the room when his eyes fell on a beautiful box inlaid with mother of pearl. He tried to open it but it was locked so he coaxed the box to unlock.
The type of fur I imagined for the robe was like angora rabbit fur or something along those lines.
———————-
“I love you too.” Draco responded. “But are you hungry?”
“Then I get to see his face when you tell him the other thing.” Hermione said pointedly at Harry.
“You’re a barbarian.” Draco said and inhaled sharply when Harry straddled him.
“Alright.” Blaise said trying not to laugh at the bratty behavior. It amused more than annoyed him.
“Of course it looks good. It’s me.” Ginny said, grinning without opening her eyes.
“Well, I didn’t.” Harry said bitterly.
“We’re having dinner, won’t you join us?” Draco asked. Harry looked disgruntled.
Harry walked passed him to the front door. He turned to look at Blaise, who was watching him. When he stepped out the door he turned to see Blaise turned away and looking up the stairs. Harry glanced up but saw nothing. Blaise just looked back at him and waved the index cards at him. Harry finally left staring through the front door suspiciously until he was gone from view.
“I’m guessing that the outfit my mother gave me would be perfect for dinner then.” Draco said sardonically.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve had enough camping to last me several lifetimes. I’d rather be here.” Potter said while looking at him with a charming smile that made Draco blush. He cleared his throat.
“No ones perfect.” Lucius said and jumped when Narcissa made a loud noise. “Cissa?!” He asked startled.
“Well I was aiming for that.” Harry said as he leaned in to kiss the blond but Draco turned his head getting a kiss on the cheek.
They pulled up to a very elegant mansion. Blaise got out of the car, letting Harry out. Harry looked back at Draco as he straightened his jacket out.
“Draco.” Blaise said. Draco immediately turned to look at him. “My work here is almost finished. I’ll have to be moving along.”
“First...” Harry glanced around them. Hermione rolled her eyes and waved her wand throwing up her most powerful soundproof charm.
“I like arithmancy.” Draco said. Harry always complained about it, which affronted him the first few times.
“He said he’s an angel.” Harry said and then looked around. “Usually something tries to stop me from saying it.”
“Well, I love Draco.” Harry emphasized the ‘I’.
—————————-
“They threw a curve!” The kid from earlier yelled excitedly. He then ran over and grabbed both Albus and Scorpius. “You’re on my team!”
“Will you marry me, Harry?” Draco asked solemnly while looking into his eyes.
“Uh huh. Then why does it seem like everyone knows something I don’t?” Draco asked. “And why did we eat dinner on Christmas Eve instead of having it tonight, like in past years?”
“It means Blaise was here.” Harry deadpanned.
“Yes. I canceled my appointment. Are Draco and the children home?” Harry asked.
“And you will be doing what?” Albus asked suspiciously crossing his arms and raising an eyebrow. Albus had more of Draco’s mannerisms than Harry’s, which amused Draco.
“Your tree will be delivered Christmas Eve.” Severus said turning his attention to Draco and handing him a slip of paper.
“Well, this card index file seems to be an awful mess. I think I’ll reorganize these.” Blaise said.
“I’ll explain later.” Harry said as he rushed out of the Great Hall.
“I love you, Harry Potter.” Draco said in all sincerity.
Harry Potter was standing in the doorway of the informal dining room staring at Draco in awe. Draco looked at Scorpius in question as his son looked at him sheepishly. He then realized he was in his pajamas and house robe while they had a guest and gave Scorpius a different look.
“There’s certain attention I like, especially attention that I dictate.” Draco said from inside the bathroom. “Did you see their faces?”
“Oh Harry! Where were you?” Draco asked as he went over to hug and kiss Harry.
“Harry says you were muttering about an Arithmancy problem?” Draco asked as he started eating what Harry had dished out for him. He absentmindedly kissed Harry’s cheek in thanks while Hermione launched into her problem.
“You should have seen everyone’s faces when I walked arm in arm with Zabini. It’s almost like no one has their own lives and can’t mind their own business.” Hermione said a little loudly. Draco saw a lot of people who had been gaping at them suddenly turn away to focus on their own plates.
Harry let out a relieved laugh as he pulled one of the rings out of the box. Even though Draco had said yes already, asking again had suddenly become nerve wracking. He set the box to the side and slid the ring onto Draco’s left ring finger, the ring automatically adjusting to fit. He went to kiss the blond but Draco suddenly pulled away from him making him frown in confusion.
“And you’ll have to tell the boys.” Ginny pointed out.
——————————
He came back and felt so much love at the moment. Draco was sitting on the floor in front of the tree just looking up at it. Harry had plugged the tree in before the blond came home so the lights made everything more dreamlike. He set the plates of food on the dining table and walked over to Draco. He sat down next to the blond and wrapped his arm around him. His boyfriend cuddled next to him and let out a content sigh.
“Just like that?” Draco asked. Harry nodded. “And when I’m attacked?”
“We could get food after.” Blaise pointed out.
“Bye Blaise.” Albus said as he tugged Scorpius out the door, James followed after with the baby carriage, Lily waving her arms once again.
“Albus.” Draco said tiredly as he walked down the stairs, a boy a few years older than the two carrying a little girl with red hair right behind him.
“Hence the not abysmal.” Draco said amused. Blaise chuckled as he helped Draco out of his overcoat and boots.
“If this is your way of telling me you’re going to propose in the most public way you can...” Draco started. Harry shook his head.
“No! I thought this was extremely shiny silver! And you marked it with a lighting bolt?” Draco said scandalized. “Cheeky bastard.” Harry relaxed when Draco kissed his cheek.
“Bedroom.” Draco gasped as he groped for his wand and held Harry to him as he apparated them directly to his bedroom.
“Alright, fine.” Narcissa said. “But be nice.” Lucius drew himself to his full height.
“You know this just confirms the rumor about you three being in a three way relationship.” Neville said teasingly. That made all three of them start laughing.
“Why is he tied up?” Draco asked.
In the box was a set of seemingly simple looking wedding bands. It was the spells and enchantments that made the rings special, especially if the wearer had a tie to the Black family. Harry didn’t know that aspect but he knew the Black family name was important to both him and Draco.
“Should I start saying “Honey, I’m home” when I return?” Draco asked as he walked in the door.
“I think you stood up to her wonderfully.” Draco said.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. Harry let out a tired sigh.
“Probably.” Blaise said as he sat down next to Draco. He wiggled his fingers at Lily making her giggle.
Merry Christmas Eve everyone!
“That’s wonderful Harry!” Hermione said as she hugged her friend. “You know I’ll have to meet him.”
“Merry Christmas.” Harry said.
“I told you I’m not leaving the house. And I don’t trust a masseuse enough.” Draco said getting annoyed.
“Tried to ignore it. Was it that bad?” Draco asked.
————————-
“I thought that was your idea.” Harry said furrowing his brow in confusion. Draco sighed and finally got out of Harry’s hold to lay next to him.
“Well tell the boys all about him. James is trying to convince the younger ones that Santa isn’t real. I’d like for them to believe for as long as possible.” Draco said.
“Yes.” Harry said miserably. Draco canceled the ties around Harry, who immediately scrabbled up and wrapped his arms around him.
“Best Christmas.” Draco said with a content sigh. “Although, there is one thing that would make this even more unforgettable. We could make it a new Christmas tradition.”
“Oi! Why are you taking it off?” Harry asked, quickly walking over and keeping Draco from putting the ring back in the box. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“This must be James and little Lily.” Blaise said. James nodded at him as Lily waved her arms.
“Pansy has been wanting to have a summer together.” Draco said thoughtfully.
“If you’re referring to me as “stupid things” then yes, you do do stupid things.” Harry said with a wink. Draco’s eyes narrowed as he grimaced and pulled away.
The blond man approached a shop with many Christmas trees outside. It was typically a florist/herb shop but for the holidays it was the go-to place for the freshest Christmas trees. The blond looked around, inspecting each tree, until he found the perfect one. He walked in the shop and raised an eyebrow at the scene before him.
“It’s really late so probably not.” Harry said still watching Blaise.
“Well that could have gone better.” Harry said as he headed back to the drawing room, Draco following after him after shutting the door.
“If this is your way of proposing though, I don’t know if I should say yes. I’m not even wearing a ring after saying yes.” Draco said looking at his bare left ring finger.
James stared and pouted at the ground. Draco just shook his head and stood up only to hug James. James grunted and tried to get away but Draco just held on tightly. Albus and Scorpius ran over to them.
“I’ll join you. He’s going to take it better than you think.” Hermione said in a matter of fact tone.
“Draco and I had a wonderful time.” Blaise said.
I wonder if there’s wizarding cruise lines.
“Gone.” Harry said walking out of his office.
“Always a charmer, Severus.” Remus said getting a narrow eyed look.
“Right. Yes.” Harry said burying his face in Draco’s chest. “I knew that.” He looked up into Draco’s eyes when his jaw was held.
“Did they? We had drinks with Professor Lupin. And we had lunch at Fleur’s.” Draco said happily. “Are the boys in bed yet?”
Harry reluctantly conceded after Malfoy explained how he’d never fly again. That reaction wasn’t good enough for the blond, who let it be known in the fiercest scowl Harry’s ever seen. He ended up full heartedly conceding when Malfoy threatened to call Ginny, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and even his own mother, Narcissa Malfoy. Two of them together was bad enough but all four actually put fear in him.
“No.” Draco moaned and seemed to cling harder to Harry. “The frenetic energy messed up things in the back. I don’t want to move.”
“I like cooking and considering how fast fruit goes bad it’s easier to just turn it into jam.” Potter said. “Do you want me to feed you?”
“You speak French... abysmally.” Draco commented. Blaise looked offended.
“Massage?” Harry practically growled in his ear making him quiver.
Thank you everyone who’s read this. I hope that it brought a bit of joy to you.
“Right.” Draco said. He hummed when Harry kissed him one last time. The other man reluctantly let him go.
“That price is too high. Its even missing limbs.” Remus Lupin pointed out getting a sneer.
“Oh?” Harry asked as he stared at the blond’s lips.
“I would have loved to. I need to speak to Blaise.” Harry said.
“Before you leave, take this.” Remus said reaching into his pocket and pulling out an antique coin. “It’s not much but it started me on my career path to teaching history. It hasn’t been of much use these days though.”
“Can we serve dinner? If we wait any longer the chicken will over cook.” Luna said from the doorway.
Harry walked with no hesitation into the Hall and walked over to his usual spot. He grinned at Hermione who had sat next to Ron. She usually avoided sitting next to the red head since she’d end up with bits of food on her book or homework or notes.  Harry waited for Draco to sit down first and then sat down himself.
“Father! Father!” Scorpius ran over looking disheveled, an equally disheveled Albus behind him. “We won!”
“What are you saying, Blaise?” Draco asked.
Draco had a free period after Arithmancy so he was sitting in the Great Hall in study hall. He was going over his notes ignoring Blaise who had slipped in to sit next to him. He was a little stuck on a problem when Blaise spoke up.
“Come now, Harry. We’re very old friends. You must call me Minerva.” She said as she looped her other arm through his and led them across the front hall to the East Drawing Room. Draco and Harry had flabbergasted looks on their faces as they walked with her.
“Don’t you dare.” Draco said coldly. Blaise just grinned cheekily at them.
“I’m sure Hermione knows?” Harry questioned. He knew what Draco was talking about and getting at.
“What would that be?” Draco asked trying to think what thing he’s always wanted. Scorpius stood up and tugged on his arm.
“Draco Malfoy, will you go out with me?” Harry asked.
“Yes. He was never big on French food but he brought me here on our first date. I fell in love.” Draco said.
“Oh I very much want. Do you?” Harry said.
Been an awful good girl
“Thanks.” Harry said as he turned to look over his shoulder at the blond. He leaned into the kiss but pulled away since it was an awkward angle for his neck. “I’ll see you later tonight.”
“I’m sorry Draco. I found out I have appointments today.” Harry said feeling terrible as the smile fell off Draco’s face.
“I asked him to marry me.” Harry said. Hermione almost dropped her book in surprise.
“What good is this? It’s useless.” Harry said as he tossed it on the table. Draco tried to not let his smile fall.
————————-
“No reason to worry about them.” Blaise reassured. Draco blinked a few times seeming to come out of a daze.
“Did you even leave?” Draco asked as he came through his door, once more to Harry.
“You...” Draco started without looking away.
“What? Oh! Merry Christmas to you too Mrs. McGonagall.” Harry said.
“This smells familiar.” Draco said, still keeping his eyes shut. “Is that a string quartet?” Harry chuckled.
“Yeah. I thought you weren’t supposed to come back until tonight. What happened?” Mr. Potter asked in that way where grown-ups try to be neutral but you can still hear the accusation in their voice.
“All over.” Blaise said.
“Erm.” Harry said as the blond placed more weight on him. “Do you want me to carry you to the couch?”
“Huh starting to believe in me?” Blaise asked as he walked closer.
“I think they get it, love.” Draco said dryly. “Harry’s slightly possessive.”
Harry stared at Blaise suspiciously as he got back in the cab. Blaise simply smiled at him from the window. Harry watched as the cab drove away and made his way to the door.
“I guess the meeting with Mrs. McGonagall was more important than Harry thought.” Draco said sadly.
“All you had to do was walk over to the bed.” Harry pointed out as he ran a hand through the blond’s hair.
“Hey come on! They’re passing out the medals!” The kid with the crown came over and dragged them back to the play area. Draco watched as James slowly tromped over to them.
The man stood across the street looking at a blond haired man who was looking in a shop window. The man at the window gazed longingly at a well tailored, If slightly gaudy jacket. The blond sighed and walked on. The well dressed man followed.
“I’m tired of wandering. I’m tired of an existence of neutrality.” Blaise said as he stepped closer to Draco. Draco took a step back.
———————————————-
“Yes really.” Harry said amused. He walked over and kissed the top of Al’s head getting an annoyed grumble. “You should probably get some rest. I’m assuming the Muggle way of healing is your punishment.”
Harry leaned up to kiss Draco hungrily. Draco grunted but gave as good as he got. They rolled around the bed snogging each other senseless. They only pulled away from each other to breathe.
“But seriously, lets tell everyone.” Harry said pulling away from Draco.
“He’s not. He’s dating me.” Harry said scrunching his nose up in annoyance.
“It’s fine. Wondered what had you so snippy but won’t press you ‘bout it.” Ron said as they entered the boy’s dorm. He watched Harry curiously when Harry checked the room and then locked and soundproofed the room.
———————-
“Oh because of that rumor with Zabini?” Neville asked. The arm around him squeezed him a little.
“I... that is, can you repeat that?” Draco finally said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was a recent development.” Draco said. It had taken five years of friendship between their boys for them to even be on a first name basis. “Hang on. If you’re here then who’s hosting your camping trip?”
“I’m telling you because I’m a terrible boyfriend.” Harry said. Before Hermione could reassure him he kept going. “Even though we’ve kept our relationship to ourselves he’s told his mother. His mother, Hermione! That’s like the step before meeting the parents. And I’ve told no one close to me. I mean, who does that? People who want to keep their relationship hidden due to it being a dirty little secret! I don’t want that! I want the opposite of that! I want to tell the whole world!”
“I was aiming for a relationship.” Harry said, starting to kiss Draco’s neck. “A romantic sexual one with domesticity.”
“Oh Harry, my name and those I love have been dragged, drowned, and obliterated in the mud. I can handle it. I worry for you.” Draco explained as he went ahead and put the ring back on his left ring finger.
“Do you two often have silent conversations in the middle of the corridors?” Blaise Zabini asked with a raised eyebrow. His other eyebrow raised in surprise at the look he was getting from Harry.
“Put it on me.” Draco ordered and handed the necklace to him. Harry almost dropped it not expecting the necklace to be shoved in his hand but caught it as Draco turned his back to him.
Draco beamed at him as he grabbed the other ring. Harry almost smacked the ring out of Draco’s hand in his excitement, prompting Draco to hold his hand to put the ring on. Once the ring resized itself, Draco brought his hand up and kissed his knuckle right above the ring.
She called for her portable floo, it was just a floating fire but it was so much better than kneeling at the fireplace. So undignified. And threw a pinch into the fire calling the Potter residence. It had been a few days since she’s chatted with Lily Potter.
“They wouldn’t get a rise out of me that easily.” Harry said. He didn’t like the narrow eyed look he was getting.
“Well then for my birthday I want you to go have fun on your camping trip.” Draco said.
“It’s passable but you are undeniably not French.” Draco snarked.
“Too bad. He’s such a nice fellow, if a little unorthodox. Of course it would take an angel to put me to work.” Remus said with a chuckle.
“I was excited.” Harry said as he hugged and kissed his boyfriend. He swayed them when Draco returned the embrace.
“Good for anytime.” Harry said. Draco stared down at the tickets.
Thanks to Harry’s seeker reflexes he caught a small package before it landed in his scrambled eggs that an owl dropped in the morning mail rush. A letter with the distinct Gringotts wax seal was attached. Harry quickly pocketed the box and read the letter. He winced a little after reading it and then realized Ron and Hermione were staring at him. He handed the letter to Hermione as he stood up.
“Blaise.” Minerva said as she turned to them. Draco smiled happily as he stepped closer to Minerva. Harry tensed up.
“It’s platinum-“
“What?” Draco breathed out, freezing in Harry’s hold.
“Okay, so why are you telling me?” Hermione asked actually confused at where this was going.
“Are you sure you’re an angel?” Harry asked suspiciously. He didn’t like the way the angel was looking at his husband.
“I was too busy snogging you in victory.” Harry said smiling at the memory of catching the snitch, flying over to the family stands where Draco had walked over to the edge while casually taking off his jacket, and then grabbing him to snog him in excitement. He was excited for his victory and seeing Draco in his jersey did things to him.
“Poor man, he said he had so much work to do. Harry, you must let him rest.” Minerva said imploringly.
“Forgive me for my lateness. I got hung up with Christmas shopping. Is the meeting going well?” Draco asked politely. An elegant elderly woman gave him a pinched look while looking down at blueprints.
“Were noveou riche and are the newest in the Sacred 28.” Narcissa said.
“And what’s more, turns out it’s a museum piece, worth a fortune.” Remus said. He held Harry’s arm when the man tried to give it back. “You keep it. Give it to Draco as a Christmas gift. Perhaps it will bring you both luck. This might sound terrible, me being a broken down professor and you being the new and youngest Head Auror, but I feel sorry for you. I wish there was something I could do to help.”
“Because you’re a thief! You tried to steal my husband, my children, my life, my everything.” Harry said angrily.
“Are we hugging James?” Scorpius asked happily. Without waiting for a reply he joined in. Draco smirked as James mumbled annoyed but didn’t struggle away. He finally let go.
——————
“Remember how I’d appear at your window on a broom? You’d lean out the window while I gazed upon your lovely visage.” Lucius said.
“Then tell him to stop flirting with you.” Harry whined.
“Why would you think that?” Blaise asked. Harry gave him a look but handed him some money. When Blaise kept staring at him he gave him a little bit more.
———————————-
“I’m sure I can move things around. But I promise we’ll go out.” Harry said. Draco was about to say something else when Hermione appeared.
“Are you saying Harry was on his broom at our son’s window?” Narcissa asked.
Blaise gave Harry a meaningful look as he turned and walked away. Harry side eyed Blaise as he walked towards the door to his office and then turned to face the fireplace. He approached the fireplace, staring down.
“Love?” A voice asked behind her. She pulled her head out of the floo and saw Lucius with a bemused expression walk in. She put her head back in the floo.
“Yes. Just a rumor. Me and Draco are together.” Harry stated.
“You didn’t actually say the word ‘yes.’” Harry pointed out earning a flat look from Draco.
“You’re a good man Harry. You were heard.” The man said walking to the other side of the fireplace mantel. “I was instructed to come here.”
“You’re still here.” Harry said.
“Draco. I don’t want to leave.” Blaise said.
“Oh hush you. You’re adding to the rolling.” Lucius said while throwing a weak glare at his loving wife. She just gave him a cool smirk that turned into a smile when she glanced out the window.
“Well, I figured there was someone. Not Malfoy, mind you.” Ron started his face kind of scrunched up. “It probably won’t sink in until I see it.”
“How should I know?” Harry said.
He jerked his head up and scrubbed his hands over his face. He then looked around his office as if he was supposed to be doing something. He walked out of his office. When he looked at the stairs he suddenly ran up.
Santa baby, so hurry down my chimney tonight
When Harry was well enough to not need Malfoy around daily he was dreading the day the blond would move out. He tried to hide how he felt but of course the blond could read him like a book. Instead of calling him out on it, Malfoy mentioned how convenient it was to have a place that felt centralized to all the locations he tended to frequent. He had side eyed Harry as he said something about finding living accommodations in the area. Harry tried not to show his eagerness when he said there was more than enough room and the blond was welcome to stay. Malfoy had eyed the decor disdainfully, like he often did ever since he had moved in, so Harry said he could furnish however he wanted. The blond’s eyes practically glittered in delight. Harry’s legs felt like jelly at the grin he got. He had been glad he was sitting.
“Yeah.” Draco said, and then bit his lip as he scooted even closer to Harry. “There’s something else that makes me feel like that.”
“Why?” Draco whispered.
—————————————————
“Are you happy?” Hermione asked.
“Yes, your majesty.” Harry said sarcastically back as he brought the necklace over the blond’s head and was happy that he chose a thicker necklace with a large clasp.
“Cissy?” A voice asked as the red haired woman came into focus.
“You are having some problems in the building of the Auror office.” The angel stated.
“Ah Draco doesn’t know.” Narcissa said.
Draco let out a small shout and then squawked when Harry smacked his arse on the way to the bedroom.
“Draco’s going to be coming down soon. Don’t let him see you like this. Try to calm yourself.” Blaise said as he walked over to the door. He opened it and walked out smiling, shutting the door behind him.
“Where’s Blaise? The boys want to hear a story from him.” Draco said as he looked in Harry’s office. “Where is he?”
“Well I was having a lovely weekend. So your experiment better be worth my worry.” Harry lightly scolded.
When he opened the box there was folded sheet music in it for the harp. He read the small note at the top of the page and raised an eyebrow in surprise. This was a love note from a man that wasn’t Mrs. McGonagall’s late husband.
“I don’t know. Holding hands is so intimate. That may be going too far, Potter.” Draco said looking down at their hands and then looking up at Harry with a mischievous look. “Not to mention that the majority of time when we’re holding hands one of us is usually balls deep in the other.”
“Well, I mean- That is-“ Harry started to stutter out. He stopped talking at the amused look he was getting. “I got you something.”
“You what?” Draco said quietly.
“You will do no such thing. Now stay here while I go get your fiancé to calm you down.” Hermione said very calmly. In the type of voice one would use that should someone not listen it would mean instant death.
“Yup.” Harry chirped as he loaded his plate with food and loaded Draco’s plate with some of his favorites.
“I’m just so proud of you.” Draco said earnestly. The blush on Scorpius’s face grew.
“How would I know?” Harry asked confused.
Narcissa sighed delicately as she looked up from her book. She felt a minute shift in the wards that could have signaled a small creature, if she was ignorant. She knew the “slight” disturbance was heading towards her son’s room. She thought about what she should do.
“Yes.” Harry said frowning as he pulled Draco back down. He grunted at the weight but didn’t let go. Draco frowned back and tried to at least lay on the bed instead of on Harry.
“Wouldn’t you rather spend time with me? Harry asked.
Harry was walking to the Great Hall for dinner. He thought about skipping and just heading to his and Draco’s room but he knew the blond would be in the Great Hall. He had barely seen the blond today since they had no classes together. He was hoping to run into him outside the Great Hall to hug him or kiss him or hold his hand or all of the above.
Harry tried reading the newspaper but it wasn’t holding his attention. He stood up and started pacing. He decided to see what was happening in the kitchen. He heard the front door open and immediately went to see Draco.
“Why, there’s blue in your eyes.” Blaise said entranced but continued. “I see a man who loves his family. I see a man who’s adored. I see a rich full life.”
“Hmm?” Draco asked coming out of a daze.
“You must be tired.” Harry instead of negating that fact.
She only released Harry when she had to go the other way to the library. When Harry shuffled his feet she snapped her hand up to point down the hall. He looked at her with big eyes, making her roll her eyes. She gently bopped his head with the book.
“The cold never bothered me anyway.” Blaise said. Luna pushed passed him into the closet.
“So, what’s that?” Blaise asked. Draco responded without looking up.
“No.” Hermione said.
“You’re going to get Scorpius to spend as much time with Al so you can shag his dad.” Ginny stated.
“I thought you got all your presents.” Hermione said.
The door opened and Hermione looked in, a pile of books at her feet. Harry raised an eyebrow while Ron just looked at the books then at Hermione. Hermione walked in the room and shut the door, putting the spells Harry had cast back up.
“Was I That bad?” Harry asked making Blaise laugh a little but shake his head.
“Isn’t it?” Draco asked. Scorpius gave him a flat look. “What?”
“Divine intervention or him?” Remus asked curiously.
“Are you hungry?” Draco asked Harry. Harry nodded. “Do you want to go in the Great Hall or to the kitchens?”
“We can tell the world if you want. But only if you’re sure.” Draco said running a hand through Harry’s hair.
“Look at this.” Remus said as he held the bottle up for Harry to see. He poured the liquid into two glasses but when he held the bottle up it was still full. “This Sherry was of substandard quality but it was passable. Now it’s delicious, it stimulates, and it does the complete opposite of inebriate, no matter how much is ingested.”
“What can I say? You bring out the best in me.” Draco said condescendingly. “So?”
The paper suddenly burst into flames getting a sigh from Hermione who quickly doused the flames. Harry was just staring at the area where the paper had been. His hands slowly closed into fists as he looked at Hermione to explain.
“It was straight from my heart! I want you to go.” Harry said harshly.
“I don’t think you’re an angel.” Harry said. “I think you’re a demon right out of He-“
Harry sat in his seat on the couch as Draco crouched down and picked up the small flat box adorned with a large gold bow. The blond sat down next to him and lifted the lid up. He lifted two flat rectangular pieces of paper out of the box.
“You won’t be.” Harry said with an edge to his tone. Draco hummed.
“Oh! Merry Christmas, Draco.” Hermione said in surprise as she opened the door.
“You’re already dating him? Wait you managed to ask someone out?” Ron asked.
“You asked Malfoy. To marry you.” Ron said slowly. Harry nodded. Ron looked at Hermione who also nodded.
“Nothing! I just...” Draco sniffed and rubbed at the corner of his eye while not looking at Harry. “I just love it. Thank you.”
“Right. Thanks.” Harry said, always forgetting that Luna and Draco were related.
—————————
“Yup.” Harry said unrepentant. “Aren’t birthdays great?”
Let's see if you believe in me
————————
“Well then, no time like the present.” Blaise said as he indicated for Draco to lead the way.
“You deliberately stopped me from joining you.” Harry said.
“I had great respect for Mrs. McGonagall but it feels like this is a monument for her late husband. I understand wanting to honor those you love but there are actual ways to do that.” Harry said as he stood up to pace.
“He found me.” Harry said staring hard at the coffee table.
"Thank you. For the breakfast." Draco said.
“Yes, that’s for the party tomorrow night.” Draco said.
“Good morning, Blaise. Lovely day.” Draco said happily as he walked over to Harry.
Harry pulled a velvet pouch out of his pocket and put it in the hand that was still holding Draco’s. He couldn’t help himself and kissed the blond on the lips. He felt Draco startle a little but he leaned into the kiss. Harry pulled back and grinned when his boyfriend tried to follow him.
Sign your "X" on the line
“How do you do, Draco?” The man asked prompting Draco to stop and look at him. “I’m Blaise. I’m going to be helping Harry with his work.”
“Of course I’d take you! Who else would I let rub suntan lotion on me? The boat captain?” Draco asked. “Well, if he’s handsome.”
“I think you should go.” Draco said.
“That was nearly forty years ago. You couldn’t have known him.” She stated.
“Right. Habit.” Harry said as he leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees.
“Ah.” Harry said as he ran a hand through his hair and just grinned.
“Looks good, Luna.” Harry said.
“Yes. How did you know?” Blaise asked as he approached them. Scorpius, the spitting image of his father Draco, hid behind Albus.
“I know I did.” Harry said shortly. Draco glanced over at Blaise.
Wouldn’t it be the best to have someone financially support you, besides yourself, just so you have that comfort? Draco living the dream.
“I don’t just want to nod hello at you in the halls or say a word or two in passing. I want to hug you and kiss you. I want to hold your hand while walking with you.” Harry said squeezing the hand he was still holding. He liked the happy smile starting to form on Draco’s face.
“Who?” Draco asked.
“Oh? A palm reader as well. Do you tell the future?” Draco asked and held his hand palm up. Blaise delicately held his hand. One of the committee members turned to tell the others.
“I make the bed. And I won’t mind paying.” Harry said. The blond rolled his eyes fondly as he headed over to the tree. He looked around.
“He just wanted us to be friends.” Draco said as he ran a hand through his hair.
“Fine looking building. It’ll look great once built.” The man said conversationally. “Well, Harry. Do you believe I am what I say I am?”
“Not that! Please spare me from nerd speak.” Blaise said with a roll of his eyes. He then grabbed Draco’s left hand and raised it up, the ring catching the light. “What is this?”
“You’re back early. Harry said it was because of his boys.” Father said.
“Look,” Harry started feeling like the rugs been pulled out from under him. “You’ll have to phone my secretary to make an appointment. I’m in the middle of dinner-“
“We’re not leaving the house. Do you trust me?” Harry asked instead, moving his hand closer. Draco studied him carefully and finally took his hand only to be pulled out of his seat. He stumbled into Harry, who caught him around the waist.
“Still get jealous, Potter?” Draco asked amused. Harry just reached across the table and held the blond’s hand.
“Scorpius. You’re back early.”
“Won’t be gone long. Just think of me spoiling you.” Harry said with a wink. He laughed at the eye roll but felt smug as the door closed behind him.
“Excuse me, Draco. Need to do something about that.” Blaise said as he stood up. He then walked over to the table the three people were sitting at. “Forgive me for coming over but I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Blaise and I believe you’re all good friends of Draco’s. We were wondering if you’d care to join us for lunch.”
“It’s very cold outside.” Luna said.
“Can you prove to me you’re an angel?” Harry asked seriously.
“Well...” Blaise said with a smirk as he broke away from Draco to execute an aerial spin jump. Draco shook his head in disbelief.
He eyed Potter suspiciously as he cut a small piece off and ate it. His eyes lit up at the taste and the next bite was bigger. He moaned obscenely at the delicious taste, missing the dark eyes staring at him as he dug in with gusto.
Harry liked the smug happy smile Draco was making. He remembered Draco telling him that one of his favorite things was to make Harry laugh. He leaned forward and kissed Draco’s smile.
“Meeting with Shacklebot. 10:30 AM.
“I mean, I’ll have to talk to the ferret,” Harry frowned at that, “sorry, Malfoy. He’s been an ok bloke so far. But I’m not mad or anything and I won’t be when it sinks in. We’re mates for life, Harry.”
“To be friends with Mr. Potter.” Scorpius said. He then started heading towards his room but stopped to look at them. “You are friends, right?”
“Wherever they send me.” Blaise said.
“Ah. Forgive me, but I’m not quite as young as I once was and your Aunt has questionable taste when it comes to anything celebratory.” Draco said. “Did you come by this early just to reprimand me and then leave time to head back before you’re supposed to head out?”
“You think it’s my fault?” Harry asked in a hurt tone.
“Why aren’t you at the camping trip?” Draco asked puzzled. “You and Scorpius made it sound like it was the event of the summer.”
Draco slid out of bed bemused as his son waited for him impatiently by the door. Draco put his dressing robe on and placed his wand in his pocket. As he walked over to his son he pulled a blue ribbon out of his pocket and tied his long hair back.
“What can I do for you?” The man asked stepping closer.
“Mr. Potter? You’re still here?” Scorpius asked confused. Mr. Potter was carrying a tray of food while wearing his father’s spare dressing gown. Did he spend the night?
“Lovely.” Blaise repeated as he watched Draco.
I really do believe in you
Blaise helped Neville learn the basics of ice skating by leading him around the pond. When he released Neville’s hands the other man started to freak out. Blaise skated back over to Draco with Neville in his wake. It wasn’t until Neville kept missing Blaise that he realized he was actually skating.
“I don’t trust you Blaise.” Harry said bluntly.
————————
“Hello Albus. Hello Scorpius.” Blaise said with a smile as he turned to encounter two boys standing in the hall looking at him.
“This is quite a surprise. Let’s have some sherry.” Remus said getting the bottle and some glasses.
“Yes, well I should have paid closer attention to the date.” Scorpius said with a sniff.
“I was thinking more of the times when I managed to sneak into your room.” Lucius said dryly earning a laugh from his wife.
———————-
“I will.” Blaise said and turned to see Draco standing at a window display. “You like that jacket, don’t you?”
“I don’t know how you do that elegantly. I think I look like a sack of potatoes.” Harry said as he went and got the presents from under the tree for Draco.
“Mate, he hasn’t been that bad this year.” Ron said slowly. Harry blinked and looked at Ron confused.
“Of course!” Harry said. “If I could I’d be by your side always but we know how you get when people hover over you when you’re brewing.” Harry looked up and quickly got up to hug Draco. “Oh love! What’s wrong?”
“It looks like a few of my mother’s ornaments.” Draco said quietly. “They were different shapes but they were this exact color.”
“I want you to be my husband.” Harry said simply.
“Goodnight Draco.” Blaise said sweetly. Draco stared at him for a few seconds smiling and then finally left, shutting the door behind him.
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight
“It’s called fresh air, father.” Scorpius teased. He tried not to roll his eyes again as father looked him over. “I’m fine, father.”
“Haaa.” Blaise gasped trying not to laugh.
“I did, but you know I want to make it special.” Harry said with a shrug. Hermione gave him an indulgent smile. “I wanted to do like an advent or something but an advent feels like it’d give away his main gift.”
“Mrs. McGonagall.” Hermione said as she handed him the phone.
“Thank you?” Blaise asked earning a snort of amusement.
“Almost blank. I signed my name on the line. You can use it for anything. Something fun like a shopping spree. Something serious like an emergency repair. Hell, you could buy a duplex or townhouse if you wanted.” Harry said. “You don’t even have to use it if you don’t want to.”
“They’re just engagement rings at the moment.” Harry said.
Harry just held him closer. The headmistress and the staff made it very clear that attendance for classes was not going to count towards their overall grade. Some days were harder than others and they didn’t want to add unnecessary pressure. Harry was glad for it considering he barely attended classes at the start of the year.
Harry had only slipped up once with his crush in a physical capacity, which Malfoy didn’t discourage but didn’t encourage either. It wasn’t until the blond explained why the no romantic relationships rule was in place. He had had a few clients in the past try to wine and dine him. A few turned out to be in committed relationships and one just outright tried to assault him. Harry had been so angry when he was told about that incident. Malfoy asked him if he wanted to attack the guy and Harry said yes. The blond just laughed and told him the guy was in jail when Malfoy brought legal action against him, which caused a domino effect of all his past victims stepping up. Harry remembered the case because he’d met that Quidditch player and wished he never had.
“The man who composed that music was the only man I ever loved.” Mrs. McGonagall said with conviction. “We were engaged to be married but I got frightened. He had nothing and I was afraid of poverty. He went away... and I never saw him again. I never loved my late husband, but he was very much in love with me and he was wealthy. I spent a fortune honoring his memory on empty monuments.”
“Excuse me?” Harry asked thinking he heard wrong.
“Pretty sure we missed our first one.” Harry said as he adjusted his position so he was cuddling the blond.
“You know, people think Zabini and Malfoy are dating.” Hermione said conversationally. She didn’t flinch when all the glasses and pitchers around them cracked but Ron startled. She did blink in surprise when Harry stood up.
“Good luck, Harry. And merry Christmas.” Hermione said as she hefted up her purse and headed for the office door.
“No.” Harry said immediately. “But thanks to this weekend you’ll probably see more of Scor than usual.”
THE END
“That’s what I’ve been asking for.” Draco said sounding relieved.
“Probably.” Ginny said flatly. “You didn’t have to come and check on them.”
“I finished early and I let the cook know not to leave food out for me.” Blaise said as he gazed down at Draco. Draco had his hand on the baby carriage, holding a little mittened hand in his own.
“Professor! I-“ Draco started.
———————-
“An advantage against an angel?” Harry asked incredulously.
“Or I make you your favorite breakfast and give you a birthday present you’ve always wanted.” Scorpius said.
“Yes, exactly. An angel. Draco is a creature of earth. As are you.” Remus pointed out giving him a pointed look.
“Oh no. It will be carved right into the marble base.” Harry said. Mrs. McGonagall nodded.
“Oh?” Blaise asked intrigued.
“No present today?” Draco asked lightly but Harry could hear the disappointment in his voice.
“Alright. Definitely. Thank you, Professor!” Draco said as he pocketed the coin. With one last nod at Severus he quickly left the shop to hail a cab.
“I like that idea.” Harry said and kissed him again before he could say anything. Draco pouted when Harry stopped kissing him. “Unfortunately, I must go find out what my lovable sons did this time.”
Mrs. McGonagall looked away for a moment and then looked back. Blaise just kept smiling at her. He prompted her with his eyes and a little bit of angel charm.
“Hey. How did you know my name?” Neville the cabdriver asked as he looked in his rear view mirror at them.
“This is...” Draco said.
“Oh. I have it.” Remus said standing to move books aside. He then gave it to Harry.
“We should head out, Draco.” Harry said as he walked over to the other man. He stared at the jacket that Draco was wearing. It was the new one he got when he was out with Blaise. “We have many people to see.”
“I see you finally wooed my cousin. Congratulations.” Luna said happily.
“What?” Draco asked startled.
“It helps having something sturdy to hold onto.” Draco said. “Next you’ll tell me you’re a professional skater.”
“You have visitors. It must be Draco and Harry.” Blaise said as he gently pulled away from Mrs. McGonagall.
“That’s very kind of you but I have work to do in town. You know what I mean, Harry. So many good people making so many mistakes.” Blaise said. Harry just stared at him.
“I can’t believe you got this for me.” Draco said as they sat down to catch their breathes. The blond had cast a few floating light charms so they could see each other.
“Yes?” Luna asked confused. “I thought you knew.”
“What’s on your mind?” Hermione asked pleasantly as she handed a mug to him.
Blaise listened to her confession, watching the regret, sorrow, and longing play on her face. He let her cry on his shoulder as years of buried feelings came to the forefront. He looked up when he heard the doorbell ring.
“Potter-“
“I asked our cook to leave a meal out for you for when you get hungry.” Draco said as he made sure everyone was bundled up. Blaise went and fetched the baby carriage earning a kind smile from Draco as James placed Lily securely in it.
Draco entered his home to be greeted by his live-in maid, Luna, who helped him take his overcoat off. He rifled through the pockets before she took it away and held the coin in his hand as he approached the doors to the drawing room. He took a breath in and opened the door. All talking ceased as all eyes turned to him.
“Who made this?” Draco asked. It didn’t look like anything the elves would make. His mother ordered them to err on the side of healthy.
“Of course I do!” Draco said vehemently. “It’s just If I’m wearing a ring and you’re wearing a ring, then people will put two and two together.”
Hermione stood back and watched as Harry started pacing back and forth. She let him get through his rant before trying to say anything. Even when he was done she gave him a few seconds.
“I’m an angel.” The man said.
“Ow. Back to Potter already?” Harry asked as he let the blond go and rubbed his side.
“And what exactly were you expecting?” Draco said coldly. Blaise held a hand up.
“Aunt Pansy told me to give you hell today because apparently you told her you’d spend it with me.” Scorpius said while crossing his arms.
The room was once more empty. Harry walked to the middle and looked around but Blaise was nowhere. Harry ran his hand through his hair erratically as he walked out of the office to join Draco.
“Open the other one.” Harry said, instead of saying something about not being surprised that the Malfoy’s would decorate with Tiffany ornaments.
“You going back to Malfoy?” Ginny asked.
“Draco, Darling!” The woman said with a hint of a French accent.
“It wouldn’t be the first time.” Harry muttered.
“You’ve met loads of times.” Harry said confused. Hermione rolled her eyes.
“I did that. Did you see the evening Prophet?” Hermione asked.
They sat and watched the snowball fight, chatting about nothing. Blaise got to hold Lily for a little bit but she wanted Draco to hold her more. He eventually put her back in the baby carriage. The fight seemed to be winding down after a good while.
“Your mother said you might as well stay here while she cools down.” Narcissa says looking at Harry. “And kills your father.” She added thoughtfully.
“Of course.” The man agreed. Remus nodded along with the man.
“There must be.” Remus said. “You and Draco love each other. You always have. Even when you were picking fights before you got together.”
————————————-
Harry would have tackled the blond in a hug but Draco held his left hand out expectantly palm down. It took a raised eyebrow and a pointed look at the box to get the hint. Harry took the white gold ring out of the box and slipped it on Draco’s ring finger. He looked at the blond as he lifted the hand up and kissed the knuckle. Draco looked like he was about to cry. He let the hand go and pulled the blond to him. Draco let out a watery laugh as he kissed Harry. He held the blond’s face, wiping the tears of joy away, as they kissed and smiled against each other.
“Before being caught by father and sent away with hexes being hurled at you?” Narcissa teased. Lucius gave her a flat look.
“That’s nice, Mrs. McGonagall. I need to go.” He then turned to Draco. “I’ll see you at home.” With that he left the room, Draco watching him worriedly.
All three of them started to say various forms of no thank you and tried to make their excuses. One stood up and Blaise blocked the walkway as he charmed them into joining him and Draco. They immediately started agreeing and walked over to the table Draco was sitting at. Two of them sat in the booth next to him on either side, while the third and Blaise took some chairs to sit at the table. Blaise took the liberty of ordering some alcohol for the committee members.
“Of course, one of my lectures.” Remus said.
“Did you use protective charms while shagging?” Luna asked curiously.
“Brat.” Harry said fondly as he plopped down next to the blond.
“Will you marry me, Draco?” Harry asked quietly.
“What would you have had me wear?” Draco asked.
“Why don’t you fight for him then?” Remus pointed out.
“There’s no one but me that knows that composition.” Mrs. McGonagall said.
“Much too long. You know how Harry’s been busy.” Draco said regretfully.
“Father. You’re looking at me like that again.” Scorpius said with a small blush.
“Where did you find it? Wait.” Harry stated knowing the answer was Blaise.
“Have a lie in, get some work done, maybe indulge in a bath and reading. Why?” Draco asked. “I refuse to leave the house.”
THE END
The physical therapy had been terrible at first. He was expecting the pain so it wasn’t that. It was because he hadn’t been listening to an extremely professional Malfoy, which was disconcerting. It wasn’t until Harry almost landed himself back in the hospital barely a week later due to his own stupidity that Malfoy gave him an ultimatum. Either he gets with the program or Malfoy leaves. Well, it was yelled with bigger words and with more swearing but that was the gist of it.
“You’re spoiling me, Potter.” Draco said after biting his bottom lip. “Go get food.”
Cheque=check
“No. Unless that’s what you want but I’d rather it be private.” Harry said nuzzling his shoulder. Draco cleared his throat.
“But there’s still so much to do.” Hermione said in surprise.
“Are you kidding?” Draco asked. “Absolutely! Let me change!”
“What if I’m your present?” Harry asked. He gave Draco a flat look as he was assessed.
“Daddy!” Lily yelled as she hugged Harry the moment he tumbled out of the fireplace.
Mrs. McGonagall walked into the room a little while after he started playing. Her eyes were wide as she looked perplexed and as if she’d seen a ghost. Her eyes started to get misty eyed as she watched Blaise play, staring at the harp. When Blaise finished he gently pushed the harp back into place and looked at the woman.
“Well, after being a prat and nearly giving me a heart attack about how he’d say no since I had no ring, he said Yes!” Harry said excitedly.
“Where have you been? The boys have been asking after you. Draco’s been so sad since you left.” Luna said.
Hermione quietly read the letter to Ron since he had been sitting next to Harry.
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
“Well, I suppose so?” Draco asked looking a little startled at the desperation on Harry’s face. “I’m not saying No.”
“Well e’ryone reckons you got hitched.” Seamus said. Harry grinned in response.
“I don’t understand and I don’t want to know. What are you really here for?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“They’re your little brothers.” Draco pointed out. “They look up to you and just want to play with you. You’re never too old to play with anyone.”
“Goodbye Harry.” Blaise said walking over and holding his hand out for a handshake. Harry stared down at his hand but took it to shake.
“Yes.” Draco said feeling dumbfounded and giddy at the same time. Harry grinned and finally kissed him properly. “Dear Merlin, at the rate you’re going, you’re going to propose to me on your birthday.”
“Honestly.” Narcissa said while rolling her eyes. She stood up to better look out the window. “You have seen our son, right?”
“Your father did it to me.” Lucius said. Narcissa’s glare disappeared as she remembered and smiled at the memory.
Draco frowned heavily at the closed doors. He was so confused and hurt. He stood at the bottom of the stairs and looked up towards the boy’s room. It took him a few times to bring a smile to his face but he had to stay happy for his family, even if it hurt him.
“It could just be little things. And is this like the twelve days of Christmas?” Hermione asked.
“Too what? Too attractive? Nothing could be-“ Blaise started but turned when he saw a familiar face. “Why my old friend Professor Lupin.” Remus started to turn away.
