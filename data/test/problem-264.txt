"Yes, I'm sure that was your only motivation," said George. "Living with my mother was just so much fun, wasn't it?"
Draco was half listening. The vase in his hands looked as though it bore the imprint of flames, and Draco’s hands shook a little as he set it carefully back on the shelf. “You can see the fire,” he said.
“I will use your Floo. If you don’t mind,” Potter said, sounding as dignified as a man with egg down his robes possibly could. “Thank you.”
It was beautiful, carved from black jet, and shone with reflected light, despite its darkness. Harry could feel the hairs on the back of his arm rise from the powerful magic it emitted, even without touching it. The thought occurred to him that Voldemort would have coveted it to use as a Horcrux.
Hermione’s frown turned into a lip-bite of curiosity when she recognised the shape of a book. “That’s not your mother’s owl, is it?” Draco received letters every week or so from a slim barn owl, but this one had been quite portly.
He looked up, the teacher’s words still not really registering. All he could see was Malfoy, who was watching him, eyes bright and focus tight. Harry felt pinned again, trapped by the stare. It was only then that Harry became aware of another part of his body which had tensed up, ready for action. He was grateful for his robes, as he registered exactly how hard he was. He didn’t know what had done it, if it was being pressed against the floor like that, or what, but the shame of getting an erection because of anything to do with Malfoy…
“I… I don’t understand,” Harry said. “I don’t understand about why you’d have those cards.” It was one of the questions that had kept him up all night. No matter what he thought, he couldn't quite escape it.
Closing his eyes once more, he focused on the sounds around him. Singing trees, and buzzing bees. The trees were fuller than they had been when he arrived, and the meadow was bright with colour. Henry had a well-stocked herb garden, and Draco ran his fingers over his palm once more. Perhaps…
It was only later, while he was brushing his teeth, that it occurred to Harry that maybe he could have invited Malfoy and Blaise. That maybe they would have wanted to be included, or enjoyed the chance to meet his friends. The sinking feeling from before came back, but this time he wondered if the person he was disappointed in was himself.
Harry’s skin was flush all over, and drool spilled from the corner of his mouth. His eyes were heady and dark, and he watched Draco through half-closed lids. His cock was engorged, and dark, and it too was leaking slightly.
and the way his body was swaying slightly, the way he couldn’t quite keep still. “I need to go home.”
Maybe this was the way it was going to be, but Harry didn’t like it. He was aware that there was a growing knot inside of him that came of having this secret part to his life. George’s question was still echoing around his head. What did he really want, deep down? Perhaps it wasn’t about who he fancied or what he did in his spare time. Maybe what he really wanted was to be able to live without having secret parts.
Now, rather than a barren patch of paving stones, the garden was filled with leaves and dots of colour. Blaise had promised some bulbs, and that he would help plant them in the soil at the base of the fence, as well as in some of the pots. “It will be some colour for Spring,” he’d said.
He poured the bubbling water over his tea, and set his timer for four minutes. Then, as normal, he fetched his yoghurt from the cool-charmed shelf, and carved crisp slivers of apple directly onto it. His tea – diffuser removed – was clear and hot. A dash of milk, and all was ready.
“You’re not going to get all moody and start talking about complications again?” said Draco, the words tumbling out slowly, and a rasping burr in his quiet voice. Harry smiled to himself: Draco was too undone to even put on a show of snark. His finger drew a new line through a fine sheen of sweat, a line dragged lightly on heated flesh. Draco shivered, and Harry’s finger paused. “Don’t stop,” Draco whispered, and Harry continued, tracing ribs, circling Draco’s navel, and travelling down through blond hair to Draco’s exhausted prick.
"I have a few ideas, but I don't think that you will like what I have to say." Severus sat back in his high-backed armchair. Privately, Harry liked to refer to it as his throne: it had that kind of an air about it. "Firstly, you will have to overcome your... objection to Parseltongue, and together with Harry try talking to the house." Harry suddenly realised that of course, Parseltongue was what Malfoy had meant by 'talking to the house'. "Secondly, I would recommend that Harry is not in the house without Draco also being present."
"Just meeting your basic physical needs," said Harry, and he was gratified to see a hint of a smile on Malfoy's lips. As they walked up the stairs, Harry felt hopeful that today Malfoy would be a little more... bearable.
When Draco passed the hallway mirror, he caught sight of his reflection. He was still half expecting to see some hideous transformation, but instead he saw Potter pushing him up against the wall. Potter touched him with hungry, desperate hands; fingers unbuttoning and mouths kissing. Hot hands touched his skin, and Draco couldn’t help but moan as the vision surrounded him, became more real than anything else. Potter’s hand disappeared beneath Draco’s shirt, and Draco grabbed Potter’s head to kiss him even more. His shirt fluttered to the floor.
"Prick," said Harry, but then he caught Malfoy's eye, and they both laughed. "Let's just get back to Grimmauld Place," he said.
“I think the curse has been broken. That’s what I wanted to tell you. The only known cure for the curse is if the enemy you see in the visions… well, ceases to be an enemy. If the visions have a chance of coming true.”
Harry murmured that he was. He didn’t want to say that he’d been tired a while ago, but that Malfoy had been all pink, sitting by the fire and deep in discussion with Hermione. Harry had come to bed but waited, because he found it easier to go to sleep when Malfoy was there, odd smells or not. Maybe it was thanks to all those years at Hogwarts, or even to the ones before under the stairs, but Harry enjoyed having someone to talk to when he went to bed.
, said Draco, silently in his mind as large hands grabbed at his arse, and the tip of Harry’s cock made contact.
"I thought you said it was wild magic, sir?" asked Harry. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Malfoy watching him, nodding almost imperceptibly.
On occasion Malfoy tried to offer to help him, but that only made him even angrier, and he always refused. He was going to do this on his own. He was going to get it right without having to ask for help from
Teddy wiggled and wrapped an arm around Harry, who pulled him close. The more that Harry read, the more still Teddy grew, until by the last page, Teddy's eyes were closed and he was snoring lightly. Harry read on, just because he didn't like to see a story half-finished, and then he kissed Teddy lightly on the head.
In the run-up to Christmas, George needed all the help he could get so Ron had squeezed in a few shifts at the weekend. Harry arrived at the shop to find Ron behind the till with George, and Greg wearing a pointed green cap and a gold tinsel belt.
Greg stared at him. “Er, Right.” He probably thought Harry was mad. “So why haven’t you moved her here already?”
Harry’s face ached, in rhythm with the beating of his heart. He had been able to ignore everything else, but his own name?
“What is it?” Harry asked, thoroughly confused. Before Zabini could answer though, the dawning of an idea formed in Harry’s mind. “Is this… something to do with Ginny?”
"I learned that I didn’t need a wand to do magic, not in the woods. I use the trees; I channel magic through them, and somehow it… softens the magic. Gentles it, and me," he added.
“No. Wait!” Harry hurried after him. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm. “I wouldn’t have asked you to lunch if I wasn’t interested in– if I didn’t want to be seen with you.”
Rather than birdsong, or even the soft rumble of Muggle cars, this particular morning Draco woke to a gentle but insistent tapping noise. In his sleep-befuddled state, at first he thought a Snitch had got loose, and half expected to see one swoop past him as he opened his eyes. Instead, upside down from his point of view, the silhouette of an owl was neatly framed by his skylight.
He thought they’d stay as they were, but after Harry had delivered another of his devastating deep kisses, he pushed Draco on the side. Draco got the message, and turned over, while Harry pulled on his hips to bring him up onto his knees. Draco’s leg protested a little as he moved, but once his weight was more on his knees it seemed fine. Draco looked up to see the solid trunk of Harry’s favourite tree in front of him; he hadn’t realised how close they were.
When the door opened, Harry didn't bother to turn to see who was coming in: to be honest, unless it was a fresh plate of biscuits he wasn't interested.
Malfoy’s voice sounded subdued. “I know. Except…” He looked to the door. “The door appears and disappears. There’s… something left.”
“Yes, dear,” said Narcissa. Draco gritted his teeth: he might as well be about five. “Now, Draco tells me that you need to speak to the portraits. He also tells me that you’ve had a spot of bother with Mrs Snettisham.”
“Harry,” she said, opening her arms for a hug. She enveloped him in the smell of warmth. “You came.” She beamed at him, then turned her attention to Malfoy. “And brought a friend.”
The words seemed to blur in front of his eyes, twisting as he stared at them. Harry had to put a hand on the floor for support, feeling suddenly light-headed. Questions flooded his mind in a noisy whirl: What was Draco doing? Why was he lying to Muggles? What was he
There were green rolling hills as far as the eye could see, broken into parcels of land by hedgerows and stone walls and the occasional thicket of trees. Sheep dotted the landscape, but the field they were standing in only contained an oak tree, and an old shepherd's hut. It was falling down, but after two days out here, Harry and Ron together with Sarah and the others had decided that this was the key to the pattern of magical holes dotting the countryside around.
Harry wanted to believe that Ron and Hermione simply couldn’t hear him over the roar of the Friday night crowd in the Leaky Cauldron. Judging by their frozen faces and the way all colour had drained from Ron’s face, he was guessing it was a bit more than that.
“We’realways so tired.” Harry’s weariness seeped into his words, but they had sprung from somewhere deep inside of him. It was the one truth of his life. He was tired, all the time. “It… it shouldn’t be like this.” He ran his thumb along the back of Draco’s hand, trying to let him know what he meant. His words were just so inadequate at saying what he wanted – no, needed – to say to Draco. So he usually chose to say nothing at all, rather than mess it up.
Sometimes, Harry risked actually interacting with Malfoy about more than the angle at which all towels in the bathroom must be folded.
“Fine, thank you.” Draco looked down at his plate, noting that his mother’s cooking skills had improved. As had his own. He sighed: it really was a brave new world. Sensing both that his sigh had concerned his mother, and that she needed a better answer than ‘fine’, Draco took a sip of water before giving what he hoped was a reassuring smile. “It’s good to finally be in practice. And at least the Muggle patients don’t ask awkward questions.”
Eventually he carefully gathered up the cards, stacked them in colour order, and put them back in the box. There was no way he could recreate Draco’s original order, but he could at least not leave them in a total mess. The card at the front - the one about St Paul's - was slightly crumpled from where he’d gripped it too tightly in disbelief. The rest were still pristine, apart from the odd corner that had got caught when he’d picked the card up. There was no major damage to any one card, though.
Draco felt himself preen at the idea that he was one of the special people who did, as though he were fifteen not nearly thirty. A smidgeon of shame fluttered across his awareness that he was, again, acting like a teenager around Potter, but one glance at Potter’s big stupid open face, full of enthusiasm, and he decided it didn’t matter. Bloody Gryffindors, this was how they got you in the end: their boundless energy and earnestness.
They sat, side by side, in silence as the opening credits rolled. The screen was a lot easier to see with the blinds down, and the sofa was the best place to watch TV from. Even so, Harry was aware of how close they were sitting, and how strange it was to sit together in what for all intents and purposes was a companionable silence. Every now and then, he glanced over at Malfoy, although he was not sure exactly why he did so. Checking that it was still safe to do so, perhaps? Certainly he’d seen Malfoy’s mood change quickly before. Malfoy, Harry noted, had picked up his tea, but not drunk it yet.
"They are." Weasley went silent, and they walked past a couple of trees without saying anything. Draco’s thoughts weren’t packed away carefully enough, because they came spilling up again.
“One time we slid down every flight of stairs, from the top of the house all the way to the bottom. We got in so much trouble! It was worth it though.” A soft look crossed her face, but then she frowned, and sighed. “It’s like the girls I remember us being are strangers now.”
Draco turned his gaze from the fast-moving waterfall, the plume of white it created in the water, to Potter, who was standing next to a holm oak, his eyes closed as he placed a palm flat on his bark.
Draco wasn’t expecting another vision, and certainly not when about to take someone’s temperature. He was about to reach for his wand, when he saw with utmost clarity that if he were to use magic, the girl’s mother – a Squib – would cause a big scene, ultimately leading to a story in the paper and the loss of his job. The shock of the vision was jarred by the sudden certainty that while he was unemployed and moping in his little flat, none other than Harry Potter would come to find him. And then… eyes, laughter; a feeling of warmth and connection.
"That beech wand was made with love and sadness," Ollivander said. "You learned more than how to hear the soul of trees."
“They’re not coming here,” Harry said, after he found Draco wiping down the insides of all the kitchen cupboards. “And even if they were, no one would look inside the cupboards.”
The reverse transformation was quicker. The mane disappeared, along with the sharp teeth and big pink tongue. Once Draco’s own pointy features were restored he turned back to Harry.
Harry laughed and sat down, content to watch Draco move around the kitchen, draining pasta and making a quick vinaigrette for a salad. The wine was warming and rich, and Harry breathed deeply into his glass. As they ate, Draco did a fairly good job of pretending to listen, nodding at the right moments and tutting at Robards and his shouting. He then told Harry some tale of the incomprehensible politics at St Mungo’s. He’d worked there for years, but Harry was still at a loss to explain how it all worked.
John the cheese man hurried over. “Oh, that’s a real pity. Still, we can’t leave it lying around like this.” Before Draco really knew what was happening, the shards were being swept up and binned, and someone had thrust a polystyrene cup of hot, sweet tea into his hands. He stared at it. The weight was all wrong, and he couldn’t feel the burning tingle of the tea through the sides like he could with one of Henry’s cups.
“I remember. It– they—” He didn’t know what he could say that would ever sum up his time with the Dursleys.
Potter put the cup back on the table, his mouth loosening into an almost-smile at the change of topic. It softened his whole face when he smiled, and Draco always felt his own mood lift a little, too. “I think he’s definitely a suspect. But I also think I need some more information. I’m still waiting to hear back from Ron, and I wonder if he’ll turn up anything useful. But…”
But Dudley wasn’t back yet, and Harry could always find somewhere else to live. He’d have to face number twelve, and Kreacher, at some point. When he was ready. And he’d have to work out what to do with the house he’d inherited if he didn’t want to live in it. Hermione had been right, the change had done him good. Robards, too, if Harry was being truthful with himself: he loved being an Auror, but his heart hadn’t been in it for months.
“I provide the Quidditch equipment suppliers with Snitches of different grades.” Draco looked at the names on Potter’s list. “Let’s see. The Cannons use Wrights… so do the Tornadoes. The Wasps use Henley’s, and both the Magpies and the Arrows use Ogilvy. Sorry, Potter. I can’t see a link.”
The golden light of a summer’s sunset filled their bedroom. Harry and Draco were both naked on the bed, and the sight made Harry’s breath catch.
“I want to show you what’s inside.” He pressed the hidden catch on the Snitch’s side, and it clicked open.
“It’s none of your business what I eat.” Malfoy said. He took his bowl into the other room, and didn’t talk to Harry again the rest of the evening.
When Draco opened his eyes again, night had fallen. The floor was cold, and his head ached. He could just make out the corners of the room, the yellow glow of the Muggle lamp post slanting down from the street above. Chair legs, a table, an armchair and small sofa. He sat up, ignoring the stab of pain in his temple as he did so. Why was the room so cold? He maintained heating and cooling charms that should have left his basement flat the perfect temperature (‘central heating’ and ‘good ventilation’ as he called them when curious Muggles asked). And then he remembered the blinding blue light, the words of hate printed onto damp parchment.
"Thanks." Potter shifted at Draco’s side as he returned his wand to within the folds of his clothing. "I’ve been tinkering with it, trying to work out how to get it to spread more slowly."
, but perhaps all he did want was to be wined and dined and seduced with smiles and touches. Either that or, as was more likely, this was a hideous curse designed to torture him.
Hestia carried on, her voice hardening as she became more of the disapproving Auror. “Well, as this is not the first incident this year, I think we are going to have to come up with some way of dealing with your ongoing antagonism with Draco. Tonight Harry, you've illustrated your total inability to work with another trainee.” She held up a hand. “Before you say anything, it doesn’t matter, shouldn’t matter, what your history with him is. We always knew that there would be some issues with this group of recruits after everything that has come before, especially given that we accepted someone with the Mark. But, and this is a big but, once you join the Auror corps, you will have to be able to trust your life to any other Auror on the team. Including Draco.”
The memory fell away, and Harry and Draco were left sitting together, their hands still joined between them.
The archive room made Harry sneeze – he hated to say it, but he missed the days when house-elves kept it dust free. Although he’d never mention that to Hermione, of course. By the time he got home he was tired, dusty, and hungry as he’d missed lunch because Robards had waylaid him in the lift and insisted on a full update of his morning’s work.
Finding a present for Teddy was a small consolation prize for having to go the ball, but Harry would take what he could.
Harry walked home, hoping that it might be enough to clear his head. He could feel that things were slowly changing with Draco, but it was all so precarious and he was still so scared that it could all go wrong. Deep down, Harry knew that it was Draco he wanted, but it all felt so difficult.
The memory of Draco with his head in the cupboard surfaced, and Harry almost groaned into the empty room. This was how Draco had been before their trip to the Burrow. Perhaps, then, he could take a leaf out of Draco’s book. Harry wasn’t going to scrub out any cupboards, but he could dust and vacuum, wipe and mop. If Draco was stressed, coming home to a tidy home could only help.
. He sighed; he really didn’t have much of a plan, but was hoping that simply being here would be enough.
“No.” Draco picked at a cushion on the sofa. He had already ascertained that touching the cushion was safe. Vision-free. “But it was only a brief encounter. It wasn’t anything that could be described as a proper conversation.”
As Hestia stood up, everyone stopped and turned to face her. “We’ll reconvene at the training centre in ten minutes, and go over all the positives and negatives of this exercise.”
Harry took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and cast a self-Transfiguration on his hair, turning it into a Rapunzel-like flow of thick blond hair. He saw Draco’s eyes widen in surprise, but focused on the feeling of the weight of it on his shoulders and back.
His hand trembled as he reached forward to touch the cup again. Cold porcelain under his fingers became entangled with a confusing whir of sights and sounds and smells, as further images began to unfold like long-lost memories. Breaking the cup, going out to search for a replacement, bumping into Potter. An exchange of Owls. Dates. More of that warm laughter and those sparkly eyes.
Malfoy sniffed; the matter was clearly beneath him. “I’ve taken the liberty of drawing up a few house rules. It did not escape my notice yesterday that you are obviously unclear about the standards expected here.”
"The curse is destroyed," said Malfoy, turning his head slightly to look at Ron. "I tried to preserve the amulet for you though." Harry looked down at it: the shine had gone, and now it just looked like a dull piece of black wood. "It was an Eris amulet – a goddess of chaos. There was a powerful Discordia Curse on the amulet." Malfoy looked back at Harry. "I don't think it liked us working together."
"Oh, you don’t know the half of it," said Harry, and at the thought of Harry fucking himself on the trees, Draco bent low to kiss him. The new angle brought Harry’s cock almost out and then all the way back in again with each thrust, and Draco could feel Harry’s hips moving up to meet him each time. Harry’s hands came to his hips and dug in, almost painfully. They moved like this, Draco able to feel the almost-pop of Harry’s cock as it slid in and out, while his own cock felt as though it was being squeezed by pulses of ancient tree magic. Which it probably was.
His mind wandered back to what they'd been up to before Ron had interrupted earlier. They hadn’t got too far, but it was still more than they’d done in ages. Rather than the usual quick fumble late at night, kissing and stripping each other on the sofa had been fun, and hot, and Harry wanted to do it again. Instead of feeling guilty or resigned, Harry felt hopeful. Soon, he would take all of Draco’s clothes off, and do terrible things to him. He couldn’t wait.
At this, Malfoy finally smiled. He was on home territory when it came to Snitches. “Well, that depends on how much you want to know.”
“We’ve only got a few weeks to cover a lot of ground.” Draco looked far too much like he was enjoying this. “I thought we’d break it down into three basic areas: talking to people, food and drink, and dancing.”
Harry thought about this, and of Walburga Black's obsession with Pureblood values. "Was Walburga Black one of those gatekeepers?" he asked, and Malfoy nodded as a smile spread slowly across his face.
"Right." Draco pointed the wand, rather indelicately, at himself, and muttered the words. A loose, liquid sensation spread through his arse. "Done." He dropped his wand. "I’m ready for your wood."
“Well, these are Hogwarts friendship ambassador badges. Each year students from across the Houses will be selected to wear them. Their job will be to be, well, friendly.”
“Good.” Malfoy turned to the others. “Weasley, Granger. Good night.” Harry couldn’t help but notice that Malfoy did not look at him, let alone say his name. He gritted his teeth. Malfoy was such a prickly bastard, and was obviously going to keep on ignoring Harry as much as possible. The old competitive spirit blazed up in him, an irrational urge to somehow best Malfoy. Harry wasn’t much of an ignorer though.
A scratching, knocking noise caught Harry’s attention. Given that no one had knocked on his door all day, he was assuming that this would, indeed, be an emergency. Swinging the door open a little more forcibly than necessary, Harry found Malfoy, quill raised to eye level.
Draco and Potter turned to see Kreacher balancing a laden tray in one hand, and pile of fluffy towels and blankets on the other. He put the tray down by the fire, and handed the towels to Draco. The blankets he left across the back of one of the armchairs, then he left, muttering something about hot soup and buttered toast as he went.
Harry woke early - his body was still confused as to what time it was after their trip away - and heard George rise around six.
They got dressed in the chilly bedroom, Draco grumbling about Harry’s lousy Warming Charms again. Looking at Draco, his hair water-darkened and slick against his head, Harry wondered at how everything was the same and yet different.
“That’s enough!” Lucius’s voice was loud enough to make those nearest turn around and stare. One look at the family group – and presumably his parents’ scowling faces – and they all suddenly displayed an overwhelming urge to make small talk elsewhere.
Stairs rose up halfway along the hall, and the walls were bare except for a plain mirror with a candle sconce on either side. Harry hesitated before coming further in. “Are you sure about this?” Harry said.
An old, horribly familiar feeling grew in his gut, warring with all the other feelings he had, of longing and the skin-memory of electric tingles.
“I was thinking the colour of the stripes, maybe the form they take.” Harry had imagined them writhing, snake-like, to form words or simple pictures.
“No matter.” Draco smiled. “I wonder whether you could help us. Do any of you know of the Mildred or Penny whose paintings hang in the dining room at Snettisham House?
Harry lay awake for a long time - the sky outside was still light - his body heavy but his mind a swirling mess of bitter memories and an ugly feeling of.. Well, he wasn’t sure what it was. Hatred? A kind of horrified fascination? Pity, as he’d felt directly after the war when he’d seen Malfoy so subdued? When he did eventually fall asleep, he slept restlessly, and dreamt of pointy chins and giant curry stains under windmills.
“You are suspended for a week, Harry. Use that time to reflect on exactly what you want, then when you come back you will be partnered with Draco for the rest of the year. In classes, in practicals, in the weekly simulations. We will not have this discussion again. Understood?”
Ron was standing on the doorstep, a long red scarf wrapped about five times around his neck – clashing terribly with his hair – and with a huge cake tin under his arm. “Can I come in?”
Harry felt stung. Malfoy might not ever leave the house, but he did whatever he wanted within its four walls. “You have your potions. You steal all the blankets at night—”
Five minutes later she proved she had got it, by handing Harry one of her copies and showing him that she could change the words to ‘I’m a plant and I like eating bugs’. The pin warmed in his hand as it changed, and he laughed as he saw the look of delight on her face.
The flutter became an impossible wave of hope, which was in a way a feeling of worry at a great level. It was unbearable, the not-knowing, the not-trusting of what he was hearing.
“I, er, I’ll bear that in mind.” Now the silence definitely was awkward, and Harry wished the bed would swallow him up. Instead, he rolled away.
“And what’s he going to do with it, when no one’s at work, anyway?” Harry scowled, and went back to listing all the methods he knew Robards had been hoping to get written into the Auror code of practice. He rubbed the back of his neck in frustration; so many of these were good ideas, but he hated to be forced into rushing a report like this. At least he’d already helped write the initial proposal so plenty of it was familiar. Although on the other hand, that made this feel even more irritated as he’d already argued everything there was to argue on this front.
“Right.” Draco’s head felt light, and he took a sip of tea to try to steady himself a little. “You want me to weave baskets?”
Harry’s resolve crumbled. He had thought she looked a little peaky, but he was so used to Draco and his weariness when he was on nights… Crumbs. Three days without sleep? “Of course, sir. I understand.”
Draco was sure that she’d read the same book as his mother. He was, in the parlance of the young men whose acquaintance he was fond of making for an evening, properly stitched up.
“It was a timer, for you, which would have told you how long you had left before each bond wore off. I had it charmed to change colour, and, er, I’d tried to align it a little to the magical signature of the curse.”
“I’ve been told that your mum’s cooking is better than Harry’s,” Draco said. “I’d like to see if it’s true.”
“But what about the Room of Requirement?” Hermione asked. She chewed her lip slightly, Harry had noticed, when any mention was made of the summer she’d missed. Whatever had happened when she went to get her parents, he knew that nothing was going to get in the way of Hermione and her exams. Harry had never said it aloud, but he was pretty sure that if Ron hadn’t gone back this year it wouldn’t have made any difference to Hermione. She would have turned up, ready to study, no matter what.
When he looked around his classmates, even though he knew that Susan’s family had been killed - it was hard to forget when she mentioned it so often - or he remembered Neville with his parents, it was only really when Harry watched Lavender or Malfoy reacting that he felt he was seeing something in their emotions that he recognised from his own. He struggled to put any of these feelings into words, instead recognising the feel of it, the pulling ache in his chest, the dragging sadness of it all. The days of Lavender mooning after Ron or Malfoy sneering over Quidditch seemed quaint and childlike in comparison.
If Draco weren’t so wonderfully warm, Harry would have been tempted to roll away to avoid answering the question. Somehow, though, the movement of Draco’s hand on his arm was soothing. The knot of anxiety in Harry’s chest loosened a little.
"That's enough, Potter," Malfoy said, quietly. "I'd appreciate it if you let me do my job, without interruption."
Malfoy winced as Harry said Voldemort’s name, but not in the way most people did. Malfoy’s reaction was much more personal. “Let’s talk about something else.”
“Sorry; I’m so used to drying off here.” Henry looked a little sheepish. His lips looked warm. Inviting. Draco wanted to kiss him, to find out what they tasted like. He wanted to take Henry’s clothes off and lay him down on the bed. Henry kept talking, seemingly oblivious to Draco’s desires. “There’s not much room in—”
Within a week, Malfoy had managed to turn his own hair green. He came down to dinner, bearing the most dignified look Harry had ever seen on anyone’s face, but with lime-green hair.
Hermione shook her head. “Not yet. This bit was my idea: the eighth-year rooms are going be turned into a kind of social club, with each year group meeting on a set day of the week. I’ve been talking to Professor McGonagall about some of the Muggle activities that might be good to offer, alongside wizarding ones. Music, painting, games. That sort of thing.”
trying, it just wasn’t working, and he didn’t know why. He wasn’t going to, because he wouldn’t give that to Malfoy. It was too personal. Instead, Harry ground his teeth in frustration, knowing that somehow Malfoy had won this one.
They stayed locked together, and Harry laid his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Brilliant,” he said, before sliding out and slumping to the floor. Draco joined him, fascinated by the way the redness in Harry’s face extended half way down his chest. “How long have we shared a bed?” Harry asked.
“Yeah,” Harry said, pressing on despite the way his heart was beating faster, adding to his general unsettled feeling. He already knew he found it hard to ask for help, and asking Malfoy in particular was more difficult than he’d thought it would be. “Would you… could you help me, practise that is?”
“You surprise me, sometimes, Draco,” Hermione said. “I’m glad that you do.” Harry heard a smile in her voice, and one in Malfoy’s when he thanked her in return. Quietly, Harry slipped away.
She gave him once last narrowed-eyed look, but then the draw of talking about her pet project overcame any other objections. Harry listened, but a part of him continued to dwell on the past. If he drank enough, maybe he could tamp it down, and forget for a little longer.
people weren't injured thanks to magic and all the hazards that came with it, when Hermione returned, looking weary, her head haloed by the hair escaping her tight bun.
Draco ran through his options. He could look through some popular curses. He was sure he had a book somewhere, with curses to make your bits fall off; a gift from his father in all likelihood. The curse might not have manifested itself yet, but at least he knew that it cast a blue light. Draco collected what he could find on his bookshelves, then read until he could barely keep his eyes open. As sleep began to pull him down, Draco could barely hear the small voice in the back of his mind, whispering about terrible possibilities. His last thought as he drifted off was that he had already had the misfortune to live through one nightmare. He could deal with a curse, no matter what it did.
He lined the Snitch casings up in a neat row, then covered them with a piece of cloth. Draco draped them slowly, taking the time to take a few deep breaths again. When he turned back to Potter, it was to find him still staring intently.
He wasn't disappointed when, whilst in the midst a particularly cutting review of just where all of Draco's classmates now were, Severus broke off mid-sentence at the sight of Kreacher bearing a tiered cake tray overflowing with sweet treats: there were fondant fancies, fresh-dipped and topped with sugar-frosted flowers, baklava dripping with honey, still-warm shortbread, dense, fudgy chocolate brownies, and citrus-scented sweet and creamy cheesecakes. It was no traditional tea service, but Severus's eyes lit up nonetheless.
"You might have made a good student, Harry, had things been different," he said. And in that moment, Harry thought of him as the Severus who had been his mother's friend. He smiled and nodded, then turned his attention back to Malfoy. Whatever explanation Malfoy had been about to deliver was lost though, as he stared between the two of them with his mouth hanging open.
Draco shrugged. “I’ve got no space to keep an owl. And I only use an owl once every week or so.” He didn’t want to talk about his limited personal correspondence. “Your little owl is—”
“We’ve normally got one by now, but you slept all of Saturday. I’m off tomorrow, so I’ll get us one then.”
broke Draco’s concentration. The internal workings of his toaster were laid out on the table, light glinting from the lamp angled onto them. He was loath to look away in case he forgot what went where, but the tapping didn’t stop. Draco pulled up the blinds and saw an owl, eyes wide and black but feathers bedraggled, huddled on the stairs leading down from the street. He frowned. It was rare to be visited by an owl, as most of his friends would Floo and his mother had the house-elves post letters, all in deference to his living in a Muggle area.
“Oh.” Harry shrugged in irritation, because actually, at that precise moment, he didn’t really care about Draco’s work. He moved to the sink, thinking that cold water might be the answer to the burning throb in his hand.
“Well in that case,” Draco said, his hot fingers finding Harry’s aching cock surprisingly quickly, “I think I know why you’re here.”
Harry shook his head then stuck his hands into his pockets. He scanned the horizon while he decided what to do. “I’m going this way. See you later—”
"There's too much history. It... it's too complicated. Maybe if we had a different past..." Malfoy trailed off and swallowed. "But we don't." He hesitated for a second, and that was enough to give Harry hope.
“I’ve had a long day at work,” Malfoy said. “And I’ve missed Countdown. All I want is some peace and quiet.”
Harry returned, a few minutes later, with shorts and a t-shirt on. His hair was still damp, but Malfoy didn’t comment on it.
like to cook, but Mum never talks to me about it. Hermione wants to have the chance to try it out, but in… well in a scientific way. She wants to know what a cake is like with eggs, without eggs, eggs whipped and all sorts. Mum snatched a whisk out of her hands the other day.”
As he walked back up the stairs he wondered about Malfoy and the Blacks. Malfoy hadn’t looked like Sirius, exactly, but there had been something in the spark in his eyes that had for one brief moment reminded of Harry of his godfather in a way that ached. He’d been thinking about Sirius as sad for so long that he’d forgotten the rebellion in his eyes and the fierceness with which he lived.
Luna popped her head in the Floo late in the afternoon, but any hopes of a counter-curse were dashed with her first words. “You’ll be glad to hear that I’ve narrowed it down to one of twelve curses. Or twenty. I’ll need to come do some tests on you, but tomorrow; there’s not time for them all now.” She didn’t wait for an answer, and Harry was left staring at an empty fireplace, a breath drawn but nothing to say.
When Harry came home that evening to another freshly cooked meal – not a hint of burned bacon in sight – he couldn’t quite shake the feeling that nothing quite fit. Everything seemed… unsettled. All these memories were bringing up questions and thoughts that Harry didn’t quite know what to do with.
“I– I don’t know. But I think it doesn’t matter: it was all fake. It wouldn’t have happened without the forced bond. I– I wanted it to be real.”
“Will you teach me how to behave around a load of wizarding snobs? Just enough to get me through the evening? It would help if I knew there’d be no tutting this time.”
Draco froze as the words made it through to whatever part of his brain was still thinking. Touch his wood? Potter – Harry – it was hard to keep it straight – was ridiculous, and staring up at him with great big horny faux-innocent eyes. Laughter bubbled up through Draco and burst out of him so loudly he heard a bird take off from a nearby tree. Harry waggled his eyebrows, and looked down at his tented crotch.
“Pity,” Potter said, leaning back in his armchair again. “Because I was going to suggest that I play the violin. Just to check that the sound hasn’t been affected by your tests.”
“Thank you, Kreacher,” he said. “Thank you for looking after me when I was barely able to look after myself.”
She leant back into his hand, and he kneaded at her shoulder a bit. “I could do with that, too.” She sighed. “An open view of the sky might help. My hand is cramping a bit.”
"I..." Harry swallowed, and tried again. He was an Auror, and he knew that he was no idiot, whatever Malfoy thought. "Did you find anything?" he asked.
Harry ignored the small spark of misgiving at the idea of anything involving cauliflower as a surprise, opting instead to accompany her down to dinner with a smile.
“Everything happened so fast,” Malfoy said. “He was a friend but he was also an idiot to try to use something so powerful in what was essentially a giant tinderbox.”
"You've been ordering Kreacher around?" said Harry, willing his mind to focus on the words, and nothing else.
"I’ve already collected the water twice this week." Draco was in charge of making their morning coffee. The two stood side by side at the kitchen counter, preparing their breakfast. The day had yet to hit full heat, and it had a gentle feel to it. Both the day, and the company.
Hermione hopped up out of her chair, followed by Padma and Daphne, and along with Harry they all came to see what Millie had brought.
At breakfast, Malfoy tutted at Harry’s scruffy coat, slung over the back of the chair. “It’s going to be freezing today. You better wrap up properly. As
at the end of that. Was that how it was for Harry? He lived amongst the trees in a bubble of space and time, and everyone else kept moving around him. Everyone ended up leaving him behind. Was that what would happen for them, too?
"I think we'll start with the big pieces first," said Malfoy, nodding at the bed with its twisting serpent posts. "The Blacks were certainly fond of snakes, weren't they?" he said.
“Er, yes.” Harry was completely thrown by Malfoy’s joke and seemingly-earnest concern. “Like I said, you’re stuck to me now. For about two hours.”
The eggs no longer tasted so good. Harry swallowed them down as best he could, then set his plate aside. “But we can work it out.” The words sounded hollow and hopeful and, well, a touch desperate to Harry’s ears. Which they were, of course.
The queue for lunch was short, but Draco hung back and waited by the entrance. He couldn’t see Pansy yet, and he didn’t feel hungry, not with his stomach gently turning at the thought of having to explain all about his curse to some stranger.
“You can stock the shelves over there. Just make sure that the jars are positioned alphabetically, with all their labels facing forwards.”
“Oh Harry,” Hermione said, her eyes filling. “I never thought I’d see this day. You want to apply your learning, and you’re joining up the dots all by yourself.” She threw her arms around him. “I’m so proud of you.” She sat back and dabbed at her eyes. “I knew you’d get there, eventually.”
“You can, though. Look.” Draco held the broom up again. “I’ve modified the foot harness. You can move it forward, keep it flexible, or lock it into place. Whatever works best.”
“So are we going to say goodbye to this, to being alone here together?” Draco said. He looked around. “I’m going to miss it.”
In his dreams, it is not the memory of his mad aunt, or the giant snake, nor even the red eyes and hissing voice of the Dark... him, which are the worst. Those nights are bad, yes, and he wakes drenched in sweat and calling out, but then he can remind himself that it's over now, that they are dead and gone. No, the worst nights are those when he dreams of fine, soft hair; a curtain between him and the world. The scent of spring flowers, sharp and bright, and a gentle voice whispering words of love in his ear. Her hands are cool as they stroke his face, fingers long like his own. Her eyes are clear like the sky before dawn as she gazes at him, with that look that only a mother can give. With her he is safe, and the world is a quiet place.
about Potter seeing the Lovegood girl, but he did have a vague recollection that she’d been one of Potter’s little gang at school. He saw her at the Snidget reserve sometimes, and knew she was some kind of naturalist now. He remembered, with considerable unease, how she’d been, lost and alone in the cellar at the manor. An apology seemed hollow, but the one time they’d spoken since she’d accepted it then skipped off to look at the birds.
“Turn the telly on,” Harry said. Draco was still frowning, and Harry rolled his eyes. “It was just a long day. Chased down someone who was stealing potion supplies. Still haven’t worked out what they were for.”
"I know you want to clear all this up, of course you do," said Malfoy, "but I need to work in a systematic way. I don't want to miss anything."
“We’ve been working on it together,” Draco said. “Although it was actually Harry who worked it out initially.”
"If it was your bedroom," said Malfoy, ignoring Harry's less than enthusiastic response, "you could turn the room downstairs into a study. You could have the bathroom next to the bedroom to yourself, without having to share it with anyone who used your drawing room. And you'd still have three spare rooms for any guests."
“Oh.” As Harry’s heart sank a little, he realised that he’d hoped she’d stay longer. For dinner, maybe. It was nice to have the company. He focused instead on the prospect of looking up what to do about squeaky floorboards. Or perhaps looking into ways to make more space for the owls. He could take the wall out between the two rooms and—
“I didn’t know if it was—” Draco looked down. “I don’t know if I could watch myself have one of my nightmares.”
“Something like that.” Potter looked embarrassed. “I’d had so much of my life pored over, I just felt… I didn’t see why I should share this, too.” He sighed. “It isn’t easy.”
Harry spent the next few weeks stripping wallpaper, charming walls dry, removing curses, replastering, painting and papering. Each room began to feel blank, as though it could be anything. Harry had kept the huge four poster bed in his room – the hangings reminded him of his bed at Hogwarts – but there was plenty else he got rid of, or moved around.
“Whereas we’re so used to being able to heal injuries that we associate scars with curses, and see their permanence as part and parcel of the Dark Magic that caused them,” said Odwolfe.
She explained both charm and counter-charm, and then left the students to pair up. Harry, still writing down the incantations, took longer than normal to stand with a partner. When he looked up everyone was paired up, except for one person left standing in the middle of the room, alone.
Harry didn’t admit it, but Malfoy was right. When they rolled up to her door later that day, he had owled first, but not given her enough time to reply. It was cowardly, he knew, but he couldn’t face Andromeda telling him Malfoy wasn’t welcome. If he didn’t see her now, he couldn’t see how he’d ever get the courage to do it again. And having Malfoy there helped.
Despite the tea, Potter poured them both a drink from the dusty bottle that the house-elf must have retrieved from some old Black store, because it was rich and warming and just perfect. The easiness between them had changed to something else now: a quiet tension, a touch yet to happen. Draco sipped at his brandy to fill the spaces, as did Potter. After the second glass, a warm glow seemed to have settled about the room.
Dinner was the most confusing thing to happen to Draco yet. On the one hand, it was a blessed relief not to be plagued by visions, but on the other, it was totally disarming talking to Potter. He wasn’t anything like Draco remembered from school. Thinking of names to call Potter had been one of his favourite pastimes back then, but now ‘Scarhead’ didn’t seem quite so funny. Actually, as Draco twirled fettuccine around a fork and nodded as Potter talked about how he envisaged offering free curse scar healing and developing better training for Healers, Draco found himself nodding along. Potter seemed serious about the research.
Lucius turned to Draco and gave him a cold stare. “A handfasting would satisfy the oath I made last night, but more importantly it would lift the curse on the Malfoy family. You might learn something from this… man,” Lucius glanced over at the minstrel, the slight twitch of a lip the only sign that he didn’t find the sight of a dirt-smeared face pleasing, “and besides, you have your wand: you’re not going to be in any danger.”
“This is far worse,” Harry said, his head in his hands. “There’s a reason I usually avoid these events.”
Taking his coffee out onto the veranda, Draco felt robbed of his last day of sunshine. His knee, too, ached in this cooler weather. At the same time, he knew it didn’t matter. He had to face up to the truth that whatever idyll he’d found with Harry, it couldn’t last.
“I’m getting everyone a Butterbeer,” Padma said from the doorway to the girls’ dormitories. She had a giant, sequined, and flapping blue butterfly pinned to her top. “But then you’ve all got to get me one. It is my birthday.”
Ollivander’s chair creaked as he leant forward again, and Draco’s attention snapped back onto him. "This wand is different to the ones I make. It’s also different from the ancient ones I’ve seen. It seems that you, Draco Malfoy, are becoming a wandmaker. A true wandmaker finds their own way, makes their own mark on the world of magic."
Draco put his hand on the door, ready to push it open, when he felt a faint whisper run through him. He stopped, closed his eyes, and let himself sink into the feeling. This wood – this oak wood – was old and creaky, but under that was the sensation of being a great tree in an ancient forest, the seasons mere scratchings of time. The rushing song of life was still there, like an echo, under all the years the wood had been only a door.
Draco stared at Harry, then at the hideous orange and brown curtains, then burst into laughter. A warm bubble of relief rose up in Harry. This wasn’t like last time. It was still hot and a little desperate, but the same hate wasn’t there. Something had changed: it took him a moment to realise what.
They walked back, with long strides and not much talk, as Harry tried to work out what Malfoy meant.
A far-off crack drew their attention, and Malfoy swore softly. They began a slow descent towards the farm, taking care to stay out of sight. Harry was grateful that the snow wasn’t settling, as it would have made their progress more difficult, but he still wasn’t enjoying the way his fingers and toes were aching in the cold. Neither of them spoke, and Harry was determined that this time he would prove that he was trying, that he was worthy of the title ‘Auror’.
“The point is, a young man might adapt the traditions, but they’d still be recognisable. A symbol of availability, a conversation about moonlight, and so on.”
“There’s more to breakfast than toast and cereal,” said Harry. “We haven’t even started yet. There’s pancakes and French toast, there’s eggs Benedict and a good old-fashioned fry-up. There’s—”
By the time Harry had dragged them into his room, they were indeed both naked. Harry pushed Draco onto the bed, and rubbed his palm across the Tinkerbell tattoo on Draco’s side. Draco squirmed, Potter’s firm touch both arousing and embarrassing.
“I’ll be fine.” Harry held out his arms to hug Molly before she could express any kind of pity. He longed for peace and quiet. She embraced him tightly, all cinnamon and vanilla, then thrust an overflowing basket of food into his hands.
He was aware of Draco watching the three of them talk, felt the heat prickle through his body again. Did Draco know what Harry was going to do? He didn’t know.
That night, Harry moved into the back bedroom, and slept in a bed that smelled like a blond coffee nut, who acted like a prick most of the time but was also clever and funny, and turned the most wonderful shade of pink when Harry spoke to snakes. Harry was, as he had said, confused by Malfoy; but the thing he kept coming back to, again and again, was the feeling of Malfoy's lips and his mouth moving against his own, and the certainty that Malfoy had kissed him back.
"Didn’t you wonder why I only use naturally fallen wood for my fires? It takes me ages to collect enough firewood to see me through the winter."
Perhaps it was the presence of the other – a Death Eater cancelling out a Chosen One – but no one approached them as they made their way to the Ogilvy’s. Rather than go into the busy shop, Draco rang the doorbell on the door at the side.
Draco was bustled into his tiny kitchen, and before he knew it he’d opened the wine and had followed Pansy out into the garden. She was standing in the shaded courtyard, staring out to the long thin lawn that ran all the way to the railway tracks. Along the neighbouring fences, Draco had left the grass to grow long, bright with colourful swathes of poppies and buttercups he gently encouraged with some of his mother’s spells.
“So, you want to what, fix this room?” Harry looked around him at the charred and smoke-marked walls, the piles of ash, the dark corners. “That doesn’t seem possible.”
"Potter, do you think that you could say 'I am Harry Potter, heir of Sirius Black,' in Parseltongue?" said Malfoy, his voice straining with the effort of maintaining both spells. Harry cast his eyes about for a snake, wishing now he hadn't already spoken to the one in the painting. He glanced over at the dining room door and its coiled snake doorknob, and turned back to Malfoy, and repeated the words in Parseltongue. He heard a chorused hissing sound, as the snakes of the house responded; he also felt the shudder that passed through Malfoy at the sound. His line on the tree in the air was still not as bright as the others, but now it did not flicker at all: it had transformed slightly, to become a slender serpent, the mouth hanging onto his name, the tail curled tight around the name above, Sirius.
“Come along, we don’t want to be late,” Hermione said. Ron rolled his eyes, but followed her into the Floo.
“Does that awful Griselda still live there? I never liked her. Terribly bossy.” His mouth turned downwards in distaste.
They walked back afterwards, pleasantly full and in a companionable silence. When they stopped by the front door, the thick snake which formed the doorknob uncurled slightly to greet Harry again. By the time they had got inside, Harry's cheeks were burning, the snake having asked him how the sex on a stick was; Malfoy also looked a little flushed, and Harry resolved to find more opportunities to talk to snakes.
Malfoy was quiet, and he bit at his lip in a way that reminded Harry, for a moment, of Hermione. “I guess it would be good to be here when it isn’t so cold and dark,” Malfoy said. “I’ve been worried about what would happen if someone noticed I was missing during the day.” His mouth made a sardonic quirk. “I’d not thought that you’d be tracking me at night.”
“It’s fine—” Draco stopped, sure he’d heard a voice calling out. He turned to see a figure in the distance, waving.
A low rumbling rattle filled the room as a train went past, and it seemed fitting somehow. Harry felt as shaky and unsettled as the room. With everything lost, with everything stripped back and fallen away, what did Harry have to lose? Everything, and nothing. He’s spent all night thinking about this, and he dug deep for the resolve he’d found as the rising sun had lit the sky. Maybe he just hadn’t been foolish enough yet; maybe he didn’t want things to go back to how they had been.
and made a great show of reading it, turning the pages noisily and running his finger under certain parts of the text.
Malfoy. Or… or maybe he did. Harry sighed. The man was such a bundle of contradictions, Harry never knew what to make of him. He decided to pass the time making a list of what he did know about Malfoy.
“And us too?” Hermione said. “I— We’re not quite ready to set up on our own. I’m thinking that I’d like to finish my studies first.”
In fact, no matter how dull and irritating Robards was, Harry realised, there was something behind his words. There had been a war, and the threat from Dark magic was real, Harry knew that. He remembered the way Slytherin’s locket had twisted his thoughts and feelings, and he knew that it didn’t need a Voldemort to destroy life: it could happen on a person by person basis.
“I’m supposed to get a medical – you know, a physical, for work – and I wanted a doctor who used Muggle medicine as well as magic. When she said that’s what you do, I thought I’d book an appointment.”
Draco was quiet. “I like Dudley,” he said in the end, turning to face Harry. “He reminds me a bit of… well, me, actually. He told me once, how he and his friends used to treat other people.” He looked at Harry. “He meant you, didn’t he?”
“In my dream,” Draco said in a quiet but strained voice. “In my dream we stripped each other naked and then you fucked me.”
“He stays out of everyone’s eye. Sometimes Pansy and Blaise would arrange a meal or something – you know, in a Muggle place – but he never returned their owls. Of course, they stopped asking me, too, when… well, when I left my last place.”
“It’s new,” Henry said, the words mangled slightly as he popped a corner of bread in his mouth. “Sorry.” He swallowed, and came to sit at the table with two thick earthen plates and some bread, cheese, and apples. “Its use is spreading: once you try it, you never go back.”
“Harry, how great to see you! Come and sit with us. Lavender popped over to meet me for a coffee and was telling me how St Mungo’s is going.”
A spark and a crackle drew Draco’s attention to his side, where a small fire was burning. Sparks flew up into the night sky, and the heat was welcome in the dark night. As Draco scrambled to pull the blanket over himself – the fire only heated one side of him – he saw the man sitting on the other side of the fire. Dancing flames were reflected in round lenses, and there again was that mop of hair. A messy bird’s nest of hair that Draco hadn’t seen in years.
“We’re investigating the Snitches from a couple of recent Quidditch matches,” Potter said, giving the dates. “As I understand it, you were the League official in charge of checking the balls.”
Remembering Borgin and Burkes, Draco stepped through expecting to see Dark artefacts. Instead he was greeted by dusty shelves filled with pots with illegible labels.
Draco bumped his head on the steeply sloping ceiling of the kitchen, and scowled before sitting at the small table pushed up against the wall. An over-flowing ashtray sat in the middle of the table, and Draco slid it a little further towards the other side while Pansy made him a cup of tea.
“Oh, right, sorry. It curses the victim to see false futures." Her smile faltered a little. "I’m sorry, Draco: it means that someone wanted to curse you to madness.”
Harry knew that this was, at some level, a serious conversation about Malfoy’s experiences during the war, but suddenly he wanted to laugh. He was very keenly aware of the fact that the sparkles in Malfoy’s hair were now throwing light reflections onto the walls of the kitchen. A small snort of laughter escaped his lips.
Malfoy stepped around the half-open door, then shut it behind him. The end of his wand was lit, the light quivering like a flame. His shadow moved on the wall, a flicker that shrank and grew in the darkness.
“When I first came here I found myself wanting to reach out and catch them,” Draco admitted, a little ruefully.
He continued to annoy Ron with pleasant remarks and positivity. Really, living with Draco had been far too good a training in how to wind someone up. Especially by being nice.
They sat in a small sitting room at the front of the house, and Draco was surprised yet again when a wizened old house-elf appeared and bowed deeply. A whirling sensation filled his body; Draco couldn’t quite work out where he was. By the time tea arrived, his stomach had settled a little, and Draco was able to sip his tea without the cup and saucer trembling too noticeably.
Harry’s head was beginning to spin. “And what’s the difference between a handshake and a hand clasp?”
When he felt the firm pressure of a foot against his, under the table, with a small, matching smirk on Malfoy's face, Harry ceased to be aware of any of the words being spoken in the room. He wasn't sure if it was accidental or not, and he didn't catch Malfoy's eye again, but the foot remained where it was, pressing ever so slightly into his own. Harry watched as Malfoy's mouth opened and closed, and he was dimly aware that words were coming out, and that others were listening, but at that moment it was beyond him.
“Let’s leave the name-calling out of it. How about I see if any of my contacts have heard anything, and you do the same.”
“Indeed.” McGonagall pursed her lips. “And it is also risky; there is a high chance of permanent injury or scarring.” She surveyed the class. “So, no performing it on yourselves or each other. What then are the uses of the charm?”
“I’ll take that as a yes. I’ll meet you on the corner of Windmill Street and Charlotte Street at eight. Don’t be late.”
“Go on.” Harry felt a swirling excitement build in his belly. This felt as though they were getting somewhere.
“Look, I’ll try to keep my afternoons free. You can owl or Floo if you need me. How does that sound?”
Looking around the Room, he caught Ginny’s eye. She was sitting with Blaise, who had a hand resting lightly on her arm. She smiled at Harry, and they nodded at each other. It was, he realised, the final farewell to whatever they’d had between them.
Above them, the sounds of someone waking up could be heard: muffled footsteps, pipes clanging and old timber creaking. In comparison the silence in the room grew oppressive, and Harry felt compelled to fill the silence. “I mean… it’s different from lessons at school, or even when Ron and Hermione and I were hunting the Horcruxes. It’s… it’s hard work.”
“Bubbles?” Harry asked, trying to puncture the tight feeling in his chest by teasing Malfoy. It didn’t work.
“You do know I’m not her keeper, right?” Harry thought he better answer Zabini’s question. It was strange the thought of him and Ginny being together: it felt as though it happened a long time ago. “As it happens we aren’t together, no.”
tendency?” Millie snorted. “If you mean ‘be bullies’ I think you might be right,” Millie said. “You and Draco certainly kept at each other, didn’t you?”
"Seeing as you got here at a decent time yesterday, I thought we could get another full day here again," said Malfoy, taking his coffee without a word of thanks. Harry held on to the flash of irritation this caused with relief, being much simpler to deal with than fluttering hearts.
“My trip?” Dudley grinned. “It was awesome. Whenever you two love birds are dressed, come find me and I’ll show you my photos.” He yawned. “I’ve been travelling for about 48 hours to get back in time for Christmas, though. I think I’ll have a lie-down first.” He frowned. “You two aren’t noisy, are you? I need to sleep.”
Once feeling calmer, Harry opened his eyes and looked around. Thick clematis grew all over the old brick walls of the garden, and Harry was reminded of a story about a secret garden his primary school teacher had read to the class. Occasional white flowers bloomed amongst the leaves. Although the whole garden was paved, planters and pots of various shapes and sizes were placed all around its edge. The only thing growing in them appeared to be weeds: tall spindly grass gone to seed, the tall pointed leaves of dandelions, small creeping plants that filled all the space, and the prickle of brambles from one tall pot in the corner.
"It doesn’t matter," Harry said, "Because we are doing it now." Now sun-warmed, he came to join Draco in the shade. "Although it would have been great if you could have embraced naked bathing a bit sooner."
expert on Snitches. Either Potter was desperate or well-informed. The note mentioned a “sensitive case”, and Draco assumed that Potter was still slogging away in the Auror department. He’d always imagined Potter rushing about, his robes crookedly buttoned and his hair sticking in all directions, blundering through one case after the other and lovingly tolerated by his fans in the Ministry. His life being everything, in other words, that Draco’s was not.
Potter was back by the chestnut tree. An old tree, it had low-running boughs, and Potter rested his hand on one of these.
Draco’s own cock was digging into the bed almost painfully, and it twitched almost violently at the sound of Harry’s groan, but he didn’t care. All his attention now was on Harry, on the dark shadowed space in front of him. He could feel the pucker of Harry’s arse quiver and loosen beneath his tongue, and began to lick stripes from bottom to top. Gradually, he increased the pressure, until Harry’s hips began to buck and his body twist.
Flitwick stopped the class to explain the two charms needed to complete the Protean Charm. “Remember that this charm changes the
Harry though, deflated, his shoulders slumping, and his head falling forward. Panic clawed up inside Draco; he had gone too far.
Everything was happening too fast, and Draco looked at his mother in confusion. He’d only begun to think that he might grasp the idea that his father was actually suggesting that he go off with this stranger. He wasn’t expecting to actually leave that moment.
The breath caught in Harry's throat as Malfoy took first one, then another step towards him. Each step increased the sense of danger in the room.
"Really?" said Harry. "I had Voldemort as my sworn enemy, and I'm not too sure about that." Malfoy looked shocked, actually starting slightly when Harry said Voldemort's name, but then he shook his head and let out a thin laugh.
Draco shook his head, because Harry couldn’t possibly mean any of this. Whether or not it had been true, Harry would walk away. Because the curse had been right: he didn’t have a future.
“Everywhere I went this summer, the rain followed. I never thought I’d be glad to get back to this country just to avoid the damp.” The sharp and sure voice of Pansy Parkinson stabbed through the air. Her hair was cut in the severest of bobs, and her shirt was buttoned up to the neck. She looked, Harry thought, rather scary. She was talking to Malfoy who wasn’t looking at her, his eyes fixed on the screen. And he had the cheek to berate Harry for his lack of manners.
“Some people think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named used a form of the charm, that the Dark Mark was Charmed so that when he touched one, the Marks on every Death Eater’s arm called them to him.”
“I know. But I’ve been trying to get this spell right all week, and all I’ve managed so far is a shadow.”
Harry’s cheeks heated at the suggestion in her words. He saw again cold stone and a hot mouth, but pushed the image away. “I can’t believe I have to say this, but you do know that nothing’s happening, right?”
Draco waited. He went to take another sip of his tea, but it was cold, so he laid the cup aside. Instead he held onto the beech wand, drawing strength from it.
“With the other Seeker having the most powerful influence, but not the only ones to be able to mess up things?”
Despite the introduction, Draco was still surprised when Harry Potter walked into the consulting room. He clenched his hands together tightly behind his desk. Melissa had been in the room with him a moment before, winking; this wasn’t a vision. He dug his thumb nail into the palm of his hand, and the small jolt of pain was enough to persuade him that, yes, this was real.
The Leaky was fairly quiet, but it didn’t stop the few people in there staring. Harry was used to a certain amount of attention, but he felt Malfoy stiffen beside him.
” Water spurted out of the end of his wand, as the apples tumbled back down behind him. “It works,” he said, grinning at Harry.
The lessons were being divided between the two subjects. Hermione had already told Harry that it would come up in both sets of exams. Harry listened for Susan’s answer, because he still wasn’t entirely clear how it worked - despite using the Charmed coins Hermione had made for Dumbledore’s Army.
“No, it’s not that. His family don’t see anyone, and as far as I know he sort of disappeared around the same time, I, er, did.”
“You are family!” Ron protested, but Harry shook his head. It was a different son that Molly needed, and that one would never come home again. Deep under the sadness, in a thought that he’d never shared with his friends but that he’d worried over enough times in the middle of the night, Harry felt that if only he’d been able to defeat Voldemort sooner, Fred and all the others would still be alive. It twisted, a tight pain, within him.
"And yet you both still call each other Malfoy and Potter?" asked Severus. Harry and Malfoy looked at him then back at each other and nodded, because what else would they call each other? Potter and Malfoy were their names. Severus shook his head. "I have a feeling that you two—" he stopped. "You two will have to work this out for yourself."
The only sounds in the room after that were Harry’s rather shaky breaths as he watched, and the gentle thwack of skin on skin, along with the quiet grunts that escaped the Harry and Draco on the bed. Draco’s hair caught the light, like the golden stubble of a field. Harry was absolutely transfixed by the sight.
A giggle from the other side of the room drew Harry’s attention away from Malfoy. Hermione and Luna were sitting together. Their chats were usually fairly quiet, so it made Harry smile to see them a little merry. The excitement of the flood, perhaps, had Luna in such a good mood.
“The wizarding part was only added a few years ago. It’s some regeneration project – you know, to bring the wizarding world closer to the Muggle one, raise awareness and so on.”
“I’m in no position to say anything bad about Potter or Muggles. Although now we’re not at school or war, Potter seems harmless. Scruffy and quiet.”
Malfoy folded his arms and sighed, and Harry realised he wanted to unpack or freshen up or whatever it was that snobby blond wizards did when they arrived somewhere.
"It’s beautiful." Indeed, Draco turned it in his hand with a wandmaker’s eye. Following the natural shape of a piece of wood was an art in itself, and he could see the minute ways it had been reshaped to work better as a walking aid. Most of all though, it had a simplicity and elegance that he had strived to achieve himself in the past. Not always with this degree of success. "Did you make it today?"
“Britain. People know who I am.” Harry’s heart dropped, but he knew it was true. Susan was only one person, but there were others out there who felt the same. He didn’t know what Draco would have to do to be accepted; maybe it would never be possible. And yet he wanted it, wanted to be able to have Draco by his side. Openly.
When Harry arrived back at the house, Malfoy in tow, the house was unnaturally quiet, except for the odd faint hoot from above. Malfoy paused in front of the big door.
A pile of gilt-edged invites were currently gathering dust on his mantelpiece. Was there a Ministry event coming up that he’d forgotten about? It wouldn’t surprise him if Kingsley wanted to make sure Harry would turn up. A quiet word on a busy night would be typical of Kingsley’s style. Harry sighed. Although he was much in demand for such events, he usually only responded from invites from people who he knew – and respected. If he found dressing up for family Halloween party pointless… well, a ball was not his idea of fun.
“That it was. Does this mean,” Malfoy looked up, his knife in one hand and an onion in the other, “that you really weren’t the golden boy everyone thought you were?”
Malfoy was silent, and when he did speak, he was quiet. "There are worse things in life than paperwork, Potter," he said.
Third, Malfoy was falling behind in some of his classes, especially those involving any form of wand work. His pale skin would flush and his grip on his wand would tighten in silent frustration, but his defensive spells were weak, his Transfigurations never quite right.
“You roll your own. Of course you do,” said Draco when Potter opened it to reveal a small pouch of tobacco. “I should have known.” But then Potter was doing it, thick fingers and fine paper and out came his tongue and Draco wanted every cigarette he smoked from now on to be one that Potter had rolled. Potter put the skinny cigarette to his mouth, then lit the end with his wand and passed it to Draco. His eyes lingered as Draco took his first drag, but looked away as Draco blew smoke out.
When he returned home with his latest book under his arm, it was to a scene of chaos. Water was gushing down the stairs, like a carpeted waterfall. Harry was rather tempted to close the front door and come back again later, but unfortunately Greg saw him before he had a chance to actually do it.
Back on the rooftop of the Auror school, Harry contemplated the sky above him, stars twinkling in the darkness despite the background light of the city around him. The moon was wide and bright again, casting dark shadows but bleeding everything around him of colour. He wasn’t expecting anyone to find him, but he had forgotten that of course there was one person who knew about his hideaway.
about him and Malfoy, about the hours they spent together, and the Prefects’ bathroom, and the thoughts and feelings Harry kept so carefully locked away.
Was Harry flirting with him? Was it possible that there was an interest there? Draco looked after Harry’s retreating figure, and tried to work it out. They had gone swimming together, but there had been no rubbing of lotion, nothing more suggestive than information about Harry’s tan. He was sure Harry hadn’t realised what his strawberry-stained fingers near Draco’s mouth did to him. Draco was under this stupid curse, and he was probably seeing more than there was.
Harry’s throat felt even tighter at the word ‘family’. He’d given up on having one when Sirius had died. Somehow the strength he felt flowing from her hand to his gave him the courage to say, “I know I’ve been rubbish so far, but do you think I could be family, too?”
Harry said the words along with everyone else, but he swallowed his pumpkin juice with difficulty. His throat was tight as he sat back down.
“You wouldn’t say that if you’d seen the rules wizards are expected to follow. There’s a whole book of them; Aunt Mildred had it.
“I can understand why Ron is finding it difficult. There’s just so much…” Harry hesitated. So much… gut-churning frustration, and blond-topped sneering, and competition and the suspicion that something was going very wrong in the Sixth Year, and it was, wasn’t it? He remembered Malfoy bleeding on the bathroom floor. “So much history,” he said.
Draco’s hand went to his face. His nose and cheeks felt hot to the touch, but he had been sleeping in the heat. Surely that was all.
Molly looked at the two of them, Ron holding Hermione’s hand and Hermione biting her lip slightly, and sighed. “I can see that,” she said quietly. She leant forward, and took Hermione’s hand. “Keep an open mind about the cooking, dear,” she said. “After all, I do believe that the two of you will want to share all things equally, no?“ Hermione looked surprised, as though she’d not considered cooking in those terms. Before she could say anything, though, Molly spoke again. “Whatever I say about cooking, I do know that Ron is lucky to have a clever and brave witch like you in his life.” Molly patted Hermione’s hand, and sat back looking pleased with herself.
Harry took a deep breath. “Whatever you choose to eat is fine. I’m offering to teach you a few extra things to cook, so you can choose them, too.”
Draco found it hard to focus on Weasley’s words, but Harry managed a response. “I thought the balls were switched?”
“I hate to look at an instrument like this, and think of buying or selling it. But I guess that’s your job, not mine.”
"You’re here, aren’t you? At the edge, near the darkness. Like me." He looked over his shoulder at the forest. "For me it’s full of the dead, but I want to be in it, too. I can’t think where else I belong anymore."
Walking had been helping, so maybe that’s what he needed to do now. Walk away from having to think about cupboards and childhoods. He could focus instead on the feeling of moving, his feet hitting the pavement, and the sights and smells of the town.
“You, Draco Malfoy, are such a brat. But I like you.” Harry’s mouth moved along Draco’s jawline, tasting him as he went. Draco’s knees quivered again, and he pulled Harry in for a long, sustaining kiss.
If only it were hate. That would be so much easier than the mixture of frustration and knee-melting longing Draco usually experienced. He shrugged though, unwilling to reveal anything of this to Potter. “Hate’s too strong a word for the ennui you inspire. But please, let’s not pretend that we’ll ever be the best of friends.”
"Oh, it just asked me something which the one upstairs asked the other day. I was just a little... confused."
“Exactly, Potter. Delicate and not to be touched, flesh memories or not.” Privately, Draco was rather pleased to hear that Potter though the wings pretty: he’d always thought so, too. He stood up, and removed his apron. “I want to show you something downstairs, anyway. I think it would be better if we moved you away from any temptation.”
He left Draco snoring softly and crept downstairs to rustle up some breakfast and coffee though he stopped outside the door to the sitting room. A most hideous mess greeted him and Harry sighed. There was a downside to having energetic sex within range of an array of suggestive foods. A couple of sweeps of his wand put most of the room to rights.
Harry looked over at Ron. He had hoped this wouldn’t come up, but it had, and now he had no idea what to do.
Rising out of sleep, Draco blinked in confusion. He was alone in bed. The knocking on the door persisted, and after a while Draco realised that Greg was probably out. He pulled on some pyjama bottoms, then went to see who was so desperate to get them to open up.
Henry and Draco stowed their brooms in a small copse of trees and walked into town. Henry carefully dragged a large suitcase behind him, and Draco was tasked with carrying the large and awkward folding table. Henry had made it look easy the day before, as though it weighed nothing. By the time they got to the market square though, Draco’s shins were bruised and his hands red and sore.
Hannah raised her hand as well as Hermione, which surprised Harry, as she, like him, often preferred sitting back in class. “Is it because of all the layers we’ve created? Making copies, the connecting charm, and then the double-charm of the Protean Charm itself?”
Narcissa’s embroidery needle slipped in and out white linen as she talked, and the leaf she was working on grew a little more defined. She paused for a moment, and Draco noticed her fingers shaking. Neither mentioned it. “With only one house-elf, we can only keep a few rooms open. Your father would never have approved, but as he’s not here I don’t think that matters.” Narcissa’s voice betrayed the barest of tremors as she mentioned Lucius, now onto his fifth year spent ‘wintering’ in sunnier climes. “Twinky should be able to do it herself. I’d like to have everything finished before winter sets in.”
“You missed out how badly she flirted with you,” Potter said. Draco could only describe the look on his face as
Although he half-expected Malfoy to crumple again, instead he stood taller, held his head high. “I had to. I wanted - I want - to have a chance to… change things. To find a way to make up for it. I… I know I can’t change what happened, but…” He trailed off, his eyes fixed on Harry with a strange brightness. “You changed things. You killed the Dark Lord.”
He had watched, discreetly, as Potter, Weasley, and Granger talked. They talked about plans for the future, about where they wanted to travel to, about magic they wanted to learn.
“Is this usually offered as part of the NEWTs? I don’t remember seeing it anywhere on the syllabus, although I’ve only gone back ten years and—”
“What do you mean, ‘Spattergroit’,” said Hermione. “This is important.” She stopped walking, forcing all three of them to stop. “Harry,” she said, letting go of Ron and holding onto Harry’s hands with both of her own. “I’m so happy for you,” she smiled. “I had no idea, but it makes sense. I love you, and I’m glad you’ve been able to work this out.” And then she enveloped him in a bear hug. “Thank you for telling us.”
“I think it suits you that you’re not busy saving the world,” Parvati said. “It must have been exhausting.”
Lavender hadn’t been there at the start of term. It had been so confusing, those first few days, and so many hadn’t returned that Harry had assumed that she wouldn’t be coming back either. When he’d seen her that last day, with the castle in ruins around them and victory muted by grief’s shocked silence, she’d seemed to be halfway between the living and the dead herself. Parvati had sat by her side, weeping, while Trelawney watched over them both with a pale face and occasional swigs from a hip flask.
“I don’t really want to discuss this with the DMLE,” said Draco. “I didn’t at the time, and not much has changed on that front. It’s… personal. I’m not in any danger, and you say you’ve caught the assailant?” He looked over at Goosander, who nodded. “I’d rather talk to just Harry about this, if you don’t mind. Some of this concerns him, and he can report back if any of it is pertinent to your case. Would that be acceptable?”
“Lavender.” He moved up on the sofa to make room for her, but she sat in the armchair nearest the fire.
Malfoy looked at the bed, then back over to Harry. “I suppose I don’t really have much choice,” he said. “I sleep on the left,” he added.
“I– I– don’t know.” For some reason, Harry thought of Draco flushing, the pink blush spreading as he ducked his head. He shook his head to clear the image away. “He’s OK though. Not as quiet as I thought, and… quite good company, actually.”
"Oh yeah, I forgot he had a silly name for me." Harry yawned. "It saves us having to use my actual name."
Once they’d slightly awkwardly sung Happy Birthday, and slightly less awkwardly all had a slice of cake - cake did make Ron happy - they talked through all that had happened to repair the room. Harry and Draco explained about Fiendfyre and magic, about how the room had gradually grown the stone trees and had not appeared to them in any other form than this one. Draco described the effect of their magic, Harry the effect of their cooperation.
“Fine.” Harry rubbed his knees as he tried to remember everything he’d read. “Fiendfyre is a curse, it doesn’t occur naturally but has to be set by someone.”
Malfoy's explanation actually made sense, so Harry swallowed back his grumbles and went to fetch the first object, when Malfoy barked out "Stop!"
"Draco, you were obsessed with Potter, obsessed! I don't know how many times I had to endure hearing about—" her voice rose but Malfoy cut her off.
“Look, let’s not talk about work. It’s late, and I’m tired.” Harry gave Draco a small smile, trying to show that he had missed his company, that he just wanted to sit and drink tea and chat. “I heard a joke the other day.”
Malfoy got the Countdown conundrum before either contestant, and as the ads came back on again he picked up his cold tea. “We have to talk about this,” he said.
Harry grasped Draco’s dick and gave it a long, slow rub. Draco thrust up into his hand. “Patience,” Harry said, and he smiled. He held up his other hand and waggled his eyebrows. “
They walked, side by side, their arms brushing from time to time. Draco didn’t know if Harry felt it too, the waves of delicious shock sent through his body with each touch. If he did, he didn’t show it. Draco lost track of where they were, of anything around him, as he focused on the touches, on the warmth of Harry in that tiny moment. He only became aware again of his surroundings when Harry stopped walking. To the left of the path was a small body of open water, filled with Muggles.
When their notes are complete, Harry and Malfoy rise together. The book reshelved, they walk out, bodies pressed close, and hands entwined.
When Draco came with one final “Harry!”, he collapsed forward on the bed as his knees finally gave up entirely. Harry’s weight pressed down on top of him as he pushed into him once, twice more, and came himself.
Harry crossed the room to join her. The street was quiet below, parked cars and the little square framed by the bare lines of winter branches. “Do you think you could be happy here, you and Teddy?”
McGonagall looked at Dumbledore’s portrait, then between the two of them. “Well, I have to say it, you have surprised me. I need to see what you have done to the room, but if what you say is true… it has ramifications for the other parts of the castle that remain resistant to repair.”
“I’ll find something, your fussiness.” Potter said. “Come on.” He led Draco into a sitting room with a huge tapestry covering the far wall. Draco had seen such family trees before, but had never expected to find one in Potter’s home. Draco found himself puzzled by Potter’s contradictions. “Look.” Potter walked up to the family tree and crouched down, pointing to one of the names. Draco joined him, and stared at his own name.
It took several days, but in the end Harry plucked up the courage to take a more direct path to finding out what Malfoy was up to. He’d already stuffed his cloak under his pillow, and waited until Malfoy went to the bathroom to sneak out and make his way to the Room of Requirement. Malfoy had been visiting it every night, and he didn’t suppose this would be any different.
When he woke, the room was filled with the angular lines of white moonlight and shadow. His head had eased to a dull ache above one eye. He listened for even breathing from across the room; it often helped to calm him, to lull him back to sleep, listening  to the sound of another human respiring. But it wasn’t a calm night of sleep for Draco. A soft whimpering filled the room, interspersed with the odd murmured word. Harry held his breath and listened. He shouldn’t, he knew, it was trespassing on the most intimate of unconscious thought, but what choice did he have, in the quiet of the night?
“This used to be the dining room, but it made more sense like this. I’ll show you the old sitting room when we go upstairs. I—” Harry didn’t really want to have to go in there again. “It’s the only room free, for you that is. But… you might not want to sleep in there. You can decide for yourself.”
“Mmm, all that pale skin. Untouched.” Harry slid a hand onto Draco’s side. “I’d never seen anything like it.”
“I know but… that was only fair. Didn’t mean I wanted to have to train with him. Or go ask him for tips, thank you very much. I haven’t forgotten what he was like in school. Have you?”
“After I missed seeing ‘Mione and the kids this weekend?” Ron shook his head. “Fine, I’ll cover for you, but you owe me one. And no more stakeouts for a while!”
“Please?” Hermione said. “Molly’s a wonderful woman, but I… I can’t…” Her eyes began to brim with tears. Ron wrapped an arm around her and gave Harry another look of entreaty.
The desire to run away is even stronger in Harry now, because what he really longs to do is not pull back but push closer. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. This proves to be a mistake, as Harry becomes aware of the hint of fresh citrus in the air, and realises that he is busy inhaling Malfoy's
“You used magic, and you saw the bigger picture,” said Draco. He shook his head. “Now I’m going to have to try twice as hard to keep ahead.”
Draco shook his head. “There are a few Snidgets left in the world. Most of them are in a reserve in Somerset.” An image of Potter, hair ruffled by the breeze and small yellow birds darting past him, sprang to Draco’s mind. He wondered if he’d find them as enchanting as Draco did. “I should take you there sometime; it really is amazing.”
“Imagine if she knew we were married,” Henry muttered and Draco laughed rather than telling him off for saying the ‘M’ word. Waking up in a bed with Henry each morning, and eating every meal together certainly looked like married life, he knew.
“I don’t know if I can.” Blaise’s eyes darted to the index box by Harry’s legs. “I do like you though, Harry. I’d like to think we’re friends.”
It didn’t look particularly good, Harry being caught with his mouth hanging open as he let out a particularly loud yawn, just as the Minister of bloody Magic had told him all about his latest conversation with his Muggle counterpart. Despite their years of friendship, Harry felt Kingsley’s patience wearing thin by the end of their time together.
When they’d finished their coffees Draco rose and put the cups in the sink. He turned, and Harry was standing there. Waiting for him. Draco put his arms around Harry, and Harry put his arms around Draco. They stood there, by the sink, and Draco buried his head in Harry’s shoulder, relaxing into the familiar warmth of Harry’s body, and inhaling the scent of his skin.
“I’m not only  here to talk to you about loss. Or scars.” Lavender put the book down on his desk. “Hermione said that you’ve got some issues with Draco Malfoy.” Harry felt ice-cold prickles travel down his back. How did Hermione know? He leant forward as his chest tightened. And then he realised that she didn’t mean kissing or sex, but fighting and hatred, and he relaxed a fraction, resting back against the wall behind him.
“I—” Draco hesitated. “I don’t think I want to know about last time. But… I suppose so.” He looked up. “I’ll help you.”
The scraping of chairs was the first Harry knew that the meeting was over: he had no idea what had been discussed, or decided. He didn't care. But then Malfoy also rose, and Harry felt panic rise at the thought that he would step out of the room and belong to everyone else again. He wanted the warmth against his foot. He wanted the impatience and the tailored trousers, and the rich scent of fresh coffee. But Malfoy was walking away, and somehow Harry knew that this was it. This would end up being a near-miss, a regret he would feel every time he heard that voice cut into a conversation. Harry cursed himself: he was so used to life passing him by, he didn't know how to grasp this one thing he wanted, more than he had wanted anything for years. Harry's head slumped forward. The sound of the door closing was a final goodbye to his chance for... whatever it was he could have had.
"Beautiful? That's what you have to say about a Grade Four MacInnister Search and Discover Tracing Charm?" Malfoy sighed, then shook his head slightly. He tilted his head as if thinking, and looked at Harry for a moment. "Ok, I can accept that as an adequate response – if I take into account the fact that you obviously know nothing about my field of work. Thank you," he said, and took a sip of his coffee.
“Yes. I find it most unsettling to see your face twist into an approximation of pleasure in my presence.”
“We shall let Madam Pomfrey be the judge of that!” She shook her head, looking weary for a moment. “Of all the things I had to worry about this year, I had not considered this possibility.”
Parvati was right, it was bloody cold outside, but Harry kept striding into it until his cheeks grew hot with exertion and his ears were stinging from the wind. At least he felt it, rather than the crushing sense of… whatever kept him awake and sitting on the sofa.
“My mother once told me that it would never matter what I did,” Malfoy said, turning to face Harry. “People would only see my name, my stupid hair, and this fucking mark on my arm.” Malfoy drew up his coat sleeve, and Harry caught sight of thick black lines against white skin, before Malfoy pushed his sleeve down again. It was horribly fascinating, and Harry wanted to look at again, and to reach out and find out how it felt beneath his fingers. He wondered if touching it would somehow make his own scar hurt, but then he remembered that Voldemort was dead and gone, and that nothing would make his scar hurt again.
A bloom of annoyance sprang up, at how close Potter was standing and how he was practically holding his hand, and then he had the gall to
“A little consulting.” Potter turned in his chair to look at Sarah. “Also I really do need a personal physician with good knowledge of both worlds.” The warmth came back to his voice, to his face, as he gave her a small smile. The frown didn’t leave her face.
Draco pulled Harry into a kiss. Harry felt as if he was being devoured. It had been a very long time indeed since he had bottomed, mostly due to circumstance and lack of opportunity, but he was greedy: he wanted all of Draco. He wanted Draco to have all of him.
"Hogwarts was the first place I remember feeling like home. But now..." Harry trailed off, uncertain how to put into words how he felt. It was like the warm weight of Teddy by his side: real, solid, and it filled him with hope.
“Maybe,” said Harry, but he couldn’t see how. Still, it was warm by the fire, and he felt the calmest he had in days sitting there with her.
Potter nodded. "Well, it’s not too hard to work out when the limb is lying beneath the tree, is it? Oak wood, and oak tree", he said pointing at the fire and then the tree. "Plus it… felt like it belonged."
In the end, no one saw them walk in together. They were swallowed up in the stream of other students also rushing in eager not to miss the start of dinner, and then Professor Slughorn stopped Malfoy before they could reach their table to ask him a question. Harry’s heart, which had been burbling up high in his chest, dropped like a stone. Hermione barely looked up as he sat down beside her, and when he looked back at Malfoy, still stuck with Professor Slughorn, the way Malfoy’s shoulders looked, tightly set, seemed to Harry to suggest a kind of disappointment, too.
"Oh," said Harry. The mental image evaporated away, replaced with embarrassment. He usually hoped that Kreacher didn't mind him, but didn't expect to hear Kreacher's feelings described in such positive terms. "Well... Hermione would say just remember to say please and thank you if you want a house-elf to like you."
Harry didn’t know what to say to this, because he had been keeping an eye on Malfoy day and night. Malfoy was right to think he was treated with suspicion.
Harry looked around the room. He could see how this could be comfortable, how he and his friends could sit in front of the fire, drinking tea and chatting, or spread their homework out at the study tables.
“That’s brilliant!” Pride burst through Harry, and he pulled her into a hug, knocking off her huge hat in the process. It fell into the sea, but he Summoned it back and dried it before handing it back.
“I know, but I was… it didn’t seem real. The visions, that is.” Draco hated himself for messing everything up so badly. He could be honest, now. Even if it was too late. “I was scared of frightening you away.” He looked down, his throat tight with shame. “Like I scare everyone else away.”
Malfoy’s smile became a little strained. “It’ supposed to last a few hours. But, er, Greg’s been like this since breakfast.”
“I guess,” she said. She closed her eyes. “This is helping,” she said. “I wanted to be angry with you, Harry, but I’m feeling strangely calm right now.”
The room was cold. Harry hadn’t really realised that before, but now, as the dampness on his hand and against his stomach cooled, he shivered. As if coming up through water, he saw where he was: in a dark, decrepit bedroom. A place he hated. With a man he… hated. Didn’t he? Harry reached down, pulled his trousers up a little, and took a step back. He found his wand and tried to clean himself a little.
"You're a big softie really," said Hermione, smiling, but Harry felt Draco bristle with indignation at the words, as if it were the worst insult that anyone could make. Which it probably was, to him. Harry stroked Draco's arm, then found his hand and squeezed his fingers. Draco seemed to relax slightly.
“I think you can sell these; they have a homely charm to them. Tomorrow you can go to market and see what you can get.”
The food on the plates was artfully presented, with fine tendrils of green balancing atop a paper-thin crisp circle, under which soft, perfectly-cooked cubes of sea bass sat. It all looked beautiful, with elegant swirls of a rich sauce travelling from the centre of the plate out. Beautiful, but such a tiny portion.
Harry is not worried, because he knows that Malfoy will have to give him the book, regardless of who picked it off the shelf first. With a mental finger up, Harry holds the parchment with Slughorn's signature scrawled across the bottom before Malfoy's eyes. His smile fades though as Malfoy doesn't frown but instead smirks – fucking smirks! – then holds up his own parchment, complete with the same purple flourish of ink as Harry's. Suddenly Slughorn's willingness to write Harry a note seems less a special favour, and more a ploy to get Harry to leave him alone.
“I felt it just now, we should have time to swap with Ron,” Harry said, and Hermione looked a little mollified.
“So young to have to live with so much death. How old were you, Harry, when you first saw Thestrals?”
"It feels to me," said Harry, "as if you're the one making the promise here." Draco turned his head towards Harry and ran his lips across Harry's chin before kissing him on the corner of his mouth.
“George,” she said. Harry suspected that she squeezed Ron’s hand at this point. “You’re right, he did. I hadn’t noticed.”
The routine of meals – ranging from traditional from Harry and Ron, through to inventive from Luna, experimental from Hermione and lumpy from Greg - continued, the days turned colder and they woke most mornings to frost patterns on the windows. Harry began to think that this was how his life would always be from now on: running a strange sort of hostel for owls and assorted former school-mates, and eating a bizarre combination of foods.
Harry hadn’t been made breakfast - by someone other than a house-elf - in a long, long time. He didn’t want to say this to Malfoy though, because how pathetic would that sound?
“I know.” Harry sighed. “But there are some good practices… It’s just the timing, really. There are so many files to go through, and doing it in a week at any time of the year would be hard, but knowing Christmas is coming…”
Something in Harry’s eyes softened for a fraction of a second, but hardened again as he stepped back and ushered Draco in. It wasn’t much, but it was Draco had to go on. One small spark of hope.
Draco took a deep breath, trying to ease the panic rising in his chest. Perhaps a job here wouldn’t be too bad. Draco could learn to chop and peel; he’d always been precise in Potions, and was confident in his skills with a knife. He watched a tall man talk sternly to some underling: surely such a man would recognise Draco’s inherent talent. Laid-back Henry might be blind to it, but this chef was obviously in command of his kitchen and would be glad to have someone like Draco working for him.
Draco continued to drink his tea. The face of his old teacher was unreadable, and Draco felt the fluttering high tension in his chest, the worry that somehow what he had learned wouldn’t be enough. He forced his shoulders down, thought of the warm softness of Harry’s skin, and tried to relax.
“Oh look, mother: isn’t that Madame Featherstone?” Draco grasped his mother’s elbow, and steered her away. “You must excuse us!” he called over his shoulder.
“Yes.” Draco’s eyes were clear, and added a silent please and thank you. “Start at the top left, then move across each row. Like you’re reading a book.”
“I’m trying very hard,” Draco said through clenched teeth, “not to jump up and run out of the door.”
“I’ve learned my lesson for next time.” Draco could almost feel his foot entering his mouth. “Not that there’d be a next time, “ he added quickly. “I’ll be more careful.”
Harry sighed. He knew he was being a bit of an arse himself, but he was tired and sitting through a lecture on rules wasn’t his idea of a gentle wake-up. He was still the interloper in this house, he knew enough to know that. “I suppose I have come into your home rather unexpectedly.”
When Harry stepped into the kitchen, he could see what Dudley meant. A dark, yellowish beige covered every available surface. The tiles on the walls had windmills on them, a tiny breakfast bar broke the narrow room in two, and haphazard shelves and cupboards seemed to spring up everywhere. Harry took an involuntary step backwards.
When Harry got home, Draco was not back yet. He went straight to the Pensieve. The thought of seeing the next memory, more than anything, had been what had kept Harry going through the day. He liked it, this feeling of being connected to Draco. Like a secret shared between only the two of them.
Harry knew that he’d probably annoyed her. Angered her, even. He sighed. This was why he rarely spoke about how he felt about Malfoy. It was complicated, and probably not that healthy, but how could everyone keep going on as if nothing had happened? “Sorry, but that’s how I feel,” he muttered.
“Next, you have to make sure the clay is centred, like this.” Henry moved the clay, nudging it until spun evenly at the centre of the turning wheel.
Heat and steam rose from the cup Malfoy handed Harry. The tea smelt like tea, but more fragrant somehow. Harry hugged his little bird-cup to him, turning his body so he was half-facing Malfoy. Once more Malfoy was curled in place, looking more relaxed than he normally did.
“Would you like to be mildly irritated under this umbrella, while we make our way to the stadium? The brolly’s big enough for both of us, and there’s a hidden Umbrella Charm so you should stay dry.” Potter gave a little half-bow, raindrops plopping down from the lowered side of the umbrella.
“I’ve got questions, about the Room. I’ve been thinking about it all week. About what you talked about, trying to fix it.”
“I don’t know. He… he wants to show me something. Wants me to see something. I don’t know what.” Harry said. “I’m scared about what it might be. What if it’s goodbye?”
“It’s all in the past now,” Harry said. He turned back to the list of potions. Did he carry resentment, the way Draco carried regret? Probably not: Harry seemed to be someone who lived in an endless moment. Draco leafed through a book on potions, not wanting to have to talk again quite yet. This Harry, the one who listened to technical details with interest, the one who spent his free time with his oldest friends and who shared out his smiles freely: this was the person Draco wanted to know. The visions, when they came now, were lacking.
The only compensating factor was that he and Henry had to stand side by side at the sink. Henry was warm, and his body solid. He smelt of sweat and wood smoke and although some part of Draco whispered, “Filthy,” to himself, the rest of him quite liked it. Henry was just so undeniably… a man. He was nothing like the primped and scented men and women of his parents’ acquaintance. In fact, he was far closer to the men Draco secretly day dreamed about: Quidditch players, all muscle and sweat and determination.
“Relax.” Pansy nodded in the direction of the knocking. “It’s just Hermione. You better let her in.”
"A spell to dampen feelings down?" Draco hadn’t heard of such a thing before. A part of him yearned for it though, was immediately drawn to the idea that he could simply wave his wand and make all the difficult feelings recede.
Pansy said nothing as ink splattered from Weasley’s quill, although Draco could see the tight edge to her smile as gripped her wand in her pocket. As soon as Weasley left she’d Vanish the ink splashes, as best she could.
Potter sipped at his tea. Without thinking, Draco picked up his own mug and took a sip. Hot tea slipped down, bringing with it a warm wave of comfort. His lip caught on the chip, and Draco scowled. “This mug is ridiculous.”
“Do you ever worry about the house falling into the tunnel below?” Ron asked as another rattle reminded them about the tube line below.
Potter’s hand disappeared as he began to laugh. "Oh look at you! You look as though I’ve mortally wounded you!"
He tried to nod at the right times, laugh at the right moments, but Harry was distracted all evening.
“In the entrance hall?” Draco asked. “No. They consider themselves far too important to talk to the likes of us. I think one of them told me off for sneezing too loudly when I was about five years’ old, but I’ve not heard a whisper from them since. We’ll have more luck with less… elevated ancestors.”
“Oh, I knew this wasn’t going to work,” said Draco, and he buried his head in his hands. “It’s too much, isn’t it?” The words were muffled, but Harry could still hear the frustration in them. Seeing Draco like this, seeing how much he had invested in this idea, gave rise to a wave of affection. Warm and yet gut-wrenching at the same time. Draco always did get overly caught up in his desire to make dramatic gestures.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. Vanishing Spells had worked for them, but only after some Muggle-style sweeping.
“Yes, well.” Henry flushed. “I’m sure you’re used to all sorts when you’re with your parents. I’m pretty certain,” he added, looking directly at Draco, “that you don’t know what it is to be hungry – truly hungry.”
It did look inviting, and Draco had climbed down expressly to get into the water. "OK," said Draco. "I’m keeping my underwear on though."
Potter leant forward, a twinkle in his eye and a sly smile on his face. Draco’s heart thumped alarmingly at the sight, and he pulled back. For some reason he had an urge to run away. He settled for a mild insult instead: “I do wish you’d refrain from that gurning when you’re around me.”
Draco sighed, and reached for his cup of tea. He stared into the flames for a moment, thinking about the last time he’d sat here looking into the fire.
“Draco got a bit annoyed about that,” Hermione said, nodding up at the ceiling. “He went for a walk to calm down. Or so he said. Personally I think he went to clean some of the dough out of his hair; he looked quite comical.”
“Yes, of course you can all stay, for as long as you want. This is your home, too,” Harry said. “It wouldn’t be the same without you.” And, looking around at all his friends, Harry knew it to be true.
“I know,” said Charlie. “Or rather, I can see that you’ve changed.” He turned back to the ballroom, where Ginny Weasley was wearing a big white dress and leaping up and down with a tall man in a kilt. “We all grow up in the end,” he added, with a wistful sigh.
A knock at the door disturbed Draco. Rather than being startled though, he looked up knowing it would be Potter. He wasn’t disappointed to see the usual scruffy hair and messy clothes. It appeared that Potter had managed to restock his egg supply since he’d last visited.
“Walburga doesn’t shout at you, and if you keep her hidden behind her curtain she probably won’t bother you too much.”
“I don’t think you are,” Robards said. “You’ve got dark circles under your eyes, you’ve lost weight, you’re always wearing an extra jumper, even in June, and half the time it’s like you’re not here anyway.”
“I’d be surprised if you didn’t want to.” Malfoy peered at the label. “You brought me something to drink that you think is horrible? I don’t need your pity,” he said, putting the bottle down and turning away.
No Malfoy would be humiliated in this way. He hadn’t seen any wizards, so these were only Muggles; what did it matter how he behaved? He wasn’t going home empty-handed. He came to stand at the front of the stall, leaning back against the table and smiling. A short woman was buying honey from Nicky, and she turned to him and smiled. Draco smiled back, and ran a hand through his hair. He winked, too, for good measure, and she giggled. Nicky said something in a low voice to the woman, and they both laughed.
“Why did you agree to sweeping today, then?” The question came out with more anger than he had intended, but the thought of Malfoy sneering filled him with an old, familiar anger. In that moment it felt as though they were standing miles apart, the distance between them unbridgeable.
“Of course,” said Ron. “But it’s your fault for making me watch all those films. And I don’t think that a Muggle cliché counts: as far as I’m concerned, it’s just a great idea.”
“I remember it being a beautiful house,” Andromeda said. “Full of scary things though. Are the elf-heads still there?”
"We've been getting reports of pockets of wild magic, all over the north of England," Ron said. "A farmer lost some sheep last week, and the Obliviators have been kept busy. We've set up some Muggle Repellant Charms, but the problems is that these pockets of magic spring up with no warning, last a few days, then destabilise and disappear."
“Of course.” And they had taken a great deal of work to earn, too. Draco had never envisaged actually doing anything with them, though, and when he imagined getting some job in London, or in a wizarding town, all the could see was that everyone would look at his arm for the Dark Mark, or expect him to act like a proper Malfoy. Whatever that meant. “I don’t want to work with wizards, though. I want to work with Muggles.”
Draco touched his nose to Harry’s dick. It smelled warm and musky, and he stuck his tongue out and gave it an experimental lick. Harry’s breath hitched, and Draco’s own cock gave a corresponding twitch. With a smile to himself, Draco decided to see what other noises he could elicit from Harry. He deployed every hard-won blow job skill at his disposal. Draco lapped at the tender ridges, and dipped his tongue in the beading tip; he took Harry deep in his mouth. He sucked and nipped and kissed and consumed Harry, until he wasn’t aware of the groans and moans Harry made, only of the tightening grasp on his hair and almost painful press of his own erection.
Draco looked again at the stick in his hand, and thought of the beams and planks of Harry’s cabin. "I can’t believe trees gave up that much of themselves."
As usual, falling into the memory was unnerving. Warm golden light filled the bedroom: a setting sun, casting long shadows across the room. The bright white lines of Draco’s body were clear, as were the fuzzier dark lines of Harry’s. They sat on the bed, fingers tracing each other’s bodies. Not the first time they had been naked together, but the first time they’d taken their time like this. Really looked at each other.
“Apparently he has to work with Potter. And something about Muggles and stealing, I wasn’t really paying attention.”
“Nonsense! It’s so much better to go with someone else. I’ll be happy to take you along, I go there all the time, anyway.”
. And even though the eighth year had been hellish, at least Draco had been not entirely alone. Draco considered the wide-open face, the earnest eyes, and Greg’s question.
Rather than reach for his arm, or grab his body, Malfoy neatly sidestepped then knocked Harry’s knees out from under him, sending Harry hurtling towards the ground. Instinctively, Harry’s hands came out to break his fall, and then the next thing he was aware of was Malfoy kneeling against his back, whilst pulling his hands up into the air in such an angle that his shoulders protested as his arms twisted. He couldn’t move his hands, or his arms, and his wand was still neatly holstered at his side.
Harry quickly translated everything the snake had said – except the sex on a stick comment, of course – and Malfoy nodded, then stepped back.
The soft look deepened on Madam Pince’s face. “We did,” she said simply. “We the staff and teachers, and the house-elves. For you. For you all.”
“I don’t think there’s any point coming back,” Neville said. “After Harry started talking about it last night I wanted to see what had happened to it. But now… now I half-wish I hadn’t.” He snaked his hand out to Luna, who wrapped an arm around his waist. Harry felt a familiar tug in his gut at the sight. However he tried to move on, he missed that; he missed how he used to hold Ginny close and feel, if only for a moment, that the world would be OK.
“Good morning. I think I could get used to married life if it means you bring me coffee in the morning.”
Sitting in his old chair at the back, listening to the sounds of Ollivander from the small kitchen, Draco began to feel uneasy. Did he really expect to walk back into his apprenticeship after leaving so abruptly?
“Oh,” said Harry. And then he decided to show Draco that he, too, was quite capable of making an effort. He slid down onto the floor. “I do believe it’s your birthday today.” He palmed Draco’s cock. “I’ve not done this before but I—“
Draco thought over Potter’s offer. Potter obviously didn’t want Draco around, but there wasn’t much choice.
Harry laughed, despite himself, and soon Malfoy was joining in. The two of them laughed in their grimy corner, the tension of the moment before turning to something else.
One evening, the room lit by lamps and the fire, most of the eighth years were scattered around the room after dinner. The eighth-year rooms didn’t feel like home the way the Gryffindor tower had, but there was a ‘yet’ lingering at the end of the thought that surprised Harry. What surprised him more was the way that some of the house divides did seem to be lessening, if not disappearing entirely.
“Well, she would know, wouldn’t she?” Draco moved his hand down to Harry’s chest, brushing over the circular scar from the locket. “But what intrigues me about you is the way you carry so many scars, inside and out. I don’t think you even realise that you do, though.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. At the same time, this wasn’t a conversation to walk away from. "Why are you telling me this?"
Ron shrugged. “It would be dead useful out in the field though. What I want to know is what’s the counter-spell?”
Judging by the heated length pressed up against his own crotch, Draco rather hoped that fucking would indeed be involved in the near future. After all, he really did need to get to know Harry better if he was going to remember his name properly. He anticipated it taking much repetition to get it right. Draco ground his hips quite shamelessly into Potter’s as though to emphasise the point, and was met by a small moan that almost made his knees give way.
"Oh, don't tie yourself up in knots! I know what you meant, and yes, I'm hungry too and Thai sounds fine."
Instead of answering, Harry opened the door to his room. Malfoy gave him what could only be described as a glare, but followed him in.
Harry shrugged. “I think he’s always wanted to do this, and now he’s got a bit more of a safe home he can do it.”
Draco’s shirt was off next. Harry turned and locked the Floo before casting his wand aside. “No interruptions, this time.”
Malfoy spent a long time checking the room over: apparently the 'bashing' had resulted in small leaks and spillages, with sections of half-cursed carpet and cabinet alike. Harry's room, even with the destroyed bed at its centre, took less time.
Up close, he can see that Potter's hair is damp with sweat. He reaches out and touches it. It feels... heavy, yet soft. It is thicker than his own. He strokes it, his touch light. Somehow, he doesn't want to wake Potter. He knows that this, the pain of the memories, is too private to be shared. So he just continues to run his hand through Potter's hair until the moans stop, until Potter has calmed. He looks at Potter for a moment, then makes his way back to his own bed, and climbs under the cold blanket. He leaves the lantern lit; this is no night for darkness. His hand is tingling, and he can still feel the damp hair, the warmth from Potter. He closes his eyes and listens for the rhythm of Potter's even breathing. It takes a while, but then he finds it, and his own breathing begins to fall into step with it. By the time he is asleep again, there is the hint of a smile on his lips.
“I was wondering…” Harry couldn’t do it. Not while Draco was looking at him as though he were something scraped off the bottom of his cauldron. “Er, would you go over the coming of age traditions with me again?”
Once they’d got into the room, an awkward silence descended. Malfoy ran a couple of the taps, and just as Harry had imagined, a fluffy mass of bubbles began to build.
Harry’s eyes widened, and his skin darkened. "If you are asking me, Draco Malfoy, if you can stick your dick up my arse, the answer is very much, yes."
“If I’ve got a stick up my bum, you’ve got an irrepressible desire to insult those around you,” Draco said, scowling. “Although
Malfoy came into the kitchen halfway through Harry making himself an omelette. Harry nodded at him, then continued what he was doing. Malfoy busied himself on the other side of the kitchen.
“We’ve got to be better,” Hermione said. “Better than Riddle. That’s why Harry beat him, wasn’t it? Because he wasn’t alone. Because he was loved. Maybe… maybe we need to not leave people to be totally alone.”
The first day back after his suspension was hellish. Harry had known it would be, but this time when he saw Malfoy, all he could think about was the way his face pinked up when he came, and the way the moon had painted him silver. Heat flooded his face, and he avoided looking again, instead examining the blank, beige wall opposite. They were both sitting outside Hestia’s office, waiting to find out exactly how they were going to be partnered up. He suspected she was making them wait on purpose.
“I—” Harry took a deep breath. “It’s good to see you,” he said, hoping the words would convey precisely how
He reached out, and traced the line it made. Harry shivered, closed his eyes, and hummed again. Encouraged, Draco continued. He felt the outline of Harry’s cock, felt the way it sprang back up towards him when he pushed down on it. He switched to using the flat of his hand, and then his cupped palm, to apply a more rhythmic stroke.
Standing next to Potter, listening to the rhythms of his heart and the whoosh of each breath, Draco tried as hard as he could to keep the hand holding the stethoscope still. He realised that this was the nearest they had been since the day of the Battle, and shut away the memory of the flames. Instead, half memories of dreams and visions swam in front of him.
“Cake… cake sounds like a good idea, actually. I know a good patisserie, not too far from here.” Draco felt a frisson of pleasure at the thought of a perfect macaroon, although Potter probably had a huge slab covered in chocolate in mind. Naturally, Draco’s next thought was to imagine Potter licking chocolate from his fingers, his tongue curling around and his lips pink. It was a most disconcerting mental image and for a second he forgot which way he was walking.
His fingers were cold as he pulled the window back down again. At least Mrs Snettisham hadn’t sent a Howler, but there was no mistaking the urgency of her note. The violin was missing, and somehow she held Draco responsible.
“Just a matter of waiting,” Luna said, nodding. “Easiest way to know how long it lasts.” Harry couldn’t understand how she could be so calm in the face of all this uncertainty.
that something had to change. “I know that you think that I’m probably a raving Pureblood behind this rather attractive exterior, but I have actually grown up a bit since school. Did you notice that Twinky wore clothes?”
Maybe…. Harry thought back to Luna’s advice about Draco needing wooing. He nodded over at the window. “Beautiful moon tonight, don’t you think?”
Malfoy sounded incredulous, and Harry realised that he had probably never seen a Muggle broom before. Harry felt his hackles rise. The thought of how different they were and every horrible thing Malfoy had ever said about Muggles in the past sat in him with a bloom of irritation, tinged with anger.
Once they had sat down, Potter cleared his throat. “So basically I want to ask about scar removal. Curse scars, that is.”
Draco caught sight of himself in a window’s reflection. His hair, fluffed up by a day in the wind, stuck straight up, and he was still wearing Luna’s goggles, pushed off his face. The whole effect was bizarre, and Draco stopped to stare. His skin had pink marks where the goggles were. He looked a fright.
The kiss they began then – a kiss filled with grunts and groans, a kiss both leisurely and more intense than any Draco remembered having before – lasted until Draco’s thighs began to shake and a great orgasm took him, pumping into Harry and ending the kiss with a cry. His body limp, somehow Draco pulled out and lowered himself down Harry’s body, to take Harry’s straining hot cock into his mouth and sucking hard, until he too was full of Harry’s come.
The blanket fell from Harry’s shoulders as he watched, his breath held almost painfully, as he kissed Draco’s cock, and licked it, and lapped at his balls before taking it into his mouth. Oh! He breathed again, in rhythm with the head bobbing in front of him. But then Draco made sound, a sighing groan that drew Harry’s attention.
"Yes, well, Hermione also says that I have commitment issues," said Harry. "She has lots of theories about me," he added.
Harry looked down at the box again. He couldn’t see what it being a Sunday, or December, had to do with a collection of memories. Wait. Twenty-four…. A memory of Dudley, eating the chocolates out of two calendars, while Harry watched from the hallway, rose in his mind.
A not-so-short time later, as Draco lay on his bed, panting, drenched in sweat, and quite unable to stand due the way his legs wouldn’t stop shaking, he could not help but agree. His visions had been nothing like reality. This was
Draco staggered slightly at the realisation that when he thought about ‘poverty’, that now included himself. He was poor.
“Really?” Harry remembered the chaotic mess of shelves. “Thank you, er…” He really was terrible with names.
that had one name: Harry. Nothing about this was simple, but in that moment, Draco didn’t care. He was at home, alone. His hand slid down and this time he didn’t pull back; he wouldn’t deny himself this release. Every action now was tied up with half-memories, with warm laughs and sun-dappled skin. His eyes still shut tight, Draco lost himself to the memory of arms tight around him, of a mouth hot and willing, of wrestling Harry to a bed while gently mocking him. It all felt so real, and as his strokes intensified, so did the tightness in his chest and his sense of loss. As he came, Draco felt empty: none of this was real. None of this had happened.
