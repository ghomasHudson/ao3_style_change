Huffing, Harry stubbornly crossed his arms over his chest, leaning further down in his chair to create a little more space between the two of them so he could think more clearly. He could already feel his cheeks heating up slightly.
”, Mother pleaded, reaching out to him.
And with that, the group of Eighth Years started to make their way through the castle. They walked for what felt like hours to Harry until they came to a stop in front of a portrait.
With an elegant eyebrow raised, Malfoy turned his head to Harry from where he had been staring at his empty piece of parchment. He glared at the now laughing boy, though a faint blush coloured his pale cheeks. "Tell me Potter," he said, "why would I do something so Hufflepuff-like as
", Gage growled lowly, his hot breath ghosting over Draco's face. He had grabbed the front of Draco's robes and had pulled him closer, completely oblivious to the still rising panic inside the now slightly shaking boy.
The blond sighed and laid back onto his bed.
wouldn’t fall off his head.
Groaning, Harry leaned back into his chair, running a tired hand through his unruly hair. He hadn't written anything new in over half an hour. The only thing that
It had come as quite the surprise when Neville had turned up at the try-outs, though he seemed determined to try for a place on the team as Chaser.
Turning around to the portrait he had just stepped through, Harry frowned.
Tw: mentions of blood
Shrugging, Harry answered, "Many things are bothering me."
"Don't you dare do anything stupid, Dray", Pansy warned, giving him a pointed look. "You know what the consequences are."
"Looks like our wardrobe takes after you", he mumbled, amusement clearly audible in his voice.
Spluttering indignantly, Salazar placed a hand over his heart. "You wound me, Helga dear", he said loudly. "I was one of the best players of our time, mind you."
And with that, the pale, blond head disappeared and Harry was left alone, standing on the small, dim landing.
Draco nodded.
Pansy lifted her head from where it had been resting on her boyfriend's shoulder. "You don't have to worry about us, darling", she smiled. "Have you talked about it with your mind healer yet?"
Draco had opened his eyes at the sound of Potter cursing and struggling at his desk. He watched with amusement clear on his face as the other boy tried to save his essay only to see it soaking up the ink completely. He couldn't stop the chuckle from escaping his lips when he saw the devastated look in Potter’s forest green eyes.
Though he hated how concerned she could be at times, he also couldn't help but be grateful for her perceptiveness. Without it they wouldn't have come as far as they had now. It had saved them multiple times over the years.
"Yes I am!" Harry suddenly shouted, causing a few birds - who had been sleeping peacefully up on the higher branches of the willow tree - to fly away. "Why can't anybody see that I don't need their bloody help? I can perfectly manage things on my own, thanks."
“I’m really sorry, Ted”, Draco said, a sad smile on his face as he carded his long, pale fingers through Teddy’s now messy, blond locks – a combination of both Harry’s and Draco’s hair.
"So you're leaving for France this summer?" Blaise asked, playing with Pansy's fingers, intertwined with his own. His dark eyes looked at Draco with understanding, yet the blond could see the doubt and worry in them too.
All hope of them joking was lost as Harry turned the corner and disappeared out of sight. He walked, farther and farther away, past the still empty portrait to the Eighth Year common room.
Who would have thought those two boys would actually be able to have a rather peaceful conversation?
Though that didn't stop her from at least making sure he had eaten something every day, or trying to engage him in conversation in the common room, much to the boy's chagrin at times.
And in an overcrowded common room nonetheless! Everybody could have seen!
Frowning, Harry took a step closer, before realising he probably shouldn’t. Though, the Siren didn’t seem to mind. “I don’t understand”, he said, “aren’t I supposed to be ‘sacrificed’?”
His chest tightened painfully. He couldn't breathe!
No, he would just stay awake for another night. Tomorrow he would get some sleep between classes or during breaks. Maybe he might actually take another Dreamless Sleep, despite his promise to himself.
Although sharing a room might have had something to do with it too. They had had more time to talk to each other than they normally would have and Hermione had to admit that having a female friend was a pleasant change for once.
Surely, this couldn’t be the moment Draco decided he had enough of their relationship…
Harry hummed, a tender smile lifting the corners of his lips. “As tender is the moon, so fierce is the sun.”
, Harry didn’t know.
”, Draco said, rolling his eyes. “You know, Edward Remus Lupin, your
Malfoy waved away the words. "Don't mention it", he said, taking a deep drag from the cigarette before looking back at Harry and the food on the plate. "Now eat", he said pointedly. A few lingering clouds of lingering smoke came out of his mouth and nose as he spoke, "I do not fancy force-feeding you like a baby."
Draco had come up with the idea, one day. They had been standing on their balcony back in London, quite the same way as Harry was doing now, with expensive glasses of wine in their hands and lit cigarettes between their fingers.
Also, reviews are much appreciated!
Nobody was saying anything and it made Harry slowly go mad. Weren't they happy to see him? Of course they weren't. He had abandoned them. Coming back was a mistake. He wasn't ready for this...
Sighing deeply, Harry ran a hand through his hair, causing a few strands to stick up in different directions. "I...", Harry began, "I'm fine."
A mixture of fearful and hateful eyes turned towards him, but Draco chose to ignore them. Instead opting for casually leaning against one of the doors of the compartments, crossing his arms over his chest, and an annoyed expression present on his sharp features.
The Siren chuckled, shaking their head. And something… something in Harry told him he could trust them. A strange feeling in his chest  told him he could trust the oddly charming creature in front of him.
Harry thought for a moment. He immediately thought of Ron and knew he would be a great captain if he really wanted to. He just needed a little push to boost his confidence and everything would be alright.
Right?
Sadness, so heavy it felt like he would suffocate, washed over Harry as he saw the true anguish and hopelessness in the depths of his mother's eyes at the thought of leaving her son so early; at orphaning their only son, their treasure.
Harry shrugged, pulling Draco closer so they were standing chest to chest. “You got what you wanted, right?”
Not wanting to risk having an upset Hermione Granger, Harry obediently ate all the food, thanking her kindly as he ate the last crumbs of the treacle tart on his plate.
"That's great, Draco!" Pansy exclaimed, clapping her hands together. "We're so happy for you! Aren't we, Blaise?"
Something Draco didn’t dare name yet.
"Merlin's beard, Potter!" Malfoy put a hand rather dramatically over his rapidly beating heart. "I thought you were already downstairs. I saw Weasley walk out the portrait when I came up here."
Harry couldn't prevent the fond smile from appearing on his face as he rolled his eyes. "Of course not, Gin", he said, motioning his hands at them to go away. "Go ahead."
Luna giggled as she glanced in Draco's direction. "I've seen the way you look at him, Harry", she smiled, ignoring Harry's protests again, "And I've seen the way he looks at you too."
His two best friends - Pansy and Blaise - were sitting in front of him, both of them listening to their fellow Slytherin Theodore Nott telling them about his summer. How his father had been put into Azkaban too and how he had decided to rent an apartment for himself somewhere at the edge of Wizarding London in the hopes of getting a fresh start.
“Lucius,
Pansy rolled her eyes, a smirk on her face. "You've heard me, Potter. I've noticed that every day, you're becoming more and more dramatic. Perhaps the Slytherin you're sharing a room with is rubbing off on you."
Perhaps he was scared; scared people would find out that Harry Potter wasn't mentally stable; scared they would look at him differently; scared his friends would see him as a different Harry and not the one they knew; scared his friends might actually start seeing him as a freak.
“Enough, Draco”, Father continued. His voice sounded drained, though his face was an impassive mask. “We are done discussing this. You will do what is expected of you. What is expected of every Malfoy. And that’s final.”
"Potter," Draco sneered, his sparkling grey eyes finally meeting Harry's emerald green ones, "if you could be so kind as to take your Fanclub elsewhere, that would be highly appreciated."
. Honestly, Potter I would’ve thought you-”
It had taken Harry 3 months to think it over, eventually deciding that, yes, moving to France wasn’t that bad of an idea.
Harry had coughed again

So he wasn’t really surprised when two men of the village came barging into the small cottage he had managed to build for himself not long after he turned of age. He wasn’t surprised when they hard-handedly took him outside, not leaving him any time to say goodbye to Flo, the old stray dog he had found a few weeks earlier.
Silence filled the room as they turned their attention back to their own activities. Or at least, that was what Harry was
at Malfoy's eyes.
Draco huffed, amusement visible in his silver eyes. "That as well", he smirked. "But it wasn't the only thing that made me smile. Because, sadly Potter, not everything revolves around you."
Even after the thunder had stilled and despite Draco’s attempts to reassure him and coax him from under the blankets again, Teddy refused, whimpering and sniffling softly.
Ron and Hermione had somehow disappeared between then and the moment Harry had started talking to Luna. How they had managed to do that without someone noticing, Harry didn't know. And where they had gone to or the reason
Harry laughed freely at that, throwing his head in his neck as they started walking back towards the castle. The others had already disappeared inside. They walked side by side, brooms in one hand and their other hand dangerously close to brushing against each other.

family. And although Teddy technically wasn’t his own child, Harry didn’t care. He cared for the little boy as if it were his own and he knew Draco did too. Maybe one day they might adopt a child of their own, but for now they were more than satisfied with having Teddy around most of the time.
She shook her head in disbelief, her eyes eventually landing on a very amused-looking Harry Potter.
It wasn't big, yet big enough for two people with two beds, two desks and one big wardrobe they probably would have to share. A fireplace divided the room in half and - just like the common room - the furniture had or the colour gold or silver.
he said,

Draco shrugged. "Not all of us are always as depressed as you are, darling." He winked at Harry before turning back around and walking further down the stairs.
Rolling his eyes, Draco's lips turned into a smile of his own. He locked gazes again with Harry for a moment and then winked at him before returning to something Pansy had said.
Raising an eyebrow, Draco gave him a curious look. “Oh?”
He walked towards where Harry and Hermione were sitting and sat down next to his girlfriend on the armrest of her chair. "I have some exciting news", he announced loud enough for the whole common room to hear. "I've just come back from talking to Headmistress McGonagall-"
Completely oblivious to the other boy's sour mood, Ron said, "Yes, of course, mate. But the after effects clearly aren't pleasant. So why do you even bother to keep taking them?"
“No! Lucius, please! You can’t just do something like this! He’s your son,
"There you are, Luna!", a voice exclaimed from the other side of the blonde.
to use it, if you really don't want to." She played with the almost empty teacup in her hands. "I just thought it might help you coping with everything. My mind healer has given me one too and - surprisingly - it
Surprisingly, the girl hadn't been as bad as she first thought her to be. After apologising for what she had done a few months prior, she and Hermione had gotten along pretty well.
People were fighting for their lives, yet all Harry could do was stand still and watch everything happen as if he were simply watching a film on the television like he had seen the Dursleys do many times before.
Harry stared intensely as the blond's tongue poked out his mouth, wetting those inviting-looking lips of his. His pupils were completely dilated, the black swallowing up almost every last bit of silver that was left as they stared into Harry's own eyes.
It hadn't happened since then, so seeing the portrait empty now... Something was definitely off.
Yes, he and Draco had grown closer over the last month. He could also no longer ignore the warm, fuzzy feeling that spread across his chest and the butterflies in his stomach whenever they talked or simply looked at each other - not to forget the
This scared him to no end. What if it happened all over again? What if he would have to start all the way back from the beginning? He had thought he was getting better. His healer had
She had left without waiting for a response, taking the empty plate back down with her.
Although Zabini was known for his rather sharp tongue, Harry didn't see the problem in having to share a room with the Italian. He hadn't really done anything bad to him in the seven years they had gone to Hogwarts together. "I don't think Zabini is

He never had been good at keeping promises anyway.
Confused, Harry tilted his head, milling the words over in his head. "So, you had known them a while before you actually realised?"
Harry was staring intently at the sentences he managed to scribble on the parchment in front of him. He couldn't help wondering why he was still doing this. Why was he still writing this bloody Potions essay?

They nodded and waved goodbye before walking to the portrait. "We'll see you at dinner mate!" Ron said over his shoulder before the portrait closed behind them.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
So, yes. Harry might have been slightly drunk. He had consumed multiple cups of the liquid already and he had to admit the world was starting to spin a lot faster than it probably should. He didn't care though.
It was still dark outside, heavy clouds hiding the stars from view. If he had to believe the huge clock on the wall Draco had brought with him a few weeks ago from Hogsmeade, saying it would be convenient if they could keep track of time when Harry had given him a weird look- Harry knew Draco actually loved the clock, though he would never admit it out loud - it was around four o'clock in the morning.
He wasn't going to get help.
hadn't started yet.
So when they had first formally met each other - three years ago at Malfoy Manor - she hadn't been that excited either. She had been rather rude and slightly disrespectful towards the Malfoys - to great disgust of her parents.
"No!"
“I also didn't know you could draw", he continued, popping a piece of the tart in his mouth. It was only then that he realised how hungry he actually was.
Luna and Ginny were both watching the exchange - or the lack thereof - between the trio with an amused twinkle in their eyes.
Just then, Hermione appeared at their side, throwing her arms around her boyfriend's neck and kissing him lovingly. Ron staggered a little at the extra weight thrown at him, but he recovered quickly and answered Hermione's kiss with as much passion, picking her up and twirling them around.
Everyone looked expectantly at Ron, whose cheeks slowly flushed a light pink at the sudden attention he got. "Uhm... I uhm... We could... I mean if it's...", Ron stammered, running his hands repeatedly through his flaming red hair. He groaned in frustration at his own inability to form a coherent sentence.
The sound of ragged breathing reached his ears, coming from the direction of the blob.
Draco's questioning gaze had returned, but yet again Harry shook his head, giving the blond a tentative smile. "I'm fine", he mouthed.
Guilt washed over him in agonisingly slow waves as the words echoed through the empty corridor.
And with his loneliness came other things too.
A determined expression crossing his face, Teddy nodded vigorously.
The silence in the compartment was slowly but surely becoming too much for Draco. He knew he shouldn't have told his friends yet. Still, they deserved to know. After all, they were probably the only real friends he had ever had.
Like every Saturday afternoon, almost every Eighth Year student had taken refuge in the circular room talking to friends, reading a book, studying for their upcoming N.E.W.T.s at the end of the school year or simply lazing around in one of the many armchairs or couches spread around the room.
Beaming at the boy next to her, Astoria gave him a quick peck on the cheek. "Very well actually. I'm glad you're okay though."
his presence in my own home!”
“You have to promise me one thing, though”, Harry whispered, his eyes closed as their foreheads rested together.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, making a satisfied noise in the back of his throat.
"Alright Eighth Years," McGonagall said as she came to stand at the head of their table, "your common room will be located in the additional Eighth Year tower, which I will show you in a second after we've made some clear agreements."
Draco waited patiently as Harry tried to get his breathing somewhat under control. When he spoke, his voice sounded hoarse, "Light, the ground, darkness, the moon and silver eyes."
Draco shook his head. "No, I was on my way to the Quidditch try-outs", he replied, only now realising he should be going if he didn't want to be late.
Harry shrugged, shaking his head. "I'm sure there were better captains than me. I mean we've had Wood and-"
With the faint sound of the shower running in the background, Harry felt himself easily drifting off in a light slumber.
bad."
They were standing close; close enough for him to feel their hot breaths on his pale face.
Taking a deep breath, Harry took another sip of his wine, swirling the liquid in his mouth before swallowing. It had been two years now. Two years of them living in that cosy apartment Draco had talked to about. And two years of Harry very slowly learning how to communicate with the locals. Though he would never be as fluent as Draco, his French had improved immensely. At least now, he could ask for the right bread at the bakery.
Harry chuckled. “You love my jokes, Minnie.”
The other Weasleys were hurled together, trying to find some sort of comfort in each other. Even Hermione stood between them, tightly clinging to Ron who had his strong arms safely wrapped around her trembling frame.
Taking a step closer to his fiancé, Harry felt a smirk of his own appearing on his face. “We don’t
The orange/golden outer robe flowed down his body, pooling at his feet in a sea of fabric that rippled softly with every movement. The colour of the robe went beautifully with his maroon shirt and even his olive skin looked a deeper brown now. The robe gave off an elegant, yet strong and powerful vibe. Like Harry was the king of the whole universe. And even though there was only a faint hue of the fireplace in the room, the yellow, orange and red gemstones on the golden tia-
“You do?”
Or you had to be one Ronald Billius Weasley.
A figure was approaching him. Harry could see them moving straight towards him through the blurry haze, though he couldn't tell who it was. In fact, his gaze wouldn't focus on anything for more than a few seconds. The edges of his vision were getting darker and darker.
Not to forget our fellow
, Harry thought with a smile playing around the end of his lips.
"I know," Draco said, a relieved smirk appearing on his face, "but I won't be
Nobody said anything, so Terry continued, "Very well then. Congrats, Ron! You're our new Quidditch captain."
Neville opened his mouth to ask what she meant by that, but was rather rudely interrupted by the yelling of some students on the opposite side of the common room.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "How would you know that I haven't eaten anything?"
"Alright!" Ron said loudly, getting the attention of the gathered Eighth Years. "I think it's time to announce who has made it on the team."
He wouldn’t last much longer and if the crescendo of Draco’s moans and cries was anything to go by, neither would he.
, the poor and miserable Chosen One?"
Normally, at the sound of so many people in there at once, Harry would turn around and head back up to his room. Now, on the other hand, he couldn't be bothered. After staring at a piece of parchment for several hours on end, he was happy he could finally do something else; even if that meant spending a few hours in the crowded common room talking to people and wishing it wouldn't drain as much of his energy as it did nowadays.
Why was this so confusing?
Or was there?
Harry huffed a laugh at the question. It was yet another variation of
“I have tried to change his mind.” Mother’s voice drifted into the darkened room. Draco could see her silhouette standing in the doorway behind him through the mirror on the mantelpiece. “He’ll come around eventually. But you know he’s a stubborn man.”
More cheers rang around the air as everyone started making their way back to the castle.
“Lucius…” Mother took a step forward, placing a delicate hand on Father’s arm. “Perhaps you shouldn’t make such ill-considered decisions right now.”
Weren’t they supposed to turn up now? Weren’t they supposed to come collect him? Why weren’t they coming to get him?
Malfoy held Harry’s gaze for a few more moments until he nodded his head in greeting, a small smile curling at the end of his lips before he turned back to the parchment in his lap.
"How dare you!" Salazar exclaimed, his eyes wide in horror. "And I was beginning to think you were on my side!"
The blond turned to look at Harry, his eyes twinkling softly and a fond smile appearing on his lips. He opened his mouth as if to say something, yet he didn't have the chance as their teammates chose that moment to show up and surround them, laughing and congratulating Harry on their win.
This was all his fault. He was responsible for this.
Harry walked down the last stair and started meandering his way through the packed room towards one of the empty armchairs near the fireplace; the one he almost always sat in.
Draco sighed as he fidgeted with the sleeve of his left arm, the place where the slowly fading - but still very prominent and vicious - Dark Mark had damaged his pale skin. He could still clearly envision the proud glimmer in his father's otherwise cold, grey eyes the day he had received the mark. He could still faintly feel the happiness that had made its way through the pain on his arm before passing out. The happiness of finally being able to please his father after years of trying... and failing.
Every now and again, his eyes would wander to the other boy sitting in one of the two windows of their room. He was bent over his own parchment, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration and his tongue poking slightly between his lips. Every once in a while, he would look up and take a drag from his cigarette before turning back to his sketch, his piece of charcoal gliding smoothly over the parchment.
To say people were starting to worry about what had happened to their Saviour - their friend - would be an understatement. Nobody had a clue about where Harry had gone off to and if he would ever even return. For all they knew, he could have already been dead.
“And what would that be, young human?”
He had been sitting in the same spot for the whole day instead of going to the library: underneath a large willow tree whose long branches were delicately touching the velvet-looking surface of the lake.
A quiet chuckle could be heard from the ground in front of the couch. "What's wrong?" Draco asked, catching Harry's gaze, challenging him. "Scared, Potter?"
"Come on", Harry sighed exasperatedly when he put his outstretched hand back on his broom.
It might take a little longer to upload next chapters, seeing as I have to still write them, but I seem to be lacking motivation and - more importantly - time (a big thank you to college for taking up all my time and energy ಠ_ಠ )
“You have changed too, Draco. People will know that soon enough.”
He had ruined it again. He had managed to ruin a perfect opportunity. He had managed to ruin whatever they had going on between them. He was sure Draco would easily go back to hating him, and Harry couldn't even be mad at him for that.
"F-Fine, I'll come with you then", Harry eventually managed to say, ignoring the slight trembling of his voice. He couldn't stand Draco's close proximity for much longer, not without making a complete fool out of himself, that is.
She walked away, leaving the boy alone as he kept staring at the lake. He took some pebbles again and resumed his throwing them into the water.
As Voldemort opened his mouth to speak the curse that ruined Harry's life, Lily's eyes met Harry's, their gazes locking for a moment. He stumbled backwards, his eyes wide as his mother gave an apologetic smile.
"I had met someone."
Leaning forward, Harry let their lips brush gently in a lazy kiss.
He reminded Draco a little of his younger self with the way he seemed to look down at Draco - although he was taller than the boy - and the way he lifted his chin in the air as if he owned the place. Younger Draco would have done exactly the same - if not a little more dramatic.
Ron huffed a laugh, though there was no humour in it. "Of course, you didn't", he laughed bitterly. "Just like you didn't mean to 'forget' to tell us Voldemort was supposed to kill you, hm? We thought you were bloody dead! We thought we had lost it all! After everything we'd been through!"
“No,” Draco said immediately even before Harry could open his mouth to voice his thoughts, “It is
"Hullo Tori", Draco greeted, giving the girl a quick peck on the cheek after which she greeted the rest of the group with a wide smile and a polite nod.
“please, take me away from here.”
All four heads of the people inside immediately turned his way.
Bloody fantastic!
“It’s an outer robe”, Draco explained when he saw the confusion still on Harry’s face. “I’m sure I don’t have to explain to you what it is, seeing as you have your own fair collection of them, Mister Head-Auror-To-Be.”
What if Draco would be his solution for those invisible Wrackspurts Luna always saw? What if Draco would be his solution to his nightmares, like Godric had told him about a few weeks earlier?
Still, they had sworn to each other to keep in touch and so they did. Draco couldn't have been more grateful for that.
A breath - Draco hadn't realised he had been holding - escaped his mouth. He honestly hadn't thought his friends would react as well, if not better than his mind healer. He had expected them to start yelling at him - mostly Pansy though - telling him that he was about to make a mistake; that things wouldn't be better in France than they are here.
He collapsed on the ground, sobs wrecking through his trembling body.
He could clearly see all the different emotions swimming in Draco's eyes; from a faint happiness to clear determination and understanding. Harry even thought he had seen another emotion flash in Draco's eyes, though it had passed by too quickly for him to figure out what exactly it had been.
Surely, he must have misheard Ron? Fred was his family too; so why wouldn't they want Harry to be around anymore?
Both Theo and Blaise - sitting on the couch next to Pansy - snickered quietly, exchanging knowing looks.
Harry held him close, his own release washing over him in pleasurable, slow waves. Every now and again he would whisper sweet nothings in Draco’s ear, his lips placing sloppy kisses on the side of the blond head as he rocked them gently from side to side, riding out their orgasm together.
Three years ago, Lucius Malfoy had announced that Draco and Astoria were to get married once she became of age.
Draco didn't deserve to be lied to, Harry knew that. Yet, he still wasn't completely sure...
Students had literally stopped doing what they were doing only to glare at him or to throw the most hurtful insults at him as he walked past.
The smooth voice broke through Harry's thoughts, filling the silence in the common room. "Or should I say night? Morning, perhaps?"
Mrs. Weasley let out a heart-breaking sob at that, her shoulders shaking violently as she stroked the ginger hair of her son.
As far as anyone knew, Ron didn't have a clue his little sister was in a relationship with Luna. Though how he hadn't noticed yet, Harry didn't know. If even he - one of the most oblivious creatures to ever walk this earth - had noticed; how had Ron not...?
"We didn't even know for certain if you were going to come back to Hogwarts this year", she said in a small voice, not much louder than a whisper. She stared at the ground, unable to look at him, her shoulders slumping slightly. It didn't take long for her quiet sniffs to fill the otherwise silent corridor.
"So tell us Draco," the Italian spoke, steering the conversation in a different direction, "how has your mother been?"
Harry blinked, tilting his head in confusion. He recognised that voice from somewhere, though he couldn't really place it. Had he even heard that voice in real life before?
Looking at all the students gathered in the room, the tiniest sliver of a smile spread across her lips, her eyes twinkling knowingly like only Albus Dumbledore's would. Harry wondered if it was something that came with being headmaster.
Again, Harry opened his mouth to speak, but one look at the redhead made him close it just as quickly.
"What?" Ron asked, his eyes wide in shock. "You can't be serious, mate! Back in sixth year you were the best captain Gryffindor had ever had!"
The cold evening air blew through Harry's dark hair. He stared at the smooth surface of the Black Lake, absentmindedly throwing pebbles into the water and disturbing the calmness ever so slightly.
"Healer Glover was rather supportive", he said to his friends now, the tiniest sliver of a smile twitching at the end of his lips.
"Hey, hey, it's alright", Draco said quickly, squeezing Harry's hands, his thumbs never stopping their movements. "Try to take deep breath first. There's no need to rush anything, okay? Take your time to reply."
Was it the way Draco's eyes would light up whenever he talked about something he was passionate about? Or perhaps the way one side of his lips lifted up more than the other whenever he smiled? Was it the way he rolled his eyes when Harry had said something particularly stupid again? Or maybe it were the annoyed yet fond huffs whenever Harry asked to borrow yet another quill?
The corridors were dark as he meandered his way through, much darker than normal. He could hardly see anything in front of him and he had already managed to trip over some invisible rock three times in less than one minute.
"Oh, so now everybody should go out of their way to make room for the Golden Trio?" the blond laughed bitterly.
to know, thank you very much.
Now both of them were free again to love - and perhaps eventually marry - the person they truly loved.
After all, it was Harry's fault.
It was one of his happiest memories from when he was little. Him and his parents were happily sitting under one of the blossoming apple trees in the orchard, laughing and listening to stories Lucius was telling - probably about some fool he had met at the Ministry.
He sat down in his armchair near the fireplace, lighting the fire with a lazy wave of his hand. With a heavy sigh, he slumped forwards, his elbows leaning on his thighs and his head falling into his hands, pushing his glasses up onto his forehead.
So, why was it empty now?
, were anything to go by.
A huff could be heard from next to his desk, the hand finally stopping its poking. "The Halloween feast is about to begin, you git", Draco said excitedly, his grey eyes sparkling happily. "And I'm fairly certain
A hand placed itself rather harshly on his shoulder, causing Harry to turn his head, his glassy, green eyes looking startled.
He could do this! He could confront them! He was ready!
Teddy’s eyes widened in horror whilst Harry tried his hardest to suppress his laughter. – a tell-a-vishion, really?
"Are you alright?" Ron asked as he saw his friend struggling to stay upright through the mirror. "You look awfully pale."
"Of course, dear boy", Helga smiled sweetly, waving her hand at him dismissively. "We will not hold you up any longer. Go have fun! And good luck!"
Sighing deeply, Draco took another forkful of mashed potatoes.
As Harry stopped in front of her, she put a gentle hand on his shoulder and squeezed. “I’m glad you chose to come willingly, Harry. It makes this whole situation easier for everyone.” She smiled, or at least she tried to. Harry could easily see the pain shimmering behind her spectacles.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Of course not, you tosser", he smirked. "I just wish I could have seen you lose again." A smirk of his own appeared on Harry's face. "We all know
"Try me", he challenged, a smirk playing around his lips.
Ron stood behind him; an intense, cold expression on his face as he stared down at his best friend. "We don't want you here, Harry", he said sharply.
They couldn't remember a time where they had laughed that much, seeing as with the looming return of the Dark Lord back then, their families had been quite uptight.
touches they exchanged whenever they were talking to the other. He wondered how long it would take them to realise their feelings for each other.
”, Harry mumbled when they parted.
"He'll be fine, 'Mione", Ron interrupted from opposite of her, his blue eyes looking sceptically at the four Slytherins next to them.
"I do
he had seen flashing through Draco's eyes when he had withdrawn.
"Well...", he started, scratching the back of his neck. "No, not particularly."
Go check out my
Why didn't it feel like it then? Why did it feel like his world was suddenly back to slowly falling apart?
"Thank you, Harry!", she exclaimed, leaning over Luna to peck him on the cheek before excitedly taking Luna's other hand too and helping the girl up.
He hated it. He absolutely hated the concern - and even the pity - he could see in not only hers, but in many other people's eyes. He was perfectly fine, goddammit!
A low, raspy laugh followed the pleas of the voice, sending shivers down Harry's spine. He knew that laugh. He had heard it multiple times before and he was certain he would never be able to forget the dreadful sound for the rest of his life.
Harry’s smile grew even wider (how his face hadn’t split into half, Draco didn’t know). He disappeared into the Manor through the backdoor, his footsteps fading away as he did so.
"Hey, I know you're tired, but you can't fall asleep here", Draco said, shaking his shoulder so Harry's head fell off it.
"I'm not so sure about that, Pansy", Hermione sighed, pushing her plate away from her, closing the book in her lap. Reading now wouldn't do her any good. She would only start to worry more. "Nobody has seen him. What if-"
Nothing happened.
Mumbling something under his breath - Harry bet it probably was something rude about Gryffindors - Malfoy walked to the bathroom and rummaged in one of his cupboards before emerging again with a small glass vial containing a soft, yellow liquid. "Here", he said, handing the vial to Harry, who gratefully took it, although confusion was visible in his eyes.
He wasn't crazy.
“Then it will be okay. Eventually. And I’ll be here through every small step. Together.”
“Yes, and you will be, young human. But I have not chosen to drown you.”
"Have you thought about what I've said a few days ago?" she asked after a while. "About going to speak to someone? A Mind-Healer perhaps? They might actually be able to help you."
"Alright then", Ron said, standing up and stretching his arms above his head. Harry flinched at the sound of one of his joints popping loudly next to his ear. "McGonagall said we're allowed to have two players of each house on the team. Something about more unity, I assume. So everyone who wants to try out, I will meet you next Saturday morning at ten o'clock sharp after breakfast on the Quidditch pitch."
Wary of a possible ambush or attack, he had opened the window with his wand firmly clutched in his hand.
Of course he was very grateful for the outcome of both his and his mother's trial. They could have ended up in Azkaban amongst his father and several other Death Eaters. Fortunately for them Harry Potter had chosen to speak in their favour on their trials, defending both Draco
From the moment he had set foot in the castle, memories of what had happened only a few months ago plagued his mind. Images of all the people who had given their life for him flashed before his eyes, causing Harry to be in a rather black mood.
Draco squeezed back, desperately clinging to her robes. “I’m so sorry.”
However, on evenings like this one, where he couldn't focus on his essay for more than one minute - and he swore he just saw his parchment double in length of what he
"Don't you dare act all innocent on us now!" Ron bellowed, his blue eyes narrowing dangerously. "We all know this is what you've planned all along!"
Draco nodded. “Yeah, yeah, I know.” He smiled softly when Harry’s thumb started stroking his cheekbone. “I just… I repeated this so many times in my head. I don’t want to mess this up.”
A few seats down the table, a certain blond was eyeing his own plate with disgust. He, too, didn't feel particularly hungry that evening.
"You've made me curious now."
“Wait”, Harry put up a hand to stop Draco from talking, his eyes as wide as saucers, “you were going to propose?”
Noticing his sister's distress, Charlie glared daggers at Harry, tightening his protective arm around Ginny.
The bright orange colour of the fabric glowed gold in the dim light of the room. But what was strange about it wasn’t the colour. No, what was strange was the fact that the fabric seemed to be emanating a sort of warmth, like the warmth of the sun on a hot, sunny spring day.
Harry rolled his eyes, turning around in Draco’s embrace. “You love going on midnight walks with me.” He wiggled his eyebrows as he leaned closer. “It’s romantic.”
Perhaps sharing a dorm with the Saviour of the Wizarding World wouldn't be as bad as he first thought it would be.
Noticing the sombre expression on the boy's face, Godric sighed sadly. "It wasn't just anybody, though", he continued, catching Harry's attention again. "They were very special to me - a pain in my arse, I should say, but still very special."
He could hear an annoyed huff followed by a grunt as the unconscious body of Oliver Gage was dragged away from him. Footsteps came closer and warm, gentle hands were placed on his shoulders.
Blaise's eyes followed the girl, narrowing them as he gazed over his friend's shoulder, glaring at something behind them.
But was she right though?
wasn't in the mood for someone to start telling him what to do and what not to do.
Flinging an arm over his eyes, Harry laid back down, mumbling, "I'm not going to classes today."
"What the bloody hell is going on here?" His voice echoed through the small corridor, making the crowd fall silent.
actually - I should make sure you actually eat it."
Luna shrugged. "We were having a nice conversation", she admitted.
"Already, mate?" Ron asked, pausing in the middle of his argument. "It's only a quarter past nine."
"Please consider using that journal, Harry", she said. "I know you think it won't help, but you never know." Her eyes darted around the entrance hall of 12 Grimmauld Place, a sad smile appearing on her lips. "It also might be the solution to finally get rid of all the Wrackspurts around here."
Ron positively beamed at his best friend, the grin on his face widening even more; Harry was sure his face would split in half at any second now. "Thanks, mate!", the ginger smiled, a faint blush coating his cheeks.
into their shared bathroom. "Always glad to help."
, Draco thought,
He stood up, untangling himself - much to the other boy's protest - and holding out his hands for Harry to take. Harry looked at them warily for a moment, an unreadable look in his bottle green eyes, but took them either way, letting himself be pulled up by the blond.
Nodding his head, Malfoy stared at the flames roaring in the fireplace.
Shaking his head, Harry opened his mouth to protest but Draco put a finger against his lips, silencing him.
"Three things you can hear."
Also, let me know what you thought of the chapter!! :)
Gratefully munching on the food, Harry had promised Hermione to be more on time for classes - much the same as Ron had done a few days prior. Still, the three friends knew Harry wouldn't be able to keep that promise. He had tried many times throughout the years, yet he never seemed to succeed.
"Harry! Mate! You will
At the confused look appearing on Harry's face, Malfoy spoke, "It's for you."
Later, when they were lying on his bed and Harry’s fingers were carding through his blond hair, Draco couldn’t help the lazy smile that curled around his lips.
"Granger gave it to me", Malfoy continued when Harry shot him a questioning look. He sat down on the sill of the now open window, one of his legs dangling over the ledge. His sketchbook was perched against his other leg, a freshly lit cigarette placed between the fingers of his right hand. "She told me you skipped dinner today, as well as breakfast, and she asked me to give you that plate." He motioned his head towards the still full plate. "She also said - well, more like
Harry sighed, running a hand through his messy hair. "I wish it were that easy, Gin."
Draco had closed his eyes, mentally bracing himself for the familiar pain to hit him somewhere in the face or the stomach. They always aim for the face or the stomach.
If Hermione saw him like that, she would definitely kill him, but not only for being late. Ron had lost count of all the times she had scolded him for turning up to classes looking like he had just rolled out of bed - which most of the times he had. Though, he couldn't help but love her even more for it. He knew she cared about him, even if it didn't always seem that way.
Luckily Hermione - the good friend she is - had filled him in on what he had missed, which also included giving him a croissant from breakfast.
A blush had spread across Luna's cheeks as Harry had been watching her clothes intently. "You're staring again, Harry", she muttered softly, nudging him in the side with her elbow.
himself didn't know yet.
They were dying because of him...
She rolled her eyes, smiling brightly. "You seem to be having fun", she commented when she saw the laughter still dancing in Harry's eyes.
The moment the words left his mouth, however, he wanted to take them back. It sounded stupid;
"C'mon mate", Ron sighed as he walked towards Harry's bed, pulling away the covers. "You know Hermione will kill us both if we're late again."
Harry had heard stories before, about the creatures’ beauty and the dangers they could inflict with their Song. Many people in the village even claimed to have seen one.
She wasn't stupid though. Even though she knew something was amiss, she hadn't tried again after that. If she had, she was sure it would have ruined their already fragile friendship.
"Yes," Malfoy nodded again, "she's doing well considering the circumstances. She can't wait for me to join her at our small manor at the French countryside once I finish school, though."
Draco raised his eyebrow in question.
– honestly how Draco’s eyes hadn’t gotten lost in his head, Harry didn’t know – Draco muttered something about his idiot boyfriend under his breath before saying, “To go treat-or-tricking of course! Honestly, did you really think you would still be wearing those damn irresistible, leather trousers if I hadn’t planned to do something else tonight?”
Trying to give his friends a reassuring smile, Harry shook his head. "Go on ahead", he said, "I'll join you in a few."
Compared to the other tables though, the Eighth Year table was relatively more quiet. Of course, you would hear someone laugh occasionally about something that had been said, but it wasn't the same as it used to be.
Sighing loudly, Harry slowly emerged from the safety of his bed, steadying himself against it when another wave of pain washed agonisingly slowly over him. Even the tiniest movements of his head made it feel like it would explode.
He slumped further against the wall, taking another drag from the cigarette and closing his eyes as he blew out the smoke, his head leaning against the wall behind him. He stayed like that for a few moments, just sitting there with his eyes closed, breathing in the late evening air.
“Teddy?” Harry tilted his head in confusion.
He really needed to stop doing that!
At some occasions, his mother would sit with him, her bright robes blending beautifully with all the different types of flowers around them. They would talk about things that had happened at the Manor or they would sit in peaceful silence, relishing in the beauty and the warmth of the earth.
Also, as always, let me know what you thought of the chapter!! :)
him knowing - to articles about what he ate on a daily basis and lists of his favourite foods - foods he sometimes didn't even know existed.
Harry pricked up his ears, trying to catch any other sound, but to no avail. Everything was quiet again; the only things audible were his own breathing and hammering heartbeat.
"Go on without me, Ron", Harry interrupted, squinting at the buttons on his shirt. His vision kept blurring every few seconds. "I'll be fine. I don't want you to be late because of me again." He nodded towards the door, urging Ron on.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hmm", Luna hummed thoughtfully, "I also might have overheard Helga and Rowena gossiping to each other about the two of you," she giggled fondly, "but I do believe I have to agree with them."
"Please guys," Harry said, catching the attention of his two best friends, "not tonight, alright? I know we're all tired, but please just let it be for now."
But that wouldn't happen. Not after everything Harry had ruined.
Harry watched quietly as Draco took Harry's other hand in his own and leaned closer, his grey eyes boring into Harry's. "Why?", he asked softly, his thumb absentmindedly caressing the back of Harry's hand, "Why do you keep lying to everyone? To yourself?"
"What do you want, Gage." His voice sounded surprisingly flat, devoid of any emotion. He knew better than to let them see what was going on inside his head. It would only work in their favour.
"Avada Kedavra!"
So, Draco took matters into his own hands and replied for the both of them. “We love you too, Teddy.”
In fact, no one had seen or heard from him since that morning and - to be completely honest - Hermione was starting to get quite worried by the time dinner came around.
Malfoy had asked.
The only times Harry had managed to forget about the bad things in his life, were the times he was up in the air and the times he got to speak with Draco.
If only Draco knew what he did to him. Harry was absolutely going crazy - and in dire need of yet another cold shower. He wanted to claim those lips - damn, that whole gorgeous body - so badly.
“A crown?”
Since both Ron and Hermione had been chosen as Head Boy and Girl by the Headmistress, they had barely had time to really talk anymore. The two of them were always too busy with their duties: making sure no students were out of bed after curfew or helping a teacher after class with cleaning the classrooms or even tutoring younger years if they had questions about certain subjects.
, she had said, a sweet and innocent smile plastered on her face.
Slowly, Teddy nodded, lifting his head from Harry’s chest to look at the overly happy blond.
Harry choked on his own saliva, spluttering and coughing his lungs out as he sat upright, Hermione patting him on the back with an amused smile tugging at her lips.
“What are you looking for?” Harry asked. He had taken a few steps backwards to give Draco some space whilst he searched for whatever it was he was looking for.
However, she hadn't missed the ways his eyes turned into hard emeralds. Or the way he had clenched his jaw, his features hardening as he built up strong walls around him to prevent anyone from getting through or from knowing the truth about what was
By now, Harry's breathing had considerably calmed down, yet Draco could still feel the slight shaking of the hands he held in his own, the panic still brewing in those wide, emerald eyes.
"I know", Harry said, an apologetic smile grazing his lips, although Luna couldn't see his face. He really appreciated the thought behind the gift, yet he didn't see himself doing it. It felt ridiculous.
“But it’s true!”, said the lump loudly, a small tuft of bright purple hair peeking from underneath the covers. “They’re coming to get me! They’re going to take me away from you!”
, he made his way over the trembling boy on the ground.
"Oh, do shut up, Seamus", Harry laughed softly, sending a half-hearted glare in the other boy's direction. A few chuckles could be heard around the room.
“A lot will have changed.”
that had been exchanged on multiple occasions.
At the mention of the girl, Luna's face had completely lit up, every trace of sorrow or sadness gone as if it had never been there in the first place.
he had complained, one day, after he had repeated the phrase for the tenth time,
So, who was it then?
The mayor sighed and squeezed his shoulder again. “You and I both know I wish things could have been different.”
to each other like adults to solve their problems instead of screaming bloody murder at each other. Since the two ladies had some business to attend to somewhere else in the castle, Godric and Salazar were supposed to guard the entrance together that night. Yet the two men had ended up fighting once again, both of them leaving the portrait to cool down somewhere else.
Rowena sighed, an exasperated look in her blue eyes. "Yes, I'm afraid so", she said. "But you know how Godric and Salazar are. They kept bickering until I sent them away because poor Helga couldn't take it anymore. She's got a migraine from all their arguing, so I told her to lie down for a while."
Yet despite that, the potion
Next to her, Mr Weasely sat, his hand rubbing soothing circles on her back as he whispered sweet nothings in her ear.
It was storming outside. The wind was howling, the rain was pouring and every now and again a flash of lightning closely followed by the roaring sound of thunder would join in, causing the whole ground to tremble violently.
Draco turned his head to look at his friends. "Don't worry, Pans", he smiled. "I'll just go and see what the fuss is all about." And with those words he opened the door of their compartment and stepped onto the corridor, only to be greeted by a swarm of bodies pressed against his own.
Harry poked at the little food left on his plate. He didn't really feel like eating anymore, not that he'd eaten much of the food anyway.
It was a simple agreement between
Various kinds of
Harry shook his head, trying to clear his mind - without much success.
Groaning, Harry buried his head deeper into his pillow, immediately regretting it. He felt horrible. His whole body ached and his head felt like someone was continuously pounding on it from the inside out.
However, he came to an abrupt stop as he turned the last corner, the vast doors to the outside just out of reach.
"So you weren't laughing at my misfortune?"
One of them being the person he was lying half on top of. He hadn’t ever imagined to be happy again, not to this extent anyways.
“Don’t call me that”, Draco said, rolling his eyes, though Harry could see a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “I can’t believe this actually didn’t go the way I intended.”
Normally, you’re the one to lose things or screw everything up
She had talked to Blaise and Pansy about what had happened and together they had helped him through the worst parts of it all, until he was able to go to an actual mind healer.
Of course, Draco had calmed him down, reassuring him that it didn’t matter anyways; that one day, they would find their own home and be happy.
As if reading Draco’s thoughts, Harry mumbled, his voice thick with sleep, “
With a lazy wave of his hand, Harry cast a few Cleaning Charms over them, vanishing the sticky mess in their trousers.
Yet, it seemed like Draco
The sudden sound of small footsteps running down the stairs, shortly followed by excited giggles, was the only warning they got before a seven-year-old-Teddy Lupin came crashing into them, his star-shaped costume twinkling in the soft lighting.
... It had all felt so damn real!
At the sound of Harry coming down the stairs, Draco turned away from the window. A soft smile appeared on his face when he saw the confusion written all over his fiancé’s face. “Don’t worry, darling”, he chuckled, coming to stand in front of Harry, “the costume’s not complete yet.”
Harry laughed, throwing his head in his neck as he followed the blonde to the hall, his shoulders shaking with mirth. "I'll show you out", he offered, already reaching to open the door.
Draco wasn't really paying much attention to the boy next to him, though. Instead, he chose to observe his two best friends and the way they would look at each other with one of those lovesick smiles etched onto their faces.
Draco walked to the couch and retrieved a fancy-looking box from underneath. With a dull
“No!”, Teddy exclaimed quickly, climbing clumsily off Harry’s lap. “I’m not scared of them anymore!” He ran the short distance towards Draco and threw his arms around the blond’s waist, his chin resting against Draco’s stomach as he looked up innocently.
He seemed to decide the latter as he raised his wand with a steady hand, aiming it directly at her chest.
Harry turned around to look at the girl, his head tilted in question. "What's wrong?" he asked, concern clouding his features.
"Draco...", Pansy warned, placing a well-manicured hand on his shoulder.
Harry had choked, Draco actually having to pat him on the back as he was gasping for air.
Maybe Slughorn won't lose hope just yet...
Both boys chuckled at that; the warmth in Harry's chest increasing.
With a huff, Draco stepped into the already green flames, Teddy holding firmly onto his hand. “We’ll see you in a bit then”, he said, winking before crying out
He couldn't defend himself without it backfiring at him. Who would believe him if he said
"I didn't know you smoked", Harry said only to fill the rather uncomfortable silence that hung between the two boys. He took the piece of treacle tart Hermione had given him out of his pocket and unwrapped it.
backed down from an opportunity to beat Harry at something - especially something as simple as Quidditch.
"Mhm", Hermione hummed, raising an eyebrow. "I'm sure you're not." She went back to her book, ignoring Harry's spluttering of protest.
To say Harry was confused about this whole conversation, was an understatement.
Harry watched helplessly as the figure stopped in front of him, reaching out to him. Willing his body to move, he flinched away from the touch, a soft whimper escaping his lips. He thought he could faintly hear the figure say something to him, though the words were lost in the ringing in his ears and the never-ending cries of the people running around.
Go check out my
Not realising he was doing it, Draco leaned into the touch, closing his eyes and a content smile appearing on his lips. "Next week", he mumbled, feeling the exhaustion slowly washing over him. He could sleep for what felt like eternity.
That fear, however, disappeared as the brunette gave her friend a small smile before returning to her food, an old-looking book balancing in her lap. Harry squinted at the title on the cover:
A heavy silence had fallen between them as they were both waiting for the other to do or say something. Eventually, Draco decided to break the silence.
Hermione sighed, poking the last piece of potato on her plate.
The word echoed around the silent room, bouncing off the walls, mocking him.
So of course, he had expected the fiery redhead to be angry at him. He would have been surprised if she wasn't. He had just completely left without so much as a sign of life for
Stopping their conversation to listen to what Pansy was saying, Blaise and Theo nodded. "She's right, Dray", Blaise said. "You know what happened last time."
Harry could practically feel the anger and disgust radiating from the ginger as he tightened his grip on Harry's shoulder, forcing him to stand up from his crouched position on the ground.
Draco shook his head, a teasing smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Nope, we don’t have time, love”, he said. “Now, go to the bathroom and change!”
He hadn't thought of bringing his Invisibility Cloak with him, so he couldn't risk using
“The sun and the moon?” Harry asked, the puzzle pieces finally falling into the right places. Now that he looked back at it, it really did make sense.
"Oh Harry!" she exclaimed, squeezing him tightly as if to prevent him from leaving them again. Her shoulders shook slightly as quiet sobs escaped her mouth. "You're back."
Draco didn’t respond. Instead he leant closer until their foreheads were resting together, Harry’s eyes only a green blur in front of him.
"Okay, well. Maybe you would like some treacle tart?" she asked, already trying to get the attention of Dean who seemed too busy with staring at the Irishman next to him to notice Hermione's attempts for him to pass her the treacle tart.
Harry started out of his thoughts, spluttering in protest at the girl's words. "I... I don't... I don't know what you're talking about."
, Draco thought,
Perhaps something had happened between them?
Astoria wasn't like most of the other pureblood girls. She - unlike her parents and sister - didn't believe in the pureblood supremacy and traditions.
Harry turned back, a frown crossing his face. “Draco…?”
Harry laid a hand on the trembling lump of blankets as Draco took his other one, their fingers automatically intertwining. “Nobody’s going to take you away from us, Pup.”
Smiling politely at all his teammates, Harry tried to ignore the slight tightening of his chest again at the loud cheers of everyone around him. He was thankful for the reassuring weight of Draco's hand in his own as he talked to the Hufflepuff Seeker, making sure they were okay after the Bludger had hit them.
Harry absolutely loved it when Draco was being loud. Ever since they had moved to the cottage, they hadn’t had to use any Silencing Charms again – unless you counted the permanent Silencing Charm on Teddy’s and their bedroom, of course. They could be as loud as they wanted, screaming their pleasure to all who could hear. They didn’t care. And Harry absolutely loved every moment of it.
Harry sputtered indignantly. “Pfft, I wasn’t going to say that.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry unconsciously walked a little closer to the other boy. "Don't worry", he smiled. "You'll see me play more than enough this year."
He walked to one of the golden armchairs in front of the fireplace, sinking down into the soft cushions. The colours were very different from the ones in the Gryffindor common room, but - weirdly enough - Harry didn't really mind. He had thought he would miss the warm scarlet and gold more.
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. “You’re an absolute sap, Potter.”
Her usually warm, brown eyes were cold and lifeless as their gazes met briefly before she looked away again as if she were ashamed to even think of him.
Do normal friends place a finger under the other's chin to bring their faces even closer? Close enough for their lips to almost touch...
They had completely circled him now. There was no escape.
At that moment, surrounded by his friends' laughter and support, Harry felt loved and safe, his lips easily curling into a smile on their own. It was a nice change from the way he had been feeling over the past months, so he was savouring every moment of it while it lasted, tightening his grip ever so slightly on Hermione's tender frame.
Draco didn't believe him.
Ron shook his head quickly as he thought back to the last time he had been late. He hadn't realised how sick Hermione actually was of both her best friends being late
So he had sent the letter (together with a few others). And the response he had gotten had been more than he had expected. It hadn’t been a simple ‘okay’, neither had it been a ‘thanks’ or dead silence.
“Don’t worry, Draco”, Harry said softly, his thumb drawing invisible patterns on the back of Draco’s hand. “You know I would never force you to leave here if you don’t want to, even though my flat isn’t the best.”
any slower, Potter?"
Loud screams were coming from all-around him as he looked around. The Quidditch pitch had changed. The ground was littered with large pieces of stone, which looked suspiciously like pieces of the castle walls. People were running around, screaming their lungs out as they jumped over what Harry thought to be bodies lying on the ground, unmoving, their eyes staring unseeingly at the darkening sky above.
friends.
"Ronald! Is it really necessary to keep on swearing like that?" Hermione chimed in, coming up the stairs of the girls' dormitories and sitting down next to her boyfriend with the same book about House Elves from earlier in her lap. "I can hear you screaming from all the way down the stairs to the girls' dormitories."
Sometime along the night, Harry had ended up in the common room.
Why couldn't they just leave him be for once? Who even cared about what type of aftershave he used in the morning? Or what brand of toothpaste he had? Or - even worse - if he slept
And most of all, he
Sighing exasperatedly, Harry fell down in the armchair, swinging his legs over the back.
Or his chance at a normal childhood. His chance at receiving Christmas presents he
wouldn't be able to safe it anymore; his essay was ruined. He would have to start all over again.
The group of Slytherins took another few steps towards Draco. One of them - Draco couldn't remember his name - grabbed a hold of his broomstick. Yanking hard at the wood, he snatched it out of Draco's grip, throwing it away a little further down the corridor.
Sighing for what felt like the hundredth time, Harry shrugged hopelessly. "I think 'troubled' is putting it lightly", he smiled sadly. "Couldn't sleep again."
"Oh come on, Malfoy!" Potter whined, taking yet another step closer.
Draco wondered if their Saviour would return to Hogwarts this year. And if so, he hoped he would have the chance to thank the boy and apologise to him - as well as many others - for the way he had acted throughout their time at school. If he truly wanted to start over he should at least start with the people to whom he owed an apology, although he knew a simple apology couldn't really take back the things he had done to them.
"Potter, I..."
For a moment, he seemed to get lost in them. Although on multiple occasions over the years the boys had been standing even closer than they were right now, Harry had never taken the opportunity to really
However, he didn’t put up a fight. It would be a futile attempt, anyways. He couldn’t escape what was about to happen. He had been chosen for a reason. He was the village’s only hope of survival.
"You look like shit, Potter", he commented, rolling his eyes as the only response he got was a muffled grunt.
For about three minutes he managed to concentrate on his essay, scribbling down a few sentences that probably didn't have anything to do with the potion he was writing about. He didn't bother rereading what he had written down, however. His thoughts were too distracted.
"You've taken another Dreamless Sleep, haven't you?" Ron asked after a while of silence, coming to stand in the door frame of the bathroom, leaning against it as he crossed his arms over his chest.
“You don’t know that!”
He turned towards the other two Chasers, nodding his head at them. They both mounted their brooms, pushing of the ground and flying into position in the air. The two Beaters followed quickly, their bats held firmly in their hands.
He moved to sit up, the sudden movement causing the Slytherin - who had been looking in the mirror at something on his face - to shriek and turn around, his wand pointing shakily in Harry's direction.
Now that he actually thought about it, he wouldn't mind to share a room with someone else than Ron. Maybe it would be a nice change for once.
"I...", Harry began again, though he stopped when the words caught in his throat. He didn't have an answer to that question.
"You played well today", he said, eyeing the blond from the corner of his eyes.
The words sliced through his heart like a knife through butter.
“I’ve been thinking about this for a while”, Draco began. He wasn’t looking at Harry now. “I
His cheeks flushing pink, Theo turned back to his staring contest with the flames in the fireplace, ignoring the snickers around the room.
The sound of his name sent more blood rushing down to his already very prominent erection and he quickened his pace, seeking as much delicious friction as possible and groaning lowly. He could already feel the tension in his stomach building up, waiting for the inevitable release.
He wouldn't.
The only thing he
So yeah, have a nice day or night or whatever time it is when you read this and I will hopefully post the next chapter earlier than 5 months ;)
Draco snorted loudly, rolling his eyes playfully. “You don’t say”, he muttered before taking another sip of his coffee, a satisfied smile dancing around his lips.
Draco didn't really look convinced, though he nodded and returned his attention to what was happening around them. His lips curved in a content smile as Pansy resumed her massaging of his scalp. He leaned more into her touch, his eyes closing momentarily.
Malfoy answered his smile with one of his own, although slightly hesitant. "I also wanted to say thank you", he continued. "You know, for saving us in the Room of Requirement and for you defending Mother and I at our trial."
How could he be so stupid? Once again, he had caused people nothing but pain and it was all his own bloody fault.
Rubbing his eyes, he stared at his - still mostly empty - parchment, willing the essay to write itself. Maybe if he stared long enough he might also see double the amount he had already written.
Harry's eyes widened as he shook his head violently. "I think you're getting the wrong ideas", he said. "I don't know what you're talking about."
"You've done well, Malfoy", Ron said as everyone had landed safely onto the ground. "The position is yours."
He cursed under his breath at the sight of their messy wardrobe. All their clothes - mostly Harry's though, Draco would
“Yes”, she whispered resignedly, “I do.”
Harry held up one of his hands, preventing Draco from saying anything further. “I know who Teddy is, you git”, he said, exasperated. “But why would he be waiting for us?”
It had felt like he was trapped inside his own mind, not being able to gain control. Not enough, at least, to focus on controlling his breathing. He had been stuck in a spiral of the same thoughts, repeating over and over, holding him in their claws and preventing him from escaping. If it hadn't been for Astoria breaking through, he was certain he would have still been sitting there: a curled up and whimpering mess.
His mother's sentence would last at least seven years. Enough time for Draco to - hopefully - build a life for himself and still be close to his mother.
At that Hermione made a sound of approval, her eyes sparkling with excitement. She could put her knowledge to good use again for yet another year.
listened to his instincts for once. Gasping, he stumbled backwards, dropping his wand as he did so. The thin wood clattered loudly onto the ground.
"Please," Weasley gagged, a disgusted expression on his freckled face, "get a room if you're going to start snogging at the table. I would like to keep my appetite, thank you very much." He glared at the two Slytherins.
How Harry had survived seven years in Hogwarts, Draco didn’t know.
suddenly becoming aware how close Potter was actually standing. He didn't like people standing so close to him. Not after...
“Okay, okay.” Taking a deep breath, Draco met Harry’s gaze. “There’s something about the way you make me feel”, he took another deep breath.
The second thing he noticed was the voice screaming the lyrics to the song. Always slightly off-key.
Why was this happening again?!
Grumbling under his breath, Harry had complied, although reluctantly – though Draco didn’t need to know that; he still valued his life, thank you very much.
The other Weasleys were all hurled together, finding comfort in each other's presence. Even Hermione stood between them, tightly clinging to Ron who had his strong arms safely wrapped around her trembling frame. His face was buried into his girlfriend's bushy hair, but Harry knew his best friend was crying - if the shaking of his shoulders was anything to go by.
“Come here, Pup”, Harry eventually said, motioning to his lap and settling further on the bed so his back was leaning against the wall. Teddy crawled onto Harry’s lap whilst Draco nuzzled himself safely against Harry’s side, his head resting on his shoulder and their hands still entwined.
It had infuriated Harry more than it probably should have. Hadn’t people learnt anything from the war?! Hadn’t they all suffered enough?!
"Just go, Harry", Hermione suddenly said, coming to stand next to her boyfriend. "You're only making it harder for all of us."
"Alright everybody!", Seamus exclaimed loudly from where he was standing next to Dean, a wicked grin appearing on his face. "It's time to celebrate!"
None of the Four Founders was present... again. The portrait was completely empty, even though a few weeks ago McGonagall had made sure there would
Draco squeezed Harry's hand comfortingly while he was talking to Blaise and Pansy. The gesture immediately calmed Harry back down.
"What did those poor pebbles do to be treated so harshly? Have they offended you or something?"
He missed going out in the field. Not that there wasn’t any work for him besides paperwork – on the contrary – but as Deputy Head Auror the only thing Harry had been doing for
Shrugging, Luna sat up, glancing at the enormous clock on one of the walls. "Oh!" she exclaimed, quickly standing up and placing her empty cup of tea on the side table as if it had suddenly burnt her. "How silly of me!"
Harry hummed before visibly suppressing a yawn... and failing miserably. "Well," he said as he stood up from his bed and took a pair of joggers and an old-looking T-shirt out of his suitcase, "I think I'm going to hit the hay now." He walked towards the bathroom and closed the door behind him, leaving Malfoy alone in their room.
Potter turned towards the window, narrowing his eyes at Draco. "Stop laughing, you git", he grumbled. "Now I have to start all over again!"
"Harry...?"
But that wasn't the only thing Harry could see.
"I'm going to bed", Draco said softly, his gaze fixed on the door to the bathroom, closing it behind him and leaving a very confused Potter staring after him.
Why wouldn't it stop?
Excited murmurs filled the air around them.
Harry found himself smiling too, cheering along with the others and forgetting about his earlier feelings as he hadn't even noticed the mysterious girl disappearing.
In the first year of their relationship, Draco hadn’t asked Harry to do anything on Halloween, despite it being one of his favourite holidays – bar the Christmas holidays, of course. He had let Harry sulk and mourn the death of his parents, too scared he might ruin the still fragile
“I’ve been here three times, Draco. Of course I know the way to your room by now.”
Luna had been visiting him frequently since he had arrived at the old, cranky house. One way or another - he still didn't know how - she had been able to find him, though he was certain he had made sure nobody
As Ron set Hermione back down, she turned to Harry and wrapped her arms around him too, squeezing tightly. "You were absolutely brilliant up there, Harry", she mumbled against his chest, her voice sounding slightly muffled through the fabric of his Quidditch robes.
Nevertheless, he managed to spot the blurry shape of a blob on the ground near Potter's desk; a blob that was moving rather weirdly.
Ron's voice bellowed through the quiet of the room as he stormed inside, completely out of breath. His ginger hair was - honestly - an even worse mess than Harry's and his clothes were clearly put on hurriedly, seeing as his tie wasn't properly tied and the buttons of his white shirt didn't match the right holes.
Draco didn't answer to that.
Silence again filled the compartment after that as its occupants didn't really have anything else to say. Instead they just enjoyed each other's quiet company; something they had done countless of times before in the Slytherin common room over the past seven years.
A comfortable silence fell between the two friends as they were simply enjoying each other's quiet company. Harry was observing everyone else around them.
The Headmistress nodded to the portrait before clearing her throat and speaking the password -
“But Dracooo…”, Harry whined.
The sour expression was still visible on his face as he joined Harry back at the table. “Everyday, I wake up from the sound of Muggle traffic down on the street or the sound of yet
“Yeah!”, Teddy exclaimed, wiggling free from Harry’s arms, and running to the fireplace. “Come on!”
they called a relationship.
The six of them all mumbled apologies under their breaths before walking in the common room.
It hadn't gone unnoticed to her how much Harry had actually changed. Not only did he look thinner than he had ever been throughout the years, his behaviour had changed too.
. I started posting the chapters of Downhill on there too in smaller parts and I also post some of my Tumblr stuff on there too.
The Dark Lord was standing on the opposite side near the door, his wand lying loosely in the palm of his hand. His red eyes were alert, contemplating if the young woman in front of him would be a difficult opponent or not.
McGonagall nodded in understanding. "Putting you all together might have been a poor decision on my behalf. My apologies."
“But I didn’t give you a ring…”
or spiralling down into a loop of the same thoughts over and over and over.
and stay updated for future uploads and even other works!
"Oh, don't be so sour, darling", Pansy grinned, patting his head a few times. "We all know you're our one and only Drama Queen and
Throughout the whole day, he had felt like he could fall asleep wherever he was, even if he was standing at that given moment. He didn't care. He just wanted to close his eyes and doze off... if only for a few minutes.
"Well..." Godric paused, pursing his lips and for one moment Harry thought the man would tell him off for asking such ridiculous questions. One could not easily stop their mind from creating dreams, after all.
Yet the hands didn't go away. Instead they pulled him away from the cold wall, his head coming in contact with something soft and familiar, the scent of lavender and grapefruit filling his nose.
Draco rolled his eyes, a smile of his own lighting up his face. “What are you waiting for then? Come up here, you buffoon.”
A solid weight was suddenly placed on his shoulder, squeezing tightly and finally... finally the world around him seemed to change again, the screams lowering to a soft lull in the back of his head. The grass of the Quidditch pitch had replaced the rubble on the ground and the many dead bodies disappeared as the stands with the cheering students came back into view.
as an answer. She had told him she didn't like it when people lied to her. She had somewhat demanded him - in her own kind of way - to tell her how he really felt. She had reassured him that he didn't need to pretend in front of her and eventually he had dropped his walls around the girl, opening up a little more every time they talked.
“Unfortunately, darling, we
He didn’t know how people would react once he was free to go wherever he wanted again. But he could imagine the hate he was going to get. Perhaps he shouldn’t leave the Manor... at all.
, he thought, the faintest of smiles lifting the corners of his lips.
Draco nodded slowly; his gaze fixated on a burnt spot on the table.
It had been a long time since he had talked to Luna and he had to admit he hadn't missed the way his brain always seemed to turn into mush whenever he talked to her about anything else bar from how he was doing.
him he was actually getting better.
Things were so much easier back then.
Walls of rough stone blended beautifully with the dark wooden floor. Gold and silver coloured furniture was spread around the room, giving it a strangely welcome feeling.
Shaking her head, Astoria placed a finger underneath his chin, turning his head so he was forced to look at her.
"I'm sorry Dean", Seamus said softly, though it sounded loud in the silence that had fallen over the common room. "I know I shouldn't have said that. I'm really sorry."
Miserable.
When Head Auror Robards had offered Harry the position of DHA a few months back – shortly before the man announced he was going to retire soon – he had grabbed the opportunity with both hands. But what he hadn’t known, though, was that he would be stuck behind his desk at the offices more often than not, instead of doing the real work out on the field.
"Hex them?" Harry asked once only the two of them remained in the corridor, his head tilted in confusion. "I thought you weren't allowed to practice offensive spells without permission..."
He cursed the slight tremble in his voice.
"I'm going to bed", he announced, already standing up and stretching his arms above his head.
“Hmmm”, Harry replied, nuzzling Draco’s jawline, “
Harry clenched his fists tightly around the handle of his broom, suddenly wanting nothing more than to scream at the girl, telling her to removed those filthy hands from Draco.
year." Ron's voice filtered through the slightly ajar door from the next compartment.
So really, he owned his life to all three of them.
good news, earlier?”
Blaise was - surprisingly - reading a
And there… only a few feet away from him, sat one of the most stunning creatures he had ever had the blessing of laying his eyes upon.
“Oh, yes”, Harry chuckled, “Because of Teddy and certainly not because I told you I’m not wearing any pants underneath these trousers.”
"Breathe, Draco", the soft, sweet voice of Astoria said as Draco took a deep breath through his nose, concentrating on the feeling of her warm hands now running slow, comforting circles on his back. "I'm here with you. You're safe. They're gone."
times. With their first match in three weeks, he wanted all of them to be absolutely prepared for anything.
He still didn't understand how it had happened though. One moment he was flying around the pitch with the Snitch held firmly in his hand and the students cheering loudly, and the next moment he was standing between ruins as everyone around him was screaming.
They were like two silver moons encircled by a dark ring and little specks of black could be seen closer to the pupil. They looked like a reversed night sky, truly mesmerising.
Draco stood in front of Harry, his silver eyes roaming over his face, searching for something Harry didn't know. The intensity of Draco's eyes sent shivers down Harry's spine as the blond's face became less blurry with every second.
Unable to keep seeing Ginny like that, Harry wrapped his arms tightly around her shuddering form and pulled her closer to himself, letting her sob against his chest.
“You… you think I’m beautiful?” Harry asked, bewildered. Nobody had ever told him that. Nobody had ever cared enough to say something so… nice. He could feel his cheeks warming.
The sudden noise of people bustling around in the corridor took the blond out of his reverie. He turned away from the window, now facing the door of their compartment just in time to see a mob of black hair pass by, closely followed by a rather large group of students. They seemed to be herding outside in the corridor, all of them wearing a nervous or delighted smile.
A sad look was visible in Lily's green eyes as she glanced at baby Harry still sitting quietly in his crib, not really understanding what was happening. She closed her eyes momentarily, muttering something under her breath before turning back to the Dark Lord, determined to not give him the satisfaction of showing how scared she actually was.
Smiling softly, Luna tilted her head slightly, her blond curls bobbing around her head as she glanced over her shoulder. "Someone gave it to me", was her simple answer, though Harry knew exactly who the
"Well then, Harry? Do you want to be our captain or not?" Ernie Macmillan asked impatiently.
But with Luna... Luna was a whole different story.
Somehow, the feeling of Draco's hand intertwined with his own helped in keeping him grounded.
After what felt like years - but was probably only minutes - Draco had managed to get his breathing to even out, his body relaxing in the safe and warm embrace he was engulfed in. He didn't want to move away. He didn't want to lose this warmth.
The very familiar rush of adrenaline Harry always got from bickering with the Slytherin almost made him laugh out loud. Oh, how he had missed that feeling. It almost made him feel
Harry shrugged. “Maybe I am, maybe I’m not. Who cares?”
Twinkling stars dotted the night sky above, a light breeze caressing the ivy growing on the balustrade of the balcony Draco was standing on.
“Father kicked me out.”
Immediately, Teddy’s head snapped back up, his eyes twinkling with barely contained excitement. “Really?”
Draco’s head snapped up, barely contained excitement sparkling in the depths of his grey eyes. “Really?”
It didn't take him long to put the pieces together. The blob wasn't actually a blob, the blob was Potter sitting on the ground next to his fallen chair. He was clearly having trouble breathing; Draco would have recognised that sound from anywhere.
or not?
going on inside his mind.
Turning around so he was now facing Ron, Harry tried to smile but it only turned into a painful grimace. "It's nothing. I'm fine", he said softly. "Just a small headache."
George held up his hand, stopping Harry from whatever he was about to say. "Save it, Harry", he mumbled. "I don't want to hear it."
Malfoy rolled his eyes at him before turning around and opening the compartment door he had been leaning against earlier.
"Why not earlier than Saturday?" Parvati Patil asked. "We're already running behind on the other house teams."
"Plus," Ron added, still leaning on the door frame, completely unaware of the internal turmoil of his best friend, "I've heard they're pretty addicting too." He ran a hand through his messy ginger curls.
Nothing ever had to be easy for him!
as your King."
They walked the small distance to the golden bed. Harry happily crawled under the covers, not even bothering to change into his pyjamas. He nuzzled his head in his pillow, sniffing the familiar scent of his own shampoo. "Thank you, Draco", he mumbled, a tired smile lifting the corners of his lips.
An uncomfortable silence greeted the two friends.
So, perhaps he wasn't fine and hadn't been for quite some time, but... Could he really trust Draco enough to tell him? Did he really want anyone else aside from Luna know how he really felt?
about someone, and about you, no less?"
The next time he had asked, Malfoy had even made a snide remark about Harry's inability to remember where he had put his stuff:
A hand waved in front of Harry as he - once again - blinked his eyes a few times. "Hmm, what?" he asked confused.
From down on the pitch he could hear his fellow Eighth Years cheering and applauding, chanting his name enthusiastically as he descended; a proud smile still on his lips.
"Well, well", said one of them, taking a step towards where Draco was standing. Draco thought his name was something along the lines of Oliver Gage - or was it Nicholas? He wasn't entirely sure. Not that he cared anyways.
shimmered as if the sun was shining directly on them.
Eventually, Ron signed for them to come back down, a scowl covering his freckled face. Harry knew Ron didn't like to admit what he was about to. He still didn't particularly like Draco.
. He couldn't quite imagine something interesting written in that book - or in any book for that matter.
A faint blush coated Draco’s cheeks, a smile appearing on his lips. “Shut up”, he muttered. He leaned in, touching his lips softly against Harry’s for only a moment before pulling away again. “Now, we should get ready too. It’s already getting late.”
Even Hermione - who had only heard the things Harry had told her about Narcissa Malfoy and the trials before he had left the Burrow - nodded along, a small smile playing around her lips.
as this.
"Like what you see?" Draco asked, now turning to also look at Harry, his grey eyes twinkling in the few rays of sunshine filtering through the thick rainclouds.
know is that you want it to stop.
“Oh, my darling Draco”, she sniffed before pulling him into a tight hug, squeezing him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Aside from the Weasleys and Sirius, Harry never really had people he could call his family.
Draco, however, stayed behind, squeezing Harry's hand to hold him back too. "I want to talk to you", he said, his voice not much louder than a whisper.
Draco seemed to hesitate for a bit, but when the brunette girl whispered something in his ear he smiled slightly, nodding his head and mounting his broom. He chased after the others, readying himself for the short game to start.
But still...
Harry nodded, a smile of his own tugging at the end of his lips. "Of course, 'Mione", he said. "I've been through worse."
to sleep here if you don’t want to. I’m not forcing you to stay over.”
Ron shrieked rather loudly when he saw his reflection in the mirror on the wall next to the wardrobe, desperately trying to make himself look at least presentable.
The amount of homework the teachers kept giving them was unbelievable, not to mention the training sessions of the Quidditch team. Ron had wanted them to train at least two times a week, but sometimes they would even practice three times or even
Either way, Harry didn't really enjoy it. The book was far too confusing.
Someone had to do it, right?
Harry shook his head, a fond smile appearing on his face. Of course Luna would know where he was.
Ron - now also flanked by his two best friends - opened his mouth to retort some nasty insult to the three Slytherins, but was interrupted by the strict voice of their Headmistress, "Mr. Weasley, Mr. Malfoy please refrain from whatever you were doing and join the rest of us inside." McGonagall gave the six of them a cautionary look. "We do not want a detention on our first day back, now do we?"
Ginny honestly didn't know what to say anymore. She had tried talking to him many times over these two weeks of being back at Hogwarts, yet nothing seemed to work.
It was fairly dark in the room, though Harry could clearly make out the two - or rather three - people who occupied the small space. His mother was standing protectively in front of a crib in which baby Harry sat, eyeing the situation with curious, emerald eyes.
"Hullo Luna", Harry slurred slightly, a lopsided smile gracing his features.
Draco took a step back and eyed his work, his eyes racking appreciatively over Harry’s body. He hummed his satisfaction. “It’s a shame we still have places to be this evening.” A predatory smirk appeared on his face.
Draco had been his solution to any of that, Harry had ruined that anyways, hadn’t he? He was certain Draco wouldn't want anything to do with him anymore, not after that afternoon.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you going to keep standing there and stare at me like a buffoon?" Malfoy asked, not bothering to look up from his sketch.
Still slightly baffled, Harry answered, “I could always say no.”
"I'm sorry", Harry choked out, taking a step backwards from the other boy. He couldn't do this, not yet at least. "I'm sorry. I can't do this."
Harry didn't answer, ignoring his friend.
The sun had almost completely disappeared behind the Scottish Hills, only a soft orange hue still visible from where he sat on the damp grass.
"Enough", another voice interrupted.
His tactic seemed to work as Draco's back straightened a little and his features relaxed slightly. "Very well actually", he began. "I've receive a letter this morning. Apparently my mother's sister Andromeda has been over to visit with my cousin Teddy." His eyes sparkled a little more at that. "They've made up over the summer and I think Mother couldn't have been happier to finally be reunited again with her lost sister."
She had also noticed how he seemed to space out during classes more often than not. Or how he didn't really laugh with the jokes their fellow Eighth Years made. Not to mention the times she had found him working on homework assignments even
She had come up to his room after lunch with a large plate full of food and had placed it in the middle of his desk, preventing him from adding any more sentences to his already hopeless essay. She had determinedly taken place on Draco's desk next to his, her arms crossed and a pointed look in her brown eyes, wordlessly telling Harry she wouldn't leave before all the food on the plate was gone.
Not to mention the almost irresistible urge to yell at the mysterious, brunette girl - Harry had learned her name was Astoria - who seemed to be at Draco's side wherever he went, her perfect smile never faltering, even when the other students clearly didn't hide their dismay for her companion.
He looked up at the two men, a huge grin plastered on his tiny face. He squealed loudly when Harry picked him up and placed him on his hip. “We’re all matching!”, he exclaimed, clapping his hands together repeatedly.
"Dunno", Harry said, a genuine smile lighting up his face. "But thanks for the food."
Closing the portrait behind him, Harry was surprised to find it empty.
"Some people might find it disturbing if you keep staring at them like that", a dreamy voice said from Harry's left, blue eyes twinkling merrily in the soft light of the campfire.
The silence, however, was interrupted when Ginny spoke again. "I brought you some food", she said hesitantly, searching around in her bag before pulling out an - in napkin wrapped - piece of shepherd's pie.
Silver eyes narrowing, Draco glared at Harry. “Whatever, you Know-It-All-Muggle-Professional. I should’ve let you dress up as Granger instead.”
Ron huffed, but didn't say anything else so Harry bid the both of them - and Rowena too, of course - goodnight before heading upstairs to find his own room. He looked at all the names next to the doors, yet it wasn't until the very last door at the top of the winding staircase that he saw his name in beautiful, gold calligraphy next to a name in silver calligraphy.
he was going to stay at the old, dusty house. Nobody was supposed to know about his whereabouts. Even the owls hadn't managed to locate him, returning back to their senders with the unopened letter still in their beak or tied around their legs.
know what I mean, Harry", she said, her eyes twinkling softly again. "You and Draco would be a lovely couple. A rather strange and unexpected, but lovely couple."
“What are you doing here?” he asked.
Shoulders slumping, Harry looked at the other Weasleys, his gaze eventually landing on Ginny, who stood between Percy and Charlie. He gave her a pleading look.
Harry had actually taken the time to write a reply, telling Draco about the trials; about how he had started Auror training, even though he wasn’t sure it was something he wanted to do; and he told Draco about the loneliness he had been feeling. The loneliness and guilt.
the light of the room falling softly on the smooth, porcelain skin of his neck and face.
What am I going to do now?”
actually want to marry
The thunder once again roared loudly outside as Harry made his way to the small, open kitchen and poured himself a big glass of water.
Harry nodded. "Every now and again I'll write something in it."
Harry shivered at the thought of what they might do '
He looked like the moon, surrounded by the stars and it was absolutely
The trembling lessened slightly, Teddy tentatively poking his head from underneath the blankets “Really?”, he asked quietly, his eyes still watery and his cheeks flushed.
He didn't particularly want to tell anyone about it. He just wanted to forget it ever happened.
"Are you completely off your rocker, Goldstein", Theo said, giving the Ravenclaw an incredulous look. "Weasley wouldn't be able to hold our team together for more than five seconds."
afternoon, instead of joining his fellow Aurors out on the field. He was certain he had done more paperwork in one afternoon than he had done in the six years since he had started as an Auror.
He was never going to finish this Potions essay. Not if his mind kept carrying him away from the task at hand.
Harry stumbled, his hands catching the rough castle wall just in time to prevent himself from falling to the ground. Lifting his wand, he cast a
Malfoy sniggered at Harry’s struggling, putting away his sketchbook and closing the window. He ignited the fireplace with a simple flick of his wand. "Honestly, Potter," the blond smirked, "haven't you ever heard of manners?"
Harry didn't think he could call their conversation
Packing away his stuff didn’t take as long as he had expected. So it was only about half an hour later that he found himself standing in front of the Floo, the powder slowly slipping through his fingers.
idea how worried we've all been?"
Now though, Harry had been more on his own than with his friends. And although he still saw them every day, he couldn't help but miss them. Even the other Eighth Years - who had noticed Harry's sudden drop in mood and had tried to cheer him up on different occasions - didn't seem to completely chase away his loneliness.
Her attempts hadn't gone unnoticed by the others either and soon enough, almost all Eighth Years were following her lead. They talked to Harry occasionally, walking with him to classes or sharing some sweets they had bought in Hogsmeade the other day. The dynamics between all the Eighth Years had changed slightly from still being tentative towards each other to an unspoken camaraderie.
and stay updated for future uploads and even other works!
The smooth voice of Draco Malfoy echoed through the silent room. A full plate of food was placed on the side of Harry's desk; the smell of his favourite foods filled his nose.
"But I hope you change your mind about this", she continued. "Goodnight, Harry."
It didn't take him long to find it, however. There, in the middle of it all, the black mob of messy curls accompanied with crooked round glasses was trying to make their way through the crowd - and failing miserably.
Nerves started to kick in the closer he got. He will see his best friends again. His best friends with whom he had fought a war, friends who had stayed by his side no matter what, yet he had abandoned them. He had left them.
"The position of Seeker will go to Harry Potter -" another round of applause with a few cheers "-the Beaters are Terry Boot and Hannah Abbott -" more applause and cheers "-and lastly Blaise Zabini and Mandy Brocklehurst will be our Chasers."
Ron closed the door behind him, his footsteps fading away as he made his way down the stairs towards the common room.
Go check out my
He felt his mother shake her head. “Don’t be sorry”, she said, pulling back so she could look him in the eyes. “Never be sorry for who you love, my dragon. Be proud instead.”
"I can't imagine a conversation with McGonagall being exciting", Blaise commented, marking the page in his book where he had stopped reading. To Harry's surprise it was a muggle book; one he had read himself, though he couldn't remember for the life of him what it was about. Something that had to do with a young man who moved to a rich part on Long Island and a weird neighbour who was obsessed with the young man's cousin. Or was he in love with her?
He fingered the sun-shaped clasp thoughtfully as he turned to face Draco. “Are you finally going to tell me what exactly we’re supposed to-”
“Oh! Harry…”
Shivering, he wrapped his arms around himself as he slowly continued his pointless walking. He cursed himself for not bringing anything warmer than his T-shirt and the pair of joggers he was wearing as his pyjamas. With winter just around the corner, the temperature in and around the castle wasn't much higher - if not already below - freezing point.
"I don't feel well enough today", Harry sighed, turning on his side so he was fully facing the other boy in the room. "I've woken up with a terrible headache and I'm also not in the mood to listen to the never-ending nagging of all the professors today. I think I'll just catch up with some homework at the library."
Glaring at Pansy, Ron opened his mouth to probably say something that would make things worse, but was stopped by Hermione as she quickly placed a hand over his mouth, whispering something in his ear that made the tips of his ears go red.
- on the other side of the campfire.
It didn't take long for Ron to join the party too, wrapping his arms around his best friend and girlfriend. "Welcome back, mate", was the only thing he said before his voice broke, a lone tear escaping his eyes.
"Of course we are, love", Blaise replied, rolling his eyes playfully. "Although life will be different without you, mate."
And to top it all off, a few students had already walked up to him, asking for an autograph. Not to mention the stares and whispers directed his way as he walked by.
"But we did win the cup, didn't we?"
Silence filled the room, the only sound coming from the dancing flames in the fireplace. Harry stared at the fire, admiring how the flames slowly destroyed the log. The way they surrounded the whole piece of wood, swallowing it until it literally fell apart and ruined its shape - its form - until the only thing left were its ashes.
He wasn't going to say that though. It would only worry his friends more and he didn't want that because - really - he was fine. Nothing he couldn't handle.
Yet Astoria - the caring and stubborn girl she is - had always been there for him, helping wherever she could, even though her parents had forbidden her from ever speaking with him again.
Draco clenched his fists as he met his father’s steady gaze. “I will
Draco's gaze shifted to Harry's hands who - although they somehow managed to land safely onto the ground - were still clutching the handle of his broom in a vice-like grip, his knuckles as white as a sheet of parchment.
Now that he really thought about it, he had been a horrible friend to them for the past few years. It was his fault, after all, they had to fight a war. It was his fault so many people had died. He was the one responsible for all their grief.
the intensity of Draco’s silver eyes boring into his own.
With a loud
And second of all, the landlord had threatened Draco more than once to kick him out of the apartment because some neighbours had complained about Draco making loud noises even when he had barely set a foot in his own apartment ever since he and Harry had gotten together.
An almost overwhelming warmth spread through Harry’s chest at those words. He held Teddy a little closer and buried his face in the boy’s messy, blond hair, planting a soft kiss on the top of his head. He wanted to say something, truly he did, but his throat had completely closed up, a large lump in his throat preventing him from saying anything.
“Draco,” Harry closed the distance between them, ignoring the slight tremble in his hands as he cupped Draco’s face between them, “you know you can tell me everything. We’re a team, remember?”
Hermione, who was sitting in the armchair next to Harry's, snorted and looked up from the large leather-bound book she was reading. "Of course not", she said with an amused twinkle in her brown eyes. "He's just being dramatic for no reason."
The Hufflepuff Seeker - a Fourth Year Harry only vaguely recognised from passing through the corridors - was tailing him closely, the yellow colour of their Quidditch robes just visible out of the corner of his eye.
Luckily, he hadn't flown too high up in the air, resulting in him only having a broken arm. It could have been much worse. Though this also meant the Eighth Year Quidditch Team was missing a Chaser.
many times already."
However, Draco hadn't turned up.
Helga shook her head, a few loose curls bouncing around her face. "I do not believe in things such as picking sides, Salazar. You should know that."
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “I think I’ve seen enough curtains to last me a lifetime, thank you very much”, he said as he took the fabric out of the box. “No, this is another part of your costume.”
Honestly, why should he go see a mind-healer? He was perfectly fine.
So, no. Perhaps they weren't just normal friends. But why couldn't he tell Draco how he really felt though? Why was all of this so bloody confusing?
Terry waved his comment away. "Yes, yes, we know, Weasley", he said. "Now, are there any more objections?"
Grumbling under his breath, Harry complied – only a tiny bit reluctant this time, seeing as he had managed to steal another quick yet passionate kiss before Draco literally kicked him out of the room and into the bathroom to change.
Shaking his head, Draco closed his book with a loud
Harry felt content at that moment. He was surrounded by two of the most important people in his life. He was surrounded by his
"There are a lot of things you don't know about me, Potter", Malfoy said, finally glancing at Harry, who was sitting on his bed, trying his hardest not to spill any of the delicious dessert on his clothes. Unfortunately it seemed to be an impossible task as he managed to drop his piece at east three times in less than a minute.
The Snitch was right there. Right there in front of him. He only had to reach a little further and...
As nobody made a move to ask anything, Ron clapped his hands. "Alright then, that's settled." He turned to Hermione, lowering his voice slightly to whisper in her ear. "McGonagall also wanted to speak to the both of us."
Whenever they talked - as short and scarce as the moments were sometimes - he always completely forgot about his loneliness, his emptiness.
Everything becomes dull and meaningless. It fills your mind your mind with questions:
Malfoy was sitting on the window sill of the open window, small clouds of cigarette smoke coming out of perfectly shaped, rosy lips. One of his legs dangled over the edge of the sill, swinging to a rhythm only he could hear and a sketchbook was resting on his other leg. The cool September breeze blew over his face, causing some of his platinum hair to fall in his eyes as he took a deep drag from a lit cigarette between his fingers.
Harry glared half-heartedly at Draco as the latter placed the tiara – no,
"Look where you're going, Weasley", Malfoy muttered his silver eyes narrowing momentarily. Pansy and Blaise came to stand either side of him, just in case.
The low buzz of discussing murmurs filled the silence. "I don't think Ron being captain is such a bad idea", Anthony Goldstein spoke up, his voice just barely audible above the rather loud murmurs.
In the first few days back she had attempted to talk to him. She had tried to get him to open up about what was going on with him and what had happened over the summer. Yet the only thing she had gotten was a tired
He knew what he had to do next. Healer Glover had prepared him many times for moments like this, yet most time he had to do it for himself as he fought his way through a panic attack of his own. "You'll be okay, Harry", he said, squeezing his shoulder again. "You'll be okay. I'm here."
Raising a scolding eyebrow at the first part of what Teddy had said, Harry asked, “Did you read those forbidden books from Gran again?”
"Draco," she started, another finger wiping away a lone tear on his cheek. "You don't have to be sorry, you know that." A small, genuine smile lifted up the corners of her mouth. "Whenever something like this happens, it isn't your fault. It just happens, so there's no need to be ashamed of anything."
Out of the corner of his eyes he noticed Rowena curiously peaking her head above the pages of her book, listening closely to what the boys were talking about.
Silence fell between the two friends as they watched the Giant Squid poke its head above the surface of the lake.
Harry didn't know.
“You didn’t fuck anything up, Draco.”
“I want you to join us”, the Siren said softly, “I want you to become one of us.”
The now familiar warm, fuzzy feeling spread around in his chest, causing his cheeks to redden a little underneath the still questioning gaze of the blond. Harry shook his head, offering the other boy a - what he hoped to be - reassuring smile.
Over the last two weeks, Harry had asked that same question multiple times. He managed to keep losing his quills, although he believed someone was deliberately stealing them.
“You should know, Teddy,” Harry started, holding the boy close to his chest, “that Draco and I will always make sure
The two boys were left alone on the pitch after that. Everyone had retreated to the castle to celebrate or to do whatever else you could do on a Saturday afternoon.
Gage was the smallest one out of the five, his dark hair neatly combed to one side, a few strands covering one of his eyes. The other eye was glaring at him, his lips curling into a sneer Salazar Slytherin would have been proud of.
He couldn't afford any of that. One step out of line and he would be sent to join his father in the dark, cold cells of Azkaban.
So why did he keep feeling that way towards her then?
Taking a deep breath, he gathered all the Gryffindor courage he could muster.
Her face softening even more, Astoria kissed the top of his blond head, a smile lighting up her doll-like face. "Of course, Dray", she said. "Don't worry about it."
But the pain never came.
Harry had to refrain himself from jumping the other boy right then and there; his hands clenched into tight fists.
Go check out my
Harry swore he saw a tear running down her cheek when she turned back around and strode to the village, leaving him standing alone on the dark and suspiciously empty rocks.
With a satisfied hum, Draco finally leaned back, straightening his T-shirt as he took a sweater - Harry thought looked strangely familiar - from his desk. The blond practically bounced around the room to their door, opening it and waiting impatiently for Harry to join him.
to go if you don’t want to”, he said in a low voice, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.
Approaching the owl slowly, Harry took the letter from its leg, closely examining the rather heavy envelope. He shook his head, an incredulous yet fond smile lifting at the corners of his lips once he saw the familiar Hogwarts crest on the seal of the envelope. Leave it to Headmistress McGonagall to find a way to reach him, even though he had done everything to make sure he
Once he was sure his friend wouldn't burst into his room again, Harry fell down onto his bed, cursing himself when pain shot through his head.
There - right in front of him - stood the Weasleys.
Bloody hell, that boy did things to his heart Harry had never felt before. Not to mention the warm, fuzzy feeling that was slowly travelling southwards - or was it northwards now that he was lying upside-down?
The Siren in front of him looked like pure silver, with long, white, almost translucent hair adorned with pearls and shells. Glistening skin that slowly merged into the silver scales of a long tail.
He cursed the unwanted tears that had started forming behind his eyes; he cursed the butterflies that were once again doing somersaults in his stomach; he cursed his bloody life.
"Breathe, Harry."
"Boys!" Hermione interrupted, exasperation now clearly visible in her brown eyes. "Will you both shut up for one moment. You can continue this argument later."
Although Harry was known to be more oblivious than the average person, it hadn't gone unnoticed by him how some students kept giving Draco vile looks or how they sometimes threw mild stinging hexes or tripping hexes in his direction.
But then again, did he really trust Draco enough? Did he really want to tell Draco everything before even his best friends knew?
"Charlie once told me a story about one of his co-workers in Romania. He had gotten quite addicted to the potion and in a daze to get new dosages he had ran into the territory of one of their newest dragons. The poor lad got burnt alive -" he cringed at the thought "-the dragon wasn't trained as well as the older ones yet, so it had mistaken him for dinner." Ron shook his head.
A half-hearted glare was sent his way as Malfoy started walking down the winding stairs. "Ha-ha. Very funny, Potter."
Harry nodded quickly, taking another sip from his tea to hide his face. "Of course. Why would I lie to you?"
Harry hadn’t felt this handsome in a long while. He looked like the sun
Taking his wand and whispering
"Yeah about that..." Harry scratched the back of his neck, a sheepish smile on his face. "Can I, perhaps, borrow another quill?"
was that we wouldn’t be able to go trick-or-treating this year -” Teddy’s shoulders slumped slightly at that, his head leaning back against Harry’s chest “-
Ron glared at his dorm mate. "Maybe you should let me explain first", he said. He cleared his throat to get everyone's attention before continuing, "As you all know the Eighth Years are kind of a separate house, right?"
But why wouldn't his mind believe those words? Why did he always feel the need to apologise profusely after something like this happened?
A hand cupped his face, a thumb caressing the sharp edges of his cheekbone.
Of course, Draco hadn't been at all pleased with the news, thinking Astoria would just be some stuck up pureblood girl who only wanted him for his family's wealth and name. But as some years had passed and they had gotten to know each other better, Draco had actually grown to like the girl and they had become quite close friends. You could say she was the sister he never had.
His still damp hair clung to his forehead, falling down in front of his eyes and Harry had to restrain himself from brushing the strands away from those two beautiful, silver eyes.
"Oh... Hi, Harry."
Harry didn't turn around to look at what had happened to the other Seeker though. It wasn't exactly that he didn't care; he was just getting tired of having to chase after the Snitch. He wanted it to be over and done with, so he could take a well-deserved, hot shower and finally relax. And he was certain that if he looked away at that moment, the Snitch would disappear... again.
"I've been looking for you", the ginger said to her girlfriend, "Boot just
Yet there was something different now.
"Is it true what I've heard?" he asked, the sneer turning into a malicious smirk. "The Ministry is really keeping a close eye on you? Breathing down your neck so they can throw you in Azkaban from the moment you set one step out of place?"
Slight disappointment filled Harry at those words. If he would have to wait until he met someone, he might have to wait for the rest of his life. Plus, he had already met a lot of people throughout his life, yet none of them seemed to be his solution to his nightmares.
Harry snorted softly, shaking his head. His fiancé truly was helpless sometimes. “It’s called a film, love”, he answered, “Muggles watch it on a television.”
The journal... Harry hadn't touched the little notebook since he had placed it on top of the desk in his room. It had been a birthday present from Luna. She had said it would help him arrange his thoughts if he wrote about the things that had happened that day or about random things that came to his mind.
Harry rushed to the family once the shock had gone away. He fell on his knees in front of Fred, tears steadily streaming down his face. "I'm so sorry, Fred", he whispered, his voice trembling almost as much as his hands did.
"Draco?" Astoria called out to him, Draco protesting as she pushed him slightly away from the embrace so she could look at him. She brought one of her hands up to cup his cheek, her thumbs wiping away some of the tears that were still streaming down his face. She smiled at him; a bright, loving smile, though Draco didn't miss the sadness that flashed through her dark eyes. "You're okay", she said firmly.
But that made him who he was and the Golden Trio wouldn't be the same if it was any other way.
Harry had given her a confused look, trying to understand what she meant by that. Unfortunately his mind had come up blank - something that seemed to happen quite often when he talked to the girl.
"Draco, dear, you have to at least finish the food on your plate", Pansy said, her dark, pencilled eyebrows raising towards her hairline. "You know I can't allow you to leave if you haven't eaten anything more than that."
"So tell me, Draco," Astoria said, placing a small hand on his arm, her sweet smile never faltering, "how have you been?"
Harry had been thoroughly disappointed when he couldn't find the blond head between the others who had turned up for the try-outs. He hadn't been in the stands to watch either - like some of the other Eighth Years had done, under which Hermione and Pansy. And when Harry had asked Blaise, the Italian had frowned, looking around for his friend but shaking his head as he - too - couldn't find him, the crease between his eyebrows deepening.
"Please forgive us", she mouthed.
Muggle – brightened up the cold stone and wooden walls of the cottage.
Surprisingly, it hadn’t taken Harry as long as usual to put on his costume this year. Draco had, for once, chosen for a rather simplistic costume – much to Harry’s disbelief. If there was one thing he had learnt about his fiancé it was the fact that on Halloween he went all out on their costumes, coming up with the craziest and most complex combinations of clothes someone could ever think off and somehow he
Coming back was a huge mistake.
Also, let me know what you thought of the chapter!! :)
Pansy and Blaise were listening to Daphne Greengrass ranting about something, although the two Slytherins looked like they wanted to be anywhere else but there. Pansy had her forehead resting on Blaise's shoulder as the latter tried to casually tune out the ranting girl, taking drags from his lit cigarette every now and again.
Now thoroughly confused, Harry turned back around to continue his way, but stopped when he heard a noise coming from further down the hall.
As the portrait closed behind them, they were greeted by the the circular room that was their new common room.
Halloween, Harry decided, had to be the worst holiday of the year.
Harry, though, had stopped in his tracks, his eyes wide.
Excited claps and cheers rang in the air, Pansy running up to them and throwing her arms around the blond, her delighted voice audible above all the other noise.
As soon as the window was open enough, the owl flew inside, landing promptly on the back of the armchair Harry had vacated a few seconds ago.
“Of course you could,” Draco’s lips brushed the side of Harry’s neck, “you and your strange midnight walks.”
Draco shivered as he walked out the common room, already dreading the winter that was just around the corner. He preferred the long, hot days of summer. Days where he could sit outside underneath one of the tall trees in the garden of the Manor, reading books or sketching his surroundings, smelling the sweet air around him filled with the scent of blooming flowers.
It wasn't supposed to be empty, though. McGonagall had made sure of that after poor Neville had been locked out the common room on one particular night a few days ago. It had been Filch who had found him after Peeves had gone through the corridors yelling about some students out of bed.
A small round of applause followed.
Knowing he would never fall back asleep now, Harry swung his legs over the edge of the bed, stretching his arms above his head. Quiet as not to wake the sleeping boy in the bed next to his, he sneaked out the room, descending the winding staircase to the abandoned common room below.
“I know, love. It’s okay.”
Harry sighed, running a tired hand through the mess he called his hair. "Is it that obvious?" he asked, his voice sounding defeated.
Scratching the back of his neck, Harry stared at the ground, avoiding the curious grey gaze of the boy in front of him. "Why didn't you turn up for the position of Seeker?" he asked quietly.
Weasley hadn't done anything else but try to rile him up over the last weeks, trying to get under his skin and waiting for Draco to finally explode. Unfortunately for Weasley, he wasn't going to take the bait.
This one, however...
when he could see them,
"I know, I know", Ron sighed, running a hand through his ginger locks. "But we will have to do with two Chasers for now, seeing as Neville is still recovering from his broken arm."
"Yes, okay, we get it", Harry said, scowling at the three Slytherins. Honestly, they were being extra insufferable today.
Shaking his head, Harry tried to clear his mind, refocusing on the conversation around him.
Mrs. Weasley let out another heart-breaking sob at that, her fingers stroking the ginger curls of her late son.
“I came to see you”, was the short answer.
In only two weeks, his house arrest would be over. And despite the fear of the things that might happen when people would see him or his mother, some good things awaited him too.
As the little tawny owl realised it wasn't going to get any treats for the long journey it had made all the way from Scotland, it hooted exasperatedly and ruffled its feathers before flying away through the still open window, disappearing from sight once it had crossed the wards.
It was quiet for some time. Harry was staring at their - by now - intertwined fingers. Draco's thumbs were still moving in slow circles over the back of his hands.
"Remember, Harry", he said, looking directly at Harry who was still sitting in the armchair. "You have to look deeper than the surface to
Even now, as he was watching the outside world through the open window in the sitting room of 12 Grimmauld Place, Harry relished in the warm breeze that brushed against his face, occasionally sipping his sweet Earl Grey tea. He could sit there for what felt like eternity.
"You're fine", the blond muttered drily, rolling his eyes, "Of course, you were going to say that. It seems to be the only thing coming out of your mouth recently." He shook his head, a few blond locks falling into his eyes. "Why would I even expect anything else?"
"Tell me, Harry," Luna said now, "how have you been?"
They had been sending letters ever since. And somewhere in those three years, something had changed between them.
“The question you were asking before you decided to completely ravish me”, Draco explained, his lips brushing ever so slightly against the sensitive skin of Harry’s neck as he talked. “What our costumes were supposed to be.”
Draco shrugged as he sank further down in his seat. "I don't think I have many other choices if I want to start over, Blaise. It's not like people here in Britain will look past that disgusting Dark Mark on my arm and give me a proper chance to prove myself."
He might need to take a cold shower before he went to dinner.
Laughing, Harry put his hands up in surrender. "I'm sorry", he smirked, "I simply noticed your amazing jumper and wondered where you got it from."
A laugh escaped his throat as she said this. Of course she wouldn't believe him, she never did. Though it was worth the try.
"And they're still about the same things?"
"When is your next appointment with Healer Glover?" Astoria asked, her fingers combing soothingly through his hair.
– on top of his messy hair, mumbling a Spell under his breath whilst waving his wand so the
At moments like that he wished people would stop seeing him as the hero he might be. He wished they would stop invading his
, Harry thought bitterly.
"What do you want, Potter?"
"Oh, come on, Granger. You have to admit it was becoming rather exciting", Pansy smirked, winking at the two boys in question. "I bet you it wouldn't have taken much longer until they would have started a good ol', traditional fistfight."
"No, no, dear", Rowena shook her head, a loose curl falling into her face. "Don't worry about it. They have to sort things out eventually. Their rivalry has been going on for far too long now. They're grown adults, for Merlin's sake."
Yes, he appreciated his best friend’s attempts to still include him, he really did, and it wasn’t like becoming DHA had been a mistake – absolutely not. He just couldn’t help but feel an emptiness creeping inside his chest at the thought of not belonging to the group anymore; of missing out on all the fun…
Hermione look up from her book, her head tilted in silent question. "The both of us? Why would she want to talk to us? We haven't done anything wrong, have we?"
Nodding his head, Harry swallowed his bite of food. "Of course I know that."
Surprised at what his best friend had said, Ron turned on the chair, all anger and hatred he had been feeling a few seconds ago disappearing immediately. Slowly but surely, a smile grew on his still slightly red face.
Or would it?
Harry leaned back against a sturdy chest. “Hmmm… just thinking about our French lessons.”
Ear-splitting roars erupted from the stands below, the students absolutely going wild as they all celebrated the Eighth Years' first win of the season.
"What are you doing here,
Harry let his head fall back down on his desk with a loud - and rather hollow -
Harry stepped forward again, taking Draco's hands out of his hair and entwining their fingers together. “Calm down, love”, he said gently, “everything’s fine. You didn’t mess anything up.”
How Harry knew that, he didn't know. He had definitely
Like Harry, Draco was wearing an outer robe over his shirt – fastened by a crescent moon-shaped clasp – though his was dark blue, almost black,  decorated with a million small diamond-like gems that sparkled in a non-existing light with every movement. Draco’s long, pale hair fell in soft waves on his back.
Rolling his eyes, Harry walked towards the Slytherin, brushing past him as he exited their room. "Why are you so happy anyways?" he asked conversationally as they started their long descend down the winding stairs.
"Anyways!" Seamus quickly said, effectively cutting off a very angry-looking Ronald Weasley before everything exploded. "Harry, perhaps you have someone in mind who can be captain then?"
With a small, reassuring smile Harry took the - in napkin wrapped - piece and put it on the table, promising his friend to eat it later if he felt hungry.
“You won’t.”
Every word felt like a heartless punch to Harry's face. Realisation slowly made its way through the haziness that was his mind. "George, I-"
“Of course, Mother”, Draco said. He stepped into the Floo, a fresh hand of powder slipping through his fingers. “Goodbye.”
Shaking the thoughts away from his mind, Harry walked further into the room, closing the door behind him.
Potter.
Yet now - when it was over - it just didn't feel right. Harry had wanted to race against Malfoy in the air, like they've done countless of times. Just them two, chasing the glittering ball as it zigzagged through the air, trying to shake them off its trail.
"I would have taken one if I could find them."
But before he could take hold of the doorknob, Luna caught his wrist, her slender fingers wrapping firmly around it. She turned back towards Harry, her intense blue gaze freezing him in place.
His heart felt like it had been stabbed, tears forming behind his eyes. Yet, he was angry at the same time. Not at himself, but for some reason - he didn't dare to name - he was mad at the girl; that gorgeous girl standing way too close to Draco.
"Ah, of course", the Gryffindor Founder smiled understandingly, a thoughtful expression crossing his face as he stroked his beard with his free hand, the other still running through the lion's mane. "Nightmares truly are a horrific phenomenon. When I was - well, still alive, I should say - I also used to have them frequently. Their horrors would sometimes even haunt me at day."
Rolling his eyes
Not that he had borrowed her notes much over the last few weeks.
This was all his fault; all the deaths were his fault. Fred's death, Remus' and Tonks' deaths. Even Sirius' and his parents' deaths were all because of him. If only he had been faster, if only he hadn't been alive...
The first thing Harry noticed when he opened the door to his new dorm was the scraping of charcoal on rough parchment. The room was cold, shivers running all over his body at the low temperature. Though August had been hot, the weather had turned completely around in only a few days.
It didn't take long for the ginger to fall down on the golden sofa next to Harry's armchair, taking deep breaths to calm down his racing heartbeat.
"And besides," Harry continued, "I'm not hungry."
They had been running around in his head from the moment he had woken up, trying to drive him to his breaking point like they had done many times before. Not to mention the weird feelings he had been feeling recently towards a certain blond - and rather handsome - Slytherin.
"Have you used the journal I've given you yet?" she asked after a while.
That couldn't hurt, right?
so Ron continued once again, "Well, every house has its own Quidditch Team and since we can't play on the teams of the other houses, I thought it would be nice if we had our own Quidditch Team."
Malfoy's voice broke through Harry's thoughts. He blinked a few times to regain his focus. His cheeks reddened even more as he averted his gaze, finally letting go of the pale wrist. "I uhm... Can I uhm... Maybe... Could you..."
"I think I might be confused", Harry admitted eventually, glancing back at Luna who was staring at him, understanding clearly visible in her blue eyes.
The way the stars seemed to make a halo around his head and the way he just so casually moved his piece of charcoal as if he did it every day. It kind of made him look... ethereal.
Though Harry wasn't celebrating.
“I know.” Mother was standing next to him now, one of her hands softly touching his elbow so Draco would turn to her. She smiled sadly.
Too close, dammit! They were standing too close!
“Yes, of course!” Harry placed a kiss on the palm of Draco’s hand. “The most important thing is that I love my
Luna pursed her lips, her face turning thoughtful as she picked a biscuit from the plate on the side table next to the window. "I don't think I believe you."
"You know," Pansy started from her place on the couch on the other side of Harry's armchair, "I have to agree with Granger for once."
Ron scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Oh yes, I'm sure. That's why most of the Death Eaters we've fought against were
Groaning loudly, Harry let his head fall onto the hard wood of his desk, closing his eyes as yet another wave of exhaustion washed over him.
chickened out this time.
“Good”, Harry said, and closed the small distance between them, his lips  lovingly caressing Draco’s.
There was nothing there. He had seemingly tripped over nothing but air.
They both sent him cold glares before resuming their bickering that now didn't have anything to do with Slytherins anymore. Now, they were just arguing about whether they should shower in the morning or in the evening.
Another group of people passed on the street below, their drunken giggles filling the warm evening air. Harry closed his eyes, letting his head fall back on Draco’s shoulder. “I could go for a little walk, right now.”
After the war both Harry and Ginny had come to the conclusion that things had changed too much for them to still be together. So they had left it behind them, closing the chapter of their romantic relationship and starting a new one as good friends.
"And why, dear Lily," Voldemort cackled, "would I do such a ludicrous thing?"
“Draco, what’s going on?” Harry took a step closer, one of his hands reaching out to Draco.
There, right in front of him, stood a group of Slytherins, their wands held loosely in their hands. Draco recognised the group as the ones who had kept glaring at him in the Great Hall at the beginning of the year. He wouldn't have been surprised if they had been amongst the handful of people bold enough to shoot a stinging hex at him throughout the first month. They were cunning enough, though, not to get caught.
Harry groaned again, placing his pillow on top of his head in an attempt to block out the light coming from the huge windows. "Oh, I'm sure 'Mione will kill you," he mumbled, blindly pointing in the direction of where he thought he had last seen his best mate, "but not only for being late, though."
"Oh, get a room you two!" Theo exclaimed, an annoyed look visible in his dark eyes. "I have to see enough of that as it is."
He felt Luna nod her head too. "I'm glad", she said, "It will help you, Harry. You will see."
Someone was trying to make their way through.
"George I-"
Draco was wearing the same thing as him. Relief flooded Harry at that thought. Perhaps he wasn’t that stupid after all.
“Ssshhhtttt…”
"Hey, mate?" Ron asked from beside Hermione, his fork pointing to an untouched piece of roasted chicken on Harry's plate. "Are you still going to eat that?"
His whole body was trembling like a leaf by now; every muscle in his body tensing painfully. He knew what was happening. He had been here before. He was standing on the Hogwarts grounds as people were fighting or fleeing around him, dropping dead as the killing curse - shot by one of the many cloaked figures - hit them unexpectedly.
, then. A disturbance in the wards.
"Let's go inside then", Terry Boot announced. "I'm starving."
Dean looked up at his boyfriend, a lone tear streaming down his flushed cheeks.
Maybe he could start on his pile of homework? He could go to the library after his daily steaming hot cuppa of Earl Grey tea from the kitchens. Maybe his headache would have lessened by then?
Harry's head snapped up from where he had been staring at the ground at the sound of the very familiar voice. Even in his sleep he couldn't mistake the voice of the girl he once loved with all his heart. The girl he now saw as his own sister, one of his best friends.
It had been a long day.
Maybe someday Harry will end like that too. Maybe someday the fire of his horrible thoughts will destroy him too as they burn inside him, consuming him ever so slowly. Only his 'ashes' will remain. Small pieces of himself that could easily be blown away by the smallest bits of wind.
Shrugging, Malfoy ran a hand through his gel-less hair. "I don't know... Everything? For the way I've acted over the years, for what happened last year. Hell, even for the incident in the corridor earlier."
"No, wait!" Harry said, reaching out and grabbing Malfoy's slim wrist to hold him back.
Two years after the start of his house arrest, he had sent a letter to Harry. He had felt he owed the man at least an apology, though he knew nothing could ever justify the awful things he had done.
Draco had taught him the little phrase. And it was only after rehearsing for what felt like a thousand times, that Harry could finally pronounce it the correct way.
"What?!" Ron spluttered indignantly. "How can you say that, Harry! He's a bloody Slytherin!"
Next to him, Draco suddenly sat up, a bright smile lighting up his whole face. “Hey Teddy?”, he asked the boy as he scrambled off the bed. “Remember I told you I had bad
they had disappeared, Harry didn't even
But Draco was too busy with what was happening to really care about his precious broom. The group had taken yet another step closer, almost completely surrounding him now. He found himself with his back already pressed against the wall, his wand uselessly dangling from his fingers.
“I’ll see you soon, my dragon.”
Eventually the feast ended and prefects started to lead the students of their houses to their common rooms. The Eighth Years stayed behind, waiting for Headmistress McGonagall to show them their own common room.
evening.”
"Of course," Draco said - far too happily for Harry's liking - before
his mother in telling the Wizengamot how they had saved his life multiple times during the war. If it hadn't been for his testimony, Draco was sure they wouldn't have been let off so easily.
It was a simple question. A question many people ask each other on a daily basis. Yet Harry thought it one of the hardest questions in the world. It was easy to lie and tell the other person you had been doing fairly well and most of the times when people asked him that question he would do just that. He would smile and lie to them, saying he was fine before turning the attention away from him.
Running a hand through his hair, Harry turned to look at the campfire. He thought he could faintly see a pair of silver eyes glancing at him from the other side, but when he took a closer look it was already gone, as if it had never been there in the first place.
Shaking his head, amused, Draco turned around in Harry’s embrace. “It’s almost time”, he whispered.
find him. The wards around the house were pretty hard to cross, if he said so himself.
"Potter..."
From that moment, Draco had known he wouldn't actually mind being married to a strong minded woman like Astoria. She might have actually been one of the few good things his father had even done for him.
Slytherins are as bad as you say them to be."
There hung a heavy feeling in the air around the Eighth Years. A heavy feeling that came with the weight of returning to this very place. The weight of having to fight in a war. The weight of seeing people die in front of you. The weight of losing too many loved ones.
The sound of footsteps returned and soon he found a pair of arms wrapping themselves around his waist, a solid chest pressing against his back and a head resting on his shoulder.
Draco shrugged, a smirk appearing on his face. "Lost track of time, I guess", he lied easily, his smirk widening. "Why do you ask? Disappointed you couldn't see me win against you?" He tilted his head, mocking playfully.
"What made you leave so suddenly, Mr. Potter?"
Harry couldn't help the chuckle that escaped his mouth at the blond's dramatic antics, amusement visible in his eyes, despite the still very present headache. "Yeah, I noticed."
"I guessed you hadn't really eaten anything so I brought you this -" she handed him the food "- this way 'Mione won't kill you - or me for that matter - when she finds out you haven't eaten anything today."
"You may also leave the school grounds on the weekends if you want to and there will be
Draco squeezed Harry's hand again, letting go of the other and placing a finger under his chin so Harry was forced to look at him. Their faces were only a few inches apart. "You don't have to lie to me, Harry", he whispered, his minty breath ghosting over Harry's lips, "I don't want you to lie to me."
"Thanks, 'Mione", Harry muttered, burying his face in the soft, brown curls of his friend.
The students nodded in greeting to the lady in the portrait, smiling politely.
"Treacle tarts", Harry whispered softly, a smile grazing his lips.
He didn't want that. He had been called a freak more than enough to last him a life time and he didn't think having to relive that would help him any further...
