"Here we are," Malfoy said, dropping the book back onto the desk. He bent over, searching the text for something. "Catalysts are right here."
is, Harry knows it’s Hermione that has a more solid head on her shoulders. After nearly a decade of being in constant awe of her, he’s learned to take her seriously when she gets so riled up about a suggestion. Whenever Hermione has what is seen as a crazy idea, there’s a very good chance that it’s actually the right course of action.
“What sort of acting out has been occurring? Tantrums, hiding, refusing to eat? Anything of extreme concern?”
“Oh, there are loads that can’t be,” Tom says, leaning on the bar and fixing Draco with a fierce look. “But you’re not one of ‘em. You’re just a boy. Just an unfortunate product of your raisin’.”
Madam Pomfrey was fussing. Draco had been awake for nearly two hours. He had eaten everything on the tray she had brought him, drank every drop of the potion she gave him, answered every question she had asked him, and performed every strange task she had requested. He had felt particularly foolish when she had asked him to hop on one foot, but Draco had done it. Anything to be released to the privacy of his own room.
"Nothing is impossible, you know," she said, and she nodded toward the ground at their feet. Draco looked down and gave a choking laugh.
It was as though the chains of his past had finally been torn from his heart. A cool calm had spread through Draco, beginning in his chest as he had read with much relief that his mother was safe and slithering through the rest of his body like a liquid wildfire as the full impact of her words hit him. She was safe. She was happy. She wanted him to be, as well.
But Draco cut him off, grabbing Harry by the hand and dragging him through and away from the party. Harry let himself be led to the darkness of the far side of Mr. Weasley's shed. Draco released his hand when they were out of sight from the lights and eyes of the reception, its sounds drifting over them as though through a filter, soft and vague. Draco took a deep breath, eyes not meeting Harry's right away.
“Noted. I’m still going to start the process, open up that conversation this week, see how it goes.”
Harry withdrew the hand that had been holding Draco's cheek and trailed his fingers down Draco's neck, halting briefly to tickle the exposed nipple on Draco's chest as he continued downward. Draco gasped slightly, rolling his head back with pleasure and only fueling Harry's boldness. As Harry dipped to nibble at the skin that blended Draco's neck and shoulder, he let his hand continue to wander down Draco's chest and stomach. His index finger cautiously slipped into Draco's waistband.
"Then..." Harry checked his watch. "That has to be a record-fast breakfast you just ate. Did you even taste it?"
Draco growls, bumping into Harry for the fifth time in ten minutes. “You’re not helping, so just sit down.”
Potter raised his wand, but Draco was somehow quicker. He reached out and grabbed Potter's wrist, stopping him from whatever spell he was about to cast. Potter's eyes turned to meet his, anger dancing there and making Draco's breath catch even more.
Charlie raised his brows at Harry, who only shrugged sheepishly in return, not knowing what to say. Reluctantly, he turned his eyes back to Ginny, but she had taken to glaring at her plate, hands firmly in her lap.
“At this time, most of the policies for Azkaban, its prisoners, and the upcoming trainings have been signed off on, which I will be going over in detail in just a moment for this meeting. They are quite straightforward. As for the whole of the new subdepartment I mentioned, I believe administration is hoping for more of a concrete framework in place by summer’s end. The ideal is to start accepting a fresh wave of Azkaban-Auror hopefuls into the first class of training at the conclusion of the calendar year.”
Mr. Weasley shot his son a stern look. "Not everyone in Azkaban is a Death Eater, nor is everyone there meant to stay for life. But it's the Death Eaters that are the cause for the violence. There've been two murders that I know of, and I'm nowhere near the department. I dare say the Aurors are up to their ears in policy adaptations and paperwork."
Potter, sicking a skinny little Ravenclaw to act as his bodyguard. Technically, Draco could believe it, but the audacity of it was utterly mortifying. He downed the rest of his cup and set it on the table hard.
To his pleasure, Harry saw Malfoy sitting there, taking small bites of toast. It had taken a little bit of begging in the library after Herbology one day, but it seemed that Harry had finally convinced Malfoy to eat something at least once a day. Harry was sure Malfoy hadn't meant to let slip that he only ate once every few days and seemed to only agree to keep Harry from nagging anymore. But as Harry watched Malfoy eating for the third breakfast in a row, he felt satisfied that maybe the Slytherin had actually listened to him.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. He had learned to take things as they came from the moment he had entered the wizarding world. There wasn't any reason to change that now.
With a frustrated sigh, Draco collapses onto his large new sofa, easily twice the size of a typical loveseat, and breathes in its new-fabric smell. Nearly everything in Draco’s new flat smells new, with a hint of cardboard and paper and plastic. Quite different from the refreshing scents of polished familiarity of Malfoy Manor, hardly a scent at all.
Draco rocked back and forth between Harry's fingers and the hand on his cock, nails digging through the skin of Harry's back. It was thrilling, watching Draco come completely undone on him, and Harry nearly climaxed on the spot when a hand suddenly wrapped around his own cock. Draco's lips fell to Harry's neck, sucking at the skin below his ear.
"I didn't sick anyone on you, you git!" Only a few feet separated them, but Potter took a step closer as his voice rose to match Draco's. "And whether you like it or not, I do worry! And it's a damn good thing I did, too, or else you would've died on the floor Friday!"
Hermione sighed. "Yes, then, I suppose technically. I'm just saying that...I don't think this has as much to do with you as you think."
"Not as loud, I'll give you, but I bet he's still the same spoiled, conniving piece of work he's always been."
"Don't give me that look, you know I'd have backed you up if you'd have just waited two minutes for me to get there."
"It's okay to ask questions." Luna looked up from her search and smiled at him. "Friends are allowed to ask questions."
Harry’s brows rise as Planters speaks, surprised. The Ministry has always taken ages doing anything it already knows how to do. To set in motion a brand new program on the scale that it must have to be for refurbishing Azkaban with specially-trained guards...Harry would have expected another year or more before hearing of any substantial change.
"What? Why?" Harry asked, annoyed. "Why is everyone telling me to leave him alone when he clearly needs some help?"
“Toy!” Teddy suddenly squeals, turning to race into the little bedroom he and Harry share. Harry hopes it’s to do as he asked.
"No one gave you the right!" Draco shouted. His anger was growing rapidly, distantly surprising him. "You have no right to worry over me and sick your fanclub after me!"
A humid breeze licks at his face. Did Tom walk him to the door? The barman is nowhere to be seen, though, and the road appears empty enough for Draco to stumble across it safely. Stagnant air, pressing tight against him, then warmth. Draco hears a disembodied and husky voice coming from somewhere in the bizarre mix of colors in front of him.
"Oh, just wonderful!" She nodded at Malfoy. "Draco was just helping me look for a book I cannot seem to find."
"It's not just me." Malfoy's eyes lost their angry edge the moment the words left his mouth, which stayed open slightly as though forgotten in his confusion. He took a small step back, looking vaguely alarmed.
Frowning, Draco looks back up, finds Potter determinedly not looking at him. Teddy glances between the two a few times. His eyes are still wide, lips still drawn tight. There’s tension all over his tiny body. Much as Draco wants to rush across the space and embrace Teddy with all he has, he stays still. He’s not about to force Teddy to do something that adds to his fright and upset.
Teeth clenching with the force to crack them, Draco exhales sharply through his nose. Chase isn’t wrong; Draco has never wanted his hatred for the beloved Boy Who Lived to be psychoanalyzed beyond repair. But things with Potter are changing. Novel civility aside, he and Potter are loosely wound together for the next year and change, and Chase knows it. It makes sense that the healer would want to revisit the topic at a new angle, try to worm into Draco's psyche however he can.
As if to emphasize her point, Karen fell back into her armchair and kicked her feet up onto the armrest. A few onlookers laughed, and quiet conversations began to replace the sticky silence. Pansy continued to glare at Draco, her face much too close to his despite there being easily three feet of space between them. He could only breathe in her perfume for a few more moments before having to finally turn his face away.
"Today we will have a quiz, and the half of the class with the highest marks will be given a sample of those Bliss Potions without the veritaserum and enjoy what is called fantastical bliss. The half of the class with the lower marks will be given a sample of the potions with the veritaserum and will subsequently experience a factual bliss. Now, can anyone enlighten us as to the difference?"
“Just give it a rest, then,” Harry says, chuckling at the completely deranged look in Draco’s eyes. “It’s only been a couple days. Maybe he’s just not ready.”
it was him, how he had quivered when Ron started to shout. Anger bubbled in Harry's stomach, but he forced himself to try and relax. He didn't want to be worked up when he found Malfoy. He wanted to be calm so that he could best explain to Malfoy how far from the truth Ron's words were.
Malfoy narrows his eyes. “Mark my words, Potter. Your tendency to put people aside for your own selfish goals will show up before long with Teddy, and I will be patiently waiting to catch him.”
"Well, come one, then, Draco," his mother said, leading the way up the front steps and knocking confidently on the wreathed door.
But, scarce as the customers were compared to the norm, Draco still felt eyes on him as he followed Potter into the pub. Potter was removing his hat, scarf, and mittens as he walked, but Draco kept his on, not wanting to draw even more attention to himself.
Draco groans harsh, runs a hand over his face. “That’s all well and good for now, but do you intend on using bribery forever just to have him properly use the toilet?”
"Well," Malfoy said, turning back to the desk to clear away their ingredient scraps. "Oils obviously have smoothing and softening properties, but it's the small stature and delicacy of the creatures we used that'll give this potion the...ah...punch," For some reason, Malfoy flinched. "it needs."
Draco runs a hand through his hair as he sits up. Yes, the laws are entirely against him. He’ll have to play by all the rules. Sure, he hasn’t achieved large goals without waltzing over the line of the law probably ever. Sure, his opponent is the most prized wizard in the world. Sure, his own reputation, his blood-stained past, is going to be working overtime against him. But if it means getting Teddy back, Draco can follow the rules. He can play nice.
Keeping his hands warm in his pockets, Harry nudged Draco with his elbow. "Well, now you've met him. Cute little thing, right?"
Professor Slughorn had only just risen from his desk when Harry quietly entered the dungeons. The squat wizard grinned at him, winking as though they were old friends, and gestured for Harry to find a seat.
"I think it's about time for a nap," Andromeda said as the cries grew steadily louder. "I'll make him a bottle and lie him down."
The two of them scowl at one another for several seconds, glowering furiously, and Draco swears he sees Potter’s wand hand twitch toward his pocket. But the moment passes, and Draco huffs, grinning. It doesn’t matter that Potter’s stubbornness is only allowing him to agree to a single day for now. There’s no way even empty-headed Harry Potter won’t see how much Draco watching Teddy is going to benefit the boy. It’ll just take some time.
Harry sighs. Things are difficult enough without having to worry about Teddy behaving appropriately. Although only the second one, the Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance Ceremonies are among the hardest things Harry has to endure lately. Being back at Hogwarts, seeing the castle even at a distance, smelling the grounds, catching glimpses of the lake, the Quidditch pitch, seeing the Forbidden Forest surrounding them...ghostly impressions of the destruction that took over the place overlay the happy memories that fight to the surface of his thoughts. Dark creatures growl underfoot as he plays his first game of Quidditch, curses soar overhead at a holiday feast, lifeless bodies lie in the snow of a fourth-year snowball fight-
"But Malfoy kind of turned that around. Even before you guys were talking and I...well, before I really noticed it, I could tell that something about being back here was bringing you out of the cloud you had over you all summer. I thought it was just being back at Hogwarts, but I think it was something about Malfoy all along."
But when Teddy reached for something just beyond Harry's shoulder and was unable to snag it, his face screwed up tightly and he let out a very unhappy wail.
It wasn't even just homework that Draco's bed ruined for him. Nightmares of his mother's face in Azkaban kept him awake enough, but the mere feel of his bed beneath him brought images and sensations too wonderful not to be painful. Between the two, Draco's sleep had reached an all-time low, rendering him useless in his lessons and the perfect target for anyone that still hated him.
Teddy giggles as Harry sets him down, feet already in running motion before they hit the floor. Harry laughs at the sight, but it fades fairly quickly when Teddy races from the room and he can feel Malfoy’s eyes on his back. He turns.
“Happy Monday, Mr. Malfoy,” Tom rasps. He’s already pouring Draco’s preferred wine by the time he reaches the bar. “Alright tonight?”
"Now that the swelling has gone down, you ought to feel right as rain in a couple hours' time. I took care of the cuts and the bruising for you." She tutted. "No boy should be as bruised as you were. But it's gone now, save for maybe some soreness without color. But that, too, should be gone in a few hours. I'm happy to keep you longer if you'd like, but should you wish, you can return to your lessons on Monday."
"Besides," Ron interjected around a mouthful of sausage, "it's not like it's weird for students to pick at each other in the corridors. Remember when Malfoy made me burp up slugs for a whole day?"
Harry held fast, only allowing their lips to graze. "It's good to hear. Real character development."
“I mean,” Potter begins after several seconds, “that’s- but I’m gone five days a week, eight hour a day minimum. It’s a-”
“Well,” Ms. Dribble plows on, “since you’ll likely be legally free of one another once Mr. Potter graduates, it might be better in the long term to simply stay put if the arrangement is working alright. I suspect, Mr. Potter, that you’ll be wanting your own space when that time comes and you have more means for proper child care, hm?”
The Three Broomsticks wasn't nearly as busy as Draco had expected it would be. With the freezing cold, he had thought the pub would be packed with villagers and students alike trying to keep warm. But as the windows rattled violently against the oncoming storm, Draco remembered that most of the students had chosen to stay at the castle that trip and that the villagers likely would have done the same in their homes.
“Are you having trouble with money?” Harry asks bluntly. Unease weaves into the acids of his stomach.
He hadn't found him, though. Harry sighed as he neared the top of the tower. He had looked absolutely everywhere he could think, but Malfoy was apparently far faster than he looked, having made it to the castle before Harry could catch him and disappearing into the safe depths of the Slytherin dungeon.
Draco glances at Harry, looking as though he wants to both laugh and sneer. Somehow, he’s able to convey the combination pretty well. Harry rolls his eyes, unwrapping the tortillas for he and Teddy to start steaming them. Throughout the following hour, Draco manages to thin the sauce to quiet his own fretting, and Harry allows Teddy to make an enormous mess helping them stuff, roll, and align the enchiladas in a baking dish before literally dumping a bag of cheese over the entire thing, much to both Harry’s and Draco’s exasperation. Finally, though, the three sit down to eat.
Icy relief spikes unevenly from Harry’s center. It rushes in spurts through his veins, jarringly kind.
Facing away from Malfoy, Harry can’t be too sure how his comment is received in the quiet that follows. He isn’t even sure if he cares. Even when Malfoy’s bedroom door latches a minute later, Harry can only care to try and settle himself. What is Malfoy’s
Draco stops there, sure that the long list of influential witches and wizards that follow is an impressive one. His breath is caught, though, burning his chest as his lungs struggle against the pathetic miscommunications that Draco’s body seems to be having.
Pulling on a shirt as he steps into the living room, Draco stops in the tiny hall space when he notices that Teddy’s door is wide open. It’s always only cracked. But surely if the boy’s awake, Draco would hear him, see him somewhere? He glances around, stepping further inward, and spots the sandy brown hair, tucked into the blankets and pressed against the black disaster on the pillow.
"Well, you didn't seem the type to me, either. I don't really think it's something you can tell just by looking at a person."
Harry takes care of Teddy, carrying him by the arm to the bathroom and wrestling him out of his wet clothes and into the tub for a rinse, then stuffing him into a fresh pair of shorts and a shirt. As if a switch has been flipped, Teddy’s screams cease. He wraps both arms around Harry’s legs, planting sloppy kisses to his knees before scurrying off to his toys.
"Please stop," Malfoy breathed, his quavering voice so soft that Harry wasn't entirely sure he had actually spoken.
Being so late and walking off the high of what had happened in the broom closet, when Draco and Harry crept into the Gryffindor seventh year dormitory they had both been exhausted. They hadn't exchanged a word, silently stripping down to undershirts and changing into pajama pants, Harry wordlessly offering a pair to Draco, before climbing into the bed. Harry had taken the time to Freeze the curtains again, though Draco had sleepily wondered if it was necessary. He didn't know the details of what had happened in the Three Broomsticks after he had left, but Draco was sure that Harry and Weasley had a rather nasty row. It didn't seem likely that Weasley would bother them as he had before.
It’s not his. Draco stares at the back of it, adrenaline making him a bit stupid, before realizing that Teddy must be awake. He throws back the covers, opens his door a fraction to peer into the living room.
Harry leans down closer to Teddy so he can be heard. “You’re getting a bath in five minutes, so get it out now. I’ll be back.”
The class broke up then, collecting ingredients and starting their fires. Harry and Malfoy, much as the other pairs, had fallen into an easy rhythm with their own roles. Harry did most of the cutting, grinding, juicing, and skinning of ingredients while Malfoy tended to the actual potion. Overall, it made for better grades.
Laughing, Harry moves towards Ron’s old bedroom window, looking down on the garden, where Ron and Hermione’s wedding will be taking place in less than an hour. It’s almost identical to Bill and Fleur’s decor, at least from what Harry can remember, except that Hermione specifically requested the event be free of canopies. Something about wanting to see the setting sunlight, the summer stars.
Draco wanted to say something, maybe something cutting as he would in the past, maybe something akin to begging Potter to just leave him be, but all that came out was a strangled whine. His entire body shook as he tried to breathe, and he finally just shook his head. His heart was pounding, threatening to burst from his chest.
Teddy’s weight is gone. The world is quiet but for distant singing, deep and melodic and stirring something behind Draco’s closed eyes. He quite likes the singing. He can listen to it forever. Or at least until he falls asleep.
Harry glanced around. The N.E.W.T. level Potions class held the fewest students of all his lessons, and the students had clumped together at six desks arranged into three tables. Ron and Hermione sat at one desk pressed with Ernie Macmillan and another Hufflepuff Harry was sure hadn't been in the class his sixth year; four Ravenclaws sat together at another table; and at the last table sat Draco Malfoy, entirely alone and eyes downcast. Harry quietly dropped into the seat beside him.
When the tea was all gone and only a couple sandwiches remained, Harry and Draco were stretched out on their stomachs on the floor, letting Teddy crawl all over and in between them. He was far more active than the last time Harry had seen him, when Teddy wasn't yet five months old and seemed to specialize in staring. Now he was less baby and more toddler, moving and trying to walk and grabbing at absolutely everything within reach. Such a happy baby, Harry thought as Teddy grinned up at him.
Hermione is struggling to reach him through the thick throng of workers pushing in the opposite direction. Hardly any taller than their time at Hogwarts, Hermione’s bushy hair is lost among the crowd for a moment as Harry slows to wait for her.
"Most, yeah. Headquarters was at Sirius' old house. My godfather," he clarified at the mild confusion on Draco's face. "So I was able to see most of the Order there. But once Lupin and Tonks had Teddy, he found me back at the old house and asked me to be godfather. Downright terrifying at the time."
"It's a load of rubbish, honestly, but it talked a lot about Narcissa Malfoy and what the Ministry might do to her
A small hand fell on his arm, and Draco opened his eyes to find Luna standing right beside him, a bright smile filling her face. His queasiness increased.
The rest of the hour is a blur. The kitchen is such a disaster that Harry decides to leave it for last, instead tackling the living area and bedroom to make sure everything is put where it belongs or mostly so and cleaned as best he can. With only twenty minutes left to do so, Harry returns to the kitchen to set the dishes to wash themselves while he tidies up the clutter by hand.
When it came time to unload, Hermione led the way, taking Ron's hand and nodding to Harry to follow. Had he not been grateful for the support, Harry may have been annoyed at being silently ordered around. But when Luna took his arm in hers a moment later and began to skip up the stairs, all negative feelings melted away. If Luna Lovegood could be smiling after spending months on end locked in a dark cellar, Harry had little room to brood.
“Well, I think Teddy’s settling in better now. I know I am, and I think that’s helping.” Harry adjusts Teddy as he twists, trying to somehow sink even deeper into Harry’s chest, into his lap. “He’s sleeping better. He’s eating a little better.”
Weasley nodded. "I, Ronald Weasley, am apologizing to you, Draco Malfoy, for implying that you are better off dead. I've never wanted nor wished that you'd die or off yourself or anything of the sort. I am just an arse and say horrible things when I am angry and uncomfortable."
"Still am." Harry stopped and grabbed Draco's hand then, having him look him in the eye before they reached the store. "How've things been? Your letter was awfully short."
Ms. Dribble offers Draco a smirk. Staring back, he awards the old witch a thin smile, still irritated. Mr. Cook stands, and Draco and Harry follow suit. Teddy slithers himself to the floor, climbs back on the couch.
The rush from the Burrow to King's Cross had been noticeably less stressful than in previous years, leaving them all at least twenty minutes to say good-bye before the train was set to leave. Mrs. Weasley had finally released the tears that had threatened to fall for weeks, sobbing openly into each of their chests in turn as she said her farewells to Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Mr. Weasley had firmly shaken Harry's and Ron's hands, as had Charlie, and embraced his daughter tightly. It had been emotional, and Ron had fretfully tried to ease his mother's tears by reminding her that all the danger had passed, that they would all be back for Christmas before she knew it. It had seemed to help as they boarded, but Harry saw Mrs. Weasley dissolve into tears again from the train window.
"Mr. Tuft, Mr. Martinez, Miss Campbell, Mr. Potter, and Mr. Weasley, you all will be on my left." Slughorn dropped the pile of parchment on his desk and rubbed his hands together. "Alright, now let's see how well you all brewed up some bliss, shall we?"
Potter was looking right back at him, and it took a lot in Draco not to look away. In the past, he would have glared or made a face, but now he simply stared back. After a few moments, Potter's lips twitched into the smallest of smiles before returning to his conversation with Longbottom. Draco watched Potter a moment more before he realized that Weasley's eyes were on him. Draco did drop his gaze then, not wanting to see the justified hate there.
Harry saw Ron roll his eyes, and Hermione looked slightly put off at the thought that their first Potions lesson being too easy. Without moving his head, Harry glanced at Malfoy.
But that second voice, that sweet milk chocolate in Draco’s ears, isn’t deterred by the first voice’s alarm. “Daco back!”
It was a fascinating dream, Draco thought as the breeze stilled around him. Somewhere, a clock struck four in the morning, but he didn't move.
Potter raised his brows but nodded. "I suppose you're right. That was a bit of a nightmare waking up, wasn't it? Nearly wet myself."
"It's...it's not..." Draco's voice was only a raspy whisper, slipping out between gasps for air. He knew he was beginning to shake harder and he withdrew his hand. "Don't. Please. Not...not for me."
Chase waves a hand, always a little wild in his enthusiasm. “Harry Potter’s status is not what will make him a good parenting partner-”
"Okay, so slicing him up for not answering you, that makes sense," Neville said, dark sarcasm in his voice.
Malfoy stuttered out a shaky scoff and nodded at a spot over Harry's shoulder. Harry turned and saw the nearby Ravenclaw table, all four taking notes. But after a second of watching, Harry saw it. Every so often, one or more of them would glance his and Malfoy's way, then whisper to their desk partner, looking suspicious. It wasn't hard to guess what it meant.
Harry snorts to himself, imagining. Actually living together would probably land them both in St. Mungo’s or Azkaban. Harry shakes his head, mindlessly helps himself to the fridge on impulse.
“But as both of you are very eager to keep Teddy out of the adoption system, Kara and I are quite confident that neither of you will try to step out of the bounds should you both agree and sign.
“Yes,” he repeats. “I don’t raise my voice with Teddy if I can help it, and I try not to have him feel blamed for things that are truly just an accident. I don’t usually turn him down when he asks for interaction...I like to think it’s helped foster some healthy independence. At the very least, I’m sure Teddy trusts me to be there for him.
She peeks at the notes Mr. Cook is perusing, nodding at something there. “Well, the flat is in excellent shape, and the location is perfect for wanting to be outdoors with a magical child. Lots of space buffer you have out there. When is your lease up, Mr. Malfoy?”
Professor Sprout looked as though she was about to say something, then seemed to think better of it and turned to face the blackboard.
"Come on, Malfoy, I'm not actually an idiot." Harry said it specifically to try and goad Malfoy into maybe throwing the word back at him as an insult, but Malfoy only gulped and turned his back to Harry.
"Well, his wife and son were acquitted entirely," Mr. Weasley said, glancing briefly at Harry. "But Lucius was sentenced to...I think it was around five years in Azkaban for his crimes, as well as having to pay an enormous fine for personally housing Voldemort, his followers, and his...Dark activities." Mr. Weasley sighed, reaching to pull a piece of chocolate cake onto his plate. "But, regardless, Lucius was ambushed by some Death Eaters that apparently found it important to...well."
But, for all his supposed Gryffindor bravery, Harry had yet to tell her. Instead, Harry had taken to avoiding her at all costs, hastily crafting excuses to leave whenever he did happen to befall her company. Hurt swam in her eyes each time. It tore at Harry when he was alone, yet he continued to do nothing.
He grabbed Harry by the front of his robes and pulled him in, smashing their lips together in a kiss that seared Draco down to his very soul.
Despite his untouched love for his mother, Draco still couldn't bring himself to face her for more than a few minutes at a time since they returned home and especially since his father's murder. Draco couldn't fake the sorrow that so gripped his mother, even for her. She didn't deserve to grieve alone, yet Draco couldn't provide that company for her. Even after all she had done for him. It tore at him every time he escaped her.
“And I’d be understanding of that if you haven’t been refusing to talk about him since before all this with Teddy.”
Teddy doesn’t respond right away. He opts to continue stacking the blocks before him, face neutral. It adds to Harry’s mounting stress. He doesn’t want to rush Teddy and upset him and cause a meltdown just before their appointment. He also
Rushing over, Harry didn't even think. He lunged forward and punched Josh, who stood nearest Malfoy, directly in the face. The younger boy stumbled back several steps but didn't otherwise react.
“No, definitely not,” Harry says, leaning forward. “Actually, we both talked about that specifically even before we agreed to room together. We...well, I’d say we’re getting on great all things considered.”
He rubbed his eyes as he made his way up to the library alone. Hermione had been quite excited by the idea of kicking off their weekend doing homework, but Ron's begging not to skip two meals in one day had her begrudgingly waving goodbye to Harry as they parted ways, leaving him to trek through the castle alone. Homework was the furthest thing from his mind these days, but as he had already neglected the mountain that had accumulated thus far, he figured he ought to try and make a dent in it before his marks began to suffer.
Are manners so foreign coming from Draco that it warrants such a look over a simple ‘please?’ He downs the Firewhiskey in one gulp.
Harry started, but it was just Ron returning from the storeroom himself with an armload of ingredients.
With a last glare at Josh, Hermione stepped over and crouched down beside Harry. Her mouth fell open at Malfoy's face. Every bit of skin from his scalp to the base of his neck was covered in a deep purple and black bruise.
A door opened somewhere over their heads and Draco tilted his head back to see the look on his mother's and aunt's faces when they saw him with Teddy. He hoped it would make his mother smile, maybe ease some of the worry he knew Andromeda was likely still feeling.
"Here we are!" Andromeda relieved Teddy from Harry's arms, popping a bottle in the little mouth and silencing the screams. "Last bottle until I can get to the store, Teddy, so drink it up."
His room couldn't come fast enough, and as Draco gathered his things to take the bath he did truly want to take, he fought to breathe normally through his constricting chest. His mother was right, of course. To no longer be Harry's enemy was one thing, a good thing. To become too friendly with him, to take things as far as he already had with Harry was another thing entirely. Hope for it not to completely blow up in his face was wishful thinking at best. As the large bath filled with steaming water, Draco glared sadly at himself in the mirror.
They ate quietly for a few minutes before Draco asked, "So...how have you been? What have you been doing all this time? Your letters didn't really say."
"The first mature tail feather of an exotic creature called a Skeleton Parrot. They bring good fortune. I've carried it with me most of term, which is why I suspect so few people have been as cruel to me as in the past, but I think your troubles with Draco are in some need, don't you?"
No, Harry still loved Draco and didn't see that changing anytime soon. He was just at a horrible, complete, and total loss as to what he could do.
Fingers fumbling blindly, Harry finally felt the round plastic of a button and began to undo Draco's shirt. "Well, you should at least wear something without blasted buttons."
Draco's chest constricted at the sound of Weasley's voice, a stark reminder of the last time he had really heard it, lying in Potter's bed.
"Eh, you're an adult now," Aberforth had growled after Harry just stared at him for a long time once ordering. "You want to drown your sorrows, be my guest."
“Oh, your stupidity is only matched by your ignorance, Potter! I will not-” Draco shifts and feels Potter’s arm still bracing him against the wall. “Get off me.”
Gray eyes met green, and it was only then that Harry became overly aware of how close they were. Mere inches separated their faces. He could feel Malfoy's stuttering breath hitting his lips as they stared at one another for several moments.
He fell forward and smacked the wall to catch himself, sending an echoing slap reverberating up the tower.
. The world around them didn't seem to exist, though Draco knew part of that was due to how close to fainting he was. It was just Harry and him, feet and legs freezing in the snow as Draco forced himself to breathe as deeply as he could, shaking with every inhale.
"No one else's opinion matters. You're in control of your own happiness, you know. Aren't...aren't you miserable now?"
"Hey hey hey, whoa," Harry interrupted. Draco chanced a look and found Harry was shaking his head. "Look...I get it. Kind of. I can understand, at least. But Draco...this isn't some sick joke. Gryffindors hardly have the patience or acting skills to pull off something so elaborate, especially me.
Around his own mouthful of food, Draco grumbles something too quiet to hear, but Harry can see the tightening in his cheeks, trying to hold back his own satisfaction to save some mental sort of face.
Fresh shrieks wash over him as Teddy’s sobs regain volume. Tears are streaming down his chubby cheeks and his body quakes with each hiccup. Harry hugs him hard.
Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding and smiled bracingly. "It's alright. The point is, I do get it, wanting to avoid everyone looking and talking. Although I never thought to duck in here to hide."
He sounds quite genuine, Draco thinks, impressed. Ms. Dribble’s harsh laugh cuts through the room then, right in Draco’s ear and startling him enough to make Teddy jump. The witch has no business being so sneaky.
Harry comes over, peers down at the recipe Draco has propped against the wall. It doesn’t seem terribly complicated, but the sauce in the pan is slightly thicker than the directions describe.
Hermione sat down in the empty seat beside Harry, eyeing him worriedly as she reached to finish buttering the toast he had abandoned.
Draco chuckles, imagining it. Teddy’s not particularly large for his age, but he can be fierce when determined to accomplish something.
“Well, while Kara takes the tour,” Mr. Cook says mildly, “I can check in with you two. First and foremost, how are you doing, Teddy?”
"Nobody is going to love me while I'm here at Hogwarts," he said softly, feeling the truth in his words. Potter's green eyes flashed in his mind, though, bright and close, stirring something painful in Draco's chest.
In the same moment, Draco and Potter move forward to offer comfort. But Teddy flinches so harshly away from Draco that he smacks into the door frame. His lips quiver. He hurries into Potter’s open arms, buries his face into his chest.
Weasley glared back as he, too, stood and drew his wand. "Which part? The part about you being a fame-hungry prat or the part about how worthless of a piece of rubbish Malfoy is?"
But with little choice, Harry removed his own cloak, robes, and shoes, stripping down to just as much clothing as he had left on Malfoy, and slipped under the blankets and into the bed.
Draco did, his lungs protesting at the air trapped there, but upon releasing, Draco's vision cleared considerably. He could see the dark fabric of Harry's cloak in front of him, his pink face just inches from his own.
With another shrug, Draco tosses a carrot stick in his mouth and turns toward his bedroom. He waves a hand over his shoulder. “Please,” he says, and it sounds close to a sneer without being quite so...sneering. “I’m just better at being the bad guy than you are.”
But still, Draco's heart fluttered happily as he relived Harry telling him that he loved Draco not just once but twice. When the train had stopped and Hermione and Weasley had left them alone for a moment, Harry had grabbed Draco's hand and pressed a quick peck to his cheek.
No more parks for a while. Teddy will just have to settle for the times they enjoy the grassy meadows outside their flat with just Harry and Draco for company until he’s older.
"Draco, stop reading that rubbish," Harry whispered. He wasn't taking any better notes than Draco was, though he had gone as far as to pull out the right materials. "It's just a bunch of gossip. Nothing to worry over."
Teddy doesn’t say anything, and after a few moments go by, Draco wonders if perhaps the two have fallen asleep. He’s turning toward his bed when he hears Teddy’s whisper.
"No, Harry, you don't understand," Draco said, cutting him off. He gulped and reached into his pocket, then dropped onto one knee in front of Harry.
It should have stirred some alarm, some anxiety, some emotion besides joy in Draco's heart to hear Weasley proclaiming that he was about to offer his formal apologies. But the fog of bliss protected his heart and his lungs, keeping him breathing evenly as he simply beamed at Weasley.
“To be honest, he only got into trouble when he was grown. Can’t really spank an adult.” Mrs. Weasley checks her watch, then leans to give Harry’s cheek a gentle kiss. “You really are doing quite well. Just keep doing your best and things will be alright. For now, I need to make sure things downstairs are ready. We’re going to get started in about half an hour, just so you know, Best Man.”
As though stepping into the beginnings of a fog, Draco smiled back. They stared at one another, and Draco was struck full force with how absolutely beautiful Harry's eyes were. Bright, vivid green as though they were created from every gorgeous meadow described in poetry and a distinctive almond shape that bordered on exotic. The deep bags that hung below no longer were a sign of deprivation but a battle scar of Harry's strength, and Draco forgot the world as he suddenly reached out and took Harry's hand in his own.
Either the Ravenclaw was, in fact, too young to hold the spell for long or she simply had finished with her fun, but the spell was lifted rather abruptly and Draco crashed to the ground in a heap. His head hit first, filling his vision with stars. Small feet kicked at him, nothing compared to the angry pain in his head.
"Yes, yes, yes, precisely! So while half of you will be enjoying uninhibited happiness without any worry in the world, the other half of you might have to worry about the pesky real world stopping you from the high of bliss. Now, to decide! Desks clear, quills out!"
“I...look, Teddy, it’s late,” Harry finally whispers. “Let’s just lie down and get some sleep, yeah?”
"Oh, but I really think I do. People have always stared at me. It's got to be the most obnoxious thing I've ever experienced, and that's saying something. You ought to meet my aunt and uncle."
Was he supposed to talk to the baby? Draco wasn't sure and remained quiet as he watched Teddy discard the elephant after a moment and fall to his hands and knees and take off crawling. The speed at which Teddy moved was a bit surprising, but not nearly as surprising as when the small child grabbed at a tray and tried to pull himself to his feet.
Harry snorted, the sound echoing in the quiet castle. "Professor, 'm pretty sure I'm pissed and was just caught out of bounds."
Draco swallowed and looked around, though being at their own table. It didn't appear as though anyone had overheard Harry. It had been an unspoken agreement between them after Saturday night that they would keep their on goings quiet and out of view. For Draco, it was to avoid bringing Harry down with him, but he couldn't think of why Harry had always slipped into the arrangement. Likely, he was following Draco's lead. But, late at night when Draco was staring at the wall instead of sleeping, he found himself wondering if maybe...
Josh muttered something, but Harry had returned his hand and his attention back to Malfoy, letting the steady heartbeat calm some of his mounting panic. An Explosion Spell directly to the head couldn't be good. But Madam Promfrey could fix him, Harry thought, and his hand began to nervously rub Malfoy's chest. She had to.
"Listen here, you filthy fuckwad," the lead boy snarled, leaning in close to Draco. They were nearly the same height, but Draco found himself shrinking away. "I saw you talking to my sister at dinner last night, and she might be naive enough to think you were being nice, but everyone else knows better."
“We will be returning in about three months, on Monday, the 27th of November,” Mr. Cook says at the door. “At that time, we would like a copy of the notes from Teddy’s pediatric healer to see how he’s doing in that regard. Although, Harry, with how things seem to be going, I can’t imagine you have anything further to worry about in terms of being granted permanent guardianship. You will have to follow the contract through to the end, for which I am only partially sorry.” He laughs, pats Harry’s shoulder.
"Today, I'd like for you all to brew me something different," Slughorn continued. "Your deskmate will be your partner until Christmas, at which point in time we will mix it up for the second part of term. Go ahead and clear your desks, and I will come around and give each pair a potion to brew."
Oh well, Harry thought as he pushed the portrait hole open. That was what showers were for on a lazy Sunday.
At that, Malfoy openly laughs, unkind. “Think about that for more than two seconds and get back to me.”
Her eyes drifted into the crowd as she spoke, and Harry followed them, spotting the newlywed couple in the center of the chaos. Hermione was laughing, nearly doubling over in her slim white dress, one hand on Luna's shoulder and the other clutching a nearly empty glass of champagne. Ron stood beside her, just as red in the face, laughing with Neville and Hannah Abbott. Dean and Seamus, leaning heavily on one another, stood with them. It was an achingly good sight, Harry thought. But Mrs. Weasley's worry wasn't entirely unfounded. Not even walking, Ron stumbled into Neville, who caught him and laughed as he helped steady him.
McGonagall had been nearly beyond words when she, Ron, and Madam Pomfrey had arrived in the corridor. She had ordered Josh, Conrad, Maddox, and Cooper to her office, telling them that she would deal with them later, before tending to Malfoy with Madam Pomfrey. It was only over twenty-four hours later, when Harry was stumbling out of the hospital wing, that he saw her again and thought to ask what had come of the sixth years.
In a matter of two and a half days, Harry fucking Potter seems to have toilet trained the most stubborn toddler in existence. Draco would say the git’s bluffing, that Harry’s either flat-out lying and cleaning up everyday or just putting Teddy in nappies when Draco’s gone, but Draco’s
The pause is deliberate, Draco knows. Chase is waiting, watching with neutral eyes and a faint smile. Heat fills Draco’s ears.
A lot is processing in those big brown eyes. Teddy blinks several times and bites his lip as he tries to make sense of Draco’s and Potter’s assurances. Finally, after an endlessly hung moment, Teddy reaches slowly for Draco.
Burying his face into Draco’s legs, Teddy pulls at the robes there to cover his face, shield himself from view.
When the time to murder had finally come, unsurprisingly, Draco had hesitated. He had latched onto the conversation that Dumbledore began, wanting nothing more than to put off the moment when he would become a murderer. But when the headmaster had offered Draco help, offered his family shelter...it had ripped the breath from Draco.
Harry wasn't melodramatic enough to say that it had been the worst day of his life after Draco left him in the greenhouse, but Harry was melodramatic enough to try and chase after him.
"I was going to wait for you to come out on your own," she said, shooting him a glare. "But you were taking forever. I have a letter for you."
“Fell asleep just as we got home. He’s a pretty heavy sleeper, so I don’t know if he’ll wake up to talk or not.”
"I'd kick him and tell him to get up," Harry said without thinking. When Hermione just raised her brows at him for it, Harry groaned. "We are not having this conversation. I do not have a crush or whatever on Malfoy. I am not gay."
“It’s not even about the bloody noodles,” Harry groans, abandoning his reading entirely. “If he’d just take a bite or two, I’d leave him alone!”
Harry sprinted after Draco down the spiraling staircase, skipping two stairs at a time without pausing to marvel at how he didn't fall flat on his face. Draco hit the corridor first, veering left, and Harry followed. Carraway wasn't far behind, coming down the stairs before they could round the next corner. At least it was dark.
"It's a bit different than we used to eat," she said. "But I think it's about time for a change, wouldn't you agree?"
Draco carefully pulled out of Harry, who squirmed a bit at the sensation. They both straightened and faced one another, grinning like fools.
"Maybe," Harry said, his temper rising. "Since none of you seem to be trying to move past anything at all, just trying to stay stuck in the all the hate from before the war."
Mr. Cook takes a breath, soft and through his nose. “There is no gentle way to present this, I’m afraid. Earlier today, at 1:37 this afternoon, there was an explosion at the Malfoy Manor.”
He climbed the stairs and made his way to his bedroom, footfalls sounding excessive in the silence of the manor. His mother had never cooked before, leaving the task to their house elves. Even when their house elves had been placed into others' care by the Ministry, she had taken to anonymously ordering food for them rather than cooking herself. Perhaps she had taken up cooking to occupy herself, Draco thought as he stepped into his bedroom. It was untouched, a stray sock even still lying on the floor near his window. Though however she had come by the food, the smells that filled Draco's nose as he removed his cloak were fantastic.
"Well, you still have some time to change your mind before you're stuck with me for eternity," Harry said, pulling them both to their feet.
Harry snaps his head around at Mr. Cook’s voice. He’s peeking out of his office, waving a hand at him with a somber sort of grin.
Malfoy isn’t back from work yet. It’s a little surprising and a lot telling. Malfoy is usually back before ten, so it can’t be as late as Harry’s body feels it is. But even as he thinks about and dreads the daunting task of bathing Teddy and putting him to bed, Harry hears a loud crack, watches Malfoy Apparate into existence just a few steps away.
Without giving him a chance to reply, Hemione pats Harry on the arm and is whisked away by a passing swarm of Ministry workers. Perhaps it’s for the best. Harry hasn’t a clue how to respond anyway.
Draco slowed to a stop at the shout. He had learned early in the year that running only made things worse. Turning slowly on the spot, Draco found himself face to face with three furious but shockingly tiny Ravenclaws. The top of the tallest one's head wouldn't have bumped Draco's chin. Though his chest began to heave with anticipation, he couldn't help but wonder how old they were. Maybe he lucked out and they weren't old enough to do much damage.
“The rest of this document goes into the finer details and specifics of this particular case, mostly legal catch phrases that cover everyone’s tails if there is an issue later down the line. However, if you two are quite alright with Harry dropping Teddy off at Mr. Malfoy’s home to be watched every weekday for an agreed-upon amount of time with no additional visitations expected but not prohibited, I highly doubt that either of you will stumble into legal trouble. Most of the time, disagreements appear when one party tries to take advantage of the other.”
"A bit sad?" Harry asked, incredulous. "Hermione, the kids tried to literally blow Malfoy's head apart."
Her eyes were green, much like Potter's. But Karen's eyes held more innocence than he was sure he or Potter had ever possessed. He shook his head, feeling more and more like a monster.
“Eh, there are those that just keep pickin’ the dark after a nice light buffet, but you get my point. Only really been exposed to the glories of the Dark side, haven’t you? What does that do to a boy but exactly what it did to you?”
Harry brought a hand to his chest in mock-offense. "Hermione Granger, I have listened to every word you have ever said."
Not that anyone would care that he was bleeding, but Draco hated sporting bloodstains. He hadn't even a napkin to wipe any of it up, so he stood, keeping his head tilted back just enough to keep from dripping more blood onto the floor, and started to collect his things. Some of his books were as far as the top of the staircase.
Draco nodded, his head still hanging down. Now that his world had returned to normal, hot shame filled his belly. Nothing had happened to cause such a reaction. Nothing ever happened to truly cause these episodes that sprinkled over his past several months, but never before had Draco a witness.
Luna dropped beside Harry as one of the sixth years mumbled an answer. Her already wide eyes seemed to grow even wider upon seeing Malfoy's face.
“I know that, but for how much luck you wear like some gaudy cloak for all to see, I’ve dealt with Teddy’s magic acting up. I can’t constantly parade around for muggles a child that can change his appearance at will and turn birds into chickens.”
With everything his little legs have, Teddy leaps to his feet and bolts for the door. And as much as he would love to watch Draco chase a soiled toddler around before he leaves for work, Harry steps in Teddy’s way and grabs his arm. He immediately turns to goo, sinking to the floor and thrashing like a wild animal.
An enormous surge of affection for Hermione rushed over Harry, and he let his shoulders relax as they walked. He wondered if and hoped that Draco was still beside them.
Draco put the last of his completed homework away, left with only a Herbology diagram to label. It wasn't due until mid-week, and he figured he'd take care of it sometime the following day anyway. But as the moonlight from his enchanted window filled the small room, Draco decided that he had done enough for the night.
"Shit, Josh," one of the other boys said, sounding uncertain. "Don't cut up his face where people can see."
"That's a relief," said a voice behind them. "Because Ron looks like he's only a quarter hour to blacking out."
“Ah...” With a frown, Draco looks over at Harry. He looks back just as uncertain as how to answer. They haven’t spoken at all about what will happen when Draco’s lease is completed. It was mentioned at the very beginning that finding a place with a bedroom for each of them might be in the plans, but that was a whole month prior to moving in together at all.
Harry was curled around Draco, partially on his stomach and partially on top of Draco's chest with an arm thrown across him. One of Draco's arms was trapped beneath Harry's body, the other resting on the hand that Harry was using to grip Draco's shirt. Their legs were a hopeless tangle, reminiscent of the last time Draco had woken in Gryffindor Tower. But this time, panic and confusion didn't attack him, but rather he was lifted from sleep by a calm, lazy contentedness.
They had reached the castle steps, and Harry slipped his way into the entrance hall behind Professor McGonagall. The castle was hardly considered warm, but without the wind slapping Harry repeatedly, it felt as though stepping into a furnace. He sighed contentedly.
It was the longest two minutes Draco had endured in some time. No one spoke, Weasley's bewildered stare morphing into a confused glare that still jumped between Draco and Potter. Draco swallowed dryly and took a deep breath. He clasped his hands together to keep from shaking. When his inhales began to silently stutter, Draco felt a hand rest on his knee under the table.
“I look forward to seeing Teddy Monday, then.” He Conjures a slip of paper, his new flat’s address, and sends it floating through the space between them. “A little before eight?”
Malfoy gasped quietly for air, finally opening his eyes and looking at Harry directly. Fear clouded those pale eyes, but there wasn't an ounce of confusion in them as he whispered in between shaking breaths, "I don't...I don't deserve anyone's kindness. I just...I'm just here to...to finish school without...without causing a scene."
the off-site office, Draco takes a deep breath of fresh air to steady himself. Mondays are definitely his least favorite day of the week. But at least it’s finished. It’s not quite dinner time, though, leaving Draco with plenty of downtime before it’s a reasonable enough hour to call the day through.
Professor Carraway stepped onto the tower, deliberately trodding carefully to avoid making too much noise. Capable as she obviously was, she had developed a reputation of being an unnecessarily strict teacher, and it carried over into her nighttime patrols if the determined gleam in her eye was anything to go by.
The bed dips a little on his left. Potter’s voice is speaking again, sounding rumbling and...Draco hums. Call him a fool, but he hears concern there.
For the first time that term, Harry was going to Hogsmeade. It was a frigid Saturday, snow blanketing the grounds and heavy winds knocking over the smallest first years, but Harry figured it was time to just do it. He hadn't gone yet simply because he was avoiding the awestruck stares that his newfound heroism brought whenever he stepped into a public space. Buying his school supplies in Diagon Alley had been an absolute nightmare that he hadn't been eager to repeat.
me instead of putting him in nappies when I’m not around, you absolute waste of oxygen,” Draco snaps.
With so much time on his hands before lessons, Draco had taken a long, hot bath before making his way down to breakfast. It wasn't his usual meal, but Draco was feeling particularly good.
"Now, with the formalities out of the way, let us begin a new year!" Professor McGonagall called, sitting down rather abruptly.
Sighing, Harry looked down at the eggs, toast, and bacon that she had piled onto his plate. His stomach churned at the sight, but he knew Hermione was right. He began to pick at the eggs.
Draco groans, rubs his temples. “Leave it to you to give me a migraine in less than thirty seconds, Potter. What are you doing here so early? Did the Ministry come to its senses and boot you?”
Too wound up and too lost in his panic to care, Draco felt himself relax marginally at the sound of Harry's voice in his ear, breathing in stuttered bits of air that contained
Hermione gave him a sympathetic smile and patted his arm. "I know. But you of all people ought to know by now that we don't really have a say in when things like this come up. You've faced worse and come out on top. I doubt a little thing like a crush on Malfoy is going to ruin you now."
"Oftentimes, Mr. Potter, people forget themselves when they believe their loved ones are in danger," she said gently. "I can think of a few times when you acted rashly, thinking someone you loved was in trouble."
Teddy is our oldest child in this chapter. It took that kid like three years to actually eat a full meal after lunch and it drove my poor husband to the brink of insanity each and every day of it so here's to you, K
What was the matter with all of them? Harry slammed his bag on the desk and threw himself into the chair, breathing hard. They were all adults now, they had fought on the front lines of the war against Voldemort, and all his friends apparently had to show for it was a pocketful of old prejudices. If Harry had known returning to Hogwarts meant returning to the bullshit that was their sixth year, he wouldn't have agreed to come.
They glared at each other for a moment. After several seconds, Harry's lips twitched into a smile. He couldn't help it. Of course this was how their proposal would go. Laughing softly, Harry nodded.
Harry reached out and grabbed the front of Malfoy's cloak and pushed him against the wall. Abrupt fury lapped at Harry's stomach.
Ron rounded on Harry as Ginny disappeared out of the doors. "What the hell's gotten into you lately? Playing Mr. Hero and keeping Malfoy from being murdered is one thing, but you're trying to...I don't know, be his friend or something."
Harry gave one last teasing thrust before stepping back, letting Draco's hands fall. It was a gorgeous sight, Draco naked and wanting him, one that Harry wasn't sure he would ever properly get used to even if he wanted. Draco pushed off the wall and took Harry's hand.
But with the holidays bearing over them and Draco's body turning into putty beneath him, Harry decided to wordlessly ask once more. He didn't get the chance, however.
Hesitating just barely, Harry does, giving Draco the breathing room he so desperately needs. Handling the mess, he glances over at Teddy, who has eaten about half of his sandwich but is now poking his fingers experimentally through the bread.
"Right." Ron nodded awkwardly. "Well, best do as she says and wash up. She won't have you ducking out on our last dinner together."
Hermione rolled her eyes as she bent over to press a soft kiss to Ron's mouth. "We were only gone maybe a half hour. And most of that was just getting to and from."
Harry watched as the barn owl stuck out its leg for Draco to carefully attach his letter. He gave the owl a few gentle strokes, then carried it one of the many windows, where it took to the wind. Draco stood there, watching it fly away.
"Quidditch," Malfoy clarified, nodding his head toward the open window Harry now had his back against.
Teddy lifts his head and stares into Harry’s eyes for a moment. The default brown quivers a little before changing to green with a soundless pop. It's a friendly gesture, but Teddy's eyes are still wide, pupils bouncing around Harry's face, seeming to ask a question that Harry can’t decipher, before Teddy drops his face back into Harry’s chest. Harry pats at Teddy’s back and stands up, scooping the little body into him as he does.
Grinding his teeth, Harry forces himself to take a breath. After three weeks of having to face Malfoy more than he has since before the war, Harry’s patience is wearing thinner and thinner as the days pass. Even when they were at Hogwarts together, they hadn’t nearly as many one-on-one interactions as they have now, and almost none had required them to be as civil as they both are trying to be with Teddy around. It makes Harry’s skin crawl, having to keep his wand away in Malfoy’s presence.
It was...too much. He really had become a pathetic fool, Draco thought as he stooped down to give Karen a hug. She was absolutely tiny, but her arms still went fully around his middle when she returned the embrace. Perhaps Karen had a point and he did need to eat more. He thought he might actually snap in half at her tight squeeze.
“It certainly has the promise, and it’s not like the situation is novel,” Mr. Cook chuckles. “We’d just need Mr. Malfoy on board and to have things in writing-”
"I-oh...I asked you something," Harry moaned. Draco's hands were trailing carefully down his chest and abdomen, teasing at his pants.
“No harm done.” Malfoy grabs a canvas bag from the countertop and begins stuffing fruit into it. “I got caught up cooking and am only just now ready to leave anyway.”
Harry sighed, wondering if he ought to leave well enough alone. But he was a Gryffindor and The Boy Who Never Listened, and Harry reached out to Malfoy's left hand that rested on the desk between them. His hand hesitated above Malfoy's for a fraction of a second before dropping down and landing on the cold skin below.
Storming into the kitchen, he pulls out a thick glass and a half-empty bottle of Beetle Berry Whiskey. Chase only told him not to
"If the Malfoys had been found to be...well, not innocent, but...if the Wizengamot had found them to be trying to escape Voldemort...why was Lucius in Azkaban?"
Malfoy was easily taking up most of the bed, leaving Harry to perch awkwardly on the very edge. It was incredibly uncomfortable. Harry only lasted a minute before he nudged Malfoy's side.
A loud silence followed. Draco's entire body was hot and he was still sporting a raging erection that was distinctly disappointed at the turn of events. Much to his satisfaction and mortification, Draco saw that Harry, at least physically, was in the same situation.
“Yeah, she watched him every day but Thursday because she had an appointment with her healer about the baby. So my friend’s mom, Mrs. Wea- er, I mean, Molly Weasley, watched him that day.”
"W'sss 'appen'd?" Draco's question barely passed as actual words. Even to himself, it sounded as though he were speaking Troll.
Besides, Harry thought as the last of the first years found their seats and the Sorting Hat was put away, everything Malfoy did likely came down to wanting to please his family or keep them safe, something that Harry could only vaguely understand.
"As accurate a summation as that is," she said, fixing him with a stern look, "I was more meaning your maturity in regards to Mr. Malfoy."
Harry waited as Draco seemed to think it over, his hands gently running through Harry's hair. In the darkness, Harry unabashedly closed his eyes and savored the touch.
It was fast work, mere seconds flickering by before they were both entirely nude, and Harry's instincts dropped him fully onto Draco's body to continue their fierce kiss. Their cocks slid against one another, skin on skin, and Harry heard his own moan over Draco's at the explosion of sensation. When a soft hand wrapped around Harry's cock and began to slide up and down over the head, Harry let out a strangled cry and brought his own hand back down between them in search of Draco once more.
Once Andromeda moved herself and Teddy into the manor, Draco almost immediately caught onto Potter’s regular times that he came to visit the boy. Draco took great strides to make sure he worked those days to avoid the Boy Who Did Who Knows What Now, leaving the gap of interaction since their time at Hogwarts to proceed as planned. But after mere
Malfoy didn't answer, eyes downcast. Feeling brave, Harry took another tiny step closer directly into Malfoy's personal space. Harry reached up with his free hand and gently bumped Malfoy's chin, silently requesting those eyes. Confusion, sorrow, and fear swam there, breaking Harry's heart.
Finally reaching the top of the tower, Harry stepped around the small bend that opened to the whole surface. Sure enough, Malfoy was there, staring out over the grounds, sitting on the ledge.
“Since Teddy’s most recent park fiasco, I took the liberty to ask around at work where a good alternative for magical children would be,” Draco says, eyes averted as he walks over to the bookshelf. “That address is for a park protected by what will appear to be an abandoned burial house. It seems to be the most popular one and the most secure.”
They’re drifting into an argument. Harry can feel it as surely as he can feel Teddy’s eyes on him. There’s a lot of appeal in pressing forward in the nettling at Draco. It’s almost habitual, and yet Harry just shrugs as he takes another bite, tosses aside his ready-made, snarky remark that easily would have thrown them both into a spiral of bickering for the evening.
Harry laughed and pressed a kiss to Draco's mouth before sitting up and taking a few haggard breaths. Draco's room was darker than the Gryffindor dormitories, but Harry spotted his own tee shirt lying on the bed table and grabbed it. It wasn't the best job he could have done but Harry mopped up the mess that covered him and Draco, making sure not to rub too much of it into the skin.
Draco and Harry drop onto the couch at the same moment, at opposite ends. The cushions expel a fresh plume that reeks of Harry, his essence that has seeped into the very body of the couch, dousing them all. Draco draws Teddy into his lap.
Harry's lips trailed kisses down Draco's chin and neck, nipping at the skin just below his protruding collar bone. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath as Draco's hands gripped him tight on the arm and in his hair. A smirk stole Harry's lips at the sound and he slid his teeth against the soft skin again.
“Then no real harm done. Children get hurt at parks every day. I’m sure she’s fine, and Teddy will be, as well.”
“But he doesn’t seem hungry?” Ms. Dribble asks. She strides over to the bathroom, letting herself in without looking back.
Draco was rapidly becoming overly aware of how close they were. Barely a foot separated their faces, their hips smashed together, and Draco's leg was resting over Potter's thigh beneath the blankets. As Draco breathed as quietly as he could, he could smell Potter everywhere. It was overwhelming, and it was overwhelming how much Draco was
He heard footsteps running down the corridor. Harry's hand search Malfoy's chest, finding torn fabric and a long scratch across a sunken-in and pale chest. Hand quivering slightly, Harry reached into the fabric and pressed his hand to the chest in search of a heartbeat. It took only seconds, but he found one, faint though steady. He sighed, and Luna stood up to turn her attention to the sixth years.
“And it's not like I'm suggesting you move in with him directly, even if that'd save you even more time and money and effort, and could be beneficial in it's own way."
Harry, along with Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and another 10-15 students of varying age and House had been brought together to go over certain students' criminal files. Not all those students accused of crimes had been given to the committee. Most had willingly and openly confessed, stubbornly defending their actions and more or less proclaiming devotion to Voldemort's ways. Those students had been charged and sentenced to a mandatory three years in Azkaban's newest juvenile facility. Some of those students had been as young as 14.
Potter had once nearly begged him to eat. Those green eyes had turned up at him, wide and pleading...
The silence that engulfs the living room is only second in volume to the moment after the Dark Lord’s final death. Draco stands there in the tension, distinctly unraveled. A beat passes before Potter’s wand officially drops completely. Draco is breathing heavy. All he can do is return the stare Potter is giving him, both of them blank and a little shell-shocked.
Anger flickers in Potter’s eyes. Yet, instead of arguing back, he impresses Draco by taking a deep breath and looking away.
Not after the other night, Harry thought, his heart twisting sadly. He didn't elaborate, but he shook his head. "No, I know that's not it."
“Yes,” he all but breathes. “Making ends meet is harder since agreeing to care for Teddy and having my own flat all about the same time. You know better than most where the family money’s gone after my father went to Azkaban. Things are just harder now.”
As they neared the entrance hall, Harry asked, "What is that potion for, again? I, er, don't really remember."
“You know,” Draco says in place of addressing Teddy’s table manners, “he’s just about closer to three than two now.”
“Just fuck off, Malfoy,” Potty snarls abruptly. It’s as if he’s just noticed that Draco’s really moved forward, how close they’ve really become, still several feet between them but entirely too few, and Potter pointedly turns away.
"Harry," Hermione grabbed his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. She opened her mouth a couple times as though wanting to tell him something, but she eventually seemed to give up, releasing his hand and simply nodding toward the door. He left.
It was an old-looking building called Tomes and Scrolls, and as far as Harry knew, few students frequented the place. The Hogwarts library had most everything a student could possibly need or want, including a large collection of both wizarding and muggle novels. But Harry knew he had seen Malfoy enter, and he took a breath of sharp, cold air, coughed a bit for it, and stepped inside.
But Draco’s face is twisted in a shock that looks strange, irritated. His nose is wrinkled at the bridge, lips curled, eyes wide though his brows are dipped severely. “Were you...were you starved as a child?”
"Sorry," Draco said, taking a seat at the island in the center of the large kitchen. "Just distracted by something was all. Did...did you cook all this? It smells wonderful."
As he has been each night since moving in with Malfoy, Harry finds himself blinking awake in the dead of night, disoriented. The clock above the front door glows faintly. 1:02am. He slumps back into the cloud-like cushions of the sofa. He’s tired enough as it is without having his sleep interrupted every night for no better reason than not being in his own space.
It was taking a lot of concentration not to focus solely on Malfoy's hand in his or how Malfoy still had yet to move away from him. Harry watched as Malfoy's lips pursed together, pulling into his mouth and wetting them slightly. It was mesmerizing.
Keeping his finger where it was, Harry took his other hand from Draco's waist and move it between them, making sure to drag the fingers across Draco's stomach teasingly. He heard Draco's breath hitch slightly, then he wrapped his hand around Draco's cock and gave it a gentle tug.
Harry's lips crashed onto Draco's, knocking the latter against the window and nearly sending them toppling out into the snow. Draco grunted in surprise, but Harry's hand wrapped around the back of Draco's head, pulling him in and sealing their lips together as he practically climbed on top of Draco. He thrust his tongue into Draco's mouth, licking furiously until Draco quivered against him with a soft whimper. Harry tangled his fingers in Draco's hair and pulled, tilting Draco's head back just enough to part their lips so Harry could gaze into those pale eyes.
"Ohhh no," Harry muttered, bringing the wrists together and holding them fast with only one of his hands. It was lucky in that sense that Draco was so thin. "Your turn."
“I-I’m sorry, we’ve best be going.” And turning as fast as though trying to Disapparate, Harry begins to drag Teddy away from the frightened woman. Drawing closer to the rosebush and away from the muggles, Harry hisses, “You cannot do magic around muggles, Teddy, you
"What the bloody hell is this?" Weasley practically screamed, apparently reaching some kind of limit. "He some kind of faggot, too? Merlin, Harry, what the hell are you even doing trying to save this?"
"I'm not letting people get away with it, even if you're not going to help." Harry finally released Malfoy's cloak and took a step back. Malfoy stayed against the wall, looking increasingly lost. "I didn't go through all the hell I did just to let some stupid kids keep acting like this."
"Of course." His mother's small smile fell as Draco moved past her and into the lounge. As he rounded the corner toward the stairs, he barely heard her say, "I love you."
“The point I’m making, you washed up fool, is that you’re sending Teddy mixed signals. I was sure you’d be bested by a lot of things, but even I never imagined that a two-year-old would have been one of them.” Turning on his heel, Draco storms away, nose in the air.
"I'm a Death Eater, Potter," he whispered, voice almost covered by the wind. "I've done...horrible things. I don't deserve to have things be different now."
Just as he had in Herbology the morning before, Malfoy was breathing strangely and seemed to be forcing himself not to bolt from the room. It wasn't at all the Malfoy Harry had known for seven years, and while a change from the pretentious and smug prat was nice, it didn't suit Malfoy to look so downright petrified in the safety of a Potions class.
Lupin would have encouraged the friendship, though. Lupin had the same history with Snape but had made the effort to look past old differences. It had taken him well into adulthood, sure, but Lupin would have understood. Harry was certain of that.
She had said it so softly that Draco contemplated pretending he hadn't heard her. But his mother deserved more respect than that. He carefully removed his plate and hers from the island and moved to set them in the large sink before answering.
It was a little past midnight, and Harry was roaming the castle instead of sleeping again. Drained as he was, he couldn't stop the onslaught of thoughts, memories, and emotions that came for him when the sun went down. Ron had mostly apologized for breakfast, though Harry was fairly certain the apology had been delivered only at Hermione's insistence.
Alright, all transferred and I can consider this story laid to rest (again). It was interesting to reread a piece of my work from so long ago and see how things have changed. My husband likes to tease me for this piece and another I had the misfortune of drunkenly sharing with him, but there's little I can do unless I want to scrap the whole thing. And I'm not quite a fan of burying the past when it can show how much one's grown.
"Come on," Hermione said when she returned from the storeroom, arms full of ingredients. She didn't sound as exasperated as he had expected. There was even some sympathy, or maybe just pity, in her eyes. "The potion's not terribly complicated to start, and it'll help take your mind off Draco."
After the past seven years, a normal school term with normal adolescent issues did sound an awful lot like a vacation.
But when Harry returns home later, he wonders just how much merit the sentiment really has. He finds Draco leaning against Teddy’s bedroom door frame, pinching the bridge of his nose and looking all the part praying for patience as Teddy screams angrily somewhere beyond.
“En’ca’cas!” Teddy repeats happily as they breach the doorway. The smells aren’t unpleasant, and they hit full force then.
Draco stumbled into the Slytherin common room, nearly falling down the marble steps in his haste to reach the privacy of his dormitory. An unexpected perk of being the only male seventh year in his House, Draco had been given his own bedroom, no larger than a broom closet. It sat just to the left of the boy's main dormitory door and opened only at his hand, no password necessary for total privacy. He rushed in, slamming the door behind him as he collapsed onto the bed.
"I thought I had made it pretty clear that you leave my sister alone. Didn't you learn your lesson the first time?"
"Nah, it was mostly her," Weasley said. "She's been nagging at me to apologize since Saturday at the pub but I've been too damn embarrassed to actually do it. Feel ready now, though."
"Hey," the boy snapped, poking Draco hard in the chest until he opened his eyes. "What, you think I'm just gonna go away if you close your eyes? Well, too bloody bad."
And here Draco had thought he had been doing just that. But he had only been digging his mother a grave.
"Well..." Draco sighed, looking at the canopy above them. "I may have thought we were friends at the time, but looking back...I don't think I've ever really had a friend. I think I had a fan club. I was overly confident and I was one of the first people to treat the famous Harry Potter like he was rubbish. I think they just wanted someone to rally behind." Draco's eyes fell to his hand still over Harry's, still on his chest. "I...I never really could talk to any of them. I never really had anyone like that. I suppose it's just what I get for being a pretentious prat, but still."
Granger spoke first, the casualness sounding incredibly forced. "So, Malfoy. Er...Draco." She licked her lips and glanced at Weasley, whose eyes grew wide. "I saw you go into Tomes and Scrolls. Do you, uh, did you find what you were looking for?"
“You certainly have an excellent attitude about it, I must say. Especially given that you grew up with more than the average wizard’s financial security.”
Draco nodded. "I haven't written her since term started. She hasn't written me, either, but I know she's just trying not to bother me."
No, Draco had never hated his mother for the events of the past. She had always been far stronger and braver than his father could have ever hoped to be. More than once, even before all the Darkness had penetrated their home, Draco had wondered what on earth she ever saw in his father. Regardless of how his father had treated him, causing more than one argument Draco overheard, she had stayed and remained unwaveringly loyal to Lucius Malfoy.
"For one thing," Hermione said, tipping her orb skins into the cauldron, "it's obvious that he's been nothing but happy with you up until now. For another thing, he's only acting this way because he thinks that being with you in any way is endangering his mum."
"I'm sorry, it's just that you're so young," he said. "What makes you think you know what you like already?"
The entire thing is full of produce. Harry stares, a bit amazed that for such a large refrigerator, Malfoy has managed to fill almost every nook and cranny with fresh leafy things and fruits and strange vegetables Harry can’t name. There are a handful of sauce jars and some milk, but otherwise-
“Nah. Just tryin’ to keep you straight a touch, kid. You’ve come a long way. Even said ‘please’ today.” The barman winks. “Makin’ strides, you are.”
"I don't know, and quite honestly, it's not even something I should be explaining." Hermione wiped her eyes again, looking less upset when her hands fell to her sides. "Ron will have to do that himself, and he's going to do it to Malfoy's face if he'll have him. Then it'll be up to Malfoy if he wants to forgive him or not."
The Malfoy Manor was cold. It always had been, in that emotional sense that books spoke of, but as Draco locked his old school trunk, now fully packed, he could physically feel the chill pass through his bedroom. He straightened, rubbing circles into his sore back. He had been packing his trunk on and off for weeks, stopping for days at a time as he swayed between how bad of an idea he thought it was at the time. Draco collapsed onto his bed with a groan.
Guilt burned his insides, snaking through his veins like an untamed fire. After he had been made to return to the world of the living from his days-stay in Percy's bedroom, Harry had immediately sought out Ginny. He had held it in his heart throughout the past year that those brown eyes, those freckles, those soft hands, those flowing red locks, that laugh, and that smile were all he wanted once the torment of war was over. But the moment he saw her, sitting in the living area reading a book, Harry knew. He knew at immediately that he could never love Ginny the way he once thought he could. But he had pressed on, making his way to her and speaking quietly, wanting to push that feeling away.
Andromeda answered. It was rather shocking just how much she really looked like Bellatrix, though Draco could tell that her features were softer, her body less sharp and angular, eyes kinder under lighter hair. She opened the door and smiled a thin smile at them both, eyes drifting between them as she stepped to the side to let them indoors.
Harry had been so absorbed in what his hands were doing that Draco's tongue caught him off guard. The hand on and in Draco's arse twitched slightly, crooking his finger and bumping against something deep within that had Draco yelping into his mouth.
He hadn't said it very loud, but Harry rushed over when Malfoy didn't reply. He dropped to Malfoy's side, heart beginning to hammer, only to find that the Slytherin was...asleep.
The cut was along all four of Malfoy's fingers, slicing downward but hardly deep. Harry sighed with relief. He could fix this. He pulled out his wand and aimed it at the wounds.
“Had you ever considered doing something in potions before all this?” Harry asks. “Maybe not the apothecary, but something else that required the skill?”
"I didn't realize you two were so close. I mean, I remember you liked him a lot as a teacher, but I didn't know you saw him much after he left."
"And I can hardly blame you," she said, speaking as though she didn't hear his half-hearted denial. "I know you don't mourn your father. He was terrible to you, even before the Dark Lord rose again." She closed her eyes for a moment. "I only wish I had been more aggressive in protecting you from him. No child deserves what Lucius put you through."
"Oh, I think not," Luna said serenely. "Of course, this all began with his mother, but he's only being so dramatic because of how much you mean to him."
“I don’t know,” Harry says with a shrug. “It’s easier now. Honestly, I think calling him something different’s helped. We still don’t agree on much, but we haven’t been at each other’s throats in weeks. We're able to just...talk now. It's always about Teddy, but I can't really imagine what else I'd talk to the bloke about.”
"Besides, Ron," Mr. Weasley said, shooting a look at Mrs. Weasley. "The Malfoys, while undeniably foul in the past, were one of the few families that were tried and found to be trying to break away from Voldemort. It doesn't make anything they did right, but it does make a difference."
"I love you," Harry whispered, lining himself up with Draco's entrance. His head touched the skin there, surprisingly more wet than he had anticipated. He didn't expect an answer. He just wanted to make it clear to Draco that this wasn't just something he was handing out on a whim. It meant something to Harry.
The chatter that had been spilling through the shut doors abruptly stopped as Draco stepped into the Great Hall. Hundreds of heads whipped around to get a good look at him, glares firmly in place as whispers broke out like an angry wind. Instinct threatened to take over at the reaction, Draco's breath hitching slightly in his chest. But he ignored it. He ignored his body, ignored the eyes, ignored the whispers, and strode over toward the Gryffindor table.
“Actually, he’s off tonight,” Harry says with a grin. Something about Draco’s healer having to reschedule this week’s appointment and next. Having already enjoyed a party at the Burrow over the weekend, it didn’t really cross Harry’s mind to use the unexpected freedom to do something on his literal birthday.
I can’t- I can’t even fathom it. I spent too long sneaking out of that stupid cupboard under the stairs trying to properly fill myself to get it. I just-” Dragging both hands down his face, Harry tries to calm himself down. He’s far too upset for being so long after dinner.
“Don’t worry yourself, Potter, I’ll keep an eye on him.” Draco smiles politely as Potter shoots a glare over his shoulder. “That is, after all, why we’re all here.”
Luna's hand held Harry's tight as she led the way down toward the dungeons, down toward the Slytherin common room.
"Right..." Of course Hermione noticed. Surely others had, too. Not that it bothered Harry, who had always been in the spotlight and the center of various levels of outright wild rumors, but it did make his cheeks feel somewhat warm at the thought of what others might be saying about him and Malfoy.
Malfoy frowned. "People have always stared at you because you're Harry bleeding Potter, the Boy Who Lived and all that. The stares are different than the ones I'm getting, I can assure you."
It took nearly ten minutes but Harry finally reached the portrait hole and climbed in (after angrily shushing a curious Fat Lady) and sneaked into his dormitory. He slowly laid Malfoy out on his bed and glanced around. It was too dark to see, but Harry could hear the calm snores of Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus from behind their curtains. He breathed a sigh of relief.
"But how the hell would being with me put his mum in danger?" Harry grumbled, stabbing at the stems with a renewed venom.
“Well, Harry,” Mr. Cook says with a wave of his wand, “thank you for your time.” The quill and parchment drop all signs of life, falling into the wizard’s hands. “We have the little we need at this time, and we will be returning in precisely three weeks, on Friday, the 24th of March, for a more thorough interview and inspection once both of you have had some time to settle.”
Mr. Cook raises a surprised brow. “Teddy’s case, Harry. What will become of him now that he has lost nearly all his family. Though Mr. Malfoy is the last of Teddy’s blood relatives, you are Teddy’s legally appointed godfather.”
The Care-Seekers made sure to schedule the appointment for a time when Draco and Harry could both be present, a little off-putting but understandable. Although having the meeting so late will throw off Teddy’s nightly routine, which always results in significantly less sleep for everyone, Draco’s glad the Care-Seekers were willing to accommodate around his psychotherapy rather than insisting he take off work. That would have been more of a headache for all the Ministry requirements of him. Theoretically, it was supposed to make everything all the easier.
Potter's lips twitched as though wanting to smile. "Maybe not, but I think things could be different now, don't you?"
Malfoy looked as though he would have liked to roll his eyes, and for a moment Harry felt as though he were looking back in time. But the sensation was shattered when Malfoy sighed sadly and looked down. "I don't need protection. Anything that comes my way is well deserved."
Harry stands with Teddy, smile dropping away. “I’m always in a hurry to get out of here. You only just noticed?”
Somewhere in the past several weeks, Malfoy had become someone worth worrying over for Harry. He had become someone that cause such strong emotions that Harry had nearly sent his own curse at Malfoy's attacker that evening. It was unexpected, these surging feelings, but Harry found that he wasn't averse to the idea. It did, however, raise several questions that he wasn't sure he wanted to answer. But Harry had long ago learned to take things as they came, be what they may, and he was not going to overthink whatever was happening between him and Malfoy.
A smile found Potter's lips as he nodded, not taking the bait to argue. "I guess I could have, but...I didn't want to."
Harry closed his mouth with a snap in an attempt not to dramatically gasp. It came out in his voice regardless. "I'm sorry,
Hands balled into fists in his pockets and teeth furiously grinding together, Draco turns on his heel and all but stomps out of the office.
“Things are just going to take some getting used to. Potter and I aren’t used to being around each other all the time yet and we...we...”
Damn, Draco thought, closing his eyes for a moment. Of course the one person he had broken his vow of silence for was the little sister of an overprotective and aggressive Gryffindor that was built like a troll.
The wind of the morning had died down as the sun continued across the sky, making the short walk far less miserable than it would have been. Warmth from the sun teased their faces around their scarves as a light breeze billowed their cloaks. There was only a mile or more between Andromeda's home and the small corner store, but Harry was glad to have Draco's company for the distance.
Aberforth hadn't left his post in Hogsmeade after everything that had happened, something that had initially surprised Harry when he had found out. But it made sense, really. Aberforth was kind of a coward, and now that the danger was gone, he would have wanted to return to the familiarity of his dusty old bar and depressing flat so he could continue to mourn Arianna and hate Albus in peace.
Draco chuckled softly, watching those curls bounce as Karen skipped off to the Great Hall. He might not be able to have Harry and the others, but Karen he could keep around. At least while he was still at Hogwarts. She'd probably single-handedly keep him alive.
“Teddy, stop that,” he whispers, grabbing his godson by the upper arms and moving him back into the chair at his left. “You can’t get down right now. We have to stay in our chairs.”
“-but things are what they are, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Potter has guardianship for now, and short of him proving to be a danger to or outright neglectful of Teddy, very little is going to change that. I would not recommend intruding upon them at this time. They’ll have plenty of adjusting to do, and I suspect you appearing and trying to take over could complicate things for little Teddy.”
"Trying to have a conscience now?" she hissed dangerously. Though speaking softer than before, Pansy's voice easily carried across the room. "Wormed your way out of trouble with the law, now you're just going to sit here and force yourself on us all? No one wants you here, least of all any of us," she said, gesturing to the crowded common room. "You should just get out before something awful happens to you."
The lift doors open to the Ministry’s main atrium. Draco lets the indistinct buzzing of activity wash over him, willing it to drown away the pounding fury in his chest. Not that he anticipated Ms. Dribble signing Teddy over to him or anything of the sort, but he didn’t expect to be so blatantly told to back off. A growl hangs in his throat.
When the clock strikes four and he’s free, all Harry wants to do is crash onto the couch and pretend he doesn’t exist for a few minutes. The desire vanishes the moment he Apparates into the living room, replaced with bewildered curiosity.
There was more applause as an unnecessarily stocky man stood up and waved alongside Professor Vector.
"It might be, yes." The Fat Lady swung open her portrait, and Harry felt himself being gently pushed through. "Now off to bed with you. And if I catch you out of bed after hours again, I
When Malfoy returned, it only took them nearing three-quarters of an hour to find out what each poison was, much to Harry's shock. Malfoy had dropped in seemingly random ingredients to each vial and waited for it to react or not, then Harry used the textbook to find out what each test ingredient was paired with as a catalyst. After finding the key ingredient for each vial, it took Malfoy mere minutes to find and write out the poisons names, clearly and carefully labeling the vials.
A breathy laugh from Harry hit Draco's lips, and his eyes snapped open in alarm as Harry panted against him, a wide smile on his lips.
Harry reached over and took the baby from Draco, cuddling him close to his chest as Teddy cooed and smacked him in the face delightfully. "I, er, guess I never mentioned I have a godson, huh?"
Three in the morning was far less late than it used to be. Draco had always grown up a morning person. He had always fallen asleep with the sun and woke with it. It was only when he began working tirelessly to repair the Vanishing Cabinet in his sixth year that time began to turn into a relative concept for him. Falling asleep became harder, staying asleep even worse. Now, three in the morning was practically his mid-morning.
"I wrote your mum, you know," Harry said suddenly. "After you both...after I heard you were both cleared by the Ministry. I wrote to thank her for lying to Voldemort for me, for saving my life."
“Wow,” Harry says dully. He sets out a small bowl of yogurt for Teddy, removes the plate of enchiladas and adds it to his own. “How very...you.”
"Good morning! As I'm sure you're tired of hearing, it is wonderful to see all you seventh years returning to Hogwarts this year to finish your education proper."
"Oh, dear!" Slughorn cried. "So sorry, it seems we lost track of time! Just label a vial and leave a sample of your potion on my desk and we will discuss your marks next lesson!"
"Let's skip the formalities, shall we? Narcissa and I already cleared away most of the awkwardness." She pulled back and surveyed Draco closely at arm's length. "You look good. A bit ill, perhaps, but good."
Draco grinds his teeth, turning away. His eyes catch sight of the invitation. “Don’t be so childish.”
Irritation keeps Harry from relaxing. Harry pushes off the couch, goes to peek in on Teddy, Malfoy and his independence fetish be damned. But when he sees through the darkness of Teddy’s room that the blankets are still, the air without noise, there’s a hesitation in Harry. He creeps closer to the tiny bed to kneel down, almost hopeful to find Teddy awake and silently crying so he can comfort the distress that Malfoy caused.
Days crept by where simply seeing Ginny had hurt him. Talking to her was a challenge Harry hadn't yet overcome. Something enormous had shifted between them. So much had changed. They had each lost so much, and Harry had his own inner demons that only multiplied in their year apart. Less than a week had passed when Harry knew that he no longer loved Ginny the way she loved him.
His eyes are impossibly wide and wet, and he’s very clearly shaking as he clings to his elephant with white knuckles. Beside him, the wall is splintered from the boy’s unchecked magic, the too-big emotions for such a small body. Draco has never seen him so frightened.
"Uh..." Draco glanced at his mother. Her face didn't reveal anything that Harry could understand, though she did give Draco a nearly imperceptible nod. "Sure."
“Have you gone absolutely mad?” Harry squeaks. “Do you really hate me that much that I accidentally kicked your cat last weekend?”
"Well, if it's not here..." Luna straightened and frown at the bookshelf. "I suppose I'll have to bother the shop owner. Well, I'll see you back at the castle then, shall I? Enjoy your afternoon."
he would take Teddy into his own bed after their conversation last night, Draco begins making a breakfast large enough to feed all three of them. It’ll show Teddy that they’re a united group, something almost reminiscent of a family, Draco thinks spitefully as he stirs the eggs.
"Along these lines, as you may have noticed from the Sorting, this means that we have twice the number of first years that we usually do. For this reason, seventh years in each House have been drawn additional quarters than the normal dormitories to make room."
It wasn't unheard of, but having an odd-House-out in a family was a bit unusual. But Draco didn't think that was what Karen really needed to hear.
"Oh, Harry, Draco, thank goodness I found you," she said, pulling them both into a bone-breaking hug. She pulled back and held onto their robes as she fixed them with a stern glare. "You two staying sober as you promised, right?"
Harry chuckles through his nose, just a breathy sort of laugh, as he drops back onto the couch. Maybe it’s not such a bad thing, to be the bad guy, he thinks. At least Teddy will eat the noodles.
"I did the exact same thing," he said, trying to collect himself. "Obviously, I asked your mother, too, but I did the same fucking thing, Draco."
Draco’s boots are silent on the expensive carpet of the entrance hallway as he makes his way to the reception desk. Glass separates him from behind the counter, something that makes him wonder every week if there’s a particular story behind the design.
"No, it isn't," Hermione said, coming over as some of the quiet faded back into conversation, newspaper in hand and Weasley at her back. "But here's what everyone's talking about."
“This is a public space, Potter,” he sneers, much sharper than his intended mock-offense. “Or had you thought you now owned the Ministry?”
"Well, I'm glad I found you." Hermione turned and walked alongside Harry down the corridor, much to his horror. He wasn't sure how he could shake her to relieve Draco, and he wasn't sure he wanted Draco to hear whatever Hermione might have to say about the previous day.
Fire Whiskey literally burned with every swallow, but the pain was something beautiful to Harry. It made him feel, as cliche as he knew that sounded. He snorted into his half-empty glass. He really was being quite pathetic.
Shrugging, Draco pulls a book from the topmost shelf and heads for his room. “Now you can quit your whining and take Teddy out for all the socialization you think a child could possibly need.” Tossing a quirked brow over his shoulder, he adds, “Maybe it’ll help you, too, Mr. Cupboard Under the Stairs.”
“Not like that,” Harry chuckles. “I meant...I don’t want us having a row twice a day being the only real example he has of how people treat each other. We ought to make more of an effort to be nice.”
Harry hums a bit, annoyed. Of course Malfoy’s being a huge pest about it. Teddy is turning into real deadweight on his shoulder, and Harry shifts to keep him awake as he heads for the bathroom.
"Why're you so pro-Malfoy all the sudden, anyway?" came a voice from directly behind Harry. He turned and found himself within feet of Ginny for the first time in months, who was glaring down at him.
“You have a point,” Draco says with a final chuckle. “But from what little I see of Teddy and Potter together and how Teddy acts overall, it would seem that Potter’s not entirely inept.”
Draco's mother had tried for weeks to convince him that his father had done everything he had to try and protect them. Perhaps he had, but Draco knew that if his father hadn't been so weak, so prideful, so pathetic as to have ever been in the Dark Lord's service, the past seventeen years could have been so different. Even if Draco had still been raised to be the snarky little arsehole that he was, the Malfoy name wouldn't have been drug through the mud that now clung to Draco's every molecule. Had his father actually changed his ways after the Dark Lord's disappearance all those years ago instead of just pretending, maybe Draco wouldn't have been thrust into the positions he had been. Maybe he would have grown to be less of the evil prat that deserved every ounce of loathing that he knew was coming his way the second he stepped onto the train the next morning.
Mrs. Weasley sighed fretfully. "I know everyone is enjoying themselves, but it will be a relief when everyone is home safe and sober again. I do hope there's less alcohol at your own wedding, you know."
Merlin, Draco thinks. “Yes,” he says aloud. “He’s still getting all his food groups, though. He’s anything but particular. I feel like he just doesn’t like to eat a lot at once, so he has smaller portions throughout the day.”
"New year, new partners!" Slughorn greeted the class as he stepped into the dungeons. Draco was only just behind him as the doors swung shut. Harry tried to catch his eye, but Draco stared determinedly at the floor and sat at one of the empty tables across the room from where they had sat all year. Slughorn strode past them all to take his place at the front of the room. "Let's hop to it, then! New partners until exams, so make sure you choose wisely."
"Yeah, well, good thing." Ron and Harry dropped their vials off on Slughorn's desk. "About time he actually pulled his own weight in Potions, eh? Rather than letting his name do it."
Draco unbuttoned Harry's pants painstakingly slow, nipping at his neck all the while, sending Harry into a daze while he again fumbled his fingers at Draco's dress robes, trying to figure out how to undo them. But when Harry's pants fell to the floor and Draco began to kiss and nibble his way down Harry's front, all brain functions ceased. He could only stand there, breathing heavily against the door, as Draco's nose bumped the skin just beside his erection, cheek grazing his cock without meaning to and making Harry's eyes roll back. Draco's hands were sliding down Harry's sides, coming to rest on his thighs, as he tilted his head to plant a tender kiss to the underside of Harry's cock.
"Now, this is a rather unusual ingredient, as it is a potion itself, correct? But, as I'm sure some of you remember, it also wasn't listed in the recipe."
Brows creasing, eyes bemused, Harry seems to tense fully for an instant just before his shoulders fall slack, and a strange sense of triumph flits through Draco when Harry goes to pick up his sandwich.
Not wanting to be rude, Harry simply nodded and Andromeda disappeared back into the kitchen, returning a moment later with a large tray in her arms.
Draco clenches his teeth, breathing slowly through his nose. It’s not exactly a sensitive subject, not after all the years he’s known he could never achieve his childhood dream career, but he still doesn’t like to be reminded of it. He shakes his head, taking a long drink before answering. “It doesn’t matter. I can’t do it now anyway.” Sensing that Harry is about to press further, Draco shifts the conversations, asks, “Are you prepared for the interview with the Care-Seekers tomorrow?”
Draco climbed onto the open window ledge and let his feet dangle in the open air. Falling from the tower hadn't been how Dumbledore died, but it was what the body endured immediately following. Draco leaned over so that his chest was over his knees, only the seat of his pants keeping him on the stone. He had been the cause for the late headmaster's death, and he felt compelled to know what death felt like because of it. He could scoot forward just a few inches and fall, his body likely reacting as Dumbledore's reportedly had, landing with limbs struck out at unnatural angles and eyes still open.
Ron shoved an enormous piece of chicken into his mouth, cutting off any plans of replying. Which, Harry suspected, was the point.
“Alright, Teddy,” Harry says when Draco Disapparates without so much as a spare glance in his direction. “Let’s get moving, hm?”
Draco shrugged. "Not that the textbook or Professor Sprout mentioned. Maybe whatever they're talking about is just interesting."
Draco chooses not to answer immediately, opting to watch Teddy wander over to the little play area before rolling his eyes back to the bullshit at hand. “How dense you must truly be. According to the owl I received last night,
"I...er...didn't see you," he said lamely. "I...I looked all around the common room. No one...no one was there."
“Definitely,” Harry agrees with an awkward chuckle. He watches as the old witch disappears to inspect the flat. Mr. Cook is helping himself to the sitting area, pulling out his Quick-Notes Quill and parchment. Harry joins him, Teddy still a deadweight. “So, good day, Mr. Cook?”
As Professor Sprout began scribbling down several strange names on the blackboard, the class hastily pulled out parchment and quills, wanting to jot down all they could. Draco began to copy down the names, forcing himself all the while to take deep, soothing breaths so that he didn't faint at the desk. How had he thought he could return to Hogwarts?
Harry was pretty sure that the feather in his hand was just the feather of a regular parrot, but he didn't say so.
"What? No, nothing like that. Just wondering how the hell we're supposed to get all this done in one lesson."
Barely lifting his shoulders, Draco readies the two cups as the kettle starts to steam. He pours over the water and offers one to Harry. “I fiddle with potion ingredients all day. I might have a talent for brewing, but the apothecary is hardly exciting. It meets the Ministry's requirements and that’s all there is to it.”
"Well..." Draco said, breathing heavily. He gestured to their scattered clothing and then the door. "Shall we?"
Harry had been most disturbed by Josh's punishment after everything. He had admitted to instigating the first attack and took full responsibility for the second, and yet McGonagall hadn't expelled him as Harry had viciously hoped. But when the headmistress had told Harry that Josh also lost all his Hogsmeade privileges for the year, along with a month's worth of detentions followed by weekly detentions until the end of the year, Harry had felt his hackles fall. It was almost exactly what his own punishment had been after he himself had attacked Malfoy two years previous.
Karen glanced over at the table of first years and shrugged. "To be honest, I'd rather sit here with you for now."
Flames were pressed firmly into Draco's skin, igniting his skin where four wand tips assaulted him. The wand tips lifted and found new flesh to burn, repeating the process over and over again. Draco groaned involuntarily and squirmed at the pain, but thankfully, his attackers held him steady.
“Yes, precisely! Glad to hear that you’re both on board with this. We do try to avoid stranger adoptions at all costs, and I must say that you young men are putting your best feet forward for Teddy here. I must say that I am overjoyed at the dedication!”
Harry pulled back, trying to find Draco's eyes in the darkness of the closet. They were both panting, and Harry could feel Draco's body trembling slightly against his.
"Glad to see you two...ah...hadn't left," Ginny said, winking at Draco, who gave her a silent sneer behind Mrs. Weasley's back.
She released him and took the parcel from Draco's mother's arms, setting it on the couch. "How's Hogwarts this year?"
The hospital wing door opened just then, and Madam Pomfrey turned to see who had entered. Draco peered around her.
The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn't quite place it. It sounded terribly far away, yet as though filtering into his consciousness directly at his ear at the same time.
Approaching footsteps echoed in the far end of the corridor, and Malfoy started as though burned. With a last puzzled look at Harry, Malfoy turned and strode off, leaving Harry standing alone.
"But," Ron said loudly, "with how happy you two prats made each other, it was hard not to be okay with it. You were a sopping, depressed mess after the war."
"I..." Draco swallowed again. "I asked Mr. and Mrs. Weasley for their blessing before I even bought the ring. I...I wanted to make sure it was okay before I...before I asked you to marry me."
when that moment comes. Thankfully, the flat is smoke-free an entire thirty seconds before Draco Apparates into the living room.
"I, uh...used a minor cutting spell on his face and front...just...just to make sure he was listening. He wasn't saying anything."
"Malfoy?" he asked, doubtful. "Draco Malfoy, Death-Eater-at-sixteen Malfoy? Tried-to-kill-Dumbledore-himself Malfoy? 'Alright'?"
“Well, I suppose it would be easier on everyone, namely Teddy,” Malfo says. His eyes unfocus from Harry, voice soft as though thinking out loud rather than continuing the conversation. “He wouldn’t have to wake up quite as early, all his things would be in one place.”
Chase chuckles, coming to stand beside Draco, bump his hand out of the way to open the door for him. “Do not go drinking. Please.”
“Merlin, you’d risk Azkaban hexing an unarmed man in the middle of the Ministry?” Draco scoffs before he can stop himself. Foolish, he reprimands himself. He draws closer to Potter, watching as that stupid face nears the point of popping a vein, and Draco forces himself to drop the cutting tone. “Look, I-”
“What’s the issue?” Draco asks when the losing battle persists. “You’ll let him just throw tantrums, but he has to clear a plate of food he doesn’t want?”
“Mmmm, I remember when my own did that. Drove my wife crazy,” Mr. Cook chuckles. “And eating? I know you had your concerns there at first, Harry. How’s he doing now?”
She patted his shoulder. "Not to worry, Mr. Malfoy. I'll be here if anything else is to happen, though I'd frankly rather you not need it."
“It’s alright, really,” Harry cuts in. “Between Saturday and this, I think my birthday’s been properly celebrated. Thanks for this. I need to make more time to do this again soon.”
“You ought to let him,” Hermione says from his other side. “It hasn’t officially started in any case. You may as well let him get some of it out of his system.”
Draco always knew Potter had no class. But the towering buildings cluttered together barely a kilometer from the Ministry’s main entrance...Draco scrunches his nose at the fading red brick and stained concrete before him. A building marked with a cracked sign that reads ‘COMPLEX E’ is in front of him. Draco takes to the wide stairs, sincerely concerned at the lack of handrails.
Harry's head smacked the floor, sending fireworks erupting in his vision, but he blinked them away as he twisted himself and pulled at Malfoy's robes so that they were both upright. When Harry finally came face to face with Malfoy, his heart stopped.
Draco frowned slightly. "I suppose. It'll be nice not to worry about homework and studying, but...it's going to be strange, going back to the manor. I doubt my mother's finished grieving...how about you? You'll be with the Weasleys, right?"
“You were right about the park,” Harry repeats flatly. May as well own it, he thinks. “Teddy turned a set of stairs into a slide and got another kid hurt. The mum was frantic, thought the country was going to the bin. So we left, but Teddy was screaming like a lunatic so it looked like I was kidnapping him. So you were right. I shouldn’t have taken him.”
"I'm sure he'll be okay," Hermione said. Harry looked over at her and she, too, was watching Draco sadly. "It can't be fun now, but all these rumors about him and his mum...well, that's all they are. Just rumors made up and started to try and hurt them."
“The anniversary is coming up,” he said, showing off his too-white smile. “This would be a great experience for you to see just how far you’ve progressed for yourself!”
Harry’s jaw locks. His knees stop bouncing so visibly. “That’s just a butterknife, it’s not even sharp.”
Ginny stepped over to them, holding her own glass of champagne, though hers was mostly full and likely only her first or second. She met Harry's eyes and smiled. It had been well over a year since their official break up and argument in the Hogwarts courtyard, and Harry was pleased with how far they had come. It had taken Harry graduating and them enjoying some distance, but by Ginny's seventh year Christmas, things had become familial again, much to Harry's relief.
Harry sighed, wishing he hadn't been so quick to anger. But Ron simply gave his shoulder another pat and left, leaving the door open as a reminder to follow. Harry rubbed his eyes once more, then stood and made his way downstairs.
But neither Harry nor Malfoy stood as Slughorn waddled away, instead opening their textbooks to find the recipe. The effects reminded Harry of some of the muggle creams that Aunt Petunia used to put on her face every evening. It didn't look terribly complicated except for a bolded note that, if not thickened correctly, the potion could cause wrinkles instead of removing them. At least it didn't look likely to explode all over them. Harry looked over at Malfoy.
It was slow. It started with tripping over scattered toys throughout the manor and irritably returning them to the boy or Andromeda, with listening to the wails from his bedroom after Teddy took his first spill down the staircase, with annoyance at the disruption to the quiet sort of dismal existence Draco was expecting after the war. And from it, from the ashes of utter and all-encompassing self-loathing and crippling, raging nothingness, Draco found himself watching Teddy. From open doorways, from corners of various rooms, across the table at meals his mother forced him to attend, Draco found himself watching Teddy as he stumbled about the manor, giddily adventurous and loud; so different from the child his mother had said Draco once was. Teddy took on the world as if there were no risks, trust shimmering in the depths of oversized eyes that changed color with the boy's mood. Andromeda never shouted at Teddy, something that baffled Draco at first. She could be sharp, absolutely firm, and strict, but typically Teddy was regarded with gentle love, playful guidance.
Draco signs his name on the register scroll. “Yes,” he says stiffly. After a hesitation, he adds, “Good afternoon.”
He headed the way round the corner and found four Gryffindor sixth years that he recognized as Josh Gregory, Conrad Oswald, Maddox Smith, and Cooper Fretzel. They stood in a semi-circle, wands drawn and eyes widened in shock. There was an unconscious heap near the wall that Harry recognized as Malfoy.
"Well, I haven't exactly mentioned it. I had entirely forgotten that you were related to him, though."
“See,” Harry says after the first bite, “they’re amazing. All your whining was pointless, and I mean that as a compliment. I think.”
at him? It’s a very long silence otherwise, and Draco just drifts in the abyss of how his body is moving though he’s laid out on his bed, sure he’s about to really fall asleep. The nothingness sounds nice.
To his surprise, Harry nodded. "Yeah. I still have nightmares from as far as before I came to Hogwarts. Most nights, I barely sleep because of it. Except, of course, the two times I had you here."
"You were worse, trust me. Always brooding up in Percy's room, hardly saying a thing, only eating when Mum practically force-fed you. It was miserable just being near you."
When Draco Apparates home, Harry is just walking into the living room from the bathroom, hair wet from a shower. There’s the polite exchange of vague nods. Draco sets his bag on the shelf, withdraws a copy of
"Mmm," Harry hummed, trying to keep his eyes open. He thought they might be in the corridor that held the Fat Lady. Sweet bed, so close.
"It doesn't matter what a bunch of kids think is right or wrong, or how they think justice ought to be carried out," he growled, glowering at his feet. "This is exactly the kind of bullshit that the war was supposed to put an end to! All this hate was supposed to die with Voldemort!"
It was to help Malfoy, really. Harry couldn't just leave him to sleep on a freezing floor at the top of the Astronomy Tower. But he also couldn't get into the Slytherin common room and hope to find which bed was Malfoy's in the dark. Too, Gryffindor Tower was drastically closer, and Harry could get inside.
“It’s easy for you, thrown up on a pedestal and given all the support you could ask for to do the right thing! Where would the wizarding world be if their great savior Harry Potter had been given to the Malfoys instead of some muggles? Where would the champion of muggleborns be if he had the same superiority complex literally beaten into him every day for a literal
Harry squeezed Malfoy's hand, drawing Malfoy's attention to them again. Satisfaction pooled in Harry's chest like a victory when Malfoy still didn't pull his hand away.
Potter’s mouth opens and closes a couple of times. Draco can practically hear the rusty gears turning at half speed.
Draco huffs somewhat at the thought, amused, crosses his legs as he relaxes into a chair to watch Teddy play. He always seemed to enjoy constructing things, something Draco isn’t sure he understands. Likely, it’s just toddler development. Although perhaps the interest will persist and Teddy might wind up an architect of some sort one day.
Draco shook his head. "No, it just takes a moment to work. I'm sure we'll all be smacked upside the head in a second like Slughorn said and spend the rest of the day grinning like fools."
Instead of answering, Harry pushed back onto Draco's cock, but Draco quickly took over, grabbing at Harry's hips and thrusting into him repeatedly without stopping. Harry grabbed at the nearby sink for support as he bent forward, hand dropping to his own swollen cock to start pumping in time with Draco's thrusts. It was fast and it was ecstasy, and it was only a few more minutes of furious fucking and stifling moans until Harry found himself trying to catch his release as he climaxed. His muscles contracted around Draco's cock, and it was barely a second more until Draco was gasping, too, his hips stuttering with his own orgasm.
