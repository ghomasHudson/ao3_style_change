“It’s really not,” Potter said with another laugh. Draco tried not to let how it affected him show in his face. Potter was playing with the buttons on the phone now, his eyes on the screen.
“Hold on,” Potter says, with a small smile he’s obviously trying to hide. He pulls his hand from Draco’s grip (which Draco lets go of very very reluctantly) and disappears from the room.
the whole having to get out of bed thing. He’d managed to avoid the last six weeks of eighth year gatherings by hiding in his wonderfully warm sheets with the invisibility cloak on top. But now Ron had finally caught on and he wasn’t taking no for an answer.
Harry pulls the spleen towards him and tries to talk to Draco once more. “If you want to talk about – “
“Yes, well, I was only thinking of the boy’s education.” Slughorn says sheepishly. “He’s much easier to teach this way. But of course you’re right. We’ll do the testing overnight and administer to Mr. Malfoy in the morning if all goes well.”
sound that came out of his mouth. And there was no denying Potter heard it because, one - it was LOUD, and the room dissolved into giggles immediately, and two - Potter paused what he was doing, only for a second (thank Merlin), but it was enough. Enough to confirm that Draco had been terribly terribly exposed.
When their lips finally release each other, Malfoy is panting openly into Harry’s neck, letting Harry hold him up. And that gives Harry more satisfaction than the kiss itself.
Draco nods, or at least he thinks he does. He certainly decides to nod, but whether his body follows through with the action is another thing entirely.
When Harry awakens, the danger seems to have passed. Unless the attackers were the ones who transported him to a couch, covered him with a blanket and left an ice-pack on his head. He looks around as he comes to properly and finds Malfoy staring at him from the chaise lounge opposite. He looks as if he’s about to say something so Harry waits. Although, his words aren’t what Harry expects.
Draco did, expecting to see the ugly red welts he’d successfully avoided looking at for the last year.  He never expected to find–
things?” Pansy repeated, her face lighting up - that was never a good sign. “Like a tingly feeling in your - “
This time, he knows what’s coming, but he’s still unexplainably drawn to the light. So, he has no choice (okay he could resist if he really wanted to, fine, but it’s not that simple, okay?) but to walk towards it. Sure enough, he finds who other than Draco Malfoy in bed jacking himself the fuck off under the covers.
There was Professor Flitwick, perched on his tower of books, looking right at them. Well not right at them, he clearly hadn’t seen Potter’s slipping manoeuvre, but he was
Malfoy’s nostrils flared, and Harry suspected he was considering the consequences of punching Harry in the middle of a classroom but after a moment he relaxed, dropped the tension from his shoulders and nodded at Harry. “Thank you,” he said so quietly Harry wondered if he had imagined it.
“You don’t - “ Draco started to repeat, frustration leaking into his voice. “What are your symptoms? How has this mystery curse affected you?”
moaned (moaned™). And it was not something he could easily cover up. It was an all-out, no holds barred, moan.
“What?” Harry’s head whips up so fast, he doesn’t even have time to panic over the thought of seeing Malfoy’s face so closely again. Luckily Malfoy has already turned away.
“Speaking of duty, there are some old conservatives arriving that I need to schmooze. Harry - good to see you as always. Healer Malfoy, glad to have made your acquaintance.” The Minister took her leave politely, striding over to the entrance and greeting two elderly men who appeared to already be arguing with one of the waiters.
“Harry,” Pansy said in her sickly sweet voice - nothing good ever came from that. “Why don’t you dare Draco? He hasn’t had a turn yet. I’m sure he feels very left out.”
Their fireplace was alight but not just with orange flame, a myriad of blues and pinks and greens and purples intertwined and wove themselves through the fire, a careful dance of light and colour. Harry’s eyes lowered to take in Draco, sitting before the fireplace, his wand rising and falling in time with the patterns of the fire.
Harry supposed there was nothing else for it. He pulled out his wand and walked over to the closet. He opened the door just a crack at first - of course, no boggart appeared - before pulling it wide open. He turned to Teddy. “See, no boggart. You’re safe here, Teddy.”
Potter’s eyebrows disappear into his ragged overgrown hair. “Ah, but perhaps tomorrow night?” He says with almost a smirk. Draco thinks it rather suits him.
He leaves Anne with all the muggle money he has on him which must be a lot because her eyes get watery and Draco has to take a step backwards to avoid a hug. She must think he’s being generous towards her because he’s a good person. But he’s not. He has used her patronage at dinner for selfish reasons and all the muggle money she holds is the product of guilt and guilt alone. Nothing pure about it. Draco hates that she thinks otherwise.
There was something to his tone that made Harry want to continue. To see how far they could take the conversation before they ended up fighting. There was a thrill to a conversation like that. But Teddy was here so:
They returned five minutes later, Parvati’s lipstick significantly lighter than it had been when they entered and Greengrass’s lips bright red.
When he realises the futility of his mission he changes direction and heads down to Slughorn’s office. It’s desperate, Harry knows, but Slughorn had given him some cryptic clues early on, maybe he might let something further slip, something that will slide the last puzzle piece of this mystery into place.
confident than he was in eighth year, back when he’d given Draco a - well, last November third. And Draco was only just now noticing the shadow of stubble around Potter’s chin - so light that it was as if he’d shaved the night before to allow time for the shadow to form before morning. Which seemed much too carefully planned and deliberate for someone like Potter.
expected) is that Malfoy withdraws his hand from his underwear. Although, it turns out it’s not too much of a disappointment at all as it allows Harry to see the outline of Malfoy’s dick unobstructed and quite clearly through the outline of his pants. Harry’s not religious but JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Enough said. That’s really the only coherent thoughts Harry has regarding Malfoy’s dick.
Harry hesitated, looking back at Malfoy’s bed. He already knew he wouldn’t be going back there. Not tonight. He suspected someone had cursed it, and he was already planning his revenge for when he found out who, but for now, there wasn’t anything else to do but sleep. And he wasn’t going to get much on the floor.
Draco walked out before he could give into temptation to change his mind and look. But when Potter called out after him, with a bitter “Bye, then, Malfoy,” his disappointment was clear anyway. Draco felt the same, of course, but it was useless. Not with what he had already planned for this year. He didn’t bother to respond.
“They’re elegant looking,” Harry explained lamely. Draco’s fingers were long and delicate and his hands looked like they’d be soft to hold, albeit a touch boney. Not that Harry was thinking of holding Draco’s hands. He’d just happened to notice is all.
An afternoon potions double is certainly not how Harry would choose to spend his afternoon if he had a choice. His confidence in brewing potions has diminished almost entirely since the incident with Malfoy. He can barely add a prescribed benign ingredient to his cauldron without his hand shaking. The only positive to it is that he has plenty of time to monitor Malfoy. Although it’s quite difficult to concentrate both on not accidentally creating a potion that could hurt someone and looking for every movement – every blink, every twitch – that Malfoy makes.
“Have I been - “ Draco starts to repeat and then freezes. His whole face crumples. Sags. Harry recognises the expression - defeat. “You don’t know.”
Pansy just laughed at that. She obviously didn’t understand how close she was to being hexed. “So are you coming?”
“Patient and understanding friend. I know,” Pansy interrupts, her teasing smile back along with her stiff, stubborn eyebrows. She’s still worried. It irritates Draco. “Now eat it before I hex your oblivious head right off your body.”
Potter didn’t say anything for a moment. With his eyes closed, the silence felt longer for Draco. He couldn’t decipher what Potter was doing - until he felt a heavy weight next to him. Draco’s eyes jerked open in surprise. Potter was lying next to him.
Potter turns from the stovetop, and his eyes trail to Draco’s Pepper covered ankle, while Draco’s eyes watch a flicker of sauce dribble down Potter’s apron to land on a small, flashing version of the word, dickhead.
Luckily, Potter didn’t catch on to the meaning. He shuffled on the spot. “Oh, okay then. If you change your mind, let – “
Harry sucked in a surprised breath as he finally realised Malfoy’s intention. “Yes,” he couldn’t help but agree, “that would be very sporting.”
Harry’s annoyed huff is drowned out by Ron’s chuckles. “Thanks,” he says sarcastically to his best friend before directing his perfected glare at Malfoy. “You’re a complete arse.”
Harry pulled back immediately. “I’m sorry. Is that not okay?” He asked, ever the literal perfect specimen of human Draco had ever encountered.
After their last class of the day, Harry leaves Malfoy safely with Ron and Hermione for dinner and heads to the Shrieking Shack once more. His wolf senses are already strong, sniffing out the dishes appearing in the Great Hall, even from outside the castle. He hungers to turn around but maintains his straight path to the Shrieking Shack, only pausing at the foot of the Whomping Willow to stare out across the Black Lake. He managed to convince Hermione to increase his Wolfsbane dosage by half today. Hopefully it will improve the wolf’s discipline.
Harry breathed in again and closed his eyes, relaxing in the comforting smell of his husband. “Yes, yes you are.”
“How thoughtful of you, Healer Malfoy. Unfortunately at events like this when everyone is off duty, I find I’m still very much on, so I think it’s best to keep a clear head. Perhaps Harry could use one?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. The students all looked up. Malfoy nodded with the slightest tilt of his head.
eager but it was probably eight glasses late to try to act coy. He recalibrated, stared Draco right in the eye and gave his honest answer (albeit a little slurred): “I’d love to go on a date with you, Draco.”
When the high subsided and Draco’s cock was well and truly spent, he dropped down to the bed beside his now come-covered edition of The Daily Prophet, slowly regaining control of his breathing. He could hear Potter still doing the same.
Draco snorted. He’d already spelled it out and now he was going to have to break it down letter by letter. It didn’t make sense that someone so intelligent could be so slow on the pick up. But Harry always was the humble one.
“If you want romance, you can talk to me any other day of the year,” Potter said with the hint of the attitude he’d had when he’d answered the phone.
Harry jams the eyeball into a jar and slams the lid shut before it can roll out again. “Are they dangerous?” he asks, eyeing the smashed vials by their shoes.
The dinner is going surprisingly well. Draco thinks he might have to rethink his thoughts on the meal altogether. Sitting here with Potter is nice. It’s something he could get used to, he thinks. Something he could grow to look forward to. That is, until the actual dinner arrives.
“Wait, Potter,” Draco said, stopping him, “I didn’t mean – Look, I’m sorry.” He sighed, like he really didn’t want to have to say it: “I’d like you to stay.”
Two women pass through what appears to be solid wall metres away from where Harry and Malfoy stand. One of them pulls out a cigarette immediately and lights it up with a wave of her wand.
Unfortunately, Harry Potter isn’t known for his patience. With Malfoy not at lunch, yet again, and Harry wondering where in Merlin’s name he could be, yet again, he has an all too obvious thought. The Marauder’s Map! Why didn’t he think to use it before? It’s been sitting in his trunk unused all year.
“Not tonight,” Harry whispered back before he knew what he was saying. Draco didn’t reply after that so Harry hoped perhaps he hadn’t heard anyway. He pulled the covers up around Draco, not brave enough to handle the clothes or shoes situation, and finally made his exit.
Harry kept his eyes focused on the doily in the centre of his table, tracing the pattern, hoping desperately that Malfoy wouldn’t spot him, and even more so that Malfoy would be seated in a dark corner of the tea shop, far away from Harry.
Harry twists around pulling out his wand. “Expelliarmus,” he shouts automatically. He sticks a hand out of the invisibility cloak to catch the wand that flies through the air, becoming visible as it leaves its owner’s hand.
“I’m afraid I don’t recall,” Draco said, keeping his soft voice and sprinkling a bit of innocence on top.
?” Harry asks softly. Because Draco’s face looks exactly as it did that time he discovered him in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. The night Harry had cursed him.
“No.” Draco crossed his arms. “If I don’t leave the dormitory, I can’t talk to Potter and I won’t - “
“It doesn’t matter now, anyway,” Hermione says, putting her notes aside. She looks up. “I could have used you here, you know. The Magic Creatures Department have taken over the raid.”
“You’re not going to stop, are you?” Malfoy asks as he easily takes down Harry’s King for a second time, although he phrases it so it’s not really a question at all.
“Maybe,” Harry agreed reluctantly. “I don’t know. Look, Draco, all I can tell you is how I feel now.”
Harry placed his own words easily. But couldn’t quite place their relevance now. “What do you mean?”
He’s no longer in Malfoy’s dorm. Instead, he’s standing in what appears to be an endless corridor surrounded by dusty shelving that towers above him. There’s something familiar about this place. If he could just –
“If you want to go, say the word and we go,” Ron said, and Harry would’ve known he meant it even without the Veritaserum.
Draco smiled at Harry. “Perhaps you should focus less on your work, and more on your family,” he whispered back, his words stinging despite his polite tone. “Teddy, I mean,” he added.
?” He jerks up the long black sleeve of his tunic crudely to reveal the Dark Mark. It twitches under Harry’s gaze.
Harry felt himself imitating the smile on his own face. He settled his head down on Draco’s chest, wrapping his arms around his husband. How wonderful it felt to finally be warm again.
Malfoy starts to walk to Harry and Harry knows he’s screwed. The room is so small, there’s nowhere for him to hide. He gives up. “Why did you tell me not to, then?”
“Yes,” Harry admits. When he set out to follow Malfoy, he hadn’t really given much thought to anything other than his determination to find him. Now actually facing Malfoy in his non-confrontational state, he does feel a little guilty.
Thank all of Merlin’s magic that he moves away because Harry does not know how to deal with such a provocative phrase. Okay it’s not that provocative but in CONTEXT. It’s proof Malfoy knows. And sort of encouraging. And well, terribly intimidating as well. Because that means…well, Harry doesn’t want to think about the exact implications of all that. But suffice to say now he gets to enjoy the rest of DADA with a fucking intolerable boner. Perfect. Fucking perfect.
Draco couldn’t see a way out of the question so he kept his answer non-committal - he couldn’t have Potter thinking the
“What do you think you’re doing?” Draco demanded, stepping between Potter and his trunk. He couldn’t have Potter going through his things, his clothes, his
“I’m sorry,” Harry apologises, surprised to see Malfoy’s eyes watering. “You really should go to St Mungo’s and–”
waiting.” Potter dropped his gaze, and his Auror likeness along with it. “You never returned the favour, you know?”
Harry crosses his legs for the rest of the lesson and tries only to glance at Malfoy every 20 or so seconds. It takes great personal restraint. He’s a little (okay, very, are you happy now?) disappointed that Malfoy doesn’t look his way again.
“Nah I don’t drink - “ Harry started to say but something in Draco’s expression, something in his voice, made Harry change his mind. A vulnerability that wasn’t there before. “Thank you,” he said instead, taking the cup, his fingers brushing against Draco’s in the process. The contact made Harry’s skin tingle. “See you tomorrow,” he said quickly, already hurrying out the door.
“Stay still,” Draco said, a hand coming out to rest on Harry’s shoulder, holding him in place. With his other hand, he passed his wand over Harry’s chest. Harry tried not to make it obvious when a shiver ran through him - he wasn’t so sure it was to do with Draco’s wand and not his touch.
“Shortly after your potion hit me,” he explains, “I split into two halves of myself.” He takes another breath. “According to Slughorn, it divided me into my light and dark side. But Madam Pomfrey thinks that’s a little simplistic, and I agree. Look how selfish I’ve been, wasting your time, when I’m only going to turn back into someone else. It’s not fair to you.”
The voice is late tonight, so late the wolf’s fur prickles with relief when it finally reaches his ears. The song is wordless but there’s no ignoring the siren’s call. Yearning floods straight through the wolf and into Harry’s mind like a slap in the face. The song hurts, if only because of the distance, and yet Harry does not want it to end. He’ll gladly remain as a wolf forever to stay locked in this moment.
Draco stops, suddenly realising his pace has quickened significantly so that he is almost running. He has no idea what direction he’s going in but he has a sinking thought it’s a path that will almost certainly lead him to a hospital. He turns around and walks in the other direction, ignoring the pull from his legs to do the opposite. He might be too late. He has to find a safe place to apparate
The first thing that Draco notices when Potter opens the door is the grand staircase just beyond the entrance way. It’s almost as wide as the one in Malfoy Manor, and at least three times the width of the small much more practical staircase in his current two storey apartment.
When the rushing stops, he’s standing back in D – Malfoy’s dorm, the walls closer than he remembered. And Malfoy is leaning up against the bed post facing him, a very Malfoy like (and completely un-Draco like) smirk on his face. Harry isn’t quite sure how to respond to that. He isn’t used to being alone with
A small, frail woman opens the door a crack, her eyes widening when she spots the Auror badges displayed in Harry and Hermione’s hands. Her eyes flicker between them.
Draco didn’t expect Potter to have the same appreciation for astrology as he did but it hadn’t even been a minute. He should have realised Potter had the patience of a toddler.
Hermione appears at the top of the stairs minutes later, hair wild, arms crossed. “Ronald Weasley, it’s past midnight. What – Harry?” Her face softens and she descends the stairs to reach them both, staring down at Harry with concern. He must look terrible.
Except it couldn’t just be a kiss, not when they were both naked, and the proximity made their cocks touch. If it was still a kiss, it was the extreme of a kiss - whatever the next level of kiss was after a French kiss…German? It was that and then some. Draco hadn’t realised Potter had been holding back before but he could tell now. And when Potter grazed his teeth over Draco’s bottom lip, Draco could have sworn he heard himself moan “More!” into Potter’s mouth.
Draco stared back at Harry’s soft eyes in confusion. He hadn’t cast any spells. What magic could Harry mean?
“Wait, are you saying…” Malfoy slaps a hand to his head as if he’s just thought of something, but exaggerated to a ridiculous degree. “Gosh, Potter, surely you can’t mean you’ve been dreaming about me…in compromising positions?”
The following Monday, Hermione isn’t at breakfast which isn't unexpected, she's been living at the library since the crack of dawn on Saturday. But when she also doesn’t turn up for lunch, Harry can’t help his own disappointment. He knows it was wishful thinking but he had thought she might have an answer for him by now, that Hermione’s trusty books would pull them out of another scrape. And they might still. He just needs to be patient.
“I didn’t say it bothered me,” interrupted Potter. “I asked whether you call all your patients at 11.30pm or just me?”
. It was a thin gold band that was far less extravagant than Draco’s usual taste, which meant he had picked it out especially for Harry. It was simple but with a slight imperfect curve to the band that Harry took a liking to immediately. It was perfect.
And right now, his priority was Harry Potter’s cock. Because the dreamy bastard had stopped laughing and was stroking himself, naked on the desk, staring right at Draco - although Draco suspected he couldn’t see much without his glasses. Still, it was lewd and debauched and utterly fantastic.
“Pansy,” Draco interrupted loudly. “My mother was looking for you earlier. Perhaps you should go find her?” It wasn’t exactly a lie. Narcissa was always looking for Pansy – called her the daughter she would never have. It was meant to be a playful joke about Draco’s sexuality, but Draco had stopped seeing the humour in it after the third or fourth time it was said.
“I do.” Harry interrupts quickly. He should have just said it. Draco doesn’t deserve any more suffering.
Harry stopped stroking himself immediately and Draco was ready to panic and crawl up into a ball of embarrassment until he saw Harry was just reaching for his glasses.
Harry tightens his grip on his wand and moves through the wall barrier. The inside of the warehouse comes into view, as well as at least one hundred people. Even though he’s under the invisibility cloak, Harry instinctively ducks behind a nearby packing box, running straight into Malfoy.
Harry saw the trap before Malfoy did, but he had no way of warning him. “Yeah,” Malfoy said, “that’d be– ”
Draco found himself almost constantly thinking of ways to outsmart, and outmanoeuvre Potter, the golden child. Everyone loved Potter. Worshipped him, even. It wasn’t fair. Was Draco the only one who could see there wasn’t anything special about Potter apart from the scar on his head? And that had been the Dark Lord’s doing.
From Harry’s vantage point by the door, he could clearly see Draco simply lying on his back alone under the bed, but Teddy standing above seemed convinced by the theatrics, especially when Draco let loose some colourful smoke from his wand that rose up above the bed.
“Draco,” Harry said moving forward to stand in front of Draco, “You’re still here.” He sounded relieved.
Draco scoffed. “Of course not. I’m simply saying if the man doesn’t know the proper stages of courting, it was never going to work.”
“So…Monday? Am I invited?” Potter asks, back to his typical direct fashion. It’s really quite unsettling.
Malfoy ignores this and continues his rant which Harry isn’t sure is directed at him or not. “I can’t imagine you’re very susceptible to an imperius charm? I was going to use a first year, but since I can’t fucking kill you…although if I can’t even perform a simple killing curse, imperio might be – argh…How do I get rid of him?”
“My intended guest clearly isn’t coming so it’s not like I have anything better to do,” Malfoy said, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
The words sit in the air between them. Harry returns his gaze to the sky above them, unsure what to say. Of course, he had always figured Malfoy’s cockiness to be masking his insecurity in some form, but he didn’t expect
“We’re supposed to shake hands now before the match starts,” Malfoy said. He took a step closer to Harry.
“Is it so hard to describe an ingredient without referencing your personal experience with it? I swear all the Potions books we have in this library are written by Gilderoy Lockhart clones,” she says, pushing away
“Who’s the apprenticeship with?” asks Slughorn immediately when Hermione corners him after class the next day. Harry and Ron have quickly donned the invisibility cloak and returned to the room to eavesdrop. They figure Harry’s presence would be just a tad too obvious.
Harry watches the side of Malfoy’s face curl upwards but there’s no humour in his smile. “I’m a Death Eater.”
Looking around at the faces approaching behind his best friends; Ginny, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, Hagrid, Molly, and more; Harry realises he is probably the only one whose hearing was affected by the blast. Three years of secretly dating have been exposed to the entire Great Hall in one shouted confession.
There’s plenty of question he wants to ask, but he’s not so sure he’s ready to hear the answers for them yet. So, he starts with something easy.
“Yeah she…I’m glad.” Potter says, seeming unable to string a full sentence together. He looks over to the Doctor. “Sorry, I’m interrupting. I’ll wait outside.”
“Thank you, Harry. I look forward to seeing you in class next week.” Malfoy walks away slowly, hands in pocket, leaving Harry, his feet frozen to the floor.
Of course Pansy doesn’t fail to notice this. But she doesn’t say anything which Draco is thankful for. Just one more day.
“Maybe you can warm them up?” Harry suggested with a not-so-subtle raise of his eyebrows, leaning up again.
Draco or Malfoy, Harry isn’t sure what to call him anymore, is out of school for two days. Harry searches for him at every meal in the Great Hall, at every shared class. He even visits the dormitory on the fourth floor but the same door no longer leads to that room with the fireplace. It’s just a supply closet now.
Harry’s hands traced their path up Draco’s chest, along each scar, as if he were magically creating them.
Harry stands up quickly, his heart pounding in his ears. He hardly feels it when Hermione puts a hand on his shoulder.
Harry wants to laugh but no sound comes out. Slughorn is wrong. This has caused plenty of harm, to Draco of course, but now to Harry as well. Because nothing hurts quite so much as loss. And it appears Harry has truly lost Draco Malfoy.
He walks a little closer than he usually does. Instead of standing at the foot of the bed he comes up to the side to study the scars. They’ve obviously faded with time as there is no harshness to them, but they’re still there. Harry supposes they’ll never disappear. Not when they were caused by dark magic. Harry’s dark magic.
Greengrass looked back at him with an innocent smile. “You never specified we had to do it in front of you.”
Malfoy takes the tie and whispers something that sounds like “Thanks” but can’t be because, well, this is Malfoy. He effortlessly transforms the colour and spells it to tie around his neck with one graceful flick of his wand.
As much as they argue, Harry is glad to work with Hermione. He trusts her completely, and though he won’t admit it, he relies on her to pull him back sometimes. Like now.
As Zabini walks away, Harry tries to subtly sneak a peek at Malfoy’s reaction beside him. His face is blank, unreadable. Malfoy turns around and walks back through the doorway, leaving the door open. Harry takes this as an invitation to follow Malfoy in.
Draco looks out to the lake beside them. “I was hoping you’d never see that side of me. I was afraid you’d go looking for it.” He pauses and then corrects himself: “For me.”
Harry dropped his hand. “Sorry.” He placed his hands under his thighs to keep himself from fidgeting further.
Harry stares at the question mark, utterly perplexed. Never in his five years of using the Marauder’s Map has he ever seen a question mark next to anyone’s name.
There’s a glint in Malfoy’s eye then. He likes that. He grabs a hold of Harry’s shirt and flips them around, pushing Harry against the corridor wall now. He leans in, so Harry can feel the heat of his breath. “Maybe I
Startled, Draco looks up to find a waiter hovering over him expectantly. He drops the menu he has been twiddling with and shakes his head. “No.” He says firmly.
“Then I look forward to the next accusation.” Malfoy redirects his gaze to the fireplace beside him, waving his hand lazily in Harry’s direction. “Goodbye, Potter. Verity will show you out.”
Ron pouts as he wipes sleep-gunk from his eyes. “Yeah, but we’d need help and I’m not asking Hermione.”
Instead of asking the obvious, as Harry could only imagine the horrible circumstances in which Draco would have been fed the potion, he asked: “What kind of things?”
“I’m bedridden with a horrid case of splattergroit.” Pansy says, attempting to prove this by scrunching up her face unattractively.
Although Harry recognised the motion, things didn’t really click until he saw Draco pull the little ring box from his pocket.
The bed isn’t made, the blinds are hanging diagonally because they jammed when Harry tried an opening charm two months ago, and there are owl feathers scattered all over the carpet. Harry raises his wand to collect the feathers but Malfoy turns back and puts a hand over Harry’s.
Potter, again clearly having no understanding of pureblood traditions, or ever just manners in general really, barges straight into the house, searching on his own for the kitchen before Draco has time to even offer a tour.
Draco broke the kiss and pulled his head back slightly to look at Harry. “I– I’m not– I mean–“ Draco’s earlier blush returned. “This is my, er, first time.”
Draco elbowed him in the ribs softly. “How did Potter even send you? He’s been in his bed all night.”
Harry flew into a dive, approaching the ground. Had Malfoy sent someone in his place to play the match? How could that be called a gesture of good sportsmanship? If anything, it was a gesture of cowardice. Harry’s feet hit the ground and he quickly dismounted, walking across the grass to meet the man directly in the centre of the pitch.
His mind is still wandering when he enters the Transfiguration classroom so it’s not until Harry slumps into his seat that he notices the platinum blonde head in the front row. He audibly exhales.
He looked over to Potter so he could fix him with a scowl, but couldn’t quite get his face to participate upon witnessing Potter’s own expression. He had a stupid
“And why would you expect your arch-enemy to show up to your little Gryffindor party? I get it, Potter. It’s fine.”
Harry looks to Hermione for support. “That was particularly loud, Mrs Dunberg. Perhaps if we were to take a look in–”
Malfoy flinched a little when his eyes landed on Harry and he took in the mop of blonde hair, his hair, but if he was surprised, he covered it well. “Why didn’t you call, Potter? I could have given you the name of my hairdresser if you wanted to resemble me so badly. You’ve got the cut all wrong.”
Draco appears to be back. “Can I kiss you?” he asks again. Merlin.  How can the same words from only earlier in the same night seem so different?  Harry is under no moral instruction to decline this time. But now, he’s not so sure he wants to. Because he doesn’t know Malfoy. Just Draco. And despite appearances, this isn’t Draco.
“That was you? I should have guessed. You never miss an opportunity to save my skin.” Malfoy’s lips quirked upward for the smallest moment before his composure returned. “Well, it was nice seeing how the other side lives. I suppose I must get back to it.”
“I don’t think we should raid the Dunbergs' house.” It’s out of Harry’s mouth before he even realises he’s changed his mind.
He dropped back down onto the hospital bed. Again, he found himself missing his sight so he could have a good proper sulk at the ceiling. Potter loved him and Draco should be jumping for joy, but it had all gotten too complicated. Draco wished he’d never even touched a soulmate potion. But now, how could he forget the brown eyes of Potter’s soulmate?
Hufflepuff’s eighth year common room was the most logical choice for the location, partially because the teachers would never suspect it, but mostly because it was closest to the kitchens. Ernie Macmillan had discovered early on in the year that the kitchen housed firewhisky for the teachers with only a simple anti-student spell protecting them. A lucky loophole meant the spell didn’t take into account students returning for an eighth year and so they all had access to a cache of unlimited firewhisky.
Draco knew he was probably being a bit too harsh, but it was the only defence he had to fall back on. He couldn’t give Potter any slight evidence that pointed towards his true feelings - otherwise he might as well confess them at the top of his lungs.
And then Draco climbed up onto the desk, between them, as if he climbed on desks all day. Just jumped straight up as if it were as normal as breathing. Harry found he couldn’t give a thought to the fate of his paperwork, not when Draco was basically crawling over it to him. Merlin. Draco Malfoy was climbing over his desk.
I’m not easy. Quite frankly, it’s insulting that you think you can trick me into your bed with filthy letters.
It’s much the same as the previous night except without the eye contact. Despite this dream Malfoy not acknowledging Harry at all, he still ends on that same stretched out and completely destroyed word: “Potter.”
“No, you don’t,” Parkinson said, “because you all keep cheating. I know you were lying about McGonagall last week, Dean.”
He knew exactly whose laughter and exactly where from. There was no need to look up. But as always, he did.
Travers glares at Harry. “Wolfbane Potion is very complicated to brew with expensive and difficult to source ingredients. Are you suggesting the Ministry turns a profit from generously making it available tor registered werewolves?”
Although that didn’t happen, of course, one morning, at those very twin sinks, Draco did suggest they try out a new restaurant the coming Saturday and that Harry should dress for the occasion. And Harry knew exactly what that meant. But he kept himself composed and agreed to the suggestion - his own proposal dinner - as casually as he could.
Draco supposed he would have to be the brave one. He had never been before. But even though he was in unfamiliar territory with unfamiliar people, he somehow felt comfortable. Felt safe. So, he leaned forward and planted a kiss on Harry Potter, to the cheers and applause of the entire Weasley family.
Draco searched for the constellation again but still couldn’t pick the pattern. “One light isn’t going to make a difference.”
Luckily, the waiter didn’t push it any further. She smiled sympathetically and moved to the next table, leaving Harry with just his red face and Draco Malfoy for company.
Harry didn’t let himself read into that too much. He’d already decided Draco was not flirting. Just tipsy. He turned his back on drunk Draco quickly and headed down to the Manor’s Sitting Room, careful to keep his gaze fixed ahead. Why did Draco have to be a giddy drunk? He could hardly fight Draco like this. Perhaps it would be better just to leave now. Why, then, was he not heading for the door?
Hermione sat down on the edge of the bed – Draco could feel her weight. “Harry doesn’t trust me anymore,” she says gently. “He pretends everything is the same but he came out of the war different. It’s like he’s always looking for a betrayal or a lie even when there’s nothing to fear.”
Draco smiles. It’s a nice idea, and of course Draco is all for it but - “I don’t know if he’ll still be interested by the time I get out,
Draco wasn’t sure if he did or not until Harry licked his lips. Licked his fucking lips. Did Draco mention Harry was a BASTARD? And Draco’s shaking hand was heading straight for his erection through his trousers.

Best way to get me is on tumblr as queenofthyme. (not to be confused with queen-of-thyme which appears to actually be a tumblr blog dedicated to herbs...yeah that's definitely not me.

“No.” Was that a dig? There was nothing wrong with silk pyjamas. A fact Potter should already know having had his own pair at Hogwarts, not that Draco ever received any thanks for that. “Don’t presume to - ‘
Midway through their fifth game of exploding snap, Harry recalls something Malfoy said to Zabini earlier. He pulls his eyes away from the game pile to gauge Malfoy’s reaction. “So, you don’t hate me?”
When Potter finished his glass, he opened his mouth to say something - so Draco quickly cut him off, certain he wouldn’t like whatever Potter intended. “Would you like to dance?”
Still, looking around the pitch with enhanced clarity, Draco was rather confident about winning this match. Especially since he was able to spot the snitch within seconds. And he wasn’t going to waste time and give Potter any opportunity to win.
‘Bothers’ was the wrong word. It didn’t really capture the intensity of which Draco enjoyed Potter’s company despite the fact that it also left him in complete and irreversible agony. But Draco was hardly going to point that out.
Potter’s soft laughter through the phone line did nothing to help Draco’s painfully hard cock. “I can’t quite work you out, Malfoy.”
Harry continued filling orders as fast as he could, allowing Draco to remain watching. He figured Draco might need some time before he braved the coffee machine again. Harry did feel a little self-conscious with Draco’s watching him though. Those eyes followed him like a hawk, a fierce concentration on Harry’s hands as he worked the machine, and a strange lingering glance at Harry’s face when he dealt with customers, always with his best smile.
Harry starts to follow automatically, his head still spinning too fast for him to function properly.
“If I did, I wouldn’t need to be down here asking the Auror department to actually do their job, would I?”
Harry reached out behind him and found Draco’s hand. He held it tightly and squeezed. “Let me show you.”
Harry quickly turned back to his doily. ‘Nothing.” The desire to return to biting his nails was strong but Harry resisted. He’d need to be brave if he was going to meet his soulmate in front of Draco fucking Malfoy. He settled on tapping his fingers under the table instead.
And before Draco even had time to blink - and he certainly wasn’t about to do so now and miss the sight in front of him - Potter’s cock, his naked, hard - Draco’s earlier suspicions were correct - cock was ready and waiting. And Draco didn’t think it was fair that Potter, as eager as he
Draco considered denying it. But how was he was going to back that one up? He was a teenager. Of COURSE he took care of his fucking boner. How was that even worthy of a theory?
Draco held back a snort. Of course Potter wasn’t leaving. It was November the effing third. “Neither am I.”
Finally, Hermione’s speech seemed to be drawing to a close, her relief to be getting off stage obvious. “Lastly, I’d like to remind everyone that we are still accepting further donations for tonight’s charity. The founder of Second Life is here with us tonight and will be doubling all donations made from his own pocket. I’ll handover over to him now so he can explain a little bit more about how Second Life supports refugees.”
Draco felt every skin cell in his face light up. He dropped his head and stared down at his sheets. “Why are you back so early?”
Malfoy raises his wand, casting a silent spell across the lawn. It becomes obvious what it is when the grass at Harry’s feet, and only Harry’s feet, flutters tellingly – a tracking spell. Harry looks back up to see Malfoy making a beeline for him.
Draco looks up with a smirk. But it’s gentle. Nothing like sixth year. “Are we friends now, Potter?” His tone is light again, but there’s something more behind it. He isn’t sure of Harry’s motives.
When Potter brought his teeth into the mix as well - grazing them lightly against Draco’s neck like he knew
“The muggle primary school?” Hermione queries, making quick eye contact with Harry. It’s not unheard of, but quite peculiar for a wizard to work in a muggle profession.
Harry dropped his head immediately, not wishing to be caught staring. Draco would discover who the letter was from soon enough anyway. Harry had been stupid and brave enough to sign it…thirty seconds ago when it still seemed like a good idea. Now, it just seemed rather foolhardy.
“I don’t know, Harry. The spells will activate as soon as Malfoy has a visitor. That could be any time.”
They both watched the younger Harry, alone in the bathroom. He still sat on his knees where he been pushed aside by Snape, frozen, even as water and blood swirled around him. His tears had been replaced with an empty expression, a numbness Harry would never forget.
No, not Azkaban. But still somewhere cold. Surrounded by death. Trapped. Indefinitely. “It feels a little bit that way,” Draco admits.
No such touch was forthcoming of course. But Draco could feel Harry moving closer to him - maybe if he pushed his ass back just a little further…
“Oh sorry, I’m being awfully rude, aren’t I?” Pansy said, missing the point. She turned to Potter and looked him up and down openly – as if she hadn’t already been doing so out of the corner of her eye. “I’m Pansy Parkinson,” she said, holding out a hand.
The Ministry foyer had been converted into a ballroom of sorts, with a wide-open dance space that was yet to be filled. It usually took a while, and a couple of drinks, for the first brave couple to make their way to the dance floor. Draco wasn’t usually so brave, but he didn’t want to waste any time tonight.
“Yes, fine, thank you” Draco responded automatically, not turning around. He wasn’t here to make friends, and his pride dictated that he didn’t require anybody’s help.
Of course, this is when Harry loses his shit because Malfoy knows. Of course, he knows. Why the fuck would anyone come up to someone THEY NEVER SPEAK TO and ask, “Late Night?” unless they know that person is dreaming of them in a sexual manner every night and in just the most recent night jerked off to a memory of it and even moaned their name? No one. Ever. There is no other reason to say such a thing.
The rest of Harry’s shift passed quickly. He didn’t trust Draco to handle the machine again during the morning rush, but he did let him play around with it in the afternoon. Draco couldn’t make anything other than an espresso but at least he managed to get it all in the cup.
Now, Harry isn’t sure how he’s going to face Malfoy when they see each other in class. He’s become more and more obsessed with him and now that he’s seen his dick…Good lord. He’s in trouble. But unexpectedly it’s breakfast he needs to worry about.
Harry is actually rather exhilarated to see Malfoy the next day. Yes, okay, you got him, he’s still nervous, but much more excited. Now that he knows it’s real. And he knows Malfoy’s into it too. It’s far less embarrassing (although still a little embarrassing let’s be honest).
Travers ignores the question. “Lily is cleared for release, by the way. I’ve left the paperwork on your desk. I thought it best if you called the parents.”
The green paint turned out exactly as he wanted it, a perfect replica of its inspiration, Draco thought. He set it aside, eager for the chance to use it later. Since he had time to kill, he figured he may as well get a start on the background, so he began lightly sketching in the lines of the Quidditch pitch and the surrounding stadiums with a thin pencil. He’d just started drawing the hoops at the far side of the pitch when a voice pulled him out of focus.
As soon as class ends, Harry is pulling the Marauder’s Map from his pocket, determined to find out where Malfoy disappears to. He gestures for Ron to follow him to a small alcove behind a statue so they can spy undisturbed. “ I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
“I can’t – sorry.” Harry does feel a little guilty. He wants to respect Malfoy’s wishes of course but the pull of the mystery is great, tugging at him insistently.
She drops the wand but her knuckles still clench tightly around it. “Let me know on the hex,” she says to Harry before stepping back.
Malfoy tilts his head to stare at Harry openly, his face playfully chiding, a single eyebrow raised. “Please don’t turn this into a Quidditch metaphor, Potter. Besides, you always catch the snitch first.”
, that he had the hots for Potter. And they just kept on staring, like Draco would reveal something else, or that they might catch a glimpse of the evidence between his legs - evidence that he was keeping securely hidden.
Malfoy turned away back to his table, crossing his arms. “I suppose you wish Weasley was your soulmate,” he said quietly, the bitterness of his tone revealing something more than just his usual irritation. Malfoy was upset.
Malfoy snorts, finally losing his cool. He turns to Harry, anger now clear in the tightness of his jaw. “If your job is to terrorise good people, then you’re doing it brilliantly. Following the letter of the law, like a good little Ministry puppet.” His tone is mocking. Challenging.
Harry drops his wand hand immediately, Malfoy’s words cutting a little more than they should. He’ll be forever guilty for hurting Malfoy and by Malfoy’s own rules, he can never even apologise for it.
She pauses just for a moment to look over to Draco. “You didn’t order anything?” She asks, clearly noticing the absence of food on Draco’s side of the table. She goes to push one of her untouched plates towards him but Draco’s shakes his head.
his invite to dinner was a date. How could Draco interpret it any other way? They’d had lunch together alone before, plenty of times, but never dinner. Dinner meant something more than just colleagues or friends. At least it did to Harry. It had taken him weeks to work up the courage just to ask.
Draco hardly had time to consider the situation they’d gotten themselves into, particularly the proximity of Harry’s body to him in the small space, when Harry had leaned up and kissed him. Just like that. No warning. Draco’s face flared red immediately of course. Harry Potter was
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Harry manages to choke out, cold air enveloping his throat. He tries to make sense of what he’s seen. This Draco,
“That he’s boring,” Teddy said between chomps, “That there was no chemist-tree and - “ Teddy burst into giggles spraying some of his milk across the table.
“I know exactly what he was going to say,” Mrs Weasley said through pursed lips. She looked over at Harry and her face softened immediately. “Go on then, dear,” she encouraged.
Fuck. Malfoy wasn’t smirking anymore. He was looking at Harry like he wanted to devour him, and Harry supposed he was looking exactly the same way back. He took a step under the water, letter his Quidditch uniform become drenched, and leant an arm up against the shower wall behind Malfoy. Malfoy's eyes darted to Harry's gloved hand and his breathing hitched. Harry enjoyed that. He also enjoyed the way Malfoy’s eyelids fluttered before they closed shut, as Harry leaned closer in ready to claim the kiss he was previously denied.
The sip became longer when Potter made no move towards the dance floor. Draco wasn’t sure what Potter expected. If they were courting, Draco would have guided Potter there, but he still wasn’t quite sure what their situation was and whether that would be appropriate. So he kept sipping.
Potter flashed his teeth as he smiled wide. “I was just offering it to the most attractive man in the room.”
Next, McGonagall moves into action, swishing her wand and enveloping Lucius in a full body bind. “Somebody get this man out of my school and into Azkaban,” she says sternly.
Harry shivers, but whether it’s from the wind or nerves he cannot tell. He waits for Draco to say something, to explain, but nothing is forthcoming. Harry grits his teeth. Again, he tries to start with something easy. At least comparatively.
When he looked back down to Harry, he was pleased – and relieved – to find his cheeks were flaming as well. They may not have had the red hair, but they were certainly colour-matching the Weasley clan now.
“And here I was thinking you drank the blood of newborn muggles.” Potter said and then laughed. At his own joke. Merlin.
“Harry, while I trust your judgement, you know I can’t go to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures with
Malfoy laughs. “Well, we’re certainly not fucking, thanks to goody two shoes over here.” He jerks a hand to Harry.
“Of course,” Professor Slughorn says as he walks Harry to the door, “although I’m sure that will be obvious.”
A whispered “Alohomora,” and he’s in, the door creaking open softly but still loud enough for Harry to throw a paranoid look behind him before entering.
You see, the occupant is not sleeping. Not sleeping at all. Unless they have a sleep disorder that causes them to pant in their sleep. Or moan in their sleep. Or…er…make repetitive movements with their hand under their blankets.
He isn’t listening when Potter orders so he has no idea what to expect. He’s having another lovely time with Potter, who isn’t nearly as straight-edged as Draco once thought, until their dishes are served. It looks fishy, no really, like it might be actual fish. He knows Potter is watching him assess it so he puts on a smile and lifts his fork.
Granger and Weasley had disappeared early in the night. Draco had meant to make an excuse that he needed to study but Potter wouldn’t stop talking and he never found an out. Instead he sat there and listened, mostly quiet, memorising the details of Potter’s face.
Over Draco’s shoulder he catches a glimpse of the other Draco Malfoy, frantically straining against the rope from Hermione’s spell.
“Draco!” Potter’s yells suddenly, obviously catching sight of Draco’s open eyes. “Yeah, he’s awake. I’ll call you back,” Potter says into the phone as he comes around to Draco’s side.
He knows nothing. Draco is the only one who knows his own body. He’s in control. Why can nobody see that?
Draco blinked under Harry’s gaze. Now it was his turn for shock. He hadn’t thought much on it before, but Harry was right. He did like being an auror. And not just because he got to work with Harry Potter. He loved working on cases. He even liked the paperwork that followed. Most people didn’t. But Draco did. And when he thought about what was waiting for him at home (nothing) he really didn’t want to resign. Not one bit.
“Can I see?” Harry asks, the words flying out of his mouth recklessly. It’s stupid, anyway. Draco will never -
“Well, you’re not doing a very good job of it then, are you?” Malfoy bundles up the newspaper and throws it with enough force to hit Harry in the chest. “You need to fix this.”
Draco steps back from his mother and turns to Harry. They stare at each other a moment. There are so many things Harry wants to say but he can’t voice a single word. Draco presses his own wand into Harry’s hand and then drops his gaze. He sighs, straightens his shoulders and pivots. He steps around his mother to stand before the cage, hands shaking.
Malfoy doesn’t look up. “Do you know how many batches of Wolfsbane I have to make before the next full moon? Now that it’s free, I’m anticipating a 170% increase in Ministry supply interest. If I get an early enough start, I can make sure I have enough for 200% just in case. However, that relies on the Ministry’s supplies of moonstone which are–”
Harry makes eye contact with Slughorn as he answers, watching the Professor’s face carefully. “Malfoy.”
“We don’t even know how long he’s going to stay put. This could be our only chance.” Harry steps out from the alcove, eager to catch up to Malfoy. Ron steps in front of him.
“I’m not finished. I’ve been meaning to tell you, since, well you know, how sorry I am for all the cruelty I enacted or let happen to you in the war and before it. For you to love me, you must have somehow already found a way to forgive me but that doesn’t mean you don’t still deserve an apology. I’m sorry and that shouldn’t be enough, but it’s all I can offer, that and my assurance that I’m not that person anymore.”
Potter’s eyes followed the action of Draco’s hand and then drifted down further still before roaming back up slowly, blatantly checking him out. Draco felt hot all over. “You’re much fitter,” Potter said when he made eye contact again.
unwelcoming, and Draco worried even his favourite day wouldn’t be enough to get Potter on side this year.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry and pushed past him, brandishing his wand dramatically. “Where did it go, Teddy?” He stage-whispered. “Is it still in the cupboard?”
“Malfoy Manor,” he calls out as clearly as he can despite the smoke in his throat and the heat at his neck. And the world begins to spin, a little bit like apparating but with plenty more knocks and bruises on the way.
to have back but that wasn’t quite the same as wanting him now, after everything that had happened between them.  “No, not really,” he answered truthfully.
“To your own son, Narcissa?” Interrupts Madam Pomfrey, almost dropping the potions as she hastily steps in front of Draco’s mother. “Surely –
Malfoy shrugs and walks away, stepping over a stack of books Harry has been meaning to pack away for weeks. Harry quickly thrusts them under the couch with his wand. Next, he spells the clothes strewn across his house to fly into his bedroom wardrobe. A single sock whips past Malfoy’s head.
“Do not lecture me, Potter when you clearly know very little about werewolves. Wolfsbane Potion needs to be taken every night for a week leading up to the full moon or it isn’t effective.
Damn it all. Draco picked up his quill and started to scribble his own response back - bringing up his other hand to  cover the parchment when Potter tried to read over his shoulder.
What was the point in loving someone who was only going to leave you? Draco’d already had his fair share of that with his father who, when it came down to it, had chosen his own life over his family’s, running off after the war and leaving Draco and his mum to face the consequences.
Malfoy muttered an answer under his breath. Harry heard it but made him say it again anyway: “Louder.”
Draco stares at the spaghetti and meatballs on the plate in front of him. Just looking at it makes him want to vomit. He breathes through his mouth carefully so he doesn’t have to smell it. He entertains the thought of knocking it off the table. Though he supposes Potter would insist on getting him another meal. How many plates could he knock off the table before it became suspicious?
box. How could he not look inside? Okay yes, the ring box had been at the bottom of Draco’s sock drawer, but he’d only opened the drawer because he couldn’t find the pair to one of his socks and thought perhaps it had been mixed up with Draco’s. It hadn’t. And Harry had long forgotten about matching socks.
Draco walked into the eighth year common room with his head downcast as always. He spoke to no-one. No-one spoke to him.
“I am not–” Malfoy objects but Harry is already pulling him under. “At least give me my wand back,” Malfoy whispers.
Just as he’s about to do that and forever ruin any social standing he has at Hogwarts – although let’s face it, as the boy savior, he can do no wrong – Malfoy says and I fucking quote “Sweet dreams, Potter,” before jumping up and relocating to his usual desk third from the front, far left desk.
Potter turned around, one hand on the door. “See you again in a year, I suppose,” he said with the exact indifference Draco had been attempting all throughout their encounter.  “Unless you’re free tomorrow?”
There’s something else too. Behind the fresh wounds there are long scars, starting at Malfoy’s neck and criss-crossing all the way down to his navel like someone had cut… A weight sinks in Harry’s gut when he realises what they are.
Accepting the unspoken challenge, Draco lifted his voice so that he was almost shouting. “Yes, it is.”
“It is, isn’t it?” Potter didn’t even have the decency to deny it. “I’m not into playing coy like you, Malfoy. I’m not embarrassed that I want you.”
“Oh, yeah.” Draco hoped his disappointment wasn’t too obvious. “Do you have any of the same symptoms?”
Harry ended the memory and he and Draco both fell from his Pensieve. The room – Harry’s office – had grown darker since they’d entered the memory. Harry turned to the fireplace and cast it ablaze, feeling a chill creeping up over his skin.
Harry’s brain, still playing a bit of catch up, struggles to understand what is going on. “Who’s in your head? What happened to you?”
Harry holds Malfoy’s eye. “I don’t need to prove anything. And I don’t want to…do that. I’m trying to do the right thing.”
Harry looked back down at his paperwork. He couldn’t absorb the words. Not with that sound in his ears. He really was screwed.
And then there’s Malfoy. Harry looks over to him, he has already returned to his own potion and is stirring it intently. Why was he so quick to help Harry? It’s not like Malfoy at all. Then again, nothing Malfoy does these days is like Malfoy.
“You’re in a mood,” Draco observed, watching Potter stare into his tea, having made no move to pick it up again.
Harry wiggles the doorknob slightly, just to see if it will give. It doesn’t. It’s locked. Looks like Harry’s not backing out that way then. If only he can get his wand out without drawing Zabini’s suspicion.
Ron didn’t reply which meant yes. In the silence, Draco rehearsed what to say to Potter. He’d start with an anecdote about his father, setting the scene, then he’d explain his reservations about their relationship and finish with his feelings, if only he could work them out by the time they reached his dorm.
“I have an informant willing to tell you everything you need to know about a conspiracy to attack the Ministry of Magic on the full moon. You can have all the credit. The Minister herself is bound to take notice.”
As the footsteps of the waitstaff and Malfoy approached, Harry could have sworn he’d heard a hushed plea of “No, please, not next to Potter,” before Malfoy was falling into the table directly adjacent to Harry’s, a familiar scowl on his face as the waitstaff explained it was the only one available.
“Don’t be mad.” Pansy says as soon as she sits down. She already has a pint half drunk in front of her. She had obviously turned up early to make up for standing Draco up last time.
“He can’t know who it is, otherwise he’d have already rubbed our faces in it,” Ron muttered, staring after Percy with a scowl. He turned back to Harry. “You think Malfoy cursed you?”
Draco wasn’t particularly superstitious or paranoid, but that didn’t mean he had to take any chances. He decided last night when he lay in his bed unable to sleep that he wouldn’t go to classes today. That he’d stay within the safety of his dormitory until November third was well and truly over. He and Potter were in a good place - at a peak level of antagonism and rivalry. Draco wasn’t going to do anything to ruin that.
Malfoy righted Harry but kept a firm grip on him – perhaps he thought Harry might slump to the floor otherwise, which was probably an accurate assumption at this stage.
So, Harry has no choice but to follow Malfoy out into the Entrance Hall and confront him. “How do you know?”
,” Madam Pince said venomously. “And pick up that book!” she ordered, eyeing Harry’s Potions textbook on the floor.
Harry stared back at Malfoy, unblinking, for what seemed like four and half minutes, but in reality was only 17 seconds. And for those 17 seconds Madam Puddifoots felt a hell of a lot smaller.
.” Draco feels her eyes boring into him so he picks up a chip and takes a small bite, just to placate her. It’s soggy and dry at the same time. Urgh. He raises an eyebrow at Pansy in defiance as he takes another bite.
Draco uses the opportunity to look around. The kitchen is large, clearly built for a number of house-elves to work in for their masters, not for a single wizard to be doing all the work. Especially not one rich enough to hire any number of house-elves, now that it’s against the law for them to work for free that is.
If you had told Harry Potter, back in his first year of Hogwarts, that he’d be sharing custody of a child with Draco Malfoy, he would have laughed. Loudly. But here he was, fifteen years later, and one of Teddy Lupin’s two legal guardians.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t…” A terrible thought pops into Harry’s mind, bringing the dread up from his stomach with it. “Will you still be able to cure him?”
Draco stopped Harry before he could enter the locker rooms, holding him against the wall. They were both still sweaty from the game but Draco didn’t mind - in fact, he rather liked the way Harry looked when he was flushed.
, at least silenced Potter. His laughter died down and he stared at Draco strangely as if waiting for it to happen again.
Draco shivered. Harry hardly ever called him that anymore. He stuck out his chin. “We both know you want it too,
In the end, it was those eyes that led Draco to coming in his pants like the horny virgin he was. He might have felt embarrassed if Harry hadn’t come straight after all over his own desk and the remaining paperwork that hadn’t yet been cast to the floor. The sight of Harry’s orgasm face alone was enough to drive all other thoughts away for a blissful moment - the way his eyes fluttered shut and the little upwards quirk to his lip, almost like a smirk, the cocky naked bastard.
Although perhaps he’d gone a little far because Potter’s face twisted into uncertainty for the first time. “Malfoy, if you don’t want to, that’s fi - “
“A minor disagreement?” Repeated Draco, his voice had returned to a cold politeness for Teddy’s sake, but he fixed Harry with a contrary expression.
“Well, it’s certainly more cooperative than yours. I’ve brushed your hair fourteen times this morning, and look at it!”
Harry takes a shallow breath – his chest is too constricted to allow anything more. “I know who you are.”
The Patronus vanishes, its job complete. Harry blinks at the empty air in front of him. Of course, he should tell Hermione first, both as his Auror partner and friend. But Malfoy has said to come alone. And Harry’s curiosity gets the better of him. Besides, it’s not the full moon yet so even if Malfoy is a werewolf, Harry can still hold his own.
Draco Malfoys. And he’s still not exactly sure why. All he knows is the one in ropes by his feet tried to kill him. And he really hopes that’s not the real Malfoy.
from across the library) on an empty table squeezed between two shelves of books, happy for the privacy. The Hogwarts library was similar to the rest of the castle in the way that it had a mind of its own. The tables and bookshelves were constantly rearranging themselves and each day there would be a new configuration. This was Harry’s favourite so far. No one would even know his table was there unless they were specifically looking for it, or for a book on the spiritual properties of Flobberworm, which sat nestled on the shelves behind Harry’s head.
Draco averted his eyes as Potter flew into his line of vision. That was hardly his fault. He turned to Blaise. "I don't know what you mean."
Draco swivelled around and leant back on Hagrid’s table - better to be facing his opponent when the first curse was cast. “One of that half-breed’s nifflers is what - “
“And you’re always right, of course,” Draco said, a touch of sarcasm under baked in his tone. Harry suspected this would be a very different conversation with a sober Draco.
Malfoy’s earlier words repeat in Harry’s head and he can’t think of anything else. His left hand trails down to the top of Malfoy’s trousers and he lets his fingers slide just under the waistband, feeling Malfoy’s stomach clench as he does.
Harry found his way over to Draco and Teddy - by walking, not apparating - and joined in on the hug. And because his heart was overflowing with the words: “I love you both.”
Malfoy scoffs. “Very convincing, Potter.” He looks back up at Harry, his hard face returning. “I know what you want.”
They stood there silently for no longer than a beat but it seemed a very slow, awkward one. Draco nodded politely and moved to walk away.
November third. It should have been a day like any other. Except it never was. Not for Draco Malfoy.
Hermione smiles. So does Harry. She’s got him! “I’ve been doing a lot of research and the one thing I can’t understand is what determines how its properties are altered. I know that if you mix it with pixie flowers, it causes delirium, and if you mix it with dragon egg shell, it causes combustion, but I can’t understand why.”
Malfoy sighs and his expression softens. “I know it’s impossible, but I’m begging you, trust me, just this once.”
He waves down a nearby waiter, without looking at Potter. “How much is your most expensive bottle of red wine?”
“You already have, Potter. I suppose before I kill you, I should thank you for that terribly made potion of yours. It’s given me a whole new outlook on life. Any last words? No, actually, I think I’ve heard enough from you. Let’s skip to the – “
“There is no documented potion that combines both asphodel root and nightshade,” Hermione says impressively as if this is supposed to be a major breakthrough. Except it means absolutely nothing to Harry, and Ron as well it would seem from his clueless expression.
Harry opens his eyes to find Malfoy staring openly at his crotch. Good god, he hopes it’s not obvious. “That’s not what I meant. Just – how do we fix this?”
Everything had been easy for them from the start. They moved together perfectly as if in a dance. Each step as natural as the first. But this, finally, this, was something difficult. Something that made Harry feel sick at the thought of saying it, at the thought of the consequences if he had misjudged the situation, at the thought of rejection. But even sicker at the thought of not saying it, like if he didn’t let it out, it would come up forcefully all on its own whether Harry was ready or not.
Malfoy’s voice was quiet but it was pretty clear everyone heard anyway from the chorus of gasps and excited whispers that followed. Harry easily blocked them out – Malfoy held his full attention now. He realised it was quite silly to worry about this dare, that he had wanted it all along regardless. Even if nothing further eventuated from it. He really wanted to kiss Malfoy.
“No,” Hermione says fixing Harry with a glare, “stupid, like lose your temper and say something you’ll regret.”
Potter pulled his mouth from Draco’s and trailed kisses across his jaw to his neck. The sensation was not unlike eighth year, but the intensity had heightened, tenfold. If he’d known exactly how much naked humping with Potter improved the experience, he would have stripped down right in the middle of their truth and dare circle. Because this was fucking brilliant. The stimulation of his neck and cock at once kept his whole body on fire.
It seemed like Potter was having his own sulk if the sight of a bed canopy was anything to go by. Ronald had long left Potter, leaving an opening. Draco set off for their room, confident he could find his way through the castle by feel, but on his first staircase, he got turned around and became very very lost. Still, he continued, rationing he’d have to get to Potter eventually, even if it meant visiting every room in Hogwarts.
Harry’s eyes drifted involuntarily to Malfoy’s chest, but just for a second. “That was – but – I don’t –
Harry fell backwards with the force and toppled backwards over his chair. He looked up to find Madam Pince standing above him, wand raised. “This is a
“Ronald,” Hermione interrupts with a warning glare at Ron. She turns to Harry. “He must still feel something. He kissed you back, didn’t he?”
Draco’s eyes flash, his lips tighten. “I’ll kill you first,” He says darkly, a fast turn from his previous tone that makes Harry wonder if this is the Draco he has come to know or someone else entirely.
Malfoy shakes his head but Harry swears he sees a small smile hidden on his face. “I meant being seen with you.”
Harry let his hands drop and sneak up beneath the hem of Draco’s sweater and up past his undershirt to land on the bare skin of Draco’s torso.
Potter narrowed his eyes at the glass and made no move to accept it. “That’s hardly an appropriate way to treat your date,” he said – a playful chiding. “Or a waiter,” he added with a more serious tone.
“We don’t even have anything due today,” she commented, passing over the apple. “Why are you pretending to be sick?”
And so Draco was forced to witness Harry Potter in a fucking beret. Like the green tie hadn’t been enough. Like the execution of wandless, wordless magic hadn’t already blown Draco’s mind. As he finally shooed Harry Potter, his supposed
“Something?” Draco prompted, a hand coming up to push Harry’s long hair from his face. It flopped right back down but Draco kept repeating the motion anyway.
He stares and stares, watching as grey clouds pass into the light only to disappear into darkness once more. Sleep is far away for him, even as Ron snores peacefully across the dormroom. Lately, Harry spends more time on this windowsill than his own bed, resting his head against the cool glass to stifle the fire beneath his skin.
As Malfoy watched, eyes guarded, Harry slowly took the seat across from him and held out his hand, hoping it wasn’t obvious how much it was shaking. “Hi. I’m Harry, your soulmate.”
Against his better judgment, Draco snuck a look at Potter out of the corner of his eye. His eyes were roaming the sky, exactly as they did the Quidditch pitch, searching for patterns with fresh excitement.
The game continued with more dares – mostly kissing – and a couple of truths – mostly related to kissing. Harry would’ve regretted not walking away earlier if it weren’t for Malfoy sitting casually, half-naked on his stool, rolling his firewhisky bottle from hand to hand.
Draco, is only the good parts of Draco Malfoy? But it doesn’t make sense. There’s been good parts of Draco missing all this time too.
Harry blinks as fast as he can to hold back the tears he can feel at the edges of his eyes. He’s not going to cry over Draco bloody Malfoy.
Harry hadn’t any experience prior to dating Draco but that didn’t matter now. He didn’t need to know what it was like to suck someone else’s dick. He only needed to know that Draco liked it when he swirled over his tongue over the tip. That Draco liked it when Harry moaned around him. That Draco
“Is about to be dismissed. This is far too pressing.” Madam Pomfrey stares at Harry for a moment longer before shaking her head and turning back to the classroom. Conversation over.
To keep himself from losing his mind in ever-worsening speculation, Harry heads over to the Slytherin table at dinner. Malfoy’s friends see him coming before he even passes the Hufflepuffs. Parkinson raises her eyebrows and nudges Nott. Nott frowns and nudges Zabini. Zabini jerks his head up and openly glares. Harry continues his approach regardless, stopping only to hover awkwardly by the table.
Harry doesn’t know to react so he freezes. He just freezes. For the first time, he doesn’t have his eyes on Malfoy, but only because he’s sitting right fucking next to him and to stare at him from that complete lack of reasonable distance would be so terribly obvious.
“Every player must take a drop of Veritaserum,” She said to the group. “Those are the rules. If you don’t like it– ” she turned her head to Malfoy– “you don’t have to play.”
“Then why were you staying at the Manor with – “ Harry isn’t sure how he’s supposed to phrase this – “
There’s a nervous stubborn energy radiating from Malfoy that Harry understands because he’s felt it himself: the pride of independence versus the need for help.
Draco’s snatches his fork from the table and attacks the food in front of him, swallowing mouthful after mouthful of Potter’s poison in quick succession.
notice Malfoy’s behaviour? He leaves class early, he never comes to meals, he says good morning to Harry! It’s all very obvious to anyone watching him. Not that Harry makes a habit of watching him. He has just been worried about the effects of his potion is all.
Harry looked over to his own bed. Malfoy was fast asleep. It wasn’t fair that he got to have the unicorn space dreams (Harry could only presume) in Harry’s bed, while Harry had scary death nightmares in his. He walked over.
But now, all Draco can do is stare at the clock, anticipating Potter’s arrival. He’s both anxious to see Potter, in the light of his outburst the last time they were together, and excited, in the light of Potter being Potter.
“Thank you,” Potter interrupts, a wide photographic smile on his face. “Right now all I need is a menu.”
“Here,” he said, holding out the pin. Draco was sure to take it with his good arm. He needn’t have bothered - Potter didn’t look away from his face, a steely expression on his own. Oh merlin - Draco already knew there was something preachy coming. And: “You don’t have to be your father, you know. We don’t choose our family.”
Ron snorted. “Sometimes. Other times, to listen to a rant about you. I only ever see his side profile now because he’s so paranoid about you finding out.”
Harry cranes his neck to find Ron, Hermione, and Malfoy approaching them from the end of the corridor, wands outstretched, the Marauder’s Map dangling from Ron’s other hand. Wait. Malfoy?
with his potion, why has Malfoy been acting different for so long, acting like… “Was it all – did you ever – why did you pretend to like me?” Harry stutters out with very little dignity.
It sounded weird asking. But he couldn’t just surprise Potter with it, and besides, he thought perhaps Potter would be into it and it would be so much hotter if he wanted it too.
Harry loosens his own and pulls it over his head, offering it to Malfoy. “Here, you can transfigure the colours.”
“Then we do our job and arrest him,” Harry says in his responsible matter-of-fact voice. It always impresses the new recruits but never Hermione.
The familiar tinkering of a bell drew Harry’s eyes straight back to the door, but it was only a couple leaving, hands tightly intertwined. Harry turned back to Malfoy to notice his eyes glued to the door as well. There was a tightness in Harry’s chest he couldn’t quite recognise yet.
Harry was acting exactly the same as before, as if nothing had happened. And Draco didn’t know what to make of that. Didn’t know how to behave now he had fallen even deeper for Harry Potter.
However, Malfoy only nods and re-deals the cards. “You’re much better at this than me,” he says, with no hint of resentment, no hint of jealousy.
“I’ve seen something similar before,” he continued. “A wizard’s anxiety can manifest in bizarre ways.”
He tried not to look at Potter too much. One night was far too much time to spend with Potter but even so, it would never be enough. November third seemed to sneak up on Draco much too fast, and end even quicker. But each time, he found himself falling in deeper.
He carefully ducks his head out into the corridor to watch where she goes, still cursing himself for not bringing his cloak. Sneaking around other peoples’ houses is a little difficult without its aid. Luckily Mrs. Malfoy doesn’t turn around so Harry remains unseen. He watches as she unlocks a door adjacent to the room Harry had arrived in. Her head barely ducks in before she is removing it and closing the door again. Harry quickly moves back before she turns around and returns down the corridor with a quiet: “Knox.” The candles in the corridor flicker and die.
And it must have been obvious that Draco was too. He’d completely given up holding back any of his own sounds - and if he was honest, the thought,
He watched Draco’s eyes alight and even caught the slightest smile in the quirk of Draco’s lips, before the man composed himself. Draco leant back against the counter, his expression returning to disinterest, although Harry knew now that it was feigned.
Harry steadied himself on his broom and readjusted his grip – trying not to notice how Malfoy’s eyes fluttered down to his gloves. “Is this the only way you can win, Malfoy? By distracting me?”
Anyway. Malfoy leans over, right up to Harry’s ear, like something out of a porno and I kid you the fuck not, says “Late night?”
Draco clutched his champagne glass a touch tighter when his eyes locked onto Blaise’s across the grand ballroom. He looked away immediately but the damage was already done: Blaise was making his way over.
Now what is about to happen next is so fucking embarrassing, that you need to be prepared for the secondhand embarrassment of it all. You need to find something to bite down on because this so incredibly embarrassing that Harry wishes he had something to bite down on, and he also wishes he wasn’t thinking about Malfoy’s cock of all things while he thought that just now. Not that he wants to bite it. But he wouldn’t be opposed to having it in his –
“Shame,” Potter said, standing up straight and lifting his broom. “Would you consider it? I’ve always wanted to be painted.”
Pansy’s face splits, no relaxes, into a smile and – oh no – there’s a hint of water swimming in her eyes. “Oh Draco. Thank Merlin. We can go to the hospital now if – “
Harry returns his attention to stroking Malfoy’s stomach while he assesses the remaining cut on Malfoy’s chest. It’s not as deep here so he hopes, for Malfoy’s sake, that it doesn’t hurt as much. He lifts the bottle around Malfoy and, carefully this time, lets a single drop fall onto the wound.
Draco smiled at the tease. Beneath his hothead and impatience, there was something very gentle about Potter. He was a difficult person to hate. And stargazing wasn’t really the best activity to reinforce that hated.
It’s small talk. Draco hates small talk. Teasing Potter is so much more fun. “If I tell you, you’ll probably start stalking me again.”
“No,” Draco said, and he was pleased to realise he wasn’t lying. “But,” he added, wrapping his legs around Harry’s and leaning into him, “you might need to make this up to me.”
Huffing, to convey his anger at Potter for tricking him, Draco crossed this arms. “I can’t just give you a blowjob in the middle of a work day!”
Madam Pomfrey’s composure slips, her nose flaring, eyes widening. Harry hasn’t seen her like this since Professor Lockhart turned his broken arm into jelly in second year. “Mr Potter, until you have more experience with Potions, you should not be experimenting on your own. The slightest adjustment can completely alter the magical properties and to add–”
Draco didn’t say anything for a moment. He looked to be thinking carefully. And then: “I like your hair.”
Professor Varas addresses the class. “Please begin when you and your partner are ready. I shouldn’t be hearing any verbal spells except the odd Protego, but it’s best if you also practice this non-verbally. Remember, you shouldn’t just be shouting the spell in your head. You need to recall the feeling of that particular spell and summon it from yourself, from your wand. Be gentle with each other!”
Malfoy stood up, passing his firewhisky to Zabini. He walked across the circle to Harry, his robe moving with him, the skin of each leg revealed and hidden again with each step like an endless striptease. He stopped in front of Harry, leaning on one leg so their eyes were at the same height.
The figure is both shadow and light, drawing from and against the moon with each movement. Harry’s transfixed,
“That was last year. He has been calling me Potter since term started. Now, today, all of a sudden, Harry. Neither of you think that’s odd?”
“Oh.” Harry’s did the same as he caught on. ““Well, did you want to…” Harry faltered as he came across the same words Draco couldn’t quite vocalise. "I mean, what do you want to do?”
Harry finally understands the message. Of course, he ignores it, stepping into the room and hovering in front of the study desk. “Malfoy. About last–”
Potter’s face screwed up before he answered - so Draco already knew he wasn’t going to like it. “Mean. Cruel. Selfish. A bully.” The words came out slowly, each one hitting Draco as harshly as the first.
When too much silence has passed, Harry finally looks over to Draco and stares into the eyes of his soulmate.
“Perhaps you could just tell me what’s going on and save us both the trouble.” Harry suggests rather than unnecessarily answering Malfoy’s question. He doesn’t suppose Malfoy will take him up on it but he’s desperate enough to try.
Potter closed his mouth and then opened it again. “Why would you want to -“ he paused, his eyes narrowing. “Oh. I see,” he said, in the cold manner Draco had become accustomed to hearing his name uttered within the past year.
He didn’t know how Potter knew it was his birthday. He purposefully hadn’t said anything. But here Potter was at his door, singing some silly muggle song and holding a French Apple Cake. Draco’s favourite – he hadn’t said anything about that either, had he?
“Good Afternoon, Mr. Potter,” Draco said formally, aware of Healer Gibbon’s eyes on him. “Please take a seat.”
“Unwilling? You mean they couldn’t afford the inflated price the Ministry sells it at?” Harry hears Malfoy’s own words coming from his lips.
For a second, Harry stands still. He knew this was coming. He knew when Draco was back to his regular self, he wouldn’t want anything to do with him. He knew it but he let himself be tricked anyway. He let himself be drawn into Draco, let himself start to feel…but there’s no point dwelling on that anymore. Whoever he’s been with these past couple of months, it wasn’t Draco Malfoy.  Just another fantasy.
Harry wasn’t sure what to do next. Malfoy’s arm held him firmly against the bed. He couldn’t see how he could extract himself without Malfoy waking up. And if Malfoy woke up and realised the position they were in…well, Harry suspected it wouldn’t end well for him.
And he doesn’t plan it, he really doesn’t, but when he finishes in his hand, he calls out Malfoy’s last name in a whisper so quiet it’s almost like he doesn’t say it at all. But he does. And there’s really no escaping that fact.
Harry’s hand clenches around the bed post. “I mean,” he says, his voice huskier than intended, “what is this? Are you interested in me or just…you know?”
“I guess I’m lucky you have a sharp eye then,” Potter said, painfully smooth. He took a step closer to Draco’s table, holding onto the back of the opposite chair.
“Oh.” Harry was surprised. Of course he was. Draco was 25 for Merlin’s sake. He should have had several partners by now. But he’d spent all his adult life pining for Harry Potter. How pathetic.
This time, it’s Malfoy who seeks out Harry, finding him lying by the Great Lake. Harry wonders if Malfoy is aware this is where they watched the sunrise together, only days ago. Harry tries not to read into anything when Malfoy lies down beside him on the wet, muddy grass, without a single complaint.
“I hate to break up this little soiree,” says a smooth cold voice, slipping through the crowd. “But you need to get your grubby hands off my son right now.”
Draco kept his face blank and blinked at Potter innocently. “I’m sorry, is that supposed to be funny?”
Malfoy’s eyes widen at the challenge, and before Harry can react, Malfoy has him laid back on the bed, trapped between two very long and unyielding legs. Malfoy leans down and Harry’s breath hitches at the impending kiss, but instead Malfoy simply readjusts his glasses.
Before Harry could react, Draco’s voice interrupted them. “Move aside, Harry, I can handle this,” he said, leaning by the doorway, his words a little slurred from the alcohol.
Malfoy tries again. “I won’t deal with invisible clients. You either reveal yourself now or you leave my property.”
Ron, although slow on the uptake, came to Harry’s rescue as usual. “Malfoy must have mentioned it before.”
Malfoy still hasn’t returned to the dorm and it’s almost dinner now. It’s suspicious. Determined to learn something tonight, Harry decides to wait for Malfoy’s return. If he’s able to observe Malfoy when he thinks he’s alone, Harry might witness something telling. For now, it’s just a waiting game. Malfoy will have to return eventually.
Draco ignored Pansy’s taunt and focused on her theory. A threefold twin bond. It sounded ridiculous. But what if she was right? What if the universe kept throwing Potter at him because they were destined to be together, as much as they were destined to be enemies? “So how do you know if you have a threefold twin bond then?”
Look, Potter. I didn’t mean to say those nasty things to you. It’s just seeing you, in the flesh, after so many years…well, as they say: old habits die hard.
“I love you too,” Draco says quietly in return as she finally lets go and he steps inside the Manor.
“You won.” Harry stares at the fluttering snitch in Malfoy’s hand in disbelief. He had thought he’d had it. It had been hard to even see the snitch in the dark, but coupled with the pelting rain, it was practically impossible. Somehow, he’d caught a glimpse of tiny golden wings and he immediately sprung his broom to action. But that’s all he caught, a glimpse. Because by the time he’d seen it, he was already too late.
. Beneath the cut, Harry catches the unmistakable sight of Malfoy’s erection through his trousers. His brain short circuits while he continues to stare straight at it.
It’s all Harry can take. He stands up and strides towards Malfoy, ready to yank that stupid book from his hands. But he hasn’t been paying attention to class. So, when the rest of the class also stand up and start pairing off, he’s not exactly sure what is happening. But Malfoy must. Because he groans as Harry approaches him and tries to shove him away.
It wasn’t until Potter finally let go - coming into Draco’s mouth - when one of the words became clear.
Except Harry didn’t quite get the reaction he was hoping for. Not that he minded Draco pushing up into his touch - not at all! - but he did love hearing that adorable giggle.
Before Draco could reply – not that he had any idea how to – Blaise had removed his hand and was already walking off through the crowd.
Draco watched as indecision played out it’s journey on Harry’s face. He’d clearly enjoyed the kiss as much as Draco, but he was such a do-gooder too. And that side of him wouldn’t give up easy.
Draco leans up against the counter across from Potter. He’s feeling a little light headed and he’s attributing it to Potter’s dazzling smile from earlier. “So what do you want me to do?” He asks, happy for Potter to lead the way. Potter looks up at him sharply. “Chop, grate, peel?” Draco prompts.
Something tells Draco to look up – whether the scent of Potter or the sound of his footsteps, Draco can’t be sure – so he does. And sure enough directly in his line of sight is Harry Potter handing over his coat to the maître de, his lips moving. Draco’s not close enough to hear, and he’s hopeless at reading lips so he fills in the conversation in his head.
The room buzzed. Harry took a long sip of his firewhisky. His face felt warm. He hoped to Merlin it wasn’t red.
“Haven’t I just done that?” Harry looks back down at Malfoy, but he has already turned away, slumping against the back of the cage.
But then the door had swung open and a hand pulled the invisibility cloak off him – the teachers weren’t stupid – so they’d stopped. And they hadn’t talked about it since.
“Yes,” Hermione continues, despite clearly being aboard a sinking ship. “Their work involves integrating muggle medicine with magical healing to create cures and treatments for a variety of diseases, both muggle and magical in nature. They’re always looking for muggleborns to bring expertise from both sides.”
sick. His body, obviously rejecting the unnecessary mush Potter drove him to eat, only feels better when every last bit is expelled from his system. He drops to the pavement, panting, his thoughts turning back to Potter.
And far worse, Potter wasn’t here. The day Draco had been dreaming about for months wasn’t the salvation he thought it would be. But talking to Potter, at least, renewed Draco’s hope.  Yes, Potter wasn’t back. But he was alive. And there was no doubt that he would come eventually. Horny teenager or not, Harry Potter always saved the day.
“Don’t be rude, Harry,” Hermione admonishes. She turns back to Malfoy. “We’re happy to have you here, Draco.” Her eyes flick down to his shirt and she pulls out her wand.
He reaches out a hand to hover over Malfoy’s waistband and looks up to his face for permission. Perhaps this is a little over the top to do in his dream. Because he’s controlling dream Malfoy’s actions anyway, but it seems appropriate. And it makes everything a little more exciting when Malfoy nods while biting his lip. Because consent is fucking sexy (and MANDATORY, take note people).
In truth, Draco wasn’t expecting to win but he couldn’t very well back down from a challenge. Draco may have been flying since he was young, but he had seen Potter on the field last year - it appeared as if Potter had been
