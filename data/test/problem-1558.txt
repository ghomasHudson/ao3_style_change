The way they moved in perfect harmony, their hands touching, Harry’s head resting on his shoulder. Draco was so happy he almost started crying.
“Let me try”, Draco demanded and snatched it from Harry’s hands. Upon opening it, Draco heard the most horrific sound his ears had ever been tortured with, and he grew up with his mother singing in the shower. Freaked out by the racket, he dropped it into the water.
“Harry … Are you okay?” Draco was slightly worried about his friend. He probably wasn’t in the condition to relax and dance.
Too late, it's gone, it won't come back
“Listen, I just wanted to talk to you!” Draco’s voice was still shaky, but he hoped that Harry would not notice.
It was obvious that there was something going on at the Gryffindor table. Was it because of the letter? Draco’s head started to turn red as he felt the embarrassment spread in his body.
“You first.”, Harry said.
“So merepeople will steal something from me and I have an hour to get it back? Like, underwater? How am I supposed to hold my breath that long?”
“As if I didn’t have enough bloody problems already! I mean, I was almost eaten by a fucking dragon! And I need to figure out this egg riddle, while trying to get a date for a dumb dance that I don’t even want to go to and somehow learn to dance and the teachers still expect me to do my homework, as if I had no other worry in the world. Why can’t this place be a normal, boring school for once, with normal students, where no one has to fear for their life?”
Harry blinked, the words ringing a bell but not quite being able to recall specifically. He’d been distracted at the time, sue him.
Draco and Ron had the decency to flinch at her tone, and Harry wasn’t feeling charitable enough to pity them. Also, he figured he was in trouble too and was selfish enough to be more worried about himself at that point.
Harry smiled to himself since Neville was committed to not looking at him anymore. A rough start maybe, but this grand adventure was living up to its promise.
Minutes passed, and he just stared.

“Thank you.” And he meant it. “But I really do treasure you as one of my best friends and I
Harry let out a peal of laughter at his clear discomfort and the way his ears tinged pink.
For fun? Depends on the situation, but was not off the table.
“You’ll get used to it dear.” He called, and then he was gone, leaving Harry very entertained and the remaining three pink-cheeked from indignation at Zabini’s sass.
The shed was well made, unfortunately, which meant finding a gap that wouldn’t take a week and his entire soul to carve out was pretty difficult, but he eventually settled for an area at the back corner that when cleared of wood would give him just enough room to squeeze out, and he wouldn’t have to cut through joists to do it either. The problem, he figured, was that the back and the one side were up against the garden fence and he’d have to cut through not only the shed wall, but the neighbor’s fence and that was bound to be noticed long before he could actually get enough wood cleared to get out. The front and the other side faced the Dursley’s back yard, and if they happened to look out of their back window at the shed they’d locked their nephew in for any reason, the jig would be up before you knew it. And one would think they’d be hyperaware of the shed they’d locked someone in, so the chances were more than he was willing to risk.

Hagrid had dropped him off back at the library and gotten a promise for him to visit once he got to Hogwarts, and on the walk home Harry had drained the last of his saved pounds from skimming of the Dursley’s grocery money to invest in some key items that was going to make this whole thing work.

“It should remain open the entirety of the day the train is scheduled to come… today included.” Mr. Malfoy intoned in actual interest as he poked at the wall one more time just to be sure. “Most curious. Something must have gone wrong with it.” Grey eyes slid down to eye the boy beside him critically, causing Harry to feel acutely aware of the mess he probably was right then, though he managed to remain motionless despite it. “It is not anything you would be capable of, I’m sure. One cannot be
And because it felt a little one-sided after quite a long time talking about his interests, he did ask after hers just to be polite although he half thought she’d just deflect him.

He wasn’t actually going to lose any ground after this…

He snapped.
"Normal enough." Hagrid shrugged, beginning to walk again and forcing Harry to half-jog to keep up with him. "I doubt a muggle woulda ever been born with 'air like that; its definitely got some magic in it. But yer mother had a ton 'o it and muggles never thought it weird—just pretty like, ya know?"
This was the first time when Draco felt something else, something different, something he had never felt before, especially not for his official arch enemy. It was not hate, not loathing, not even jeer or mischievousness.
“Oh, I believe that is my choice to make. I know what I’m doing. I know how terrifying he is, I have met him as well. Don’t try to convince me otherwise, Harry, it won’t work. I have made my choice. I love you, and I want to be with you, and I want to help you. Whatever price I have to pay for it, I’ll pay. I just don’t ever want to lose you again. That would be the only thing I couldn’t take.”
“I’m sorry, I have to do this. Please, just get away. Hide, get to safety, but let me do this. I have no choice.”, Draco pleaded.
Draco wakes up, and suddenly, the world isn't the wonderful place it was two years ago anymore.
“Shut up Parkinson, no one bloody asked you!” Draco rushed towards the exit to be alone.
Draco spat on the ground. He had offered the ungrateful brat friendship, but that cocky bastard would rather be with that red-headed Weasley boy.
Draco cursed. Why did Zabini not chose another night to demonstrate how long he could stay awake?
“Wow!”, Draco was impressed by all the jars and vials. They didn’t look too appetizing, though. He could see something that looked like chicken feet floating in one jar, and big, green eyes in another. And these were by far not the most disgusting ones.
While everyone is getting dates for the dance, Draco sets up another meeting with Harry.
Draco smelled Harry’s mix of stress-sweat and cologne. He didn’t want this moment to end. “It’s okay, dear” he whispered into Harry’s ear. “It’s okay.”
“Yeah at least you had parents, I’m sure your childhood was horrible!”
“You are beautiful” Harry broke the silence. Before Draco could reply, he had already pulled his face to his and started kissing him again.
This had gone surprisingly well. Draco was pleased with himself. He gave Harry a bit of time to get back to the common room so that there wouldn’t be two people sneaking around and making noise at once. He would meet him in Hogsmeade, he knew it.
“Yes. We are officially boyfriends.” Harry stated factually.
Draco and Harry went to the stairs hand in hand. When they had to part ways, they softly hugged one more time.
Draco had never felt so safe with anyone before. It was a moment of infinity. “Harry…” he started a sentence he didn’t know how to finish, and it didn’t matter. The other boy knew what he wanted to say, even if he himself didn’t.
“And who even designed this place? What did they have in mind? A freaking magic toxic waste dump experiment thing to see whether it could dissolve people?”
The room looked completely different from the other times he had been there. It was completely empty, except for a lectern with a book on it. Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties by Hadrian Whittle.
They danced, hugging closely, until the lights went on again and all the students had to go to bed.
“Let’s go, Snape could be here any minute” Harry grabbed one rat tail out of the jar and they quickly snuck out of the office again. They didn’t get far, though.
“Alright, thanks. So what’s with the fanclub?” Draco thought it would be better not to immediately ask him about the egg. Better casually socialise first.
“I’m telling you Harry, Diggory told me, he wouldn’t tell me nonsense to my face!”
“Well I uhm, she’s busy.” Draco wasn’t fooled by Harry’s pathetic lie. He knew the other boy was embarrassed to ask him, Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin, for help. Harry wouldn’t admit it to anyone if his life depended on it.
“Yes. But you will get to do it many more times now. I won’t leave your side ever again.”
Say something!
“Are you awake yet?”, Pansy ripped him out of his daydream.
After the Dark Lord had returned two years ago, everything between him and Harry had changed. Draco simply could not have continued being with him, it would have endangered his family. It was bad enough that his father knew about the relationship, but if the Dark Lord, whom his father served, had heard of it, he might have killed Draco and his whole family. He would have happily endangered his own life for Harry Potter, but he had to think of his parents. He had to put their safety before his passion.
“Why do you ask, does little Malfoy need help getting a date?” taunted Bhupen Shastri. Draco had never even talked to that kid, and yet, he had the audacity to try and tease him.
“Listen, Potter, do you have any interest at all to accept my peace offering or not?” Draco was not a patient boy.
“Goodnight! And thanks for meeting me”
Harry took a deep breath and clutched Draco’s body tightly. He tried to pull himself together and collected his whole strength to lift the other boy. For half a second, it looked like he could do it. Then, he stumbled and dropped him clumsily.
The dragon was chained to the ground, but Potter kept mocking it and flying around its fire-breathing head, so that, with one powerful stroke of its wing, the dragon broke the chain and set after Harry. Both disappeared out of Draco’s field of view. Several seconds passed, then minutes, and no one knew where they were at.
Alecto Carrow chuckled angrily. “Think your little jokes’ll help you on your deathbed then?” she said mockingly.
Draco woke up in a cold sweat. That had been a long, weird dream. He had been catapulted back to years ago in his sleep, back to when the world had been a wonderful place and he had been happy with his boyfriend Harry Potter. Ex-boyfriend. It still hurt to think about. How had he let it come to this?
There were, of course, no fireworks in Hogwarts, but Draco had told the room to have a window to London where they could see the fireworks. He had absolutely no idea how this worked, but it only mattered that it did.
“Harry? It’s me, Draco, uhm, would you mind some company?”
“Of course, didn’t you?”
“Had stuff to do”, Draco replied, blushing. He could only hope that his fellow Slytherins would never find out that he’d helped Harry Potter with the second task.
Luckily, Harry didn’t seem to find the offer too weird. He was used to three-headed dogs, rats turning into men and bathrooms with secret doors, so he had a different definition of “weird”.
“No, but I might get a bit tense in front of the students and teachers of three schools!” Harry’s voice had an annoyed undertone. Draco realised he should probably not try to tease him anymore before that dance was over.
Now the boy could just try and get some sleep. He would see Harry’s reaction in the morning.
If Harry got cold feet, I will actually jump out of this window right now. Just as he finished this thought, a slightly out-of-breath Harry burst into the room.
“I think I’ll go to sleep”, Harry broke the silence. His eyes were still a little red and swollen, but it wasn’t as noticeable as before.
“Well I could have damn right guessed that. Another bloody riddle!” Harry punched the water in frustration.
“Of course I came! I wanted to figure out what in the name of Merlin’s underpants is going on with you.”
“Draco, it was a lovely night and so on, but I kind of need to go to sleep”
An hour long you'll have to look,
“I’m really happy to be here with you right now. Thank you.” He whispered into Draco’s ear, who responded by hugging him even more tightly.
He swore to himself that he would make their lives suck as much as possible.
“You did it, Harry, I knew you would! Wait, why’d you bring her up, too?” Draco had only just noticed the little girl who was trying to stay above the water.
When he was walking to the Dungeons, he passed Harry and his posse, of course!
“Malfoy, I know you only want to make fun of me, but please, don’t make a fuss right now, I just want to go to sleep, and I’m sure you do as well.” She had a pleading look on her face. “If I get caught again, I will be in so much trouble, and Fleur-“ She caught herself before she could say anymore.
“Yeah but you didn’t have to deal with thinking some crazy escapee dude was out to kill you, and your best friends seemingly immortal rat didn’t turn into freaking you-know-who’s servant”
“Don’t mind me. I am not even here” Draco could smell firewhisky. Some of the boys always smuggled booze into the castle and had drinking competitions. Hopefully, Zabini was drunk enough to believe him.
“Yeah, that would be nice.” Harry took Draco’s hand and put it on his face. “But let’s not talk about school or ponder life’s complexities now when there are so many nicer things to do.”
Tonight was the night. It had finally come. The night Dumbledore would die. Draco was shaking a little, but he was composed. He would not mess this up. Taking a deep breath, he entered the magic room and pulled the cloth cover off the cabinet for the last time. He took a step back, and then he heard a knocking on the inside of the vanishing cabinet. They had arrived. He opened the door and out came several of his dark acquaintances. His father Lucius was first, then came Alecto and Amycus Carrow, Corban Yaxley, Gibbon, Thorfinn Rowle, Selwyn, Travers and finally Fenrir Greyback. Together, they left the Room of Requirement to meet up with Professor Snape.
“Get on the bed, my love”, Harry chirped. Draco complied. He knew what would happen now, and he felt excited. He couldn’t wait to feel Harry inside of him. He arched his back to stick his butt up as high as possible. Then he felt something. It wasn’t painful at all, it was just something small. Then it was out again. Then something slightly bigger entered him, it entered him deeper than before. It made him feel something he’d never felt before.
“What is your fucking problem” Harry was completely outraged. Draco felt as if somebody took control of his body. He only watched himself when he took Harry’s hand gently and pulled him closer to him. Their hearts were beating incredibly loud and in the same rhythm.
Draco heard Harry’s voice outside. “Draco? Are you there yet?”
“You brought bathing gear to Hogwarts?”, Draco asked aghast.
“Yeah kind of a last resort I guess.” He shrugged.
The professor lectured on about whatever she was talking about. Draco didn’t actually hear one word. Finally, the bell rang.
“Yeah but which one? For all we know, one of them could be gasoline, or acid, or sweet soy sauce. God, I hat sweet soy sauce.”
“Yes, I’ve been here for quite some time, Potter, believe it or not.”

“You call that tea!?”
“Finish the one you have. I can’t promise anything, Potter. Just give us your best. And get out of my office. Dismissed!” He said, impatiently waving a hand and returned to writing as if Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, didn’t storm his office mere minutes ago.
“Team, could you come here for a minute? I have something to tell you,” he says, with that fake smile and the whitest teeth Draco has ever seen and he knows,
“Hello, guest,” said the figure, leaning in, its spider-web like wings glittering as if somebody put thousand upon thousands of small, unmovable raindrops on them and rotated them under the sun. Harry felt a warm but slightly prickly touch of the creature's long and slim fingers on his right cheek, but not like human-slim, more like branch-slim; it felt as if somebody peeled the bark off them, but not quite. Its whole form was beyond slim — if it was a human its bone would stick out from every angle and one would be afraid they would break the skin — but with the slow movement of its hand Harry saw that the body swayed with the leaves and trees around it.

Harry shook his head and started to dress, while Ron talked about his latest case and Hermionie hummed in agreement, still looking through his clothes as if she hoped to find something better. It was hard to indulge in things after the Dursley for years programmed him to count every bit of money he had, although he enjoyed buying a hand knitted sweaters from old ladies whose grandkids helped with their Etsy shop. The burgundy one was soft and warm, one of his favourites; it had long sleeves that he gladly rolled up and the collar of his shirt peaked from beneath it, making it quite official and stylish, at least in his mind.
“Oh, I left it…” he made a vague gesture with his hands, not really knowing if “feary world” would sound normal.
Harry stepped closer, and made another step and another, until he was close enough to feel Draco’s breath on his cheeks, until he could count each and every lash, see the different shades of grey in Draco’s eyes and tha barely visible freckles on his pale face that he hadn’t realised Malfoy had.
And waited.
Thank you so much for reading! Remember: kudos and comments are a godsent, be safe, stay healthy and take care of yourselves!
Harry hummed in agreement and slowly started to pursue the noise; it came from the general area of his right. The deeper and further he followed it, the sparser the plants got, until he moved out of his way a giant leaf of a fern that was almost twice his size to see a small clearing with a spring cutting right through it. A bubbly laugh escaped his throat, which got drier and drier as they went, and he was about to take a step forward, when a hand clasped his shoulder and moved him back.
Here he was, trodding through the mud, his trainers a lost cause, to the mausoleum of Perrywinkles, to meet the cursebreaker that the woman hired a few days ago to solve this case before it became something bigger and more dangerous.
“Did Perrywinkle tell you what the main problems were?” Asked Draco taking a step back from the tomb, hands in the pockets of his coat, looking more like a prince with a dark past who came to the catacomb of his family to bring a curse upon his enemies than a curse breaker on a job.
And sorry for being such a doomsdayer but I really don’t know what to do.
Draco sits for a moment in complete silence, staring at his email box dubiously. There’s no one else in the open space and the lights are shining just in the row he’s sitting in. In front of him is the Accounts Receivable, who disappear as quickly as they can before the month end closing jumps at them like a murderer in a slasher movie; they know it’s coming, each and every month. It’s the few days in a month when the work is never ending and Draco isn’t the only one at work at — he looks at his watch and sighs — six in the afternoon. The additional load of work that the Accounts Receivable have to do is so the General Ledger has clean books and Accounts Payable can put in the system as many invoices as they can. Draco doesn’t think that there’s another department as interconnected as the Finance one, because if one thing goes down, the other team struggles visibly.
“Yeah, well, what about you? You were always with Granger and Weasley like triplets that couldn’t be separated at birth!”
Robart sighed. Took off his glasses, gently placed them on a document he was writing before Harry stormed his office. He placed two fingers on the bridge of his nose, between the eyes, and sighed.
What he got was: an old woman that half the time didn’t remember who he was or what was her name, an old house that was probably haunted, and Draco Malfoy.
Ok. Well. Um. He works in IT, his name is Harry, and… he likes me? And I like him?
He remembers the ticket he escalated two days ago, wondering if their IT department was even alive at this point. It shouldn’t take two weeks to fix one issue he had with  SharePoint, but here he was, unable to access crucial files even though he technically had access to the folder. And the longer it took to fix the problem the madder was his Team Leader and Draco didn’t want to explain, again, that IT was taking care of it.
These days he was okay with who he was. Not out, at least not to the wide world beyond the mausoleum, but to those who were closest to him. He tried to date muggles, but it became complicated sooner rather than later. He enjoyed having someone who was a muggle as his partner, at least for the first couple of months, as at that point he still could explain
clear like morning bells from the nearby church on Sunday.
Harry fired another fireworks from his wand and the world around them erupted in reds and blues and green, giant dragons puffing sparkling fireworks fire out of their mouths sweeping above the tables and then soaring up to the sky.
Hi Harry,
because of the air conditioning.
They clearly have changed. He, well, for better or worse, has grown up and for the better part of his early twenties, tried to catch up to everybody around him without having the same experiences as them. While others thought about their exams and crushes he was trying to save the world. It became evident, especially after the world was saved, that there wasn’t much to do for The Boy Who Lived except, well, live. It turned out that if you haven’t done the “living” part in a long, long time, it can become a little confusing and depressing.
“Well, I guess it would be rude if you stood there, so come on in,” he waved at Potter and turned back to his suitcase, shoving the closest thing inside with a not so hidden anger in his throw.
which earns him a thumbs up reaction for Potter.
He could only nod; saying anything else was meaningless. Because what do you say to somebody who was used by those around him; by those who should protect him at all cost? What do you say to such a person who had to leave his country because otherwise his every move would be scrutinized? Draco didn’t have Blaise’s charm or Pansy’s network of people who still wanted to talk to her. Harry worked with both of them, separately, on a few cases; Zabini was too much of a flirt for his taste and Pansy’ dry sense of humor was a tad too dry for him. Nevertheless, he enjoyed their company and when Balise asked him out for a drink, he brought Ron and Hermonie and everybody else who was available. Their group stunned Blaise for a second, then he rolled his eyes and said, “Well, the rumours that all Gryffindors are joined at the hip are apparently troue. I guess the first round is on me, eh?” In the end they closed the pub at three in the morning, slightly wasted and more friends than colleagues.
There were many things Harry did not expect to experience in his life. Dying and coming back to life, defeating Voldemort and seeing Draco Malfoy kneeling in still wet earth after the whole day of rain, digging in with his long and seemingly delicate fingers and just throwing the clumps of dirt behind him like a dog.
Draco side eyed him. “I’m not going to comment how you just ran here and drank before even checking if the water wasn’t poisoned.”
“Honestly Penelope, I do not know,” Draco says as he stares at his unlocked screen, at the questions that are piling up. He still has the chat with Potter open and…
The light floated out, stopping briefly by the threshold of the mausoleum, as if pondering about why the doors weren’t closed, but then it flew quickly like a butterfly to the first stone. They watched, transfixed, as the light slowly moved from stone to stone, leaving behind a faint trace of yellow dust that flickered for a few seconds and then fell gently to the ground to vanish there, between the wet ground and withered grass.
Draco straightened and shook his head as if he couldn’t believe anything that was happening right now. “You’re crazy. What would people think?”
And the man smiles and there are cute dimples in his cheeks and with those words out, floating in a cold and empty elevator, he walks out with a white card in his hand to swipe it by the door.
“What's wrong with the doors?”
The lobby is almost silent, apart from the echoing sounds of people’s feet walking to the six elevators, three on the opposite sides of each other. He turns right, pushes the button and has to wait only a few seconds before the doors open soundlessly to a mirrored interior. Draco can see his tired face; the sunkness under his eyes, the combed back blond hair, the black coat that makes him look as if he is going to a funeral. But he likes the coat — it’s warm and was expensive when he bought it all those years ago and Draco doesn’t like to go shopping — and with the upcoming weekend he thinks that come Monday he will look better. There is finally sleep in his schedule, a turned off alarm clock and long hours in his bathtub.
Sincerly,
He knew that after the war the Malfoy’s had to shrink their assets substantially (as did many of the pureblood families that were helping Voldemort) but changing Malfoy Manor to
Harry had hardly ever heard anyone talk to him like that. Not praising him, not scolding him, just listening. Even though Draco himself had said that he could never truly relate to Harry’s struggles, he felt understood.
“I asked”, she seemed to stare right into his soul. “What kind of spells you use to transfigure an inanimate object into living creatures.
He looked into the other boy’s deep eyes longingly. “You are a handsome devil, Harry Potter, do you know that?” Wait, had he just said that out loud?
“Hmm, I guess we’ll have to think about that. But hey, we solved the first part of the riddle, it can’t be that hard to find a spell for that. I’m sure your friend Hermione can help you with that.”
Dear Harry,
He cursed Potter with all bad words he knew. He was a definitely good at flying and showed his skills as a seeker at every Quidditch game, even Draco had to admit that, but Potter struggled against the Horntail.
“Don’t you remember what it felt like? What if felt to be together? Because I never forgot it. I remember everything, from that first time we had a little moment in Myrtle’s bathroom, to our Hogsmead date, to that night in the Prefects Bathroom to all the nights we spent in our secret magic room. I remember the dancing, the fireworks, the time I saved you from the Great Lake. Don’t you tell me that all meant nothing to you. Because to me, it meant everything.”
Draco looked back at Dumbledore.
“So? I don’t care if you die”, Harry spat.
“Take a seat Mr. Malfoy.” He gestured to a musty wooden chair. Draco followed the invitation.
“So, lads, do you have dates yet?”, Draco interrupted the petty banter.
They swayed slowly to the music. They held each other tightly. Obviously, they weren’t perfectly in tune, and didn’t exactly look like Frank Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but who cares? Certainly not these two.
We cannot sing above the ground,
“Well you should listen to the woman, she knows what she’s talking about! Now, do it again, but swan-like!” They swayed to the music for a bit. Draco felt how Harry became more relaxed. Good, he thought. Dancing is serious business, he can’t waste his attention on being stressed.
“If you don’t want to help me that’s fine. Really. Sorry I asked. I guess I’m really just overly anxious about this whole thing.” Harry took a small step backwards and crossed his arms.
“Pansy”, he blurted out with a scarlet red face. Now you fucked it up. There’s no way back from here. He’s gonna dance with some Gryffindor chick and probably fall in love with her, and make out at the ball. There goes your dream of asking Harry Potter out.
Last night had really happened. Like, actually, really happened. It was reality. A brief, sweet piece of reality. Draco had laid in bed for hours, watching their dancing in his mind like a movie.
Now, waiting. Again. This time, Harry would know who requested the meeting, so he would hopefully not react as badly as last time.
Screeching like the sky fell from the sky, the girls stormed away from the tree and into the castle. Cedric took their panic with an almost relieved ease, he had wished for some peace and quiet for some time.
“I do! I’m going with Bastien, right, dear?” Sadie Baldock exclaimed and hugged her boyfriend. These bastards did always have to rub it in. Somehow, half of the house seemed to be dating all of the sudden.
Snape was mumbling something of the use of Lily of the Valley in healing potions and Draco’s best efforts to pay attention failed. Should he risk a glance and getting caught by Snape?
Draco went over to him. “Diggory! How are you?”
After a bit of experimenting, they created an acceptable bubble bath smelling of jasmine, cinnamon, sandalwood, lavender, ylang ylang, and rose. A sensual, almost overwhelming scent was in the air.
“I said” Harry repeated himself threateningly “that he won’t do it”
From that day on Draco thought of Harry in a different way. He still tried to make everybody think he hated him, but while they had their quarrels in the hallways, he didn’t think about the endless pain that he would like Potter to feel, he thought of his magical, dark green eyes and his glossy black hair. And he hated Potter for how he made him feel.
Then, finally, hundreds of owl’s wings sent a whooshing sound through the hall. If he only had something that would make it possible for him to hear what people on the other side of the hall were talking about! If only there was a device, or a possibility to extend his ears, so that he could listen to Harry’s reaction. Sadly, there was no such thing, and there probably never would be.
“Yes, Mr Malfoy. You will be who Mr Potter will have to rescue from the lake.” Draco’s brain could not compute what Snape had just said. Did Harry really like him that much? Thinking about that made his heart skip a beat. But he couldn’t actually let himself be rescued by Harry in front of the whole school. Everyone would know!
He needed to kill some time; there was no use in obsessively dreaming about opening the dance together with Harry, close to him, feeling like he was alone with him. He had already planned and prepared everything he needed for the dance: his robes were on a hanger next to his bed, he paid close attention to not get any stain or, god behold, wrinkles in his exquisit outfit, his shoes were polished, his tie even matched Pansy’s robes and, for decency’s sake, he had bought her a pale yellow rose. Not red, obviously. Even though Pansy had had a crush on him since year one, Draco was very aware of that, he wouldn’t give her a red or pink love-rose. He would give her a yellow friendship-rose. Maybe she would take the hint. Apart from that, they would look like an actual couple, at least outfit-wise.
“There you are! I was looking for you everywhere? Why weren’t you at dinner?”
“Why?”, Draco asked. His heart sank to his boots. Moody must have told Snape that he caught them. Draco was in big trouble.
“Malfoy?”
Class was almost over, would Draco rush out as quickly as possible to avoid Harry, or would he try to hang back and maybe get a chance to talk to him, or at least assess his chances, before tonight.
“Let’s do it!” Draco attempted to sound confident.
Harry entwined Draco’s fingers with his own. “You are everything I could need. And so much more than I deserve”.
1997, Draco’s sixth year
It was time to get up, even though Draco felt like sleeping forever.
“Promise me?” Harry asked timidly.
“No.” He could just ask him, what did he have to lose? Well, maybe the freshly gained trust and the little seeds of friendship he had planted so painstakingly. “I was thinking of asking…” Just say it, dammit, just bloody ask him!
“Harry, my boy, the truth can be a horrifically painful thing, but it’s the truth nonetheless. In a few moments, I will dissolve this bubble that granted us the privilege of talking openly, and Severus will finally kill me.”
We work on the same project together. What if we don’t hit off, what if I screw up and he will be bitter afterwards?
There was a part of him that regretted the relationship, regretted that they broke up so late in Harry’s life (he was still twenty-three ten but it felt as if he was way over thirty or even older, his bones protesting after a simplest task), regretted that he could discover what life really was like
He isn’t ready to quit, not yet. If he wouldn’t like to inherit projects and cases from somebody that left the company he won’t do the same to anybody else. This way of thinking may doom him, but Draco Malfoy is a man of his word, one of the few things he is proud to have acquired from his family.
“I’m sorry that it’s that bad for you,” said Harry, truthfully. He was sorry that Draco felt as if he had to run from his home country to finally live as he wanted to, and not turn around to see if any reporters were following him. “But I thought that you would, you know, feel the best with people following you. You’ve always had someone with you at Hogwarts and you were a slight peacock.”
“On three?”
Before he leaves he puts the kettle on the table top, looks around the kitchen to see if anything is out of place and closes the door to his flat at precisely seven-forty am. The wind isn’t as biting but there’s still the smell of rain in the air, like a promise on the tip of the tongue, ready to be spilled and said. Draco takes a long breath, his lungs filling with air smelling of falling leaves, a touch of petrol and petrichor. With lunch in his bag — a simple pesto with pasta, he doesn’t have time to make something more elaborate and the recipe is a one he could make over and over again without tiring of it — Draco embarks on the short journey to work. The twenty minutes he spends walking is the only cardio he will do today, apart from stumbling the three floors to his flat after drinking with Blaise and Pansy, so he takes the longer route that gives him at least a touch of trees, nice front lawns and bushes that would love to take over every part of the city if they were only given a chance. It’s a nice walk, really peaceful, with not so many people, because most of them either use cars or the main roads. It’s almost like walking in the suburbs, but instead of identical houses he passes tenement houses which Draco secretly would love to own.
Penelope and Draco stand up, wish Padma congratulations once again and silently exit the meeting room. When the glass door closes behind them and they’re on the way to their desks, Penelope says, “We are screwed, aren’t we?”
It was a… peaceful, all the days that had passed working side by side with Malfoy, Harry was astounded to say. Peaceful, full of research, occasional comment here and there from one of them about the other; how Harry’s taste in clothes was really bad and how Malfoy was definitely too preppy for the whole curse job, just look at his tailored trousers and blazers! Sometimes they even went the old memory lane, reminiscing about Hogwarts day. “How did you know where I was, at school? It was creepy, you know.” To which Harry only shrugged, put his hands in front of him and wiggled his fingers, whispering, “Magic, Malfoy.” It made the other man huff a laugh. Harry counted that as a win, as he combed his hair wit his hand, looking at Malfoy from the side, trying to be sneaky about it.
“One…” Draco whispered back, taking his hand from Harry’s back which made the place he was touching feel empty and hollow, like all of Harry right now.
The eyes opened for a brief second, closed and opened again. “I’m not as dramatic as you, Harry,” and then Draco was wrapped in a strong hug from Harry Potter.
“Well, next time please just don’t…” He gestured widely at Draco, unable to say the words “surprise me from behind,” without knowing that his cheeks would likely go much redder and he didn’t want Draco to get any ideas. “Do that.”
When they were both led out onto the fresh air — cold and wet, but not like
Draco seemed to take him all in, from head to toe and Harry could swear that something of an almost smile, the corner of his lips, turned up. “Well,” he said, his grey eyes as steely as his voice. “Did not expect you here. Potter,” he nodded and stood up in one fluid motion from the floor he was kneeling on, wand still in hand.
He swore under his breath, the “
Do not hesitate to contact me if anything new comes up.
, thought Harry, trying to sooth his face into a relaxed mask of indifference while trying not to flinch and show how deeply his boss’ words cut to the bone,
“First, we will start with the Accounts Payable, then move onto the Treasury Team, then Accounts Receivable, and General Ledger. You know the drill,” she looks at Draco, Bertha and Emma. “The rest of you is new here, especially you Harry,” she sends the man an apologetic smile. Draco furrows his brows for a second but he makes his face go impassive with the new information he just got. “If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Due to the tight deadline we will have calls every two days to check on the progress and if needed we can have them every day. I know you think this is impossible,” Susan turns off the projector and stands in the middle of the room. “Because of the deadline, but I can assure you, I oversaw worse migrations. Thank you for today and see you in two days,” she finishes, looking at each one of them. Draco wonders if Pansy does the same thing, but then her work environment is different. She has, after all, entitled white cis IT guys who think the world is their oyster and she is one of the few women of colour in the company.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “When I say I didn’t see ghosts then I mean it. And yes, I saw ghosts,” he said, seeing Harry opening his lips and wanting to ask precisely the same question. “You forgot where I grew up.”
But… how do I say it???
, but instead he focused on his Auror training and thus he didn’t see the crack that has become a ravine he couldn’t possibly jump over.
“That’s all I ask,” said Harry and his heart beat a little bit faster. He only needed that; work, something to do, to pass the time that was otherwise empty. After running for so long he found out that normal life was a tad too tedious for his taste. Or maybe he just wasn’t doing it right? He didn’t know.
As Susan disappears behind the corner Potter looks up and there’s a sparkle of mischief of sorts in his eyes.
“Well, mine said that the blame will finally go away but I’m still waiting for that to happen. Workin on it, though,” Draco saluted with his left hand and took another sip, the water crystal clear against his long fingers, gleaming in the sun.
And there was Draco. Harry sometimes, when he was lying in the darkness of his small flat, would think about the other boy, the man he had become. Who had to run and hide, who had to carry the burden of his family’s sins and who would be forever judged by them. Who had loving parents but who, in the end, betrayed him on some level.
When Harry thought about his next case he didn’t think that he would get a haunted house with a haunted garden and haunted cemetery, but.
“I knew you were a tea snobber, Malfoy!”
The pace he started with wasn’t the fastest but also not the slowest; it should be manageable, especially in these conditions. Humidity was very high, he could hear Draco’s long breaths behind him, accompanying him with the rustle of leaves he tried to clear, or at least hold, for the other man. The birds, if there were any, were silent and Harry gripped his wand the whole time, knuckles white, eyes sharp and alert for any movement.
Exactly what Blaise said. Talk to him.
And he is asking for updates? Now? A guy from IT wants to know, after fixing the issue, if everything is still alright?
His computer beeps again; Draco frowns. What he also needs to do is either plug the headphones for good or just make the beeping stop every time he gets an email or somebody wants to chat him up on Teams.
Malofy scoffed at that and Harry looked up from the runs at the man. “We both were shitty teenagers, let’s agree on that.” Malfoy wiped his hands still covered in chalk in an expensive looking handkerchief, which was probably monogrammed as all pureblood things did, Harry though. “Let’s hope we grew out of our childish behaviour and are better adults now.”
He thinks and thinks until he hears giggles and whispers and a wave of people who just finished their lunch slowly come back to their desks, filling the open space with restless energy.
Four years. Four bloody years, he thinks to himself walking past Halloween decorations that look like him after a long week at work, all dried out and spat out, left to his own devices to haunt the open space and his flat (and the bar he, Blaise and Pansy sometimes go to, when he’s invited). His friends have been telling him for months to quit this job and find something with more life and work balance but it’s easier said than done, especially for them since they still got the fortunes assigned to them at birth in case something happens. They don’t have fathers with gambling problems, mothers who still pretend the Malfoys are at the height of their social status like they were when she got married to Lucius.
thank god you agreed to marry me
“Um, yeah, ok,” said Harry weakly, brushing his damp hair with his fingers. Ron shook his head and rolled his head, threw a spell Harry’s way that dried his hair — and thus gave it even more a life on its on — and before The Boy Who Lived knew he was gripping tightly Hermione’s elbow as they apparated before Narcisia Mafloy’s country house.
Shit, yeah, thought Harry, his mind showing him the walls of Malfoy Manor, the furniture that looked more ancient than those in the antique store, how the portraits looked at him, only their eyes moving as if they were frozen in place, following his every step.
way to go, D! :D :D :D :D
“Shut up Ron. You,” Hermione pointed at Harry without turning around, who was using a second towel to dry his hair, while the first one hung from his shoulder. “Wear the white shirt, the burgundy sweater and the black jeans.”
When he finally stopped at the bottom, the stone plate beneath his feet smooth and solid under his feet, he breathed a little bit better.
They looked at each other, breathing heavily from the rush of adrenaline and the literal rush down the stairs; Harry could feel a drop of sweat on his left temple. Harry licked his lower lip while Draco looked at him then at the door.
“It’s cold, it will help,” said Harry with a huge grin, as he took another sip of the water, watching the other man in the corner of his eyes.
“Hm?” He says, looking up to see a somewhat hesitatingly smiling Penelope Clearwater, the newest addition to the team. Today her long, black hair is in a side braid that ends near her sternum.
He stopped thinking about his sexuality some time ago. It doesn’t matter, at least not to Draco. And after all, what is supposed to happen will happen, so. Or not, as is his case.
It was it, wasn’t it?
He knew even before they started to run, before their fingers touched, before they followed a fairy down the catacombs, that they were in some deep shit. Harry looked around, from time to time moving aside a gigantic green leaves of ferns that were as long and big as his body, the green buds much softer to the touch than he thought. The greenery seemed to be overwhelming them, smallowing the two men whole, every leaf bigger and greater than up above, in their world; the air was thick and moist and Harry was glad for permanent cleaning charms because otherwise he would have to be wiping off the droplets that had gathered on his glasses every few minute.
You’ve got our attention. Tell us more.
“Aurors,” Draco muttered under his breath, shaking his head in disapproval. “The doors are new. These are the fourth ones in a matter of weeks. Miss Perrywinkle had to replace each one of them because they were always destroyed from the inside.”
He expected the night to grow cold, weird sounds around them making his skin crawl and his hand tighten around a wand. But it couldn’t be further from that: it was quiet, apart from the peaceful and comforting crackle of fire, the soft hum of moving branches that reminded Harry of the holidays commercials that sometimes popped out on his computer’s screen the few times he used it (he didn’t abandon the muggle world, he sort of… slipped out of it, like a side character that was no longer needed). He sat cross-legged on the smooth grass, and thought,
His heart does some elaborate beat in his chest while Draco holds his breath. It could be nothing, a simple follow-up question after the meeting, something about their shared project, but deep inside Draco doesn’t want Potter’s message to be about that, not entirely. What he wants it to be, he is not sure, but he clicks on icon of Teams.
It reminds Draco of walking along the French beach just before college, where for a moment he forgot about everything and just
What do you want to know? Is it legal? Yes. Is it against a code of conduct at your workplace? If he doesn’t work in your department and isn’t your supervisor it’s probably ok.
He didn’t know what was worse; how his mother clearly loved Draco but who couldn't choose the wellbeing of her only child over anything else.
Fortunately, Penelope looks at Lockhart as if she, too, knows how to deal with him. “I completely agree with Draco. At this point I cannot do much, yet, but I see Padma and Draco staying after hours every day. I do what I can but it’s too little and both of them have to take away some time off work to show me how to pay even the simplest things. I want them to help me more but it’s humanly impossible for them to sit all day with me to see if I’m doing the processes correctly and I’m currently working as hard as I can to remember the processes.” She finishes with a small and pitiful shrug. Draco wants to say that she’s doing great, especially for someone for whom this is a first time working in this kind of environment, but he doesn’t want the subject of the conversation to distract Lockhart.
After a brief pause during which the whole world seemed to stop, Draco said, “Why would you think that I would want that,” and Harry would gladly beat that stupid mug of his.
“Sheer luck, I guess?”
don’t you worry we’ve got you
“Ah, Hermione dear,” said the woman, flicking back her long, blond hair. She looked almost as Harry remembered her, with a few more lines on her face but definitely more content and happy than she was before. “Come in, come in. My son is just packing his suitcase upstairs…” She said, staring straight into Harry’s eye. “His room is at the end of the upper hall, on the far left.” Narcisia opened the doors wider to let them in. “Mathilda,” she said to a house elf that materialized just by her leg, in a bright pink dress with strawberries on them. “Please bring tea to my reading room.”
They run through the last steps and rushed through the entrance to the catacombs to find the light disappearing in a doorway poised behind the sarcophagus that Draco painted around with runes. Its surface shivered as if it was an ocean on an extremely hot day, and it sparkled with the same electricity like the eyes of the feary.
, he adds, wishing he took the sweater from his desk as the meeting room is definitely too cold and Draco hasn’t even had his coffee yet. So he stares at Gildery dumbly, trying to comprehend what he’s saying, the meaning behind all the words that just spill out of his mouth, one by one.
“The stuff on the ground would lit, probably,” he eyed all the fallen leaves, curled and dry, that looked like hay from far away. “Didn’t they teach you that stuff in Auror’s school?”
Harry laughed, “But you were! Always showing off what you got from your parents, always with a full escort!”
Sorry!

“Already thinking about the worst?”
“I’m bi. That means I’m bisexual.”
Draco knelt — not too close but not out of reach — and folded his coat, placing it gingerly on the ground, not looking at Harry, his eyes solely focused on the stream before him. He cupped his hands and lowered them to the stream to take first sips of water with his eyes closed.
Padma sits in her chair and pufs a long breath.
Few people made him feel that way. Blaise didn’t stand a chance and he never got one; the two of them were inseparable as children and it continued well into their thirties. With Pansy it was a chance, one in a million, because he could have ignored her, could have walked into the class, found a place, and never met her again.
Sometimes, when silence fell between them, a comfortable one which puzzled Harry the first time it had happened, he
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cool?”
“Only a little, babe, but you’re so smart I love it,” Ron stepped closer to his wife and gave her an obscenely loud kiss on the cheek. “Now take our loverboy to his destination and you,” he turned towards Harry, pointing a finger at him. “Don’t come back without talking to Malfoy, I beg you.”
Draco gave him a look that would make Harry take a step. “What, Harry Potter already bailing? Is the case too boring for you? Too…”
“We are barely managing as we speak,” says Draco, as calmly as he can, even though his insides are boiling from anger. He is used to hiding his emotions and feelings; after all, what kind of a Malfoy would he be if he showed the whole world how pissed he is? It would not serve any purpose and would only make Lockart more hostile than he already is. “And we’re mainly managing because of overtime. Even if Penelope was at the same level as we and Padma are, I’m sure we would still be behind. We need a fourth person, Lockhart, even if Padma is on her maternity leave. This would make our schedule more flexible and if you hire somebody as soon as possible then we would have tangible help while Padma is away and hopefully she would be able to pass on some of her vast knowledge of the processes.” Draco says with utmost care of the words that leave his mouth; not one of them can be hostile or Lockhart will close himself up on his higher position and not even look down on them, who actually do the work day to day.
As the fifth floor comes closer, the elevator slows down. The man puts his phone in his pocket and lifts his head to look straight at Draco.
“I have no idea, Draco,” with a smirk Harry drank from the thermos and pulled a face when the bitterness of the tea hit his tongue. “God, you’re right it’s truly awful.”
Harry Potter, IT consultant.
“Come on, Potter!” Draco screamed at the top of his lungs it seemed like, his feet striking the earth as if he was flying and barely touching it. “No lagging behind!”
Harry just sighed, deeply, from within his bones, “You just sort of looked as if you didn’t believe what I was saying, that’s all.”
Draco sent him a look that could be interpreted as “You say one word and I will kill you,” or, “Don’t you dare to laugh,” at the same time, with nothing in between. When he was done he gently placed another rune, this one big as his own hand, wrapped in a red cloth and covered it with a thin layer of dirt before he sent Harry on the other side of the garden to place the braid in as a perfect circle as he could muster.
Draco looked behind him, craning his neck as if he was looking back at something far beyond him. “Nothing much, to be honest. Just more for those and these,” he pointed at the giant ferns and palms that Harry knew he saw in floral shops around London. There, they were around Harry’s waist, leaves thin and tender, but now something cracked in his neck as he tried to see their tops. “I think it would be best if we went a little bit further just to see what’s out there, but we need something that would lead us back to the doors. The wall,” he corrected himself, looking at the wall behind Harry, cringing.
Draco knows. He knows what’s going to come out of Padma’s lips and he hates himself because he doesn’t want to hear it. He doesn’t want Padma’s happiness and rainbows, and doesn't want to congratulate her at all.
“Ah,” said the creature and Harry slowly looked up and would shiver when it showed its teeth but his mind was still too absorbed in what he saw on the water’s surface and that in the corner of his eyes he caught Draco’s hands tightly wrapped around armrests, knuckles white and protruding so hard they might break the skin. “Such a simple thing, to want. Easily granted. Just
, like flying or being really drunk and not knowing what was happening but being happy nonetheless.
“But I don’t think we like that answer,” she adds, brows furrowed and Draco moves closer with his chair. Padma is right; the message asks more questions as if their email, with screenshots, wasn’t enough. It should be, but what does Draco know about the inner workings of an IT department.
He writes, hitting ‘send’ immediately after typing. The moment the message goes out he can see that it’s been viewed, as if Harry had the chat already opened, waiting, hoping…
“Hello, guest,” they said to Draco, the voice deep and yet wistful at the same time. “Welcome to the land. What brings our esteemed guests here?”
“Oh, I’ve got that,” Harry took out his wand and from its tip a string of golden rope emerged; Harry took it and pulled, the rope coming out from the wand until he was sure that he had enough to wrap it around the wall and himself. “It’s neverending rope, it should disappear in eight to ten hours and I can make it invisible if I want to,” he said as he walked back to the wall, the rope warm in his hand like a lukewarm coffee on a cold, snowy day. He took its end, walked around the wall and wrapped it into a simple knot, making a circle around the bricks. “That should hold,” he said, taking the other end and tying around one of the hoops of his belt. He tugged at it, once, and looked up with a proud smile on his face to see Draco watching him — his fingers to be more precise — very carefully.
“A big and loud distraction. Could you do that?”
On the fifth floor Draco feels a little bit warmer as if a small present was just given to him and he walks into the open space not really paying attention. He’s not the first at work as the AR team always starts earlier. It’s a mixture of traffic jams after 4 pm and getting kids from school, so they decided to start at seven and to finish at three. Bizarrely early for Draco, but apparently it works for them — apart from the month ends they almost always leave just at the clock strikes four.
So Harry did. He told everything that had happened, drank the two glasses of water Hermione put in his hand without question and then the potion that the healer also gave him. He explained and talked until there wasn’t anything more to explain, until his throat felt slightly raw and his head was swimming in thoughts.
“And there are the lights They usually come at night, near full moon or right after it. They don’t look like ghosts, either.”
what’s their name, how old are they and are they above you on the fantastical corporate ladder?
ignored his warning, but stopped himself. What his line of work taught him was that he should first think and only then act — something he was really working on — and knowing that this argument would mean nothing and would only make them hate each other more (if it was even possible) he decided to shut up.
“Our gracious host was asking if you’re enjoying the meal,” said Draco, politeness dripping off his tongue like a poison coated in sweetness and Harry felt his cheek blushing.
He put his hands on his hips and looked up at the uneven, round shape ceiling, thinking of how much he did not want to punch Draco Malfoy right now. How the hell did he know, after meeting him the first time in what, seven years? how to push his buttons was beyond Harry. But Draco did it so effortlessly, like he was born to do it; to piss him off, to make Harry want to rip his head off, to push him against the wall and…
“The only thing we can do is to get used to it,” says Padma Patill, the second longest hire in the team. As every Friday she’s trying to pay every European invoice, which usually takes around for hours and she does it with precision Draco is proud of. He taught her but one can always see when the other person doesn’t take what they do seriously and Padma is serious about her work. Maybe it’s because of the paycheck and maybe it’s because she’s been laid off from her two previous jobs in accounting due to the layoffs in those companies, or at least that’s what Draco heard. “The Icelandic bank is, unfortunately, a bitch when you need it the most.”
At the same time the creature stood up and made a very loud sound that Harry could only describe as a pitiful moan mixed with a low growl of a threatened animal; it lifted it’s head, the moonlight glistening from its teeth, made the sound and took off, fast, its wings beating at an unusual speed, but sporadically as if flight took a toll on them. But the thing was fast and the desperation made it faster yet.
Lockhart puts his hands with clasped fingers on the table and smiles at them. It’s borderline creepy.
Harry did, as Draco took his tightly clasped hand and put it in on his breast bone so he could feel the slow and steady rise and fall of his chest. Harry closed his eyes and started counting, from ten to one and breathed in, counted to ten yet again and breathed out. Draco’s breath on his cheeks was warm and in a normal situation would make Harry blush as well as the fact that they were forehead to forehead, breathing in unison.
“So,” Harry said, looking ahead of him and not at the Malfoy who, he could swear it, flinched a little bit when he spoke. “Why faeries? I mean it’s a cool subject, and very... unorthodox.”
“Just…” For a moment Harry was looking for appropriate words, combing hair with his fingers and he shook his head slightly. “Just... forget it. Yes, hi, it’s me, I am the Auror. You’re the Curse Breaker. Let’s just…” He sighed, deeply, turning off the

Harry blinked in surprise, but despite not wanting to talk about the summer he knew that was unavoidable.

situation of all situations, but hopefully they’d get over it in a minute or so. And at least the first year Slytherins knew better than to doubt him, when they saw him smile rather wickedly.
He saw Mr. Malfoy smirking again as he resumed “looking” at the parchment on the table like he wasn’t fully listening in.
Harry heard a ghostly wail in the distance as his hand dropped, the wand clattering to the ground, watching an ash-covered

“Well… neither do you?”
“Well, this isn’t a shock, but it sure is nauseating first thing in the morning.” A voice cut Harry and Draco’s mild-mannered bickering off mere meters from the entrance to the Great Hall, and Blaise felt a tick form in his temple.
He heard the frown in Draco’s voice. “Over the summer? I mean maybe it’s just-” Harry got curious and turned to look at him when he cut himself off, seeing the blond shake his head rapidly. “No! No, don’t listen to me, listen to Pomfrey—whatever she says.”

. It made his heart skip a beat as he clutched it slightly closer instinctively.
“Then please take a seat, I will collect the materials prepared for it.” He left shortly and Harry reluctantly slid into one of the chairs, with Draco and his parents wordlessly following suit.
“I hate you.”
his freakish red hair. It wasn't orange like a carrot or pink like a strawberry blonde or fake cherry red like those dyed 'freaks' Petunia and Vernon crossed the street to avoid, but a deep red so vibrant it was like curls of blood, the exact shade of a red delicious apple with highlights a fascinating golden-red that reminded him of gleaming mermaid scales in a book he once read when no one was looking in the school library. It was a majestic color like a vibrant sunset, the darkest feathers on a pretty cardinal, the deep sweet promise of a ripe fresh tomato on a heavy summer day, or the refined red velvet of Christmas-season ribbons. It reminded him of every good memory he had, and he had so preciously few of those that it kind of took him off guard to be overwhelmed with this feeling all at once, and so out of the blue.
“It’s Saturday November 2

allowed to use magic if their lives are in danger. The rule is there to protect budding magical cores, and also prevent chaos of muggleborn children using magic out in the muggle world where it’s slightly harder to regulate it, but like any weapon it’s meant for self defense particularly when it comes to the defense of children. Yeah you might still get in trouble initially because bureaucracy and all that nonsense, but to get it overturned would be easy, especially if you have a healer vouching that it was necessary.” She finally lowered her wand, the mist disappearing, and he watched her warily as she caught his eye.
Unfortunately, even if Quirrell bought it, it didn’t matter.
So Severus was on guard for pretty much just about anything when he opened it, in hopes this would actually be the answer he was looking for.
Neville sprinkled water over the flowers in greenhouse 3, tending to Ginger Leaf Poppies and venomous Arboreal Jumping Lilies at Professor Sprout’s request. She’d known immediately that he had talent in Herbology and offered to let him help in his spare time, which he’d taken up without much fuss shortly after starting at Hogwarts.

Harry sighed, not even needing Neville to fully ask.
He felt…

“Can I make it long? Like really long?”
did you say there were?”
Harry was light and polite when he asked, and the tall boy beside him just turned his chin forwards once more. The Slytherin had been staring at him not so subtly since they left the Great Hall, and Draco had actually dropped behind them. His expression was calm and smooth as always, but Harry knew his stomach was in knots over this coming potions class. Harry couldn’t fault him—he sort of felt the same way but was apparently better at hiding it.
“I mean I guess. Sounds interesting.” He shrugged a bit, scratching the back of his head uncertainty. “There’s no Slytherins, right?”
"Aye—her hair was that exact color. She was mighty proud of it, she was, and I 'eard yer father rant about it often enough. 'E was a lovesick fool all seven years of Hogwarts for her so it was kind o’ well known. People called her a Fire Witch fer her 'air and her temper; was a forced to be reckoned with it was!" Hagrid laughed good naturedly, seeming lost in memories at the sight of his hair and not quite noticing Harry’s newly-dazed expression.

But then, as she finished her mini speech and turned to face them, she actually broke a smile. “Alright, put your dominant hand out over the broom and in a strong voice, say ‘up’.”
“…what of the tuition.”

His aunt paled, but she held her angry expression and ground her teeth together like she wanted to scream, like it all wanted to come spilling out… she looked about ready to do so too, but Harry had had enough. He knew nothing that came out of her mouth, answers or not, would be pleasant or unbiased.
Harry wasn’t concerned that fight was going to be finished later—after all, Montague had gotten what he wanted. Picking on a couple of first years was just an easy, extremely believable cover.
Because he would be dead a thousand times over if he couldn’t figure out how to protect himself without anyone’s help, and so somewhere along the line he’d become far more Slytherin than any Gryffindor before him had ever been by his knowledge. Hell, the hat had put him in Gryffindor

“I was excited for it since it definitely seemed like the most interesting of all the classes, and I like cooking so kind of thought the two skills would relate.

Mr. Malfoy had been a death eater.
Thanks to Hagrid’s rather long, rambling answers, just those questions took most of their time and they were approaching their stop when Hagrid popped in the query about his hat in the moment of silence as Harry pondered what his most pressing next question should be. If he hadn’t known that Hagrid was 100% just curious and held no judgement for why he was wearing a hat in the middle of July
All in all, breakfast actually went rather well. Be it everyone having already talked about their summer’s yesterday on the train without him and moved on from that by now, them happy to buy his implication his summer hadn’t been worth mentioning, excitement for the new year so close upon them, or a combination of all of it, but this particular group was more than happy to talk about classes and the magical world in general instead of anything else. Harry was almost surprised how easy it was to switch back into ‘social mode’, the persona he’d worn all year last term as he went around meeting everyone he could in attempts to convince them he wasn’t just his famous title or a stupid rumor.
“No, Draco was.”
And maybe that’s why she’d given up on him eventually too.
he’d cause a royal racket and enough of a scene in full view of the neighbors if they peered over their fences to see what all the noise was about, that even Vernon would stop his spoiled son so to save face. Petunia would stop him as soon as she heard because she knew what her son might see and do anything to prevent it, so… not 100%, but it was a damn good safety measure, more than he’d ever had before given that he was always the one being locked in.

Harry sighed silently. They’d come a long way, but they had a lot farther to go.
The hat didn’t even properly touch his stupidly styled blond locks before it shouted Slytherin, almost as if it didn’t really want to waste time on an already done deal.
"Sure." He agreed easily, shifting a bit to stand and wait as Harry got his measurements done. After a little while of awkward silence, he seemed to perk up in alarm and then suddenly got a very guilty look on his face for split second before controlling it back into something more blank. Harry had a fun time watching this play out in the mirror where Draco didn’t realize he could see him.
You see, he had the equation, but he was getting an answer different than what the rest of the world, when, according to math, that really shouldn’t be possible.

Instantly Snape felt his shoulder hunch and a scowl sear across his expression.

Instead of snapping back that he was his own man or getting defensive in his masculinity about the hand-holding comment though, Draco just turned
Did I forget to mention this was a whump fic?
After that had been chaos—Dudley screamed and Harry dragged him back just as the snake got the idea that he was free. Harry didn’t want to say he was jealous of a snake, but he was definitely jealous of a snake as it slumped its huge body out of the enclosure with haste and started slithering away to its freedom.
“That’s so cool,” Harry blinked. “So you can enhance sense with a pair of glasses?”
“Acromantula venom actually ‘as a ton ‘o uses ya know, fer potion makin’ and one or two old alchemy tricks—ah, but they don’t teach alchemy at Hogwarts anymore, such a shame that is.” Hagrid chatted, seeming happy to keep talking so long as he had a listener and Harry was just content to jog along with his huge pace and take it in. “Venom like Aragog’s is pretty pricy too—‘bout a ‘undred galleons a pint I’d say, cause it dries up in hours after a spider dies like that, and milking a live one is impossible if yer not friends with tha beast!

Besides, getting him out from under Dumbledore’s care would be a lovely bonus if they played their cards right.

Everyone else? If they didn’t know it was a thing in the case of many muggleborn families, or just didn’t do it as many pureblood and half-blood families didn’t bother, there really was no repercussion if you didn’t get caught. And not getting caught was pretty easy to do—muggleborns weren’t aware it was a thing but typically assumed they were tracked everywhere so didn’t use magic even on vacations, and pureblood families fixed it with simple privacy wards preventing the Ministry from peering into their business. And even if the Ministry could, due to their cheap wards they wouldn’t be able to tell if it was the kids or the adults in the family performing the magic.
Draco closed his eyes and Harry could swear that he turned his face just a millimeter closer to his; that his hair brushed his nose and cheek and when he opened his eyes there was steel in them and the sort of fearlessness that one didn’t acquire or grew into but was born with. It made Harry straighten his back and shoulder, which made Draco’s lips twitch a little; a beginning of a smile.
But Padma is leaving soon, even though she’s making a brave face she is making a tiny human in her body and that takes some energy, patience, concentration and carefulness away from daily things such as work. Even if she grumbles, Draco will try to persuade her to leave early: he is not a monster. And Padma deserves it. She deserves the peace, her family deserves to have this special time with her and the baby. There’s also Penelope, who so easily introduced the idea of looking for a new job that Draco has to admit, for a second there he was baffled. Maybe that’s the generational gap between millennials who don’t change jobs this often (or maybe, a small voice says inside his head, it's your parents talking about people who change their jobs constantly and who can’t find a place for themselves. These flimsy people with no appreciation for work, they all end up either on the streets or at the bottom of the ladder, begging for scraps) and gen z, who don’t treat companies as their families, but as a job, one they can quit anytime they want.
It seemed a simple decision to Harry but Draco pondered over it for long, angushingly long minutes. At some point he just stared at the Kit Kat for a full sixty seconds before his eyes darted to the packet of salted nuts.
“Where’s your coat?” Asked Hermione when he was putting his boots on.
“Of course,” said Draco, as if unfazed by the teeth and Harry’s head snapped towards him, stifling a scream of “Have you seen their bloody teeth?!” before it could escape his lips. “We would be delighted. However, I am sorry to say we cannot stay long; there are people waiting for us Above.”
Around one, when most people on his part of the open-office stand up to stand in line for the microwaves in the kitchen, Draco takes his phone out of the cupboard of his mini-cabinet and opens a chat he has with Blaise and Pansy.
“Well, not in England you can not, but there are some people who specialise in them and were eager to share the knowledge.”
True to her words, immediately after the meeting Susan sends out a summary, point by point with the timeline. Draco clicks at the attachment where the whole timeline of the project is presented in such a clear and simple way Draco wants to weep. Not everyday you get somebody who understands that communication, especially in a company setting, must be efficient and as short as possible. How many meetings could have been emails? How many emails could not exist if the sender gave themselves a couple of minutes to look for the answer to his question instead of asking it? So many Draco cannot count, and many of them are waiting for his unwavering attention.
observant,” Draco gave him a dry smile and Harry gritted his teeth before he said something stupid. “How did Miss Perrywrinke manage to get the famous Harry Potter on her case? You only get the ones with the most photos for the Daily Prophet, don’t you? Please don’t tell me they’re waiting outside, I didn’t do my skin care routine this morning.”
While the bank tries to process the payments — for the fourth time that day — he clicks the Outlook icon and takes a deep breath seeing the number of new emails. Two more and he will have a very round forty-two and he gives his colleagues about an hour to do this. He scrolls his folder until he gets to the newest ones and he sees that name again.
Draco feels like he lost his mind; as if every part of him logged off and went off to have a vacation in some tropical jungle leaving his body by itself in a semi-warm meeting room where he couldn’t focus on the simplest things, like taking notes or asking questions. He feels, at the same time, the anxiety of being in the same room as Harry Potter and also a type of anger that’s like a smoldering piece of coal that doesn’t want to die down.
; his pulse spiked and the rush of blood made his cheeks heat. They started to run at the same moment, hand in hand and they jumped in the last moment, the air around them smelling of ozone and something burning, like human hair or an extinguished candle; and it was so fast. The moment they were on the other side it felt as if they were attacked by green leaves and the heaviness of the air around them made their hair cling to their skin. Harry blinked a couple of times and adjusted his glasses.
He can feel the heat on his cheeks but he doesn’t want others to know there’s anything amiss so Draco stares at the moving dots on his phone.
do you want to go for a romantic dinner with him where after four hours of interesting and stimulating conversation you continue the stimulation in bed, naked?
“So, how are you feeling?”
and his wand immediately lit up, but they didn’t have time; the fairy was fast and it was flying while they were jumping from step to step, trying not to stand on those that were cracked or which had crumbled under the sheer force of the quake. It didn’t help that the steps were still slippery and that there was no railing to lean on, except the cold walls which could collapse at them every moment.
“Hey,” Hermione smiled brightly and sat nearer his bed on a plastic chair. “How are you?”
didn't do his curse job well enough and because
“You coming?” Harry asked as the afterthought and when no answer came he looked back.
Malfoy squinted at him.
“Of course,” Draco says but his voice is icier and more vicious than he anticipated. Lockhart looks sharply at him and for a second something cracks in the mask the blonde man wears.
“I and the management don’t think it’s necessary. Cho comes back in what, three months? I think until then we can manage, even if it will be without Padma.”
Harry needed this job because he didn’t want to be on the cover of the Daily Prophet each time something happened, however, he wasn’t sure that trading the flash of the camera for grey eyes of one Draco Malfoy was better.
“Hey,” he said to no one in particular, but when the curly, dark hair of his friend Hermione loomed over him he squinted until he felt a familiar cold frames touching his face.
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL US?!
“Well,” Padma says, straightening and looking at the two of them. Draco balls his hands into fists, his fingernails biting into his skin while he tries his hardest to have a blank face. Years of training kick in and Draco can feel every muscle in his face locking in a neutral position, as if listening. “I just wanted you to know that I’m pregnant.” Padma adds, smiling even more than before. “I will be working as long as I can, I promise!” She adds after the initial congratulations from both of them.
“‘This stuff’, Potter, please.” Malfoy shook his head. “Apart from course work I also studied the fay. Don’t laugh,” he added quickly, mouth in a tight line, looking up expecting a rather different reaction from Harry because what he got was:
They walked and walked and walked, until Harry heard a noise, a sort of soft, humming one that a running water made. It was in front of them and if they turned slightly right…
The ancient, heavy metal doors were open and Harry peeked inside the long hall, that stretched down, down, into the darkness. He took out his hand which after a quick
“What do you need?”
“Like this!” Draco made a vague gesture with his free hands toward Harry as if as supposed to explain everything. “Shut up, you know what I mean!”
“So you got it covered, then?”
Lockhart is a good manager. Sometimes. Not always, really. But he is not the worst that Draco had. The bar is really low when it comes to Team Leaders, in Draco’s experience. At least Lockhart seems to care, unlike the previous person who was the Team Leader for Treasury Management; Quirrel was too soft spoken, too much of a coward to lead a team of two people and when finally the dam broke during a meeting with other team leaders he apparently shouted for three minutes non stop and left the room shutting the doors so harshly the glass that made up one wall of the room shook with the force.
“Yes, of course. Give me a second to long into the bank to see what kind of things are we going to be paying today,” he says, gesturing at the space next to him. Penelope gives him a genuine smile, clicks her pen rather dramatically and moves with her chair to Draco’s left so she can see the very convoluted way the Icelandic invoices are being paid at Stanson.
“How the hell are you alive, Potter?” Asked Draco, quite theatrically wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes. Harry shrugged at the question.
“So, what’s your theory then?” Asked Harry, bringing the conversation, and his thoughts, back to the topics at hand.
“You’re serious?”
Draco thought deeply, looking around them, while eating a piece of the bar; he licked the chocolate of his fingers, his tongue pink and Harry nearly got a heart attack.
“Alive,” he said without humor but Hermine laughed nonetheless. “Still groggy. How long…?”
He never met Dursley’s again after the war. Didn’t want to, didn’t need to. He had already a lot on his plate and having a panic attack in front of the only blood related family he had, just because he faced them and they brought back some very ugly memories to him, was not something he really wanted to experience. It was enough that sometimes he would lay in bed, his small bedroom dark, and watched the changing colours of the night on his ceiling having an existential crisis after an existential crisis.
Harry gritted his teeth when a branch struck him on his right side, just between his ribs and he would have stumbled and lost the grip on Draco’s hand if it wasn’t his sheer stubbornness that kept him upright.
“How do you know all this stuff?” Asked Harry when Draco stopped in front of him, looking over the circle with a critical eye.
As he steps into the elevator he can see in the mirror a movement; a shaggy, bowed head coming closer, focused on the screen in the person's hand. It’s the colour of the jacket that catches Draco’s eyes — bright orange, the colour a slushie would have — and the reflection of the phone’s screen in the round glasses. Without thinking Draco’s hand hovers over the button that won’t let the door close and the moment the man passes the threshold he picks his floor and backs to the opposite wall to make space. The man is shorter than him but then it’s easy to be shorter than Draco’s six feet two. He lifts his head and smiles at Draco, saying a quiet, “Thank you,” as he pushes the fifth floor. So the green eyes and shaggy, curly hair work at the same company but one floor down, huh? Thinks Draco as the elevator starts its climb up, wheezing a little. The building where the Stantons has its accounting department was built a few years ago but until you walked into the elevator you couldn’t say that; it’s all the wheezing and cracking the elevator does that gives the building’s age away.
Draco shakes his head, his fingers flying on the keyboard.
“Fairies? You studied them? That’s so cool!”
Draco moves Outlook onto the other monitor, not daring to click on the still loading site of the bank and opens the last email:
Malfoy snorted, throwing something that looked like one flip flop. “Yes, Potter, back to our surnames, I don’t know what did you expect.”
himself for it; hated because he felt it was his fault, he could have done better and more,
“Yes, why wouldn’t I be? It’s amazing that you went to all these places and learned so much.”
As Harry and Draco work together it turns out they aren't half as bad as they thought... And the ghost in the garden makes an appearance.
“Draco,” he said, taking him under his arm and hoisting him up, leaning him against the sarcophagus. “Draco, don’t die on me, please.”
Now, Draco.
“Ghasted thing that ghost is,” said Miss Perrywinkle over a second cup of lovely jasmine tea.  “Really horrendous, making all sorts of noises that nobody wants to listen to, waking me in the middle of the night. One of my sisters, Beatrice, used to do the same thing you see, waking me up in the middle of the night. I think she got it from our mother, Esther, who lived through the worst time during the World War. Did you know that in France....” and off she went, which Harry welcomed with a smile, a polite node and a bite of the exquisite biscuits. They were lovely; not too hard and not too moist. He wondered if the woman would give him the recipe.
Blaise.
Minutes pass but Draco doesn’t know how many: he simply doesn’t care. He is beyond caring. He trusts Susan enough to not ask any questions because he isn’t really sure if he can survive Potter staring at him as he speaks. And he’s not sure if he has enough confidence in his voice.
What strikes him is the disappointment he feels as he stares at the message. The emotion hooks itself inside Draco and doesn’t want to let go, no matter how much he tries to not think about its bitterness that’s nearly a tangible taste in the back of his throat. He tries not to think about it; not about the message and how  blatant of an invitation it is even to his eyes; how there’s a part of him that wishes he didn’t escape from the meeting room that fast; how, for the first time in his life, probably, Draco
The house itself was so normal, but fairy-tale normal. Hermione would show him this type of house on one of her pinterest boards and he knew that they existed, because otherwise there would be no photos, but still a witch would live in a house like this.
“Well, if the food is enough,” they said and Harry felt goosebumps rising on his arms; it was the same kind of feeling he got before he was to word-wrestle with his superior or the journalists. It was the same kind of nauseating feeling he had before he watched Ron go to action, when he waited for any news of Hermione’s childbirth pacing the halls of St Mungus nervously while Ron was with his wife.
He made himself take long breaths through his nose, his wand clasped on his hand, a charm already almost forming on his mouth; he felt the magic gathering in his wand, warm and sweet like hot tea with honey on a rainy and drafty day.
“Alright,” said Harry, ignoring the feeling of heat creeping up to his neck, the way his pulse get faster as something uncoiled in his veins, eager.
Draco shook his head, lowering hands again to take a few thirsty sips. “Thought so. You really had a death wish,” he added, his voice low as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
And this was how the aurors found them, running down the slippery steps, Ron Weasly at the front of them, wands raised.
. But then his job — the odd hours, him disappearing in the middle of then night and so on — put a shadow on the relationship.
Dracon has to clasp his trembling hands into fists under the table. “What if we don’t hit the deadline?”
his relationship with Ginny ended.
“Should we start a fire or something?” Harry asked, rummaging through the pockets of his coat, hand disappearing up to his elbow, frantically looking for something he was sure to have. After a minute and with a flourish he took out a few protein bars, a packet of salted and unsalted nuts and an unopened bar of chocolate. “What, they’re in perfect condition and none of it is expired!” He said as Draco looked rather unimpressed at the things Harry seemingly salvaged from the depths of his very deep pocket. He laid the packets down, carefully as if they were made out of gold or a precious metal, on the grass and waved a hand around them. “Pick whatever you want.”
Draco furrows his brows, hesitates for a few long breaths before his fingers start clicking.
The other man took the drink, swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing and he made a wretched sound which made Harry laugh.
*fuck you gif*
“From your lips it sounds like an accusation.”
Draco smiles, not looking at Padma. The course language is yes, highly unprofessional, but also very needed, especially recently. After Cho Chang left for her maternity leave, Padma got all her work just a month shy of being hired so of the people in the team Draco thinks she got it the worst. Christening through pain and fire, paperwork and long hours over Chang’s notes that even she didn’t understand.

“In Egypt?”
is not something that’s on the top of Draco’s list.
Lockhart blinks at him. “Well, we won’t discard them just because of another project, won't we? That would be very unprofessional!”
“Oh,” said Harry, feeling a cold shiver go down his spine. As if Draco felt it too, he looked at the other man and nodded.
“Hey, Harry” said a voice as if from a far, gentle and kind; a cold hand wrapped around his and another one started gently massaging the back of his neck.
“But of course! We would not like to keep our esteemed guests longer than anticipated,” said the creature, bowed and started backing up. Then Harry saw what was behind it, and to say it was a ‘feast’ was like to say that Hogwarts was magnificent; on a previously empty meadow a table appeared draped in a cloth so white aunt Petunia would just die from jealousy. And on it, food was almost spilling on the ground; shining green grapes and apples red like blood in golden bowls; yellow mangoes sliced and each of the slices with small, golden forks in it. Bananas laid next to shiny pineapples and fruits Harry couldn’t name were carefully placed on the table so that the whole thing looked like a renaissance painting ready to be plucked out of the frame out of the frame and eaten with delight.
“Just those that have crucial information, the rest is fine,” wrote Potter and Draco shook his head. Everything he had open was ‘crucial information’, that was your whole job when you were Senior Treasury Management Specialist. You knew bank accounts and passwords, you logged into those banks using tokens that were shorter and thicker than his thumb, you made transfers for amounts you would never see on your private account. Draco had to close every website and Excel he had opened and only then he accepted the request from Harry Potter to get this bloody thing with SharePoint fixed once and for all.
“Get ready,” said Draco, voice so very low that a shiver went through Harry’s whole body; in anticipation of what was going to happen or arousal? Probably both, he thought, as he mimicked the other man’s movements.
Harry Potter
*hair flip gif*
Harry looked down at the pieces of red twine weaved with tree branches that had their bark peeled, the sap soaking in the twine making it more black than red. Every finger’s length, a run carved out of a white stone, no bigger than half of his hand, would be braided into the thing that was almost as long as Harry.
A cold breeze flew through them and Harry’s mind wandered to the one time when Dudley, on purpose, closed all the doors and didn’t let him it; it was a December night, much colder than this and the Dursley were out having a dinner or trying to impress Vernon’s boss, he didn’t remember. But the coldness, how it seeped through his skin to his bones, how his little body of a eight year old trembled while trying, desperately, to open the door.
Draco was leaning against one of the palm trees, his head bowed, his body curled down. For a moment Harry thought that there was something interesting on the ground but then, very slowly, like a snake uncoiling, ready to attack, Draco straightened, his cheeks red, holding his coat in front of himself like a shield.
Just before he closes everything a new email arrives in his mailbox about an IT ticket that was successfully closed.
“Oh, for… Shut the hell up, Malfoy,” said Harry, painfully massaging his face thinking how much would it hurt if he gouged his own eyes out and if it was worth it. The alternative was to look at Draco Malfoy’s smug smile that made his blood boil and not in an angry way,
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know that, Potter, you don’t need to remind me. If you’re looking for validation, though, you’re definitely looking in the wrong place.”
So, he laid in his bed and thought and regretted, until there were tears spilling down his cheeks. And when the roots become too much, the pit growing into
He keeps his friends very close and tries to walk to the other side of the road when he meets his enemies. And there aren’t lots of them, Draco Malfoy doesn’t tell people that he doesn’t like them all that much. There are a few people that could be found under this category, but they are mostly family and he hasn’t seen them in years. As an adult it is important to keep your priorities straight and meeting people, regularly at that, who make him feel
He never… thought about it. Maybe he never
“Look at us,” said Harry, with a grin, face turned towards the sun, feeling his hair curling and drying under it. He thought about the children they were; one desperate for friendship and father figure, a fish out of water accepting everything that went his way because he didn’t know better; the other and aristocrat whose whole upbringing was about trying to nail this one, perverse idea about the supremacy of blood, his blood. And now they were sitting, side by side, by a stream in a faery land.
.” Draco adds, to which Harry replies with a bright smile and a seemingly unbothered shrug.
“I would ask what you’re doing here but I think I already have the answer,” Harry gestured with his wand at the books Malfoy casually spread out on the floors; the symbols and runes written in white chalk around the square, simple sarcophagus that seemed to be done from one piece of stone.
“Ah, alright, thanks.”
“Will we get another person to help?”
Draco raised an eyebrow.
“The best I’ve had,” Harry lied smoothly, clicking the thermos and pouring some of the liquid to the cap and handed it to Draco. Their fingers brushed and an electricity current ran through Harry’s fingers to his hand and further; he averted his eyes from Draco’s mouth to his dark green scarf, not really trusting himself.
Draco, sweete, mah darling DO NOT FRET
scene in the blockbuster supposed movie turn him on?
Only when the door disappears after them do the stop and look around and wonder: what the hell did we just do???
“...so you see, Draco, the deadline for the project is the end of the year. Yes, I know we don't have much time but the management is pushing and I know that you’re doing such good work, so it’s entirely possible we will make it!” He adds, giving Draco that toothy perfect white smile. Draco has to restrain himself, otherwise those pretty teeth would be on the not so pretty carpet and he doesn’t really want to think about all the blood on the table and chairs.
“Shit, it's disappearing,” he said just as Harry noted that the shine and the outline of the door started to get fainter and fainter with every second.
“Don’t drink anything but water,” he said, low, only for Harry’s ears. “And let me do the talking,” to which Harry smiled like Draco didn’t already assume that role. The other man must have read it from the smile or Harry’s eyes, because he shook his head lightly in amusement and went towards the table, their hands still clasped, no, their fingers entwined, which made Harry blush and try to hide it by bowing his head.
cupcake, no questions, course he likes you, he would be a bloody idiot if he didn’t
Harry looked at Draco and was impressed by how neutral his face looked. No fear, no pleasantness, no fake smile plastered on it. Just Draco staring at the creature as if waiting for more.
, he thought bitterly, wand already in his tight grasp and he sighed, again, and started casting to see what he had gotten himself into.
“Run!” Draco screamed and pulled Harry, who trailed after him. He felt a hiss of hot air behind him, heard the roar of voices as he and Draco started running through the jungle, the rope their only indicator, their only guide, of where they were going. Because the road has changed, and Harry felt that rather than seen, as they were jumping above the suddenly emerging from earth roots while shoving leaves away, they seemed to elongate and grow even more near each other; the leaves seemed to be sharper and Harry hissed a few time when a branch struck him particularly viciously drawing blood.
He could feel his cheeks blushing and not for the first time in his life he was glad that his darker complexion hid the first signs of embarrassment very well.
Or don’t rejoice at all, he thinks sourly, just pile up all the emails there are and drown him in them. Let him die a swift death under all the paper, at least it will soak up the juices of his decomposing body. Once again ecology wins!!
The creature blinked and cooked their head left, the branch-like veins outlined under the skin moved in a way that Harry felt an acidic taste at the back of his throat. The veins pulsed, bulged for a second, and then went back to their normal visage and Harry had a very nasty flashback to when Mister Dursley would go very angry and everything in him, veins including, would just grow and pulsed dangerously with his heartbeat.
. Truly, faithfully and for himself — so that the only person he could disappoint was himself and himself only — until he was finally sure that everything around him was as he wanted it to be.
Just as he opens their accounting program Lockkart’s head pops out from behind the meeting room.
Fuck Jesus Christ and Mary, he thinks, while sitting opposite of Gilderoy. Fuck them
It was cold on his tongue and mouth and there was something heavenly pleasant about it; it reminded him about those times at Privet Drive when he would wrap himself in a blanket and do his homework all night and when he emerged the air was cool yet, without the heat of the sun which was slowly coming up. He drank some more and risend his face with it, then hair, smiling at the cooling sensation.
and Harry wanted them to be so
But the eyes still watched him, transfixed on his face and Harry heard his heartbeat in his ears. If only he wasn’t afraid to move he would have grabbed his wand and started to run,
The email is still there when he blinks. The two previous emails are also questions regarding the issues he previously had. Draco looks at them for a moment wondering if they’re a plea for help or if something is wrong with their IT department.
Lockhart sits on the opposite side of their three and it looks a little bit comical; almost as if he wanted to sell them something. He has quite a ridiculous style, all bright colours that Draco would never wear, but because of them and his wide smile there is not one person who would forget him.
Or, as a matter of fact, Draco Malfoy would, as on the surface of the water he opened a small gate, wearing a soft looking puffy jacket with a white collar and tight, black jeans. He looked weary, as if he just came back from a long day at work, when the doors to the cottage opened…
Harry blinked. He hadn’t thought about it. “I didn’t think about it.”
“I look like what?” Harry raised an eyebrow, leaning towards Draco, making the other man flinch and blink rapidly.
He chewed on the inside of his lips, looking over the garden of Miss Perrywinkle. It has been nearly three weeks since he took the case, three weeks since he discovered that he would be working with none other than Draco Malfoy, and here the two of them were, preparing themselves for a full moon.
“Harry, maybe they are right…”, he muttered.
“What?? Is that you, Malfoy?” She whispered. Her hair was dishevelled and her make up messed up.
The classes were quite uneventful, as always. Zabini set his quill on fire in Transfigurations, how that happened was beyond him. The last time Draco had seen Professor McGonagall this disgruntled was when Harry was chosen as the second Hogwarts Champion.
“Are you trying to ask me to be your boyfriend officially?”, Harry asked.
Deep in thought, he somehow ended up in the seventh floor and eagerly walked up and down the corridor thinking about how much he wanted to go on a proper date with Harry.
“Is that Yule Ball thing as big of a deal in Gryffindor as it is in Slytherin?”
Another girl tried to take his hand, which he quickly pulled away, and begged him even more obnoxiously.
“I wonder why Professor Snape put you in detention, alone, in his office, while he is at dinner.”
They just stood in the water, their arms around each other, for a few minutes. They felt each other’s heartbeat, they smelled each other’s scent mixed with the water’s perfume.
The dark shade of a person appeared where there had only been air before.
“Mr Malfoy, did you not hear my question?” She looked at him like a furious cat ready to jump at his throat.
Fair warning. The writing in this chapter isn't all that great. Sorry. But I was a child when I wrote this six years ago. It get's better, I promise, just power through it!!
Henry’s cooing sounded quite disgruntled when he was awoken, but as a faithful owl he listened when his owner ordered him to deliver the letter to Harry Potter in the morning.
“Thanks, but maybe we should call it a night” Harry couldn’t look Draco in the eye. He needed some time to think before he would be able to platonically dance with him again.
“Yeah, sure, just hang on a moment we’re going to Hogsmeade this weekend, how about we meet up? I know a little pub, usually they don’t let in students, but my father has connections, so I can go there. And you can as well if you’re with me.” This was basically asking Harry out. Hopefully he would just take it as a Hanging Out With A Friend, not in a romantic way.
“No,” said Yaxley sharply. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.”
He wasn’t actually sure whether the beating he heard was his own heart’s or Harry’s but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered, apart from the fact that he never dared to dream being this close to The Boy Who lived.
They would meet in the library this time, in the forbidden section where they should be on their own. Filch had been quite busy keeping the boys from sneaking into the Beauxbatons quarters at night, even though he had heard rumours that Alicia Spinnet had been caught in a cabinet with one of the French students. Draco had made a snarky comment about how foolish love-struck girls act; the hypocrisy of which now hit him in the face like a bludger.
“What? Are you threatening me? Just leave me alone.”
“No! I’m glad that turned out okay and that you are not hurt! Honestly!” The word “disbelief” was written all over Harry’s face. He was tense, constantly on the watch for Crabbe or Goyle chanting some weird and painful spell that would push him face down the toilet. Then Draco would say something smug about Harry winning the “Goblet of Water and leave him there to be found by Peeves or Mrs. Norris.
Then, with a loud groan, Harry stopped thrusting and collapsed onto the bed next to Draco. They laid there next to each other for a few minutes.
“But can’t we cure it? There must be a way, Professor!”
Now all that he had left of his former love was memories, painful, painful memories. They were two fundamentally different people from two fundamentally different backgrounds after all. Maybe it could have all worked out if it wasn’t for his family, and his family’s duty to the Dark Lord.
It was astonishing. A dimly lit love nest, complete with rose petals on the floor and dozens of candles. An inviting sofa, big enough for two if they didn’t mind sitting close together, music was playing from somewhere. Almost exactly what Draco had described to himself seconds ago, only the mousse au chocolat was missing. This was impossible! Hogwarts most definitely didn’t have a cheesy teenage-romance room.
“You were locked away?” Draco didn’t believe his ears.
“We can do this more often, every day if you want!“ Draco was so happy to make Harry happy.
Harry wanted to roll his eyes but was distracted by the command to give it a shot and hover a couple feet in the air and suddenly his pulsed picked up in excitement. Pushing off the grass and imagining himself lifting off the ground…
He also realized everyone was sitting at their very different, neatly
The blond froze at his tone, and Harry glared at him with every ounce of warning he could muster. “I
But it was as he glanced around wildly after the elf, that he realized the shed wall he’d spent the last several days carving through… had been entirely,

they chorused as one.
“Surely you weren’t content with him handling your reputation in Slytherin?” His father chimed in, sounding vaguely amused and Draco instantly scowled.
They were a business family, and while they didn’t make money like the Malfoys did, certainly, not even money could create the kind of information and goods network a true, old-blooded merchant family had built after dozens of generations. Like many ancient and nobles houses, the value of their heirloom artifacts and personal libraries were legitimately priceless in shear wealth, rarity, and information compared to plain gold. After all, you couldn’t buy certain connections, or the knowledge that came with the trade that the Greengrass family was capable of.
In an exhilarating heartbeat that he would’ve enjoyed way more if he wasn’t so panicked, he was by Neville’s side and ducking and weaving as the rouge broom bucked him here and there, Neville’s cry of fear and nausea at the sudden movements breaking his heart.
"We're Weasleys, all we've got is bright red hair!" One laughed.
…and yet Draco wasn’t a political yet, he was eleven bloody years old and Severus knew his godson well enough to know he wasn’t masking fear or anger or a lie to get his way. He was smiling like that because the boy wanted to grin like an idiot and had better control of himself than that. His mask was shielding happiness and warmth, not the things most Slytherins masked.
and then even get a parting shot in last night as they were settling down, making some comment about how it was much comfier than some ‘slimy snake dungeon’. Harry gave exactly zero quaffles about what Ron Weasley said, but he was a bit annoyed to realize his venom was
“Boring, actually. The professor has a stutter and we could barely get a word straight from him. Seems terrified of everything he was going to teach us about."

“I’m fine.”
someone was they way that they were, and more in the business of simply understanding so that they may be used effectively at a later time. You are either manipulating people as pawns, or you yourself were the pawn, after all. So while they didn’t know the details, that Harry Potter had a background more similar of that to a Slytherin than their own son had actually been a mild comfort for the past year—they could at least understand that about the intrusive dragon in their plans, and move to counter accordingly on ground they were more than familiar with.
“Have you ever rubbed your eyes after cutting up some peppers? I did once, and I regretted it.” The man got very somber as if this was a traumatic experience for him. It probably was, if he went as far to include it into his product line.

“Of course dear, if you’d be up to hearing it I can explain what I did if you’d like.” She had him in here enough over the year due to quidditch, pranks, headaches from Defense, and of course the troll to be more than familiar with his curiosity and despite not understanding the magic or medicine behind it he liked to know

She was super big into Transfiguration and I’ve read dozens of her journals already and she’s maybe my favorite adopted ancestor ever. I
Draco was staring at him with the most horrified look he’d ever seen on someone, clearly not caring at all to check his expression for once.
“Yeah, she’s female Norwegian Ridgeback. Only a couple weeks, right? So cute!” He cooed at he peeked through the slats in Norbert—
“Well that’s good.” Still, this was a really suspicious conversation to be having. “Is there a reason in particular you’re telling me this though?”

“Ah… thank you sir.” He shifted a bit in his chair. “I thought it… relevant.”

One glass of scotch was not enough for a night like tonight.
"I can go over the basics at lunch, but the core point is that you can't touch it with your hands--only the goalie can to stop the ball from getting into your team's net. For everyone else you just have to kick it with your feet which requires some ball handling skill which we're gonna practice. How about this to start," he dropped the ball he was holding and kicked it gently to Harry who kicked it gently back. "See the part of the foot we're using to kick it? Let's try passing it back and forth between each other."
"Potter-Monroe, Harry."

Slytherin wasn't like the other houses in that each room was optimized to give them space, security, and studying room. Each room only held three, with a small entrance room to leave one's shoes connecting to a bathroom, and then another door into the main dorm that was a horseshoe shape: one bed area in front of the door, and one each to the left and right. Each area was an alcove of sorts, a large semi-circle with a wardrobe, bookshelf, and full desk area towards the front, and yet another alcove at the back that could be blocked off with black curtains where the bed was placed. The main perk being that the whole of Slytherin was underground, boarding the lake, so each bed had a large circular window twice Draco's height that showed out into the underwater lake—magically enchanted to be light enough to see the seaweed sway in the currents and fish swim by occasionally. The upper years said sometimes the squid would drift by, but it didn't often like to come too close to the castle.

He also took to washing his face more  and carefully stealing sunscreen from the medicine cabinet and hiding it outside beneath bushes or even underground, in preparation of days Petunia forced him outside to do yardwork all day. He also took to carefully gluing his glasses back together rather than roughly with tape, and even managing to paint the rims with some dark green paint he'd nicked from art class—it was small and subtle enough that the Dursley's didn't notice it or ever bring it up if they did, not that they'd care much, but it was a small form of rebellion with his appearance that Harry was very proud to have gotten away with.

"That's a bad thing?" He feigned obliviousness, though thanks to Daphne he was already well aware what the wizarding world thought about werewolves. What he was really after was the two people behind him thought, so he “innocently” turned from Axeclaw, to Draco who almost didn’t even meet his eyes, and then back at Mrs. Malfoy in particular.

“Come now Norbert, don’t do tha’,” Hagrid was yet again distracted by the baby dragon attempting to claw at the wooden table below it—baby claws immediately leaving huge divots on the wood with ease.
In any case, it suddenly this went from being something they were simply aware of, to a potential threat to Draco they would need to address before it got any worse. They boy had Slytherin-like qualities, but clearly he
“That would be good.” She allowed, taken off guard by that but not against it. “Remus has always been… hesitant, about reaching out. And knowing he was watched, and how that could put Harry in danger…” She shook her head rapidly to rid herself of the dark thoughts. “Well, my opinion on the blatant breaking of laws aside, it’s not a bad thing if she’s really willing to do it.”
“So you’ve got a temper

His heart clenched in the darkness—the house long since quiet as the rest of its inhabitants went off to sleep while he lie there thinking troublesome thoughts.

like that. Why she actually talked back to her husband
“None of your business.” Draco lifted his chin in the air, and if Harry was taken off guard by being so blatantly kept in the dark, it was overshadowed by how impressed he was at how far his baby cactus had come. He admitted their friendship so far had been rather skewed in his favor, and at this point Harry just admitted to the fact he was a bit of a bully. Being told to essentially get lost when clearly he was being used for some kind of snake-like ploy was actually kind of refreshing in an odd way.

Draco looked like he’d just swallowed something nasty but then gave a dramatic sigh.
Draco ignores the email. Honestly, there’s nothing more he can do right now; the invoices are piling up, the website of the Mexican bank just doesn’t want to cooperate and Draco really doesn’t want to spend another long afternoon in the office. He just can’t sit in the office until seven — again — just because of a bank; not him, not his superior, not his manager, not a colleague from Accounts Receivable, but a bank’s website isn’t allowing him to make a transfer of one bloody hundred dollars. This madness needs to end, and soon, otherwise he will be out of his wits.

The world was clearly mocking him. Mocking him to the point of… he didn’t know to the point of
. There were strawberries coated in honey, blueberries big as sickle, various other fruits with chocolate still spilling from them to the bottom of the cups and Harry had an image of him, taking some of it on the tip of his finger and licking it.
“Have a nice day,” he says, his green eyes crinkling at the corners. Surprisingly, his voice is deep and normally Draco would make a double take, but he is already looking at the man. He could be younger than Draco but by the look of the curly hair that is too long for Draco’s taste he could be in his early thirties. The puffy jacket makes the man’s brown skin a little bit glowier but it is a nice touch to the slouchy dark jeans and white converse. Draco nods in response as the doors hiss and open to show the same corridor that leads to his office, but instead of a giant, metal 5 there’s a 4 in his line of sight.
There were, of course, people with whom silence was nice. Desirable, even. Hermione was one of those people and Harry liked to visit her and Ron’s house and sit by the dining table while she worked and read and scribbled; it was relaxing to have her there, at hand’s reach, and yet not.
He turned without Draco’s hand leaving his mouth, which was good, because it stifled a surprised gasp he was about to make when he saw the light that slowly emerged from the mausoleum.
You're doing great Draco, sweetie!
“You saw them?”
Draco clicks on his Team icon and writes ‘Harry Potter’ in the upper bar. There is a photoless profile of an IT Consultant, who is currently available for chat. He even clicks on the message bar, fingers hovering above the keyboard, but after a few seconds he click on somebody else with whom he chatted recently -- Padma, with the last message from her being two otters sleeping in each others furry paws -- and tries to forget about the lushy, curly hair or the green eyes.
“Stop,” said Draco quietly to his ear, and holy shit, it did
He closed his eyes, feeling them burn with the oncoming tears. It wasn’t supposed to be like that; he was to defeat the Dark Lord and live happily ever after with the love of his life, but in the meantime it seemed that both him and the woman he loved grew up and apart in the process. And he
They sat on the creature’s — their Host, as they introduced themselves, to which Draco nodded and Harry mimicked the gesture — left, next to each other, hands still clasped. The moment they were seated the plates in front of them filled instantly with food; he could taste on the tip of his tongue that the slice of bread was fresh and with the salted butter it would taste
, however, it was at least three times as big. It wasn’t the house that the feary showed the, but there were similarities; there was a dark green fence around the house, most of it overgrown by roses and the house itself was hiding in ivy that winded up to the second floor of the charming cottage. The moment they stepped through the squeaky gate the front door opened and Narcisia Mafloy, wearing what looked to be a sort of sleeping gown ending just below her knees that was more expensive than anything that Harry own with a robe that one cleary wore when they got the sad news about their husbands dying suddenly in a tragic accident the colours of rough sea.
“Oh, that I am. Also, I might be unemployed, out of my own violation, but I’ll tell you everything on Friday, yeah?”
But… he can’t.
“It’s...complicated,” he said at last, not looking at Harry, who stepped closer, intrigued by the chalk drawings.
We love you for who you are.
Before he completely surrenders to misery he thinks that he deserves a treat. After all, he worked hard: everything was paid on time and the most important cases were taken care of. So why the hell not? He thinks and instead of going forward, turns right into a small and unassuming alley, where the best bakery has magically appeared almost a year ago, with the most delicious baked goods Draco has ever tasted. It’s a small treat, four donuts and a coffee to go, but he knows he will cherish those four donuts today and tomorrow. Especially tomorrow, god they will taste so good with his morning tea. Morning routine is always sweeter when instead of a bowl of granola with plain yogurt you eat a donut filled with mango and passion fruit.
He was twenty-one when he realised that this was it.
“Maybe the other guest will be more willing?” The creature might have snapped it’s fingers as if the world suddenly moved and all senses in Harry’s mind were focused on one thing and one thing only.
; the hands of the clock were gold and he saw that its face was glittering with stars. “Eleven hours. And I still need to change into something more formal.”
Hermine laughed at that and patted Harry’s hair. “As you said, you’re still alive.”
Then there was the house. Located on the outskirts of London, placed under similar spells as Grimmauld Place, it was a two storey building with an attic, a single tower to which Miss Perrywinkle lost the key to, a basement and apparently a ghost problem.
“Yes, ugh, fine, Friday.”
want journalists sniffing outside? Potter I had to
Harry nodded. “Sounds like it. Any objections? You’re the fairy specialist here.” He felt Drco shuffle from one leg to the other.
The moment the light touched the circle they moved as one, sprinting from the bush, the first spell realised from Draco’s wand like a lightning, followed by the low rumble of earth when it hit the fairy who fell on the ground like a ton of brick, hard and at once, to Harry’s surprise. The spell he was holding buzzed under his fingertips but he would rather wait for Draco to tell him what to do, as he was the specialist in this situation. They stopped, boh breathing hard, a few steps away from the still alight shape, which Harry started to see under the moonlight.
“As you said I am The Boy Who Lived and frankly I don’t give a fuck. No fucks given, Draco. So, Friday?”
Harry swallowed; Draco cautiously removed his hand from his mouth and gave him a stern look.
Until he heard the noise.
Oh, Sam. He missed him, even though it’s been almost two years now.
Three stones were left and Harry more felt than saw a shift by his side which told me that Draco was getting ready. As if in response adrenaline started pumping blood in his system, the heartbeat so loud he could heat it in his ears, the
What sorcery is this?
“Oh Draco, how I love your humour! No, the deadline is for this year.”
spell and pocketed the wand. “Let’s just get on with it.”
The surface of his golden bowl in front of him showed him his own face and when it rippled and started to sway, creating a miniature tornado inside the water, Harry was transfixed, hypnotised by they sway of waves; he wanted to move with them but he felt rooted to the chair like and old tree is rooted to the ground through hundred of years.
When he walked out to see that Ron was already there, frowing deeply at the clothes Hermione laid on his duvet cover for Harry to choose.
“My therapist said that this is going to take years to unlearn. Years I still have!’ The last sentence was said on a more cheerful note and Harry waited for Draco to mock him, laugh at him for seeking help; he was ready for it. But Draco straightened, looked at Harry and gave him an acknowledging smile.
What do you mean?
But they didn’t move. For what stretched of a century they stood there, Harry’s back pressed to Draco’s chest, his breath softer and softer, his hand still on Harry’s arm.
But the man opposite him starts to laugh as if he heard the best joke ever.

Allright. If you want to see how things go between you and him, just tell him. Don’t raise his hopes up: state the facts. The more communication you get at an early stage the more clear things will become between you two. Maybe he is also all for option three, with moving to option two, in due time and with your consent.
As he crossed the threshold a shiver ran through his back and Harry gritted his teeth holding the wand tighter. The steps were steep and slippery, his footsteps were echoing in the corridor making it seem as if there were more people walking down into the earth. Miss Perrywinkle told him that the curse breaker was already there, working diligently for about two weeks. “You see,” she said, picking up one of the four cats and putting it on her laps without missing a beat. “I think that all the noise and the fuss is because of the ghost in the cemetery. Five generations of Perrywinkles were buried there, in a bloody mausoleum, and I am sure that it’s one of their ghosts that is making everything go bonkers around here. I already hired the best curse worker there was, but the situation has gotten dire. Please, Mister Putter, please help,” and for the love of God, how could he say no?
Blaise and Pansy are his closest friends: Draco does not know what he would do without them. And even though he met Potter two times, and the first time he didn’t even know his name, he still gets the giddy feeling that Draco doesn’t want to lose. The invisible pull that he feels towards Harry could be nothing but… he doesn’t want it to just be nothing.
There were wings, small and delicate, like butterflies, but colorless and almost translucent. The person, because it was a person, was small, no bigger than Harry’s hand including his fingers, lying on the floor, supporting themselves on bent arms, trying to slowly stand up. When they got closer the creatures head snapped up and Harry saw big eyes that sparkled as if a current of electricity was coming through them or fireworks were exploding inside them in a slight slow motion. It’s head was bigger than the body, pointy ears long and very thin, chin looked as if it could break through the skin and draw blood. It looked gentle, doll like almost.
“So, back to our surnames then, Malfoy?”
or do you want to go for a dinner with him and chat and see how do you feel about him?
There was only one person whom he told the truth about himself. He was a nice bloke, tall and quite handsome and took good to the “I’m a wizard” thing. They just sort of fizzled out and he had to modify his memory in the end. He cried after that for three days straight.
With a single minded intent Harry stormed through the clearing, throwing his coat near the bank. He kneeled then, the soft ground seeping through the material on his knees. He leaned in, trying out the water with his fingers: it was pleasantly cool and without thinking he dipped his hands and made a bowl-like shape out of them to drink it.
Then, as suddenly as it started, the water stopped. Harry blinked and blinked again when the blackness started to spread from the middle, like a drop of ink colouring the whole bowl black. The roots that were holding him seemed to tighten around his chest, squeezing his ribs
Harry and Draco go through a magic door in a wall, following a fae, and they don't think.
Harry shrugged, not really caring that Draco calls Hermonie
“What my fellow traveler is trying to say is that the water will be enough for now.” Draco bowed his head and the creature did the same, its eyes still on Harry.
Get a job in finances, they say, it’s stable and the working hours are manageable, they say. But they don’t add that you will be working for nine, ten hours because there’s staff shortage, because according to your supervisor there’s nobody as competent as Draco for the additional position, because the person they hired two weeks ago is still learning and can’t stay after hours because they can’t do much yet.
“Malfoy,” Harry also nodded because that was the customary greeting between old childhood nemesis, was it not?
Harry blinked at that, nodding. Then he realised that Draco couldn’t see him so he just said “Ok,” to which Draco opened his one eye, then second, and sat up.
