With that Harry agrees, hangs up the phone, and closes his eyes. He loves and appreciates Ron and Hermione, and he knows they’re only hovering because they’re worried about him, but he wishes that people would stop treating him like he is either going to break, or suddenly become the next Minister of Magic.
Mcgonagall nods before standing up. Malfoy follows suit and Harry scrambles to do the same.
As they sit down, Teddy struggles slightly so Draco lowers him to the ground where he can crawl around. Harry watches Draco watch Teddy, but is interrupted by Percy shoving his hand in his direction.
“Hi.” Harry says back, amused by the weirdness of Malfoy, “Sleep well?”
Draco snorts but says, “I suppose you’re right about that, Potter.”
“Why are you living in this flat? I never pictured you as a muggle London type.”
Harry shrugs. “We’re in muggle London, no one we know is gonna see us here.”
And that concludes the fic! Thanks for sticking with it until the end. Brek and I hope to write more stories about Draco's and Harry's journey, but we'll be taking a break for now. Thank you for reading, we appreciate y'all so much<3
“I think you have to break up with him.”
“But I want you around.” Harry says, hearing an edge of desperation enter into his voice. He does his best to quash it before repeating, “I want you around, Draco. I always want you around.”
Luckily, after what seemed like an eternity Ron picks up.
“Alright,” Harry says, “I’ll see you in a few.”
“I’m not sure Professor.” he says finally. “He just gets it, he doesn’t hold me on a pedestal or treat me like glass. It’s a nice change.”
Afternoon comes sooner than Harry is expecting and he and Draco apparate over to Andromeda’s, hopeful after last night when Teddy didn’t kick up a fuss.
Harry leans back in the chair he’s sitting in, “What about me and Malfoy, Hermione?”
Harry smiles back before turning back to the grate, dropping the floo powder and shouting Malfoy’s address.
It’s December 31st and Harry is tired of owls tapping at his window.
Harry freezes, and for some reason the impulse to just hang up and shut Hermione out wells up very strongly within him. However, he knows he has to be mature about it, so he answers in the simplest was possible.
Luna just nods and says, “Anytime Draco. Anyways, I have another client coming in, so I have to go. But I’ll see you next weekend Harry, and I hope to see you again soon Draco.”
Her message is short, wishing both he and Draco a happy holidays while letting him know that her father would be willing to send a reporter to Starbucks to chat with him and Draco.
“Potter, what makes you think that I’m even packed?”
The comment is accompanied by a pillow thrown in his face, and Harry decides it’s time to get up.
“What was that all about Harry?” Hermione asks a they clear the doors and chatter in the hall resumes.
“What are you doing here already?” Harry demands, the outrage ruined somewhat by how tightly he’s holding Draco and the smile on his face.
“That wasn’t him Ron. Lower your wand and we can have a conversation about this like adults.”
He wishes he was the center of someone’s universe.
And Merlin, there it is that cocky grin and raised eyebrow, Malfoy is going to use this nickname any chance he can if it continues to make Harry blush like this.
“Are you feeling better?” Harry asks, brushing a thumb along Draco’s bare side.
Draco shrugs his shoulders, and silently takes a sip of his drink. Harry turns to look at Hermione and Ron, and Hermione holds out a paper.
“How’d it go?”
Draco slowly opens his eyes and sits up, “With who?”
Draco’s twists their hands together but leaves them sitting on his lap.
“Maybe.” Draco says, hating how pathetic he sounds, even though the only person there is Harry. His voice feels awfully tight.
But at the same time, Draco has been Harry’s rock these past few weeks. Smiling at him over a coffee cup at breakfast when he’s had a rough night, playing footsies with him under the table when they are studying for their classes, meaningless baby talk with Teddy this weekend.
His voice sounds thick to his own ears, undoubtedly related to the swollen nose that is gushing blood down his chin and onto his clean robes.
, so he puts on the weather channel and allows himself to zone out to the bland announcer’s voice and the calming music indicating light rain tonight.
Malfoy continues to ignore him but Harry goes on anyways. “I have Christmas gifts for all my other friends that I’ll give them when we see them at the reunion in a couple weeks, but I might need your help.”
Ron looks skeptical so Harry continues.
“What was what all about Hermione?” Harry replies, still wiping the excess blood off of his face.
Harry shakes his head, smiling, before turning to the kitchen. Kreacher had gone back to Hogwarts last night to help out with Christmas dinner, but had promised Harry that he’d left breakfast in the fridge for the two boys.
There’s no answer, so Draco puts his head down and starts focusing on peeling the potatoes. Before long he’s blocking out everything going on around him, so the hand on his shoulder startles him.
“Okay,” Harry says looking up, “I’ll stop calling you Malfoy, but only if you stop calling me Potter.”
*  *  *
Harry smiles stupidly at Malfoy’s retreating figure before shaking his head and making his way to the counter.
Harry notices the use of Potter, but decides not to mention it for now. Instead, he joins Draco in his blanket pile, allowing Draco to pull him down so his head is resting on his chest.
Malfoy’s hand stills for a moment on Harry’s arm before continuing to play with the loose thread.
And with that she walks into the restaurant where Neville is holding the door for her, and what looks like Hannah Abbott and Parvati Patil stand waiting just inside.
“I’m sorry, do we know you?” Harry asks, his words, to his horror, sounding slurred.
Harry feels it warm up and leans forward to kiss Draco gently. They spend a few minutes like that, only stopping when Draco’s foot hits Harry’s present at the end of the couch and they hear a crumpling noise of almost ripping wrapping paper.
“Seriously, I can drop out if it makes you uncomfortable, I’d understand-”
With that decision made they head out. Neither boy knows London particularly well, so they choose streets and shops at random. Happy to be out together and more focused on each other than the task at hand.
“Okay, I guess we’ll meet you in the charms classroom in a few.” Harry says, and hangs up, depositing Malfoy’s bag into his open palm.
“Would you calm down Malfoy it’s just me.”
He fixes Harry with the most withering glare he can muster before standing up.
Harry had nodded, understanding because that’s what he sees whenever he looks in the mirror. He can't help but picture everyone who had died; Remus, Tonks, Mad Eye, Collin. The difference is that Ginny doesn’t have to live with that and Harry does.
Smiling, Harry kisses Malfoy’s neck. “I really like you Malfoy.”
Draco had left about ten minutes ago to get back to Hogwarts for his classes. He’d wanted to stay, but Harry had insisted that class was more important than this. Draco had argued and kicked up a fuss, but had ended up doing as Harry asked when he said "But who’s going to take notes?"
Harry nods to himself and presses forward, making sure Draco stays practically glued to his side.
“You’re staying in here with me tonight right?” Harry asks, leaning against the door frame.
She hands him a sheet and reads it over quickly. It asks questions of insomnia, diet, fatigue, bursts of anger or other strong emotions, nightmares, medication, potions or charms he’s tried, current methods of coping and a few other columns as well.
“What are you doing?” he hisses, lowering himself even more on the table.
Once in the great hall, Harry begins spooning food onto his own plate, and when he notices that Malfoy is just sitting and staring into the distance, he puts some food onto his plate as well.
“One thing at a time, Potter.” Draco mutters, squeezing Harry’s hand once before pulling him into a small tattoo shop.
“I can dress myself you know.” Harry says mildly, leaning back into the covers and watching as Draco stands up and sorts through the closet.
Malfoy scoffs at that and his face seems to reddin more, if possible. He turns to face Harry, they’re almost nose to nose. Harry hadn’t realized how close they’d gotten but makes no move to pull away.
Malfoy answers this time.
When he thinks of Malfoy it doesn’t feel calm or familiar, it feels like he is stepping onto the quidditch pitch for the first time. Loud nerves, adrenaline and enthusiasm, but most of all a wild race in his heart whenever he thinks about it.
She cuts herself short as she sees first Draco standing un-moving in the center of the room, and then Harry kneeling on the ground and struggling to pick up the glass.
As he exits the kitchen he hears Draco snort and say, “I’m always pretty.”
There’s one small thing about what Malfoy just said that makes him feel especially warm, “Harry, huh?”
“Hmm.” Harry says, using his nose to nudge Draco’s head backwards so he can kiss him more easily.
Malfoy had insisted that they get dressed to go pick up the food because he didn’t think the people in Starbucks would take too kindly to seeing two very disheveled boys showing up in clearly slept in clothing. Malfoy didn’t have any clothes with him that weren’t rumpled from sleep as he hadn’t brought an overnight bag when he apparated to Harry’s flat, and because he is an absolute twat that refuses to go out in public in slept in clothing, he had almost refused to come. But then Harry had tossed a pair of his own joggers and a jumper in Malfoy’s direction and with a muttered “fine” he'd gotten dressed.
“Ready to go?” Draco asks, tucking the chain from Harry under his shirt.
Chuckling, Harry saves the number in his phone and decides that he’ll head over to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner. Packing up his things, he phones Ron. For some reason his call goes straight to voicemail. Sighing he phones Hermione and she answers on the first ring.
She looks shocked for all of a second before her face returns neutral and she says, “We’re not together anymore Harry… you don’t owe me an explanation.”
Harry looks over at Teddy who is munching on some of the cereal he hadn’t gotten to beforehand and thinks. As much as he wants Hermione and Ron to see Teddy he kind of wants to spend the weekend with his boy and his boyfriend. It’s when he comes to this realization that he makes a split second decision.
“A big deal has already been made.” Ron says, laughing, “You two were ridiculous, it’s only fair that Hermione and I get to tease you about it now.”
“Oh fuck off.” Harry says, before pressing a messy kiss to the side of Draco’s mouth.
Harry takes a deep breath and looks down at his lap and then over at Ron who nods and squeezes his shoulder again.
Harry frowns. “We should have stayed at Hogwarts for dinner.”
Draco focuses back on the potatoes and lets the steady flow of conversation around him, fade into background noise. When he finishes the potatoes, he stands up and hands them to Mrs. Weasley before turning back to find Harry standing in the doorway talking to George with his hand extended backwards for Draco.
Kreacher nods and disappears to the castle without another word. Caring for crying babies doesn’t seem to be his forte.
Malfoy snorts and rolls his eyes, “Going to seduce the whole school are we, Potter?”
Full stop. He loves Draco Malfoy full stop.
“How sweet of you, I'm utterly charmed.” Malfoy sneers, though his pink ears give away that he isn’t as emotionally detached as he wants to seem.
Ron smiles slightly and rubs the sleep out of his eyes. He looks like he’d gotten off to a slow start this morning too. They walk in comfortable silence, and head to the ministry Auror training center together.
“You’re right mate.” he says simply, throwing his arm around Hermione, “This is shit. I’m sorry it’s happening to you.”
Harry smiles but then realizes that conversation around them has ground to a halt. He tears his gaze away from Draco and everyone else looks away from him before haltingly starting conversation up again.
“I just left bed.” Draco says, voice muffled from being pressed into the mattress.
Harry sits on a nearby stool to fill out his form while Draco carefully takes a seat in the tattoo chair and follows suit.
She looks shocked again and her face is going red in anger, frustration or just from being upset. He looks at her and tries to think of a way to explain why.
They walk in comfortable silence until they reach the quidditch field. Harry hasn’t flown since he pulled Malfoy onto his broom in the room of requirement, and it’s only in this moment that he realizes how much he misses it. The feeling of racing through the air on his Firebolt is incomparable to everything else, and his whole body aches with want to do it just one more time. Glancing at Malfoy, Harry sees that there’s longing on his face too.
“Morning.”
Harry doesn’t see the point in arguing with Draco, especially when he suspects that he’s probably right. But even so he can’t quash the feeling that he should just be going to class. Draco seems to sense this and just squeezes Harry’s hand once before pulling him along.
He takes a breath and looks Malfoy in the eye, “I want everything with you. I want to go on stupid dates with you and I want people to know you’re mine and that I’m yours. I’m not suggesting that we go crazy and tell everyone just yet, but I want my friends and my family to know what you are to me.”
Draco stops short and looks at Harry incredulously, “Because you were on the verge of a breakdown yesterday?”
Interjecting quickly, Harry says, “Professor, I can ask Kreacher to show us to our room, he’s been in the kitchens since I left Grimmauld place so I should probably check in with him anyways.”
“He’s scum Harry,” he repeats. “You used to know that and agree with it, so I’m just wondering what happened to make you change your mind. You hated him for practically seven years, and now suddenly Hermione tells me you two have been having coffee dates or something for over a month? You’re living with the guy now? What the hell is going on, and most importantly, why don’t I know about it?”
“Why Potter, are we taking the room at Hogwarts now? Gonna eat every meal there?”
“I suppose,” Harry says, tilting his head back to kiss the underside of Draco’s jaw, “But do you really think it’s necessary? Anyone can tell from the pictures that I’m in love with you.”
“Ya it’s me,” Harry said, “Where are you?”
“Where are we going?” Harry asks, not really concerned, just curious.
The rocking of the train wakes Harry up. He takes inventory of the still sleeping Teddy on his chest and also Malfoy standing above him.
Without meaning to, he starts thinking about the nightmare again. It was one of his regular ones. Drowning. He hadn’t been afraid of drowning before, but apparently his subconscious has latched onto that particular trauma. His eyes drift to the back of Draco’s head, and the blank stare of the dead Draco from his dreams flits in front of his eyes.
“Maybe another night Hermione. I’m gonna spend some time alone and work on some things.”
Malfoy snorts, “I doubt it Potter. It’s warm and caffeinated and not pumpkin juice.”
Without looking for Harry’s reaction, Draco sticks his head back into the sitting room where everyone is still talking to one another.
Harry grins and waits a few seconds before getting up and going after him.
“Well hello, Harry.” Pavarti says, a slight smile in her voice.
Harry shrugs, not ready to tell Malfoy what happened, and how he’d become panicky at any prospect of falling for him. Malfoy looks at him for another beat before scoffing and shoving Harry away.
Draco shakes his head, “Come on then, I need to catch up.”
Everything and nothing, that’s what they talk about. And Harry wouldn’t want it any other way.
“Potter.” Malfoy’s voice says, sounding like it’s coming from a great distance.
He reaches for Harry’s hand, “I know you carry a lot of regret Harry. And I know me saying you don’t have to won’t make it easier, but I’m hoping this present will be a reminder of all the things you’ve overcome, rather than the things you lost.”
“He’s taken me on as his charity case, and won’t leave me be for a single moment. Basically, he’s decided that I look far too sad enjoying my meal in quiet and need to be surrounded by noise and his adoring fan club at all times.”
“Both?” Harry replies, getting frustrated. “Ron is my best mate, but he’s wrong on this one, and Malfoy doesn’t deserve to pay for the shitty things his family did. By that logic I should be in Azkaban for all the shit the Dursley’s did to me.”
Harry didn’t think he was being particularly silly, but didn’t feel like arguing with Hermione about it.
“That’s what you come up with, Potter?” Malfoy snapped, “That my place is too posh? Your imagination knows no fucking bounds for insults does it?”
At first Harry doesn’t realize it’s his because the only two people he ever phones are sitting in the room with him. His heart lurches thinking it might be Ginny, but when he looks at it the screen reads “Incoming call from Amazing Bouncing Ferret.” Harry laughs silently to himself at the name before answering.
Harry sits with this for another moment, thinking that Malfoy might be just as messed up as him. After all, he has a reputation as well, it just isn't the kind that prompts starry gazes and autographs.
“You’re telling me you got me something better than socks with Christmas lions on them?” Draco says, looking at Harry with a light smile, “I don’t believe you.”
Harry smiles at that, it’s only been a couple of days, but he feels the same way.
Before he can respond, Luna’s eyes flit over Harry’s shoulder and she smiles softly while saying, “Hello Draco, good to see you again!”
*  *  *
As he reaches the door he grabs Harry’s hand and pulls him into a kiss.
Malfoy grunts his consent from the other room and Harry hears him shuffle towards the bedroom with the door clicking shut behind him.
Harry’s heart squeezes a little at that, knowing that it shouldn't matter if he gets something or not, but feeling relieved nonetheless.
He gently pries open the first letter and almost immediately scoffs and throws it on the ground. Five more follow in quick succession. The sixth is a kind letter from a witch out in Kent that he sets to the side for Draco to read, and the last letter is a quick note from Xenophilius Lovegood saying that he would be more than happy to send out one of his reporters if he wanted to make a statement, and if not, he wishes the two boys all the best.
Harry let’s Malfoy list off items he thinks Hermione could have said for almost a comical length of time, but when he hears Draco say, “- or the fact that the broomsticks my father bought in second year weren’t ethically sourced-” he thinks he’s had quite enough.
Malfoy scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Yes because that’s totally your business Potter, and we always share where we are going and who we’re meeting?”
“Thanks Ginny. And it’s okay, I knew it would be hard for you guys to see, I’m just glad you see him now.”
Draco’s mind short circuits when Harry’s eyes dart down to his lips and then back up to his eyes.
“Hey Hermione.”
Malfoy scoffs but takes his phone out and waits patiently for Harry to rattle off his number. With that done Malfoy starts to pack up.
He sinks onto the corner of his bed and fishes out his phone from his pocket. He sees a message from Blaise wishing him luck for tonight, and hovers over it for a moment before opening the other unopened message on his phone.
She says this all in one big breath, he bushy curls tickling his neck, but her hug is comforting nonetheless. Harry takes a moment to finish chewing before answering her. However, before he can open his mouth Malfoy jumps in.
“Seems like your conversation companions think otherwise.” Harry laughs.
Draco gives him a look but nods, “Okay fine. Let me pick out your clothes.”
“I can’t believe you’ve sullied my image like this.” Draco mutters, but he slides off Harry’s lap and pulls the socks on.
Harry starts laughing at the disgusted look on Draco’s face. Laughing even harder as Draco pulls the present fully out of the gift wrap.
“Don’t be stupid.” Draco says immediately, but he follows it up with, “But I am right about this. Let me be with him today Hermione without any of yours and Weasley’s bloody interference.”
Harry supposes that he must have for Hermione to tolerate him, hell even he has started to enjoy meeting him at Starbucks. It’s nice to have someone for company who doesn't look at him with the twinkly eyes of fame, even if that someone normally looks at him with a raised eyebrow and a sneer. Harry mulls this over for a while, Hermione content to let him sit in silence while she works on some recipe from Mrs. Weasley that she’s been aching to try.
Draco swears Harry can hear his heart pounding in his chest.
Malfoy looks at him silently for a moment, and Harry squeezes his hand hopefully. He notices that his hand is sweating.
“I love you.” He says simply, as if those words don’t cost him a thing to say.
When they apparate outside of the Weasley’s house, Draco isn’t sure what he had been expecting. His father had always told him the Weasley’s lived in an old pigsty. In reality, it is simply a house. Definitely a house held up by magic, and not nearly as nice as the manor, but a house nonetheless.
Harry just nods and says, “I’ll think about it.”
The two boys leave the tattoo shop an hour later, with promises of showing their tattoos to one another when they get home. Harry is ridiculously happy. Happy he has a tattoo, happy they’re going to an interview, and most of all happy to be with Draco. Malfoy is wearing his distinctive scowl, but Harry can read the current of happiness running under the surface like a stream.
“What?”
Smiling, he lays back in his bed and thinks about how in just two days time he’ll be in his bed at Hogwarts. With this happy thought in his head he drifts off into sleep, and for the second night that week has no bad dreams.
Harry’s head snaps back, and he clutches his free hand to his nose, but thankfully he remembers that he has a wand and casts a spell before Ron can advance further.
He wishes he could say.
*  *  *
“I mean we can pop over if you guys are at the apartment, we haven’t seen Teddy in ages! He’s probably getting so big.”
“In my defence Hermione, you should have seen him. He looked completely pathetic sitting here by himself. Scowling down at his eggs as if they personally offended him.”
“That’s really smart.”
“That’s true,” Malfoy says, brushing Harry’s hair out of his eyes, “But just think of what all other babies have to live up to now.”
Harry looks back to Hermione again, “Seriously what is this about?” He asks, a hint of desperation entering his voice.
Shit, he might have had more to drink than he thought. Curse Neville and his entire rant on Gillyweed.
Just as he turns to go towards the pickup area she says, “You guys are adorable by the way, wish my relationship was like that.”
It’s warm inside, and the smell of cooking food is wonderful. Draco takes note of who is all in the room. He recognizes Arthur, Ginny, George and Percy, but draws a blank at the two older redheads in the room. Ron and Hermione aren’t there yet and conversation screeches to a halt at the sight of Draco in the doorway.
“Yes, scrambled eggs.” Malfoy says as if whatever he means by this is obvious and Harry is dumb.
“Yes master, but the door is spelled to only open for you and Master Malfoy.”
“Wanna go back to the castle?” Harry asks.
Draco flushes slightly and goes back to looking at his phone, “Of course I have.”
“You deserve one when it’s him.”
Harry smiles and looks back to his plate. Malfoy lets Harry finish his food in silence before dragging him to their next class. Harry is pleased to see that they just have charms and then a spare period between them and the end of the day. Although he really hasn’t done that much, Harry is ready to collapse into his bed.
“You know, the reunion for all the graduated Gryffindors in our year… I suppose it’s also all the Weasleys… and Luna too.”
“I’m not sure,” he says between mouthfuls, “Would I be captain again as I’m the only remaining member? I’ll  have to talk to McGonagall. What about you?”
“Granger. I talked to Mcgonagall already. We’re taking the day off. And if you don’t shove off I’ll whisk Harry away for a week and not tell you where he is. Goodbye.”
It’s incredible that a mere hour ago Draco was minutes away from having a panic attack in the closet at the Weasley’s. Now he’s rolling his eyes and sighing in exasperation as Harry’s hand slips up under his shirt.
“Oi! Malfoy get away from Hermione!”
“Because I said so, Granger.” Draco snaps, barely keeping his voice at whispering level. “He had a really bad day yesterday. We’re taking today off.”
Groaning Harry takes a step away from Draco, “Fine. But I hope you know I’m gonna complain the whole time.”
Malfoy handles it with incredible grace by replying that, “Potter is here because I fucking want him here, and I get what I want. Right now I want you off my pitch. Go.”
“That’s rubbish.” Harry scoffs and then jostles Malfoy’s shoulder with his own, “After all you were supposed to hate me and now I’m like your best friend.”
Harry feels Draco shift at his side, but only opens his eyes when the other boy leans against him, tucking his head into Harry’s neck.
Harry rolls his eyes before saying, “Clearly not, now come on you get to torture some anxious Slytherine’s this morning, won’t that be fun?”
A groan ripples through the table, and Harry gives them all the middle finger while pressing another kiss to Draco’s mouth. Draco laughs and twists their hands together under the table before passing a drink to Harry.
“Potter aren’t you gone yet?”
“Dinner in muggle London? You’re not worried about anyone seeing us this close to Diagon Alley?”
“Really?” Draco asks, taking Harry’s hand, “They’re quite good.”
Putting his wand away he mutters, “I can’t believe we’re walking home in this, I survived the war just to catch pneumonia.”
Harry nods and tries to get comfortable without waking Teddy. Pretty soon his eyes are drifting shut with the warm weight of Teddy on his chest and Malfoy’s head on his shoulder. Before falling asleep completely, he catches Malfoy’s hand reaching up and holding Teddy’s small hand, a small smile playing on his lips.
“Potter, what are you on about? You dropped Binn’s class weeks ago.” Malfoy says skeptically.
Draco smiles softly at Harry and says, “I went to class but it was a spell I already knew so asked if I could be excused.” Breaking eye contact with Harry he looks at Luna, “Hello Lovegood, good to see you too. Thank you for last night.”
“Harry. I’m happy to be with you. But you’ve barely told your friends, the majority of them still don’t know about us. Are you really prepared to have the entire wizarding world writing you demanding you have your head examined, on top of having to explain things to your family and friends? And like you just said, it’s Rita writing it, it won’t be a nice article on young love. It will be an attack on my personality and your sanity.”
“What was that about?” Malfoy asks, jostling Harry with his shoulder as they walk.
“Because he’s the one who convinced me to come back to Hogwarts. I’ve been hanging out with him for close to a month.”
“No, no I wouldn’t have asked you to.” Hermione says, setting Teddy down again when his hair switches to Draco’s pale blonde and he makes grabbing motions and his direction, “It was just odd not having you there with us. Different.”
Taking a deep breath, his heart pounding, Draco opens his mouth and says, “I don’t expect you to like me.”
Harry thanks her and takes a step out the door, looking back at Draco he says, “Ready to go.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes but takes Harry’s hand and lets himself be pulled into the kitchen.
“Lead the way, love.” He finally says, lips ghosting across Draco’s as he says it.
“Alright,” Ron replies rubbing his eyes slightly. Harry notices the huge bags underneath but says nothing, “I haven’t seen you all day today, but somehow I spent hours talking to the ferret there… how’d that happen?”
Harry stays quiet for a moment before saying, “Ginny-”
She rolls her eyes, “I was hoping you’d be the one person who didn’t ask me that.”
Harry cups Malfoy’s face. “She’s wonderful Malfoy, and one of the most forgiving people I know. Besides, I want you to know Teddy. He’s important to me.”
“Ah,” whispers his traitorous mind, “But that doesn’t mean you don’t want to snog him messily in front of everyone, right this second.”
“Mhmm,” Draco says, voice vibrating across Harry’s chest, “Blaise was just asking if I was alright.”
Draco’s hands come up to grip the back of Harry’s elbows, as Harry’s hands are still playing with Draco’s tie.
This gets Mcgonagall’s full attention rather quickly.
“Your ridiculously posh upbringing is showing.” Harry murmurs, looking for literally anything that Teddy can eat.
“Well it’s certainly not good.” She says, stepping back to sit down on the other couch, wordlessly moving a discarded pair of jeans.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and fixes his glare on Harry, “Honestly, who would want to be?”
Tilting his head up to catch his breath, Malfoy starts kissing his neck and Harry wonders how he ever thought he didn’t like Malfoy like this. Harry tilts his head to give Malfoy more room.
Harry feels Draco smile against his neck, and hears him say, “Oh stop being such a big baby, you’re fine.”
It's the only possible explanation for why he agreed to let this thing with Harry continue. Why on earth would he torture himself more than he already has? Just so he can fool around with a boy who isn’t even sure if he likes boys?
Draco grunts in response, not tearing his eyes away from the page, clearly ignoring Harry’s question.
As he leans in to whisper something, his lips close to Draco’s ear and Draco’s hair falling lightly against his face he hears a camera go off. At first Harry doesn't care, intent on talking to Draco and aware that tons of people have been taking pictures together all night. But then a voice punctures the little bubble he and Draco are living in.
Harry shakes his head and picks up his own sandwich, not really in the mood to bother figuring out Malfoy’s complex relationship with eggs. He’d much rather focus on Malfoy’s complex relationship with him.
“We can’t go back to that flat.” Draco mumbles.
Harry jolts somewhat, “You’re went back to Hogwarts?”
As they walk, Hermione fills them in on how her day went. Talking about how many lessons she has planned, and how much marking she has to do already. Malfoy asks about what lessons she is responsible for teaching and makes suggestions on how she could make the lessons more fun or entertaining for the younger students.
Luckily none of the letters appear to be full or curses or howlers like what Hermione had to deal with in fourth year, and he recognizes handwriting from both McGonagall and Hagrid and sets those ones to the side for later.
The wrappings and Christmas tree are quickly forgotten, the two boys kiss messily and gravitate back towards the bed. Though neither one says it, Harry is fairly certain that this is the best Christmas he’s ever had.
“So?” Draco repeats, looking at Harry in confusion, “So, you don’t have to just power through that Harry. You’re allowed a break every once in a while.”
The door cracks open and Mrs. Weasley’s face peers out. It’s more lined than it was before the final battle and she’s lost weight, but when she throws the door open and pulls him in for a hug it feels the exact same.
Harry props himself up on one arm to look get a better look at Malfoy. The moonlight from the open window throws Malfoy’s face into shadow, his pale hair gleaming softly.
“I got the idea from one of those muggle advertisements about the weighted blankets for anxiety. I figured your nightmares are improving a little with Luna’s help, but this can’t hurt.”
Silence again, “Harry it’s not just pictures, it’s like a whole expose on your relationship. And it says a bunch of nasty shit about Malfoy and you.”
The sentence is set up as a question, but Harry knows it’s just kindness and that the man clearly recognized them as soon as he walked in.
Draco looks up at that and Harry is a little shocked by how vulnerable he looks. “It’s going to be dreadful. I’ll be dreadful.”
Draco winces slightly but says, “I know. What should I do?”
Draco shrugs going for, and failing to achieve, nonchalance. “Whatever you say, Potter.”
The silence is broken by Draco.
Harry starts to pull away and Malfoy squeezes his hips and bites lightly on his bottom lip.
Grinning, Harry has to stop himself from leaning in and kissing the other boy. “Never.”
“Next year maybe.” Andromeda says, setting Teddy down so he can crawl around on the mat and play while the grownups talk. “Do you boys want to stay for tea?”
Harry jerks his thumb all over his shoulder, “Gotta ask Binns about the History of Magic homework from last night.”
Draco answers for them both, and Harry allows the conversation to flow around him, content to play with Draco’s hand and think about what he wants to get tattooed.
“Potter, are you not eating?”
“I’m bloody crazy about you Malfoy.” Harry starts, his palms already sweating, “Like a stupid amount. And I thought that maybe it was just a physical thing or whatever. But I don’t think that’s the case.”
This comment catches Harry’s attention and he brings it back to the conversation. Draco is shaking his head no, and before he can ask what she’s talking about, Narcissa sighs and looks out the window.
“Harry you’re bleeding.” Hermione says, rushing to his side.
It’s more often than not that Harry and Malfoy are touching in someway. Oddly enough, Harry has begun to miss the contact when they aren’t.
“So I’m an experiment for you?” Malfoy asks, pulling his hand away and once again having no emotion show on his face.
His mind focuses on mundane things from the past hour, Malfoy’s dilated pupils, swollen lips, cheeks flushed red. Who knew you could slowly fall in love with the way a person smiles?
Each time Harry blinks images of corpses on the floor, and the Dark Lord wandering among whimpering victims appear.
“Not this weekend Ron, Malfoy is here with me and I really just want to have a weekend with him and Teddy.”
Harry kisses Draco’s in response, using his free hand to guide Draco’s mouth down to his,
Harry calls for the end of practice and sends his team to the showers, saying that they’ll discuss his notes next practice.
George joins the conversation at that, still looking sad, but somehow also laughing at the expression on Ron’s face. Harry allows himself to disengage and happily takes Teddy when Fleur passes him over.
“What’s this, Harry?” Draco asks, carefully lifting the necklace out of the box and inspecting the pendant before looking at Harry.
Harry feels is heart squeeze at the emotion in Ron’s voice and he says, “Thanks Ron, I’m glad I told you too.”
The nest of blankets quickly unravel around Malfoy and deposit him not so gently onto the ground. Swearing Malfoy clambers to his feet and lunges towards Harry to grab his blankets back. Harry deftly steps out of the way, and laughs when a bed-headed, confused Malfoy hits his couch face first.
Malfoy’s mouth is very close to his ear when he whispers, “I know for a fact that I’m what you’re thinking about right now.”
Hermione quickly agrees, and they leave the classroom. When they get to the great hall, Harry scans the Slytherin table and feels his heart leap when he doesn’t see Malfoy’s blond hair, dear god what if him and Ron are dueling it out on the lawn?
Harry rolls his eyes, “Seriously? You’re not gonna tell me?”
“I know,” Ron says, shrugging, “I’m right quite a lot of the time actually.”
Immediately, the other boy is looking at him, tracking up and down his body looking for any signs of hurt. Draco grabs Harry’s hand, but Harry is the one who leads him out of the living room and towards a little closet that Draco hadn’t noticed before.
Harry shrugs once before saying, “I have babysitting duty this coming weekend, want to join?”
Harry snarls at Malfoy slightly, but its a weak snarl as he’s almost grateful that Malfoy stopped his train of thought. There’s no use being angry with the dead. Malfoy had dropped his hand from Harry’s arm and moved away slightly to allow Harry to compose himself. After getting his grief and anger fully under control he sidles up right next to Malfoy so that their arms were touching. Harry would never admit it, but the physical touch grounds him a bit too. Malfoy raises and eyebrow in silent question.
“What time is it?” He mumbles, still stretching.
Instead of being in the pond, he’s in the lake. The locket is still twisting around his neck and he can’t tell up from down, but he can see movement below him.
Malfoy snorts and holds out his arm for Harry to grab onto. “Alright, but a boy can only have so many problems Scarhead.”
The two boys hurry along to Harry’s apartment, being careful so as not to slip on the slush filled walkway.
Oh how they’d love to see him fall.
It’s heavier than he expected and he nearly drops it. It’s square shaped and fairly squishy so Harry isn’t sure what it is. He tears off the paper quickly and is looking at an emerald green blanket with a silver snake etched on it.
“You eat eggs at breakfast all the time?”
It’s only after Malfoy stumbles off to his shower and Harry’s mind clears from it’s blissful haze that he realizes that the other boy might be procrastinating.
He had never felt so powerless and pathetic, nor been so grateful for Blaise.
“What are you doing here Rita?” Harry asks, a little pissed that she managed to find him in a sea of sick witches and wizards.
Draco hugs Andromeda and then Teddy before following Harry out of the house.
“You’re unbearable.” Draco mutters before leaning down and kissing Harry senseless.
Malfoy finally turns to face Harry for the first time today, that’s when he notices the twinge of fear in his eyes. It’s not like Malfoy to let himself look so vulnerable, and Harry feels like he’s been given something he can’t quite name.
Harry laughs, “I’m just as shocked as you are, Ron.”
Draco’s eyes had drifted shut at the kisses but shoot open at that and glare at Harry, tension returning full force to his shoulders, “Of course I did. I wanted her to want you there, I wanted her to say she loved me. Not loved me despite of me loving you, but that she loved me full stop.”
“Oh thanks Harry! I hadn’t even realized I’d forgotten it. This is my favourite one, of course it’s fake leather, I’m all about keeping animals out of the fashion industry.” she exclaims softly.
Harry laughs and then stops when he sees they’re about to enter the great hall. Although he knows that the first day back is always hard, he hasn’t really prepared for the onslaught of questions he knows that he’s going to receive. Malfoy glances his way before grabbing his shoulder briefly and heading in. Harry, anxious about being left behind, follows him closely.
“Ron says that you might like it more than you currently like Auror training, and that the training would always be there for you after if you decide to come back to it.”
*****
“No it’s not,” says Harry fiercely. “If anything you have a better chance of winning these people over because they don’t have a build up of hatred to get over.”
“For what?” Harry asks, too far gone to make conclusions himself.
He quickly picks up his drink and sandwich, heading back to Malfoy and completely missing the confused look the barista sends their way.
The word ‘date’ strikes a chord in Harry’s heart, but he doubts Malfoy is using it in the romantic sense. He smacks his hand to his forehead and rubs lightly, wondering how he’d forgotten to adjust the wards to keep Malfoy out. He wonders idly if his brain intentionally made him forget that detail in the hopes that Malfoy might come looking for him.
They both nod and step towards the fire place in the corner of the room. Malfoy goes first, shouting his address before disappearing in a swirl of green flames. Harry makes to follow when he feels a hand on his shoulder.
“How’s it going mate?”
“Happy new years, Potter.”
“I thought we agreed we weren’t going to say anything to the press.” Harry says, placing his hands on Draco’s thighs.
The alcohol makes Draco’s smirk come easier, his laughter louder and puts a nice rosy tint in his cheeks. Harry has no reason to complain.
Harry shrugs and Malfoy shoulders his bag and begins to walk out of the restaurant.
Hours later when a new episode of
“Oh,” Luna says calmly, taking a seat in a chair that Harry is sure wasn’t there before, “We’re just in my office, but I have a charm that enchants the room to appear as wherever the client will feel most comfortable.”
Warmth fills Harry’s chest and he squeezes Malfoy’s hand. Draco just smiles and gestures to one of the desks that has some of Harry’s favourite foods on it.
“Nice mate! We were rooting for you two.”
He can hear the smile in Malfoy’s voice, Malfoy bites his bottom lip and Harry feels his own smile appear.
“You know what Rita, I think I’m good.” Harry says, starting to walk away, “Come on Draco, let’s go.”
The kiss is all consuming, mind numbing, perfection. Harry wishes he could live in this kiss and never leave. A feeling wells up in his chest. Painful and beautiful and strange. He thought he knew this feeling, had Dumbledore tell him his whole life it was his strength, but really it had taken Draco kissing him and being with him for him to figure out how strong this feeling could be.
“I’ll start breakfast.”
He hears her laugh, but doesn’t turn around to see, instead making his way to Draco. He sits down and passes the drink over to Draco who is back to fiddling with his phone.
Mcgonagall smiles thinly before turning her gaze back to Harry.
With difficulty he grits out, “Libraries are where most people do homework Potter, I thought your two brain cells were capable of figuring out where I’d gone without written instructions.”
Excruciatingly, he remembers the way Malfoy pulled away when he’d noticed Harry’s attention.
The darkness didn’t go away, but he was able to learn to work around it and be present for small daily things. Andromeda let him stay for the second half of May and most of June after the war, and in August he started auror training with Ron.
“It’s part of my charm.”
Malfoy opens one eye and manages to fit a whole lot of glaring into it before closing it again and bringing the hand that had been draped over Harry’s side up to detangle Harry’s fingers from his hair and link them with his.
“He’s wrong.” Draco huffs, finally turning to look at Harry. “Where are we going?”
“No Draco. He’s my best friend tell me what’s up with him… or at least let me talk to him myself.”
Draco nods and makes to get up when Harry’s hand is suddenly in front of him offering to pull him up.
“Malfoy,” Harry starts, “I say this with the utmost respect, but what the fuck?”
“Let’s eat.” Hermione says finally, breaking the tension.
Harry leaves him be and heads into his bedroom to get dressed. He throws on a pair of old jeans and with some hesitation one of Draco’s jumpers that had been thrown on the floor the night before when Draco was rooting around for his pajamas. It smells faintly of Draco and Harry tries not to think about how long he’s known what Draco smells like.
Eventually, the reporters stop following them. But it takes a fairly long time, and both Harry’s and Draco’s resolve is nearly shattered with each passing moment. When the final reporter's voice fades, they take a break, leaning against one of the old buildings.
“I don’t need anything from you Draco, your secret is safe with me.”
Harry yelps and jerks away from Draco, but not far enough that Draco doesn’t manage to slip his cold hands under Harry’s shirt and pull him back down to him.
Draco snaps the book that he had been reading shut and shoves it back onto the shelf where it was before saying, “I’m not going to a Gryffindor reunion, Harry.”
Draco nods, and leans forward so their noses are touching, “The absolute best.”
While he moves to stand down at the end of the counter to wait, he casts his gaze towards Draco, who’s pulled his beanie off and is running one hand carelessly through his hair. He’s fiddling with his phone but seems to sense Harry’s gaze on him because he looks up, meeting Harry’s eyes and quirking an eyebrow with a smirk.
Malfoy and Harry continue to meet up at Starbucks for a few weeks. They never mention the fact that they hate each other, nor do they ever actually arrange to see each other, but whenever one of them is at the shop an empty seat tends to be saved for the other at their table.
“It’s because she called me your boyfriend.”
“Luna!” he calls.
As Harry gets up, all eyes turn to him, but he ignores them. He’s getting quite good at ignoring the stares.
“A chat that has to happen without either Ron or Malfoy present?” Harry asks slowly.
“Okay, Potter. Let’s get this over with.”
In the end, Harry is glad they came here. The food is delicious, and no one seems to care that Harry is clearly infatuated with the man sitting across from him. Their hands are clasped together on the table in plain sight, and still, no one says anything.
He never used to understand how Harry had been friends with Loony, loopy Lovegood, but he’s beginning to get it now.
“Ya it’s bad Potter, but the teachers respect the fact that I’ve come back and most if not all know that I’m no longer living in my family's home. Hogwarts was a lot of bad for me, but it’s also the only chance I’ve ever had at a life not painted with my family’s mistakes. I can’t succeed in the world as I am now, my only chance is getting good references and a proper education.”
Harry stands looking at Malfoy with his mouth hanging open.
“What?” Harry asks.
With that Malfoy rolls over in his blanket nest so that he is facing away from Harry. Frowning Harry moves to the other side of the room and then with an evil smile summons Malfoy’s blankets to him.
“First off, they’re not dates,” As Harry says this he can feel his cheeks colouring but pushes onward, “He’s my friend Ron. And honestly I’m not quite sure when that happened either.”
“Nope,” Harry says popping the p aggressively, “I’m bored and you’re easy to irritate.”
“And who says I won’t?” Malfoy asks, looking around the apartment for some sort of book or toy, “I’ll be the fun uncle who appears randomly and showers him in attention and toys.”
But Draco is the worst of all. He has everything he could possibly want, and the only thing that seems to bring him actual joy is teasing Harry and warm sugary drinks from Starbucks. So Harry is stumped.
“Potter it’s Granger.” Malfoy snaps, waving Hermione over with smile that Harry never thought would be directed at Hermione of all people.
“Well imagine,” Harry says, pausing to think out exactly what he wants to say, “Imagine that every single moment of every single day, every single person treated you like how Hermione treats you after a bad nightmare. Sure the sentiment is nice, but it’s draining. You can't convince them that you’re okay, and after a while you begin to wonder if you really are.”
“Understatement of the year.” Harry mumbles, tipping his head back against the brick and closing his eyes and releasing a tired breath.
“Did Hermione talk to you?”
“Yep, and you’re Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy?”
Draco rolls his eyes and mutters, “And you say you don’t need a mental health day.” Before saying more clearly, “The shops are probably open by now, right?”
Harry tries to tune her out, but Draco’s hand is sweating in his and he really hates being talked about.
“Well Andromeda needed a break for the weekend, so Draco and I thought we’d take the weekend off and spend it with Teddy.”
Not a whole lot of it makes sense to Harry. He supposes he doesn’t have the mind for poetry, but it’s peaceful so he reads on. One poem catches his eye so he skims it idly. The Waste Land
This leads to them a few hours later standing outside a chip truck waiting on some chips for him and Draco as he fishes out his emergency stash of cheerios for Teddy to eat before they head home.
“Mhmm. But I refuse to call this atrocious apartment home.”
“I can disable the charm for now if you want Harry. Or you can tell me where we are and we can go from there.”
“I’m the Chosen One, I can do whatever I want.” Harry says, joking, but only partially.
He hangs up not long after that and looks at Harry who's watching him with a raised brow.
Malfoy’s eyes dart nervously to Harry’s and Harry finds himself stepping closer to him.
Harry scoffs, “Sure Draco.” And stands up with the pile of clothes Draco gave him in his hands. “You don’t look any better than usual.”
Harry turns to see a gobsmacked Mcgonagall looking at the three of them. It appears that the commotion at the front of the room had been a student running to get Mcgonagall. He shrugs in response. Hermione makes a sound in the back of her throat that has Harry and Mcgonagall turning to look at her. She’s crying and looking at Harry and Ron in shock. Harry decides to try another answer.
After the paper is torn off a nondescript black box slips out. Draco casts a confused look at Harry before lifting the lid and revealing two identical gold chains with a circular flat pendant with a snitch etched onto them.
Draco doesn’t say anything. Harry slips his cold hand under the hem of Draco’s sweater and presses it against bare skin for a response.
He has absolutely no idea how his life got to this point. He had been quite happy living an outcast’s life in muggle London with no contact beside the occasional nagging conversation with Granger.
“Sod off or I’ll spell you silent!”
This seems to sway Draco a little.
Hermione stares at him for a moment, her hand still raised mid gesture, and Harry feels himself flush red. He looks down but not before seeing her mouth slowly transform into a grin.
“Hey Harry, it’s Ron.”
Draco’s heart plummets towards his stomach. Wearing this sweater was a bad idea, it’s going to look like he’s shoving his relationship with Harry in everyone’s face. He needs to talk to Harry.
He feels Malfoy’s eyes on him, and when he turns to look at the other boy Malfoy gives a funny twitch of the mouth that could be his attempt at a comforting smile. Harry nods slightly, and they begin making their way past Hagrid’s darkened hut towards the brightly lit doors of the school.
Surely, Draco thought sadly, he had not done anything that bad to deserve being tortured by Harry Potter for the rest of his life? I mean sure, there had been the whole death eater thing, but desperate times call for desperate measures! Couldn’t they boil that all down to teenage angst? Was seven years of pining not enough? Was seeing Harry in ridiculous heterosexual relationships not enough? Merlin, had Draco not paid the price for his stupidity?
“I just wanted to tell you that I made the Holyhead Harpies. They sent out an offer last week.”
Harry rolls Malfoy off of him and stands up from his bed, “I’ll do you one better.” he sticks out his hand.
“I know you don’t like him, and I’m not asking you too, I’m just asking you to tolerate him. He isn’t going to hurt Hermione. Honestly, I’m not sure if he's ever going to hurt anyone, I think Malfoy just wants to get through this year with his head down.”
When he hangs up, he throws his phone onto one of the couches, and tucks himself into Harry’s side.
Without a word the elf had apparated away and about ten minutes later returned with Andromeda and Teddy in tow. Teddy was crying after the apparation, but Kreacher calmly took him in his arms and into the kitchen, leaving Andromeda with Harry.
“As far as I know he just had normal training today and was coming straight home. He probably just has his phone in his bag, or it isn’t working in the ministry. You know it normally doesn’t.”
“Come on Malfoy, get up. We need to see how Hermione is doing after yesterday.”
“Besides, they don’t even know I’m with you so if they were to show up anywhere it would be to my flat and I’m not there so the wards would keep them out anyways.”
“We’re grand actually! Neville had the night off from his apprenticeship and thought we could spend it catching up, shopping for his girls birthday and grabbing dinner with a couple of other people from school. What are you and Draco up to?”
“That your friends came over to comfort us and you were in your bloody boxers.”
Once again, Harry turns to look at Mcgonagall who is smiling at them both.
“Could you not?” Malfoy shoots back, crowding into Harry’s space, “Didn’t you grow up in a broom cupboard? Shouldn’t you know your way around it?”
It’s nice to be with everyone, Harry thinks privately, Draco tucked into his side at this point but gesturing aggressively at Ron and Ginny as they argue about different plays. He isn’t sure why the group is suddenly okay with Draco, but he thinks it might have to do about the boy missing from their ranks.
Hermione has turned back to the bubbling pot on the stove. Harry decides he doesn’t want to talk about this anymore and has just opened his mouth to ask her about her lessons when Ron apparates into the kitchen. He looks stressed and upset.
And so they go. Harry worries about the press, but Draco reminds him that no one knows where Draco’s flat is so there’s no reason for anyone to be able to find them so quickly.
Harry can feel himself blushing but doesn’t say anything. However, as Draco tugs on his hand and pulls him into Madame Rosemerta’s he does notice the adorable pet name that rolls off his tongue.
“How are you going to be getting to Hogwarts each day?”
“Come on,” Harry says finally, “Get up, let’s get you to bed.”
“Essentially, that she wasn’t surprised, she just wished that I had picked someone that wasn’t you.”
“For now, I don’t think you need to do anything.” Hermione says, Ron nods in agreement. “You’ll just have to expect a ton of mail from angry witches and wizards.”
Draco shoots and unimpressed look over his bare shoulder, but stumbles into the bathroom without another word.
“What are you talking about?”
Breakfast doesn't present much of an opportunity for conversation either as Malfoy shovels forkfuls of scrambled egg into his mouth at an astonishing rate and edits a potions paper due that morning with the other hand.
Happy Holidays everyone! Your guys' comments and kudos mean the world to us and we hope you loved this chapter <3
Harry grins, and before he can stop himself leans in and kisses Malfoy on the cheek.
“Like what?” Harry asks, continuing to look at Draco in much the same way.
Harry lets those words float around in his head for a bit before shaking them off and saying, “Tell me about Hogwarts.”
“Potions, Potter. Essay is due in two days.”
Harry doesn’t fall asleep again, but he dozes slightly, keeping his arms around Draco the whole time. He only gets out of bed when he hears Teddy stirring from the other room. It isn’t time for Teddy to wake up yet, but Harry is tired and still drained from the nightmare, so he goes to the living room to cuddle with him anyways.
“Mr. Weasley?”
Malfoy sneers a little at that. “Seriously? The boy who defeated the dark lord is saying school might be too hard? Let me alert the media as to how retirement is softening their hero.”
Out of the corner of his eye Harry sees Draco’s shoulders drop, all tension suddenly gone.
Harry Potter can finally breathe.
Sighing he closes the fridge and adds, “I searched the whole castle, Hogsmeade, then my place, Starbucks and then I came here on the off chance you came back to this dump.”
Harry doesn't get the chance to really talk to Malfoy the next morning.
“It certainly seems that way doesn’t it.” Harry says, gently lowering Teddy to the floor so that he can crawl around while he looks for his bath things from the summer.
Without looking to see Malfoy’s reaction, Harry exits the great hall and follows Ron into an abandoned classroom. Hermione is already in there and stands when Harry and Ron walk in, anxiously smoothing down the front of her robes.
He starts to make a list in his head of the pros and cons of allowing this thing with Harry to go any farther than it has.
As they slip under the covers and Harry pulls Dracp towards him, throwing an arm over his middle, Draco mumbles, “We are buying you a new mattress tomorrow.”
Malfoy continues blabbering on and Harry notices out of the corner of his eye that Malfoy has floo dust tangled in his fine blonde locks.
that is apparently famous for their fancy quills. Draco comes alive in the book store, it’s no wonder. If the piles of books scattered around his flat are any indication, Malfoy is a total geek.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and wanders off to the side to pick up his order, and then heads to their normal table at the back of the shop. Still grinning, Harry turns back to the barista and places his order.
“I’m denying it completely.” Draco says, gently pushing Harry with his shoulder to lay against the one arm of the couch and then lying down himself with his back pressed into Harry’s chest, “The only good things in this flat are you and Teddy.”
“I’m so glad to meet you sweetheart.”
“Harry, how are you? Ron says you left the Ministry early today?”
“Shit,” Harry says, his hand groping for Draco’s under the blanket, “That’s all they have though right? Pictures?”
“Are you having a good time?” Draco whispers into Harry’s ear, words only slurring slightly.
“Nothing, Potter. Don’t worry about it.”
Harry Potter<10:30 am
Harry nods and allows Malfoy to pull him up, holding onto his hand for much longer than necessary.
After this is done, supper is eaten, and the dishes are clean, he finds Malfoy sitting in the living room. He flops down next to him, laying his head on his shoulder.
But when Harry had looked at him with those big stupid eyes in that stupid Starbucks he was stupidly done for. And honestly, he would take whatever Harry was willing to give. He had tasted his lips once, and now doesn’t know if he could go without.
This does not satisfy Hermione’s curiosity. If anything it provokes it. Her voice has a laughing edge to it as she says, “And why was he with you Harry?”
He has another week before Christmas though, and tonight he and Draco are going home to Draco’s flat where they’ve agreed to spend the holidays together. Harry had suggested his place, but Draco flat out refused, saying that he was not spending what little time off he had sleeping on the world's most uncomfortable bed.
He’s breathing heavily by the end of this and seems to think that’s the end of the argument when Hermione calmly says, “I appreciate that you are concerned about my safety, but Draco and I have been working together all term-”
One thought is running through Harry’s head though, and that thought is, “Shit, shit, shit.”
Self consciously Harry raises his hand to his face. “I thought I had got it all off.” He mumbles, not looking at Malfoy.
He brushes past Malfoy and picks Teddy out of his chair. When he turns to look at Malfoy again, he’s in the spot Harry left him with a pout on his face.
Draco looks at him desperately for a moment, before kissing him. Harry allows the kiss to last for a few minutes before breaking it and leaning their foreheads together.
Draco shrugs, “Not happy about it, but not upset either. I think she was more surprised than anything. And she told me she’d give us a heads up if anything crosses her desk.”
Harry turns the page over looking for more and finding it blank. Draco is still asleep, so Harry goes to the kitchen to make something to eat. He tries his best to quietly make pancakes without waking Draco, but soon enough the other boy is standing in the doorway.
Harry Potter>11:34 am
“As I’ll ever be.” Draco sighs, adjusting the beanie and grabbing his aviator sunglasses.
A third text rings through.
Harry Potter is tired of being the chosen one. He’s tired of people watching and analyzing his every move. Tired of having everything just given to him when he’d rather work for it. Tired of reaching for his wand every time someone shouts his name in a crowded street. Tired of the nightmares. Any one of these things is enough to drive a person mad, but when you’re 18 and just trying to get by, the weight of it all is crushing. This is what led to Harry Potter, the chosen one, saying “fuck it” and moving out of Grimmauld place and into a shitty little flat in Muggle London.
Malfoy takes a small step away from Harry’s side and Harry wants to ask why but his neighbour is still trying to talk.
“Come on,” Harry says haltingly, tugging on Malfoy’s sleeve “Breakfast.”
With that Malfoy stalks off in the direction of the bathroom, already tugging his grey t-shirt up his torso, his overlarge socks gently slap the floor with each step. Harry watches him go before the bathroom doors slams shut.
- Has to be secret
“Malfoy you don’t have to-”
Ron had rolled his eyes in the beginning but seems happy enough now to have Harry sit through the boring lectures with him.
As they leave the office, suddenly the regular noises of the hospital reappear. Harry hadn’t noticed they were missing while he was in the room until right this second. As he marvels at the amount of spell work Luna must have done to make the room feel safe for her clients, Luna’s hand wraps around his upper arm, forcing his attention to her.
Chuckling, anger forgotten, Harry grabs the plush grey fabric of Malfoy’s arm, and together they apparate to Hogwarts.
“It was one of my muggle neighbours, they’re saying they need to talk to me about something. I’ll see you later.”
He knows realistically that the reason he’s so tired isn’t because of laying on a stiff mattress all night, or even because of the early Starbucks trip. It’s because he was steamily snogging the chosen one into the wee hours of the morning, and displaying an extreme level of vulnerability. Seriously, who would have guessed that after all the fights and arguments they’d had that he and Harry would get together- even if only for a moment.
“I know.” Harry says, whispering it into Draco’s messy hair.
“I know.” Harry says grinning and laughing slightly.
“Another time Andromeda.” Harry says, casually taking Draco’s hand, “We have plans this afternoon and should probably head out.”
Malfoy himself proves just as distracting as the window situation. First off, he is constantly taking notes and moving. Harry barely lifts his quill in Binns class, but Malfoy never puts his down. His leg shakes relentlessly and he is constantly biting his lip in focus.
“I think we should go out for food and then do some Christmas shopping.”
The abrupt change in subject and presence of Harry calms Draco down enough to focus his attention back on the essay.
All the heads in the room shoot to look at him, and he feels as if he might projectile vomit, but pushes it down and powers forward.
Harry looks back helplessly to Malfoy, who appears to be frozen for a moment before pulling himself up to his full height and smoothing all emotion off of his face.
“What the hell are you doing, Potter?” Draco hisses, shrugging Harry’s hand off his arm.
Hermione sighs at the change in subject but indulges him anyways.
“That’s different.” Malfoy mumbles.
A man in his early twenties is standing in front of them. He’s clearly a wizard who doesn’t often have to dress for Muggle appointments, judging by the way he's decided crocs are appropriate footwear to accompany a suit, so Harry assumes it’s the reporter that Luna sent. Harry stands up and clears his throat, offering his hand to the reporter.
Harry’s hands are freezing, and he fumbles as he locks the broomshed up. Fooling around on the pitch had kept his blood pumping and his body warm, but as the boys landed, the outdoor air had finally gotten to Harry. As he and Malfoy turn towards the castle, Harry takes a deep breath. Preparing himself for what was surely going to be the most difficult part of the day.
Malfoy finally unlocks the door and steps inside. Harry stands for a moment in the hall, wondering how he fucked that situation up so entirely, before Teddy makes a crying sound and Harry follows Malfoy into the flat.
“Teddy agrees with me.” He says smugly, his point seemingly proven when Teddy’s eyes change to match Malfoy’s cold grey ones.
Predictably, Teddy offers no explanation besides babbling and an attempt to eat his own hand.
Harry sighs, knowing he needs to say this but not wanting to. “Draco, if you don’t want to come to the reunion, I won’t love you any less.”
With that she’s gone and Harry is left alone with Malfoy to eat lunch.
The house elf shuffles a short ways down the hall then disappears with a loud snap and Harry is left standing by himself in the corridor. Hesitantly, Harry reaches for the handle to find that it feels completely normal and cool in his hand. He opens the door to find Malfoy lounging on a couch and already looking at him.
Now Draco isn’t an idiot. He knows that that could have been the actions of a half conscious person, but he had wanted so damn much to stay with Harry, so he had. Now that he’s thinking about it, he isn’t even certain he didn’t imagine Harry asking him to move to the bed.
“It was impossible not to know what was going on in Potter’s dating life at Hogwarts. Rumors fly.”
Draco once again wishes that he knew what Harry was thinking, and that he hadn’t been so careless with his heart.
“I get the shower first.” Draco mumbles as he passes by Harry.
Thinking about Starbucks makes him smile. Starbucks is where it all started. All it took was a familiar glare across the cafe and an entirely new relationship had begun. Now, 4 months later they had spent the past night snogging until their lips were sore. Harry can’t believe it took them so long to get their shit together, but then again, he could be quite oblivious. It’s a good thing he’s got friends like Hermione and Ron.
“That was the exact opposite of fine.” Draco says, voice strained from trying to appear unaffected.
“That’s alright,” Harry says grinning now. “I’m pretty much used to your miserableness.”
“I’ll have you know many people would consider it an honour to have lunch with me.” Malfoy fires back and raises his chin in arrogance.
She smiles and holds her arms out. Both boys go towards her and give her a hug. Harry holds on tight, hoping that this is the last time a fight like this breaks out but knowing it likely isn’t.
“Aren’t we?” Harry feigns shock, “But I gave you my number and only my closest friends get that.”
He’s treated to one of Mcgonagall’s real smiles, the one she normally saves for when one of her students masters a tricky charm, or transfigured for the first time, for when she feels proud.
Harry smiles and shrugs, “You’re the boss Malfoy.”
“Okay.” Harry says, bringing Draco’s hand to his mouth to kiss the knuckles.
After History of Magic, they head to lunch and Harry resolutely follows Malfoy to the Slytherin table again. Malfoy does not seem pleased by this at all.
“Have you thought anymore about going to see Luna?”
“So, you and Mr Malfoy are friends now Potter?”
“For doubting you.”
“Harry Potter, I will not be able to save you this year when you ultimately fail your classes for not studying.”
He grabs Malfoy’s hand, and continues. “You’re one of the most important people in my life right now, which sounds absolutely ridiculous, but it’s true.”
Harry rubs the back of his neck absently before answering, “He’s my friend Hermione-”
Harry smiles into his pillow at this, before falling into one of the first peaceful sleeps he’s had in a long time.
Draco shrugs, “More than you think.” He stands up and rifles through the wardrobe, “Here, wear this one with this shirt.”
He turns around and reaches Harry in a few seconds.
Harry laughs, watching as Seamus cheers while Draco downs another drink. “Probably, I don’t think either of them know when to quit.”
“No, no I want to, I’m just on the fence about what to get.”
“And the other seventy percent?” Harry asks, squeezing Malfoy’s hand.
“You have floo dust in your hair.” he mentions, cutting of Malfoy abruptly.
Harry wakes up the next morning to the sound of whispers at the door. At first he wants to jolt out of bed, but when he notes the absence of Draco in the bed he relaxes, knowing it’s probably just him, and keeps his eyes closed, half listening to the conversation at the door and half trying to drift off again.
Draco kisses Harry’s hand and then grabs it with his own to walk into Muggle London.
Harry ignores this and pulls back to look at Malfoy.
How had he let his life get to this point? When had Malfoy become the sun to his solar system, and why was he only just realizing it?
Malfoy stares at Harry like he was a complete idiot. “Yes Potter, I’d have thought Granger would have told you that. We have all our classes together.”
Both Molly and Fleur look over at that, seemingly bristling at his tone, but both back down when they see Harry’s grin. Some tension Draco didn’t realize was there bleeds out of his shoulders.
Even though loving Malfoy would certainly make certain people in the wizarding community hate him, he’s also sure that people will find reasons to hate him regardless. His mind flashes back to fifth year when the whole school and wizarding public decided he was a liar and mad.
Hermione holds his stare for a moment, she appears to be searching for something in Harry that he can’t identify, before shaking her head, “Nothing Harry, I’ll let you figure this one out on your own. I’m gonna go see why Ron was here.”
If Malfoy is going to be the thing that causes the hate, at least he won’t have to go through it all alone. He can almost imagine it, revealing their relationship, the questioning looks that would follow.
Harry looks at Malfoy like he’s an idiot and says, “You are literally one of the most pompously organized blokes I know, you’re definitely packed.”
“Oh, I guarantee that they all think it, they're just too nice to say anything.”
The Gryffindor’s take their cues from Harry and don’t comment on Malfoy’s presence, but Harry is sure to dock points from anyone who sneers or stares too long in Malfoy’s direction.
“Mrs Weasley, this is Draco.”
That’s another thing about being in love with Harry. Now that he’s finally admitted it to himself, he is finding it harder and harder to call him Potter. He already calls him Harry in his mind and is deathly afraid that he’ll say it out loud and all his emotions will be laid bare for Harry to pick up and examine.
“Reunion... what reunion?”
The fact that Malfoy just called his apartment ‘home’ makes butterflies float lazily somewhere near his rib cage. Harry nods his head in approval and the four classmates stand up for hugs.
A strange look crosses Malfoy’s face before he says, “Potter you adjusted them ages ago to let me in.” At Harry’s confused look he continues, “Right around the time we had our third coffee date... you insisted I come over afterwards to give my input on what colour you should paint your kitchen?”
Harry adjusts Teddy’s hat to be sure it’s covering the bright blue hair, and catches Draco looking over the menu at him.
He lets out a tired groan, he rarely has good dreams, so he doesn’t want to open his eyes and forget about it just yet. Malfoy’s hair between his fingers, his lips pressed clumsily to Harry’s collarbone.
Harry follows Draco out of the room without looking back.
They all settle down around the table, Draco remaining silent even as the reporter shakes his hand.
“I reckon that we’ve created a dangerous situation with those two.”
They change into their pajamas quickly and burrow under the covers, Malfoy’s head finding its place on Harry’s chest. Harry’s hand burrows into Malfoy’s hair, and softly plays with the strands. Malfoy presses a kiss to Harry’s chin and closes his eyes.
Draco just offers a curt nod, tightening his grip on Harry’s hand while tucking the chain back under his sweater.
This delights Harry. “How long have you had them?”
Ron looks taken aback for only a moment before his eyes narrow and he sneers at both Harry and Malfoy. “What you’re on his side Harry? He fucking tortured her!”
He eats a quick breakfast alone at his small kitchen bar, nothing like the hustle and bustle of the great hall, then speedily throws on clothes before heading out the front door. There he pauses and murmurs a few security spells that ensure that no one can get into his flat, or even find it’s location, without his say so. Content that they’ll hold until that night, he apparates into the Ministry of Magic.
Harry can feel his mouth hanging open but makes no effort to hide it. Draco smirks and does an obnoxious little twirl. “Looks good right?”
“You get one too Draco. I wouldn’t wear it just yet around Ginny, but you’re a part of this family as long as Harry wants you to be.”
He never should have tried this, never should have tried coming back to school so soon, now he’s in deeper than he thought. His mind catches on the only other place he feels safe. He’s summoning Kreacher and apparating away before he even has time to think of the consequences.
He knows, realistically, that nothing has changed, so he can’t pinpoint why it feels like something monumental has happened.
And if they stay in bed until it’s almost time to leave for the reunion, no one else needs to know.
Chuckling, Harry adds “Actually, he was just as snobby as ever, and rude. And that’s why I’m hanging out with him, because sometimes he’s just what I need.”
* * *
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand once but doesn’t ask for details, knowing that Harry will tell him when he’s ready. And Harry doesn't really want to talk about it anymore, he’s done enough talking and emotions for today. He just wants to eat food and go to sleep and have some semblance of a normal night with his boyfriend.
“What do you mean, Malfoy? I’m just running my practice.”
The sharp crack of his apparation startles a semi conscious Malfoy, which results in him falling off his bed, hopelessly entangled in the blankets and thrashing around for his wand, his socked feet sticking out the end. Harry laughs as Malfoy tries to compose himself.
He hears Draco snort, and then feels his fingers card gently through his hair. “Do you want to go out tonight?”
But in his heart he knows it wouldn’t be like that, he is still in the wake of the final battle. Still wakes up shaking, parseltongue and killing curses echoing in his mind. He still shudders when he walks past the forbidden forest after quidditch practice. Healing will take time.
“What, the actual fuck, are these Potter?”
Harry sighs and presses a kiss to Draco’s knuckles, “You make everything so difficult.”
Still breathing heavily and not willing to move out of Draco’s arms just yet, Harry reaches blindly for his cell phone. When he finds it, he searches through his contacts and hits a relatively new number.
“I should have talked to you earlier when you weren’t drunk.” She mutters before clearing her throat and saying, “About Draco. He clearly loves you, and is good for you, and you know what you’re doing. I should have been kinder about it. But just know, even though he has shit taste in quidditch teams, he’s alright.”
“Wait a second, Harry,” Neville starts, “What are you doing with Malfoy?”
Admitting this is incredibly difficult for Harry but he realizes that it probably isn’t anything Draco doesn’t already know.
Harry laughs, “Alright Malfoy.” And sits down.
“You good?” Draco murmurs in his ear, shifting Teddy to his hip as the crowd around him disperses.
The almost peaceful atmosphere is broken, however, by Ginny’s voice from across the room.
Harry laughs and jogs across the street, getting under the awning just before the rain intensifies. He reaches for Teddy and Draco hands him over willingly, trading the baby for the diaper bag.
Mcgonagall nods once before looking back to Harry.
“Seriously mate, you could have had literally anyone, at least half the girls in our year- and a fair number of guys for that matter- have been dying for a chance with you since you got your acceptance letter.” Neville mutters, seemingly not able to refrain from asking. “So, why him?”
Hermione Granger>10:31am
Harry leans in a little more to quickly kiss Draco on the cheek, but Draco turns his head at the last moment so their lips crash together instead. The moment is broken when a slight cough forces them to both look up.
Neville seems to struggle for a moment but finally nods. “Alright Harry, you’ll have enough explaining to do at the next Gryffindor reunion dinner, you don’t need to explain to me too.”
Harry glances at Draco just in time to see the relief swoop across his face and then go into hiding in the glittering of his eyes.
Before the person has the chance to get the jump on him, Harry throws himself around the corner and shouts, “Petrificus totalus!”
Harry grins and moves to close the gap between them when the music shuts off and Hermione’s voice is projected loudly, calling everyone to attention.
“Wait.” Harry says, grabbing Malfoy’s wrist, “‘What was that about?”
“Why would I have told you? It’s not like you and Draco were great pals at Hogwarts Harry. You were obsessed and constantly convinced he was up to something-”
Harry looks at Malfoy entreatingly, practically begging him to introduce himself. Malfoy seems to get the hint because he takes a small step forward and holds his hand out to  Andromeda.
She waves her wand and a bowl full of potatoes plops down in front of him. He considers using magic but decides he’d rather do it manually and take up more time.
“Just me.” Harry says in his ear, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek as he sits down at his side.
“What did Weasley want?” Draco asks, pulling his beanie off Seamus’s passing head and pulling it down over his own ears.
Draco hums along to the music with his eyes closed, and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen anything so beautiful. He tucks his head into Draco’s neck and allows himself to be pulled even closer.
