“I have only managed to get four tickets” said the tallest girl. “How is it possible that Hanna got 2 more even when she already had 8?!”
Draco hissed. Harry – of course – was laughing his ass off. “You scared me to death, you moron! I thought you had left already.”
There was a light mood between them. Draco felt some tickling in his fingertips. They were so close that, if he moved his arm, he could touch him. He felt nervous and sweaty and happy and every possible emotion in the world. He wanted to touch him
A pretty well-dressed young witch entered, her hair was held up in a neat bun and she was holding a cup of coffee and some papers, one in each hand. She put coffee in front of his blond boss, then she took two steps back and started to recite that day’s pending business.
Draco looked into Potter’s eyes, the same eyes he dreamt at night. And when he saw them, he knew there were no words that would make him stay. As Potter released his hand, Draco felt his own life living his body. Maybe that was the reason why he couldn’t help it. In a single movement, Draco got up and grabbed Potter’s face.
The lift reached his requested floor and doors opened, but Draco didn’t move. Once the doors closed, he selected his office’s floor. Suddenly he didn’t feel like seeing the minister.
Within seconds, Harry was standing right in front of him, smiling awkwardly and taking his hand. Draco didn’t need to ask what he was doing, he didn’t understand a thing, but he didn’t need to understand to comprehend what Harry was asking him. Draco nodded lightly. Harry’s smile was the last thing he some before he felt the characteristic pull on his stomached, and they both disappeared.
Harry jumped off the stage. His cheeks were red and his eyes sparkled. Shining with the determination they showed when he took a challenge. The same that made Draco salivate at night. As Harry walked, the multitude granted him some space, they all suddenly aware of his gaze. After all, that was the man who had won a war. Draco wondered, not for the first time, if he was dreaming.
Draco didn’t mention it was four in the morning. Whoever Harry was owling was most certainly asleep. What would Harry want to say to someone at four AM? And who was he owling to? Feeling a little more than simple curiosity, he gathered his papers. He had a report to finished. And maybe a ticket to get.
Time went by freakingly slowly. He could feel Harry’s gaze upon him, but couldn’t gather the courage to meet his eyes. This whole situation was utterly stupid, there was no reason for him to be edgy, or hurt, or sad, or whatever. It was not like that between them, they didn’t have that type of relationship.
Draco stared at the old witch behind the counter. Her wrinkled face showing both a deep frown and an honest annoyance. She had already asked twice and was no willing to ask a third time. Not kindly, at least.
“Oh, you don’t know him too? He left with November’s cut, he and Draco are going to the ball together. I really need to hurry, guys, see you around.”
Harry evened their faces to look him in the eyes. Plumped wet redden lips, flushed cheeks, expanded pupils. Draco loot at Harry, and knew him he sexiest man on earth. Harry grabbed his hand, and took it to his own crotch. Draco moaned again. Harry’s dick was as hard as his.
Draco laughed again, taking Harry’s face between his hands to kiss him. It was a long night with wet kisses and naughty hands. Shagging senselessly, shouting each other’s name as they came. Draco fell asleep, barely hearing Harry promising homemade bread in the morning.
The blond heard the lift going up at the same moment he found the coffee maker. Now he only needed to figure how to use it.
“She altered the raffle. She transformed all the balls’ labels to have her number. She cheated!” Weasley kept shouting from above the stage.
It had taken him risking his life as a double spy, donating half his family’s properties and six years of hard work in the ministry to be respected inside the magic world. He did have a Dark Mark on the back of his arm, it had been cast there before he realized what he truly wanted, and though he still was ashamed of it -he thought he would always be-, he no longer hated himself for it. He had corrected his path at the last minute.  Almost everyone acknowledged his effort in putting an end to the war, and half of them admired his undeniable beauty. It was his hard-to-pass-through cold personality, and recently his charge in the ministry, that usually kept people away.
They never talked about it. Time managed to dilute the memory so much that sometimes Draco wondered if it really happened. But his heart knew it. He had kissed Harry Potter.
When he was on sixth year, he acknowledged he liked Potter. He liked to see him smile, though at that time the brunet wasn’t smiling so often. He liked to see him flying on his broom and the determination he showed when talking about doing the right thing. He really liked his green eyes and the shape of his mouth. He knew he had a crush on him. At that year’s end, after so many mistakes, Draco knew he couldn’t follow his family wishes, and gathering all the courage the frightened Slytherin could, he talked to Dumbledore. The rest was history.
Richard released something that sounded like a rough laugh that Draco tried to follow. He always had the feeling Richard liked him, he didn’t know exactly why though, giving his records.
He turned to looked around, there were others witches and wizards picking them. They all read the same. 998.
“Did he said what he wanted to see me for?” Amelia was about to respond but got interrupted. “You know what, just let him in.” Draco was not nervous. Of course not!
That morning was his last chance to buy the ticket. That same morning, when he left his apartment, he left without a single galleon.  He had made a choice; he wasn’t buying the ticket. There was no way he could go on stage and get kissed without losing his dignity. There was no way Harry didn’t ask him why he had bought the ticket in the first place. Draco wasn’t ready to be rejected. Maybe someday if the world stopped spinning and he grew a pair or wings; he could tell Harry how he felt. But not yet.
“I- I felt like craving something sweet last night, it was not a big deal. Ah- Anyway I came to ask you something. Last night Ron dropped our report and I was wondering if you happened to see it on your way up to finish yours. So, did you?” Draco felt like a fool. Of course, Harry didn’t go to his office just to give him a treat, what a stupid assumption.
I hope you go. It would be great to meet there, don’t you think?” Harry rubbed the back of his neck in a nervous gesture. God. If he could put his hands in that neck again. His mouth. The things Draco would do to him, if Harry allowed him. If Harry
Draco didn’t understand why he didn’t just make Weasley do it, if he was the one who dropped it in the first place. Weird gryffindors.
It had started as a simple liking to get him angry, his eyes shone in a funny way when Draco managed to said the right things to make him snap. On his luckiest days, their dispute ended with both of them rolling on the floor, punching each other. He never usually won, but God it was worth it. When his friends asked him in fourth year, as a joked, why he enjoyed so much having Potter’s body above him, he didn’t know what to say. It was on his fifth year when he knew he was gay.
The lift doors closed; Harry turned his face towards him. He had an open smile that suddenly turned into a tight one. Draco didn’t know what it meant.
“I never knew why you did it.” Harry whispered. He didn’t need to ask him what he was talking about. “I meant to ask you about it. But when I saw you again, too much time had passed.”
“Could you please leave your games and be honest for a moment? I’m doing this because I don’t want my friend to get hurt. Your ticket’s number will be the one coming out of that box.”
Draco thought. Shacklebolt always memorized his speeches, that was one of the reason Draco respected the man. He was a great speaker. The minister started to speak to the crowd, the same calm rhythm he usually used. However, this time Draco detected some sorrow in his words.
Before any answer could be heard, the lift arrived to the selected floor and opened its door to show a desperate redhead holding hands with a tousled brown-haired girl.
Draco stood in the middle of the room, a funny feeling inside his chest. Many times, along the five years working at the ministry, he had seen Harry leaving work with his friends. He always wondered if the brunet took them home, if they spent the evening watching movies like he knew muggles did or if they ordered take-out food and dined at Harry’s table. Draco knew he wanted to be Harry’s lover, but he also knew he had wanted to be Harry’s friend for much longer. He always had known, even if at some point he had hated himself a little because of it. Maybe that was the reason he didn’t think of himself as one of Harry’s friends. Yeah, they talked a lot every time they meet in the ministry, they teased each other and there was a light mood when they did it. But Harry had never asked him to spend time together outside work, much less to hang out in Harry’s place.
“The winning ticket is one which number is nine hundred and ninety-” Draco couldn’t breathe. “-eight!” It had to be a dream; it couldn’t be true. “Nine hundred and ninety-eight! The winning ticket is nine hundred and ninety-eight!”
“So, there you are! Ladies and gentlemen, tonight’s winner is Hanna from the Improper Use of Magic Office! Please, let’s make miss Hanna welcome.”
Justin, almost as if he had forgotten about it, handed him a folder. Draco opened it. Perfect, he needed Justin’s team’s report to finish his final analysis.
Draco used to hate small talking, but he treasured ever little talk with Harry. Since some time on they were no longer nemesis, they were not quite friends though.
Harry started to walk and, before Draco could said something, grabbed the door knob. He stood there an extra couple of seconds and turned towards Draco.
Right below all that, there was a sneaked photo. Harry was in the cafeteria, seated, half way trough taking a sip from his paper cup, someone must’ve joked because a second after the brunet grinned that beautiful smile that took Draco’s breath away. His bright green eyes sparkled, he showed every lovely white tooth, his cheeks were flushed and his hair was -as always- a mess. Draco wonder, not for the first time, if it would be too much to steal one of those posters and post it on the ceiling above his bed. Draco felt the little silly smile taking place, the one that appeared every time he thought of Harry. The lift’s door open. Draco froze.
You. CAN’T. Go.” he was yelling, crying. Begging. “I told you when I helped you out of the manor; if you go alone, he will kill you! DON’T YOU GET IT?!”
An hour after arriving to his office, Draco heard someone knocking on the door. He frowned and checked his watch, 9:00, it will be another hour before Amelia’s usual report.
“I couldn’t go either. Millie asked me to help her finishing her report. What did you do? They said it was a lot of fun.”
-I, in the name of the British Ministry of Magic, thank you all for the great support you have shown. This has been a difficult year and I am afraid to confirm that next one will be as difficult. But let’s not forget our mission to help the ones who needs us the most, because I am certain that together will be able to keep moving…
He had thought about it all night. Buying a ticked shouldn’t be such a big thing, it didn’t guarantee him getting a kiss, he made the math. They were going to sell one thousand tickets, it meant he had 0.1% possibilities of winning. That and nothing was pretty much the same, so he shouldn’t make it a big deal. He couldn’t stop his heart from racing at the single thought, though.
It was all he wanted. He didn’t know what would be worst. Winning and getting kissed by the famous Harry Potter in front of everyone, getting his deepest secret discovered to the world. Or watching someone else winning. He would give so much to get that kiss.
. And you would say an auror knows when he is been watched. Do you really think yourself capable of saving us all again?” Draco teased. They both laughed.
“Well, I don’t get it either. And I decided to stay so I could help you out with the coffee machine, on the first time I tried to used it, I made a mess. Hermione scolded me all day long.”
Draco turned to gaze at Hanna, who now looked confused. Clenching her dress between her fingers. The previous offense now transformed into shame. Draco acknowledge her acting skills, she almost seemed to be shocked watching all the balls signed with that number. Draco’s number.
“Oh, right, right.” Draco thanked his good luck. “This Saturday is the new year’s celebration, isn’t it? I was thinking to ask Millie out, are you going with someone?”
The rest of the day came slowly. With no other report to finish, Draco’s mind jumped from one train of thought to the next. He needed to stop looking for things where there was nothing to look for. Right, sometimes Harry made some weird comments, but that didn’t mean anything at all! He needed to stop daydreaming about Harry, dissecting every word the brunet had ever told him.
Harry gazed at his briefcase and then at his face. He obviously didn’t believe him. Finally letting his façade down, Draco put his briefcase in the empty chair in front of Harry and headed to the coffee maker.
Draco was seated along the bar, not facing the stage, holding a half empty glass in one hand. It was only time that kept him away from facing the big moment. Very little time.
When coffee was ready, he put two cups on the table. One for Harry. One for him. They started to work in silence. The sound of quill against parchment filling as background music. As he sipped his coffee, Draco recalled Harry’s homemade bread. It would have been good to save some to enjoy it together.
“Nah, just me. The others didn’t get his paperwork dropped by their stupid partner. I think I will be here tomorrow too.”
“There won’t be another raffle.” said Harry. “I am really sorry, but I was against all this since the begging. I’m sure a reasonable solution will be arranged, but there won’t be another raffle.”
at it. He tried it on, it was a little bit too long at length and more than a little tight on the arms. Harry didn’t complain.
“I gotta get going, guys.” said the brown-haired man as he waved goodbye. “Draco, tell Adam I say hello, I hope I meet him tomorrow.”
Draco didn’t even blink. Harry kissed him. Soft thick lips. He tasted Harry’s breath in his own mouth. Draco didn’t wait any longer, and kissed him back.
It was the cheesiest slogan he had ever read. And the stupid slogan was right, so told him his heart. The poster was Auror Headquarters’ strategy to get that extra vacation week. Draco knew, not because he memorized it from reading it over and over again - of course no! – what was written after that.
“Weasley, Granger.” Draco greeted. He took a step out of the lift and inside the room. It would had been nice to talk to Harry a little bit longer. Maybe they would meet tomorrow inside the lift again, they were running into each other there lately. “Good night, Potter.”
It was now. There was no turning back. With every turn of the box, Draco felt dizzier. He shoved a hand inside his left pocket, feeling the ticket. Fucking Melin. He wanted to win. He
“I was the one who altered the raffled.” said Harry. The air grew thicker. Draco’s blood left his face. Was he mocking him? It couldn’t be happening. They were almost friends, why would Harry make such a thing? Was it some kind of joke he didn’t understand? Did he pity him or something?
“Are you mocking me? Did you bring me here to tell me it was all a joke?” He wanted to run away. He needed to go. He raised from the couch, but Harry stopped him.
“I don’t know about the whole department, but I was assigned some crazy report too. He wants next year’s expenses analysis before Saturday.”
“Good as usual, Potter.” deliberately, the looked Harry from head to toe, wanting to tease him. “So, I see you liked my coat.”
It was 7:00 o’clock in the evening and his assistant’s working hours were from 8 am to 5 o’clock. She never left before everything was perfectly ready for the next day and she never complained about it. It was one of the reasons Draco liked her very much. Sometimes he wondered if, just like him, she went to an empty home too.
The door slammed open. Andromeda was wearing a badly tied up dressing gown, too light to be worn in the cold of the street. Her face equally pissed and surprised.
. It will be one of those few weeks. Maybe going home to get some proper sleep will be no option for the next couple of days, not if he wanted to have his report done on time next Friday, and he really wanted that to happened. The clock on his wall ticked and it wasn’t until his stomach made a funny sound, he realized two more hours had gone by.
“For goodness sake, Draco! What the hell are you doing knocking on my door like that at midnight?! Teddy’s sleeping!!?
It was midday when Draco remembered Harry’s homemade bread. He carried his hands to the opposite side of his desk and delicately grabbed the navy-blue square. It was so nicely, neatly wrapped, like Harry took his time to do it. He didn’t picture Harry as someone who knew that kind of wrapping, so maybe he looked it up. His heart twisted sweetly. He had been a dozen times in France, and a dozen times he had been gifted French pastry, but not once in his life he had been given homemade bakery.
“This’s month report is inside the yellow folder, as always. Take it to Theo so he can sing them. Please, wait until he does so and then take them yourself to the minister’s office, last time Theo’s assistant managed to make a mess of them. I’ll immediately sing the papers you gave me and today at 11 will be done this year’s analysis, I just need to finish some graphics. Please, come in at 11 to get them.”
Ron Weasley was seated next to him, attempting to look indifferent, but failing completely. Draco didn’t say a word, trying to figure out if the redhead had addressed him, or some invisible being among them. He arched a brow when Weasley turned his head to see him.
Draco seated on his office’s chair behind his desk, organized some papers, looked for his favorite feather and started with what he expected was his last hours of working on that stupid report. He craved for a full night sleep.
Harry was wearing a full smile on the face and Draco’s coat over the shoulders. He looked stunning. Draco shivered, recalling old Hogwarts’ fantasies. A tied-up Harry and Slytherin ties. Nowadays he preferred the fantasies where Harry tied him up instead. His body temperature increased.
Draco left his seat, took his cashmere coat and headed to the lift. There was no power in the world that could stop him from having coffee and a luscious French sweet at 9. He carried his sweets inside his left coat’s pocket, but would have to settled to Common Salon’s coffee.
“We fell asleep at some point. It’s four am.” Harry started to gather his papers. “I’m going home, you should do the same. You’re a mess.”
Draco knocked the door like his life depended on it. He held between both hands all the sickles and knuts he could find inside his office. They should be enough to complete a galleon. They had to be.
Draco could have sworn that, before the flames wrapped him completely, he saw aunt Andromeda grabbing some owling paper.
It was four in the morning when he felt something touching his shoulder. He opened his eyes, didn’t know he had closed them.
“It’s getting late.” said Harry. For a brief moment, Draco thought the was about to say something else.
Draco went inside the lift along a dozen other people. The happy chitchat showing everyone’s excitement for tomorrow’s big celebration. ‘I told Valerie I’ll pick her up at five’, ‘I’ve got another ticket!’, ‘would it be too much if I use the green robes instead?’ It almost seemed like there wasn’t a big extra report for every department to hand in at the end of the day.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Weasley. I don’t know anything about a ticket. Now, if you excuse me, I have to be somewhere else.” the redhead reached him by the arm to stop him from leaving. “Take your filthy hand away from me right now, or Granger will have to burden with a one-armed husband for the rest of her life!”
Draco wanted to reached Harry by the shoulder, to explain himself. But halfway he heard a pop, and Harry Disappeared.
“Something’s not right! She must have cheated somehow.” Harry screamed desperately, all that dreamy-like aura transformed into wild displeasure that nobody understood. Hanna, struggling to keep the smile on her face, seemed to be offended by Harry’s reaction. She also seemed nervous. Really nervous.
The brightest of all the smiles appeared on Harry’s face, lifting his whole being in the process. His eyebrows raised up as an effect of his surprise, his cheeks pulled up that beautiful smile. His back was not hunched but straightened. Harry looked like a reborn man; whose hope had brought him back to life.
Draco finished the firsts six months of his report and, for some reason he didn’t allow himself to think about too much, he told his assistant he would be the one taking them to the minister. It was a simple coincidence that the minister was in a meeting with the Auror Department.
Draco, chin lifted, was on defensive mode, wondering how his little joke had managed to travel that far. And what did it had to do with Weasley, anyway?
Feeling like twenty hours had come and gone, he looked at his clock. It was 9 o’clock in the evening. Since he had finished and handed in his report already, he didn’t have an excuse to go down for coffee. He could just go home. However, Draco took his briefcase, his coat and went down to his now usual floor.
“Absolutely perfect, Mr. Malfoy. That was all I needed to hear. If Mr. Adams is outside, please let him in.”
Harry’s cheeks where completely flushed. Draco didn’t know why he used to joked like that. He supposed it was an almost-friends thing.
They were glued from chest to hip, but neither of them felt it was enough. Harry tilted his body even more, getting him to lay on the couch. Two more movements and their legs were tangled. It had always been like that between them. They only needed a spark to get everything to explode.
Draco found himself alone in his office again. Through the fake-view window, he could see a beautifully painted pink sky, he wondered if it looked remotely the same outside. He doubted it. Draco stretched his neck and kept working a little more. It would be one of those nights.
“His name is Adam, no you don’t know him, he left with November’s cut. Now, for the love of everything that is holly,
“You- you know tomorrow is the new year’s celebration and maybe it is too late already but, you know…” Harry was babbling nonsensically. “well, would you like to go with-”
“I’ve been meeting you on purpose in the lift for weeks. On Wednesday I told Ron I would meet him on that floor because I knew you’d probably be there. On Thursday I didn’t go to your office just to give you some homemade bread, I intended to asked you out, but I chickened out. The only reason I didn’t kill Ron when he lost our papers was because it gave me an excuse to spend time with you.” Harry’s smile grew wider. “I’ve been dying to kiss you again since years ago.”
A thick silence, that Draco didn’t know how to cut through, grew among them. Both bodies equally tense, none of them facing each other, both staring straight ahead. When Draco summoned the courage to turn his head, he found the wild determination on Harry’s face gone. Taking its place, there was a bright but jittery gaze. A funny blush coloring all Harry’s face.
Music was soft and cheerful, barely perceptible above the crowd’s whisper and the tableware’s clatter. Witches and wizards dressed in their finest robes, wearing their favorite makeup and their happiest smiles. The Common Salon, elegant and lustrous, looked nothing like the office it had been the day before. Full size windows had been placed on every wall, enchanted to show the nocturnal landscape of some cold foreign country. Candles and lanterns placed everywhere to bestow a beautiful, warm, golden-like light.
He followed the woman and knocked twice as she instructed him. It must’ve been a busy day for Richard, the improvised waiting room was crowdy. He recognized two elder witches from the Investigation Department and Justin from his own.
“Today our office will be repaired, and I need to work on the report Ron lost.” He hesitated for one single moment. Draco thought Harry wouldn’t keep talking but then he saw the auror’s eyes change. Gryffindor determination, Draco had called that look many years ago. “I will be in the Common Salon this evening, you know, if you want some company while you finish yours.”
Draco liked his assistant, she was incredibly good at doing her job, was no interested in small talking and, she had an exquisite fashion taste. He couldn’t help a little surprise when, after a couple of seconds, the young witch remained in front of him. When he -finally- looked up, he found that there was indeed some concerned in the girl’s face. She was holding her hands behind her back and swinging nervously. Draco sighed, already resigned.
to win. He needed to win to kiss Harry with the kiss he had been keeping all this time. The one that had been born on fifth year when, hiding behind a wall, Draco saw him wandering alone at night, worried to death by the look on Harry’s eyes. That kiss that keep him alive when he was been tortured inside his own house.
A barely audible knocking echoed through the room and, after Draco’s answer, a brown-haired man came in. War and the years that followed after, changed Draco. He was no longer the spoilt little boy he was once and was ready to prove it to everybody. However, people like Justin used to the get under his skin. Draco looked up, trying really hard -or maybe not that much- to control his temper.
“Well, it seems to me and all the Auror Department that the raffled has been intervened. The owner of the ticket which number is 998 has been disqualified. Once we know what and how it happed, we’ll inform you the details of the new raffle. Thank you so mu-”
He felt childlike, wishing Harry had made it specifically for him. Draco took a bite to the homemade bread. It tasted like the sweetest delicacy.
“Ladies and gentlemen, I know you all have been waiting for this moment for weeks. If we had known the tickets would get sold out so quickly, we would have double the price.”
help, I will grant you the honor of having one of my French sweets.” Harry raised his hand facing up and Draco put the little sweet on top of it.
work. Now, he knew it was there where his current tortuous predicament had started, though in a completely different way.
. Next year will close with his boss’ retirement and six months before that they will look for someone to take his position. If Draco wanted to take it, it would really help him to count with the head auror’s support. And Draco wanted to take it. He knew he was good doing his job, and he actually enjoyed it.
He wasn’t sure what his reaction would be in any of the two situations, but he was there to find out.
“I’m leaving now, Mr. Malfoy. All pending business were accomplished and I have listed tomorrow’s already.”
“Yes! Nice. But it seems to me, it is impossible to be nice with you.” He took another sip. He was drinking far more anxiously than Draco thought he should be. “Who’s Adam?”
Draco’s brain stopped. One heartbeat. Two. Three. After a whole minute, Draco said the only thing he could. The only thing he seemed to be capable of thinking that night.
“Ok, thanks, I’ll handle it.” Generic coffee or turn water into coffee magically. This night Draco’s options were not great.
At 10 o’clock in the morning, his assistant knocked on his door and entered, ready to recite that day’s business pending.
Once he arrived, he shook some hands and met some people, but the moment he finished talking to Theo, he knew he needed to be alone. If he really was doing it, he needed to gather some courage. The most unexpected of all the voices, brought him back to the present.
Draco said a polite answer, but after that, Harry didn’t move nor say anything for a while. He looked even more edgy than before.
When Harry stepped into his office, Draco tried to look like he didn’t just rush to the mirror to check on his appearance, though all thought about his own looks blurred when he saw him. Harry’s green shirt made his skin look lovely and his black jeans fitted him in all the right places to make Draco’s mouth watery.
The day went by. Draco analyzed data, graphics, previous years’ reports and how bad it could really be meeting Harry in the Common Salon. He looked for excuses all day to go outside his office and take the lift.
Making a hand gesture, he thanked his assistant and got back to work. Once he heard the door closing, he allowed himself to close his eyes and took one hand to his forehead. He could feel his cheeks getting warmer as he remembered that morning’s incident. It had been the stupidest thing he had done in a long while. An he didn’t even get to buy the freaking ticket.
All along that day he had felt nauseous. Time going by, neither slow nor fast enough for his racing heart to be still. He needed a distraction, but no matter the activity he chose to distract his thoughts with, he couldn’t focus. One hour before eight, Draco was dressed and ready to go. His most sophisticated black suit, his favorite par of shoes and the finest robe his mother had sent him. Not a single hair out of place. Not a single clue about whether he was getting dressed to get kissed or to go back home brokenhearted. Maybe a little of both.
He passed next to the sculpture every day, but he had never done so with Harry by his side. It made the situation different. Suddenly, everything the war had put them through felt too real. Without planning, they stopped to face the horrible thing. A non-stablished form. A smooth surface. Its black color mirroring the warm orange from the lit lanterns. Some said the sculptor based his work upon the shape Harry’s spell took when killing Voldemort. To Draco, the sculpture always reminded him of the Fiendfire’s shape.
him. He must’ve been daydreaming; Harry, noticing his lack of respond kept talking. “Well, I hope seeing you there, enjoy the banana bread.”
Harry took a deep breath and turn his head to face him. They were not as far as Draco first thought.
Out of the blue, Harry laughed. It took a couple of seconds for Draco to realized what he had just said and how it could be interpreted.
Both wizards were looking at each other, there was some electric feeling between them, they were so close again. Draco felt dizzy looking directly into those wonderful eyes. A heartbeat went through. Two. Three. Draco’s pulse was beating inside his ears, he knew he had that stupid smile again. He just couldn’t help it!
The lift reached his floor and he stepped outside, greeted some colleagues and walked inside his office. A nice warm breeze kissed his face as he entered. He hung his coat on the rack, wondering whether Harry would wear his coat today or not. Last night they parted so suddenly he forgot about the coat he lent him.
Silence embraced them. It was no secret the redhead and the blond couldn’t stand each other. Draco faced the door, feeling how the conversation drifted away. He got a little surprised when he noticed another poster at the bottom of the doors. It wasn’t there that morning. He released something between a laugh and a snort.
Only the match never happened. Professor McGonagall came onto the field before they could start, holding an enormous purple megaphone. She announced that the game had been cancelled and that all students must make their way back to the House common rooms, where our Heads of Houses will give us further information. I had just left the stands when Professor Snape walked up to me and asked me to come with him. First I thought they suspected me again and that I would sure be expelled now. But it was much worse than that. Professor Snape didn’t take me to his office, or headmaster Dumbledore’s office. No, he took me to the hospital wing. He explained that there had been another attack and when we entered the hospital wing I could see her.
“I’m fine, Teddy. Just a little stomach bug,” Draco lies. He’s pretty sure this isn’t a stomach bug, more a ‘you’ll be feeling like this for the next eight months or so and by the end, you wished you started those birth control potions sooner’ bug. But it had taken three years after Lily before Draco even got pregnant again. How was he supposed to know his body suddenly figured out how to fall pregnant within a heartbeat?
“I know,” Harry says. He looks at his hand held by his father’s. “It’s something I’ve known for a while now. I just never said it out loud.”
I was more worried about my Firebolt. When I wasn’t flying on it I locked it into my trunk to make sure no Gryffindor would be able to sabotage it. Draco was worried that Nott or Crabbe might do something with it, but they wanted our house to win just as much as everyone else, so I believed they would not do anything to jeopardise our chances.
Things have gone from bad to worse. It seems everyone thinks I’m the heir of Slytherin. There’s this boy in Hufflepuff named Justin, he ran away from me one day when I wanted to great him in the library. And Ron and Neville don’t want to be seen with me either. None of the Gryffindors wants to by the way. I’m not allowed to eat at their table anymore. I tried to explain that it wasn’t me, but nobody seems to want to listen. Only Hermione and Blaise still hang out with me, and the girl Blaise has been hanging out with. Her name is Luna and she’s a bit crazy, but I like her. She doesn’t seem to care about what happened at all.
On Tuesday I made sure I got out of bed before Nott and Crabbe woke up and spend the entire day sitting on a toilet listening to Myrtle complain about the fact that Hermione is not visiting anymore and that she’s a horrible friend. I tried to explain that she had to go home for the holidays and would be back in January, but Myrtle didn’t believe me.
We took a place in the stands and Ron and Neville brought binoculars so we could see even better. Lee Jordan, a friend of Ron’s brothers was giving commentary for the match and it was clear that he wanted Gryffindor to win. It was a very exciting game and my friends around me cheered when Gryffindor score the first goal. I pretended to be outraged about this and we had a good laugh. Hagrid came to join us and he asked me how I was doing. I told him I was good. I didn’t mention that the bullying is still going on and all the others were too involved in the game to tell Hagrid otherwise. Gryffindor got a penalty and scored again. Dean started shouting that they should hand out a red card, making me and Hermione laugh. Ron, Neville and Seamus didn’t understand which made it even more amusing. And when Slytherin scored I cheered for my team. Ron tried to muffle my screams by placing his hand over my mouth, but I just batted it away. It was good fun. Slytherin scored five more times after that and Ron and Seamus were getting upset that I was still cheering them on. But in the end, the Gryffindor Seeker caught the Snitch and Gryffindor won by one hundred and seventy to sixty.
Harry, Ron, Neville and Hermione eat and joke around. Ron complains about his little sister and how she keeps interfering with his life. Harry ignores Lavender’s advances and Hermione is excited about all the subjects she’s taking this year. Before they even know it the meal has come to a close, Dumbledore has given his final warnings and they are off towards Gryffindor tower.
Harry raises his eyebrows. “What do you mean?” he asks. “Placing the traps, or going after Pettigrew?”
‘You’re an idiot,’ Malfoy writes. He takes his note (or more his letter seeing the number of words already on the parchment) and folds it up and puts it in his bag. Harry wonders what was on it. What did Malfoy think Harry had done?
Draco pushes his knee against Harry, who forces a smile on his face. They drop the subject and focus on their homework again. The morning continues on, and at some point, Hermione and Neville sit down opposite them. Nobody says a word about the fact that they are all at the Slytherin table. Even the Slytherins don’t seem to mind all that much. They just make sure that there is plenty of room between them and the Gryffindors. It’s fun doing all the homework together, and from time to time Draco and Harry’s knees touch each other. Every time it happens Harry blushes a little and his heart speeds up. Is Draco doing it deliberately? Could Hermione and Neville be correct? Does Draco also like Harry in the way Harry likes him? It can’t be, can it? Draco never showed any sign of being gay. But then, Harry also doesn’t advertise it. He’s just a normal boy, who likes other boys instead of girls. There is no special way to act, just because you’re gay. So maybe Draco could be? Harry just doesn’t know. He needs to find a way to breach the subject without Draco finding out that Harry is gay, until Harry knows for sure that Draco will be okay with it all.
Weasley steps up next to Granger and takes a hold of her hand. He looks at Draco and nods his head. “He died last night,” he says. His voice is flat and broken.
Harry stares at Malfoy, at his downturned head as he strives away from the lake. He’s right, Harry is acting like a coward. Just moments ago he was sitting next to Draco Malfoy, holding his pinkie like it was the most natural thing in the world. Harry wants to hold it again. And not just under a blanket. He wants the world to know that he’s fallen for Malfoy. It’s time he starts acting like a true Gryffindor. He stands up and runs after Malfoy.
Sometime during the party Miles convinced me to open up the golden egg to see what would be inside. But I had to close it as soon as I opened it. This was because of the horrible screechy wailing that came from the egg. Everyone pitched in to guess what the sound was (Greg thought of Banshees, Miles mentioned the Cruciatus Curse and Blaise said it sounded more like Draco singing in the shower).
“What are you and your dad doing this Christmas?” Ginny asks Luna. Luna looks up from her copy of the Quibbler and smiles at them all. She’s a bit weird, but somehow, she brings the best sides of Ginny out, so Harry doesn’t mind having her around. Even if she has the craziest ideas and beliefs in fairy tales.
“He didn’t fall, he was pushed,” Greg says. “This newspaper is a joke.” He pushes a piece of bacon into his mouth and shakes his head. Pansy looks at him with disapproval, but she doesn’t say a word. She must have given up on trying to teach Greg and Vincent some decent table manners.
“I don’t want you to get your hopes up,” the healer continues. “It is only in rare cases that the second scan holds better results. It’s a precaution. But after seeing your foetus, it’s clear that it should have had a heartbeat by now.”
The next thing I remember is Draco holding me in his arm, begging me to wake up. I opened my eyes and was happy to see that Draco wasn’t as white anymore as when I found him on the Chamber’s floor. I asked him if we were dead. He told me we weren’t and that I had to stay awake. Draco was crying and I knew he had seen the wound in my arm. He was begging me to stay with him. I said I was sorry. There was no way to save me. It hurt so much hearing Draco pleads, begging me not to leave him alone. I told him I love him and he said it back to me. I knew I hadn’t long, I was in so much pain and Draco’s face was fading in and out of focus. I remember whisperings ‘please kiss me’ and the next thing I know is the feeling of Draco’s lips on mine. It made me forget the pain and despair reaching inside me. I could only feel his warm breath against mine, his lips pushing against mine, opening slightly and biting on my bottom lip. It was perfect. And I thought that this was not a bad way to go, with the boy I love kissing me.
When I had finished I was sent upstairs, where I had to pretend that I wasn’t here. Only there was one little problem. When I walked into my room something was sitting on my bed. It was a little creature, with large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. It were the same eyes I had seen in the hedge earlier that day. As soon as the creature saw me he slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its nose touched the carpet. He said it was an honour to meet me. He told me his name was Dobby and that he was a house-elf. And everything went downhill from there.
I thought this was a nice way to end the evening, but all went a bit crazy. Viktor and I heard someone in the forest and when we looked around it turned out that Mr Crouch was staggering through the forest. He looked awful. The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his face was scratched, and he was unshaven and grey with exhaustion. He was muttering and gesticulating. It looked like he was talking to someone that only he could see. And then he fell to his knees, grabbed my robes and gasped the headmaster's name. He said he needed to see headmaster Dumbledore, that he’d done something stupid. And then he let go of me and started talking to the tree again.
When we (Hermione, Ron, Neville and I) got to Hagrid’s hut all the curtains were closed and Hagrid even asked who it was before he let us in. I asked him about the stone and if he knew what else was guarding it, but Hagrid didn’t know. He only told us, after Hermione flattered him, that some professor’s helped with the guarding. Most of them are fine professors, but Snape was one of them. And I’m still sure he wants to steal the stone. And if he helped with the guarding, he might even know how to get past the other spells and protections in place. But Hagrid promised us that only he and Dumbledore know how to get past Fluffy, so I think the stone is safe for now.
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione says. “We went over this yesterday. I will sit down next to Malfoy and you will hand him a note explaining he’s allowed to copy my notes. And I will make sure he can read them.” She looks bored. Harry expects her to go check her nails any moment now.
“You’re at the wrong table,” Ron tells her. He points his fork towards the Ravenclaw table and then takes another bite of his eggs.
Oh, I must tell you about Fred and George, you remember Ron’s brothers. They are the only students, next to Hermione, that don’t think I am the heir of Slytherin. They make jokes about it all the time. When they see me walking down a corridor, they come to march ahead of me, shouting: ‘Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through.’ And making jokes like: ‘Harry’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea whit his fanged servant.’  It makes me feel a little better to know that there are at least two other people that think it’s ludicrous that I’m the heir of Slytherin.
And then Saturday arrived. It was a very dark and cloudy night. Draco made sure Nott, Crabbe and Goyle didn’t come into the dormitory when I took out my cloak and hit it under my pillow. Around eleven, when everyone except Draco and I were asleep I hit underneath my cloak and walked up to the Gryffindor common room after Draco wished me luck.
He should put on some decent clothes so he can go out and do some shopping. He can’t live on stale bread and fancy butter alone. And a good cup of tea would do Harry good. The normal store brand. The once he would buy before Draco.
Neville and Harry looked for a spot to hide yesterday on their way to Hogsmeade. They didn’t find anything at all. Hermione and Ron didn’t help. Hermione thinks the whole idea of tracking down Pettigrew is insane. And Ron wants to stay on her good side, so he agrees with her. If he wasn’t so head over heels for Hermione, he would have helped. Ron always loves a good adventure.
Pettigrew doesn’t seem to notice that Harry is moving, so Harry risks another step. His eyes stay fixed on Pettigrew’s hand. Draco’s wand inside it, pointing at Draco’s throat. Harry can’t see his eyes, but he doesn’t miss the tears that drip from Draco’s chin.
Two pale grey eyes stare intensely at Harry. “I’ll love you forever, Harry,” Draco says. “You were never a fling to me, you’re everything.”
“Wish I could make it better,” Neville says. “Draco was a fool for leading you on like that, and we all won’t talk to him ever again.”
“One more remark like that and you can leave this house,” Harry says from the doorway. Pansy looks up at him and waves her hand in front of her face.
“Stop!” Narcissa screams. There is a power in her command that rings through the room. The pain fades away. Draco takes deep breaths as he stares at the ceiling of his room. His save place to hide when he was younger and had angered his father. Or to hide from the Dark Lord this summer. Only now the ceiling is the roof of his prison, the last thing he will see before it all ends.
We’ve been flying around in the fields behind Mr & Mrs Tonks house. It’s nice to practice together for the coming Quidditch season at Hogwarts. I’m really looking forward to being a part of the Quidditch team together with Draco. And so is Draco, he won’t shut up about it in the letters he writes me. We write almost every day. When his owl comes to deliver his letter I can’t help but smile. Tonks says it’s super cute, Mrs Tonks says it’s heart-warming and Mr Tonks just tells me to make sure that Draco will always know how much I love him. He’s a bit of a sap, Mr Tonks. He buys flowers for Mrs Tonks every other day.
Harry doesn’t know how long it takes for Malfoy to calm down, and he doesn’t care either. He just holds Malfoy in his arms and lets him cry. It’s the least he can do for the boy now that Harry understands him a little better.
Draco looks up at her. Andromeda smiles at him. It doesn’t reach her eyes, but Draco appreciates the gesture.
Draco sobs and he shivers in Harry’s arms. Harry holds Draco up with his arms as Draco cries against Harry’s shoulder.
Harry looks at Iris and Neville. He squeezes Iris’ hand softly. “I’m fine, Iris. You don’t have to worry,” he says.
The next morning we talked to Sirius about my scar hurting and he was not pleased. He said that I should not worry, that he was just overreacting, but he left that afternoon to talk to Dumbledore about it. He also talked about signs, and that we should all be careful. He gave Draco a look before he left. I hate it when he does that, look at Draco like he’s the enemy. Draco hates it too, he tries so hard to get on Sirius’ good side but nothing seems to convince him that Draco is not a bad person.
“Nothing,” Neville says. “What are you up to today?” he asks Iris to distract her. Harry will have to remember to thank him later.
That day we drove around again all day until we got to the coast and we had to take a rowboat to a shack on a large rock way out at sea. I couldn’t sleep that night. It was cold and the floor was hard and I only had a thin ragged blanket. It was storming. When it turned twelve and it was my birthday someone was knocking on the door of the shack. Everybody woke up and uncle Vernon had a rifle warning the person at the door to leave. And then the door swung clean off its hinges and a giant of a man walked into the house. He had shaggy manes and a wild tangled beard and black glinting eyes. He said I looked like you, dad, but that I have mum eyes. I never knew that they didn’t tell me that either. I’m kinda proud to look like you, dad, now that I know you died trying to protect me. Hagrid, the giant man, told me what happened to you. What that evil wizard had done.
Harry isn’t sure if that is a good idea. Getting them both killed is not the best way to deal with heartache. But it will get their minds off it all. And Pettigrew needs to be found. They can see if they can figure out where he’s hiding. And then tell their dad. They won’t go after him but just look for him. That way they won’t technically break their promise.
“Thing, Justin, important things” like complaining to Pansy about how dull life was “Don’t you have some papers to hand in?”
Harry stepped forward, looking at him. It was now or never. A happy warm feeling filling him inside. He wasn’t going home heartbroken. The blond raised from his seat.
“So, what are you doing down here?” Harry seemed confused. “You said you were meeting Weasley. But he already left and you are still here.”
It was there, Draco knew. That was the exact moment where he was supposed to jump. He felt his blood warming and reddening his face, the shacking of his hands between Harry’s; who was getting closer and closer to him. He gulped.
Harry winced. “You’re right, I did say that. But I still care about him, at least enough to care that he’s all right.”
Ginny laughed out loud at that, and Draco felt pleased with himself. “So long as you don’t put any of us in mortal danger, I think the Weasley clan can adapt to almost anything, but you’re right, Ron is such an easy mark.”
Harry shook his head and cast his mind about for an alternative. “Maybe the map on the shower curtain?”
Harry tried to picture himself at a concert in a basement with ghosts, and kept coming up with images of Draco floating above his bed, or blindfolded, or dancing to the Bee Gees.
“Draco, I can see where you're coming from, it’s just that I can’t help feeling empathy for them. Imagine what it must be like, to find out that your mum or your dad or your brother died in one of those towers. Wouldn’t you want to make the world a bit better for them?”
Harry, at the moment that Draco was bemoaning his absence on his therapist’s couch, was not doing well. He longed to spell Hermione and unload everything on her, but it wasn’t the end of the week yet and besides, he couldn’t betray Draco by revealing his identity. He was still angry at Draco for putting him in this position of dishonesty, yet at the same time he really couldn’t blame him. The rules were different in his world, and Harry despaired that he might never be able to connect with him in a meaningful way, especially after holding out against him while he waited for Draco to come around and agree to share their secret with his friends. Why did he have to be so set in sticking to his principles all the time? Couldn’t he, for once, indulge his Slytherin side and throw integrity to the winds?
“So Potter doesn’t want to be a Wizard.” There was a feeling of cognitive dissonance that he couldn’t shake when he thought of the Boy Who Lived choosing to ignore his fame and fortune made in the Wizarding world, in favor of living anonymously among Muggles. Maybe there was poetic justice in it, but Draco felt more annoyed by it than anything. Here he was, forced more or less into an exile made sweeter only by superficial comforts, and yet someone who was at least partially responsible for Draco’s misfortune would deny himself the endless sweetness available to him. What an effing idiot.
Harry was suddenly reminded of his missing body part, and of the instructions given to him by the Mediwizards in the meantime.  “How much of this do you think I should take?” Harry asked, holding up one of the many tiny bottles they had left for him. “I forget what they said, and my glasses don’t work nearly as well with just one ear to sit on.”
Draco looked to be on the verge of cracking an expression, but Harry’s eyes were blurring already at the gesture of truce between them, as preliminary as it might be. He felt maudlin and laughable, like he had two left feet and could take off toward the ceiling any minute in the manner of an escaped balloon.
“It’s early yet, no need to get up.” Draco settled back into bed, spelling the breakfast tray to float above the covers out of harm’s way. “Unless you feel like it.” His stare was arch. “They’re all busy downstairs with preparing for our grand transformation after lunch, which means that you and I have a bit of time to ourselves.”
The commanding inflection of her voice turned it into a statement instead of a question, and Draco felt his hackles going up. He tilted his chin back far enough to look down his nose at her, which felt slightly ridiculous. “He is Draco Malfoy, what’s it to you?”
only just began to describe the feeling, and he jumped a little when Malfoy answered the door almost immediately.
Draco’s proximity was doing curious things to Harry’s insides, but the moment passed quickly and they finished up their cups in no time at all.
“Come here, I have something I’d like you to try.” Draco opened the fridge and pulled out a bottled drink that was darker than Felici-Fizz. “It’s from one of Nigel’s many family ventures. Some arrangement they made with South American shamans.”
“You never know, maybe she’ll even be pleased. It might boost her social standing a little, to be associated with the so-called ‘savior’ of the Wizarding order.” Harry didn’t really care that much about his mother’s social standing or about being hailed as a hero, but in the interest of understanding the rules of the Malfoy family game, and at Draco’s encouragement, he had started to become more outspoken about himself and his legacy.
He passed by a gaming arcade and shuddered at the sounds of mayhem floating out through the open door. Honestly, how people could revel in pretend violence so much, was beyond him. He had seen enough of actual violence, inflicted upon others and himself, to last a lifetime, and he was only twenty-one. Gaining the entrance of the bookshop, he was surprised to see a new display set up in the window, featuring brooms, hockey sticks, and books about sports, including Quidditch. Draco could not see the appeal of pushing a flat disc around on ice, but far be it from him to object to spreading the good word about Wizarding sports.
Harry had been invited to the annual Christmas Ball for Ministry employees and friends, and he had decided to bring Draco as his date. Which was how they found themselves wearing their finest and most outrageous dress robes as they hurried to enter the building where the Ball was being held. It was such an odd yet familiar sight to see each other in robes again, they didn’t know what to say, and made the climb up the stairs in silence.
Harry brought her a plate of breakfast and a virgin mimosa, which she sipped gratefully. “At a Muggle bookshop, of all places. He’s taken to working part-time through his immersion program.”
The interview wound down several questions later, and Draco felt a bit lightheaded when they finally rose from their seats and shook Hodges’ hand. He waited until they had left the interviewing chamber before wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulder. He could feel him trembling through his robes, and dropped a subtle kiss to his ear while whispering, “All right there, love?”
They segued into dancing once they'd worked the room a couple times, making introductions for Draco where necessary (no introductions were needed for Harry, of course). The dancefloor was crowded enough that Harry didn’t feel too self-conscious with Draco. As he looked around, he saw that a few other couples dancing were also male, one of which looked familiar. He squinted through his new glasses to bring them into focus. “Say, Draco, who is that couple over there, do we know them?”
Mysteria raised a glass and gestured for everyone at the table to do the same. “To being alone together!”
Draco felt a small thrill that the youngest Seeker of the past century trusted him enough to fly his broom, but reality quickly settled in. “Thanks for the offer, but it’d just buck me off if I tried. Part of the immersion terms.”
Harry didn’t answer right away, but did his best to hurry over to Draco and assess the damage. He didn’t show any bruises, and the only offensive object he might have been carrying was a small leather satchel, which had dropped to the ground in the struggle. His eyes were half-closed and he appeared to be breathing, to Harry’s relief.
Draco didn’t realize he was holding his breath until Harry approached him to give him a hug. He felt removed from the situation, as if he’d forgotten how to be a living human being, but he accepted Harry’s hug anyway because he didn’t want to hurt Harry’s feelings.
To any potential beta out there: I had some trouble coming up with an effective magical means for communication between wizards on the go, before mobile phones were ubiquitous, but eventually settled on com-spells, short for “communications spells,” which are sort of a modified charm based on the Floo Network. I am open to revising if you can help me come up with something better.
“It’s simply not up to us to govern the Muggle world for them,” Draco insisted. “I may have given up on my family’s Pureblood views about interbreeding and taken an interest in the course of Muggle history, but I still don’t think that means we have to take responsibility for how they run their lives.”
Draco sighed. “I really don’t think it would make much difference. So what if she finds out through front page news? There could be opportunities to meet with her later, I just don’t want to have to broach the initial conversation if I don’t have to.”
Feruza, it turned out, was fine, if a little shell-shocked herself. Harry, half-listening while he continued to kneel on the carpet, heard her explaining what happened to Ginny.
Ron brought Harry a sparkling water and encouraged him to make himself at home, before being called away by someone trying to reach him through the Floo upstairs. Hermione was out of sight for the time being, getting started on dinner. Harry took comfort in the familiarity of sitting near Ginny, without reminders of his other, shattered life around him for the time being.
“Bloody hell, Granger, can’t you cast some kind of pain relief charm? He said he’s hurting, and I think you should listen to him.”
Slowly, gradually, he swam back to consciousness. Draco removed the blindfold and handed Harry’s glasses back to him. The smirk on his face would have been annoying, except Harry was too blissed out to care. “Godric, that was – I don’t even have words for how fantastic that was.”
Speaking of agony… He felt an urge to put a hand down his own trousers as he removed Draco’s, and with Draco’s eyes widening as he watched, he went with it, wrapping his fingers around himself just as he had touched Draco moments before. No need to keep himself waiting, although he had no intention of coming just yet.
Harry shrugged and resumed looking at a portrait on the wall. This one was nice, a softly focused image in black and white of a model looking away from the photographer, head tipped back in a gesture of abandon. He thought the model looked a bit like Draco, with his long neck, elegant jawline and soft waves of blond hair.
“Family honor is really big with Malfoys, isn’t it.” Harry’s gaze was still fixed upon the scar, his fingers tracing automatically along the part that used to be a snake. “I can’t imagine being under that kind of pressure from my own parents, if they were still alive.”
They left Draco’s house and sought a quiet place in the park down the street where they might take off without being noticed. This proved to be more difficult than they thought, but they finally came upon a stand of trees that were tall enough to mask the first moments of flight.
“Sorry, I honestly didn’t think of it until now. I mostly use it for post or when I need to sign up for something, like at the arcades. It was the best way I could think of shaking off the press when I decided to go Muggle.”
Draco was touched by Harry’s gesture, but thankful for the change in topic, as he wasn’t anywhere near ready to dig through that basket of snakes. The meal turned out to be delicious again, a ragout served over polenta with a side of asparagus. Draco wondered to himself if Harry knew about the side effects of asparagus, but he needn’t have worried, as Harry pulled out a small bottle of Digester-All potion and two shot glasses. “I take it so I don’t have weird-smelling piss afterward,” he told Draco by way of explanation.
Harry looked slightly reassured. “Yeah, I guess there’s no harm, as long as we’re in a contained space, with people we know. Mostly.” He eyed Feruza uncertainly. “I don’t know about her, she scares me a little. Where do you think she’s from, Romania?”
Draco sniffed. “I suppose that’s why you might have found Ginny attractive, then? Hair like Mum’s, and all that?”
They did indeed have an entire section devoted to such works, and Draco led them to it, engaging in small talk with Ginny along the way. “How did the frock work out for you, any comments on it from the press?”
Hermione’s brow wrinkled in concern, mixed with tenderness. “You know, Harry never wanted all this. Going from living in the cupboard under the stairs, to becoming the Boy Who Lived and Conquered Lord V, I don’t think he ever fully adjusted to it.” She cupped her chin in one hand, gazing pensively into the distance. “Coming out in such a public way probably feels even worse, in some ways.”
They repeated the exercise a few times before landing in an upscale wine bar and restaurant. Harry was hungry by that point, and indicated that he wouldn’t mind eating, as long as the stranger didn’t think it was a date. “What is your name, by the way?”
Harry realized his mistake too late, but it felt beyond awkward to explain to a generous stranger that he was on the wagon, and really, the thought of having a drink while he and Draco were on the outs was so very tempting. Surely one beer wouldn’t make too much difference, not like the Ogden’s he practically swam in during the nadir of his partying days. Besides, Draco was probably out drinking himself right now, looking for his next Muggle boy toy to take home.
Draco squinted into the distance, considering. “More like a museum curator. Or a magical archivist.”
Draco clearly struggled to answer, but he waved aside any help from his defense. “I cannot say that my actions were directly tied to Mr. Potter’s influence, no.” He paused for a heart-stopping moment. “I will say however that I would not have been present if it weren’t for Mr. Potter and our desire to be positive role models for the Wizarding world.” His eyes barely flickered in Harry’s direction. “My actions, while misguided, were carried out with good intentions.”
“Enough about me, what about you, Draco?” Harry’s demeanor was much more relaxed after the second Felici-Fizz, and Draco liked it. “Any hair-raising stories about life at Malfoy Manor?”
It was odd that Harry didn’t want to talk about it, but Draco was feeling patient. He coaxed the story out of Harry, bit by bit, even the parts that made him feel closed up inside.
“Hey, Luna.” She looked at him without the slightest hint of surprise, as if she’d been expecting him. “Thanks for your help, it’s much easier to get things done like this, in a quiet staging area. Rather than trying to figure it out on the ground.” He looked more closely at what she was doing, and was intrigued to see that she was carefully Transfiguring the robe beneath her hands, into a thick black coat. It looked very warm.
Harry was up on his feet before he had completely thought things through. “Hermione, I have to go see him. Maybe I can find out something. If his mother will let me.”
Draco ran his hands up and down Harry’s arms, soothing him with shushing noises. “Harry, Harry – look at me.” He waited until a hint of green peeped through Harry’s fingers. “We did fine, and we’re going to do fine all the way through this weekend. Everyone loves you, they’ll be eating out of your hand before you know it.”
When he saw Harry, Draco’s face transformed, blushing ever so slightly pink and looking off to the side almost immediately after they made eye contact. He motioned to the nurse in the room to leave, and asked Harry to close the door behind him, still not looking at him directly. Harry felt out of place, especially after being scrutinized by the many nurses that zipped about the ward.
“It doesn’t matter. You’re a Gryffindor, remember? Courage before cunning, and all that?” Draco felt himself lapsing into flippancy, one of his many nervous habits, and tried again. “I know I’ve been leery of sharing anything about us with people outside of your trusted inner circle, but lately I’ve been thinking that a public coming-out might be just the thing to corner my mother into accepting it.”
Draco felt an eerie sense of déjà vu at her choice of words, and shivered. It wasn’t until much later in the conversation that he realized why they had resonated with him. They were an echo of the words in his dream, when he had first met his Patronus.
When he opened the door, Hermione came barreling through, lugging what looked like a fat briefcase. “I’m sorry it took so long, I couldn’t remember exactly what your place looked like and didn’t want to risk Splinching myself, so I Apparated a few blocks away.” She paused to take a breath and scanned him anxiously. “Oh Harry, look at you. Let me see how bad it is, let me see.”
Draco finished draining his glass, then turned a languid eye on Harry. “Believe me, I don’t mind it a little rough. I am a little surprised though, I thought you’d be a tame little cub in bed.” He adjusted his pillow and shifted closer to Harry. “Instead, I got a full-grown lion.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed, and Harry could practically see the gears turning in his mind. Before Draco could go any further down that road of speculation, he filled him in on the Splinching accident and jumped in with some questions of his own.
The stranger smiled at him with a little too much understanding, and Harry was at a loss for what to say that might keep his dignity intact. “Aren’t you the cutest. Got a name?”
Draco was, to put it mildly, out of his element. What had he been thinking, climbing onto a roof and getting onto a broom with Harry, let alone Apparating with him? Who did he think he was, going along with this hare-brained Gryffindor scheme?
. Fiercely, he pushed them to the back of his mind and leaned toward Brandon, who was growing a little ruddy around the cheeks. If this wasn’t a perfect opportunity to forget about his problems with Draco, he didn’t know what was.
He needn’t have worried, as Draco took one of his arms and leaned in to give him a quick kiss on the cheek. He seemed to instinctively know that Harry might not be ready for anything public just yet. Harry wondered if he had gained some experience in discretion through his string of Muggle lovers.
The invitation was unmistakable. Even with their last encounter just hours before, Harry could feel the stir of erotic energy awakening within him once more. He wanted to do things that would erase the memory of Nigel and Draco together, and he wanted to do them immediately.
The gesture did little to disrupt the tension in the room, but at least it broke the staring contest that had been building up between Draco and Ron. Ron helped Hermione with bringing out glasses and bottles of various amber liquids, and Draco was relieved to see that several passable varieties of Scotch were represented. He accepted the offer of a Glenfidditch, while Harry declined in favor of sparkling water, and soon all of them were sipping in a concerted effort to mellow out their nerves.
Harry thought to himself wryly. What Hermione had to share was interesting though, he had to admit. Draco had been studying intensively the history of Muggle-Wizard relations, specifically around healing magic, and had come across some precedents of collaboration between Muggle healers and the Wizarding medical community. “Some of it was accidental,” Hermione explained, “an offshoot of alchemical experiments. But some of it was quite deliberate. I think it could be useful for brainstorming ways to build bridges with the modern Muggle community, although obviously quite a few things have changed, with the development of science.”
His robe had slipped to one side and he could feel Harry’s eyes grazing over him in a not disinterested way, but the moment passed quickly. “Transformation? What are they going to do, turn us into hedgehogs?” Harry looked amused with a side of queasy. “Surely it won’t take that long.”
There were no objections, and it was not long before they sat down in the dining room across the hall and dug in. Harry thought of asking him about the record collection, but decided not to in case it brought up the subject of “picking up Muggles” again. Instead they ended up talking about fashion, and what had prompted Wizarding and Muggle fashion themes to diverge so widely over time. Harry was surprised to find that he was actually intrigued by the topic, although he had far less to offer in the way of conversation than the others did.
Resuming the session, the Chief Warlock began his direct questioning of Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, to what degree were your actions influenced by your recent association with Mr. Potter?”
The bell over the door tinkled as he entered, and Draco paused as he breathed in the comforting smell of polished leather and new paper. The bookshop was just posh enough that he could forgive the clientele for being mostly Muggle students, and he was relieved that it had not yet stooped to the level of a Starbucks or other bookshop-café hopefuls that attracted mobs of the caffeine-addled. Give him a good cup of tea anytime, without the fuss of a barista making fancy patterns in his milk.
Draco couldn’t tell who was more shocked, him or Harry. Their shock registered in different ways, however. Harry’s response was to the news about Cho, while Draco was more astounded to hear that Ginny dated women. The topic was still fresh on their minds as they prepared to head to Draco’s with the help of a fresh Portkey.
Draco was aghast to see that tears had started to spill from Harry’s eyes. Because it was Harry, he willed himself not to back away or make overly light of the situation, even if he wasn’t entirely in the wrong. “Harry…” he stretched out a hand… “I’m sorry.”
Harry’s answer brought everyone up short. “I don’t expect you to understand, any more than you understand my desire to step away from being a Wizard. All I ask is that you respect my choices, and that you respect Draco as one of them. Besides, you’ll see that he’s changed, if you just give him a chance.” He smiled into his glass. “He’s a downright fluffy kitten compared to the Malfoy we all knew from Hogwarts.”
He didn’t realize that he’d drifted out of consciousness until he heard a commotion in the living room. It sounded like someone was trying to kick the door in, which was quickly interrupted by some shouts and a loud bang followed by a whooshing sound. Groggily, Harry propped himself up by one arm and made his way off the bed, across the bedroom, and to the door. The sight that greeted him was more dissonant than he could have imagined, and he stared for a few moments, trying to reconcile the two parts of his world that had just collided.
Harry swallowed. “Okay, I can do that. Is it all right if I call you Draco? I should have asked before.”
“How are you holding up, Malfoy?” He noticed Harry’s slip back into his surname and felt almost affectionate toward their old rivalry. Really, he must be getting sentimental, if one flight could bring up such a range of feeling.
“I’m glad you and Ginny are starting to get along,” Harry declared, placing one arm behind Draco along the back of the seat. “Although I feel like you’re speaking another language sometimes.” He buried his nose in the hair at the back of Draco’s neck and breathed deeply of his scent. “You must think I’m a total dunce when it comes to fashion.”
“So, Harry,” she piped up, when the awkwardness had subsided from the air a little. “How did you and Draco run into each other, anyway?”
She hesitated, but once she recognized who he was, she informed him that he was still upstairs with his family. By family, Harry took it to mean Narcissa, who was not banned from entering the Ministry as Lucius had been after the Battle of Hogwarts. “Which floor?”
The kisses moved on, from nipples to solar plexus down to the crest of his hipbones and the space below his navel, all while working his fingers on Harry both front and back. Harry had entered into a space of absolute bliss, all but forgetting that he was blindfolded as he coasted the waves that Draco brought forth with hands and mouth. The climax was upon him before he knew it, thundering through his body like a captive creature released from its pen. Harry cried out from it, his body bucking a little in Draco’s grasp.
“I dunno, seems like a few things might have changed tonight.” Harry felt himself blushing a little after he said it, which turned to a lot when Draco stepped closer in to adjust his scarf for him.
. Harry couldn’t decide whether he was more pleased or mystified by it, as most of what they said was gobbledegook to him. Confronted with a multitude of gowns to choose from, Draco urged Ginny to “try the Givenchy, I think it will look darling on you.”
“I can still brew you a tisane if you like.” Draco’s eyes were uncommonly close to blue at that moment, and Harry thought he could detect a hint of anxiety in them. “I don’t think you’re in danger of concussion, but considering that you haven’t been drinking in a while and did suffer a head injury, I’m sure some lavender and chamomile would be just as soothing.”
“It’s because of the money, isn’t it.” Harry was breathing quickly, and he ran one hand fiercely over his lips as if to wipe away the memory of their last moment of intimacy. “You can’t stand the thought of being cut off, even if it costs you your life. Your soul.”
“What can I say, I’m the gayest gay that ever – “ Draco’s line was interrupted by a knocking at Harry’s door, and he groaned. “Ye gads, Potter. When did your flat turn into bloody Charing Cross Station?”
They ended up on the couch this time, and Harry surprised Draco by asking if he could bottom. “I want to see what it feels like for you.”
He swallowed and looked back down at the book in his hand, and Draco took a step forward to look. The page it was opened to had a full-length drawing of Potter on a broomstick, dressed in Quidditch robes. The likeness was close enough, but Draco doubted that any of the customers who came through a shop with a name like Bedknobs and Broomsticks Book Emporium would be likely to believe they were the same person.
Harry looked at him in puzzlement, then gasped as the memories came flooding back. “Oh Godric.” He had forgotten the change of wands that had happened during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, when Draco was still loyal to the Dark Lord. “That was stupid of me, what was I thinking?”
“Hold still, I’m going to put something on your back.” The something turned out to be a cool liquid sensation of dripping – no, painting – across his shoulderblades. What was Draco doing? “I’m writing some runes in oil, runes of protection from disease and pain. And maybe some aphrodisiacs as well.” Draco’s voice had a husky edge to it, and Harry shivered in anticipation.
“What did you tell Ron about last night?” he asked her first thing, when she Apparated to his doorway, neatly dressed in Muggle clothing.
“Seriously? What kind of a discount is going to make any difference with seven thousand pounds? What does that even translate to in Galleons?”
“Right.” Harry’s nostrils flared a little, the way they did sometimes when he was royally cheesed off about something. “Just like buying that dress for Ginny didn’t really mean anything.”
The flight was marvelous, even more so than circling Friendship Lake. Harry took them on a slow winding route along the Thames, looping around to look closer at places of particular visual interest. He even swooped in to inspect one of the capsules of the Millennium Wheel, which had gone dark in the early hours of morning. “Did you know that there’s no capsule number thirteen?” Draco informed him. “And that each capsule represents a different borough of the city?”
What felt like hours later, Harry heard the door open and looked up from where he was dozing on the couch, adjacent to Ginny and Feruza, who had fallen asleep. His glasses were removed, having given him a headache earlier from their unfamiliar contours, and it took him a moment before he could identify the visitors. It was Hermione, still dressed in fancy robes, and someone he didn’t recognize.
It’s turning out to be a looooong day for Draco and Harry. More explicit sexual activity, and an important conversation between Harry and Hermione, take place.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, I’m all right.” The lie came easily, and he actually believed himself once he said it. “No harm in having one yourself though, it’s been a hell of a week.”
Their plan was foiled by Ginny, who had reappeared at their side, this time on the arm of a towering and muscular young woman who ignored Draco and introduced herself to Harry. “It’s Feruza,” she stated, holding out a hand to shake. “I understand you and Ginny were once an item?”
Pansy’s smile was as wide and wicked as ever, although there was a bit of sadness there now too. “That’s simplifying it a bit, but yes. It wasn’t just the cult of Voldemort either, Dumbledore had the makings of a cult leader too.” She sipped from a champagne flute and continued. “I don’t know if you’ve talked much to Potter or his friends at all since the War, but I’m sure they were just as traumatized in their own way, even if they ended up on the winning side.” She sipped again and crossed her arms. “Still doesn’t mean I don’t want to punch the lot of them when I see their arrogant faces. Potter was the worst, poncing around with his intractable impulse to do good, not to mention those glasses and that bloody scar. Hasn’t he ever heard of corrective spells?”
Harry held up his hands in weary surrender. “Do what you have to do, Lovegood. Just make sure we have a team in place before the end of the night. We need to keep Ginny out of harm’s way.”
Harry’s mind was too far gone on its substance-induced journey to produce more than a light buzz of panic in his body. He wanted to fixate on the sight of Draco, who looked delectable and most definitely available in that moment. Ignoring Feruza’s presence, he stepped into Draco’s arms and landed a sloppy kiss on his ear, sighing as he did so.
Harry flinched at the mention of tourists, thinking of the pleasant American student he’d met and lusted after. “Yeah, well, this one happened to be gay-friendly. Lucky me.”
Harry’s heart fluttered in his chest, and he allowed himself to play along. “Why Draco, whatever is the matter?”
“Don’t rub it in, Hermione.” The pain was making Harry feel terse, and his words came out more sharply than he intended. “Sorry, I’m just having a hard time focusing on anything but how to find my damn ear.”
. The build-up to the first penetration was the biggest challenge for Draco, who felt like he might come at any moment from watching Harry react to the tantalizing encroachment of fingers and tongue. He seemed lost in his own world by then, stroking away as Draco hitched up Harry’s legs and hooked them over either shoulder. Draco wanted to be fully present for him as they went through this new experience together, whether it landed perfectly or not, and he only began to thrust in earnest once it became clear that Harry was enjoying himself, his eyes mossy green and half-lidded with desire. He tried to draw it out as much as possible for Harry’s benefit, but it felt like no time at all before they were both roaring in climax.
She flinched a little at the news, but took it surprisingly in stride, considering Hermione’s reaction. “For fuck’s sake, Harry, I don’t have time for your identity crisis right now. What about your ear, did he have something to do with that?” She pushed her way into the flat, removing an expensive-looking shearling coat as she did so.
the whole Wizarding world knows that I’m gay, and dating their hero, and studying Muggle customs. Any chance they might have at reintegrating, becomes much more difficult if they prove themselves to be just as bigoted and narrow-minded as before.”
Miffed, Draco did something he hadn’t done in a while and poured himself a drink, a proper G and T with a swirl of elderflower syrup. Feeling somewhat assuaged, he lounged in a chair in the den, picking idly at a bowl of pistachios and flipping through the latest issue of Têtu. One of the side effects of working at a Muggle bookshop, as part of his immersion program, was the gradual creep of Muggle books and publications into his home, and Têtu was at the top of his list of preferred bedtime reading, when he wasn’t studying various texts on alchemy, potions, and Muggle history.
