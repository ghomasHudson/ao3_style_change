"I don't know if you are aware of this Harry, but Death Eaters have been slipping out of sights of our Aurors."
Draco perused his fingers. "I guess, but you are going to tell me one of these days whose girlfriend you screwed."
"You are, you just have to say the password," The boy whispered with a cheeky grin which reminded him of himself when he was younger.
"I have divided you into pairs, and you will be working together to brew the Polyjuice Potion correctly, as it takes a good month to complete, I expect it to be perfect and ready in that time."
"Thank you," She said to the photographers and started to walk off. Draco followed after her, grabbing her wrist.
An amused smirk appeared on Draco's face once again. "Look, I am not the same guy I was two years ago; I was a prick. I was craving my father's approval."
"You can have mice when you get into my office or nothing at all," Harry said whispering in Parseltongue.
The trio got to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes early so they could pay and hide the fireworks as quickly as possible, Harry brought some more Peruvian instant darkness powder. Fred and George had called them through to the back to show them their new invention which they had been working on over the summer.
"Yeah, that always gets me far, doesn't it?" He said sarcastically. "Besides, he could still send off the photograph if we reported him."
Ernie was sitting happily next to Luna and Dean Thomas, who was a new couple, they had sat together in a Quidditch match and had apparently fallen in love, which seemed a bit far-fetched in Harry's opinion.
"No, I am saying that," Harry held his gaze not blinking but eyes red. "Ever since you have come back into my life you have been nothing but a distraction in my life; I was focused and hard working and on the right path."
"No," Draco growled, pushing her away from him. "You might as well just go to bed; nothing is happening tonight."
Although Draco knew they couldn't find the concealed room, he was still anxious and followed close behind them as they made their way to the east side of the Manor. It was a relatively quiet part of the Manor there were only a few rooms that occupied it, and storage room the house-elves would hide bottles of firewhisky.
"I have everything going for me. I love my job, I've got a creepy haunted house, I have a family who keeps me overfed, I have you and Teddy. What more could I possibly need?" Now with Teddy gone for almost four months, things would fall back into a routine of teaching, spending evenings at home, and weekends with friends. The summer had been busier than ever for him. With fall approaching, life would calm down.
"I can't wait for tomorrow!" Scorpius exclaimed as he snuggled into bed. Tomorrow would be the first day of 'real school'. He would see his friends and tell them all about his summer. He was looking forward to hearing about their adventures too. He beamed up at Draco. "I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight. This is all too much!"
Harry didn't mention that he thought it was weird that Draco had dropped in without warning. He went back to slicing mushrooms. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched Draco move over to the banquet table to the old gramophone that was playing an old Muggle record. Harry liked having music play in the background when he was doing chores. It was something to hum along to and it filled the silence of the house.  "You can turn it off," he told Draco.
Astoria scowled at Draco. "Shut up." She limped her way to the sink to toss in a dirty spoon. "Turns out I'm not so young anymore." She arched her back and moaned in pain. "Talk me out of those ridiculous soirees next time."
Harry occasionally watched Scorpius play. The boy was always alone. He didn't make friends well because he never smiled. He also never talked to his peers. If someone tried to play with him, he never pulled a tantrum. He would simply stand aside and let his classmate grab the toy right out of his hands. Gabrielle had tried instigating a few playgroups in an attempt to include all the shy children. Even so, Scorpius didn't seem to think much of all the cooking games and freeze tag attempts. He spent most of his playtime by himself.
Draco cast a cursory glance at the state of his home. "This is what happens when Stori finds her Christmas spirit. It's absolutely garish."
"No," Scorpius muttered. "I'll go with Nanna tomorrow." He got up from his chair and sidestepped Draco so he could walk out of the room, leaving his father feeling quite guilty.
"It is after lunch." Astoria flicked her wand at the presents to sweep them into the manor. Draco had to swiftly sidestep to move out of the way of the flying bags and boxes. "Is Scorpius inside?" She carefully walked up the icy stairs.
That's all Harry had to say to get a glimpse inside Draco's infamous wardrobe. His eyes were wide in awe at the rows of shirts, trousers, sweaters, robes, shelves full of shoes, scarves, jewelry, and it was all arranged with such precision and care that he didn't dare enter without permission. Draco pushed him into the room without fanfare, muttering, "It's not that bad."
Draco folded his arms and had a hand rested across his mouth to stifle a smirk, he squinted, and his eyes searched both Harry's.
"You seem much happier, a bit peaky, but I am sure once you have had a few of my Sunday lunches you will be back to normal."
Sweating and panting, Draco stared up at his father who was smirking slightly. "What are you doing standing over me?" Draco groaned and crooked his neck. His father never came into his room neither of his parents did; they had never needed to, as far as he was concerned they lived in two separate houses.
The Head Auror office was still when Harry had unlocked it; there was a sense of abandonment in the air, it felt familiar to him. There was a large desk in front of a tiled glass window that overlooked the Auror offices; he assumed it was a one-way window.  The desk had a little gold plaque with Harry Potter Head Auror engraved. There was a messy pile of papers on the desk which Draco would probably disapprove of.
Slumping into the chair, he let his mind wander again remembering the past few days and sitting in the kitchen the previous morning being cared for by Draco after his accident. He remembered the concern in his eyes as he saw him walk through the door all cut up and grazed.
Everyone looked Harry and then Lucius started laughing, which was very odd as Harry had never seen Lucius laugh so genuinely.
"And what is your involvement in this Mr Malfoy? As I recall you no longer work at the Ministry," Kingsley frowned.
The dining room was dimly lit and occupied by Draco's mother and father, Narcissa and Lucius. They sat talking in low voices not noticing that two people had just entered the room. Draco cleared his throat startling them both, and they quickly stood up waiting for them to sit down with them at the table. Lucius looking older with his normal white blonde hair in a ponytail smirked at him.
The blond left Harry’s ear, prompting another groan of disappointment. He lifted Harry’s head and began to nuzzle and nip the neck. “In due time.” He murmured against the smooth arch of his neck.
Draco smiled weakly moving in front of the bowl; he could see a kitchen way down below. He lowered his head inside, and the ground beneath his feet disappeared as he was sent spinning through deep dark nothingness and landing in the kitchen; he was in Ginny's kitchen.
"Is everything okay, Mr Potter?" Narcissa Malfoy asked, looking slightly concerned as Harry felt his cheeks redden.
"Yes, hello Harry, did you not get my note?" He asked, turning his head to look at the bed for the note. "I said I was coming to pick you up."
The door opened, and when he was expecting it to be Annabel, he was even more surprised to see Mr Weasley.
"One moment please," The Goblin began to step down from the desk and walked over to another Goblin and whispered to him before that Goblin walked away and headed to the offices in the back. The head Goblin returned to his desk and continued writing.
Draco wanted to so desperately to say no, he wanted to obliviate Harry and make him forget the whole thing, but he had to fight for Harry, it felt like all he ever did was fight for Harry to believe in him. He bowed his head and then slowly nodded. "Ok, I will show you."
It was a long while before Draco could move. He propped himself up on his elbows, easing his weight off the smaller man beneath him. “You ok?”
"I would like to request that Draco Malfoy returns to Hogwarts for his final year on strict probation, under the supervision of Headmistress McGonagall. She has promised to keep a personal eye on his grades, and she proposes he spend the remainder of the summer helping to rebuild the school in time for September," Harry continued, giving a pleading stare to the Wizengamot. "Draco Malfoy isn't evil; he is just a boy who didn't have the right influences, and was failed by everyone around him."
"Level two Department of Magical Law Enforcement," The woman in the lift spoke listing off all the departments.
Lucius Malfoy was definitely up to no good; Harry thought as he knocked on Robards door before entering.
The box stopped at the ground, and the Muggle was ready to pull the bar back and also holding his unicorn.
"Because there might not even be a wedding," Ginny replied standing up with tears welling in her eyes. "Isn't that right Harry?"
Draco rolled his eyes at him. "He always brings up the American wizards vocabulary whenever he gets drunk," Harry heard Draco mutter to him as they were resting against the bottom of the sofa which a sleepy Ginny was lying on.
Pansy and Blaise were the first to arrive, and Draco was already talking about wedding planning, Harry had to roll his eyes at him, he knew very well what Draco was like when he started being obsessive over something.
They were in Lucius's study the only place he finds peace nowadays after his wife decided to be friendly with all types of witches and had book clubs, cooking nights and some kind of get help group. The study always reminded Draco of when he was a child before Hogwarts; he would pretend to read books so he could listen in on his father's meetings, sometimes he just wanted to feel close to him.
Around Eleven o'clock the last of the partygoers were sat on the floor, and the furniture in the front room, some like Luna and the Patil twins were asleep in the corner. Fred and George had gone back to the Burrow as they had a big meeting in the morning at Gringotts. Hermione had gone back to hers without Ron much to her annoyance.
Draco stood up and out of sympathy wrapped his arm around the witch and let her sob into his shoulders. "Who else is here?" He asked her in a softer tone than before.
After a few moments of being unsure whether or not she should leave, Mrs Weasley said her goodbyes to Harry and Teddy and gave Draco a warning stare that meant, you mess this up and you will have me to deal with.
"Well, it wouldn't be happening if you had fashion sense or you came to work on time," Malfoy called back. "AHA," He emerged from the closet holding a light grey 3-piece suit with a salmon pink tie.
"Robards had the photo's of you and Harry kissing and said if he didn't end things with you, he would leak them to the prophet."
"You couldn't do nothing for the rest of your life, you will be bored out of your mind, and you know it."
"How do you think?" Harry replied, not calming down. "Robards has pictures of you taking it; it seems you had been followed for a while now."
“The teachers are aware of the ones who aren’t allowed to visit Hogsmeade, Mr Malfoy, and I suspect they are the ones who should be ensuring they don’t get into any more trouble. Does anyone else have questions?”
He slumped into his desk chair and leaned back as far as he could manage, closing his eyes for just a moment...
Harry felt weight leave his body as Draco stepped backwards, grey eyes inspecting him and biting his bottom lip.
"Wait." There was a desperation in Harry's voice that he'd never heard-- and he paused, as requested.
He looked back to the man who had his arm now across his chest, he was fast asleep again, with his lips curled up into a smile. His white blonde hair fell across his forehead in a sweaty mess. Then it hit him; he was sharing a tiny bed with Draco Malfoy, and they were-- he looked under the children's duvet and saw they were both in their boxers-- they were half-naked, sweaty and clammy together.
"Good idea Ron, Ginny and I will get the books; you three go to the Apothecary and get your potion ingredients, Ginny doesn't need any, anyway," Mrs Weasley said much to Ginny's annoyance. "We will meet up in twenty minutes at..."
Draco stood in front of the full-length mirror in his closet straightening his tie, stone-faced and preparing for the day. He smoothed out the sleeves of his navy blue jacket until there were no more visible creases. He threaded his fingers through his hair, keeping his fringe out of his eyes and took one last look at himself, exhaling and telling himself he was fine before leaving the closet and closing the door behind him.
"Must you slurp?" Malfoy said loudly leaning over Harry to Ernie. "You might as well lift the bowl and drink directly from it if you are going to slurp like that."
The Wednesday of the last week in August, Harry went with Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Mrs Weasley to Diagon Alley for their school supplies for the final time for all four of them. Whereas Hermione and Mrs Weasley wanted to savour every moment the others did not. Ginny and Ron had been bickering for the past few days, it turns out Ron hadn't completely gotten over the fact that he missed out on becoming Head Boy and Ginny would tease him at every opportunity, whether on purpose or accidentally was neither here nor there in Ron's mind. It also made it very uncomfortable for Harry as he had to put up with hearing the arguments and repeat that he is not going to get involved and pick who is right.
"I know Draco." His father said dully. "I don't suppose you have told Potter about your little collection?"
Suddenly he grasped his erection firmly and pumped hard once, twice. He gasped, hips lifting upwards in response. He drew up his legs, exposing himself to Draco’s view, as he caressed and gently squeezed his balls. He lazily, sensually sucked on his fingers in time with his strokes on his cock. All the while, his gaze never left Draco, keenly aware of the smouldering grey eyes watching his every move.
He was feeling a twitch in his trousers as the image of him, and Malfoy together took over his vision, he wanted to be wrapped around him on top of the bed and kiss him all over, run his hands through the blonde hair...
"Well I am no relationship expert, but they argue about the smallest things, they don't seem to want to be in the same room together, I saw her kiss him once, and he looked like he was in pain, but yet again that's his usual facial expression."
He shot up in his bed, grabbing his wand; he told Morty to see who it was. He realised it was probably a bad idea to send a snake to go snoop on an intruder.
"He said we have thirty minutes to decide who is going to be the one to tell everyone we are together, him or us," Harry said, running his hand through his hair.
"Well, we don't know if he is going to get his memory back or if we can get it back," Hermione replied.
There was a lot of daily prophet articles with heavy circles around specific quotes and information. He had noticed this too in the papers he had found in his hospital room. One of the pieces caught his attention.
"They are not my books," Harry cut her off irritated. "They are unofficially written." He must have had to say that so many times Draco thought.
Harry lifted up slightly and pulled off Draco's trousers and then got rid of his own. Both their cocks were hard for each other as he lowered back into the straddle.
Harry was curled on his side in their bed, sleeping in the nude. The messy brown of Harry’s hair was spread across the pillow in the late afternoon sun. One arm was curled under the pillow, the other curled about his waist. Only the flimsy white sheet dragged carelessly over his creamy thighs saved his modesty, except it clung low to the slender hips. One slim ankle rested in the open on top of the sheet.
"They are always arguing though," Ron continued. "I hate Tuesdays when she is there, that's the only thing I would say I feel sorry Malfoy about, he is bloody miserable in that relationship."
"Not at all, I just think it makes the day feel longer when I say morning," Draco replied with a smirk.
Even though Draco was used to seeing the pair of them making out, it was somehow shocking to him in this scenario. They both watched as they finally pulled apart and were both smiling and looking into each other's eyes. "Fucking Blaise," Draco spat angrily, wanting to run over to them and punch him in the face.
"Have I walked into the wrong house?" Lucius asked after a moment of everyone looking at each other. He didn't look like had just got out of Azkaban he was dressed how he usually had, his long hair was fastened in a ponytail.
They were somewhere above Manchester when Harry had caught up to him. "Not so bad for a child's broom, eh, Malfoy?"
Everyone stood up and rushed to the coloured pegs; Harry stood with four people behind the green peg. He recognised The Wasps Seeker, Jason Jones and felt immediately doomed; he was one of their best players, why was he trying out for Arrows. There was a tall, raven-haired witch stood next to him looking just as nervous as he felt, she seemed to be in her late 20's.
Draco snorted amused at the question. "Raise me correctly? Whatever you said went in this house, there was no room for my own thoughts on how I was being raised."
Harry now smiled at the letter in front of him, the words of Draco Malfoy perfectly written and wanting to meet him, wanting Harry.
"Look whether I am a loner is beside the point, this about two of my friends using people to play matchmaker, which didn't work, I probably will never have to see Malfoy ever again," Harry said trying to keep his emotions level.
Soon they both panted with the effort; both reached one hand out for support. Draco pushed back toward Harry, aching but wanting Harry further inside of him. His head hung down. Low enough, sometimes, that he would try to open his eyes to watch Harry’s hand around his cock. It was something, watching his dick disappear in and out of Harry’s hand, knowing that Harry’s cock was disappearing in and out of his ass.
It was lunch time by the time he had responded and sent off the letters, when a knock at the door sent a flutter to his stomach, expectingly, but then disappointed when it had only been another pile of letters that would have to wait until after lunch.
Since Ron had become a father he had been extremely overprotected about anyone looking after Rose, he went as far as taking extended paternity leave. He only let Harry and Draco babysit because it was their wedding anniversary and Hermione threatened to divorce him if he didn't let them.
Draco sighed and put the book flat on the desk. "It will need to be ready for tomorrow; you said you could do it."
“Hm.” Harry coyly crawled up to him, deliberately rubbing the jewelled leg up against Draco’s desire before straddling his thighs.
"A toast," Narcissa called raising her glass. "To a new family, which wouldn't be possible without Pansy and Blaise."
"Harry, Draco is your husband," Hermione looked at the confused Harry then looked at Draco sympathetically. "I was worried this would happen."
They went back on stage and toasted to their two best men, and everyone stood up and toasted to Harry and Draco.
The image of Draco kissing him popped into his head again as he showered and washed his hair, he felt the way Draco had gripped his hair and held his body close to his. He felt himself get hard and tried to make the image disappear, which was more difficult.
"I saw him on Thursday, he followed me into a little cafe up north," Harry said, remembering the lunch date he had with Draco and being kissed under the table.
"Yeah," Neville replied and kissed her cheek. He put his wand to his neck and cast sonorous to amplify his voice. "Hello everybody, If you haven't found what table you are on there is a chart by the doors, if you can kindly take your seats."
Draco wiped his mouth on a napkin, dropped it down on the table and stood up and scraping back his chair as he did.  "Goodbye Mother," He said, narrowing his eyes at his Father.
“Say please, first.” Draco grinned at the string of curses Harry hurled at him. Deliberately, he stroked Harry’s sweet spot once, prompting a loud cry of pleasure, and removed his fingers completely.
Blaise closed his eyes for a moment pursing his lips. "Okay, sign on the bottom line on this page," He pointed to a dotted line and turned the page. "And sign on this one up here."
Draco stepped back opening the door wider to let them walk inside. "Have a good look around Weasley; I am sure Robards is confident you will find something to incriminate me."
Draco grabbed each side of Harry's shirt tearing it open revealing his bare chest; his muscles tightened as he dragged his nails down as he kissed and bit his neck he could smell the summer fruit shower gel on his skin. Harry felt his cock harden against Draco's hard cock, he didn't just want it, he needed it.
“Don’t suppose you’d want to –” Draco gasped as Harry realigned his grip on his cock and rubbed lube over the head. “Want to do that now?”
Harry frowned and then slowly lifted himself off the ground. "I could get fired for this, or worse sent to Azkaban."
"Yeah, maybe you did," He replied quietly still looking at the floor then sighed. "I don't want to be a monster, Harry. I am not my father."
"Good," Harry said, and he yanked Draco against him into a kiss. Their teeth gnashed, and Draco's mouth parted in response to Harry's tongue. Harry’s mouth ripped at Draco’s, rough and demanding, teasing a moan out from somewhere in the region of Draco’s stomach before pulling away.
"If by good you mean poorly written, politically incorrect and trashy, then yes, you should have fun circling the shit out of it," Harry smirked which made Draco very pleased, he was so happy Harry understood his quirks.
She smiled and nodded in agreement, "Let's just hope your father takes your wedding announcement well or Harry will be leaving here in a coffin."
Draco watched Harry run his fingers through his hair anxiously; he noticed Harry did this a lot when he was in a difficult situation; Draco thought it was cute.
The stone in the kitchen was cold beneath his feet when he stepped inside to make himself a cup of tea. The sun was shining brightly through the slightly open curtains above the sink, which made him squint uncomfortably.
"Tell me what?" Lucius replied smirking, knowing very well what he was talking about. "Good afternoon, Mr Potter," he repeated and walked on like they hadn't just had a conversation.
"There's an idea," Draco replied sarcastically. "And tomorrow morning when the photographs are plastered all over the papers, we can just say, oh, he was just getting something off my mouth, with his own mouth."
"You know Robards was furious when he heard you had gone home early, on Friday right?" Ron said nudging Harry's arm.
"Well, you can fuck off, I am going back to sleep," Harry said, rolling over onto his side with his back to Draco.
"Come on Harry, he is getting away," Ron shouted as they ran through the woods chasing after Theodore Nott.
Harry hurried off down the corridors pausing when he got to his office, Annabel was sitting at her desk frowning at him, "Mr Weasley requires you in his office," she told him.
Madam Malkin walked round from behind the counter and walked around him to get a better look from all directions. "Hm, let's see." She took out her wand and flicked, measuring tape started flying here and there up against all parts of his body. "I think just a few adjustments should do it."
Harry cupped Draco's face in his broad hands for a long moment before letting his hands trail down the man's throat and shoulders.
Draco Malfoy had taken the route from the Slytherin common room in the dungeons to the seventh floor so often that year that he knew what corridors to hide down if he was about to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris. He had become more cautious since he had realised Potter was keeping an annoyingly close eye on him, so he decided that the middle of the night when everyone was sleeping would be the best time to work on fixing the vanishing cabinet.
I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunities that you have and will be happy to assist you in any way in the future if needed, but for now, I would like to be at home to start a family with Draco.
Harry looked at the Draco approved outfit that was hanging on the door to the bathroom. It was black tailored trousers with a dark emerald green shirt, with a matching tie and black suit jacket. Harry couldn't leave the house without Draco approving his outfits first. He always says 'You are not leaving our house with my wedding ring on, dressed like a squib.' Harry had given up arguing with him about it long ago.
A scrawny brown owl flew through the open kitchen window and dropped a copy of The Daily Prophet on the table. Harry stretched forward, moaning a little to grab the roll. Draco picked it up and passed it to him.
"We agreed, Harry," Draco said quietly, reminding him of the deal they made, that they were going to handle the situation in their own way.
"I'll go first," Draco muttered walking up to the doorway where Harry had stood since he had entered back into the room. "Harry James Potter, I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, Vow to you that I will take your feelings into consideration from now on, and I vow to be patient and listen to you and will stick by you through sickness and health through thick and thin I will love, honour and obey you till death do us part." Draco had hold of Harry's ring hand locked in with his ring hand and had been casting a spell with his wand.
"No, Rons right, we both got Harry into this mess we have to get him out," Draco announced. "Ron you take his wand and try to give it to him if you can."
“No, you dumb fuck—don’t move.” Draco tried to take deep breaths while Harry tried to stay still. Draco knew it was probably difficult; he could feel Harry throbbing just outside of him, but there was a cock impaling his ass.
"Why is this the first time I see you here?" Harry asked curiously as he just remembered he hadn't even known Malfoy had worked here until Ron had told him on Friday, but now in a mere three days, he was sharing a lift with him.
"You don't mind giving him his bottle, do you, Harry? I'm simply exhausted from all that walking," Andromeda said, opening one of the kitchen cupboards and pulling out a bottle of elf-made wine. "Would you like a glass Cissy?"
They were hovering high above the green mountains somewhere in the Lake district. As the sun rose, they bathed in the warmth hitting their skin. Draco stole a glance at Harry, who was looking at the distant glowing orange in awe; there was a gleam in his green eyes that he had been searching for, the life, the light.
"Hey," Harry hit his arm. "Well if I still had no memory you wouldn't be able to know what your anniversary present is."
"You can move your wand away now, Potter," Draco smirked, not at all threatened by Harry or his wand.
"I like to think so," He replied with a cheesy grin, and stepped closer to the door and was allowed access inside.
"Alright, everyone, dinner is ready," Mrs Weasley called placing a crockpot in the middle of the dining table.
"... I think if you are going to drink firewhisky, you should at least know the age of it," Blaise was saying in the background.
Draco sighed heavily and nodded. "I know, Potter, she was too young to die," He sobbed. "She told me she loved me, and she told me to go to you."
"Really guys?" Ron said unimpressed, and Draco had to agree with him as Harry wobbled unsteadily on his feet to grab the glass and to hold it with both hands.
A sign pointed toward the show tent where there would be clowns and freakishly flexible people dangling from the top of the tent and flying from bar to bar; he doubted he would enjoy that.  He saw Malfoy looking up at the tall rides, the one closest to them was the Ferris wheel, Harry had always loved going to the top of the Ferris wheel as it felt like he was hovering fifty feet high on his broomstick.  The tallest ride there was the high drop which would take you 80ft up in the air and vertically drop really quickly, Harry had never dared go on it, the thought of something going wrong had always scared him.
About half an hour had passed when he looked up from his desk and saw Ron Weasley at his door, arms folded and an eyebrow raised.
Draco felt a twitch in his trousers as Harry had brushed lightly passed him and his hand had knocked against his crotch, he squeezed his eyes shut stifling a groan.
Draco snapped out of his reverie and got out of bed taking his wand. "Lumos." He left the dorm, and there were already people outside the door.
"Good, I'm sorry," He began. "It's just 15 years is a long time to be celebrating; I just want it to be perfect." Draco held onto Harry's hand and squeezed it tightly. "When did we get so old?"
"Yes, I am firing you," other Harry confirmed he was smiling ear to ear but his voice was loud and harsh. "I want you to pack up your desk and be gone by the end of the day."
Harry unlocked his front door and stepped inside holding it open for him. "It's okay; you didn't know."
"Yes, he hasn't told me this, but I assume he thinks if your secret gets out then, it will ruin your life."
Harry stepped carefully over the threshold, and near his feet were about ten chocolate frog cards that looked like they had been thrown across the room, all with Albus Dumbledore’s face on them.
"Excellent, Peakes," Cotton shouted as a bludger came towards Harry and Jimmy dived and hit it with his club nearly knocking Simmons off his broom.
"Oh Harry, you obliviated your boss, it's not like you killed him," Draco shook his head, he finally had enough of the moaning and groaning. "Get up off the floor and help me find the tape; I have to be at Diagon Alley in thirty minutes."
Annabel was sat at her desk when he got there, and she was engrossed in today's Sunday Prophet.; only noticing him when he opened his door.
The Muggle waitress arrived next to them carrying a new mug of coffee, she smiled when she saw Harry, which immediately pissed Draco off, but then he realised she was just smiling cause he was good looking and not because of who he was. "Are you ready to order?" She asked, turning her attention away from Harry and back to Draco.
He stared at his father for a moment as if thinking what to reply but instead nodded and left the Manor.
Draco pushed the glass away from him, so it slid across the table and onto the floor making Harry flinch. "No, I want you to look me in the eye, and say it," Draco said feeling the heat on his cheeks, he needed to hear that Harry really wanted to end things with him. "Say it," He spat.
"Full English breakfast, you look like you could do with one," Draco noted looking him up and down. "Rough night?"
"We weren't trying to set you up for a laugh, we were trying to make you as miserable as possible so that you would seek solace in each other," She smiled weakly.
"What was that about in Snape's class today?" Harry asked stepping away slightly, killing the mood in the process.
"It doesn't matter," Draco said not wanting to explain the whole story about how some people can see Thestrals and most can't, the boy was only about six or seven. "Give me another clue."
Ron's support cheered as he took out another of Blaise's glasses and the old chanting of Weasley is our king with modified lyrics had begun.
Draco backed away from his father towards the office door, shaking his head. "I am done; I don't care if you did it to protect your name when it's me that is walking around carrying the burden of your name." He opened the door and gave his father one last disgusted look before slamming the door behind him.
"What did you and Blaise get up to last night?" Harry asked, remembering Draco had left him in the evening to meet up with Blaise.
Draco drew his fingers from Harry and complied, slouching down in the hot seat and sliding his arse towards the edge, so his cock passed between Harry’s legs.
"I quit my job at the Ministry because it felt like a dementor was giving me the kiss every day, it was soul-sucking, and I don't live in my bedroom."
"Actually, I do, I got confirmation today that I will be a secretary for Mr H Potter." He looked anxiously away from Harry while he took in the new information.
"Last door on the right," Zabini said. "You might want to give it a minute, Goyle is in there, and he ate a lot at the feast."
"I can't believe someone has leaked it to the Prophet," Ginny yelled walking into the bedroom and chucking the newspaper next to Harry. "It was supposed to be a surprise."
Blaise sat down in the armchair opposite Draco. "I need a favour," Blaise said, not sounding like he was up for Draco's pleasantries. "A massive one."
"You can't just sell truth potion," Hermione gasped. "It could do a lot of damage in the wrong hands."
"Hiya, Harry," Fred and George said at the same time as they apparated into the kitchen making Mrs Weasley jump and scream.
"Good evening," She began and became stern once more. "Welcome back those who have returned this year and welcome first years who have just joined us. Those of you who have returned will have noticed a few changes, one of those is that there is an additional table, for the students who never finish their seventh year, or begin their seventh year due to being in hiding from He who must not be named."
"Crossword puzzle Draco? your deciding factor was a crossword puzzle?" Harry said angrily as he was being untied.
"And I keep telling Ronald," Hermione scowled. "That just because he has done it for years doesn't mean it's allowed."
"Well done, you have won, please choose any prize you want," The Muggle said in a flat and scripted tone with about as much enthusiasm as a Dementor.
Harry woke up to Draco still in his bed, early Saturday morning; his lips turned up to a satisfied smile as he settled back down and enjoyed the moment a little longer before he had to begin his day. Harry didn't have anything planned for today, so there wasn't a particular rush to get moving; besides it wasn't often he got to witness a sleeping Draco, it was peaceful.
"Fantastic, that's what I am talking about, we are going to win the cup this year," Blaise said, pumping his fist in the air.
He didn’t care, couldn’t care. Not right now.—He grabbed the man’s hand instead. He led the way to his bed, bypassing the pile of dirty clothes. And when they got there, he pushed Draco in front of him, let him stumble backwards unaccompanied onto his bed. He knelt at the foot of it, not bothering with the pleasantries of head teasing or mouth stretching.
Draco took a hand out of his pocket and ran it through his hair. "You do this whenever you're uncomfortable," He smirked.
"I still don't think it's a good idea," Mrs Weasley interrupted the exchange. "That Malfoy could be doing dodgy dealings and using the team as a front."
"You just stick your head in the bowl, and it will take you into the memory," Harry said stepping out the way.
"Worry not Draco; the cake is hidden behind the stage curtain, I didn't want it to get ruined, I could see that Weasley boy with the missing ear, eyeing it up." Her voice was calm which drove Draco crazy why was everyone always so fucking calm.
"I am sure some of the Ministry are curious to find out how a 21-year-old has managed to buy a whole Quidditch team."
After the trial ended and Harry, Hermione and Ron had returned to their temporary accommodation in Grimmauld Place, Harry received a visit from Minerva McGonagall.
Draco sighed and left the room; there was definitely something that he wouldn't tell him. He would have to ask Granger or Weasley.
"No," Harry yelled as Morty dropped himself to the ground. Harry tried to gather him up just as the liftgate opened and in stepped a white blonde male with a pointy face.
“At least now I know what to expect to in our dorm room this year,” Harry said, frowning at the untidiness.
"Maybe you should have talked to me then," Ginny said, calming down. "I will make this easier for you; I like someone else."
"I got a letter to say training was every day this week is that correct?" The beater Samuel Martin asked holding his hand slightly raised.
Harry shrieked. God! That felt so good, so sinfully good. Arms trembling too much to prop him up further, his upper torso slumped against the bed, which had the effect of hitching his hips up higher. He unconsciously splayed his legs wider, allowing Draco freer access. Harry clutched handfuls of the sheets, biting the cloth, as he felt a warm wet solid presence licking his pucker, drilling into him, stretching him.
He braced himself as best he could as he pushed back harder, faster. He forced Harry to the speed he needed and fucked himself like that. He fucked Harry like that.
He smirked and nodded. "See you soon little man," He said, bending over and kissing Teddy on the cheek. "Right well I better go find Blaise and Theo before they let anyone into our compartment."
Harry's kiss was soundless and thorough, his tongue warm and oddly calming. Draco felt his own dick go hard as Harry's swelled against his groin.
Lucius, however, was acting perfectly calm and not even seeming present at the table, he had his head covered with the daily prophet. There had been no mention of either him or Draco on the front cover which was a relief.
Harry smiled slightly as he wasn't used to seeing a nervous Malfoy, and he did want to support his team, on the other hand, he didn't think it would be good to skip out on work, he had responsibilities, it would be reckless to just leave with him. "We can come back earlier tomorrow?"
He took out two mice and put one on the bed for Morty who sprang for it and ate it in one satisfying go; he took out the second one looking warningly at him, he held it over the bedside table next to his clock. "Later, okay?"
"What Ginny is trying to say is you are both kind of loners, and we thought we could help you out," Blaise said bluntly.
"Fine, but you are missing out on all of this," she moved her hands down the sides of the curves of her body, but he wasn't looking he had turned his back to her and was looking over the bridge towards the forbidden forest.
Harry smiled at him. "If I didn't know any better I would say you just want to spend more time with me," He teased.
He picked it up off the hanger and held it up to himself and looked in the mirror, it wasn't terrible he thought, but could he pull it off?
"It's true, he wasn't, but my father said he had been hearing things and wanted to find out," Draco replied taking Harry's hand. "Anyway, my father turned him down and has been receiving threats to get me thrown into Azkaban, all this stuff Robards has been doing to us has been to get back at my father."
Harry turned his head towards him, and his green eyes looked directly into his tears dripping down them. "You want me to say it?" Harry said greyly. "You want to hear me tell you what we did was wrong, and that I should never have snuck around with you?"
"HUFFLEPUFF," The Hat called, and that seemed to have broken their eye contact. They both glanced away and back at the stage.
Scorpius was the last one out, purposefully straggling so that no one else was around. Gabrielle was called away, so Harry was left to gift the final present. He smiled warmly as he handed Scorpius the red gift bag, saying, "Have a great holiday, Scorpius."
Teddy caught him looking and he smiled knowingly. "You're way too quiet, Scorpius," he remarked. "You should talk more."
Scorpius spotted his parents at that moment. His parents stood out from all the other parents in the room, the way they dressed and walked and talked. They were very beautiful. His mother wore a pretty green dress, her hair fell in curls down her shoulders. His father had a black suit on. None of the other dads wore suits. They weren't difficult to spot. He stifled his excited gasp just barely and a bright flush crept up his cheeks. He managed a smile when Astoria waved at him. He was really scared now. His mind was racing with worst-case scenarios. What if he forgot all the words? What if he started coughing? What if he sang so badly that everyone else stopped singing? He wiped his clammy hands on his pants. This wasn't fun at all. Why did he have to remember four songs? This wasn't fair! He was just a five-year-old boy! What if he became stupid all of a sudden?
Draco scowled at Harry as he gathered the bits of scrap paper left behind from Teddy and Scorpius' crafting session. "Don't be crass, Potter."
"I just think that if you're feeling bad or sad, you should tell someone instead of keeping it in. Sure, I cry when I'm sad. Besides, it's fun when everyone's being
Scorpius tsked at his mother, sad that his plan was thwarted. At least he managed to come away with one candy cane. "You and Teddy will come over for Christmas, won't you?"
Hugo giggled and hid his face against Hermione's neck, like he knew that he had done something mischievous.
Draco knocked his elbow against Harry's arm, which made it slip into the sink full of suds. Dishwater splashed upward in spectacular fashion as Harry sputtered in indignation, drenched, while Draco walked away muttering, "Frustrating," under his breath.
She wrinkled her nose. "Your funeral." She went back to rooting through her salad to find the strawberries. "How's it going with you and Malfoy anyway?"
Draco didn't voice his comments, but he really hoped Scorpius wouldn't carry that invitation in his head for too long. He knew that the Weasleys would be less than inclined to have a Malfoy in their home. They had been rather vocal about their stance on his family during the Death Eater trials after the war had ended. He doubted that their feelings had changed much even after all these years.
Draco was seated behind his writing desk, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off that headache he always seemed to get whenever Stori lectured him. "Don't be crude."
In the meantime, Harry had found his way to the wine rack that seemed to span the entirety of the cellar wall. "You could drown a fish in all this," he said, grabbing the neck of a bottle at random. "How about this one?" He shook it around, listening to the sloshing. "Sounds like a good wine."
"I did." Scorpius sat up as well and wiped the side of his mouth before smacking his tongue to the roof of his mouth.
The year-end pageant was nothing to laugh at. All the students converged in the main auditorium where seats were plush, stage was raised and curtains were made of regal purple velvet. To say Scorpius was nervous was an understatement.
favourite, okay?" he said in any case. He rubbed his itchy nose and dried his eyes as he turned around. He gasped when he nearly ran right into his father's legs. "Oh," he squeaked. "I-I-um…"
Harry was frustrated as he picked at the sling that held his arm tight. He was frustrated with having to explain himself. Frustrated at his friends for badgering him. Frustrated about last night at the manor. Frustrated with Draco. "It's harder on Scorpius if his face is plastered all over London's rag."
"The scene you've caused." For an unusual second, Astoria was at a loss for words as the enormity of the situation overwhelmed her. But only for a second. There wasn't much that could strike her speechless. "This is absolutely the most selfish and irresponsible thing you have done. Have you lost your mind?" She was standing in the middle of the library, her furious presence knocking Draco down a few pegs. "You dragged Scorpius into a world of ridicule. Was it everything you had imagined? Was a roll in the hay with Harry Potter worth dragging my son through this shit?"
Teddy was just about to lob a breakfast roll across the table when an owl swooped down and landed gracefully beside his plate. It tilted its head to the side and held out its leg. He undid the small letter after throwing his projectile, ducking just in time to miss one that came his way. He could guess at the handwriting even though he didn't read the contents of the letter. "Hey!" he exclaimed, grabbing the attention of the surrounding Hufflepuffs. "I've got a letter from my cousin!"
Draco didn't much care for the way Astoria was laughing. He sniffed in disdain. "It is only fair to Scorpius that we maintain a professional relationship."
"Of course, you will." Draco pulled Scorpius near. "I'm sure Teddy is looking forward to seeing you too." He nuzzled Scorpius. "Boy, is he going to love all the bad attitudes you picked up at school."
"Teddy gets a kick out of it." Ron wasn't exaggerating either. Teddy kept a shelf full of tabloids to show off to anyone who broached the subject of stardom. The boy thinks he's hot stuff.
"Don't ask me." Harry held his hands up in surrender. "He thinks he's some kind of a collector. Don't bother with it. It's a phase. And don't you dare show Scorp's letter to anyone."
She kicked the bag at him, hitting him in the shins. "Ow!" he snipped. "What did you pack in there? Bricks?"
Scorpius nodded solemnly. He took in Harry's incapacitated arm and bruised eye. He finally convinced himself that Harry was going to alright. "What happened at school today?"
Harry chuckled. "In an ideal world, sure." He returned to the topic at hand. "What you're saying is that you wouldn't tell Scorpius anything if you were seeing someone else."
After much coaxing, Draco sullenly followed his son, Teddy, and Harry through a busy and narrow cobblestone street. The magical shops were bursting with customers, no doubt hunting for last minute presents. He shoved his cold hands into his pockets and watched his feet as he walked on the slick sidewalk. He didn't much care to meet anyone's eye, a habit he had gotten into since after the war. It just wasn't worth the effort.
A short while later, Scorpius was sitting on the marble counter of his kitchen, his legs swinging under him, as he watched Harry mix honey and peanut butter in a bowl. He was making 'food that you play with'. Scorpius had been taught never to play with his food. Harry set the bowl beside the boy. "See? It's play dough," he said.
He gaped at the boy sitting up in bed. Crying like there was no tomorrow. His mouth wide open. His brows knit together. The teddy bear discarded and forgotten. Fists pressed against his eyes. Torrents of tears flowed freely down his chubby, red cheeks.
"Oh my God," Teddy squeaked. He raised horrified eyes at Harry and dramatically dropped the letter as though it had burned him. "Ew, ew, ew. I touched it."
Harry Potter, in all his glory, was pounding down their door, looking thoroughly displeased and determined.
That evening, the moment Draco had walked into the manor, Scorpius was racing towards him, nearly colliding with him. "Whoa." Draco held out a hand to stop him. "Where's the fire?"
Harry couldn't say no to Molly's concern. She always went out of her way for him. He truly appreciated her. "That would be lovely."
He huffed indignantly. Trust him to make a fool of himself in front of Malfoy. "Ha ha, laugh it up," he muttered under his breath.
Across the top ran a flashing red headline that read, 'A PICTURE PERFECT DAY FOR THE BOY-WHO-LIVED'.
"It was in the house, along with a few records. Found it in Sirius' room," Harry said. "I doubt his parents knew about it."
Draco had half a mind to join Scorpius in his sulking. Instead, he paid attention to the eggs sizzling in the pan. "He's busy. I'm sure he has a good reason to leave without saying goodbye." He scrambled the eggs with the wooden spoon rather forcefully, spraying splatters of egg white on the hob.
Scorpius shivered because he certainly did not like the spooky cellar. "Nope." He decided to help Theo with dessert instead.
Draco rested a hand against his stomach, quelling the butterflies, and leaned back against the counter. Let it happen. He pondered the thought. A day at a time, just let it happen. Isn't that what he had been doing all this while?
have a job," Theo added with an affected sniff. "I'm an investor. And if you're envious, just say so. You've been a bit prickly this evening. I can't imagine why." He tossed a loaded look Harry's way that Harry didn't see because he was busy loading his fork with Patty's famous lasagna. Draco did see and he kicked Theo under the table. Theo didn't give Draco the satisfaction of a reaction. Instead he asked Harry, "I hear you're something of an investor yourself, Harry. Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?"
"I'm really glad Harry came over today," Scorpius said before blowing bubbles away from the edge of the bathtub.
tradition where parents are encouraged to purchase extravagant costumes for their children, who are encouraged to knock at strangers' doors-"
Their light banter was interrupted by a loud and long knock on their door. In fact, the knocking didn't stop. It was steady and full of purpose. Draco and Scorpius were puzzled. Who could that be? They moved as one towards the kitchen window and craned their necks to peer at the front landing.
"Oh, well," Patricia giggled and waved a self-conscious hand at the little boy. "I'm a little too old for him. Besides, he would never notice someone like me."
"One final graham cracker." Teddy sandwiched the chocolate and marshmallow with a firm press. The marshmallow squished out, oozing over the edge of the cracker. "Down the hatch." He took a huge bite.
"That's right," Teddy said with a firm nod. "You have me. My grandmother is your grandmother's sister. So we're cousins, you see? You're part of my proper family. And you know what else?"
"You'll love this." Ginny rummaged through her open trunk and took out a deep mahogany box. She opened up the latch and pulled the lid off. Nestled inside the box atop red velvet was a round golden object, akin to a Snitch. However, this object also had ruby eyes, a thin, long beak and delicate platinum hooks at the bottom. Harry was dumbfounded as he pulled the figurine out of the box. "It's a Snidget imitation. Do you like it?"
In the basement, something had gone horribly wrong. This kitchen had a mind of its own to begin with. The house was so old. Cooking accidents aplenty. But why today of all days? Harry looked around him in dismay.
"No one knows because there's nothing to tell." Harry should have known there was no hiding anything from Ginny. She had always been quite perceptive when it came to him. He was also very glad for her at the moment. He pressed his hands to his flushed cheeks. "I'm very confused and there's nothing to tell."
The potions were really starting to kick in when Harry got to Malfoy Manor. He was finding it hard to walk straight as he began to move almost weightlessly. He hadn't talked much since they left the hospital. He was preoccupied with keeping his wits about him. He sat down as soon as he could to keep the world from swimming. "I think I'm going to be sick."
Astoria laughed again, surprised by Draco's candid comment. Instead of pressing further, she decided to enjoy her fantasy for a bit longer. She wrapped an arm around his elbow, snuggling up close to him as a cold breeze blew over them, and waved at Scorpius who was emphatically gesturing at the cotton candy vendor.
"I did." Scorpius looked down at his shoes. "I've been making my own lunches. Nanna got bread and strawberry jam from the grocers. I know you like sandwiches, so I thought you might like this one."
"Wait… Does he have a mother and father?" All this laughing from Theo and scowling from Draco confounded Scorpius. He wasn't sure now. Maybe Harry did have a mother and father.
"Yeah, right." Scorpius scoffed. Highly unlikely. "Do you think I'll get to see Teddy for Christmas?"
The next morning, Patricia and Draco were in the kitchen, the former preparing breakfast and lunch for the day while the latter sipped on his first cup of coffee. Upstairs they heard all sorts of commotion. Patricia had to stifle a laugh when she heard a third crash of what could only be drawers slamming shut. Draco rolled his eyes and said, "We already picked out his clothes last night. I don't know what to do with him." Patricia didn't bother stifling her laughter when she heard that.
Luna didn't seem the least bit impressed after Harry had finished speaking. That was partly due to the fact that she had been peering through a set of binoculars the entire time without comment, staring up at the trees for something Harry couldn't see or hear. He couldn't be entirely sure if she
Draco propped his elbow on the back of the couch and cocked his head, resting his fingers at his temple, making a show of thinking. "There isn't really much between you," he repeated deliberately. "What do you mean?"
"AH!" Teddy staggered back. The magazine dropped from his hands and fluttered to the ground dramatically. He pointed an accusatory finger at Harry and Draco. "Y-you-you-y-you-you-you're-you're
Theo was oblivious, or at least seemed oblivious, as he waited for Harry's response. "You don't have any plans tonight, do you?"
The teacher had been somewhat startled when he found out that Draco Malfoy's son was going to attend such a 'lowly' and unstructured school. He had thought that nothing but the best private tutors would be good enough for the young Malfoy prince. However, this boy was more of a mouse than a prince. He never spoke, always stared at his feet and mumbled his answers through barely parted lips. He looked like a Malfoy, but he acted like a Pettigrew.
"My precious boy's grown into a perfect Malfoy," Theo whooped. He tilted Scorpius' chin up and said, "Did you know your father also said the same thing to me when we were at Hogwarts? Not in your politically correct terms, of course. But you get the gist of it. You're going a long way, you little devil."
Teddy waited until Scorpius had to stop for air. He got up from his seat, placed both his hands on Scorpius' shoulders, and turned around to push Scorpius down onto the chair. He knelt in front of the young boy. "I'm sorry, Scorpius." He wiped Scorpius' tears away. "I didn't realize how much Harry meant to both of you. Or how much both of you mean to Harry. We've been talking a lot the past couple of days, since you sent that letter. He let me read it. He thinks it is the most lovely letter and painting anyone has ever sent him, ever. Mind you, he gets a lot of letters. He is very popular, you know? A lot of people love him. Out of
Draco's heart was suddenly racing as he blinked into the blindness. Before he could speak, he felt a hand on his arm and heard Harry say, "Does it matter?" The touch moved up, brushing against his shoulder and stopping at the crook of his neck. A disembodied caress. "I could be anyone right now, couldn't I?" Draco shut his eyes and drew a breath. The room smelt of old casks, faint rot, and damp stone. "You could be anyone." Or no one. The touch glided down his chest, over his stomach, and came to a rest at his thigh. He exhaled. "Man, woman. What's the difference?" The air was stifling now. "What does it matter?"
Scorpius giggled. In hindsight, that had been funny to see his teacher sitting on the ground with sauce all over him. "When will my father pick me up?"
Harry guffawed and elbowed Draco in the ribs. "Yeah, I see that." He began walking towards the sounds of excited unwrapping and gasps. "Did you get me a present?"
"Draco's told me." Astoria clasped her hands over Harry's. "I can't thank you enough. For everything. It has meant the world to Scorpius. He doesn't have anyone else."
"This idea is a good one, right?" Harry was pretty pleased with himself. "You worry too much. Before you start worrying, you should talk to me. I'll solve your problems like this." He snapped his fingers. "Teddy will be home for spring break. We're on it. You can count on us."
Draco still didn't lift his eyes, but the filet did topple over, crispy skin down, over the rice. Scorpius didn't reveal his sly smile. He knew exactly what he was doing. Just a bit more. "I practice on my own all the time, but my teacher says it helps to have someone listen. Then I won't get as nervous," he explained. "I want to be even better than I was as last year's pageant. This time Harry can't help me like he did last time. I'm 'lacking confidence', my teacher says-"
Scorpius couldn't either. He simply nodded and watched his feet as he scurried to keep up with Harry's strides. He was used to hurrying. His father
Draco gritted his teeth and winced. Everything in him had unsettled. He was glad when he got his wand back before he stepped out the building he loved to loath. Was this really any better than taking Veritaserum? He was beginning to wonder now.
Teddy decided it was time to change the subject to something entirely different. "Hey. Wanna see the new books I bought?" He extracted himself out of Harry's arms and skipped over to his messy table. He quickly found the books he had been meaning to show Harry since forever. He jumped into bed and scooted up against the headboard, pulling Harry with him until they were sitting side-by-side against the pillows. "It's got pictures of
Draco harrumphed and pulled the towel away from his son's wet hair. "What could you possibly want now, Scorpius?"
Teddy shifted into a defensive stance, his hands at his hips and feet planted squarely on the rug. "I thought you two weren't going out anymore," he retorted.
They reached the top of the hill. Draco arched his brows when he saw the fanfare down on the field. The large fairground was teeming, white tents scattered around banners, people strolling through well-trodden paths on the green grass, smell of sugar and grease wafting, mixed with the sounds of twanging guitars and drums that streamed from the speakers beside a makeshift stage where a band played old Blues music.
Harry consoled Scorpius as tears spilled over once again. He remembered crying like this when he was alone in the cupboard under the stairs. The walls were so thin that even the slightest sound would mean someone would be banging on his door, telling him to shut up. His stomach twisted when he remembered all those awful feelings he had in that house. He brushed Scorpius' hair, murmuring sympathetic words. This boy couldn't
"Leaving them where they are." Draco figured it was a sort of legacy to be passed down. Ancient knowledge that no one had read for generations. He tilted his head at Harry. "Why? Got your eye on some?"
Now he really did huff. "Well," he snapped, no longer bothering to stay polite. "I teach at this school. I am your son's teacher. Will you be able to come by soon?"
Draco tsked and bent down to pick up the pillowcase filled with candy. "I should go." He hefted the candy in his arms and started to close the door.
nervous too. Next time, all four of us can practice together. We'll try something different next time. There's always a next time, buddy. And you will get better and better."
"Now that's definitely a change from last year," Draco muttered. Last year, Scorpius had been a nervous wreck, about to start kindergarten, not wanting to leave his precious Nanna, crying into his pillow. This year, the boy was practically bouncing in anticipation. Draco had to talk him out of wearing his first-day-at-school clothes to bed.
Astoria had to snicker. Draco had meant that as if any other description of his son was out of the realm of possibility. Of course, he was popular. He's a Malfoy, after all. "Harry's a good friend, isn't he?"
"Mum and Dad weren't right," Scorpius figured with a sad shake of his head. "That's not good. I hope he marries someone right. Don't you?"
"Hey, buddy. How are you feeling?" he asked Scorpius, who was lying down on the small cot with his foot elevated by pillows. The nurse left them alone in the room.
Just as quickly, a flurry of answers followed. Conversations over dinner, meaningless tiffs, meaningful looks, hints he had somehow missed - like interlocked gears finally clicking and moving together.
Patricia had already put Scorpius down for the night by the time the two of them walked through the front door. She didn't ask for an explanation and Draco didn't offer any. She patted Draco's arm a couple of times and smiled at Harry before taking her leave. Draco sat in Scorpius' dark bedroom for a little while, watching his son sleep. Harry let them be and stayed downstairs to set the plates for their late dinner. They ate in relative silence. By the time ten struck, Draco was going through the motions of his nighttime routine and didn't look twice at Harry perched at the foot of his bed, watching him the whole time. Or maybe he felt better knowing he wasn't alone. Whatever the case, he eventually sat beside Harry and rocked backwards to fall onto the white duvet.
you, doesn't it? Nothing is ever your fault, is it? You are absolved from the mess because it's all his doing? Let others handle your shit for you, isn't that right?" She stormed forward and slammed her hands on the desk. "Grow the
"I thought you were pausing for effect." Harry looked over Draco's shoulder at Astoria to say, "Nice to see you again." Before Draco could snap, Harry evaded him by hopping down the stairs, his grin hidden.
"I just know. It's why you're always hiding it." Scorpius stared at the Dark Mark for a long while. Then he asked, "Are you a bad person?"
"What did he say?" Theo asked, feeling a conspiracy coming along as soon as Draco caught up to them with long, angry strides. "Did he say something awful?"
Draco didn't know how to respond to that. He averted his gaze instead and continued to drink the eggnog.
Draco brushed Scorpius' hair to the side. "I know this summer hasn't been easy. I don't like the way you shouted at me, but I understand what you were feeling. I understand that you were upset. So was I. We said hurtful words. I know you feel sorry. You know I'm sorry too. You didn't do anything wrong. You might feel like you did, but you didn't. You are right. I
"Because, because they're pretty," Scorpius announced. This was the first time Harry had heard the boy talk more than two sentences in one conversation. "And my mother's name is Astoria."
Teddy's impressions brought about roars of laughter once everyone was inside, trying to escape afternoon summer heat and humidity. Scorpius lounged on the rug, lulled into a sleepy stupor despite holding Hugo on his lap. The baby was half-asleep as well, leaning heavily against his new best friend and sucking his thumb. Scorpius held him tight, just like Hermione and Harry had showed him, but his eyes kept drooping. It was past time for his nap, after all. When two o'clock struck, he was out cold with his head nestled against Harry's lap and his arms hugging a small cushion close. Many of the other children were the same way. The adults had mismatched mugs in hand filled with lukewarm tea and were chatting. Harry absently patted Scorpius' arm while listening to George's retelling of the fiasco at his shop in Diagon Alley last weekend.
Before long, the two men were seated on the bench of a long banquet table in the middle of an enormous kitchen, mugs of steaming tea and plates of toast with eggs in front of them. Draco kept his eyes on his cup as he clutched it between his hands, letting the heat warm him. Breakfast was a quiet affair. It was also a hurried affair. Draco stopped eating as soon as he figured he had eaten enough to appease his host. Harry ate very quickly to make sure he was finished before Malfoy.
"It's not baseless accusations, Mr. Malfoy. We've taken statements from the witness that we believe to be true."
Harry knelt down to meet Scorpius' anxious eyes and flushed cheeks. "You'll do fine," he said reassuringly. "You look dapper, you know all the words to the song, your friends will be singing beside you and it's going be splendid." Scorpius could feel tears welling up in his eyes and he was mad at himself for being unable to stop it. Harry clutched Scorpius' hands to try to steady them. "What's the
he had said it, and wondering why he would say such a thing. Harry wasn't oblivious to the treatment of 'war criminals' around him. He knew how the Malfoys, Lestranges, and Carrows were treated these days. But for a five year old to say something like that was so unnerving.
At that moment, Draco was ready to say anything to get Harry off his case. Anything to go back to the way things were. "Yes." No sooner had he said it, he saw Harry's sharp green eyes darting over him, searching, seeing right through him. "Already forgotten."
He got up from his perch on the bench when Harry pulled on his coat and shouldered his messenger bag. "Ready to go?" Harry held out a hand. Scorpius took it without a word. Harry's hand was warm unlike his father's. It wasn't as soft as his father's either. He clutched it tight as they walked out of the school grounds and onto the street. Harry's house was close to school, so he didn't apparate. It was a nice day out, all the ice was melting from the pavement. Scorpius didn't like ice. He had slipped more than a handful of times already this winter season. It wasn't fun.
Scorpius clambered through the front door while frantically kicking off his boots and throwing his mittens on the ground. "Hi, Dad!" he shouted as he sprinted to the loo, zooming past Draco who was sitting at the dining table, writing up some court documents. It was February and Scorpius had absolutely insisted on flying. Both he and Harry were chilled to the bone. Harry tugged his scarf loose as he wandered into the dining room, the only room in the manor that was lit that evening.
Teddy glared at Draco. Draco glared right on back. They glared at each other for what seemed like an eternity to Scorpius.
"Wow, you're really busy. I don't know if I like weekends better than school," Scorpius said. "School's loads of fun. We learn many things and get smart. I am really good at reading now."
Draco tried to relax the fists he was making as he watched his son precariously perched on the broom with Potter walking beside him, leading him in a slow floating flight. He was imagining all the worst case scenarios, from a broken arm to a cracked skull. He was sitting under a large oak tree, trying to read his book while also not interfering. Harry and Scorpius had been at these flying lessons for the better part of an hour already. Draco was at his wit's end. He couldn't believe he had thought a broomstick was an appropriate present for a six-year-old boy. The kid had barely learned to run properly a year ago. He let out a sigh and tried to focus on the words on the page, realizing that he had read through three pages without really reading at all.
