‘I’ll have the elves make me something when I get back. What instructions? Who from?’
Draco paced around as time passed, he sat on the chair as time passed, he lay on the awful mattress and still time passed, and he even stared distastefully at the bucket but still time passed. It was only when the dismal looking meal arrived out of nowhere on the table did he start to truly wonder how long he would be there for.
Draco gets to grips with Harry's morning routine.
“Harry, what’s this weird red thing in the bathroom?” Draco called through to his husband, who was tidying their clothes away after the previous night.
This is a new fic, my first in a VERY long time (over a decade, wow!)
“I dare any person here,” Draco’s voice rose in volume again to quell the murmuring. “To challenge Baddock to a duel right now if they feel that he does not warrant his place on the list.” Draco had seen the younger boy fighting with a Ravenclaw, his power was extremely well developed for a mere 3rd year.
“How could you forsake all of us for him, Draco?” Nott’s arms were outstretched, clearly feeling that an older student should have been chosen over lowly Malcolm Baddock. “Have you no loyalty?”
In his pensive state, Harry hadn't grasped Draco's meaning. That was until he felt his husband slide into the bath behind him. Draco started to massage Harry's shoulders until he was moaning in pleasure.
Chapter 1 - 12th July
Both Snape’s and Dumbledore’s eyes were wide with fear. Wordlessly, Snape placed a finger to his mouth to indicate silence and then left the cell, closing the hidden door all the way but for a millimetre. Draco could hear muffled voices coming from the living room, two women perhaps, in addition to Snape. He crouched on the floor at the Headmaster’s feet, desperate to hear beyond. As the voices reached his ear it was all he could do not to gasp. His mother and aunt Bellatrix were barely twelve feet away from him with absolutely no idea he was there. He listened eagerly at the crack in the door as aunt Bellatrix grilled Snape on his allegiance to the Dark Lord, as he listened to Snape dismantling her arguments one at a time, he couldn’t help but smile in the darkness. Another gasp nearly escaped his lips as the occupants of the room turned to the ritual that he himself had just performed with Dumbledore. He could see the dancing red lights even through the tiny gap as Snape made his binding promise to Narcissa, Bellatrix cackling madly throughout. That noise always made Draco scared.
“And once again Draco, you are quite correct.” Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion. “No one really knows who the current Lord Black is as Sirius and Regulus are both dead.”
“Toujours Pur,” the answers coming quickly from the depths of his brain.
‘Well?’ his voice calm despite the thunderstorm raging around them. ‘What message does Lord Voldemort have for me, Draco?’
Draco Meets Mr. Smith’s Friends
Draco, not needing to be told twice, gathered his things and left the office, but instead of leaving, decided to secrete himself in a niche a little way down from the now ajar door. He was rewarded for his patience a few minutes later as McGonagall returned, leading Potter, Granger and the Weasel along the corridor with an older girl that Draco did not recognise towing along behind them.
“That is true Headmaster, but whilst Draco has clearly not yet mastered subtlety, he has managed to master Occlumency.” Draco blushed at the veiled rebuke from his godfather. But also recalled how easily Dumbledore had penetrated his mind previously.
‘May I offer my congratulations on your...’ Draco hesitated for a moment, ‘promotion.’ He offered his godfather a small bow.
Inside was a dark and gloomy hallway in the middle of which stood a dark and gloomy man wand raised warily.
“Harry, I love you with all my heart and this is just something I have to do. Initial officers’ training is only six months long. I’ll even be back before your birthday. I’ve got to go otherwise I’m going to be late.”
“Oh, god! You make a very good point.”
Harry suddenly went numb; he grabbed onto the door frame just to stop himself from falling over.
“It goes without saying,” Draco began, his slow calm voice clearly heard by all in the silent room. “That this Duelling Competition is an extraordinary opportunity and the house senior students have agreed to call a full house meeting. As ever, no words spoken here must reach the ears of any of the teachers or the other houses. You will be bound by these terms and suffer any breaches most severely. If you do not wish to be so bound, speak up now.” His cold grey eyes swept the room. No one ever spoke up.
The old man looked down upon the younger man, noticing with a grim pleasure the similarities to the meeting all those years ago.
“How about I take your mind off them?”
“Mmm. Isn’t that a little paedophilic?”
‘They are gone’ Snape stated simply as he drew the door back for them to exit the cell. Draco was only now becoming aware of just how much he had been sweating with nerves.
“Oh.” Harry was a touch dumbstruck. That was until he recovered his senses. “Ok then, why not?” With just a flick of his wand they were both naked and the two single beds had somehow merged into one. Both boys jumped on it and given that Draco had shagged his way around Slytherin and Harry was a pure-as-driven-snow virgin, Draco took the lead. Neither of the boys saw the eye section of the portrait in their room disappear to be replaced by a pair of twinkling blue eyes behind half moon glasses.
‘I am sorry, Draco.’ Dumbledore stared down looking kind-faced at the boy struggling to regain his footing.
Thanks to Tracy7307 for the beta.
A rustle of murmerings went up and down the Great Hall at these words.
He had risked everything to get away for this moment, sending the message was dangerous, if he'd been caught. He shuddered to think at what would happen. But by now he was skilled at occlumemcy; no one would be able to pull his true intentions from his mind; his barriers would hold them off.
At the height of summer, the days were sweltering but with the heat and humidity, storm clouds were brewing.
‘Help you? Why on Earth would I help a Death Eater?’ the voice was not dripping with spite as it could have been but Draco heard it nonetheless.

With virtually zero time to rest after two gruelling duels Snape called for the final to begin. Draco vs Blaise for the honour of representing Slytherin House in the final four. It was not kind, and at least for Blaise’s sake Draco didn’t draw it out for very long. Blaise was panting hard and sweating profusely as he bowed but less than a minute later lay sprawled on his back at Draco’s feet.
”. Nothing happened.
But when he turned around, no one was there and Harry was standing at his side.
Harry hears some news about Draco.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore beamed, his arms stretched wide in a welcoming gesture. “Now I believe I gave you your first instruction already. Would you kindly make this cushion fly?”
After the staff announcements, Draco grew bored again. He didn’t really want to hear anything about the Dark Lord and how the houses needed to unite with it being so dangerous all the time. He pulled his wand and levitated his dessert fork, crumbs of chocolate cake still clinging onto the shiny silver as he made it twirl around in midair. With a loud scraping noise that pulled Draco from his musings, the whole school arose as one and Draco realised that Dumbledore had regained his seat having dismissed them to bed. He chanced a glance over at the Gryffindor table and saw Potter still sitting there, staring daggers in his direction. He grinned maliciously and then started to tell Theo and Pansy all about the little incident on the train, with overblown mimed hand actions to accompany the story.
When Draco finally opened his eyes the whirling colours had stopped and he was in an unfamiliar room. Small, dark and dank, it reminded him a little of the dungeons at Hogwarts. With his head still spinning slightly he got up and started to pace around. Not that there was a lot of room to move; he could only take a handful of steps before having to turn and start again in a different direction. The room was pretty bare and had a small lumpy looking mattress along one wall, a tiny table and chair in one corner and a suspicious looking bucket in the other.
“Crabbe and Goyle, you next!” Snape thundered over the noise of the house. The two massively overweight boys lumbering up to stand in their positions on the platform. They bowed to one another but instead of rising up and casting spells, they charged, like a pair of bull elephants. The whole room winced with the noise of flesh on flesh as they collided and rather than using wands, four ham sized fists became the weapons of choice. Draco looked over at Snape who didn’t seem interested in putting a stop to proceedings so watched his two dorm-mates trying to pummel each other into submission. It went on for far too long in Draco’s opinion, by the end, Goyle had a cut above his eye and was bleeding heavily but Crabbe was the one who was finally knocked unconscious by a powerful right hook from his best friend. Goyle tried to get to his feet to celebrate but didn’t even have the energy for that. With the blood gushing down over his face he collapsed next to Crabbe, breathing hard.
“I tan perfectly well, thank you very much. Now where is that bell boy?” Draco searched round the Apparition point looking for someone to take his and Harry’s luggage, because despite the fact the walk was only two hundred yards, a Malfoy never carries his own luggage. “Ah, here he is.” A young man of about nineteen came bounding down the path from the hotel entrance. He was quite short but had plenty of muscle, and was only wearing cut-off jeans and some sandals.
“Professor Dumbledore is right,” Draco felt somewhat odd correcting Snape like this. “I was wrong, I need to learn to understand his orders better.”
“Harry, it cut me.”
“Don’t be daft, mate. Everyone lives in the House dormitories like every other year.”
Harry’s look of confusion had quickly turned into suppressed giggles as Draco had recounted his encounter with the odd men, until he could barely contain them by the end.
“But you signed up before we got together. I’m scared that I’m going to lose you.”
“...got Marmite on it,” Harry finished.
“As Dumbledore has seen fit to mess with our plan, we will have to follow a new path to glory. This one, is in fact, much more simple; there are only two rules.”
A whirl of memories flooded through Draco’s brain, not expecting the attack on his mind, he was not able to put up his usual shields. The surprise nature of it meant that he couldn’t even marshal his thoughts.Wild images flashed through his mind seemingly unconnected, his father, his mother, his first broomstick, his Hogwarts letter, Harry Potter, Quidditch matches, his dormitory, Severus, Harry Potter, Voldemort, Harry Potter. Dumbledore pressed harder into Draco’s mind searching through his memories trying to get to his true feelings. The memory of stomping on Harry Potter’s face was dragged forward, the feeling of horror at what he had done was being amplified by Dumbledore’s magical power. Draco felt the shame creeping up his neck, concerned at how awful he was feeling for what he had done to the other boy. Not just for the fact that the Unbreakable Vow might have killed him for it, but for the fact that he felt genuine remorse. Was that Dumbledore’s doing? Or was that how he genuinely felt deep down.
Dumbledore kept smiling broadly, it was starting to irritate Draco.
Betad by the wonderful Shadowsamurai
“Draco? Are you hungry? I can make you something if you like.” Harry curled up against his  boyfriend of 8 years. But instead of replying, Draco just took a slice of toast off Harry's plate.
Chapter 3 – 1st September
“Perhaps Severus. But we need to be careful that Voldemort does not read Draco’s mind and see him accepting orders from me.”
The two grunts of compliance were more than enough response.
Disclaimer: All the characters belong to J.K. Rowling. I just made up this plot. Anyway, I make no money from this so don't sue me.
“Yeah, why?”
Contemplating Bath Time
‘The Dark Lord has given me a task. I...’ his voice faltered, ‘I can’t do it. I won’t do it. I am not a killer. He has threatened my father but he’s safe for now in Azkaban although the Dark Lord will have him out of there soon enough. But he threatened my mother, he told me all of the horrible things that he’d do to her if I didn’t cooperate, what choice did I have?’ Snape rather thought that the boy looked utterly defeated. Gone was the arrogant swagger, the sneering voice that he would use on those he deemed to be “lesser beings”. Sat in the chair, blood red in contrast to his pale face, Snape could see Draco for what he really was, a very scared child.
“Malfoy and Harper, in position,” he bellowed from the raised platform on which the staff table stood, before settling himself in the large, ornately carved throne usually occupied by the Headmaster.
“I know we do this everyday,” Harry said between kisses, “but do you have to throw my breakfast all over the floor?” With a mischievous grin, Harry pounced on Draco, eager to get something else to eat for breakfast.
Later that evening, at the welcoming feast, Professor Dumbledore stood up to give his usual address.
His quill paused in the air over the parchment. Every good experiment needed some sort of control, where the outcome would be known. Severus had taught him that. But who to choose? There was no point in selecting himself, the goblins would simply toss a ridiculous request like that into the fire. He made up his mind, dipped his handsome eagle feather quill into his ink and returned to the parchment.
“Always Pure,” Draco smiled in return to Dumbledore beaming at him from across the vast wooden desk. He did always love giving the correct answers to questions even though he was often beaten to it by that mudblood Granger.
“Draco is new to your service and to your,” a slight cough. “Subtle ways. Perhaps in the future we need to be explicitly clear with instructions.”
“I...don’t know, Sir,” Draco said, uneasily.
Proof-reading help might be on its way soon. Bear with me and my awful punctuation and grammar until then!
“Well, I thought we could take this into the bedroom.”
The final scroll sent shivers down his spine:
It was going to happen that day, Draco’s first attempt. He was suddenly clammy and nervous, if he failed then the Dark Lord would be informed and be very angry at him. If he succeeded somehow, then a dangerous dark object would be taken out of circulation and destroyed by Dumbledore but still the Dark Lord would be angry at his failure to kill the old man.
There was a moment of silence before the four house tables erupted with noise. Friends up and down the Great Hall burst into discussion about Dumbledore’s announcement but having little wish to converse with Crabbe and Goyle, who were sat either side of him, Draco leaned back slightly and gazed around the cavernous room.
Draco’s hands shook as he slowly reached into his robes and pulled out his wand. He stared at it for a few moments before holding the tip and placing the handle in Dumbledore’s outstretched hand. With a loud crack that seemed to rend the sky, the old man vanished taking Draco’s wand with him. Scared and alone, the young man watched as a golden feather fell slowly to the ground from where Dumbledore departed. Hesitating for a fraction of a second he reached out a hand and let the feather come to rest in his palm. The second it touched his skin Draco felt that familiar tug around his navel and was pulled into the howl of wind and whirl of colour that could only be a Portkey.
Draco walked alongside the younger boy and whispered, “Don’t forget the arrangement otherwise my father will have words with yours.”
“Mister Malfoy, you came back. Good to see you again.” However, the boy's face fell when he laid eyes on Harry. “Oh. You brought a friend with you. I thought ... never mind.” Malfoy’s face had gone bright red, for it was known round the Auror office where they both worked that Draco Malfoy was gay and had somewhat of a flair for the exotic.
Chapter 5 - Late September
“Eurgh! Why didn't you warn me?” Draco's eyes shone as he stared at Harry.
The blonde receptionist offered up a weak smile before saying, “I’m terribly sorry, Mister Malfoy, but the Governor of the Bahamas is staying with us and requested your usual suite. I’m afraid we only have a double room left.”
Dumbledore smiled again.
“No, they were Mormons.”
“We must put our best duelists forward in order to beat all of the other houses and bring the cup, where it belongs, to Slytherin!” A number of the students cheered their support.
Draco has a run-in with some rather odd people.
‘I will,’ said Draco.
Sorry Isn’t So Hard, It’s Goodbyes That Are Difficult
Again another long wait, Covid and a new job getting in the way of me writing. Thanks to everyone who is still reading this, please do drop me a comment at the end to let me know if you like the way this is going.
At 6:30pm prompt, Draco knocked sharply on the door of the familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated.
“Whatever, it was just a hunch.”
Draco took great pleasure at seeing the colour rising on Nott’s face and how the boy was spluttering with rage as he stormed off to their dormitory without submitting his name. Draco waited a few minutes before following him, carrying the box of names under his arm. With a quick wave of his wand he randomised all of the names, and with another little flick, made sure that Pansy’s name was at the very top.
He felt the air ripple as he stepped through the wards which marked the outer boundary of the Burrow. Harry was safe and now he needed to make sure things stayed that way. Turning sharply on the spot, Dumbledore vanished into the darkness.
Other little bits and bobs of conversation drew the houses together more and more; common ground found between them created a bridge and strengthened newly-made ties between the houses.
Maybe everyone around them sees it before they do.
Or... Maybe they could be.
He went tumbling down the side of the hill, distantly noting that it was night here as the sky and the ground blurred together in an indistinguishable mess of muted colours and grass.
"Malfoy-"
Was that supposed to happen?
His back wasn't quite as bad as his front, but he still heard Potter make a soft noise of wounded astonishment as he turned. There were an additional thirteen scars there (to make a total of fifty), mostly on his left side, where the curse had hit hardest. Draco had found it easiest to deal with the incident by facing it analytically; he counted his scars, estimated their depth and how much blood he lost, estimated how long it would've taken to heal without magic (he would've died of blood loss first), etcetera. He felt that by detaching himself emotionally from the incident, he distanced himself mentally from it, too.
"Hey, Blaise," Draco said, "Have you done your shopping yet?"
"Thanks, you're a life-saver," Draco said. Jisky beamed. He left the Room with a smile, wondering how long it would take for the Stone to melt. In the meantime, doors swung open on either side of him, and students flooded into the halls. Mmm, lunch. Draco headed down to the Great Hall.

He took two clippings of Mandrake root, still alive and potted. To one of them, he added a few drops from one of his many batches of textbook-perfect Sleeping draughts; the other could wait a little.
Draco blinked. "A carrot?"
The presence at his back was gone.
Potter- who he'd let down earlier, and had since slept still and rigid- started frowning, mumbling, and twisting in his sleep; then he started kicking and flailing, and his mumbles turned into incoherent shouts; Draco scrambled away so as not to be hit. Potter jerked awake very suddenly, eyes flying open. He looked around wildly for a few moments before he spotted Draco. He squinted and, hesitantly, asked, "Malfoy?"
If there was a reason he was still alive- he was willing to wait for it.
Potter, who had previously been resting on the side of the bed, apparently asleep and with his face tucked away under his arms- what had
," he says in a drawl that should've been Draco's chance to put in a witty comment. He resorts to simply having a witty retort.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well, firstly, he is a potioneer, and wanted to-" he put on his best Snape imitation, slow drawl and all- "Watch us fail in such a high-risk project; secondly,
"Potter," Draco said, becoming dangerously suspicious of something. If what Potter was saying was true, he might've seen Draco brewing the Dreamless Sleep potions... And no one was supposed to know about those! He was keeping them a secret so that if they did end up working, he could have someone distribute them and people would actually drink the potions and stop their nightmares instead of being so distrustful of Draco they refused to drink the draughts. If Potter knew who made the potions, when they were done, he'd go and tell everyone, and all Draco's hard work would go to waste! "When, exactly, was this? And how did you get into my room? I put wards up. And I didn't see you."
Potter.
"What are you doing?!" Harry yelled over the wind; Draco's arms stayed tight around him, and Harry felt the pull of apparition.
in there! Let's go sleep in your room."
wanted to miss lessons. Then an idea crossed his mind. "Say, Malfoy," he began.
Harry looked down,
-friends- against him? How
It was brilliant!
Potter screws up his face, and looks like he's about to burst out with insults when Pansy- Oh, dear, sweet Pansy, Draco thinks- chimes in; "I told you neither of them would even notice us, Blaise, darling. You've known them for the larger part of a decade, and you tried to go against me in this? Pay up, pay up." She rounds the edge of the hospital bed Draco is occupying, shooting Draco a sugar-sweet smile. "And, my darling Draco, you owe me-" she glances at Blaise- "What was it? 40 galleons?"
"The first thing he did was perform Legilimency on me and told me to break out of it."
They returned to Hogsmeade and found Hermione telling Ronald and Blaise about an enchanted muggle object that had found its way into the window display of a shop; a "telee-fone", whatever that was. When the boys spotted Draco and Pansy, they immediately turned to them for refuge, and the group travelled towards the Three Broomsticks for lunch.
"What were you doing, then?"
That was
First of all, he was fully fed up of professing his love for Potter every time he wanted to enter the Slytherin Dungeons; second of all, he was fed up of sleeping in such an uncomfortable bed, with Potter; thirdly, he was absolutely fed up of Potter himself.
Draco looked away. "Least I could do." Then he decided that he had been kind enough to Potter to make up for all his previous years of terribleness and threw up his usual Malfoy aristocratism. "In any case, now you're awake, let's go trade the Stone."
Pansy started it as a game just for her, to try and entertain herself while letting Draco talk about what he wanted to- Potter. Blaise quickly caught on and joined in, and soon the rest of the Slytherins did, too. Occasionally, even Snape would give prompts on how to antagonise Draco into talking more whenever a group of Slytherins were getting close to beating the record.
, and for not just- not just
"It'd take too long to explain. Come on, Po- Harry. Please."
Potter looked at the portrait in disgust. He waved his wand and the blanket that had been covering it before flew up to conceal it once more.
of Sirius Black?- "He just comes strolling in," Potter had been in Grimmauld Place?! "Ruining our home, bewitching poor Regulus' house elf, continuing to let our home fall into ruin- disgraceful, honestly! Draco, dear, you're in his year, aren't you? Could you possibly hurt him- or just immobilise him? Just a little? Just a-
Draco frowned. That was cryptic. Well- he supposed he better start searching for- whatever he was searching for. He started on the fields- but couldn't resist seeing what was gold and what wasn't. He picked up a little golden stone- there must've been thousands of them scattered around- and bit it; sure enough, it was soft enough to leave impressions. Real gold, then. He picked up a fistful of grass, and bit that, too, wondering if the percentage of pure gold differed from item to item here, or if it was all 100%- then spat it out, spluttering. That wasn't gold. He glared sullenly at the grass blades now scattered around his feet.
Draco was terrified.
For as long as they could remember, Draco had always tried to hide secrets and cover up lies through distractions; whether it be distracting tales or physical motions, he'd try to draw your attention away from what he was trying to hide. "I was out in the forest and then down in the old potio- I mean-"
He purchased Hermione's quill and paperweight and dashed unseen into the only secondhand shop in Hogsmeade. He'd seen what he was looking for in here before, in a cluttered corner, tucked away, and- there! He grabbed the pensieve and bought it from the kind old man running the shop. He withdrew his memories of rehearsing and singing Weasley is Our King with the Slytherins, and the first time he'd managed to successfully conduct them through the whole song; he duplicated the memories and stored them in the pensieve. He flicked his wand and the pensieve was sent back to his dorm room, where he could cast all the spells needed to keep it in good condition properly. Then he left, returning to the Quills shop, where Ronald was just buying his quills.
"Oh, yeah- I used it last night, actually. I only had one nightmare, and I actually managed to sleep afterwards. Thanks."
over to his dear Potter so Pansy could eat her breakfast in peace. "But, really, I'm so much better than the Weaslette.
"Serpensortia!" he shouted. A snake shot out of the end of his wand.
Draco, meanwhile, was re-discovering Grimmauld Place- tentatively, slowly, being wary of the potentially dark artefacts that were surely scattered around the house. He went through the kitchen first, then the living room, the staircase, the bedrooms at the top. One seemed far too messy to be of the House of Black; it was full of scratch marks like the one that big brute Buckbeak had left on Draco's arm. Then again, Draco discovered a room full of pictures of someone who looked almost identical to Potter, only with brown eyes- James Potter, he supposed- and some others. The name plaque read, "
Now, that knowledge was paying off; as the leader of the pack advanced rapidly on the pair, it seemed to pause for a second, thrown off by Draco's repellent charms.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "You're not in classes, either, Potter."
Blaise (and, by extension, Pansy) continued to play and fuss over the little serpent, who quite seemed to be enjoying the attention. And while Potter had laughed a bit over Draco's palpable relief of having the snake away from him, he was now watching the group with wide interested eyes. Eventually, (and somewhat reluctantly, after years of experience), Draco turned to Narcissa, who was watching him steadily. Once she had his attention, she cleared her throat to say, "I must say, Draco, you haven't been quite this dramatic about Mr. Potter since- oh, maybe fourth year?" Draco got as close to glaring at his mother as ever he had done, while Blaise and Pansy- treacherous demons born of the deepest, worst places in Hell- simply looked on and snickered- "You climbed a tree to simply throw an insult at him and eat an apple. You got turned into- what was it, a ferret?- afterwards by that false Mad-eye Moody. You wouldn't stop complaining for weeks- as a matter of fact, I'm rather surprised you haven't said anything about Mr. Potter as of yet in my visit. I was unaware you refrained from complaining about these things; Merlin knows you complain enough in front of the rest of us- whilst in his presence- but," she said, glancing at Potter to scrutinise him for a few moments, "Oh, would you look at that. I think you're right. His eyes really are very pretty- you never could do them justice verbally, even with your eloquent language and style of speech. Although I did get rather a good idea from all the green eyes you doodled in your spare time-" Potter was staring at Draco, who had flushed a terribly uncomplimentary shade of fuschia during the short retelling of his childhood anecdotes- as Pansy and Blaise's barely-controlled giggling turned into a full-on laughing fit.
When Draco reached the front door, he hesitated before knocking. He turned, pursing his lips slightly; he hated asking for help, or admitting he didn't know something. That implied he had weaknesses, and Malfoys don't have weaknesses. "Potter, as we are in a memory, are we astral?"
, how in
And he'd recreated it all here, in the Room of Requirement.
And then Harry was yanked out of his train of thought by the realisation that, actually, they weren't.
Potter moved towards it.
Maybe they are there with each other, again; but maybe they help each other, rather than side against each other.
"About that," came a voice from behind Draco. Which was strange, because he was sat with his back to the wall, so whoever it was specifically didn't want Draco to know it was them. Unluckily for them, Draco knew their voice far, far too well for them to escape identification. And Draco suddenly understood why the hall had gone quiet. They all wanted to hear the exchange between the most prominent self-proclaimed arch-nemesi of the school. He turned around with a sigh.
Draco took a shard of the Mirror and ran towards the Room of Requirement. He'd taken a large shard, one that held the image of his and Harry's hands intertwined. It'd just been the most convenient to grab, that was all. It wasn't like Draco chose that piece specifically or anything. No, that would be ridiculous.
And decay.
"Wha- why did he want to watch?"
He huffed, scratching at it, and returned to his essay once more.
At the end of the corridor was a small stone opening.
Caused things like death.
He leant back, feeling the adrenaline pump through his body.
Harry, I'm not done yet. You stalked me for-)) honest man trying to ((-over a
He had been heartbroken to see- or, rather, hear- the cries of his friends- his family- when they saw him "dead". He had longed to comfort them, reassure them that he was fine, and that soon they would be too, that he would save them all; but he couldn't. He listened as Voldemort made his "I'm amazing and we won" monologue, silently scoffing in Hagrid's arms. And then. Oh, and then.
"What do you- what does that even mea-"
She looked truly surprised. "You didn't notice it wasn't green? Draco, you
The smaller Weaslette asked, "Where is he?"
Draco turned his head, very slowly, to look at Harry.
"I also think- um, I mean, you should keep your hair like that," Harry added. Draco thanked him again and made a mental note to throw out every jar of hair-gel he owned so he would never be tempted to gel his hair back again.
Why was the mirror showing him this? It was oddly similar to what he'd seen in that mirror-room, in the Golden place. Draco remembered his revelation from then. The mirror didn't show Harry. Well, it did, but it didn't show
"I've been trying for
Granger stepped forward, finally, and pulled back Weasley. The Weaslette had been detained by Lovegood, and was now eyeing Draco dangerously from the Gryffindor table, where Pansy and Blaise had seated themselves to wait for Draco to defuse the threats.
"So did nearly everyone who had such a big role during the war. I'd be more surprised if you slept peacefully." Draco froze like a deer in headlights. His body stiffened up, eyes wide, and he stopped moving entirely. "Oh, Merlin. Draco. What did you do?"
Firstly, he went around the clearing, casting protective, silencing and disillusionment charms. Then, he pointed his wand at the sky and said, "
DRACO NO I'M NOT READY IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE I SWEAR-)
As though to prove Draco's point, Weasley said, "As if, Malfoy! I'm not about to let you go off alone with my best friend-"
"Where?"
She was too far away to do anything to stop him... she watched helplessly as he hung off the window ledge with one hand, the other holding his wand. She paled as he looked down, carelessly, at the long, long fall he would have if he dropped.
Potter's eyes widened. "Oh,
"Well, your- your apple."
"Well, I, er, I have this invisibility cloak... I guess it protected me from the wards, too. I brushed past you at one point; you went and closed a window." Draco's eyes widened. Potter had seen him brewing the Dreamless Sleep! Oh, no, no, no,
Harry hadn't blocked Draco out of Grimmauld Place. Only people he thought would come knocking, and reporters. He hadn't expected Draco to show up on his doorstep one late October evening, half a year after the War, looking stern-faced and smug as always. From the moment Harry opened the door, he knew his life of solitude was over.
Harry had messed up.
"Well, McGonagall said she found Harry," Hermione said, "And she had ashes in her hair, but not on her clothes. So, she probably Floo called around until she found them. It took her half a hour, so it wouldn't be the first place you'd think Harry would go- like the Burrow, for example. So where would Harry go?"
, he added mentally, "And how it can help you.
Hermione's eyebrow's shot up. "You haven't even finished eating your dinner!" she exclaimed.

He glared at Harry, wrapped his arms around him, and kissed him.
Draco frowned, concentrating. He waved Blaise off in the direction of the door in dismissal, then scoured his memory for such a room. There weren't really any rooms near the library; Madam Pince hadn't wanted any noise near the room, and had insisted on one of the most isolated rooms in Hogwarts. Well, Draco supposed he could at least have a look around; but first he should probably apologise to McGonagall- wait!
Potter gave a rather Malfoy-esque sniff and said, "Don't get used to it. Go on, then."
"I'm waiting."
, but occasionally a different one entered the assault) at the Death Eaters. This was the Harry that all the tales spoke of; fearless, a strategist, surrounded by comrades; injured, bleeding, but refusing to back down. Risking his life for so many others. The Harry that faced Death, knowing he wouldn't come back, not expecting to; and yet, come back he did. The Boy Who Lived Twice. Yes, that is the saviour of the Wizarding World, killer of Voldemort.
, she was going to say. She knows about how Draco had to live with the madman for so long- knows the torment, the punishment he had to endure during that time.     She turns to Potter. "You didn't- Potter, do you have the snake on you? Right now?" Potter nods his affirmation, makes some weird motion with his mouth, too quiet for Draco to hear, and the snake crawls out of his hair and onto the bed. It's tongue flickers out of its mouth, its eyes blinking in the light. From behind Pansy, Draco observes it more calmly.
"What, scared you're gonna lose the bett, Zabini?"
The ceiling rippled, too, but Harry also saw fish- so well-painted he wondered momentarily if they were real. They swum across the ceiling, circling around and gliding out of sight. Harry watched them until his neck hurt from looking up.
After a minute or so of struggling, Draco was firmly seated; this time, he wrapped his arms around Harry's chest and up, so his hands clutched Harry's shoulders. His body pressed firmly against Harry's back, and Harry could tell he was secure.
"Oh, Draco dear. I haven't seen you in such a long time. How have you been? How's my Cissy?"
His Slytherin ambition would kill him someday.
"Malfoy," Potter said into the silence of the courtyard.
"In the potion, I think it acts as a healing ingredient to combat the deadly ingredients. So, since I'm making a potion of Dreamless sleep that isn't addictive-" Draco saw the Gryffindor portrait swinging open and nobody stepping outside; he remembered Potter telling him about his invisibility cloak. Oh well. Telling Granger meant Potter would find out one way or another, anyway. "I decided to take out the unicorn blood. That obviously killed the subject-"
Ooh, Draco liked this Flamel guy. He was a bargainer, huh? Well, Draco grew up a Slytherin with Pansy Parkinson. He could bargain.

Weasley struggled for a good minute before Draco said, "Oh, come
"So, Granger," he said, pulling her from her rant. "What do you- and you, Potter- know about Nicholas Flamel's healing stone?"

. . .
Harry reached out, enclosed Draco's hands in his, stopping his fidgeting. "Hey," he said, tilting Draco's chin up with the hand not linked to Draco's; when Draco's eyes met his, he smiled softly. "I forgave you for all of that a long time ago, Draco. And I have lots to be sorry for, too." The smile slipped off his face, replaced by a more serious expression. He didn't look away from Draco as he continued. "I'm sorry for judging you and hating you for only knowing one way of life; I'm sorry for never trying to see from your perspective, I'm sorry for never understanding that what you believed in was the only thing you knew.
"Hey!"
"The snow?"

This was the Malfoy Manor dungeons. He and Ron had been brought here while Bellatrix-
"It's called the Method of Loci. There are many ways it is learned and utilised; I'm going to teach you the way I learned it,"
This, of course, did absolutely nothing to help Ron. It'd been three and a half hours of no Harry at this point, and Hermione was starting to worry, too.
Draco poured the solution over his hand and Harry's.
"Yes, Malfoy. Hello. You know, you're worrying your friends, being down here all the time. Personally, I was worried you were turning into Snape," Harry replied. He consciously avoided thinking about the fact that he was worried about Malfoy's wellbeing and- what? No, he wasn't, where did that thought come from?
Draco pulled his Hail Mary. "Granger, don't you remember what I'm making?"
someone. Both are expected to grow up, to take the responsibilities of their leaders; to lead their allies against each other. It is an expectation that sits heavy on their shoulders. They're only children, after all, yet the weight of their worlds lie heavy on their shoulders.
"Oh my
"Yeah," Blaise said. "There's some sort of magic about Christmas, I swear. It's like this palpable excitement in the air that begins sometime in November and just hits you in December. Say, Draco, you're going home to the Manor this year, aren't you?"
McGonagall only realised the eighth years hadn't ever reached their beds when, come the next morning, she found them all asleep in the Hall (and others passed out in the halls of Hogwarts). She told them all off sternly and watched them doze off in her class with an exasperated (but undeniably fond) smile.
"But then he was actually
to tell Pansy, and she could help him name it. But- he was just so dizzy with happiness! He felt so, so, happy. He made his way down to the dungeons, grinning all the way.
He'd been lying to himself for far too long.
The two shot into the sky again; Harry urged the broom to go faster, faster,
It didn't explode. Thank Salazar.
Wait, what?
"Ready?" Harry asked Draco.
"...Not much."
"What, stalking him again?"
And then Harry was gone, and so was the pile of- whatever it was he'd been looking through. Draco jumped backwards, shocked, then ran over to where Harry had been; now there was a hole in the floor, leading straight down into pitch black darkness.
"Um, apologies, I suppose. I have already apologised to everyone else properly, but- there's just so much with you that I never wanted to approach the subject.
"I'm sorry I stalked you for all that time; I'm so, so sorry for these," he brushed his hand lightly down the front of Draco's shirt, where his faint scars from the Sectumsempra curse lay hidden; Draco startled, and Harry smiled sadly. "Yeah, I've seen. I am literally joined to you, Draco." His sad smile turned into a sad, hesitant expression. "I'm sorry for this, too," he said quietly, brushing the tips of his fingers over the top of where the Mark lay, dormant, on Draco's forearm.
"Oh. What are you doing?"
That night, Draco snuck down to the potions rooms again.
After a few minutes of Potter getting increasingly uncomfortable and Pansy getting more and more amiable with the Gryffindors, she spotted Draco. She said her goodbyes and made her way over to Draco.
"Uh oh indeed," Draco smirked as McGonagall used her wand to levitate an army of snowballs and send them hurtling at Sprout. A few hit Hagrid's cabin; he came out a moment later, and seeing what was happening, quickly joined in the fun.
"'S a good idea, actually," he said. "I heard Neville talking to Luna about how plants seem to develop a sort of personality, and the Mimbletonia also developed favouritism towards certain people. He sounded really fascinated."
The foolish witches and wizards who admired him and his neverending Gryffindor bravery never knew this, of course. They remained clueless, innocent. They continued to praise him. Even as he locked himself away from the world, speaking only occasionally with Kreacher, or writing for birthdays and other occasions. Apart from that, Harry Potter virtually disappeared. He blocked Grimmauld Place off from his friends, from those he'd learned to call his family; he received countless messages and gifts of thanks, which he burned. Why should he be thankful for the deaths of so many?
the map?! What else'll you use to stalk him?" Potter blushed; Draco watched on in slight amusement, slight pity as Granger continued to berate him. When she got close to revealing stuff she would, undoubtedly, later threaten Draco to forget or possibly end up obliviating from his memory, he butted in.
"Do me, 'Mione!" Rona called; she cast the spell on him and place him beside his imprint. "Why does yours look better than mine?" he asked Harry.
The house elf nodded.
Draco turned, very slowly to face Potter, McGonagall's words ringing in his head. Look like parents.
Uh oh. That didn't bode well for Draco.
The eighth-years emerged from the memory still giggling; Ron said "Thanks, mate, that's bloody
And they were hugging. No, not even that. They were- they were embracing each other. Ron's eyes widened, and he said, "What the bloody-" before Hermione cut him off, slapping her hand over his mouth.
"Right. Well- er-" And Potter proceeded to ask Draco what felt like a thousand questions, varying in topic and seriousness. Some were about his friends, some for his family; some were what-would-you-do-in-this-situation type questions; some were more personal, more about his thought processes and emotions. Some were about his qualities as a person; how he acted around people, how he talked to get what he wanted. Draco closed off on a couple, but had no problems with the rest, until- "What are your eating habits like?"
"M-Merry Christmas, Draco," Harry stuttered back, too surprised to comprehend what had happened.
"I- I-m not scared of you! You can't just go an- and show your- your mark off and expect people to just- just give you what you want! You won't hurt Harry Potter!" Draco half-recognised the small boy as Colin Creevey's little brother, was reminded of Dobby, and then was hit by what the boy said.
"Yes. I have. What do you want with him? And me, for that matter?"
But Draco hadn't looked back.
When Draco awakens, he is in a room that is
"...Right. And how do I know that you won't kill my plants? Even accidentally?"
it! Pansy never believed me, but I
Potter frowned. "Well, it's more like, when I touched him, he disintegrated. In any case, he died. Then the remnants of Voldemort's soul flew at me and I fainted and woke up in the hospital wing, and I think you know the story from there."
He hoped, perhaps foolishly, that it was a certain someone.
Draco remembered, with a jolt of fear, the winter of first year, when those Weasley twins had enchanted snowballs to repeatedly hit Quirrell in the back of the head- where Voldemort had been residing, apparently... and when Draco himself had joined in, seeing how much fun they were having. Whoops.
The astronomy tower itself was a struggle. The two just froze as soon as they reached the top of the staircase, looking at the place Dumbledore had fell. Potter- shoot, Harry- moved first.
he was in Draco's company.
Ginny, however, was very awake, sat talking with Luna in the corner of the common room. How she'd managed to sneak her girlfriend in-
Their reactions were immediate. Both boys reached for their wands, but while Harry slid quietly off the bed and readied his offensive stance, Draco started casting shield charms and silencing charms around his room. There was already a permanent silencing charm around it, but- well, what if it wore off at some point? Draco hadn't checked the spells of his room when he'd Apparated Harry here. He'd been a little
Harry, and those closest to him, probably came off the worst. Death Eaters knew them, targeted them. After all, one of the best ways to hurt Harry Potter is by hurting those he cares for. So they emerged with a large abundance of scars that would never fully heal, bones that wouldn't ever be as strong as they once were, and minds that were forever scarred. This just made it worse for Harry, because he blamed himself. After all, if those precious people weren't so precious to him, perhaps Ron wouldn't have broken both legs. Perhaps Neville wouldn't have been paralysed from the waist down. Perhaps Luna would be able to hold a wand in her right hand again. Perhaps the twins wouldn't have parted ways in the worst scenario possible.
Harry started peeling off the wrapping paper, then jumped back into Draco's chest, nearly knocking him over.
Ronald presents, since they were buying him things too. He managed to get Hermione a custom-made self-inking quill that would suggest phrases and other such improvements to her writing, and a paperweight of a small house-elf, which he had S.P.E.W carved into. He also had an idea for what to get Ron.
He sat down next to Pansy, who didn't even stop her conversation with Blaise to say hello. Rude.
- that would
Amidst all the noise and movement, Draco felt a hand reach out and take his.
, for Draco, and it's just not Potter. And Potter, who is currently choosing the worst moments to be deceptive and observant, lets a cool mask slide onto his face- when did he learn to do that?- and says, "
Granger proved very easy to wake up.
Draco was shaking his head before Potter even finished his sentence. "No, Potter. Go to McGonagall if you want confirmation I'm not trying to poison anyone, but I'm not answering that question. I can't afford to let any information out at all, especially not to people who would tell their friends who would tell the rest of the school. So no, I won't answer your question. Sorry." He stood, returned his chair to a leaf, and turned to leave. "Don't go jumping to conclusions, though. Really, you can ask McGonagall. I don't have some- some nefarious plan or anything, Potter." And with that, he turned and strode away from Potter without even a glance back.
Maybe the one who was helped sends the helper a little something to say thank you. Maybe it's an album of pictures found in an old room in the Malfoy/Black estate with a note that says,
"So, I'm not brilliant at potions or herbology-"
Draco decided he'd deal with the immediate threat first.
trusting you and for the
Potter immediately turned wary. "New location?"
The day of the incident, they had a cover teacher.
When Draco reached the bottom of the hill, Potter was halfway up the next one. When he reached the top, Potter was at the bottom. Draco looked around him; determining that Potter was, indeed, the only other person who could see Draco, he lay down hesitantly, and then lost control and went rolling down the hill. When he reached the bottom, he rolled a little up the next one. He stood up, but while rolling, his robes had tangles themselves. Above him, Potter snickered, watching Draco struggle with the expensive fabric that had knotted and twisted itself around him. He turned around, trying to see an end of the mess, but just fell over. Potter's snickers turned into snorts of laughter. Draco looked up from the floor at him, glaring, and he started wheezing.
The floor was a thick mauve carpet, and the fire was the only source of light. It bathed the room in a warm yellow glow. There was a window at the far end of the room- rather small and cosy, now Draco looked around, taking everything in- that showed the sky outside to be dark, but littered with stars. The moon wasn't visible from here, but Draco had the feeling that if he saw it, it would seem bright enough to replace the sun. Sheer white drapes billowed around the window; a warm breeze drifted in.
They opened with a creak; Draco shivered as he entered the room. The walls and floor were a rough grey stone, absorbing his heat and radiating coldness. The room was relatively plain; a single window was set into the back wall, letting a small square of weak winter sunlight into the dim room; other than that, the only noticeable decoration was- a mirror?
"Oh dear Merlin," Draco breathed.
". From what Draco could recall, he'd been somewhat of a disgrace; a male heir, sorted into Gryffindor, befriending blood traitors and muggleborns... Draco supposed this room was his personal rebellion to the Black name, in the family's own house.
Meanwhile, a dark head of hair popped out from under a scaly-feeling blanket of fabric. Harry waited a minute before following Malfoy back into the castle. His nerves were still high as a Hufflepuff after watching Malfoy drop all that way. He'd nearly had a heart attack- he had even thrown off the invisibility cloak for a short while in a burst of desperation to stop Malfoy from falling. He had saved Malfoy's life last year; that effort wasn't going to be put to waste now! That didn't fully explain the rush of- what was it,
time. He hasn't even practiced since Saturday! I bet he's rubbish."
Just a subtle bit of eyeliner on his lower and upper lids, paired with a light green eyeshadow. There was some sort of gloss- strawberry flavoured, he noted- on his lips, and the lightest dusting of blush on his cheeks.
? And Draco tried to ask him, but all that came out was a frightened little noise that seemed to confuse Potter because he always has been and always will be a thick-headed
"I thought so!" Draco raised an eyebrow. "...Sorry. Just recognised it, but wasn't sure I was right."
A few weeks had passed since the Drinking Incident (as it had been dubbed, and would be remembered from then onwards in Hogwarts History.) The Slytherins had been rather quiet- as quiet as Slytherins get, anyways.
"No, uh, Hermione, I think he's right."
Draco had awoken the next morning with Harry Potter curled up in his arms. He had panicked, remembering everything he had said the night before, and carefully extracted himself from Harry's arms. He'd flooed back to Hogwarts in a state of mild panic, ignorant of the disappointed stares of his friends- and Harry's- at the fact that he'd returned alone.
Draco was slowly turning pink from all the blood rushing to his head; "Do something!" he said.
"So, pretty much everything."
The view was simply spectacular, Draco noted absently; he could see Hogwarts in the distance, as well as the glint of the winter sun on the surface of the Black Lake. The Forbidden Forest was a dark spot beside it, and Hogsmeade sprawled out in a map beneath him.
"And?"
Draco couldn't say how long he and Potter stood there, warding off the wolves with as many spells as they could think of; they tried absolutely everything, from jinxes and inconveniencing charms to hexes and curses. Draco could tell that the wolves wouldn't be driven off; he and Potter would have to wait them out till sunrise, probably, unless Flamel came to help. Draco doubted he would.
"Er, you might want me to ask it in a bit more of a- secluded place." Draco raised an eyebrow and shot Pansy a glance. She was giving him the Look again. Oh, well. Better to get this over and done with; if he didn't do this now, Potter would track him down at some point and ask him then. Better do it on Draco's terms rather than Potter's.
"It's- it's fine, Harry. But- why Malfoy? Why now? Why do you need
Hermione looked around at the group, seeing their unwavering determination. "Alright, then," she sighed. "I suppose I'll come along so you idiots don't get yourselves trapped or lost or killed or expelled."
He resisted the urge to spit out the chunk he was chewing, and swallowed with distaste.
!" She screeched, pointing behind Draco.

"Yeah?"
Harry turned to look him straight in the eyes, and beamed.
Oh, bloody
Potter's face morphed into one of horror. "

Potter, who had been watching the conversation with a frown, spoke up. "Say, Mr. Flamel, when was the last time Dumbledore visited?"
He picked up his gold stirrer- the only pure-gold thing he owned, though he'd begged his father for a gold cauldron in First year. He shook off the memory as the moon rose directly overhead.
And he'd cried as Harry flew him away from Crabbe, flew him away from the room of leaping flames, the same colour as the sky all around him.
The reason he was so good at defensive magic was because he'd had to learn some from his mother when his home had been plagued by Death Eaters and by Voldemort himself, when his father hadn't been able to help him. One of the Death Eaters he'd lived with had been Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf infamous for attacking children. Narcissa had made absolutely sure that Draco knew how to defend himself from werewolves.
Harry wasn't there when Draco arrived. Oh well, he'd be fine. He'd died before (twice, apparently); he could get through a short spell of levitation.
was why he fell with his eyes closed for the majority of the time; when you saw the ground coming at you, you were liable to freeze up in fear. Draco knew this from experience. Madame Pomfrey hadn't been at
The broom came speeding through from the sky in a blur of brown; Harry somehow mounted it, now facing downwards in a nosedive position. At least, Draco thought it was down that Harry was facing; he wasn't quite sure which way was up and which was down at this point.
They walked into the Great Hall holding hands properly, and this time the uproar and the warmth in Draco's hand brought a smile to his face.
Ronald (whose branch was shaking violently) screamed and held onto the branch; Blaise had fallen silent; Pansy stood back and watched. It was Hermione- bless her saintly soul- that saved him; she cast a series of lightening and levitating spells at him just as the tree began to fall sideways. "
"Hey, Draco," Pansy said, drawing Draco's attention away from the teachers. "Look."
"And why should I let you borrow my notes?"
He didn't land on his feet; instead he attempted to roll as he landed. He realised, as he tried this, that he had landed on a hill. And he was rolling down it.
"Well, you know the story about the Deathly Hallows?"
"You just did."
Potter bristled, on-edge from what Draco deduced had been a nightmare. "Well, I don't have my glasses, and we'd been attacked by bloody werewolves last I remember. Are we still in Flamel's place?"
"Why don't you try listing every- every person you've ever been?" Hermione had suggested.
Harry looked down at the floor, scuffing his shoes along the floor. Was he blushing again? "You- you should really wear make-up more often, you look astonishing," he whispered.
The Slytherins at the far back of the classroom; a mix of the few Hufflepuffs and then the Gryffindors sat in front of them; and the Ravenclaws crowded together at the front of the classroom.
if he just happened to notice when Potter was and wasn't out practicing with him? He was just eyeing up-
Slowly, more Gryffindors started comparing their tallies and results with the Slytherins; the Slytherins started gravitating towards the Gryffindor tally-record-holder and, by extension, the Gryffindor table, at breaks and lunches. Both houses soon found that they had more common ground than just the tally competitions; they were both
"Not yet. Why were you following us? Forgot how to get to the dungeons on your own?"
Perhaps it was his heroic streak that refused to allow anything to die, but he seemed to almost intuitively know what the plants needed and when; a few days into the supervision, Draco actually left the plants with Potter to go and eat lunch with his friends. When he returned, the plants were quiet, and Potter was sat in- was that a
game began sometime in the middle of fourth year, when Draco just wouldn't shut up about Potter in the tournament and the dragons and his badges.
"He's going to do that by himself, Nott."
Draco strode up to the portrait, and said, confidently, "Pygmy Puffs." The portrait didn't move.
"Oh, has no one given you your room? Up the astronomy tower, the door at the back of the room. You'll find all of your belongings up there. You'll be staying for the next five months, and the classes we have now won't be doing stargazing until far later in the year. Wards are up, and you'll find all the commodities you might need up there already. Go on, then. I expect to see you both,
"Yes, Potter? What do you want?"
that old toad. In any case, we're headed to that place.
Harry had been cooking lunch for everyone again, making something that smelled amazing, and Draco had been watching, begging for scraps. ("Like a bloody dog", as Ron had put it.) At some point, Harry just so casually said, "Draco, pass the salt." And everyone froze. Except Harry, who remained oblivious to what he'd just said. But in the living room, Hermione looked up from her book, Ron choked on air, a smile stretched over Molly's face, Ginny spat out her tea, and Fred had dropped the plates he'd been levitating over to the table. When they smashed, Harry turned around to find Draco looking at him with wide, silvery eyes sparkling in the afternoon sun, cheeks flushed and his pretty mouth agape. Harry wondered what had happened to make Draco look at him like that. Then he realised. And promptly fainted.
Draco strode into the Gryffindor common room confidently, head held high. "Granger!" he called, scanning the room. He was shoved up against a wall by a blur of red; Weasley had pinned him to the wall. Oh, look at that. He had his wand at Draco's neck.
Draco summoned Jisky and had her bring him the largest carrot she could find; while she set off to do that, he walked down to the Black Lake and selected the finest small boulders for the eyes, and several slightly smaller rocks for the mouth. He arranged them on the face to make a happy smile with two round-ish eyes before Jisky arrived back with a carrot taller than herself. Draco took it and dismissed her back to the Room of Requirement with a smile and his thanks.
McGonagall smiled and rolled her eyes. "Alright, alright. How do we know this person is trustworthy? How do we know these potions work?"
At the back of the room was a door. This had taken Draco a good half hour of trial and error to get right, plus the hours spent examining the source material. He led an ogling Potter past all the alchemy and potions equipment to the door, and opened it to let Potter through first. Potter stopped stock-still in the doorway, and Draco knew his jaw had dropped open, his eyes wide with wonder.
about Saint
he shouted at himself mentally. As if to reinforce this, he spotted a werewolf over Potter's shoulder, quickly gaining on them; Draco suddenly realised that while Potter was running from the wolves (and doing surprisingly well, considering he was only human, after all), Draco himself was doing nothing. Immediately, he raised his wand, looking away from the wolves to focus his concentration on himself and Potter; he was useless at offensive magic, but his defensive was above average.
He sat with Pansy and Blaise at the Gryffindor Table. "What are you doing here?" he asked them.
"The Burrow, obviously; Luna's house, Andromeda's house; wow, Harry doesn't really have many place to go to. Um, Godric's Hollow?"
, there is a snake wrapped around your
Immediately, Malfoy's guards went up; he visibly became more wary. "What, Potter?"
"Mr. Potter, what have you brought us?" McGonagall asked.
. And he realised, with a shock, that they were. Potter seemed to realise this, too, because he turned and met Draco's mortified gaze with one of his own. "Dear Merlin," Draco breathed. "What's happened to me?"
Potter scowled. "Yeah, I do, but Snape tried to teach me in Fifth year, and he did such a terrible job that my Godfather ended up dead."
Then he remembered Harry; turned to him to ask what he thought of the note and the place- only to find that Harry had disappeared from his side.
," Hermione breathed.
The Black family home.
Draco was so distracted by his thoughts, he didn't fully register everything Blaise had said until he reached the Room of Requirement. Then he turned and bolted back down the corridors, leaping down the stairs to McGonagall's classroom; he burst in and grabbed Blaise, hauling him outside by the tail of his robes.
She shot up out of bed, readying her cushioning charms that lay, usually dormant, over the grounds of Hogwarts, waiting for something like this to happen. She watched through her window as a head of shaggy black hair popped out and looked around. The quick flash of bright green eyes were distinguishable, even from a distance.
Now, he cast a Levicorpus, and had Potter follow him over the plains and to Flamel's house.
His world had narrowed down to himself and this tiny, tiny ball of gold, thrumming under his fingertips, familiar from a game of his youth, and from the very last moments of his life.
He didn't notice when a few minutes later, an invisible figure hidden from his wards under a cloak, slipped out of the potions classroom, having inspected Draco's notebook where he left it after dropping off his Mandrake root clippings.
Flamel, obviously putting up a brave facade, looked up at Potter cockily. "And just how would you do that, Potter?"
"I- I don't know. My name is common, doesn't really mean anything-"
They made their way up quietly. For all Draco's wit and joking at the base of the hill, where they were hidden from whatever lay on the other side of this hill, he was rather nervous. He was in foreign territory; he didn't know where he was or who else might be here, and while he trusted Potter with his life (he already owed him a life debt; how couldn't he?) and he knew Potter was more than capable of defending them both, Draco knew he was almost entirely incompetent in offense. He was unbelievably talented at defense, but if he was asked to attack... he just couldn't. He'd always been taught that the best form of offense was a good defense.
Why was Blaise with her?
! Watch it, Malfoy. Merlin, you're heavy," Potter groaned from beneath Draco. He'd been pushed to the ground when Draco came tumbling out of the sky, providing a soft landing.
Flamel was still sat before the fireplace. When Draco walked in, he stood, picking up the photo and recipe. "Ready to exchange, now, boy?"
She gave Pansy, Blaise and Potter stiff nods and formal greetings before turning to Draco. "What happened?" is the first thing she asks him, and Draco is suddenly so,
"Yeah, Salazar Slytherin had some vision of me, when he was making the school-"
How else could he leave the Gryffindor tower without going through the Fat Lady's portrait? Really, Hogwarts should install fire escapes. This was
!" Draco spluttered.
Harry's suspicions were confirmed when, on Friday, he overheard Parkinson and Zabini talking in quiet voices in the hallway about how
Two ginger-haired menaces flew at him, both talking over each other, shouting questions and accusations at Draco. Behind them, Granger watched on in amusement. Pansy and Blaise, who had been sat next to her (since when did that happen?) stood and joined her, smirking. This wouldn't be good.
"I- well- I practice every day, like a
"Oh," he said softly. "Thank you." He smiled at Harry, who smiled back nervously in return, and then Harry wasn't the only one blushing.
McGonagall watched on with a proud smile; in every major conversation that drew the houses together, Draco and Harry were in the center of it, without even meaning to be. Ruler, lion, hero, and dragon indeed.

"Really good," Potter said. His voice was quiet; almost subdued. "Calm, and happy, too."

"Granger or nothing, Potter."
At first, all Draco could see was black. All he could feel was the rush of the wind, whipping wildly at his hair, his clothes, his skin; tearing at him as he fell, like when he fell from his broom in Quidditch. Harry's arms were still wrapped around him from when he steadied him; now, they tightened, hugging Draco close.
His most distinctive feature, however, was his beard.
Curfew arrived all too soon; the teachers, snow-covered and grinning, herded the students inside. They were told sternly that there would

Draco's jaw dropped open; Severus, seeing the connection Draco had made, snickered. Even angrier at the fact that now he had been tricked into disclosing absolutely everything to Potter- of all people! Why was it always
Immediately, she began to panic as Harry clambered through the window. Surely he wouldn't
"Yes, murtlap are pretty harmless; but they nip at your ankles if you get close. These murtlap started nipping at me everywhere.

Actually, he has the memory stored permanently in part of his pensieve; he says he's never laughed so hard. He didn't even tell me off afterwards for letting all his birds out; none of them escaped, and he said I'd had punishment enough.
"Okay. So. I saw on the- actually, it'd be easier to show you." He withdrew from his back pocket a weathered piece of parchment, yellowed and wrinkled. He opened it, and ink spread out over the pages, creating a message that read,

When the potion had all been bottled up, Harry levitated them into the Great Hall; with all eyes on him, Draco snuck in without anyone noticing and sat down at the Slytherin table. "That's them?" Pansy asked. Draco nodded. "Woah. Well done," she murmured to him.
But Draco's pride wouldn't let him roll down the hill like a four-year-old, so he kept walking.
"The Mumble plant it is, then," Pansy said with a clap.
"Yup. I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm really not."
An older-looking house elf said, "The wand was originally belonging to Harry Potter, but now it has allegiance to both Young Master Draco and Harry Potter."
Draco nodded. "Yeah, I get it." It still stung a little to think of Crabbe; especially since that lead to his memories of the leaping fire reaching for him, and then of the look on Potter's face as he came back to get Draco; the insufferable "righteous hero" expression. Draco had never been happier to see it. He still owed Potter a life debt for that, actually. But, well, if Potter didn't bring it up, neither would he.

, Potter."
Draco stood drew his wand with a flourish. Pansy, who had been stood behind Blaise, threw one last snowball at the back of his head before sprinting to hide behind the nearest tree; what good sense she had, Draco mused. Evidently, it was sense that Blaise had none of... He was still stood there, arms out placatingly, looking mortally terrified (and rightfully so) as Draco twirled his wand, and behind him rose a fleet of perfectly round, compact snowballs.
When Harry was let go, he immediately collapsed. Where was Draco?
. I can't get it. How do you-"
Draco awoke to Harry Potter. Sat on
After three hours of Harry being missing, Ronald Weasley got suspicious. And what do you do when something might be wrong? You go to Hermione, of course.
"Wait," said Parkinson. "Granger, you said McGonagall Flooed the place? Wouldn't it be easier for us to just Floo around asking, too?"
After half an hour of failed attempts to catch Slughorn (he seemed unusually good at hiding himself in the snowy landscape), McGonagall declared the rest of the day's lessons off; after all, it was the first snow of the year. She reminded everyone to be inside for curfew, then retreated to the castle for "a nice cup of tea and maybe a biscuit". Draco thought that that sounded wonderful, and was about to follow her inside when Jisky appeared next to him. "The Stone has melted," she said.
Dinnertime had rolled around; as the pair made their way down to the Great Hall, they talked in quiet voices about what might've happened. Zabini and Parkinson were already waiting for the two when they arrived, and they seemed worried, too. When Ron and Hermione had seated themselves, they opened up their issue with the rest of their friends. Ginny (and Luna by extension), Neville, Seamus and Dean, and Parkinson and Zabini overheard, too. None of them would spread the news- who knew how badly Hogwarts would panic if they thought Harry was really missing, not just doing potions with Malfoy. (Actually, they might panic more at the second idea than the first. Harry
Then Pansy and the rest pounced on their own presents; Draco wrestled his way out of his wrappings, winked at Harry, then turned to his own presents.
"Yes, Pansy. Not
"So you'd say it if we
Had he left Hogwarts grounds? No, he wouldn't, it was dangerous outside of Hogwarts. With any magical beasts roaming the countryside, you never knew what you could encounter. He wouldn't leave Hogwarts unless he was really trying to escape. Why had he even run in the first place? Harry had just been asking him questions so he could add Draco to his mind palace (not that he'd told Draco that that was his motivation). He'd asked if Draco had been eating... Harry tried to recall exactly what had happened.
Quidditch.
They sat in silence a while, and then Draco said, "Thank you, Harry. I accept your apology. I hope you know that."
"Mr. Malfoy, you have been caring for these plants for over a week now, staying up at night for them and everything, I believe, quite akin to how a parent would."
Draco gave Pansy and Blaise the most betrayed and wounded look, but they only laughed at his peril- the bloody
"What do you want, Malfoy?" she asked; but she wasn't just asking like normal people did. She knew that he wanted something specific. Clever.

He walked over to where the family tapestry hung on the wall, a few scorch marks of disappointing children burned off across the fabric. Near the end, he saw his own little portrait.
"Occlumency is the act- or the ability- of having complete control over your emotions and your mind, as a general definition. You can use it to repel Legilimens and other mind-infiltrating powers; others might use it as a method of meditation or to control anger or fear or sadness.

Draco took a moment to vehemently curse whoever had put up the anti-apparition wards around Grimmauld Place. He couldn't escape this.

Pansy brushed aside the heavy dressing-room curtains and gasped. "Draco," she breathed, "You look absolutely gorgeous."
"No, Potter, I am actually quite capable of keeping things alive; I, myself, am a prime example. I am incredibly difficult to keep alive, you know, and yet here I stand, perfectly healthy. These plants are all perfectly healthy, and they should be ready to add to the potion that'll make the Stone soon."
Potter grinned. "Thanks, Professor. C'mon Malfoy, let's go."
"I don't know. How's it going with growing stuff? Killed anything?"
Because, of
Potter made his way upstairs slowly, and Draco seated himself on the living room sofa, listening to the creak of the floorboards upstairs. All the doors in the hallway at the top of the stairs were opened and shut individually; every room was given a few minutes of appreciation.
He sighed, resigning himself to making another derivative of the Dreamless Sleep Potion when he remembered the train of thought he'd had earlier.
Draco walked over to the nearest tree and began hitting his head against it repeatedly.
"Jisky!" he called. A pop of apparition revealed the house-elf.
Then, without waiting for a response, she turned and left, her heels click-clacking on the floor of the hospital wing.
He was at the back of the room; the front was hidden, enveloped in a darkness he couldn't see through. He went to grab his wand, and found nothing there. He cursed, remembering that Draco had his wand... and Draco was on the other side of the door at the end of the corridor. Well, there was nothing for it. Harry gathered all his Gryffindor courage and walked- more cautiously than he would have done normally- into the darkness.
, is it?"
Potter blinked again. "Um- yeah. So- we'll have to look through the Forest, I suppose."
It would be a long night.
The ingredients had been difficult to obtain (as was shown by the fact that he was growing the plants himself), but the brewing of the potion itself was almost impossible. First of all, it was written in a shorthand Draco could hardly read, so he'd had to transcribe it; secondly, he'd had to find rare varieties of stirring sticks and cauldron materials in order to be able to brew the cauldron with as few lethal reactions as possible. He'd avoided any so far, but the most dangerous part was when he added one of Viv's leaves, ground up into a mush, mixed with a drop of his own blood-
Why did she look so triumphant?
Potter had sunk into one of the chairs, his legs curled up onto the chair. He was leaning against one of the armrests, staring into the fire. Draco made his way over, and sat on the chairs as he'd been taught to- back straight, legs out in front of him, hands folded, head high. Or, well, he tried to. The chair seemed designed to make you comfortable, and Draco was embraced by the soft cushions. He felt like he was being given a warm hug. Deciding that this was
He added the potion without the unicorn's blood to the second mandrake clipping, stepping back just in case- you never knew what could happen with potions. He'd learned this lesson many times over from potions gone wrong. When nothing happened, he stepped closer. The first Mandrake root was dead still, flopped over as much as it could; asleep. It'd wake up in a bit, he'd only added a few drops. The second looked a little... Well, it seemed rather lifeless compared to the first clipping. But who knew? Maybe it was just really deeply asleep. Since he was waiting, he decided to go get some more Mandrake clippings from the Herbology sheds (you could never have too many). He'd gotten all his other ingredients from the Forbidden Forest, but Mandrakes didn't grow there. They made excellent test subjects; a little rough, and liable to react badly with some potions ingredients, but as long as you were careful you were fine. They all had the same reactions to poison and fatalistic things and- importantly- sleeping potions as humans did, which was Draco's favourite thing about them. Plus, being only clippings of the full plant, they didn't scream or anything terrible like that. They were quiet, waiting to be tested. And if you did accidentally kill one- well, you could powder it or dice it and reuse it in a potion!
"Not by choice, trust me," Draco said. "And I advise you to get lost before Pansy sees you or you will also be pulled along for clothes shopping."
"I don't know! At some point a rule was made that boys can't go into the girl's dormitories, and the stairs transform into a slide whenever you try to go up." He paused. "Say, Malfoy, are you actually a girl?"
"Albus owes me fifty galleons," she murmured.
"Why do you need to know this, Mr. Malfoy?"
. And even if I did, why would I invite you along to go shopping with me?"
Draco watched Harry carefully. He'd moved so quickly, Draco hadn't even registered it until he was pinned against the wall by his throat.

"My pensieve and memories are over there," Dumbledore said, gesturing to a wardrobe-type thing. Draco stepped closer, and the doors opened. A pensieve floated out. Behind it stood racks and racks of vials, all filled with shimmering memories. "Do you know how to use a pensieve?" Dumbledore asked.
Draco looked scandalised. "Of course not! Just look at him. He's eating french toast, and he's got extra maple syrup on top- must've been a bad nightmare- with only a couple of strawberries. And he's got a cup of coffee, too, to wake him up. If he's got syrup on his toast, it must be three sugars in the coffee, and probably a full shot of espresso."

Flamel, seeming slightly thrown-off, turned to Potter. "Well, I'm not quite sure, actually. Time passes differently here than it does in the real world. It feels like it's been years, though. Say, when you leave, could you ask him to come through sometime?"
Harry rushed up to McGonagall's office with a brief "Hello," to Dumbledore, Snape, and Fawkes. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder, and called out "Grimmauld Place!" as he stepped into the fire.
"Weasley said you woke up from a nightmare."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Get the high ground, obviously. Have you never done strategizing, ever? You fought a

They found they worked rather well together, in fact. Their weaknesses and strengths nicely contrasted and matched; potions and DADA they were very much terrible and brilliant at individually. They were scared and smart and hated and brave and ignorant and loved. Working together, and helping each other, they actually got the two highest grades in the year on average; on par with Hermione, who was doing even better than usual seeing as she was only coaching Ron and not Harry too. Also, Ron was excelling, now he had Hermione's sole focus. And, not having Draco and Harry being distracting every lesson, the rest of eighth year was getting better and better, too.

He headed back up to the castle, up to Gryffindor tower, through the Fat Lady's portrait, and found Ron relaxing by the fire, Hermione resting her head on his lap. They really were cute together; Harry was glad they'd finally noticed each other's feelings after all this time. Upon closer inspection, the two were asleep. Harry decided he could wake them up and tell them about Malfoy's stupid stunt later.

"No, but you disarmed Dumbledore. That counted as defeating him. You, from that moment, had control of the Elder Wand."

"I'm sorry for being so horrible to you, even though all you did was reject my friendship, and it was because I really was a brat back then. I'm sorry for my prejudices and my anger and the arguments.
Draco stepped further in, lighting his- Harry's- wand. The corridor was empty. Draco had the sudden realisation that there was only one place Harry could have gone to. Oh,
It was easily as long as he was tall; wiry grey and thin, but so very long. He was stroking it as he watched the flames flicker.
When, hours and hours later, Draco returned to the portrait hiding the Slytherins from him, he looked straight at the camera as he said, "I'm in love with Harry Potter." He didn't mean it, but after seeing how Potter had rebounded from what looked to have been a PTSD attack, gone from curled up in the fetal position on the grass to smiling to laughing and soaring through the sky after the snitch, he was pretty sure he didn't

One gets the attention without even trying, but spends their time carefully monitoring the other, going so far as to be nearly stalking them for over a year.

A light appeared in the darkness, illuminating the space. Harry appeared okay- he looked around himself first, assessing his surroundings. When he appeared to have deemed them safe, he gestured for Draco to join him.
The date of the potions' finish was drawing nearer.
"Shut up, Malfoy, I could still best you in a duel right now and we both know it. Anyway, don't you think we should ask for help? It would go faster doing this with more people."
Draco liked succeeding.

But what tipped Draco off was what mirror-Harry had done. Mirror-Harry had cocked his head to the side and frowned. Worried. Confused.

Draco was rather familiar with the Look; he saw it quite a lot.
He didn't have to wake very long.
"Weakling," Draco replied, although he had been about to suggest a break; his arms ached, his fingers felt like they were about to fall off from the cold- his nose, too- and his back was screaming from being bent over for so long.
"Don't worry about it, Malfoy," Granger said matter-of-factly. "Harry always gets you something, too." Draco stared at her, dumbfounded.

Draco turned around and saw that she had moved the snowmen, rearranged them so that they looked towards Hogwarts, with their wood-arms... Oh. They were holding hands.
So few students returned overall for their eighth year, they'd been put together in one slightly-larger-than-usual group for classes. This, of course, created problems with conflicting house rivalries and other problems with inter-house arguments; but none of the teachers wanted to split the class and deal with the eighth years for two hours.

And if he was stalking Potter.
As soon as he landed, he cast more permanent shields and wards on the ground, giving the boys an area of about four feet squared that the werewolves would struggle to enter. But he knew that the wolves still could, with effort, and definitely would, and that was where Potter would come in with his DADA magic.
Potter rubbed over a faint scar on his hand- the way rubbed at his scar he did when someone mentioned Voldemort. Remembering how he received it. "Yeah, there. Merlin, I
Draco turned to him, raised an eyebrow, turned pointedly to the wall behind him, and said, "No, Potter, I think he's talking to the
"Talk to them!" Draco yelled back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw understanding flash across Potter's face.
The floor and walls were a blank rough grey stone that seemed to leech warmth out of Harry's body; he found himself shivering in seconds. But that might also have been due to the fact that he knew where he was; yes, he'd been here before.
Inside the castle, Harry and Draco were dashing through the halls towards the Room of Requirement. They paced back and forth together in front of the entrance, impatient with excitement. As soon as the door appeared, Draco flung it open and ran over to the cauldron containing the melted Stone. He knew the steps to extract the Elixir, had spent Merlin knew how long going over the motions meticulously, but just in case... "Harry, what's the incantation?"

been, Ron supposed. He couldn't actually think of a single time this year that Malfoy had insulted Hermione- especially not for her blood status.
The trio didn't start talking until they were out of the castle, headed towards the forest. Through the trees, Draco could see his
He spotted it on the table behind him and to his left. He grabbed it- he refused to notice the glint of a golden ring that now sat on the pair of intertwined hands he could see inside- and lowered it slowly into the potion. The liquid went from a vibrant orange to a deep scarlet, almost the colour of blood.
Draco looked down, horrified. He'd thought it tasted bitter!
And suddenly Draco was panicking and
So Draco stood, abruptly, stepping away from the glass that showed him things that weren't true; stepped into

Inside Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione split up from Blaise and Pansy- as the Slytherins had insisted on being called- with a surprisingly amiable goodbye. As they headed up to Gryffindor tower, Ron decided that he would wait until Harry was ready to tell him whatever he wanted to until he drew his final conclusions. For now, as long as Malfoy wasn't hurting Harry, Ron would just avoid the subject as much as he could.
"Have I ever told you I sued someone as a toddler? Yeah, It's related. So, imagine. I was about- what, three? Four? And I was playing around in the gardens while my mother gardened and my father worked in his office.
McGonagall, sat at her desk, spoke up. "I'm going to pretend not to have heard any of this conversation. I am also going to pretend not to have told you that Filch won't be roaming the castle tonight, and neither will Mrs. Norris."
Draco nodded his acknowledgement. "So, once you memorise someone, you pick a room that they'd most likely be found in- so, for your Weasel, probably the kitchen-" Potter made a sound of protest, but Draco smirked and moved on- "And you put them there, in your home in you mind, doing something- always doing something, because you'll remember movement better than most other things. So, put Granger on the sofa, reading, for example, rather than having her stand around doing nothing. Have Luna sitting upside down reading the Quibbler, rather than just pointing at something and smiling. The crazier and more absurd, the better.
He appeared in a dismal grey street, somewhere in London. The sky was a blanket of grey, and the chill in the air promised a shower of rain soon. Draco shivered- he was only in his school robes- and stepped forward as a house emerged from between two others. His mother had brought him here when he was very little- the House of Black, she'd told him it was. For years he'd thought it was called "Grim Old Place", for while it was majestic in its pure-blooded splendour, it was grim, and old, and grey. It was hidden from the muggles by a Fidelius charm. He wondered who the Secret-Keeper was nowadays.
Ahead, Pansy and Granger walked, arm-in-arm, chattering excitedly about Merlin-knew-what. Blaise joined the boys. "Lighten up, you two, it's nearly Christmas!"

"It's for a really good cause, Harry. He won't tell you because- wait, why won't you tell him? You knew I'd tell him, but you told me-"
Draco froze. "The- where Vince- and the cabinet- I mean, where you held DADA meetings the year we had Umbridge?"
Draco gasped when he realised what it was; he put it on timidly, careful not to tear anything. Outside, he heard a round of applause for Blaise's last outfit.
"Well, I get hyper-fixated on some things. I'll forget to do everything else, like sleep and eat, because I'm so used to just working on something, and not allowing myself any basic needs until it's done. Guess it's a habit now." Draco didn't see Potter's eyebrows shoot up. "Sticks pretty easily, too. After I first developed it, back in sixth year-" he didn't see the way Potter's body went tense and still- "I couldn't eat much except water on a day-to-day basis, 'cause my body was so used to receiving so few nutrients, getting so many from a full meal made me sick."
The edge of Granger's mouth twitched upwards. "No, not that I know of. So, what was your question?"
Harry wasn't concerned when Draco suddenly became alert and anxious. He didn't even notice. Maybe he could learn to, over time.

"When Harry Potter defeated Young Master Malfoy in Malfoy Manor," the elf said, "Young Master Draco's wand swore allegiance to Harry Potter as well as Young Master Malfoy."
And Draco remembers that the- the thing that caused his little "fainting episode", remembers that it is tucked somewhere in that mess of Potter's hair, and scrambles across the bed away from him as Blaise laughs even harder. He manages to choke out, "You fainted because of
They were nearing the mark of it having been half a year since the Battle of Hogwarts, and the castle seemed to be preparing for what was sure to be a dismal day of remembrance. Draco could have scoffed at the idea. His father would have, too; he would have snickered and shot Draco a glance and muttered, "Sentiment is for pathetic weaklings," and Draco would have smirked and snickered and held his head high above the weeping masses of the dismal commoners, all sobbing over their fallen friends.
Nothing was quite the same after that.
"Well, that's the other thing I came for." He turned to face the large portrait of Albus Dumbledore, hung on the wall behind him, watching with kindly eyes; and, by extension, the smaller, darker portrait of Severus Snape, hung next to Dumbledore. "Hello, Uncle Severus; Professor. Do you two know about what I've been doing?"
Now... What had changed? Draco was now in the mirror, he was holding hands with Harry, and he was smiling.

Potter led him to the Black Lake- to the spot he went to when he had nightmares, Draco noticed. The path was slightly worn; Potter must frequent this spot a lot to have made such a prominent path, as only one person.
When they left, they found that snow had begun to fall; just a light dusting of it, the sort of lovely fluffy flakes that landed on your nose and hair like a thin second layer. Weasley spun around in the snow, delighted, and with the help of Blaise, managed to collect enough snow to make a snowball and throw it at Hermione. Pansy and Draco stood back and laughed as she chased them. Her bushy, snow-covered hair would have made her seem almost comical as she stormed after them, if not for the slight terror that arose in Draco when she turned on him for laughing at her. He cowered behind Pansy, who laughed at him... Until Weasley hit her in the face with a snowball.
He smiled, still a little shaky. So far so good. "Well, not really chickens. It's just- okay, let me start from the beginning."

"Pretty much, yeah."
He made the movement with his wand and a few moments later, the doors opened again; a small, red-orange stone flew into Harry's palm. "Here you go, Malfoy," he said. "Now, I'm off to the infirmary to make sure I didn't accidentally sustain any injuries."

Pansy and Blaise stepped forward. Silence fell over the group. "We have gathered you here tonight to play a- a game, of sorts," Blaise began.

"You can't be here!" shouted a good ten people, while others shouted some form of agreeal or "Get away!"
was fading; it wouldn't stay for another half hour, at best, and Draco doubted he could cast another one successfully. He was so tired and cold and just plain miserable.
Where were they?
"Nope. It's just... Well,
Still, he wanted comfort. Who would he go to for that? His friends were all here at Hogwarts, and he'd show up on the map if he was here. His family was already out of the picture... Well, most of them. Wasn't Draco related to the Black family? His mother was Sirius' sister, or something... Harry was pretty sure he'd seen Draco on the Black family tree back at Grimmauld Place. So maybe he'd go to a Black? Who was left?
"Right. Oh, by the way, how come you're down here and not in classes?"
Draco's cheeks were pinker than the blush when he stepped into the dressing room. When Pansy joined him to help him take off the make-up, she gave him the Look. "Don't," he told her softly. "I already know."
"Number 12, Grimmauld Place," said Parkinson and Zabini.
"Yeah, look, here's the head, with a happy face," Pansy told him, pointing at the top snowball on her snowman, who did, indeed, have a smiley face drawn into him, "And these two are the body, and these sticks are the arms. Harry says you can make a big snowman, too, and put a scarf on it, but he didn't want to make a big one with you and Ronald rolling around making snow angels," she added.

Shaggy beasts, stood tall on their hind legs.
"Bet you a galleon it'll be at least five," Draco shot back.
Maybe the boys' relationship just gets stronger.
He felt himself sinking, like one does into a pensieve, but found he was floating down rather than tumbling. All he could see was still golden. So the potion hadn't changed colour. Also good.

When they reached the clearing, Granger went around and checked Draco's spells. When she'd made a full circle of the clearing, she turned to Potter. "Harry, these are really good. Have you been practicing them?"

! Like two parents looking after their child! Oh, this is brilliant. Pomona, Albus and Severus all owe me twenty galleons each!" She declared, leaving the room still laughing, unaware of the two mortified boys she'd left behind.
"Please, call me Draco. Mr. Malfoy is my father's name," Draco said, returning subconsciously to the manners he's had drilled into him at McGonagall's formalities.
But he no longer despised him, either.
! One was skintight, with a slit up the right-hand side, in a gorgeous lush green; the second was softer, looser, a pretty pastel pink with a bow around the waistband and lace trimmings at the bottom and many poofy layers of tulle. He admired them both, glanced up to see Harry's eyes on him, cautious, hopeful; Draco grinned and ran out of the hall.
Granger didn't look very mollified at all, and to stop her lecturing him about mandrake root rights (Granger was infamous for her lectures) Draco hurried to distract her with other bits of knowledge and theories. "So, my Mandrake root clipping died; I figured it's cause I can't replace the unicorn blood. You need something-"
Draco pointed it out to Potter, and they started making their way down the hill. About a third of the way down, Potter muttered, "Oh, I'm done with this," lay down, and went rolling down the hill. Draco watched, incredulous, at Potter's absolute lack of care for his clothes and his honour... although he
"Good question. Uhh... Blaise?"
The room Potter had conjured up wasn't the worst Draco had ever been in. It was decorated with neutral colours, no specific house colours featured more than any other. Two plush purple chairs were situated around a fire- a golden, glowing fire, not the terrible scarlet of fiendfyre.
"They work. I used one last night, and I don't feel any addiction whatsoever, and I slept peacefully. You can trust the person." Harry met Draco's eyes. "I trust them with my life."
When the potion was finally done (the same colour as it was usually, thank Merlin) Draco took the smallest sample- only a drop- and put it on a small Mandrake test sample. It fell asleep quickly, which was a good sign, but Draco wouldn't be able to tell if the potion had worked entirely until the next morning. Harry summoned the snake's cage from the classroom and led Draco into his childhood home here in the Room; he and Draco both took separate bedrooms to wait out the night.
As Draco had thought he would, Harry had taken a few precious moments in the Room to be confused. He stared at the spot Draco had been stood, then turned to look at the door, now closing slowly behind him He heard feet pounding on the stone tiles, heard them echo more and more quietly as they receded.
McGonagall's eyes flickered to Draco. "And how, Mr. Potter, have they accomplished this?"
"Well then, you know that every headmaster or headmistress of Hogwarts-"
"What? Potter, who are you thinking of? Spit it out."
Harry shut himself off from the world, from his friends. If they weren't close to him, if he cut all his ties- maybe they wouldn't get hurt any further. Besides, when he had been with them, before he shut them all out, he had hated looking in their eyes. All he could see was pity, and sorrow. Loss. Pain. He hated knowing he was the one who'd caused it.
"Well, Potter told me that you take good notes, and we have all the same classes, so..."
Just as they neared the portrait for the Slytherin dungeons, Draco whirled around, wand bared and eyes glinting dangerously. The Slytherins were shoved up against a wall and restrained, ropes flying around them. At the same time, their wands all flew up out of their robes and into Draco's waiting hands. He caught one of them looking surprised, and asked, "
He reminded Draco of Slughorn; the same wispy hair lingered on the side of his head, the same pudginess surrounded his figure.
They'd certainly been through a lot.
And the paper in his hand.
"Well, it's been lovely eating with you boys, but I have a girls' day off to plan with Millicent," Pansy said. "Ciao." And she was gone, arm linked through Millicent Bulstrode's, already talking in excited voices about fashion and trends and winter clothes.
"Well..." He paused, then deflated, his body sagging, looking almost ashamed. "You said it yourself," he said, far quieter. "Everyone who had a big role in the war has nightmares now. I- I hate them- the nightmares, I mean- and I'm pretty sure everyone else does, too. Potter was talking about his nightmares earlier. You can tell 'cause he looks over his shoulder like he's looking for the Dark- for Voldemort. And he tenses up, and he just looks annoyed. He's definitely tired of the nightmares, now the war is over and all. We're all supposed to be happy and smiling and perfectly normal now, but we can't be normal when we're all being plagued every night by reminders of the past. I'm tired of it, but Dreamless Sleep is addictive, and therefore dangerous to use.
he's every one of his previous personas, all taken and mashed up. He's better at hiding some things; better at expressing himself in others. He is also, entirely, mine ((True.)) and he is the hottest man I've ever laid eyes on. He is also the smartest potions master I know, and he is absolutely perfect. Even with his annoying tsundere-like approach to emotions ((Harry, what's a tsundere?) Don't worry 'bout it, love.) and how his hair is so beautiful all tied up like this and slightly annoyingly perfect, and his frown about how I'm describing him positively ((I'm not frowning!) Love, now you're scowling. (... Shut up.) Nope. Where was I? Oh, yeah-) And he is perfect and I love him. He's all of his past mixed together because the past has shaped and changed him and made him into what he is today. He is, right now, more than he ever has been before, loved. By me, by his parents, by his friends- he is loved. Cared for. And we're gonna help him through this, just like we've helped him through other problems, and he's helped us with ours in return. Draco Lucius Malfoy, right now, is himself. He will not be changed or altered in any way. And, I'm pretty sure I'm right in saying that while he is loved more now than ever before, he will be loved even more in the future; by new friends, new family, as well as older ones, too. And, more importantly, he'll be loved by himself. He'll grow into himself, until he fits himself just right. And we'll all be right by him as he learns who he is.
Draco beamed. So there
"I didn't steal him-"
"You had a wife, right?"
, until he realised that oh,
"It gets worse, Harry," Hermione interjected.
Potter walked straight through the wall.
Draco knew the rough concept, but he'd never actually used a pensieve before. His father had one in his office, but Draco had been forbidden to enter that room. In the moment that he hesitated, Dumbledore smiled.
Unbeknownst to him, this triggered another ward- this time, it was Professor McGonagall's.
. But Draco had no time to deliberate; he would do as the instructions said. He plunged himself, headfirst, into the potion. It felt like a gust of warm air. Good.
"Well, this is hardly any fun," he heard Pansy say from below him. "Draco isn't the slightest bit afraid."
They mounted the hill. It appeared to be the highest of a series of hills; behind him, he could see that flat wasteland, stretching out to the horizon. To his left was a forest- with a sigh of relief, Draco recognised it as the forest he and Potter had fallen into the last time they'd arrived here. Before him, over a rolling landscape of hills, lay the plains, and- there it was- Flamel's modest little cabin.
"Right then. Draco. What can I do for you?"
. "I suppose you finished all your shopping- what, last year?" Blaise asked him.
glad that she is here and not his father; because with everything going on (waking up to have Potter at his side, said Potter siding with his friends against him- and all after Draco had already fainted) Draco really needed some parental love, and if his father had been here, his first question to Draco would've been something along the lines of
"Hullo," he says. "Hogwarts, too?"
to tell someone about Malfoy's stunt, or he might just explode. It'd been a really good trick- even
Draco rose into the air. It was calm today; the winds were slow and warm, barely a brush against his cheek or a rustle of his equipment. His broom was warm under his hands, waiting for his commands. The ground slowly got smaller and more indistinct below him as he rose higher, the air cooling a few degrees. When he was so high he couldn't see the Hogwarts courtyard well enough to distinguish it from the section of roof over the Great Hall, he stopped.
Which reminded him. Where
She kept crying, though, and reaching out for someone.
He was so many people.
Draco looked at himself in the mirror. Hmm. "No," he called back. "Pans, come help me with this."
"Oh Merlin," Draco murmured, lowering himself to the ground so he wouldn't fall over from the shock of it all.
Draco's Harry didn't do that.
Granger blinked. "Malfoy?" Her eyes narrowed slightly. "What are you doing?"

He heard a crinkle of paper.
"You weren't spreading your arms enough," Harry told him. "Look, watch me."
When they finally reached the dungeon entrance, Draco remembered what the password was.
Harry shot one last look at the Map- oh, for the

was inside. From his experience, it was just dust and spiderwebs, anyway. It wasn't until they'd seated themselves as they usually did- Ron and Harry sat facing the far side of the Hall, the Ravenclaw and Slytherin Tables, with Hermione opposite them facing the Hufflepuff table, that Harry even noticed anything was wrong. "Guys, does it seem- quieter than usual?" Hermione asked.
Draco was pretty much seething. The old man must've known Potter was there all along! He glanced at Severus, to see if he was just as angry as Draco, but he was- he was
"Well, aside from the potion itself, I get to miss some classes."
"Yeah, that one. It's for the Elixir."
? Ring any bells?"
He told himself he didn't miss anyone's cooking.
"Thank you," Draco whispered back. "But I think it needs a little something more, and I wasn't sure what."
Maybe- no, he couldn't stoop that low. Preposterous! Asking for help from a- but she'd probably read every book the library held and stowed its information in her head... It would be like asking a house elf for help! They were supposed to help!
They returned to their seats with their hot chocolates as Draco waited (quite chivalrously, if he did say so himself) for Harry to finish. As he waited, he made a few other tiny snowmen, like the ones Pansy had made before. He arranged those by the base of the snowman as he waited. When Potter was finally ready, they both stood back and levitated their snowmen heads up onto the bodies. Draco made sure his was balanced meticulously, then realised he was missing something. The

"Well, what if she could join you?"

rather go to the infirmary than write one of those.
The students all jolted backwards in shock, chairs scraping across the floor, while McGonagall moved slowly towards Harry. "Mr. Potter?"
It was a dress.
"So, Malfoy, look. A pair of footsteps represent one person. So here, this big black mass," he pointed to what was, indeed, a big black mass, with indecipherable scribbles and scrawls shown at its edges. "That's the Great Hall, with everyone in it. Up here is the teacher's table," he pointed to a rectangle, where a row of footsteps were individually labelled with names. "And we're over- here." He showed Draco two pairs of footsteps, stationary next to the water's edge. The labels read
"What do you want with Hermione, Malfoy?" he growled.
Draco paced in front of the wall, brow furrowed, concentrating on the room he'd settled upon last night. When he looked up, there it was; the large oak door that opened silently, revealing his dream room.
"Oh, no. Harry, what do mean, the Resurrection Stone? I thought you threw that away in the Forbidden Forest?"
, bit ironic you should have a snake at
?! Harry, you trusted him so little you stalked him for all of sixth year!"
Draco was a wizard. Duh.
! He was heading towards... the Quidditch pitches?
Draco stared incredulously at Harry, apparently having been shocked into silence at Harry's response. "
The place reeked of dust, grime, and mothballs. Draco set about making himself a nice cup of tea to drink while he let his mind wander- avoiding any thought of Potter or sixth year or Voldemort or- well, he thought about where he was. This old, abandoned building in muggle London, once a place of magnificent splendour, now a run-down abode devoid of life.
His plants were all in little cute plant pots of varying shades of green and turquoise, hung from little metal hooks in the ceiling on the left of the vast room. The middle was taken up mostly by rows upon rows of desks and equipment; everything Draco had ever dreamed of. To the right of the room was an incredibly large potions cabinet, full of hundreds- if not thousands- of ingredients and simple base potions.
A few minutes of struggling and breathless laughter later, Draco finally turned to Potter and said, "Help."
Neither of those were really able to be concentrated and put in a potion.
for the ferret-faced git. He determined not to even think about Malfoy the rest of the day. Despite this, he still noticed that Malfoy wasn't in classes, and he continued to reassured himself with the conclusion that Malfoy was just skipping or something.

"Ooh, that sounds fun," Pansy (on Draco's right) said. The two shared a little
Draco hesitated, looked at the frozen ground and his frozen hands, then sighed. "Oh, all right then. Let's go get the Weasel."
He tried again. "Pygmy Puffs. Pygmy Puffs! Fluffy little pygmy puffs! Pink pygmy puffs, purple pygmy puffs, blue pygmy puffs- oh, Salazar, we're stuck."
He rose with the sun, praying that the mandrake had awoken, too; alas, when Draco returned to the potions area of the Room, he found the Mandrake still sleeping peacefully.
With another swish of his wand, Draco sent the army hurtling at Blaise, who yelped and tried to run from them- honestly, what an
And he thanks him. It's the first time he has ever truly thanked somebody and meant it.
"Oh, the old Black house?" Parkinson asked.
As she went over and purchased it, Granger gave Draco a once-over. Draco had the strangest feeling he was being examined- or maybe tested. "Not bad, Malfoy," she said as Pansy returned to them. "Not bad."
This is the last chapter of the fic! Thank you for reading, and I hope you've enjoyed it.
McGonagall was letting him do all this experimenting because she didn't like the victims of the war having nightmares so much; if he told her he thought he'd made progress, he was sure she'd go easy on him. Not that McGonagall ever went easy on anybody.
Draco's eyes took on a dangerous glint. "You... you want me to say--
. He stepped out onto the courtyard and chaos erupted.
Not terrible for a Gryffindor.
He burst into McGonagall's room, barely sparing her an apology for his interruption before he whipped around to face Snape.
Throughout his first seven years at Hogwarts, Draco would unload these facts on his parents, especially during the holidays. (However, if he added a new fact to his repertoire, he would definitely owl it home.) Thus, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy had an extensive knowledge on Harry Potter. From how he liked his tea, to what he ate when in a certain mood, to spots in Hogwarts he frequented when he had nightmares, to what precise shade of green his eyes were (and the fact that they seemed to lighten and darken in certain moods. Draco had declared that no artist could fully capture their proper liveliness and brightness; so, of course, Draco had had to give it a shot. He'd taken up art sometime in fourth year, after the success of the "Potter Stinks" badges. He'd picked it up surprisingly fast; he dropped it, though, when he decided that even
Draco had decided he would make the Stone down by the Lake. He levitated all his plants and potions, all except Viv (who he carried), down to the spot Harry went when he had nightmares. He sort of hoped Harry would be there already, or would come down later.
As Draco was about to retort, Granger came bustling in. "Ron, no, don't worry, it's fine. What is it, Malfoy?" Stepping away from the wall and subtly rubbing at his neck, he gave Granger a nod of thanks.

"Are you- are you pouting?" Harry asked incredulously. Draco ignored him.

He pushed his weight towards the nose of the broom, saw something flash out of the air a few metres above him- a hand, coming out of thin air? Reaching towards him?- felt the very tail bristles of his broom sweep the ground- and he was off!
"I was going to get potions ingredients, as a matter of fact."
Draco's shields wouldn't last much longer; especially not with Draco sleep-deprived, stressed and already weakened by fear. Something needed to happen for the two to escape with their lives.
alright, Draco?"
, darling, it just doesn't work. Now, where's my money?"
When the two had managed to organise themselves, they took in their surroundings.
He didn't notice how much lighter the cauldrons seemed as he arranged them; he didn't realise that there was more than just his magic arranging everything.
(See the end of the chapter for

And the snake- still unrestrained, still free- slithers towards Draco slowly; he bends down, lets the barest tips of his fingers brush across its body. It rises, head arching up to meet Draco's arm, and Draco freezes. The snake doesn't stop, though- it keeps going until it is entirely wrapped around Draco's forearm- Potter was right, it really couldn't be longer than his forearm- and Draco is shaking and tense and

"What does the whole inscription mean?"
! Of course not! He's just- hard to miss, is all, what with that mess of black hair and those bright green eyes-"
He lowered himself to the ground. He kept up the glamours, the concealment charms that hid the little cylinder of space he used to practice this stunt, but added some silencing charms, around his little bubble of space as his feet touched solid ground.
Flamel clapped his hands and rose from his chair in front of the fireplace. "Lovely, just lovely. Yes, I have the recipe for my Stone just over here-" he walked over to the mantelpiece and picked up a framed photo; he took out the photo and showed Draco the recipe on the back. It was a messily-written list of ingredients followed by a method; Draco stepped forwards to take a cursory glance over it and Flamel snatched it back. "The Resurrection Stone, please," he said, holding out his hand. Draco went to reach into his pocket and withdraw the Stone when he realised- he didn't have it. Potter did.
The Golden Trio had somehow ended up in front of Draco when the students were picking seats. Well, not really. They'd arrived late to the class and the seats in front of Draco were the only ones left unoccupied (no one else was brave enough to sit in front of Draco, which he'd decided to take as a compliment). Now, Granger (sat in front of Blaise, a table over on Draco's left) stuck her hand up and asked, "Miss,"- Draco noticed the distinctly missing title of "
. Who went into the potion?
Maybe they are the opposite, and maybe they compliment each other perfectly.
"Okay," Harry said, "I tell you who gave me the potions, and you'll give me anything I want?"
"So, we'll need an actual floo where we preferably won't be interrupted."
Even before the war, Harry was damaged; the Dursleys had abused Harry in so many ways, leaving him physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred. Even now, after killing the Dark Lord, he would subconsciously flinch when someone raised their hand at him, expecting to be hit. People noticed, of course, but never mentioned it; Harry's friends would scowl and mentally curse the Dursleys for what they'd done.
It had been going fine. As fine as could be expected in the circumstances, really- Draco was doing better in his classes than he'd expected, even with most of the newer teachers almost entirely against him; he suspected he might even be able to pass exams at the end of the year.
Pretty sure.
When Parkinson and Zabini identified where he was headed, they both immediately began backing up, shouting, "Weasley, what are you
How come it always Harry watching him leave?
"I will be," Draco called back, already walking away.
When he was on the last step- 'stir clockwise slowly seven times, and then wave your wand to complete the potion. It should take on a shimmery violet tint'- he decided to add a few Lacewing Flies, because why not? He knew Lacewing Flies were usually used in Polyjuice potions, but other items in the Sleeping draught caused things like poisoning, inflammation, and death, but instead just sent the imbiber to sleep. An ingredient of Polyjuice potion couldn't do much harm, right?
Things like jumping at a sudden noise didn't seem quite so funny anymore.
Flamel's eyes lit up. "Yes, yes, yes. I sent Beedle ideas on how to improve the Resurrection stone, but he ignored me. But, theoretically, they would work on the actual stone perfectly... Where is this stone, Potter? Bring it to me, prove it works, and leave me with it, and I will tell you how to make the Philosopher's stone."
fault.
Draco, whose mind had been on trying to get the Elixir of Life, was sufficiently distracted. "That's the plan. Although it is a little shaky, what with the potion and all..."
Harry had knelt, and he was slightly shaking; Draco was reminded, suddenly, of how Harry had looked before he'd broken down at Grimmauld Place. It'd been somewhat like this.
Draco went back and forth between the more positive mindset of

Potter for hours on end.
Then he saw his hair; almost-but-not-quite messy, and soft to the touch. Finally, he noticed his face- or, rather, what Pansy had done to his face.
"You're not inviting me," Pansy said. "
He asked Jiskey to notify him exactly two days after the potion would normally be done (you could never be too safe).
"Still," Pansy adds appraisingly, "Very cunning- very, very cunning. You analysed Draco's reaction, predicted his answers, and entirely changed your approach to antagonise him into doing what you wanted." She pauses, as if really realising how that is a
That's when Harry ran.
He was smiling again, looking at Draco- mirror-Draco- with a stupidly lovesick expression; mirror-Draco smiled back. He looked happier than Draco had been in years. Real-Draco frowned at the sight.
, Potter!
Hermione groaned. "You could have all infiltrated us and found us during the war- and the Order- and even Siriu-" she started saying, but Ron interrupted before she could wind herself up too much.
He wouldn't be getting back to sleep tonight. He pulled out the map, too; Filch was roaming the castle tonight, which ruled out wandering the corridors- oh, for God's
Draco drew Granger outside with surprisingly little commotion; no one else had seen him in the portrait-hole entrance to the lion's den. Then she started struggling. "Malfoy! Let go!" He looked down and realised he was still holding her wrist, where he'd grabbed her to pull her outside. He let go like she was burning him, wiping his hand discreetly on his robes. Maybe he didn't think mud- muggleborns were as fully below him as he'd previously thought, but they were still repulsive. It was hard to make new opinions that went against all he'd ever known. He was trying, though. And then there was the fact that on top of the blood status, this was Granger! But he didn't want to offend her; he needed her knowledge.
“Now wipe some of it on your chin and your face.” Harry showed Draco where to put the foam. “You can wash the rest off. Now pick up the razor and turn the vibrator on. It helps to raise the hairs off the skin. Now drag it gently over your face, not too slow, but not too quick either.” Draco did what he was told but screamed “OW!” as the razor cut his skin.
“Is this another one of those Muggle things?”
Nott took his place at one end and 20 feet away stood Baddock, both boys with wands drawn at the ready.
‘Is safely locked away in Azkaban.’ interjected Dumbledore, stopping the boy mid-rant. ‘Although I am sure that he would be intrigued to read the note that you sent me Draco.’ Those bright blue eyes pierced into Draco’s grey ones and again seemed to dampen down the building rage with the not too veiled threat. ‘May I sit?’ Dumbledore’s tone lightening slightly.
“It's not your birthday, it's not my birthday, it's not our anniversary, so what are we celebrating?” Draco drawled in his best Lord of the Manor voice.
Barely a moment later he reappeared, standing at the end of a row of grotty looking terraced houses. Glancing briefly down at the sign “Spinner’s End” he strode off up the street in search of his final destination; the house at the very end of the row. There was no real need to knock, very few people even very few wizards were able to see that this house even existed, but it was always polite to observe social niceties. Dumbledore rapped smartly on the wooden front door and felt it open at the third knock.

Draco never ceased to find those names amusing, what a wonderful coincidence that Claude married Claudette.
“Are you Harry James Potter?” the figure asked.
Draco practically launched himself at his husband when he got home from work.
“Oh I have so many ways you can make it up to me. Go get the strawberry ice cream.”
“Hello there,” said Harry, planting a chaste kiss on Draco’s lips. “What‘s got you so excited?”
“Draco, your knowledge of rubbish Muggle music astounds me, but this is not 911, it’s 9/11. 11th September 2001.”
This is a new fic, my first in a VERY long time (over a decade, wow!)
There was no window in his cell; no way of telling the time. He slept and he ate when food arrived, never making the mistake of leaving the plate unattended for a few minutes. The food disappeared and left him achingly hungry until the next meal. He even relaxed his standards to use the bucket although thankfully the contents vanished at once after use.
might make me do something I'd regret later. Although, every morning I regret drinking a whole bottle of Firewhisky.
‘You must forgive my rudeness Draco.’ Draco’s hand moved to grip the back of the nearest chair, expecting to be offered a seat. But before he could reach it, Dumbledore’s arm whirled through the air and Draco heard the old man cry,
Draco was stunned, how could Potter possibly suspect him already? He barely registered that Potter and his cronies had followed him at Diagon Alley that summer and that the mudblood had even gone into Borgin and Burkes after him. He only realised how tense he was when he heard McGonagall tell Potter all about his detention, effectively giving him an alibi for the whole thing. He skulked off into the shadows just in time to see the office empty and McGonagall prowl off towards the hospital wing.
“Harry, I’m not going to die. Do you not think that as a wizard serving in the Muggle armed forces I have a distinct advantage in protecting myself?”
He let his mind drift away from his body, wander away from the study to dwell on the young man. Where he was, the old man could not be sure. Oh he could guess, of course, but never be actually certain. The minutes rolled by and still the old man pondered.
“Sorry, love, I just want to get this done. We are celebrating after all.”
Draco’s detention with McGonagall was predictably dull. She lectured him for a full ten minutes on the importance of not falling behind so early on in his N.E.W.T. work, before forcing him to sit at a desk and complete the missing homeworks. She did not seem to grasp the idea of detentions, Draco thought. They were supposed to be awful, a punishment, a deterrent. Snape’s detentions were legendary, disgusting manual labour usually involving rotten potions ingredients. Even Dumbledore knew how they were supposed to work, having sent him with the Gryffindorks into the Forbidden Forest back in first year. But McGonagall was just a push over, she walked around with her nose in the air acting like everyone but her precious lion cubs was beneath her contempt. He sat there working on other homework, having completed his Transfiguration work quickly. He had vaguely hoped that if he handed her the completed work quickly that she might let him go sooner. But she had taken it from him and motioned back towards his solitary desk to continue working.
‘I didn’t want...They made me...Held me down.’ his chest heaved as he struggled to speak every word, tears cascading down his face now. Draco looked up at his headmaster and beseeched him to believe. Instead, he held out his hand to the boy.
Finally discovering the identity of his “captors” did not quell the upsurge of rage in Draco’s chest. He turned to face Snape, the man who was supposed to be his godfather, his protector.
‘Good evening, Draco.’

Merry Christmas, Mr Tibbles
Draco leaned in towards Harry’s face, but winced as his face came in contact with Harry’s glasses. He reached up and removed the obstruction, before continuing on to kiss Harry gently on the lips.
‘Well Severus? Why am I here?’
Screaming Infidelities

By the time that Halloween came around Draco was thoroughly miserable. He was getting weekly requests for updates from his contacts outside of the castle and he was really no further along with his mission to fix the Vanishing Cabinet. Montague had proved to be useless with regards to information on how it actually worked after his extended period stuck in the blasted contraption the year previously. Draco was spending an increasing amount of time in the Room of Requirement, books spread out at his feet just trying to understand how the magic of the cabinet worked.
“I am very impressed that you came to this conclusion so quickly, Draco. I had rather expected to have to guide you to this epiphany step by step. As a male descendant of the House of Black, it is indeed possible that the title is now yours. There are two tests that we can perform to ascertain if you are right. Firstly, you should be able to correctly write down the address of the London residence of the House of Black. Secondly, you should be able to summon the remaining family house-elf, Kreacher. Shall we try that now?” Dumbledore reached under his desk and drew up parchment, quill and ink before sliding them over to Draco.
“So why did the Mormons leave? What did I do?”
“I know that, Draco, but it's American.”
‘The Headmaster is waiting, Draco, you will return within an hour through the same passageway. No one will know where you have been. If anyone asks, you are having additional lessons with me, it will not be difficult to convince your classmates that we are doing work for the Dark Lord.’
‘Now young Mister Malfoy,’ Dumbledore switched into a much more business like voice, ‘how might we assist you?’
The note requested a meeting, it was very likely to be a trap, or at the least some sort of trick, but if it was genuine he had to know. He had to find out.
“Well that would be an outrage, it would start a war and we’d hunt them down.”
“Not that bad?! I’m ugly.” Draco finally lost his temper and waved his wand in a series of movements from Harry’s neck down to his feet whilst saying “
“What on earth makes you think that?” Hermione said.
“OK, but if anything goes wrong like the time when you lost the keys to the handcuffs and left our wands downstairs, I’ll kill you.”
Author's notes: Draco has a run-in with some rather odd people.
There it is. I saw it. You aren't happy. You are just pretending. I can see it in your face, even if I can't see it in your eyes. You get dragged away by
‘I needed to assess your true intentions. I am satisfied that your change of sides is genuine.’ Dumbledore’s calm and level voice just irritated Draco more.
Draco signed the letter, rolled it up tight and tapped it with his wand. A wax seal bloomed from the end to seal the scroll shut.
“I knew it!”

Whilst Kudos is lovely, comments go a long way to keep me motivated to keep writing this
“This thing that’s long, thin, red and has a flat-looking end.”
‘And will you, to the best of your ability, assist the Order of the Phoenix in bringing about the end of Lord Voldemort?’
The young man had no way of knowing if his message had found its way to the old man, the stupid old man who was now his only hope, the only one he could turn to for help. He couldn't be sure if the old man would come. He could only hope.
Fifteen minutes later, Draco dropped the razor in the sink for the last time.
“Oh, I think that says it all.”
‘Thank you, Draco.’ A smile played across Snape’s face, something which very few students had ever seen him do before.
They manage to get an interview with you. You're drunk. I stare at your face looking deeply in to your bright blue eyes for some sign that you're unhappy. Hold on. You have green eyes. You must have finally bought those coloured contacts. I'm glad you kept your hair black though. You look good. But then again you always looked good.
“So what you’re telling me is that you two have been shagging like bunnies all summer?” Harry was getting rather annoyed and definitely starting to feel like the third wheel on a bicycle.
“Wow, this place is just, wow!”
“Good evening and hello. Welcome to all you first years, welcome back to all you second years and above. This year I have a small number of administrative matters to handle before we eat. This year Professor Snape has contracted an illness that will prevent him from teaching until the end of the year.” A contented murmur went around the room with just a small groan from the remarkably empty Slytherin table. “However, the illness is a touch contagious, so if any of you think you have seen Professor Snape walking into my office or into the potions lab, then you are hallucinating,” Dumbledore said, with just a slight giggle. “We have a new member of staff joining us. He is neither a professor nor part of the ground staff. He is my live-in advisor.” A small cough preceded his last statement. “Please welcome Mr Anthony Donis.” A young attractive-looking man with flowing blonde hair and a visible six-pack under his tight Muggle clothes stood up. A few of the older girls swooned slightly.
Potter slipped into his seat just as the main course vanished and was replaced by dessert. Draco reached for his favourite chocolate fudge cake and completely forgot all about the Boy Who Lived as he poured single cream over his cake. Draco didn’t usually indulge too much whilst at school even with all that food on offer. He idly wondered why so many more students weren’t fat like Crabbe and Goyle. Chocolate fudge cake liberally coated in cream was his one food weakness though. He could never turn it down and it usually appeared right in front of him regardless of which seat he sat in at feasts. Draco blocked out all the noise and barely even opened his eyes as he ate, focusing as much as he could on the sense of taste at the expense of his other senses.
Once some of the hubbub had died down, Draco eased himself off the wooden bench to lead the Slytherin 6th and 7th years back down to the Snake pit, their common room deep in the dungeons. The handful of older students took all of the best leather armchairs which were scattered around the outer edge of the room and as they arrived, all the other students were directed to take seats on the floor; the well established procedure for a house meeting.
The third letter was similar but much shorter.
Prompt words provided: snow, cranberry, lovely, preoccupied, obstruction.
“If I may, Headmaster?” The silky voice came from behind Draco causing him to spin on the spot and see that Snape had silently followed him down the passage. Dumbledore nodded his assent for Snape to talk.
They both bounded into the bedroom, all thoughts of Voldemort and war long forgotten.
He trudged out of the doors, not even feeling Potter’s eyes boring into the back of his head as he left the Great Hall.
Draco, stood under the tree, wrapped up like a present, grinned at him. "Merry Christmas, Harry," he said.
you? You
intelligent Gryffindors! "Yeah, it is. Took me ages to master it."
Harry blinked. "You- what?"
Draco felt his hand going sticky, and then the warmth of Potter's hand seemed to increase tenfold. Draco snatched his wand with his other hand, pointed at his throat, and thought the counter-curse for the silencing charm as forcefully as he could. He then whirled on Pansy, who was now stood, triumphantly. "Pansy, you
that place?"
For once in his life, Potter had perfect timing. "Hey, Ron, 'mione. Malfoy. It's okay, Ron; you can trust him."
"Mother! What's the time? Don't you need to get back to the Manor? By the way, how were you even let out? I only fainted, it's nothing too serious."
Draco stepped onto the stairs; he felt Potter's eyes on him the whole time he ascended, until the gargoyle moved back and blocked his view.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Alright, alright. So, yeah, Potter had a nightmare. Doesn't make him special, though," Draco added. "I had a nightmare too."
The potion finally finished.
"Potter, you're kidding me." Draco said- or tried to. His mouth open, but no sound came out. Bloody Pansy.
Where to go?
! Ugh, you're
Maybe they both realise how bigoted and prejudiced they were as children, and finally realise that everyone is just as human as everyone else, and everyone has their problems, and maybe the best thing to do is to just treat everyone equally; spare them one more problem.
When they walked into the Great Hall the next morning, there was an uproar.
The arms around his waist fell again, and it hit Harry. He was in Draco's room. Sat on Draco's bed. With Draco. And his first impression had been that he was
"I'm sorry about the war; I'm sorry about you having to choose between your family and being a murderer and dying. I'm sorry I didn't try to offer you help of protection or any other way you could have escaped.
"Not with Pansy," he said.
I finished," he amended. Blaise took one look at Draco and groaned.
Draco laughed harder, doubling over and wheezing.
Harry's head jerked a little, and Draco heard a muffled "What?"
Potter didn't spare him a glance, but shouted, "What are you doing?" as Draco cast the spell again. And again, until the two were surrounded by a writhing mass of serpents.
Malfoy made his way up the stairs, oblivious to Harry's unbelieving expression. When he was nearly at the top, he turned back to see Harry, gaping up at him. "Nice view, Potter?" he whispered. Potter's mouth snapped shut and he started hissing something at Malfoy, stepping up onto the staircase-
that untrustworthy? ...Well, yes, but that's not the point. Honestly, you do one thing once and no one lets you forget it. Was that what it was like to be Potter? Draco hated it.
"Hey yourself," he said. "I'm getting dizzy. Give me my wand." A house elf immediately appeared; it grabbed Harry's wand and passed it to Draco.
"I'm sorry for judging and hating your family, for being so quick to hate you. I'm sorry for believing in one opinion I heard and hating a whole quarter of Hogwarts because of it.
The door opened with the quiet chime of a bell, nearly drowned out by the animals' various squawks and squeals. It chimed again, a while later, and Draco left with a cage in his hands. He sent it back to his dorm room with a flick of his wand, concealing and protecting it with a few charms. The pet inside would be fine with its auto-replenishing food and water supply.

"Don't wake them up," she hissed at him.

"Well, they're used in the Dreamless sleep potion. Closest thing to flowers I had on hand, and I wanted something to distract you so I could get you out here to talk about Flamel."
The wolves were on the boys almost immediately. The personal repellent wards the two had around them didn't extend far enough to affect the wolves, so only the physical shields were acting against them.

, Draco thought at himself,
, the calmer half of Harry thought. The other half was hysterical with fear.
"Fat lot of help you are," Draco muttered under his breath. "Potter knows about memories and pensieves, Draco, you should take Potter along, he can help you. Meddling old codger, Potter's bloody useless," he continued as he made his way around the house, looking for open windows or other ways to enter. He returned to Potter without finding another way of entering. "Well, Potter, don't just stand there. Do something. How do we get in?" An idea struck him. He loved having fun, and this was a prime opportunity. "Oh, maybe we
The two stepped into Gryffindor common room. The lights were out, the windows shut against the cold air. The fireplace was empty, and without it, the place looked almost unwelcoming; barren, devoid of life. Cold. Empty.
He was unbelievably close to bursting with rage.

"Wait, Draco," Hermione said, "You succeeded?"
The two didn't speak to each other the rest of the night as they got themselves ready for and into bed.
"Mr. Potter," she said, and Potter groaned again, hanging his head in defeat, "Have you-
Potter blinked owlishly. "What?"
The next three months passed in a blur. There were fights, obviously, and smaller arguments, and even one near-duel; a few jelly-legs jinxes, too, but most against common enemies of the boys.
Draco turned to him. "Weasley, we spent over

"-nd then I was thinking that I needed to buy some more clothes for me," she was saying.
"But- Snape killed Dumbledore- I haven't defeated Snape-"
Draco felt himself melting, and suddenly that Pansy he seemed to have in his mind spoke up- she said, "Doesn't seem like you hate him very much. In fact, I might even say you like him. Perhaps," she added, "as more than a friend." The fact that Draco didn't argue back was an answer enough for her.
Oh, Severus would be
By the time he and Potter's body had reached the small abode, the sun had risen considerably, its rays now warming the frozen ground, chasing away the coldness of the night.
But Draco watched Harry and grew closer as he got better and better, became the Harry the stories told of; happy, skilled, smart. Not the broken husk of himself he'd been for the first 6 months after the war. Better.
"The next step is to start adding people, for your purposes, I think," Draco told him. "You want to relax, right? Have a place you can get away to? Well, wouldn't you like your friends there? And you could add dead people- like Diggory, or Lupin, or that godfather of yours. If you know them well enough, you can add them. You could even add your parents."
) but Draco grabbed her frame carefully, stopping her from trying to hurt herself any more.
Draco turned around.
Harry rushed over, and then stood there uselessly. He didn't know the counter-curse.
The next day, even more students moved.
"Well. what do
"Guys, lay off Harry," Hermione told the group.
Harry walked over to the staircases. He gestured to the one on the left, indicating that Granger was up there. He stepped back to let Malfoy go first. He remembered the fact that the staircases turned into slides if a boy tried to go up them; he smirked to himself as Malfoy passed him. This would be brilliant.
, Malfoy. The night of the Battle of Hogwarts, I died. You can ask your own mother- she's the one who told that to Voldemort himself."
"Right, so, have you ever heard of Nicholas Flamel?" he began. He didn't at all expect her to physically flinch away from him.
Slowly, the Weasleys stopped coming daily. It was every other day, then once a week; then once a fortnight, once a month. They were, however, there for Draco's favourite moment of all time.

Choosing the Room as the new location had been difficult and yet easy; the idea, when it came upon him, immediately struck him as obvious and safe and easy. Choosing to willingly face what had happened there before had not been. But he ended up avoiding all of the trauma linked to this room, caught up in the places he ended up creating.
A bit late, I know, I know, but we're nearing the end now! Merry late Christmas to you all and thank you!
. . .
By this point, students inside the school had started coming out to have a look at the snowman-building competition; the younger muggleborns were delighting in the snow, making their own snowmen and snow-angels. The older ones appeared to have started a mass snowfight, with small teams of all houses and years popping up and making truces until two large ones remained; the more experienced wizards and witches had constructed a small snow fort on one side of the appointed battlefield, while the other appeared to have begun a snowball factory, passing snowballs along to the best throwers, who took aim and shot at any head that peaked above the enemy's fortress. Ron and Blaise were betting on who would win, laughing and cheering and commenting to each other about spectacular techniques and shots and hits.
Except- if they were mirrors, why couldn't Draco see himself? And how could all of the mirror-Harrys be facing him, when the real one turned in circles, staring at the walls? Draco noticed, absently, that Harry's eyes widened as he watched the mirror, and his hand went to his pocket.
wanted by the other boy. Maybe years of studying how the other thinks, moves and acts pays off when they see the reactions of the other.
"No, but have you ever been to the headmaster's office?"
ready to deal with this right now, not when he could feel Malfoy's gaze on him, not when his broom was underneath him and ready to go, not when he was itching for a game of Quidditch to chase away the nightmares of forests and curses and flashes of green and red, blood and death, red snake eyes and serpents and swords and a station, entirely white, empty of trains and devoid of life- Harry slipped off of his broom onto the grass, curling in on himself. He felt his breathing accelerating; distantly heard his own gasps for air. He could feel his blood, pounding through his body, could hear his heart in his ears.
. As is I would say that on recording!"
But he
The three made their way back to Hogwarts at a leisurely pace; the noise wasn't dying down, and didn't seem like it would for a while.
Draco went through many different versions of himself.
First things first- where had Draco gone? Where would he have gone? Somewhere away from Harry, somewhere he thought Harry couldn't find him... Somewhere under a Fidelius charm, then? Unplottable, too. Being who he was, he probably wanted comfort... His father was in Azkaban, and his mother was at Malfoy Manor, where Draco would know Harry would go to look. So Harry mentally crossed Malfoy Manor off the list of places Draco could be.
Harry grinned. "Well, if Pomfrey hears about me flying through Hogwarts without a broom and not going to her she'll have a right go at me," he said.
Behind them, Blaise, Pansy, Ron and Hermione all smiled at the sight of their joined hands.
!)) make up for the mistakes of his childhood, ((Alright, yeah, I sucked.) I Like this bit though. This is when you sent out those 8-bloody-page-long apology letters, isn't it? (I had a lot to apologise for.) Well, they worked, if this is anything to go by.) who worked hard and did well ((Damn right I did.))
, then. Draco schooled his face into the indifferent Malfoy Mask he had perfected over the years. He feared what his face would show if he didn't.
That would mean that the drinker would eventually build up a tolerance, and either have to deal with the nightmares, or use a far stronger form of sleeping potion. The stronger ones were all also ridiculously addictive, so the user would basically become an addict... All because of one ml of unicorn's blood?
? But then again, Harry was in his ratty old pyjamas from Dudley, finally fitting a little better but still not quite right around the waist, and his newest jumper from Mrs. Weasley, a pretty burgundy with a golden H. Very, very Gryffindor, and very, very pretty. Really comfortable, too.
" And, as one, they turned and left the hall, still reprising their little song and laughing drunkenly, although one stopped on the way out to vomit.
"I needed you for the information about the Stone. When I withheld from telling Potter earlier, it was because I didn't know I needed information so badly. If I
Draco himself, however, was still trying to puzzle out what he was seeing. He turned away from Harry, back to the mirror, and noticed that as he moved, mirror-Harry did too. Huh.
Draco whacked his head down onto the desk, and looked mournfully at his hand, joined with Potter's. "It takes one month to brew, approximately, and another four to sit until it's non-toxic enough to drink," he groaned. Potter groaned along with him.
He was entirely unaware of Ron
Maybe it's a little strange to be on the same side.
He started making his way up to Gryffindor tower.
The list didn't end up being anywhere near as long as Draco thought it would be. And, as he wrote it, he realised how many of his personas bled together when faced with a specific situation.
our hair?
"I do not!"
Flat, barren plains, bits of rubble scattered here and there, concrete patches worn and melted into dirt and dust. Heat seemed to radiate off of it, engulfing Draco where he stood.
Blaise, Ron and Hermione had waited for the trio; they'd stopped on the grassy- well, snowy now- area next to the Black Lake. Ronald was lying down on the snow, spreading his arms and legs at the instruction of Hermione, it seemed; Blaise was watching and adding commentary. When Draco got within hearing range, Blaise said, "We're making snow angels!"
"Couldn't agree more," Pansy said. "Well, now, Blaise; time for you to pay up. C'mon, c'mon, don't be shy." At Hermione and Ron's twin looks of confusion, she smirked and said, "Blaise and I had a little bet. He thought they'd stay oblivious to each other until Christmas; I thought they would get together before that. And, as you can see," she said, gesturing towards the boys disappearing into the castle together, "I was right. Oh, Blaise, don't try to cheat me, you cheapskate. That's leprechaun gold. That's the
Draco sunk down to the floor in despair as Weasley joined Potter in laughing his head off.
Potter returned halfway through the second day.
too familiar. Harry was pretty sure he had spent countless hours staring at this very snitch. Just to be sure, he pressed his lips against it.
The boys entered the office together about five minutes later, grumbling at each other and both nursing many bruises.
"How do you produce the Elixir of Life from the Philosopher's Stone?"
It had barely even been five minutes when a head of messy black hair rounded the corner. Draco raised an eyebrow. "Couldn't even leave me alone for five minutes, Potter?" There was a strange, slight flush creeping up Potter's neck.
If Harry had happened to look over, for him the post-it note would've read, "Quidditch practice on Wednesday!" For everyone else, however, it read, "How long can you get Harry to talk about DM?" and underneath that, "Record: Over 7 hours".
Draco lowered himself, swinging off the edge of the platform and landing gracefully on his feet. He looked up to see Harry, looking straight back at him. But then Harry spoke, and Harry's mouth moved, but his voice came from behind Draco.
"Keep that in mind. I'm going to walk you through some breathing techniques. Keep your eyes closed, and remember that happy memory.
"Yeah, I thought so too, but I wasn't sure... Are there a lot of people off? We're in winter now, so maybe there's a cold going around..." Ron replied.
He pointed his wand back inside, and out flew- his broom? He hopped on, and let go of the ledge.
"Pardon?"
about at this time in the morning?
McGonagall breathed a sigh of relief. "No, thank you. That will be all. Please return to your duties." With another crack, Kreacher returned to the kitchens. McGonagall turned to the fireplace. "Grimmauld Place living room," she called, and once the connection was secure, she knelt down and pushed her head through the flames of her office into the still-burning flames at Grimmauld place. And nearly started shouting with joy.
! And may the best Slytherin win."
Draco continued his walk down the aisle, stopping just before he returned to his dressing-room to turn his head back and blow a kiss at the group- or, more specifically, Harry. They locked eyes, and Harry's cheeks turned the most gorgeous shade of russet.
Both then and now, Draco Malfoy's arms had been clutched around his waist.
Oh, Merlin, Harry was
idea. Not right now, though. I was thinking we should put the camera here-" he walked over to the portrait and pointed to the spot on the wall, at eye-level, next to it- "where Draco can clearly see it whenever he decides to come back. And we leave it recording, we all go sleep, comfortable in our dormitories, and tomorrow morning we come back and check the footage. Sound good?" The group nodded. "Cool. G'night, guys. Pansy, I entrust you the task of the sticking charm. Don't press this button here, or it'll stop recording. Right, night night! Sleep tight!"
"The sticking charm?"
Pansy grinned and explained them to him proudly; Hermione watched on, clearly entertained by the purebloods' collective lack of knowledge in this area, while Blaise went to get them all hot chocolate. Harry took Malfoy aside, where there was lots of fresh snow, and showed him how to make the snowball big enough to be a proper snowman. Draco made one about the side of his own head while Harry made one about three times the size to be the body. Draco bit his lip in concentration as he placed the head on the body. Harry sent him off searching for sticks to use as arms while Hermione accio-ed a scarf she'd knitted to go around the snowman's "neck", and Harry went down to the shores of the Black Lake. He returned with two large black pebbles and a handful of little grey and black ones; he put the two large ones into the face as eyes, then arranged the small pebbles in a smile. "Now all we need is a carrot," he said.
! It was night when Harry and Draco had entered the potion. Harry frowned and sat on the bed again, facing the window, and-
you're not a Slytherin?"
? That didn't matter. Well, Draco- it sounded far too natural in Harry's mind- had told Harry that he hadn't, not since the last time Harry had cooked- and then Harry frowned as he remembered feeling incredibly angry at himself, for not making sure Draco was eating. It was, after all, why he'd been cooking lunch for Draco; he got so caught up in his work, he forgot to eat. So Harry had been angry at himself for forgetting to feed Draco, and then he'd seen something new in Draco's eyes. Just a flicker of an emotion, but- what was it? Wait, it wasn't entirely new.
"How about this one?" He asked, holding up a
The second, however, which had received the potion without the unicorn blood... Well, it was still limp. Draco frowned; he'd given it plentiful time to reawaken. He decided to run a few tests to check it was still- you know, alive. Tarantallegra didn't work. Neither did Rennervate. Eventually he cast the diagnostics spell.
Finally, he reached the very last one.
Draco didn't ask why Harry hugged him or thanked him. He didn't want to get into that. He just stood and said, "Come on then, Harry. I need to make sure Jisky actually ate her sandwich."
The cold metal was a shock, but has he pulled away the snitch unfurled its wings in his gloved hands, and the message displayed itself.
Draco realised with a start that he was smiling; this wasn't the antagonising battle of insults he and Potter had engaged in for the past seven years. This was- banter? And almost-friendly banter at that. Standing abruptly from the unbelievably comfy chair, he said, "Well, thank you for your information. I'll go ask Granger for her information and see if I can get any method of getting the Elixir of Life. Goodbye." And he stepped out of the Room of Requirement, heading towards Gryffindor tower once more.
? He used my floo a few hours ago, but has he not returned?"
Draco looked over at the cat again, remembering that McGonagall was a- what was it called? An animagus. She'd shown their year her cat form multiple times over their time at Hogwarts.
Potter's blush deepened, and Draco raised an incredulous eyebrow- and started laughing.
- they were scared of the Mark. He spotted movement to his left, and looked up to see Blaise and Pansy flailing their arms; when they locked eyes with him, they both start wildly gesturing at their forearms, and Draco nearly laughed. They looked absurd. Then he realised he'd surrounded himself in a group of Potter-worshippers, with his mark exposed, could see Potter staring at him, and realised that not only does he not know what to say to Potter, he also didn't know why he was doing this.
for Harry's hand.
"Weasley, I haven't done anything. Potter's probably rocking plants to sleep as we speak and reading them stories. He's fine. Go check on him if you want; you know where he is. He offered, himself, to take care of my plants I need for my project so I could sleep and eat and all that other mundane stuff necessary for living. Terribly inconvenient, but we all need to do it. In any case, he's fine. Say, Granger, how are you?" he added.
"Yeah, how do we win?"
He couldn't show it- he had to be confident, or else nobody would be. They were all following his lead. But he was petrified of losing his friends, his family. When he had seen the Great Hall, teeming with the dead and their loved ones, all he'd wanted to do was sit down and cry. But he couldn't. Merlin, all he wanted was a hug, a promise that everything would be alright. But no one could promise him that. He had to prove it himself.
Oh, sweet Merlin, Draco thought as the tree trunk beneath him was cut cleanly through the middle.
"Yeah," Harry said. "I hope you know that I accept yours, too. Thank you, Draco."
, then you breach the subject of his

It was with this mindset that he passed the next few days.
He thought of a room- a room where Harry's house was now stored- full of items; he thought of mountains of lost things, and of climbing one mountain, watching as flames leaped up at his ankles. He buried his head in the crook of Harry's neck as he thought of an image, burned forever into his mind; a cupboard, going up in flames, as one of his oldest friends watched him leave.
"Oh, come on," Pansy said, "Give her some credit. It will be at least ten."
Maybe they're seen holding hands at one point. Maybe the newspaper article publishers are blackmailed by the boys' friends not to publish anything about it before the boys are ready, and risk tearing this fragile new relationship apart before it has even really begun.
And Potter has the nerve to smirk and say, "I nearly was, you know; if Malfoy hadn't been such a prick- no, wait, not even. If I'd even properly met Malfoy before I met Ron, I'd probably be a Slytherin right now." And Draco wants to cry at the unfairness of it all- if only his younger self had been a bit smarter, a bit quicker,
"Ah. I apologise; I do not know. However, I believe someone in this very room has an item that shows the entire layout of Hogwarts..." She looked at Harry.
"Dumbledore told me he saw himself with a pair of, um, really nice socks.
It was the same blood-red the potion had been, slightly deeper than Harry remembered the first one being, but roughly the same size. It fit comfortably in his fist.
"Yeah," Blaise said. "Pans, Hermione, Ron and I."
"There's already a ship name for Draco and Potter. They're calling them '

Maybe one boy is just as stubborn as ever he has been; maybe this makes the other boy more determined, for he has always wanted what he wasn't allowed to have.
That evening, as Draco was walking down to the dungeons, he and Pansy passed a group of Slytherins, who had been waiting uncomfortably behind a pillar for half an hour for Draco and Pansy to arrive. The group followed them quietly down to the dungeons, not paying much attention to the quiet murmurs of conversation passing between Draco and Pansy.
good about getting the vaults, and having my father watching the whole time smiling, so I asked to meet Hermione in a good mood.) She came back to the little flat the three of us were sharing singing your praises that night, about how you'd changed so much. Ron was devastated when I agreed with her and told him you and I were actually on speaking terms. (Oh, if only I'd been there.) Yeah, you would've

"Draco," Potter said, and Draco got a double shock to his system. Firstly, he'd forgotten Potter was there. He would
Draco's eyebrows slowly rose up his forehead in shock at how violently the public were reacting to his being in the same bloody
When they arrived at the clearing, Weasley glanced around at the floor, then pointed around the clearing and shouted, "
And it was.
"Malfoy is right here, and he can hear you," Draco said. The two ignored him.
Probably the biggest thing Draco did for Harry (and the worst, in Harry's opinion) was go behind his back and open up Grimmauld Place to Harry's friends and family. He owled the Weasleys, and less than 15 minutes later, they all arrived, covered in soot, in the very sparse living room, bringing with them the friendly Weasley chatter and excitement, and awakening Harry, who had been planning to sleep until midday. Harry had bounded down the stairs, believing there to be an intruder, and was suddenly face-to-face with the people he'd been avoiding for so long. He turned around, apparated to his room, and locked the door. He didn't come back out till the next day, during which he found that the Weasleys (and Draco and Hermione) had cleaned the entirety of Grimmauld place (except Harry's room and Sirius'), had managed the heroic feat of removing the screeching portrait of Walburga Black, and even changed a couple of the Slytherin-green drapes into royal purples. The group, having stayed the night in various guest rooms, emerged the next day to find Harry, sobbing on the kitchen floor, in front of the fridge, which had been covered in hundreds of pictures of Lily, James, Sirius, Remus, Hedwig, Fred, and so many more. They retreated quietly, with small smiles on their faces. They'd been so loud coming downstairs, believing Harry to be sound asleep in his room, they knew Harry must've heard them. But he didn't run. He was improving. (Barely, but still. Improving.)
I dressed? I put the rest of you lot to shame.) Nobody else was with you enough to notice, we all hated you. (...I suppose.))
That's what made Draco look up, almost guilty at having been caught reading children's books to a plant. "Um... Nothing," he said, hiding the book behind his back. Harry grinned at him in a sort of "You're hopeless," kind of way. Before he could say anything, Draco saw movement at the edge of his peripheral. His eyes shot to it; the mandrake, seeming to stretch in the sun. It was awake.
"Hey, 'mione. Sorry to wake you up."
He had setbacks, obviously. One day someone thought it was a good idea to take Harry to Godric's Hollow, and he'd completely lost himself to a flashback of Nagini, of Voldemort, Hermione- he'd disapparated back to Grimmauld place in a wild panic, and (after shooting the group a glare) Draco, Ron and Hermione did too. No one quite knows why Draco went, but he did. And he watched as Ron slowly brought Harry back, Hermione staying far away in hopes of not being caught up in the flashback (she'd been a part of it, after all), and Draco learned how to bring Harry back from one of his flashbacks. The next time one happened, he marched up to Harry, and brought him back with the gentlest voice anyone had ever heard emerge from the the great Draco Malfoy. When Harry re-emerged, he broke down into gasping sobs, and Draco held him the entire time. Harry started speaking to Draco a bit after that. Molly watched the two with an affectionate grin.
!!!" did the trick) before dragging them (still half-asleep and in pyjamas) down to the Great Hall, where the eighth-years had requested a large, communal Christmas tree.
As the sky turned the bloodthirsty colour of fiendfyre, Draco was thrown violently into the past.
The last paragraph had confused Draco to no end.
Well,
"Potter doesn't know enough, and he suggested I bring my last query to you."
had said that about himself, revealed such a weakness, if he'd remembered someone was listening.

Harry didn't smile like Draco was the light of his life.
, Draco supposed.
"Right. What's the, er, wand movement?"
Draco moved her wand aside slowly. "Potter's in the common room. We need you."
"I followed you down here," Harry said, "After I saw this. You went down, and then loads more writing just appeared on the page. So I came down too."
"Hmm... Yes, I could."
"I know about the dreams, you still sleep talk, Blaise says-"

know? I bet you do. Who is it?" someone asked.
Potter adjusted his stance slightly; his left foot moved backwards and pivoted him so he was facing the forest. He raised his wand, too, crouched down but head up, eyes trained on the pack. When he spoke, his voice was quiet but strong.
Harry said, "Well, a person who has asked me not to reveal their identity sent me these last night. They're Dreamless Sleep potions, except not addictive."
Maybe they appear back at the school, after many years, wearing smiles and glowing with happy contentment, and maybe they grow old together, in love. Maybe they have their fights and their differences, and maybe they learn to overcome them.
"'Not up to standard' from you, Draco, is still better than the average of one Hermione Granger. That won't be a problem, especially given your reasoning. May I ask what specifically is happening now for you to need more time on your Dreamless Sleep potion?"

"But... why should I? This won't benefit me in any way. I'm only a memory now- literally. I am in the history books, I don't need money, I'm safe and happy... Why should I help you?"

Potter watched them go, frowned, turned fully around, and asked Draco, "What's the incantation for the sticking charm, again?"
Maybe they stay with each other the whole time, lending and taking strength as they need it.
; and he would continue on with his life, quite happily. Unfortunately, things never could go the way Draco planned.
She looked up at him with wide eyes, which slowly filled with tears under Draco's gaze. "Oh, Young Master Draco," she said, her voice quivering. "Jisky is so very sorry! Jisky never meant to go so long without food, but Jisky was just so worried about Young Master in Hogwarts, and Jiskey couldn't eat, not when Jisky's Young Master was away and maybe hurting!"
"The shields and wards around here."
He turned away.
Oh, it would take forever to search the library...
Harry threw an arm around Draco's waist, and let go of the broom. He held himself firmly against it with his legs, pulling Draco towards him and helping him onto it.
Immediately, without his permission, his mouth opened, and he choked out two words, interrupting Harry's rant. "I'm sorry," he said. And just like that, a river of words came rushing out; everything he'd ever thought, ever wanted to say to Harry, to try and make things better. "I'm sorry for insulting you and your parents and the people who first showed you love and tried to help you, and for hurting you and them just because I was such a self-righteous
Flamel raised his chin, looking skeptical. "There were invisibility cloaks around when I was alive," he proclaimed. "Why should I believe that that is the cloak of the tale? And what does this have to do with bringing my El back?"
"Er- can I ask you some questions?"
"Aw, c'mon. Hey, Harry, what about a trade? You tell me who gave you the potions and I'll give you my... Hm... Whatever you want!"
It was a good ten minutes of incomprehensible joy and shouting and general jubilation before the boys were able to move onto the next step.

"Yeah, I'm fine."
"Only
," Harry murmured in his own impression of Snape.
"Um- the room that the- the fiendfyre was in is still unusable, but the rest of the Room of Requirement is perfectly fine. It's the most secluded place in Hogwarts, anyway, and really the only place I could speak about this thing."
Fire is hot, Dementors feed off of happiness, Draco Malfoy has an extensive knowledge on Harry Potter.
So he looked down, and saw what he was sat on: a bed. Specifically, a blanket on a bed. A fluffy blue throw on a blanket on a bed, the same dark blue colour as the carpet. Why was he sat on a bed? Whose bed was he sat on?
