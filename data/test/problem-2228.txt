"Half the night, eh?" Harry said, nudging her with an elbow and giving her the flicker of a teasing smile. "And what did you spend the other half of the night doing?"
Draco smirked and gave Harry's hand a firm shake. "I'd say that's an excellent idea."
"Harry," Draco said, his voice kind but firm. "Let's stop stalling. Here, I'll even help wash up." He waved his wand towards the table, sending the dishes and cutlery soaring towards the sink. He settled them gently into the basin before filling it with soapy water. "There, we can have a chat while those soak."
There'd been something in the little's posts that had resonated: a plucked chord deep inside his chest. It had sent him down a rabbit hole of related blogs and
Harry winced, feeling guilty about making
Butter Chicken. Melts in your mouth."
"All right then, Potter," Malfoy said, holding out an arm in clear offer to Side-Along. "Shall we?"
She shook her head. "At least two dozen unaccounted for. Three confirmed deaths so far."
But Harry had never been one to let other people's judgements prevent him from going after what he wanted, and he knew he wanted Draco. More than that, Harry couldn't deny that he didn't want to lose that sense of joy and freedom he'd experienced during their scenes together, when Harry had felt safe enough in Draco's presence to slip into that littlespace. He knew from his research that many people were able to get there all on their own, but Harry knew that wasn't for him. His notoriety and profession made him far too paranoid to be able to truly let go without having somebody he trusted there watching over him. Besides, Harry couldn't deny that there was something slightly addictive about being cared for the way Draco cared for him. Draco made it clear that he respected Harry as somebody strong and capable, a true partner, while also creating space for Harry to lean on him, to let Draco sometimes carry the burden. It was a balance that had been missing from Harry's previous relationships, where there'd always been a tacit expectation that Harry would take the lead and make the decisions, regardless of Harry's personal feelings on the matter. It was nicer than he could have expected, not having to always be in control.
"Thank you for dinner," Draco said as he turned to face Harry, his eyes glowing beneath the yellow streetlights. "I had a good time." His brow furrowed and he met Harry's gaze, looking strangely vulnerable. "I don't know what it is about you, Harry Potter. My head tells me there's no way this will lead to anything but pain for the both of us, and yet…"
Blaise's lips quirked into a charming grin. "Oh, I wouldn't dream of robbing him of the chance to tell you himself. Be prepared, though. This one involves an improperly filled ice cube tray, an unfortunate absence of loo roll, and several minor explosions."
Harry blinked drowsily as he began to awaken. He was dazed and disoriented for several moments—he was clearly not in his own bed. He seemed to be sleeping half on top of somebody and, based on the fancy coffee table right in his eyeline, they were on a sofa. A movement on the table caught his eye, and he focused on the large children's book in front of him with the happily bouncing cartoon Crup, and all his memories came rushing back.
He felt strangely calm as they fought, even as he deflected curses that would turn his bones to knives or explode his heart where he stood. Harry let instinct guide him, while a litany of
"If you'd like. It's not a formal scene, more of a… hypothetical. I know you can get a little caught up in your head. I thought it might be easier for you to determine how you really feel about something if you had sex as a bit of a distraction."
"I'm sorry, Harry," Parvati said, her entire body wilted with evident misery. She was normally so confident and collected; he'd never seen her such a wreck. She seemed totally lost and more than a little terrified. Of him? But no, she was grabbing hold of one of his hands and squeezing it tight, as if worried he might disappear right in front of her. "I don't know how to do this. You're my friend, the closest one I've got here, and I don't want to lose you."
trio, and he missed that indelible thread of knowledge and connection he'd always had with his best mates. It was almost enough to make him miss the chiding he'd have got from Hermione as he let one of Foley's hexes close enough to the singe the ends of his hair, giving Fathi and Parvati a critical few seconds to put their plan into action.
He wasn't using his dommy voice, but it clearly wasn't a suggestion. As much as Harry had been putting off and dreading this very conversation, there was relief, too. Maybe now he could finally come to some kind of decision, get some type of closure, whatever that was. He followed Draco into the living room, curling up in the armchair while Draco took the chaise longue across from him.
," Draco said, brandishing the book. Harry could just make out an animated black and white Crup bounding across the cover before Draco tucked the book against his side.
Draco let out a sound like a purr and Harry's pants disappeared with a burst of magic, leaving him entirely nude. There was another prickle of magic and Draco's clothes had vanished as well, and Harry shivered with pleasure at the feeling of Draco's bare skin against his own.
"Yes, but I wasn't your partner, then," Draco fretted. "I just want this to go well. I know how important they are to you."
Draco huffed out a laugh. "Yeah, all right. We can pretend we're emotionally mature adults and talk about our feelings."
Harry knew his own expression was equally rapt as he imagined Draco lying naked and sundrenched on a dazzling white sand beach. He felt a sudden longing to be there right now, sitting beneath a swaying palm tree with Draco in his arms as they watched the sun set over a limitless ocean.
"No, that doesn't seem to be a viable option. Even with Lady Foley gone, their headquarters are still far too well guarded—trying to take over would be too great a risk. They'll be extra paranoid in her absence, and we already know from Kelly's intel, may he rest in peace, that she's set up several different splinter cells throughout Ireland that are carrying out separate aspects of her agenda. What we need to do is capture Lady Foley,
It was as if Draco's words had a direct line to Harry's cock, and suddenly he was coming, his release pulled out of him with the force of Draco's command. Draco fucked him right through it, screwing in nice and deep before finding his own release as he held himself inside Harry's arse.
Harry nodded slowly, unable to prevent the hot blush from staining his cheeks. He still felt all awkward and squirmy and uncomfortable if he let himself think too long on what he had already labelled
Draco winced almost imperceptibly before seeming to come to a decision. His body language changed, his shoulders straightening as a look of calm and quiet authority settled over his face. It was uncanny, and strangely attractive. Harry's heart skipped a beat as Draco focused his steady gaze on Harry while flicking his wrist towards the bag, sending it thwacking into his palm.
over them both. "Not exactly taking it slow, no."
"Harry," Imogen said, her tone wary. "Parvati told me to keep an eye on you… she seemed to think you might do something reckless."
Harry buried a smile in his shoulder. Fuck but she reminded him of himself when he'd first realised he was attracted to Draco. Well he remembered that glorious stage of denial, and seeing her and Fathi dance around each other made him sweetly nostalgic. It also hurt, an ache deep in his chest that reminded him that his own prickly other half wasn't here. It was what made the waiting so unbearable, what made Fathi's refusal to involve Harry in the questioning such a bitter pill to swallow. Keeping busy was the only way to distract himself from the empty hole in his chest that had formed the moment he and Draco had been parted. He just wanted it all to be over.
. Harry turned to Parvati, frantic and pleading. "If Fathi would just let me question her, I could—"
"You could buy me dinner," Malfoy suggests. His smile is bright and disarming. "I close at six."
Possibility (negotiation prior)
Draco's fist was raised, clearly about to start another round of impatient knocking, though he'd gone utterly still the moment Harry had swung the door open. His normally perfectly coiffed hair was mussed and windswept, and there was something slightly rumpled about his robes, as if he'd dressed in a hurry and without his usual precise care. The delicate skin beneath his slightly wild eyes was stained a pale purple-grey, and Harry felt a pang of guilt at the evidence that Draco apparently hadn't been sleeping much better than Harry. Harry knew it was all his fault, but even through the self-recrimination and confusion, he couldn't help the sudden rush of pleasure at seeing Draco again. It hadn't even been a full week, but the force of missing him hit Harry right in the gut. He gripped the door to prevent himself from throwing his arms around Draco and hugging him tight, unsure of his welcome.
has mentioned the situation in Ireland so directly and not just buried at the back of the paper.
Harry turned towards Fathi, waiting for his signal even though every cell in him burned to take action, to take Foley out where she stood. They'd not been expecting so many of her followers to be present while she set up the Portkey, and it looked as if she'd brought along her best duellers. Harry's fingers twitched with anticipation. That was fine by him. He could use a good fight. After far too long cooped up in Fathi's manor, just waiting for some action, they were finally
He always did. Draco seemed to hate himself for it, every evening. Harry hated himself, too, for being useless and creepy, for putting Draco through this, for the things he was forbidden to speak of. But it all went away the second their lips met, consuming and igniting, killing and reviving, over and over.
Harry’s journal lay open in Draco’s hand, its pages filled with Harry’s scrawled writing between Draco’s elegant script, illuminated by the light of the hawthorn wand. The stolen photograph peeked out from behind the leather, held between Draco’s forefinger and thumb.

“Oh. This isn’t—you’re not in trouble or anything. I didn’t have time to change, it’s not…” Weasley fumbled over his words, making vague motions at his uniform, and Draco took the opportunity to really look at his face for the first time in years, with his hand still curled around his wand by his side. He noticed Weasley had already returned his wand to the leather thigh holster most Aurors wore—apparently, Draco Malfoy in his pyjamas wasn’t much of a threat. Draco scowled.
but he didn’t. He made you into a boy who would never rely on anyone else, who would always take matters into his own hands, whose own life was
That feeling of comfort slipped away rapidly as he turned to face Draco, and really let himself look. Draco’s expression was pinched and fearful, his knuckles were white around his coffee mug. He was shifting uncomfortably on his feet, like someone caught in a lie, standing by the large window and looking at Harry intently. Harry’s hand twitched for his wand, his paranoia returning in full force.
“His heart,” Draco repeated, hating himself a little.
Draco checked his watch—they had about an hour until lunch. “The time between our sessions is supposed to be used for rest and recuperation. We’ve got some time before lunch… do you still enjoy flying?”
Harry nodded slowly in understanding, his eyes still roaming Draco’s body. His thumb absently rubbed the scars on the back of his right hand.
“I think I’ll just listen, for now.” Scorpius yawned, settling in.
“Wait,
Malfoy
Draco’s face fell with pity, coated in tenderness. “I promise, Harry, I’ll still be here. I want you fixed. Come on.” He slid out of the bed, and Harry sighed heavily, squeezing Draco’s hand as he was led to his own floo.
Of course they didn’t. Harry wanted to punch something. It was useless to keep asking him about things he didn’t know.
“What was?”
And that was terrifying. Trusting Draco Malfoy was terrifying. But Harry had been so curious about him all these years, had made sure the Minister was there to back him up. He’d wanted to see what Malfoy could do, uninhibited by his father or Voldemort or the Ministry. He’d wanted him to be successful, now that he was free to create his own life, and this was Harry’s chance to see who Malfoy had become, the man he’d grown into.
“I’m here now.”
“Draco,” Harry said. Malfoy blinked; Harry noticed the snowflakes that had caught on his long, blond lashes. He tried again. “
He didn’t know who he was more angry at, Malfoy, or Ron. Ron had obviously gone and recruited Malfoy behind his back, knowing he’d throw a fit, like he was doing now. But Malfoy was… was
“What is happening?” His voice was almost panicked. Draco couldn’t answer truthfully just yet, so his head tilted instead, listening, reaching out—
“Yes, sir. I, er…” Harry shifted uncomfortably.
“No,” Draco said fiercely, because it was the truth, and the potion knew it, too.
Draco flung open the doors to the shed, breathing in the smell of wood and broom polish. He could hear Harry taking a deep breath of it behind him. It was one of Draco’s favourite scents, which is probably why it manifested in his magic. It reminded him of the joy of flying, and filled him with a feeling of potential energy and possibility.
Harry was glad that Draco had insisted they eat in the sitting room, setting many cushions for them on the floor around the coffee table. He still abided by his rule of only eating takeaway on the floor, but Harry felt protective of the sunroom—he hadn’t been back in it since he’d unwittingly tortured Draco with a kiss, and didn’t want their first time back there to be with his best friends and their raised eyebrows and their
“The Department of Mysteries is located on Level Nine, in the Ministry of Magic, London.”
and the sheer number of them spread an eerie luminescence throughout the room.
Now that he was home, he needed to think, but his stomach chose that moment to growl. He couldn’t hear any sounds from the kitchen—Timsy must have been out shopping, then. Right—it was Tuesday, Timsy always did the shopping on Tuesdays.
“I’m pretty sure the Claire’s girl is going to convince me to pierce my ears,” Harry said casually, like this wasn’t earth-shattering news, and Draco was on him before he even realized what was happening, putting joyful hands and butterfly kisses over every inch of Harry he could reach. Giggling wildly, Harry flipped them over, pinning Draco’s wrists down again.
Once they were settled into their meals, their books and notes and maps aside, Harry continued the conversation.
“What is his greatest
Harry didn’t think he’d ever come so fast from a simple wank, but it
“How’d you figure that out?” he asked.
“Timsy is being unsure, but Timsy is knowing Master Draco is here,” he replied. “The stone, the earth around, is being the same. Very deep. He is being in this place.” Timsy paused, ear twitching again, shaking his head. “He is not being alone. He is being hurting, but he is happy he is being able to say Harry Potter’s name.”
“I know why you keep saying that, Harry,” she said, articulating each word with care. “I know you too well, by now.”
“Morning,” he waved, awkwardly, and winced at himself. “Timsy wanted help picking these for bouquets,” he explained, lifting his armful of flowers in emphasis. Why had he picked so many? He’d thought he’d just pick until Timsy told him to stop, but of course, Timsy hadn’t. The elf had his own tiny bundle, significantly smaller than Draco’s, and he was side-eyeing them persistently. Draco sent him a half-hearted glare.
“But it’s also…hard to believe I made it 22 years. I don’t really like reflecting on the past but birthdays sort of force you to, don’t they? So I’ve got to think about all my mistakes and doubts and failures and all that,
She looked surprised at that but collected herself quickly. “Still not my place to tell you. If you want to know so badly, why don’t you just ask Harry?”
Harry nodded tersely.
Draco was taken aback. He reached out to take Harry’s hand, stopping the nervous tapping of the quill.
Hermione took hold of Harry’s hand and looked him in the eye. “You’ll get through this. We’ll be here no matter what and help you however you want us to.”
“What?”
“Healer Lloyd, good morning.”
“And I’d win it,” Ginny interrupted confidently. “Y’know, if I wasn’t so
“Very well,” Malfoy said, drawing closer. He seemed surprised, perhaps even curious. “What did you want to discuss with me?”
he was so hot Draco Malfoy was sucking him off right now he was so beautiful and he felt so good his mouth his lips his teeth his tongue.
Harry nodded. “Thanks.”
Group started then, and Harry chanced making eye contact with Draco. The slightest quirk of the lips betrayed Draco’s usual cool exterior. Harry could barely bite down a smile as he focused his attention on Kathy.
Draco gazed at Potter, his grip on the files tight. Potter had dropped out of Auror training six years ago, along with Ron Weasley. Weasley, however, remained in the public eye even now. He’d been working at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with his brother since dropping out.
"I've already got a Mind Healer, thanks."
“Maybe a year?” Weasley said uncertainly. “But that was before it got really bad. He could hardly get out of bed some days. And then Harry just stopped coming to work. Hermione and I went over to his flat, and he just said he was tired. It was halfway reasonable. I mean, I quit a few months later to work at my brother’s store.”
He scrambled to find his clothes, pulling his shirt from underneath the covers.
“Not a lot…well, sometimes. She’s always been independent,” Potter reasoned more with himself than with Draco. “I never said I didn’t want to listen. I just didn’t want to talk.”
Sticking two fingers in his mouth, he disturbed the uvula until he threw up the contents of his stomach. He did the same thing a few more times until only saliva and acid came up. Satisfied, he stood back up, spat into the toilet, and wiped his hands with some toilet paper.
Draco left about half an hour later, thanking Ron and Hermione for the meal and their hospitality, allowing Harry, Hermione, and Ron to talk candidly. Harry was a bit sad to see Draco go, but knew it was for the best – spending three straight days together was a bit extreme, and could there really be too much of a good thing?
True to her word, Granger was back with her daughter and husband.
"Doesn't look like it," Draco said, and put down his fork. He knitted his fingers together and frowning at Harry seriously. "Pretend I'm Kathy. Tell me what ails you."
“Oh, Harry, you do,” Hermione smiled slightly. “I know you love us, and we love you too.”
“Well that’s even worse,” Draco sniffed. “All of this has just been sitting here all this time?”
Blaise scowled.
Draco chuckled softly. Potter’s lips twitched.
Ginny shushed him and continued to stroke his back.
“Why are you here?”
“Right. How will that work exactly?”
“Harry, you’re a wonderful person,” she said, and when Harry rolled his eyes, she continued, “Really, you are. You’re strong and caring and compassionate, and what’s even more incredible is that you’re still all this after – everything. If he doesn’t want anything to happen again, it’s his loss, honestly.”
Her eyes turned hard. “I didn’t say that.”
She snorted.
“Christ, loosen up, will you? You’re like a fucking robot.”
“Exhale slowly.”
“Is that what we’re calling it now?” Harry grinned in amusement. “I told them about that too. Everything. It was tough but worth it. They were er, surprised, to say the least, but overall accepting.”
was the Chosen One, and Draco was just…Draco, the failed Death Eater who’d forgotten how to eat properly.
. He didn't think he'd ever felt so carefree, not even as an
Harry hummed, thinking it over. As much as he wanted to say he didn't care at all so they could just skip the conversation and get straight to the sex, Harry knew it was important.
It looked like he was going to Italy.
Harry flushed and shook his head. "I'm okay. You said you can fix it?"
Draco had begun to make his way steadily down Harry's stomach and he nuzzled against Harry's flushed cock, breathing hot and damp against the head until it twitched. There was another staticky discharge of magic, and then slick fingers were sliding over his perineum and towards his arsehole.
Harry frowned as he looked over at the clock. Bugger. They were due at Ron and Hermione's in five minutes.
bit about his dick) so he could be the one screaming into his pillow.
"All right," she said, clearly still concerned but deciding not to push. "If you say so."
The sight of Harry floundering seemed to call to something in Draco because the signs of his nervousness dropped away. He straightened and gave Harry a warm smile before stepping in and brushing a kiss against Harry's cheek.
"I apologise for the delay. Is Emily available now? This shouldn't take long, and the sooner we can get her official statement, the sooner we can start investigating."
next to spanking, and
—could kiss. Harry had always enjoyed a good toe-curling snog but had found them increasingly hard to come by as he got older and his dates seemed to view kissing as an annoying prelude to the main event. But it was clear Draco enjoyed kissing just for kissing's sake, because nobody became this good at it without an honest love of snogging.
Warmth filled Harry's chest. He wasn't quite as zen about the whole thing as he was acting—he was sure tonight would be extremely bloody awkward. But he also knew they would all be making an honest effort, and that was what mattered. It had been a little over a month since he and Draco got back from Italy, and this meal had been weeks in the making. He'd told Ron and Hermione about Draco not long after they'd returned but then Hermione had gone into labour the very next day. This was the first night either of them were feeling up for company.
"The tiramisu we're supposed to be sharing, do you not like it? You've barely touched it."
Harry blinked down at him, loose-limbed and dazed in the wake of his powerful orgasm. His thoughts were as slow as treacle as he attempted to process the hotness that was Draco licking Harry's come off his lips.
Harry wasn't particularly familiar with BDSM, but he'd imagined it with more leather and paddles, and less princess dresses and baby dolls.
"You won't, I'm right here," Harry said, confused by the turn the conversation had taken, but remembering well how wildly his emotions had swung during the war, and how terrified he'd been of losing his friends. "I swear I'm not trying to be reckless. I promised Draco I'd come home to him, after all. God, he'll kill me if he finds out about the duel—you won't tell him, will you?"
"Does Fathi have a plan for getting Foley to talk?"
It was… bizarre.
Harry smirked and began to tug at Draco's flies. "Worked though, didn't it?"
God, Harry hoped so.
. Frankly, the idea of it sounded horrifying and degrading for both parties, and though Harry did his best not to judge others for what they liked in bed, he'd not felt the slightest interest in experimenting with any of that himself.
Honestly, Harry wasn't entirely sure why he was pushing quite so hard. It wasn't like him to chase somebody—frankly, he didn't usually have to, and he wasn't the type who got off on not being wanted. Normally a person's disinterest would have been enough to cool Harry's ardour, but none of Harry's usual rules ever seemed to apply to Malfoy. He hadn't been able to stop thinking about him, and a part of Harry hoped this date would be enough to get Malfoy out of his system. Either it would be amazing and they would keep seeing each other (an outcome even Harry had his doubts about) or spending time with Malfoy would be enough to show Harry that he hadn't changed all that much after all, and Harry would be able to move past this obsession.
," Malfoy muttered angrily as he took in Harry's side which was, admittedly, looking disconcertingly like minced beef now that his shirt wasn't obscuring the gross dangly bits of skin and flesh.
Draco kept right on sucking, apparently unconcerned about Harry coming down his throat. If anything, he seemed to redouble his efforts, moving faster and sucking harder until Harry's toes curled and his nails dug into his knees as he came down Draco's throat with a shuddering cry. Draco's eyes glowed up at him, molton-hot as he swallowed, licking Harry clean as he slowly pulled off.
"All right?" Cara nodded, hope beginning to crack through the fissures of her shaky façade now that they were so close to freedom. "Good, you're safe now. Take your brother and follow that young man over there. He'll protect you."
"It'll take more than a
"I thought we could watch a Story Spell, but I've also got some different toys to play with, depending on what suits your fancy."
"Ah, yes, I was wondering if that might come up." Draco seemed to be weighing his words carefully. "There's a lot of helpful information available that can be useful in figuring out what turns you on, but you've also got to remember that every person has their own unique perspective. The wonderful thing about kink is that, much like a relationship, it's entirely up to the people involved to define what it means for them. There's no one right way to do it, though of course there are best practices and guidelines to follow." He gave Harry a somewhat wry smile. "Just because salt-and-pepper Daddies with their young twinks or little girls in pigtails may be the poster children for ageplay doesn't mean that they're the only ones who play; much like everything else in life, you'll often find the reality of kink to be a bit different from the way it's portrayed in the media or on specifically curated websites. I know it'll be difficult, but I'd like you to try not to think about anybody else and their possible judgments, or what you think you should want or do. Right now, this is about me and you and whatever we want to make this. Nobody else."
"He got into our greenhouse," Cara explained, as if worried about what Harry might be thinking about the bandage. "Got into some plants he shouldn't have and broke out in boils, s'why we're here. My parents had to step out so I offered to stay with him while the Healers—" A large cracking sound echoed through the corridor, like the sound of a beam giving way. While they'd been speaking the fires around them had become much larger, and Harry realised that the damage to the building was much worse than he'd originally thought. They needed to get out of there.
happen, someday soon, and for now he was content with Draco's company and the memory of his indecent moan as he ate his pudding—a moan that would no doubt feature in tonight's wank session.
"I'm Cara," she said, her voice wavering with bravado. A movement behind her legs caught Harry's attention, a flicker of white-blond hair rustling behind her knees. Harry's heart clenched.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but Harry saw the hint of a smile he was doing his level best to suppress. "I hoped you might have finally got the hint, but I suppose that was naïve of me."
"Oh, hello. I was wondering when you lot would show up. I take it you're here to speak to Emily?"
"Fuck, you feel so good," Draco groaned against Harry's lips. "Are you close? Because I am,
sounded easier said than done. Harry hadn't ever been that great about talking about his feelings or stuff that was super personal. Apparently he needed to learn, quickly.
"I do?" Harry asked, tilting his head up to look into Draco's hypnotising eyes.
distracting." He tried to sound scolding, but his voice was a little too breathless to come off as anything other than encouraging.
"Semantics," Harry mumbled as he deemed his chips cool enough to consume. "But fine. Are you going to tell me what the bloody hell was going on back there? Because that"—Harry gestured with a particularly lengthy chip in the general direction of Emily's flat—"was not normal. She was acting like a—like a
But Draco was smart, and careful. He knew how to protect himself. It would be fine.
He nodded, scrambling up onto the cushions and pressing himself against Draco's side. Draco looked momentarily startled but before Harry could worry that he'd done something wrong, Draco wrapped an arm around him, his gaze softer and warmer than Harry's favourite blanket as he looked Harry over.
Merlin, how he hated the waiting.
"Shit, sorry," Harry mumbled, grabbing hold of Draco's arm to keep himself from pitching forward onto the pavement. His bicep was firm beneath Harry's fingers, the muscle flexing as he righted himself. Harry stared at where he gripped Draco, struck with the knowledge that he'd never seen Draco's bare arms before, and was overcome with the sudden and powerful urge to do so right that very moment. He'd always been attracted to muscular, athletic bodies—in men and women alike—and the sinewy strength beneath his grip sent a bolt of lust straight through him.
Harry took a deep breath, unable to look away from Draco's magnetic eyes. "I know," he whispered. "That was part of what I was trying to reconcile. Because the thing is, I
Harry barely heard a word he said, too captivated by watching Malfoy work. He'd always had a bit of a thing (okay, a
"More talking," Draco confirmed. He rubbed his thigh once more against Harry's hardening cock. "But we can make it quick."
Harry leaned back against the bartop as he waited for his refill and looked out over the crowded pub. His mates occupied a large table in the corner and he couldn't help but smile as he watched Seamus gesticulate wildly, clearly in the middle of one of his epic tales. Their group of friends tried to get together every month or so to catch up on their lives now that they'd all gone in different directions, and the table was quite full tonight, with fewer people having to beg off than usual. Harry still saw Ron and Hermione several times a week, but with Rose still in nappies and baby number two on the way, the dynamic between them had changed. Most days Harry didn't mind, but it was hard not to feel a little left behind when confronted by the fact that he and his best mates were at such different places in their lives.
Harry crawled onto the bed, leaning back against the pillows and giving his aching cock a quick stroke as Draco prowled towards the mattress and crawled over him, straddling his thighs. He ran his hands up Harry's stomach and pecs before sliding his fingers though Harry's hair and leaning down for another eager kiss.
When a local rescue agency working to help refugees escape the situation in Ireland had reached out to St Mungos, asking for Healer volunteers, Draco had been the first to offer his services. He was already working sixty hour weeks, and Harry didn't get nearly as much time with him as he wanted, but he understood how important it was to Draco that he do this. It was one of the many ways in which he tried to make amends for his past. This opportunity in particular was close to his heart given the similarities between the situation in Ireland and his history with Voldemort.
"I know." Potter gives Draco a careful look. "You still have to pass the exams, obviously."
"God, yes," Harry replied, and Draco began to fuck him.
"They don't… I mean, you haven't told them about…
"Legilimency?"
"I'm glad you liked it," Harry said. "Just give me a few minutes and I'll go take care of the dishes. I didn't make anything for pudding, but I've got a pint of chocolate ice cream if you want—"
Italy was great. Probably. Not that Harry was getting much out of it.
The prospect of a gift had Harry bouncing up onto his feet, desperately curious. He never seemed to have grown out of his childish enthusiasm for presents—perhaps because he'd never got many of them
Draco let out a full-body shudder at Harry's words and then he was coming, spilling warmth across Harry's fingertips. The sight and feel and
"I don't know about that 'more than anybody' business, but yeah, I get it. I deserve to be happy. And so do you."
"I want this to work too, Harry."
at another piece of parchment ever again, so he focused on making dinner when he got home, though those damned lists still called to him like a Siren's song as he threw together his spaghetti carbonara.
Harry's eyes widened, and he looked once more at Draco, who gave a small, unconcerned shrug. Had they stepped into a parallel universe? Was Harry hallucinating? What possible other reason was there for a grown woman to be dressed up as a little girl and calling her fiancé
"Who won?" Draco prodded Harry's side with a bony finger.
Draco sighed. "Yes, I know all that. But haven't you given up enough? You've already fought in a war, you don't need to volunteer for another one." He looked down, picking at a thread in the bed sheets. "Are you… are you not happy here?"
Harry quirked a wry smile. "I know what you mean. But something tells
, just long enough for him to get a handle on a life that seemed to be rapidly spinning out of his control.
"So the whole, erm…" Harry's heart skipped a beat as he forced the words out, "Daddy thing?"
"So chivalrous," Draco murmured, a low, seductive edge to his words that had Harry's stomach flipping as he followed him out of the department. He'd made a similar comment last night on their date when Harry had held the door open for Draco as they'd left the restaurant. They'd walked companionably back to Grimmauld Place afterward, Harry's heart jumping every time their fingers accidentally brushed together. Harry's gaze darted down to those fingers now, the smooth polished fingernails, the perfectly maintained cuticle beds, the prominent knuckle bones that would feel so good stretching—
Even though Harry was the one who'd asked him to stay, he found himself overcome with the shyness of a little boy, like he'd just met a strange adult he thought he liked but wasn't quite sure of yet. He turned his back, blushed, and quickly undressed, leaving on his socks and pants as he tugged on the new clothes. Harry wasn't sure why he felt so embarrassed—it wasn't as if Draco wasn't
This startled a short laugh out of Draco. He glanced at Potter and flushed at the way Potter was grinning at him.
“Draco, what, are you mad at me?” he asked, grabbing hold of his arm.
“I do.”
Malfoy seemed to catch on and offered, “I’ll find out which slots she has available and let you decide based on that. Is that alright?”
“I shouldn’t have said that to you,” he said quickly. “I apologize for my inappropriate conduct. If there’s anything else I can do for you…?”
Harry leaned over and brushed his lips against Draco’s before speaking.
“Not too bad, actually,” Draco answered. “I don’t know if they’ll ever actually like me but I appreciated their effort.”
“Yes. I gave her some resources on aiding those in recovery, our contact information, and an emergency plan before she left.”
“Yeah, fine, Malfoy.”
"Of course," Ginny said, a frown on her face. "But we're still here for you. You're stuck with us. For life."
“When’d you start calling Malfoy by his first name, anyway?”
Hello hello I'm back (for now)
Hermione smiled at him. “I’m glad.”
They finished up the breathing exercise, Harry continually finding it harder to concentrate on nothing with Draco’s thigh pressed against his own.
Fine. If Harry didn’t want to talk about it, that was fine.
“Oh? May I ask what horror you’re comparing an innocent quill shop to?”
“You can’t just decide these things on your own,” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “We’re a
George rolled his eyes. “Nothing would have come out of it without you, Harry.”
"It's nothing, Draco. Really."
Harry bit down a smile and inched closer, putting his hands on Draco’s waist. He licked experimentally up Draco’s neck, making the other man shudder.
“Sorry,” he mumbled, and made his way to the closest sink. He met his own tired eyes, wavering where he stood.
something to be ashamed of.
“You won’t feel anything,” she told Harry as she then took out a wand. “
“Yeah, Malfoy and I are the same age. Does he talk a lot about Hogwarts?”
Could Wolff really help him stay clean? It seemed unthinkable at this point. This was who he was now. He
Draco got him used to two before putting one more in. Harry watched Draco’s face as he slipped his fingers in and out, careful and eyebrows furrowed. He bit down a smile as he forced himself to relax. Getting out of his head let him loosen up and just
He filled the kettle with water and left it to heat as he set up the drip mechanism. It was Muggle, yes, but as there were quite a few Muggleborn or Half-Blood employees, it needed to exist. And Draco found that he quite liked it. Once the water had finished boiling, he poured it over the ground coffee, watching as the water-turned-coffee sunk lower and lower, revealing the coffee grounds underneath.
His mother would send letters frequently. It wasn’t as often as it was when he was eleven, but it was still nice to have something that was warmly familiar to him. She’d talk about visiting the Parkinsons, about how the hydrangeas were starting to wither, about how proud she was of him, but never about Draco’s father. The trials had taken a toll on them all, but the Malfoys weren’t known for expressing their emotions. Draco decided to follow his mother’s lead and never bring it up unless she did, which, shockingly enough, was almost never.
There was a little cough, and upon looking up, Harry realized that Malfoy had caught him staring. Harry’s face burned as he tried to meet Malfoy’s grey eyes. The blond’s facial expression was impossible to read.
“I hate you,” murmured Harry, stepping closer, watching with pleasure as Draco’s pupils dilated.
, causing Malfoy to jump slightly and look over at him.
“Tell me more,” Harry gasped.
“So it was most likely around early 2001?”
“You know, Potter, you’ve really got a knack for stating the obvious.”
He couldn’t tell her. Not yet.
Something within Harry, something he hadn't felt in years, was rousing deep in his stomach.
“So, does that mean...?”
Perhaps it was the coffee jumpstarting his nerves, but Draco slipped off his chair and made his way to the bedroom, his heart pattering a distracting beat high in his chest.
Potter’s green eyes were amused as he blinked questioningly at Draco, who stuck his chin up and stared right back.
Now, though, Draco would have to focus and really look at him to figure out what he was thinking or feeling. And even then, Draco would sometimes still be at a loss. It was when Potter looked vaguely blank. Not completely devoid of emotion, but almost. There was no smile, no frown, no teeth, no grimace. He’d get this look often – Draco had seen it many times over the months and it didn’t seem to matter if Potter was in class, with his friends, or by himself. He became closed off, and it was unsettling to Draco.
“That’s ridiculous, Potter,” Draco said immediately. “You know it won’t ever happen.”
They had an unspoken truce: neither would mention what had happened this morning. Harry would say no more about wanting Draco to eat.
“Do we have
“Ah – yes. Have you had any headaches today?”
that word – by fifth year,” Draco admitted. Harry’s mouth opened, halfway between a gasp and a smile. The weight of his chest lifted just a bit. Draco looked away; his face felt hot. “I told you it was embarrassing.”
“Hi,” Potter smiled, and Draco felt his cheeks warm. Potter walked over, a hand on the strap of the bag that hung carelessly over his shoulder. “How’ve you been?”
Harry stopped talking, turning away and taking a ragged breath. Draco felt close to tears himself but didn’t dare say anything.
“That’s because you’re not wearing any clothes,” Draco said. “And we’re over the covers.”
to say something.
“Thank you for saying that,” she said. “You’re right. I can’t forgive you, not now, but hopefully I’ll be able to someday.”
“Pomfrey or food, Malfoy.”
“He is.”
“Ginny and Luna,” he replied, and everyone looked surprised and a bit betrayed. “They found out on their own, I promise! Luna guessed – you know how she is, and Ginny put two and two together.”
“Are you alright, Draco?”
“Really? I didn’t realize there were points to wars.”
And as he yanked his sleeves down, Harry understood.
“Malfoy?”
Flipping his phone open, he watched as it lit up and displayed words that made Draco’s heart beat even faster.
“No,” he said, closing his eyes, unwittingly remembering that day. The smell of blood filled his nostrils – no, it wasn’t really, it wasn’t, it wasn’t. He wasn’t bleeding, he was fine, it was over. Draco snapped his eyes open. “I didn’t. I didn’t do anything.”
Draco froze. Panic took over him as he frantically wondered what Harry was going to say. What was it? Why was he being so serious?
Harry forced himself to face his friends. He wondered if they would look down on him or hate him or feel like they didn't even know him. Hermione's eyes were wide and her brows were furrowed, her mind probably working a kilometer a minute. Ron, however, simply looked stunned. His mouth was working, but nothing came out of it.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “What?”
His voice took on a bitter tone by the end. Draco was admittedly curious; he had never heard Harry discuss the youngest Weasley before. He didn’t press, however, in fear of Harry stopping. He needn’t have worried, however, because Harry continued on his own after a moment.
Draco moved in to kiss him as he didn’t have the words to express how he felt. Harry kissed back, cupping Draco’s face with his free hand. Draco moaned into the kiss; the feel of Harry’s warm body against his own made his cock harden, bringing back memories of last night.
“Is this color alright? It suits me, doesn’t it?” she asked instead of answering Draco’s question.
bother us, Harry,” Hermione whispered.
Harry was taken aback by her forthrightness – he’d gotten a bit more used to people speaking openly about themselves and their respective issues, but this was still off-putting.
“Congrats.”
“He won’t even do anything. He’ll probably just stand there and be snotty,” Cait said, making her case to Samuel.
“Do you know why?”
“Listen, mate,” Ron said quietly, his eyes glancing over to the bedroom. “I’m uh.” He scratched his head. “Thinking about proposing to Hermione.”
Harry clamped his mouth shut and looked away, his eyes burning. He was ashamed of himself, for getting himself in this situation again for the thousandth time for having to see Ginny like this to know he made Ginny feel this way to know he’d fucked up
“So, how was it?”
WARNING: self-harm mention.
Harry shrugged. “I’ll figure something out.”
And without thinking, Harry offered his hand out to Malfoy. The other man looked down at it with caution before taking it in his own and shaking. It was cold.
“Could you tell me what symptoms you’re experiencing right now?” Estrada asked, quill at the ready.
Harry’s heartbeat quickened.
It was Harry’s turn to be surprised. “Secondary school?”
“I just…”
"Mostly downers. Cannabis, benzos...but sometimes I'd use cocaine or ecstasy for er, special occasions."
He sighed deeply, finally ready to talk to Malfoy about his decision.
"C'mon," Harry murmured, leading Draco up the rest of the steps.
“He's back in London too. Just came in this morning, and just for a day or two,” Granger said. “They’re at Molly’s and Arthur’s.”
He woke up again sometime later, Harry blinking into consciousness after being roused by the cracks of light shining through the curtains. He patted his bedside for his wristwatch, and was surprised to see that it read 12.30. Of course, he’d neglected to check the time when he’d first wakened, but 12.30 was still rather impressive for him.
Draco was struck by the sincerity of these words. He could have cried at the earnest look on Harry’s face that made him appear four years younger.
Harry turned to Draco with wide eyes.
Malfoy disregarded this. “Why didn’t you talk to Ginevra? Or owl Wolff?”
"Yes, um," Draco said, his mouth in an uncertain frown. "It has."
“Hm,” she pursed her lips. “I suppose you do look slightly better, though who knows how
“Fuck me, Draco,” Harry growled.
“What’s got
“Wow,” Draco said, lost for words.
,” he hissed, releasing Draco. He pulled instead on his hair, his fingers wrapping securely in the white blond locks.
Harry nodded, gritting his teeth.
Draco shot Ira a silencing glare. Eternally grateful that no one was in the break room but them, he gritted out, "If you'd like to take a walk over to your office, we can continue this conversation there. Otherwise, please stop talking."
Draco searched the area for his wand, which he had taken out of his pocket, along with his pack of smokes, at some point last night. He found it tucked underneath a pillow and cast a
“I’m not trying to – to
“Why should I?” It sounded like he was frowning.
“Malfoy?”
Harry tensed under his touch but didn’t answer.
“Draco-“
“The past is in the past,” said Draco, waving the subject away. “Anyway, you’re meeting her now. Isn’t that enough?”
“Perfect,” Draco said, scowling at his feet. “That’s just what I needed, to be even further indebted to you.”
“Potter,” Draco said, and when Harry met his eyes, he continued, “Listen carefully. I won’t be talking about this again because I don’t like to. But I will, just this once. After the war, I hated the Mark. It served as a reminder of who I was, what I did, etcetera. So one day, I took a knife and cut into it.”
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said. “But yeah, my dad was British Indian. Mum was white.”
He saw her subtly look him up and down, no doubt for signs of his
Draco was only satisfied when all that was coming up was acid and water. Draco stood upright again as he calmly took some toilet paper to wipe off his hands. He flushed.
They looked at each other for a few seconds; Harry couldn’t understand the expression on Malfoy’s face. It was curious. Despite the way he was clearly trying to appear distant and professional, Harry thought he could see a hint of…sadness. Or guilt, perhaps. Was it possible? What did Malfoy have to be sad about?
“Yeah, ok,” Harry answered, nodding nervously. “Er – who else is…?”
It’d been over a year since he’d had an appointment with Wolff but talking to her still left Draco rattled. He’d been in a disastrous state at the start of his therapy, and that was what came to mind whenever he set foot in Wolff’s office, despite first seeing her two and a half years ago.
“No, Healer Malfoy. Sorry.”
“I love you too, you big sap,” Draco said, inching closer to wrap his arms around Harry’s slick body. He rested his head on Harry’s chest and closed his eyes once more.
“Oh, nice,” Samuel said, the grin coming back on his face. It fell slightly as (Harry guessed, anyway) Harry’s use of past tense sunk in. Thankfully, Samuel decided not to inquire about it. “My parents are both from Pakistan. It’s always nice to meet other Asians. Got to stick together, eh?”
Wolff waved her wand and a kettle set about heating up some water.
This got a laugh out of Draco. “You wish it was, Potter. You’re the least subtle person I know.”
Draco took a shuddering breath at that.
“Hm? Oh, thank you,” said Draco from where he stood in the kitchen. “I’ve been meaning to do more with it, but with limited time and money…”
"You’re not weak, Draco," Harry said firmly. Draco tried to shake his head, his eyes red. "You're not broken. You're brave and you've been through too much and you hold yourself too accountable. No one can be strong all the time. You're
The two walked back in together, all eyes on them. Kathy smiled from the center of the room.
Harry stuffed the piece of paper in the pocket of his hoodie and wiped his hands on his jeans. He then took hold of the doorknob and turned.
The next week trudged by slowly.
Draco rolled his eyes.
seem upset yesterday. Really upset,” Betty admitted slowly. “But he only let me talk to him about his physical symptoms. When I asked him what was wrong, he just brushed me off.”
He poked at his warm porridge with the plastic spoon and knew he wouldn’t be eating any of it. Even if he wanted to, he didn’t think his stomach could manage it.
“Do what? My job?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrows.
When he
“Harry,” he hissed. Harry stirred, but did not wake. “Wake up.”
“ – Ginny was in such a state – “
Harry looked around him for any sort of communication device, thinking about how much easier this would all be if he just had his wand. Finally, he found a small, glowing button on one end of the headboard. Somehow, Harry felt that this was the one, and he pressed it.
Draco simply nodded.
He turned back towards Potter, who had a small smile on his face.
Harry felt sick to his stomach as Draco’s words set in. His mouth dried up and he blinked, first at Draco’s impassive face, and then at the Mark. It didn’t look like there were any scars in it; the Mark was simply faded. There was no sign that Draco had ever taken a knife to his own skin.
. Take ‘em off.”
In all his panic, Draco had nearly forgotten what had even caused this mess. As the truth settled in his chest like a cold, heavy rock, he found that he really just wanted to be asleep again. But Potter was here now, and Draco didn’t think he could sleep more even if he tried.
"C’mon. Just take it," Potter wiggled the wand and lifted it higher.
exactly Harry was struggling.
Leonel grunted in agreement. They continued walking, Draco reading over the potion screening and Leonel taking care not to drop anything.
Her voice was thick, but there were no tears. Ginny was still a woman who was rarely weepy, and yet, Harry had seen her cry twice in the past week. Because of him.
bad. Sure, his chest was tight and his stomach churned when he noticed the other students barely concealing the suspicious looks they kept casting towards him, but Harry’s presence by his side was…reassuring in a way Draco didn’t want to examine too closely.
“I’m off season!” Ginny told him indignantly, swallowing hard. “And I’ll hex Blaise if he even
“I’m ready to leave St. Mungo’s, for one,” Harry said.
“I’m not,” Harry insisted. “I just would’ve liked a more conventional way to break the news, y’know.”
“You’re disgusting!” Draco told him, grimacing as Harry wiped more and more sweat over Draco’s face, hair, and shirt. “Stop it!”
“Hello, Draco! Did you miss me?” Pansy drawled at him as soon as she drew close enough.
“Aside from my unusually heavy case load and the lack of sleep, I got contacted by some arsehole I knew from school.”
“I’m not sure, Healer Mitchell,” Draco replied, “Though I believe that he may have overdosed on a number of potions. Healer Estrada is currently running a potion screening and Trainee Burke is calling his emergency contacts. Or rather, those who I guessed to be his emergency contacts.”
Draco forced down a smile. “It's fine, really. It's not like it was any different from back in Hogwarts.”
Harry stopped them both, corralling Draco to the side of the corridor until they were up against a stone wall. He grinned at him. “Thanks for pushing me to tell them. I wouldn’t have, otherwise.”
"Er, yeah," Harry said. "Sorry."
“Oi,” Harry scowled, pulling it back out of her reach. He opened the container and passed it back to her. “There.”
Maybe they both needed to get drunk again, like they did at that Halloween party. Maybe once they had alcohol coursing through them, their tongues would become looser.
Draco smiled slightly at Harry. “You’re still not very eloquent.”
“No,” he sighed. “It’s fine.”
“I’m sorry for losing my temper like that. I shouldn’t have said those things to you. And I know he deserves to be in there, but he’s still my father,” Draco said, forcing calm into his shaky voice. Both Granger and Weasley looked surprised. He turned to Harry. ”If you’d like me to be here, I’ll stay.”
Draco pulled it off and let it drop to the side of the bed. Harry’s hands went to Draco’s chest at once, tracing invisible patterns around his scarred skin (
He sipped his tea (black, of course) and caught Harry’s disapproving eye.
“Thanks,” he said gruffly.
“Shut up, Malfoy!” Potter snapped. “Don't fucking patronize me.”
“Well,” Luna smiled, “As long as it was consensual, I’m very happy for them.”
“I wasn’t aware that we were still just
“Wait,” Draco said sharply, surprising Leonel into freezing in his place. “I think he just moved.”
“Oh,” Samuel said, a smile on his face as he glanced around. “That’d be great, if you all want to.”
Ron took in what Harry was saying, nodding at the right times.
Draco never would have guessed. It was strange to think that Harry had thought he was attractive, especially during sixth year when he was at his worst – both physically and mentally.
“Anyway, I hope you’re not regretting choosing me as your project. I’m sure this isn’t what you signed up for.”
So, Potter was cursed and Obliviated, and then left alone. Weasley didn’t mention anything about nightmares or pain or hallucinations, but then again, Potter couldn’t speak, so it was unlikely he’d be able to communicate those symptoms anyway. Was he unable to write, too? How was he communicating without a voice? He must be frantic, the Saviour of the Wizarding World was scheduled for speeches and appearances months in advance, and it must be impossible to be the cherished star Auror he was without a voice. What would the world think of a mute Boy Who Lived?
you would ask that of him, but I don’t know if I believe it,” Draco said, breaking the silence, and Harry looked away, clicking his tongue in annoyance. At Draco or the Minister, he may never know. “After all, he was trying to weasel information on your condition out of me, he may have simply told me what he thought would work best to that end. But that would make him a bit of an idiot, considering he is more familiar with my work than probably anyone else at the Ministry, and knows full well that I am bound by patient confidentiality.”
“I’m not mad about the missing scrunchies. Before you ask.” Draco’s eyes went wide—his mind hadn’t even gone down that spiral yet, but
They sat in the garden, drinking and talking for hours under Harry’s lights. Harry had his arm draped over Draco’s shoulders, as if this was normal, as if their world wasn’t about to be struck by lightning, quite literally.
“I am a lonely old man,” Willem replied in a flat tone, as if Harry were being intentionally dense. “I know when I am in the presence of a kind-hearted woman.”
Draco didn’t feel like the work was done. The maze had been solved, but it seemed such a small piece of a much bigger puzzle. Harry was “healed,” but Draco still didn’t know who’d caused it or how or
He turned into the open bedroom, and froze.
Harry laughed and returned the offered hug. He held out his hand to Draco, who ignored it, steeling himself.
“And I hurt you anyway, by trusting him with that,” Harry continued. “And I keep doing it. I don’t know what it is about you that makes me act like such an idiot.” He looked down at his fingers, trapped in Draco’s hand. Draco loosened his grip just enough to take his hand properly, rubbing his thumb over Harry’s knuckles.
“I hate that woman,” she muttered. Harry frowned.
Harry kept his eyes on him, hard and unmoving as a brick wall. Smith winced again as the burn on his skin intensified. He was probably imagining how much money he’d get from suing Harry after this.
Harry tilted his head from side to side, apparently undecided. He eventually shook his head no, and lifted his hand to absently rub at his scar.
“Where do you want these, Timsy?”
It had been almost eight years since the end of the war, eight years since Harry Potter had testified for him at his trial, effectively keeping him out of Azkaban. Draco had kept his nose clean the entire time, studying hard and taking Healer’s apprenticeships on the Continent and around the world, making a name for himself as one of the leading experts in the field of Mind Curses and Afflictions. Even his probation Aurors, back when he was on probation, got bored with supervising “a bloody swot”. There was no reason for Ronald
“What do you mean?” he asked, narrowing his eyes, and Hermione froze, exchanging a worried look with Ron.
Malfoy.
Draco tried to steer the conversation back to the matter at hand. “Anyway, I asked if you frequent that pub because you seemed very… comfortable there, even if you were uncomfortable at the time.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said again. He wasn’t sure for which part he was apologizing. Maybe all of it. “He tried to kill you… you were
The one in front of Harry now looked… nice. Inviting and reassuring. It looked like
Harry smirked and nodded, moving to join him at the center of the room with the rest of the Aurors, Parkinson and Timsy following him. Ron was the best at diffusing nerves right before a raid, just enough to settle everyone into awareness, instead of paranoia. Harry subtly moved to stand directly in front of Parkinson and Timsy, shielding them from the doors. Parkinson tsked at him again.
“I do want you here,” Draco muttered softly, as if he hated admitting it. Harry pressed a chaste kiss to his lips, his hand sliding to the back of Draco’s neck.
His wards were still up, but they were fading, because he could hear the distant hum of nightlife, of jubilant people and the sweet music of street buskers. Harry laid perfectly still on the warm cobblestones, his breathing harsh and laboured, and let the familiar melody run through him.
Draco silently noted that that may have been the longest sentence Harry had written in his notebook thus far. He nodded slowly in understanding, and pointed his wand at the board, labeling the new dot on the map “Abilities & Choices”. He rested his wand in his lap when he was finished, turning his gaze to meet Harry’s again.
for it, like he couldn’t get enough. Draco’s breathing was harsh, his eyes squeezed shut, and he couldn’t keep his body from shaking as the pain ripped through him, like an army of knives in his abdomen, like his muscles were on fire, but he fisted his hands in Harry’s jumper and kissed him again and again, and Harry was nibbling on his lips, tasting him on his tongue, absolutely

“Draco,” Harry cut him off, chuckling, taking Draco’s face in his hands. “Don’t you get it? It’s just
Draco’s latest theory was quickly gaining more traction, as Lucius’ desperation obviously grew.
Harry’s magic flowed through him slowly, like warm honey, and Draco let it fill him as Harry’s knees weakened. He fought desperately against the reins in his father’s control, pushing with everything he had, trying to make his own magic help Harry’s along. Draco’s arms were completely stiff, and he was now practically holding Harry up by his neck, Harry’s face nearly purple above his unmoving grip, Harry’s hands locked onto his wrists, so, so warm.
Was this how the Wizarding World saw him, now? Triumphant and strong, carrying the banner of victory and perched atop a golden pedestal, where no one could reach him? Was that why they’d fallen at Harry’s feet, years ago?
Draco, inexplicably, leaned in a little closer. Harry swallowed.
“I won’t hurt you by forcing it, Harry, but you know I’ll have to see it eventually,” Draco grumbled, but allowed himself to be swept along the river of memories for now.
“Come on, then, time for lunch,” Draco said, voice coming out more hoarsely than he’d liked as he made his way to the door, not bothering to see if Harry would follow.
Draco gave an embarrassed grin. “Yes, Bubo. I was stuck on what to name him, so I ended up researching as much about eagle owls as I could—the taxonomic name of the eagle owl is literally
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco paused, swallowed, then crossed the floor, climbing onto Harry’s lap.
“You’re mad,” he said. He paused as his nose brushed Harry’s, hearing Harry’s breaths quicken.
“The attacker then only had to magically command Harry’s mind to hide his own voice, until such a time when he was ‘truly known’ for who he is, and not who he is
Draco felt like he might explode—with what, he didn’t know. His hands were shaking where they gripped the broom on his lap, and all he knew was that he absolutely, most definitely
“And, he listens to that album there, while he roasts,” he finished. Harry was grinning widely now. It was a fun image to picture, Timsy humming to
“I have been alive too many years to not know magic when I see it, boy.”
and everyone acted like it was
First, he’d expected Ron to go straight to Malfoy Manor, but instead, he took them to a modest seaside cottage in Cornwall.
That effectively snapped Draco out of his daze, and he blinked, trying not to drop Harry’s hand too quickly. He could feel a traitorous blush on his cheeks, spreading down his neck.
Full prompt: either Draco or Harry starts baking to cope after the war and it leads to them meeting again.
“Yes, that sounds like him,” Ron added grimly. “But if Lucius is working with the Unspeakables, he could have access to literally anything in the Ministry. Especially if the Warden and the guards of Azkaban are covering for him, intentionally or not—he’s obviously got a lot of power. Why would he need Draco?”
were the only person who could fix it.”
Harry took Draco’s hand again, intertwining their fingers, glancing to the side to watch Draco’s lips twitch as he repressed his smile.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, bewildered.
But as he tried to latch onto it, he felt a hard, intangible

as it overwhelmed him. She couldn’t get close, but she couldn’t stay away, either.
And now Harry looked amused again, and Draco was confused again. “What?”
He could still remember it all, but vaguely—the images were fuzzy, as if a layer of detail had been torn off. He was left with the feelings, his own thoughts and reactions. Those couldn’t be translated into a separated memory. The Pensieve wasn’t
She smiled softly and shook her head. “Remem-bering.”
“Oh, god,” Hermione said, the blood draining from her face. “That’s right. Vanished objects don’t disappear, they’re just transformed into nonbeing.”
But Ron was right: he could be anywhere. The Malfoys held multiple properties in England and France. Lucius could be using some secret Unspeakable hideout. Depending on how long he’d been out of Azkaban, he could have had time to obtain even more hiding spots, maybe even old Death Eater safehouses…
want to talk about that night, again, so he quickly cut in to steer them back to the present.
He bent over it and dipped his face into the basin, falling into someone else’s memory.
“That’s it,” Ron muttered, sighing and putting his quill back in its stand. He sat back in his chair, pulled his wand, and waved it at his desk, sending the parchments to all their respective files, leaving his desk clear. He stood up from his chair and straightened his robes. “Come on.”
Harry had his mouth open in shock—thankfully he was in between bites. Draco was used to his patients’ general surprise at him when they got to know him, but now it just seemed so much more… personal. He looked back down to his plate, and they carried on eating in silence.
Potter’s face was pure shock, once he got past the angry narrowing of his eyes at the thought of Legilimency. Draco couldn’t identify which part of his last sentences had caused him to be so appalled. Maybe the use of Voldemort’s name?
“So, I’ll be seeing you twice weekly for the next six weeks—Mondays and Thursdays, and full eight hour appointments. It’s not Legilimency the entire time—” Draco added, seeing Potter’s comically wide eyes, “—it’s a session in the morning, followed by rest and mapping out the progress, then another session in the afternoon. It’s irresponsible to do anything more frequent than that.”
“The Aurors have been looking for him for months,” Harry said gravely. “He was right under our noses the whole time.”
Harry had wanted to visit the animals again, so they did. The sun was out, thankfully, so neither of them needed outerwear. Draco had even rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, allowing the mid-April sun to warm his skin, and fill him with contentment.
Scorpius let out another groan, the kind that usually signified an oncoming tantrum. Draco prepared himself to step in—
“I told you, it takes both of us some getting used to.” Draco quirked his lips, trying to inject confidence back into his voice. “How did that feel?”
). He hadn’t thought that out very well, though, because now he had to spend hours with a flushed and sweaty Draco Malfoy wearing
“This room, my study, is a sanctuary. There is no judgement, or hatred, or violence in here. Nothing that happens in here leaves this room, not even for your friends, without both of our consent. My wards here are stronger than the centuries-old blood wards at the Manor. My floo is normally locked to everyone except my mother, Pansy, and the Minister, but while you are here, it is locked and warded completely. While you are here, this space is only for you, me, and sometimes Timsy—who is the most loyal being I’ve ever known, and I consider him family.” Draco put his arms on the armrests, forcing himself out of his defensive posture. “You are safe, here.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but conceded the point.
“Not a word,” Harry said, as the man opened his mouth. It snapped shut with an audible
“I’ve been doing some more research,” she told him. “The more I know about you, the better I can treat you.”
She proceeded to perform diagnostic spells and wrote the results on his chart at the foot of his bed. Harry shrugged in place of a real answer. He wasn't sure if she saw him.
“That’s the exact opposite of what we need to be doing,” Draco replied as a chill ran down his back.
“You can’t guilt me on that.”
He busied himself by pulling out Potter’s file and reviewing it.
"Don't change the subject," Harry said, too focused on his own hurt feelings to feel too bad about it. "What do you think I've been doing?"
“What are you doing?” Draco hissed, hoping his face wasn’t bright pink. He tried to shake Potter off, but Potter had a steel grip on his arm. Draco watched as the other students filed out of the classroom, glancing at them curiously before turning and whispering to their friends. Draco looked Potter in the eye, certain he was blushing now. “Let go of me.”
“What makes you think you can do better than Pansy or Astoria?”
This time, Harry really gasped, and Draco felt him tense. “Are you alright?”
Enjoy (blowing kiss emoji)!
“Do you know how long he did that?” Draco asked, continuing his notes as he spoke.
Malfoy glanced over to her, his eyebrows furrowed.
Draco was lost for words. His mouth worked uselessly before he snapped it shut. Potter had spun around and began pacing impatiently.
“So I was wondering if it would be alright if I told Ron and Hermione about us.”
“Er, thanks.”
Nevertheless, everyone had seemed to decide that Harry was the pure, good soul, and Draco was corrupting him somehow.
Draco blinked at him, then nodded wordlessly.
“That’d be nice.”
Ginny grinned.
“Why have you been sneaking in late every night for the past week?”
Potter slumped against the bed and whispered so lowly that Draco had to work to understand him.
“How long was I out?”
"Don't really have any place else to go," Harry said, unsure of how to articulate his thoughts. Draco’s frown deepened. "Where do you live, anyway?"
“No, but it
Draco shook his head no.
He shoved on his glasses, looked at the clock and saw, to his disappointment, that is was only half-past-seven. He
Estrada nodded. He kept looking at Harry like he expected him to start laughing or yelling at him.
“I guess I can’t argue with that.”
“I do,” said Draco lowly. “But I can’t stop worrying about if something
“Like I said, I don’t blame them. There’s lots of bad blood between all of us, and it was usually me being the prejudiced prat.”
Harry bit his lip and nodded.
“Harry? Is that you?”
“Have you, y’know, planned it out yet?”
He groaned, brought his hands up to cover his face, and laid back down in the fetal position. Why did Potter tell him that, especially when Draco was so obviously pissed? Potter was clearly pissed too, and it might have just come out unwittingly. Draco could live with that explanation.
Harry let out a great, shuddering sigh. Draco gripped him tighter.
“How’d you know?”
“Harry!”
to fall in love with Potter now, of all times. Of course, it
“Looks like we’re here, lads,” Cait flashed them a grin before hurrying to join the other two.
“Years,” confirmed Harry gravely. “My memory’s still hazy for the past…well, a long time, and I honestly can’t remember the last time. Don’t kill me, but when did we break things off?”
He'd gotten used to not eating. Sharing a house with a bloodthirsty murderer had taken away his appetite, funnily enough. Maybe it was all the lessons on torture with his killer aunt, or perhaps the suffocating anxiety of making one wrong move in front of the Dark Lord, or maybe the smell of blood that seemed to be stained in the floors and in the walls and in his nostrils, but his appetite had vanished that spring, and it hadn't come back.
“Almost eight.”
Harry Potter thanking Draco Malfoy. Sincerely, it seemed. Draco was stunned.
“Sounds like a prick,” Harry said convincingly before taking a slow sip of his coffee.
It sounded worse out loud. He determinedly avoided Malfoy’s stare.
"Are you remembering work-life balance?"
“Wonderful,” smiled Wolff.
Potter looked at him, eyebrows furrowed. “I’m worried, Malfoy. That’s the easiest way to put it. But I can tell that anything I say is just going to bounce off you right now, so I’m going to leave.”
“So you ordered enough food for an army? Or perhaps just enough for Weasley.”
“I got that, somehow. You never did talk much about Harry Potter, did you?”
“It doesn’t matter, just forget it,” Draco replied, waving the question away. “The point is, all I want to do now is sleep. So just go.”
"Fine," Draco said, and allowed himself to be pulled away.
meant to do?"
Samuel chose to ignore this and instead told her, “Fine. Go invite him if you want to so badly.”
Point was, Harry was pissed and it felt
They sat in silence drinking their coffee.
Harry shook his head. “I tried to – er, I was in police training for a bit, but that didn’t work out.”
“I can spend the night,” Draco said, an amused smile on his face. Harry met his gaze. “I’ve just got to leave by tomorrow afternoon. All right?”
“Potter again, huh?” Harry questioned, but he accepted Draco’s request, drawing his fingers away. “Fine,
Ginny lifted her head, and Harry turned to meet her gaze.
His heart was pounding beneath his chest. He looked down at the scrap of paper in his hand and looked back up. Room 142, said the nameplate on the door. They were the same words that were scrawled on the paper, along with “5.30 PM.”
“Now, I want you to exhale completely through your mouth. Once you’ve done that, close your mouth and inhale through your nose for a count of four.” She paused momentarily. “One…two…three…four.”
Draco took a shuddering breath.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Granger hesitated before asking lowly, “Could we go somewhere private?”
“It’s a complicated process,” Malfoy said carefully, “And almost impossible to do on oneself. It would be much safer and effective if experienced Healers treated you.”
“When I was seventeen,” Harry admitted.
Draco wondered what his past self would do if he told him that he was having a civil disagreement with Harry Potter. He thought fifteen-year-old Draco would laugh in his face and call him mad.
It was disconcerting, to say the least. The last time their relationship had been so strained was right after they’d broken up. It wasn’t
“And why do you dislike it so much?”
Another day.
“What are you doing here?”
, and he instinctively shoved hard at Potter’s chest with all his strength. Potter stumbled backward; he looked down at where Draco had pushed him, and then back up at Draco. And then he stepped forward again and enveloped Draco in his arms.
“May I remind you that I am your superior?” he tried weakly.
With a panic Draco realized that Potter was trying to
"And are you talking about Malfoy or Estrada right now?"
Draco caught Ira looking at him carefully, and so he chose to take a drink instead of answering her.
“Vanilla’s great.” Draco took the one Harry had pointed to first and took a deep drink. “That’s perfect. Thanks.”
“I still recommend that you stay longer to give you the best chances at a full recovery. It’s just
“Of course,” Leonel said. “All the patients are doing fine. Not too many today. And anyway, I was actually about to leave – unless there’s anything else you need me to do?”
He knew, of course, the reason for feeling so poorly. It’d been looming over his head the past week, tormenting and taunting him from the back of his mind. And the past few nights, he’d been having nightmares about it, the same exact scene playing over and over again.
Harry squirmed. “He knows we’ve been fucking?”
"What's wrong, Draco? The last time I'd seen that look on your face was...well, a good while ago. I'd even say it was when you were dealing with your little Harry Potter fiasco -"
Draco seemed a bit surprised but nodded, a corner of his mouth pulling into a smile.
“Anyway,” said Potter, checking his watch, “Don’t you have work? I’m not keeping you, am I?”
"You ready, Potter?"
“Oh.” Malfoy seemed troubled. He turned to the girl, Betty. “Inform Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley that Potter has woken up. I believe they went home for the night so you’ll have to fire-call them.”
She smiled wider and winked. “Anything for my favorite ex-boyfriend.”
or if it actually meant something,” he hissed.
The question caught Draco off guard, and he shifted in his seat before glancing tentatively over at Potter. Potter wasn’t looking at him, though; he was facing the fire, his expression stony.
"Me too," Draco breathed.
Malfoy seemed to be forgetting something.
“Alright.”
“I’ve never done this before,” Harry said. “Sucked someone off, I mean.”
Draco rubbed at his eyes. “I just want to finish it. It’s just tedious paperwork, nothing difficult or challenging. I would just have to do it tomorrow if I don’t suck it up and do it tonight.”
Draco was good at staying inside his head and bottling everything up, and Pansy knew this. She worried, and Draco wished she wouldn’t. She kept telling him that she was always there if he needed to talk, as if she’d never told him that before. But even if he did want to talk, what would he say? That he was as depressed as ever but talking to Potter made him feel a bit more normal, at least for a little while? And now that Potter was back to (rightfully) treating him like he didn’t exist, Draco had nothing to relieve him from the numbness and despair that overtook him?
At their alarmed looks, Harry quickly added, "It's not bad. Well, it is, but in a different way.” He sighed and continued, wishing they'd stop looking at him like that. “Look, I think I...fancy Malfoy, as mental as it is, and I only figured it out because I overheard him talking to the American Healer and it sounds like they were together –“
Betty nodded, and with a careful wave of her wand, said clearly, “
"Excellent. Harry, owl me when you're home and healed. Malfoy, it was… not entirely unpleasant working with you. Let me know if you ever want me to clobber you at chess again." He turned and frowned. "Oi, Junior Auror Rogers, what do you think…" Ron's voice trailed off as he strode back towards the scene.
"Don't you?! Of course I want her dead," Harry said savagely. "She
Harry blinked slowly, his eyelids heavy and his body growing cold despite the fires still flickering around him. The shouts in the distance seemed to grow louder, nearer, the urgency in their tones almost managing to stir him. Almost. Vague friendly figures began to run towards him—good, he thought with some satisfaction, that must mean they'd subdued Foley's people—but they didn't hold Harry's attention for long.
He didn't give Draco a chance to protest further, just walked slowly but resolutely towards the guest room when what he wanted to do was run. Once the door was closed he tore off the clothes—literally, unfortunately, as the weakened fabric was unequal to Harry's need to get out of them and back to
Draco was already in bed, looking mouthwatering in a pair of low-slung dark grey joggers and a tight white shirt. He tossed aside the book he'd been flipping through when Harry came in and gave Harry a slow, thorough once-over that made Harry's cock twitch eagerly. Draco's lips twitched into the barest hint of a smug smile as he pat the bed next to him in invitation. Harry didn't need to be told twice, and he dropped his clothes on the floor in a heap—ignoring Draco's nose-wrinkle of disapproval—before crawling onto the bed and wrapping himself around Draco.
send over and help out in Ireland if the situation escalated. Their Ministry had requested reinforcements from their allies, and apparently they'd finally convinced Britain to take the threat seriously. They were still working out the details, but Harry knew he wasn't the only one with the urge to go and fight. Parvati had told him in confidence that she was planning on signing up, though she wanted to get her sister's blessing first, which wasn't going well.
"Stay the night," Draco said after he'd pulled out and cleaned them both off. They were curled up together naked on Draco's massive and ridiculously comfortable bed. The last thing on Harry's mind was leaving.
Harry held onto Draco's hips for dear life as Draco started to ride him in earnest, fucking himself on Harry's cock with a fluidity and skill that told Harry this definitely wasn't the first time Draco had done this. Not that Harry had ever thought Draco was inexperienced, but for some foolish reason he'd not expected Draco to display such a clear and obvious enjoyment of a good dicking. But as Draco had said, there was no confusion as to who was in charge here. Harry lay all but helpless beneath Draco as Draco brought them both closer and closer to climax.
Harry glared at him, even as the look on Draco's face made hope flicker inside his chest.
"But?" Harry could tell there was something Draco was leaving unsaid and he'd rather just have it out already.
Draco made a grumbling sound and when Harry looked down at him, he was honest-to-god pouting.
Graham gave Draco a startled look, peering at him intently before his expression cleared with apparent recognition, his eyes softening. "Ah, yes, I didn't recognise you in this uniform. She's playing, yes. She was quite shaken up after last night."
Harry could tell that Draco wasn't happy with him.
-Blaise
Harry was nervous enough about telling his friends about his relationship with Draco as it was, but what if somebody were to find about the other things he and Draco did together? He could tell himself over and over again that pretending to be a little kid for a while was nothing to be ashamed of, but it was hard to make himself believe that when he imagined other people discovering that particular proclivity. How would anybody take him seriously? Thinking about the judgemental looks and horrible
