And now, she was still showing him kindness. Even her suffering at the hands of his family did not break her spirit.
There were still four long tables set up for each of the houses with a table at the top for the staff. However, there was another table close to the back, perpendicular to the four house tables, that was slightly smaller than the rest. It was decorated as finely as the rest and had room for about twenty individuals.
“Why didn’t you go to the Hospital Wing immediately? And why didn’t you report the attack to me as soon as it happened?”
She held him at arms length and cupped his face in her hands. “Oh, my dragon. You look so much better than you did when you were last here.”
The next hour managed to calm Draco down quite a bit. Harry seemed to understand that Draco was finished discussing his parents’ imprisonment for now—goodness knows he would have to do so time and time again in the next few months. Instead they amicably remembered their youth. They went through each year telling stories about the ridiculous things that they used to do to antagonize each other. Draco even managed to eat about half a sandwich. As long as he was stern with himself and made sure to not think about his parents, he was alright. A smile and laugh or two even escaped his lips.
Draco, usually sitting at his desk doing homework that wasn’t due for weeks, would respond, “No, thank you.” He would rather have been rude, but Mr. Burke’s words echoed in his mind: “
“Yeah, but these sort of memories have to be very...concentrated. It has to fill you with really intense happiness. We can give it a try, though. Stand up and take out your wand.” Draco complied. Harry showed him the hand motion for casting the spell. “Now, close your eyes and let everything you just told me flow through you. Don’t think about the details of the day, though. Think about the feeling, let it build inside of you. Think about how happy you were and how loved you felt. And when you’re ready, cast the spell.”
“Shite. That can wait, though, I was supposed to—“ he glanced quickly at Harry. What was he going to tell him? Sure, he had class, but he surely would never be distressed about missing it. “I had to—“
“Yes, yes, how incredibly tragic,” the interrupting wizard drawled sarcastically. “It isn’t as if dozens of others experienced the same over the past few years.”
There had been many more dreadful weeks after that, and many more that ended with horrifying things that he didn’t see coming. What he never dealt with, however, is a week that was so fantastic that he dreaded its end, because he knew it would end in misery.
The train ride back to Hogwarts was spent mostly in silence, with Harry putting his head on Draco’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Though they didn’t agree that this was an official first date, Draco felt happier than ever at the prospect that dating Potter was one door, at least, that was still open.
“I noticed that you have continued your sessions with the Mind Healer. I’m very happy about that. I know it can’t be easy.”
He sat down stiffly on the chair, which was enormously uncomfortable. He put his still aching head in his hands and started to think.
Draco ran shaking hands through his hair. The clock said it was five thirty—it wasn’t even time to wake up yet.
After a few more minutes of trying to get his breath back, what Potter had said earlier sunk into Draco. “Did you say it’s eleven?”
Mr. Burke stood up heavily. “My clients plead not guilty, Madam.” Beside him, Narcissa looked firmly at the crowd, but not one particular person, while Lucius’s eyes darted around in a paranoid manner.
“Sometimes that’s not possible,” Blaise said. “And the point of this year is for us to build up our lives enough again so that we can go our separate ways in peace. It’s not selfish to want a good life, Draco.”
Draco knew that everything Kingsley was saying made sense. And who knows, maybe Theo wanted to bring the Dark Lord back and wasn’t being influenced by his father as much as Draco suspected. So Draco didn’t push it, but felt extremely uncomfortable upon leaving the Headmistress’s office. Did Theo even deserve anyone’s help? He could have asked for it after the war instead of fleeing. But Draco’s other friends like Pansy also left just because of how they thought they would be treated by the victors. Draco remembered vividly how trapped he felt, how much he wished the Ministry would turn a blind eye to his family just for a moment so they could flee with the Parkinsons, the Notts, and others.
“Don’t cry. It’s going to be alright.” Had Draco been crying? He hadn’t even noticed until Harry pointed it out.
Draco barely had time to be nervous or dawdle in getting ready. The Ministry official was early and seemed very impatient to get his job done. He fastened a manacle on Narcissa’s wrist that seemed to be the brother of the one on Draco’s. Draco wasn’t sure why Narcissa didn’t have one to begin with, but assumed that no magic, except for possibly that exclusive to house elves, could be done inside the Manor. There was no way for him to test his theory, but that was the simplest explanation. Once everything was secured, Narcissa was still a little slow on her feet, and Draco stood between her and the official. The stern man seemed so irritated that he looked ready to drag Narcissa down the steps of the Manor.
“Nothing is going to happen to me, Harry. But I’ll tell you what is going to happen to you,” Draco took off his shirt. “You’re going to have a great year here at school with everyone worshipping you, and you’re going to have fun spending time with your friends, then you’ll graduate and get whatever job you want immediately, but you’ll probably end up as a professor at this school because you can’t bear to leave this hellhole, and you’ll live happily ever after.” Though there were some quips in the picture of Harry’s future that Draco painted, he didn’t mean any of them in a bad way. “But not if you mess it up. So just relax for once in your life, alright?”
“Merlin,” Blaise sighed. “It’s going to be so unbearable with Potter here now.” He turned to Draco. “We were talking about our new living arrangements on the train. All the eighth years are going to share one dorm room instead of being divided into houses—for
The Auror grabbed his wrist, and Draco felt the nauseating sensation that he recognized as side-along Apparation. As soon as he landed in some sort of an office, he ran to vomit in the nearest wastebin. Taking a blow to the head and then feeling like you’re being suffocated in a narrow tube will do that, apparently. The Auror who apparated Draco sighed and steered him to the nearest chair.
Draco shuddered. “Yeah that wasn’t pleasant. My human thoughts went away, so I really had no clue what was happening. That’s one of the only times I was grateful for Professor McGonagall.”
“Where are we going to go? Do we even know where we’re staying?” Draco wasn’t sure exactly what information was in the letters he ignored all summer.
Draco supposed that Dean used breakfast to remind him so that he would have the whole day to break up with Harry. But he did no such thing. They spent their time celebrating the first snowfall of the year, with Draco showing Harry how to ice skate on the lake above the giant squid, and Harry pelting Draco with snowballs when he got the chance.
Harry looked at Draco like he doubted him, but continued to gather his things and didn’t mention anything. “Glad to hear it. I’m planning on talking to Kingsley about this magic-blocking band of yours.”
“No, Draco, you’re not—I’m not mad at you or anything. You’re just really ill, okay? I don’t even know if you’ll remember this. You need to get better so that I can have someone to sleep next to, okay?” Harry gave him a reassuring smile.
“Potter, you can’t tell me that the entire Ministry would stop moving if you wanted to see someone in it. Why don’t you just sneak Draco in along with you?” Daphne asked.
Draco hated the Room of Requirement, but for a moment wished it was still functioning so that he could turn it into something Harry would love. On Friday, the day before the date, he found it nearly impossible to pay attention in his classes. Harry noticed when they were working on his Patronus in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“No, I haven’t. I feel cowardly, not wanting to face him.” Christine raised her eyebrows. “I feel like some of what he says is true. And I’m his son, it would be weird not to see him.”
The only other eventful thing that happened during that week was Draco receiving a letter from Mr. Burke.
Draco actually woke up for the first time in days.  The past few nights had been like a slideshow of his worst fears realized. He had both flashbacks and visions of things that thankfully never happened. He saw Potter’s dead body in Hagrid’s arms dozens of times, but in half of the dreams he never leapt out to save them all.
“No, I’m just...going to throw them away.” In truth, Draco planned to keep the letters in his drawer, lest he ever forgot who he really was.
Draco found Harry a very easy student in regards to Occlumency, and the Boy Who Lived was now able to show him nearly any memory Draco requested. After running out of specific ones to ask for, Draco let Potter come up with some on his own. This was harder, because Potter had to remember every detail unprompted. However, all the memories came through very clearly, and Draco learned more about Harry along the way. His nemesis really did have an awful childhood, with clearly abusive relatives.
Finally, for anyone who has sadly read the Cursed Child, sorry to bring up any painful memories of that script. It isn’t a terrible idea, someone trying to bring Voldemort back using a Time Turner, but it was just executed horribly in the Cursed Child. It won’t really pertain to this story a whole lot (which is obviously not Cursed Child-compliant), but it gives the former Death Eaters something to do, lol.
“I just really have no reason to be this anxious. This is probably the happiest I’ve ever been! I have good friends, I’m doing well in school, I have you—I’m being stupid.”
Narcissa’s eyes filled with tears. “I’m so glad you’re safe, Dragon. You could have—“ she sobbed, something that Draco had not seen her do in a long time. “D-Dolohov, he could have—“ she pressed her hands hard to her eyes, mirroring what Draco usually does when he doesn’t want to show emotion.
“Psh. I’d prefer someone who didn’t care, or even didn’t know who I was.” They were both silent for a few moments. Draco began to move to get ready for bed. “Draco—thanks. It feels good to talk this out. I appreciate it.”
“So then what’s the point? If I’ll have to deal with this for the rest of my life, why bother putting myself through talking about it all?”
“Okay fine, no contract. But still, we should decide a few things. Are we...like if anyone asks, should I...”
“It doesn’t matter if you had used a Polyjuice Potion, Draco, that’s not the point!” Mr. Burke boomed, putting a fist on the desk. “First, you refuse to pay a visit to your father in Azkaban. Then, you go off galavanting in Diagon Alley, somewhere even unrestricted students aren’t even allowed to be, and to top it all off, you were with Harry Potter of all individuals! What if you had done something to upset him? What if you had been seen with him? Do you have any idea how careless you were being?”
“There’s a nice restaurant a few blocks from here,” Draco said. He used to go to the Italian place every year with his parents while they did his school shopping. In sixth year, he went with just his mother. He would give anything to be able to take her out to dinner again. His stomach churned at the thought of his parents and the fate they would be facing in the next few days, but he pushed the thoughts out of his mind and tried to focus on Harry’s presence next to him.
And they did keep trying, but Draco was unsuccessful every time. They tried using a different memory, tried different hand motions, even cast different spells after a while to make sure that Draco’s magic hadn’t suddenly left him completely. Finally, Draco shoved his wand back in his pocket.
Draco took a moment to think. “Sort of what you said. He’s the only one who can make everything...quieter, you know? In a good way. Everything’s just so loud inside my head sometimes, thinking about everything that happened in the past few years and everything I have left to go through. But when I’m with him I can sort of just...be. He treats me the same whether I’m having a good day or bad, and he comforts me when needed. He drives my days and my life forward. I just want to hold him and make him feel as good as I feel when I’m around him.”
“Yeah,” Greg didn’t look as traumatized by the bad news as Draco had been about his—though Draco was certainly more upset that Narcissa was in Azkaban than Lucius. “Something about a cover up. A lot of previous Death Eaters that had been forgiven are now back in Azkaban awaiting retrial. The ones that are already in Azkaban are now getting less privileges, stricter punishments. Something about the Nott family, I guess.”
“Draco, you have anxiety problems. They don’t just go away that easily, unfortunately. Just because you’ve had a good stretch doesn’t mean you won’t still have bad periods time and again. And when you have a bad time, it doesn’t mean you haven’t made any progress.”
“It was a big deal,” Draco said, answering his own question from earlier about why people couldn’t move on. “Death is forever. And I know the Weasley’s are like family to you. You’ve lost so many people, it only makes sense that you would worry about losing them, too.”
“Well, enjoy having these problems, I suppose. Guys, girls, I’m sure whoever and whatever would line up for a chance to date the Boy Who Lived.”
Harry made eye contact with Draco. “She lied to Voldemort, one of the most skilled Occlumens of all time. She can handle Azkaban. I promise.”
Draco was now starting to feel the lingering effects of the Dementors. He willed himself not to have a panic attack here, but his breathing was becoming more and more rapid. Yarney could just leave him in this room to die if he wanted, and there would be nothing Draco could do about it. Draco laughed to himself—a fitting punishment for someone who housed multiple people in their basement dungeon for the better part of last year.
“Well, it’s honestly not too nice of a house either. We cleaned all day every day for months and it never got any better.”
“Well, it wasn’t last year. Not when I was on the run.” Now that he mentioned it, Draco realized there was so much he didn’t know about what Potter spent the past year doing. Defeating the Dark Lord, certainly, but what did being away for a year do? Why didn’t Potter just storm Malfoy Manor and kill him right off the bat? Draco shook his head to clear his mind and returned his focus to his morose nemesis.
“Potter doesn’t like blokes,” Draco scoffed. But then he thought about it some more. “I mean, I don’t think he does. He knows I’m gay but his side of things hasn’t come up.”
“I’m sorry that happened to you. I have to go.” Luna started to say something in response but Draco pushed past her and bolted for the nearest restroom.
“Still, this is ridiculous,” Daphne said. “I would almost feel better if the Ministry were still snooping through mail.”
He finally understood. They were doing what it seemed like the Ministry would not. They were doing it in honor of those who lost and were lost. They felt like everything they fought for had been forgotten, and they were trying to rectify it. They were attempting to fight former Death Eaters—and he was on their list.
“Oh,” Draco scoffed. “You won’t believe this—I was trapped in a compartment with Saint Potter. I boarded the train early to try and find an empty one and he goes barging in, disturbing my peace, and insisted on staying.”
Draco made a decision and thankfully picked up the real water glass. He took a sip, wanting to sober up as quickly as he had wanted to get drunk only a few moments ago. “Well, you wouldn’t, would you?”
It was a few minutes past ten, and the Slytherins appeared to be the last ones there. Potter must have prepared the others that the former Death Eater was coming, because Draco was met with only reluctant nods—no jeers or insults. Harry smiled at Draco, and Draco gave him a friendly nod in return.
“Of course you don’t. But you’re the Boy Who Lived. You can have any job that you’d like once we get out of this place.”
Draco sat in the hard wooden chair, feeling just as uncomfortable as he did waiting for the Mind Healer the previous day. He really didn’t want to fail in front of Potter. He couldn’t help but feel a little angry—Potter should
“And you were great,” Harry said. “You stood up for yourself. I’m really, really proud of you.”  With a final kiss and those words echoing in his ears, Draco settled down to a surprisingly restful sleep.
It was incredibly hard to tell whether Draco’s racing heart was from physical exertion or from terror. He finally made it to the front door and was reaching for the knocker when his mother flung it open.
Lucius scoffed. “Darling, don’t you know that the universe is out to get us? Even if I manage to not get arrested again, they’re going to take the entire family fortune. They’re going to ruin any prospects the Malfoys have for redemption, and if they don’t, our son will.” Draco balked at Lucius speaking about him like he wasn’t in the room. Though his father sounded more lucid, the words coming out of his mouth did not.
With a final embrace, Draco made his way outside. It was already dark, with the only light coming from the half moon above. Draco felt entirely numb—more so than when he had hypothermia in the last month. In fact, looking back later, Draco had no idea how he came to stand in front of the bizarre structure that had to have been the Burrow. But all of a sudden, he scented Harry as his arms wrapped around Draco.
“Yeah but if they’re spewing this nonsense about unity and harmony and whatever, there’s no way they’re going to let us room together,” Blaise said, gesturing to Draco and Greg. “And I don’t know who you’d be living with, Daphne, but hopefully not the mudblood Granger.” Draco felt a sharp and unnatural twinge of disgust at the use of that word—come to think of it, he hadn’t said it in months.
Professor McGonagall sighed. “I don’t want any students being attacked at this school, particularly by other students. We’ve had enough of that for a lifetime. I’m assuming you don’t want to tell me who attacked you? Potter said he didn’t know.” Draco shook his head. “Very well. But I need you to understand that you are allowed to tell me these things. You don’t deserve to be attacked.”
Draco clenched his fist. “I don’t even know if I’ll be able to see the trial now, since I’m not a witness or anything.”
Madame Pomfrey met his gaze and spoke gently. “Likely from overexposure to curses, dear.” Draco couldn’t recall a time when Madame Pomfrey ever called him ‘dear.’ “Not to worry, the long-term effects are not significant, though much more and they would have been. If you’d like, there are exercises you can do to help your brain heal.”
“I just mean that you were a kid when you were doing all that! And clearly you’re terrible at trying to kill people, no offense.” Draco let out a huff and took another sip of his water. “I just don’t feel like Madame Rosmerta should be that cross with you. We’ve all been through enough. Sometimes I wish everyone would just move on from old feuds. I know we’re all grieving, but there’s no point in holding on to such hatred. It just distracts from the real issue, which is that there are still dozens of Death Eaters roaming free.”
“If you’re about to tell all of us we have a Muggle ailment, then I can’t take you seriously. Not that I could to begin with,” Blaise piped up again.
Draco looked up. Maybe this meeting wasn’t about what he thought it would be. He never visited the Professor to sign up for a session with the Mind Healer like Granger said everyone had to do. Even Blaise made an appointment yesterday, saying that he doesn’t mind sitting in silence for an hour every week if that would keep him out of trouble. But the thought of Draco sitting in silence for an hour while under scrutiny was too close to the Death Eater meetings he had to attend. He hoped it would pass Professor McGonagall’s notice, and possibly he was right. “I’m not?”
The Ministry worker—somewhat roughly, to Draco’s annoyance—escorted Narcissa through the Floo. When he returned, thankfully to the same room, Draco slipped behind him before the door shut. There wasn’t a clock in sight, so Draco wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but he knew that he quickly needed to get back to Kingsley’s office.
Evidently, someone released Harry from his curse. He slid over to Draco, who was still helplessly slumped under the post.
“Luna actually came to find us in the Great Hall,” Harry said, sitting on the edge of Draco’s bed. “She said that...she ran into you at the Astronomy Tower.” Harry paused, and Hermione looked down. “She told us you didn’t seem to be doing...too well. I decided to head back to the room to grab something and see where you were and Hermione came with me. We saw the blood trail in the hallway.”
The day of his rumored imprisonment, he wrote letters to his friends, and admittedly one to Potter asking him to free Narcissa, and put them on his neatly made bed so that whoever would deal with his possessions would find them easily. He worried they would never be delivered, but told himself that it was a temporary worry—every concern was. He didn’t plan to stay in Azkaban long—not in the way his father did, where he planned to either escape through dark magic or bribery—because he was going to sleep his life away in the cell. He was going to stop eating and drinking, and wait for the end.
Ron grinned. “I wouldn’t say Bill is doing too badly—he did end up with Fleur Delacour, and their first child is due in May.”
“Granger.” He greeted her calmly but with a somewhat cool tone. While the two had reached nearly friendly terms, Draco didn’t think they ever would get there. However, they had something in common—a deep affection for Harry. Hermione looked up at him expectantly. “I have an idea.”
“That’s a great point, Neville. I would love to hear his side of things. Tell me, Malfoy, what were you doing while students were screaming in your family’s dungeon?”
“What if...what if he’s right? I mean, he did tell me not to go anywhere or do anything or it may mess things up with my parents—“
“Professor McGonagall is alright with us going to the Ministry today. We can even use her Floo,” Hermione said happily. She wasn’t wearing her Hogwarts robes today, just a professional blazer and skirt. She also held a stack of folders in her hands, presumably something about house elves. Though Draco wasn’t sure at all how he felt about the creatures, he couldn’t help but admire her perseverance. He used to have the same kind of drive.
His second concern was his final presentation in Defense Against the Dark Arts before the break. He still had failed to produce a full Patronus. The closest he had come, despite Harry’s amazing teachings, was the faint outline of some sort of creature. It was merely a whisp, and Draco couldn’t even ascertain what sort of an animal it was going to be. Draco did not want his poor performance to reflect badly on Harry, but his boyfriend did not seem concerned.
“Sounds good,” Draco said, and walked behind Harry to their room. He was smiling, like he had a little secret.
On the other side, Draco still had not been able to produce a Patronus. Harry didn’t seem worried, which almost made things worse. He was so kind and encouraging, and he was such a good teacher. Draco was worried that Harry felt like Draco’s failure was attributed to his teaching skills.
“You already have. Because I cannot trust you enough to be a witness at tomorrow’s trial.” Mr. Burke put a hand on his briefcase and stood up suddenly. “I think we are done here. I’m sure you’ll be able to hear the outcome from the
“No, Malfoy, drop out of the Quidditch team. What do you think?” Draco flinched again at the use of his last name.
Draco didn’t scream as he woke up from that dream, which wasn’t quite a nightmare but was drifting ever close to being one. His pillow was wet from tears that he had shed as an eleven year old. He sat up at looked at the clock: it was a quarter past three. Harry was sleeping soundly in his own bed, while Draco’s was cold on one side.
“Turn yourself in for what? Did you even play any part in this? Are you hiding something from the Aurors?”
This did not help Draco’s already unsettled stomach, and he fell to his knees and heaved near the ocean. The freezing salt water spraying on his face exacerbated his shaking. Yarney and Draco had landed on a small island next to the looming Azkaban prison. It had a dock with small rowboats and a building into which Yarney dragged Draco after he collected himself.
“Potter, I don’t want to be in any group. I have better things to do than sit around and be criticized.”
“It’s no trouble.” He looked up straight into the eyes of Mr. Burke, holding his beret. The Malfoy family lawyer’s expression changed from politeness to wariness. “Wait...” he said, no doubt recognizing Draco’s eyes.
“I know,” Daphne said softly. “We can just start small, though. Like Draco did. I’m really proud of you for apologizing to Lovegood, by the way,” Daphne said. “It’ll make you feel better too.”
As September bled into October, the eighth years were making some headway with designing a memorial for the fallen. Some of the initial animosity between the four Slytherins and the rest of the students was waning, though people certainly still hated Draco the most. It was even agreed upon, by a narrow majority, that Vincent’s name would sit among the other fallen students. Greg beamed as the final vote was cast, knowing that the man he had loved would be immortalized, though not in the way anyone thought or expected.
“No it wasn’t,” Draco scoffed. “I told them about it so that they’d stop looking at me like I was a criminal. There’s nothing brave about that, it’s selfish.”
Narcissa got up shakily and walked over to the looming chair in the center of the courtroom. As soon as she sat down gingerly and placed her hands on the armrests, chains engulfed her wrists. She jumped at the noise, but other than that looked quite composed. Draco felt a swell of pride for his mother, who rarely looked shaken by anything as the Malfoy matriarch. He also felt horrible at how painfully thin she looked.
“Actually, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall had gotten up from her desk and now stood behind Draco. “Would you be so kind as to walk Mr. Malfoy back to your room? He’s just received some terrible news, and he is still recovering from the head injury he received earlier today.”
Harry waved his wand so that his hair would turn to its normal coal black shade, and went inside, presumably to talk to Ron. He then ushered Draco in under the cloak, moving upstairs under the watchful and reproachful gaze of Ron so they could use Weasley’s Floo. Finally the two were back on safe grounds.
With Draco Malfoy’s parents, Narcissa and Lucius, currently awaiting retrial in Azkaban, it makes sense that the young Malfoy would want to get close to Potter. If all goes according to Draco Malfoy’s plan, Potter could be ready to testify on his parents’ behalf by the hearing in early November—just three short weeks from now. It is unknown whether he is using a love potion or even the Imperius Curse to do so, but the Prophet nevertheless encourages readers to take caution when interacting with even so-called “reformed” members of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s army.
“Potter, while I dislike the arrogance that your presence brings out in others, I also dislike people not taking credit where it is due. There’s no way the Dark Lord could have been defeated without you; the specific decisions that you made, and the specific actions that you took. Sure, other people probably helped, but ultimately it was you who did the deed. And...” Draco looked at the beaming Harry. “And I’m grateful.”
Draco didn’t waste time going back to his room—he had been risky enough for one evening. He entered silently, finding Harry in the same position in which he left him, except more stretched out. There was no more room on the couch. Draco kissed Harry’s forehead, grabbed a pillow from his bed and Harry’s duvet, and slept peacefully next to him on the floor.
. Draco tried to clear his head as he moved toward his friends, and then startled as he noticed that Harry was already sitting with them. There was a spot in between Harry and Blaise where Draco assumed he was going to sit. Daphne picked at her food across from Harry, and Greg also looked uncomfortable.
Thank you all so much for your love! I realized my italics from copy/paste don’t transfer so hopefully I got all of them manually. Hopefully the next chapter will be posted tomorrow
“That’s great, mum,” Draco said, using the informal name for Narcissa in a rarity. He had seen her look happy—she had smiled when he visited her in Azkaban, when she first saw that he was safe during the final battle. He had seen her laugh politely. It wasn’t as if she had spent the past year of her life in some sort of a cloud. But for the first time in a long time, Draco realized that his mother looked proud. And if she could be proud, so could he.
Blaise pulled out his hawthorn wand, not speaking but casting a Stinging Hex on Justin, whose nose began to swell.
“Alright,” Harry said, getting out the Invisibility Cloak. “But getting back by Floo Powder unnoticed is going to be a lot harder. I don’t suppose the Vanishing Cabinet is still working?”
Harry sat down next to Draco, who was fiddling distractedly with his wand. “Is it...is it about tomorrow? We don’t have to go if you don’t want to, I understand if you’ve changed your mind.”
The first in his memory was the week before he was going to get the Dark Mark. He had made his decision that he was going to become a Death Eater to save his family. That had felt like the hard part—he had hoped it would have been the hard part. But the week of waiting was nearly worse. His house was overrun with criminal visitors, the hallways were adorned with hush whispers about his safety and sacrifice. His Aunt Bella praised him enormously while his mother lost her temper more than Draco had ever seen, even kicking one of the house elves once. Draco was almost relieved when the day finally came for him to be Marked, though he shouldn’t have been. He couldn’t sleep the night beforehand due to anticipation, and he couldn’t sleep the night afterward due to the pain.
Draco had spent the rest of the day dozing off and on and chatting with Blaise, Daphne, and even Gregory, all three of whom stuck around in his bedroom. Harry was gracious enough to leave the three of them alone until late at night. Shockingly, Draco hadn’t any nightmares—it seems his body was too worn out for his mind to take over.
Draco saw Harry settled in a chair and sat next to him. Most of the pairs appeared to have a third party sitting in the middle, repelling each person away from each other. Draco sat normally and saw that Harry’s feet were pointed toward him.
“Well, what exactly would happen if your parents found out? Like through someone else, or through the press?”
“He asked if Pansy and I were ever together.” Draco leaned back on Greg’s bed, getting tired. “Besides,” he said with his hands over his eyes. “If Potter did like blokes, he certainly wouldn’t like me.”
Potter actually looked annoyed at this. “Look, Draco, I genuinely thought you had changed and we could start out on a different foot. The past is in the past—“
“I’m not sure I’m the one that it’s affecting,” Draco said. “You need to take care of yourself, too, okay? Don’t worry about me. I’m fine.”
It was strange—even without his family’s social capital or wealth, Draco had never felt like he lived a more cushy lifestyle. Here he was at school, dating the most famous wizard in the world, in relatively good health, and with at least one parent who still loved him. That was so much more than some others had, and here he was worrying about things he couldn’t even control.
Draco let Harry talked about Ministry woes while he leaned back and closed his eyes. He was feeling more aware by the second, and then suddenly it hit him that he discussed dating Potter. He shot up in the bench with horror, and Harry startled next to him.
“This is a terrible idea,” Blaise said, though it actually did not take much convincing for him to come along. “They didn’t even invite us.”
Auror Yarney moved to a cabinet and pulled out a thick file. He began skimming over the papers. After a few minutes, a long letter came zooming out of the fireplace next to his desk. Draco sat, fidgeting in his chair, as Yarney read the contents. “Interesting,” he mused. “Why didn’t you mention that Dolohov claimed your parents know more than they’re letting on?”
“Isn’t that...Theo’s owl?” Greg said quietly, as though he was afraid to even say Theodore Nott’s name too loudly. It had been published in the
“So the agreement was that you were to accompany him to an undisclosed location, and in exchange you and your family would be safe? Is that correct? There were no other terms?”
Draco quickly turned away from Potter to hide his upset expression. “I’m fine, Potter,” he said, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice. “Why are you in bed?”
“Goodness, please don’t,” Draco said in a serious but somewhat light tone. “Hey—“ he said, stopping Harry for a moment. “You could have...I mean you didn’t have to tell Smith that...I wouldn’t have been mad if you said we weren’t dating.”
. “I thought that you might be too busy to stop by and sign up, so I wanted to force the issue, if you will.” She reached behind her and picked up a piece of paper. “There are appointments available on Tuesdays at 3 and 4pm, Wednesdays at—“
“Fine,” Draco broke the silence. “Occlumency it is.” Anything to shut Potter up before he opened a door he didn’t walk to walk through.
Draco stood up from the Gobstones table and nodded. “Yup, let’s go.” Thank goodness his friends refrained from any untoward or obnoxious comments.
“I—I just don’t know why I bother, no one is ever going to forgive me for anything. I don’t deserve for anyone to forgive me, I—“
“I dunno...” Harry said, thinking. “Wait a minute! We’re wizards!” With a wave of his wand, he conjured a small couch that could hold the two of them by the window.
“No, just wanted to see how you were doing before your big date!” Blaise sat on Harry’s bed, which hadn’t been slept in for a few weeks. “Potter makes his bed?”
“I want to know what this business is about honoring our ‘heroes and villains.’ Do they expect us to honor He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?” Dean was glaring at Draco the whole time he spoke.
Draco held up his manacled wrist. “This is part of my probation. I was going to just sit here, too, and not say anything. But I don’t want my family to get in any more trouble than we already are. So, let’s just get this done, if you don’t mind.”
“Ah, great. You’re trying to capture Death Eaters, yeah? Well you got me, good job. It was really difficult, me choosing Hogwarts as my secret hideout and all. It’s been so hard being on the run—”
Daphne, Blaise, and Greg all looked at each other for a moment, having some sort of secret conversation. Blaise nodded. “Then I guess we’ll have to get used to having you around,” he said somewhat reluctantly. Draco knew that it was out of care, though. He was surprised at how much his friends had begun to protect him. He wish he could say that he would have done the same—he certainly would now, but years ago? It was unlikely.
Draco had an enormous amount of faith in Harry, but even he wasn’t sure how the Boy Who Lived could make this right. But Draco did know one thing: for the first time in his conscious memory, Draco looked at Harry and felt as though he were falling in love.
Draco was expecting that almost all the eighth years were going to go, and that he was only casually invited. He was surprised at the intimacy of the group.
“Yeah but...I don’t know, maybe we’ve just been getting too close. Maybe I need to take a step back and let him breathe.”
“Are you alright? You seem more out of it than usual today, and last time that happened you were nearly poisoned.”
Draco feigned going to the library, but instead headed out to the lake to get some fresh air and think about Potter’s proposition. With his potions still in his book bag, he felt very much at a crossroads: one between physical health and weakness, and between friendship and isolation. Throwing rocks into the lake absentmindedly, he couldn’t figure out which he wanted, or which he deserved.
“No,” Draco reassured Blaise truthfully. “It didn’t hurt, it was just gross. I’m sure it’s just a horrible metaphor for the darkness in my soul, or something.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to pull Draco in close, taking some of the lead. He unbuttoned Draco’s suit jacket without question, but his fingers hesitated at the collar of his undershirt. “Yes,” Draco whispered. “One thousand times, yes.”
“It is neither of those things, Draco. It is not a condition exclusive to Muggles and it is not a disease. It merely means that you have seen things that now adversely affect you in your day-to-day life. But it is entirely treatable, and we can have you feeling so much better.”
“Sorry. You must be tired. Just rest. I’ll be in the common room if you need anything.” Harry walked out the door, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts as both his body and mind tried to compensate for what he lost.
“Young Mr. Malfoy, exactly what are your intentions with Harry Potter?” Draco blanched at this question and nearly turned around, but the escort roughly shoved him forward again. He hoped that Narcissa hadn’t heard that inquiry above all the cacophony.
Their conversation was interrupted by a crash on the window. An owl hooted disdainfully and righted itself on the windowsill. Dean Thomas opened it and took the parchment from the owl, who ruffled its feathers to ward off any snow. “It’s for you, Malfoy.”
Harry scoffed. “I bet my house elf would love his head planted right by the portrait of Sirius’s mum.” He then looked at Draco, with them both still being hand in hand. “Maybe you could come over? Over Christmas. And help with the house and some other things.”
It seemed like Yarney was taking a lot longer than he had to bring his mother. The same sort of panic set into Draco—what if Yarney left him here in this cold, dark place? Finally the door creaked open and Yarney led in the figure that was supposed to be Lucius Malfoy. Draco couldn’t help but gawk—his father was nearly unrecognizable. All the weight he had gained back this summer was gone, and his face was skeletal. The expression on his face was the worst part—Draco’s father was glaring at him with a hatred in his eyes that Draco had rarely seen. The gaze was so intense that even with Lucius’s frail body, Draco was grateful he was in chains.
Draco looked up at the ceiling, now with a firm resolve. “You’re right. This is my decision, and I’ve made it.” He pulled Harry in more closely for another kiss.
“When is Bill getting here? I’m hoping he’ll be able to even out a Quidditch team,” Ginny said after swallowing.
Hagrid blinked at Draco, seeming a little taken aback. “Yer welcome. ‘S no problem, good ter have the company.”
For the next half hour, Draco and Potter worked together on the potion. Draco showed him the best techniques for cutting ingredients and how to measure gases properly. Finally the potion turned the correct color. “Great, now we just need to let it sit for twenty minutes.” They both sat tiredly on the stools, wiping sweat from their brows.
“Because it seemed to me like you’re always awfully upset about it. When someone does a bad thing and they aren’t upset about it, that’s when they don’t deserve forgiveness. Like the boy who killed me.” Suddenly the door slammed open and with a squeal Myrtle returned to her toilet.
They were stopped dozens of more times as they navigated their way up to the Ministry. When they finally reached the elaborate office, they found Hermione and Neville sitting before Kingsley Shacklebolt’s desk, and Daphne, Blaise, and Greg standing behind them, looking uncomfortable.
“I’m surprised you had the guts to tell us yourself. Dear,” Lucius said, turning to Narcissa. “Our son is not only perverted, but he is fraternizing with our mortal enemy.”
Potter stopped ruffling his clothing and gave a deep sigh. Draco suddenly felt a little guilty for being that harsh right off the bat. Maybe something truly awful had happened. “Potter.” He said, less as a question and more of a command to look at him. Potter’s eyes were red rimmed and tired. “What happened?”
“Oh, Mr. Potter!” This woman had the audacity to grab Harry’s arm. Draco wanted to hex her right then and there, but had no means of doing so. He reached his arm out, unsure of what to do with it, but sure that he wanted to protect Harry. “I never did get to thank you for what you did for—“
“Oh. No problem then. I think Hermione wanted to go this weekend anyway to get some gifts for the Weasley’s.”
“No one really specific except Ron and Hermione, unless someone else brought it up,” Harry said. “Mrs. Weasley may insist that you come by for Christmas if I let her know.”
“Yeah.” Harry sighed, and Draco looked at him expectantly, knowing that he wasn’t telling the truth. “It’s just...the concept of Voldemort coming back. Being brought back using a Time Turner. I just don’t want to have to do it all again,” he finished in a small voice.
“I don’t think that’s true. They are good people who are hurting very badly.” Professor McGonagall sighed. “You are now beyond adulthood, Mr. Malfoy. I cannot make your decisions for you. But I certainly don’t think it would hurt for you to ask them what you can do for them.”
Hermione and Neville, who seemed to be immersed in sketches for the memorial, looked at each other. “What’s going on?” Hermione asked.
Greg was the only one who kept on eating, seemingly unperturbed by this sudden announcement. Daphne and Blaise stared at Draco in shock, with Blaise’s fork clattering to his plate.
Draco spent fifteen minutes pacing around his bed. The couch wasn’t very comfortable last night. He knew his bed would be. But he was terrified that he would never get up, that the comforter was poisonous somehow. Taking a second glance at his notebook though, he knew that nothing could hurt him here. Harry was still here. And even though he wasn’t in the room, Draco knew that he could do this. He was in control of his own actions and feelings. Regardless of what his father knew about him, what the people at school thought they knew about him, he knew what he was worth and what he was capable of. He got in the bed and slept soundly.
This wasn’t a conventional nightmare. Draco didn’t wake up screaming or crying. He woke up and first had to check if his hands were wet and, by habit, if his tongue was still in place. As soon as he moved, he felt the pull in his stomach and the lump in his throat. He launched up from the couch and stumbled to the bed pole, trying to steady himself. It was no use. He barely found his way to the bathroom before he collapsed in front of the toilet, heaving. He hadn’t thrown up from a nightmare in a while, and he found the sensation to be unpleasantly familiar.
Something was wrong, something that had happened a few times this past summer and multiple times during sixth year, but that Draco hoped was an irregularity. He tried not to show to Potter his rapid breathing and shaking hands as he stood up to reach for his trunk. Spots flashed across his vision when he stood, and he found himself leaning on the wall.
“You gave up being able to decide for yourself a long time ago. Now sit.” Yarney pushed him roughly into the chair and set his chains in place.
All of a sudden the world shifted beneath him, and he saw the brightest light and heard a train whistle. He giggled—maybe he was going back to Hogsmeade? He hoped his mother would be there, he needed to give her a present.
Draco scoffed. “Actually, why are you here at all? I would have thought you’d be Head Auror right out of the gate.”
Draco felt a burn on his wrist, knowing the manacle was preventing him from a magical outburst. “I—you—“ he was rarely at a loss for words. “What I
Draco swept his hand across the empty common room. “I know you’re practically blind, but do you see a soul that is cooped up here instead of enjoying the season? I don’t. We’re going, and that’s final.”
Harry thought for a moment. “I guess it’s both. You cared about yourself that much to tell everyone something that was very difficult for you. That’s at least a type of bravery.”
“You’re no son of mine,” Lucius growled. His eyes looked a little glassy and unfocused but his anger clearly ran deep. “I bet you’re happy, aren’t you? Now you’ve got access to the Malfoy fortune. I bet this is what you’ve wanted this whole time. Pouting all summer like some sort of a child. You’ve always been pathetic, but I gave you so many chances to prove me wrong. And now you’ve put your mother and I in prison.” Lucius laughed. “Maybe you aren’t as stupid as I thought you were.”
Draco was slightly taken aback and disappointed, but then joined the rest in a small chuckle. “I really can never catch a break, huh? Not quite a dragon, but close enough,” he said good-naturedly.
Yarney opened the door and gestured for Draco to follow him outside. “Magic suppressor. It keeps you from performing any magic, but it also dampens the effects of the Dementors.”
The Slytherins proved to be a very needed addition to the group. The Gryffindors seemed to want to make these grandiose plans that had about fifty different ways they could go awry. Draco’s friends on the other hand thought of an easier strategy.
“Now—I need to hear exactly what happened.” Draco recounted the story from the beginning, leaving out why he and Potter were on the bench in the first place. He also couldn’t bear to tell the Auror that Dolohov claimed his parents knew more than they were letting on, even though he knew that was an important detail. Thinking of his mother being dragged back into the Ministry for more  questioning sent chills down his spine. The Auror remained mostly silent while Draco was talking, frowning at a few details here and there and chiming in for some basic questions. The story took no longer than 10 minutes or so to tell, and then both sat in silence while the Auror made some notes.
And Draco was fine, until the next morning. He was sitting at the Great Hall with Blaise, Daphne, and Goyle, actually feeling decently until the owls started to swoop down. Two of the dozen envelopes he received were Howlers—but as soon as Blaise saw them he grabbed them and ran out of the Great Hall. Draco’s heart was filled with warmth at that action; at least he would be spared the embarrassment of a hate letter being read to half the student body.
Draco felt quite numb as he walked back up to the eighth grade dormitory. His muscles were aching as though he had aged while in Azkaban even for that short amount of time. He had to lean on the stair railings heavily, shivering and feeling feverish. Thankfully he found the common area to be blissfully empty of anyone who would care where he had been—it was only a few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws playing a game in the corner.
“Hello, Draco,” Professor McGonagall said not unkindly. “The Minister would like to have a word with you regarding the return of the Time Turner. I will leave you two in peace.” She then walked upstairs to the more private office and left the alone.
Draco shook his head, memories of the afternoon flooding back to him. “It’s not what you think. I’m...I’m not going to be called as a witness tomorrow.”
?” He said more worriedly, and Harry burst out laughing. Draco nudged him sideways and threatened him until he finally spoke.
“Just after one.” Draco did some mental math. He was probably out in the hail and cold for about three or four hours. No wonder his fingertips were still numb. “Once I got you inside, I saw Ginny nearby. On the map. I wasn’t sure if she had something to do with your attack, but I definitely wanted to see if she was okay. She told me everything. She was pretty worked up, so I stayed with her for a while.” Harry looked at Draco sadly. “I had no idea about the new Dumbledore’s Army, or that shack. Why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
“You sort of always have.” She looked up sharply, confused. “I just thought maybe that would make you laugh. I was scared of you even when we were kids.”
After a few moments of silence, during which Draco’s hand twitched twice next to Harry’s, wanting to touch his hand but also being incredibly aware that they were walking together in public, Harry spoke. “I didn’t see you at breakfast this morning. I wanted to make sure you were upright.”
Draco was left with the echo of a smile as Blaise, Greg, and Daphne rushed at him, pulling him into Greg’s bedroom. They all spoke at once—
“So...Weasley,” Draco still used Ron’s last name, but without any malice and more as a formality. “How is that joke shop doing?” Draco tried not to say sarcastically.
Draco thought about it for a moment. He had a wonderful week. He loved being with Harry. The jeers and negative comments actually hadn’t been too bad, but Draco suspected that was because Ginny and Dean called off most of the naysayers until his week was up. Draco wasn’t sure what it was going to be like next week. He did know, however, that it didn’t matter. He wanted this bliss to last much longer than a week. “I’m not.”
Dolohov laughed. “You’d really let your friends die for this worthless piece of shite?” He pointed his wand at Draco.
Draco knew this was a simple puzzle, but for some reason his brain wasn’t cooperating. What did the “X”s mean?
“Of course,” Harry said awkwardly. “I had to go through a few different ones before I settled on the perfect memory. I don’t expect you to produce anything near a full Patronus today. It took me months.”
They practiced a few more times with other simple memories. Draco tried to bring up neutral memories that he shared with Potter to check whether the young man was doing Occlumency correctly. He and Potter watched their younger selves duel together in second year, looked as they trampled through the Forbidden Forest while serving detention (but stopped before they witnessed what they later found out to be the Dark Lord drinking unicorn blood). Revisiting some of these memories felt good—they were both laughing, and Harry seemed a lot more relaxed, making him able to perform better.
“I think they mind about at least four of us continuing our education,” Blaise muttered under his breath. Draco was too busy trying to keep his breathing even to speak. It was a combination of anxiety and atrophy that led him to being winded with every flight of stairs they climbed.
“I don’t know the exact parameters of that,” Harry said, gesturing to Draco’s manacle. “I don’t want to set off any alarm bells at the Ministry. We’re not too far away.”
Granger gave a friendly smile and got up from where she was sitting playing Gobstones. “Hey guys! McGonagall agreed to let us have a small celebration, since we’re of age and all. We’ve got about a half bottle of Firewhisky left, if you’re interested.”
Draco didn’t know much about either of them. Dean didn’t attend Hogwarts last year but eventually joined Luna Lovegood in the basement of Malfoy Manor. Draco remembered his piercing glares as he would bring down food to the prisoners. He also knew that Susan Bones had family that died earlier in the War. He felt sick looking at them. They seemed to feel similarly.
Draco complied and Yarney guided him into Azkaban. He wasn’t sure if it was just the Patronus or if there were no Dementors around, but he didn’t sense any particular change as they entered the prison. He felt the same amount of cold and fear, though his spine tingled every time he heard a scream from above. He listen closely for his mother’s scream, having become quite familiar with it over the past year, but was grateful not to hear it. Thankfully the pair didn’t have to climb any stairs—after a few minutes of walking, Draco was led into a room that helped shut out the horrifying cries from the prisoners.
“Welcome eighth-years! It’s so good to see you all. I’ve been told that you all are rooming in pairs—please sit with your roommate and we can get started.”
Ginny continued, not looking terribly angry. Did she believe him? “Okay, let’s say that you had nothing to do with this. Let’s say someone is trying to plant this in your possession to frame you. Even so, you don’t know Harry, Draco. He’s still really fragile. He’s not doing as well as he seems after everything. He needs something easy, something stable. If you truly care about him, you won’t mind waiting a few years. If it’s meant to be, you’ll find your way back to each other. But he doesn’t need his right now. You have to understand that.”
Draco had so many questions for Harry, so many things that he wanted to know. Where to start? “Do you know this area well? Growing up with the Muggles and all...”
Draco sighed and filled them in on his father’s letter. “I just don’t know what to do. I mean, we’re all going home to messed-up parents, but on top of it I’m dating the Boy Who Lived.”
“All the time,” Greg said, sounding glad that Draco mentioned it. “He wasn’t particularly kind to Vince and I, but he never really seemed to want to follow in his father’s footsteps.”
“Oh, this is the most clearly I’ve thought in years. All the hard work I concentrated into putting the Malfoys back to prestige in the Wizarding World, torn away in one second by you. Tell me, Draco, what exactly were you and Potter doing on that bench in Hogsmeade when Dolohov discovered you? I’ve always known you weren’t going to be a proper husband to any woman, but I never thought you would choose a companion deliberately to stain the family name.”
“I know, you’re right. I get it, I do. I’m just—I’m really starting to care about you. And it’s scary.”
“Well, things have at least settled down a little. You just have to remember that he’ll be waiting for you to make the first move.”
“Does it feel any better?” Harry had been a perfect boyfriend, staying with Draco all throughout their midday break as he battled anxiety and nausea.
All of a sudden he heard some sharp cracks as people materialized from the air. Spells immediately flew back and forth, with Dolohov’s apparent accomplices flying out from the Three Broomsticks, fighting the Aurors who Apparated into the village. Hermione and Neville burst out also, helping the Aurors fight the three Death Eaters.
“Of course,” Draco said after a moment. “And...thank you for inviting me here. I know it couldn’t have been easy.”
Draco jolted awake with a gasp, which was thankfully muffled by the sound of Harry lowering his trunk to his seat. He must have fallen asleep, much to his horror. It was now dark outside and Potter was—good lord, Potter was only in his undershirt.
Narcissa glanced at Mr. Burke hopefully. Draco wondered if she even knew that he wouldn’t be called as a witness today. “No, Madam,” Mr. Burke said somewhat bitterly. Inside the Invisibility Cloak, Harry put his hand on Draco’s, as if sensing that the only thing Draco wanted to do was run out to the center of the courtroom and be a witness to help his mother.
Draco thought of closing doors in his mind to attempt to block the tears from his eyes. He did not know that he needed to hear those words, and he could feel the ache in his chest as if Harry had pointed out a gaping wound in his soul. “Thank you,” was all he managed to get out.
Draco felt a little better at Harry’s low expectations, but also somewhat offended. Satisfied, he sighed. “I guess some of the early Christmases at the Manor.”
“I appreciate that, sweetheart. But why were you and Mr. Potter at Hogsmeade together? You shouldn’t be at Hogsmeade at all, you should be staying inside whenever possible.”
She sighed. “Have you ever been around Dementors, darling?” He shook his head. There had been a few that lingered around the castle in his third year, and he remember the sensation being somewhat unpleasant, but none of them had ever tried to feed off him. “They’re quite interesting creatures, actually. They feed off happy memories. Think about—think about a memory as an onion. Usually the layers of the onion never fall off. You can think about something over and over again without losing any of the memory’s value or content. But Dementors peel the layers away. Each time you think a happy thought, they steal it from you. You can only think of it with clarity a certain number more times.”
Potions was being taught by Slughorn again, Transfiguration by McGonagall, Care of Magical Creatures (which he was not taking) by Hagrid, Charms by Flitwick...one of the only differences was in Defense Against the Dark Arts, which was now being taught by someone named Professor Arden. He recognized his name in the back of his head from his trials at the Wizengamot. The name evoked an anxious reaction in his soul, but he vaguely remembered her questioning to not be as brutal as the others. It wasn’t listed on his schedule, but Draco also couldn’t help but thing of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies Professor that he watched—
“No, I mean...” Harry sighed. “You know how Hagrid came back carrying me? And everyone thought I was dead?” Draco nodded. “Well, I
“Is your family having the ball this year, Daph?” Draco was always uncomfortable with silence, so he was often the first to break it.
could come,” Blaise readjusted his grip on his broom as they walked out to the Quidditch pitch. “He didn’t say anything about the rest of us heathens.”
“Yes, and you know him so well from your years of tormenting him,” Ginny said cooly. Draco hated the way that made his heart feel.
“Well, it doesn’t bother me that much, but if your goal isn’t to be seen by anyone, I’m not sure if that’ll happen. This is almost more public than Hogsmeade, and we didn’t bring disguises or anything...”
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair, his nails scratching his scalp since he couldn’t flatten out his fingers. “I didn’t want to bother you about it. And I just wanted to prove to myself that I could solve a situation without messing up, for once.” Draco ignored Harry’s protests and continued. “I did go to McGonagall about it. She was a little helpful, told me that I should be empathetic. And I did, and I guess it somewhat worked out.” Draco shook his head, trying to clear his fuzzy brain. “So did McGonagall turn in the Time Turner?”
Granger went on to tell a story about fighting Nagini, who was disguised as Bathilda Bagshot. It was not too terribly depressing, but highly interesting, and by the end she had people clapping as she described their getaway.  “Who wants to go next?”
” It was all he could do to stay in his seat and try to let calm waves wash over him. Was it possible to have a panic attack over something good?
“That’s good,” she said, as though he were commenting on the weather. “Are you alright? You’ve got a red aura all around you, you have to be careful with that or you’ll attract—“
“You can’t control what people say, Harry. It’s completely not your fault.” Harry still looked dejected, so Draco lightly touched his hand. “I too am glad that you’ll always be around to keep me in line.” Harry smiled back, squeezing Draco’s finger, and the world felt right again.
“Are you sure? I’m sure you’ve been to plenty of nice dinners, I thought you may want to do something more unique. Money isn’t an issue, I can arrange—“
“Will you shut up Zabini?” Seamus said from where he was on the floor, holding Dean’s hand. “Yeah I’m sure you Death Eaters don’t have to worry about that since you were treated like royalty, but—“
Draco felt sweat on his brow, the hot air constricting his throat. “Can—can you make it cooler in here?”
“Ugh,” Draco said as he leaned back against the bathroom stall, curling into Harry’s side. He wiped his mouth and gave a sigh of relief as some of the tension left his body.
Draco asked Harry a question with his eyes, and Harry answered it by closing his. Slowly, Draco brought Harry’s face forward until their lips touched. One of Harry’s hands touched his neck, the other caressed his back. It wasn’t a long kiss, but it was electrifying. Draco never wanted to open his eyes again, but he wanted to make sure what he was doing was alright. He leaned back and watched for Harry’s reaction. His boyfriend—I still can’t believe it—smiled, and it was the greatest thing Draco had ever seen.
