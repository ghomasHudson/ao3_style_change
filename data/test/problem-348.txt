“Because it is forbidden and dark and scary. Come on, we need to find him before something else does.” Harry took off for the forest conjuring Hermione’s favorite blue flame to help light the way. As the light floated along next to him he cast a spell to trace Teddy’s magical signature so they could follow it right to him.
“I’m sure; I enjoy spending time with him.” Draco led the way up to Teddy’s bedroom and Harry stood watching them from the doorway.

Both of them, feeling a bit awkward, just stare at eachother for a moment before Draco asks, “What did you say?”
It isn’t that uncommon for Harry to have lunch with the two. When the three of them went out for lunch the first time, Harry thought it was Ron’s way of keeping a close eye on Malfoy, but not long after the third or fourth time, Harry began to see that Ron was beginning to consider Malfoy as a good friend even though they have a rocky past. Harry quickly confronted Ron and asked him what was going on—he may have accused him of going mental too, but that’s beside the point. The only thing Ron had to say was, “Draco’s changed, mate; he’s not the prat he was at Hogwarts.”
“You can talk to wolves?”
“That would be fine. Now off to bed with you before I have to write you up for being out passed curfew.”
In which Draco is the (in)famous erotica writer H.J. Belladonna, writing successful scandalous novel after successful scandalous novel and hiding his true identity, and Harry is questioning his sexuality after reading one of Belladonna’s books. Until ten years after the war their paths cross again, and Harry doesn’t only question his sexuality, but also the meaning of his obsession with Draco Malfoy.
“Why?” Harry can’t make sense of it; the only reasons he can think of all led to one conclusion, and he honestly can’t see that as a possibility.

“Last summer, I was trying to rescue Mrs. Clearson’s cat, they wouldn’t listen to me. But these wolves will talk to me and even ask me questions. Can they come live in Godric’s Hollow with us? They could teach those other wolves some manners.”
Harry stands to the side of the door, just out of sight, and listens as Malfoy’s voice weaves the tale of three witches who band together to try and reach a magical fountain along with an unlucky knight who just so happened to be pulled along into the garden by accident. The journey of the four of them as make their way up the hill and conquer the three obstacles they face before they reach the summit of the hill where the Fountain is located. Of how Altheda cures Asha of her ailments, of how Altheda plans to become rich from the herbs surrounding the Fountain and how Amata doesn’t feel her heartbreak anymore and sees no need for the Fountain’s enchantments. As it’s decided that Sir Luckless is to be given the right to bathe in the Fountain and is given the courage to throw himself at Amata’s feet to profess his love for her and ask for her heart. When Amata happily allows Sir Luckless to have it, trusting him not to break it as her previous lover had.

“Can I just have the chocolate frog now and eat the carrots later?”
“See you at work, Draco,” Harry smiles and watches as Draco disappears through the fireplace again.
"Yes! Harry doesn't like me taking toys to Nanny's. He says if I take all my toys there, I won't have none here," Teddy says.
Harry clears his throat, glances around, and can’t help himself from venturing, “So...that night you stayed late for drinks, you seemed pretty hammered to me. But the next day you said you were completely aware of what you were doing. Were you acting drunk?” The question has been plaguing him for weeks, he really can’t make sense of the situation.
“Really? Oh thank you Draco,” Teddy launched himself across the space between them spilling both tea cups and not caring that sixteen year olds didn’t do such things. “I promise, all homework done and no more night time wanderings. Can I still visit them on weekends? They wouldn’t understand if I just stopped coming to see them?”

As if on cue, Teddy shuffles his way into the room. One tiny fist rubbing at his eyes while the other is clutching his gigi and holding the corner to his mouth. He slowly ambles his way to the bed, the gigi dragging on the floor slightly. He scrambles to the top of the bed and promptly snuggles into the mess of blankets, once again pressing his corner to his face.

Draco handed Teddy a cup of tea and sat back to study the boy for a moment. He did seem more withdrawn and quiet this year. Draco had chalked it up to sixth year classes and the more demanding course load, but now he wondered if there was something else bothering him.
Summary:
Harry wakes up the next morning, painfully hard and his head pounding to an erratic beat. The little bit of light that seeps through his eyelids seems to be brighter than the god damned sun. He slowly crawls out of bed and stumbles into his en-suite bathroom. Fumbling in the medicine cabinet for a few minutes, Harry makes a small noise of triumph when his hand closes around a small vial of pain relieving potion and proceeds to down the contents in a swift motion.
“Okay, ready for lunch?” Harry asks, automatically guessing Draco’s going to stay for lunch.
Harry did not have an addiction to watching Draco masturbate on camera. He could stop any time he wanted to. Really.
Surprised, Draco looked at Harry and said, "I'll talk to Harry about it, but you'll see me again soon, I promise."

“Is it some fancy-pants restaurant that requires me to change?” Harry asks, eyeing Draco’s pressed black slacks and emerald green button-up shirt.
Draco was on hallway patrol when he paused by a window to watch the figure cross the grounds towards the forest. In the almost full moonlight he could tell that it was Teddy by the color of his hair, it had been shaggy and almost a silvery grey when he’d been in class that afternoon and it was still of the same look.

Harry didn’t know what to say or think. Glancing at the wolves he saw they were sitting there as if they understood the conversation that was going on and just waiting to start the game up again. They were indeed beautiful creatures; their coats were neither grey nor white, more silvery with eyes that were almost human in design. He made a mental note to check with McGonagall about them and see what she knew.

“You just seem really happy. I haven’t seen you this happy with anyone ever so I thought you might like him. So do you?” For such a young boy, he really observed a lot. Harry is actually surprised with how much he picks up on sometimes.
Clearing out a remote house full of cursed collectibles in the Outer Hebrides? Not a problem for an experienced curse breaker like Harry Potter. Spending a week with the straight, happily-married man that he’s starting to have feelings for? And sharing a bed with him at night? Surely Harry can handle that, too. But both the house and Draco Malfoy have secrets to uncover, and Harry might be in deeper water than he thought.

“So, where am I going to sleep?” Draco asks, watching as Ron and Harry pull out the couch bed with practiced ease. He assumes Ron stays the night here when he and Hermione get into a little tiff.
Harry’s in the middle of prying a portrait off of a wall in a spare bedroom on the third floor at number 12 Grimmauld Place when Andromeda knocks on the bedroom door. Startled, Harry nearly drops his wand and the hammer he had been using and exclaims, “Dromeda! I wasn’t expecting you to drop by for another few hours at least.” He glances around her to look for his godson, but when he can’t see him he turns back to Andromeda and asks, confusion lacing his voice, “Where’s Teddy?”
Shaking himself out of...whatever that was, Harry nods at Teddy, using a quick spell to change into regular clothes. “Yeah, go get your jacket, we’re following.” He casts a sidelong glance at Draco and walks out of the room.
Harry stares at her, face blank, and stiffly says, “What do you mean by that?”
Harry nearly drops his spatula as he looks up from his place at the stove to watch Draco, trying to be as discreet as possible, and sees Draco looking at him. He sees Draco swallow and say, “What are you talking about, Teddy?”

Harry is perfectly content with the life he built for himself; simple and private, it helps him heal the wounds from the war. He then accepts to go out with one of Neville’s acquaintances, never expecting that decision would bring him back to his obsession for Draco Malfoy.
Summary:
Harry Potter is the author of very well-written children's text books. Joshua Starkweather is the author of not-so-well-written erotic fiction. Only one person knows that they are one and the same.
After years of dancing around each other, Draco and Harry have finally begun to date, though they're taking things slow. They've got enough to figure out as it is, and the last thing Harry needs is an unexpected introduction to desires he's not quite ready to face.
Harry sets Teddy’s plate at the end of the table. “Teddy, eat up,” he says, gesturing to the plate when a somewhat startled Teddy looks up.
An accidental bond with Malfoy that resulted in them having to stay together at all times was the final straw.

Summary:
Harry and Draco are Auror partners. They're in a relationship that they've been forced to keep secret due to relationships between Aurors being forbidden. Harry is okay with this, as he hasn't come out to anyone other than Draco, but after a mission goes awry, their relationship is exposed.
. It's definitely not the right romantic setting for their first night together but, as Draco comes to realise, there's good in taking things slow.

Harry and Draco have to stay over at their friends' places for a few weeks, since the renovation of the Grimmauld Place hadn't been completed by the time they were back from their honeymoon. That creates a slight issue with being intimate but the newlyweds are nothing if not creative...
The three of them walk into the living room and floo into Diagon Alley.

"Then why aren't you and Harry Aurors? You guys are the coolest, goodest people I know."
“Oka-a-ay! Come on, Draco, I think there’s a functional guest bedroom on the third floor. If not, you can sleep in Teddy’s room.” Harry frantically pulls Draco out by his arm before Ron says anything else.
It’s hard enough to get five minutes to yourself in a house of five kids, nevermind getting five minutes with your boyfriend for anything else.
With the war finally over, Harry tries to find his own path in a world where he is free to make his own choice. On a holiday in France, he unexpectedly falls in love with art and painting. Returning to Hogwarts to help rebuild it, he is paired up with Draco Malfoy to restore the Room of Requirement - and unexpectedly falls in love with Draco. When the rebuilding efforts are done, Harry disappears.
"Well Teddy, not everyone would agree with you when you say that about me,” Draco doesn’t exactly volunteer this information willingly, because he loaths to say anything that would change Teddy’s opinion of him, but it’s really the only way to answer Teddy’s question, and he’s also loathes to lie to the child. “Not many people trust me after this big battle that happened shortly after you were born. As for Harry, from what I know, he wanted to be an Auror when we were in school, but when he met you he decided that being an Auror was too dangerous and did the next best thing."
It's 2005 and Harry has recently purchased a new mobile phone so he can easily keep in touch with his friends. Little did he know that the Muggle technology would lead him down a path of self discovery and safe exploration that would lead him into the soft recesses of the last person he ever expected. As it turns out, very good things can be found in the dark.
It doesn’t take him long to make them and fry up some bacon to go along with it. He wakes up Teddy and they start to eat in silence. About halfway through breakfast the sound of flooing can be heard in the other room. Confused, Harry looks up wondering who stopped by at such short notice. Only the Weasleys and Andromeda had a direct floo connection with 12 Grimmauld Place; anyone else would have to fire call ahead of time to ask to be let through. Because of this Harry is quite surprised to see Draco stroll into the kitchen.
Harry watches them come in and, when they reach him, takes Teddy’s hand from Draco before saying, "Thank you, Malfoy. I'll take him from here; you can run back to your Mum now."
(13288, Explicit)
"But I don't wanna eat, I wanna play with Draco," Teddy yells back, annoyed that he hasn't even had the chance to play with Draco yet.
"Doesn't Harry want you to find things on your own so you're not dependent on magic?" Draco accuses.
“It was getting a bit ridiculous. If I wanted to hex you, I would’ve done so at an earlier point in time...or last night, when you were alone and vulnerable,” Draco says, as if he’s had time to think about it, which really doesn’t bother Harry as much as it should.

at the door. He leads her away from the door and down the stairs. As they make their way to the living room Harry says, “Yeah, I know; but I still can’t get over how he treated me all those years at Hogwarts.”
No way in hell. He didn’t even look at the contract, because he knew he wouldn’t like it. He crumbled that up instead too. The owl was still waiting. Draco was tempted to write a curt ‘fuck off’ and be done with it, but that wouldn’t solve a damn thing. He needed a second opinion and he knew he would have to tell Harry the truth too. Which sucked, because things with Harry were going very well.
“Did you get prettier?” Harry asked.
“Yes, we knew, but soon everyone else will know too, if you two aren’t careful,” Neville replied.
“Just a tiny bit,” Draco answered.
“As I was saying: it doesn't matter to me what you did, I won't let you be murdered, Malfoy.”
“You didn’t like me. As far as I was told we were enemies,” Harry said.
Draco leaned over him and looked at him for a long moment. “You.”
“You think he and Julien worked together?” Harry asked.
“I’m a deviant, just ask the Prophet,” Draco said. Because really, the Prophet liked to speculate about his private life and quote the more scandalous scenes from his books. They also liked to write bad reviews of his books.
“Go out with him then,” Blaise said.
“She saw you paint one,” Potter said. It wasn’t a question; it seemed Potter was pretty sharp, after all.
“Henri doesn’t think it has anything to do with you directly," Draco said.
“Potter,” Pansy nodded. “Who would have thought we would be on the same side one day?”
Draco nodded. “Don’t ask me who it is.”
They settled for a fast food restaurant, because it was one of the still open warm public places where Harry got them coffees and something to eat for himself.
“Dinner is not a date,” Draco said sharply.
Draco laughed. “Who in their right mind would buy it?”
“The Boy who Lived?” Antoine answered with a laugh. “Hardly.”
“Someone with an extensive knowledge of spells could easily modify it,” Draco said. “Someone who likes to dig into old books and read runes.”
“I won’t,” Harry said.
“I’ll go and make tea,” Luna said in that dreamy voice of hers. She kissed Pansy’s cheek and went down the stairs to the kitchen.
“People might still come after him.”
“She really doesn’t like me and she knows that I stole you away,” Draco said once the door was closed and the house was warded again. Harry could feel the wards tightening, like a slight tug on his wrist. He wondered if he was so attuned to them after two weeks or if Draco had expanded them so that Harry could feel them too.
She nodded. “Well, I’ll talk to Pansy. She won’t try to kill you.”
Harry pulled back and licked his lips. “I want your cock inside me.”
Harry’s heart missed a beat. It wasn’t that no one ever had told him he was handsome, but no one ever had been so frank about looking at him, taking him in and telling him he was appreciating the view.
“I know you won’t take me up on it, but I could just deal with your publisher problem,” Harry said the next morning. Draco looked rumpled and well fucked and Harry loved waking up to him being there.
After lunch they walk around the muggle neighborhood and shops for a while. Halfway through their walk they stop in a coffee house and buy some hot chocolates to carry along with them on their walk.

"Well, Uncle Ron just got here to talk to Malfoy and I, so why don't you eat while we're talking and you can play after?" Harry says.
"What d-"
“No I haven’t checked the forest, its forbidden and dark and scary, why would he go in there?”
“He bricked up all the fireplaces,” Ivan replied. “He really does value his privacy.”
Draco kissed his nose gently. “Take off your shirt for me,” he commanded gently, and Harry did. “Good boy,” he added in a husky whisper and that did all kinds of things to Harry’s gut and his cock.
Mrs. Bellke stopped in the entry hall and closed her eyes. Draco looked at her, scepticism clear on his face. It amused Harry that in some way Draco was still kind of a snob.
“Yes,” Draco said, because of course. He licked his lips. “How about you take me upstairs now and fuck me into the mattress?”
Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose. He and Draco hadn’t had that particular talk yet. “I don’t want to hide him away.”
Like all those years before, everything just clicked into place.
“It’s probably an empty shell now,” Draco said. A grand empty shell, but a shell anyway. A skeleton, a monument to all the death and destruction that occurred there. That his family let happen in the name of what, honestly? It wasn’t honor; it hadn’t been anything noble at all.
“I don’t think so,” Antoine replied and downed the potion. He made a face and Harry smiled, throwing the invisibility cloak over them.
“What happened to the people who did this to you?” Pansy asked, waving at the covered-up painting.
“I hope we will never be done, Draco,” Harry said and meant it.
“And what now?”
“Strange, isn’t it?” Harry mused.
“By all means, let me welcome you to my home, Auror Potter,” Draco replied and got up from his chair.
~Three~
And Harry did, slowly at first but faster and harder with every encouraging moan and word that left Draco’s lips. When Harry sensed that Draco was close he curled his fingers around Draco’s hard, leaking cock and stroked it in tandem with his thrusts. It didn’t take long for Draco to spill all over Harry’s hand and himself. Harry wasn’t far behind.
“He will expose my identity if I don’t sign a three-book contract and let me tell you the conditions are less than favorable. He intends to pay me next to nothing,” Draco explained.
“Luna said you were just unlucky to be the son of a crazy, power hungry, pureblood fanatic,” Harry replied and Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
Blaise snorted. “Right, you know what I mean. Will it be published?”
“So you want me to call you Malfoy?” Potter asked, there was a small smile playing around his lips. And damn it, he had nice lips, Draco thought.
He grabbed the last Belladonna book and re-read the bits about attraction and then he went back and reread the sex-scenes. There was something about it, Harry had thought it was the writing, but maybe it was – well, maybe it was the fact that one of the characters reminded him of Draco. The way he talked maybe.
“So he knew about the spell,” Harry said.
“Something happened to your face,” Harry said, he could see a faint bruise around Draco’s jaw.
“You need to pay for what you did and once I am done with you, I will kill Potter,” Julien said. His voice was calm and pleasant, actually. This was a man who had his life figured out, he had a plan, he was executing it.
“I like your eyes, Potter.”
“Ah, I was wondering when you would ask that question,” Antoine replied. He pushed a lock of his dark hair back and looked at a spot a bit to the left of Harry's face. “Yes and no. It changes, because the body changes, the magic changes too. That is why we are...let's say discouraged,” that sharp smile again, “from changing wizards.”
“I can tell how much you love working with the Ministry of Magic, Draco,” Harry said with a wry smile.
Draco nodded, self-satisfied, it was nothing less than he had aimed for.
“The more I look at it the more I think there is something missing. I've never painted you before."
“You just let me mark you,” Harry said.
“I thought that was what you wanted too? Get Draco back, find out who else is there, destroy everything.”
“Really? Because you fancy the boy who lived,” Blaise said.
“Good,” Draco said and felt very satisfied and very accomplished.
“I can’t remember reading that in Voyages with Vampires,” Harry said.
“You wouldn’t,” Potter said mildly.
“Well, if they should throw fruit at him then we will just give him another pen name, and he will have to start anew as an up and coming author. We already know Draco is a talented writer. His books will sell like hotcakes.”
“But you succeeded anyway,” Potter said with a smile. It was a soft smile, like he was proud of Draco. It was mind boggling.
Julien was screaming soundlessly, and he would be for a long time, if Draco didn’t finish this spell, but he wasn’t going to. He wasn’t a good person, he just wasn’t a good person.
“So, I’m concentrating on the heart,” Ivan continued, ignoring Harry’s inner turmoil.
“So you teamed up with Potter, and…” he leaned his head against the back of the chair and stared at the ceiling.
“I don’t think he is a joke,” Harry answered, truthfully. He hadn’t really known Henri Deveruex that well before this whole thing happened, but even then he had acknowledged the fact that the Seer only wanted to work with him. Obviously Deveruex had done something right.
“Yes, as you know the only places not as heavily warded as the rest of the house are the hall and the small library,” Draco answered. “The fireplace in the library works of course, I could just Floo the Club and request someone I have already been with to come over. You can stand guard if you like.”
This time Draco kissed him until they were both breathless and Harry wanted, wanted him, wanted to feel Draco’s skin against his own, wanted to feel Draco inside him. And he was pretty sure that Draco wanted it too, that he was waiting for Harry to say the words.
“Well, no one knows where he lives or where he works,” Neville said. “But a friend saw him at the Ministry, it was about the manor. They finally decided to give it back to the Malfoys. I mean they stripped it of pretty much everything valuable, but they couldn’t take it away from the Malfoys. Some kind of blood magic preventing anyone else to take ownership of it. It can be sold or freely given away, but if I were Malfoy I wouldn’t do either,” Neville said.
Harry just looked at him.
Draco waved it away. “Don’t even try. I know you are flattered.“
Pansy blinked at her and Draco smiled.
“And I helped people stay out of Azkaban,” Harry said.
“See you soon, Draco.”
Harry waved it away. “I don’t care.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said. He knew that tone, she was concerned for him.
“Because it’s morning,” Harry replied.
“To intimidate him?” Draco asked.
“He’s trouble that one, you were right, Draco,” Antoine said and finally kissed Harry. Maybe it was that kiss or that hint of fangs on his dick, that made Harry lose it: he didn’t care. It was too good. Antoine had to steady him so he wouldn’t fall to the floor.
“Sucking your cock, the way you praised me,” Harry got out and Draco kissed him again.
“If everyone would do that we wouldn’t be here right now,” Harry countered. They have been here before, Draco thought, that first day in his study.
“I think that is a brilliant idea,” Draco whispered against his lips and kissed him again, it seemed to Harry like he couldn’t stop kissing him and Harry wasn’t going to complain any time soon about it. Finally Draco pulled away and started to strip above Harry. Harry was dazed and hard and impatient, he reached out again, to run his hands all over that freshly uncovered skin. It was perfect, except for that long scar he had put there, but he wasn’t going to say anything about it now.
“Right now my magic is powerful, but I am at a first year level when it comes to spells, potions, charms and hexes.”
“You have the worst timing, Potter,” Draco said, looking around the café pointedly.
“You should be an Auror, Draco.”
Potter held up the book.
Draco nodded, that was true of course.
Weasley was a hero and, yes everyone knew they had history, but what was Draco going to say? That Weasley cornered him and punched him in the face because – because what?
He blinked and was back in his studio again. He didn’t think they had intended this. Parts were fitting together more clearly now, pieces he'd had before but didn’t fit, slotting into place. Draco bit his lip until it bled, and then started to paint.
“Joel,” he said, because he didn’t think there was any need to pretend anymore.
Fuck, Draco thought, Blaise was right. “Fuck. I will have to come out as Belladonna, won’t I?”
“Who would have thought I was cursed twice?" Draco said, blinking up at the sky. His eyelashes were so pale it was mesmerising.

Sensing the oncoming tantrum, Draco quickly steps in and says, "He's right, I did promise. Anything I had planned isn't anything that can't be rescheduled for a later date."
On the outside he looks calm and patient, but on the inside Harry’s annoyed and a bit fearful of how much Teddy seems to love Malfoy. Whenever Malfoy is around, Teddy is pretty much glued to his side and hanging on to his every word. Malfoy doesn’t seem to be helping the situation either; whenever Teddy wants something all he has to do is go up to the prat and ask and he gets his way. He spoils the child and Harry doesn’t like it; Teddy could easily end up as Malfoy had, a spoiled git who can’t do anything on his own, much less stand up for himself. That’s why Harry's scared, not because he thinks Teddy loves Malfoy more; no, of course not. It also has nothing to do with the fact that in the few months since Malfoy was forced into his personal life, he's been constantly bombarded with proof that Malfoy may have changed since the war.
"Thank you, Harry. I'll send Draco over with him in a few moments,” Andromeda says, and then when Harry makes another displeased expression, “Wipe that look off your face. I have to change and I'm not sending Teddy through the floo by himself."
“Why don’t you eat all your carrots and you can have a chocolate frog,” Harry says, trying to reason with his godson.
Minister for Magic Harry Potter does not love his job. The one bright point in his life is his secret relationship with Quidditch Super Star Draco Malfoy. When they're 'outed' by a peeping tom with a camera, Harry has to decide what's really important.
Nothing’s wrong ‘Mione...the wedding is beautiful; I’m just sad I have no one to share it with,” Harry says, trying to play off the lonely feeling he’s had since the ceremony began.

Along with other things, such as the fact that Harry has a fantastic ass.
“How’d you get through?” Harry asks, confused although not as suspicious as he might have in recent times.
“You told them whenever you could, and it doesn’t look like you will be going back any time soon. Right now you need to go get ready for bed, bath and brush your teeth and I will be up shortly.”
“Come on, Teddy; it won’t take too long,” Harry says, amused by Teddy’s dramatics, which when he thinks about it is very Malfoy-like behavior. As the thought occurs to him, his gaze flicks to Malfoy and his smile falls slightly.
“Hey, Harry, I think I left some important papers in your office the last time we were in there, could you go and check for me?” Ron interjects, shuffling through some of the papers in front of him.
Still having no idea why Draco kissed his neck , Harry becomes acutely aware of his

For the second song the wedding party is supposed to join in the dancing, so Harry goes to dance with Ginny and Luna to dance with Draco. After a glare from Hermione, Ginny grabs Luna and dances away with her, leaving Harry to dance with Draco. Harry grasps one of Draco’s hands in his own and places his other on his waist, leading them in a dance, a foot of air between them. Not long after they begin dancing though, their bodies are pressed together, moving in sync. Harry just stares into Draco’s steady steel grey eyes, eyes that seem to hold a question. After a moment Harry watches as Draco’s eyes flicker down to his lips and back to his eyes, as though asking,

, and the git’s personality overwhelmed any stronger feelings that might have blossomed. Lately, seeing how different he’s been acting, especially around Teddy, has slowly started changing Harry’s views on the blond. Still, Harry has clung desperately to the belief that Draco hadn’t changed at all, that it was all just an elaborate act to mess with Harry’s mind. Hearing Draco degrade the racist beliefs he was brought up with makes it click in his head that he really has changed, and all at once all the repressed feelings he has for the blond come flooding back to him. All the times he wanted to shove Malfoy into some alcove and ravish him before he remembered it was

“But you don’t believe that, do you?” So young and so curious. Teddy wouldn’t know it, but this question was even more loaded than his other one. Malfoy’s answer could make or break their entire relationship. One answer could prove true everything he’s been trying to show,  whereas the other could destroy their relationship and show Teddy just how much of a git Draco really is.

Harry hopes an indulgent trip abroad will help shake him out of the doldrums of his life. What he finds once he gets to Venice is more than he ever expected.
“I don’t know, Teddy. It all depends on whether Malfoy is busy or not,” Harry says, secretly hoping Teddy doesn’t ask—too late, as Teddy just did.
Harry takes pause. He doesn’t really know when Malfoy became Draco in his mind; the only thing he can think is that it happened sometime last night.
"Fine, I'm going to make sure Teddy's room hasn't been messed up from recent renovations I've done this week," Harry grumbles, takes the gigi, and quickly climbs the steps to Teddy's room.
As soon as the connection is set up between 12 Grimmauld Place and Malfoy Manor, Draco mutters, “Goodbye,” and escapes through the fireplace.
“I shouldn’t let you go, who knows where you’ll end up?” Harry says, catching Draco as he trips over a bit of the rug.
“You sealed your house and the fireplace, so they don’t know where we went, and this place is pretty secure.”
“Because kissing you is amazing, you kissing me is amazing, it’s even better when we are touching too, your hands under my shirt and –“ he blushed.
Soon, Harry thought, he would ask Draco to fuck him soon.
“We are weary now to let someone in, especially someone like you, Mister Potter,” Antoine said.
“I understand,” Harry said.
“It’s decided then,” Pansy said. “We need to go over the options for the cover,” she said to Draco.
Joel smiled, and that smile, even if it wasn’t Joel’s face right now, was the same. “You gave me your heart once, Draco. You can give it to me again.”
“I don’t know,“ Draco answered honestly. Well, it was about Ivar, but besides that? Draco had no idea how to sum it up. Things just came to him and he wrote them down. Blaise had never asked him about his writing before and he wondered why Blaise was asking now. He had started the writing as a way to get things out of his head and to earn some money, as no one had been very keen on hiring him. Now it seemed like he couldn’t stop doing it. And he hadn’t told anyone except Blaise and Pansy that he was in fact H.J. Belladonna. Pansy had given him a knowing look, but hadn’t called him out on the name.

Luckily there’s a second bedroom on the third floor that Draco can use. Draco really doesn’t want to invade in Teddy’s space, and it would be awkward to explain to Harry that he really doesn’t mind having to share a bed, though he may get a bit handsy.
“Yeah, well I should get going-” Draco starts.
Teddy visibly deflates. “But I wanna play with Draco!”

"I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me,” Draco admits, again somewhat unwillingly. “Because I was mean to him in school and I didn't make the best choices."
“But I do believe Harry should be informed,” Draco finished, ignoring the interruption.
..when we were upstairs, I told Draco that I thought they’d be good friends and he said ‘me too’, then he told me that he liked Harry,” Teddy says, confused why Uncle Ron thinks that Draco would never say something like that.

“Harry doesn’t consider you a distraction, isn’t he coming home next weekend for your quidditch game? Why don’t you tell me what the real problem is and perhaps we can wait until after the match to tell him.”
Sensing the building tension and not wanting to be caught in the crossfire, Ron begins packing up his things and says, “Well, I should get back home to ‘Mione. This is taking longer than I expected, and we still have a few things to go over for the wedding. I guess we’ll just have to go over the new developments another time….sorry.”

“Why won’t you tell Harry that you like him so you can be happy together?” Teddy asks, looking at Draco, his cards splayed, face up, on the table.
"Then why don't you just watch him during the day and Harry gets him back after work?"
Well, fuck, that could have gone better, he thinks as he thumps his head back against the wall.
“You see me all year at school.”

Still feeling slightly awkward, Harry says, “Well, um, I was wondering if, maybe you wanted to, I don’t know, stick around a bit longer and have a butterbeer. With me.” Draco stares at him blankly for a few seconds before he rushes to add, “But if you want to go home, that’s okay too.”
“Well, I’m afraid Harry will run away...or be scared that I like him,” Draco says cautiously, silently hoping Harry doesn’t catch his meaning. Seeing Harry’s head snap to the side to stare at him squashes that hope, and he mentally prepares himself for the anger and accusations. When they don’t come, he looks at Harry in confusion.
(Art, Digital Comic, Mature)
“You said you like Harry when he’s happy, and Harry likes you because you make him happy, so why won’t you tell him you like him? He doesn’t believe me when I do.” Teddy is beginning to wonder if all adults are this weird.
"Why do you want to know?" Draco asked defensively.
He really liked that Draco wanted to spend time with and help care for Teddy, but sometimes the boy was a bit of a handful. Walking towards Hagrid’s hut Harry finally caught sight of Draco. “We’re finished, are you guys ready to head back? Where’s Teddy?”
Draco came to terms with the fact that he was attracted to Harry in their 5th year, though he pushed it aside because of the circumstances under which they were laboring at the time. After 6th year, Draco was under the impression that he might have been over his juvenile crush on the Chosen One. Indeed, it waited until after the war to once again rear its ugly head. When they began working together, all of his suppressed feelings started charging back into his life. It was easy to ignore at first, but these past few months of watching how Harry takes care of Teddy and seeing how much love he has for the little boy have been detrimental. What started out as a simple little crush grew into something that constantly has Draco fighting with himself to not slam Harry against a wall and—
“I want Draco to read me a story.”
Summary:
It’s quiet, aside from the occasional question from Teddy or Draco and the sound of the food cooking when Teddy asks the question.
"But I wanna play with Draco," Teddy whined, digging his heels in the ground.

Such a naive mind, Harry thinks. He doesn’t understand how anyone could believe something to be so bad.
(2245, PG13)
“Oh! That.” Harry feels the tips of his ears beginning to heat up. “Well, I decided I might as well get used to acknowledging you by your first name since I see you so often. It would just be childish for me to keep acting like you’re going to hex me at every corner.” He can only hope this explanation will suffice. To be honest, he has no fucking clue why he’s calling him Draco. It’s just that it feels weird to say ‘Malfoy’, like it’s something vile.
"Yeah?"
“You could start by asking him to dance after dinner. You could pull him to the side and say, ‘Hey Draco, I like you and I know you like me so let’s see where it goes.’” Hermione says, a poor imitation of Harry’s voice that causes him to bust out laughing.

Summary:
“Well...okay,” Draco says, unable to say no the child as usual. It isn’t even that he has an irresistible puppy dog face, even though it is a contributing factor. The only reason Draco never says no to Teddy is out of fear of Teddy hating him forever for denying him something. Harry, on the other hand, has nothing to worry about. Teddy absolutely adores him, even if he says ‘no’. Draco wishes Teddy would hold that much regard for him. Maybe then he could be the kind of role-model that the parentless child needs and a proper father-type figure the way Harry is. Harry really is an amazing father figure to Teddy; it's one of the many things Draco likes about him.
Harry is surprised by Malfoy’s complete honesty with Teddy. He would’ve thought Malfoy kept everything about his past a secret because, for once, someone didn’t know and hate him because of it. Sometimes, Harry doesn’t like being wrong; now it just shows him that Teddy really loves Malfoy, horrible past and all, and it quite frankly scared the hell out of him. The fact that Malfoy can get so serious and have these types of meaningful conversations with Teddy without one of them running away means Teddy must really love him, probably more than Harry. Not willing to miss any of the conversation, Harry naps himself out of his inner turmoil and presses himself as close to the door as he can without actually touching it.

One year after the war and after Hogwarts restorations, Harry is back at school to finally finish his education. He wasn't expecting McGonagall to assign him to protect Draco Malfoy, in case he was bullied during the classes. Although really just wants to relax on his last year in Hogwarts, he'd seen how Draco had changed at the trials. He knew being around him would be easy enough... Wouldn't it?

“Well, my father wasn’t a very good man...he believed someone was only as good as their blood line, meaning the more wizards in the family the better, and he did his best to make me believe the same thing. That’s why I wasn’t allowed to read the story, and many others as well, because at the end Sir Luckless, a muggle, and Amata, a witch, get married.”
"That's not fair!” cries Teddy, flailing exaggeratedly like the five-year-old he is. “You should be the same around everybody so nobody can say you like someone more!"
"Well, what does it look like?"

“And none of them ever knew or suspected that the Fountain’s waters carried no enchantment at all,” Harry hears Malfoy say, followed by the soft thump of the book closing.
Her eyes landed on the bruise Harry left on his collarbone and then took in the scar Harry had left what seemed like a lifetime ago on his torso. Draco nodded at her and then proceeded to make his way to the teakettle.
“Draco,” Harry said. “Antoine.”
“Call for the cavalry then,” Draco hissed. He could feel the strain in his bones, in his blood, it felt like his veins were being pulled out of his body. “Oh, fuck.”
“I just meant that you would be an excellent choice because it would be so –“
“Now what? We can’t let them continue,” Draco said, once they were outside and away from the building.
“Yes,” Antoine said.
He didn’t see the punch coming. Weasley’s fist connected with his jaw and his head banged against the wall behind him.
“I know and I like that about you, you protect your own.”
“They might, but then you can be sure it’s not because of your writing, but because they’re all biased shits and you can call them out on it. We should ask Lovegood to print an interview with you in her magazine. In fact that should be the only interview you give. Good for both sites.”
After a short nod from Thompson, the Aurors went up. Draco itched to follow them, but didn’t. Half an hour later they came back down. Bears looked sick, and Potter wasn’t looking at Draco. Thompson got up, nodded at Draco, and then they left.
“Yes, you did, with your merry band of misfits,” Draco agreed, “But you also spoke on the behalf of some people.”
“So, I will tell our superior that Malfoy and I are staying here,” Harry replied.
Draco privately thought that that was not true at all. Draco kind of liked it, if he was honest with himself. But he would let Potter assume, because Potter had always liked to assume things about Draco.
“Harry,” Harry said with a smile. Somehow it just didn’t have the same ring to it when someone else called him by his last name. Draco had this special way of saying it.
He and Draco had talked about that possibility of course. They had talked about a lot of things since Draco had told him about being Belladonna. They were making plans, real plans for their future together. Draco had said that he didn’t mind writing under a penname. It would have been nice if people started to associate the Malfoy name with something positive, but Draco wasn’t holding his breath for that happening anytime soon.
“I messed up,” Harry said, ignoring Draco’s comment; he was in pain and probably not thinking straight.
“You thought I wanted a bit of danger in my bedroom?” Harry replied, laughing.
The answer to that was ‘no’ as well. “Astra would have said something.”
Draco smiled, it was a razor thin thing and it made a shiver run down Harry’s spine. It wasn’t totally unpleasant. “If thinking that makes you feel better.”
Draco nodded. “Fine, sleep now, more revenge plans tomorrow. Night Potter.”
“Is it because you drew the short straw? Or because you knew no one else would volunteer? Was it you or no one?”
He laughed. “Pansy, I do love you.”
“Fuck,” Harry said.
“You smell really good,” Draco purred.
“With lunch?” Harry asked.
“Yes, you did, and I am happy for you, I really am. I just want you to be prepared that some people might consider you a traitor.”
Draco gave him a look. He knew that Harry was only trying to put him at ease, but he was too nervous to play along. It wasn’t only the fact that he was Belladonna, he was pretty sure Harry could handle that little white lie, it was also the fucking blackmail.
“So you were afraid.”
“You're back,” Harry said, not coming any closer.
“We age, but very slowly.”
“Always.”
Draco could tell that he meant it. “Water under the troll bridge, Potter.” He was about to say something else but then his stomach made a noise and Potter laughed. “I haven’t eaten all day.”
This time it was Draco who smiled briefly. That wasn’t going so badly. “By keeping it a secret, I made sure that I had an income. I doubt anyone would have bought my book if I had put my real name on it. Or would have written a favorable critique.”
Harry shrugged. “You said it yourself something doesn’t add up and if Julien is really behind it, he must have partners. He doesn’t have high enough clearance to do it all by himself.”
“Excuse me?” Harry asked. The boy was pretty. But then most people here were. Pale and delicate and with a wild edge. He reminded Harry of – Draco. Not in his appearance, but in the way he held himself. Something about the barely tamed wildness in his eyes.
Draco looked at the parchment again.
“Should we really joke about this?”
This was a nightmare. “The others?” Harry asked.
“Yes, but will people buy them once they know a former Death Eater had written them? I don’t think so Pansy.” The income from the books was his only income and there were talks about translations into other languages, which was good, but he wasn’t swimming in money. He couldn’t risk having his identity exposed, not for another few years at least.
“Are you here because you’re still trying to buy me dinner?” Draco asked, crossing his arms over his chest. He was wearing robes, he was pretty much always wearing robes and Harry had no idea how his body looked underneath. Robes concealed an awful lot. Why hadn’t he realized that before?
Draco smiled. He wasn't even angry about it. In fact, he was pleased about that admission. “Well, thank you for offering to keep me alive then Auror Potter.”
“Yes, I can see that,” Draco replied and leaned closer.
“I really want you to kiss me now, Draco,” Harry said and licked his lips.
“Because you don’t want that little boy to die,” Harry replied.
Draco slid down to the floor and held his head between his hands. It fucking hurt. He had known that no one would be thrilled about this situation, but he hadn’t thought that someone would hurt him.
“Blaise is,” Neville said. “But it’s not Blaise you like, right, Harry?”
Draco nodded. “Thank you, Potter.”
He loved that man. He really did.
“And I won’t,” Draco said sharply.
Draco rubbed his leg and glared at her.
“I guess I will still work for the Ministry of Magic, but now that I can leave the house and am dating a celebrity I might as well make my talents known.”
Potter sighed but stayed where he was. “I knew you would take matters into your own hands, once you found out about it.”
“I’ve done this before,” Harry reminded him.
“Of course it is,” Mrs. Bellke huffed.
“Why paint this?” Potter asked after another lengthy silence in which they were breathing each other’s air. Draco’s fingers itched to run over Potter’s face, his neck, his chest and...lower.
“You are really going to do this?” Potter asked.
The suit was and it would look very flattering on Blaise too. As Blaise dragged him into the tiny store, Draco’s eyes caught a glimpse of vivid green. It was a tie and even although it was probably not wise to spend all that money on one tie, he knew he was going to buy it.
Harry grinned. “You and I both know I don’t need the money.” He got up and kneeled in front of Draco. Draco really liked Harry on his knees. Harry took Draco’s hands in his own and looked up at Draco. “We will be fine,” Harry said, and Draco believed him.

to Teddy. He asked him about what he liked--which sent Teddy into a long list with things like Licorice Wands and playing wizard chess with ‘Uncle Ron’--and what he enjoyed doing and even answering a few of Teddy’s questions in return.

One piece of rope offers what Harry and Draco seek the most from each other.
On further inspection, the plate full of food doesn’t appear to have anything unusual, aside from a warming charm. Guessing that they went back to Teddy’s room after their apparent dinner, Harry silently makes his way up the stairs and towards Teddy’s bedroom door. The door is cracked open and a sliver of light falls into the hall. As he approaches the door, he begins to hear Malfoy softly telling the tale of

It is a decent sized room, more than big enough for a five-year-old. The bed is pressed against the far left wall for maximum playing room, with a toy box at the foot. Next to Teddy's bed sits a short bookshelf that doubles as a night stand. The bookshelf is full of coloring books and supplies as well as some of Teddy's favorite bedtime stories, such as
“What chocolate?” Teddy asks, eyes wide and trying to look innocent. He squirms in his seat under Harry’s meticulous gaze and his eyes unconsciously flick to Draco despite his attempts at nonchalance.
Summary:
Perhaps Harry should have thought Draco more capable of such things. They’ve all grown up since Hogwarts. Hell, most of them had done more than their fair share of growing up during the last year of the war alone. Somehow, though, he’s still shocked. And with the shock comes the resurfacing of feelings he’s tried to keep submerged for years.
A tall, slender woman, face creased with age, appeared next to Draco. Although clearly an older woman, she possessed a sophisticated beauty clearly visible to anyone who dared look at her. Narcissa whose hair, even after all these years, was still bright blonde underneath her families signature coal black locks, had obviously been searching for her son for quite a while.
Harry and Draco probably had a tumultuous time getting together, filled with angst and denial and pining and brooding. However, this is not that story. Here, Draco makes Harry come (more than once).

Upon hearing that his friend is staying, Teddy immediately stops and tackles Draco's leg in delight. Stumbling slightly at the unexpected embrace, Draco quickly regains his balance and ruffles Teddy's hair fondly.
Draco catches the glance and notices the minute drop in the intensity of Harry’s smile. He asks, “So what is Weasley here for?” while averting his gaze to the wall and trying to pretend he didn’t see it, let alone feel any sadness over it.
“Calling him Draco, you usually call him Malfoy,” Teddy says, confused; as far as he knew, Harry still hated Draco.
Harry Potter is the Ministry's star auror trainee, and Draco Malfoy is the cute florist in Diagon Alley who Harry stares at through the window during lunch breaks and leaves. That's all they are and all they would ever be. (Really.) Until Harry accidentally mails Draco an autumn themed dildo (among others). Cue: bad planning, owl kidnapping, and flangst.
“Not sure buddy. Either way, up. It’s time for breakfast.” Harry pats his knee and stands back up, waiting for Teddy to work his way out of his blanket cocoon.
"Sorry Harry, I didn't mean to scare you," Teddy apologizes, getting up from his spot on the floor next to Draco and hugging Harry.
” and promptly the carrots disappear. The second Draco’s wand is out of sight; Harry walks back in the room.
. It can’t backfire; he’s aching for you to make the first move, I can see it.”
Harry knew that it wouldn’t do any good to get mad, and while he wanted to yell and hex Draco for being careless he knew it was more important to find the boy. At six years old Teddy could get into more trouble than Harry ever dreamed about, and he liked to explore new places. They had been to Hogwarts many times and Harry couldn’t think of anyplace Teddy hadn’t explored yet, until he looked around and a path into the forest caught his eye.
"I believe I can stay for a little while longer.” The corner of Draco’s mouth lifting into a slight smile.
“Because he told me; I asked him and he said he liked you when you were happy and then he got sad and said you weren’t happy around him, but since you’re happy around him now, you can be happy together,” Teddy says, clearly unaware of the impact his words are having on Harry.
"He really is, but he's much calmer after he's spent at least a day with Harry. The boy tries to make up for an entire week within a day’s time."
On the twelfth day of their romantic relationship, Draco and Harry take Albus, Scorpius and Rose on a weekend trip to Muggle London that Ron and Hermione were supposed to lead. At the fully-booked hotel where they'll be staying for the night, they're surprised to discover that their rather plain room has

Draco looks at his feet, “Thanks, though the sleeves and legs are an inch too long, and its hanging a bit off my frame.”

After the war Draco thought he would never feel again. But a mix of revenge gone wrong and Harry Potter, might help him to feel just a little less broken.
Ever since he went to Hogwarts, Draco realized that he wasn't quite the same as the others.
“But I don’t want carrots, can I have sweets instead?” Teddy tries bargain, thinking some sweets would be just as good as dumb carrots.

“But you’re my teacher, it’s not the same.”

To distract Teddy from the oncoming argument, Draco pulled him off to the side, safely away from the sounds of bickering siblings, and crouched down next to him on the grass. What he then proceeded to do surprised Harry so much, he felt as if his eyes were ready to pop out of his head. He actually started
Harry thinks about it and finally succumbs, grudgingly grumbling, “Okay, but you better know I’ll hold you to that promise. Now go upstairs and get dressed.”
“I don’t have to be your teacher all the time. You can come see me as your cousin whenever you need to; my door is always open to you. And I know that Harry has missed you while he’s been working on the Tournament. He wrote me just last week that you don’t seem to be replying to any of his owls.”

Summary:
They come to a stop in front of the fireplace and, with bated breath, Harry says, “I never said you couldn’t stay the night here.”
“That’s why I told you to hurry and eat,” Harry says, not as annoyed as he is making it seem, hoping his ‘annoyance’ at Teddy will get him to eat. “I warned you.”
After leaving post-war Britain for Paris, Draco is finally happy, with friends and a job he loves, But then his newest client turns out to be Harry Potter, and everything changes.
"No, Teddy. I'm sure he has more important things to do than spend his time with people he doesn't think are worthy of his presence," Harry coaxed, attempting to get Teddy to let go of Draco's hand and follow.
Harry left Headmistress McGonagall’s office and headed out to the grounds. They had had a good meeting in preparation of bringing the Triwizard Tournament back to Hogwarts this year. As he left the castle and looked out over the grounds he didn’t see Draco and Teddy anywhere, they had planned to visit Hagrid and then wait for him on the grounds.
“I should get going,” Draco says, shifting on his feet ever so slightly.
Okay, Ron thinks, so that could mean many things, not necessarily romantic things, though he has to admit they would make a nice couple now that he thinks about it. Even though their personalities tend to clash at times, they really compliment each other. Draco is the smart, cunning, and proper one; whereas Harry is the brave, loyal, and family-centered one….
Draco is going to lose his virginity, so help him god, and he's going to lose it to one Harry Potter. Why? Because of his big cock, his status as The Top Five Quidditch Players in England, and Witch Weekly's Most-Eligible Bachelor for eight years straight. At least that's what he tells himself. Too bad first times rarely go as one plans, and now Harry is looking miserable and Draco doesn’t understand why.
Draco is one of the last sirens of the seas, who escaped to the human world looking for friendship and food, but captivity found him instead. For seven years, he's gotten used to his life as human entertainment, and prides himself in his ability to make humans fall in step to his song.
"Teddy, your lunch is ready!" Harry calls up the stairs, cutting Teddy off.

"Teddy stays with me throughout the week because of Harry's work schedule."
"But you're different now, right?"
Teddy slouched down in his chair realizing that he had been caught doing more than sneaking back into the castle after curfew. “I don’t go that often, mostly just when we’re feeling restless. It always seems to get worse towards the full moon, but when I’m with them it all feels better.”

“Somehow they feel like family, when I’m with them I feel like I belong. Harry’s been so busy all summer helping make plans for the Tournament and then he traveled with everyone to be there it feels like he’s never around. And since you moved to school we hardly see you anymore except for short visits.”
Summary:
“Shouldn’t say things like that, people will think you like me,” Draco says, leaning into Harry a few seconds longer before pressing a fleeting kiss into his neck and straightening from his hold. “Besides, mother has probably been wondering why I’ve been gone so long.”

“It’s nearly ten, so unless you were planning a late lunch, I’d suggest you just put away the rest of his food with a preserving charm on it and that’ll be his lunch when we get back from Diagon Alley,” Draco tries, hoping he can get the two to compromise. Besides, if he gets his way (Which is likely, considering the fact that he’s a Malfoy and Malfoys get what they want) they won’t even be having lunch in the townhome.
Finding himself the unexpected focus of unwanted attention and harassment, he is suddenly dependent on the good will and protection of the last people he would have expected — Harry Potter and his gang of do-gooder Gryffindors (plus Luna Lovegood). With his world turned upside down, how will Draco make it through the rest of the year? And worse still, as he grows closer and closer to Harry, how will he get out with his heart intact?
“So can I go back and visit them? I said I would and you always say we should keep our promises.”
once again. The kiss sent fiery sparks across his skin and had him aching for more

Harry just scoffed and rolled his eyes. It really grated his nerves that a handful of his friends, and those he considered to be his family, were convinced that Malfoy was a saint now. Harry knew better. It was all a ruse, it had to be a ruse. No one could change so drastically, could they? It doesn’t matter, the blond git is just the same as he was in school, no matter what his actions now might say.

Summary:
Harry softly shakes his shoulder and murmurs, “Teddy, buddy, wake up. We’re almost to the kitchen and I kind of need my arms to cook.”

"It's a black stick with white ends and about this big," Teddy says, holding his hands about a foot apart.
Sometimes it only takes a week to change everything. The story of how twenty-five-year-old Draco Malfoy hit one Harry Potter with a door and knocked both of their lives into somewhere entirely new.
Summary:
’ one last night, from what I remember. You were affected far more by the alcohol than I was,” Harry says, poking Draco square in the chest.
“See you later Harry.”
Potter hissed, but he clenched once more around Draco’s spent, half hard cock.
“It’s how I show my affection I guess?” Potter replied. “I never got enough food as a child. My cousin did and so my brain probably associates food somehow with carrying and love.”
“How are you even still alive?“ Blaise asked, sighing.
“What is it to you?”
“What?”
“So what are you going to teach me today?”
He sighed. “Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t.”
Harry moaned, he liked when Draco scrapped his teeth against the skin there and then kissed it and Draco knew by now that it got Harry hot like nobody’s business.
He had confessed to Draco being the first man he ever kissed, but really, Draco had known that. If there had been any rumors at all about Harry Potter getting it on with a man, Blaise would have heard about it and so Draco would have heard about it too. Draco would be Harry’s first. His first kiss with a man, the first man to blow him, the first man to fuck him, the first man Harry would fuck, because Draco wanted to feel Harry deep inside him as much as he wanted to be inside Harry.
“Draco is in the room and he is feeling very good right now,” Draco said and scooted closer to Harry, so his dick was rubbing against Harry’s stomach. Harry wished he was naked.
~Five~
Draco blinked at it. Did Harry just gift him an owl? Draco didn’t have one of his own yet, because they were bloody expensive, but of course Harry could afford to just give one away. He was still a rich little bastard and he was also an owl trainer these days.
“You’re staring, Potter,” Draco said.
“But it didn’t start right away. He said it only started when he came back to the Manor.”
The boy laughed. It sounded strangely melodic. “Antoine, at your service,” he said and sketched a bow.
“I was at that inn, in disguise and when they took him away, I looked around the room, just – curiosity, I guess.”
“His file says he took the Dark Mark,” Ivan continued.
“You could just leave and—"
If you looked at it like this, then Dumbledore had been playing a very long and dangerous game. And he had been willing to basically sacrifice anyone for the win.
“No touching, Draco. You are permitted to watch only,” Harry said.
The gate was open and he pushed gently to see if he would be let in. Once he was sure nothing nasty was going to attack him, and why would it really, he stepped on the grounds.
“Seems so,” Draco replied, twirling his wand between his long, graceful fingers.
“Is he okay?“ a voice asked and he blinked his eyes open. The face seemed huge; the eyes even bigger. He blinked again. “Are you okay, Harry?“
Draco stood up fluidly and Antoine kissed him hard. “You taste delicious.”
He groaned. There was only one way to find out if it was the sensual writing of Belladonna that made Harry think about kissing Draco breathless or if it was – well, Draco.
“Yes, but we knew it was going to happen,” Draco replied.
“Thank you for seeing me,” Harry said, trying not to wince. He hated it when he was being called a hero.
“Well my life has always been anything but ordinary,” Harry said.
Harry nodded. “I can’t work for them anymore. I actually don’t need to either. I’m not exactly hard pressed or money.”
“Why am I not surprised it is you, Potter,” Draco said when Auror Harry James Potter entered his study.
“You realize that you being with a man in public, dating a man in public will be a big deal, right?” Neville asked.
“You’re staring, Harry,” Draco said. He was breathless, but so was Harry. Making out with Draco had left him hard and wanting and it was a good thing he had the foresight to get a room for them to be alone. Draco had joked about it, but Harry knew that he was thinking the same thing Harry was thinking. He wanted to do it.
“At this point it doesn’t really matter to him if he gets away or not,” Weasley added.
“Or do you have to be somewhere this morning?” Draco asked.
“I suppose that is a compliment?” Harry asked.
“What?” Draco asked.
“One of the others is that we’re scumbags who use your natural gifts without asking,” Harry said.
“Surprisingly, this really turns me on,” Harry admitted.
Blaise nodded. It was clear that he had hoped Draco would tell Harry, but he wouldn’t have pushed it if Draco had decided against it. Blaise would have kept it a secret from the headmistress as well, if Draco had told him to.
Draco nodded. He had been sick of feeling miserable. It had been time to reinvent himself. So he invented H.J. Belladonna, but he was well aware that should anyone discover his secret his writing career would go up in flames. People still said the Malfoy name with disdain like it was an unpleasant taste in their mouths.
“You know, there are other ways to have fun in the meantime,” Draco said.
Blaise looked at him sharply. Draco stared straight ahead. “When?”
“He's seen the real deal too, but not all of them in one place,” Harry said. It seemed to be explanation enough.
“I don’t think you need pretty words from me, Draco. I think you want reckless honesty. I think you like my reckless honesty,” Harry answered, and Draco was in his personal space in a matter of seconds, his mouth was crushed against Harry’s, Draco’s tongue was invading Harry’s mouth. The kiss made Harry’s stomach flip in a good way. He was ready, he was so fucking ready. “I want you to fuck me, Draco,” he gasped between kisses and Draco shoved him so Harry was sprawled on the bed.
“People should mind their own business, just because I’m in the public eye doesn’t mean everything I do is for public consumption. Besides I think I have given the Wizarding world enough,” Harry finished. He had lost his parents to the cause, and Sirius, Remus too. Cedric died because Voldemort had been after Harry. He had nearly died himself. He had given these people enough. These people who put all their hopes on the shoulders of a child.
“Yes, but they didn’t start that war, we did.“
“I always noticed you,” Draco replied.
“Not with you, I can’t,” Blaise said.
“Draco,” Harry said, it was a plea and Draco licked his lips to wet them before he sucked the tip of Harry’s cock into his mouth. Harry’s fingers found their way into Draco’s hair. He didn’t pull, for which Draco was grateful. He curled his fingers around the base of that pretty cock and started to lick, suck and jerk to find out what made Harry moan the loudest, what made his fingers tighten in Draco’s hair, what made Harry want to push him down on his cock and make Draco take him deeper.
“How is it to live here?” Astra asked. “I mean this place is huge and has a lot of windows.”
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco said as they sat down. They went through the motions of ordering and Harry just observed Draco. Even now after ten years and the horrific things he had seen and done as a teenager, there was something regal about Draco.
“McGonagall told me to do it, Blaise thought it was a good idea –“
“I love your mouth,” Harry said between more kisses.
“Fine? Fine what?” Harry dared to tease.
Potter took of his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “You want me to help you.”
“Would she?” Draco countered.
“You want to hide me away?” Draco hissed.
He was naked in the painting, younger; he looked nearly innocent, the pale of his skin set apart from the red of the bloody symbols. There were shadowy knives around him, and lush green foliage.
“Why are you staring?” Draco asked and crossed his arms over his chest. He was still wearing all his clothes and that was hot too, the way he just stood there and looked at Harry and asked questions like Harry wasn’t dying to have Draco’s cock inside him for the first (but not last he hoped) time.
“You tell me. You look like you’ve been going at it all night,” Draco replied.
