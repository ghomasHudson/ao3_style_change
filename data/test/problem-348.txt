“Just shut up and kiss me, you utter twat,” Draco growls, his fingers curling in Harry’s hair to pull him into a heated kiss, eagerly licking into his curry-flavoured mouth. “I don’t want your mouth anywhere near my dick right now, just to let you know,” Draco says against his lips.
Harry can feel when the tension leaves Draco’s body, the feeling mutual. They both shake Healer Walker’s hand and schedule another follow-up in a month’s time, determined to closely track Thea’s emotional progress and eventually her physical progress, as well. When they make it back out to the Mind Healer’s reception, Nurse Janelle is chatting up Thea.
Mapping out each estate to pillage the last three weeks hasn’t been easy but it’s been worth it. He’s found the perfect way to do all this without ever leaving even a whiff of his magical signature. They’ve adopted Muggle techniques to break in with
Narcissa Malfoy arrives back to Malfoy Manor on a blistering cold Saturday morning in mid-October. Draco had had very little warning of her arrival, apparently. So little that he was still passed out from working a double shift when his mother’s house elf, Étienne, who was decked out in the prettiest green chiffon dress, popped into existence in his bedroom. It caused him quite the panic, and not even a spliff had helped him calm down afterwards.
“We both were in that moment. I meant it. I always meant it, Harry. I wanted you, and I wanted everything we promised we’d give one another, but it was so difficult,” Draco shakes, shaking his head. “How could we build a life together if we were both struggling? I couldn’t live with myself, allowing you to shoulder my burdens.”
Draco’s touched by his kindness. He’s suddenly struck with an insane idea—somehow, as soon as possible, he’s going to return Harry’s Cloak of Invisibility himself before the proverbial shit hits the proverbial fan. It will be his way of repentance.
“It’s Dean, he’s right over there, coming right at me,” Harry whispers when he finally finds his voice.
Draco, having not heard the exchange or Harry’s subsequent outburst, reaches out to hug the blonde girl Pansy dragged along with her. “And Happy Birthday to you, Daffy,” Draco kisses her soundly on the cheek before reaching back and gripping Harry’s elbow to tug him forward. Harry feels like a deer caught in the headlights. Only the headlights are the gazes of too many Slytherins at once. “You remember Potter, don’t you?” Draco asks, affecting boredom.
“Fine, I’ll leave you to it, Malfoy. I-I guess I just wanted to make sure you’re alright,” he says, hesitant to leave, but not wanting to drag this awkward reunion out any longer. Malfoy rolls his eyes, staring straight up at the ceiling.
“You tried to take my soulmate away from me. And for that, I’m going to fucking dismantle you, you whiny, pathetic arsehole.”
When Draco approaches the door, he realises with a hint of mortification that the bottom of the doggy door has streaks of mud on it. Without quite thinking, he places a hand on the doorknob and to his utter fucking surprise and shock, it turns. And opens. Adrenaline rushes through him once more.
The house-elf nods, her eyes anxious as she gazes up and down his body. “It being in your back pockets, Sir. Is Zilly being Summoning it for you?”
“Unspeakable Malfoy, I’m glad I ran into you, we need an Unspeakable on site,” Auror Castor starts. “And if I’m not mistaken, you’re the same lad that fixed up Jenkins, weren’t you?”
Expression still blank, Harry turns to Draco. “The Veil is my Horcrux. I’m linked to it and trapped in its magical manifestation. Destroying the Veil should release my soul to the other side, and release my body...so you can…” Harry trails off. Draco swallows with a nod.
, could you…could you just hold me a little longer?” Draco asks, his eyes pleading. Harry nods, settling back beside him on the bed.
” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “Plus, Harry’s sense of smell is bar none. Where is the party?” Draco asks, looking around the bar. It’s full for a Friday night, but he doesn’t see any of their friends.
“Oh, bugger off,” she smiles and Harry realises with a start just how much he's reminded of Ron in that teasing smile. “I know it’s a childish proposition.” She tilts her chin upward. “But imagine how
. We don’t know what that was or if it’ll happen again. Let’s not bank on anything working the exact same way a second time. Let’s especially not feed into suicidal ideations.”
“You sound mad. Do you truly believe you can’t put a little trust in him? You two have been dating for two years –”
There is a mix of white, ivory, and pale pink peonies nearly bursting from their vases set on each table and in the hands of each débutante Draco’s come across. Everything glitters—from the Waterford Crystal centrepieces to the dappled Swarovski crystal chandeliers charmed to sparkle, and the ice and ivory chiavari chairs. The muted prism of colours that reflect off their surfaces are complex and gorgeous, illuminating everything from the delicate lace-patterned table linens to the tall floor-to-ceiling Georgian arched windows.
Draco pulls back completely now, his arms coming away from Harry’s body. He runs a shaky hand through his hair as he stares at Harry’s now shy expression. Merlin. Something sappy and warm is growing in Draco’s chest. He feels like a complete fucking monster for it.
She cancels the Lightening Charm and casts a Diagnostic Charm. A gold circular orb growing to the size of a Quaffle hangs above his chest. There are runes, an ECG reading, blood pressure reading, organ function results, and small graphs flowing within the orb.
come to your house that night to fuck you. You were so sad, and you looked up at me with tears in your eyes, asking me to hold you and I just, I just didn’t know...” Harry trails off, struggling to put his thoughts into proper words. He just didn’t know the depth of Draco’s feelings for him, and had he known, he wouldn’t have panicked the way he had afterwards.
“I feel like I’m going to be sick,” Potter mutters. “You’re saying, in a roundabout way, that my death is okay because—science prevailed?”
“I don’t know what to say,” Draco says quietly, staring anxiously at the Veil. “I can’t wrap my head around this anymore.”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Theo says, his eyes wide and child-like as he takes another step towards Draco’s trembling form.
“Don’t be daft!” Pansy suddenly shouts, startling Draco from out of his trance. “You don’t know what it is. Do you want to be cursed to hell and back?”
Imagine the rumours and speculation that had spread like fiendfyre throughout the community! Intrigued, Draco had donned his Armani suit and tucked away his wand in a hidden sleeve holster.
Tracey grasps Draco’s elbow, leading him towards the empty, poorly lit space beneath the staircase. She shoves him under it and tucks herself in against him. “Listen to me very carefully,” she starts in a hushed whisper. “I need you to give that scroll to Harry Potter.”
“This one right here,” Draco says, pointing to it. This close, he can feel a sinister, ominous tendril of magic take root in the back of his head. It’s a tiny voice filling his skull, quietly begging him to open it. “I—I think I want to open it,” Draco whispers, inching closer to the object.
-good!” he says. As Malfoy chews, he stares down at the cheesy chips almost lovingly and Harry snorts. “You alright?” Malfoy asks him offhandedly, his eyes traveling up to Harry’s. “Best wraps and chips in London, Potter.”
Draco had also forgiven Theo for telling Bitty their secret, and now they both attend Muggle NA meetings together twice a month. Draco’s learning to be honest about his brush with addiction; Theo’s learning how to overcome his. And for good reason-- he plans on proposing to Millie as soon as he’s back on his feet.
“Breakups are hard. They’re private and not always symptomatic of what two people shared. I’m sorry you weren’t afforded privacy in yours, that was unfair. I swear I didn’t think you’d want to surround yourself with the very people causing you discomfort, so I didn’t ask. I didn’t want to bring up negative shit.”
Draco’s body tenses. He refuses to face Potter. “I’m not really interested in talking about whatever it is you’re itching to talk about, Potter.” He drains the rest of his whisky and cranes his neck to glance over at the makeshift bar — a table teeming with all sorts of drinks warded against anyone underaged. He had been surprised at first they were serving alcohol at a baby’s party, but Hermione said Ron had insisted for the sake of his brothers.
He wants to push it down. Push this pain all the way down to the bowels of hell that rest deep inside him. Down where the cupboard under the stairs, the nightmares from the war, the lives he’s taken in the name of duty, precariously rest. He tries to push his son down there, and the loss of Draco down there, but the space feels too full. Too overwhelmed.
Hermione Granger is heaving great, agonising sobs as her arms cradle her protruding pregnant belly. Some of her coarse curly hair has escaped its bun and is now sticking to her sweaty, tear-stained face. A box containing what looks like the contents of her desk spill out beside her, having probably dropped it during her onslaught of grief. When she looks up at Draco, her cries grow even more frantic as she stretches out a trembling hand towards him.
the scars had healed relatively quick – and that was a cursed injury. He grimaces as his eyes roam over the grotesque fading bruises decorating his thin chest, jutting collarbones, and taut stomach. His skin has an ugly grey tinge to it and his usually luscious, shoulder-length white blond hair is limp and dingy. A faint yellow and green bruise still adorns the left side of his face. He looks worse than he did during his stint in Azkaban awaiting trial. He knows the bruising will disappear by tomorrow, but
He could see how much their terror affected Harry. Harry, the defender of the innocent, Potter. Draco always hated this about his old schoolmate, how concerned he was with everyone's well being. Sometimes, so those you care most about may survive, you had to sacrifice others. That was how it worked in this world, and after all these years, after he'd lost so many of his friends, he still didn't learn the lesson. He supposed it wasn't entirely Harry's fault. After all, he grew up on Dumbledore's watch. That old, naive, too kind for his own good and good for nothing wizard. Draco pitied Harry. Compassion was the last thing Lucius and Narcissa taught their son. And that allowed them to live a little longer than James and Lily Potter had, at least.
Malfoy was the first to move. He climbed onto his bed in silence, and layed onto the mattress, sighed and turned his back on Harry and the petrified body.
He switched position a couple of times, not knowing how to make himself comfortable because of his arm. He was exhausted, but sleep would not come. He heard Malfoy coughed.
Harry woke up with a start, the inside of his mouth dry and his arm hurting so much he had to bite his lip so he did not scream out loud. He would have cried if the tiredness hadn't taken all the energy left in him already. Instead, he fell back onto the mattress loudly, his weight making it creak. It was only when he heard Malfoy moan in his sleep that he remembered he was in the room with him. He stared into the darkness at what seemed to be Malfoy's sleepy form on his own bed and hoped the noises he made earlier would not wake up the other boy. The moan became a heavy sigh and Harry could hear Malfoy move. Harry was certain he was awake. He tried to stay still and not make any more noise. After a couple of minutes, Harry thought he was safe to breathe normally and move again. Malfoy had gone back to sleep. He sat down on the bed, feeling sick because of the pain in his arm. He had been told bones growth was painful but he did not except it to hurt this much. He hated Lockhart more than anything in this moment.
- Because we saw what you people could do with our own eyes! Dudley shouted, his voice so alike his father now. I'd rather die here in my home than being used as toys by those monsters in the streets, like they did with the Harlans. One of them tortured mr. Harlan all night. We heard him. And his wife. She was screaming for them to stop. They were just trying to run away!
- How kind, Draco said sarcastically. How very generous of you, Potter. As if I had any choice but to stick with you.
Harry heard it again. He could hear Malfoy gasp and hold back sobs, as well. Then, he saw it. He saw his ears. As big as Harry's arms. His round sad eyes and his scarred and long fingers. Finally, he felt the weight of the little elf when he got onto the bed, making the mattress creak again.
Harry was looking at him the same way he did when they first met. A mix of confusion and anger on his face. It made Draco sad to think about it. He knew it was last time they would ever see each other.
But the four of them were dead now. Gone. And Harry and Draco were left alone with only the other for company. And with Hogwarts destroyed and Black's old house taken from the Order by Bellatrix and her minions, the Order had to separate. In the chaos, Ron Weasley had disappeared with his family, Hermione Granger with them, but Harry had stayed behind to make sure nobody was hurt. Not for the first time, he saved Draco's life, with the help of Tonks, who Bellatrix killed right after they'd put him out of danger. It was a strange feeling, somebody sacrificing their life for him. He never really liked Tonks. But she had died so he could live.
He thought of Snape, Tonks, his mother... of Harry when he saved him at Hogwarts, and after that at the Headquarters.
- Safe? Vernon shouted again. Safe, you say? Where? The whole country is a battlefield! Monsters everywhere! I saw a man tore another apart with teeth as big as my hands. This thing didn't even look human. Even children aren't safe from them. I heard disturbing things... things that would keep you awake at night, boy. Your people did this. And now you want us to come with you?
It was not Malfoy's voice. It was the Professor McGonagall's. Harry rushed to open the door, forgetting Dobby had locked it. He tapped on the door, not too loud, and called Malfoy.
- Hermione was wrong. Your father may have paid you your place in the team but you're good. You could have entered the team without your father's money.
"You said the monster couldn't tell apart the pure bloods from the others. Are you sure about that ?
Malfoy was threatening to cry, Harry judged by his trembling voice. Dobby, he almost answered, before the elf put a finger on Harry's mouth, pleading with his eyes not to tell anything. Harry looked at Dobby with a furrowed brow, confused.
The boy was the first one to notice Draco's presence. Something about Dudley reminded him of Goyle. Though Dudley was no less than three heads taller than Goyle had been the last time Draco saw him, before he'd heard how he'd been killed during the battle at Hogwarts.
But Harry did not have time to listen to Malfoy. He pushed him inside and closed the door behind him, worrying Malfoy in the process.
Harry put his arm around him, as if to shield him from the horror they were witnessing. But Draco knew better. Harry Potter had this irritating instinct to protect everyone. The bombs surprised him, and so his first instinct was to protect Draco. That didn't mean anything. It was just Harry Potter being Harry Potter, as always.
- No, we're not, his uncle said firmly. And if you make us follow you, we'll never stop trying to escape. We'll make it very hard on you, boy. We won't let you take us. So, go ahead. Take out your magic wand and abradabra us if you dare. Go on.
- You can go if you want, Harry offered him, having made his decision. I won't try and convince you to come with me.
Draco stayed at the door, half inside, half outside. The Dursleys' house was small, and strange to him. It also seemed ridiculously easy to enter muggle habitations. Draco shook his head in disbelief. Did they have any idea of how to protect themselves at all?
Harry hesitated. It demanded too much of him to leave him. Harry, the defender of the innocent, Potter. But Draco was not an innocent. Far from it.
- You won't leave them. No matter what you say, you'll come back for them and it'll get you killed. You heard the prophecy, Potter. You must be the one to defeat You-Know-Who. Again, you leave me no other choice. But it's okay. This is how I want to go. For all of those who sacrificed their lives for me.
Harry nodded to the elf, got up from his bed and walked with Dobby to the nursery's door. He passed Malfoy's bed, and was close enough to see his terrified face. Malfoy stared at Harry in confusion.
Aunt Petunia, Harry had called her. Her long blond hair were all over the place, giving her the look of a deranged person. Draco thought she looked as if ready to throw herself at anyone who would dare approach too closely. But once she was certain it was really Harry before her, she made herself as tall as she could, as if to prove something. Her husband didn't even try. He and the so called Dudley were terrified of Harry. It seemed that, family or not, he was first and foremost a wizard. And a dangerous one at that.
Malfoy called Harry by his first name, which took him aback. His arm hurt so bad he did not even had the energy to react. He simply looked at Dobby expectantly. Dobby leaned nearer to Harry and whispered to him : "Dobby must speak to Mr Harry Potter. Alone."
But Harry took him with him, refused to let him go, and Draco had not the strenght to fight him. Maybe it was because he felt like he owed Draco. Three years ago, Harry and his friends were brought to the Malfoy Manor and Draco made the worst decision of his life. He helped them. That decision led to the Malfoys' downfall, it ruined absolutely everything. Voldemort was informed and decided he didn't need them anymore. It'd been the last straw. They had let Harry Potter escape and had to pay for it. The Malfoys fought until they couldn't. Bellatrix betrayed them and helped the dark lord find them. Draco could still hear his father's screaming as he was being killed before his eyes. And the silence that followed, right before his mother took him away from the scene. Narcissa Malfoy died fighting her own sister, Bellatrix, a couple of months ago. His mother could have beaten his aunt, he knew. But Narcissa always put her family first of all, even those who turned on her. Draco didn't see her die. He had done what she asked of him, as he always did, and ran.
- I know, Draco cut him off. I was on their side not long ago, hopefully they won't know I'm a turncloak.
- You know I can make you if I want to, Harry told his cousin, losing patience. You're acting like I could hurt you. Like I hurt you before. And I could have. You've been horrible to me. But I didn't. So, why are you scared now?
Without another word, Harry made for his relatives' neighbourhood. Draco followed. They could have apparated there but using magic would tell the Ministry where they were, so they had to run in the rain.
He wished she hadn't. Oh, he wished that more than anything. Especially as he didn't plan on living for much longer. Ever since his parents were betrayed and killed by Voldemort, he had no reason to go on.
"What are we gonna do ?" Malfoy asked out of the blue. Or maybe it was to break the tension, Harry did not know.
A war seemed to have taken place in his head. It was quite a surprise to see Harry Potter hesitate to go and save somebody that needed his help. Draco stayed speechless.
The moment the door closed, the room was in the darkness once again. Harry heard Malfoy getting out of bed and approaching Colin's.
Harry didn't even seem phased by the things his uncle was accusing them of doing. But he looked disturbed to hear what his family had seen. Draco had seen so much worse than that, but he could understand the anguish muggles could be feeling after witnessing this much violence, and the horror Harry felt that his family had to go through something like that. Draco was sure Harry himself never saw children being mercilessly killed by Death Eaters.
These would be the last words spoken between them if Draco didn't intervene. And it would haunt Harry forever. He didn't want to care but like the time at his manor, he couldn't help it. His parents would be turning in their graves if they knew what he was about to do.
“I’ll try and be more gentlemanly next time then.” She spotted another boy in a fake Ballycastle Bats uniform. “Hey Vince!”
"What on Earth are you doing boy?" Snape went to the front of their table to ask Terry. Terry clenched his hands and put them behind his back.
“That’s exactly the look we’re going for! You get it.” She beamed up at Potter and Draco supposed that was Pansy won over. Only took a couple of minutes and collective Draco teasing for it to happen.
"Eh, I'm afraid our version will probably be wayyyy tamer and wayyyy more boring. Or, at least, I don't think they'll let anybody die." Octavia tuned back in to Dumbledore.
On the sofa, Luna looked like she was nearly done with a red beanie, slightly less deformed than mine. And Malfoy...I think he was asleep on Luna's shoulder, with Virgo hissing quietly on the top of his head. I went to sit next to the sleeping boy, and ever so carefully removed Virgo's coiled state from atop his head. She focused her unblinking beady eyes on me and curled up my hand to my forearm, where she rested like her owner. I looked over to Malfoy and Luna, and saw that Luna was struggling to lift her arm to knit because of his sleeping form leaning on top of her.
“I don’t really want to kiss you, Pansy.” Draco told her. “But I will be your boyfriend and do everything else. Holding hands and playing together is fun!”
"Hahahah! You've got to teach me some of those really wizard swears someday, seriously. The worst I've ever heard being said was 'Merlin'." Draco scowled at him jokingly.
"Wingardium Leviosa." The feather shifted, and then began to float upwards. It reached a foot off the table before Harry dropped it. "I did it! How did you know?" He asked Draco excitedly, his face going close to Draco's.
“I’m a bit worried. Were you in his class when Professor Moody...m-made him do that? To his arm?” She admitted, looking at him with what she hoped were guarded eyes
I angled my head round, eyes fixed on my reflection. This is so strange. It looks like I'm wearing a wig. Or I'm no longer wearing a wig. My hair doesn't look like it belongs to me. When it looked like a bird's nest, at least it was lively! Now it's bland.
Professor McGonogall filed them all into a small empty chamber off the hall, and Draco found himself having the tug on Neville and Hermione's robes to keep them moving as they were still taking in the castle. The castle so far had only reminded Draco of the East wing of the manor, and had made him a bit uncomfortable. He hoped all of the castle wasn't like this.
Who would even like a stupid fool like Potter. He’s silly and self sacrificing and is a right cunt at the best of times. He can take a punch and keep on coming, but that just means he doesn’t know how to quit. He’s a pretty good wizard, but it’s all an over exaggeration, and he doesn’t even get that good grades. He smells bad, he’s unfashionable, he doesn’t know how to groom, he’s talked about far too much, he’s full of himself, needs to be brought down to earth all the time, and he’s a dick to all Slytherins.
“I did get a little idea a while ago, something I think would annoy you.” Potter gave him a look and Draco shrugged. “I wasn’t going to do it, obviously, it’s just a habit. But maybe now we can use the plan as an advantage.” He bit his thumb as he thought. “Do you know anyone who owns a badge presser?”
He was supposed to though, they were both meant to like each other, and Pansy did for a couple of years. She’d gotten over him in early on however, and their friendship only grew stronger.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! This was the most fun to write, but I did use a bit of dialogue from the books. (I obviously don't own Harry Potter). I will flesh out Terry's character more, as well as the other Ravenclaw boys. I'm kind of rewriting them as new characters compared to whatever dialogue snippets they had in the book. These boys are now mine. I adopted them. #RavenclawBois
"Yes or no, final time I'm asking, do you want a piggy back?" He offered again, getting off of his knees and brushing off the filth.
"Stop being so loud about Hogwarts dear, King's Cross is packed with muggles. Of course they're probably too busy rushing about to notice anything unusual.
"It's actually Diagon Alley," Draco corrected quickly, mentally writing up the boy's answers. "And I'm not an elf. I'm a human." The witches were done with both of their robes by then and were gently shoving them towards the front of the shop.
"It's a weird aesthetic, I have to admit. Who was the one who told Rowena Ravenclaw to add that feature?" The tall boy, Michael, asked.
"She would not stop crying and crying, it must have really hurt. She was almost completely red by the time Madame Pomfrey put on the burn salve. She's going to have to rest there until tomorrow morning. I told her I'll visit her with some victoria sponge cake during dinner and keep her company." Michael told them as he piled his plate with sandwiches.
Draco lead Blaise to their shared dorm and still held his hand as he collapsed backwards onto his bed. He closed his eyes.
"Why didn't you stick up for me against Weasley on the train?" Harry's face blanched. "I-I mean, n-not that you n-needed t-to, it's f-f-fine, but I was j-just wondering, um-"
Luna had been knitting this whole time, but when Malfoy stopped yelling she grabbed his arm and gently coaxed him back onto the sofa. When he sat down she rubbed his arm comfortingly. For the first time since lunch, I saw Virgo again, slithering out of the wand holster to wind round Malfoy's arm, in a similar gesture to Luna.
“And another thing,” Draco whispered in Blaise’s, nibbling on it slightly to tease him. Blaise’s shoulders tensed up.
On the 4th of July, Draco was in Diagon Alley shopping for his school supplies, being accompanied by his mother. Looking at them, you'd think Narcissa was there to look after Draco. She thought she was as well. The actuality of the situation was Draco chaperoning Narcissa and holding her hand so she wouldn't wander off. He had been ticking down the items on his list one by one and had just finished buying his wand. The man in the shop, Ollivander, had gone on quite a bit about the unicorn hair core and how special it was. Draco appreciated the sentiment in trying to make a first wand exciting but Mother had almost had one of her turns from boredom, so he'd had to politely excuse them both. She was now quite restless.
"I'm okay. Me and Father were just playing today and it got a bit out of hand." He lied smoothly. He didn't want to fill her mind with troubles when she was in this fragile state. Her hand was soft and caring as she held onto his, so he gave hers a quick squeeze. She'd be better soon. He just had to help.
“You never were a man Alek! Get over yourself!” Another boy yelled at the crier. Octavia turned her eyes back to the goblet like many others.
“Yeah...maybe...” he replied weakly, breathing in deeply. He tried to take another step, but the bad leg gave out on him, again.
His hands weren’t especially close to the ropes, so he’d have to use something that could get rid of them from a slight distance.
“Thanks Via. You’re right, I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m cool.” His self confirmation reminded her grossly of Potter. “You want to get some tutoring in? I’ll even let you bring a friend along.” He offered as they entered the common room.
“We’re, like, one year younger than you,” at Greg’s raised eyebrow, he conceded, “ugh, FINE, we won’t summon any ghosts!” The blonde boy said, annoyed.
"Children!" Lucius intervened after he was done throwing playground insults at father Weasley. "Enough!" They acquiesced again and both slumped back in their seats in unison.
“Won’t be taken as seriously if we just give them away for free.” He nudged her. “And if you stop complaining, I’ll share some of the cash. Pocket money you don’t have to beg mum for.” She sighed.
"I've got to run, Via, I'll see you at lunch." He ruffled her hair as he stood up. She nodded distractedly as she dived head first into her supply of sweets. "And don't eat all of the sweets! She only sends a package once every two weeks!"
The silence was broken  by what sounded like a spell being uttered. Draco covered Octavia on instinct.
"Lets make some fairy cakes." Draco smiled tiredly back. His mother loved making fairy cakes. He did most of the actual baking, and he was thankful it was easy, while she handled the decorations. Even in this state, she still had an incredibly careful hand when applying icing and sprinkles. She always made them look beautiful.
“If you’re so surrre.” Draco tried to remember the password. It was some sort of muggle Halloween reference. “What was it, what was it...” he muttered, “right! It was that muggle song by those front-road-boys...” he tried to remember it. Potter gave him a weird look.
"Try and stretch out the 'gar" a bit longer. Now use your wand while you do it. Levitate the feather."
"Rule Number 12; A Pureblood is always calm and collected. Rule Number 13; A Pureblood child must be seen and not heard. Rule Number 14; A Pureblood is well educated. Rule Number 15; When one is of age, a Pureblood will court another Pureblood of the opposite gender and will create a heir between them. Rule Number 16; A Pureblood is punctual and never late. Rule Number.."
“Okay, maybe weird vibes IS how I look at my friends, but Vince isn’t the incredible Blaise Zabini or a common slag like Pansy,” Draco hit him on the pec, “Vince is just Vince. And Vince is totally into Greg.”
He felt defeated that he’d given in to such an easy task, and his knowledge of everyone else watching him crept back in.
"That's the best bed hair I've ever seen!" Michael pointed at him while laughing. Draco pouted and tried to smooth it down. There were locks of hair sticking up in ways Draco didn't know was possible. He put a hand through it and tried mussing it up. It looked better at least. It wasn't neat, but it wasn't terrible. It looked a bit too fluffy, so he went over to the en suite and took out his jar of hair gel. He got out a bit and flattened his blonde hair down. It wasn't completely stuck to his scalp, but it was managable. He exited the bathroom to put on his shoes.
"Thank you for your service. Come along Mother, we really should be going home now." He grabbed Narcissa's hand and steered her away from the others.
"Oooh, peppermint, my favourite. How did you remember?" She asked happily, popping her knitting needles into the loose bun atop her head.
Things weren't okay. Things were far from okay. Things were never okay, and Draco wondered when he'd get used to that.
When she left, the house was painfully quiet. Even quieter than it usually was. Draco sighed and returned to his studies, transferring his attention back to transfiguration, and practising his wandless magic and his magical core with some meditation.
She did so. He then aimed a careful charm at the fake vampire teeth, making them glow softly. The other girl, Martha, gasped. He smirked.
“Will you race me or not? Isn’t it crucial that you give me a favour on your ‘Slytherin honour’ or whatever?” Draco looked down and huffed. “Just one little race?” Draco gave the other boy an exasperated sigh.
With that last word, everyone began to stand up to go up to the dormitories. The other first years followed a prefect around, but Octavia stayed by Draco.
“Keep it down you hussies, I’ve got a head the feels like it was steamrolled by the Hogwarts Express.” Theo Nott complained, hugging his pillow over said head.
"No, we're far subtler with our colour scheme. More silver." He looked round properly. "If it looked anything like this I'm afraid I'd have to burn the place."
“Operimentum.” He cast and the bruise seemed to fade. It still hurt, but at least it wasn’t visible anymore.
"C'mon Ma-Tom! You made me come all the way here out of your own snootiness, please tell me it wasn't all for nothing." He rolled his eyes at me and straightened his neck again.
I hope you enjoyed this little installment to the story which I literally wrote at midnight because of a comment I saw from a reader called Sarah. Thanks for giving me the drive to get off of my keister and write another chapter, I love doing this. Please leave comments and kudos if you enjoyed, and any constructive criticisms and ideas are welcome. I'd love to know any ideas you could have because I'm playing it by ear and just want to keep this easy going. See you next time, I will hopefully update soon. Keep strong in quarantine my amigos!
I swear I am so close to finishing the next chapter of double trouble I am just swamped in school work and my own procrastination.
"I'm guessing this is the 'big dangerous event' that will be hosted at Hogwarts this year?" Octavia nudged her starstruck brother. He smirked.
“Grand!” Martha pulled out a pink hairbrush and immediately set to work getting to knots out of Octavia’s long blonde hair. “Your hair reminds me of this girl I knew in primary school. A muggle one. My parents are both Muggle-Born so they wanted me and my brother to experience a normal childhood. Well, not ‘normal’, that’s a bit general, but an average muggle childhood. So anyway, this girl was called Jessie and she had the longest, blondest-“ she continued to yammer on. Octavia listened happily, grateful for the distraction.
“Well I guess Vince needs my help, so I’d love to stick around but...” Draco struggled to be released by Blaise and Pansy. They snickered and he batted at both of them before he was released so suddenly he landed in a pile on the carpet. “Ha ha ha. Very funny.” He smoothed his uniform down. “And I wouldn’t get too comfortable. After I help Vince with his late homework we’d best get class.”
"I apologise father. Which law shall I recite them backwards f-from?" The boy stood taller, his clammy hands held fearfully behind his back. Every part of his was meticulously crafted. His robes were expensive and well made, tailored to fit him exactly. His hair was slicked back with gel, not a single hair out of place. His face was sharp and pale, having only a slight amount of baby fat left to soften his young features, the product of years of Pureblood ancestry. He was made for perfection.
Until next time beautifuls! Please stay safe in this trying time and WEAR A GOSH DARN MASK! It's common sense! Luv ya <3 xxxx
"I'm feeling happy today. What about you, my duckling?" Draco flushed happily at the nickname. That nickname meant she was feeling more grounded. It was more likely that she wasn't going to have one of her turns.
"Via," Draco hissed, "Mother told us to stay in one spot! And we're not going with them!" He gave the trio a side eye.
"Were you two playing with jam again?" She asked obliviously. Draco averted his eyes downward sadly.
After Martha had added a couple of red dots to Octavia’s neck, used some ‘contour’ to make Octavia’s cheekbones look hollower and added some sort of powder to make Octavia’s skin tone a sickly grey, she stuck the pair of glow-in-the-dark vampire teeth in Octavia’s mouth.
“Oh my gosh, are you okay? What happened?” Martha came up to her and perched herself at the edge of Octavia’s bed.
"Okay I got first question! What school house do you think you'll be in? I'd like to be in Gryffindor because it sounds like the best. Albus Dumbledore himself was in it!" Hermione shot out.
“Preferably. I’d rather not explain to mother why I wanted to order one. It doesn’t seem very studious.” Draco explained.
“I know you’re there Potter.” Draco told the shoe, watching as it shuffled and he heard a muffled gasp. He heard the sound of fabrics moving until Potter revealed himself awkwardly.
"Agh, fucking hell! Shit!" I hopped up on one foot. That fucking hurt! I picked it up again, still keeping it at arms length. It was still blowing air furiously. I fiddled with the buttons again until I fixed it to a setting I was okay with. I held it steadily with two hands. To be safe.
Draco sat cross legged on his bed and flicked through the Big Book Of Stories, Tales, Myths and Legends for the perfect one.
“And that is all? I bet Drako finds me...att-rac-teev. Don’t you?” Aleksander confronted him and Draco backed up, before rising from his seat.
"Of course I'm a legend, I'm legendary!" Draco refrained from mentioning that the ghost's life and death were considered more cautionary fairy tales. The other students were watching in awe as Draco talked to the smug ghost, some cowering away from the pearly white form as he floated upwards. "So which one of you little first years cares to hear the legend of the great, the incredible, the breathtaking -!"
“Oh shut up you Cows. And budge over, this is the comfortable chair.” Blaise tired to nudge them to other side of the chair.
Draco fixed him with a level glare. “Oh, c'est vrai? Juste assez pour ‘impressionner les filles’? Quelles bile tu craches. Bien que, je n'attendrais pas plus d'une fouine. Droit, regarder toi même tu connasse.” He spat at the Weasel, enjoying the way he scowled defeatedly. There was nothing quite like insulting someone in another language. He turned to Potter, seeing if he had anything to say.
Theo grinned. It looked dangerous. “Right, but that’s the thing. You always seem to advertise...” his hand traced Blaise’s leg, “...the things the great Blaise Zabini can do, but then I don’t get any of it? Isn’t really fair, is it?” He pouts.
“I’m not the one who was amazed by Scooby Doo.” Potter said and Draco thought that was a bit unfair.
"So when did you learn you were magic? Did you experience many bouts of accidental magic as a child? Who told you that you were a wizard? Did you choose to go to Hogwarts or did they tell you to? Did you even get the option of going international with your magic schooling? How difficult did you find the conversion of muggle money into galleons? Am I the first wizard you've met? On a scale of one to ten, how exciting is the magical world compared to the muggle one?" That last question could have a biased answer, but Draco didn't care.
“Zey are ridiculous, are zey not? From one boy to zee ozer!” She rolled her eyes. Draco side eyed her.
“Oh mon Dieu! Are you ze Harry Potter?!” Juliette shrieked excitedly, rushing over to the twat to fawn. The others followed suit, one of them even brushing his hair over his forehead to reveal that Merlin-for-shaken lightning bolt scar.
“Perfect. Later then. Goodbye Drakey, our group’s oblivious and supportive Veela.” Blaise wrapped his arms around him and squeezed.
"Wow, I am getting a serious sense of deja vu right now," he chuckled. "Wait wait wait, let me just quickly-" He turned away from me to fess up his hair, and then quickly transfigured a small lamp into a...pair of glasses? He put those on, then turned to me and said in what must have been the most annoying voice he could muster.
“I apologise Zabini, but I have already accepted another heart, you’re too late!” Pansy rejects, equalling dramatic. Draco was caught in the middle of them.
"Besides, the people at the Ravenclaw table aren't exactly being the kindest or the most investing with their conversations." She fiddled with her quill earring. At this, Neville narrowed his eyes.
"Yes, well, Disney employees flirting with Draco aside, it really was a nice day out. Draco really passed for a muggle. We didn't get to see the fireworks they said would be there, because we had to be back by sundown, but I promised we would let some go this year, maybe Christmas." I grinned at her.
A couple of hours more on the stairs he started to drift off, head leaning on the wall. He was about to lose consciousness when he heard a click.
“Why Potter, do you insist on being a stupid sort of git?” Draco gritted and he lunged for the book one last time. He grabbed it and snatched it away from the idiot, brushing off imaginary dust as he clutched it.
“Drakey!” Pansy came up to him with a cup of whiskey in hand. “Look, I’m super sorry about the kiss, it was ridiculous-“ she blinked. “Why do you have Potter hanging off your arm?” She pointed to the two of them. “Is he thinking he can enroll in Slytherin since he cheated his way to being a champion?” She asked accusingly. Potter stood his ground.
Kissing her felt really wrong. It was rushed and sloppy and he had still been acting in fake confidence. And then there was tongue and the kiss immediately went wet and scary.
The boy’s eyes glanced at the sack that lay at Draco’s feet, and then at Cushion, and then at the sleeping idiot.
“Great!” Martha yanked Octavia so that she was kneeling on the floor facing her bed. “Do you mind if I brush your hair?”
“So you’re the famous Draco Malfoy, hmm?” The friend of Via’s confronted him, raising a judgemental eyebrow. Draco matched it, refusing to be outdone by a first year.
Pansy turns to Octavia with a heartbroken look, and somehow manages to let a single tear roll down her cheek. “You have hurt me, Octi. You’ve hurt me.” She whispered the last line. Octavia rolled her eyes into the back of her head.
"I know! The crazy stuff people get up to! Gives a guy ideas." Michael bounced his eyebrows at Anthony, who pretended to swoon into his arms.
The wedding was in a month, and Rowan was forbidden to see Gale until after it was over. In this month however, Gale was working on a new spell. A spell that would save their love.
She pulled out the garment from the others and revealed it to be a small, gorgeous dress. It had dark purple puffy sleeves, easing into a light blue sweetheart neckline. The rest of the torso was a light purple colour, with a sheen of thin blue material over it, giving it a sparkle in the light. The skirt was large and poofy, made up of many layers of dark purple and light blue fabric, giving it an incredible volume that would sway when dancing. On the hem of the skirt it had many small blue gemstones, growing smaller up the dress, reminding Octavia of raindrops. It was beautiful and regal. It was perfect. And it was just her size.
“You’ll find out tonight at the party. See ya!” They moved on back to their dorms. Draco shook his head.
"Casey Way's Curlifier 5002, the perfect way to regain your old curly hair. Simply apply straight to head and watch for instant results..." I looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. "You're going to make your hair curly again?" He nodded while grinning.
“You are only fourth year?” Viktor sounded surprised, and Draco flushed happily. “You look more mature than many.”
"Ah Fudge," Lucius offered his hand to be shaken, "how are you? I don't think you've met my wife Narcissa? Or my children, Octavia and Draco?" Draco gave Fudge a fake smile and Octavia gave him a stilted curtsy. Fudge carried on introductions as the children walked over to their seats.
She made Draco do a little test to see how well he could make things out, and gave him a Draught of Peace just in case. He took it happily. She cast a Brackium Emendo on his leg and recommended a lack of strenuous physical activity for a couple of days. Octavia watched Madame Pomfrey with wide eyes, practically taking notes.
Draco was shaking. His hands were shaking. He clenched and unclenched his fists but it didn't help. He was still shaking.
"Because he's a biased oppressor!" Anthony said, slamming a book down on the table to make more noise, calling them to the attention of more Ravenclaws
"I don't know, the principle I guess?" Letting people know that it might be locked for a reason because they get their wands out? No clue." I nodded and with a click, opened up the door. Malfoy went straight into the bathroom to stock up all the bottles and I promptly collapsed onto my bed, not even bothering with my clothes.
“He. Did. WHAT?!” Octavia yelled, trembling slightly in anger. “I’m going to kill him. I’m going to kill him and make it look like a BLOODY ACCIDENT!” Her yelling was drawing attention from others in the dorm, but Octavia didn’t care.
“It’s not a joke, I’m a legit SNACK.” Blaise yelled and covered his face with a hand. “A goddamn P.Y.T.” He mumbled tearfully.
“Because you’re on our side now.” Sirius told him and Draco scoffed loudly. “And you may be stupidly stubborn, but guess what? So am I. You’re not returning to Trixie anytime soon.” Draco’s magic flared slightly in anger.
"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce...the Bulgarian Team Mascots!" Ludo continued as the right hand of the stands cheered louder.
Malfoy grimaced and gagged. "Ugh, never needed that mental picture Potter, I really, truly, didn't." I laughed at his discomfort.
"Pansy, stop laughing, it's not that funny." Malfoy's voice whined from the wardrobe. Pansy responded with bursting into cackles most befitting for a witch.
“You only dislike me because I’m not a house elf.” Draco said, and felt relief when his fingertips began to feel their normal weight.
“Dobromir! You said s’at I could try ‘flir-teeng’ with s’is one! It vas my turn!” A shorter boy with a strong accent yelled at the deep voiced one. Draco’s continued to look like he was going to die of heatstroke from the heat in his own cheeks.
“I’m younger than this lot.” She gestured to the fourth and fifth years. “Twelve, to be exact. The name’s Octavia Malfoy.” She offered her hand across the table to Viktor. She then noticed Draco trying to hide his shock and inner fanboy at the fact Viktor Krum was sitting right next to him.
He repeated this process of cleaning up and charming the rubbish bags away for a little bit, thinking distinctively that this was house elf work, but not wanting them to become involved, as they would most certainly snitch about any prohibited paraphernalia they would find, and it wasn’t worth the risk.
“But you didn’t see the intimacy of it!” Blaise holds Draco by the shoulders. “The INTIMACY.” He shakes him. Draco keeps a neutral face.
“BECAUSE WE’LL NEVER BE WRONG TOGETHER - We can take to the end of the night! Because your love is like a shadow on me all of the time!” They sang out dramatically in unison.
"Oh yes! I went with Lucius Malfoy and Amy Clover and Abelia Parkinson and Gaston Goyle, and sweet Andromeda and Bellatrix. Bella always had the funniest jokes. You've met your Aunty Andy and Aunt Bella haven't you?" He hadn't. Andromeda Black was considered a blood traitor and Bellatrix Lestrange was a convicted criminal who had been stuck in Azkaban since before Draco could crawl.
He crossed his arms over his chest and looked down boredly. He missed Samhain. Celebrating the dead. Creating the veil between the dead and alive, and saying hello to those he’d only ever seen in portraits. Surrounding a large bonfire in the manor grounds and letting the sky light up. Spending time with Via.
“Draco may have a point.” Said Pansy. “We are only Slytherins. People think we’re evil anyways. Draco’s history in picking fights with the Golden Trio doesn’t really help either. It’s our word against that of a trusted Hogwarts professor and a previous Auror. We may as well be fighting against the law.”
“That you’ll forever be hanging onto me and the gang. We all adore you, you know this, but I do want you to have some friends your own age. Also, Blaise is a terrible influence.” She giggled. “He is! He’s disgusting and I’m scared you’re going to learn about things you’re not ready to learn about. You need disgusting over-sharing friends your own age, you know.” She rolls her eyes.
“What.” Draco said flatly, and he fidgeted again. He was currently being tied to a chair with magic rope, but clearly knew his spells as he hadn’t struggled much. With struggle these ropes only tightened. The kid’s wand was in Sirius’ pocket, so there was no way out for him.
"Why yes I am! Finally, someone with a good taste in history! I say, boy, where did you hear of me?" The ghost asked Draco with a proud posture, smoothing back what little hair he had.
After realising that I'd been staring I awkwardly cleared my throat and averted my eyes. What the hell was that about?
“Draco, why do you feel the need to lie to us? What’s so scandalous you need to hide it?”  Octavia teased him. Draco scowled and his cheeks began to turn red.
“Don’t swear. And it’s not my fault, I ran out of sugar quills. Speaking of, may I...” She rolled her eyes far too sassily for her own good and forked one over.
Octavia giggled. “Yeah, my and Draco never really fight.” She sniffed loudly and Martha handed her a tissue. She took it thankfully. “So whenever we do fight, it’s about something more than paint stains or stealing. This time it got pretty bad. Escalated terribly.”
"Not too bad I suppose...you still look far too tall, but at least you don't look wiry...your head is too big for your body, but with that tie it looks less comical...yes I think this is the best we're going to get from you."
“Facialis Pingere Exite.” He cast and Pansy’s make up was wiped clean. Draco preferred Pansy’s face without makeup. Had a softer look. But Pansy really enjoyed putting on makeup and using colour so Draco didn’t mention it. Whatever made Pansy happy made him happy. So he just smiled.
"What's S.P.E.W?" He asked suddenly. Ah. Damn it. Hermione must be trying to start it up again. She grinned hesitantly at Malfoy's question, glad that someone had asked so she could further explain house elf rights, but wary of that someone being Malfoy.
“And yet you still said it. A normal child!” She scoffed again. “Notions as such should be punished.” Draco’s eyes widened.
“I recall otherwise. Anyway, allow ME to acquaint you with Margaux, Chloé, Laure, Amélie, Juliette, Angélique, Elodie, Anais, Morgane, Lucie, Isabelle and Anne.” He introduced them all in one breath to the trio. Each girl gave a little squeal as he referred to them, and some tried to drape themselves over his arms.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Introducing my Ravenclaw bois and giving more information on Terry. Also adding some Ravenclaw dormitory info.
“I dislike you because are full of disrespect. Just like Mistress Lestrange says.” The house elf seemed gleeful. “Your ‘stir craze’ will soon cause you to be punished, I know so. You will have wished that you could be kidnapped.” A strange wheezy laugh came out of Kreacher. Draco rolled his eyes again.
A set of hands gripped his, and pulled them from his legs. If you looked closely you could make out little holes dug into the fabric of his trousers. One of his legs was probably bleeding. The set of hands were soft as they cupped his and stroked them. His tears kept falling and his face crumpled again. It was such a strange gesture, but it was comforting. It was soft. He let out another sob. He could live forever as long as he had this. He wasn't used to it, but he wished he was.
The day continued at the Malfoy's tent, Octavia finally finishing her book and Draco convincing her to cheer for Ireland at the match, when finally dusk had settled over the campsite. The air was alive with anticipation, and as Octavia witnessed, Draco was practically levitating in his seat. He was bouncing off the walls quizzing Octavia about her quidditch knowledge and filling up on chocolate, though he denied spending a lot of his time staring at the Viktor Krum poster, Octavia knew better.
"There isn't  a test, don't worry. I've read about the sorting, they put the magic sorting hat on your head and it reads your mind to deduce which house you would fit best in by your qualities. There's no way to fail. Unless you have a very diverse personality, but then the sorting hat just makes a decision. I've heard it even takes opinion into account sometimes. So I wouldn't worry." He was saying that to himself as much as he was saying it to her. He saw some people as well as Hermione sigh a little in relief when he explained this.
As he got to the 20th page of the book he realised that he probably won't find anything to help his problem. It was an amateur book written by a group of students that only contained a lot of waffle about accepting yourself who you are and steroetypes and yadda yadda yadda. It was the furthest thing from helpful he could have found.
“I don’t think of you much Potter, going to be honest. But I do think that you’re being far too loud for someone wandering the hallways at night.” He pulled his hand back. “Now as entertaining as watching you being distressed is, I did not sign up to be your Mind Healer.” Potter scowled.
"O-oh, right, that. Uh, I suppose my parents were magic but I was raised by my aunt and uncle. They're muggles." His parents 'were'? Ah, an orphan then. His parents probably died in the war.
From the barrier he saw Harry and the ginger boy come through, both of there faces lighting up in wonder. Then Harry spotted him.
. “I keep forgetting that everything’s magic now, and stuff that I thought were just fairy tales are actually real. What next, are Unicorns real?!” Danny yelled a bit, panicking behind them.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you - Dimitrov!"
The cold was seeping through his coat, and the cold numbness was far crueler than his brain’s numbness. His hair was covered in ice. He probably looked like a twat.
Octavia was amongst them, thankfully not wearing any vampire teeth, but instead patiently waiting for a friend to apply some make up and fake blood to her face. Draco decided to walk over.
” He heard himself scream out loud and he jerked his arm away, spilling an inkwell all over himself. He gasped as he felt the curse let go of him. He looked upwards, ignoring the stares of his classmates, to Professor Moody.
“Stop trying to blame me. Also, your introduction wasn’t as smooth as Octi’s here.” Blaise ruffled her hair. She scowled up at him.
“It isn’t funny Draco! He should be hung! Performing the Imperius on school children, attempting to vandalise you with the Dark Mark while under the curses influence?! This is serious!” She yelled up at him.
"Do not lie, boy!" Crouch aimed his wand at Draco's face. "You've been discovered at the scene of the crime!"
"I-I'm sorry, here let me..." He struggled to maneuver his trolley out of the way. As soon as he did the oldest boy marched towards the wall and went through. Draco blinked twice. Huh. Seamless.
Wooooo booooyy. So that’s chapter three. I’m sorry if it’s a short bit shorter but I didn’t want to drag it out for an ideal word count. I’m sure the next chapter will be longer and hopefully better. Warning: heavy flirting and dumb teens being dumb teens.
Like Mother said, you compartmentalise your thoughts in many different drawers, and then when you have a thought you don’t like or you want to keep hidden, you put it in a specific drawer and lock the door.
“And why would we want to raise them?” He asked indifferently. The Gryffindors turned around in surprise, as if they’d only just noticed the Slytherins had arrived.
“Yep, poor Draco here got turned into a ferret by Professor Moody.” Blaise told her through a mouth full of food. Pansy cringed a bit in disgust and turned back to Draco.
"Granger! Hermione Granger, yes." She answered immediately. Draco nodded and turned back around to his original carriage.
“And then you’ll stick your Viktor Krum poster to a plain shirt. Boom! Veela Cheerleader costume!” She levelled his gaze at her.
Blaise tutted. “Such a prude. Now it’s time to sort your costume. Ladies?” He addressed them, “I believe you’ll take him from here? I need to change into something fantastic!” He swaggered into the en suite bathroom, carrying some red items.
"What the bloody hell are you wearing Potter? That shirt has a blasted hole in it!" He points at Dudley's clothing. I take a closer look at the shirt, and sure enough, it had a small hole near it's frayed hem.
but yes im getting back on track, and I'm sorry for ghosting ya'll for over two months, that was a total dick move and i love all my followers, supporters, kudo-ers and commenters. you are the backbone of ao3 and even though youre drarry shippers and probably fruity  :/// i am too >:) so we're in this together.
After Octavia was done brushing Martha’s brown locks, Martha pulled out the strange contraption again.
“Well, he’s a total art weirdo. He likes painting a lot but gets his art supplies all over my clothes. It’s pretty annoying. He also likes music, but he’s a terrible singer.”
She enjoyed writing the essays and putting her own spin on each topic. The real interesting parts were in the footnotes, such as the Goblin king Lalsthuber III’s real reason for claiming war on the elves was one of his twenty wives being contaminated with their woodland magic, and that all the juicy parts were lost in translation.
He thinks that being quiet is the best part of his moments. Means that other people get a break. He ought to have his brain stop working more often.
When her brother and his friends returned to the dungeons that night, it was chaos. Greg and Vince were both questioning Draco incessantly, while Draco determinedly attempted to ignore them both. Blaise was trying to stop the two boys from pushing too far as Pansy looked at them all from the sidelines with annoyance.
It had been a pretty big fight about coming back to Hogwarts, for all three of us. After Hermione had traveled to Australia to fix her parents with the help of a Healer, and had explained the situation to them after they remembered, they flipped out. They were so worried and scared for her and the danger she had put herself in that they nearly banned magic for her. She had to stay in Australia for another couple of days to console them, and then another couple of days to get them to agree to let her go back to Hogwarts for another year. They decided to stay in Australia for another couple of months to experience being out of the UK and she was happy with it f it meant that she could continue living in the wizarding world. She got off easy compared to Ron and I.
“Well I can certainty see why we’re trying to keep them alive. Who wouldn’t want a pet that can burn, bite and sting all at once?” He mentioned aloud, mostly to himself.
"So you stole them?!" Draco exclaimed, nearly dropping his ice cream. This was just grand, now he'd have to go back and pay double and apologise and there was now a chance of getting banned, and he couldn't get his precious answers from Harry Potter!
He did so for another few hours, but couldn’t quite focus on his work as the birthday list stared at him.
He might find Potter to be all these things, and the realisation might make his heart hurt and his ears throb and his eyes mist and his face burn a bright red but he’ll still keep all of that a secret.
This time the shrieks were paired with cries, as many of the Beauxbaton’s party had begun to cry lightly, though some were sobbing. Octavia caught Draco’s gaze again, as it was directed to a girl on the Ravenclaw table comforting one of these criers. They raised eyebrows at each other in understanding way, one of old friends.
“Yes, right, fixing. And don’t call me Drakey.” He took Pansy’s forearm as she guided him slightly towards the Slytherin dorms.
I think my update schedule is going to be a once a month kind of thing because i am still swamped with school work and am still working on a couple side pieces that wont be out for eons. I hope once a month updates are okay! I try and keep the word count over 7k each chapter! Now on with it!
Draco couldn’t help but feel it was the hardships that made life...life, but he didn’t speak up on that. He only nodded.
“You see, I can’t though. Because you’re threatening to tell someone? Remember?” Potter looked puzzled.
"Holy Hell 'Arry, where's your bird's nest gone?! Are you wearin' a wig?" This caused Dean to laugh harder. I thumped my head on the table again.
“But that’s not grown up enough!” Pansy stamped her feet again. “I want you to be my real boyfriend so you have to kiss me! On the lips!” She told him. He shuffled his feet.
"A vase if you used a shattering charm?" Terry asked. The eagle grumbled a bit before opening up the door. "Thank you Bernie."
Octavia hides back behind the corner and coughs loudly. She makes sure her footsteps echo slightly on the dungeon floor. She hears a swearword and rustling.
She’d known him since they were both five years old. Her mother was making connections with the family and Pansy simply had to come with her to Malfoy Manor. Draco had shown Pansy his room, proudly boasting about his toys and his new plastic broom, and then he played dress up with her.
It had been just over two hours and the kid wasn’t budging in his old vow of silence. Sirius had been trying to interrogate Draco about anything, but his mouth was a steal trap. The only things he would say were about having to torture the information out of him, but Sirius wasn’t in that kind of mood today.
“Well, you were here riding a broom alone at night! What’s your excuse?” He crossed his arms in a terrible attempt to look intimidating. He just looked stupid.
"Just breath Potter, focus on your breathing. I want you to try an breath in for two seconds, and out for two seconds. After that try three. Just keep a steady pace. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth, like this," he demonstrated for me, his voice even and calm, his touch soft like I was a china doll. So I focus on breathing. I tentatively put m hand on his heart in an attempt to mimic his heartbeat, and he thankfully doesn't react to it, other than a flicker of his eyebrow. His mantra about breathing continues in the back of my head as I start to come back to the room. As soon as my breathing resumes normally, I turn to him awkwardly.
“Well you’re gonna have to keep it in your trousers, this isn’t for you.” She turned away and Draco gagged.
Draco copied Narcissa's over protectiveness, being glued to her hip for the week. He was still quite shaken from being blamed for the Dark Mark by Barty Crouch, and Octavia spotted him absentmindedly rubbing at one of his forearms often. It was due to this that she didn't tell him to leave her alone, instead letting him help her with Hogwarts packing.
“I think Theo wanted to pull his hands through my hair, but uh, struggled a bit.” He smiled awkwardly. Draco frowned.
"Whoa!" Draco steadied himself, gripping his book tighter. "What are you doing on the floor?" He asked the crouched figure. The person jumped up alarmed, and turned to face him.
Sirius snorted. “Alright then. Just Draco here was living in Grimmauld Place, a house which he has never left.” Potter’s eyes widened and Draco crossed his arms. When you said it out loud of course it sounded a bit odd.
"It's easy, really. Just a curve of the wrist. You have to have the image of what you want summoned clear in your mind, and then you utter 'Accio'" Draco demonstrated the movement with his own wand. Neville grasped around for the wand in his back pocket and held it with two hands.
. He then free falls, careening downwards and spinning every which way before he grasps the broom with both of his arms and legs again and pulls up before he hits the ground.
"I remember it pretty well since it was my first day of Hogwarts and it was one of the first times I'd stood up for myself. Didn't you blush bright red when you were rejected?" I teased, watching as a blush spread down from high on his cheek bones as he scowled playfully.
They arrived outside the tent, the noises of the campsite loud and proud. Octavia could hear the Irish singing their anthem and smiled.
Sirius sighed and held his nose again, hissing as he realised it was probably broken and had begun to bleed again. Stupid fucking kid.
"Oh really? But I heard that the amazing, incredible, best seeker in the world Viktor Krum was on the Bulgaria team!" She batted her eyelashes, imitating him.
“Language.” Blaise grimaced. “Ew sorry for that, Draco is affecting me. And yes, as far as my gaydar can tell, there is definitely a Potter thing going on.”
"O-o-oh no, I-I'm s-s-so s-s-sorry, I just, I-I-I w-was tr-trying to levit-tate th-the feather a-and I l-lost control I-I'm s-s-so s-so s-sorry I-" Draco stuttered out in fear. Only second lesson and he was already a failure, was what he going to-
"Oh no! Draco, your boyfriend's nose looks pretty bad." Octavia hissed to Draco, causing him to break into an ugly blush.
"Well last night we both decided to let go of our ridiculous rivalry in favour of a truce, and since we're dorming together he got right down to judging my wardrobe, and unfortunately I agree that I need some new stuff, so he's coming with me to Hogsmeade. He doesn't feel like getting recognised though," I gave them both the short explanation. At this point Malfoy started playing with Virgo being wrapped around his hand, looking uncharacteristically awkward.
“Sounds perfect. I’m going to go change clothes. I’ll be back soon.” She blew him a kiss before staggering away to her dorm. He knew he wouldn’t be back soon. She took almost as long as him to get ready. He continued to clean.
He had heard things from Aunt Bella’s mutterings about a great resistance, and how that made every plan they seemed to gather pointless. He already didn’t like this Harry Potter character.
“Draco?” Draco’s eye flickered upwards to meet Vince’s. His breathing was heavy and his left arm hurt.
“She’s a cat. Obviously.” Potter raised an eyebrow. “You better not mention whatever you’re thinking to her unless you want her heel up your arse.” Draco warned the other boy. Potter’s eyes widened slightly in fear. Draco smirked.
He was only walking for 30 seconds before he nearly knocked into someone, a glare of light blue uniform. He looked upwards and saw a girl with thick and curly blonde hair.
“I wasn’t kidnapped!” Sirius used to be sure it was his cousin Trixie, that’s what all the rumours say. But this bloody kid was making him question the oldest stories.
He hesitantly walked in, making it past a couple of house elves to get to a large table where much breakfast food was sat. He saw a group of bottles neatly tucked together, and read the sign they were labelled with.
Something was just missing. He’d been reading his novels for years, and every time the leads kissed something was meant to happen. He was meant to feel butterflies in his stomach, or fireworks going off, or just happiness and warmth down to his core. He was meant to feel safe and excited and- he was getting into cheesy romantic territory. Ugh.
“Is Kreacher not enough?” Aunt Bella shrieked. “Is he not enough of a filthy animal to be around that you want to fill our home with another?” Draco continued to shake his head.
“Great, now I’ll leave a a glass of water by your bedsi-“ Draco wrapped his arms round Blaise’s torso and collapsed onto the bed, his small amount of weight tugging them both down.
Draco flushed. “Right yeah, of course I’m mature. Of course.” He looked round the common room, which was mostly empty. “Did anything bring this on?” He looked quite nervous. Pansy, like an idiot, didn’t notice at the time.
He refuses to let Potter’s hands on his face and his thumb on his cheek have so much control over him.
Sirius clutched his face. “That’s the third time the kid’s hit me in the nose. If it didn’t break the first few times, its definitely broken now.” He hissed in pain and Draco grinned. Sirius deserved it. That’s what kidnappers got. “Could you, Harry?”
"It's not fine Draco, you don't have to stand for this! You should be proud to be a Ravenclaw!" She said encouragingly.
“In the common room it looked like you were getting pretty chummy.” She smirked. “On the sofa.” She watched in delight as his brown complexion managed to take on a slightly red hue.
Draco also picked out some books for school, some to do with advanced Defense Against the Dark Art, which was a surprise, as well as many large hardcovers on fun charms. He told her he wanted to make this year the most fun and interesting for her, and was dedicated to it. She let him go on with it. They both needed a bit of a laugh.
The sign read 'Please keep quiet while in the Ravenclaw library. If you are not Ravenclaw, please leave while you still can'. Underneath the vaguely threatening sign lay a basket with some books inside it. The basket was labelled 'For books that are no longer wanted.' Draco assumed this was the reason the library was so big. Because it could keep filling up.
“We got these half blood siblings get the ‘tely-vision’ and ‘DVDs’, and a couple of older students who are taking muggle studies took care of allowing ‘elek-tree-city’ in Hogwarts. It took a lot of fiddling with the charms and mechanics, parts which I don’t really understand. It’s all very
"What!?" I yelled at him. "No way, you helped me enough, you don't need to pay for anything, this is my wardrobe. Besides, didn't the ministry take a load out of the Malfoy vaults?" I asked, remembering one of the punishments dealt out during the trail.
She found out that she was very good at Transfiguration and History of Magic. As much as the other’s everywhere seemed to harp on about how boring and useless it was, she found it so easy to remember everything, and she immediately took to the books when each topic arose.
Around them thousands of candles bobbed up and down across the hall, giving both a soft and harsh glow at the same time. There were four long tables stretching out, representing each house. Said tables were laid with golden plates and goblets, the candlelight bouncing off of them, causing them all to shimmer.
"The manor? You live in a manor?!" Harry asked, flabbergasted. Draco nodded, keeping his eye out for a free compartment.
“Hush now Draco, let the boy speak.” Pansy tugged Potter towards her with her surprising strength and looped their arms, trapping them on either side.
glad I managed to not humiliate myself. Even with your best efforts Blaise!” The group got up and began walking to the dungeons.
“I’m sure it won’t be. Now shut up, Dumbledore is talking.” She hissed to him with a smile. He gave her a look before craning his neck towards Dumbledore like the rest had.
“What are you doing? If you’re trying to use Occlumency, good luck,” he chuckled nervously. Both Octavia and Draco were trained by none other than Narcissa Malfoy at Occlumency since they were both young children. Pansy smirked.
"Hey, why do they bother with key locks when we can all just Alohomora it open?" He considered this a moment.
"Merlin, it wasn't our idea to waste time having a long chat with a French girl!" Weasley tried arguing before being shut down by Granger.
"Well mine WAS 2 meters above the ground! So at least now you've admitted I'm the best chair lifter!"
"It's easy to get to your dorm in the dungeons, no separate towers or anything. They won't mind if we steal you for a bit." Draco told her, holding her hand to lead her through the students.
“I will be wasting the rest of my day with my books. Whoever thought socialising was a good idea has clearly never experienced a bad Saturday.”
Then Weasley's voice. "Tripped over a tree root." He could see them all now, Weasley, Granger and Potter.
“I can practically see the bigotry emitting from that hand. No thank you.” She rejected him in favour of her reading material. He glowered.
“Well I am grown up!” Pansy sniffed. “Mother says I’m growing up to become a lovely young lady. And lovely young ladies deserve nice boyfriends. And you’re nice.” She poked him on the arm. He stuck out his tongue.
“-the storm never slept, and neither did we! We were all wrapped up in blankets, terrified and cold, when of course my grandma decides that this would be the best time to talk about my aunt Lucille’s recent divorce-“
Fucking stupid relatives always making shit more difficult. Why couldn’t he have been born into a happy and well rounded family? Like literally any other family.
The next day he woke up early. He walked quietly into the kitchen, knowing each and every creaking floorboard to avoid. He didn’t want to risk bothering Aunt Bella if she was in one of her moods. He crept into the kitchen and collected his egg on toast from Kreacher, before bringing it back up to his room.
"Woah, Viktor Krum posters! They're everywhere!" He went closer to one to see how it moved, but all it did was blink and scowl harder. He loved it.
"My parents have been talking about dating boys this year, and they've been hinting towards you," she told him with an apologetic smile. He sighed and returned the smile tiredly.
The ways in which Beauxbatons and Durmstrang got to Hogwarts was truly dramatic, and made Octavia roll her eyes a good couple of times at how easily impressed Danny was.
He eventually made it to the entrance hall and went through a door that led down a staircase. He made it to the basement and walked around the room briefly, trying to find the portrait with a pear in it.
“Yes, but the thing about that is at least I was transfigured back, but no, you will always be a filthy little rodent from a family of the same. Disgusting little-“
"I'm proud to say we were. The immaculate presentation we maintained in the public eye was strangling, so when we had time to ourselves we could really let loose. Our truth or dare games could include stolen Vetiserum from Snape, there were many heists to steal alcohol from the kitchens so that we cold drown our sorrows or celebrate victory. The gossip and the blackmail was always fresh and ready on a silver platter thanks to Pansy, and we had unlimited access to the darkest hexes we wanted thanks to our Mansion's libraries." He said all this with a wistful look in his eye. Wow. I have to admit, I never really imagined much at all going on in the Slytherin dormitories. I thought they just studied or made evil schemes and plots together. I could never have imagined them playing something like truth or dare together, or gossiping away about trivial things.
He looked at Draco strangely, as if trying to work him out. He then grabbed Draco's hand left hand with his right hand, surprising the blonde, and held it tightly. He grinned toothily at Draco. Draco smiled back nervously, and carried on walking with the group. Terry carried on holding his hand.
“Being queer is pretty awful.” She told him, prodding his arm. “You’d be in big trouble if it got out.”
Don't get him wrong, he liked Terry and Anthony and, albeit a little less the loud personality of Michael, but he missed discussing the differences between the muggle world and the wizard one with Hermione. All three Ravenclaw boys were half-blood, so they only knew as much as Draco, probably less. He missed Neville as well, as even though he knew less, he was very interested in Draco as a person. He was actually interested in who Draco was, a thing Draco had never really encountered before. And both of them didn't care if he blabbered on.
“What do you mean?” Potter asked him, still focusing on Draco. Everyone was staring t him. Draco turned down slowly, getting used to being on four limbs, and looked up at Octavia and Blaise. Blaise, for once, was speechless, staring at him in abject horror. Octavia was staring at him with similar horror, with more confusion. He hands twitched towards him, as if she was going to pick him up.
Potter shifted slightly. “The party in Gryffindor was overwhelming. No one believed I hadn’t put my name in, not even Ron.” He shrugged sadly. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco walked out into the hallway and (surprising himself) decides to knock on the side of the open door to the Gryffindor cart.
“Do you like it?” Danny’s voice asked from behind. Martha, who was in a similar position to Octavia, ran over to Danny and shook him slightly.
“You might be the type if I play my cards right. I'll find out by the end of the night.” He winked, causing the audience to squeal a bit.
"Well, we don't know that Father had something to do with this..." he knew he was spitting bullshit and one raised eyebrow showed that so did she. He thought for a moment. "Do you want a piggy back?"
“Finally! Someone believes me!” Potter said happily. His gaze turned towards Draco questioningly. “Um...why are you dressed like that?”
"I mean, I don't really need them at all. I have money left from my parents now as well, so nobody needs to buy me anything."
"I'll see you on the train 1st September! I'll be expecting my answers!" He called before focusing on getting his mother out of there. He squeezed her hand as they flooed back to the manor, ice cream dripping everywhere.
"Yeah, people like Voldemort," Ron spat out. Both Hermione and Malfoy gave him a glare, Malfoy with a bit more venom. He turned back to Hermione.
“You’d better. Being indebted to you feels like torture and I’d rather end it as soon as possible.” With that last word, he turned back to his Skrewt.
At least Granger decided to say something. As infuriating as she was, at least she had common sense. He supposed she had to be logical. Someone had to balance out the Gryffindor house.
"And I'll become Minister of Magic. We'll rule the world together, you and I." They giggled. Draco wasn't sure that he wanted to become Minister, but he knew he wanted to make a good difference.
“Cheers.” Draco retuned. He then cleared his throat and cupped one of his hands round his mouth in order to project over the cheering crowd. “Oi! Blaise! Your alcohol’s here!” And just like that the table was swarmed by a hundred students, all desperate to be rebellious.
“It is Blaise’s choice.” Draco says. Before Pansy can interrupt he carries on. “Theo may be a git, but getting Blaise to see that by yelling about how shit his chosen partner is...probably wasn’t the best approach.”
"Hey, do you guys reckon Malfoy's coming back for Eighth year?" I asked the happy couple, who were so lost in romantic bliss that I almost felt guilty breaking it.
"Hey Draco! I saved you a seat!" Hermione called out to him. Her and Neville were sitting next to each other on a bench near the front, each seat having a feather in front of it. The other two kids were H-Potter and Weasley. Draco blocked them from his view. He walked over to Hermione's table, the Ravenclaw boys trailing behind.
“And I hope you know I do too.” He lumped the body downwards onto a chair and secured it tightly, before systematically tying his arms separately behind the chair, making sure the kid’s hands were free but unable to burn through the ropes. He left the sack on Draco’s head and snorted slightly. That’s what he gets.
“Well, um, thank you. You look older as well.” Draco smiled up at the star quidditch player with well hidden glee. Viktor smiled back.
“We did! It was all incroyablement effrayant!” She waved some more Beauxbatons girls over to her. “Filles,  c'est le gentil garçon! Ze one I told you all about, from ze Cup!” Immediately many French girls surrounded him, clucking and pecking at him.
"Hello Dobby, please may you clean away the remaining cakes and return this umbrella to the ugly gnome stand." Draco bent down to hand the elf the black umbrella.
So really, Draco absolutely does not have a crush on that speccy, green eyed, messy haired tosser! And he will never have a crush on him!
“Are you going to back out? Now that you’re at the entrance of the lair?” He smirked teasingly. Potter took this seriously and glanced at the snake. He nodded hesitantly and Draco grinned.
"Well then, you didn't think to-" The Professor was interrupted by a sudden howl. Draco looked over to see a Hufflepuff girl shaking violently in pain next to an extremely concerned Michael.
"Oh, I'm sorry sweetheart, but how old are you again?" Narcissa asked Draco while she mixed the ingredients together. Draco's shoulder's slumped slightly. She'd been the only one at his party scarcely a month ago. And she'd already forgotten.
“Just shut up! Fine, you got me, tonight I hung out on the Quidditch pitch with someone. It was a boy, shut up Blaise, and there was no romantic involvement.” Draco admits, crossing his arms and attempting to become one with the chair.
“It’s probably just because he’s your favourite celebrity and you don’t like Granger.” She shrugs the situation off. “You probably came off as really mature and cool to leave them be. Like a great friend to Krum.” She tried to make him feel better.
"I, uh, suppose I am. Do you know anything about it?" Ah. So the scrawny boy was a muggleborn then. Must be a shock for him. Draco stared at the boy curiously. A source of new information.
Draco looked over to Potter, making eye contact with said boy. Draco looked away quickly and looked back through his Omnioculars at the game, his ears going pink instead. Octavia looked back to Potter to see a bewildered boy staring at her brother. She interrupted his staring by giving him a wave, causing him to flush and look back to the game.
In the end when I looked at the pile of clothing I'd collected, and then at my wallet, I came to a stark realisation.
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder, and the doors of the Great Hall opened.
“Ah, shit!” Harry exclaimed quietly as the cat scratched him to get out of his hold. “Worse than Crookshanks.” He muttered.
He cast Episkey on his split lip and Reparifors on his left leg. Both seemed to heal quite nicely, but that left the bruise. It wasn’t often she left bruises, it was usually simple cuts. She didn’t often slap him either, so it must have been a particularly awful thing he’d said.
"Uh, I learnt I was magic today, so I haven't had that much time to adjust. Um...I guess some accidental magic happened, but I didn't know it was accidental magic. I just thought it was because natural disasters or birth defects. Hagrid, the Hogwarts games keeper, told me I was magic. He's with me now. They, um, sent me a letter saying I'd been accepted into Hogwarts? So I really want to go. I don't know about the next question because I don't know about international anything? I didn't need to convert muggle money into galleons because my parents left me some magic money to use. Hagrid was actually the first wizard I met, but you're the first wizard around my age who I've met. At least, I think you're around my age...you're not an elf or something, are you? And definitely 10 out of 10! The magical world is so interesting! And I've only seen Digon Alley!" He finished in quick procession. Impressive.
"I love Herbology! As I said before, I'm a bit of an expert." Michael popped an imaginary collar. "I know my stuff."
“I’m still convinced you cheated.” Vince mentioned sourly, being the one to lose the most chocolate frogs.
"I am Meredith Stewart, and  will be your prefect this year. You will follow me up to the Ravenclaw tower where your luggage will be. You will be separated into girls and boys, and will get to pick out your dorms if you are friends with anyone. And let this be a warning, if you can't sort this out between yourselves I will get you a dormitory plan and no one will get to be in a dorm with their new friends! Got it?" She gave them all  look. It was a rather frightening look. At the students' collective nods, she smiled brightly again. "Great! Now let this be known that we are all a family in Ravenclaw, and we treat each other with respect. I don't care if she pulled your pigtails or he threw your book, save the animosity for being better than the other houses, and getting the house cup!" Some of the first years smiled at this. "Now follow me, and watch your steps on the staircases!" She turned around and all 15 students followed in her trail.
Thank you so much for your support, you comments literally mean the world to me and every time I hear your feedback I get so much happy chemical! Be sure to give a kudo, comment and a bookmark to kept updated because my update schedule in yikes.
“Damn it, I forgot about the eyes. A vampire’s are supposed to be a soulless black. I wonder if there’s a charm...”
She went in a boat with three others, two boys and a girl. There was a muggleborn boy called Danny Keett, and a pair of half blood twins, Martha Robinson and Felix Robinson.  She ignored them for the most part, and kept up a standoffish front. She could make friends later, once her house was sorted.
There was a pitter pattering of feet and the sound of a door opening and closing. Draco kept his face in his knees, his hands outstretched before him.
Draco's shoulders raised. "M-M-Meredith, you r-really don't h-have t-to, it's f-fine." She looked at him sharply.
“They’re down there already, catching up on some notes and practicing. You know how they are.” He nodded.
He opened up The Sorting Ceremony's Sanctity to the first page and began reading. It had a lot of repetition from the last book, on the origins and house traits and whatnot, but soon began to get onto the topic Draco needed. By the 44th page Draco had found what he was looking for, the sacred chapter on possible sorting hat mistakes. His eyelids were heavy but he still turned the page. He needed to get into Slytherin. Just one more page. Just one more...
“Malfoy, I have a proposition for you.” Potter interrupts his thoughts and if only Blaise could of heard him say that.
"What happened to the Hufflepuff girl?" Neville asked them, a bit more sad after his Herbology buddy had gone. After Anthony explained the situation angrily, Neville turned white. "Professor Snape really took points away from her while she was in pain?"
Draco Malfoy was a very pureblood person. As pureblood as you could get. As they’d joked plenty of times, if you went through his family tree it began to look more like a bush. It was a miracle he was the way he was.
He was also trapped for all of his life! But not in a tower...and his hair wasn’t magic...he was instead?
The kid was holding onto the pillow tightly, and Sirius saw it gently begin to transfigure into...a cat? Draco smiled at it and stroked it’s head the best he could with his awkward arms. He picked up the ugly pink cat and stood back up, staring Sirius down.
“We do make sense. A lot. And I do think you look really pretty and fun and I love you a lot, but I can’t imagine dating you. And it isn’t that I’m not ready, because...I can imagine dating Blaise.” He blushed brightly. “Not that I’d want to! Its just that if I were going to! All hypothetical!”
"Cool! Have a good, uh, break! Come on Ron, didn't you want to show me something in the lake?" His smiled returns. So does Weasley's (unfortunately).
“What the fresh fuck is wrong with you?!” Sirius roared, causing Draco to clutch Cushion a bit tighter. The cat mewed. “How to hell did you get your wand back?!” He abandoned his shoes which were still stuck to the floor and walked over to the bubble, pounding on it a bit. The magic wavered, but stayed strong under pressure.
"Oh I'll show you what my thing is! Wingardium Leviosa!" She sent a hardback flying into Anthony's chest. He landed on his back with an audible 'oof'.
He picked out two large books from under his mattress. One was an extensive reading on astronomy, astrology, mythology and legends, a 1st edition. It was his mother's favourite. She loved his name and how he was named  after a constellation. She made learning about his family fun, because when talking about them he'd get to learn about their name and origins.
Halfway through the lesson, the cauldron began to make a sizzling noise as the horned slugs were added. Draco thought it quite nice, but apparently Terry disagreed.
“It’s a girl. And this-“ he pointed upwards, referencing the music, “is Michael Jackson! AKA me!” He shimmied his shoulders. “Billie Jean- is not my lover! She’s just a gi-irl, who thinks that I- am the one!” He sung out slightly off-key. He continued to dance like a dork while Draco watched. After the song fazed out, another one began, starting with some rhythmic drumming and weird noises. It had really aggressive singing. So of course Blaise loved it.
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has it's own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn you house points, while your rule breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours." Draco hoped so too.
“So...can we use your button presser ‘Mione?” Potter asked the young witch nervously. She folded her book and put it aside.
“Hey little Octi! Looking spooky!” Greg came over to her dressed in a fake Ballycastle Bats quidditch team uniform. She rolled her eyes.
Malfoy smirked. "The ministry may have rooted through the Malfoy vaults, but they didn't go through mine." At my probably bewildered look, he began to explain, using his hands to gesture wildly as he went. "The summer after first year, Lucius was getting angry at me, not only for being beaten for seeker by Mister Harry Potter, but for coming second in the year to a Mud- to a Muggleborn." I smiled at his correction. "It was at this time that I feared a chance of being disowned. So I lettered Gringotts and asked for a new, secret vault to be opened under the name "Tom Richardson". Every month, an couple thousand Galleons would be filtered into Tom's vault from the Malfoy vault, enough for me to be safe and get by, but small enough to be undetected in the grand scheme of things. I'd thought that my disowning would happen sooner, but since it didn't the vault has ended up gaining about 250 thousand Galleons from the Malfoy vault." I gaped at him. "So Potter, in conclusion, I think that if I can afford to send my mother to France, I can afford to pay for your new wardrobe."
All my readers mean the world to me and any comments or support just makes my day and lifts my spirits to heaven! Thank you all!
"You will organise yourselves into pairs and will prepare a simple potion to cure boils; Mendaron. Please get out your textbooks and go to page 5. The instructions will also be written on the board." He explained. "The ingredients and tools are in the cupboard to the left. Do not spill anything or there will be consequences." And they all got to work.
"You still haven't explained this to me, what is a film?" Malfoy asked confusedly, gathering our empty mugs to put in the kitchen sink.
A louder bang sounded from outside the trees, causing many people to scream, and more to jump. Octavia hid her face in the hood of Draco's cloak and Draco grimaced.
He was WORTHLESS. He was NOTHING. He was STUPID and IGNORANT and DISAPPOINTING and DISRESPECTFUL and REPULSIVE. He was lucky to be born a Malfoy, but none of that matters now. He was a RAVENCLAW. It hadn't quite sunk in yet, but with his face tucked into his knees and a ringing in his ears, he felt hopeless. Even if he could swap houses, the damage was done. His father still wouldn't love him. He just wanted to make him proud.
Little to their knowledge, Bellatrix had taken the Malfoy child to the hidden and ward protected Grimmauld Place, a home of the Blacks. No one else could enter, and no one could exit. Impenetrable. Protected.
New game! Take a shot every time Draco calls something stupid! (Jk I not want you to get alcohol poisoning).
Well, it wouldn't be that bad to look like Malfoy. He's a sort of attractive bloke. In a pretty sort of way.
“Well that is even more adorable, childhood friends turned partners. How sweet, right out of a romance novel.” Pansy nodded with Potter’s assessment while smiling.
"Master Lucius is looking for Master Draco, and has sent Dim to call for him. Master Lucius would like Master Draco to meet him in the third floor drawing room please sir." She saluted.
Draco lurched, his right hand beginning to move and follow the voice’s orders. Roll up your left sleeve...
Draco priest himself away from Vince and coughs. “Anyway, I wholeheartedly think that you should dance with Greg. 100%. Tear him away from Pansy if you have to! Your costumes are the ones that match anyway!” He tells Vince, encouraging him and feeling like a right Cupid.
“So this is my hair curler, all natural, so we can style and twist our hair to look absolutely stunning!”
"We'll see you then. Come on Harry," he tried to be confident as he led them across the Platform. Around them cats crawled and hissed at their feet while Owls hooted at one another. Draco tried to keep a targeted mind to keep himself from getting lost in the euphoria that was going to Hogwarts.
okay this has basically turned into me appreciating you guys so I'll see you in the next chapter, remember to share your thoughts and input because i care about what you think okay bye
He guided his mother to her room, where she lay on top of the covers face up. She fell asleep within a minute of laying down.
And he was supposed to date her. Or at least pretend to. He’d gotten a letter from his mother that Sunday about the arrangement. She was kinder about it all than Mrs Parkinson probably would have been, not treating it like an engagement, but merely a form of socialisation, almost practice. The way she had phrased it around his unfamiliarity with courtship was a bit embarrassing, but he accepted the letter. He would pretend to court Pansy properly.
Near the end of the week, the Malfoy children begged their mother on their hands and knees to be able to go to Diagon Alley to get Octavia her wand in person, as well as the dress robes Draco needed for this year, With great reluctance, she allowed them, giving them a time limit of two hours.
After Blaise, the next guinea pig was Lavender Brown, who after a couple of seconds, ended up imitating a squirrel, much to everyone’s amusement. Then Moody turned to Draco.
Martha began digging through her trunk. “Like a makeover! To style our hair real pretty, or to put on a bit of classy makeup. To style our uniforms! A makeover always cheers me up, and I’ve gotten real good at using a hair curler!” She pulled out a funny looking contraption. Octavia pulled away from it slightly.
"Anything to do with the chosen one would. You could try selling his backwash and there'd still be some poor sod who'd pay every galleon."
“-Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me.” Moody broke him out of his inner ramblings. He glanced over to where Moody was standing. Right in front of Potter.
“Ummmm I don’t think I’m the best person to answer that-“ his awkward answer was interrupted by another loud sob coming from Blaise. “Okay okay stop! I guess...you are objectively attractive? Hmm?” Potter offered pathetically.
Books were his true love. Whether fact or fiction, something was always gained from a book. Because of Rule Number 13, he'd had plenty of experience not talking. Books were a sign of being educated. One of the only things allowed. They let his 'flights of fancy' fly free, let his imagination run wild, let his mind be challenged. He was almost fluent in both Latin and French as well as English. His goal was to learn Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian by the time he was 25.
“It’s doesn’t matter, you addiction to sugar can wait.” She walked beside him to the dorms. “Why the gloomy face?”
“It isn’t just a ‘swear’, you- you- you-!” Granger began to fill with rage, her hair seeming to frizz up even more. Draco tried not to snort at the funny picture she made. “It’s a slur. A filthy awful slur that tries to demean muggleborns purely based on their blood status , which is completely arbitrary since we can both do magic just fine!” She scolded him.
“I prefer to affiliate myself with Slytherins, Ravenclaws if I must.” Draco said with an air of pompousness. Viktor only tilted his head.
Draco could faintly hear the Weasel and Granger talking one cart over and remembered something he promised himself he'd do. He sighed loudly and said "I'll be back, I just have to say something to Potter." At that the entire group groaned in unison.
I woke up to clear vision, and in my sleep inebriated state, I thought that I'd regained my vision completely. Then I realized I was wearing my glasses and the illusion of being healed was shattered, giving me a disappointing start to my day.
Everyone’s always going on about his green eyes, and how they look like his mothers’, or how they sparkle like emeralds or some other nonsense. Doesn’t anyone know colours?! His eyes obviously resemble more of shamrock or parakeet shade than emerald, and in a darker light they take on more of a basil or pine tone. All which are not *emerald* or what everyone says.
That would explained why he was feeling so drained. But he didn’t have time to be tired. He had to be above his game if he was going to escape this crazy Dark Lord Rebel. He smirked to himself slightly when he thought of how he both punched and kicked that stupid second cousin of his in the face.
“Yes, I have no choice but to invite you along because you might tell someone. Now help me with these bottles, my arms are beginning to hurt.”
"Potter, that vault you saw  was probably only your trust fund. You most likely have multiple far larger ones, to do with products the Potters created, or families they might have married into, not even including the Peverell fortune they inherited. Fleamont Potter, your paternal grandfather, started up various companies, and amongst them was Sleekeazy's Hair Care and Scalp Treament, which quadrupled the Potter wealth before he sold the business, thus tripling your family fortune yet again. Although, the Potters were very honest and kind in their businesses, so they didn't earn as much as they could have, and were subsequently poorer than the Malfoys.
“It was actually a great party.” Blaise corrected. “Right Theo?” He asked the boy sat next to him with exactly no subtlety. Theo shrugged noncommittally, refusing to look Blaise in the eyes.
“No swearing.” He mentions. “And...I get it. I was being pretty nosy. I’m just concerned.” He explained. She bundled him to the side and sat next to him on the chair.
I suppose I could ask McGonagall for another room, but I didn't really feel like whining unnecessarily to her, especially since she already had a lot on her plate trying to restart Hogwarts after all that has happened. I considered charming another room for three people, but then I remembered that most people were coupling up, and I internally grimaced at the thought of having to either endure the sexual tension, or trying to sleep while they shag. I sighed in resignation as I realised that my best option was just staying with Malfoy.
“-so it turns out muggle products are far better for your skin, so I took a load with me! Would you like to do some makeovers?” Martha asked Octavia. Octavia was about to agree until she spotted Draco in a chair in the common room.
"I had History of Magic. The teacher is a ghost!" She looked bewildered. "He has quite a droning and monotone voice, it makes it quite difficult to want to listen."
"Malfoy!" Potter and Granger repeated louder while Weasley sounded like he was having an asthma attack.
Draco desperately wanted to get Sirius, but he couldn’t cast outside of the bubble charm. He'd better let his magic rest anyway, it was already being strained slightly by the shield.
I picked up a lock of my hair to check if it would reflect in the mirror. It did. So that's my hair?
“You’d think it, wouldn’t you?!” Potter exclaimed and sighed. “I have no idea why he’s acting like an arse about it.” He complained defeatedly.
“Drakey!” To the left of him, Pansy called to him. When he looked at her, she smirked and put one hand on her waist, the other hand gesturing for him to come towards her. He did so.
"Exactly Potter, the hair has to be handled. I say we go to Dervish and Banges for some Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, that bothersome barnet needs to be taken care of ASAP." I nodded along with this. "I'm also thinking we need to get you some Ursula's Facial Care; for spots and pores alike." I could feel my face heat up a little as Malfoy continued with the list. I brushed a hand gently over the top of my hairline where I had a couple of semi-noticeable spots, before Malfoy grabbed my hand and dragged it onto the table.
"Fine." He spat out. He was too tired for this. "If it's okay with them." He spoke through gritted teeth, adjusting Octavia on his back. The trio exchanged glances with each other, Weasley looking to detest the idea.
“Because it is the way things should be. I know you like me a bit, you’ve kissed me before!” She tells him. “And Posy says that we’d make a great couple, and Mother says that you’d make a good husband, and I think you’d be a good boyfriend, so why can’t you see? We make sense together.” She implored him. Draco shut his eyes.
Potter had the distinct look on his face of one who didn’t often get ideas, getting an idea. Draco scowled and began to think of all the hexes he could perform without doing permanent damage to Potters face.
Pansy scrunched her nose at the nickname. “Since you’re sooooo talented and amazing at everything and good at magic-“
“I’m smoking hot. Breathtaking even. When I’m older I could be the highest class prostitute, but I won’t. It’ll be a great loss for the sex work community worldwide. Highly mourned.”
“It’s my mother’s side of the family. The Black family is and always has been a French one. Not only that, but the Malfoy family has french roots.” He explained boredly.
Blaise Zabini is an asshole but he’s also a massive problem. He is also the holy shipper and causes commotion exclusively. The casual flirty tone with all of his interactions is inspired by real life shit heads that go to my school and mess with everyone.
“Who’s there?” He tried to ask in his confident voice. No answer. He glared at the shoe that peeked round the cobble. “If you don’t show yourself now, I will curse you, I will.” He tried to threaten. No answer. Draco sighed and stared some more at the shoe, trying to recognise. It was incredibly scuffed, ad it looked pretty muggle-made. The laces were in tatters, and the left side was falling off. He wondered who it belonged-
He was invested in the drama of the book, how the leads had once again reunited after being apart for so long. Their parents disapproved, but they rebelled regardless to be with each other.
Once I made it into the Great Hall I nearly made my way over to the Gryffindor table, before remembering the new Eighth year table. I walked over to it and scanned it for anyone to sit next to. I could see Seamus and Dean, wo were thankfully not being too lovey dovey, Seamus nearly falling asleep on Dean's lap, so I deemed it un-romantic enough not to be a third wheel. Once I sat down next to Dean, he turned to greet me.
“Potter, do you think I’m hot?” Blaise asked tearfully. You could see the moment Potter’s brain stuttered in his eyes.
“I don’t agree with your use of swear words, but I do agree with your assessment of Blaise.” Draco noted grumpily, writing another rapid fire sentence on his parchment.
“As sad and lonely as that it, it doesn’t answer my question of why you’re here. Outside the kitchens. Just where I happen to be.” His eyes widened. “Were you stalking me?”
“Looks like you have nothing to lose then. Come on, we don’t have to be “Bestest Friends’ or whatever,” Draco grimaced, “but we just won’t be arch rivals anymore.” Draco bit his lip in thought. “Come on. Truce?”
“I’m glad to see you’ve matured in your handling of an injury since last year.” Draco flushed at nodded, leading the other two outside.
"Move along now," a sharp voice cut in. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start." The flying Duke frowned at the interruption, but floated after the other ghosts into the hall. "Now form a line," McGonagall instructed, "and follow me."
"Do you mind if I ask what's going on with your mum? I mean- obviously I don't believe what Ron said on the train, but I saw her in Diagon Alley and it just...it looked more like you were the parent." Harry looked at him imploringly, begging him to answer.
Draco then cast a shield around himself, and using the blood from Sirius’ punch, he casts a quick dark blood spell to enforce the shield. He spits more blood on the floor and swipes it in a circle around him, creating a powerful bubble shield, and trapped Cushion in there with him too.
“I mean, at least he has a more open look to experimenting with dark magic? It is a large field that Hogwarts doesn’t even try to elaborate on.” Blaise pointed out to try soften Draco’s scowl.
“Nah, I’ve been playing cards since I was five. I inherited a really nice set after Grandfather Abraxas kicked the bucket, but I was never supposed to play with them. Decoration only, father said. So I asked the Manor’s portraits to teach me how and forced the house elves to learn how to play too, so I could have some regular practice. I am 80% sure that I accidentally started a gambling night amongst the house elves for who gets which chore to do.” Draco explained while fitting on his other shoe. He took a hand through his hair and looked to Blaise.
“I don’t see what the problem is in people thinking you got some last night.” Blaise said, smirking.
“Probably. You’re the one who wanted to come anyway.” He pointed at the raven haired boy. Said boy grimaced and took a sip of his drink.
“Aww, Drakey you seem tense.” Pansy distracted him from his thoughts by popping herself down on his lap, sidesaddle.
"There is no way I am going to be able to pay. I only have 15 Galleons in total, and I was planning on buying lunch."
As they began brainstorming where it could be, Draco whispered to Octavia. "The supposed greatest wizard in Britain. Behold him, in all his clumsiness," and Octavia began giggling.
“To be a kidnapper I’d have to take you to a secondary location-“ he stopped. He grinned. “Which is not a bad idea.”
"Oh! So you're of Hogwarts age aren't you! When are you going? Have you got all of you're things? Will I go to Hogwarts as well?" And with that last question, the illusion of a normal adult was broken. Draco forced out a chuckle.
Draco looked up to the sky above and his stomach dropped. He heard Octavia mutter behind him "shit," but he didn't tell her off for language this time.
“I will see you later! And when I do, you better be on the arm of the stud Gregory Goyle!” Draco yelled as the other boy re-entered the party. He stood up and brushed himself off but stayed to lean against the wall. Eventually some wizarding musicians began to play, and with more children knowing these, more began to sing and dance.
People are getting ready for the first day of school. Not a lot happens, just messing about and the characters existing.
“In the smallest bedroom, under the mattress, there are some muggle books. Inside them it says Sirius Black.” Draco mumbled and the intru-
"Okay guys, let's just go to class early. If they're late just tell your teacher Draco got a...what do you call it, howl-thing? Say he'll be late for class. Neville and I will handle Harry. Leave them be." The same voice told the group. The set of hands round his gripped on slightly tighter.
"Via, it's Krum!" Draco poked at her shoulder as if she didn't see the same thing he did, while focusing on him with his Omnioculars. The Weasley boy said something similar to his friend Potter, all starstruck with the seeker.
: but he stopped himself. He thought about the muggleborns who hid in Slytherin but brought out such interesting muggle inventions during the party. He thought of his own family’s twisted family tree to stay pureblooded. And then he though of Granger.
Currently many of the older kids had either passed out on random furniture, or had returned to their dorms in pairs. Draco grimaced to think of what they were doing.
“That’s all? Because in the rumours I heard, Blaise punched Weasley in the face, which caused a big fight where Draco and Potter had to pull the boys off of each other, leading to Potter insulting Draco, and Draco casting Meltifo Impertinsa on him. Then Moody stepped in and transfigured you all into a different animal, before Octavia threatened to kill him.” She explained as Octavia’s eyes widened.
He figured the best way to clean up would be by collecting the rubbish together in plastic bags and then charming away the bags so there’d be less items to rid off and waste magic on.
Once Cedric exited the room into the chamber and the ruckus had calmed down, Dumbledore looked ready to speak again.
“I am standing right here.” He reminded them, feeling ignored. He sat down with Potter at the table.
“No, not there.” She turned her head round the corner again. Blaise was grinning nervously up at Theo while grabbing the other boy’s hand. “Not yet.”
He started with the alcohol bottles, the most important items to rid the evidence of, and collected them all in a bag, the shattering noise of the glass causing some in the room to wake and groan. He didn’t care. After they were all in a bag he charmed the bag away, to a void he guessed, and got out another bag.
He sighed a long suffering sigh, before digging into his satchel for a pouch. He began pouring some Galleons into his palm.
“Good work. Malfoy here resisted the Imperius Curse. He put up quite a fight.” Draco’s hands were shaking. The robotic eye was trapped on him again. “Fantastic work lass.”
Potter lay his hand gently on Draco’s face, cupping his cheeks softly. Draco blinked through the blur dumbly as the boy caressed one cheek with a calloused thumb
“I dunno.” He hiccuped through a laugh. “I got the giggles.” He swatted at Blaise’s broad as ever chest. Blaise seemed to come his senses at that.
“Sure. When it’s with homework or quidditch. But you’d not actually hang out with them without the group to coddle your inept social abilities.” Blaise put a finger over Draco’s mouth to shush his protests. “They were almost like your bodyguards for so long and now that you’ve given them time to become themselves, you aren’t friends. You haven’t tried to get to know Greg and Vince instead of ‘Crabbe and Goyle’, and they’re trying!” Blaise continues to shush him. “You never have time for them outside of tutoring, but now that I’m going to be helping your with that, I expect you to be nice to our boys.” He pulled out the extremely sad face. “Do it for the children.” He began to whisper. “Do it for lil Octi.”
), and a large wooden panel they called an ‘Oo-wee-jee board’. It was apparently used to summon evil spirits, and was incredibly popular, but the siblings banned it from being used before Halloween. It would ‘spoil the mood’. They were even more excited when Draco announced that he supposed they could use all of these items for the Halloween party he was arranging on the 31st.
Hermione keeps trying to get me to see a mind healer, but I’ve had enough people in my mind thank you very much!
I'm still trynna get my life together, but thank you to all those who have been patiently waiting for this story <3
“Are you going to listen to what I have to say?” Theo’s face is as impassive as it’s always been and Draco squints his eyes – hopes that perhaps, if he stares hard enough, he’ll see the emotion Theo himself is unattuned to.
Onto the mindfuck that is grey morality. I’m almost sold, I just don’t like it to be frank. I hate that it leaves us open to selfishness, that if fed, has us hurt others. What if we blur the lines too much, and leave people open to freely hurt others if it’s in the defense of something bigger? Or, would that be the bit that makes them morally grey, yes?
I think conflict is something we all face in our relationships and I think the best reflection of our character is when we are flawed, when we address our mistakes, and we have people who are there for us when we make mistakes and help hold us accountable.
“Right,” Malfoy scoffs, throwing back the duvet. “Come on, Potter, fancy a smoke?” Leaning down Malfoy goes to grab at his little tin box fit with his pre-rolled spliffs and a lighter.
“Yeah, I’m his roommate not his fucking keeper.” Harry can’t look at her, displeasure clear in his voice. He shakes his leg harder.
They find a quick-paced, delectable rhythm after that. Harry alternates between harsh, shallow thrusts and hard, deep, slow thrusts that have Draco writhing underneath him.
Parkinson rolls her eyes, holds her hand out for the bottle in Harry’s grasp. He hands it to her, licking his lips as he does so.
Draco clicks his tongue. “Just be grateful it wasn’t in my desk drawer or something, I’d have to get up for that.”
Draco grinds into him with one particularly hard thrust that has Harry’s head rolling back, gasping and huffing out heavy breaths of air. He turns his head to the right, humming in pleasure when he notices it.
CW: Draco references suicide in a sort of joking kind of way, which is not a healthy coping mechanism, by the way. Take care of yourselves babes <3
,” Draco moans, when Harry hits that sweet spot inside him. Draco’s practically mewling from the pleasure of it. “Oh fuck, Harry!”
“Kiss me,” Harry commands, still laying on the floor. Draco doesn’t hesitate to join him, hovering above him, letting Harry wrap his arms around his neck and drag him down to crash their lips together. Their teeth knock together, not that either of them minds and Harry ruts enthusiastically up into Draco.
Malfoy smirks down at him, letting out a dry huff of air that Harry supposes is meant to be a laugh. “Never pegged you as the type, is all.”
Harry moves to tease Draco’s rim, eyes on the other man’s face still, watching as his lower lip quivers, as his mouth falls steadily open. Harry slides his finger in, just the tip, head spinning at the sound of Draco’s soft moan. Harry drags his finger in, curling it gently, earning a gasp, before dragging his finger out to the tip – pace still tortiously slow.
The second time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, its sixth year and he’s dreaming. He’s rapidly become obsessed with Malfoy, has been watching him, following him like a hawk might stalk their prey. He knows, just
, he’s absolutely ready and Draco’s muttering something else. Probably a protection charm and then he’s slipping his fingers out of Harry making him groan before lining up his cock against Harry’s rim, slowly teasing his hole, precome dribbling down onto Harry and the sheets as he does so.
want to fuck you.” Draco’s hand palms at Harry’s cock through his pyjama bottoms, making Harry’s eyes roll back.
,” he moans out and at the sound of the other man’s whimper he says the name like it’s a prayer over and over again.
“Can I?” Harry asks, reaching out, desperate to hug him, desperate to take his hurt away, to comfort him, to love him.
“Of course,” Harry says, reaching out his hand, waiting for Draco to lean into it like he is wont to do nowadays. “Thank you for trusting me.”
“No, no it’s –” Harry doesn’t know what to say, and he pauses in search of the right words like a man lost at sea. “Are you alright?”
Their clothes come off, it’s hard to keep track of how when all Harry cares to stay focused on is the growing heat in his body and the ice-cold feel of Draco’s hard lines against his own.
Harry doesn’t see Draco for a whole month after graduation. Draco, on the cusp of nineteen, is untraceable. Harry struggles with the urge to search for him, to find him if only to shake him from the shoulders and ask what’s wrong.
Tight grip on Draco’s thigh, so tight he’s sure it’ll bruise, Harry thrusts harshly into Draco’s hole, the sound of Draco’s rapid breathing and pleasured moans, mixing with the slap of their bodies, with low groans that escape the back of Harry’s throat — with his whispered
“Not the kind of man who can give me the opinion I truly need.” Parkinson says, turning to Malfoy’s bed. She picks up two skimpy looking outfits one red and one black, both made of leather. “Which one is sluttier, Potter?”
Draco licks his lips, dragging his tongue slowly across his bottom lip. “One day – one day, I won’t get so sick when I try to put it into words –” Draco sniffs. “– one day, I’ll own it and I’ll tell you all about it. One day, you’ll know you are more than enough.” His eyes water and he blinks rapidly.
Harry freezes, blinks rapidly, swallows a lump in his throat. “You know what I mean, right? Please tell me you do.”
Ginny was possessed by Riddle for a year, so she can understand where I’m coming from. She’s been defending me against Hermione’s insistent pushing. Don’t get me wrong, I really do appreciate her for wanting to make sure I’m doing alright, but I wish she’d let this go.
Harry’s lips find his, a tentative push of the head, a small lean towards something new. Draco meets him, and suddenly there is heat and warmth and desire bleeding through his reservation. Draco moves his arms, holds onto Harry, pulls him close.
“Mr. Potter that is a very serious accusation, one of which will land Mr. Malfoy back in Azkaban. Are you saying you haven't partaken in the use of any of the drugs before you?”
Malfoy’s there in the room, smoking a cigarette of all things. He’s sitting on the cobblestone sill with the window pushed partially open, exhaling smoke into the cool night air. When Harry enters, Malfoy turns, sniffs, and says, “You’re not going to throw a fit over this are you?”
“Someone has to,” Luna chimes, taking the meat out of her satchel and throwing it towards the Thestral before her. It opens its wings wide before them, chewing at the meat eagerly.
Draco unclasps the little vial, pours oil onto his hand and slowly, and tentatively rubs at Harry’s rim. Just on the outside, obviously testing the waters.
Something simmers deep within Harry as heat begins to pool beneath his abdomen. Draco takes a piece of chocolate, shifts his weight onto his elbow, lifting the oval shaped treat up to Harry’s mouth. He lets Draco put the chocolate on his tongue, watches as he moves his fingers into his own mouth, sucking away the residual sweetness, lifting his eyebrows at Harry, eyes glimmering with a familiar mischief. They chat idly about their days like this, sharing kisses in between the gifting of chocolate with fingertips pressed to one another’s lips.
That night, with his cheeks red with drink, Draco sits next to Harry on the couch, sharp grey eyes glazed over as he stares into Harry’s green ones.
Draco doesn’t want Harry to let on if he feels nervous and even though his hands tremble with emotion, he moves to kiss at the scars, licking at them, trailing down his chest, the way he might have if they had been having sex the whole time, the way he never has before.
He wakes up in a cold sweat, tells himself this is what happens to someone who represses the fuck out of their sexuality, his brain is desperate for the truth to reach the surface and somewhere along the way some wires have gotten unholy crossed. He tries desperately to uncross them, is unsuccessful, pulls out the Marauders Map anyway and follow Draco’s dot. Fuming and uncomfortable the entire time he does so.
It’s not that Harry’s ever really cared much about his social status, people are fickle with their opinions and always will be, but the part that made Harry feel good was that the reason they thought he was cool had nothing to do with him being some sort of almighty saviour and everything to do with his ability to chug down three-fourths of a bottle of Firewhiskey without issue.
“Muggle studies.” Malfoy shrugs. “It’s so fucking boring,” he says, throwing the book out in front of him. The pages make a noise as the novel falls down onto the floor with a soft thud, turned down and still partially open.
After Draco leaves without a word or a sound, Harry finally lets the tears that burn him up from the inside out fall. Harry wishes he could take away this hurt, that he could kill it where it began. Yet, there is only the heavy weight of the truth and the importance of choice.
“Harry, still, I mean he’s. Well,” Hermione cuts herself off, eyes shifting around her. “People have been saying things about him.”
I’m pants at advice about this stuff normally, but it’s what I would do if I was in front of the bloke I really liked.
Draco’s grey-rimmed hues shine with something bright, like there’s a joke Harry’s not in on. He leans in close, kissing Harry right under his ear and whispering, “Are you scared? Is that it?”
It’s abrupt, unlike anything he’s ever experienced with Malfoy – he is as sharp as a knife, as prickly as a cactus and Harry wishes he could stay in the warmth of his softness for longer than the minutes he’s allotted after sex.
Enclosed you’ll find your wand. The one used to defeat Voldemort, by the way. Ironic, isn’t it? The wand used to defeat Voldemort came from one of his cowardly followers.
“I can’t imagine why muggles would torture themselves on those electrical devices,” Draco says, stretching, wiggling socked his foot against Harry’s thigh.
Draco really packs a fucking punch. It knocks Harry off the bed. He feels a metallic sting flooding his mouth. He laughs, choking on spit and blood. It’s the best he’s felt in a long while.
The silence that follows is tense, deafening even, and they move to pick up the cards recently dealt for their game, watching each other cautiously as they do so.
“Why didn’t you just say sorry?” Harry’s voice softens. “When I brought up how you,” he pauses. “When I brought up how you used to make fun of me. For being an orphan.”
“Me too,” Harry whispers, against Draco’s ear, against that fucking silver earring that’s been teasing him for years. “I want you too.”
Draco is kissing and sucking down Harry’s neck, biting hard and earning soft moans in reward. Fuck, Harry never knew he could like this kind of stuff this much. Maybe it’s the drugs, maybe it’s Malfoy, maybe it’s the fact that Harry’s always been curious about what it’d be like with another man and now he’s about to find out.
The air grows heavy under the weight of Harry’s words, and Harry hates that it’s the last thing he wants. Maybe something is wrong with Harry, maybe he himself is poisoned and has poisoned Draco. It’s not even about the sex, it’s about the fact that Harry won’t get to see him again, it’s about the fact that Harry doesn’t know how to be there for him. He feels terribly small all of a sudden, like he’s the pathetic one between the two of them.
“Mate, I need you there. It’s our first Christmas without Fred – how can you, you’re just going to–?”
“Alright, alright – it’s Malfoy’s turn.” Seamus is waving his hand around, waiting for the group's attention. He’s interrupted by Parkinson coming up behind Draco —
That night, when Harry expects Draco to leave, the other man turns to him and says, “Let’s get ready for bed,” reaching into his satchel, pulling out a small bag of toiletries.
, he’d said, before coming in to claim his New Year’s kiss from Pansy and Draco. Leaning into kiss Harry as well because,
“You’ve just seen what happens when I try to do that.” Draco sniffs, taking the back of his hand and wiping his nose. “Merlin, I feel disgusting,” he says with a scoff, gesturing down at himself.
Draco moans, hiding his face in his pillow, thrusting into Harry’s fist. He’s leaking precome and Harry uses that to help pump him harder, not faster — no, not yet. He’s teasing him and Draco knows it and Draco likes it and Draco’s matching Harry’s rhythm with his own hand on Harry’s hardened cock.
the sight of Draco on top of him, riding him, rutting into the fist Harry has on his furious cock is almost too much, but Harry doesn’t want to forget what the first time looks like – is enjoying the feeling too much to tear his eyes away. He blinks rapidly, pounds into the other man harder, uses a possessively tight grip on Draco’s hip to steady himself when he feels himself go frantic with the need for release.
Draco comes to him, and kisses him, and then flinches away from Harry’s touch. Every time. Harry can’t help but kiss him back, his mind will always fog with the easy desire of lust underneath the swirl of several complicated emotions that drive him to push Draco away.
Draco scoffs. “No, no, no,” he says, folding his arms across his chest, turning his chin away with a pout. “I slept with someone else that year, that would mean I cheated and I’m not a cheater.”
“You want my mouth?” Draco’s voice is so deep, and rough, and it’s practically scratching against his throat.
because it was what needed to be done, or can I believe it was wrong even if it was “for the greater good” ?
I’ve been informed (by Hermione) that my “correspondence was truly deplorable” and that “I should try and be civil when returning property that doesn’t belong to me” but honestly fuck that. Your family joined an ego maniac and got off without consequence. Why should I be nice to you?
“It’s a favourite of Ginny’s,” Harry explains. “I think she left it last time she was over, we have – er – movie nights.”
he pulls out of her grasp with a furious tug of his own arm and walks out of Ron’s room and into his own.
“I’m not gonna lie,” Harry said, lying down, eyes heavy from a sleep he did not want to fall into. “I like how we’re just sitting in silence at this point.”
Arousal starts to pool just below his abdomen, sending a shiver of want right through him. “No,” he says, voice low.
Harry wants to understand, wants to be there for Draco. He decides then that the answer is simple: don’t fuck this up. Harry takes a deep breath and makes his way back upstairs, a cool glass of water in hand.
“Will I see you there?” Harry still hadn’t looked at him, but his whole body buzzed with excitement.
“What the actual fuck?” Harry’s heart clenches, lump forming in his throat as he looks towards Draco who still hasn’t fucking looked at him.
They break apart and as Harry strips his shirt, Draco moves to unbutton his own. He stares up at Harry as he does it, eyes glazed, lower lip wet from their kissing. When the last button is undone Harry moves his hands to slip the white dress shirt off Draco’s pale shoulders. Harry kisses one shoulder, then the other, leaving a trail of wet, open-mouthed kisses across the expanse of Draco's collarbone, kissing at his sternum, bringing his callused hands to brush along the scars that litter Draco’s chest, stomach, abdomen.
Eventually, Malfoy grabs hold of a little phial, and holds it up towards Harry with an accomplished grin.
Draco kisses him again, sliding his tongue against Harry’s bottom lip, seeking entrance. Harry gasps, letting his tongue slide against Draco’s, working to undo the buttons on Draco’s shirt. Draco moans into his mouth, and rips open his shirt, letting the buttons fly everywhere.
Draco knows this to be an undeniable truth, their matching tattoos a heavy reminder of where unwavering loyalty for another person can lead you – how Theo faced a darkness he did not need to, if only to be able to save his best friend from losing his own self in it.
Dean is in his room again, sitting on the cobblestone sill, looking too comfortable in Harry’s spot.
“Reckon they’ve gone to ring in the new year with a shag?” Lavender asks, eyes towards the staircase that leads up towards the dorm.
“You want me to tell you something important?” Draco says, hand tightening around Harry’s neck, grinding down onto him, riding him. “I can tell how much you want me.”
Pansy Parkinson is in his room, he hears her shrill laughter before he sees her pug-face and Harry’s already surrounded by an air of annoyance before Parkinson’s eyes land on Harry, who’s watching her from the door. She’s sat in Harry’s usual spot, Firewhiskey bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Harry wants to push her off, tell her to take the floor. Instead, he dumps his books on the floor, shrugs off his school robes and undoes his tie.
Please be mindful of that when sending her your letter. I feel like I’m coming off passive aggressively, it’s just that - I’m really protective of the people I love. I hope you’ll understand.
Ron, between bites of his egg-covered toast asks, “Are you two like friends or something now?” He’s getting crumbs onto his shirt, earning him a fond eye roll from Hermione.
Yeah, I don’t remember Dumbledore fondly most days. He’s...he did something I can never forgive. Maybe he did love me, but does that mean I have to forgive him? Have you forgiven your Father for what he’s done?
P.S. I’m glad you like ABBA and I’m so happy to hear you also like Sade! She’s amazing. Enclosed is her album
It’s a year of them dating, dancing around each other, sharing a bed, learning how to touch, and be touched, with explicit consent, with non-verbal consent, learning their boundaries, carving them out in the space they take up together before they have sex again.
Harry flips their position and follows a soft rhythmic pace that keeps them on the edge of ecstasy for a long time. Harry kisses Draco’s face, sucks at his lower lip, nips at the curve of his neck all the while baring himself through whispered confessions of,
“Black.” Parkinson twirls, strips as Harry watches her from over the bottle, and turns back to them once she’s changed and asks, “Or red?”
Draco, still looking away, lifts a finger up towards the ceiling. “Caught in wand crossfire.” He drops the weight of his hand onto their touching thighs.
They eat in silence and Harry is acutely aware that this is the first time he’s ever done this with Draco; sit and eat, guard down.
Luna is one of those people who has such a kind soul, and can offer grace even to those who we may feel don't deserve it.
Harry stares at the light that seeps through the bottom of the door and wonders why things can’t simply be easy between them and is unable to stop the breath that sits between a scoff and a laugh when his mind unhelpfully supplies him with the thought:
“Mr. Potter, if you know of anything, it’s imperative you let us know,” McGonagall says, hands linked atop her desk. There’s a clock ticking from somewhere inside her office. Dumbledore is noticeably absent from his portrait; Harry can’t stop looking at it. “Mr. Malfoy has been sighted as tardy to almost all of his classes, he’s been noted as behaving irrationally, irresponsibly, and he is suspected to have broken the terms of his probation by engaging in the use of drugs and other narcotics.” She sounds exasperated as she lists every little thing on her wrinkled fingers.
–” Harry pauses, hips twitching as Draco pumps his cock, twisting his fingers inside Draco in response. “– just by looking at you, yeah,
Harry frowns, starts to take off his clothes as well, stripping down to his pants and throwing the jumper on over his head. Draco pulls out a black long sleeve and shrugs it over his shoulders, turning back towards Harry with a spliff in his mouth and a lighter in hand.
“Yeah, fuck yeah.” Harry feels antsy, pulling at the sleeves of his jumper so it falls over his hands as he sits down in his usual spot.
are far more complex and not as easy to digest. It’s wrong, he knows, and yet he can’t help the way his knee jerks with this reaction.
Harry hadn’t realised he’d been staring until Malfoy’s mercury gaze pierces into Harry, sending a shiver down his spine that he can’t blame on the weather – not that he doesn’t try to, anyway. Harry gives him the finger, smirks at Malfoy’s scandalized face. Then Malfoy sticks his own middle finger up, licks it slowly, the way one might when trying to seduce a book and turn a page, and scrunches his face – like it’s all a joke, like Malfoy knows Harry’s thought about men before. Then Parkinson catches Malfoy’s attention and the moment passes, and Harry pretends the fleeting curiosity of what Malfoy’s tongue might feel like never existed in the first place.
Draco swallows, feels his heartbeat quicken against his chest. “I don’t think it’s fair to put people in the position of having to forgive me.”
Their bodies move in tandem, as Harry thrusts in and Draco wraps his legs around Harry’s waist, matching each other as they follow a slow rhythm, setting the pace together. Harry looks down at Draco and Draco looks up at Harry as the rest of the world melts away. They share open mouthed kisses, hands exploring each other’s bodies. It feels like this is the first time they’ve ever come together, and in a way, it is.
Your Muggle neighbour, does he have a name? Seems like a cool guy, showing you all this stuff although I can imagine how hard it must be trying to keep up the Statute of Secrecy. Feel free to ask me stuff you're unsure about before going to him, just in case.
belief that Azkaban is an unjust punishment for someone who is so obviously struggling with a mental health issue."
.” He grinds the words out as a muscle in his jaw flexes and Harry wishes he knew why Draco didn’t want him, didn’t want to be his – is it so bad to belong to someone? Is it so awful to be wanted by someone like Harry?
2. Draco's friends are biased against Harry, point, blank, period. Meaning, they obviously are not going to see Harry's words in the same light that Draco does.
“That’s different, Harry.” Hermione’s brows curve in. She’s frowning. “You were getting better,” she says and when Harry clicks his tongue she adds, “You were!”
“Slytherins are the weirdest people on the fucking planet.” Seamus says with a grimace, shaking his head. “Sorry, Nev,” he chimes, with a pat to Neville’s back.
Malfoy swallows down his drink audibly, looking out the window. “Good to know.” His voice sounds rough. Harry likes the sounds of it, dipped low and deep like that.
“Have you ever been on the underground?” Harry asks, rising to his feet from the sofa couch he had been sitting at, waiting for Draco, following the other man into the kitchen.
Conflict is a part of human relationships, the best thing we can do for ourselves and each other is figure out ways to address conflict from a place of genuine empathy.
Harry feels his chest tighten, his stomach drop, as the room shifts from the sweet post-coital atmosphere into something that burns bile at the back of his throat. Does Draco truly hate Harry that much? How can he so quickly and instantly regret what’s transpired between them? Harry searches for his own regret and finds his heart barren of disgust.
Draco cries when he comes, and Harry wipes away his tears as easily as he does the spunk on their bodies. Instead of post-coital bliss that carries with it a strict countdown, Harry is met with Draco in tears, sitting up on his heels, still naked, twisting his hands and trying to speak, opening his mouth to form the words, growing frantic as he fails and tries and fails again to explain whatever it is he wants Harry to know.
Malfoy’s face shutters, his mercury gaze freezing into a familiar iciness. “Why wouldn’t I be?” He bites.
“Of course.” Harry’s hands are pushing back Draco’s fringe. “I’ll send you love letters every day if you’d like.”
Draco lets out a soft chuckle, getting up, wiping his lips, working his throat. He smacks his lips, tilting his head as if he’s discovering something. He looks the way one might when eating a new sweet, licking his lips and trying to discern the flavouring.
You can find them at your local record shop, you may need to ask around to find one. It comes with headphones (that play music right into your ears). You press the triangle to play, and the square to stop. There's a button to open it up and put the CD in (shiny smooth part goes down) and a dial that controls the volume.
Harry’s eyes stare at the light, practically unnoticeable scars that litter Draco’s chest. “I don’t,” he begins, clearing his throat, trying to find a better way to say: “I don’t share well.” The words slip out, leaving him exposed.
Anyway, Hermione gave me this book and it was really helpful. It’s also Muggle, and details all sorts of things that are important to know. The most important being, establishing your boundaries and having them be respected.
Luna looks up towards the cold-grey sky, the biting breeze lifts her golden locks in greeting. “You’re just a person, Harry.”
They had talked a bit, about this and that and all the minuscule things that Harry couldn’t remember, because they didn’t matter. Draco hadn’t wanted to talk about anything serious, so instead he’d talked about whatever came to mind — telling pointless stories that made them both laugh.
Draco’s palms begin to sweat. He hasn’t a clue what he should do with his hands. “Yes, did you tell Hermione you loved her? I’m sure she said it back. I’m sure Ronald would say it back as well, if you told him too.”
Everything has always been smoke and mirrors between him and Potter, with Harry. Draco does not want it to be a game, a mystery, a
Harry shrugs, unsure of what to say. “Do your friends give you any shit because we’ve been smoking together?”
He finally gets to touch, to taste, to feel, and fuck he’s wanted this for longer than he can admit to himself. He’s kissing Draco again, his chapped lips rough against the other man’s softer ones. He’s biting, and licking, and sucking on those pink lips – the ones he’s fantasised about for so long. And then he’s marking Draco’s flushed neck, he’s kissing and sucking and biting down,
Draco puts his hands in Harry’s, lets himself be led to bed, mirrors Harry as he sits, leg on the bed, foot meeting his thigh, the other still planted on the floorboards.
Coloured in their history, Harry sees with stark clarity what he has always been capable of. There is a version of them where Draco lays on a waterlogged floor bleeding, Harry above him. There is a version of them, the one that exists here and now, where Harry traces at the slightly raised skin, almost unnoticeable in the blur of candle-lit sight, raised and alive.
that you two would be able to put your childhood rivalry behind you. I never thought he would have such a negative influence on you.”
“Oh.” Draco moves the rice across his plate, putting his elbow to the table and leaning his cheek against the fist of his left hand. “We could have ordered takeout.”
, before practically bullying him into using it. Harry oftens forgets, but he figures cool water from the filter is better for Draco than just tap.
Draco licks his lips, stares at Harry through white lashes, and tells him he’s doing it wrong. It’s the first time he’s said a word to him in over two years.
Harry sits up, moves slowly, doing his best not to wake his friends. He stands, looking around the messy room.
Harry’s kissing Malfoy’s long, porcelain neck – the way he’s wanted to for the past few months, his hands shaking with the buzz of curiosity that courses through him. Finally,
Draco’s eyes glisten and he smiles, it’s a private thing – something that feels like it belongs solely to Harry. Draco shows him what to do, and if Harry keeps fucking it up on purpose, well, that’s his business.
“You know the ones… they play pictures with sound?” Draco gestures with his two pointer fingers, outlining a square in the air.
“I forgave him for me,” Hermione says, lifting her arm, the one that hides a scar under the tattoo of a sword. “I get to choose who I give grace to. Me. I’ve been hurt.”
“I am sorry, you know. For everything.” Draco blinks rapidly, trying to keep his voice steady. “I was awful, I was so, so awful. I never want to be that person ever again, I hate what I’ve done, hate the person I was - I wish I could take it back, do things differently, but I’m so sorry –” Draco stops talking, doesn’t think it’s fair if he cries like this. Would rather he didn’t cry.
Draco’s already a moaning mess beneath him and is grabbing at Harry’s hand, pushing Harry’s finger inside him and gasping out a soft
Harry kisses down from Draco’s neck all the way to the top of his abdomen where trimmed blond curls wait in greeting. Harry breathes in his musky scent and licks up his throbbing shaft, putting just the head in his mouth and twirling his tongue around it. Harry rubs the oil into his hand and wordlessly casts a quick cleaning charm, the way Draco taught him to, and teases his rim with a circling finger.
Draco puts his forehead to Harry’s shoulder, taking in a shaky breath, releasing it with a shudder. “You can’t possibly want me like this.”
Blaise seems like an interesting guy, maybe Ginny would like him after all. She’s not my girlfriend, by the way. I don’t think I mentioned this to you earlier, but we broke up. We tried to get back together after the war, but it was like - well, like the spark was gone. She still comes and visits on her weekends, since she’s still at school and I’m living with Ron and Hemrione - just to make sure we’re all doing alright. But, I fell for her when I was a kid, and then I don’t know - dying and killing a man really would do a number on just about anyone. Sometimes, I think I came back wrong. I don’t know.
Harry had never actually imagined what Draco would taste like, had only ever wanted to know. Had felt restless with the overwhelming curiosity that felt more like
“What the actual fuck is wrong with you? You’re getting upset over what exactly?” Ron calls from behind him.
Harry leans down and kisses him, relishes in the taste of his own come inside of Draco’s mouth and pulls Draco back up onto the windowsill. Harry tucks himself into his briefs, and undoes Draco’s trousers, pulling out his angry red cock from his pants.
He wants to taste himself inside the other man, to touch Draco's come filled arse, to feel up and down his shaking body.
Draco preens, face flushing as he leans closer into Harry, pointy chin pushing into the dip of his collarbone.
Slowly, moving cautiously, they slip off the last layers of clothing and now they are both very much naked and hard and Harry’s kissing Draco and rubbing their pricks together and clawing at his back.
Harry doesn’t know what to say back to that, just like he doesn’t know what to say when Draco clears the cleaned dishes, when he wipes down the kitchen counter, or when he grabs the broom that hangs by the garden back door and sweeps around the table and stove. Harry decides that it’s better to stare at him than say something foolish. Instead, he sits, chin in his hand, elbow on the table, eyes trained on Draco in his clothes, cleaning his kitchen, moving like he owns the place.
Hermione puts a hand over his. "Harry, they're saying that you have been taking and using various narcotics for months, willingly, alongside them. And that the day before Parkinson's overdose, you were the one with her taking drugs in Mrytle's bathroom."
The fifth time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, it’s pub night after a successful Auror raid. Draco had been brought in because of the mark on his arm. He’d recently opened an apothecary shop; sold popular potions and ones he’d made by himself. He’d patented five unique potions in the last year alone, all of which he had been working on the last two years – and he had been a suspect in the illegal potions ring until he had offered to bring down the potions smugglers who were selling fake potions with labels from his apothecary.
Hope, the treacherous thing, swells high in Harry’s chest. It feels like it’ll burst out of him, it probably could, if Harry let it.
The clock is about to strike midnight, people are already pairing off for their New Year’s kiss and Harry doesn’t want any part of
Draco’s grin is lazy, and his kisses are sloppy, but Harry loves the feeling of it. They’re laughing and laughing and kissing and touching and laughing.
“People think he’s getting high,” Ron says, coming over to them. “Not just on weed. They think he’s been hitting the hard stuff.” His voice is low, hands on the table and looking around him as he addresses the crowd.
Harry feels the warm scratch of the knit-blanket against his skin and releases a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. Draco grabs at Harry’s arm stuck between them and moves it over his shoulder. The is the first time, Harry notes, that there is touch between them with the explicit understanding that sex will not follow.
I’m glad you liked Sade’s album. I love it too, a lot. I actually had sex for the first time, listening to that album. It was really nice. Sorry if that’s too much information, haha.
When Harry reaches the bottom on the steps, he sees Draco sitting in the chair by the hearth, looking down, curling into himself. Harry’s heart jumps to his throat when he notices Narcissa Malfoy sitting in the settee next to him, joined by Professor McGonagall. On the couch directly across from the hearth sit Ron, Hermione and Mrs. Weasley.
Richard sounds like a cool guy, maybe one day I’ll get to meet him. I like what he said about “moving through your negative emotions,” I’ve been working out a lot lately, building some muscle, but when I get too overwhelmed I go for a run, and clear my head. It’s really been helping. Maybe that’s what he meant?
I hope you don't mind my using your first name. But seeing as we're friends and all, I think it's only appropriate! I mean, I know we aren't but I wouldn't mind if we were - I feel like we kind of are already to be honest, haha. And that way you don't have to lie to Richard! Let me know if this is okay with you!
"I— I can't do this," Malfoy says, face twisting and unsure. "I'm... sorry?" he says like a question with no answer.
Malfoy snorts. “I don’t know why your little friends have their knickers in a twist over it but believe me, I prefer
Harry feels something grow in his chest, filling his lungs and gripping his heart. Hope, Harry realises, it’s hope he feels in his chest. Harry does not know what he hopes for — hope is a treacherous thing, has led him towards more heartache than he ever thought he could bear.
Draco’s kissing down his chest, hands rubbing up and down his sides, moving his legs to straddle him. They’ve never done this before, never has Draco put his lips to his chest like that, never has he teased the delicate skin above his groin with featherlight touches.
, Harry thinks. He wants to get high, so he’s going to get high. Harry makes his way to Malfoy’s bed, sitting down cross-legged, diagonal to him. Malfoy leans against the wall with his knees pulled up to his chest.
1. Draco has a wishlist (think of it being like one of those Amazon ones) and people can add to it/send him stuff on it - obvi while still protecting his privacy.
“Sometimes, I wish there was a less messy way to travel between homes,” Draco says, taking his black over the shoulder bag and setting it down on the couch.
I didn’t realise that happened to you. I sometimes saw into Voldemort’s mind, back then. Just another fucked up war memory. Anyway, I saw him forcing you to torture Rowe once. I’m sure he did that to play some kind of fucked up mind game.
They start kissing and inhaling smoke and exhaling it into each other’s mouths and kissing some more. Harry grinds down into Draco’s swelling prick and kisses down his neck, biting at any bit of unmarked skin.
Jesus, we both are really fucked up by this whole thing aren’t we? Sometimes, I think you’re one of the few people who might actually understand what it’s like having Voldemort breathing down your neck. I mean you lived with the bloody freak for a year! He was a terrifying shell of a man who took so much from me.
“I love –” Harry cuts himself off before he says what he really means. “– the way you feel. Fuck, fuck,
Harry lifts the red cover, revealing an assortment of chocolates. He picks up a caramel-peanut butter heart shaped piece and holds it between his fingers out towards Draco. The other man, grey eyes glittering in the warmth of the room between them, wraps his fingers around Harry’s wrist, pulling his hand towards his lips, letting Harry place the piece of chocolate in his mouth. “Mm, this is good,” says Draco, chewing on the sweet treat, sucking Harry’s thumb into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it.
Then, get this, I think I’ve found this bloke that I might actually like and like an idiot I think I might actually be worth something to someone. But everyone wants a piece of the great Harry Potter, and no one ever just wants Harry.
I mean, I get what you said about Snape. He was a bully, though. Especially to people like Neville. And even though he was in love with my mum he still went out of his way to put me down. I think he’s a bad person, who didn’t want my mum to die and then fell into a debt he owed Dumbledore - one he couldn’t pay back.
Harry swallows. “Maybe a little,” he says. It’s easier to explain away the gooseflesh that spreads across his skin on the cool air that circulates his home.
“He was a bully, a bigot, a horrible person, a criminal, but –” Hermione says, fiercely. Ron pushes away her curls, kisses the spot between her shoulders. “Why get mad at me for letting go of my anger? It’s my pain, it belongs to me – I was so scared you’d be mad, because I saw him, because I moved on from it. I know he’s hurt you too and I’m–”
Enclosed you'll also find a VHS for one of my favourite queer films: To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar. I hope you have a VHS player? If not, you'll need to get one! It's really good, my Godfather and I watched it together over holiday break 5th year. It had just come out, and I instantly fell in love with it. I would
Draco tilts his head down, turns his cheek, resting it on Harry’s bicep. “No,” he says, turning his head until his lips sit on the tense muscle. He bites down, softly at first and then harshly – earning a groan from the back of Harry’s throat. “But I don’t think I would have tried sleeping with you again if it didn’t happen.”
Harry cuddles into Draco’s neck and breathes his earthly scent in deeply, leg and arm wrapping around the other man.
Harry hovers over Draco, leaning down to kiss him, pulling away to line his cock to Draco’s pink hole. Draco, with shaky fingers, grabs hold of Harry and together they put the tip of Harry’s cock on his rim, both groaning as Harry begins his gentle glide into the tight-wet heat of his body.
Draco traces an idle pattern across Harry’s chest, onto his bicep, down his forearm and back up. Harry plays with Draco’s hair, brushing his fingers through the cornsilk strands, lifting them up, allowing them to slowly slip through his fingers.
Harry’s fist clenches. Theo huffs out something between a scoff and a laugh. “You’ve gone and replaced me too.”
“Yes, darling, I’m here,” Narcissa says, pushing Harry away from Draco. “Do you see, Minerva? Look at how he regards my son. Do you truly believe he had no involvement at all in the events leading up to Pansy's overdose? He was one of the people she was last seen using with for Crice's sake!”
“We were told about it, Harry." Hermione has her head in her hands. "As Head Boy and Girl we were asked to keep an eye out and make sure he wasn’t using again.”
It’s quiet, almost too quiet, but Harry supposes most people are in their classes and that’s why there isn’t any noise coming from downstairs.
“Come,” Draco beacons, with his hand held out for Harry. Harry goes, taking Draco’s hand in his, and accepting the spliff he offers him.
They send love letters often. Not every day, for life gets in the way, but still. They send one another letters.
Draco gasps, and Harry turns his eyes on his man, aroused by the intensity of his gaze. Silver eyes are mere rings surrounding the blackness of the other man’s pupil, and Harry leans up, grabbing at Draco’s hand, placing it over his pounding heart, letting Draco feel what he tries not to show, guiding pale fingers across the hair of his chest, settling them on the scar of his sternum, letting Draco trail lower, feeling the tickle of his trimmed nails as they outline the second lightning scar that sits squarely over his diaphragm.
Later, when Draco’s pumping in and out of him smooth and slow, moonlight painting his skin in a silver-white glow Harry asks, “Does that mean I’m the first person you’ve done this with?”
Happy New Year! 1999 has been great so far, only one more year before we enter a new milenia, crazy right?
“I think it’d be different if she hadn’t been caged in his dungeon.” Ron sighs. “I think it’s not fair to tell someone who they can and can’t forgive.”
On Draco and Harry’s one year anniversary, after an in-depth conversation of Do’s and Don’ts where Draco said,
Harry kisses him. He’s slow about it, hovering over Draco’s lips, eyeing the slight quiver of his body, moving his palm to Draco’s reddening cheek, putting his slightly chapped lips gently against Draco’s soft ones. The kiss is short, tentative, Harry doesn’t move to deepen it, instead keeping his body close, pulling away slowly, feeling the way their lips stick together and come apart as he does.
So now us mentally ill queer folk are dying our hair, is that the new trend? I went the body modification route and got some piercings and tattoos instead. Check out the polaroids I included. Got a tattoo in honour of my mum (Lilies on my arm) and dad (Stag tattoo on my back). I’m also thinking of getting something for Sirius and Remus too.
Harry feels himself flush and licks his lips, staring at Draco, who moves towards him, with wide eyes.
They’re kissing on Harry’s bed, young and foolish and so naive, they’d been drinking and smoking a bit – the others in the eighth-year dorm encouraging their drunkenness with their own, and Malfoy’s cheeks are warm with a mirth that’s been delicately cultivated between them.
Harry smiles, “Me too,” he says, slipping out of Draco, mourning the loss of the other man’s warmth.
“Be careful,” Harry says, licking his lips, tasting the salt of sweat on his upper lip. “I’m,” he tries, breathing roughly. “I could –”
“Alright, Theo, this one’s for you,” Neville begins, mischievous glint in his eyes. “Who’s the last person you slept with?” He smirks, like it’s a game between them two. It makes Harry quirk a brow at the sight of it.
“Mr. Potter, you’ve been skipping classes, your grades are slipping, the same cannot be said for Mr. Malfoy who has kept steady grades in all of his classes. He says any absences were spent with you and that you and him both engaged in the use of these narcotics with the full knowledge of his tumultuous relationship with Pixie Dust in the past.”
“Think of you,” Draco tells him through half-lidded eyes, stopping the chop of his vegetables, putting down the knife in his hand, turning to face Harry completely.
that if word gets out that Harry Potter was taking Level Three regulated drugs within your institution you'll be removed from your position." Narcissa's voice is ice-cold. "Need I remind everyone that Harry Potter owes me a Life Debt and that sending my son to Azkaban will leave it unsettled."
“I can’t,” Draco sobs eventually. “I hate this. I hate this. I’m going to be sick.” He gets up then, shuffling around for his pants, lifting them up and dragging them onto his sweat-dried skin, opening the door to Harry’s bathroom and stepping in.
“I don’t,” Harry says, quietly. Trying to ensure he does not break whatever stillness exists between them, hoping that he does not shatter the delicacy of this trust. “We don’t, if you don’t want to –”
Draco fucks him with his fingers nice and slow, kissing Harry's jaw, rubbing his stubble against him, biting and sucking down Harry’s neck harsh enough that it’ll definitely leave bruises.
, they explain. If anyone would just stop to ask Harry his opinion, maybe then they'd realise that Harry thinks they’ll be able to get on just fine — because there seems to be some sort of unspoken agreement between the two men that their petty rivalry of the past is just that: a rivalry best left for their past selves to repeat and their present selves to ignore.
Harry cuts at his steak, pulling away the pieces of fat he dislikes, biting instead into the tenderness of the meat. “I usually hate cooking.” He shrugs.
His grey-sharp hues never leave Harry. They watch him with the sober intensity of their last night sharing the same dorm, sharing the same space. Their dorm, their space.
Draco sits next to Harry on the floor, their shoulders would be brushing against one another if Harry wasn’t leaning back and using the foot of the couch for support. Nott is to Draco’s left, and Harry notices that their fingers are still loosely intertwined. Harry feels his jaw tighten, something dark and ugly scratching underneath his chest.
Draco smacks his lips, tilts his head. “Ergh,” he says, moving his hands and dragging them down his face. “My breath stinks.” He lets out a short breath. “Alright, fine. I want dinner.”
Parkinson was over again, she’d brought Zabini with her to hang out in his and Malfoy’s room. They’d gotten pissed together, and it was brilliant because no one had told him to stop or slow down. They'd cheered him on instead and Zabini, one of the fittest blokes in their year, had said
“I prefer this to us fighting,” Harry admits eventually. “Hermione and Ron are being weird about it, but I prefer this, actually.”
The strands of Draco’s hair stick together, dripping water onto Harry’s white shirt, and Harry can’t help himself from staring. Draco’s eyes are red, like he’s been crying some more, and Harry’s body feels tight. He places the food in front of him, trying his best at delicacy.
"My son had made those around him fully aware of his addiction, in accordance with with his probation. I will not let him take sole blame for relapsing when he was seen snorting Pixie Dust alongside the supposed saviour of our world!"
“I’m in the auror training program,” Harry tells him, forehead leaning against Draco’s, the ring of his glasses pressing into the other man’s pale eyebrows.
“You must think me terribly pathetic,” Draco says, eyes trained on the perspiration that trails slow down the glass in his hand. He brings the water to his lips and takes a sip. “Draco Malfoy, Death Eater, cries during sex.” His voice sounds so small, and Harry shakes his head, trying to clear the tightness of his throat, trying to form a sentence through the rhythm of
Harry leans into the crevice of Draco’s sweat-silk neck, licking in the salty taste, biting down at the juncture where neck meets shoulder, thrusting in deeply, harshly, with the intensity of his longing.
Malfoy turns to him, eyebrow lifted in question, a smirk already forming on his plump lips. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
See, I knew you’d understand me when it came to not wanting to see a mind healer. Hermione just doesn’t get it, because it’s working out well for her and Ron. But, Ginny and I are both against it. It’s causing a lot of unnecessary drama right now and it’s getting on my last nerve.
Draco hums, taking the blanket in his hand and wrapping it around himself from the shoulders, scooting closer to Harry. “You sure you’re not cold?”
The first time Draco and Harry come together, Malfoy cries before anything can really start between them.
