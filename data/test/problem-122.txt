"Fine then, Sunshine, Daisies, Butter Melow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!" Of course nothing happened and the box the rat was munching from finally got blown off and Ron didn't really know what to do but It only made Malfoy smirk to himself.
"Better than i would've even expected..." I said to myself while Malfoy placed his hand on my shoulder and said that he would see me later before going off towards his room and I decided to do the same for my room since I was exahusted enough after all of this. Once I made it to my room, I watched the night sky for a little bit while petting my owl who was giving out small chirps; eventually I fell asleep though and ended up meeting up with Ron to start going to our classes with our new colored robes on, mine a very deep Green while his was a sort of bright orange and red.
Suddenly getting tapped on the shoulder by Harmonie, I snapped out of my thoughts of trying to take notes from the Professor to see him glaring down at me which made me put my quill on the table quickly. "Potter, our new celebrity...Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar and what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?"
"Me? You're the one who tripped first, i only tripped onto the ground beacuse of you not watching where your feet where going." "You're the one who twisted your body in the wrong way, if your body hadn't been in the wrong position, I would've just gotten my Robe back and that would've been the ending of it." "You should be able to watch where your eyes are going instead of worrying about what I'm doing, what idiot can't process that much, I guess that would be you wouldn't you?" "Want to make-out?" "Definitely."
"Ha...." I laughed nervously for a moment due to their glaring. Eventually class ended and it was time for my first flying lesson and so it didn't take very long at all to arrive and we were stepping besides our own personal broomsticks while being told to say 'up' in order to summon it. "Up!" I said, and in only seconds from my first time the broom shot up into my hand unlike everyone else except for both me and Malfoy; which was absolutely hilarious the moment Ron's broom hit his head and I seriously just couldn't stop laughing. "Shut up Harry!"
"Well don't throw up on me Harry!!" He yelled before instantly taking a step back and pushing me towards the nurse's office. "Sorry, I'll catch up with you two later, Harry really looks sick, maybe you weren't fully healed up beacuse you don't look good. I guess we'll have the nurse look at you for the day, hopefully you won't be in there for any longer than you should have been already. You were lucky to recover after only a few days though, most who get hit like that could be there for a couple weeks, I'd understand if you still weren't feeling well."
"Never. Insult. Albus Dumbledore. Infront. Of Me." All of a sudden he used his umbrella to shoot out a light to Dudley which appearantly was beacuse Dudley was devouring my cake like the spoiled brat he was. Even so, once that beam of sparkling light hit Dudley I could only see a pigs tail pop out of Dudley's ass which made me Crack up laughing while my Aunt and Uncle were panicking like hell and Dudley was too. "Oh...I would appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts I did that Harry, strictly speaking I am not allowed to do magic out here for the moment. Anyway, we've got to get going since we're behind schedule...unless you'd rather stay of course." Forming a small smile on my face, I followed Hagrid without any hesitation, excited for the new journey ahead of me while just waiting for me to wake up from this fairytale-like dream.
Harry begs and begs for the Sorting Hat to not put him in Slytherin but the Sorting Hat sees a potential he can not. Already making enemies with Draco Malfoy on the first day, it's difficult for them to get along in the slightest but they begin to learn what it means to fall in love in the worst way possible. Even though Harry tries to pretend he has no actual connection with the Slytherin household, there is no way he can do that so easily with a single chain pulling him straight back known as Draco Malfoy.
Breathing out a deep sigh, I was continuing to serve breakfast like I usually do until I noticed something from outside the window. There were more than thirty owls surrounding and all over our house that it was incredibly bizarre, I've never seen anything like it, this is like the type of magic you would see in fairytales. "No sir, not one blasted mythical-" Instantly hit in the head from a letter flying out of the window, there was a sudden rumbling as if it were a earthquake and everyone was jumping out of their skin.
"Thank you..." I said to this stranger and I was seriously happy to receive something like this, I don't usually get amazing things like this so it was absolutely wonderful and kind. In only minutes, he sat down and used an umbrella to start up a fire somehow. "Excuse me but...who are you?"
"Me too, i should've listened to you when you were saying that you didn't want to date anyone. I think Malfoy should be the one to apologize most, not that he even would in the first place, I mean honestly I bet he's just jealous you attract girls in the first place, i wouldn't be surprised If he turned out gay. So what did you want to say that's making you so nervous?" He asked me which made me widen my eyes and I wouldn't look him in the eye while clenching my teeth tightly; I was seriously feeling embarrassed over hearing something like that and there was no way I could say anything to Ron. "Nothing."
In only mere seconds I had him pinned against the bed and my lips were across his own while my tongue was rubbing across the edges of his soft-to-the-touch lips; every inch of it was delicious and I could already feel my hand reaching under his clothing while my fingertips were gracing across the cold yet timid feeling of his bare skin that I swore my mind was going crazy in an instant and I was going to devour every inch while I got further and further into this. I thought I heard him moaning while I rubbed my fingers across his nibbles; any longer and I wouldn't be able to control myself. Jumping off of eachother in an instant, Draco quickly straightened his clothing as a Nurse came over to us from the sudden sound of the doorway opening. "So...seems like we have a problem here?"
"Give it back Malfoy!" I yelled at him, definitely not going around the school in my underwear. "Make me Pottah." He smirked but no matter how much I kept trying to snatch it out of his hands, he kept flinging from side to side, but once I finally managed to grab onto it, the both of us ended up tripping and definitely weren't in the best position right now.
Once I stepped inside with the ringing of the doorbell infront of me I was trying to ask if anyone was here until all of a sudden someone popped out of nowhere behind the dozens of large shelves. "I wondered when I might see you Mr. Potter; it seems only yesterday your Mother and Father were out here buying their first wands, I remember every wand I've ever sold and they did many great things in their time..." Finally picking out a small yet thin black box, he handed it over to me. "Well give it a wave boy!"
Once we both heard the door opening, me and Malfoy were jumping out of our skin and I quickly pushed him aside and got my robes on in an instant. "I know, I'm late for class, Malfoy was just hollering at me about that, that's all! See you!" I said before running away out of the door and all the way to my first class which was Potions again but Snape was surprised to see me. Interestingly enough, this wasn't actually a school day and my prefect was supposed to tell me that. "Oh...I kinda rushed out of my dorm quickly so I didn't have the time to hear him out."
Once we got to the train station area I was told to stay close to my ticket beacuse its very important and that my train is in only a few minutes but I couldn't find it, even if i asked around, beacuse there is no platform known as 9 3/4. Finally finding a family that looked to be Wizards I could see them rushing through one of the pillars while saying something about the train to 9 3/4. "You're turn Fred, go on."
Harry begs and begs for the Sorting Hat to not put him in Slytherin but the Sorting Hat sees a potential he can not. Already making enemies with Draco Malfoy on the first day, it's difficult for them to get along in the slightest but they begin to learn what it means to fall in love in the worst way possible. Even though Harry tries to pretend he has no actual connection with the Slytherin household, there is no way he can do that so easily with a single chain pulling him straight back known as Draco Malfoy.
"I will not pay for him to go to school to have some Crack Pot Fool teach him magic tricks!" I was honestly really happy for this whole thing, I never thought in my entire life I could go to a witch and wizard school or even that I was an actual wizard in the first place. Although since my Aunt and Uncle were so insulting about Albus Dumbledore Hagrid instantly went into a fierce threating mood that I swore if they continued to insult that headmaster Hagrid wouldn't mind becoming a murderer right here and now...it's easy to see you don't go around messing with Hagrid it seems...
Before I could open it though, Dudley instantly snatched it out of my hands while running over to Uncle Vernon. "Dad, Daddy, Harry got a letter!!" "Give it back, that's mine!" I tried to yell at them but Uncle Vernon just laughed it off casually as if it were something hilarious until he noticed what it said apparently and it made both my Uncle and Aunt nervous for some reason but I didn't know why, it was just a letter.
"A bit..." Don't worry, I felt the exact same before my first game." "What happened?" "I...don't really remember....I took a Bludger two minutes in and woke up in the hospital two weeks later...I'd be careful if I were you out there." Oliver said in response and all I could do was take in a deep gulp while trying not to show how nervous I was right now since everyone keeps making this worse on my nerves in the first place.
I told him but he was also looking as concerned as I was. "Its not possible, no way Pottah, but we can't keep that up forever either..." Not really sure what to do, we just walked to class together while stealing small glances at eachother throughout the halls. Once we were about to get into the classroom, I pulled him over to a wall where no one could see us behind it and gave him a small kiss on the lips for a second which turned our faces a complete shade of red, afterward we dashed into the classroom without another word.
More than a billion letters were practically soaring out of the chimney and I was loving every second, while Dudly was clinging to Aunt Patinua, I was trying my best to catch one of them while most likely grinning WAY too much over this. Finally catching one of them, Uncle was trying to chase me down for it, unfortunately before I could sneak myself into the Cupboard so that I could lock myself inside and he couldn't get to me I was pulled up into the air while he kept a firm glare on his face. "Let me go, they're MY letters! Let go of me!"
"Help!!" Throwing stuff at the Troll we were doing our best to distract it but that wasn't working very well so I instantly grabbed onto its gigantic club which confused the troll half to death; trolls aren't exactly the sharpest crayon in the box but definitely strong. Instantly shoving my wand into its nose in hopes that would get him off our back in some way, it only made him more mad and he held me upside down while trying to swing his club at me but I kept trying to avoid it but I couldn't keep this up forever. "Ron, do something!" "Like what?!" "Anything!"
"Yeah I've been catching myself thinking of it, in the sweeter morning, everyday I chase after her but I can't catch lightning. Catching myself thinking of it, in the sweeter morning, everyday I chase after her but I can't catch lightning....Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. No I can't catch lightning; Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. Oh, I can't catch lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. Yeah I can't catch lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning." Somehow this wasn't helping me too much but it was the only thing I had right now to distract myself so I just continued singing in the silence.
"Trust me, you won't. It's actually in your blood, your family has it in their name of being wonderful Seekers too, you can see their first place trophy in the trophy hall of your father's winning." I had no idea my father was a seeker, but then again who doesn't know more about me then I do right now? Once it was finally time for me to learn Quidditch I was brought out to the field I was taught flying from and was carrying a large black box with Oliver before the both of us finally sat it down. "Quidditch is easy enough to understand, each team has 7 players. Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker which is you."
"It doesn't make sense for Snape to do that, but he does seem a little bit off...I just hope you're wrong." Going down into the hallway even further we finally split away towards our house's dorm in hopes something or anything would prove us wrong while we finally got some rest for the night. "I really hope they're wrong about Professor Snape."
"I'm WARNING you boy, any funny business or tricks, you won't have any meals for a week, understood?" Nodding my head silently, I was finally allowed to get into the car in boredom before we finally got to the Zoo; it was honestly really nice here and I enjoyed seeing the animals but unfortunately Uncle Vernon and Dudley were snapping on glass while trying to make the snake behind it move, although it just ignored them so they left to some other part of the Zoo but I stayed where I was.
"I told you, I remember every wand I've ever sold Mr. Potter.; interestingly enough, the phenoix whose tail resides in your wand was only chosen by one other, the wizard does not choose the wand but the wand chooses the wizard. This wands brother, the one chosen from that one other, gave you that scar. He did many great things, terrible things, but great."
"Harry, happy birthday!" It was an amazing gift and I walked over to Hagrid after paying for my wand. We eventually got to a small rest area but i couldn't stop thinking about what he was saying to me about my scar and why this all had a connection to me, I tried asking Hagrid beacuse I'm sure he knew if he knew about the death of my parents. "First, understand this Harry, not all wizards and witches are good people, some of them turned evil and there was one particular wizard a few years ago who turned the most evil. His name was...V...his name was...Vol..." It seemed hard for him to say for some reason so I tried to ask him to write it down but he didn't know how to spell it appearantly. "Fine...Voldemort."
Saying the words 'LeviOSA' the feather began to fly into the air and she was happily content with herself while the Professor congratulated her for a job well done which ended up with Ron collapsing his head onto his books in annoyance; Longbottom tried to say the spell too and it worked until he suddenly blew up the feather somehow. "I think we're going to need another Feather Professor..." I said, wondering how the hell that even happened in the first place, he must've done something wrong, maybe his pronunciation.
"Across from us are Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle; it won't take you long to see that Pure-Bloods like yourself are much better than Muggleborns. I've heard dozens of Slytherin are usually Pure-Bloods but I could be wrong, the feast here is much better than you would've expected isn't it?" I still didn't really understand what this whole Muggleborn and Pure-Blood thing was about so I decided to ask him about it and of course he didn't take long to answer at all while giving me that same sly smirk from before. "I would've assumed the great Harry Potter would've known at least that much, Pure-Bloods are magical beings known for the ability for being born from both magical parents like your own; for example both of us. Unlike Muggleborns, they are born from two non-magical parents that live and are raised from filthy muggles; from what I've heard that Weasley that tries to be near you is also Pure-Bloods but prefer not to be known as such things and would rather pretend to be and act like muggles which easily gives them the name of a Muggleborn."
"That's not a real spell, it's pathetic, let me show you how to do it correctly Muggle-born. Sunshine, Daisies, Transfor-Rendom!" Watching the tiny rat puff into a yellow-like color Draco sat down across from me, that smirk still on his face. In only seconds he was waving his wand infront of my glasses while saying 'oculus reparo' which fixed my glasses instantly. "You can see better now can't you? Of course, unlike Muggle-borns I can also do things like that; you'll find some wizard families are better than others....for example like that...." He said to Ron trying to talk with his mouth full of Chocolate but Malfoy just ignored him and held out his hand. "Of course, I can help you there, you don't want to go making friends with the wrong kind."
Once the next morning came I was meeting up with Ron and Hermoine again while we walked to class together; my head was banging a little bit from this whole affair but I worked it out well enough. "Is something wrong Harry?" Hermione asked me, but I could seriously feel that my body was still exauhsted and my head was banging a little bit which caused them some concern. "I've just been stressed out lately is all."
I could see Harmonie raising her hand in the air constantly in hopes she could answer since she apparently knows everything, but I honestly had no clue. "I...don't know Sir...." "Pity...fame isn't everything it seems..." "Clearly, Harmonie knows, it's a pity not to ask her." I could hear the entire class laughing because of this but Professor Snape silenced them quickly while not even bothering to look at Hermonie as he leaned down onto the table. "Put your hand down silly girl, you look like a fool. For your information Potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is called the 'draught of the living dead'; a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for Monkshood and Wolfsbane, they come from a similar plant known as aconite; now...why aren't you all copying this down? Slytherin will have ten points taken away for you classmates attitude." Malfoy who was laughing over this whole thing, finally stopped once he heard about points being taken away and I could easily see the rest of Slytherin giving me a firm glare.
I think I was almost over it but once I noticed Malfoy coming into the room in the pitch black of the night, he was seriously bringing everything back and I could barley force words out of my mouth without my face turning a bright shade of pink, meanwhile he was no different than me. Sitting across from me, he was taking in a big gulp without looking me in the eyes at all. "If you dare tell anyone POTTAH, then I swear on the entire Hogwarts grounds that I will make our life a living hell, trust me."
"Did you see that look on his face?? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze he'd have remembered to land on his arse." I was beginning to see what Ron was talking about and instantly demanded for Malfoy to give it back right now. "Nah, I think I'd rather leave It for Longbottom to find, how about on the roof Pottah?" Malfoy mocked me before flying into the air with the tiny ball that Longbottom received and I was about to kick off too but Hermonie grabbed onto my shoulder.
"Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardry." Instantly running over to me, Uncle Vernon was instantly filled with rage and wouldn't have any of this sort of stuff, but it only made me way more than pissed off to know he knew about this my entire life. "You aren't going, we swore when we took him in as a baby that we would put a stop to all this rubbish!"
"SILENCE!! Now, there is no reason to panick, we're going to take care of this so will the prefects please take each of their houses back to their dorms and wait there. Teachers please follow me to the dungeons." Following my Slytherin Prefect both me and Ron were able to realize that Hermoine didn't know and snuck out of the crowd to find her which ended up with us finding her next to the troll athat must've wondered its way into the girls bathroom and was attacking her while she was screaming her eyes out. "Hermione!!"
"Oh, Oh; I got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around, my faith in you was fading when I met you on the outskirts of town and I said Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone, I keep waiting for you but you never come. Is this in my head, I don't know what to think, he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...marry me Juliet you never have to be alone, I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad so go pick out a white dress it's a love story baby just say yes. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, cause we were both young when I first saw you." Listening to the same song for who knows how long, I finally got myself something to eat after turning off the song 'Love Story' that I already knew was produced by Taylor Swift. Dudley would laugh at me if he heard me singing this, but at least I know how to sing unlike that spoiled brat.
"Yes Uncle Vernon." Of course Dudley wasn't happy in the slightest once he noticed he was one singular present short of 37 since last year which only made me roll my eyes at him and I began to pour Uncle's Coffee. "Yes but some of them are quite bigger than last year..." Uncle tried to explain but Dudley couldn't care less like the immature brat that he is.
"Maybe it wasn't exactly a good idea....I mean I never exactly said I would...." I started but Ron and Hermoine were only giving Malfoy fierce glares. "Don't sink to his level Harry. Infact, You know what, he doesn't need to listen to you beacuse I'm going to take him on a date tonight." I was surprised that Hermoine had said something like that, especially beacuse we practically had no chemistry at all for that and this was nothing more than excuse beacuse she was aggravated too much with Malfoy. I was actually very nervous about this, mainly since I didn't exactly approve of this and I didn't want Draco getting the wrong idea that I was just ditching him like that, especially after last night. Already, Draco was looking at me for some sort of answer.
"I don't care how BIG they are!!" I'm surprised they even put up with him, he's seriously out of control and they only influence it, I'll never understand his own sanity. Regardless of his temper, Aunt Patinua tried to calm down the situation before it escalated. "Ok, Ok, here's what we're going to do, we'll go out later and buy you two new presents alright bumpkin?" Finally pleased with himself, he opened his presents in admiration before we all walked out to the car in order to go to the Zoo but I only received a sharp look of fierce intimidation from my Uncle.
Even though my Uncle was trying to keep it away from me, while tearing them up, the more letters kept arriving into our house, from a mere three to dozens of 20 and more. It was almost frightening how insane he was becoming as if he finally mentally broke, throwing them into the fire, boarding up the doorway with wood and so much more. Once it was Sunday he practically looked like a mess, his hair was all over the place and he was beyond anxious that it was almost disturbing. "Sunday, in my opinion the best day of the week, no single letter not a single one wouldn't you agree Harry?"
"Voldemort?" I said but Hagrid made sure I kept my voice down before continuing any further which made me nod my head quickly. "They were dark times for us all...he brought followers onto the dark side of the Wizard world and anyone who stood up against him would...'dissappear'. Your parents encountered him and tried to fight back but it was useless once ge was ready to kill. Nobody, not a single one could escape his grasp but you...a small little baby...that mark on your head isn't any old scar Harry, it's a large curse, a very evil curse at that. Some say he died after that whole affair but that's Codswallop in my opinion. Nah I think he's still out there somehow...but what's for certain is something about you stumped him that night, that's why your famous, you're the boy who lived."
"Yea...must be beacuse of the hospital...definitely...I really feel like I'm going to throw up." I said while clutching onto my mouth but he only told me to hang on just a little bit longer until we got to the nurse and thankfully I could in order for her to give me a small bucket which didn't go down well for me since I swore that I was puking my eyes out. "Blimey Harry..." I could hear Ron saying to me but I just ignored him.
"THAT'S IT, WE'RE GOING FAR AWAY WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND US!!" I could hear him screaming and it was honestly both hilarious and disturbing how insane he was starting to act. Hearing Dudley replying over the whole situation, I had to admit that I agreed with him 100% "Daddy's gone mad hasn't he?!"
"Umm....I don't know...." "Clearly, maybe next time I should focus on configuration of turning your brains into a timewatch so that one of you might learn the way to not being such imbeciles." It was embarrassing enough that we were getting lectured like this by Professor. Snape but the entire classroom was laughing at us, although Snape told them to be quiet and to pay attention from now on to all of us, which forced the both of us to keep our minds focused.
For a split moment we were both taking a slight glance at eachother before turning back to the lecture though. Once his lesson was over it was time for Professor Flickwits class now. "One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation or the ability to make objects fly; now do you have the feathers I gave you?" Watching Hermoine pull hers up in the air in an instant he just nodded his head genuinely. "Now, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been learning, since Potter was in the hospital I'll go over it one more time, just swish and flick and say 'Wengardium Leviosa'." The Professor told us with a simple wave of his wand over the motion of the magic spell; afterward we began to try and cast the spell but it was useless and difficult for some reason.
Nodding his head at me, all of a sudden we noticed Professor Dumbledore had noticed that we kissed eachother which was a complete disaster because out of anyone Dumbledore was the first to find out so we had to be even more careful from now on. "P-P-Professer, it wasn't, I mean, we're not-"
[I Hope You Enjoy My Story Re-make, I'll Update Often So No Worries, Enjoy! ♡]
My head was aching from falling ontop of him and I'm sure his was too since we both easily could tell this was nothing more than an accident. Even so, once we both were able to come to our senses on this 'accident' both me and Malfoy had my leg pressed against his dick in a sort of grinding motion and my lips were formed against his own without a single bit of warning, his tongue had even managed to slide its way inside due to the impact and it was overlapping my own. We were exactly sure how to move considering each taste and sense of ours were spinning in circles with the warmth and soft motions across our bodies from the simplest ease of me pinning him down.
Once I was sure there was no more vomit left, the nurse took my tempature which thankfully came back positive but it was still preferred I stayed here just for the night in order to assure I was doing better. Ron hung around for a little while in order to meet up with me about this whole disaster that happened all of a sudden, but eventually he had to leave sometime so I was forced alone with my thoughts circling over what just happened. This was all Malfoy's fault for taking my Robe in the first place, I didn't ask for this, he forced this to happen.
Suddenly seeing my Owl flying down to me with some sort of Package I was surprised I even got mail in the first place and a broomstick at that. "Wow, that's the new Nimbus 2000, I wonder who gave you that..." Oliver said before finishing up preparations and giving me the Griffindor outfit for the match; while we waited for the game to start, we were all holding tightly to our Broomsticks. "Are you nervous Harry?"
"She stares me down with those electric eyes, no matter how hard I try I can't escape that gazing night. That girls up in the atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere; oh she's way up in the atmosphere. Yeah, I've been waiting, waiting for you anticipating chasing after things that you do but I can't catch lightning. Waiting Waiting Waiting for you anticipating chasing after things that you do but I can't catch lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. No I can't catch Lightning oh yeah, oh no I can't catch lightning, I can't catch lightning, oh I can't catch lightning, oh no I can't catch lightning." Non of this helping unfortunately, I tried to distract myself from this all for a little longer but I couldn't find any way so I just pushed on the Icon 'Lightning By Alex Goot' before turning it off and doing my best to fall asleep.
Looking down at his hand, I only looked him back up in the eye with irritation beacuse of the insults towards my new friend. "I think I can tell the right sort for myself, thanks." Giving me the same sort of irritated glance, he left in only seconds like an immature child, thankfully we finally found our way to the school once it was nighttime and went up the staircase towards a lady known as Professor McGonagall it seems. She said that everyone could join up with our classmates but first had to be separated into their houses, Griffindyor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin; whoever's house has enough points at the end if the year wins the house cup. But before any of us could do anything Professer Dumbledore had something to say to us.
Trying my best to keep out of sight from the other Beaters, it was increasingly difficult but I could already hear points being given to our team before the Keeper was hit down to the ground and passed out. Even so, I was doing my best to catch up and get the golden Snitch but it was nearly impossible. For some reason I couldn't control my broom at all, it was like it had a mind of its own. I was practically dangling from the broomstick for a few seconds until I was finally able to control it once more and got ontop of it again.
"So I sneak out to the garden to see you, we keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes, escape this town for a little while. Oh, Ho, cause you were Romeo I was a Scarlet Letter and my dad said "Stay away from Juliet!" but you were everything to me i was begging you please don't go and I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone, I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess, it's a love story baby just say yes. Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel, this love is difficult but it's real, don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess, it's a love story baby just say yes."
"Give it back Malfoy or I'll knock you off your broom!" "Is that so Pottah?" Rushing at him instantly, he only twisted around his Broom before I could push him off while Smirking at me tauntingly. "What's wrong Pottah, can't keep up? If you really want it back then here you go!" Without any hesitation he threw it through the air and across the field; I was practically sprinting at the speed of light in order to get to it before it hit the brick wall and thankfully I was able to catch it the second before it could break.
Placing my earbuds into my ears, I tried to keep quiet so I didn't get complained at while everyone was busy sleeping and began to let the words spill out of my mouth. "We were both young when I first saw you, I closed my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there on the balcony of summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ballgown, see you make your way through the crowd and say hello; little did I know that you were Romeo and you were throwing pebbles and my dad said "Stay away from Juliet." and I was crying on the staircase begging you "Please don't go!"; and I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone, I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run, you'll be the prince and I'll be the princess, it's a love story baby just say yes."
Right before I could though, I noticed a Bludger was aimed straight for Draco's head and as much as I don't want to do this, even a bully like him deserves more than to end up in the hospital like that and so I pushed him forward towards the Snitch itself and shielded him with my body which ended up with feeling an intense sharp pain in my head before everything blacked out for me and I finally woke up in the hospital without barley remembering what happened. "Harry! You're awake!"
"Not really, our dorm room is incredible and I can't figure out why you hate Malfoy that much, he definitely has an ego I'll give you that but he isn't that bad as you make him out to be." Looking like he almost choked on his own spit, I swore he was going to hang himself right there. "Are you still half asleep or something?! Don't joke around like that!" Ron yelled but I still was confused about what was going through his head about this. "Malfoy is not 'nice', his entire family only cares about themselves and Pure-Bloods, not once has any Malfoy tried to be an egotistical bully, just you watch he'll be showing his true colors today."
She said which made us nervously laugh to ourselves, wondering if she noticed anything. "It's past Slytherin household rules to be out this late, you're lucky I'm only giving you a warning, get back to your dorm Draco Malfoy." Said the nurse in annoyance which made him sigh with relief to himself and I did too. "Right...I totally forgot...my mistake honestly, I'll be leaving then." I still couldn't believe I was doing this and was trying to process the situation while the nurse told me to get some sleep but I just couldn't and got my mp3 once I was actually alone finally.
"Umm...what are you two talking about?" I tried to ask them while processing the words about some sort of match that I'll be facing against Slytherin. It didn't take them very long to explain that Quidditch was the Hogwarts offical sport and for us we compete against different teams but for the first time in forever I would be playing against my own team with a different team which was apparently Griffindor and I would be shown the ropes in just a few minutes so I could be excused from my next class but tomorrow I definitely had to show up for class.
"Sorry about him, he doesn't understand what it's like, laying there day after day, watching people press their ugly faces on you." For some reason though, the snake lifted his head up at me as If he understood what I was saying somehow. "Can you hear me?" Nodding his head, I was surprised that the snake could really understand me at all, but it was quite amazing in all honesty. "I've never talked to a snake before, do you talk to people often? You're from Burma aren't you; did you think it was nice there, do you miss your family?"
Going into the air with the rest of my team, I could see the gigantic field and hear the announcer. "Welcome to the first match of the season, Slytherin vs. Griffindor! Everyone is taking positions, let's have a nice and clean game from all of you!" In no time at all the Snitch was released and everyone was watching it fly around since we couldn't start the game until it was time to start playing. "The snitch has been released, remember whoever catches it wins the game, it's worth 150 points. The Quaffle is released and...the game begins!"
Eventually we somehow ended up in this gigantic lighthouse in the middle of nowhere and everyone was finally getting some sleep but I was busy drawing in the dirt with my finger a cake with the words "Happy Birthday." And in only seconds I could hear Dudley's alarm clock beep to 12:00 am and I was honestly happy enough as it was being able to finally celebrate it. "Make a wish Harry..." Finally blowing out the candles ontop of it; there was a sudden bang and the door flew to the ground while a gigantic man walked through it.
"Malfoy calm down, it's just a girl, why are you getting so pent up?" Looking to the side he was way more than annoyed and I had to kick him in the leg without them noticing while raising an eyebrow at him but it didn't exactly help. "I bet you'd love that wouldn't you Pottah, can't even go down the sidewalk without making the front page!" They were still confused over this whole thing though since Malfoy isn't usually like this which only made me shake my head at him before turning back over towards Ron in hopes that this whole thing would calm down a little bit but it didn't exactly seem to help unfortunately even though I was trying my best.
It was stunning how amazing the gigantic hall In front of me was, it was the biggest room I've seen in my life with dozens of chairs on long and large tables that spread across half of the room and there were candles up above illuminating the room and the decoration of a night sky that it was too stunning and realistic i thought it was impossible. I have a first term year announcements so first years please take note of this, the forbidden forest is off-limits for all students and our caretaker, Mr. Filch wants me to remind you that the third floor corridor on the right-hand size is off-limits too for first years unless you want to die a painful death, thank you."
Stomping away from her, I went looking for Malfoy who was trying to hide himself behind the trophy case, thankfully no one was around at the moment so I quickly leaned down onto the ground and kissed him quickly. "I told you, I'm not going on a date with any girl alright, I told her that I'm not interested in the slightest so don't get the wrong idea."
"It's my fault McGonagall, I've read about the trolls and thought I could handle it, if Ron and Harry hadn't come then I would be dead...I was being reckless and overestimated its actual powers." Hermione said surprisingly, I hadn't expected her to try and cover our backs like that, I'm sure it was hard enough as it was for her to recover from what just happened in the first place. "I'm very dissapointed in you Ms. Granger, you should've known better than to be so reckless and underestimate the power of wild beasts! Ten points will be taken from Griffindor and as for you two...Ten points for each of you due to nothing more than sheer dumb luck, now get back to your dorms."
"Who...owned that wand?" I tried to ask him but he wouldn't answer me and instead said for me to shush. "We do not speak his name. It's not always clear why the wand chooses the wizard but I'm sure we can expect great things from you Mr. Potter." Suddenly breaking us out of our conversations I could see Hagrid outside with a gigantic snowy owl, it was beaming the brightest amount of White I've ever seen that it was absolutely beautiful.
After this gigantic and stunning feast that I could barley fathom, it was time for us to arrive at our dorms which appearantly were separated into different areas in a gigantic room that had stairs that love to move around from left to right and all over. I guess you can't expect the stairs to lay around in the same place all day. Following the advisor, we went down the marble staircase of the entrance hall and to the door that was seen from the right. "This is the entrance most commonly used from Slytherin Students, keep up, don't fall behind beacuse I won't come back for you."
"You actually think I'm actually going to CONSIDER in the slightest about telling anyone we both tripped and accidentally kissed eachother in the worst possible position?! Don't act like an idiot more than you already are!" I yelled at him but he quickly told me to stop yelling or else I'm going to attract the attention of the whole Hogwarts castle. "If you hadn't stolen my Robe non of this would've happened."
Flinging the small item forward just slightly an entire bookcase practically shot out in the middle of nowhere and papers flew everywhere which made me place the wand back onto the table in an instant nervously. "Nope, not a good idea..." Watching him pull out a different wand, it differed largely from the other but I was really hoping I wouldn't destroy something again. Even so, once I gave it a small wave a large flower pot burst to the ground in no time at all. "NOPE definitely not! I wonder..." Once I finally got my next wand, it was long and black but once I waved it nothing actually exploded or teared to shreds this time thankfully.
Harry begs and begs for the Sorting Hat to not put him in Slytherin but the Sorting Hat sees a potential he can not. Already making enemies with Draco Malfoy on the first day, it's difficult for them to get along in the slightest but they begin to learn what it means to fall in love in the worst way possible. Even though Harry tries to pretend he has no actual connection with the Slytherin household, there is no way he can do that so easily with a single chain pulling him straight back known as Draco Malfoy.
"Calm down, and before you say another word, i won't say anything but that's quite a dangerous game you're playing considering who you are. You are the famous 'Boy Who Lived' while you're the famous Draco of the Malfoy family, it might be something difficult to open up due to how much of opposites you two are and due to those that might be judgemental...but eventually you'll need to say something. Also, it doesn't seem obvious just yet for anyone but I would suggest covering up that hickey that is somewhat popping out of your Robe at the edge of your neck Malfoy." The both of us panicking all of a sudden we didn't know about the hickey since we must've completely forgotten or assumed the Hickey would've been covered up by the Robe itself and had no idea what to do but Dumbledore gave us a large bandage that could easily cover it up. "Use this. If you plan to keep that a secret I wouldn't recommend doing this in an easy public eye-view, sneaking out after hours are the best bet you have right...but I'm sure you've already figured that out."
“How did you know I was here?” he asked, pulling out of Harry's arms to be able to speak to them properly. Harry didn’t seem capable of answering—he was breathless, studying Draco’s face as though he had never seen him properly before.
They worked in silence for a few minutes, until Daphne grumbled, “They really could have made these a bit more distinct. Never mind memorizing the bloody things; I spend half my time trying to sort out what it is I’m looking at.”
“Remember when you stopped me from erasing the memory with Ollivander?” Harry said. “The next time we tried, that same memory came up. I think this is how it works.”
“That’s not it. That’s not the point of all this.”
Harry shook his head, smiling. “Don’t trust me. Trust yourself.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. He didn’t dare breathe. Harry’s face was still very pale.
“You really are a terrible liar,” Pansy muttered. Blaise sniggered.
“Well…thanks, mate.” Draco stared at Blaise in alarm—never in their lives had Blaise ever called him “mate” before. He followed Blaise’s gaze over to the Hufflepuff table, where a sandy-haired, freckled boy waved at them. “Fit, isn’t he?”
She giggled. “I guess so.”
Although they were no longer speaking, Harry was suddenly everywhere. Draco tried to ignore the awful pang in his chest whenever they passed each other on the way to class. Although his mouth went dry and his stomach twisted during Potions class as Harry fooled around with Weasley, Draco forced himself not to look up. It was painful enough that they were ignoring each other. What made it worse was that Harry seemed to have forgotten all about him. He spoke loudly with his friends during meals, and he was as lively as ever during their study groups. One evening, when Draco had been walking the grounds alone, he saw Harry and his friends traipsing down to the Quidditch pitch. They were singing some nonsensical tune and laughing uproariously. He remembered Harry’s insistent demand that they play against each other one last time. It felt as though that night at the pub had happened in another lifetime.
“Where’s Kingsley Shacklebolt?” Harry demanded, looking around the room. “Not here, is he?”
He made a face. “Really?”
“You…” Harry had a peculiar look on his face as he blinked at Draco. “Thank you.”
“I’m not like you,” he said once they broke apart. “I’m not brave like you.”
Crying, Draco realized, was cathartic. He had never cried over what had happened with Macnair. Not really. Instead, he had gathered all of the harrowing memories and buried them away. It had been the only way to survive. Severus had asked, of course—and his mother, once, in a very roundabout way that left both of them discomfited. But he had revealed nothing. It was easier to convince himself that he was fine. And that became a habit of his. But now, every sob that spilled out of him seemed to drag along with it another inch of his pain. And Harry was there to catch it all, his arms fiercely tight around Draco as he muttered into his hair. It had been years since he had cried to anyone like this. And it felt good. It was as though he had released a pressure valve—soon he was crying not only because of Macnair, but because of his parents, and his decision to take the Mark, and his orders to kill Dumbledore, and that awful encounter in the bathroom with Harry, and the moment he learned that Severus was dead, and every other little misery that had chipped away at him over the years.
“We’re at the Ministry!" he told the stag. "We need help.” At once, his Patronus dashed off, galloping towards the peacock-blue ceiling and then passing through it.
“Just look.”
“Er…” He didn’t know how to answer. “Not really.”
“Here’s the book I meant to show you,” Draco said, pulling open his satchel. “On nonverbal magic. I’d forgotten about it. I used it loads in fifth year…” As Draco rummaged through his things, his stomach dropped at the sight of his old wand.
“Theo,” he breathed. “What the hell are you doing?”
“I am careful,” Harry said. “I just want to be ready for our first match.”
So that was it. He had done what his father had asked. For all Draco knew, he had just stored an illicit, Dark artifact in his trunk. He would put nothing past his father. Most likely he intended to sell it, or to barter it in some way, but…to what ends? To pay his lawyer fees? To bribe someone on the Wizengamot? Perhaps, Draco thought hopefully, whatever the package held belonged to someone else, and his father could use it as blackmail or as evidence in exchange for his own freedom. It was possible, wasn’t it?
Harry held Draco’s chin and turned his face up so that their eyes met. “Hey,” he said quietly. “You don’t need to feel bad. We’ll work on it.”
“Yes. It is.” He pushed Potter away, gently but firmly, and rearranged his shirt. “Please. I don’t know what’s gotten into you, but…stop. Please. This isn’t funny.”
There was an awkward pause, and then Nott went on to describe his aspirations of working in the Department of Mysteries. Pansy gave Draco a sympathetic grimace; he shrugged. The eighth years continued to discuss their post-Hogwarts plans as he leaned back and scanned the Great Hall. What were his plans? It was one of the many questions that had haunted him all summer. Most Hogwarts students went on to work at the Ministry, but Millicent hadn’t been wrong in suggesting that the Malfoy name was not exactly in good standing there—or most anywhere these days. Everything had been so simple before. He had always been a good student, and Draco and his parents had assumed that following Hogwarts he would take up an important position in the Ministry. Before the Dark Lord’s return, they had enjoyed all kinds of connections. The Manor was always buzzing with friends, family, and important guests visiting his parents. They frequently held parties in the opulent dining room, and they were invited on holidays around the world by his parents’ international contacts. But things had changed. Since the Dark Lord’s defeat, the Manor had seen no visitors. Its dining room remained dark and empty. They received no invitations to travel abroad. His parents had not even discussed with him what this would mean for his career prospects. Perhaps they no longer cared.
“Show me, then.” Potter lay back onto the bed.
“Still stings a bit.”
“Maybe I don’t care.” Potter considered him a moment, and then said, “Why did you come tonight? I thought for sure you wouldn’t.”
“Of course I haven’t,” he said stiffly. In the back of his mind, he thought briefly of Harry, but that didn’t make any sense. Theirs was hardly a new relationship, and anyway, things between them were over.
Theo shrugged. “My uncle used to do them all the time at family dinners. Bit annoying, actually.”
” If he had been stronger, he would have reached for his wand. Instead, feeling rather pathetic, Draco could do little else than scowl at Potter before staggering towards the castle, gripping his Mark.
don’t tell anyone it was me. And…and don’t mention the prefects’ bathroom, okay?”
Harry chuckled. “He won’t kill you. He’s a bit angry over the whole Zabini thing, still. But he’ll get there.”
“What? No.” Draco frowned. “Of course not. Can you imagine Blaise and I together?”
“Potter,” he warned, “I’m going to...”
“I do remember,” Mrs. Parkinson said in her clipped voice.
“Looks like it,” he said moodily.
,” Draco blurted out. “For the first time in forever, I’m happy. Actually happy. It’s a weird, fucked up happiness, because I’m still anxious and having flashbacks and everything else. But I’m happy.”
“He’s down here brooding,” Nott said mockingly. Draco could have sworn he saw Theo’s eyes glance towards the fire, but he was quickly distracted by Pansy, who leaned on him for support.
But Pansy was already talking over him. “I still haven’t found anything, either! I’m so worried! I’ve been through a dozen magazines.” Draco knew it: over the last week, he had given his opinion on what must have been a hundred sets of robes.
“Most of them have a free period tomorrow morning. Don’t you?”
“But Professor Slughorn is my Head of House,” Draco said. He looked over at Harry, who shrugged.
“I guess whenever I bring it to him. He wants me to hold onto it until the holidays, and then they'll escape before his next hearing."
Theo had his arm around the back of Lavender’s chair. He grinned at Blaise. “Slytherin versus Gryffindor. I’ll be sad to miss it.”
Five to nine. Sitting in the relative silence of the common room, he swore he could hear his mother’s voice calling for him. Her cries mingled with those of the people he had seen tortured, maimed, and killed. He stood abruptly, shoved his textbook into his satchel, and then strode out of the common room before he could change his mind. He half hoped he would run into his friends and be forced to change his plans, but he traipsed through the castle undisturbed. As he made his way down the length of the seventh-floor corridor, he wasn’t surprised to see the polished door set into the wall. Grasping the handle, he took a deep breath, and then pushed his way in. The room was different, this time: while still mostly bare, it now held a large, worn couch, on which Potter was sat.
“Right. Sorry.”
“Great. An image I’ll never be able to Scourgify my mind of.”
“All you alright?” Potter asked, following him in. As he shut the door behind them, Draco jumped.
I really thought Muggles were oppressing us, you know, and I thought that was unfair. I thought to myself, well, why should we have to hide? Why do we need all these departments to make sure we’re safe, to make sure the Muggles never find out about us? And…” His voice broke off. Draco took a deep breath, and then continued, “I really believed it. That we’re better. Because…because we’re…”
“Delius Dawson, Mr. Potter, at your service,” he said in a loud, booming voice. He shook Harry’s hand vigorously before turning to Draco. “And this is…?”
“Right,” Draco answered. “Well…parts of the same memory.” When Granger frowned, a puzzled look on her face, he sighed. “It was at the Manor. You know. When the Snatchers found you, and…”
“You don’t know me at all.”
would touch you if they knew you were mine.”
"Mr. Malfoy,” he called. “Where you going?”
“S’unfair,” Draco managed to say.
“I need to go find Harry,” Draco said. “But I’ll remember this. Really, I will. If you hadn’t been here—”
“You’ll be okay,” Harry whispered. “I’m going to touch you. Alright?”
“Hermione came to help,” Harry said. He stood so close that Draco could smell the fresh, clean scent of laundry on him—and then he reached out for Draco’s hand. Wondering if he had just walked into some bizarre hallucination, Draco hesitated before taking Harry’s hand.
Hoping that Harry wouldn’t hear, Draco bit down on his bottom lip, earning himself a gasp. Harry rested his head back on the sofa, eyes unfocused. Sounding almost drunk, he said, “I think I could kiss you forever.”
“The party. Tell me why you went.”
? Ow!” Draco drew his hand away as the owl pecked at him. “What’s your problem?”
Draco had expected this. She would want to talk, of course, without Harry there as a buffer. And that was an uncomfortable prospect.
“What?” Draco laughed. “Are you kidding me? Every year, there’s this big gala on Christmas Eve. It’s awful. I have to spend the entire night talking to a bunch of people I barely know. Other pure-blood families, mostly. Pansy and Blaise will be there…and Nott, too, I guess…”
“You were so scared. It was horrible.”
about Saturday night.”
in the entrance hall,” Potter snapped. “Just meet me there. And don’t tell anyone.”
Very gently, Harry took Draco’s arm and turned it, so that the little blemish of his Mark shone before them. “You can hardly see it.”
“I’m sure.” He eased his wrists out of Harry’s grasp. “I promise, I’m sure.” He gave Harry a firm kiss before lifting his jumper over his arms and tossing it somewhere to the side. Next, he pulled off Harry’s shirt, laughing when it snagged on his glasses.
“You know.” She cleared her throat. “To see your father.”
"And remember when you told Millicent that Marcus Flint had a crush on her? And she was mooning over him for weeks?”
“None of your business.”
“What happened?” he asked.
Lovegood seemed wholly unbothered by their discussion. She was back to surveying the branches as they swayed in the wind.
“Done, I’m done,” Harry said. The moment he took his hand away, Draco cradled his arm against his chest. Little flashes of the memory they had just witnessed leapt before him: Severus’ stern face, his glittering eyes, and the most horrible sense of dread—something terrible had happened.
Draco refused to fly, but he agreed to watch. It was too late and too dark out to practice with a real Snitch, but they found a bag of golf balls in the broomshed, and—after Harry took ten minutes to explain to Draco what golf was—he sat in the stands and threw them for Harry to catch. That proved too easy, so he began to fling them with magic, laughing as Harry pulled off several stunts as he raced around the pitch.
“Is it me? You didn’t want me to see?”
to do anything. But one thing my Healer told me is…you can try to accept it.”
“What is it?” Harry asked.
“You have to let me in,” he said quietly. “Please. Just one little bit at a time.”
He thought that would be the end of McGonagall’s ridiculous internship scheme. And it seemed as though they were content to leave him alone, until that Friday during his Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Proudfoot turned out to be a stern, no-nonsense teacher. Within seconds, he had them on their feet practicing defensive spells with a partner. He paced along the students, correcting, guiding, and offering advice. Draco was paired with Pansy, and he spent much of the lesson explaining to her how to cast a nonverbal Shield Charm. He had expected Proudfoot to avoid him, as most of the other teachers did, but he eventually made his way over to them. Draco stiffened as Proudfoot approached, arms crossed.
“Good! Very good!” Pansy said, reaching up to hug Theo. Lavender turned to Blaise, who looked rather bemused as she hugged him, too.
The Gryffindors had started yelling again, and the sound was driving Draco mad. He needed quiet. It was too loud, much too loud, their shouts echoing in the Great Hall and reminding him of the battle and the way he had kept his ears tuned to every shriek, trying to tell them apart, listening carefully in case it was someone he knew who had fallen—his father, his mother…
“Potter?” Zabini asked. Clearly, he had been listening in.
Potter frowned. “I was looking for—never mind.”
“I don’t know.”
Harry Potter.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “We’ll be gone tomorrow morning, anyway. Just a bit longer.”
Personally, Draco doubted that very much, but he didn’t want to crush Theo’s hopes. “Right. Well, I’ll check with my mother. I know she goes sometimes. She might prefer that I go with her instead. So I’ll…I’ll check,” he finished lamely.
Draco gave a humourless laugh. “Believe me, I’ve tried. Doesn’t help.” After a pause, he said, “You really think this will work? Telling Slughorn I help you in Potions?”
“Er—yeah,” Potter said. He looked surprised. “Yeah. That’s a good idea.”
“But you didn’t, did you?” Draco growled. “Forget it, Potter, I wouldn’t expect you to give a damn about one of us.”
Draco climbed next to Harry, who was reading from a bit of parchment.
“Wonderful! Then it’s settled. I’ll write to you in the spring. In the meantime, I really must be going…Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy…” He shook their hands once more before sauntering off the pitch.
Harry shook his head violently into the crook of Draco’s neck. “You don’t understand,” Harry said bleakly. “I’ll fall apart.”
“Is this about Dean?” Daphne asked suddenly, her face going pink.
he urged him silently.
Harry took Draco's cloak from where it hung on the armrest and held it out. He grabbed it angrily and yanked it over his shoulders. As he found his shoes and pulled them on, Harry sat down.
“The cuts were too deep,” Potter said grimly. "They were too bad to heal, weren't they?"
Potter finally relented, pushing past Draco into the dark confines of the house. Draco cast a quick Drying Charm on himself and headed to the kitchen. It was shabby and cramped. The paint was peeling off from the cupboards, and the stove had two hobs that didn’t work at all. They kept the kettle on one of these broken hobs. Draco tapped it smartly, setting it to boil, as he reached into the cupboard for two mugs. He found the process of preparing tea soothing. Above him, he heard the shower running. He wondered vaguely why Potter hadn’t just used a Drying Charm. Then again, he often preferred to do things the Muggle way—boiling the kettle on the stove, washing their dishes by hand, and tending to his plants without magic. It exasperated Draco to no end. They had been reassured countless times by members of the Order that Potter could use magic here, that the Trace couldn’t locate him, but that didn’t seem to matter.
“But the actual vial, it’s a Portkey.” Draco couldn't meet Harry's gaze. In a terrible way, he felt as though he was betraying his father. “It’s charmed to respond only to his touch. They’re going to use it to escape from the Manor.”
He wasn’t ready to go back. Before he could stop himself, he said, “But will we keep trying? With my Mark?”
Harry was quiet for a moment. “But you don’t mind, right?” he eventually asked. “You went to the party with them, didn’t you?”
“It’s okay, Draco,” Harry murmured. “Can I touch you?” He nodded, and Harry’s hand was on his forehead, smoothing the hair away from his damp face.
Draco looked up at him, startled. “What?”
And with that, Blaise Vanished the empty wrappers off his sheets with a wave of his wand. Draco watched as he sauntered off to the lavatory. His mind was reeling. Of course, he knew that changing his memories wouldn’t change what had happened. He wasn’t an idiot. But a sad, guilty voice nagged at him, wondering if he was getting off easy. Was it fair that he was able to forget the awful things he had done, while those whose lives had been permanently altered—maybe even snuffed out—still bore the marks he had left on them? In some ways, it didn’t seem right.
“Practice.”
“Parvati,” Pansy said promptly. “Padma’s at Hogwarts with us.”
“Yeah, hang on,” Harry said, reaching into his pocket for his wand. He took a deep breath, set back his shoulders, and then: “
“And I’ll never…it doesn’t change anything. Doesn’t change how I think of you. You’re
“Thought you didn’t care,” Potter mused as he rewrote a section of their syllabus.
Draco gave a sharp cry at that, bucking against him. Harry smirked and took hold of his hips, dragging him somehow impossibly closer.
Harry took a step forward. Panicked, Draco pulled out his wand, training it at Harry’s feet. “Don’t make me hex you. Please. Don’t make me.”
“Of course she is,” Pansy said, recovering. “I’m just surprised, that’s all.”
Draco looked up as Blaise stopped speaking. He quickly realized why: Harry was standing in front of him, Potions kit in one hand, cauldron in the other.
“I’m fine. Potter just likes to play the hero and put on a show. I don’t know why you’re all making such a big deal out of this.”
“Er…” Blaise scanned the box. “Treacle tart, I think.” As he turned back to the magazine, Draco carefully set the little bonbon aside.
Every time the holly wand touched his Mark, Draco bristled. All he could smell was rain, thick and musky as it seeped out of the ground to embrace them. In the forest, they couldn’t see the castle’s lights. It was easy, nestled among the trees, to forget where they were at all. They sat together on the grass, and although it was still damp, they were comfortable enough: Potter had conjured a thick crimson blanket. Potter had taken care of it. Potter took care of everything. Draco stretched out, holding his sleeve up from his Mark even though every last nerve in his body urged him not to. Never mind that it was dark out, that they both had to squint to make out the Mark’s inky black form. Revealing it felt like a particularly brutal form of masochism. He had considered, more than once, cutting off his arm, but it wouldn’t have mattered. The Mark was
“I don’t want to push you,” he said.
Draco looked up to see Blaise and Pansy staring at him. Irritated now, he rolled his eyes. “What difference does it make?”
“It’s in my trunk upstairs.”
Draco’s mother had tricked him again—Wednesday morning, her eagle owl swept across the Slytherin table, dropping a roll of parchment neatly on his lap. He could not have imagined a worst way to sour his already miserable mood. The nightmares that had haunted him over the summer were back with a vengeance: dark, shifting rooms, bright flashes of green light, and painfully cold fingers trailing across his cheeks. After several nights of tossing and turning, he was exhausted.
As his father’s head popped into the flames promptly at two o’clock, Draco felt a strange mixture of relief and dread. He had spent a long, miserable evening praying that everyone would vacate the common room. The eighth-year Slytherins had been almost impossible, lounging on the sofas and playing endless games of chess. Finally, Draco had taken inspiration from his letter and suggested they all head to Hogsmeade. By some miracle, they listened, leaving him to enjoy the silence of the common room as the younger students slowly headed off to bed.
didn’t have to do anything…
Potter smirked but said nothing. Grasping the base of his cock, he smoothed his lips along the head, kissing and sucking lightly. He suddenly hit a spot that caused Draco to gasp and tighten his grip in Potter’s hair.
“You’re fine.” Draco waved his hand, dismissing him. “I don’t want to see it, either.”
“That’s going too far. You know it.”
“I keep telling you, we’re doing too much at once,” Potter growled. “You need a break in-between. When Hermione and I—” He broke off and looked away.
looking his way, peering over at the Slytherin box with a little smile on his face. He wondered whether Harry had thought at all about their last meeting in the forest, because he certainly had. In fact, he couldn’t seem to concentrate on much else. He studied Harry’s gloved hands as they grasped his broomstick, remembering the way Harry had hugged him. Something very warm poured through him, and he tried to focus on Vaisey as he sped past with the Quaffle, but it was so difficult when Harry was right there.
Blaise, you can help me decide which shoes to bring.”
“I have no idea. Away from here. Somewhere far away, where nobody knows who I am. Where I’m something other than Lucius Malfoy’s son.” He gave a cold, bitter laugh. “God, what an idiot he is. And so am I, for following him all these years.”
She screamed even louder, pushing him so hard he nearly fell off the bench.
Harry turned the iron handle and pushed through. Draco nearly ran into him as he froze in the doorway.
“Draco?” he heard Pansy ask. “Draco, what is it?”
Draco wanted to say more, wanted to push Potter into
“Mmm?”
“Alright, then, tell me this.” Pansy leaned back on the bench, appraising him. “What’s happened between you and Blaise? And don’t lie.”
the spell coming out of your wand. If you're Summoning something,
As the class settled, Harry turned to Draco, studying him. “Are you alright?”
“The Dementor’s Kiss…I agree with Shacklebolt, it’s too far. There’s never a reason for that. Not even for…”
Potter sat back and looked at him appraisingly. Draco had the uncomfortable sense that he was being evaluated. Casting around for a distraction, he asked, “What time is it?”
“Well, anyway,” Blaise said, breaking the silence in a weary tone, “my mother did have some good news. Your father’s lawyers will be appealing soon, and they think they have good odds.”
“I have no idea. She’s pissed.”
“But I don’t—I don’t understand.”
Draco snorted. “Should you be so lucky.”
The fingers within him stilled. “Are you sure?”
“‘He?’” Draco asked suspiciously.
“Right, hang on.” Very gently, Harry set him down onto the bench, and then folded the board and assembled the chess pieces. He threw the lot into Draco’s bag. And then he was back at Draco’s side, lifting him up and helping him out of the Great Hall. When Draco saw that he was leading him to the dungeon, he pulled back.
For a moment, Potter said nothing, staring down at Draco’s hand in surprise. Then, finally, he muttered, “I agreed to help you with your Mark. Not to fuck up your memories, or…or whatever else this is.”
“Erm…I haven’t had one since Potions.”
But Draco could hardly hear him. There was an awful roaring sound in his ears as the scene flashed before him—Granger screeching as his aunt ripped back her hair…Potter blinking up at him, face swollen and almost unrecognizable…his parents’ wild eyes, urging him to do the right thing, incapable of telling him what the right thing
sort of funny, but—” Lavender glanced up, and then her face broke into a big smile. “Hermione!”
“Does it really matter? It’s done now. Everyone’s fine. What good does it do us to sort out who’s at fault and who isn’t?” Proudfoot tucked the jar back under his cloak, and then said, “No, after that little spat, I’m far more concerned with you.”
No. He couldn’t go. There was no point in it. He had nothing to say to his mother. Nothing at all. And he had even less to say to his father. He knew his mother well enough to know that she would expect him to come to the Manor for dinner, and perhaps stay the night, never mind that he had class tomorrow. And she would probably convince him, too, because he was rarely able to refuse her.
“Goodbye, Callidus,” Daphne called as the eagle owl spread his great wings and took off for the Owlery.
“Blaise and Pansy,” Harry said as he examined Draco’s Mark. “They fight a lot.”
“Travers,” Potter said. “And Macnair.”
“Draco.” Pansy tried to stop him, but he untangled his hand from hers, hurrying back up the lawn. “Listen to me. This is an awful idea. You look so
He hadn’t. Not really. His dreams had been filled with terrible, haunting eyes and a brutal voice urging him to be quiet. But he didn’t want to reveal that to Granger. Instead, he merely shrugged. Harry frowned and opened his mouth to speak, but fortunately, Granger cut him off.
“Yeah.” Draco rubbed the last few tears off his face and straightened out his cloak. He ran his fingers through his hair, trying to tidy up the long strands. “Anyway. Sorry about that. And don’t bother contacting the Ministry. I think you’ve done enough for my family.”
“Here.” He passed the pouch to Harry. “Open it.”
“You’re fine.” Draco reached out and held her wrist. “You spoke to Potter, right?”
“I don’t know why she offered to host,” Pansy sighed.
They heard Pansy before they saw her—she was tugging her parents towards their table. Mr. Parkinson looked as irritable as ever, his little black moustache twitching as he frowned, while Mrs. Parkinson readjusted her pink, feathered hat. Suddenly, Draco had an idea. As his mother stood to greet the Parkinsons, he leaned towards Harry.
No more nonsense.
“Are you sure?”
“Well.” She took a moment to ponder his question, and then said, “You’ll have to remember again. And then work through them. That’s what my father did.”
Harry said nothing but instead ran his fingers through Draco’s hair. They lay like that until finally, Draco gave in to his drowsiness. For the first time in months—probably years—he slept deeply, hardly dreaming.
“For God’s sake,” Draco snapped, stepping towards him. “You don’t listen—that’s your problem.” He reached out and gripped Potter shoulders, pushing them down. “
“We’re almost done.” Draco nodded towards his arm. “I’ll be fine. Go on.”
Sniggering, Nott shot back, “Mostly by you, no doubt.”
“Do you think we’ll get the same one?” Harry asked quietly. “The same memory?”
“Stop.” Putting everything into words like this, it was too much. That same sense of panic that Potter was describing bubbled beneath the surface, but Draco worked hard to ignore it, lest it overwhelm him completely.
He blinked back innocently. “What? Are these not the right ingredients?”
“Can you…” He felt himself blushing. “I don’t know how to cast a Patronus. A corporeal one. And I want to learn before the lesson on Thursday."
“Did it? Then why did you—”
—both pleased and dismayed him. In his confusion, he chose once again to lash out. “Great. First rule of being my friend: leave me the fuck alone.”
“That Portkey. And the Ministry have ways of getting people to talk, as you well know…”
Harry gave a short bark of laughter, burying his face into his hands. “Oh, Draco,” he moaned, shaking his head. “Of course, you can stay here.”
Draco looked up at him. “What do you mean?”
going back to that dormitory.”
“I’m…alright.” He pulled up his sleeve and looked down at his Mark. It hadn’t changed. “It was like being asleep, I guess. But not really. I was just sort of daydreaming.”
“Why? He was staring at you the entire match.”
“Have some,” Pansy said, holding up the bottle to him. She had squeezed herself in-between the sink and the wall, in what Draco thought was a rather ridiculous position.
“But you aren’t.” Dismissing him, Theo returned to his textbook, tapping his quill on the page so violently that a hole had started to form.
“Okay.” Embarrassed at his own hysteria, Draco glanced away. “Okay. Right.”
“That’s alright,” Harry said. “We’ve only got an hour.”
“Fine,” he growled, scrubbing aggressively at a spot on the worktable.
Draco ignored him, pulling on a fresh shirt as quickly as he could.
“Of course I’m sure. I don’t say things unless I’m sure.”
There it was. The crux of the matter. “I think about my mother. All the time. Every fucking day I’m here, I think of her.”
His father’s mouth snapped shut. They glared at each other, Draco’s heart pounding. Finally, he saw fear creep into his father’s eyes. “And why,” he said, so quietly that Draco had to strain to hear him, “would Harry Potter tell
“Should we try to bring him back to Hogwarts?” Weasley asked Harry, ignoring Pansy.
“Come on, then, gentlemen,” Proudfoot said cheerily, as though nothing had happened. They followed him to his office, Draco feeling incredibly uncomfortable as he walked next to Harry in silence. There was an awkward moment when Proudfoot opened the door and motioned for them to enter; they both eyed each other, unsure who should go first, until Proudfoot chuckled and said, “Go on, go on, I don’t keep anything dangerous in there.” Harry scowled at Draco and then brushed past him into the office. Glancing over at Proudfoot, who was still smiling amicably, Draco slipped in after him.
Draco rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands. “And what’s Potter mean, then?”
” But Harry’s eyes were fixed on Madam Webb, a grim expression on his face.
Draco.”
“I’m fine, I’m fine,” Draco grumbled. “He didn’t even do anything to me. Just pushed me around a bit.”
and yet obstructed by several layers of clothes. He wanted to see Potter, see all of him, more desperately than ever. But before he could complain again, Potter was licking down his stomach, shifting so that he sat on Draco’s legs. Draco trailed his hands back to Potter’s hair, tugging whenever he did something he liked: dipped his tongue across the contours of his hips, rubbed his hands along his thighs, sucked hard on the space just below his navel.
“Is that what this is?” he demanded, glaring at her. “You’re just trying to corner me?”
“I’ll be fine,” Draco teased him. “Wait for me here.” He pressed
Harry lifted Draco’s hand and brought it to his mouth. He grazed his lips across the pale knuckles. It was utterly captivating, the way his skin dragged against Harry’s lips. And, foolish though he felt, he couldn’t help the thought that their fingers looked as though they were meant to be intertwined, that they fit together so easily as Harry entangled them.
“Of course. Otherwise what’s the point?”
“Of all the things…the Headmistress will have my head,” he heard Slughorn cry as he sped down the corridor and up the stairs to the entrance hall. He pushed past the double doors and inhaled deeply as the cool air hit his face. His aunt’s harsh, manic face still haunted him and so he walked, bent against the wind, hands deep in his pockets. He could have done a simple Warming Charm, but the cold cut through his memories and seemed to dissipate them. He wound his way around the lake, watching as the wind whipped up the rough water. He knew classes had ended when he heard laughter coming from the castle—looking over, he saw a few students streaming out onto the grounds, no doubt looking to enjoy some fresh air before nightfall. As the sun started to set and everyone else went back in for dinner, Draco sat by the lake. The ground was hard and cold, and so he relented and cast a Warming Charm. By now his thoughts had slowed, but he still couldn’t bring himself to head back to the castle. He was contemplating whether or not he could sleep outside under the stars, with the cool air to comfort him—whether that would be safe, whether anyone would even notice or care—when he heard someone walking up behind him.
Noticing my Robe was gone, I was confused beacuse I never placed it somewhere else so where could it have gone in the first place, it doesn't make sense. "Looking for this Pottah?" Said a mischievous and irritating voice from the side of my ear. Standing against the door way with my Robe, Malfoy was already up to his usual tricks and I couldn't help myself from scratching my head in annoyance. "I wonder what the Professors will think when they see you in nothing more than your underwear around school; no worries I'll give it back, after you've become known as the school streaker."
"They are nasty little buggers, you would make a fair beater though; that was a Bludger, the Beaters keep the Bludger away from the other players. But you are a seeker, the only thing I want you to focus on is this tiny golden ball, the golden snitch, it flies at the speed of lightning, you'll barley even see it. If you can catch it before the other team Seeker and the game is over Potter, Griffindor will win."
"You knew?! And you never told me?!" I yelled at them which only made Aunt Patinua frustrated about this whole thing but I was no different towards them and it was obvious from head to toe. "Of course we knew! How could you have not been, did you ever think about all those strange things that kept happening with only you but no one else? My so-called perfect sister being known as who she was, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter, better than all the rest. Yes, we have a witch in the family, isn't it just 'so' wonderful? Except I was the only one to see her for who she ACTUALLY was; a freak!! Then she met that 'potter' and then birthed you, I knew in that instant you would be just like here, strange, abnormal, just another freak; then she got herself blown up and we were stuck with you!"
I wondered if he knew about last night somehow, but there was no one around so how is that possible...? He eventually left and we made sure it was completely patched up before whispering to eachother best as we could so no one could hear us in the slightest and as much as i was relieved Dumbledore wouldn't tell anyone, he was right about how difficult this would be to admit. It isn't just about being gay, we also have our pride from the billions of people that know our name and would judge us. "There's no way we could let people know about our relationship, how could we? It's like our entire lives depend on it."
"Hmmm....well....we'll take the hole lot." I told her while pulling out just a little bit of the practical golden bits of money I had which stunned Ron it seems since he probably doesn't get things like that everyday. While we munched on the different delectable treats infront of us, he was telling me about the beans of 'every single flavor' and I mean every single flavor...ranging from peppermint to boogey flavored ones....so I decided to stray away from them. Once I opened my Chocolate Frog though it was apparently alive somehow and ended up jumping out of the window, but the card is what I actually wanted apparently. "I got Dumbledore!"
"Seriously?! I've never heard of any house members fighting against their own house in Quidditch, Griffindor really must be desperate, you must be the youngest Quidditch player so far too, other than Malfoy. I don't know if you knew but he was recommended as a team seeker for Slytherin after you left but he hasn't gotten a response yet, since the game is today he'll most likely be who you're against."
Pinning him against the wall, I let my lips trace along the sides of his neck bit by bit before licking across that thin skin without any hesitation which was definitely turning him on with each slippery curve and flowing sensation. "Don-Don-Don't-Nggghh..." Sucking on his skin gently, I finally found my way across his neck towards his shoulder and my fingertips were running up his Robe which was definitely making him blush. "P-Pottah...Ngghh..." Bit by bit I was able to get his Robe off of him while letting my fingers assult his cold skin from the nipples to the edges of his thighs. Twisting, rubbing, pulling, and much more was increasing by the minute until he couldn't stop himself from moaning until it was practically impossible to stop his senses running wild and mine practically felt on fire too.
After a little while of sitting by myself the same red-head came over to my pair of seats for the train. "Do you mind? Everyone else is taken..." Not minding at all, he sat down happily and introduced himself while I did the same. "So it's true, do you really have the...you know the scar...?" Nodding my head with a smile he was watching it in admiration before a cart full of goodies came over asking if we wanted anything. "Wicked...."
"I'm exauhsted..." I told Malfoy who couldn't help agreeing with me once we finally got back to our dorms and parted for the night but before I could walk away, Malfoy gave me a small kiss on the cheek before quickly running towards his room with his face burning up a bright pink. I really couldn't understand what it was about him that I liked in the slightest but there was just something about him that I couldn't place my finger on. He was nothing more than egotistical bully but when we are alone, he's like some sort of attract idiot, even if we fight I find myself way more than attracted at the exact same time the exact moment we are.
he definitely seems sorta strange though.
Seeing Fred and George walking up besides us, theyvlooked excited. "Hey there Harry, Wood just told us, we're on the team too as beaters, our job is to make sure YOU don't get bloodied up too bad...no promises though, rough game Quidditch. It's absolutely brutal but don't worry no one has died in years, someone might turn up vanishing all of a sudden but they usually turn up in a month or two." The two were telling me and I was honestly not becoming as cheerful about it and more wanting to grasp onto my actual life...rather than die a painful death.
All of a sudden a young boy with slicked back blonde hair came over to us; rolling his eyes at Ron for some reason, he turned over to me. "I thought I heard the name of Harry Potter, my name is Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. Judging by the scar on your forehead it seems the rumors were true, you really are going to Hogwarts this year, Harry Potter; seems you're going to do a spell are you? Why not show me then how it works Muggle-born." I could easily see Ron was becoming more and more irritated but i didn't understand why since Draco seemed to be nice enough so far that is.
"Sorry bout' that." He said before fixing the door back into its usual position. It didn't take him long to find where I was at and handed me a small cake. "I might've sat on it at one point but I imagine it'll taste all the same, baked it myself words and all! Not every day your young man turns eleven is it, eh?" It was more amazing than I expected, it had beautiful green words that said "Happy Birthday Harry" with a strawberry coating of frosting.
“NO.” Draco sat up. He was neither here nor there—the trees mixed in with the paneled walls of the drawing room—the nighttime sounds around them bled into the echoes of his aunt’s shrieks, Greyback’s howling—Harry’s hand on his arm slipped against his mother’s as she pulled him away—
Harry did as he requested, drawing out before cautiously filling him once more.
Pansy sighed, deflated. “Great. Maybe that’s been the problem.”
“Ah…” Harry scrunched up his nose as he tried to remember. Draco felt a twinge in his chest and looked away angrily; it was such a stupid thing to be upset at, but those little quirks and faces had become familiar to him. “We were going to wrap up the term with Patronuses. I know it’s advanced magic, but we thought it would be fun for them to try. Something to work on over the holidays.”
Pansy opened her mouth to respond, but she was interrupted by Blaise’s sudden arrival. They shifted over to make room for him as he squeezed onto the bench.
“I’ll come with you,” Blaise said, slipping out of his chair.
“Why don’t we go now? Slughorn is probably in his office. Come on.”
, damn you.”
Harry came to stand by the Pensieve, peering into it.
“—out of your mind that easily. Where are your defences? You said you would work on them.”
“It’s fine.” Another flash of anger shot through him. He couldn’t stand Potter’s sympathy. He just couldn’t. Still dizzy, Draco forced himself up. His knees nearly buckled, sending him wobbling dangerously in Potter’s direction, but he managed to right himself.
Potter checked his watch. “Nearly five.”
regarding Mr. Nott’s hearings, but he couldn’t be bothered. Instead, they sat in misery together at breakfast as the others rifled through the paper, talking loudly about the ongoing trials.
“If I don’t like something, I’ll tell you. If I want you to stop, I’ll tell you.”
“You still support it, then? Anti-Muggle sentiment?”
“Right.”
“Hi.” He continued to stare at Granger.
“I don’t know!” He couldn’t understand why Blaise was interrogating him. Not even Pansy had been this difficult. “Just…different things. I can’t remember, obviously. But Harry’s told me some of them.” Uncomfortable, he looked away. “Watching someone die. Fixing the cabinet. That sort of thing.”
As they set off in search of his friends, Draco muttered, “My mother takes ages to leave, anyway.  So we could be waiting until after midnight before she finally says goodbye.”
“Oh, please don’t cry,” Draco said. His own chest tightened in empathy. “If you cry, I’ll cry, and I look awful when I cry.”
“I’m okay. We’ve done this before, remember? Two memories in one night. And it was fine.”
Potter work next to you in Potions?”
As Harry gathered his things, Proudfoot said, “I’ll come for you later, Mr. Potter.” At the skeptical look on Harry’s face, he chuckled. “I promise to return Mr. Malfoy to you perfectly unscathed.”
“You think Bill suspected something?” he went on. “You think he realized you’re fucking me every night?” Potter rolled his hips forward; Draco gasped. “You think he has any idea how many times I’ve had your cock in me? How much I’ve liked it?”
“No, don’t move him just yet.” Luna Lovegood was now kneeling next to him. She hummed to herself as she leaned forward to study his face. “Oh, that’s why. You can see it in his eyes.”
“I told him in my last letter.” Draco took another sip of tea and then added, “The Harpies are the ones to look out for this year.”
“Do you think you’ll ever go see your father?”
“He didn’t do anything.” Harry sat back, considering him. Finally, he said, “He wanted to do…he wanted to do something terrible to you, didn’t he? Something…something really bad…”
Unmoved as ever, Potter shrugged. “Fine. I’ll see you then.”
“Wait—you need to listen to me. Whatever you did—”
“Hi.”
“Draco thinks he’s better than us,” Pansy said. “He practically told me so. And he warned me off you, Theo. Because you still believe in pure-blood supremacy.”
Draco winced as Pansy dug into his arm. Harry had surged forward, sweeping past Coote and rounding a bend. Lovegood hadn’t even seemed to notice—she was busy describing the method for detecting a Wrackspurt—but all around them people were shouting as they watched Harry tear after the Snitch. Harper was at the other end of the pitch—he had no chance, no chance at all of catching up—Harry had stretched out his hand, and he was flat against his broom, and Draco’s heart was pounding in his chest—
“God.” He couldn’t help it—the sight of Harry’s hand on him, combined with the awed look on his face, did all sorts of things to him. Harry stroked again, more firmly this time, and he had just seemed to fall into a rhythm when he leaned forward and took Draco’s cock in his mouth. The unexpectedness of it, along with the wet heat of Harry’s mouth, caused him to cry out. He tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair, rocking his hips as Harry hummed around him. He pulled off, and Draco feared for a moment that he hadn’t liked it, but then he began to lick from the base of his shaft to the tip, as though testing Draco’s reactions. And he had plenty of them: he bucked up when Harry sucked the tip of his cock, he made a keening noise when Harry ran his tongue against the slit.
In comparison to the long summer days that had crept by at a torturous pace, Draco’s first morning back at Hogwarts was frantic. He woke later than the others, and he had very little time to dress and pack his satchel before rushing up to the Great Hall to grab the last slice of toast remaining. Almost everyone else had gotten their timetables. As he poured himself some tea, Slughorn strolled down the length of the Great Hall towards him.
, Draco? My God, you’re obsessed. You can’t think of anything else.”
“Surely you’re good at everything, Potter,” he said, watching as a sixth-year Hufflepuff turned her cushion from green to orange.
“And you slept okay? After last night?”
“You’re going to tell him, right?”
“Sure.”
Draco felt as though a heavy stone had settled into the bottom of his stomach. Forcing his face into a neutral expression, he said, “Alright. And so…what’s your prediction?”
Draco leaned over the side of the blanket, fearing he would be sick. But it never came. Nauseous, dizzy, he held himself up with one trembling arm, blinking away the tears in his eyes. He was certain he had never felt so sick before.
Pansy reached out and took his hand in hers. Surprised, Draco scoffed. “I’m fine. It’s not me you should be worrying about. But, I just…I don’t know. You can’t see that sort of thing and not be changed.”
She made a face at him. “Very funny.” They were quiet for a moment as two Ravenclaw girls passed by. They were loudly discussing a friend of theirs who had set his parchment on fire in Charms. “Alright, then,” Pansy said, turning to him. She spoke in that businesslike tone Draco had come to fear. “I’ve got a bit of gossip we can discuss. Where are you disappearing to at night?”
“Your plans? For once you leave Hogwarts?”
Harry chuckled. He was rubbing his thumb against Draco’s knuckles. “You’re so stubborn.”
Draco turned to find his mother standing at the bottom of the stairs. The expression on her face was oddly vacant.
“What? No.” Draco set his jaw stubbornly.
“Er, I saw you head into the library.” Potter stood frozen, apparently shocked at his reaction. “We need to talk about our first lesson on Thursday.”
"Get out of here!”
“I asked earlier if you were cold,” Harry grumbled. Before Draco knew what was happening, Harry unbuttoned his cloak and then pulled his navy jumper over his head. His hair was now untidier than ever. “Here.” He offered Draco his jumper.
“Yeah, yeah, fine,” Harry said, already heading back towards the stairs. They hurried down to the third floor, where Goldstein led them to an empty classroom by the Charms corridor. Draco had never been in this room before; in the dark, he could just make out a single dilapidated armchair shoved into a corner. Against the wall stood an enormous stone fireplace. Goldstein rushed over and picked up a small bowl of Floo powder set on the mantle. Turning to them, he offered it.
“No. It can’t be.”
He hovered just on the edge of that descent into tight, hot tension that signaled the point of no return. He wanted so badly to come, to feel Potter take him over that edge, but he seemed to be in no hurry. Potter was rubbing Draco at a torturously slow pace, occasionally dipping down to press soft kisses against his lips. It occurred to Draco that he could always just reach down and undress himself, but that didn’t really feel like an option. It was as though he was watching the scene unfold from somewhere above them, helpless to do much more than take it as Potter gave him both too much and not nearly enough at all.
Potter rearranged himself, and then took a deep breath. “Three…two…one…”
“What do you want me to say?” he snarled. “My parents are miles away, and they’ve just gotten probably the worst news of their lives, and I’m not even there with them. There’s nothing I can do, Po—Harry. Nothing. And you know what the best part is?” He couldn’t stop himself—his eyes were welling up with tears. His voice shook as he said, “He deserves it. He fucking deserves it, doesn’t he? Maybe
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not doubting Granger’s aptitude, Potter, don’t worry.” He held the vial up to his eyes. “I just…” He wondered where she had found the time. And why she had bothered to help him. “What happens once I take it?”
“I was so excited…finally, I have some options, you know? And then I go and ruin everything.”
“At least we could mix it up. Ravenclaw colours one time, Slytherin the next, you know…”
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy snapped. “He just wants to see you, that’s all. Why do you always have to be so difficult?”
“Get off me,” he snarled.
“Still. Good to send a strong message at the start of the term, don’t you think?”
Unsure of what to say, Draco mumbled, “Yes, sir.”
“But—but
“You need to listen to me,” Draco cut him off. He nearly cowered at the furious look on his father’s face, but he pressed on. “I don’t know when the others will be back. And you need to hear this.”
“You know I’d be happy to tell them all to piss off.”
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Yeah. Everyone’s probably asleep, though, so let’s see what we can find…” They had barely taken a step forward when they heard a door burst open at the far end of the room. Two house-elves came spilling out: one of them had bulbous eyes and great, bat-like ears, while the other was perhaps the oldest house-elf Draco had ever seen. They both wore neat little uniforms.
“For God’s sake,” Draco snarled, grabbing him—Brookes, he swore his surname was Brookes—by the arm and dragging him out of earshot.
Draco snorted. She was right—he had seen some spectacular arguments between the two of them.
“Oh. Er. Right.” Draco looked away in embarrassment; he hadn’t thought to buy them anything.
Draco snorted. “Because she’s angry.”
a good teacher, Draco.” He snorted. “I’m being serious. I’ve learned loads from you this year. We all have. You’re not the most…er…nurturing person, but look how far everyone’s come thanks to you. Last week, the way you explained nonverbal Switching Spells to me…I finally got it. You make me feel like I can actually manage it.”
Draco shut his eyes. There, on the edges of his consciousness, he thought he could see Macnair’s face, hovering over him. But it was slipping away, like water dribbling through his fingers. And he was grateful for that. “Not really. It’s fading.”
“And what about you, then?” Pansy asked.
Draco’s mouth went dry. There was something tender in Potter’s voice and he didn’t know how to react.
“Because they’ll make me feel it,” he said in a low voice. “Feel everything I don’t want to feel. I can’t. I really, really can’t.”
The Three Broomsticks was busy, but they spotted Theo right away. He stood as Pansy rushed towards him, flinging her arms around his neck. Something about the pub made Draco instantly uncomfortable—perhaps the hot, stuffy air, or the noise, or the press of bodies against his as he waded towards Theo’s table near the bar.
“For your friends,” Draco said. “We can wear them to your games.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “I don’t know.”
“Draco.” He vaguely remembered the bloke in front of him—sandy blonde hair, brown eyes framed by thick lashes. Slightly taller than himself. A Ravenclaw seventh year. His name had been…Brown? Barry?
“Anytime.” Potter spoke as if nothing was odd, as if they were two mates at the pub and he had just bought him a drink.
Draco blinked at him innocently. “Nothing’s going on.”
“Come to breakfast tomorrow morning. You know Daphne spoils you.”
Draco nearly choked on his beer. Ignoring Harry’s grin, he suddenly became very interested in the wood grain of the table.
“Listen,” Harry said, drawing up next to him and leaning on the statue of Boris the Bewildered as he tried to catch his breath. “Anthony—your internship—”
At that, Draco sighed dramatically. “No more peaceful room in Diagon Alley. No more nights to ourselves. No more meals together. Why are we going back, again?”
“It’s hot out,” Potter moaned, slumping back in his chair. “Let’s go inside.”
“That’s one of the things Hermione said to absolutely
All three of them looked up as Harry came to stand beside Blaise, hands in his pockets. In sharp contrast to Pansy, who was gaping up at him, flabbergasted, Harry had an easy smile on his face. When nobody spoke, Harry said again, “I’ll go with you. To see Slughorn.”
“How are we supposed to teach years five through eight, anyway? They’re all at different levels. This is so stupid.”
“Well.” Draco tried to keep his tone as neutral as possible as he said, “You could stay here with me. At Hogwarts.”
“Don’t say that,” Harry whispered. Draco winced at the hurt in his voice. “You’re here. That’s what matters.”
“Are you okay? Does it hurt?”
“Can I?” Potter asked, grabbing hold of his waistband.
Ignoring her, he said, “Rook to E4. Check.”
They joined the other Slytherins and were about to leave when Potter called, “Hey, Malfoy!”
“No. They’re perfect.”
“Who’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at one of the portraits.
“Gryffindor colours?” she sneered. “Really? I’ll leave that to you.”
“Yes, I’ll have to thank her for that sometime.”
Taking advantage of Proudfoot’s confusion, Draco pulled out his own wand. “You don’t want to take on us both,” he warned him. “Go. And tell my father I can look after myself, thanks.”
“It’s still not the same,” Potter insisted.
“Ron.”
Weasley complied and slid down several empty mugs. As Potter filled each one, they sat in silence, eyeing each other warily. Suddenly, Potter said, “Wait, Draco needs a glass. Come with me.”
“With who? For what?”
Flourish and Blotts was filled to bursting. The air smelled deliciously of cinnamon and cloves; the packed shelves were strung with glittering garlands. As Blaise hunted down the book for his mother, Draco and Theo perused the latest titles.
“Fuck, it burns.” His arm felt as though it had just been doused in Fiendfyre.
Fortunately, there were many people to meet: Daphne was there, eager to draw him into a long hug. She didn’t seem surprised at all to see Harry. She simply hugged him as well, asking which N.E.W.T.s he was sitting and whether Granger and Weasley had returned to Hogwarts as well. And then they were pulled aside by the Fawleys, who shook Harry’s hand profusely and asked about his plans after Hogwarts. By the time they had managed to drag themselves away, Blaise’s mother was calling for dinner.
“Draco? Are you alright?”
“Sir,” he said curtly. Finished his meagre breakfast, he rose from the table, and made to check his timetable for the first class of the day.
He had started to spend more time sitting in the Quidditch stands. Up in the Slytherin box, he was shielded from the few students who braved the cold to walk through the grounds. Occasionally, he heard the sounds of Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures classes. From the dismayed screams and Hagrid’s insistent shouts that they stay calm, Draco suspected that he had unleashed Blast-Ended Skrewts upon another unsuspecting group of students. Safely concealed in the stands, Draco stared out at the pitch for hours, endlessly mulling things over. Sometimes, he went through his satchel, which now contained his old wand, his father’s pouch, and—he was embarrassed to admit—the Chocolate Frog card Daphne had given him in Hogsmeade. He had started to think of his satchel as the Bag of Sad Things. When he was feeling particularly masochistic, he would take out the card and study the small picture of Harry. Harry gazed fiercely back at him. He told himself repeatedly to just toss the stupid card: if Nott or Zabini found it in his bag, they would never let him hear the end of it. But in a strange way, Draco felt as though the card belonged there next to his old wand and his father’s vial. They formed a growing collection of reminders of his many failures.
“And where did he touch you?”
Emboldened by Harry’s support, Pansy slapped her hand down onto the table. Their bottles shook ominously. “Exactly! What does it matter? You have to finish your N.E.W.T.s, Draco.”
“What did Trelawney say about your reading, Pansy?” he asked, tapping his quill absently in the margins of his book. “The one you did for Draco?”
Again, Potter shook his head. He was pulling off his shirt. Draco helped him, lifting the material past Potter’s arms and casting it aside. He swallowed hard. Potter was thin, sinewy, tanned.
Eventually, even their Warming Charms couldn’t break through the cold, and they decided to head back inside. As they landed, Millicent complained loudly that she was sore. Draco hardly heard her—he felt better than he had in days, as though his worries had been swept away by the brisk wind. In the changing room, Nott yammered away about the work he was doing with Flitwick. It had been too cold out to really work up a sweat, but the warm shower was wonderful on Draco’s frozen skin. For a moment, it felt like the old days. Playing Quidditch, teasing each other in the changing room, making plans for the weekend.
“They’re getting on in Transfiguration, aren’t they?”
“I don’t want to push you.”
,” Harry urged him. “I know who you are.”
“Relax,” he reminded him. “You’re so tense again. Haven’t you remembered anything from last time?”
Draco could feel that Harry was hard beneath him, and it drove him mad. He pushed his hips forward, smirking as Harry swore under his breath.
“No, thank you,” Harry said. “We’ll get out of your way.”
“It is!” he insisted. “Tell them about that wizard trying to get to Gibraltar, the one with the funny cat.”
Sitting in the common room, Draco had abandoned his Potions book completely, and instead was staring at his wristwatch as it ticked away. Ten minutes until nine. He was restless: one moment he sat cross-legged, book in his lap, the next he was sprawled out on the couch, head resting on a pillow, until he moved again and sat up straight, feet planted on the ground. Distracted, he kept looking around the room. In a far corner, a group of second years were playing Exploding Snap. The upper-year students kept closer to the fireplace. Most of them were studying, though a few, including some fifth years Draco didn’t know, were speaking in hushed tones. The other eighth-year Slytherins had gone to the library; Draco was surprised they weren’t back yet. More than likely they had stopped by the kitchens, or else had found somewhere to drink the firewhisky Nott had brought back from Hogsmeade.
Potter was suddenly very occupied with scrubbing his hands. Recognizing his cue to leave, Draco scurried upstairs to his bedroom, crawling into bed and trying to ignore the voice in his head whispering
over each other at the Three Broomsticks,” she said, face twisting with disgust. “She didn’t even warn us, either. He met us there and next thing you know, they’re snogging right in front of us.”
“You don’t need to go shouting my business for half the castle to hear.” They stood inside a hidden alcove, only a few inches apart.
disgusting. Fuck, that’s not what I meant…you have to know that’s not what I meant…”
As though Weasley had heard him, he looked up, scowling at him over his mug.
Draco took another step forward, and then he crouched down so that their eyes were level. Smiling, he reached up and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. “You’ll tell me if it’s too much.”
Draco froze, the corner of the blanket still bent between his fingers. That should have been a pleasant thought. But it wasn’t. Because once his Mark was gone, they would have no reason to meet. Shoving the realization away, he forced a smile onto his face. “Yeah. Shouldn’t be much longer.”
“Potter.” He sighed angrily, reaching over to tug down his sleeve. “If you’re trying to get me to admit that I wasn’t actually a Death Eater, that I was on your side, then stop it. I took the Mark.”
Draco grunted. Potter hesitated, and then finally, Draco felt him press his wand into his forearm. “Three…two…one…”
“You’re impossible, Potter,” he snarled.
As they made to leave, Draco looked over at Greg’s bed. The curtains were drawn.
He shrugged. “In a few months, my father won’t even remember he has a son.”
“She’s…” Draco sighed. “Yeah. She’s a good friend. She just…” He shrugged. “I don’t want all that rubbish in my life anymore, you know? The obsession over blood status. It’s not…I’m not…”
Draco’s reverie was broken by Pansy, who said softly, “We should get back. I’m starving.”
,” he insisted.
Draco retreated to the dormitory after dinner. He still needed to finish his chart for Arithmancy, and he had fallen behind in his Charms homework again. It was strange, sharing a room with only Blaise. They kept their space tidy: both four-poster beds were neatly made with emerald sheets, and their respective bedside tables were bare. As he sat down at his ancient writing desk, Draco pulled out his numbers chart. Vector was relentless this year; she expected them to produce complicated compositions every week. So far, Draco hadn’t been particularly successful, and he felt Vector’s patience growing thin. He needed to sort out his chart before he left to meet with Potter in the forest.
Draco meant to watch the match, but his eyes were on Harry. He would be lying if he said he didn’t look nice in his crimson Quidditch robes. It was becoming increasingly clear that Draco hadn’t been mistaken—Harry
“Tonight?” Draco snorted. “Everyone will want to celebrate your victory.”
“Good…very good.” His father cleared his throat, and then said, “Well, Draco. We have a bit of a difficult matter we need to discuss. As you know, my next hearing is October fifth. Things are…not going very well.”
“Well, Harry—” He was about to correct himself, but this was getting ridiculous. “Harry thought if he worked next to me in Potions, and said he needed my help, then Slughorn might leave me alone.”
“Er—yeah. Yes.”
“It hurts. Someone laughed, and it set me off. I don't know why.”
Before Draco could respond, Harry headed for the store cupboard. Blaise looked back at him, eyes wide. “
He nodded. Very carefully, Harry took Draco’s arm and pulled it into his lap. He rolled up his sleeve with the ease of having done it a dozen times before. “Look how light it is,” he muttered to Granger.
“It’s fine.”
She snickered. “Have not. Anyway, let’s dance. Come on.”
Potter closed his eyes and continued to suck at that one spot, moaning deep in his throat when Draco rolled his hips forward. It was incredibly frustrating, and he still needed more fiction, but Potter’s lips felt
Nott sat up in indignation. “They have an eighth year doing lines? We’re of age! Just stop going. What’s he going to do?”
“It drove Ron and Hermione mad, actually,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. His embarrassment amused Draco to no end. “That’s why Ron…that’s why he went down to the Quidditch pitch, that time he caught you in the changing room.”
“Let’s get back,” Draco said suddenly, forcing himself to stand. “It’s cold out.”
Harry chuckled weakly. “You think that’s why I’m doing this? Really?”
” Draco twisted his neck further, allowing Harry better access as he licked at the sensitive skin. “Fuck, do that again.” And so he did, sucking greedily at Draco’s neck.
He shook his head.
“I want this bloody thing gone,” he sobbed. “But I don’t want—that memory, I can’t forget it. You don’t understand.”
“Right.”
haven’t told them? God. That’s going to be an awful shock for her.”
“Stay here with me. You don’t want to go to that stupid dinner, anyway.”
“I’m fine. It’s just homework, and now Quidditch, driving me spare.”
“Yes.”
“What are you doing?” Pansy asked, watching as he crumpled the parchment in his fist and shoved it into his pocket.
“I don’t want your fucking money, Potter,” he sneered. “Just stay the hell away from me.”
“She’s mental.” Daphne looked up and, not spotting Madam Pince, she added, “Mum’s really pleased with my progress, though. When she writes me, she puts runes at the end of her letters and has me translate them when I write back. Can you imagine? I wonder what it’s like having normal parents.”
Draco thought back. His father
“Yeah.”
“I’m in the library,” he muttered to himself. “I’m in the library and I’m fine. Nothing’s happened.”
Ignoring them, Pansy said, “What happened at the Manor? With…with Potter. And his friends.”
“You had people at the Manor a lot?”
“Swap?”
. The paddle—it must have been the paddle, the burst of pain was so sudden and so sweet—landed almost directly where it had the first time, causing him to gasp in pain. “Two.”
“I’m afraid it’s not very interesting, sir.”
“I know we never talked much at school,” he said quickly. “But she’s…she’s very nice. It took her a while to recover, but now she’s on the Floo panel. We work together.”
“Not at all! You two go ahead. I need to revise this section, anyway.” She smiled encouragingly at Draco, who rolled his eyes and followed Harry. They made their way to his usual spot in the Reference Section.
Shaking his head, Draco laughed. “Right. How silly of me.” He reached out to slowly trace his finger down the bridge of Harry’s nose.
“Can’t,” he gasped. “Can’t.”
“But at least…” He shifted nervously. “At least it got you to…to tell Snape. To ask for help.”
“In case you’ve forgotten,” he said coolly, “my father’s facing the Dementor’s Kiss.”
“I just can’t make it work,” he muttered. He held out his wand again, pointing it at the quill. Nothing happened.
Harry’s words filled him with a feverish longing. “Fuck me, Harry. Please, please fuck me.”
“What does it matter?” Draco suddenly snapped. He couldn’t help himself. “As you’ve said, my circumstances have changed. I need to be
start crying again.” She gave a watery laugh. “Come on, let’s go to lunch before the others think we’re up to something.”
“Need to send a letter,” he said. Bidding her goodbye, Draco strode down the length of the Great Hall, that familiar sense of dread rising up in his throat. Students were starting to stream into the entrance hall, and he slid past them as he made his way to the double doors. Pushing through, Draco felt his head clear as the cool morning air greeted him. Over the last week, he had taken to walking the grounds almost every morning, and he often went for a stroll in the evenings, too. He told the others that he was studying in the library or implied that he was meeting up with various romantic partners. In reality, he spent hours walking aimlessly along the lake, around the greenhouses, and by Hagrid’s hut. Although it was still only September, the weather had turned quite chilly, and he found that the cold air calmed his nerves and cut through his panic. Increasingly, a low level of unease seemed to perpetually constrict his chest. He couldn’t pinpoint what exactly he was afraid of. He was simultaneously worried about everything—his parents, their finances, his grades, his future plans—and nothing at all; sometimes he had the peculiar sensation of being almost numb. Wandering through the grounds brought him some much-needed perspective and seemed to keep his fears at bay. Occasionally, he wished he had someone to talk to, someone to guide him, like Severus once had—but no, those thoughts were too painful; best to bury them.
Harry ducked his head; Draco would have sworn he was laughing.
Draco let out another sob and gripped Harry’s jumper.
Potter gave him a funny look as he rolled his sleeve up higher, fulling exposing the Mark. “I wonder what that mouse got up to.”
“Nothing’s wrong.” He flattened his fringe nervously. “Everything’s fine, I think. You’ll see.”
, it hurt worse than he could have ever imagined, why had his father not warned him how badly it would
“I’m fine, I’m fine!” she cried. Her face was red; several tendrils of hair were plastered to her forehead.
firewhisky,” Pansy said. Her voice was loud, far too loud. It rang in his ears as he tried to sit up.
“Let me see.” Harry’s expression hadn’t changed, but his voice was lower, huskier.
“Right.”
Draco’s hands roamed along the counter, grappling for purchase—blindly, he reached up for a cupboard door. When Potter suddenly dragged his thumb over the tip of Draco’s cock, swiping through the pre-cum that had accumulated there, he gasped and gave a start. There was a crackling sound as he nearly pulled the cupboard door off its hinges. Potter laughed.
“Look,” Harry was saying, elbowing him gently. “Look what Hermione said about your wand.”
Draco allowed himself to be distracted: he couldn’t believe the sense of relief he felt at the sight of his wand. Without it, he had felt exposed, vulnerable, defenceless. Some of his strength seemed to come back as he pocketed it.
“Fine, thanks,” he said stiffly, pulling back his arm.
“Pansy!” Daphne squeaked. “Don’t say that!” Predictably, they heard Madam Pince shush them.
Draco held out his sketchbook, eyeing his drawing critically. His leaves were a bit wonky, he thought. Looking over at Blaise’s work, though, he decided he was happy enough. He set down his sketchbook and allowed himself to stare out at the lake, waiting for the others to finish. Off in the distance, he could see the memorial that had been erected in honour of those who had fallen during the last Battle. Engraved into the snowy white obelisk were over fifty names—names that had belonged to his classmates, his professors, his friends. And here he was, sitting outside on a nice autumn day, sketching plants. He felt sick at the thought.
“Oh?”
“Tea, Lupin?” Potter asked, already fiddling with the stove. Draco pulled out a chair and threw himself into it, refusing to meet Lupin’s eyes.
, Pansy.”
“Yeah, he does. They tried twice, and then they stopped. I don’t really know why.”
When Draco nodded, he reached over for his wand. Once Harry had sorted them out, Draco crawled beneath the sheets, reveling in the feel of silk against his limbs. Harry climbed in after him, pulling Draco against his chest in what was soon becoming their usual position. It was very warm under the blankets, and very cozy, and soon Draco felt himself falling asleep.
“Relax…relax, there you go…” Potter already knew, of course, but he repeated the platitudes anyway as he slowly eased two fingers in. He had learned early on
. And he couldn’t help it if there weren’t exactly that many good-looking blokes in their year, and if Harry just so happened to have the brightest green eyes he had ever seen. And he couldn’t help it, either, if Harry looked fantastic on his broomstick, all wiry strength and tanned skin and arrogant smile that Draco both did and did not loathe. And what was he supposed to do when Harry was so innately tactile, so physical, when he laughed so easily with his friends and wore his stupid navy jumper that looked so soft and so cozy? Even Blaise had admitted once, after several firewhiskies, that Harry wasn’t bad-looking. And for Blaise, that was very high praise indeed.
Suddenly gripped with an irrational anger, Draco sat up. He wiped away at the tears he hadn’t realized were gathering in his eyes. “Forget it, I said. I didn’t care at that point.”
