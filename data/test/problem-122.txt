It was nice to see Pansy chatting so avidly with another girl. She was constantly complaining that she was surrounded by too many boys all the time hanging out with him. Pansy and everyone else had taken some getting used to when it came to Millicent. She was one of the rare Slytherin half-bloods, one with a muggle parent no less. She was quick to assure that said muggle parent was out of the picture, and that she disliked muggles as much as the next pureblood, but she still hadn’t grown up in the same pureblood circles.
My secret alternate title for this chapter is Molly Does Too Much Research About Cyphers. I'm sorry in advance but please put up with it, I wanted to use my new info lol.
Luna hummed a bit. “Well… my mother’s maiden name was Malfoy you know. Mother didn’t talk about her family much, but I gathered that she was disowned. We’re probably cousins.” Luna looked back up at Draco in excitement. “I didn’t know I had any cousins.”
He met Draco stare head on with an eyebrow raised. “If you want to have private conversations you should at least check that you’re alone first. I’ve been right here this whole time.”
With that Draco slid his wand away and stood in one smooth gesture. He took a glance around the table at the gawking faces. Blaise and Pansy both looked as if they’d just watched him being murdered. Draco did his best to avoid their eyes, worried he wouldn’t have the courage to go through with his plan if he let his friends comfort him.
Between all these things going on though -- classes, homework, patrol, thestral study, writing Luna, quidditch practise, general keeping track of things -- Draco was hardly sleeping. He had taken to casting a mild glamour over his dark circles since Saturday morning, coming back from quidditch, when he had forgotten the glamour and Pansy had been appalled by them.
Blaise gave him a Look. Draco tipped his face up haughtily. “And I may have glamoured it last night so Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t see it. It’s just the one bruise.”
Blaise gave him a hard look. Draco looked at where he was rubbing his sore arm so he would have an excuse to look away.
Potter’s voice cut through the silence of the corridor like a knife. “What happened? I saw you leave the Great Hall at breakfast.”
Zabini was sitting on his bed when she left and raised an eyebrow at him. Draco only huffed and looked away.
They must have been walking for at least ten minutes in silence before Luna cut through it abruptly. “You know, I don’t think it was your fault in the first place.”
Draco saw the shock at the words coming out of Draco’s mouth slowly come over Potter’s face the longer he went on. Maybe he could hear the edge of desperation creeping up Draco’s throat. But he also saw when he went too far, Potter’s anger replaced his shock. Draco was far too late to stop himself now though and the next thing he knew was darkness.
Draco was ashamed to admit that he may have avoided coming into direct contact with him more than usual this summer. While he did seem happier than he had of late, he was also much more critical of Draco than usual.
Pansy giggled in a cutesy manner that disgusted Draco. He’d never heard Pansy do that before. It was revolting. She leaned even closer to his ear and held her hand up in front of her mouth as he had, whispering back. “First of all it's for
But everytime Draco tried to tap into those thoughts, to make himself feel happy about anything, he just saw Potter’s screaming face. It made bile rise up the back of his throat. What horrible things had the Dark Lord done to Potter? He couldn’t even think about his father being there without wanting to puke.
Draco lived in a state of increasing stress as the days passed before Potter’s trial. He found himself losing all focus on his studies, reading and reading yet not taking anything in. He took to flying over the countryside more and more often in a way he hadn’t previously dared.
Greg kicked his foot against the flagstones. “Besides, we told each other we were going to do our best without your help this year. What with… stuff going on, we knew you’d be busy. And it’s O.W.L. year besides.”
Draco swallowed heavily, then read, in a dead voice. “By order of Hogwarts High Inquisitor Dolores Jane Umbridge: no student organisations, societies, teams, groups and clubs may exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor.”
Edgecombe shot a sideways look at her friends. “Why don’t you head up to Divination without me? This could take a minute and Divination is pretty far away. I wouldn’t want us all to be late.”
Now it was Blaise’s turn to roll his eyes. “I have been hanging out with you and Pansy for almost two weeks now, not to mention I
Again the girl did the opposite of what Draco was expecting. He’d spoken his thoughts without thinking about it, lured out by this girl’s impertinent nature, but she didn’t freeze up or freak out at the mention of Diggory, but was instead excited by the idea he’d posed.
Potter grimaced. “Why are you telling me this? I don’t understand why you care about this. You wouldn’t even admit last year that your father was a Death Eater and now you’re telling me his plans?”
Pansy scowled harder. She really did look like a crup when she scrunched her nose up like that, Draco found himself thinking wildly in an effort to keep his composure.
Draco was finally able to get some sleep that night, his efforts towards taking down three of the Weasleys calming his anger enough that he could forget it for just a moment.
He positioned himself carefully, casually leaning up against the wall of a side hallway as she passed with three of her friends, one of them the infamous Cho Chang. He appeared alone and relaxed, the perfect bait. He yelled out to her. “Edgecombe!”
Luna shook her head again, her long hair waving about. “Everyone was there. Hermione examined everyone individually before we left too. Zacharias Smith didn’t like that too much.”
When he was younger he’d excuse himself and hide in his room in the dark until the suffocating feelings had passed. As he got older, he improved at separating his feelings into boxes, waiting until he was alone to observe them. It was a good exercise for when he started Occlumency.
“SO OF COURSE I THINK ABOUT GRYFFINDOR FRIENDSHIPS! Friendships where I don’t have to bother with politics and reasoning and swaying allies or tormenting someone I love. Where I can be with Potter and it doesn’t matter because what could other things matter really? Greg and Vince only follow me because I tutor them and our fathers told them too as repayment. I barely know the others. We band together for self preservation. For our parents. Our blood. Until last year I was sure even Pansy was only friends with me because of Slytherin politics and the want of a good marriage match.”
Draco sat up and rubbed his eyes. His voice was still scratchy when he said, “I’m up Pansy. What is it? Whatever it is better actually be important.”
A vivid image passed behind his eyes of Luna, bent over a parchment stained in blood, tears rushing from her eyes.
The sheer scope of trying to keep that many people quiet and careful gave Draco a headache just thinking about it. He couldn’t help but groan as he laid his head in his arms on the desk.
Warrington looked considering. “Might be a couple I could look at for a spot of spying. You really think the Weasleys will let a Slytherin test their products?”
Draco scowled at Potter. “Watch your back Potter.” For some reason that made Potter’s mouth quirk up in a half smile. Draco wanted to smile back. Instead he said, “I think my father had something to do with the bitch’s appointment.”
On the other hand, he seemed to have given Theo- Nott, that one last shove he’d needed to move completely out of Draco’s orbit. Nott had also been around since Draco was small, and even though they’d never been real friends, Draco wasn’t sure he liked how things had unraveled. He’d already fielded two nasty letters about ostracizing Nott from his father, who was worried about Nott’s father, but Draco wasn’t too worried, having used the excuse of building different political allies. Other than upsetting his father, Nott hadn’t made any attacks on Draco or Blaise’s person, which was probably all the better for Nott, considering Draco’s renewed efforts to retain his popularity.
our O.W.L year. If she ruins all our other classes I’m bound to fail. I’m not as much of a swot as you are after all.”
Draco was momentarily distracted by Luna’s ludicrous headdress roaring from the stands when he saw Potter shooting into one of his signature dives near where the Slytherins sat. Draco was quick to follow, a competitive fire burning in his stomach.
“Why do you hate Umbridge, Draco? She’s never done anything to you or your friends.” Luna was looking as far away from Draco as she could be, as if she knew how hard Draco would find the question.
Finnigan scoffed. “Everyone knows who your no-good father is, Malfoy. He’s nothing but a corrupt Death Eater!”
Blaise leaned in further in interest at Draco’s offer. Pansy, however, only glared at him. “Let’s hear this new favor first. If it’s another late night tonight, no glamour in the world could hide the sight of me passed out on the floor.”
All through the evening he was plagued with anxiety. By the time he’d finished helping Greg, the library was closing and it was far too late to go see Umbridge. He’d sent a message to Luna asking about Edgecombe as soon as he’d made it to his dorm. She’d assured Draco that she hadn’t so much as left the tower since dinner.
His father cleared his throat and straightened in his chair as he addressed his family. Draco was already on edge. It was already the night of August 30th and he still hadn’t gotten his Hogwarts list or news of who the new prefects would be. He was already using Occlumency just to stop himself from hyperventilating. Whatever this was was not going to be good for his stress levels.
Draco was a bit embarrassed by his worry. After all, he hadn’t even talked to Luna in person since the carriage at the end of last year. He didn’t know what he’d do if she got caught though. Luna was quick to respond.
Vincent sat next to him at dinner, with Pansy on Draco’s other side, keeping a tight grip on his robes. Draco only noted this when Vincent slapped him on the back and laughed in his ear, far closer than Draco liked, but it had the effect of bringing him back in the conversation just in time for his world to turn on its head.
He finally pushed his letter and the spare parchment away with a groan, startling Pansy and Blaise who were playing wizard’s hangman on the other side of Uncle Severus’s desk.
All three sat on Draco’s bed. It was a few minutes before Pansy whispered,  “What’s going on Draco?”
Zabini’s eyebrows lowered. When he spoke his voice was measured. “So I see. Why don’t you like her?”
Draco managed to keep a good track of Potter and pals as they all got off the train. He even managed to get those green eyes turned his way. The first look after the holidays was always the sweetest.
Draco turned and offered Luna his right arm. She was quick to bounce forward and slide her hand around Draco’s elbow. “How exciting! I’ve never been properly escorted before.”
Draco set the parchment back on the table and closed his eyes. He was careful to breathe and shore up his Occlumency shields against the onslaught of panic he could already feel building as he read. He couldn’t afford another public attack like before.
If Draco could have spoken to Mrs. Parkinson he would have told her not to worry, that worrying would only make things worse. Pansy was no fool. And also a bit of a coward. She knew what she would need to do and was fully prepared for it. She just liked taking all the advantage she could get away with before settling. She was the last type who would run off with a muggle or what-have-you. She’d told Draco she just wanted a good fortune with an absolutely ridiculous manor so she would only have to tolerate her husband so much.
Draco kept his head down when Blaise spoke. “If she’s watching the Floo as well as owl mail we’re all going to have some problems in an emergency. No Floo-calling our parents, or fast escapes, when the Ministry is watching. They’ll have Aurors at our doors as fast as they can Apparate. It’s even worse for Potter’s gang. If anyone found out the sorts of places Potter went when he’s not at school he could have some real problems.”
There was a large back table in the Three Broomsticks that student organizations frequently reserved on Hogsmeade weekends that would be the best place if it wasn’t already reserved. No one would look twice at a large group of students getting together there. It was important to use their numbers to hide Potter in plain sight. No matter how innocuous, Umbridge would pay attention to anything Potter was involved with, due to the huge target he’d painted on himself.
Thinking of the empty green eyes that were usually filled with an angry fire sent a shiver down Draco’s spine, and even starred in at least one nightmare.
Luna hummed thoughtfully, looking out of the corner of her eye at him. “It’s not the same. I don’t think you’re affected.”
Pansy rolled her eyes, but her face softened in return and she stepped closer to flick a bit of hair from his face.
That particular tower was especially dangerous for Slytherins, even if it was a prime spot for catching a misbehaving Gryffindor. Gryffindors tended to run in packs and a lone Slytherin Prefect was always a good target.
Draco thought for a second and suddenly came to a realization. “Isn’t Smith related to the Smiths who claim to be descendants of Hufflepuff? Salazar help us, his family must be affected by
The sound of her putting down her silverware rang loudly in the big empty room. “Draco dear, your father told me some interesting news before he left again this evening.”
Pansy and Milli found them when they were getting off and managed to fix the three of them up. When Draco came to, Pansy was white-faced and tight lipped. She kept apologizing for not looking for him sooner the whole way off the train. Apparently Greengrass and Davies had come looking for her, bored of sitting with just Zabini, and it had distracted Pansy from how long he’d been gone.
Draco supposed that Pansy and Blaise must have been getting close while he had been fuming. He felt bad for Blaise though, really. Wizarding society in general didn’t mind too much about homosexuality and its spectrum, but purebloods were expected to marry another pureblood of a different sex and produce at least one heir. Blaise was already on the outskirts of pureblood society with how his mother carried on her relationships, this wasn’t going to be easy for him.
Draco suppressed the grin, and frowned at the two of them. “I’m afraid it is important.” Draco glared at Chang in a not-at-all-feigned way. “And private. I doubt you want your friends to hear it.”
Draco’s voice croaked out, “It’s not a habit. I won’t let it become one. I’m working hard, I promise.”
Draco practically hissed the word care and Potter recoiled. He felt Pansy and Blaise both fidget, but couldn’t see their faces.
But Luna came all the way in the door with no hesitation and stopped about half a meter away. They both looked at each other for a few seconds, before Luna cut the tension in a cheery voice. “Hi, Draco! I’m quite pleased to see you in person. Is it alright to hug you?”
Pansy snorted. “Oh, it’s going to. But we’ll have each other anyway. That’s the best we can hope for.”
Draco rolled his eyes and went back to his own breakfast, more able to eat now than he had been last night.
Milli looked highly affronted, but everyone else only smiled and said their goodnights. Greg made a comment about him and Vincent staying down in the common room for a while. Draco didn’t blame them.
Pansy backed up a step-and-a-half and glared at him. “Of course I care! I care about you, and you care about him!” Draco actually physically recoiled. Pansy seeing his look lifted her head enough to look down at him in an insulted manner. “Besides which, she is a horrible teacher. I haven’t learned a thing in her class about defense and it
Draco straightened as much as he could in his chair and accidently cut Milli off mid-sentence when he announced, “Well, We’re going to bed then. Goodnight.”
It would probably help, he thought, practically stabbing the air with his wand as he practiced some spell or other he could barely remember, if he could decide just who exactly he was mad at and concoct some way to fix it. He kept cycling through a range of targets. Harry bloody Potter featuring quite a bit.
Even though Luna talked like it didn’t hurt, Draco sensed an underlying pain, still, after all these years. Draco wondered if Luna acted like it didn’t hurt because she thought it shouldn’t. Draco kept his voice low as if trying not to be overheard. “I’m sorry she died. I’ve never lost anyone before, so I can’t say I know how it feels, but I am sorry you lost her. She sounds exceptional, I would have loved to meet her. My estranged cousin.”
In order to implement his plan to undermine Weasley, he’d taught Pansy the song he’d made and had her teach the other Slytherins. He’d sent Blaise off with Vince and Greg to distract the Gryffindors. Blaise had learned a spell from Montague that grew someone’s hair uncontrollably.
Draco glared at the door knocker. “You have to answer a question to get in? That doesn’t seem very secure.”
The girl-Lovegood, kept talking through the handshake, ignoring Draco’s hesitation. “I know you, Draco Malfoy. You can call me Luna. Even if you don’t want to talk to me next year you can always send an owl now you know my name. Not many people want to talk to me.”
Umbridge had paused her writing as he’d spoken and now looked up slowly to meet his eyes once more. “What is it, exactly, that you are implying, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco let out a snort against his will. “No, I wasn’t talking to a thestral. Professor Snape wanted a word, not that it’s any of your business. Where did you even run into a thestral in the first place?”
When a green badge fell out of the envelope with a clatter he practically threw his list of supplies across the table. It captured all of his attention where it glittered on his parchment. Draco felt like looking at it let him breathe for the first time all summer.
Despite the stricken looks of the other Slytherins, Crabbe was still smiling when he turned to address Draco’s question. “Oh yeah, meant to tell you yesterday, but with you in the hospital wing and all.” Crabbe shrugged his wide shoulders, carelessly, like he hadn’t stabbed Draco in the back. “We -- Greg and me -- heard what you said to Edgecombe, you know? Figured you just hadn’t told Umbridge ‘cause it was unconfirmed rumours. You wouldn’t want to be wrong if you’re telling the Ministry, yeah? So I told Umbridge while you were tutoring Greg. Then we’d be blamed if it was wrong, but we’d give all the Slytherins credit if it was right. And it was! Least enough for Umbridge. We thought we’d wait till after our game in case we lost. Cheer you up. You’re always cranky when you lose to Potter.”
Draco had managed to pull himself together in time to head to History of Magic after breakfast, Pansy catching him before they left and casting the glamour he’d taught her on his puffy red eyes.
Communications with you have been sparse this year I know. Vexing though it is to have so little contact, I trust you have been making wise choices at school. I know your father and I are very proud of what we’ve been hearing. Given how proud we are of you, we have a surprise for you come Christmas holidays. I can’t wait for you to find out what it is! Loath as I am to lecture you, you do need to keep practicing your DADA skills. Outstandings are the only grade we expect to see from you in your O.W.Ls.
As it was he was quite happy that he had Pansy as his prefect partner. He supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised, no one had the Slytherin house by the balls quite as well as Pansy. Davies had relatives in Ravenclaw house and was seen as having split loyalties. Greengrass was a nice enough pureblood girl, but a little too quiet. Milli stood no chance, unfortunately for her. No matter how her reputation had grown since second year, Slytherin couldn’t be seen to have a half-blood prefect: even if they could intimidate the younger years, they would never get the respect of the older students.
sent him a message saying that things seemed to be wrapping up, he wandered back over to the other side of the floor.
His voice was sharp and loud. Everyone around them suddenly stopped talking when they registered his tone. Pansy tightened her grip on his forearm.
Draco and his friends chatted more normally amongst themselves as the meeting went on. They couldn’t do anything else unless there was an emergency. But through the whole meeting they never saw a single teacher. A few of the bar patrons had looked curious at how many students were gathering at the one table, but no one seemed to think it was too strange. He heard Rosmerta telling someone she thought it was a gobstones club meeting.
Draco tried to block off the worry with his Occlumency walls, but he couldn’t focus hard enough; he wondered if it was because of the concussion.
They started the act by going to the Yule Ball together. Draco figured it had been successful. She didn’t whinge about him paying attention to Potter and she didn’t step on his feet when they danced. She’d only rolled her eyes and complied when Draco asked her to move her head slightly so he could get a better view of where Potter was sitting with the Weasel. In thanks, after Potter had left, Draco had let her off to dance with a couple boys from different schools.
Blaise buried his face in his hands as if not seeing them would make them forget what they’d just heard.
He liked to pretend that the three of them were operating on Slytherin’s mutual destruction code, but the truth was that he
It took all period, but Draco was sure he’d cracked the letter. His mother wasn’t one for overly complicated codes, preferring to simply talk around subjects instead, and using simple codes when it couldn’t be avoided. He found that if he put together the first letter of each sentence it read: C Vigilio. Vigilio meant to watch in Latin, so Draco assumed that since the C made no sense otherwise, mother meant that he should watch communications, or that communications were being watched.
noticed Draco ignoring him right after the Black Quill Incident (as Draco had started calling it in his head) because he was now staring at Draco any chance he could get and Draco had even caught him
He made sure to make eye contact with his mother when he brought up his next question. “Are we sure it wasn’t one of father’s… other, associates?”
Draco shook his head. “Whatever you say Luna.” Draco suddenly remembered something. “Oh! Before you go, was Edgecombe any better after this meeting?”
Draco nudged his arm. “Fine, I’ll help you. Let’s go to the Library. I’m assuming you don’t want Vincent to know you’ve asked?”
Potter’s glare faded, slowly. Draco wasn’t sure he liked that any better. The whole thing felt like defeat. Like a resignation Draco had been fighting for years. All he’d ever fought for was to have Potter’s eyes on him, in whatever way he could get. Telling him not to bother with Draco was Draco finally admitting weakness, failure. It tasted bitter.
Draco cleared his throat before Pansy could respond. “No, you won’t need to keep following her. Her own paranoia will be enough to undo her. If we all just keep a casual eye on her we should spot anything.”
Draco looked down his nose at them and put on his most haughty tone of voice. “Well. Thank you for checking on me, but you’d be more useful gathering some actually
Blaise grimaced, but met Draco’s eyes head-on. “No, I didn’t tell anyone about Potter’s group. I hate Umbridge, and you two are the only people I really talk to.” Blaise clenched his jaw as if to stop there, but as the words kept spilling out a look of utter embarrassment came over him. “I’m so grateful to have found people like you two that feel like real friends, in a house of snakes, I never could betray you of my own free will. I might actually die before I gave you a reason to hate me. And does this stuff ever let you stop!? Salazar!”
Potter was surprised for a second before he realized what was happening and glared. “What the fuck Malfoy!?”
Now Davies was smiling too. “It won’t be a problem. I expect you want me to pretend to be a Ravenclaw and go scout around the Gryffindor’s practices?”
She already sounded indignant. Draco allowed his mouth an extra twitch upwards. “I’ve come to thank you, Professor.”
Madam Pomfrey smiled. Actually smiled. Draco wasn’t sure he’d ever seen her smile. “Thank you Mr. Malfoy, but think nothing of it. You aren’t the first student to fake an injury and you won’t be the last.” She tried to hide her smile behind a fake stern facade. “If you could send me fewer students to treat that would be enough of an apology.”
Draco looked back at Luna’s smiling face. He didn’t feel like arguing. He ran a shaky hand through his hair with a sigh, then jerkily held his arm out for her like he had last time. She took it without saying anything and they started heading toward Ravenclaw tower.
Several people around them gasped and started whispering to each other. Draco did his best to not react, making the most of his Occlumency skills. He had definitely not known this. He could just see Pansy shooting him a concerned look from over Nott’s shoulder.
Blaise heaved a heavy sigh. “My father was a disgrace of a pureblood. He defied tradition and instead of going into politics he joined the Italian Aurors. Mother and he had been childhood sweethearts. Mother was more of a traditionalist, but she loved him and thought him brave to follow his heart. So they got married. Mother was disowned. It broke her heart, but she thought it was worth it. They had me and were happy until I was about five. He died during a raid.”
He didn’t know what to feel, what to think. Already it was hard to reconcile the horror he felt with the excited murmurs from certain other Slytherins. His fist tightened around his wand, a couple of green sparks shooting out the end. Everything had only just happened. He still had a little over a week before he went home for the summer. He’d observe for now. He’d decide at the closing feast what role he had to play this time.
It seemed more like his father was connected to this ‘Christmas surprise’ that Draco could make no headway on figuring out. The enthusiasm his mother showed for it in such a serious letter was not promising. He hoped desperately it had nothing to do with the Dark Lord.
Draco glared back at him. His voice even sounded irate. “Because if this gets to light then she can be fired -- by Dumbledore, or the school governors, or hell, maybe the Ministry! I thought by telling you how much of a good thing that would be for the big picture you’d listen!”
Draco sniffed and turned his head away from Finnigan. “It was you who wasn’t paying attention. And you're out of bed after curfew.”
Crabbe swallowed heavily, pushing Draco’s wand harder into his throat. He started to nod, but upon being unable to move his head, he stuttered out. “Y-yes?”
Draco pushed himself back and away from Potter as hard as he could, ending up almost at the wall. Draco couldn’t tear his eyes from Potter to run or even get up, he could only stare in horror.
Draco’s sneer dropped, his exhaustion becoming clear on his face in a way he’d never let happen in front of Potter before. “If you don’t care, leave me alone, Potter. Stop following me around, stop asking questions you don’t want to know the answers to, focus on your own damn problems. I’m sure you’ve got enough of them.”
Draco hesitantly reached out to shake the offered hand. He hadn’t heard of a Lovegood, but Ravenclaws were all right. About the only other house Slytherins talked to. Her hand was cold in his.
Draco opened his mouth and closed it again. He knew he hated Umbridge because she was torturing Potter and working with Draco’s father. His own father who was also set on hurting Harry. Potter. But he couldn’t say any of that.
Blaise laughed from across the table. Draco glared at him, which Blaise ignored. He kept his voice low, though. “Less competition for you with Potter if the girl-weasel is out of the way, huh Draco?”
She shot him a sideways look. Draco abruptly recalled that the last time he’d been in the hospital wing was when that hippogriff attacked him. It must have said something bad about her healing technique that he’d claimed she couldn’t heal him. A wave of shame came over him and he merely nodded his agreement.
Blaise ordered them a round of butterbeers and they sat back to watch the show. Draco took out Luna’s diary, a couple rolls of parchment, and his quill and ink. His friends were slow to follow his lead. Draco knew they thought it was mostly pointless, but Draco needed the cover so he could read any message Luna sent him. Pansy and Blaise thought they were just pretending to study as an excuse to linger.
The two thoughts drifted and collided in his mind in a kind of numb horror. Both thoughts wanted to spiral out into the worst possible outcomes, Draco only just able to block the incoming panic.
Draco grabbed Blaise’s elbow and turned to that they were facing the same way and started walking down the hall again. “Talk. What’s the news?”
Draco was oddly touched. He knew if he were a better person he would pay more attention to his two lackeys, but besides being good listeners when he wanted to rant at someone, they didn’t have many useful or interesting qualities. It was hard to have a conversation with someone so far behind him. Still he softened his accusing tone. “You know you’re not great at studies. Without any help you might not pass.”
! She cares more about money than me! She just wants to sell me off to the highest bidder without caring how horrible they are because she got saddled with someone awful! I hate having him in my house, knowing what he did! His body is wasting away, he’s only alive because he’s hooked up to magical machines. When I first heard what he’d done I wanted to rip them out. I saw the crime pictures… The woman and her kid didn’t make it.”
Blaise leaned around Draco to leer at Nott. “Unless you wanted a go, Nott? I’ve never kissed anyone as ugly as you, but I’ll try anything once.”
Draco shivered at the seriousness in Potter’s voice. Was he afraid? Or aroused? Potter’s green eyes burned. Draco’s smile fell.
Blaise smirked, but his eyes looked guilty. “Well… I wasn’t going to become friends with a future Death Eater on the eve of a war just for protection from pureblood homophobia, no, I didn’t decide to become friends with you until I overheard you and Pansy.”
Draco lifted one of his hands, and waved it around vaguely. “I don’t care. That excuse is as good as any other.”
He made himself sick sometimes. Draco couldn’t help it when it came to flying though. Potter was a natural on a broom, an amazing sight to watch. He didn’t think he’d ever been so scared and horny in his life watching Potter fly against a fucking
He was determined to make his father proud. With war imminent he might not have many more chances to do it. He could barely remember the last time he’d made his father proud, it was so long ago. He thought it must have been when he’d gotten his Hogwarts letter, five years ago now. Sometimes his father’s kind smile felt like a children’s story he told himself for motivation.
If one of them wrote the other a letter without a valediction, the body of the letter contained a secret message. Seeing such a letter from his mother, though, felt like a bayonet to the gut. He hadn’t noticed his breaths quickening, nor how the sounds of the other students around him had faded to a dull buzzing. He only saw the parchment in front of him; that one word: mother.
Pansy glared him into cutting himself off. She leaned forward and kissed his cheek. “Sorry darling.”
The feeling of flying neck and neck was one of the best memories Draco had of Hogwarts. He would be loath to lose it if Harry- if Potter got expelled.
Only when he was up in the air, though, could he leave his slowly growing fears behind. He’d always loved flying, and being able to fly against Potter only made him more determined to be good at it. Fear and masks were for the ground; up in the sky it was only speed and wind and glorious freedom.
Draco sat up straighter. “I heard that you had Potter and the Weasley twins banned from Quidditch. This gives Slytherin much better odds for the Quidditch Cup.” Draco paused to shoot Umbridge a delicately disgusted look. “Not to mention the way they attacked me. How dare they touch me with their inferior hands! Dueling like muggles.”
Draco could well remember the night they had made their own arrangement. It still filled him with a bit of panicky fear to contemplate.
Draco’s smirk dropped along with the amusement he felt at his friend’s antics. “I don’t know. She doesn’t believe the Dark Lord is back, but I thought she favored Death Eater’s children anyway, from her behavior and my father’s talk. Maybe it doesn’t extend as far as I thought it did.”
Draco slid into his most menacing glare. “You can believe this Finnigan. You better start respecting me now before it’s
The teachers were also watching. They seemed to have doubled in number since the end of the tournament, the teachers who never left their rooms being dragged out by Dumbledore to help keep an eye on the students.
His distress only seemed to make her more pleased and sure in her decision. “Be a good boy then and don’t give me a reason to. That’s easy enough, yes? If you can behave yourself, I needn’t even tell anyone you are to do these detentions. It would be quite the embarrassment to the Malfoy name if your little friends were to know you’d misbehaved.”
Luna seemed content, but the silence was unsettling for Draco. The only thing he could think to say was the one thing that had been on his mind all night. “Potter found me before your meeting. I’m not sure how, I was hiding in an alcove behind a tapestry. I think maybe he was stalking me again somehow. Did he say anything?”
“I have some good news to impart. The Ministry has just passed educational decree number 22. This means that in the event the headmaster is unable to find a teacher, the Ministry will choose one for them.” Lucius smirked. “Since Dumbledore is a bumbling fool, he’s been unable to find a new defense teacher.”
Draco smirked. “I thought we just established who my father was, you really think he hasn’t taught me anything?”
Draco wanted to grin as he watched Chang turn toward Edgecombe in shock. She clearly hadn’t known that. Potter had been loud enough last year telling everyone he knew that Draco’s father had been in that graveyard. This should put a dent in their friendship. If Potter was intent on having Chang around him, this might help make her less dangerous. The other two girls with them were even tittering over it together behind Chang and Edgecombe.
Pansy rolled her eyes at the situation and hooked her hand through Draco’s elbow. “Come on then, we’re never going to get a compartment to ourselves at this rate.”
Milli was pleasant enough company in any case. Once she’d seen Draco’s template, she was a crack hand, making the work go fast and not needing any real help from Draco. She didn’t talk much. Draco thought she might be nervous to be working with just him, so he persuaded her to tell him some anecdotes about Pansy and some of the other Slytherin girls.
But that sounded crazy. An obedient heir would do what his father told him. He’d want his father to kill Potter to gain status, he’d want Umbridge to make a fool of Potter to further the Dark Lord’s plans. Umbridge was doing what no other teacher but Snape did, treating the Slytherins with a certain degree of respect, when the rest of the school looked down their noses at them. This should be Draco’s
It seemed he’d also gained a fast friend in Blaise, who now accompanied he and Pansy almost everywhere, with Greg and Vincent sometimes trailing behind. It made something in Draco light up at the thought, he’d never really made a friend of his own volition before, and his last attempt, Potter, had gone miserably. All his other friends, Pansy, Greg, Vincent, he’d known since before Hogwarts and often shared tutors with while he was growing up. Blaise was a new element.
Looking from the door, Draco glimpsed Luna and Granger already at the big table in the back. He was glad not to see Potter yet. In front of the partial wall that hid the big table Luna and Granger were setting up, Draco spotted an empty table. Draco sat with his back to the partition so he could see the door and would hear them if the spell went wrong. Pansy sat next to him, also adjacent to the window; she’d honed a special skill of covert observation, mostly using pocket mirrors. Blaise sat across from Draco and lounged back in his seat, able to look over Draco’s head at the visible corner of the long table. Draco picked him for the position, knowing that if something did go wrong he’d be the least likely to lose his cool.
He thought he caught a hint of worry in his mother’s eyes across the table, before she turned a congratulatory smile onto her husband.
Potter shot him a look of sheer disbelief. “What is going on with you Malfoy? Did you get possessed?”
They both listened as Pansy cried for a bit, unable to do anything to help. Draco’s heart clenched with every sob.
Pansy let out an audible gasp, her mouth open in shock, one of her hands raising to cover it. Blaise’s butter knife hit the table with a clatter. Draco dragged his hands down his face as hard as he could, not wanting to see Blaise’s face. He shouldn’t have said that. He shouldn’t have said that. There was no way they wouldn’t ask questions.
He paused outside the office door. He took several, long, slow breaths. Then he locked it everything away. Every feeling, every vulnerable thought. The perfect Occlumency wall.
Draco clenched his jaw and barely kept from flinching when it aggravated the bruise on his jaw. The last thing he wanted to do was rehash his recent mistakes. “It doesn’t matter. I merely told them some hard truths and they attacked me. What happened after I passed out?”
He took his chance to renew his tormenting. Staring at him was apparently such an effective distraction for Potter that Draco couldn’t resist mucking up whatever Potter happened to be working on. Once when Draco spotted Potter following him by the Quidditch field, he’d put him in a body-bind and locked him in the broomshed.
The Weasley twins traipsed in like they owned the place with Jordan, their friend the Quidditch commentator. Draco hadn’t expected anybody from the upper years. He narrowed his eyes on the shopping bags they carried. He hoped they were here for support and not to make trouble. He couldn’t imagine they could learn anything from someone two years younger.
He’d yet to catch Potter after one of his detentions no matter where he took his patrol. It made panic climb the back of his throat to think about, so he tried to focus on other things. It’s not like Umbridge could get away with
Potter practically snarled at him. “I’m not going to tell anyone, Malfoy, and if you do I’ll hex you into next week! Or better, I’ll tell everyone you
Luna pulled back after a few seconds and smiled at him again. Draco attempted a smile back. “Shall we go then?”
Draco hoped they didn’t. It might have been the smarter thing to do, but the idea of playing around with other people’s memories like that felt manipulative and invasive on a level Draco was uncomfortable with. It was one thing to Obliviate muggles for their own good, it was another thing entirely to modify a fellow witch’s memory. If they could do that to Edgecombe, who just wanted to leave the group, what would they be willing to do to Draco if they found out he knew? Nothing pleasant.
He almost wished he could tell them about his correspondence with Luna. But every time he thought of it he remembered Pansy’s face, last year, when he’d gotten out of the carriage with Luna.
Actually doing that though would be tantamount to suicide at this point. Everyone not in Potter’s immediate entourage was giving Potter a wide berth. Mostly out of respect, for both Potter and Dumbledore, who had asked the school to do so before Potter got out of the hospital wing, but also because anyone who didn’t found themselves on the wrong side of far too many Weasleys. A seventh year Slytherin had ended up in a bad spot courtesy of the twins that was so bad it scared off most of his house, and a misguided Hufflepuff had gotten a bad bat-bogey hex from the Weaslette.
Pansy reached over the table to Draco’s hand holding his fork. “All it’s going to do is make you see something you wish you hadn’t. Or, Merlin forbid, something that finally tips you into doing something really stupid and dragging me with you.”
He snapped his head in the direction the Bludger had come from, and saw a smug looking Vince waving his Beater’s club around.
Draco grimaced. “I don’t know why I didn't really. He said he’d tell people I helped him if he found out I told someone about his detentions, but I doubt he’d find out I told you two.” Draco squeezed his eyes shut, pushing back the images that tried to break through his mental shields, and spoke in a barely discernible whisper. “He was bleeding. I’ve never seen him so ....”
It felt nice. This was them without masks or dignity or pureblood pride. This was getting to be close to his friends without worry or trickery or disguises. It made Draco wonder… “I wonder if this is what it’s like all the time for the other houses. If all Gryffindor friendships are like this.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at that. He wondered if Luna was serious and Potter was actually invisible or if she meant something else. He supposed it didn’t matter.
Potter’s face was tense, his eyes dark. It sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. “Voldemort doesn’t want people to know he’s back, so he’s using his Death Eaters to influence the Ministry into keeping its stance against me and Dumbledore so that he can hide better?”
It was the early hours of the morning. A couple hours before the rest of the house was due to start waking. Draco had been down in the common room. He was making the buttons for Potter’s debut as champion. He hadn’t noticed the common room emptying many hours ago, or that his hair was now falling in a mess around his face from all the times he’d run his hands through it. He definitely hadn’t noticed he’d started muttering to himself as he flitted around the table the buttons were spread over.
Draco was startled out of his thoughts by the door opening. Draco froze, one hand still in his hair. Slowly one large grey eye peaked around the door, followed by a blinding smile and a cloud of blonde hair.
Edgecombe had Potions after lunch. Draco planned on ambushing her on the way out, while they were still in Slytherin territory.
She reached into the pocket of her robes and pulled out one of the last things Draco expected to see, a shining crystal bottle of clear liquid that was unmistakably veritaserum. Before Draco had even fully shaken off his disbelief Pansy had taken the dropper out of the top and was dripping the first of three drops onto her tongue.
That was enough talking for one night, if Draco was getting so mushy. He said his goodnights and put up the journal.
Draco gritted his teeth and jerked his head in agreement. She wasn’t a problem that could sit. “I will. You’d best get to bed before we really are caught.”
They looked at each other, Draco raising his eyebrows in surprise. Luna pursed her lips and whispered. “It sounds like Cho Chang again. She was quite upset about Marietta Edgecombe's choice to leave. She almost cursed Zacharias Smith when he suggested that she should be obliviated.”
Draco tried to look abashed, but he was secretly pleased his apology had gone over well. He wasn’t used to giving them. When he was young, he used to reflexively apologize, constantly anxious he wasn’t living up to standard. When it became obvious that reprimands wouldn’t stop him, his father had started slapping his hand with the end of his cane everytime he did. After a year of that he was well clear of it. He’d rarely apologize since the age of eight.
Blaise folded up the parchment, making the animation of half a hanging man fold in on itself, and shoved it in his bag. “All done then? What did she say?”
He was bewildered to see that Zabini was in his compartment with Vincent and Greg. He usually chose to sit in a different compartment than Draco. He tried not to let it bother him, but he took one look at the seating arrangements, Zabini on one window seat with Greg sitting by the door on one side and Vincent by the door on the other, and decided he didn’t like it.
Finnigan sneered. “You don’t have the guts. You’re all talk and no action, just like all you Slytherins.”
What he heard made Draco bite his lip and his hands shake. His father seemed to be trying to bribe half the Ministry in a strangely single-minded attempt to obtain an object from them. The longer the summer went on the more desperate he seemed to become.
He didn’t really think it through when he barged in. If he had he might not have done it. It was worth it to see Potter and his flashing eyes up close again one last time before the summer. But seeing them in person sent another kind of cold rage flowing through him. How dare they ignore what had happened to Potter and focus on Skeeter of all people.
Blaise startled a bit, but he held out his hand with Draco’s letter balled up in his fist. Draco raised an eyebrow at the state of it; Blaise scowled. “It was bloody hard to even keep hold of the thing with you thrashing around. Be thankful I saved it at all you barmy arsehole.”
Pansy’s smile quickly dropped. “Ugh. I forgot you mentioned that last night. I don’t see why you see fit to up your stalking. Or why I have to help. You can’t do anything to help him you know. If you did you’d risk getting disinherited, or worse, frankly.”
When Blaise saw both girls, he narrowed his eyes. “Chang’s friend doesn’t look like she wants to be here.”
Draco sighed as Pansy poured another mug. “Fine. As recompense for the late nights and this new favor I am about to ask you, I will show you the glamour I use on my dark circles. Provided you keep it to yourself.”
Draco got up with a sigh. The floor seemed to lurch under him a bit, so Pansy grabbed his shoulder. Draco squeezed his eyes shut for a second to regain his balance; Blaise scrambled to stand on his other side.
“We wanted to write another couple of verses! But we couldn’t find rhymes for fat and ugly -- we wanted to sing about his mother, see --” Draco was vaguely aware of someone insulting him to the other Gryffindors, but he barely paused. It wasn’t Potter, what should he care? He could hardly even hear it over the pounding in his ears. “ -- we couldn’t fit in
Draco thought it was all good revenge for not only ignoring his help, but for all the time he spent thinking of him and all the dreams Draco had had of his eyes on him that made him wake up with a wet spot on his sheets. It felt like he was going crazy. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could take it without breaking.
He didn’t knock. He strode the last few steps with purpose and banged the door open to herald his presence.
It felt as if an icy shroud fell over Draco. Before he could think, he was acting. His wand in his hand and up under Crabbe’s chin, the tip of his wand pressing hard. Crabbe abruptly stopped grinning.
Pansy ripped off her piece of toast and chewed and swallowed. Her voice was still cloudy with sleep. “Piss off. No one but us is up this bloody early. If you’re going to drag me out of bed you can deal with some questionable facial expressions. Besides, your snorting is just sooo attractive is it?”
Pansy was careful to look Draco right in the eye when she said that so Draco could not mistake her meaning. No one knew if they were to be ‘punished’ by Umbridge yet. Draco didn’t know what he’d do if it came to that because he got angry over Quidditch.
He took a few secret passages. Anything to get away from that office it seemed. He didn’t even appear to be heading for the tower.
I would like to give an extra huge thank you to my beta FerchKalvaNiibi who still took time to beta this chapter even with all that's going on.
Draco cleared his throat. “Who was sending Dementors after Potter? He was in muggle territory wasn’t he?”
Draco had been preparing Weasley for humiliation by pretending to drop things in his presence every time Weasley was in viewing range. Draco could tell as soon as he and Potter came down to breakfast that all of Draco’s planning was already working, Weasley’s face was drawn and pale and he wasn’t stuffing his face like a pig.
The longer it went on, the more the praise started to sound like a rushing wall of noise that Draco could hardly even parse. Everytime the panic filled him, he’d freeze where he sat, staring off in the distance until Pansy or Blaise did something to knock him back into reality.
Uncle Severus's voice was clipped when he answered. “You had a panic attack in the Great Hall. Your friends brought you here where I administered a calming draught. Would you care to share what had such an effect on you? I thought you said you were practicing Occlumency?”
By the time the last drop had dissolved on his tongue, he was already feeling the effects. He took a second to poke around at the feeling in his mind. It was relaxing, really, a feeling like he
Greg met Draco’s eyes again, now that his blush had faded. He smiled a crooked smile and shrugged with his whole body. “Don’t matter much now, does it? Have to pass our O.W.L.s alone. We get to drop anything we’re really bad at next year. And with the Dark Lord…”
I would also like to say that I am a genderfluid nb person whose prefered pronouns are they/them and that I Do Not support JKR. I'm not going to stop writing and creating or being a part of a fandom that I love just because the person who started the ball rolling turned out bad. In fact I'm more motivated than ever to give my interpretation to things. I plan on retelling all three of the last books should that motivation continue to the end of this one. I have things planned out.
But as Monday crept in, Draco knew the peace couldn’t last. He had to set aside his calm, and even the mystery of who had tattled to Umbridge, to tackle the upcoming Slytherin-Gryffindor Quidditch game. There were Slytherins to rally and Gryffindors to curse, even Halloween passing with little notice in the chaos.
Potter was still following him. Nott always seemed to be around, with a book in his hands like he thought he was so sneaky. His mother sent him her first letter of the year; he sensed she was worried about him. He’d had to give most of the chocolates she’d sent with it to Greg and Vincent to keep even them from questioning him.
Luna moved to retake his arm and gave it an extra squeeze as they walked. They were silent for several minutes as they approached the spiral stairs that led to Ravenclaw tower.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “You were not. And anyway Draco’s problem is more important than hangman. Besides, I saved our game, you daft cow.”
Draco’s smile eased as they left the classroom and walked toward the stairs to the fifth floor. Looking down at Luna something prickled the back of his mind. “You know, now that we’re face-to-face again, I can’t help but notice that we have quite similar coloring. I don’t think I’ve seen a non-Malfoy with hair as blonde as me before.”
Edgecombe took another step back, prompting Draco’s company to perk up and Vincent and Greg to take a step forward. Edgecombe stopped in her tracks. “I’m- I’m not, I swear!”
Draco winced at The Dark Lord’s name. He thought he felt a muscle in his jaw tic, he was clenching it so tight. He was surprised Potter had caught on so fast. He nodded.
Pansy just shoved his shoulder. “Get up. Come on. Your calming draught is obviously wearing off. You’re going to fall asleep as soon as it leaves your system, you know. I suppose if you want to sleep here, though, I don’t care.”
Draco ended up sending her a new pair of expensive dress shoes with a permanent cushioning charm after remembering how she’d ended up barefoot by the end of the Yule Ball with some pretty bad blisters he’d had to make her some dittany for.
Even the oblique reference to Pansy’s father made Draco wince internally. The reason Pansy’s mother was allowed so much leeway when it came to raising their daughter was to do with his involvement in the last war. He and Draco’s father had been good friends in school and had both left it and joined the Dark Lord immediately. But while Draco’s father had been able to claim he was under the Imperius Curse, Parkinson could not, having been found by Aurors in the act. He was sentenced to the Dementor’s kiss. A secret Pansy had divulged only at the end of third year when she’d wept in relief that the Dementors were gone.
But he could see how this would discredit Potter. Draco’s eyes narrowed in suspicion. Having someone so obviously sent by the Ministry and so obviously against Dumbledore, and by extension, Potter, on the staff overlooking the children made it hard to be wishy-washy about things. It set up an us-or-them sort of dichotomy that children of Ministry employees would be hard-pressed to fight against.
Even the people he trusted -- Pansy and Blaise, Uncle Severus -- seemed to be looking at him with a worry he wasn’t used to seeing. It made him feel like he was cracking apart in front of everyone.
Blaise shrugged Draco’s hand off his shoulder, but didn’t shy away when Draco started tentatively running his hand through his hair again. His voice was serious and determined, if not a bit angry, when he demanded. “Ask me then. Ask me about my mother. It’s the only thing people really wonder about me. I’ve never told anyone the proper truth about it. You’d be the only ones. Ask.”
Blaise’s face showed extreme interest and he leaned forward over Pansy’s shoulder to get a better look at Draco’s reaction. “Potter, hmm. That makes sense. Pulling his pigtails. And you wouldn’t want to work for someone that wants to kill him. But you wouldn’t go against the grain for just any reason either. Guess he’s not bad looking. A little rumpled though.”
Luna’s eyes looked liquid in the dark. She stopped walking to face him. Draco swallowed heavily. “You shouldn’t wish away parts of yourself, Draco, things get better when you embrace all parts of yourself. I love even the parts of me that miss my mom terribly. Besides, if you weren’t who you are right now, we might not be friends.”
Pansy’s voice cracked toward the end and Draco’s eyes widened in surprise. He uncrossed his arms in concern when Pansy had to look away from him to compose herself. He’d been a second away from touching her knee in comfort when she turned back around, her glare as hard as ever and her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. Draco flinched back.
He worked as fast as he could, his body stiff, but with no sharp pain. When he finished he parted the privacy screens and met Pomfrey’s inquiring face. “Well? Any pain?”
Draco had a spell that Uncle Severus had taught him when he had gotten his acceptance letter from Hogwarts. The spell,
Pansy scoffed. Draco had almost forgotten she was there. “Men are cows, honestly.” She put a consoling hand on Blaise’s shoulder and Draco raised an eyebrow.
They both figured it wouldn’t be too bad being married. Draco certainly had the fortune Pansy wanted. And the manor. And Pansy would be free to be with whoever she wanted on the side because Draco wouldn’t care. The act of producing an heir would be awkward, but hopefully brief, and Pansy’s feelings wouldn’t get hurt when Draco never wanted a repeat performance.
The wait in the lead-up to the first Hogsmeade weekend was a special kind of torture for Draco. Instead of the anger that had been haunting him since the first day of term, he was now consumed with a gnawing worry. Now that he’d made his first active move against his father’s wishes, he was panicstricken anyone might find out.
Blaise paused to take a deep breath. “I don’t really remember him well. I just remember he was always smiling. He had a best friend from school that had followed him into the corps. My godfather. After my father died he was as brokenhearted as my mother. He looked in on us. Said he wanted me to grow up with a father figure. I guess he was around so much, mother and he eventually developed feelings. Mother and him got married when I was eight. I remember him a lot better than my own father. I called him dad before they even got married.”
Theo grinned maliciously. “Oh? I guess you haven’t heard then? I’m surprised the Great Draco Malfoy would be so slow on the uptake.”
Luna gave him one more smile before it melted into an intense, thoughtful look and she looked away toward the stairs. “Pandora. Pandora Malfoy Lovegood. I loved her a lot. She was quite smart, and talented. She was always trying to create new spells, I’m not sure she was trying to do anything in particular, I think she just liked the experimentation. The last one she was working on was quite blue. I was in the room, but she was able to shield me when the spell backfired.”
But his father was hardly around to chastise him for his lack of focus and his mother wouldn’t say anything. If anything he thought he saw her shoot him a small smile the last time he’d left. She had said he was looking a bit pale at dinner the night before.
He’d been unable to get himself together after the mild scare and had given far too much away. Pansy had gotten everything. She found out about his feelings for Potter.
When Draco tuned back into the world around him Pansy was giving him a desperate sort of look that he felt sure she’d be embarrassed by at any other time. “Draco. Ask us. Ask us the question, please.”
Draco was more furious than he’d ever been in his life. He spent the whole weekend in a fit of roaring temper, unable to stand being around others, but feeling cooped up and frustrated alone.
Draco stopped listening as the conversation around him slowly dissipated. He hoped his Slytherin compatriots heeded him and didn’t follow her around. He planned to keep a close eye on her himself now. She had two courses of action. If Draco scared her properly, she should quit Potter’s group and cease to be a problem. In which case she needed to tell one of Potter’s gang that she quit and Draco had to keep his group from seeing her.
“Shut up, you great idiot.” Pansy poked Draco hard just under his shoulder blade and then left her hand there. “It was a good plan. We wouldn’t have let you do it if it wasn’t. There wasn’t any other way really. Better now than later when she would know even more.”
Zabini took in Draco’s face and posture. He closed his eyes and sighed quietly. When he opened them again he dropped his arms. “I was afraid you’d say that. I imagine you would know.”
His father told him the news at dinner that night. He was glad Pansy had told him earlier so he could keep his real feelings in a box and smirk at the same news he’d almost cried at earlier that day. He was so glad he was good at Occlumency.
Draco felt on top of the world with the wind rushing through his hair, Potter’s eyes on him, and the admiration of all his housemates.
Draco felt he should be worried. But he also wanted Potter’s eyes on him more than he’d ever wanted anything. He took a step forward without realising. The passage they were in was small enough that Draco could feel Potter’s breath on his face, but Potter didn’t back up, still glaring at him.
But Potter turned away when the rest of the Gryffindor team came barreling down the pitch. As a couple of the Chasers hugged him, Draco felt the last of his control fade to dust. He screamed his words like it would penetrate Potter’s brain if he said it louder.
By Friday night every phase of his plan was complete and ready for the next day with the Gryffindorks none the wiser. Draco could hardly sleep for his excitement for the next morning when he’d see all the Gryffindor faces. Weasley’s. Potter’s.
There was a long pause as Umbridge set her quill back down again. Her words were slow and sure when she addressed him. “Are you bribing a Ministry official Mr. Malfoy? Using Potter’s ridiculous lies at that.” She paused to let her words sink in. Draco allowed his cold smile to melt off his face. “Tut, tut, Mr. Malfoy. Imagine if your father could hear you now. He’d be, so, disappointed.” Draco practically held his breath as Umbridge smiled. “I had high hopes for you Mr. Malfoy. But I’m afraid I’ll have to give you a week's detention. Any more
Chang was the last to walk away, and even then she shot a nasty look over her shoulder. Draco sneered at her and flipped her two fingers. She scoffed but hurried to catch up with their other friends.
The only thing that stopped him from worrying over the state of affairs recently was his new penpal. It turned out that Chang
She and her whole group stopped and turned to stare at Draco. Only Edgecombe’s face lit up with recognition, quickly followed by fear. He was surprised her voice didn’t shake. “What do you want? I need to get to Divination.”
Draco cleared his throat and crossed his arms in return, raising one eyebrow impatiently as if he didn’t know exactly what this was about. “Yes?”
the Snitch in his grasp already as Potter turned in desperation, their brooms neck and neck as they extended their arms.
Tears were building in Draco’s eyes and he was helpless to stop them. “I wouldn’t have abandoned him when he became champion like Weasley did. My father would be proud of me for once that I’d done as asked and befriended him, at first, and then absolutely furious when I gave up his ideals the closer I got to Potter. But I wouldn’t care about father for once. All I’d care about is finally being someone in Potter’s eyes.”
Draco could only watch as she shakily shoved it at Blaise. Draco met his eyes as he filled the dropper. “You don’t have to. Blaise, really.”
Draco didn’t respond but Blaise was already adjusting to sit next to where Draco was lying, his back against the headboard, so he could reach down and run a hand through Draco’s hair.
Luna was slow to answer. “Well…. It wasn’t Marietta Edgecombe that told Umbridge.” Draco froze on the spot. “That’s why you think you're to blame, right?”
“A year before I entered Hogwarts he died. Mother thought it was in the line of duty originally, but news made it to her that he’d been poisoned doing paperwork. I think the grief did something to her. She tracked down the man who she thought had done it, and worked her way into his good graces. He proposed. They got married. Then she poisoned him. Revenge for her second husband. He was a major politician with a lot of influence and money, she was the last person anyone suspected. When she was courting him she had made up with her family. He was a respectable pureblood sort, you know. She was thrust back into high society. She caused waves with her beauty.  I went off to Hogwarts about then. I guess with me gone most of the year she felt free to do as she pleased. She went along with any smarmy politician that was interested until they married. They were always dead about a year later, leaving us all their money.”
Draco felt a bit like an idiot. It made sense that the carriages were pulled by thestrals. Hardly anybody could see them these days and Hogwarts was known for having the first trained herd. But. “You could see the thestrals your first year?”
over the summer. I got too used to someone being there. I told myself I wouldn’t get too invested, I was just curious. Merlin. I’m such a liar. I learned from the best.”
Blaise was the one to snort this time, Pansy rolling her eyes and lying back down. “Of course you like someone who puts up with you and lets you nerd out. It doesn’t have to be Lovegood who did it. There are too many people to really be able to tell who did it.”
He’d known Pansy since he was five. Every year he entrusted her with more and more information about himself that she could have used against him at any time. Just last year he’d given her the ultimate weapon against him by telling her of his feelings for Potter. But all she’d ever done was work with him and share parts of herself in return. He didn’t think she’d told a single other person about her father.
He suddenly felt tears welling up. He wanted to hide behind his Occlumency walls, but he hadn’t been able to build them back up since his panic attack, his emotions too raw, his mind too tired.
Over time Draco noticed that Luna was doodling his blot into some sort of picture ... a lion’s mane. Slowly Luna added the other house symbols around it. The eagle was perched on the lion’s back, with the badger half under its paws. The snake curled completely around the front leg opposite the badger. If Draco was being fanciful he might think it looked like the snake was hugging it. Or strangling it. He knew which was more likely.
Draco sneered. “Red-haired Weasleys must attract other Gryffindors like flies to honey. There’s nothing special about them.” Draco had a thought that was so delicious he was unable to stop a smile from spreading slowly over his face. “But they do have
It didn’t help that it was Pansy’s idea either. “You should give them that spell you always use when you want to rant about Potter.”
Umbridge blinked several times and opened her mouth to speak, or croak, but Draco was quick to cut her off. “I wasn’t entirely sure you weren’t just stupid before, but it’s clear with how you punished Potter and the Weasleys that you know what you’re doing. I decided to come by to give you some
Greg gave his arm a bewildered look before nodding his agreement. Draco turned away from him to start marching off, hiding his embarrassment at having shown any sort of physical affection. He was getting far too complacent with all these friends he had now. “Let’s go then.”
Draco had barely thought about the Floo, more immediately worried about the owl mail, but Blaise was right.
Draco watched the moment when Blaise’s expression went from concealed anxiety to determination. He didn’t even respond before he was following Pansy in dripping three drops on his own tongue.
A different voice that might have been Uncle Severus’s cut through Pansy’s breathing narration. “Draco, tilt your head back, you need to ingest this.”
Draco had asked Luna to help him keep track of Edgecombe until she made her decision. He’d been apprehensive at first, not wanting to involve Luna in some of the less savory things he got into, but in the end had given in. He simply could not ignore that Luna had an edge with being a fellow Ravenclaw.
At lunch, Draco was reenacting Potter blowing up his cauldron in Potions that morning to Vincent, Greg, and Blaise, when Pansy and Milli dropped down beside him, bumping him into Blaise’s side. “Watch it, you-”
Draco had been sitting in the candlelit dining room with his mother. It was quiet while they ate, his father conspicuously absent. No matter how many meetings he had he usually made time to eat dinner with his family. That fact that he hadn’t on the night after Potter’s trial made Draco think nervously of the Dark Lord.
Luna stepped away and beamed at him again. “‘I’ve found it’s always good manners to ask, at least the first few times. Some people don’t like hugs. I’m glad you do though. You seem like someone who needs one.”
The one teacher Draco may have wanted to talk to was gone before he’d even come down to breakfast the day after despite this. The only person he might have trusted to talk about his feelings with, giving Draco a sour feeling. He could think of very few reasons why Professor Snape, his Uncle Severus, would leave now of all times.
Thinking of Luna’s plums, Draco had a last burst of sentimentality. He found he couldn’t bear the thought that she might end up tortured by Umbridge.
Eventually he called it good and noxed his lights. Either she would take it well or she wouldn’t. Hopefully she had been able to get information about fellow Ravenclaw Chang, at the very least.
There was only one carriage left when Draco reached them. He thought it was empty when he got in, but he was quickly joined by a younger blonde girl. She got in opposite him and stared at him with huge grey eyes.
Before he could ruminate any more on what an idiot he was, Madam Pomfrey’s voice pierced his aching skull as she bustled over from her office with two potion bottles. “Mr. Malfoy! It’s good to see you awake. I’m afraid you’ve suffered a minor concussion.” She set the bottles down on the bedside table and gingerly helped him to sit up. “Take these. One’s a painkiller and the other will help with bruises and swelling.”
They did manage to secure a compartment. It was easier than Draco had expected, but perhaps, given how everything turned out, several students had left just after the third task. They found one with just Millicent and Theo in it. Pansy was pleased and quickly plopped down next to Millicent. Draco followed after, sitting on their side to avoid getting squeezed in by Vincent and Greg.
Draco turned his face, finally freeing himself from those damn eyes, and stood up. He’d been so stupid. He paused a few steps away when he realized that Potter hadn’t moved. “Ten points from Gryffindor for being infuriating, Potter.”
Draco whipped his head around to stare at Vincent, his heart practically a stone in his chest. “What. What did you just say?”
Umbridge smiled again. Obviously not sensing where this was leading, like a toad in a slowly boiling cauldron of water. “Yes, I’ve run into Lucius several times over the course of my career as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. He and the Minister have had many meetings over the years. I’m pleased to hear he appreciates my work.”
Draco actually growled. He dropped Potter’s hands to grab at Potter’s robes, using them to pull Potter down on the floor with him and then flipped them so he was pinning Potter. He leaned as close to Potter’s face as he could so Potter could see just how much he meant his next words. His voice was practically a hiss. “I. Don’t. Care.”
Hello! I know it's been a very long while, but I'm back now. I had a lot of good reasons to have taken a break, but the important part is that I'm back. In fact I have three chapters all set that should keep me from having any big breaks again, barring unseen circumstances of course. I plan to post them every other Friday. It's only just barely Friday here, but I wanted to make sure I got this out.
So when Greg waylaid him after dinner on Wednesday he shouldn’t have been surprised. Greg was oddly shy when he caught Draco’s sleeve just before he turned toward the Defence classroom. “Hey, Draco? I know you’ve been busy, but I don’t understand the Potions essay.”
Draco waved her off. “No, it’s good. He was made captain of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team last year, right? So you know a fair bit about Quidditch, even though you don’t play.”
Draco nodded, suddenly tense. That question boded nothing like good news. “Why? Why ask, when you know I have?”
When his curtains were ripped open on Saturday after breakfast, which he’d skipped, he knew he was caught.
He turned to Vincent. “The Mudblood and the Weasel are both prefects this year. You should go sit in the other Slytherin fifth year compartment. We should be on guard from attacks from Weasel at the very least. I can’t be everywhere.”
Draco was aware now that Johnson was holding one of the twins back as they caught on to what Draco was saying through the haze of their victory. But Potter still wasn’t reacting. Still wasn’t paying much attention, now focused on his
None of that helped the persistent feeling of doom that crept over him. It felt like the situation was slipping through his fingers. Like his father’s cold hand clamped over the back of his neck when he made a mistake in public. He was barely able to sleep, when he did manage it it was light and filled with flashes of blood and his father’s eyes.
Draco turned and glared at Blaise. “Where’s Pansy? She wouldn’t slander me so.” Draco paused, noticing for the first time the direction they’d been walking. “And for that matter, why are we going the long way to the Great Hall?”
Edgecombe’s eyes widened. Chang must have noticed how uncomfortable Edgecombe was, because she stepped in front of her and addressed Draco with a glare. “Marietta doesn’t want any messages from you. You should leave her alone.”
Pansy snorted a laugh. “That’s a riot. And revenge for your comment the other day in the common room, don’t think I forgot. It’s not like it’s a privilege to stroke your hair, darling. You’re just needy.”
With Draco no longer having to worry about Potter, he turned his focus back to his studying. He sent a few more gossipy letters to Pansy telling her to look out for information involving the Ministry.
This went on for three days. Three days where Draco lived in a haze of resentment that didn’t allow him to concentrate on much else.
His information from the couple of Slytherin first years he’d managed to slip into the Weasley twins’ trials were a different story. Draco was pleased to find that instead of the out-and-out destructive inventions he’d been half expecting, they were actually developing useful, and in some cases, outright clever, objects. Draco decided to keep the spies working, with the intent to buy any newly for sale items, personally, as soon as they went on the market.
Draco gaped down at Luna. He supposed it was possible. If Luna’s mother had really been disowned then it made sense Draco hadn’t come across her when he studied the family line. He’d never personally met many of his relatives on his father’s side, his mother was much closer to her Black relatives. However….
Pansy had crept up behind him. Draco had almost jumped out of his skin when she’d put a hand on his shoulder.
Greg grimaced in turn and seemed to look at least a little contrite. He grunted out a “Sorry”, looking ready to bolt.
He didn’t know where he was being taken and tried to struggle away. It had no effect on whoever was dragging him around.
It wasn’t until he was lying in bed that night, his last night at home until the winter holidays, that the responsibility he would hold with his badge really hit him.
Montague shrugged, unrepentant. “Flint didn’t want you involved in anything. We thought you’d be too easily recognizable anyway, with Potter on the team.”
Draco clicked his tongue. “I don’t see why you care anyway Blaise, you don’t have to marry either of us.”
Finnigan went from white to red faster than Draco thought possible. Even Finnigan’s freckles disappeared under his blush.
He couldn’t see Potter, who was blocked by said pillar, so Draco stepped gingerly to the side, to see without Potter becoming aware of him. He was dabbing at his left hand with his right sleeve and wincing. Draco saw a dribble of blood slide off his hand and down to the floor.
Draco sat back on his heels and just looked at Potter. He wanted to kiss his hand. He wanted to wrap his arms around Potter’s neck and rest his forehead on his shoulder. He grimaced. He couldn’t believe himself.
Draco’s eyes watered against his will and he turned further away. His voice was thick when he answered her. “Not when it’s us. When it’s me.”
Because Potter always looked ready to fly off the handle, Draco contributed only a minimal effort to maintain their rivalry. Give a detention there, take some points here, just the usual things to be expected from his new position really. The other Slytherin prefects didn’t care much that he’d been slacking a bit when it came to watching the first years, as usually the seventh year prefects liked doing this to increase their final bit of influence; also, that first week when nobody wanted it Draco had volunteered for patrol every night. And half those patrols approached Gryffindor tower.
Draco cleared his throat. “Luna said that Granger made them sign a cursed parchment that would make it so everyone would know who had told Umbridge. But all the members were accounted for and blemish free after the incident. So it can’t have been a member of Potter’s group.”
The three of them were silent down to the dungeon, or at least Draco thought they were, as lost in his own thoughts as he was.
Draco didn’t ask, he just nodded once in approval. Luna smiled a bit and stood on her toes to wrap her arms around his neck in goodbye. Draco waited until he could hear Luna talking to Chang before he headed back toward the dungeons.
After a couple hours of inane chatting Draco couldn’t stand the cramped compartment anymore. He announced that he was going for a walk down the train and stood up without waiting for anybody to comment.
Severus’s lips thinned and his eyes hardened. “You must be, Draco. Or at least fast approaching there. I’ll help you any way I can, but you must be sure about everything you do now. Every action has a consequence, and in war, those consequences are extreme. Things you will have to live with.”
It took Draco all of Saturday to decide, but he ended up telling Pansy and Blaise about Potter’s plans. They pestered him endlessly about his source, but Draco refused to reveal anything.
Draco gave his all, not too proud to throw a low blow if it got him what he wanted. “Or perhaps,” Draco leered and savored the moment before his next words landed, “you can remember what
Luna scuffed her shoe along the floor. “You would have gotten along, I think. I’ve noticed you also like solving puzzles. You don’t have to be sorry though, I wouldn’t be me if it hadn’t happened, so wishing it away is like wishing parts of myself away too. I’m sure I’ll see her again, eventually.”
Draco sighed and rubbed at his temple. “I’m terribly sore and would like nothing more than to not think about this incident. If you could find out what happened to Potter and pals before I get out of here, that would be helpful.”
He felt a hand on his arm and looked over at Luna. He could still feel the steel in his eyes. Luna was smiling a soft, secretive smile. “You wouldn’t be doing this if you weren’t.”
If he’d been friends with Potter would he be able to do a better job? If Harry- if Potter had taken his hand first year? He liked to think he’d at least be doing a better job than the Weasel. He almost didn’t believe it when he’d left Potter’s side in the beginning of the year, leaving a perfect opening for Draco to set the school against Potter.
Pomfrey handed him the pajamas and closed the privacy screens. “Let me know if you need help, or if something hurts when you move around.”
It was just like Pansy’s mother, rushing Pansy’s official entrance into society. She wasn’t meant to debut officially until next summer, a year before she came of age. She would have a ball to announce that she was eligible to start receiving marriage offers throughout the following year, and meanwhile she was to start showing up to the adult functions to prove what a capable wife she would be. Pansy’s mother had always been anxious about Pansy though, worried she wouldn’t match well, or worse, that she would refuse an arranged marriage at all in the name of rebellion.
downstairs. If you’re a couple then I’m a Gryffindor. You're more bent than I am. And Marco broke up with me as soon as we were caught.” Blaise looked uncomfortable. “He said he was just fooling around anyway.”
Blaise came to pick him up the following morning just as he’d finished changing back into his school robes. As soon as they were out in the hallway Blaise raised an eyebrow at him. “Pomfrey not able to get rid of that one?”
Draco felt more stable, but then, barely out of the office, he lurched forward. Blaise and Pansy jumped to steady him, but Draco wasn’t sure it was exhaustion right then.
Luna frowned thoughtfully. “I believe one of his parents may be attached to a lidérc and he’s feeling the residual effects.”
Montague shrugged. “Don’t know really. Snape said he took care of it when I asked, but he didn’t say where he put it. Storage somewhere probably. Though I’d be happier if it was off the grounds to be honest. Don’t want those twins to use it on someone else.”
Umbridge and the Headmaster himself also featured prominently. There was no denying now that Umbridge was the lowest of the low. Draco had never even
Reading the actual content of the letter, the strangest thing she’d done was point out that Draco might need more practise in DADA than any other subject. Draco was good at DADA regularly, and with Umbridge in place he was guaranteed to be top of the class. Draco could only assume that meant that Umbridge was the one watching everyone’s communications. That or father, who was also mentioned in the letter. Either one made sense, especially paired with Draco’s memory of his father having meetings with Edgecombe senior.
Pansy didn’t let up though. “Who was that from to get you smiling so early in the morning anyway? Your mom?”
Draco made Pansy promise not to tell anyone else. Especially his mother who was alone on the platform. Pansy had agreed and kissed his cheek goodbye.
Draco stared at Montague with a frown. He’d forgotten about that. “Whatever happened to that old cabinet anyway?”
Sorry this Chapter took a bit longer, right after I posted the last one I got a new job, and with the virus stuff going on it's especially busy as it's a pharmacy tech job. Thank your health care workers! Doctors are so busy they can't always answer their phones around here.
Draco didn’t think. He landed immediately, intent on checking on Potter. If Potter had been seriously injured on his behalf…
been spending a lot of time with Zabini, Zabini joining him at meals, in the corridors, and even joining him and Pansy to work on homework. “What’s it to you who I spend my time with?”
Potter swallowed hard and nodded. Draco noticed that his eyes looked a bit damp. He couldn’t blame him. He’d been in there for hours and hours. Draco’s eyes probably looked crazy as he contemplated it.
Draco gave a derisive laugh. “You hardly need me to tell you, you Gryffindors have your Saint Potter for that. Why believe anything
Draco’s eyebrows flew up in surprise as he looked at Blaise. He might have expected Pansy to stay -- to help or to yell at him for scaring her -- but Blaise had startled him. Blaise didn’t meet his eye, looking over at Snape in determination. Draco smiled, a warm feeling spreading through his chest replacing the earlier cold pain.
At one point, a second year Gryffindor had passed by, on a dare from his friends to find the kitchens. Draco had been so irate he’d reduced the boy to tears. He spent the rest of the time waiting trying not to feel bad about it while staring at the notebook waiting for Luna’s message.
Pansy grabbed Draco’s hands away from his face so that she could stare him in the eye. Her voice was tense. “I just got a letter from my mother this morning. The Ministry made another move. She said they’ve made Umbridge the High Inquisitor. They want her to inspect other classes!”
Draco rolled his eyes and settled back in his chair. It didn’t matter what happened before, he would more than make up for it now. He hoped something was really wrong with Weasley. Giving Weasley hell would hurt Potter just as much as if it were him. Draco would also be able to get some revenge for Weasley having left Potter last year, taking the role of Potter’s best friend and squandering it. Oh, yes, this would be some beautiful revenge.
Draco sat up slowly, and managed to tilt his head back. Several drops of a potion were dropped down the back of his throat. He thought for a second he might drown, before he remembered to swallow.
In the end they helped anyway, in the name of Draco’s crush. With Blaise now helping Pansy in sending him knowing looks and pointed eyebrow wiggles, Draco had what felt like a permanent blush the whole time they were scheming.
But by the time he’d landed, Johnson was already checking on him and he was already brushing it off.
Draco grimaced. He hadn’t actually planned what he’d wanted to say. But he was here now and had to say something. “Er, I, I just wanted to uh. Apologize. To you. For third year. You did heal me quite well. I wasn’t thinking how my saying you hadn’t would affect you. I- I didn’t really think the whole thing through.”
Draco sent the list of suggestions to Luna Tuesday night. She promised that she’d bring them to the Golden Trio.
Draco’s entire torso shook with his sob. Pansy’s hand flinched away and Blaise tensed before bringing his other hand up to stroke through Draco’s hair.
His mother’s mouth pulled up at one corner briefly before she took a sip of her wine. She made sure to set it firmly back down and dab her mouth with her cloth napkin before she answered. “It seems that Harry Potter is cleared of all his charges of underage magic. Apparently the latest incident was considered self-defense against some Dementors. Dumbledore spoke in his favor of course.”
Draco shut his eyes for a second. He thought they were done discussing it. “How do you figure that?”
His glare was twice as angry as Potter’s, and 20 times less attractive in Draco’s opinion. He didn’t even bother to keep his voice down. “What the fuck! What’d you run into me for, tosser!”
Theo smirked through a greeting to Draco before turning to talk to Greg in the seat next to him. Draco would never admit it but Theo made him a bit nervous. They grew up in all the same circles, Theo also being a member of the sacred 28, but his father was a bit older than Draco’s. He easily could have been the so-called ‘prince of Slytherin’ had he put in more effort and tried to out-maneuver Draco. Instead he kept to himself, preferring to keep to the edges of Draco’s crowd and spend most of his time in his studies. That unnerved Draco. If Theo challenged him outright he could fight back and then it’d be done, but the way things were, it made Draco expect a knife in his back -- despite having now completed four years with no real problem.
Lucius smiled so his teeth showed. “Yes, I do know her. A Dolores Umbridge. We’ve worked together quite a bit over the summer.” Lucius turned a sharp look onto Draco. “I expect you to honor that friendship and work hard in her class. If you follow her direction you should have a rewarding year. I don’t want to hear of you going against her, Draco.”
Pansy’s voice was surprisingly gentle when she cut through Draco’s thoughts. “We can talk about that later. We need an excuse for Draco’s leaving the Great Hall earlier. Then we need to get him to bed. You’re not looking too good, darling.“
He heard Potter’s loud “Malfoy, wait-”, but he hurried down the corridor, almost separating from his friends to escape.
Luna hummed in agreement, even as she tightened her hold on his arm and started moving again. “There is. Don’t worry about the list though, I took your advice and used my initials. Hermione liked the idea so much she had everyone use theirs and she said she triple checked that her curse was still functional.”
Draco didn’t let them get very far before he lost another battle with himself and stopped, forcing them to stop too. He glared at the floor and refused to turn around when he addressed Potter. “Umbridge is monitoring all communications.”
Turning over in bed, Draco was able to admit to himself that some of the things he’d done since to get Potter’s attention were a little much. Maybe even immature. Especially faced with a sudden dead body.
“Weren’t you over by Gryffindor tower again?” Potter seemed to have spoken without thinking, snapping his mouth shut as soon as he realized what he’d asked.
Worse than watching Potter with his friends, though, was watching him when he was alone. He’d just go and sit by the lake staring at nothing for hours, or wander around not looking where he was going. Once they’d even bumped shoulders and Potter had only given him a bleary look when Draco had snapped at him.
Draco raised an eyebrow, not sure if he should feel offended. “I have a lot of money and think a lot of my family.”
Draco unfroze enough to turn his head to look at Luna. “That doesn’t mean she didn’t tell. She could just be cutting ties before she got found out.”
Draco snorted, but was quick to unwrap the chocolates, popping one in his mouth. They always waited until the week before Pansy’s birthday on July 9th to deal with their birthdays, despite Draco’s being two days after the end of term, so they could exchange gifts at the same time. Draco didn’t care, he still got his first. He hummed in satisfaction. He supposed he did owe Pansy a nice birthday gift.
I missed a week there because my internet was down I'm very sorry. I hope you enjoy this chapter though!
They’d worked everything out from there. Pansy had pitied him and agreed to help him. She’d pose as his beard essentially until one or the other of them found someone they really wanted. In exchange he promised to offer his hand to Pansy himself should the need arise. If he were still single.
Draco sat for a second in a weird daze before he followed her out of the carriage door. Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy were all waiting for him. Pansy had a bewildered expression on her face. “You had to share a carriage with Loony Lovegood? Merlin, how did you survive that?”
Pansy bumped him with her hip in exasperation. “Alright then, I’ll start spreading it around. Let’s get you to the dorms before you fall asleep at Snape’s desk. I’m not carrying your fat ass.”
Draco crossed his arms and dropped his smile for a sneer, leaning into his drawl for emphasis. “Please. Spare us the idiocy. We heard that you and Chang were involving yourselves with something Potter is doing. I just wanted to see how true it was before I let my father know.”
Draco himself was working on transfiguring a couple hundred badges and had roped Milli into helping him. He would have liked to have done this last bit alone, but he’d learned that it was unfeasible to try and make that many badges himself after last year.
Pansy groaned and Draco looked up, smiling. His smile fell away when he met the eyes of Blaise Zabini just down the table from them. Zabini smirked at him and gave him a two finger salute before going back to his breakfast.
With an expression like that, Draco was willing to believe whatever it was Potter would end up telling them happened. There were already rumors flying around the school that Potter had said that Voldemort had returned. Draco hadn’t gotten anywhere near close enough to hear. He’d seen Potter and frozen. He was lucky Pansy was next to him and managed to pull him away and back up to the castle.
His mother actually reached across the table and grabbed both of Draco’s hands in hers. Her brown eyes burned. “Draco. You don’t have much longer to be a child. You didn’t choose anything, not yet. But, whatever happens I promise I’m going to make sure you get through this. Do you understand?”
Draco shut his eyes for a second to focus. He opened them and immediately met Potter’s eyes. “It’s only dittany Potter. A potion for healing wounds. It’s not going to do much with an injury like this, but it should help calm the bleeding down and maybe the swelling.”
With Pansy occupied following Edgecombe, Draco was able to focus on planning his Weasley revenge. Davies had come back with news that the Weasel was a nervous player to an almost unbelievable degree. Draco had never been so pleased.
Pansy roughly pushed the homework he’d had scattered over his bed, a push that sent them falling over the other end with a thump that made Draco wince. Then she pushed Blaise a bit until he took the hint and crawled to the other side of Draco’s bed. Pansy pulled Draco’s curtains closed and cast hurried, but powerful feeling, silencing and locking charms. Then she planted herself right in front of Draco with her arms crossed.
Draco turned away to glare at the floor. “I’m just trying to make up for something that was my fault in the first place.”
Draco carefully turned his head at a normal speed. It was indeed Susan Bones. Along with the two fifth year Hufflepuff prefects, and two other boys Draco didn’t know as well, although he thought one might have been a student who had been petrified in second year. The other boy looked snotty, which Draco hadn’t guessed a Hufflepuff could do. Granger must have asked them at a prefect’s meeting without Draco noticing.
They hadn’t been serious though, just a bit of freedom for Draco really. He hadn’t even been mad when he’d stumbled on Hristo with his tongue in a Ravenclaw sixth year’s mouth about a week before the third task, merely shrugged and nodded them on. He’d nearly forgotten about him entirely in the wake of the third task and all the moral conundrums Draco had been contemplating since.
Draco frowned as he looked Pansy over. The dark circles under her eyes seemed to take up half her face, her eyes bloodshot and seemingly bulging out of her eye sockets the more coffee she downed. He may have felt a bit of guilt.
They practically fell onto a couch in the back of the common room under the biggest window to the lake. Blaise cast some muffling charms around the couch with a detached air. Pansy was clinging to Draco’s arm.
Draco and his friends kept to themselves and spent the next day sitting quietly together working on homework or reading, trying to reconcile the new truths they’d learned about each other. Draco found it peaceful. Every once in a while a head would fall onto a shoulder or a foot would nudge up against a shin. It was nice to just be with his friends without worrying about anything for once.
The wait for the meeting to be over was almost unbearable. Potter hadn’t come to find him beforehand this time. Draco wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing, but it did leave Draco alone, his anxiety building.
Pansy frowned. “I already did before you sat down. But we can’t keep doing this in the Great Hall, other Slytherins will say something. That we’re conspiring against the house.”
Blaise laughed again, in that way that said clearly that nothing was funny. “What a class act we are. Coming from families of murderers. All of us are too independent by half and too lonely and scared by far. It’s no wonder we go so well together.”
When Lucius first laid eyes on Draco’s test scores, he immediately noticed his son had once again fallen a spot below Granger in all their classes, and was also below Potter in DADA; the cold look in his father’s eyes almost made Draco fear for his safety for a second.
Draco sneered. “What do I care who Blaise has been snogging? As long as it’s not me. At least he has his uses; what are you good for, Nott?”
Potter’s eyes narrowed. Draco knew he was about to get yelled at again. He headed it off. His voice was tense and defensive. “I care alright. Don’t ask me why.”
wasn’t going to be anyway. Although he thought there were several good male candidates. Maybe Thomas. Hell, if Dumbledore and Mcgonagall wanted to give him some confidence, Longbottom would be an all right choice really.
Draco blinked slowly a couple of times, half wondering if the person in front of him would disappear. “Er, hello Luna. I… suppose that would be okay.”
Draco’s voice was hoarser than he meant it to be. “Take notes, Blaise, I expect my hair stroked regularly.”
He and Zabini were coming in the common room entrance when he was knocked back into reality by way of Theo shoulder checking him deliberately on the way out.
Draco flushed. “Yes, really! She doesn’t mind when I’m not careful of people’s feelings, she calls me sweet, and she’s incredibly insightful. We talk about Potter and thestrals. Also I think we’re cousins. Her mother was a Malfoy, apparently.”
Which was why he was so shocked when the tapestry he was hiding behind was ripped back only ten minutes after he’d hidden behind it, with a loud shout of “Malfoy!”
Remembering Potter clinging onto Diggory in a panic made Draco’s face twist up in a vague horror he couldn’t really place. In all the years they'd been at Hogwarts, through all the things Potter seemed to get involved with, from the Philosopher's stone nonsense in first year, the heir of Slytherin debacle, to the dementors and Sirius Black, hell, even facing down a
He tried to spend as much time with his parents as he could, especially his mother, as he missed her, missed both of them really, quite a bit while he was gone. Not that he could ever admit it. But his mother had a duty to host several dinner and garden parties with the other ladies of the sacred 28, to stay apprised of the social politics that ran rampant through their circles.
Pomfrey opened the door with a spell, before bustling back to her office, practically radiating disapproval.
Draco didn’t give Blaise time to respond, marching forward into the Great Hall with his chin high. He didn’t look over at the Gryffindor table as he walked past it. He grinned when the Slytherins started clapping as he sat down.
Pansy and Blaise both gave him weird looks, even as he passed Pansy back her mirror to write to Luna. “Her father is the head of the Floo Network. Father talked to him a couple times over the summer. He’s in Fudge’s pocket. Possibly father’s too.”
1. I know that word of god is that Tracey Davis and Roger Davies are not related but.... I like it better if they are so now Roger is her older brother.
Draco’s eyes widened in shock as his gaze stayed transfixed by the drop. Once it splattered, Draco lost it.
After a second Pansy sighed and sat on the edge of his bed. “Hooch blew Potter and Weasley off you and sent them off to McGonagall. Vince was too busy busting a lung laughing that he was no help. Hooch and Snape got you up to the hospital wing. You look better already, you had blood all over your face and a broken nose. It was awful Draco! Snape took Vince off to his office after he was sure you were okay. We haven’t seen him since.”
As soon as Draco turned to her, the glow of a good scheme about him, she held a finger up in his face. “No. I need at least two more cups of coffee before I will deal with whatever this is.”
Blackness creeping along the edges of his vision alerted him that something was wrong. He snapped his head away, but the blackness followed. He felt like he was underwater. Had he been poisoned? A hand ripped his letter from his hands, and arms practically lifted him up off the bench and started dragging him out of the Great Hall.
of someone using a Black Quill in that manner before, and he’d heard of some truly disgusting torture methods from some of the books in the manor’s library. The fact that she’d use it on a fifteen year old on top of that was unfathomable to Draco. The Dark Lord could take lessons from her.
Ever since he’d left Potter in that hallway he’d wanted to enact this plan. But now he could feel the blood rushing out of his face with every step he took. His hands were already shaking. He wasn’t a bloody Gryffindor. If he hadn’t felt such a deep, spiraling pit of guilt and fear clawing its way up his stomach like a rabid beast he never could have kept walking.
Zabini crossed his arms. “They want to discredit Dumbledore and Potter, don’t they? The Dark Lord must really be back then.”
Pansy chimed in, as usual, just when Draco least wanted her to. “Any other year and you’d be practically preening at such an accomplishment.” Pansy elbowed him gently in the arm. “Maybe you should just tell him that you’d never leave his side if he just asked.”
Potter sat up and rubbed the back of his head  absentmindedly, his eyes not leaving Draco’s, his voice sounded rough. “You do care. For some reason. What the hell Malfoy?”
Draco swallowed, looking down at his hands that were tangled together. He imagined what they would look like with words carved into them and squeezed them tighter. “She’s using a Black Quill on him. Having him write over and over until the words don’t go away.”
She suddenly burst into speech again, making both boys flinch. “And mother! She lets his body sit and rot in a back room because she’d rather have an evil, awful person in her house than risk losing her
He’d thought he hated Potter until then. He really had. But he had to admit that maybe the hate really stemmed from getting denied what he had really wanted for the first time. He’d never wanted to be friends with someone so badly as he had that first year. The want had filled his whole being, and being denied it had sent rage burning through his veins the way it never had before.
Blaise’s eyes had widened a little in surprise before he hid it. His voice was rough. “Snape’s going to be mad if I’m late.”
Did you hear the news? I hope you haven’t, I would hate for you to hear this from anyone who might tell you over at your place. I heard from my mother at breakfast. Potter’s been temporarily expelled! He was caught doing underaged magic in front of his muggle relatives. The ministry wanted to expel him outright and break his wand, but Dumbledore was only just able to at least get him a trial. It’s set for next week sometime I think. I couldn’t ask for too many details as you know. I’m so sorry Draco! I hope he does okay if only for your sake.
Pomfrey must have heard them leave, as she came out of her office to check on him as soon as they were gone. She had pajamas in her hand and Draco would be annoyed at what that meant, but he really didn't want to go back to the Slytherin dorms.
Blaise tried to get up, probably wanting to run away, but Draco clung to his shoulder until he laid back down. Blaise’s voice was tense. “Would knowing one of my secrets really make you feel better?”
Draco’s eyes practically fell out of his head in shock and horror as a Bludger slammed into Potter’s back so hard he was almost folded in half backwards before he fell forward off his broom and to the ground.
It seemed Potter was though -- he seemed much too distracted for it to be anything else. Luna was still with him too, maybe he could get confirmation from her? He was glad to see that she was smart enough to not pay him any mind when she saw him. He was half worried she’d wave at him or something.
at him. He couldn’t let that stand. He sneered, letting his fury come to the front to block out how shaken he still was from Potter’s fall.
Blaise scoffed. “If you want us to leave because you don’t feel good, you could just say. You don’t need to be a ponce about it.”
Recognizing Luna, Draco blew out a sigh and slowly lowered his hand. It was strange seeing Luna in person again. He’d only half looked at her in that first meeting in the first place, and had avoided her in public all year. It made Draco unusually nervous, afraid that maybe this girl wasn’t who he’d been talking to after all.
Draco did want to hurt Potter. To make his friends grow buck teeth until Potter’s eyes filled with rage and panic, to make Potter look as foolish as he really was by luring him out in the middle of the night, to put Potter in his place and show him just how much better Draco himself was. To get his hands on Potter and push him around. To make Potter do things for Draco.
He only got away with it for about two days. It was at that point a problem he had all but forgotten about reared its head again. He’d been ignoring Vincent and Greg. He normally tutored them quite extensively as a sort of repayment to their fathers for ordering them to listen to Draco.
Umbridge opened her mouth and shrilled at him. “What do you think you’re doing? Barging in like this!”
Draco couldn’t handle patrol that night either, but he resolved to start again the next night no matter how he was feeling. Potter was in a strange mood and Draco wasn’t sure if that made him more or less likely to get into trouble.
Draco’s eyes widened. “What does that even mean? She’s going to review the teachers?” Draco felt his forehead crease. He knew why that should concern him but… “Why do you even care so much Pansy? You think my concern over Potter is stupid.”
Luna turned and looked back at Draco. She seemed to think quite hard for a minute before smiling again. “They have to walk the path they’re on!”
Draco tried to follow her words, even as his breath kept hitching, snagged somewhere in his chest. The blackness slowly retreated as he persisted, though, so he kept forcing the air in and out.
anything about it. With Potter’s threat hanging over his head he had to step carefully. He couldn’t go to anyone on Potter’s side, they would sooner hex him than trust him, and no one he could go to would care. He thought about Uncle Severus for a while, but ultimately decided that even if he knew he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it either.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Blaise shift awkwardly. Draco suddenly wondered if Blaise ever felt left out: Left out of the relationship between him and Pansy, left out of Draco’s gang of Slytherins, left out of the core of pureblood society. As far as Draco knew, Blaise hadn’t been close to anyone else before he threw in with him and Pansy.
Draco felt tired. Drained. He didn’t want to think about why Umbridge would go through his mail, or what his father was up to, or even -- he suddenly thought -- how badly this would affect Potter and his friends. If a single one of them wrote about the defence club to someone outside the castle, Potter was ruined. Not even mentioning how many other secrets he was probably keeping from Umbridge.
Draco smiled again and dropped his arms, taking two steps forward, until he was only a couple steps away from Edgecombe. “Let’s
Draco practically growled and looked away from Potter. “Don’t be so small minded Potter. Of course she’s not a Death Eater, she fully believes in what she’s saying.” He turned back to Potter to impress on him what he was saying next. “That doesn’t mean that the Ministry isn’t vulnerable to Death Eater influence while they are in denial.”
It filled Draco with a low simmering hatred. They were clearly trying, but nothing they seemed to do helped. He hated it because it filled his head with familiar what-if’s that he had no time or energy to be thinking about now when he was meant to be coming to some sort of decision.
Draco was surprised when the Ravenclaw fifth year’s prefects, Goldstein and the other Patil twin, walked in with two other Ravenclaw boys Draco only sort of recognized from their shared Herbology class.
Draco grinned at Blaise as he took his letter. “Thank you.” Pansy made a startled noise next to him. “Both of you. Don’t expect to hear it again though, I’m still loopy on calming draught you know.”
Potter grabbed a couple handfuls of Draco’s robes and shoved him back. Draco stumbled a few steps back and fell. Draco grabbed Potter’s hands and squeezed, hard, to get him to let go, but Potter’s hands barely budged.
Luna grinned even wider, if possible, and threw her arms around Draco’s shoulders. Draco carefully wrapped his own arms around her, noticing that she had gone up on her toes to reach his shoulders. He awkwardly patted her back a couple times.
Draco smiled back. “Yes. He especially appreciates everything you’ve done in regards to Potter. It’s good to see a teacher that will shut him up and put him in his place.”
Blaise…. Well. He shouldn’t trust Blaise really, he supposed. But Blaise was hard not to trust. When he’d been open to them about his affair right away, despite them hardly being friends yet. The way he sometimes gave off the impression that he just wanted to be included. The way he looked at him and Pansy like they were Salazar’s own gift to him when they paid him any attention. It was hard to fake that. Hell, Draco had traded his friendship with Nott for Blaise.
Once Draco was ensconced in his bed again down in the dungeons, he could no longer put off his desire to write to Lovegood about the thestrals.
Draco took a deep breath and looked down at his hands. He didn’t know how to tell Snape that it had. He did get panic attacks at home. And at school. Not like this, but. His father would lecture him and all Draco could think about was how he’d never live up to expectations and his hands would shake and his breathing would get rapid, fear climbing his throat, choking him.
Draco scoffed before he could stop himself. Luna turned to look at him. Draco met her eye against his better judgement. “It’s just. I wish away parts of myself all the time. Wish away, push down, ignore. I can’t imagine you would be someone else with your mother around. You’d just be you, but happier. If people are going to wish away parts of themselves anyway, it may as well be the sad parts.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Fine. But only if Milli can help me. I won’t tell her why we need to follow Edgecombe, just that you want information on her. And I get to share the glamour with her, since she’s helping.”
Draco unfolded his legs and leaned his elbows on the edge of Umbridge’s desk. “That’s the thing, though, isn’t it? We both know he’s not lying. I doubt it’s merely old Slytherin house pride that has you helping the children of the Dark Lord’s followers.”
Draco just blinked at the notebook for a minute. He suddenly wanted this very much, despite knowing what a bad idea it was.
“Now, I’m quite busy. Go along.” She gave him a shooing gesture that would have made his father’s blood boil, but only filled him with relief that he could leave.
When he was ready, he slowly opened his eyes. He noticed Blaise must have sat down while his eyes were closed. Draco turned to Pansy, letting himself recognise how worried both her and Blaise looked. He took one more breath in and out. His voice was hushed and tight when he was able to get it out. “Put up a Muffliato Pansy. Now.”
Potter didn’t seem to take his eyes off Draco once the whole class. Draco couldn’t tell what he was thinking, but it wasn’t about Umbridge for once. He thought he was going to go mad.
Later there had been fumbling in an abandoned classroom, Hristo’s stubble on his thighs and his tongue somewhere much more pleasurable. Hristo’s thumb against his bottom lip and his deep voice husky. “They don’t make lips like yours in Bulgaria.” Before Draco had dropped to his knees to return the favor.
Draco sat up and glared; her hand fell away. “My ass is not fat!” Draco whipped around to face Blaise who raised an eyebrow at him. “That’s it! Blaise, you’re on hair stroking duty! Pansy is fired!”
Draco grimaced and flushed to the roots of his hair. “He’s not rumpled he’s-! You know what! I don’t care. Pansy I hate you, I can’t believe you said that!”
“Got to make them perfect. That’ll show Potter. Can’t wait to spread them around. It will be sure to get Potter’s attention. See him ignore me now!”’
When Draco was just starting his first year he’d been concerned about other students reading his mail, since they would all be getting it at the same time. His mother had wanted him to write regularly despite his fears, and so they’d set up a system, just the two of them. They had never actually used it before.
Looking from his hands back into his mother’s face told him that she didn’t seem surprised. She nodded firmly and, once the magic had stopped, released his hands to finish eating.
Draco actually leaned back at that last part worried Pansy might do something rash. Montague saw it and leered at him. It gave Draco an idea of what Pansy’s escape plan was.
Pansy was quick to regain his attention. “We know you’ve been avoiding us, and we have a good idea why. The question, Draco, is how in Salazar’s name you think we could have betrayed you!”
2.  I found out about the Black Quill/Blood Quill thing fairly recently, so I knew it's official name but not it's origins when I wrote about it. It's lore will be a bit mixed.
Draco felt Zabini tense up beside him. He adopted an even colder look and tone, hoping that whatever Zabini had done wasn’t too bad. “I assure you there is nothing you could tell me that would come as a surprise.”
Draco purposely let his face soften. His voice almost came out as a croak. “Thanks Pansy. I do appreciate it.”
When Dumbledore spoke those words a rushing sound seemed to fill Draco’s ears. He knew his role now.
that close, and he’d been prepared to believe anything Potter said just seeing his face after the maze.
Blaise glanced suspiciously around behind him at the mention of Potter’s group. The closest people to them were Vincent, Greg, and Milli sitting a few seats down from Pansy, but Draco had already cast a
Across the corridor from the Potions classroom next door, was none other than Harry Potter himself. Potter stood alone, leaning on the wall, and his wide eyes had caught Draco’s as soon as he’d crossed the threshold. Even after Draco had been righted, he stood still for almost a minute just looking into Potter’s eyes. Usually Potter was easy to read, but Draco wasn’t sure what he was seeing cross Potter’s face this time. All Draco could think about was Potter’s blood on the floor, and his mother’s letter, and Potter’s own reckless stupidity.
Blaise made a noise of agreement. “We still don’t know who did betray Potter. It’s ironic, but we’re the only three who know who is clear of suspicion.”
Umbridge didn’t look away from Draco’s eyes. Her voice was carefully pleasant when she spoke. “I’m not sure I understand your meaning.”
He had been distracted working on his Occlumency, trying to store his anxiety in a new box and so had been patrolling for longer than usual. It had gone midnight when he saw Potter exit the office.
The longer it took the new Hogwarts lists to arrive the more nervous Draco got. It was far too late to be able to do anything about whatever decision was made, but doing nothing tightened his throat while a horror rose up in the back of his mind.
Blaise raised an eyebrow at him. “I thought you told him off for that? He’s been actively avoiding you the last two days.”
Her eyes lit up. “Oh! I’ve been thinking about that! I think it’s more than just seeing someone die that lets you see them, I think you really have to process it and feel the death to see thestrals.”
It was hardly a second later when Luna came around the corner. She stood at his shoulder and they both looked down the corridor after Finnigan. She waited several minutes before saying anything.
They were silent until they were right in front of the doors to the Great Hall. Draco let go of Blaise’s arm. “I’m not going to let this go. I’ve got to do something this time.”
He was more tentative and gentle than Pansy, but Draco thought he might get used to it. Especially when he saw the suspicious shine in Blaise’s own eyes.
Luna’s question had brought them almost halfway up the stairs. Luna pressed closer to him, in a sort of side-hug. “Thank you for worrying about me, Draco.”
Draco had half hoped that the hookups would distract him from Potter, or maybe put him off Potter altogether. The only thing it had done on that front, however, was make Draco’s dreams of Potter more explicit. It was mortifying.
Even Blaise had grinned at him and Draco had ended up caving. He was actively fighting against Potter landing in detention again, doing this. He wasn’t sure his heart could handle a failure.
Blaise slid his arm to Draco’s other shoulder and pulled Draco’s head down onto Blaise’s chest. “It’s not your fault Umbridge found out what Potter was doing. You did everything you could. More than anyone could have expected.”
Dumbledore’s final words rang in an echoing clang around Draco’s head even as Potter turned away. “Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
Finally a reaction. Potter grabbed the twin the Chasers hadn’t reached as he lunged for Draco. Draco couldn’t help breaking out in loud, jarring laughter at the sight. He threw up his arms dramatically as he backed away, half sure the twins would throw off their handlers and not caring what they’d do to him as long as his last ditch effort got Potter too.
Pansy kept him great company, joining him in scowling at the new Gryffindor prefects and not saying a word when Draco followed them past his own reserved compartment to see where the last third of the golden trio was sitting.
He didn’t say anything to the why. Potter stared at him some more, before letting Malfoy take his hand again and start dabbing. Potter hissed at first but after a second it seemed to help. Draco wiped up the blood and then wrapped the handkerchief around Potter’s hand as best he could before letting it go.
Warrington grunted, when Draco looked over at him with a raised eyebrow he spoke up. “Found out they got another Weasley on the Gryffindor team. Potter’s sidekick.”
Pansy had practically sat on him to scare some of the other Slytherin girls away from him. The two times Draco saw Potter during the day he’d glared and turned away.
Davies’s eyebrows furrowed. “That’s right. Far more than I want to know to be honest. He never shuts up at home.”
Draco and Pansy shared a look. Then mutually took one of Blaise’s hands each. They could tell this story wouldn’t end well. It was widely known that Mrs. Zabini had just married her sixth husband.
Draco was unsettled to feel tears gathering in his eyes under his mother’s look and his voice almost didn’t make its way up his suddenly tight throat; he quietly choked out,  “I understand.”
The other part of his brain was trying to process the nature of the invitation. Just what was Potter trying to do? A defence club. That was bound to get shut down by Umbridge before it did any good. Draco wrote out,
Draco had made the mistake of mentioning this to Blaise, and had been dealing with Blaise’s moodiness ever since. With Pansy and Milli gone, this meant Draco was dealing with it on his own. How Blaise could think that Draco would rather deal with a homophobic prick with a direct line to his father over him, Draco could not fathom.
He could see why his father might get on with her. She thought she could do what his father had been trying to do for years now and get one over on Dumbledore. Frankly he’d like to see her try. He couldn’t see how the Ministry could think this would work.
Draco gave her a dirty look. “Alright, I agree to your terms. As long as Milli agrees to help, it shouldn’t be a problem. But you’ll not tell Milli where you got the glamour. I don’t need the whole damn house knowing I use it.”
Draco took the time to be glad that Pansy was okay, even as his hands started shaking in earnest and his eyes seemed to tunnel into the word ‘expelled’.
Draco let his hand drift up to the bruise decorating the underside of the left side of his jaw. “Bruises take time to heal properly.”
He had to face some hard truths in his third year. He knew it was more than the thrill of the rivalry that sent shivers up and down his spine when he managed to get Potter’s full attention. The satisfaction that filled his whole body after making Potter help with his potions ingredients that year was borderline unhealthy.
He was speed walking with such a single-minded focus that he collided with what felt like someone’s back head on. Draco managed to keep his feet, but his inadvertent victim let out a shocked screech and tumbled face-down onto the floor.
It wasn’t as if Draco cared one bit about Cedric Diggory. He barely knew the prat. In fact, if he hadn’t been made a champion that year he would have been a barely recognized face from Quidditch. Just another player that wasn’t as good as Potter.
Zabini saw his look and smirked. “It’s eleven in the morning, you can’t blame me. I am, however, very much interested in hearing more. I find it curious that you wouldn’t like Umbridge, Malfoy. I was under the impression your father may have helped put her here.”
His father was rarely even home. When he did see him his father seemed to stand taller than he ever had before. Pride in himself seemed to radiate outward from his body.
Draco fell back on his pillows to think about the rest of it. He knew Luna wouldn’t mind the delay. He couldn’t actually go. That wouldn’t go over well. The glare on Potter’s face last time Draco wanted to help proved that. But a secret from Umbridge would be just the sort of thing that would help Draco feel better about being unable to stop her from torturing Potter. He sat up and wrote back.
Luna turned toward the door knocker now and gave it a rap. Draco raised an eyebrow when it spoke. “How many paths must a person walk?”
Severus put a heavy hand on Draco’s shoulder and Draco partially turned to look at him. “It’s a time of great change and upheaval, Draco. Time to make a lot of hard choices. I just want you to be ready to handle those choices.”
The girl’s smile didn’t dim. She just held out her hand. “I’m Luna Lovegood. I’m a third year Ravenclaw.”
For a second Draco wondered if now would be the time Vincent fought back, but he only gave a sharp nod and lumbered out past Draco to go find the other compartment. Draco motioned Pansy to take the window seat and Draco laid down with his head in Pansy’s lap.
It wasn’t until he was drifting off that the obvious came to him. It had to have been someone who told Umbridge. Someone not on the parchment.
Pomfrey nodded with a look of satisfaction. “Good. As expected. Well, I’ll come check on you in a couple hours, you should lay down and rest. No reading until tomorrow.”
Nott didn’t seem bothered in the slightest. He just grinned even wider. “So you know that Zabini was caught snogging a bloke over the summer? Didn’t know you were looking to be friends with poofs.”
Draco smirked. “You’d do well to stay on my good side, Finnigan. You do know who my father is, don’t you?”
Draco couldn’t seem to stop while he was ahead. “What’s it matter to you what happens to me, hmm? It’s none of your business, you made that
Both Draco and Pansy flinched hard and turned to look at the source so fast it was a surprise they didn’t pull something. Zabini was sitting in his bed, dressed, with several books around him and a roll of parchment in front of him. His curtains were partially pulled around his bed, so that they looked closed from the side by the door, but were open on the side by the window, presumably so he could look out into the lake.
Blaise winked. “Why, exactly what you did. Get myself a girlfriend. Bit easier for me though, seeing as I’m bi.”
Draco spent his spare time smarming up to Umbridge, hoping to be around if Edgecombe gave in to the temptation. It was horribly taxing. Everytime he complimented her Ministry reforms he felt the urge to vomit. All he wanted to do was sit her down and make her use her stupid Black Quill on herself.
Draco and Finnigan glared at each other for what felt like ages, waiting for the other to make a move. Finally Finnigan practically growled before turning and stomping away toward the Gryffindor common room.
It was an exciting prospect to have the ear of the older years, he hadn’t quite managed it before. He was too young as a first and second year to be taken seriously, and Flint, though stupid, held sway better as Quidditch captain in Draco’s third and fourth year than Draco had quite managed to, though he thought he’d been making some progress.
Draco grimaced and tapped the side of her shoe with his foot at her lack of appreciation for his idea. “I can’t very well follow her around. For one thing, it’s creepy when a man follows a girl around, and for another, I’ve still got Potter following
Then he marched over to the large wingback chair in front of the fireplace, a previously snogging fourth year couple falling over each other to get out of it, and flung himself down in it. Clearly he’d been slacking in his duties. He hasn’t held court in the common room since before the third task last term. Well, if Potter didn’t want his help, didn’t want his advice, then Malfoy would just have to
Breakfast the next morning an owl with a note and a package managed to pierce through Draco’s angry fog. Draco was surprised but pleased to see that it was from Luna.
Pansy rolled her eyes and pushed Blaise off her shoulder so she could walk over to Draco’s bed and sit down. “It’s only fair, Draco. We know his secrets. It seems like we’ll be putting up with him for awhile now anyway and he already half figured it out.” Pansy turned to address Blaise now. “That being said, if you say anything they’ll never find your body.”
“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?” Draco made sure he was looking straight at Potter. Goading him to look back. Daring him to retort.
3. Draco has a panic attack this chapter. I based it on my own panic attacks, but mine are a bit muddled with some fun ptsd, and everyone has them a bit differently. I don't mean anything offensive.
Vincent made a low noise in his throat and Draco swallowed. From now on he’d have to be more careful.
“There’s a rumor going around, you see, Edgecombe. One of particular interest to us.” When Draco said the word ‘us’ he heard his Slytherin companions emerge from their hiding places along the hall behind him. After much consideration, he’d decided it was safe enough to invite the whole group of Pansy, Blaise, Milli, Vincent, and Greg, as long as he was careful what he gave away. They all stayed near the walls, leaning unconcernedly.
When he entered the Three Broomsticks that Saturday his hands had already been trembling for an hour. Pansy somehow noticed, despite his best efforts, grabbing his hand and hanging on. Blaise shot him a smile and a wink while they looked for a table.
Draco couldn’t help turning to hide his face in Blaise’s shirt. He could already feel tears gathering. His voice was thick. “It had to be Edgecombe. She must have panicked and told while I was stuck tutoring Greg! Maybe if I hadn’t frightened her none of this-”
Both of his friends wore matching frowns. Pansy uncrossed her arms. “What does that matter to you? Surely the Bitch wouldn’t presume to go through
Sure enough, Umbridge’s new appointment was in the Daily Prophet the next morning. He shared a grim look with Zabini and Pansy who sat across from him.
Pansy told him she’d even overheard Weasley and Granger talking together at a prefects’ meeting about how Potter had begun insisting that Draco was Up To Something -- to the exclusion of almost all else. Draco was oddly flattered.
He never saw Potter leave. Draco wondered if he really was invisible. He wouldn’t put it past him. He told himself he wasn’t disappointed.
When Draco looked at the seat across from him he found Zabini raising an eyebrow at him, Draco only shrugged one shoulder at him in response. It wasn’t Draco’s fault the obvious solution to worrying about a Gryffindor prefect attack was to have a prefect in each compartment. If Vincent had a problem with Draco’s ‘solution’ he would have said something.
He had never been so bored during the summer following their meeting either. Nothing could seem to interest him the way Potter could.
Draco met Umbridge’s eyes. “Yes. You mustn’t take sides in Quidditch. But I’m happy to see the sides you’ve taken in other matters.”
He’d gotten her door half open and a foot out when she spoke up after him. “I expect to see you after dinner tomorrow.”
He ran his eyes from one side of his little group to the other. When he landed on Davies he got an idea. “Davies! You have a brother in Ravenclaw, right?”
Blaise and Pansy even knew they had a built-in scapegoat in Edgecombe for when Umbridge made her counterattack.
When he looked back up he saw Pansy with a crease on her forehead and a piece of toast hanging out of her mouth.
Blaise’s breath hitched audibly, his hand tightening its grip on Draco’s shoulder, and Pansy let go of Draco entirely to lean back against the couch in horror. Pansy’s voice was muffled, her hands over her face. “So that’s why you hate Umbridge so much! You’re such a prat Draco! You should have told us!”
And he was worried. He couldn’t help it as it came over him looking at Potter’s friends. This was who he had on his side? These were the people helping him? If Potter had taken his hand he could have had Draco! Draco would have given anything!
Almost all the fifth year prefects had tried to get a post on the seventh floor that night, probably to cover their own absences. Draco had put his name in for the corridor by the Gryffindor portrait again. So no one would expect him to have wandered over to this side of the floor.
Potter was paying far more attention to Weasley than to Draco, but Draco could hardly bring himself to care for once, the anticipation thrumming through his veins. When he thought he’d make himself sick from excitement he grabbed Vince and Greg and practically ran down to the pitch to get ready. Normally he’d be a bit worried about their first real game, but with Draco’s plan in place it was practically a moot point. Draco hummed his song all the way down and through getting ready.
Draco felt too tired to bother with maturity. He stuck his tongue out at Pansy and kicked at her shoe. “I am not
It took a minute for the potion to take effect, but when it did Draco felt every muscle in his body untense. Once he could breathe again, he looked around the room. Uncle Severus's office. Pansy knelt next to him, with a hand on his back, Blaise stood across the room looking at him. Both appeared pale and worried. Draco couldn’t maintain eye contact, so he looked at Uncle Severus instead.
Draco hissed into Crabbe’s face. “Don’t you think, Crabbe, that if I had wanted Umbridge to know, I would have told her myself?”
Draco allowed himself to smile a bit back. “Which area do you want tonight anyway? The seventh floor or around Umbridge’s office?”
It took a second for Finnigan to stop glaring and process what Draco had said. Draco could tell exactly when Finnigan had caught his meaning. Finnigan’s eyes widened and his face paled dramatically. Draco wanted to laugh.
Draco’s head was spinning. He knew exactly what would cause a wound like this. “She’s torturing you with a Black Quill.”
Draco tapped the door frame twice in agitated indecision before giving it up and walking in. If Finnigan was heading back to his common room, Draco wouldn’t see anything useful, and if he swanned off now he’d miss Luna entirely.
Johnson had a hand on Potter’s shoulder. He could just hear her words. “He whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you’d got the Snitch -- but we won, Harry, we won!”
Draco often joked that she really wanted to take after Mrs. Zabini and marry wealthy wizards for their money, only to kill them off for her freedom. Pansy just laughed.
Thank you ever so much for your letter! I don’t mind speaking like this, but it’s a little slow and I thought maybe getting strange letters regularly might be a bit suspicious. So I’ve charmed a couple of notebooks so we can talk to each other instantly through them! I wouldn’t want our letters to be stolen by an Umgubular Slashkilter! (The Ministry is rumored to have several) But I only write my friends you see.
Pansy raised an eyebrow at Draco. He didn’t take it to heart. He didn’t quite know what he was doing either. If he was lucky it would be making a new ally. He was already in trouble with Zabini, he may as well see where things went.
Blaise raised his hands in front of himself as if to ward her off. “I won’t. Who the hell would believe me anyway?”
I'm glad I got this done before I left for my girlfriend's for the long weekend! Be a little bit til the next chapter, but this outline I did is really helping! Once again let me know what you think!
Blaise dropped his hands. “What do you get out of your little arrangement anyway Pansy? I can see what he gets, but you’re not like us, are you?”
He heard Greg and Vincent both scramble up to follow him and had to suppress an annoyed sigh. He couldn’t wait to get home if only so he could have some space to think.
Draco tried to play it up as much as he could. Delighting his audience with a rendition of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ and flashing his badge, or pretending to be hit off an invisible broom. Meanwhile his stomach roiled with guilt and anger and worry. Occasionally the thought that he would never play against Potter again, or that Potter would never play
I regret to inform you that due to the current political climate it is unsafe to converse with you in person. However, I find that I still wish to speak with you, and so do formally invite you into a correspondence. About which topic we’ve previously spoken, I find that I still cannot see the thestrals. Have you found out whether Chang or the Diggorys can?
Draco saw Potter and a bunch of other Gryffindors poring over the same decree on his way out of the hall. Potter had looked up almost as soon as Draco had spotted him, a glare already on his face. But Potter had only looked at Draco for a second before the glare had melted into surprise. Draco had had to look away, not having the fortitude to deal with Potter. Draco thought he must look truly pathetic to cause such a reaction.
When they got to the door Luna let go of Draco’s arm, and instead of grabbing the handle, turned to look at him. Draco met her eyes for a second before glancing away. Luna had a look like she could see your soul. “It’s okay for you to have feelings for him. It doesn’t make you a bad person. Love can only be a good thing you know.”
Draco rubbed at his temple remembering his fateful encounter with Potter almost a month ago. He really wasn’t sure why he hadn’t told Pansy and Blaise about Potter. It was just… He’d never seen Potter so vulnerable.
Draco let out a fond sigh of exasperation and smiled down at his notebook, safe as he was from prying eyes, ensconced in his bed curtains.
Draco was so distracted by Pansy that he didn’t see Blaise coming when he punched him in the upper arm. “Hey! What exactly was that for?”
Luna broke through Draco’s contemplation. “Cho Chang has been quite emotional this year, understandably. I don’t think it’s the first time she’s gotten frustrated at the knocker and started crying. I should really go help her in, I’ve been worried that she might turn into a squonk. If she does I’d quite like to see it. Although I suppose it’d be better manners to prevent her from succumbing to it.”
People arrived quickly. Draco wasn’t surprised when he saw what seemed to be all of the fifth year Gryffindors. Longbottom and Thomas came in, practically dragging between them a protesting sandy haired boy that Draco vaguely recalled was named Finnigan. His exploding cauldrons were quite well-known. Once Finnigan got through the door, though, he pulled away to sit down on the other side of the pub from Draco. Thomas and Longbottom looked upset but didn’t push him.
Draco frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco swallowed. “Things are looking up for my family aren’t they?”
Draco’s voice was raw and hoarse. “I didn’t want to believe it was one of you. I wanted to trust you. I care about you. But that’s not how Slytherins work. Father told me that all friendship is based on mutually assured destruction. To never trust anyone with something unless their betrayal would hurt them too. I know… I know something about Pansy that made me doubt it was her because I don’t think she’s told anyone else. On top of that she wouldn’t want to do anything to jeopardize our deal around marriage. But Blaise. I feel like I don’t know a single personal thing about you, Blaise. Now that your affair in public knowledge I’ve got nothing. I still wanted to believe you hadn’t done it, but I had no basis. Slytherins make the best spies. Everyone knows that.”
Draco would have liked to check that curse himself, but he knew in his heart that Granger was more than capable. “So no one was missing or had any sign of this curse?”
Milli leaned around Pansy to answer before she could. “She’s dead boring. She follows every single rule, hangs out with the same goody-good type girls, has no apparent romantic interest in anyone, and writes to her parents every other day. She’s even middling in every subject! She’s the most boring person I’ve ever seen!”
Draco couldn’t look her in the eyes anymore. No one had ever talked to him like that. Had ever said that he was fine the way he was. Everyone always wanted him to be better: better at studies, better at Occlumency, better at Quidditch, a better heir. He wasn’t sure he remembered a time where he could let himself relax and be who he was.
When his eyes finally fluttered open with a groan, it was to be met with the familiar sight of the hospital wing ceiling.
Draco leaned forward. Potter’s eyes got wider the closer he got. Draco felt the sudden tension when he leaned into his ear and hissed. “If I were up to something, Potter, you’d be the first to know.”
Draco sat up straighter on the bench and looked down his nose at Pansy. “It was. She sent along a book I’d forgotten.”
Pansy raised both of hers in response. “What? We’ve only been talking to you the past couple minutes.” Pansy got a sly look on her face that made Draco want to take a step backwards. “Were you daydreaming about Potter again?” She put her hands together under her chin and made a kissy face. “Imagining if you were fooling around with
His eyes were quick to slide around to the Gryffindor table and a certain brunet in particular. He was surprised to find green eyes already trained on him. Potter looked awful. His face seemed to be running the gamut of stormy emotions. Draco couldn’t help grimacing at the pain he could see there. Potter’s eyes widened in surprise.
Draco didn’t have any inspected classes that day, but Potter obviously had. News had reached him of Potter’s new week of detentions by dinner time.
Draco managed to close his mouth. He felt his expression softening against his will. “I’d be honored to have you as a cousin, however unsubstantiated. What was your mother’s first name, if you don’t mind me asking?”
He was stopped on his way to the carriages by none other than Professor Snape himself, obviously returned. He grabbed Draco’s elbow just as he was about to exit the main door in the Entrance Hall. Draco nodded at Vincent and Greg to go on and followed Severus off to the side willingly. They both stood not looking at each other, but over at the students.
Draco scowled. “He found me at the start of my patrol last night. I was hiding next to Potter’s meeting place in an alcove behind a tapestry. If he didn’t follow me, I have no idea how he would have found me.” Draco fought down a blush, remembering how close they’d been in that little alcove, how close Draco had dared to step with his self preservation drowned out by his feelings for Potter. “He outright
Draco decided to divulge his plan of attack at breakfast the next morning. Although tired, Draco was filled with a manic energy to get this done, which he could tell Pansy did not share. She had stationed herself around Ravenclaw Tower last night, to dissuade people from hanging around when Draco brought Luna back, now she chugged coffee.
He was holding himself tightly and walking fast. Draco followed him at a distance. He’d never seen Potter look quite like that and he…. well, frankly, he wanted to see if Potter was okay.
Instead he was forced to work on his studies for next year for several hours a day. as if the goal was for him to not need to go back next year. As much as he hated being cooped up inside, it gave him ample time to practice his Occlumency.
Blaise laughed and Draco winced as they watched her knock another mug of coffee back. Blaise gulped his own pumpkin juice, setting it down with a dramatic thump. “I am more and more thankful every day that I wasn’t made a prefect. I need my beauty sleep.”
He paced up and down the corridor outside for ages, wishing that he could hear what Potter and the others were doing. His only interruption came from Mrs. Norris, who scampered off when Draco showed her his prefect badge and told her he was on patrol. There was something weird about that cat, but Draco knew enough about magic to know better than to look into it.
Draco glared down at the table, having lost the fight as he blushed up his neck. “He said,‘Until I figure out what you’re up to, I’m not taking my eyes off you.’”
The Ministry employed more people than any other single establishment. Getting the children of these employees on one side was no small victory. Potter would find himself outnumbered, no matter how unpopular Umbridge seemed right then.
The group started talking about other things and Draco lost track. At some point Pansy slid all the way into his lap. Draco held back a wince and shuffled around uncomfortably.
specifically asked me to watch out for you. Because you’re such a gormless moron that you don’t even realize how little you know.”
Draco smiled inwardly, but only showed them a less-fond looking smirk. “If you two are done? Mother said that Umbridge is watching the castle‘s communications. And something about Christmas I don’t fully understand.”
It didn’t help her case that she was both not conventionally attractive and soft-spoken. Once she and Pansy had started getting on in second year, though, Pansy was quick to tell everyone she could find that Milli -- as she told everyone to call her, Draco still forgot sometimes -- was excellent in a muggle fight and quite good at transfiguration. From there she had integrated quite well. Always a good one to have on your side, Pansy.
The thought brought Draco up short for a second before he ran a rough, agitated hand through his tangled hair.
“Well, what even kind of question is that?” Draco went on indignantly. “It depends how old someone lives to be. They could walk hundreds of paths. Or the opposite, what if someone has no legs or something? Then they aren’t walking any paths at all!”
Draco’s stomach fell through his shoes, and he would have stopped walking if Blaise wasn’t pulling him along.
Greg and Vincent took his reticence to mean they shouldn’t say anything either and Draco clapped them on their shoulders and nodded approval at them on their way up to the castle. They seemed pleased.
Blaise laughed a dry laugh. “I suppose. I barely know her anymore. She’s not the same person she was when I was younger. She doesn’t see me anymore, not really. And she’s not happy. She lives only for the game now.” Blaise’s voice was hushed with his next admission. “I’m afraid I’ll end up like her. I know my reputation and how I look.”
Milli raised an eyebrow, still leaning against a wall. “Does this mean we have to keep watching her? As much as I enjoyed following the wimp, I don’t fancy continuing.”
The girl put her hand up to her mouth and picked at her lip as she thought for a minute. When she spoke it was slow. “I think… It would depend on how close one was with the victim. Harry Potter will be able to see them once he’s processed because he saw the murder, but I think Cho Chang and Mr and Mrs Diggory should see them too now, if they couldn’t before, just from the body.”
Draco pushed down his irritation and graced Pansy with a small smile. “That’s alright, dear. Do you have anything to tell me about the Edgecombe situation?”
Draco frowned. That meant the girl saw her mother die. He couldn’t imagine that and steeled himself against trying to. “No, I can’t.” Draco paused for a second in contemplation. “It’s weird though. That I can’t. Shouldn’t everyone who watched the third task be able to see them because of Diggory?”
Draco saw he’d been right to panic when Pansy slammed a notice down on the table in front of him as soon as he sat down at breakfast. She didn’t say anything, only giving him a grim look.
If it was Blaise or Pansy and they had told Umbridge all they knew, they might end up taking a hit for becoming so involved and not telling someone sooner. Just saying they had heard a rumor that Potter was gathering people would be enough to earn them plenty of accolades from Umbridge. She hadn’t gotten to Potter since his last detention.
because Luna is fine and she told you. Every single one of those members could have told a friend and any of those friends could have told Umbridge. It even makes more sense that it was someone who knew less because Umbridge made a blanket ban on clubs instead of coming for Potter directly. She doesn’t even seem to know where the meetings take place or she would have been up there already.”
Draco hissed when he saw what the injury was. He read it aloud without thinking in a whisper. “I must not tell lies.”
every week than admit to an adult that you need help?! Even if it could mean helping with the war?!” Draco stood up. “I didn’t know you’d rather drown in your own pride than
Davies sat up straighter, her previous smile falling fast. “Yes. But that doesn’t mean I’m any less-”
Draco sat up straighter in his seat, glad to finally get to his new mission. “Edgecombe is still a threat. I want to put a tail on her for a few days to get a look at her state of mind. Once I’ve sussed her out, I plan to confront her. Scare her out of Potter’s group entirely, preferably, but at the very least, I want to scare her away from telling Umbridge anything.”
He used his Occlumency skills to pull himself back together and put his trusty mask back on. Severus nodded once decisively and dropped his hand. “I might see you over the summer, but even if I don’t, keep practising. No other skill will serve you as well as that one. Go along now.”
Draco threw his arm out to keep Pansy from finishing her scathing reply and took in Zabini’s features. They seemed too carefully constructed for someone with the upper hand.
There was a wash of cold magic over his and his mother’s hands. Draco’s eyes widened at the feeling. A spontaneous magical contract.
Draco scowled down at the page, still sore over all the stress Potter was putting him through, and without even knowing it too. He’d taken the last two nights off prefect duty to catch up on sleep and homework, so he supposed it wasn’t the worst timing. He could have used another day though.
So Draco watched and bided his time. He could see Potter getting more and more angry at the world and Umbridge and her poor teaching and lies. It wasn’t the good look Draco thought it might be. It made him unreasonably worried.
Draco tried to come up with a plan to help Potter, make up for this heinous mistake, but nothing he could think of sounded even close to feasible. He felt like he was slowly going crazy, invisible to the crowd around him.
Draco groaned, reopening his eyes. “I can’t be here right now. Let’s go back to the common room to talk. I can’t even think of eating anymore and no one should be there.”
Draco would rather swallow his own tongue. Pansy was always the more brash of them anyways. It was her that ended up asking. “What’s the truth about your mother, Blaise?”
I want to shout out to the Harry Potter Lexicon. I would not be able to do this without their day by day calendars. It really helps me to know the exact date of all the events.
But still Draco wondered, pacing the dusty classroom. Finnigan had been dragged to the Three Broomsticks by his dormmates, so he might know about Potter’s club. Draco might think that Finnigan and Potter didn’t get along, but they’d always been friendly before.
Going into third year, Draco had hoped that he would be able to take at least one class without Granger in it so that he could be top of that class, only to have his hopes dashed and a punch in the face as a cherry on top. Even if he and Granger got exactly the same grade, the teachers always put Granger first because of his father’s animosity toward the headmaster. Uncle Severus was the only one to do otherwise, so he had managed to take the top slot in potions on occasion, but keeping that spot for any amount of time was incredibly difficult, yet his father wasn’t impressed.
He looked up at Uncle Severus just in time to catch him rolling his eyes.“Very well. You both can stay with him through first period, and then escort him to the dormitory. I expect to see you in Potions after the break, however.” Pansy and Blaise agreed quickly. Uncle Severus seemed to smile despite himself. “Be thankful for your friends Draco. I’m not sure how you would have managed this… incident, without them.”
All that Sunday Draco was surrounded. All the Slytherins wanted to bask in his ‘success’. Crawling all over themselves to get close to him. Whisper what other things they could do to Potter and the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Draco grimaced and shushed Greg, his eyes darting around the Entrance Hall. They were far enough away from the doors to the Great Hall that none of the passing students seemed to have heard Greg. Draco hissed out between his teeth. “Not here, doofus.”
She smiled a little at the sight. “You’re growing up darling. I thought Lucius was done with it after the first war, once we had you to raise. But he’s gone back.” His mother’s smile dropped. “He’s gone back. He had little choice this time. He made his bed the last time. Honestly I don’t think he would choose differently even if he could.”
Both of the Creevey brothers slunk in next. Draco stopped mid-drink to watch them. The older Creevey may have spent a lot of time watching Potter, but he was rarely sneaky. He stared, until, with a loud clunk as he slammed his drink down, it came to him. Creevey the younger was too young to be in Hogsmeade. He had to be only a second year at best. Draco didn’t want to know how he’d even made it into town.
Goyle stuck his head around Crabbe’s shoulder, his face pale and drawn. Draco aimed his icy glare towards him as well. “I am going to
Draco leaned forward. “Just from the sheer emotional impact? That’s a brilliant theory. It could tell us quite a lot about thestrals if someone studied that. Very little has been written about them because they’re considered such bad luck.”
