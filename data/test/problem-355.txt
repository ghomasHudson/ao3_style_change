Harry, meanwhile, leant forwards, pressing their lips together. Getting over the initial shock, Draco felt himself start to respond, pushing into the kiss. Leaning even closer when he felt the warmth from Harry’s arm on his good shoulder. Causing Potter’s lips to move into a smile as he started to pull away. Catching himself as he leant forwards, Draco froze, attempting to sit up, however, Potter's arm on his shoulders held him still as their foreheads pressed together, Harry watching him with an almost smirk.
“Huh, presents,” Harry muttered under his breath as he scrunched his eyebrows. He had been so busy thinking about decorations and food and invites he forgot he had to buy people presents. It was such a big part of Christmas. How had that slipped his mind?.
The leaves behind them rustled seconds before the confident smirk on Draco’s lips disappeared. He jumped forwards crashing into Harry. Harry instantly caught him holding him upright, while Draco snapped around looking behind him. “Something just hit me.”
“So how do we know what they do?” Draco asked, stepping closer to Harry again with a smirk on his lips.
Hermione and Ron both looked at her with the same expression, then glanced at each other. “He won’t.” They said in unison, oddly confident.
“That’s debatable,” Malfoy said without missing a beat, a half-smile on his face before he returned his attention to the paper. “What am I writing?”
“If I knew one, we’d already be free!” Draco snapped. Harry merely closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. Draco wasn’t going to stand by and get ignored like this.
Harry kept his eyes upwards and pointed. Above them in the middle of the doorway was a single piece of Mistletoe. The leaves were bright green and berries whiter than they should be. It was placed exactly between the two rooms, where the pair was currently stuck.
Later, when Draco showed Harry out, he didn’t need to turn around to sense Pansy. “Not a word from you.”
“When do you use someone’s last name and when do you use their first name?” The little boy asked, holding onto Malfoy’s trouser leg with some colourfully sticky fingers. Malfoy not batting an eyelid.
Harry sat forwards studying him. While Draco tried to ignore him. The realisation slowly covered Harry’s face, filling Draco with terror. “You never planned on taking my money, did you?”
Both parties never mentioned the previous night, pretending to forget about it completely. A fact they secretly felt relieved and disappointed by. While neither would ever admit to it, they both held treasured memories from that morning of cuddling. Harry remembering the content feeling from the warm weight against his side, the sweet whisper of air across his chest. While Draco cherished the feeling of safety created by the comforting heartbeat & warm chest.
Harry tried to not smirk at Malfoy’s overreactions, finding the entire situation a lot more entertaining than he had expected. “Sure, I mean I’m not going to turn people away.”
“Well, in business and formal situations you would use their last name, then when you are in an informal and friendly situation you use their first name.” Malfoy seemed unfazed by the random question.
Teddy looked thoughtful for a while, “My daddy fucks mafoot.” He said before disappearing into the dining room.
Pansy meanwhile picked up the paper, her eyes going wide with excitement as Draco could feel his heart drop. Having forgotten about it.
Harry noticed the way Draco hadn’t reacted to his slip up and use of the word ‘we’. It made him wonder if Draco would still be around next year. With the boys being close friends, he imagined they would be. However, Draco would probably be working on his next job.
“I feel like this is going to be the start of an idiotic friendship.” Harry declared, excitement filling him at the very idea. He had been certain Maflo- Draco would have shot him down and ignored him.
Malfoy paused, thrown for a minute, “Ah, it’s just what we called each other in school.” He shrugged.
“Well sorry, for thinking you might like my number,” Harry said childishly, feeling worse when Malfoy chuckled in response.
Earning a stifled laugh from Draco who pulled back looking Harry in the eyes a small smile, “How very savour of you.” The twinkle in his eyes proved he knew how much Harry hated it and was baiting him. However, Harry could still see the glassy gaze from where Draco had frozen early. His chest hurting at the idea he had upset Draco. Harry let it slide. Watching as Draco stepped back correcting his suit as he moved around the office changing things.
“If you really don’t want to be here, why even come?” Harry stated, having recovered from his laughing fit.
That night after the Malfoys had gone home, Harry pulled out his phone and hit call without having to glance at the screen. Having collapsed on the bed, he was tired.
Turning away, Harry finally spoke. “I know how hard it can be to try and break free from an overbearing family when you are young and defenceless.”
Harry bit back a smile, “I’ll have you know that stamp is all of 0.2oz in weight,” Harry protested, trying not to laugh, daring Draco to reply. The pair smiled at each other, amusement dancing around them.
“They all have decorations in the doorways, but it wouldn’t be a Weasley prank if they all did the same thing,” Harry said, only just realising how unsafe the house was, especially if the pranks had already arrived this far from Christmas.
“Bye Harry!” Was all he heard as the pair raced out of the room to show their mum  “The amazing stuff we made today!” He had to chuckle.
"Haven't you read the Daily Prophet or Witch Weekly?" Harry asked, his heart thumping against his chest and suddenly feeling rather queasy. "No, I cancelled my subscriptions after... well," Molly said sadly. "Oh, er-well, you see- it is true," Harry gulped. "Oh, okay then!" Molly smiled. "You're- you're okay with it?" Harry choked, completely relieved. "Oh of course I am! This does not change you as the sweet, brave boy I've come to love as my own son!" Molly said and Harry jumped in with a big hug. "Thank you." He whispered.
"That's right Harry, I am your girlfriend!" She smiled anxiously, and gave him a quick peck on the lips. Entertained students retreated back into their dorms, laughing at Harry's drunkenness and gossiping in awe about his not-so-secret musical talent.
Ron had done some serious thinking after he came home from Hogwarts. He had just left his best friend and girlfriend at school after learning one simple secret. Sometimes he kicked himself for doing something so stupid, but then the memory of why he did it came back and he just didn't care.
"I knew that you would break up with me sometime soon, but I didn't know it would be for Ginny! I'm devastated, of course I am, but I just want you to be happy and if that's with Ginny then I support you. Just be careful though, you know what the laws are." Neville said.
Harry looked at her in shock. "What, no, that's ridiculous! I like girls, you know, uh, long hair... eyelashes..." He panicked. "Okay then," She smirked. "Describe to me your ideal girl. What does she look like?" Harry thought for a moment then replied.
"Hello Myrtle," Draco sighed. "Is he trying to cause trouble again Dwaco? I can protect you!" She giggled. "No, Myrtle I'm fine, Harry is fine," Draco said plainly as he watched Harry lean against the wall, head back. "It seems like just yesterday that he made you bleed out on that floor." Myrtle sighed, getting closer to Draco. A strike of guilt crossed Harry. This was the bathroom where Harry almost killed Draco. Now the same boy is trying to stop him from dying out. You don't deserve his help. Just leave him be, he doesn't want to be troubled with you. Nobody Does.
Harry jumped back from Ron, remembering the first time Harry had showed signs of magic and his uncle had found out. They tried to beat him into being normal. Harry started to panic, unable to control his breathing. He was back in Privet Drive and he could hear Vernon's loud stomps coming angrily down the stairs above the cupboard where Harry slept.
It could even get to the point where they end up murdering someone, so basically, your stuck with me forever!" Draco grinned. "I am definitely not complaining" Harry whispered as they got up and made their way to the castle grounds.
"Is it true, that you! Mr Malfoy, have a secret sketch book where you draw your most innermost inny desires?" Harry giggled. "What? How did you know about that?" Draco gasped. "The only person I've ever told is Blai- oh. Curse that stupid Italian!"
Hermione and Ron never came back, so when the Hogwarts Express pulled up to Hogsmeade station, Harry collected his things and walked off on his own. He got in a carriage with a couple of 3rd years, who seemed to try and sit as far away from him as possible. Everyone filed into the Great Hall, sitting at their houses tables.
"Goodbye, Draco." Harry's final words crashed through him like a million shards of ice and before he could even process the thought, the boy he loved was gone. Gone. He couldn't just be gone, there was so much left to do, so much left to say! Harry needed to know the truth and Draco knew just how to do that.
"And what was interesting was that Harry has the dark heart whilst you have the light heart! The black represents a darkness within you, any kind of form whether it's evil or otherwise. I thought Draco would have had that considering his family and background but I guess it sort of makes sense that Harry has it after all we've discovered this year. And it's only November!" Hermione nodded and Draco looked like he too had discovered something that all made sense now but Harry still had no clue what was going on. "I'm sorry, what's the encanta bond and why do I have a fucking tattoo?" He snarled, agitated at the fact that he still didn't understand and nobody was helping.
"Yeah mate, you've been like a doll since I got back." Ron nodded. "How are you feeling?" She whispered worriedly and biting her lip. "You're adorable when you do that you know," said Ron randomly, grinning like a chimpanzee.
The next morning, five eighth years nursed hangovers and felt 'actual, emotional pain' at the thought they had to go to classes later. Harry and Draco headed down to the great hall together in silence, neither one of them fully aware of their surroundings.
Harry paused for a moment, still strumming but in thought. "I suppose now the lyrics have changed. Let me just alter them slightly." He smiled, looking at Draco. Draco blushed, but never looked away still in awe of this boy who was so freaking talented, he just couldn't believe it.
The six Gryffindors and one Slytherin sat down on the floor, taking advantage of an empty common room. "I'll go first, I'm the bestest!" Harry slurred and grabbed the bottle. He spun it, but then cast a silent spell with his wand up his sleeve so it would land on who he wanted.
"My whole life, I have been abused by the Dursley's. Verbal and Physical," Harry paused as Hermione gasped and tears filled his eyes, which he tried to blink away. "When I got back, I tried to use magic when they weren't looking to do my chores quicker, but I was caught and there was punishment. Vernon stopped my food supply for a month, and after that, I just pretty much stopped eating all over."
"Harry, Harry wait!" Draco yelled as he ran. "I have veritaserum, I can prove the truth to you!" He caught up to the trio and blocked their path. "You'd be willing to do that for me?" Harry gasped softly. Veritaserum was nasty stuff and did not feel good at all.
"I tell you, the last time I prop'ly saw you Harry, you was acting dead. Almost gave me a heart attack when you fell on the floor. You could jolly well be one of em muggle ac'or things on the feletision," Hagrid chuckled. "Sorry Hagrid, I didn't mean to scare you." Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. "Na, its al'ight. You did what you 'ad to do. An' congrats you two on the relationship. I always saw how you looked at her differently Ron," Hagrid smirked, playfully elbowing Ron's arm, but nearly knocking him sideways.
Harry pulled Remus to the side and whispered. "Sirius is afraid to say it, but... he loves you, you know. He really does, you didn't see his reaction when he found out you were gone." Remus nodded sadly. "I do know. I'm always watching him. I loved him too- tell him that." He smiled, then disappeared with the rest of the ghosts.
Although the three of them weren't in the best moods with one another, they all put a smile of their faces to greet Hagrid. Hagrid, wanting to catch up with the trio, just set the class to do some revision on Leshies, or more commonly known as 'The King of Nature'. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat to the side with Hagrid and wrote down a couple of notes but were more focused on talking to their old friend.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
Harry stood, frozen to the spot, until he came to his senses. Draco. He needed to protect Draco, his one chance of happiness. Harry ran after Draco, looking out for a glimpse of blonde or purple hair.
Harry just stood under the warm water for a bit, wincing whenever it hit his cuts and scratches left from the Dursley's, before actually washing. After a while, Harry finally got out of the shower, wrapped the towel round his waist and went to the sink to brush his teeth. He looked in the mirror, and his glamour had worn off. Harry looked horrible. He looked in the mirror for a bit, then picked up his toothbrush and paste. You look disgusting. Harry just ignored the little voice he had inside his head since the battle. Nobody will want to even touch you. It's your fault they're all gone.
"Why does he know?" Draco snapped, turning to Harry. "I didn't tell him!" Harry said, putting his hands up in defence. "No, George did, But also, I'm his best friend so I kind of have a right to know." Ron smirked. Harry turned to Ron and narrowed his eyes so they were simply just slits.
"Well, before I tell you why I was in the hospital, there's a bit of a backstory. It all started when Dumbledore left me with the Dursleys all those years ago. I always told you how much I hated living with them, but there was a real reason behind it."
Hermione had been taking small sips of her firewhiskey, but didn't allow herself to drink too much- drunk Hermione is a reckless Hermione. "Let's play spin the bottle truth or dare!" Seamus hiccuped, holding up an empty bottle of vodka (mainly drank by Harry, who had just wanted to forget all the pain he'd been through and all his worries for a night).
"This trial isn't about me," he boomed, his voice echoing through the dark halls. "If you'll proceed with the trial." Harry nodded. "First of all, do you or do you not believe that Sirius Black is innocent?" Amelia Bones asked, her monocle hovering over her right eye glinting. "Sirius Black is innocent." Harry said clearly without a moment's hesitation. He recounted the story of how Peter Pettigrew betrayed his parents and Sirius was angry and tried to stop him and of how Sirius found him in his third year and Peter Pettigrew died of his own hand during Harry's imprisonment.
Harry had sat with Hermione at lunch whilst Draco caught up with Blaise. People had been giving the saviour and the ex death eater some odd looks at how much time they had spent together since they had been enemies for seven years, so they had decided to spend a little bit of time apart, as much as it killed them.
Harry was gobsmacked. He actually had an invite back. A chance to get away from the Dursley's. As much as Harry hated the thought of facing everyone who he had hurt, he would be getting away from the Dursley's, hopefully forever. Harry cleaned up his face, started writing an acceptance note then realised I don't have an owl. Harry thought sorrowfully of his childhood pet, yet another of the number of people who died at his near hand. He'd have to go to Diagon Alley to send his letter off.
"Oh, uh, I smell broom polish and um, fresh quidditch fields." He lied. "Of course! Such an avid young flier, no doubt that it could make you a career in the future." He smiled.
Harry ran up to his dorm and started digging through his trunk for the marauders map when he heard a smash and a bang coming from the bathroom. He ran in and saw Draco, back to his normal self, standing with his back to Harry, a mirror shattered and shampoo bottles thrown across the floor.
"So what if I was gay?" Harry announced. "What are you going to do, lock me up? How would that help anybody?" He said snarkily. "It would keep them safe from your curse!" Fudge snapped, stepping back as if Harry were contagious. "Being gay isn't a disease! It isn't a choice or a life style, it's who a person is and they don't control that! Nothing else to it. Your idea of gay people is that one touch, then you are suddenly going to be irresistibly in love with a person of the same gender? Minister, you and I have shaken hands many times before, tell me do you feel yourself lured to men, do you find them attractive in the way you believe you should not?"
"Harry, are you in here?" A voice called from outside the door. Hermione. Harry went to grab his wand but then realised it was in the other room. He couldn't let her see him like this. "Please," Harry said to Draco. "Please, wand!" Harry croaked. Hesitantly, Draco passed Harry his wand. He quickly cast a glamour over himself, turned the tap on and was pretending to wash his hands when Hermione Came In.
Draco came out of their dorm room and saw Harry sitting on the sofa instead of going down to the great hall. "Potter," he shouted. Harry turned around and saw him leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. "You need to go to breakfast and eat." He stated. "I'm not hungry." Harry muttered. "Fine then, I'm not hungry too," Draco said and sat opposite Harry on the armchair. "No, don't not eat because of me. You don't want to end up a mess like me," Harry sighed. "If you go down to the great hall then I do too. If you don't, then I don't." Draco said, crossing one leg over the other.
"When you ran off and I couldn't find you I was so scared. I was really worried that Lucius found you," Draco sat up and looked at Harry bleary eyed. "Why would you be worried?" He asked. "Why do you insist on helping me?" Harry acknowledged.
Ron and Hermione retreated into their room for an 'early night' even though it was only eight o' clock. 8 o' clock! Harry remembered the note he had received earlier and suddenly just got nervous. Draco left the common room claiming that Slughorn wanted to see him for some reason, which Harry did not know. Must be something to do with Slytherin.
Waking up, later on, Harry rubbed his eyes, glancing around the empty room. He slowly stood up still feeling wheezy. Before he wandered around the house, heading to the kitchen. Where he was shocked to find Sirius.
Sighing, he pulled out his phone. Flicking through the previous text messages once more, noticing Harry hadn’t messaged him. His mind was full of memories from the night before in Harry’s room. He closed his eyes and lent his head against the wall. It had been nearly a full day already, and still no word from Harry.
“That’s up to you, you can use the arts and crafts to decorate them however you want,” Draco pushed a bag towards James, and folding several pieces of cards in half, giving him a range of colours to pick from.
The entire place looked different from his last visit. The deck was covered in paperwork with various boxes and decorations dotted around the place.
Malfoy meanwhile pulled out his phone, tilting his head to the side as he stared at the phone for a while before hitting reject.
“How many kids are coming, Pott- Harry?” Draco asked, still focusing on his exact straight folds. It felt weird to be using their first names. While at school, every time they used first names it had been filled with hatred and offhand remarks, now it couldn’t feel more different. It was in a personal, almost friendly way.
"Not you!" Harry jumped around before turning back to the devious snake. "I'm not having this conversation!" He wandered back to the bed, placing his hands over his ears, and hummed loudly to drown out Nagini's words. As Harry stood at the edge of his bed, he realised he had forgotten one small issue: the person currently in his bed. Glancing across the room, he met the yellow eyes watching with amusement, still hidden under Draco’s blanket. “You’ve not won this,” He stated, grabbing the duvet, then paused mid-action to add "
“Why are you here?” Ron questioned with a weary look in his eye once he retched the pair. Placing the two drinks on the other side of the table from Pansy.
Malfoy paused mid rearranging to accept Harry’s phone, typing something out before throwing it back to Harry and continuing to search in several boxes.
Pansy was scary. There was a reason that girl managed to make Rita Skeeter cry and promise not to report on any of the Hogwarts 8th year students again. Pansy would achieve great things one day, providing she didn’t get knocked out by a rogue snowball. Perhaps the one in Draco’s hands right now.
Pansy titled her head smirking, “I wasn’t going to say anything. Nothing about you and Potter, or your disregard for your own rules on unscheduled meetings.”
“We are NOT going through this again, Potter. We’ve already wasted far too much time,” Malfoy said, as he held up the finished letter.
Taking a seat, Harry tried to force the frown from his face, as a thought occurred to him, “Did. Was that a prank? Did you just prank me?” Harry didn’t mean to stutter, but his mind couldn’t understand it.
“Scorpius what are you- Noo!” Draco, who had otherwise been distracted trying not to laugh, spoke too late, He sighed “why did you put a pen lid up your nose?”
Malfoy nodded, “It’s a start, and we have time before Christmas day, little and often.” He commented standing in the middle of the room, almost looking like he was afraid to touch anything.
Draco & Harry hug while watching the lights turn on, then go to the pub where Ron & Draco have a drunken heart to heart confirming Harry is interested in guys. Later when travelling home drunk Harry kisses Draco.
Harry looked around, his shoulders dropping when he spotted something. “Ah. I wondered what they had done.”
“What?” Pansy pipped up, baffled by the entire situation. She felt like they had knocked her off her post and she did not like that feeling whatsoever.
“Really, Potter? Whenever? Perhaps the 13 of May 2045?!” Malfoy waved his handoff into the distance.
“You know how important this is, that they believe we are a couple,” Harry debated cancelling the entire thing.
“Guests? But we never clean-up for guests,” Albus questioned, accidentally knocking over Harry’s recently arranged coffee-table with his blanket.
“Invites? Aren’t we just sending them a text?” Harry wondered out loud, after all, that had been his plan so far.
“Send your owl ASAP, otherwise the food will be fed to Luna’s omnomnomer,” Malfoy said, sending Harry a blank expression.
“What do you mean, Longbottom?” Draco snapped at the guy stood not far away from the pair, watching them.
“I still think we should have added Sirius & Remus’s names as it’s their house,” Harry remarked once again.
Ron tipped some sugar into his drink, “Draco is coming over on Christmas day.” He said. “And the twins are working on some pranks to help move things along, they are going to install some while Harry’s out the house, then the rest on Christmas Day once Draco has arrived.”
“You can, or you could do something better. How about writing out your wish list for Santa?” Malfoy asked, earning squeaks from the boys as they pulled themselves up onto the seats.
Glancing over, his heart partly sank as he noticed the glitter bathed tabletop, with added glitter in Albus’ hair. Who was still working away on his ‘list’ Harry could feel himself smiling like a fool. But he didn’t care. Pulling out his phone, he took a quick snap of Albus and sent it to Ginny. Harry hadn’t appreciated how much work Ginny put into Christmas. She always just got on with it. To imagine she would do all this alongside training for quidditch. He shook his head, amazed by her achievements.
When Pansy returned to her desk later that day, she had accomplished nothing. Weasley was sure Draco was going on Christmas day, but Draco hadn’t sounded so sure when she spoke to him. She had to do something. However, was struggling to think of what exactly. Lost in thought, she didn’t realise someone had entered until they spoke. Causing her to jump off her chair.
Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and assisted him up. “Sorry, he wants to be a Rhino today and Rhinos can’t use human words.” He explained.
“That’s the one! Looking at the Head of Tree’s sales.” Greg smiled with pride in his eyes, “I took an early lunch break, the tills are bloody hard work, I was just coming back when I saw you two paying. By the time I got across the courtyard, you had run off. Bloody shame I’d have given you the work discount, it’s a good 20% as well, but I’d take some more off for you!” Grieg nudged his shoulder.
The next morning came far too quickly for Draco’s liking. He was getting too old for all these parties one day after another. It had nothing to do with the fact he’d been up most of the night texting a certain someone.
Sirius shook his head, “Nope. He helped Teddy finish his work, then said he wanted to leave before any other injuries happened. Something about my little Rhino having a powerful headbutt.” Sirius chuckled at the idea. “And he’d see you again Christmas eve if not before.” Sirius shrugged.
Draco took a deep breath, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder, “It’s not. I just. I forgot it was,” Failing to find any words.
“Gold star for Potter, he’s learning.” Draco playfully sassed. “Back in the days of courtships, people only got a chance to speak to others outside of the family at balls, so Christmas gave the perfect opportunity to make connections. The more balls, the more chances for these to be made.”
Pansy re-applied her lipstick and checked her hair before entering the shop. It was quaint. In a, she'd happily never return kind of way. Skirting around the tables with children, her target was at the back of the shop.
“Ohh...” Harry said as the realisation hit him. Sitting down next to Draco, he couldn’t help but tease, “Aww the wittle baby snake has the chills.”
“Delightful,” Draco replied, flinging the slimy object across the room. It bounced off the wall and slid down the back of a chest, causing something to move. Draco froze as he processed the dark green object slithering towards him. Realising what it was he screamed, jumping onto his bed.
“I know that’s why I have it!” Harry failed to pull the duvet back before Draco lay down, using his pillow. About to push the boy out of his bed a thought crossed Harry's mind,
"Hissss- Nooo I ssssset up the perfect plan, it took me agessssss." The reptile replied from her current hiding place, once Harry reached Draco’s bed.
Having finally handled all the kid-related situations and finished the pile of letters, the two adults sat back, savouring a moment of silence.
“I do not run. I walk with passion.” Draco slipped his drink. Baffled how so many people from Hogwarts could be at one place at one time.
A shiver ran the full way down Harry’s body. He looked directly into Draco’s eyes, “Never.” He said, placing a hand of Draco’s cheek, removing the small distance between them as he brashly kissed Draco.
“You know how the kids invited all the other kids? Well, Albus wanted to invite Scorpius. So Harry did that dot thing for Albus to follow. Albus followed the dots, wrote the message and gave it to Scorpius. Who gave it to Draco to read. In reality, Harry just wrote it out, thinking it was a fun and sweet moment for the boys without realising what he was doing. But Draco thinks it’s an invite where Harry was too embarrassed to do it himself, So he convinced Albus to invite Scorpius, to secretly invite Draco.” Ron used his hands to explain.
Gathering his thoughts, Harry followed, finding Draco coming out from the sitting room. “Before I forget. Here this is for you.” Draco handed over the bag from before, “Don’t get excited.”
“We’ve got guests coming,” Harry called over his shoulder, grabbing several magazines and random paperwork from the coffee table trying to find somewhere to shove them.
“Right, only ten more letters,” Harry glanced over the mostly crossed-out list, impressed with how much they had achieved.
“Someday. I can’t crash here forever; we’ve already intruded on Sirius and Remus for too long. Where do you live?”
Sticking his head into the living room, he wanted to cry at the Legos now covering the entire floor again. But the Boys seemed happy, so he left them to it.
“Why don’t you think up a spell then genius? Don’t just sit there!” Finding that received no reaction, Draco started to think of something else to shout at the stupid Potter.
“If only there was something warm & soft in this room I could use,” Draco dramatically stated before bursting into another sneezing fit.
“We can hardly use your handwriting. We need the guests to understand it’s an invitation, not a death threat or ancient summoning sigil,” Malfoy swiped, cocking an eyebrow.
“Are you okay?” Malfoy slowly asked, gently pulling his arm free from Harry’s grip. Odd hints of worry in his eyes.
After a while of silence, Draco opened his eyes. “Do you ever wonder why most of the ministry shuts down for Christmas? I mean, nothing else shuts down, so why would the government?”
“Umm, we aren't...” Harry paused for a moment, scratching his head, “We kind of broke up...” He said, watching Draco.
“Draco. It’s nice to meet you, Harry.” Malfoy offered one of his rare genuine smiles as he finally returned the handshake, moments before Harry was going to give up.
“No, they don’t.” He said leaving the room, before shouting, “Feng-Shui doesn’t exist. Watch as nothing bad happ-“ His voice cut off by a loud bashing sound.
“But you don’t need-” speechless Draco ducked his head. Harry couldn’t tell if he was trying to not laugh or cry, perhaps both.
“First a potato, now a ripe banana. Why do you have all this food?” Waving the object towards Harry.
“It’s not soft!” Draco could feel his patience going, he felt horrible and Harry’s obliviousness was making him want to cry.
“Okay. It’s fine, We can get it out. Just breathe out! No, breathe through your nose. Now close your mouth and breathe through your nose.” Harry continued with his instructions, Albus not understanding.
“Mummy says you are so disorganised you’d forget your head if it wasn’t attached,” James said as he continued collecting bricks.
“That tends to happen when you have classes together,” Draco snarked, trying to keep the edges of his lips from rising.
Sighing, he bit down on his nervousness, he wanted this, and he was going to fight for it. He typed out a message and sent it. If Harry had decided he wanted nothing else to do with Draco, the least he could do is tell him.
“Yes..” Malfoy slowly commented furrowing his brow, “Pansy said you have completed your list of invitees?”
“No. This is me and Scorpius' first Christmas together. We are staying here and having a quiet day.” Draco walked past her, refusing to continue.
“No,” Harry’s voice broke as he replied, spotting Draco’s knowing look. “Shut up,” he snapped then determinedly marched down the path.
Harry’s smile fell from his face, “What? Have you put a pen lid up your nose?” Harry shouted, diving across the table.
As soon as he reached Draco, he hugged him without thinking, warmth filling Harry when he felt the other’s arms returning the hug.
Draco’s eyes narrowed, looking at the mistletoe. Before he lent forwards, “Scared Potter?” he whispered against the shell of Harry’s ear.
Pansy lifted a single eyebrow as she smirked towards Draco, “Oh really now? on Christmas day?” She fluttered her eyelashes in the manipulative manner, Draco was glad to never fall for.
“No, that’s whistling, but it’s brilliant whistling Albus!” Harry smiled. “Now do that, but through your nose, not your mouth.”
Draco lifted his head to look at the other, “Friendship was all I dared hope for,” He said with a small smile.
“No. That. It’s good. But I just didn’t expect it.,” He tripped over his words. Deciding to change the topic instead of continuing, “Is that arts and crafts stuff?” He questioned having not expected to see them.
“You are wandering around the room singing at 3 am,” Draco glanced towards Harry before he rolled back onto his side and wrapped the duvet higher up his neck.
Draco sighed, “Fine. I just thought that…” He let his words trail off to a level the other couldn’t hear, no matter how far inwards he lent.
“Oh, you wouldn’t be laughing if you’d seen naked Sirius attacking a plant as many times as I have.” Harry shook the idea out of his head.
“Aww is your poor hand getting tired lifting that heavy stamp?” Draco chuckled, dramatically shaking his hand as he spoke, amusement dancing in his eyes.
Hermione sighed, “The two idiots have danced around each other for too long, We are trying to set them up, starting with Getting Draco to attend Christmas day.”
After a while, Harry smirked, “Oh, what a brilliant idea! Why didn’t I think of that?” Harry dramatically said, waving the stamp he was already holding around.
Greg had brought up a fair point. Was Draco supposed to bring him as a plus one, were they at the stage? Harry had invited him to the Carols, that was a group event, perhaps Draco was supposed to invite him to something as well. Sneaking through the service door, Draco lent against the wall, finishing his drink before placing the empty glass on a tray heading back into the kitchen.
"Moony?" He cried, as the werewolf looked at him, broken. He looked younger than the last time Sirius had seen him. "Death has done me some good deeds," he chuckled. "I look good and I don't turn into a monster once a month. Neither does Tonks, which is always good to hear!" Remus grinned mischievously.
The two boys sat in an awkward silence for a while. Harry didn't feel like talking. He hadn't since he got rid of Voldemort. He felt like every word he could say would make everything worse, another person would fall dead at the tip of his tongue. "Not so talkative, eh Potter?" Malfoy sneered. Glad to see he hasn't changed. Malfoy must've seen the look on Harry's face, because he quickly said "sorry, old habits in awkward situations." Harry just nodded and looked out the window.
Sirius got up and headed towards the staircase that lead to the boys dormitories. Harry got up and followed, all the way to the room where he used to sleep. "Why are we in my old dorm room?" He asked. "My old dorm too, you know." Sirius smiled, sitting on Ron's old bed. "This was my old bed. That was James's," he said, indicating to Harry's old bed. "Remus's and Pettigrew's. We all scratched our initials in- and I see you and Ron had the same idea." He grinned.
Even though it had taken her a little while longer to forgive him, Ron and Hermione were back on track. "Just kiss already!" Harry grinned and Ron's ears went red but Hermione pulled him into a kiss. "None of that in my classroom whilst a lesson is in progress please!" Barton snapped and Hermione pulled away blushing furiously. "Today we will be learning a new found spell to block the cruciatus curse. First, I'll need a volunteer to demonstrate the curse on!" The class chuckled but then stopped as they saw Barton had a dead serious look on his face.
"Eat." Draco said plainly, pointing to Harry's plate which had been loaded with eggs, bacon, beans and so much more. But instead, Harry just took an apple from the fruit bowl and started nibbling on it. "I didn't want to do this Harry, but you leave me no choice," Harry looked at Draco, confused, "What do you mea-" But before Harry could finish, a spoon full of scrambled eggs was shoved into his mouth.
Harry crawled into his bed after getting a rather nasty beating from Uncle Vernon, when an owl swooped into his window. Harry untied the piece of parchment attached to its leg, gave it a couple of his old owl treats and watched as the charming bird flew away. He rolled open the piece of parchment, expecting to see Rons scruffy writing or Hermione's neat, but instead an unknown was layed out in front of him. Potter, meet me on the end of Privet Drive tomorrow afternoon at 2. We need to talk- D.
"That's the first time we've don't that where we haven't been walked in on!" Harry laughed. "I wouldn't be so sure about that." A voice came from behind a tree, making the two boys jump. Professor Barton stepped out, holding the video camera Draco had been using, which was pointed straight at them.
Harry started to head inside, after going to the owlery and writing a letter to the ministry. He needed to know who wasn't there anymore, as much as it killed him. People started throwing him looks, not mean looks, but not nice either. Harry spotted the Weasley's crouched over Fred's body, sobbing into each other. He walked forward a bit, and then sat by Remus and Tonks' bodies. The last marauder and his wife, gone. They had a child together, now orphaned just like Harry was. He pushed the thoughts of his little blue haired Godson out of his mind, and held Lupin's hand, tears threatening to fall.

Harry slowly drank, catching his breath and nuzzling close to Draco. "Harry," a soft voice gasped. He turned his head to see George kneeling beside him. He finally looked into his face but saw that the eyes weren't looking back at him, but rather at his torso and his arms.
"Harry, look at me, okay. Focus. Focus on my voice and my voice only. I'm here and you are here too. We're both here in this moment in time, we exist and we will be on this earth together until the sky falls. I'm always, always going to be your Godfather and I'm not going anywhere. I'm here right now, so focus more on the present and less on the past. We're here." Harry had calmed down slightly, his grip loosening on the mirror as his ragged breaths evened out.
He finally left the common room, him and Sirius still glaring daggers at each other. Harry unfolded the parchment and stared at it puzzled
"Right. Well, I have some homework to do, and quite frankly, I don't want to do it with a homophobe like you, so I'm going to go into my dorm room and do it." He snapped, and stormed off. When he walked in to room number seven, he saw Draco sitting on his bed with a book in his hands.

"He beat this illness with the help and confidence of the people who loved him, and you need to let your friends help too. Accept help from anyone that offers it or else your just going to whither away bit by bit." Sirius got up and walked out, leaving and emotional Harry with an emotional school nurse who had been eaves dropping on their entire conversation.
Harry didn't know why, but he got up, stormed out and went straight towards Neville's room. "Oh, hey Harry," Neville smiled as he walked in. Luna was in there too, doing her makeup for the party. "Luna, you need to tell him," Harry said bluntly. Luna looked confused, but then saw Ginny at the door. "Oh," she said dreamily. "Well, seems as you told Harry I suppose I can tell Neville," Luna said and sat down opposite Neville. Harry nodded then walked out of the room to give them some privacy.
At once, all of Harry's worries we're back in his head again. "POST!" A third year boy suddenly shouted and all the eighth years nursed their heads again, braving themselves for the screeching of the owls. "Hangovers are the worst," Seamus complained as the owls flew overhead. "I don't really mind them." Harry shrugged as a letter fell onto his plate.
"I know it's a long shot, but, would you maybe want to come to the party with me?" He asked, blushing and rubbing the back of his neck. "Thought you were going with the Weasley girl?" Malfoy asked, sitting down at a table. Harry followed and sat opposite him.
Inside the frame were two pieces of paper, holding the same vows Harry had heard in the wedding memory. On the ribbon, there were two wedding rings. "I was going to give these to you as a wedding gift but now seems more fitting." Sirius nodded. Harry threw his arms around his Godfather and they stayed for a while, talking about baby Harry and hilarious pranks the marauders used to play.
"I'm taller than you now!" Harry shouted, grinning as he made his way back down to see Draco standing there filming him with a Muggle video camera, watching as Harry monkeyed his way up and down trees.
"Oh," Kreacher said simply, eyes widening and ears drooping. "Dobby always spoke of how highly Master Draco spoke of Master Harry Potter when he is still working for the Malfoy family!" Draco blushed at this and Sirius smirked. "We should be off now boys- don't want to be late to my own trial!" He chuckled and headed towards the fireplace. "Oh, Sirius!" Harry called suddenly and his godfather took a couple steps back so Harry could whisper, "Remus told me he loved you too. You meant the world to him. Thinking about it now, I feel kind of selfish. He had to hold me back from following you through the archway with the veil, when all he probably wanted to do was the same, I'm so stupid, I didn't even think about how bad it may have affected him and now look, I'm making it about myself again, I should just- everybody would be better off- I'm sor-"
The song ended and the sound of applause filled the room. Harry came back to the real world and saw that everyone was clapping, seemingly at them. "That was beautiful," one girl whispered. "They look like they could be soulmates for all we know, it was perfect!" Another boy said. Harry and Draco blushed at the comments, but bowed together.

"I don't remember the early days but from when I was around three or four, I was abused by the Dursley's. It started off as spankings if I didn't do as I was told but it progressively got worse. I remember once, it was Mother's day and I saw Dudley giving Aunt Petunia a bunch of flowers, so I went into the garden and picked a flower and gave it to her. She started crying and I wasn't sure why but Vernon punished me for it. It was the first time I broke a bone and they didn't even take me to the hospital. I assumed that Petunia was crying because I picked her flower from the garden, but now I know it was because it was a Lily."
It was a bit chilly in the November air but the tree's and the castle and simply everything was just beautiful in the autumnal season. The two boys sat under a tree, far away from civilisation.
Hermione put a protective shield around the two men as students started yelling stunning spells, thinking Harry was being attacked. McGonogall ran in hurriedly and yelled "STOP!" The spells stopped immediately.
Harry got up off the floor and sat beside Ginny on her bed. He had stopped crying ad now just felt pure fury. "I can't believe I let him play me like that," he said. "Nobody could have known Harry. It all looked so genuine." Ginny stopped talking as the four other Gryffindor girl seventh years and a couple of Ravenclaw girls came in. "Oh, are you alright Harry?" Luna asked. "Let's go somewhere more private and collect Hermione along the way." Harry whispered, and got up, grabbing Ginny's hand softly, as he still had to pretend in front of the others that he was her boyfriend. He quickly sent a patronus to Hermione telling her to meet them in the Room of Requirements, where him and the two girls were headed.
McGonogall seemed to be watching him closely, but at this moment, he seemed to look completely innocent. But Harry knew better. After Barton showed himself the night before, the boys just ran. They would have stayed and fought against him, but they didn't have the energy.
Draco stood frozen in fear as he watched his roommate stand on the edge of the balcony. He never thought it would be this bad. He thought that Harry was getting better, he said that he was happy just earlier that evening!
"I lost all hope! Before, I was so desperate to cling onto something or someone worth living for and that was you. Of course, my Godfather came back but it's not the same as- as loving somebody" Harry took a deep breath and sighed heavily and Draco didn't speak.
Harry smelled the potion, and immediately smelt hair product, strong cologne and green apples. Draco, he thought. "Well?" Slughorn pried.
Sunday morning came and Harry walked downstairs to make the Dursley's breakfast before going to Kings Cross Station. Harry smiled to himself as he put the plates in front of Vernon, Dudley and Petunia and was about to walk away when Dudley spoke up.
"Give it up, Draco. You fooled me once, you aren't going to fool me again. You've had your fun now leave me alone." Harry croaked, his eyes watering slightly. "But- but what about our bond, check your wrist!" Draco said hopeful that this would prove he was telling the truth.
"How long have I been in here? What happened?" Harry questioned, trying to recollect the memories of Halloween night. He remembered happily dancing with Draco, then they were up in the forms and Ron came in whilst they were kissing... Oh Merlin.
He stepped out of a ministry fireplace just as Draco came whizzing down followed shortly by Sirius. They both looked worriedly at Harry who had began to walk and was no sooner bombarded by witches and wizards. "Foul, unnatural boy! You should have been locked up!" A witch with dark violet robes snapped at him. "Be careful or I might just kiss a boy in front of your children!" Harry said sarcastically and chuckled as the witch squealed and fled.
"Now look, you've ruined it!" Draco said, sitting himself down next to Harry. "I've just been given this," Draco muttered, handing Harry an envelope. There was a slip of parchment and a photograph inside. The parchment read 'I will avenge my master, Harry Potter shall finally meet his end!'
"I'm sorry, Padfoot. It's all my fault they're gone." Harry sighed. "No Harry, it isn't. It's Voldemorts alright? But now he's gone! And I'm here and nobody else is going anywhere." Sirius said, then McGonogall came back in.
After ten minutes of her awkwardly trying to get Harry to drink different potions, Draco came in and Pomfrey left leaving the two boys with some privacy. "You did it!" Harry grinned. "Yeah, well the dementor was about to kiss you and ain't nobody touching those lips but me!" He laughed in a joke sassy voice.
"Your last words before you, um- you know, were that you had always loved me and something just clicked. You remember now I said that there was this one boy who I saw in a new light? That was you, Harry. I've seen every year of being in this school, you always been brave and loving and protecting your friends no matter what the cost. I fell for you. I've always loved you too, Potter." Draco blushed and Harry did too.
There was no shouting anymore. Draco's voice arrived and was seemingly directed towards Harry. "Harry, just wait, please! We can talk about this, you just need to come back inside!" Harry heard Hermione wailing and didn't even think Ron was in the room anymore.
"Oh this poor, poor boy! It's going to take him a while to get back up and running," Madame Pomfrey frowned, putting her hand to Harry's forehead. "He has nightmares too. Herm- Granger, said that it's this thing called PTSD. He gets memories and flashbacks from the war." Draco added.
"Did you guys see anything suspicious about the new defence professor?" Hermione asked. "No," Ron and Harry both answered. "The very first thing he did when he came in was ask Harry to sit at the front," Hermione said, shaking her head. "Mione. Harry's famous, what would you expect?" Ron laughed.
"What are you doing here?" Sirius spat. "I'm a professor here. I needn't ask what you're doing here, I heard about your little fiasco in the Great Hall. Bet you loved that attention, didn't you?" Barton spat back. "I'm confused," Harry stated. "You two know each other?"

Harry gaped at him, before leaping up and running to get his guitar. "I didn't know Harry played an instrument?" Hermione admitted. "Neither did I!" Ginny said. "We did!" Seamus hiccuped, rocking around in circles and making himself dizzy. He had drunk almost as much as Harry. Almost.
Harry rolled his eyes but leant in and pressed a kiss against Draco's neck. "I'm glad to have you back Ferret."
Hermione was sat patiently in the common room, but when she saw him, she looked as though she might just explode. "What is it Hermione?" Harry asked, slumping down on an armchair. "You can cast wandless spells! Why didn't you tell me?" She gasped. "What do you mean?" Harry said. "Your patronus! The stag! I picked up your wand after charms because I had to go back and ask Professor Flitwick about some extra homework and I saw your wand and picked it up! I was so surprised by Sirius coming back I forgot to give it to you, and when the Dementors were there is was about to pass it to you when your stag came anyway-"
"A dares a dare," Harry shrugged, winking then kissing Malfoy on the forehead, nose, cheek and then lips. "Scared Malfoy?" Harry asked, smirking as he pulled Draco closer. "You wish." He grinned.
A dementor separated from the herd and headed straight towards Harry. Harry reached for his wand then realised, with complete horror, he'd left it in charms.
"I think this may be the one time I wish the wizarding world was more like the Muggle world. Nobody can arrest me for holding your hand," Draco smiled sweetly, and grabbed Harry's hand from across the table. Harry was about to respond, when he saw a family of three walk through the open door and his face drained of all colour as he attempted to duck under the table.
They broke away and looked at one another. "You, Mr. Potter are very much gay, and one hell of a kisser." Draco winked, then walked out of the dorm room, wiggling his bottom slightly making Harry giggle and blush.
Harry hugged his boyfriend hard, and then saw the perfect tree for climbing and scrambled over. Most people wouldn't have been able to climb it, but Harry had years of practise running away from his fat cousin.
"Wait, what? How do you know who it is?" Harry asked suspiciously. "I may or may have seen you kiss in the infirmary. But the encanta bond, Harry! Really?" Harry tapped his wand to his wrist, revealing the heart and then showed it to Sirius.
Sirius Black watched through the hospital wings window as his Godson and the Malfoy boy exchanged kisses. Harry is going to have a hard time denying those charges when he is so clearly in love with that other boy.
But, as Ron sat in his bedroom, aged eighteen, without his friends who were undoubtedly having fun without him, began to regret ever going against his Mother's word. He silently cursed himself for being a young gullible boy, but still couldn't get his past beliefs out of his head.
"No," Harry and Draco replied together. "Why else do you think I'm sitting in Draco's lap?" Harry giggled. "Just me," Hermione sighed. "Straight but single. You guys are all illegal yet have better love lives than I do." Everyone threw Hermione sympathetic smiles, even overly drunk Harry.
Whilst they were planning all day, Hermione brought up food from the kitchens, watching Harry closely to make sure he ate more than just one pomegranate seed. Draco also pushed Harry to eat more, which he reluctantly obliged to. He didn't say it out loud, but he was glad he was getting better and it made him even happier that it was Draco helping.
Just as Harry was about to walk back, he felt a hand on his shoulder. Naturally, Harry whipped his wand out, turned around quickly and pressed it to the persons neck. "Relax!" A male voice came. Harry looked up. It was Draco Malfoy.
The evening came around and the Weasley's had left, George lingering for a few minutes after to check up on Harry then flooing away.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's cheek and stroked his cheekbone softly with his thumb before connecting their lips in a soft, warm embrace. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and pulled back, only when he needed breath. "You take my breath away," he whispered, closing his eyes and taking in the scent of his soulmate. "And you, mine." Draco smiled and swooped in for another kiss. Without even realising, Harry's cheeks began to dampen with tears and Draco pulled back, looking at him worriedly.
"It's all my fault, and I am so sorry. Sorry that I had to be the chosen one, sorry that I was even born! Maybe if I wasn't then Fred would still be here. Mum, Dad, Sirius. They would all still be here." He slid down the wall, again, head between his knees. "Are you an idiot Weasel? Can't you see he already blames himself enough?" Came Malfoy's voice. "Keep your nose out of it Malfoy, it's none of your business." Ron said, then stormed out.
"What do you mean 'in the hospital'?" Sirius asked, standing up. "You didn't tell your Godfather about Halloween?" McGonogall asked, raising a brow. "No, and it's okay, really, he doesn't need to know!" He rushed.
Harry just stayed silent and watched as Hermione Came in and sat down. "You know what just happened Mione? Harry asked Ginny to go to the party together!" Ron smiled. "Oh, really?" She asked and gave Harry a death stare when she saw that he had put the grape on his plate. "Yeah," he replied, watching her put some eggs and bacon onto his plate. "Well, good for you." She smiled at him, but her eyes told a different story.
"No, of course not!" Fudge snapped, his face turning beet red reminding Harry of his uncle, which just angered him more. "We are real people with real emotions and if you can't see that, then maybe you are the one who needs to be locked away! Not us!" Harry's comments made everybody gasp and some even looked confused, as if they had taken in Harry's words and were questioning everything that had ever been taught to them about the gay agenda. However, Fudge still had a cold, harsh look upon his face. "How dare you talk to me like that! I am the minister of ma-"
"You must be a terrible kisser if that's the case," Malfoy chuckled. "You want to bet on it?" Harry smirked. He wasn't sure where he got this boost of confidence from, but he was enjoying it. "Oh, I'd love to." Draco whispered, and their lips locked together like two matching pieces of a jigsaw.
It was true. Ron and Harry had been through thick and thin, had fought by each others side for almost 8 years. "Do you wanna call truce mate? Forget everything we said in the bedroom. We both said really stupid things, me mainly. You should know none of us blame you for what happened. I'm sorry mate." Ron sighed, holding his hand out. "I'm sorry too." Harry said, and shook Ron's hand. They smiled at each other and continued the lesson in a much happier mood.
"You do? Seamus growled. "You didn't even finish your third bottle! How do you think I feel? Harry's still a bit drunk for fucks sake!" Draco had started putting some bacon on Harry's plate, when Harry stopped him. "Come on Harry, you know you need to eat," he whispered. "I'm... Uh.... Going vegan." Harry muttered. Draco rolled his eyes and put some toast on his plate instead, but keeping the bacon to the side.
"Dare!" Harry shouted like an excited toddler. "I'm a brave lion! Grrr!" He giggled. Draco loved seeing Harry like this, happy and carefree. "I dare you to play us something on your guitar! Yes Harry, I know your secret passion too!" He grinned deviously.
"You are going to be happy again, my emerald. I've told you before and I'm going to tell you again and again until you believe it. I'm going to make sure of it." Draco replied. The boys sat in silence for a while until Harry spoke up.

Sirius scoffed. "Know each other? Archie Barton practically grew up in my house. Regulus's best friend. He gave me this!" Sirius lifted his hair up to show a ghastly scar on the back of his neck.
Harry looked to Draco's pale wrist too see that he too, had a heart tattoo except it was thumping at a normal rate and was mainly red with a bit of black at the end. "Interesting." Hermione pondered.
It was seven in the evening and Ron announced he was going back to school, and stepped through the floo. He tried to do it rather hastily, as his mother got over excited and emotional at 'her baby finally getting some sense into him'. When Ron fell out of McGonogall's fireplace and saw that the office was empty, he made a run for it, all the way up to eighth year tower. He dropped his trunk by an abandoned sofa and ran straight towards room number seven.
"Answer me Harry, why!" Hermione pushed. "Why else do you expect! I was living with the Dursley's, not one letter from anyone, who did I have to talk to! Dudley? Yeah, because while I'm doing the work around the house, I'm just going to ask 'oh, hey Duddykins, how was your day?' NOT ONE LETTER." Harry shouted, letting it all out.
"So we can't go together anymore?" She laughed lightly. Harry awkwardly chuckled, glad that she wasn't throwing shoes at him across the room. "What's your plan? To be able to go with him? You know you could be arrested for being seen with whoever it is?" Harry hastily explained his plan as she nodded along.
Harry, Hermione, Luna and Ginny had slept in the Room of Requirement as Harry didn't want to face reality just quite then. The next morning, Ron had come up to them nervously in his old, slightly worn out Gryffindor robes. "I'm ashamed to see you wear those robes after what you did!" Hermione spat, shocking everybody at the venom in her voice, especially Seamus and Dean who didn't know what had actually happened.
The Hogwarts express finally pulled up to platform 9 3/4 and Harry grabbed his stuff, waved to Malfoy and hopped off the train. He waited a minute to go through the wall, knowing that the Dursley's lie ahead. He watched various students run up to their families and cling onto them for dear life. Harry finally plucked up the courage and headed through the wall, where he found a great walrus of a man waiting for him. "Come on boy, there's dishes to do and they aren't going to clean themselves.”
Harry asked for a comfy room for privacy and walked in to find a nice looking common room with lots of sofas and cushions. There was even a large King sized bed in the corner. Harry flopped down on the nearest sofa, tears still spilling from his eyes, but not hyperventilating or screaming any longer than he already had. Hermione rushed in and joined them.
Draco was all Harry could think about. When he talked to him, Harry just wanted to answer but something was stopping him, like an invisible force inside his body telling him he's not allowed to get up and function properly. And so he listened, just like he always had.
"Nah, mate. Everyone's going to be going as a zombie. Do something original." He smiled then walked out. "That was close," Hermione said, releasing the breath she didn't know she was holding. "Yeah," Harry agreed as he put his glamour back on.
Harry, Ron and Hermione headed to their first class after the run in with Draco, and Harry noticed that that same boy had failed to show up. "That was a really brave thing you did back there Harry. Dr- Malfoy had to be lying he is- and I hate to say it- a very good wizard and would be able to easily surpass an imperius curse, as well as Pansy being a terrible witch and- oh, Harry. Are you alright. It's the first sign of emotion you've showed in weeks!" Hermione rambled as they sat at their desks.
"No need," Harry said, sadly. "What?" Sirius asked, confused. "Voldemorts dead. Gone. Kapush. Never coming back. But, Sirius... Neither is Remus." Harry looked up at his Godfather stricken with shock. His eyes had the same ghostly look to them, but now tears were falling and Sirius was shaking madly. "M- Moony? He's.. g-g-gone?" He cried, and Harry couldn't help but let a few tears go too. "I'm so sorry, Padfoot," Harry whispered, holding his Godfathers hand. Sirius screamed out, shaking all over with grief and Harry just sat with him until he calmed down a little bit.

"I'm sorry, but I just don't approve of my son dating a boy, let alone a Malfoy!" Draco almost collapsed. And he would've if he didn't have an overwhelming urge to shout. "Okay, look, I don't care that you are my boyfriends father and you're just as famous as he is and whatever, but you do NOT get to talk about him like that! Harry can make his own choices without Daddy protecting him and I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about that! So either deal with it and love your son for who he is, or go away." He growled, and Mr Potter looked taken aback.
So now, after watching him closely for a couple of minutes to make sure he was alright and stable, Draco carried on with his childish fort. When Harry awoke, his body ached immensely, but he didn't care. In fact, what he saw when he opened his eyes made him first lie there dumbly in shock then grin like a chimpanzee.
Harry had never felt more lonely. Sure, he now had a boyfriend, amazing friends and an alive Godfather, but he needed more. He needed a proper childhood, with loving parents who too, would send him a howler when he went to school in a flying car and shower him with embarrassing hugs and kisses when he got off the train after finishing another year of school. His Dad could've taught him Quidditch, his Mum could've taught him music, but he had to figure that out all by himself.
Of course, Anthony was cool and he was so much more chilled out than Mrs Weasley, so Ron listened to him. Ron learned wrong from right and did whatever Anthony told him to. Anthony was chased away by Mrs Weasley, though when she had saw him giving a seven year old some firewhiskey.
But, Harry just smiled sadly and locked eyes with Draco. "I love you Draco. I always have." And with that, he jumped. In a blink of an eye, Draco was leaning over the edge of the balcony, wand out and levitating Harry in mid air.
"Touch him and I swear to God, I will rip your head off of your fucking neck," Hermione growled as she and Ron stepped defensively either side of the raven haired boy. "No, it wasn't me!" Draco whined.
Harry opened his eyes on the last strum of his guitar and saw everybody staring at him wide eyed, and also almost everyone had come out of their dorm rooms to see who was singing. Harry blinked, then smiled. "I'm sorry, did I wake you up?" He asked the eighth years wearing pyjamas.
"Remember what I said, cub- focus on the present. Us being here now, a family re-untited even if it isn't whole." Harry raised a brow at this. "Cub?" He prompted, grinning. A look of relief spread across Sirius's face, thankful that he was able to talk some sense into Harry. "It seemed fitting at the time," He shrugged. "Come with me."
The whole room burst into applause and Harry jumped up and took a long bow. He put his guitar on an armchair near him then pulled Draco up next to him. "I wrote that song about yooouuuuu!" Harry giggled. The whole room went silent. "I love you Draaacccooooo!"
Hermione looked on the verge of tears when Ron bursted in. "Don't you speak to her that way you git, it's not her fault!" He spat, taking Hermione in his arms. Malfoy watched over his book at the argument currently taking place in his room. "Oh yeah, who's fault is it then? Mine?" Harry snarled. "Yeah, maybe it is. If you hadn't noticed, you could've sent a bloody letter!" Ron snapped. "WITH WHAT?" Harry screamed. He thought of Hedwig,  his old pet snowy owl who had died trying to protect him.
"It was you, wasn't it?" Malfoy asked. Harry just looked at the pale haired boy in confusion. "You sent that letter to the ministry, didn't you. Excusing my mother from her Azkaban sentence." Harry slowly nodded, thinking back to after the battle and sending off a letter from the owlery. "Thank you," Malfoy muttered and did something Harry thought that he could never do. Malfoy, Harry's sworn enemy since 1st year, hugged him.
Harry pulled on his extremely baggy clothes and headed downstairs. He put the bacon in the grill and the eggs on the stove. After he served up, he started his work for the day. 1:50 came around and Harry thought best for him to start getting ready to meet this mystery stranger.
Gasps and screams echoed from all around the room, wands were whipped out, but Sirius just headed straight for Harry. "Oh my!" Hermione gasped, leaping up. Harry stood up too, his stomach contracting in fear when Sirius knocked him into a massive bear hug. "Sirius, what are you-"
Harry smiled and remembered what his Godfather had said. "I need to get better, Draco. I need to work harder! And I really need you by my side whilst I try." Draco smiled and grabbed Harry's hands. "Well, that's a good thing then because I'm not going to let you out of my sight until I'm satisfied."
Harry had started to get a bit tired, so he went to investigate the bathroom. It had two toilet stalls, two showers and two sinks. Harry grabbed a towel out of the cabinet and put it on the railing outside of the shower stall. He stripped and turned the shower on.
Harry felt too sore to move, but then remembered the letter he had hid earlier. He grabbed his wand from his pocket, pointed at the places he knew were definitely broken, and fixed them with wordless spells. He slowly got up and stumbled over to the loose floorboard and grabbed the letter. It was no doubt, a letter saying he was going to Azkaban for killing hundreds of people.
"Hermione figured it out. First I started growling whenever anyone tried to hurt Draco and then that day with the dementors, that was Draco's patronus, the stag. Hermione being Hermione put two and two together and, well..." Harry held up his arm.
"Wow, that's so weird!" Dean gasped, downing half his bottle of firewhiskey in a few gulps. "I have a boyfriend and his name is Seamus!" Seamus giggled at his boyfriend and booped Dean on the nose. "Let's carry on with the game," Hermione smiled, finally moving onto her second drink.
Harry quickly made his way to platforms 9 and 10, made sure no muggles were watching, then ran through the wall, straight into the Weasley's. "Harry dear, it's so good to see you! Your looking well," Mrs Weasley beamed. Although she had a smile on her face, it was clear she had been crying.
'Well this sure complicates things' Harry thought to himself. "I'm not really paying attention to anyone at the minute. I meant what I said when we were in care of magical creatures. I don't know what I want to do when we get out of school," he sighed, rubbing his temples. "I thought you wanted to become an auror?" Hermione asked. "I did. But, I just didn't feel the same way about the job after the war." Ron and Hermione just nodded. "Maybe I'll just get a muggle job," Harry laughed, looking at the horrified expression on Ron's face. "Kidding!"
"I called on them a couple of nights ago. Who better to tell the story than the people who were in it?" Sirius said and Harry simply nodded. He had wanted to call on his parents ever since they left him again that night a couple of weeks ago, but he hadn't. Because you're a wimp. You can't look in the faces of the people you killed.
They talked for a while, and Draco got more and more comfortable with them. They treated him equally to Harry, which made him feel extremely happy. "Why are you treating me so well?" Draco asked suddenly. "I was horrible to Harry growing up, and if it were my son or daughter, I would be furious!" But Mrs Potter just smiled at him. "Because we know that you love him now. The past doesn't matter to us, just what lays ahead in the future for our son." Draco smiled and nodded. He understood.
Harry shook his head and smiled. "You're here now. That's all that matters in this moment of time." Sirius looked up at Harry, wiping away stray tears. "How are you holding up, Harry? You've been through too much for such a young boy."
Ron almost choked on his food, then finally put his fork down. "Azkaban of course. Horrid things, gay wizards are. Mum always told me to respect all wizards alike, but the gay ones are horrible." He said, almost shivering at the thought. Harry felt his heart drop. His best friend, couldn't accept him. That's if, he was actually gay of course.
"I remember once, we were all in detention- us mauraders, and the teacher fell asleep, so we had a fight with blackboard rubbers and then Minnie walks in and Remus hits her straight in the face! That's when she realised, I think, that Remus Lupin was not the good boy he pretended to be!" James laughed, grinning at the memory. "Who's Minnie?" Harry asked. "McGonagall. We spent so much time in detention with her, we just ended up nicknaming her and she knew that she wouldn't be able to stop us calling her that, so it stuck," James shrugged. "She was very nearly your godmother, actually. Sirius said he wishes she was because then they'd have to get married!" James laughed again but Harry was once again gaping stupidly at his father. McGonogall, his godmother?
"Harry, are you alright? How are you feeling! Has Madame Pomfrey checked up on you, I can do it if you want I know all the spells-" Harry laughed at Hermione and she turned light pink.
Harry smiled when they drew away and headed back to the eighth year table. "What was that, Harry?" Ron smirked as he sat down. "I asked Ginny to go to the party with me," Harry shrugged, and picked up a grape which he started to nibble on. "Nice, mate. You'll be the perfect pair, you know. You both support the gays for some reason," he said, muttering the last part and rolling his eyes.
"At least now there's nobody to stop me jumping. Nobody worth still being here for." Harry smiled a small, sad smile and walked away. Draco just stared after him, a confused look upon his face. "Dracy-poo?" Pansy said. "Harry." Was all that Draco replied, and willed himself to try and break the spell.
"And, Mr Potter, is  there anybody that you love? That you are with?" Leonara Pulse asked him with a delicate but obviously forced smile. "No, I'm alone." Harry lied, not wanting to get Draco into trouble. "I can speak otherwise!" Rita Skeeter cried from the stands. She showed everyone the photo of Harry and Draco she had taken, but her thumb was covering where Draco was stood so it simply looked like Harry leaning against a tree.
He tuned his guitar and sat on his bed, strumming chords. This was the first time he had played after the whole Draco fiasco, and it felt magical. He hummed random melodies to the music, making up sentences in his head as he played which he then wrote down in his song book.

Draco rolled his eyes, pulling Harry's head towards him so their lips almost connected- then Hermione burst through the door, holding a book and some old newspaper clippings and Draco let out a loud, audible groan. "Can't I just kiss my boyfriend without being disturbed for once!" He sighed, half shouting as Hermione covered her eyes.
"And why ever would I do that? I love sharing a room with Harry, it means I can be close to him all the time without having to make up excuses!" Draco grinned, resisting the eye roll which was urging to pass as his old Slytherin mates gawked at him like headless chickens. "Well, if Harry hasn't imperio'd you, them maybe we can." Pansy grinned, her pug-like face screwing up in mischief. And before Draco could react, the bitch already had him under her charm.
Everyone seemed to be inside, but just on the other side of the courtyard stood a boy, no older than Harry himself, who had pale blonde hair. Harry recognised him as Draco Malfoy, another 7th year. Harry wasn't entirely sure which side Malfoy had fought on during the war, but he knew his parents were sided with Voldemort. Harry saw Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy be taken away before their trials, to see whether they would be locked away for their crimes with Voldemort or not. He kind of felt sorry for Malfoy, but dared not to say it.
"I'm the worst friend, the worst brother, the worst boyfriend! How is Hermione?" He asked nervously. "She refused to talk about you. Would only stay with us if we spoke about something else. You really hurt her, Ron. You hurt everybody and if you can ever accept the idea that Harry can be with whoever he wants and go back to Hogwarts, then you're going to have a hell of a lot of work to do."
In the kitchen, a huge pile of dishes were stacked up. It would take all night if Harry did it by hand, so he got his wand out, careful to make sure nobody was looking and starting washing the dishes by magic. Just then an owl flew in through the window and landed on the kitchen counter. Vernon came stomping in and caught Harry with his wand out and dishes scrubbing themselves in the air. Without thinking, Harry grabbed the letter and ran up the stairs, hearing various dishes smash behind him. He shoved the letter under the loose floorboard where he used to keep his homework, and ran to door to try and block Vernon from coming in.
Harry could hear everything that Draco said to him. He wanted to reply, but he couldn't, his body wouldn't let him. What had happened? Why was he in an uncomfortable bed with Draco by his side telling him to wake up? What in the name of Merlin was going on?
I started writing this on Wattpad a couple of years ago but I can’t get back onto my account eek so I’ll be posting it on here :)
"Yes, I'd do anything for you, to prove to you I would never hurt you." Draco held his breath awaiting a response. "I'm sorry, Draco. I can't. Goodbye." Harry smiled sadly. But as he walked past, Draco felt something slip into his hand. He looked down at the small piece of parchment and immediately recognised the thin, scruffy writing.
"If Sirius was guilty, why do you think that in the years he has been free, he hasn't done anything even remotely illegal? The worst thing he did was ignore Dumbledore's orders and accompany me to the train station at the start of my fifth year at Hogwarts!" Harry exclaimed and there were a few hesitant nods of agreement around the room. "Maybe he has just been laying low, not wanting to draw attention to himself- he's been plotting his next move!" Fudge snapped. "You know what, Minister, it's always these crazy lies with you. First with Voldemort and now this?Are they just to make yourself look better because I can assure you, you have always been an incompetent fool!" Harry retorted, sneering. "Watch your mouth boy!" Fudge hissed, reminding Harry of Uncle Vernon, right down to the purple, swollen face.
Harry and Draco set of to their first lesson together, walking in an awkward silence. At once point, Harry could've sworn that their hands brushed together, but it was probably just his imagination. But why would Harry imagine that? He became so confused by one simple thing, that he almost walked completely past their classroom. It was only when Hermione called his name did he realize.
Many times did Harry here crunches and sounds that did not sound right at all. His uncle only seemed for it right to stop when there was blood covering Harry's face. He walked to the door and growled "No food for a month." Before turning around and shutting Harry in his room.
"Here I am." Sirius replied, smiling widely. "Oh. I'll um... I'll see you in class Harry." Draco said awkwardly, then slipped out. "I'm going to be living at Grimmauld, Harry. I'm going to ask Moony if he wants to move in with me and help make the house a little happier. Then we can prepare to finally end Voldemort, once and for all!"
"Mum!" Harry gasped. No words needed to be spoken to show how loved Harry felt in that moment, standing with the family he was always meant to have.
"What?" Draco snapped, immediately poshing up just as he always had to do around family friends. "That is why you've been hanging around them? I'm telling you Draco, he's got you under the imperius, this isn't you! Let me change you back!" Blaise said and grabbed his wand, pointing it harshly at Draco. "You can try all you want, but nothing about me or my feelings towards Harry is going to change," Draco stated calmly, but Blaise still carried on, muttering words in Latin under his breath. Draco felt a couple of jabbing points in places as the spell searched his body, but nothing changed.
Harry woke up suddenly, someone shaking his shoulders. Harry opened his eyes and grabbed his glasses, shoving them on his face. Draco Malfoy stood above him, a worried expression on his face. "It was just a bad dream, don't worry." Malfoy whispered. Harry, still breathing hard, didn't hear him.
"Well, seems as you confessed all this to be, it seems only fair that I tell you. I'm dating Luna," she smiled, and looked as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. Harry smiled at her, glad that he had someone to talk to if things got too overwhelming. "As long as you're happy with her, I'm happy for you."
"Gryffindor are up against Slytherin in two weeks. Are you still the seeker for your house?" Harry asked, and Draco nodded. "Me against you again Potter. Don't worry, I'll go easy on you," he winked. "Easy? On me?" Harry laughed. "That is real cute Malfoy, you can give me all you got but it still won't be enough!" "Oh, really?" Draco grinned cheekily and pinned Harry against the tree.
" Through sixth year, he became more and more unhealthy and thin and in the end, just wouldn't eat because he felt too sick. We thought it was because his father had died that summer, but it lasted throughout the whole year. He started to use glamours to hide himself, but that didn't go unnoticed by us. He stopped coming down to meals and either said he had already been or was going to go later."
Harry paired up with Hermione whilst Ron went with Seamus. They went to get their ingredients, and Harry prepared them whilst Hermione brewed.

"I think I can help with that," Harry grinned. "I've heard that Hannah Abbot has a thing for you Neville and as far as I'm aware she doesn't have a date yet. You might want to find her quickly!" Harry called as Neville ran out. "Thank you Harry, for everything," Ginny smiled as she shut the door to Neville's room, leaving Luna to continue getting ready. They went back into Harry's dorm and briefly explained what happened. "See, that's my date, right there! Helping others when he won't even help himself."
The next morning, Harry and Draco walked down to breakfast separately and sat on opposite ends of the table. Barton was sat with the rest of the teachers, a taunting smile set on his face.
Draco placed a kiss on the other boys forehead, a couple of tears dripping onto Harry's face. As Draco wiped them away he sniffled. "You said you were happy, Potter. And I was dumb enough to believe you. How could you be happy with me?"
That's when a thought popped into his head. "Ron?" He asked, looking at the red headed boy who was currently shoving egg into his mouth. "Yeah?" He muffled, not even bothering to wait until he had finished his mouthful. "What do the ministry do to gay wizards?"
"Harry!" Harry was rattled out of his train of thoughts by Sirius shouting at him. "It was my fault you died," Harry whispered, involuntary tears escaping his eyes. "I'm not dead, Harry." Sirius smiled warmly and Harry nodded numbly.
Draco couldn't help but smile warmly as the raven haired boy plopped down next to him with his guitar in hand. "This!" Harry shouted in an introductive voice. "is a song myself, Harry James Potter, wrote in fifth year about a certain someone who I thought would never return the feelings."

"What the bloody hell was that?" Ron asked, eyes round as saucers, quite frankly freaked the fuck out that his best friend growled at him. Harry's heart had become a size bigger, and noticeably redder. Harry beamed, and Draco saw too as he pecked Harry on the lips, smiling.
Ignoring what McGonogall said, Sirius went on happily. "You all thought that my dear cousin, Bellatrix, struck me with the killing curse, but actually, it missed. At the same time she cast her spell, another death eater behind us struck me with the crucio. He knocked me into the veil, which was some sort of archway into the after life."
"Look at you going all father-mode on me," Harry grinned. "I guess you could say I'm being a a good DOGfather! Get it? Dog, God, it's a play on words!" Sirius laughed, but Harry just stood there, shaking his head. "Your humour has died old man," Harry smirked and held in a laugh as Sirius put his hand to his heart in mock offense, but then he grinned.
Harry attempted to cover himself up, but his arms were only knocked away by Draco who was still dabbing him with the wet sponge. Harry sat up, his head spinning but still leaning against Draco.
"You alright son?" James asked, watching Harry closely. "Yeah," Harry nodded. "You know, basically ever adult I have ever had an encounter with have said that I look much like you, but with mum's eyes,"

Harry changed himself back, washing away all glamours then put his hands gently on Draco's shoulders. Draco whipped around then looked at Harry, his face red and tear-stained. Harry threw his arms around Draco, soothingly stroking his hair.
"Sirius? Sirius!" Harry gasped, holding onto the bed post as he slid onto the floor. And image showed on the mirror which didn't show Harry's reflection, but his Godfather's face which was of complete shock. "Harry! What is it, are you okay?" Sirius said. "I- I- I can't!" Harry gasped again, choking on his own breath. The mirrors edges started to dig into his palms, drawing blood.
"You have the kindest heart, Harry James Potter. I'm so proud of you, even if your pain set you off track a bit, you have a bright future ahead of you-" the door opened and James Potter drifted through the wall beside it. "Mrs Lily Potter, you're next." The guard said in a dull voice and so she gave Harry one last smile before disappearing through the door.
"We just didn't share the same magic anymore. His choices were wrong and he wasn't the same Ron I fell in love with from the start. If he could learn to change and accept, then maybe I would take him back. Maybe." She sniffled, wiping her eyes. "I'm sorry Mione," Harry smiled sadly, sending her a grateful look too for not saying what actually happened.
"My sweet, why are you crying?" He asked, brushing away the tears. "I'm so happy things ended up like this. Sirius is alive, he's here and he is a free man! That's all I dreamed it to be since I found out he was my godfather and the truth about that night years ago. I finally have somebody I can look to as a father and do things a father and son might do. And of course, I have you, my sweet, beautiful soulmate. I couldn't be any more content in this moment," Harry sniffled, smiling up at Draco with a shine in his eyes that let said boy know that this was the truth.
Draco clutched Harry's face, never wanting to let go and Harry ran his fingers through Draco's still silky hair, smiling into the kiss. "Okay, that's enough now! We get it, you're soulmates," Ron said, and Harry pulled away from Draco, who whimpered at the loss, but then remembered he was in the presence of other people and scrambled off of Harry's lap.
"Don't you ever do something so ridiculously stupid again!" He whispered quickly, wetting Harry's shoulder with his tears. "Why did you never tell me? About Lily's idiot sister and her fucking stupid family!" Sirius spat, his voice hoarse.
"I saw James and Lily, Harry. Your Mum and Dad. They are so proud of you. They wouldn't tell me anything, but they've been watching you your whole life. They truly have always been with you, even if you can't see them. They told me to tell you 'It'll all get better in the end and they will always love you, no matter who or what you are or who you fall in love with'. Haven't the faintest idea what they were on about but-"
"Weasley, Potter, stop talking else you'll spend your Saturday here with me." Barton snapped. Ron stopped talking, not wanting to ruin his weekend with Hermione. The lessons for the day flew by, and soon enough Ron and Harry were sitting in the empty common room, whilst most of their peer's had one more lesson to go.
"You're disgusting!" A female voice suddenly came from the crowd. Fudge grinned maliciously. "See? No matter how many spiteful words you spit out of your faggoty, boy-loving mouth, everyone will still agree with me, even your classmates," Fudge sneered. The ministry works started to move towards Harry but the female voice came again. "Not Harry! You! You really think that you can lock someone up because they love somebody different to what you and your old fashioned asses want?"
"No, no, no! Not at all! But um, I think you need to know everything that's happened since you were gone." Sirius nodded and they both sat down. "Sixth year, Draco was forced to become a death eater. And his task was to kill Dumbledore. That whole year I was having private lessons and it turns out that Voldemort had seven horecruxes- the diary I destroyed in my second year, Marvolo Gaunts ring, Slytherins locket, Hufflepuffs cup, Ravenclaws diadem, Voldemorts snake Nagini, and the accidental one. Me."
"He's still a bit drunk. Mostly woozy hangover though," Draco chuckled. Hermione came in, sauntering towards them and rubbing her temples. "I have the worst hangover!" She groaned, plopping down.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco holding him. "You aren't allowed to do that!" He snapped helping Harry stand up. "Because you interrupted my demonstration, you will become my demonstration. Crucio!" Barton yelled again, this time the curse hitting Draco.
"You didn't need a whole lot of convincing, we just had to build a fort together!" Draco laughed, then realized he had said that in front of other people and stopped chuckling immediately. Ron and Hermione just blinked at them, completely confused. "You really forgive too easy Harry." Hermione said, smiling slightly. "One thing I learned from the war, is that life's too short to hold a grudge. I think Draco realised that too and that's why he apologised to me on the train." Harry nodded and Draco blushed- Harry was exposing his nice side to everybody!
Harry slowly tried to open his eyes, but then shut them again quickly when light blinded him. Instead, he tried to move his fingers and his toes. All of him ached, every little bit hurt.
"I'm really sorry Harry! I didn't know that would happen," Draco said, watching Harry get up and take a drink from the tap. "Well, well. Look what we have here. You two in the same bathroom again. No duelling this time please!" A high pitched voice came from one of the cubicles. The two boys turned around and saw Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts the girls toilets on the second floor.
"Master Harry! What is it Kreacher can do for you today? Some roast chicken? Steak and kidney pie? Catch any thieves?" The small, old house elf smiled, following Sirius into the room and bowing down to Harry. "Just take care of Sirius, yeah? When he gets back?" Harry smiled. "Of course, master Harry Potter, an honour it is! I is wondering where Dobby is being? Kreacher has not heard from Dobby in a while and Dobby is being Kreacher's friend," Kreacher said cautiously, and Harry felt his stomach drop and his heart break a little at the question. "Dobby's gone, Kreacher. He isn't coming back." Draco said softly, pulling Harry a little bit closer to him and raking a hand through his hair.
"Uh, Harry, Ron and I have to go to the prefects carriage. Will you be okay here alone?" Hermione asked. Harry wanted to yell at her, of course he wasn't going to be okay alone, he never was and never will be! But of course, he just nodded again. "We'll be back as soon as we can." And with that, they left. Harry was by himself... again.
"Okay!" Harry said, blushing and got up ignoring questioning looks from Hermione. He headed to the Gryffindor table and grabbed Ginny up by the hand. "Sirius wants to say hi. He thinks we're dating." Harry whispered hurriedly as Ginny nodded.
Harry couldn't stop staring at himself. He wanted to look away, but he couldn't. Harry knew he needed to start taking more care of himself, just sometimes he didn't think that he was worth the effort. Most of the bruises had faded, leaving his skin looking bare. "You're looking better now," Draco said, stepping up to the next sink. "My skin just looks naked without all the marks and scars," Harry laughed slightly. "So, whoever did it, you've known for a lot of your life?" Draco asked.
The months came and left very slowly. After a month of living with the Dursley's, Harry was allowed to eat again but, he had eaten merely one green apple before Uncle Vernon came up with another reason to beat Harry up and not let him eat again.
Thoughts of guilt and pain intruded Harry's mind, and he quickly ran into his dorm room before he made a fool of himself in front of everyone else. He had hoped Draco would be in there, but no such luck. Harry tried to control his breathing, digging through his things for something. At last, at the very bottom of his trunk, he found the shard of mirror that was connected to another.
"Did you, Sirius Oreon Black, murder thirteen persons after betraying James and Lily Potter by selling them out to the Dark Lord?" Fudge asked, an evil twinkle in his eyes. "No, I did not. That was in fact Peter Pettigrew, who is now also dead by his own hand." Sirius replied solemnly.
Suddenly, he got up again. "It's your fault!" Fred screeched, pointing a finger at Harry. "Your fault I'm gone! Your fault I had to leave Georgie! You should've stayed dead!"
For now, Draco just wanted to sit and look at the stars, admiring the beauty of the natural world in peace. But, he could not be in peace without Harry there beside him. Not knowing where Harry was was like a nightmare come true. "What the hell has happened to me?" He muttered, thinking about how he used to be, trying to impress all of his Slytherin gang, holding up the image his Father had told him to.
When the dementor disappeared. Harry's eyes flew open and he saw... A stag? The Dementors had all been cleared away as questions roamed through Harry's head. Dad? Has he come back too?
Harry smiled and looked up into those grey eyes he had always longed for, even if he didn't know it. "I do love you too, Draco. And I don't want to lose you now. I want to get better, I need to get better. And if you don't want to help me, I understand,"
"I have something else to admit. I'm seeing someone- I'm not going to say who just yet, but we have the encanta bond." Sirius fell off his seat. "You and Malfoy have the encanta bond?"
"I was expelled mid-way through my fourth year at school and was so embarrassed that I wiped everyone's memories of me ever being there, destroyed all files. I was a Slytherin, best friends with Bellatrix Black. I was expelled because Bella wanted to do something dark and stupid and I was dragged into it, then the blame was placed on me when it backfired. I was expelled and my hatred for the wizarding world grew and it has still been growing ever since."
Pansy strolled up to Draco, acting as if she were the most important thing in the world and took Draco's face in her hands and kissed him. Draco did as he was told and complied to the kiss, no matter how disgusting it felt. He heard Harry's footsteps take off hurriedly, but he was told not to care. Potter didn't mean a thing to him, anymore.
Harry sniffled, wiping his eyes and Draco held Harry's hand behind his back, going unnoticed by George. "From then on, it turned into more and more. Breaking too many bones, slaving away for them, getting my food supply cut off for a month at a time. They always found a different way to punish me. Hogwarts was my escape, until the war that is. After the war, my depression consumed me and I had to go back to live with the Dursley's,"
"Harry, darling, can I speak with you please?" Mrs Weasley asked, pulling Harry out of his thoughts about a certain blonde boy who was missing out on the cheer and fun. "Oh, uh, sure!" He smiled and Mrs Weasley pulled up a cheer. "How have you been doing?" Harry asked politely, getting nervous around the woman who recently lost a child due to his mistakes. "I'm alright, my dear. I actually wanted to ask you about something said during the trial, it's been pulling at my hair," she frowned. "It was said that you are... gay?"
"Now, what horrific costumes are we going to have to wear?" Draco sighed. Well, when I'm with Ginny I'll just throw on a cape and give myself some fake fangs, I have to make sure I'm recognisable as myself. Then when, we're together, we need to be un-recognisable," Harry nodded. He then took his wand out an pointed it at Draco's face.
"How? I've started eating lunch again!" Harry complained. "And what do you eat for lunch, Mr Potter?" She prompted, as if holding such information was very valuable to her. "Quarter of a sandwich." Harry muttered. "What? Any more and I would just throw it all back up, wouldn't you rather I kept it down?" Sirius rolled his eyes and muttered in an annoyed tone "Just like your father."
"Fine. Dare." Draco smiled. "Oohh! Look at my brave little dragon! I have the perfect dare for you. Kiss me!" Harry giggled, jumping into Draco's lap and throwing his arms around the blonde boys neck. Draco rolled his eyes and grinned. "If you wanted to snog me so much you could've just asked. I would've been happy to oblige,"
Harry and Ginny headed up and sat down on her bed. "So," she said. "What did you want to talk to me about?" Harry took a deep breath and just thought about Draco. "I'm gay." He said plainly, holding his breath, waiting for her reaction. Ginny just stared at him, not knowing what to say or do.
The lesson dragged on very slowly, copying notes down from the board and re visiting spells and creatures they have looked at in the past so Barton knew what level they were up to. The bell finally rung after what felt like forever, and the Gryffindors headed down to Care of magical creatures whilst the Slytherins went to charms. Hagrid was still their teacher, and was delighted when Harry, Ron and Hermione came trudging down.
The students all filed into the classroom and chose their seats. Harry quickly sat at the far back corner, not wanting to have a spotlight cast on him this year. But, none the less, the new teacher walked in and immediately requested that Harry come and sit at the front of the room. "Can't have our brightest student be hiding in the back now, can we?" The new professor smiled. Harry sat down in his seat between Ron and Draco and sunk down.
"Actually, as per usual, Granger is right," A voice came from the doorway. The trio looked around and saw no other than Draco Malfoy at the door. "What are you doing here?" Ron snarled. "Your door was open genius. I came over to close it. Nobody in the common room wants to hear about Potter and the Weaslette's relationship," Draco said, rolling his eyes. Harry's eyes widened and he rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
"I'm sorry, Mr Potter, you are going to have to make your way to second lesson if you want to pass your newts. You've already missed enough for the while you were in the hospital and with the Christmas holidays coming up, you can't afford to miss more." Harry smiled and picked up his bag.

"I was meant to die seventeen years ago on this night. If I had, maybe my parents would still be here. Everyone would still be here. My death is long overdue," Harry trembled and turned his head around slowly. Draco was standing not too far away from Harry on the balcony and Hermione was sobbing into Ginny's arms inside. Ginny had a look of shock torn across her face as well as tears dropping one by one into Hermione's hair.
Understanding covering the others face as he never pushed for more information. Instead, the pair stood frozen, staring at each other. Harry couldn’t take it any longer, he looked away, and tried to break the tension, “I err, I’ll take these,” he stuttered, grabbing the bags at Malfoy’s feet and heading towards the dining room, praying his shaking wasn’t as viable as he thought it was. The dark mark and meaning behind it wasn’t an area he had thought about recently. He hadn’t realised how much it would affect him, or the ideas it would bring up. He knew he had to address it, especially if Malfoy was staying around. He realised this was something that would keep happening the longer they worked together. He mentally decided that would be the topic of his next therapy session.
Harry, Draco and Sirius pushed through the crowd and down to the department of mysteries and into a trial room. It was the same room where the Lestranges had been ordered to Azkaban and Harry had narrowly escaped expulsion from Hogwarts in his fifth year.
Halloween was coming up quickly and Harry still hadn't found a date to the party. He really wanted to ask Draco, but he knew he couldn't. He'd have to find a girl to ask, because apparently it's mandatory that you have a date.
Whilst running, Skeeter had shrunk the camera so it was miniscule and with a pop was a beetle, scurrying away. Harry fell to the ground, choking in fear for what might happen next. Not only do they now have more proof, but the likely-hood was that Draco's face could be distinguishable in that photo.
The air exploded. "No- no- no!" Someone was shouting "No! Fred! no!" And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred's eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.
They danced to a couple of songs, before departing from the crowd, greeting various people together along the way and headed to the bathrooms where they split up to change.
"That'd be perfect Harry, thank you. You won't tell Ron, will you? He's very- uh, you know," Harry just nodded. "I don't understand. We were all brought up learning to support the LGBT community. Something went wrong with him somewhere." She said, shaking her head.
Draco stood at the sink next to Harry, drenching his hair with water, then blow drying and styling it. Harry stared at Draco, his childhood enemy since his first day at Hogwarts and was suddenly jealous of him. Draco's part in the war was just as bad as Harry's was. He was forced to become a death eater, death threats every day, yet he managed to keep control of himself and not ruin his body like Harry had. "Take a picture, it'll last longer," Draco smirked. "Sorry. Draco?" Harry asked. Draco looked at Harry, eyebrow raised.
"We found the diadem, and destroyed the two horecruxes which we thought just left Nagini. Voldemort tried to kill me again but it didn't work, just got rid of the part of his soul that was inside me. Neville killed Nagini and we defeated Voldemort. Ron and Hermione became a couple!" He grinned, for a brief moment forgetting the fight that had taken place between the two boys.
Harry could hear his heart best louder and louder in his chest. He could never be happy. What was he thinking? No one would ever accept him as he was. Everyone, if they haven't already, will abandon him. Harry's thoughts raced around in his head and he shakily got up and made his way to the balcony, the other two boys not noticing him.

Harry glared at Draco, but Draco just shot him back an 'it was for your own good' look. "I'll leave you two to catch up, I'm sure, Mr Malfoy that you can explain everything. You have an extremely loyal friend Potter, even if you haven't always seen eye to eye. He hasn't left this room once since you arrived." She smiled gently and walked away.
"I just wanted to say, I wish that you died when you 'fell off your broom'. Faggots don't deserve to live," he spat. "Now come on, Hermione, I don't want to be here anymore." Hermione then punched Ron square in the nose.
Hermione ran out of the castle, looking around quickly before seeing Harry on the ground and Draco running up not too far behind. "Harry!" She yelled and he looked up. She ran to them and shoved one single page from a newspaper in Harry's face.
"Hey, don't cry. When you cry I can't see your beautiful eyes," Draco whispered, removing Harry's glasses and wiping his tears. "Come on, else we're going to be late." Harry sniffled once more and then stepped into the large fireplace. "It's the first time he's shown thoughts like that in a while," he heard Draco murmur to Sirius. "Maybe it was the run-in with the Dursley's? Or having to deal with two trials in one day?" Sirius said quietly back to Draco. "I'm fine, now let's go, Ministry of Magic!" Harry shouted and felt that horrible lurch in the bottom of his stomach as he zoomed through the fireplaces.
But Anthony's words always echoed in his head and he was brought back to the real life where what was illegal, was illegal. But when had Ron ever actually listened to the rules? He and his friends had broken pretty much every single school rule there was and he didn't as much bat an eyelid.
But that was a lie. His heart still spread up when Draco walked into the room. His heart still skipped a beat when he thought about them kissing and had to resist the urge of just jumping onto the blonde.
"Harry, why were you actually in the hospital?" George said, almost putting two and two together. Harry stayed silent once more, but his eyes drifted over to the balcony. George looked over to see what was there, but with the view being clear he just became more confused.
"I, too, don't think that Mr Harry Potter should go to Azkaban!" A squeaky voiced woman with long blonde hair and a mousy face cried. "Send him a mind healer!" One by one, most of Fudge's employees were stood, rebelling against his desicion. Harry grinned smugly up at the minister as he felt his heart rate start to increase.
"Harry, it's okay, calm down," Sirius said, pushing past Draco and hugging Harry tight. "You mean... He's innocent?" Draco asked, finally lowering his wand. "He's the only family I have left. He was my father's best friend," Harry smiled. "I thought he was gone, I thought he was killed. But, here he his!"
"Concentrate. Focus on only your happiest memory." Harry said calmly. "Expecto Patronum!" Draco shouted, but still no animal formation appeared. Draco looked disappointed but Harry just smiled at him. "It's okay. We'll keep on trying, I never expected you to do it first try. Plus, we're drunk!" He giggled and threw himself onto his bed. He patted the space next to him and Draco lay down next to him.

Harry looked back down at the ground and didn't say a word. "Harry?" George said. "I'm sorry, it's all my fault!" Harry whispered. "What?" George said, confused. "It's all my fault," Harry repeated.
"Darkness. Really catches your attention, doesn't it? Enlightens your senses. But sometimes, all we need is a little bit of light." A voice spoke, and the room was lit up by a thousand small, floating candles and presented what seemed to be a meadow with a picnic blanket set up not too far ahead.
Ron's ears turned pink and so did Hermione's cheeks as they both looked down. Harry had never saw this coming. He was happy for the two of them, sort of. But now, he would always be the third wheel. That's if he and Ron ever made up. "What ab'out you 'arry? Any girls spotting your eye? Heard one time you was getting close to Ginny Weasley!" Ron looked at Harry cautiously, wanting to protect his sister if Harry said anything wrong.
They would never let Draco off the hook, he was a Malfoy, son of Lucius who served and escaped from Azkaban, who had the dark mark burnt into his skin. Harry only hoped that he could find a way to get his boyfriend out of it.
"Wake up you little bastard!" Came the booming voice of Uncle Vernon through Harry's bedroom door. "Get up and make us breakfast!" Harry slowly got up and listened to Vernon's loud, stomping steps die away. He pulled off his pyjama top and looked at himself in the mirror.
"We're so sorry we haven't written Harry, we really wanted to, just..." Hermione started. "You reminded us of the war a bit. You understand, right?" Ron finished. Harry just nodded. He didn't have any energy to argue. His whole body ached, and it felt like he had a cracked rib. That, and he hadn't muttered a word in almost 4 months.
They didn't speak to each other for the rest of the night, nor had they spoken a word the morning that followed. How could they have been so foolish? And they had left Barton with the tape!
"I think it was pretty self explanatory when he was on top of you sucking your face off like a bloody dementor," Ron hissed, his ears and face redder than Harry had ever seen before. Ron started laughing to himself, shaking his head as he paced around the room. "I can't believe it. You, a faggot! Why can't you just be normal?" He exclaimed, practically spitting in Harry's face.
"I'd tell you to get out of my life. Kill yourself. I wouldn't even want to look at you, mate. They make me sick right down to my stomach. Like, why can't they just be normal?" Harry's insides felt like they had just shrivelled up and disintegrated whilst riding on a rollercoaster.
Harry read the article in a stunned silence, unable to find his breath. There was no way in hell he would be able to win that trial now, there was far too much evidence against him. Harry's eyes scanned over the whole article and found there was no mention of Draco's name. He breathed out a sigh of relief then looked up at Hermione who was staring at him as if he might just collapse into the ground at the news. But, on the contrary, he was surprisingly calm.
Hermione and Ginny slipped into the room, being quiet in case Harry was sleeping. But when they arrived, they saw the two boys lip locked. Ginny smirked at Hermione and Hermione grinned deviously. They tip toed closer to the boys then started making cooey and smoochey sounds.
"You." Draco smiled. Harry blushed and looked to his side at Draco who was staring right back. The blonde boy sat up and Harry followed these actions. "I have something I need to tell you." Draco said firmly, and Harry immediately started to worry, worst case scenarios playing through his head.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
Harry leapt up and let out a throaty, animal growl but Draco held up his hand, making Harry sit down again, but still glaring. "Oh look Malfoy. Got yourself a boyfriend!" She cackled. "Something that you'll never have." Harry retorted, and she stomped away.
The sky darkened and the room was lit by only a few candles and the moon and stars. Harry and Draco sat down on the blanket and Draco took out some sandwiches and wine. "This is my favourite!" Harry grinned, his eyes on the bottle. "I know, that's why I got it!" Draco laughed huskily.
"He's been abused by the muggles his whole life. They starved him and now he just doesn't eat at all. He blames himself for the war and all the people we lost. Mix that with a giant secret and a really bad fight with his 'best friend' I suppose it got too much for him," he sighed, sitting in the chair next to his raven haired party date.
"We didn't come back to school for seventh year. Ron, Hermione and I went on a hunt for horecruxes. But before that, in the summer, Bill and Fleur got married and Mad eye died. George lost an ear as well." Sirius raised his eyebrows in Harry's casual tone in his almost-brother losing an ear. "We joke about it!" He shrugged.
Draco came back from Hogsmeade late in the afternoon, slightly worried about Harry. He had been alone all day and the past weeks hadn't been good for him or his health. He was about to open the door to room number seven, when he heard voices.
"Hello, I am Draco Malfoy, your sons bo- friend. Your sons friend." Draco smiled, gathering up the Malfoy politeness he could not escape. "Hello to you too, Draco Malfoy- my sons boyfriend." Mrs Potter grinned.
George got up and engulfed Harry in a massive bear hug. "I'm so sorry Harry, I should've saw the signs, I should have known. I'm sorry I never wrote to you after the war its just-" George's eyes filled with tears.
"Let's go and ask Harry then, he'll know, he'll prove me right! I've never seen either of you before in my life!" Ron growled, now getting angry. "Oh, so you and him are suddenly just best friends again? After what you did..." Draco growled, the anger clearly not fake.
"So you confess?" Fudge said, clearly surprised that it was as simple as that. "Yep. And I'm not ashamed either! Neither should anyone else who are hiding who they truly are on the inside, it isn't fair! Why don't we get to be with who we love and you do? " These words were repeated in a Ministry courtroom at nine o'clock in the morning, the following Saturday.
"How did you know?" Harry asked, sitting on the other boys bed next to him. "It was kind of just a feeling, you know. My Father tried to make an arranged marriage for me and this girl from Ravenclaw. I didn't like her that way, or any other girl. But I started looking at this one boy in a different light," he shrugged.
"Fine, deal with grief in your own way Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes. "You not saying a thing isn't going to bring anyone back." He said and with that, he walked out. Who was Harry kidding. Malfoy wasn't showing concern for him. No one is. He'd just have to deal with it himself.
They headed back to eighth year tower and sat down in the common room. Crookshanks came padding out of Ron and Hermione's room and sat down, purring on Sirius's lap. They always did seem to have some type of weird connection.
"Oh my gosh," Harry gasped as Draco stepped out from behind a tree. "Did you do all this?" He asked, looking around. "Not even any help from the House Elves." Draco grinned.
"Mr Potter, if you would please come to my office. It's urgent!" She said, trying to hide a smile. She looked flustered and sweaty as if she had been running. Harry left his friends and followed the Headmistress to her office and when she opened the door, Harry almost fainted at the sight.
Draco started to get his own breakfast when Pansy Parkinson stomped over, red in the face. "Draco Malfoy! I can't believe you! First you start hanging out with these Gryffin-dorks, then you don't ask me to the party and never show up and now you have hickeys all down your fucking neck and they sure as hell weren't made by me!" She screeched, making them all groan and rub their heads.
"Let's go sit down," he said softly, taking the blonde boys hand and leading him towards their bedroom where they sat down on Harry's bed. "As long as I'm here with you, you're not going anywhere," Harry said confidently. "I will do everything in my power to protect you even if it kills me." He whispered.
"But that's hardly fair. I get to share my problems with you but you can't share yours with me? We're meant to be in this together Draco, why can't you see that?" Harry sighed heavily. "Because my main priority at the moment is you! I'm not going to stop helping you until that heart on your wrist is red and even then I'm not going to stop caring for you!" Draco smiled seriously.
Some students went back home with their families, but most went back on the train, Harry was one of those. The Weasley's offered to bring Harry back to the burrow, but he couldn't stand it. So, he just shook his head and ran off without a word. The Dursley's would want him back anyway. Without Harry, who would cook their dinners and clean up the house? Who would they pummel and beat until they were happy? The Weasley family and Hermione watched as Harry got onto the train without saying another word.
And what did he do best? Pretend that nothing bad had ever happened and carry on with life. And carry on with life he would, even though he was already dead on the inside.

"Really? I knew we had a cat, but I didn't know it was him." He admitted. "So where is everyone? Hermione, Draco? Heard you made up with Ron as well. How are things?" Harry nodded and sighed. "Ron and I are working on it. I think he thinks we've completely made up, but I'm still keeping an eye on him and I'm pretty sure Hermione is too. What he did was absolutely horrible. Everyone is in Hogsmeade, but I didn't feel like going."
"It's alright. It's okay! You're Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world, I'd like to see Fudge try to put you in Azkaban!" He chortled. "Hermione said that too, but I'm not so sure. We'll see in the trial anyway. The argument with Ron was just him being a homophobic little shit. He... he prompted me to kill myself and gave me the last metaphorical push. He then shoved a blade in my hand and told me to... you know, 'finish the job'."
There was still a faint glamour on Harry's arms, as Draco saw once again some blood drip from Harry's head onto his forearm and it disappeared. Draco got out his wand and almost collapsed right then and there on the spot.
"Crookshanks was your parents cat before they died. You used to chase him around on your toy broomstick and he loved it, though didn't show it. We shared a bond as cat and dog and we used to have some form of a conversation whenever I came around- which was quite often. Strange Hermione picked him of all animals in the shop." Sirius nodded.
"Woah, Potter, please, I actually like my face," Draco smirked. Harry rolled his eyes and started using simple transfiguration skills to change Draco's features. Once he was done, Malfoy no longer looked like Malfoy. Instead he had dark purple hair, twisted into loose curls, reaching his shoulders. His face was more heart shaped than pointed and had freckles scattered all over his face. His eyes were a light, chestnut brown. He didn't look like Draco at all.
Pomfrey gave each of them a whole bar of chocolate and while Sirius gobbled his greedily, Harry set his on the table to his side. The two adults in the room both noticed this, and started screaming at him. "You haven't been in once for a checkup, not one! You've never had one of your potions and your looking thinner and more deadly by the day!" Pomfrey shouted.
Sirius was sitting in front of the unlit fireplace, in an unusually empty common room for a Saturday. "They all fled when they saw me. Only Neville stayed and told me you'd be here in a bit then headed down to the greenhouses with that nice girl Hannah Abbot. I was in school with her mum, she fancied me a lot." Sirius grinned, clearly proud of his achievement of wooing girls.
Harry strolled up to Fudge with an alarmingly dangerous expression on his face. "Draco Malfoy is my friend. He never 'plotted to kill me', that was Voldemort if you haven't forgotten already, Draco was there by force of his father, who by the way, you have done so little to catch since he escaped. So how about you stop holding a grudge against a teenage boy who saved your fucking ass and do something useful with your miserable life. You shouldn't even be Minister of Magic, who even allowed you to take that role after Scrimgeour died and the death eaters took over?" Harry spat. He felt a hand on his back and turned around to see Draco looking at him, his face half prideful and half shocked. "You really would have done great in Slytherin." He whispered.
"Woah, Harry, slow down!" Draco laughed. "My middle name is, unfortunately, Lucius. My favourite spell is the summoning charm. My birthday is 5th June. If you really need to know, Harry I've never... You know, with a boy but I have with girls. And I've never been able to cast a patronus. Growing up with my Father, I didn't have too many happy memories," he admitted sheepishly.
Days had surely passed by now, Harry felt like he had been laying in bed for ages. 'It's time to get up' Harry thought. 'Please, let me get up and I promise I'll try. I want to live, please just let me go to Draco! I think I'm falling in love with him'
Harry showed Draco his wrist and he knew that the last slither of hope for this boy had disappeared. As well as some obvious fresh scars on his arm, the little heart was completely black and wasn't beating at all.
Harry found out that Slughorn was hosting the party and it was strictly boy-girl. Harry knew what he had to do, even if he didn't want to do it. So, during breakfast he dragged himself over to the Gryffindor table and pulled Ginny to the side.
"You do know you never told me what Ron did," Sirius said. "I can't exactly tell you. Not without telling you some other things which I'm not exactly ready to share yet. It could get me in serious trouble."
Hermione took a whiff of their potion and smiled, turning slightly pink. "What is it?" Harry asked. "I- um, I smell Ron," she blushed, and turned to Ron who's ears had turned pink. "And fresh parchment." Hermione giggled, shrugging her shoulders. "Ah, young love. And you, Harry?" Slughorn asked.
Food appeared along every table and Harry watched as everyone started to pile their plates up. Harry himself, just took a piece of bread and slowly picked crumbs off of it. Hermione and Ron looked at him with just his bread and shared curious glances. "Is that all your going to eat mate? You do know this is never going to run out, right?" Ron chuckled. Harry just nodded, put the bread back on his plate and drank a couple of cups of water.
But despite the feeling of dread concurring in his stomach, he couldn't help but feel pure glee as he walked into the dungeons. "What's got your smile plastered on so big?" Hermione asked. "Later." Harry whispered as Professor Slughorn started talking.
Screw those muggles and fuck that Weasel. Ron was meant to be Harry's best friend, but now he's done this. Draco tried to whisper things to Harry that would sooth his mind and make him come back over the railing.
"I knew that he was no good for you Harry." He said matter-of-factly. "Yeah, well, now you have no reason to hate me,"
"Remus and I made a bet whether or not you would end up with her. I said yes, seems as your father had a thing for red heads too, but Remus said no as apparently you had a thing for Miss Cho Chang then. He owes me five galleons the idiot!" Sirius laughed, crying slightly.
"I'm not in the mood for games anymore, Malfoy." Harry said quietly. "No, Harry you have to believe me, I was cursed, it wasn't me who said all those horrid things, it was Pansy inside my head!" He pleaded, reaching out for Harry's hand.
"Okay," she said slowly. "And your telling me this now, why?" Harry let his breath go. "The party. There's a, uh, boy that I want to go with and he said he would go with me too, and I might actually have a chance with him now." He replied. Ginny nodded, taking it all in.
"It's alright, George. He's been helping with through all this, the whole lot," Harry smiled. "I was shocked too when he said he wanted to help," Harry chuckled looking at the expression on George's face, but then it turned to a serious one.
"I stopped eating. I let them abuse me with no fight, nobody was talking to me and I wasn't talking to anyone. The guilt was always nagging at me, I blamed myself for the war, for the deaths and I just didn't care about myself anymore. All this and harbouring a secret that I'm too afraid to tell-"
"Uh... Harry?" Hermione said. "What?" He snapped. He couldn't be bothered to put up with another lecture about how he needed to eat more. "You growled Harry. As in, an animal growl!" Harry thought back for a moment, and realised that he had done exactly that!
Ginny told Hermione and Draco about Luna and her dating her, and the situation with Neville. "But, it's not like Harry and me, you see. Neville actually thinks that him and Luna are dating so he asked her to the party and she said yes. I'm afraid that Luna is going to eventually break up with me for him. The Ravenclaw common room was destroyed and they haven't finished repairing it yet so they're meant to be bunking with us but Luna seems to be spending more nights here than with me," Ginny said as Hermione hugged her.
"Actually, you don't have the 'right to know' if I wanted to keep it from you my whole life, then I would have!" Draco stuck his tongue out at Ron and Ron made a stupid face at Draco. "Don't forget, Weasley is our king!" Draco snapped, smirking none the less. "Oi, you stop and Ron, be nice." Harry scolded.
Draco walked away and got into his own bed. "Draco? Do you support gay wizards?" Harry asked, hoping that Malfoy would say yes. "I do, actually. Wanted to rebel against my father once, so I believed In the opposite of everything he believed in. I learnt to accept all witches and wizards alike." He yawned. "Draco?" Harry asked cautiously. "Yes, Potter?"
At this point, Draco walked into the room and stopped at the scene, looking from George Weasley looking panicked and out of place to Harry, now lying on the floor having a panic attack. Draco ran into the bathroom and grabbed a cold, wet sponge and ran back out to Harry.
Without thinking, Harry ran and threw his arms around him, not wanting to let go, to lose him again. "How!" Harry gasped. "I'll leave you two alone." McGonogall smiled. "Oh, Harry. He's only just got here. Fumbled through my fireplace. He doesn't know what's happened the years he's been gone. I would explain, but I think it's best that you do." She nodded and walked out, closing the door.
It was Sirius's turn to roll his eyes. "I just want to make sure that you're safe, Harry. I don't want to end up alone." Harry shifted awkwardly in his seat, knowing what his Godfather was thinking about.
There was a half complete fort in the middle of the room and a shirtless Draco gathering up blankets and pillows. "Having fun?" Harry scoffed and Draco dropped everything he was holding. "I never got to do it as a kid," He muttered, picking things up again. "Neither did I, mind if I help?" Harry grinned and Draco smirked. "Sure!"
"Hangover effects? I did drink probably more than all of you combined," he chuckled awkwardly. Harry got a few feeble nods but Hermione still stared at him suspiciously. "So, anyone going to say anything about the hickeys, or..." Dean smirked. "I completed my dare," Harry shrugged lightly, whilst Draco pulled up his collar. He pulled out his wand, about to cast a glamour when Harry stopped him.
The boys were both looking into each others eyes, studying their faces, not knowing that they were both leaning in until their lips connected. Harry sat up properly, and put his hands behind Draco's neck, pulling him in further, then Draco sat on Harry's lap, legs either side of his waist.
"Hermione breathe!" Harry laughed. "And also, that wasn't my patronus. It was Draco's." Hermione stared at Harry, blinked, then got up and ran out the portrait hole. "Mental!" Harry muttered to himself, alone now. He so badly wanted to call to his parents and ask them to come and just stay with him for a while, but he knew they couldn't be there all the time.
"Hello, Draco." The man said stiffly, and what Draco saw made him gasp. Sure, they all said Harry looked like him but he never knew they were so similar! "Um, Draco, meet my Mum and Dad. They're just here for a little bit because I got lonely and bored." Harry smiled sheepishly.
Harry tried to creep back up stairs but then heard his uncles booming voice. "POTTER! GET IN HERE NOW." Harry stopped mid step and turned back. "Pork burnt, potatoes lumpy, what are you trying to do starve us?" He snarled, and threw his plate at Harry. "Clean this all up and go to your room." Petunia snapped, and took Dudley to the phone to order some food.
As the spell hit the blonde, Harry felt himself fall into the same pit of pain as he fell to the floor again. As if by instinct, Harry grabbed Draco and the curse stopped for both boys. "Expelliarmus!" Hermione yelled and Barton's wand flew into her hand.
During the ride home, Harry started to read all of his school books he had with him. He understood Hermione now, the books were quite fascinating, especially Hogwarts: A history. "Never took you for the reading type Potter?" Malfoy said, as Harry stuck his nose further into the book. He started to think about going back to the Dursley's and all the pain that they inflicted upon him. He started to feel queasy, but just carried on reading. "You alright Potter? You look really ill." Malfoy stated. Harry just nodded and put his book down, as it was just making him feel more ill. "Dreading going home?" Malfoy asked. Harry snapped his head up to look at the other boy, wondering if he could somehow read thoughts. "Me too." Malfoy finally sighed, and spoke no more for the rest of the journey.
It took a while for Ron to find Malfoy, as he had gone near the end of the lake and into some form of a cave. Malfoy was sat with a black sleeping wolf in his lap and his head snapped up when Ron came strolling down. "What the fuck are you doing here Weasel?" He snapped and the wolf opened his eyes to see what in the name of Merlin was going on.
Sirius looked at Harry in complete and utter shock and disgust. "And you're choosing to forgive this little shit?" He scoffed. "Honestly, it's fine. He wasn't in a very good place himself and he took it out on other people even if he didn't realise it."
Harry felt a slight tickling feeling and looked down at his wrist to see a... Tattoo? It was a heart, mostly black with a slice of red at the start. It was thumping slowly, and although it was very unnoticeable, the red was merging into the black.
Harry didn't mean to, but he let a tear slip down his cheek, and quickly wiped it away. Draco, being the taller boy, kissed Harry on the top of his head and they fell asleep.
"Ow! What was that for?" He whined, clutching his raw red face. "For being a complete and utter arse! You have some nerve showing your face back here, you have no idea what the impact was on not only Harry, but the rest of us too! Draco got no sleep whatsoever worrying, Hermione spent her nights alone, crying herself to sleep and me- you have no idea." She growled.
Ginny got into her costume as Dracula's wife and Ron and Hermione went as Mummies, Hermione looking extremely odd as her bushy hair poked threw the bandages, making her head look very lumpy and hairy. Harry just threw on a cape and some fake fangs, but wore a suit underneath which he and Draco had agreed on wearing.
"I sense some tension here, whats goi'n on?" Hagrid asked, looking between Harry and Ron. "They had a really stupid argument and won't talk to each other, no matter how much I try to persuade them." Hermione huffed, clearly annoyed that neither boy would listen to her. "Well, listen 'ere. I've known you two to be best frie'ns since you was li'le. I'm sure no argument, big o' small can get between you two, eh?" Hagrid said.
"Yeah. Before the battle started, Ron and I came up here. We thought we were never going to see this room again, so we decided to leave a piece of us in here. I saw my Dad's but I didn't realise that it was him," Harry nodded. "Your Dad and us also did this," Sirius said, getting up and pushing a wardrobe out the way.
"Harry." Harry croaked. His voice was dry, raspy and barely there. "I'm Harry." He gasped. "Okay, Harry. Can you tell me who did this to you?" Harry shook his head again and stood up. He walked over to the sinks and leaned on one, looking at himself in the mirror. Without his glamour, Harry's face looked gaunt, and un-lifely like.
"Oh, boo hoo, cut the crap nobody cares!" Draco rolled his eyes. "Harry is our worlds fucking saviour, he saved us all from eternal doom! What are people going to think if you lock him up, huh?" He snapped.  Fudge looked lost for a second then snarled. "I am the minister, not you and I think you will find I can do whatever I want! What do you care anyway? What even are you to Potter, last I heard you were helping plot to kill him!"
"They can't put you in Azkaban, Harry, can they? I mean, you saved the wizarding world! Harry, you could probably do this!" She squeaked. "No, I can't," Harry whispered quietly. "What? Yes, you can Harry!" She smiled.
Sirius stopped talking at the tearful but happy expression on Harry's face. He pulled his Godson into a hug and Harry just sobbed. "I thought you were gone forever. I thought I was never going to see you again. You don't know how hard it's been!" Harry drew away and then the door flew open.
He wrote this song, thinking that Draco would of course, never return these crazed feelings, but look at them now, sharing kisses whenever they could, sneaking around like rebellious teenagers.
"Thank You, Draco," Harry smiled, looking at the pale boy, his eyes lingering down to his torso again. "Like what you see, Potter?" Draco smirked. "Meh," Harry grinned cheekily. "Oh, really? What about when I move close to you and your breath catches and your heart starts racing?" He whispered, moving towards Harry who was backing up against the wall.
James stopped laughing and beamed down at Harry who returned a smile. This is what life should have been like, growing up hearing about the legendary pranks James Potter and his friends played at school and then trying to pull even better ones. That's the life Harry wished he had.
"Um, no, not really. I'm just trying to focus on school and careers and things at the moment. Girls are the last thing that's on my mind right now." Harry admitted. And it was true, Harry wasn't thinking about any girl, but was having confused feelings towards someone else. He could never admit that though, it was crazy!
"You need to come out to the ministry," she gasped, filled with excitement. "But Hermione, I'm not.." He started. "Oh, please Harry, it's very obvious, to me anyway. Plus, I may or may not have just been spying on you and Malfoy. You left the door open." She smiled mischievously and carried on speaking before Harry could interrupt.
Watching you grow up, at first I definitely saw your mother in you. But, then you went to school and broke probably more rules than I did!" James laughed and Harry chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Flying a car to Hogwarts though..." James paused and Harry gulped. Was he about to be told off by his dad for the first time? "Brilliant! Bloody brilliant! I wish I had thought of that in my day!" James grinned and Harry gaped stupidly.
Harry wasn’t prepared for a text from Pansy. He nearly had a heart attack when her name flashed across his phone. He wasn’t sure why her number was saved in his phone, but he ignored it. That seemed like a question with a scary answer he’d be better off not knowing. At least receiving a text meant he didn’t have to phone and speak to her in person, which was ideal. The thought of having to speak to Pansy had become his biggest fear in relation to planning Christmas with Malfoy. Compared to her, Malfoy seemed like a Scottish fold kitten.
Tower Bridge at night, all the Christmas lights turned on and a blue tree Christmas tree at the front.
Maybe Pansy forcing him outside wasn't the worst thing to happen this year. He'd made a discovery about Potter, and Pansy's downfall was made even sweeter as it came at the hands of the Gryffindor leader, Hermione Granger. It was almost worth the months of moaning he had to endure afterwards.
“I dunno Potter, do you deserve it?” Draco eyed him up and down, aware of the way it made Harry shiver.
“Thanks,” Draco’s voice was as quiet as a mouse. He thought Harry hadn’t heard until the guy turned and stared with a confused expression. “For the whole trial thing.” Could his voice get any quieter? Good grief he was a Malfoy. What would his father say about him now? Noticing the way Harry hadn’t replied, Draco continued on. “I don’t blame you for my Father either. He deserved to go to prison, but it’s still hard.” Shut up, shut up, shut up, This cold weather really was affecting his brain, bloody Pansy.
“Oh, but I am,” Draco smirked, stepping up close to Harry, looking at his lips. Their bodies flush. Harry bit his lips as he lent forwards. “Let’s finish these decorations,” Draco whispered when their lips were inches away from the others. Stepping back, he headed out of the room. Harry closed his eyes, dropping his head backwards. Apparently, Draco had his teasing hat on, and Harry loved it.
Meanwhile, the other party dared not move until he heard the click of the bathroom lock. Then he curled into a tight ball. He couldn't believe he had done that! HOW did he allow himself to climb into Harry's bed so openly last night? And now he had been draped over his body like a scarf. What if he had dribbled on Harry? Did he drool? Digging his face even deeper into the pillow, & finding comfort in Harry's scent, Draco realised exactly how screwed he was. Taking a deep breath, He utilized the chance to escape.
Harry tried to not give away the fact Draco had guessed correctly. “The twins kicked me out of the house, and I thought you might need an energy boost if your last couple of texts were anything to go by. So I got you coffee!”
Harry looped his hands around Draco’s waist and tightened them. Once more Draco was easily pulled forwards. The pair staring at each other. Neither one wanting to be the first to move. However, they both slowly leaned in, millimetres at a time, Harry feeling like he was playing a game of gay chicken. Made worse when Draco’s fingers gripped his legs, almost teasingly. Harry ran his hand down Draco’s side, catching the edge of his shirt on the way up. Pulling the material as he went, his fingertips touching the bare skin. Within a second, Draco stopped breathing, his body tensing up eyes went wide. Harry loosened his grip, sitting back so he could look at Draco. Who was intently staring at the ground, still tense.
Draco flexed his fingers, trying to work out what he should say next. Settling on, saying nothing instead.
Harry was about to reply, informing Malfoy that the remaining dirt was holding the old house up. When he got distracted, watching Malfoy pulling his coat off, draping it across the back of the sofa. He was dressed in a suit again. The dark purple colour contrasting his skin, especially when Malfoy messed with his sleeve.
Harry hugged him, keeping his arms over his shoulders. “It’s okay, we can have a breather and think of words, address situations you know responsible adult jazz like that.”
It didn’t take long for the other two to get bored and join them, again settling themselves up to help make a complete mess of the table. James ignored them as he hyper-focused on his task.
Harry checked his phone one more time, feeling oddly nervous and excited as he waited in the sitting room, idling around before sitting on the sofa arm. Only to rise a few minutes later when the floo was illuminated.
“No Potter,” Malfoy sighed, “There’s no point. Unless you’re willing to risk the Tree off-balancing the entire Feng Shui of the room and us having to redecorate again?” He lifted an eyebrow.
“You wouldn’t understand Malfoy, it’s called being Sentimental. Besides, this is eight years worth of stuff."
Catching Pansy off-guard, “How did? Oh, course, I’m surrounded by such idiots I sometimes forget other people are smart.” Pansy laughed.
