"Mr. Malfoy, do you have any idea who could be behind these attacks on your person?" Robards asked directly. "Have you been involved in any dealings or transactions that might have caused you to become a target?"
"Harry?" Hermione's thrilling voice carried over through the open door.
"I didn't know you were awake," Harry smiled. "I was going to bring you breakfast to bed."
Malfoy caught up with him and grabbed Harry's wrist. "Harry, promise me you won't go out there alone."
"I can see you're back to your charming self," Harry shook his head in exasperation and rubbed his eyes sleepily. He was so happy Draco was awake he wanted to wrap his arms around him and kiss him silly. He knew Draco wouldn't appreciate the sentiment but Harry beamed at him anyway. Draco's head was bowed and he seemed serious. Harry thought he must be in pain and presumed that professing his undying love to Draco at this moment might earn him a punch in the face. Instead, he tried to cheer him up with their usual banter. "Here goes my hope that your brain suffered enough damage and you would wake up being actually pleasant for once."
"There is one I know of," Potter grinned and sat down on the corner of Draco's desk. His crotch was in Draco's direct eye line. It was not fair Potter unconsciously flaunted himself in front of Draco in any possible situation. Draco quickly glanced at the fabric hiding Potter's cock, wondering what it looked like. How big was it? And did Potter shave there? Draco gulped and tore his gaze away. He stared at the report lying on the desk in front of him instead.
Draco must have been able to read Harry's expression, at least partially, because all of a sudden, there was a comforting hand resting on his bicep. Harry leaned into the touch inadvertently, soaking up the warmth radiating from Draco, the spicy scent of his cologne wafting into his nostrils.
Hermione dropped the quill on her work desk in frustration and sighed heavily. She'd been staring at the diagnostic chart for hours but couldn't figure out how to bring Patient X out of the stasis-induced coma. The patient had been lying in the Spell Damage ward for over two months now and neither she nor the other healers had been able to find a cure to his condition. He'd been ghost-touched and would have died if not for his friend's quick thinking who threw a stasis charm on his dying body.
"Theo started calling them Type Zero. But in all honesty, I haven't seen one since the day the new types of ghosts emerged. I often wonder what had caused them to disappear but I never came across any clue that would point me in the right direction. It is as if one day, the old ghosts vanished without a trace and the new ones replaced them, out of nowhere, with the ability to kill people."
"Alpha?" Robards asked. There was only silence. "Alpha, confirm you are heading out," Robards said again.
Harry got up, cast a gentle Wingardium Leviosa on Draco, and levitated him toward the entrance. He was afraid of touching Draco again, causing him any more pain in the process. Outside of the flat, he grabbed Draco‘s wrist as softly as he could and Apparated them to the St Mungo‘s reception area.
"I try not to rely on magic too much in the day-to-day tasks. Makes it easier not to reach instinctively for a wand when surrounded by ghosts," Malfoy replied, his voice soft and honest.
"Yeah," Harry sniffed. The anger had dissipated, and the searing grief was starting to slowly creep in again. "Me too."
"Who's hurting you, Harry?" Draco stepped into the bathroom. "Tell me who it is and I'll beat him to oblivion."
"Come on," Harry taunted him. "You call that a punch? A baby Flobberworm could do better!"
"Oh, that is understandable. I heard Mr. Potter was ill too and wasn't coming back to work until further notice. Hopefully, it's nothing serious, but then I'm sure you would be much more distressed if it was. You seemed so happy together the other day. Well, get better soon, Mr. Malfoy, I will not delay you any longer," she chatted happily as she wished him goodbye.
"As if you care," Draco grumbled.
The outer section of the wall collapsed in an explosion, however, the wall was at least twenty-four inches wide and most of it stood unharmed. Harry needed more firepower if he was to carve through it fast.
"Screw you," Harry spat and started running up the stairs to the first floor, taking them by two. He frantically searched around him, looking for any signs of ghosts or Alpha nearby. He stopped when he reached the top of the stairs. There was a dark corridor, leading to his right. There were at least four doors on each side, some of them open, some closed. Harry could barely see down the far side of the corridor. Spiderwebs were strewn all across the ceiling, almost hiding it from sight.
"Now that's brilliant," Draco shouted. "Fucking brilliant, Potter. Your ex-girlfriend, who by the way wants you back, pops by and tells you "Oh, by the way, Malfoy's cheating on you" and you immediately trust her? Over me? I thought you had a higher opinion of me than that."
"What had he done this time?" Draco asked her before she left.
He looked outside the window. The shadows had slowly started deepening, and in a few minutes, it would be dark inside the house, with all the lights turned off. "Anyway, Mr. Throw-up-during-blowjobs, I think it's time for you to pull it out and show me what you can do with it."
"Then why are you doing it?" Draco was confused again. "And besides, I thought you wanted to show me something?"
He got up from the floor in a single, fluid motion and stalked forward as if he were a panther closing in on his prey.
"Auror Potter," Robards coughed behind him. "You're not helping the situation."
"Potter?" Pansy laughed. "Shouldn't you start calling him Harry already? Or is this some weird kink you guys have? Do you call him Potter in bed while he fucks you, too?"
They headed calmly toward the Atrium not to arouse any suspicion from their fellow Aurors. The ride in the lift felt like torture and Harry had to hold himself still not to start pacing nervously in the small cabin. Suddenly, there was a tiny tug in his midsection.
"We don't know who's after you and we can't risk you getting hurt again," Harry replied. "I would prefer to stay here today. No one can get past the wards and you'll be safe here."
Harry stood up with a sigh and leaned in once more to kiss Draco's temple. He crossed the room and opened the door. He turned around wistfully and glanced back at Draco. "I love you."
"I don't know but it must have been really urgent. If I were you I would go right now," Draco smiled at him with a faked concern.
„Fuck, fuck, this is all my fault, I am so sorry,“ Harry was torn between proving Draco he trusted him and making sure he got better. For a moment he was frozen, unable to decide what to do. If he took Draco to the hospital, Draco would be even more convinced Harry didn‘t trust him and it would ruin their relationship even more. If he took Draco to bed and his condition deteriorated, Harry didn‘t think he could live with himself.
Harry nodded numbly, his feet carrying him to a nearby toilet. His hands were shaking profusely, his breathing was ragged. He was in shock and knew he had to try and think rationally. There was nothing he could do at the moment. He could not rush in and save Draco from this. Draco would make it. Draco couldn't die, not when Harry never told him he was in love with him. He would wake up and Harry would tell him. Harry started mechanically scrubbing his trembling hands with soap, watching the traces of Draco's blood disappear down the drain.
Suddenly, Draco placed his hand lightly on Harry's bicep. "Look."
Harry didn't want to have sex with Draco, not like this, but he nodded anyway. He would go with Draco only to tell him he wanted a relationship with him and would wait until Draco was ready.
"I'll tell you over dinner. I'm knackered and need a shower just about right now," Hermione smiled.
Harry gulped, swallowing the sudden pang of arousal that shot through his body, as the image of Draco's nose being anywhere close to Harry's naked arse assaulted his mind.
Harry awoke with a start. For a second he didn't know where he was, his hand flying to his side to draw a wand.
"That is the biggest bullshit you've ever said, you dolt," Pansy slapped him.
The healers disappeared in a rush of shouted instructions. The only evidence they'd been there was a field bed splattered with Draco's blood.
At that moment Draco's Patronus, a silvery fox, jumped through the bronze door and wound its tail around Harry's ankle. STILL ALIVE. DON'T SEND PATRONUS BACK. CAREFUL, THEY SEE THROUGH DISILLUSIONMENT.
Harry and Draco try to deal with the bottled-up feelings after Harry's fit of rage.
„Harry, listen to me. Imagine the roles were reversed; what if it was Draco who hurt you. Would you hate him now?“ Narcissa asked softly.
"I'll have to punish you, then," Draco hissed and turned Harry over on his stomach roughly.
Harry breathed out. He stomped a few times, relieved he could finally move, and contentedly scratched his itching back. He was torn between following Draco and going back to his desk and the actual work he was supposed to be doing. Following Draco was such a bad idea and surely, the letter was work-related. But who Incendioed work letters? Curiosity and intuition won out and Harry silently snuck out of the office, barely catching the sight of Draco‘s platinum blond hair disappearing around the corner of the corridor leading to the lifts and stairs to the Atrium.
"Did you figure it out? Is it ready? Can we try it out?" Harry almost tripped in his rush to Hermione's side.
"You're incredible," Potter whispered, got up, and left.
"The famous Harry Potter at my doorstep. Don't think that's going to make me pay you more than we agreed on," the woman narrowed her eyes at Harry. Her gaze wandered up and down over him as if she tried to determine if Harry was the real deal.
"Fine, where do you want to go next?" he asked a moment later.
„Disgusting,“ Ron shot at Harry as soon as the door closed behind Draco.
„Where are you going?“ Ron asked suspiciously. He had been watching Harry closely ever since they woke up that morning.
Draco hadn't spoken to Potter since that first day in the hospital. He hadn't replied to any of the owls that tapped at his window. He needed time to understand what was going on inside his own mind. He needed time to understand why he was haunted in his dreams by the sight of excruciating pain reflected in emerald green eyes. He'd often thought about that moment when Potter rescued him from the warehouse. He thought about the kiss, how soft Potter's lips felt against his own. His mind kept replaying the anguish on Potter's face over and over again when he realized Draco didn't remember… them. Most of all Draco didn't understand why he'd woken up every night from those nightmares, drenched in sweat, feeling as if a large chunk of his heart had been torn away.
Draco pounced at him and started ravaging his mouth. They both tore at the clothes they were still wearing. Harry grabbed Draco's shirt and ripped it apart hungrily, buttons flying everywhere, while Draco divested Harry of the joggers and shirt. Their kiss turned sloppy and wet, their tongues thrusting against each other, teeth biting and nipping at the lips. Draco pulled back, breathing hard.
"That's not what Aurors say," Harry chuckled. "Where did you even hear that?"
"Harry?" Draco repeated, louder this time.
Harry knew he deserved that jab, as he frequently paraded his lovers in front of Draco in hope to make him jealous. Harry had always known it was childish but now, seeing the pain in Draco's eyes, he realized he might have inadvertently ruined their relationship before it even started. Why did that thought hurt so much? Harry needed to get out, to breathe.
First of all, please don't take any of this as an excuse because what I did is inexcusable. I hope you will see the letter for what it is - my deepest apology.
"Modest as ever, I see," Draco rolled his eyes.
„Better?“ Draco asked softly, his mouth slowly moving down, his tongue leaving a wet shiny path along Harry‘s neck.
"Let me try something," Draco whispered so quietly he could barely hear himself speak. "Close your eyes."
Ron lowered himself on the sofa. He seemed weary and bone-tired as he ran his hand across his face. "None of us have realized anything was wrong with her. Neither I nor mum and dad noticed either. How did we not see it?"
„Dracooo!“ Harry exclaimed, the o morphing into a long moan. Draco suppressed his gag reflex. It wouldn‘t do to throw up all over Harry, he thought to himself. He returned to a safer position, drawing his attention back to the head of Harry‘s cock. He sucked at the head, his cheeks hollowed, with short but forceful movements. Harry‘s whole body started trembling, his legs twitched involuntarily, his chiseled out abdominal muscles contracting fast and the hand in Draco‘s hair gripped him so hard it must have surely ripped half of Draco‘s hair out. If it did, Draco would make Harry pay later. He could already think about at least a dozen ways to discipline him.
Harry cradled Draco carefully to his chest and Apparated to the tent as soon as he felt the wards lose their hold on him. He resisted the urge to Apparate directly to St. Mungo's. He knew that the medi-wizards in the Auror base would be able to Portkey Draco directly to the operating room, saving precious seconds Draco needed.
"Right, sorry," Harry let go of his arms sheepishly. He couldn't help but notice the feeling of warmth filling his chest. This was huge progress towards figuring out the ghost plague since it'd started two years ago. And if Harry was completely honest with himself, touching Malfoy was actually nice, pleasant even. Harry wondered what it would be like, to start over, to be friends. Maybe more than friends, eventually. Harry flushed and bit his lip to stop the train of his thoughts.
"My instincts are telling me this is connected," Harry pressed on stubbornly. "I will not endanger Draco anymore than is strictly necessary. It's difficult to make sure he's safe enough as it is. The git insisted on going back to work tomorrow, and I nearly had to bind him to the bed to stay at home, at least for today."
Potter sulkily flopped himself into the chair Draco had moved over for him. "I know how to interrogate people," Potter whispered furiously.
Harry smirked at him, splayed his fingers wide and traced his hand over his abdomen, and finally gripped the base of his cock. He loved how Draco's gaze immediately followed the movement. Harry twisted his palm over the head of his prick experimentally. He had to grab the edge of the bathtub. The sensation was too strong and he nearly fell as his whole body shuddered with pleasure. This was so much better than wanking alone, Harry thought. The way Draco devoured the sight of Harry tossing himself off was mindblowing. Harry couldn't hold in the shout that tore out of him as he started jerking off rapidly.
"Yes, well… we don't know what Ron would have wanted, do we?" tears welled up in Hermione's eyes. "I can't have this baby alone, Harry. I can't do this without him."
"I will not have him end up like Neville's parents," Harry choked back the angry tears that were welling in his eyes.
Draco watched Aquila, his beautiful, majestic eagle-owl fly off with the message. He busied himself studying the history of the house where he and Theo were supposed to go on a job next week. He was absorbed in his case file when there was a knock on his window. He glanced at the clock and was surprised it was almost 2 PM. Draco's stomach rumbled and he realized he completely missed lunch. He opened the window with a sigh and let Aquila fly in and settle herself on her perch. She held out her leg and allowed Draco to take the piece of parchment affixed to it. Draco bit his lip in frustration when he realized his message to Potter was unread. Draco hid his face in his hands and growled. Fucking Potter, he had to come and meddle in Draco's peaceful life as always.
Harry had to fight an urge to roll his eyes and hide an affectionate smile that threatened to curl his lips. He had to admit Draco looked debauched. Harry's cock approved of the view as well, it was half-hard already, just from the few seconds of staring at the long lean body sprawled before him.
„Are you cheating on me?“ Harry whispered hoarsely.
"I'm so sorry, darling, I really am. But why are you even here, alone? Why don't you go to him?" she asked gently.
The lock clicked and the door opened slowly, revealing a disgruntled-looking Harry. His eyes were red-rimmed and his cheeks tear-stained. Draco gulped. He felt as if someone stabbed him through the heart.
"I'm sorry, Harry," Shacklebolt agreed. "It was uncalled for."
Harry adds a third finger and continues his careful ministrations, stretching Draco intently. Draco pants and whines and whimpers, until Harry's cock is harder than it has ever been in his life.
„Is that explanation good enough for you, Harry?“ Draco asked quietly.
Tracey's face went rigid for a second before she hid it with a frown. Draco must have hit the bullseye. "You're a right bastard, Malfoy."
"Ladies first," Harry nodded toward the door.
Draco was sitting on a chair in front of an old teacher‘s desk. Harry was perched on top of him, stradling him, his arms wrapped around Draco‘s shoulders. Harry‘s prick was hidden between their very naked bodies.
Harry's face fell and he stumbled a step back. "Forget I said anything."
"I'm not going to listen to any more of your vile lies. You're going to pay for taking him away from me," Ginny shouted and readied her wand.
Harry piled fried eggs, bacon, and toasts on a large oval plate, and arranged it on a tray next to two glasses of organic mango juice, Draco's favourite, and two cups of tea. He picked up the tray and yelped when he noticed Draco standing in the doorway.
"Fuck," Harry cursed under his breath. "That was something."
Harry grinned wider. Malfoy's eyes were glazed, his pupils dilated and he was sporting a rather promising erection. Harry didn't have an excuse for keeping his hand on Malfoy's thigh any longer and regretfully turned back to his pint.
Draco shot out of the bed and started dressing hastily.
Malfoy stood there, gaping at Harry as if unsure he was mentally stable. "You're touching me," he said. The tone of his voice wasn't angry or derisive, merely surprised.
Harry's green eyes bore into his, full of hope and love, desire and lust and longing. Oh my God, Draco thought. He was the most oblivious fool out of all the oblivious fools in the whole world. There was never anyone else. Harry wanted him. Draco wanted to punch himself for not seeing it sooner.
Draco whimpered and scrambled up to the podium. He knocked the microphone out of the way and claimed Harry's lips in a desperate kiss. He tried to convey with every swipe of his tongue how sorry he was for not doing it much, much sooner.
Draco gratefully gulped in lungfuls of fresh air through his heavy panting.
Harry calls for a private meeting with the Head Auror and the Minister of Magic. He plans to lead a secret investigation to find out who tortured Draco.
"Right, see you later then," Draco said and stalked out of the bedroom without waiting for an answer.
"Anyway, Type Twos. Let's start with those you've already had the pleasure to meet. The most common one would be a Spectre. They always form a clear apparition, in some cases, they may seem almost solid. Usually, they are an accurate visual echo of the deceased as they were when alive or newly dead. Some of them are neutral or benign in their dealings with the living, perhaps returning to reveal a secret or make right an ancient wrong. Some, however, are actively hostile and their primary goal is to cause pain to humans. Presumably to make them suffer as they had suffered themselves in their deaths. You were chased by Spectres back in the mansion," Draco explained.
They'd agreed they would enter one by one so that they accidentally didn't make contact with the door and cause any unwarranted noise. Draco was first with Potter in tow, then Smith, and lastly Nott.
the ball of parchment with her wand.
"Whadaryoudoing?" Potter grumbled, his mouth half pressed against the mattress.
Potter barked out a surprised laugh. "I can assure you, us working together will be a delight," his eyes sparkled with merriment and he bit his lip as if trying to stop himself from saying more.
without success. When Harry was finally done with the room, it looked as if a tornado had torn through it. Harry sighed and sat down heavily in the middle of the debris as a wave of uselessness hit him. He was good for nothing these days. He hadn't been able to save Alpha, he didn't know how to convince the Ministry of Magic to start taking action to solve the Problem. What had he gotten right in the past year or two? Nothing. He was useless. He couldn't even save Ron, his best friend.
"I don't remember any of it, Pans," Draco's throat was sore from crying and his chest hurt. "And yet I feel this void inside me and I don't know what to do about it. I feel so strange all the time as if I'm waiting for something to happen but I don't even know what that something is."
He half regretted stopping Harry. His prick was swollen and painfully hard, throbbing with the need for release. However, reassuring Harry he loved him before he managed to work himself into another panic attack, was more important than getting off.
"How many ghosts are there in your cottage?" Potter leaned forward in his chair and hissed when Draco's shoe connected with his calf painfully.
Harry plastered his chest against Draco‘s, reveling in the sensation of skin on skin, letting his hands roam across Draco‘s spine and tangle them in his hair, all the while kissing Draco passionately. He felt his trousers and pants being pushed down his thighs and he kicked them off without breaking the kiss.
Harry let Draco lay his head in the crook of his neck and encircled him in his arms tenderly. The feel of Harry's body against his own and the scent of Harry‘s perfume mixed with a hint of his sweat helped Draco relieve some of the tension he was feeling. He snuggled closer to Harry, who started pressing thousands of tiny soft kisses into his hair. They stayed like that for what felt like an eternity.
"And whose fault would that be? It's your bad you're daft. At least you acknowledge your shortcomings," Draco got up and smirked at Harry's disbelieving expression.
They appeared in an alley next to an old, unused warehouse in an apparently Muggle area of Greater London. The high windows were dirty with grit and dust, the bricks old and stained with soot. The rusty metal double door leading to depths of the warehouse stood slightly ajar, gaping like a mouth of some mythical beast.
Cold spots were areas where the chill accompanying a manifestation was concentrated. Sometimes the temperatures reached below the freezing point. He checked his thermometer, which confirmed his suspicion. Minus five degrees. Draco turned around and crossed the attic, joining Harry in the protective circle. He welcomed the heat of Harry's hand which immediately found his lower back, rubbing slow circles there, warming Draco up.
"I'll be going then, sorry to bother you," he shot a hurt look at Draco.
"It's not a laughing matter, Scarhead. Wait till you see one," Draco sniffed.
"I hate Potter, he's made you gone mental! You specifically said and I quote
„I have no idea what you‘re talking about, Potter. You should get your ears checked at St Mungo‘s,“ Draco scowled at him. It didn‘t reach his eyes though, those were still filled with happiness.
"How could you be so selfish, you idiot?" Malfoy started shouting again as soon as they appeared in his office. "Do you have any idea, how scared Granger was? She was beside herself because you decided to play a hero again, you bloody Gryffindor oaf. Have you ever stopped to think for a second what it would do to her if you died? Have you thought about me or Pansy dying while coming to rescue you?"
Harry chuckled. "You did miss me."
"Excuse my associate for his bluntness," Draco apologized and narrowed his eyes at Potter imperceptibly. "He's new. Anyway, you were saying there is a problem you would like us to investigate?"
"That's not what I want, Harry," Hermione got up and sat in Harry's lap. She curled around him, seeking warmth and safety. "You're my best friend and I want you to be happy. You deserve it, don't think otherwise. You've been alone for far too long and you deserve to have someone who would be there for you."
Potter's expression changed from hurt to predatory. "I'll give you hard, Malfoy. You'll see."
Draco silently thanked her and promised himself he would buy her the most expensive chocolate he could find. He reached for the handle behind his back blindly and tried to open the door. It was stuck. Draco turned around and furiously pulled at the handle. Nothing happened.
, Malfoy," Granger replied and smiled at Draco gratefully. Her smile was honest and heartfelt.
They glared at each other.
„That will be all, thank you. Close the door on your way out, will you,“ Draco dismissed her formally.
"You ponce!" Harry shouted and scrambled after him. He landed in the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic and frantically searched for a flash of blonde hair.
"I won't argue with you as that is a distinct possibility," Granger smiled. "However, I don't think he would blindly wander the streets."
"Honestly?" Harry looked at him all serious. "I'm not. Call me paranoid but we haven't told that many people. At the time you were…" Harry gulped.
Harry was crouching in front of the fireplace in the library of Grimmauld place. He threw a fistful of the Floo Powder into the flames, making them turn bright green, and stuck his head through to talk to Hermione.
"Yeah," Draco squeaked and stared at Potter's lips some more.
Draco lifted his hand up to silence everyone. He crossed the room and kissed Harry gently on the lips, sighing as their lips met in a soft caress. He placed his arms around Harry's shoulders and snuggled his face into the crook of Harry's neck.
"The fuck it was," Harry fumed. "Either treat Draco with respect he deserves as the victim he is or this interview is over."
„Harry, I can‘t lose you, promise me I won‘t lose you over this,“ Draco asked suddenly, his voice barely reaching Harry.
Draco looked at him and narrowed his eyes. Goldstein's dirty blonde hair was styled impeccably, in contrast to Potter's unruly nest of black hair. His eyes were all wrong. Blue, not like the vivid emerald green of Potter's eyes. Goldstein never argued with him, never laughed at his jokes, and was generally the most boring bloke Draco'd ever met. Goldstein plopped onto Potter's-no-more chair and started unpacking his sandwich. Draco didn't even have to look and knew it was a ham and cheese sandwich. Cheddar cheese to be precise.
„Did you lock the door?“ Draco asked quietly.
„Can I come in?“ Ginny asked.
"I can hear something strange," Harry whispered back.
Each room was as empty and filled with dust as the previous one, looking abandoned and sad. Harry wondered what had happened in there, during World War II, what kind of experiments or medical procedures had been conducted in the basement, what horrors had the patients suffered. He understood why there were so many ghosts now and even more why the house felt as dark and gloomy as it had. The walls seemed to be soaked with terror, anger, and madness, and when Harry stopped to listen, he could almost hear faint whispers coming from every direction at once. Once he had a bit more time, he would go into a library and try to find the records of this place. He knew it wouldn't change the past but for some incomprehensible reason, he needed to find out what had happened there.
"Granger, thank you for accepting me on such short notice," Draco said as he sat down on the sofa in Granger's office. The room was modest and professional, exactly what Draco had imagined a healer's office would look like. The walls were white, as were the tiles on the floor. The furniture and sofa had a grey hue to them and were of simple design. The walls were decorated with diplomas and posters describing in detail various body parts such as leg muscles, individual bones in a hand, and what eyes were made of. There was a glass cabinet alongside one of the walls, holding miscellaneous healing potions.
Potter's face and clothes were smudged with dirt and his hair and shoulders were covered in cobwebs. Not even in his wildest dreams had Draco thought he would ever get to see Potter looking more like a mess than that day he'd landed in the mud on the Quidditch pitch. He looked ten times worse now. Draco would have laughed if Potter wasn't running across the foyer with a trail of ghosts in his wake.
"At the same time, as I said before, a trace can also mean a source," Hermione carried on. "Why do some dead people come back as ghosts and some not? Do you remember when I asked Headless Nick the same question years ago when we were still at Hogwarts? He said that ghosts manifest when they feel their deaths were premature or unjust. When there is something that ties them to their former life. I think there must be a specific source of each ghost, they must be tied to our world through this Source."
"I… I don't know what to say to that," Potter trailed off.
Harry and Draco had made an agreement that their relationship would stay their sweet little secret. None of their friends knew they were dating. They never went out to dinners where they could be seen, either opting for take-away or Harry cooking them decent dinners. In the beginning, it had seemed like a great idea, staying hidden, where no one could meddle in their improbable and unexpected relationship.
They left the relative safety of the kitchen with its twenty-one degrees and moved through the corridor back to the foyer, measuring the temperature in each room. There were no significant deviations, the temperature ranging from eighteen to twenty-two degrees.
Relief flooded Harry's chest. "Thank you."
Tracey's eyes narrowed. "I should have guessed that was all there is to you. Anyway, I don't care about the reason why you're doing this. All that matters is that you help Harry."
„I can‘t anymore,“ Harry laughed out loud. He dragged Draco up into a bruising kiss, tasting the residue of his own come. Several blissful minutes later, Harry broke the kiss with a content sigh.
Draco lay on his back and opened his arms in invitation. Harry pouted but folded himself against Draco obediently, resting his head in the crook of Draco‘s neck, tangling their legs together.
He underlined the words One and Two he'd written on the blackboard in white chalk twice for a good measure. Harry had to admit Malfoy was a natural at explaining stuff. His enthusiasm made Harry want to find out more, know everything there was about ghosts. He knew he didn't have to try hard and he would still remember everything Malfoy told him. He wished all of his teachers at Hogwarts had been like that. Maybe then he would have actually paid attention during the classes. Harry nodded for Malfoy to go on.
„Fuck, I‘m such an idiot,“ Harry murmured to himself and started backing towards the office door. Unfortunately for him, it opened at that moment and Draco barged in. A stocky young woman with long wavy blonde hair followed him inside. Harry plastered himself silently against the closest wall.
Instead of replying, Ron swung at him again, hitting him with such a force that Harry fell flat on the floor. "My sister, my little baby sister is going to end up in Azkaban because of you and your shit boyfriend!" Ron's face was a shade of dark purple, spit flying from his mouth.
„We don‘t have to talk about this until you feel ready. Just… just don‘t leave me, please,“ Harry was starting to hyperventilate, his eyes full of fear, tears threatening to spill down his cheeks.
"Am I what?" Draco asked, clearly confused.
"Stop asking me," Harry hissed impatiently. "Fuck me, already, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me," he chanted over and over again.
The silence stretched. Potter's knee brushed his under the table and Draco jumped.
"Muscle memory," Harry whispered. He leaned closer and slid his hands under Draco's shirt, splaying his fingers over Draco's vertebrae. "Imagine your spine as the piano keys. Imagine learning a melody by heart and playing it over and over and over again. Years fly by and you stop playing, you haven't touched the piano in ages, you can't even recall the melody you used to play."
Harry flopped himself onto the ugly khaki sofa without a word. He glanced at the front cover of the booklet and stared at it for a moment in bemusement. There was an animated, cartoon version of Malfoy drawn in wizarding paint, his blonde hair shiny and impeccably styled. The figure sneered at Harry and a speech bubble appeared above its head
Draco should have probably called before he stumbled in through Harry's fireplace unannounced. He dusted himself off and looked around gingerly. He was standing in a drawing-room of sorts, or a library, he couldn't tell. He didn't pay much attention to his surroundings, however. His gaze was fixed on the sofa in front of him. Harry was lying there, sprawled on his back, one leg bent at the knee. He was dressed in grey joggers and Draco's favourite white shirt. The shirt was left unbuttoned, leaving Harry's chest bare. The sight made Draco's breath catch and heat pool in his stomach. He ran his eyes across the chiseled-out abdominal muscles, the soft-looking skin, the perfect nipples that begged to be teased with tongue and teeth. Harry's head was resting in the crook of his arm, his face turned toward the fireplace. Reflection of the flames danced across his features and Draco took his time to admire the strong, square jawline and masculine bone structure. Harry looked so beautiful in his sleep that Draco wanted to freeze this moment and dwell in it forever. His breathing quickened and Draco knew Pansy was right. He would always want Harry no matter what.
„Harry,“ Draco whispered.
„Right, mate,“ Ron shook his head from across the table.
„But you have to wait for it,“ Draco snickered. He licked slowly over Harry‘s arsehole, circling the soft skin there with his tongue.
"Aren't we all?" Weasley one mumbled.
Harry took in the desolate state of the room, the torn mattresses, the heap of furniture in the corner he'd levitated there. Right, that had changed.
They both cast the Disillusionment Charms and followed Nott and Smith up the set of white steps to the large bronze door leading inside the Gringott's Wizarding Bank. The door was slightly ajar as if held open by a spell.
When the door closed behind Harry, Draco fell into his chair wearily. He didn't sleep well last night. He was tossing and turning for hours, and even the warmth and feel of Harry's body next to him couldn't lull him to sleep. He would never admit it out loud, but he was scared. He didn't want to get hurt again. He could still feel the remnants of the pain assaulting his senses, he could almost taste the way his whole body had felt as if it was on fire. The stretch and pull of his muscles had been almost unbearable. He didn't want to go through that again but it was the best plan they'd come up with on such short notice. One Crucio and that was it. The only thing that kept him going and not chickening out, was the reward that awaited him at the end. Harry.
Theo reluctantly climbed up. Luna kissed his cheek and their hands entwined lovingly. Draco felt a pang of jealousy and sadness again. He wanted to have what they had so much. He wanted to be comforted and loved and mean the whole world to someone.
"It's not your fault, Harry," Draco waved him off. "It's almost always like that. I'm used to such behaviour."
"You're going to be the death of me Harry," Draco's hips bucked violently on their own volition, his whole body spasming with pleasure.
„Piss off, Malfoy!“ Harry hissed. „I wish I could get some alone time with you and punch you in the face.“
Harry laughed out loud. The laughter turned into a sob and he tried to hold himself still as the shivers started running through his body. He knew Hermione could feel it but mercifully she ignored it and didn't say anything. Harry was grateful to her. He let the tears fall down his cheeks silently and despite his distress, he drifted off to sleep soon.
Draco startled. „Oh, it‘s you.“
"Mostly Muggles," the old man replied. "You see, Jackie and I are both Squibs. Most of the wizards tend to look down on us. We prefer to steer clear of them."
"I thought you trusted me," Ginny's lower lip wobbled. "I care about you, Harry. I would never lie to you, you know that, don't you?"
"Anything for noble Master Draco," Kreacher drew himself a little straighter and disappeared.
„No, here, fuck me right here,“ Harry whispered hoarsely. He dragged the sweater over Draco‘s head and threw it on the floor. He immediately went back to kissing Draco deeply, shoving his tongue into his mouth vigorously. Not only because he needed to feel as much of Draco as possible but also to prevent any complaints about him manhandling Draco‘s precious clothes.
There was a sudden, uncomfortable silence after that, all of the good mood evaporating in an instant.
„Has baby Dwaco pooped himself? Shall I change baby Dwaco‘s diaper?“ Harry cooed at him.
Harry smiled up at him and pulled the string.
„Gee, thanks,“ Harry snickered scornfully.
"Sounds like a plan," Harry nodded in the dark.
"Muggle TV," Draco shrugged sheepishly. "Now quiet prisoner."
„We are going to run various tests on Mr. Malfoy. Both diagnostical charms and examine his blood for any potions or unpredicted substances. Then we will give Mr. Malfoy a dose of Dreamless Sleep. You will then be shown into his room and allowed to stay with him until he wakes up. Now, please wait here, until we transport Mr. Malfoy to his room.“
„Shit, I don‘t think we have time for me to take my shoes off,“ Draco grumbled, clearly frustrated.
Draco's cock, already painfully hard, jerked violently in his trousers.
"Thank you very much, Kreacher. As Harry said, that will be all for now," Draco nodded and tried to hide his crotch inconspicuously as it was approximately at Kreacher's eye level.
Light burst from the tip of his wand, illuminating his surroundings. Harry blinked a few times to let his eyes adjust to the sudden brightness. The stairs were wooden and like the rest of the house covered in a thick layer of dust. The plaster had fallen off the walls in places and beads of condensation gathered on the revealed stonework. A waft of dank cold air crept from the cellar and chilled Harry to the bone. He shivered involuntarily. The feeling of dread in his stomach was back, stronger than before. Harry swallowed around it and gingerly placed his foot onto the first stair. It creaked under his weight but held. Harry breathed in and continued down the stairs carefully. The air smelled musty and foul, and strangely of impending doom. As he descended into the cellar, he felt the temperature around him drop significantly with each step. The stairs opened into a large, concrete room, with no windows. Harry looked around and the sight stole all the air from his lungs. There were hospital cots with mouldy blankets haphazardly thrown over them, but what drew Harry's attention almost immediately, were the padded handcuffs attached to the metal frames of the beds. There were dry, brownish stains ingrained into the sallow padding. Blood. Worse still, in the center of the room stood a surgical metal table with various scalpels, knives, scissors, drills, and other tools arranged on top of it. Harry didn't want to imagine their purpose but he could very well guess it anyway. Harry swallowed the bile he felt rising in his throat.
Potter's eyes found Draco's and a corner of his mouth turned up playfully. Not a reaction Draco expected. "I do pay attention to things I find interesting, Malfoy."
"Don't forget, we need to see them cast at least one spell against Mr. Malfoy. We needed it as proof that the person we hopefully catch today is the one who tortured him. You know it has to be done that way as you refused to report this case officially," Robards eyed him disapprovingly. "We need to have a reason for the bust if the evidence is to stand before the Wizengamot."
"What if he doesn't come?" Harry whined.
„No, no, no I get it, I do. I get that you don‘t want that, I just thought… I just wanted to…,“ Harry‘s eyes started to water against his own will. He blinked rapidly against the wetness and frantically searched Draco‘s face for any indication of his feelings or thoughts. What he saw there was an expression that scared him: pity. He had expected anything but pity. He would prefer a punch in the jaw over pity thousandfold. God, Draco was going to break up with him, wasn‘t he?. Harry couldn‘t bear it.
Draco had to admit, Potter-ready-for-action was one of the sexiest things he'd ever seen. Right after Potter-in-action and Potter-in-the-shower. Yes, Draco did see Potter in the shower once, completely accidentally of course. Even more accidentally, he let his gaze roam over Potter's naked body, slick with water and soap suds, for much longer than was polite.
"Get inside the circle and wait for me. Try to see if you can hear the ghost again."
Draco had never been friends with Tracey back at Hogwarts and even though they shared most of their classes, they barely ever spoke. Draco appreciated she dropped everything to meet with him, even though he knew she did it because of Potter.
"You smell good, new perfume?" Harry asked. Harry knew for a fact it was the same old one he'd always worn. He could never forget the scent, as it was closely linked to his cock. Every time he smelled it, no matter if it was in the office, during a coffee break, or in the middle of a stake-out, it made his prick thicken.
" Pansy quipped.
Harry pushed Ginny away from him. „I need to be alone right now,“ he said quietly, trying to control his temper.
"It's going to be bad," Draco sounded tired. There was an underlying emotion in his voice Pansy couldn't identify. It worried her, she knew him almost as well as she knew herself. Not being able to tell what Draco was thinking scared her a bit. "It's going to be really bad, Pansy."
Harry whimpered, ice spreading through his veins. He ran over to Draco and lifted him up. He could hear awful wet gurgling sounds escaping Draco's lips as he tried to breathe and he coughed out a handful of blood. He could feel more of Draco's blood seep out of his wounds, soaking Harry's robes, sticking them to his body.
"Yes, that's it," Harry whispered. "I'm trying to find your Sources so that you can move on peacefully."
„Of course, Harry. We love you and if Draco makes you happy,“ Hermione trailed off but managed a weak smile in Draco‘s direction. She seemed to steel herself, then took a step forward and offered Draco her hand resolutely. „I think we should start all over again. If Harry can put the past behind him, so can we.“
The darkness around them almost reached the iron chains. The cold was seeping into their bones and Draco realized they needed to stop wasting their time bickering. He immediately sprung back into action.
Harry leaned in, letting his eyes skim through the page, and then shrugged. "I can't say I do."
"Are you sure? I don't want you to feel like I'm putting him above you or anything."
"I'm trying to seduce you, you oaf," Draco chuckled, his forehead still resting on the desktop.
Tears prickled the back of Draco's throat as he tried to swallow them. He cuddled Harry closer to him and kissed away the tears that had spilled out of Harry's eyes. "I'm yours, Harry. Forever and ever," he whispered, ignoring the fact they'd both turned into the biggest of Hufflepuffs.
„My left pocked,“ Draco moaned while jumping off the table and turning around. He lay his torso on Harry‘s desk and stuck his arse out in invitation.
„Is deranged Master Harry breaking things again for a reason?“ Kreacher appeared in the room with a loud pop.
Harry felt a stab of guilt in his heart and shame prickled his spine. He realized with a jolt of fear that his friends, his enemies, the public, the Daily Prophet, not even Ginny's false accusations could ever ruin his relationship with Draco. If someone ruined it, it would be him, Harry. "Fuck, Draco, I'm sorry, I'm such a mess," Harry breathed out, his heart feeling heavy in his chest.
"Don't be ridiculous, Potter," Draco bristled. "Why the fuck would I be jealous? I'm just astonished there are still some gay wizards left in England you haven't fucked yet."
Potter woke up with a start and snatched his hand back as if burned. Draco's stomach lurched. His heart gave another painful beat, this time stung by the obvious rejection.
Draco gaped at him.
"That's bullshit and you know it," Harry bellowed. "People are dying out there while the Ministry hides from the truth. We need to take precautions, we need to be safe while doing our job!"
„Not as amazing, no,“ Harry chuckled. „I‘m the only person on the receiving end of those brilliant blowjobs and I won‘t share. Not even with you.“
"Was there any other reason you didn't tell Bellatrix?" Harry asks softly and searches Malfoy's face. He steps closer, their chests only inches apart.
Confusion swims in the grey eyes but transforms into understanding when Harry whispers "Accio Draco's wand."
"Are you coming to the Leaky tonight? I know Ron is planning a surprise Welcome-Back Party. I'm not supposed to know but…," Potter hesitated. "You are coming, right?"
Draco made up his mind and sneaked closer to the group. Fortunately, the two robbers were still facing the other way, apparently waiting for instructions from someone trying to get into the Vaults. Draco considered his next steps carefully. The hostages appeared to be bound together by an Incarcerous but a quick Finite Incantatem should take care of it. All Draco had to do was make sure his timing was perfect.
"Who's the negotiator on shift, Sir?" Draco asked.
"It sounds like some kind of creaking, like a branch of an old tree swaying in the wind. Or rusty hinges of a swing on a playground," Harry said.
Potter blushed. "Right. And what's that for?" Potter pointed at a thermometer in an effort to salvage the situation. Realizing he'd just inadvertently provided Draco with more evidence of his own stupidity, he hid his face in his palms instead and sighed in resignation.
"I couldn't have put it better, my dear."
"Fuck, why doesn't it work?" Harry cursed anxiously. "Hermione was so convinced it would!"
The spell wears off some ten minutes after the door has clicked shut behind the werewolf. Harry rushes to Draco's side, his legs stiff. He wobbles but manages to cross the room without falling. Harry's cheeks are tear-stained, snot running out of his nose. He wipes it off with the back of his hand mindlessly. He doesn't know what to do. Draco keeps lying there, still, a husk, gazing somewhere far off, unmoving. Harry gingerly picks the shreds of Draco's pants off the floor and wipes the offending white streaks off of Draco's skin.
"We've already contacted the goblin liaison, they'll be here any minute," Robards stated. "Auror Potter, back with me to the base. Nott, Smith, stay here and keep working on that door."
„That‘s it?“ he asked.
"None of that, Harry," Draco lifted his chin gently. "I wanted it just as much as you. This is not your fault, the blame goes to the person who decided to Crucio me. Not you."
"Shut up," Harry whispered furiously, hoping Draco hadn't overheard them. Out of all fucking days, Smith had to be there yesterday. Harry turned around and saw Draco's venomous glare trained at him.
"Harry ordered it for me," Draco said with a smile.
"Piss off, you drunken sod," Draco snickered as he righted himself.
"You bet. Besides it's not my fault you look so adorable when you're flustered," Harry quipped.
Draco batted his hand away and frowned. "Of course not, I'm just not overly fond of them, that's all."
"Do you think he's really here?" Pansy asked. She wanted to find Potter, kick his arse and be out of here as soon as possible.
„What the bloody hell is Malfoy doing here, Harry!“ Ron exclaimed, going for his wand. In a span of a few seconds, his face went pale, turned a shade of dark blotchy purple, and settled on green, which clashed horribly with his ginger hair.
"Oh, I'm so not done with you," Harry laughed. "Let me just take care of a little problem I have. I have to come now otherwise I won't last a second inside you."
„It‘s half-past nine, you twat,“ Harry exclaimed.
"Action is my middle name," Harry wiggled his eyebrows at her and truly smiled for the first time in several days.
Draco sniffed. "Who do you think I am? The Weasel? I'm not an oblivious fool! I'm sharp-witted, unlike him! He didn't even notice something was bothering you tonight. Don't you worry, I'll figure it out swiftly."
Harry felt himself blush beetroot red. "I… well, I sometimes call him that in my head."
"Alright," she said, unperturbed by his pleading, and took a bite. "I think I figured it out. I just need to make sure the spell is safe but I think I'm very close. Basically, I combined three different principles from three different spells. The most important one being the memory extraction spell, the one you use to store your memories in a Pensieve. That forms the basis of the spell. However, it only works for insubstantial thoughts while we're dealing with ectoplasm, which is a substantial matter. For that reason, I decided to tweak it slightly, merging it with an
"You're closer, go get it," Draco, contradictory to his words, wrapped his arms even tighter around Harry's back.
„As if you weren‘t snogging Ginny senseless,“ Ron frowned at him.
„OK, deal!“ Ron replied triumphantly. „I‘m going to buy loads of stuff from the Honeydukes with your Galleon, once I win.“
„Then you must know, deep down, that‘s how Draco feels about you. Trust me, Harry. He might make you pay for whatever you did but he loves you dearly,“ Narcissa‘s voice was tinged with a smile.
„Of course it bothered me! No one ignores a Malfoy!“ Draco shouted. „And I thought you didn‘t want me anymore,“ he pouted.
Pansy could see Draco was furious when he Apparated back into the Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. office. The expression on his face told her everything she needed to know. She immediately jumped out of her chair, where she had been painting her nails, Muggle style. Draco insisted they never wore any charmed or spelled objects when out on a case, including any cosmetic procedures. The first time Pansy painted her nails with a Muggle varnish had been a disaster. Now, her manicure was bottled perfection.
They were standing in front of the fireplace in Grimmauld Place, about to leave for work. Draco rolled his eyes and stepped through the Floo, leaving Harry behind with a snicker.
"I didn't force her to torture him, did I?" Harry spat back. "I didn't fucking ask her to wipe his memory. He doesn't remember, Ron! I was truly happy for the first time in my life and she took it away!"
"How did you mean it then?" Malfoy sneered at him, shaking Harry's hand off. His grey eyes were sharp and threatening. "Maybe the real reason for you wanting to join my agency is not as innocent as you made it sound. Maybe you think the Problem is somehow my fault? That I'm up to something again?"
"I…," Ginny stammered. "I should be going." She turned around hastily.
„I mean it, Harry, don‘t talk right now,“ Draco shushed him and kissed him bruisingly. Draco knew Harry well and was sure that if he tried to explain his feelings to Harry at this very moment, Harry would hear only half of it and that half would get twisted somewhere on the way to his brain, causing Harry to completely misinterpret Draco‘s words. He had to calm Harry down and he knew how to do just that.
"He doesn't give a fuck about me. It's clear as day," Harry's sobbing came from a closed cubicle.
„Fuck, Draco,“ Harry gasped and searched frantically Draco‘s pockets. „Got it.“
They sat down on the dusty floor inside the chain circle, their knees touching.
"Get in the bath," Harry had to clear his throat twice to be able to speak.
"Potter, don't you fucking dare go out there alone," Malfoy ran after him. Harry thought he heard a tinge of panic in his voice but he dismissed it. Malfoy never cared a bit about him and he never would. Harry didn't understand why he felt hurt by that realization. It was just Malfoy, for God's sake.
"Suit yourself," Draco shrugged and unwrapped a square of pink bubble gum from a plastic wrapper. He chewed pensively.
"Thank you," Harry breathed out gratefully and Apparated to St. Mungo's.
Draco whimpered involuntarily. Potter turned to him, their faces suddenly too close. Draco cleared his throat. Potter bit his lip and smiled.
Harry ignored him. He rolled up his sleeves, got up to wash the mugs in the sink, and started drying them with a towel. Draco observed him silently, his eyes captivated by the flex of the muscles on Harry's forearms.
„Right, drinks. Would you like some wine, Pansy, Hermione?“ Harry offered hopefully.
"I might as well tell you. I'll be dead soon anyway," Malfoy utters those words flatly, without emotion. "I'm in love with you. I've been in love with you for a while."
"I'm trying to help you," Harry said soothingly.
"Purebloods," Harry rolled his eyes dramatically and sent a few diagnostic charms over the door and the handle, as he'd done with the back door. Just like before, the door was void of any curses and hexes. Harry spelled the spiderwebs away and reached for the handle. The door was stiff with rust and he had to bump his shoulder against the wood to get it to open. The hinges creaked ominously in the darkness, revealing two steps leading down, into the pitch-black cellar. The sound sent shivers up Harry's spine, and cold sweat ran down his temple. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw a movement to his right. He pivoted sharply on his heels, his eyes searching the darkness frantically, wand at the ready. There was nothing there. Then again, just as he started turning back toward the cellar door, he thought he saw a movement in the back foyer but when he trained his eyes on the spot, it was gone again. He realized he was breathing hard. He wiped his sweaty palms on his robes and looked back to the gaping dark hole in front of him.
Harry maneuvered him into a sitting position on a bar stool, rubbing his thumb along Draco's spine absentmindedly as he leaned over the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.
Instead of replying, Draco tore at the zipper of Potter's trousers and sneaked his hand inside. He grabbed Potter's cock in his hand and slid his thumb inside the slit. Potter's whole body jerked and a loud moan erupted from his throat.
"Hey, that's not fair," Harry punched his arm lightly. "Not everything I do ends up badly."
„I think I should punish you,“ Harry groaned loudly.
„By the way, mum invited you and Draco to the Saturday dinner,“ Ron said matter-of-factly.
“Oh, for fuck's sake, try to keep quiet, you moron. You almost gave me a heart attack,” Draco hissed. His voice sounded both irritated and relieved at the same time.
again.
"In your dreams Potter, I'd rather die a virgin than have you touch me," Draco pretended to gag.
"What… Draco, don't you remember that we…," dread flooded Harry's veins and he couldn't finish the sentence. He had to grab the arms of the chair for support.
"Here you go," Harry slid a bottle of some amber liquid in front of Draco with a grin. "Try this."
"You'll think of something, now go before I give your butt the kick it deserves," she smiled at him exasperatedly.
Harry grinned and the corners of his mouth twitched mischievously. "Play," his hand traveled down Draco's side.
Draco stepped inside the Leaky Cauldron warily. He recalled another reason why he wasn't keen on coming to the party. It would be full of Gryffindors. He spied Potter sitting in the booth, Weasley on his right side. There were Longbottom and Granger, Finnigan, and Thomas, too. The rest of the Weasley clan was seated on chairs on the other side of the table. Luna Lovegood was the only non-Gryffindor in the bunch. Draco nearly turned on his heel and fled but Potter had already spotted him and waved him over vehemently.
He would be embarrassed if Potter hadn't come at the same time Draco did. He pulled out of Potter, who fell fully onto the bed, heavy and dead to the world. Draco kneeled, propping his arse on the soles of his feet.
"How would you even know what my
Pansy immediately noticed the dark circles under his eyes, the wary expression on his face, the tired lines marring his pretty features that hadn't been there two weeks ago, when he left to visit his parents.
"What is it?" Draco asked, staring suspiciously at the beverage.
"I always knew Granger was smart," Malfoy chuckled. Harry felt his eyebrows disappear under his fringe at Malfoy's easy admission. Maybe he'd really changed for the better. Harry was certainly willing to believe it. People changed, so why couldn't Malfoy be a good person these days?
Draco relaxed his stiff shoulders. "It's just a Death-glow, Pansy," he breathed out. Death-glow was residual energy, appearing in places someone had died. The more violent the death, the stronger the light.
Harry shut his eyes tightly and counted to ten. When he opened his eyes again, his eyes confirmed that
„I will leave you to process the news. A nurse will be back later to administer a pain relief potion. You should be able to go home in the evening,“ the doctor said, then excused himself politely and left the room, closing the door silently behind him.
He looked his own reflection in the eyes. No more wallowing in self-pity, he decided. He wanted to solve the Problem, help Hermione raise the baby, fall in love with Draco and be with him if only Draco let him. Harry gulped and watched the reflection of his eyes slowly turn from wide and a little lost to determined. He was going to be strong for the people he loved. And he would do everything in his power to have it all.
Harry grabbed Tracey's wrist and pulled her back, away from prying eyes and ears, as they headed toward the Apparition point. "Be careful out there, Tracey. Stay close to me and if we get separated, send me a Patronus with your exact location the moment you see something suspicious."
"Don't overthink it," Harry whispered against Draco's skin. "I want to worship you tonight, I'm going to make you feel heavenly. I still can't believe I got you back. Promise me you'll be here in the morning."
„Hey, I‘m home,“ he called out on his way to the kitchen. Only silence greeted him. Weird, Harry thought. He grabbed a banana from a bowl on the kitchen counter, peeled it quickly, and stuffed half of it inside his mouth.
Harry's face was beetroot red by now.
They returned to the corridor and stopped in the centre of it, at the top of the stairs leading back to the ground floor. Draco looked up and groaned. The wooden rectangle on the ceiling above him gave him the creeps. There was a string affixed to one end. It dangled above Draco's head, in what he thought was rather a mocking irony.
"Ready for your next lesson, Potter?" Malfoy wiggled his eyebrows at Harry.
Blaise lifted his arms up in an I-give-up gesture. "My bad. I'll leave you two alone."
"Stay back," Harry warned him. "Defodio," Harry shouted.
"My thoughts exactly," Draco nodded approvingly. "We'll decide later on based on the temperature checks but so far, the ground floor looks safe. You know, you're surprisingly good at this. I'm glad you're here with me tonight."
They both staggered toward the stairs and Tracey started up first. The skin on Harry's back bristled with goosebumps. He felt the ghosts close behind him, reaching for him. He kept imagining their cold fingers would grab his ankles any second now. He shuddered and urged Tracey to run faster. Harry blindly threw another handful of salt across his shoulder, hoping to dissuade the ghosts from following them up. Finally, they reached the door to the foyer and slammed it shut behind them. Both Harry and Tracey were breathing hard. Harry felt cold sweat running down his temple.
"Shhh, it's going to be OK, everything's going to be alright, I promise," Harry kissed her temple and prayed it wasn't a lie.
"Run to the Entrance Hall," Draco shouted. "Now!"
„Then why are you crying, Harry?“ Narcissa asked. Her voice reminded Draco of his childhood. Narcissa used to use the same voice on him when he was sad. „I know he loves you very much and wants nothing more than to have you by his side.“
Next to him, he could feel Potter grin at the word associate and Draco had to fight off a fond smile of his own.
Draco's eyes involuntarily followed the movement of his tongue. "Right," he coughed.
"Harry," Draco begged him. "I've seen you looking much worse than this. I just want to hold you."
Harry panted loudly as anger reverberated through his whole body. How could Draco just stand there and lie straight to his face? It wasn‘t even a smart lie, such as Harry would expect from a Slytherin. It was a dumb lie, a stupid lie. Harry‘s hands formed fists, his fingernails drawing blood in half-circles across his palms. The sharp sting of pain helped him breathe. The anger slowly gave way to a different emotion. Dread. What had he done? Draco hadn't looked stunning the way he always did after sex. He looked awful, pale, his hair sticking in damp strands to his forehead, his face contorted in a grimace of pain. Why did Harry burst out like a bloody teenager, instead of facing the issue like a grown-up man? Like an Auror he was? Fuck, he was an idiot. He needed to see if Draco was OK. He was so stupid, he promised himself he would handle the situation calmly. And worse, he‘d promised Draco nothing would change the way he felt about him. Harry loved him. How could he have treated him this way without hearing his side of the story? Fuck, what if the person Ginny saw was not even Draco? Harry started shaking, this time not with anger, but with fear. He grabbed a pinch of Floo powder and threw it into the fireplace. He pronounced Draco‘s address as clearly as he could, considering his voice was trembling violently. Nothing happened.
"Right, go then. I don't want to keep you from going out to pull some other idiot so you can have your weekly fuck," Draco spat.
Even though she hadn't said anything, Harry knew she must be close to finding out the spell to extract the ectoplasm safely. He hadn't seen her this happy in a long while which surely meant she had been successful. Quite possibly, the spell was ready and Harry could test it on Wednesday with Draco on their first case together. Harry could barely contain his excitement as he sliced the chicken breast and plated it together with salad and potato mash. He still preferred deep-fried chicken and chips but Hermione insisted on eating healthy meals with the baby on the way.
„I‘m able to speak for myself, Potter,“ Draco huffed, then winced. He was clearly still in pain, even though it was receding if he was able to make brash remarks.
„Yes, yes, Harry, start fucking me already, fuck me hard as you can,“ Draco whined.
Harry crumpled above him with a shout and Draco tasted come on his tongue and in his throat. He sucked at Harry's softening prick, teasing his tongue around the tip. Harry wiggled above him, as his overly sensitive prick jerked.
"Please Harry. I will be dead in a few hours. I've never… I want to know what it's like when it's with someone... I want you to be the last person who touches me," his voice breaks, his body starts to tremble again.
It was Draco's time to gape at her. "I don't hate you. I haven't hated you for a long time. I can't take him with me because it's too dangerous. Believe what you will but I don't want him getting hurt. I don't want anyone getting hurt ever again," Draco sounded frustrated even to himself. "Potter is like that mad Bludger that kept chasing him around the Quidditch pitch in the second year. He's unpredictable and reckless. I can't take him with me because I know he wouldn't listen to me. Hunting ghosts isn't fun, it's not glorious. I will not watch him die just because he's too stubborn to gulp down his pride and follow my lead."
„Yes, Master Harry?“ Kreacher replied, not masking his annoyance.
"OK," Harry whispers and gets up. He crosses the room and picks up the discarded vial. There is some oil left in it still. He sits gingerly back on the cot. "I won't hurt you, I promise."
„I once set a snake against my cousin,“ Harry smiled, the memory of Dudley falling on his fat arse. Uncle Vernon‘s face had been so purple it looked like it was going to explode any second.
Harry was sure he didn't imagine Malfoy's deep growl. It sent another wave of blood in a rush into his cock. Harry fought the urge to touch himself right then. He wiggled in his seat, hoping the movement would alleviate the tightness in his trousers but somehow made everything even worse. Harry contemplated straddling Malfoy's lap and thrusting against his groin until they both came in their pants. The idea was preposterous and yet strangely alluring.
"Are you serious?" Harry beamed at Draco.
„Oh God, yes!“ Harry‘s eyes were roaming all over Draco‘s half-covered body.
Draco's eyes widened the moment he realized what Harry was saying. He started laughing hard, wheezing as he tried to breathe in, trying to imagine the scene in his mind. "Shut the fuck up! Did you throw up on him? You did, didn't you?"
„Are you real or am I still dreaming?“, Harry asked still half asleep, a happy smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
Harry and Draco finally come out as a couple to their friends. The way they go about is a bit unorthodox. But as Harry pointed out, sometimes it's better to throw oneself into something rather than ease in, however, it might have been an innuendo of sorts.
"Morning, Sleeping Beauty," Draco lifted an eyebrow. "Maybe you'd like to help me out now?"
„I think Weasley is broken, Harry,“ Draco closed the distance between them, hugging him from behind. Draco‘s smirk was tangible as he leaned in and inhaled the smell of Harry‘s hair. The fresh scent of cedar, rosemary, and grapefruit of Harry‘s favourite perfume wafted in Draco‘s nostrils. He loved the way the perfume smelled on Harry. It made him want to rip all of Harry‘s clothes off and devour him. That was the reason why he‘d picked it out for Harry on one of his adventures to the jungle that was the Muggle London shopping malls.
Tracey was still frozen in shock, staring blankly before her.
Draco scanned the temperature by the first door and quickly glanced inside."Ten degrees, the room seems clear," Draco whispered.
"Alright, here we go," Draco whispered. He seemed alert, his eyes darting back and forth across the courtyard they were standing in. "We go in, and I will scan the temperature in the foyer quickly. Meanwhile, you're going to set up the protective circle near the entrance."
"Kreacher is very old, in case dim-witted Master Harry forgot," Kreacher scowled at him.
And then you came along. I still remember the night we met in that bar vividly. I remember every detail when I saw you standing there, with a glass of bourbon, observing the crowd. You were like a beacon of light, I was drawn to you, I couldn't keep my eyes off of you. Yet, I would have never approached you on my own. I felt raw, vulnerable, too scared to open myself to potential pain (yes, I thought you would taunt me and call me names and you would end up cutting me deeper than anyone I knew ever managed). But you never did. You sat down next to me and gave me that look. I think I was in love with you since that moment. It was then that I felt myself fall. Fall into your eyes. You were the first person in my life who saw me for who I really am. You helped me gather up the courage to start a new period of my life.
Kreacher made a show of looking around. „Kreacher does not see Master Draco. Kreacher concludes Master Draco is not here.“
Maybe… Ron would still be there with her.
„I hate you, Potter,“ Draco lifted his chin arrogantly.
"Sorry," Hermione had the decency to blush. "Sometimes it's just too much, you know? Too much stress, trying to figure this bloody Problem out. Not to mention I'm swollen like a balloon and tired all the time."
"Two or three Aurors I think. Wait, you spoke to Ginny?" Draco looked at him suspiciously.
„You won‘t,“ Harry tore his gaze from Draco‘s arse and looked him straight in the eye. His expression was so sincere and full of conviction that the dark tendril of fear residing permanently in Draco‘s chest unwound and dispersed like a mist in the morning sun.
"Of course, anything Master Draco needs," Kreacher barreled in through the door, wheezing slightly. He looked up at Draco, his eyes wide and earnest in his weathered face.
"Spit it out," Harry said as soon as she settled down in her chair.
Harry took a tentative step forward and placed his hand gently between Draco's shoulder blades. Draco flinched but didn't pull away. Harry started rubbing small circles into his back.
Tracey shook her head in bewilderment and looked at Harry. Her gaze drifted over his shoulder and she shrieked, her face pale in the light of Harry's wand. She was trembling.
"I didn't…" Potter trailed off, unsure how to continue. "Look, we're partners, whether you like it or not. I'm here if you need someone to talk to. I'm sure we can manage to hold a civil conversation for once."
Harry stuffed his mouth full of chicken and chewed it for as long as possible in order to avoid answering. Hermione's gaze never wavered and he felt it drilling into him.
„Come on, Potter, today,“ Draco groaned.
"Is that what you would have wanted for her? Living with someone who would never love her that way? I'm gay for fuck's sake! I couldn't even get my dick up for her most of the time," Harry barked out. He tasted blood in his mouth, the coppery tang of it felt oddly soothing as he swallowed it and he welcomed the sting of his broken lip.
Draco eyed him warily. Potter was definitely behaving very strangely. Draco would have to try to peak into his medical records. Even though he rather enjoyed having Potter as a partner, he didn't think it was safe if Potter suddenly suffered from dementia.
"Sorry, you're right," Draco interrupted him. "You weren't screaming. You were wailing. Truly pitiful, Potter."
Harry wheeled around, his eyes desperately seeking Montague and McLaggen. A medi-wizard was placing white linen over their bodies. Harry tore his arm out of Robards's grasp and ran toward the medi-wizard.
"I love you, Draco," Harry whispers.
"I know," Harry nodded and sighed.
"Draco doesn't have a fucking hour," Harry pulled at his hair angrily. "I'm going back to the door."
„Let me lift you up, let me help you,“ Harry choked out through tears welling up in his eyes. He could barely speak over the lump that had formed in his throat. He loathed seeing Draco in so much pain. He hated himself for being responsible for Draco fainting in his own vomit, all alone. Harry wished he had a Time-Turner so that he could go back to when Draco stumbled in pain through the fireplace in Grimmauld Place.
"Well, I was thinking you could watch while I wank," Harry smirked mischievously.
"Oh, he told me. And you know what? It's a mad idea, it's not safe to use magic around ghosts. It's like a magnet to them. If you cast a spell in their vicinity, they will trail you until sunrise or until you get far enough from their Source. I watched too many people lose their lives and I will not watch another one die just to test some stupid theory," Draco sneered.
Harry stood frozen for a few seconds, unable to comprehend what had just happened. Why was Draco meeting secretly with someone in dark alleys? What was going on? Harry started pacing, kicking the trash lying around angrily. What should he do now? How should he ask Draco what the suspicious meeting was about without giving away he"d followed him? Harry‘s stomach lurched. He‘d been in a relationship with Draco for three months now and he never noticed anything odd. How long was this going on? And what was „this“ exactly. Harry‘s thoughts started wandering in a direction he didn‘t want to examine in detail for the moment. Was Draco‘s love even real or did he start the relationship because of some ominous goal he was trying to achieve? Harry started breathing fast.
„What the fuck?“ Ron exclaimed the second as he opened the door.
Nothing happened. The spell seemed to dissipate without ever reaching the ghost. The wind around them picked up, beating at their faces, making Draco's coat flap around his feet loudly. The ghost lifted a hand. It seemed to curiously investigate the barrier the iron chains had provided. The hand pushed. Draco could almost feel the ward pushing back. He wasn't worried the protection wouldn't hold. Chains were failproof as opposite to iron filings.
"Yes, you git. It's always been you. I'm kind of in love with you, in case you haven't noticed," Potter smiled softly and captured Draco's mouth with his in a kiss that swept Draco off his feet. Potter licked along Draco's lower lip and pulled it in his mouth. He sucked at it as if it was the sweetest lollipop. Draco snuck his tongue inside Potter's mouth and allowed himself to drown in the taste of Potter. He wasn't scared anymore.
They entered Harry's bedroom and Harry wandlessly lit a dozen candles that were stationed around the room. There was a large four-poster bed that dominated the room and a long mirror that sat opposite the bed, next to a large wardrobe. The walls were painted white except the one behind the bed, which was decorated with wallpaper of a beautiful design. It looked like a teal-and-gold gemstone. The teal sheets on the bed matched the wallpaper perfectly.
"I'll tell you in the morning," Harry's voice shook and he hated himself for it. He didn't want to worry Hermione, with the birth term still two months away. "Please go back to sleep."
They were both naked again, their cheeks tinged with red, their hair sweaty and plastered to their face from their favourite morning activity.
„How many times do I have to tell them that any changes in potion recipes need to be tested safely in a laboratory environment before trying them on living subjects?“ Draco ranted. „Who knows what would have happened, had the healers from St Mungo‘s not contacted us on time.“
Harry's head whipped up. "Do you want to stop? Is this too fast for you?"
"What makes you think I made this specifically for you?" Malfoy scoffed. "It's the standard edition of our Ghost Hunter's Guide."
"Don't say things you don't mean," Draco breathed out. He needed to be sure he was reading Potter's signs correctly. Draco was attracted to him, and he couldn't stop thinking about what it would be like to kiss him and maybe do more than just kissing, but he would never open himself to a one-night stand. If anything was to happen, Draco needed to be sure it would lead to more.
Harry winced. He had a blast during his stay in Chicago for the internship in the branch of MACUSA Robards had arranged for him but he missed Britain and he missed his Auror partner, Draco Malfoy, even more. Not only because after the nine months since they'd been partnered they were on the verge of becoming friends, but also because worked damn well as a team. Another reason, infinitely small one, was that Harry had sort of a crush on Malfoy. Teensy-weensy crush… of epic proportions. It wasn't Harry's fault, not really. It was not his fault Malfoy was gorgeous, all pale and blond and piercing grey eyes. And it was definitely not Harry's fault he sometimes sneaked a peek at Malfoy's work-of-art arse in the showers after a grueling case.
Draco closed his eyes and waited. There was the softest feel of Harry's hot breath against his skin, then even softer press of Harry's lips against his, gone in an instant. A thousand butterflies fluttered in Draco's stomach as he brought his fingers up and pressed them against his lips. His eyes flew open and he stared at Harry in astonishment. It was barely a kiss and yet it was the best kiss he'd ever had. Harry's gaze was wild, hopeful, and scared at the same time. He was biting his bottom lip vigorously and Draco felt an urge to sink his own teeth into the abused flesh.
"Creevey," Robards replied warily.
"You what?" Hermione gasped.
"I'm going to make us coffee. Sugar, milk, or both?" Malfoy offered.
Malfoy's face twists with an emotion Harry is not quite able to identify. "I hoped you would be able to escape."
"Homo what?" Harry frowned, momentarily distracted.
"I love you too, Harry," Draco blew him a kiss and winked at him playfully.
„Draco, I know you hate me right now but don‘t let that have an effect on your health, please. At least let me take you to the hospital to make sure this is not something serious. And when you‘re feeling better, you can shout at me all you want. I really wish you would shout at me and tell me what an idiot I am. I deserve that and more because honest to God I hate myself right now. I understand if you never forgive me because I will never forgive myself. I just wanted to tell you that I will be here for you. I will stand by you and help you figure this out, whatever is happening to you. I will be here for you as much as you let me. And once you‘re back to full health and decide you want me to leave, I will. You will never have to see me again. You will never have to hear from me if that‘s what you want. Just let me help you through this,“ Harry whispered beseechingly, his voice breaking several times.
"We broke up," Potter shrugged carelessly. "Why are you asking? Wait, are you jealous?"
Draco drew away and looked deep into Harry's eyes. "Come to bed."
Harry sighed. "I'm sorry Draco, I didn't mean it. It was a joke. A very dumb joke at that. I'm sorry if you thought otherwise."
Harry gently pried his wrist out of Draco's grasp. "Excuse me, I need to go to the toilet."
As soon as the door closed behind their client, Potter turned to Draco with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes. "He was awfully defensive when you asked him about a possible murder, don't you think?"
Harry steeled himself and asked the question that had been nagging at him for the whole day. "Are you then?"
"I like the way you think," Draco grinned. "Go on then, Potter, stop dawdling and get on with it." Draco turned around in the bath so he could watch Harry.
"Harry, you are fixated on the theory that Malfoy's kidnapping is connected to you coming out as a couple. What if it's not? What if it's completely unrelated? We have to explore all the possibilities. We have to make sure we haven't overlooked anything. You know that Harry, you're the best Auror we've had on the force in a long time. You know I'm going to recommend you for the position of Head Auror once I retire. Don't let the fact that this case is personal mar the excellent instincts you have shown so far," Robards continued.
"Good," Draco answered earnestly. "How about you show me your bedroom?"
"What is it? What happened?" Hermione pressed on.
"Alright, we're on a tight schedule here. Pansy, you go to the library, as usual. Try both wizarding and Muggle libraries this time. Find out the full history of Mr. Gladstone's Bed & Breakfast since the day it has been built. Mark anything suspicious for us. Disappearances. Suspicious deaths. Murders. Potter, you and I have some more studying to do, we only have today afternoon and tomorrow morning for you to memorize all the rules and equipment. Plus, we still have to cover the ghost types. Tuesday afternoon's for our rapier practice," Draco couldn't help but smirk at Potter's excited nodding. His eyes were huge in a way that Draco tried not to find endearing but failed spectacularly.
Pansy was there in a second, her hand a warm presence against the small of Draco's back.
"Wouldyouliketodancewithme?" Harry babbled and trained his puppy eyes at Draco.
"Yes," Draco breathed out.
"You're incredible," he whispered, got up, and left.
Draco didn't reply, he didn't want his voice to betray the state of mind he was in, wallowing in self-pity.
"Draco, where are you going? It's not like that, not really. Yes, I fucked up but I've been trying to talk to you about it since yesterday! If only you'd let me explain," Harry begged him.
„I mean look at him,“ Harry exclaimed. „The way his hair falls in his face is so annoying. Why can‘t he wear it like in the second year, it was so ugly, slicked back and shiny and all.“
A gentle hand landed on his shoulder. Harry didn't stop crawling until Tracey kneeled in front of him and their eyes meet. Tracey shook her head resignedly and a tear streaked down her cheek. Harry could see the truth reflected in her eyes. He'd been too late. McLaggen and Montague died because Harry hadn't reached them on time. Harry let Tracey wrap him in her arms. He let her stroke his back in comforting circles. She was warm. Harry could feel his body starting to shake uncontrollably but his mind was numb.
Malfoy grabbed Harry by the elbow and squeezed hard. "Hold on tight," he spat and Side-Alonged Harry back to the Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. headquarters.
"Because I don't love him anymore," Draco sobbed.
Harry plucked the wand out of this hand and cast a silencing and locking charm in quick succession.
Draco wished Theo was here now instead of Pansy. She didn't have much experience in the field and even though she followed his orders well, he never felt truly comfortable with her guarding his back. Theo, on the other hand, was like his shadow. They were always aware of each other's position, anticipating each other's actions and movements. Sometimes Draco felt as if they could read each other's minds without the use of Legilimency. He missed Theo and hoped he would be back soon.
"You're going to sing?" Draco's eyebrows shot up and disappeared under his fringe. "You hate giving speeches in public. I guess I presumed you would hate singing too."
"Yes, more," Potter wheezed.
"I couldn't sleep alone tonight, I'm sorry to wake you. Go back to sleep," Harry whispered. He felt selfish. Hermione could barely get enough sleep these nights as it was and he interrupted the bit of sleep she was able to steal.
Pansy threw herself around Theo's neck, nearly sending them both sprawling on the floor. She wrapped her arms around his neck and squeezed him tightly. "I'm so glad you're back, I missed you so much!"
"Alpha, Niffler, have you encountered any signs of human activity yet? Curses, hexes, protective wards? Anything?" Harry asked quietly.
"Falcon, I found footprints in the back foyer, my estimation is at least three months old," Harry reported to Robards through the Listening Spell.
Harry knew he had to act fast, the longer he stayed in the room, the higher the chance of never leaving it alive. Harry dropped the salt back inside his pocket and fumbled for the adrenaline shot he'd kept at all times in a loop at his belt. He drew it out, tore Montague's robes off his chest, and stabbed the needle directly into his heart. He patted Montague's robes and finally found the emergency portkey pinned to the lapel of his shirt. He activated it and relief surged through him. Montague was safe, he was in St Mungo's now.
Pansy could feel it now that Draco brought her attention to it. Tendrils of rage were sneaking all around them, nudging at their skin as if tasting it. Pansy shivered involuntarily. If Potter survived the night, Pansy was going to kill him herself for making her come here. What had Potter done to make the house feel like this?
Potter," Draco sneered.
„I have to admit,“ Draco smiled at Harry while cleaning up the glasses and plates. „Your plan worked out rather well, didn‘t it?“
Two hours later, Harry‘s feet were hurting from having to stand still. His back itched but he didn‘t dare scratch himself as the sound would surely attract Draco‘s attention.
"It's about Potter," Draco said matter-of-factly.
„I have to get you up, baby. I will Apparate us to St Mungo‘s but your Floo is locked and I can‘t get through the wards,“ Harry‘s cheeks were wet with tears, his eyes blurry and he couldn‘t see much. This was all his fault. He wanted to smash his head against the nearest hard surface but he had to stay strong. Draco needed him and he had to help him. „I have to carry you outside to be able to Apparate. I am so sorry, Draco. Please hold on, I promise it will be over soon, you just have to hold on a bit longer, OK?“
Pansy grumbled something under her breath and picked up the
Harry roams his eyes across the planes of Draco's chest, his narrow hips, his flaccid cock, lying against his stomach. He bends down and places a soft kiss on the tip of it. He hears a sharp intake of breath above him and gazes at Draco questioningly.
„Master Harry is more stupid than Kreacher had believed possible,“ Kreacher shook his head sadly, his ears flapping loudly. „Why does not Master Harry use the house key Master Draco gave him? Kreacher believes scatter-brained Master Harry keeps it in his night table.“
"You are here for me, as much as I'm here for you," Harry whispered and ran his fingers through her hair reassuringly. "I'll always be here for you."
"It's OK, Draco, it's safe, can't you feel it?" Pansy looked at him over his shoulder. She was standing on the threshold, one foot already in the room. She stretched her arm in an invitation, for Draco to take it as if to pull him inside the room after her.
„What I‘m trying to say is that I am ready. I want to take the next step. I want to take you out, hold your hand while we walk in the park, kiss you while shopping in Diagon Alley. I want to show everyone that I am the luckiest person on earth because such a wonderful person as yourself wants to spend their time with me,“ Harry searched Draco‘s face as he whispered those words. Harry felt Draco‘s whole body tighten under him and his heart felt as if stabbed by a dagger. Draco lay rigid, his platinum hair mussed from their earlier feigned fight, his face becoming a blank mask. Harry wanted to kick himself mentally for even having started this conversation. What if Draco didn‘t want him like that? What if he never wanted to be seen with Harry in public? What if he was ashamed of their relationship? What if he told him that he didn‘t love Harry as much as Harry loved him? Or worse yet, what if Draco didn‘t love him at all and only pretended all the time because the sex was mindblowing? After several painful, ragged breaths, Harry started stammering, forgetting his speech completely.
"Sir, does that mean?" Malfoy asked hesitantly, hope evident in his voice.
„Hey, we need to talk,“ Harry said quietly, trying to be reasonable.
Draco frowned. He couldn't possibly imagine why Granger would smile at him that way, especially after he refused to help Potter and therefore indirectly her as well. He shook his head. "I'm here to talk about Potter."
"I still find it disconcerting you know so many Muggle terms. It's pretty weird if I'm being honest," Harry shook his head.
He crossed the room and kissed Draco fiercely. He slid his hands under Draco‘s cashmere sweater to caress the soft skin on his lower back.
"Well, you must have done something, he called you an obtrusive git," Draco supplied.
The shadows around them deepened, crawling from the corners of the room toward the center, obscuring the windows and therefore the only source of faint illumination they had. Soon, they were left completely in darkness. Draco pulled a flashlight from his shoulder holster, lighting it in the process. He whirled around, surveying his surroundings quickly. Pansy followed his lead and lit her flashlight as well.
"Prat," Harry muttered under his breath and resumed his ascent.
"I think, you are still in love with Harry. I find that understandable, who wouldn't be in love with him. I mean look at him, he's rather spectacular," Draco bit his lip seductively and let his eyes roam hotly over Harry's body. "However, I find your affections rather pathetic, given Harry's as bent as they go. Even if Harry broke up with me, he would never go back to you. Thats' why you made that story up, isn't it? Because you thought you could force him back into your arms?"
"Harry," Draco whispered and dropped his head on Harry's shoulder and snuggled his face against his neck, breathing erratically.
Why would Potter buy him presents? He'd accidentally overheard Potter's and Weasley's conversation during lunch the day before Potter left, not that Draco was snooping or anything. Potter clearly said that he could not work with Draco anymore. That every minute alone with him in the office was pure torture. Weasley had replied that some time away might do him some good. Why was Potter suddenly pretending to be friends again?
Draco peeked gingerly into the plastic bag Potter had thrust into his hand. There were dozens of different American sweets, wrapped in colourful packaging. Draco fished around in the bag and pulled out a navy blue Muggle hoodie with CHICAGO printed in large white block letters on the back. There was also a kitsch souvenir of something that distantly reminded Draco of a silver Bertie Bott's Jelly Bean.
„Draco,“ Harry began uncertainly.
Draco fired another Stupefy at the wizard and saw him go down. Shouts echoed from the direction of the Vaults entrance.
At this, Harry's fingers began stroking Draco's spine tentatively, running over the niches and hills of his vertebrae. "Then, one day, you decide to play the piano again. You sit down and spread your fingers across the keys," Harry's fingers stilled in their position. He licked Draco's earlobe and whispered. "And then you start playing, your fingers fly across the keys, the melody as beautiful and as sweet as ever." Harry's fingers flew across Draco's spine, caressing it, his movements slow, then fast, then pausing, picking up speed again.
"Oh, yeah," Harry sighed and smiled sadly. "I'm sorry, I guess you'll want it back, now that… I shouldn't have worn it but I couldn't help myself. It still smells like you."
"Good morning, Brook," Draco smiled at her smugly.
"That was fun," Potter shuddered visibly.
Potter mumbled something, that sounded suspiciously like pretentious wanker, under his breath.
Greyback is holding Draco up in the air by his neck, claws threatening to puncture the soft beautiful skin Harry has traced with his fingers just moments before. Draco's legs kick in the air defenselessly.
"No, Brook. I… I'm not feeling too well. I will be taking another day off today," he replied, trying to hide the tremble in his voice.
"Fuck," Potter cursed under his breath.
„Fuck you!“ Harry shouted and stormed out of the Great Hall.
"How's my favourite Ferret doing?" Ron pinched Draco's cheek, reminding him of Mrs. Weasley. His voice was but a hoarse rasp and he was completely sloshed.
Harry‘s Floo chimed. Harry was definitely not in the mood for visitors. He‘d taken a long, hot shower and pondered how to talk to Draco once he got home from work. The Floo chimed again.
"What about the old ghosts?" Potter asked all of a sudden. "You know what I mean. Bloody Baron, Nearly Headless Nick, Peeves. What happened to them?"
"I wish you could save me," Malfoy's reply is barely audible and Harry has to strain his ears to hear him.
„At least 10 minutes I think,“ Harry breathed out. His head was spinning because all the blood had suddenly moved to his nether region. Within seconds, his cock was almost hard. He could feel Draco‘s erection pressing against his stomach.
„I will wait until you are ready, I promise,“ Harry breathed out in desperation. He didn‘t want Draco‘s pity. He didn‘t want to hear that Draco didn‘t want their relationship to be serious. Harry didn‘t want to hear Draco utter those words Harry was so scared of. I don‘t want you.
"Auror Potter, I am sorry but I cannot endorse such behaviour. We need to follow protocol," Kingsley insisted.
"Please send the next client in, Ms. Parkinson," a familiar voice rang from inside one of the offices.
Harry crossed the room, lifted Draco's leg up, and placed it gently onto his lap. He started massaging Draco's foot. As always, Draco had kicked off his shoes and socks as soon as his feet hit the floor of their home.
No words can express how ashamed I am for not being able to control myself better. I can only promise you that I will do everything in my power not to behave like that ever again. I have decided that once we find out who is hurting you, and they are safely locked up in Azkaban, I will start going to therapy.
"Creevey," Robards replied warily.
"Oh, I'm good, thank you. I was actually thinking we could talk in private," Ginny turned her disbelieving gaze at Harry.
"Harry, help me out here a bit, mate," Ron turned to him pleadingly.
Draco pouted. "I hate it when you sound reasonable. You're supposed to be the reckless one."
"No. No, I want you," he shakes his head resolutely.
He pressed his palm against Draco's cheek gently and lifted up his face so that their eyes met. "You're so much more. Come on, I need to show you something."
"No one forced you to steal my drink," Draco scoffed. He knew the beer was revolting and he definitely didn't need another reminder.
and how the government didn't have things under control, you see? That's when I realized…" Mr. Gladstone's fingers twisted, knuckles white, around the handle of the teacup Pansy had brought in. There was a pause before he continued. "I only saw it once, the ghost I mean. It was about two weeks after the first death, roaming the upper corridor of the house."
"Oh, he's still pretty much an arrogant prat," Harry laughed. "Only, he's different too. I think deep down, he cares about other people, maybe too much, but he doesn't want anyone to see it. I think he's afraid of getting hurt. I have a feeling he went through something really bad. Something to do with the ghosts."
„Shit, I don‘t have time for this,“ Harry muttered under his breath. „Accio Draco‘s house key!“ he shouted.
"Of course I was," Potter bristled. "I know what a flashlight is. I just wanted to know what it's for!"
Draco sat down behind his office desk tiredly. He couldn't stand a minute longer in the void of his flat. He couldn't bear walking mindlessly through those empty rooms, wondering if he and Potter… Harry had ever made love in them, and what it must have been like to hold Harry in his arms. Had they laughed together or did they fight all the time? What had it been like, to run his fingers across the soft-looking skin, to kiss those rosy lips? Draco was slowly driving himself mad. He wanted to remember. He wanted nothing more than to remember his first date with Harry, the first time they'd kissed, the first time they'd made love. But it was all gone. Forever.
"Twat, how creative," Draco said mockingly.
"Bloody Ferret," Ron whispered under his breath.
„Shhhh, let me take care of you. Let me worship you, and once you come in my mouth or on my face or wherever you want to, we will talk, OK?“ Draco whispered against Harry‘s skin, relishing in the goosebumps his tongue and words had caused. He bit Harry‘s neck where it met the shoulder and held the skin and flesh in his teeth. It always worked on Harry. Draco felt him relax and melt into the mattress as if he was boneless.
Draco bit his lip unconsciously. Was Potter flirting with him or was it just Draco's wishful thinking? Draco gulped and picked up his courage. He pitched his voice lower. "What
Draco took her hand and felt the presence in his mind tremble expectantly, lulling him gently back into the feeling of harmlessness. Draco steeled his mind, sharpening it. He erected a quick shield between his mind and the tendrils of the presence trying to overpower him. He didn't use Occlumency, as it would draw the attention of ghosts but he built a wall with the sheer strength of his will. He pushed with his mind against the presence at the same time he pulled on Pansy's hand. She stumbled toward him and Draco caught her in his arms.
„I don‘t know, I was a bit worried, to be honest. You never work this late,“ Harry said quietly.
"I want you inside me," Potter grabbed Draco's other hand and started pulling him towards the bedroom. It was a bit awkward as Draco wouldn't let go of Potter's cock. He'd spent endless nights imagining what it would be like to have Potter's prick in the palm of his hand, in his mouth, in his arsehole, and now that he was holding it, he would not let go easily.
Harry circles Draco's rim with his thumb, observing Draco's face cautiously. He keeps the movement steady, slow, and loving. He runs his free hand over Draco's flank and kisses his inner thigh softly. The expression on Draco's face slowly melts from fear to trust. Harry ever so slowly eases a finger inside Draco's hole. Draco shudders but not from pain. He's still loose from before but Harry doesn't want to think about that. He eases a second finger in and moves in and out, keeping the steady rhythm from before. He finds Draco's prostate and runs the tips of his fingers over it repeatedly. Draco's spine bows and Harry can't stop drinking in the sight of the beautiful boy in front of him, he wants to sear it into his memory forever.
"You have the best ideas, every once in a while," Harry replied teasingly, his voice but a hoarse whisper from all the shouting. His knees buckled and Draco caught him reflexively. Harry smiled up at him and pressed his forehead against Draco‘s shoulder. „In a minute, when I can walk?“
"A piano," Harry breathed out and squeezed Draco's prick.
"Fuck, we need to find them," Harry shouted.
„That‘s why you love me so much,“ Draco waved his arm stoically while observing Harry from the corner of his eye.
Harry didn't care who saw him, he didn't care that the Aurors and medi-wizards streaming inside the warehouse were staring at him. A wave of despair crashed through him. He fell on his knees, hid his face in his palms, and wept.
"The fuck you have to," Harry scowled. "Draco has not been involved in any nefarious dealings or whatever you've just suggested."
Draco chuckled but relented. He Accioed a jar of lube and quickly coated his dick with a generous layer of it.
When he relatively calmed down, he explained to her the events that lead to his memory loss, as he'd pieced them together from his memories of waking up tied to a chair in an abandoned warehouse, to his hospital stay. He told her what the doctors had said and what his mother had told him about his relationship with Harry.
"Come away with me," Draco whispered. He didn't know why he blurted it out so suddenly but he knew he needed to be alone with Harry. He wanted to get to know him better desperately.
"Wanker," Potter grumbled but dropped his hands into his lap.
Harry stumbled through the Floo into Hermione's living room. It was past midnight and the flat was dark and silent. Harry turned on the lights immediately, hating the darkness after the events in the cellar of the mansion. He ran his hands across his face tiredly and sighed. He'd showered at home, changed into his pajamas, and then went straight here. He needed the comfort of another living person. Harry always slept on the sofa when he stayed over but this time he couldn't bear the thought of being alone. He crossed the living room and the corridor and quietly opened the door to Hermione's bedroom. Harry turned on the lamp that stood on the bedside table and slid under the covers as gently as he could. His careful movements woke Hermione up anyway.
Draco closed his eyes for a minute and tried to make sense of what the doctor had just told him. He heard Harry shuffle closer and opened his eyes.
"Can you at least tell me who you are? I would love to know how I've managed to offend you," Draco sneered. "You're going to Obliviate me anyway, aren't you, so why not tell me?"
„Oh God,“ Harry‘s voice hitched. He grabbed Draco‘s butt eagerly and started kneading it between his palms. He wrapped his arms securely around Draco‘s body and stood up with Drhim still in his arms. Draco bit his neck and Harry groaned. He couldn‘t believe how horny Draco made him feel all the bloody time. He nearly threw Draco on the desktop and started fumbling with the buttons of his trousers. Draco started tugging at his own trousers and pants impatiently.
"I love you, Draco, I love you so much. I swear I will make whoever did this to you pay, they will rot in Azkaban for what they did to you," Harry whispered roughly.
„How long ago did you start noticing these symptoms?“ the medi-witch asked.
"I know," she sniffed. "But that's not what I meant and you know it."
Harry nodded and gratefully climbed into the bed next to Draco. „Does it hurt?“ he asked.
"Ouch, what was that for?" Draco hissed and batted Harry's wand away.
Harry had moved lower, he was running his tongue across Draco's abs, nearing his crotch. Harry's tongue sent sparks into Draco's prick and his head was spinning again from breathing too shallow and too fast. Draco felt he would faint any second from the pure excitement of having Harry touch him.
Draco couldn't help himself. He had to stare at that beautiful face only inches from his own. Potter's eyes sparkled with mirth and Draco's breath caught in his chest. Something must have crossed his eyes because Potter's expression changed, becoming serious. His eyes had gone dark and flicked to Draco's lips.
"Auror Potter," Robards said quietly. His voice held a tinge of warning. "Do not threaten me in my office. I don't give a damn if you're Harry Potter or Godric Gryffindor himself. You will follow the chain of command and I will certainly not play favourites with you. If you don't like it, the door is over there."
„Are you close? Please be close,“ Harry gritted through clenched teeth.
Draco sniffed theatrically and wiped an imaginary tear off of his cheek with his thumb.
(See the end of the chapter for
„Good morning,“ Harry greeted Ron brightly as he entered their shared Auror office.
Harry led Draco to the bathroom. He was blushing slightly and fidgeted with the collar of his shirt. He opened the door gingerly and let Draco step in first.
"You killed my beloved Nagini, you destroyed my painstakingly created Horcruxes. No wand will save you now. I'm going to destroy you once and for all, Harry Potter. Avada Kedavra!" Voldemort shouts spitefully.
„I asked you what you were planning to do to Malfoy this time,“ Ron gave him a wary look. „You‘ve been staring at him for the past twenty minutes at least. Even Slughorn noticed you weren‘t paying any attention to your potion and that‘s saying something.“
Harry bolted out through the portrait hole and ran fast but quietly to the abandoned room on the fourth floor.
"OK, I'll do it," Harry heard Draco say through the open door to the dining room.
The feel of the sticky warmth filling him tipped Harry over the edge as well, his own come painting his sweaty stomach in stripes of white. He slumped in his position, nearly toppling over. Draco caught him and pressed him against his chest.
"For fuck's sake Ron, are you really that thick? I can't change this, I can't change who I am!" Harry rolled his eyes mockingly, to stress how stupid he thought Ron was being. He needed Ron to punch him again, wanted more of the physical pain.
"Yeah," Harry groaned. Neither he nor Draco was into pain or bondage in the bedroom but right here, right now, the sharp burn of the skin on his butt, where Draco had spanked him, was perfect. Harry's whole body convulsed as the crack of another three slaps echoed in the room in quick succession. The sharp sting and burn in the places where Draco had just smacked him made his prick painfully hard. He started rutting against the silk sheets, seeking a reprieve from the arousal burning in his blood.
"What the hell just happened?" Draco whispered under his breath.
Harry was taken aback. Surprised, he sat up straighter in his chair. "Are you actually worried about me?"
"You shave?" Draco's mouth watered at the sight of Harry's nearly smooth crotch.
It was past eight when Draco stepped through the Floo back to Grimmauld Place. He was infinitely grateful to his mother for the talk they'd had. Narcissa tried to make Draco see the problem from all angles. She encouraged Draco to try to imagine being in Harry's shoes. How would Draco feel, how would he behave? What Harry did was wrong and there was no excuse but she'd smiled at Draco and told him that all relationships had hardships. When she saw Harry in the hospital, distressed and in panic, she knew he loved Draco deeply. Now it was up to both of them to make the best of the mistakes they made. If Harry understood what he'd done wrong and wanted to atone, it meant he truly loved Draco. However, if he dismissed his actions and started behaving that way repeatedly, Draco should get out of such a relationship. It would mean Harry didn't truly love him and therefore the relationship would not be worth continuous pain on Draco's part. Narcissa had smiled at him and said that that was not the case of their Harry for sure. Draco's heart leaped at the words. Their Harry.
"Pans, chuck some salt bombs at the Spectres, then we're out of here," Draco clapped her shoulder quickly and they both joined Potter in the circle. Draco immediately left it again and headed toward the front door, which was closed shut. Draco remembered leaving it open and a shiver ran through him. He felt as if the mansion around him gathered a second breath. The air was heavy with it. Draco couldn't describe it in any other way.
"But why?" Harry presses him.
"Thank God you're awake, I thought I'd lost you," Potter sounded relieved.
"What?" Draco snickered. He couldn't understand a word.
"You do realize I've just insulted you, don't you?" Draco asked dubiously.
„Potter, it seems you can‘t stop staring at me. It makes me wonder why,“ Malfoy sneered.
Draco knew something was very wrong. For some reason, Harry was hurting. Draco felt warmth spread through him when he realized Harry had come for comfort to him first. A second later he was horrified because he'd let Harry down. Draco decided that someone needed to give Harry a hug right that moment. Ron was out of the question, swaying to the song with Pansy in his arms, too drunk to notice his best friend's suffering. Blaise did go after Harry but they had never been too close. Draco knew he himself was the best choice to console Harry anyway. He sighed and wound his way through the dancing couples. He opened the door to the Gents gingerly. Two voices carried over to him.
„Look, just forget I said anything, OK?“ Harry said with a dangerous glint in his eyes.
"As I said before, we're both idiots. Now, you have years of sex to catch up on and you have to figure out if you prefer topping or bottoming. Are you up for it?" Harry quirked his eyebrow in an imitation of Draco's signature expression.
Harry only nodded. The sky was being spliced with lightning every few seconds. Draco knew the flashes of light were going to make their job more difficult, tampering with their night vision.
"I don't want to get wasted," Draco protested and cradled the bottle of cider against his chest protectively, out of Ron's reach. The more he drank, the more he liked it. Another reason was, that Harry had ordered it for him and he didn't want to hurt his feelings by not finishing it. He didn't say that out loud, however.
"Come on, Harry, you know that's not true. He's just a bit dimwitted when it comes to feelings. Just give it one more try," Blaise sighed, leaning against the cubicle door.
„You‘re gonna be the death of me,“ Harry groaned.
"You make me," Harry giggled. "Apparently, you hate pubes getting stuck between your teeth during blowjobs."
"It makes sense, doesn't it?" Harry asked, his head bowed in remorse. "All of this is my fault. If I didn't push you to come out…"
"Well, I fucked up because…" Ron started.
"Don't forget to eat afterward," Harry admonished her. "By the way, what do you need the ectoplasm for?"
"How about we get a pint after work?" Harry offered, unsure what to do. He wanted to be close to Draco, wanted to be there for him. He'd gone through so much in the last twenty-four hours and Harry didn't want to leave him alone. Harry knew from his own experience what it was like to be locked inside his own head with only ugly thoughts for company.
"Come on, no time to soothe your virginal ego," Harry chuckled. No matter what, he always enjoyed riling Draco up. He always flushed such a pretty shade of pink. "We've got to move, there's a robbery in progress at Gringott's."
„Hey,“ Draco smiled at him weakly.
"Niffler here. We found some old ones too. Nothing recent. I don't think this is the right place, Falcon," Hopkins said.
"Ron shut the fuck up!" Harry squealed and kicked his shin.
Ron staggered off the podium and dragged a chair back up. He climbed up the chair and pumped his fist into the air repeatedly, shouting even louder into the microphone.
A sudden flare of unfounded jealousy ran through Harry's body as he remembered Ms. Huntley's flirting with Draco a week ago. Harry fought down the urge to slam Draco against the door of his office and take him right there. He wanted to bruise Draco's lips with his own, mark his pale throat with purple hickeys, fuck him possessively for everyone to see. Instead, he gripped Draco's hand tighter and made sure Ms. Huntley noticed their intertwined hands.
„Remember in our eighth year when you used to snog Hermione all over Hogwarts? That was disgusting,“ Harry deadpanned.
Please trust me, please open up to me, Harry thought. He had to grab the pint with both hands to prevent himself from reaching out and stroking Draco's cheek.
Harry jumped in his seat again as the door to the pub opened. A group of middle-aged witches entered, giggling. They were clearly inebriated already. Harry's heart sunk lower. It was nine already and still no sight of his blonde partner.
„It was so smart, Mr. Malfoy, to suggest using Runespoor egg in the antidote."
"The chains are up, what now?" Harry asked.
„No,“ Draco snarled.
„Come on, he‘s not worth it,“ Ron grabbed Harry by the arm and pulled him out of the classroom. Harry was staring after Malfoy with such an intense look in his eyes that Ron was grateful it was not directed at him.
Harry thought to himself and immediately wanted to smash his head against the nearest hard surface. He had to stop thinking about Malfoy that way or the prat would notice soon.
"What? Pull-down staircases leading to haunted attics?" Harry snickered. "Don't be such a wuss, Malfoy."
"Knew what?" Hermione replied, widening her eyes.
Potter pouted. What was wrong with that man?  Maybe he wasn't Potter at all. Maybe it was someone Polyjuiced as Potter. Draco added that theory to his growing list to check later.
Draco stepped away from Harry and shook the offered hand. „My pleasure, Hermione.“
"Bloody hell, I'm gone for a bit and the whole world goes nuts."
"Come on, Malfoy," Potter jumped off the desk and went to read the memo that had just landed on his own desk. "Besides, I would make it good for you."
"We have to get him out," Harry pressed. "We don't know how many robbers there are, what they are capable of, we don't know what he's up against." His heart was beating frantically in his chest, panic settling in his stomach with every passing minute.
"Move," Ginny tried to push past Draco without actually touching him.
Harry followed Draco to a narrow shadowy alley in the vicinity of the Ministry. Draco stopped in the middle of the piss-smelling, trash-littered alley and looked around. A figure hidden under a dark cloak stepped into the light from behind a wheelie bin.
The melody started playing and Harry closed his eyes. Draco could see he was shaking slightly, and he wiped the palm of his hand on his trousers. His eyes stayed closed and his voice trembled slightly as he sang the first lyrics of the song.
"Don't you ever compare me to that fucker again," Harry hissed. It cut him deeply that Draco could even consider comparing him to Smith. He had to show Draco he cared about him. "I meant it, you can talk to me. I swear anything you say will stay between us."
"You know, for a drink," Potter added hastily.
Harry had a rough time pretending there was no heat rushing into his groin at the words baby boy and fuck. How he wanted to hear Draco utter those words while pushing Harry against a wall, his hands twisted in Harry's hair, their erections pressed tight against each other. Harry pushed those thoughts away quickly. Now was not the time to think about sex. He had to concentrate on the matter at hand. Hunting ghosts.
Harry watched Draco's lean body wearily as it disappeared through the narrow opening and Harry readied himself to follow. The door slammed shut before his very eyes and dread flooded his body.
"Get the fuck out," Harry jumped out of his seat. "I asked you to help Draco, not accuse him of some fabricated crimes that never even happened. He has a respectable job at the Ministry and he's been trying to fight against all the shit like this he'd been exposed to by being as good a person as he could possibly be. I will not sit here and listen to this bullshit!"
Harry changed his clothes in a rush of anger and pain and Apparated to his favourite club. He needed to blow off some steam, to stop his heart from trying to wrench out of his chest. He latched onto the first blonde bloke he saw, dragged him in a corner, and started kissing him hard. The bloke seemed to love it by the rutting motions against Harry's groin and the moans coming out of his throat. Harry tried to drown in the feeling but he felt sick. The man's tongue in his mouth felt cold, slimy, and wrong. Harry tried to breathe past it. He could do this, it would feel good soon enough, it would take his mind off of the terrible pain cutting through his insides. The bloke sneaked a hand down Harry's body and palmed his prick over the fabric of his jeans. Harry couldn't even get hard. He felt ashamed and disgusted with himself. What was he doing? Fuck, Draco probably thought Harry was a slut and Harry just went and proved him right. He pushed the bloke away, turned around, and fled.
The wall imploded in a rain of bricks, mortar, and dust. Harry jumped through the hole, strong Protego wrapped around his body. He looked around quickly. The Entrance Hall was packed with the hostages who were staring at Harry in awe. Harry's eyes finally landed on Draco. He was kneeling on the floor, the front of his robes covered in blood. Draco smiled at him and toppled to the floor.
"Oh, darling," she whispered sadly and ran her hand across his back soothingly. "Grimmauld Place. He lives in Grimmauld Place."
"I…" Draco trailed off.
"Thanks, Harry," Hermione patted his hand and got up. "I'm going to take a shower, I'm knackered."
Everyone knew that Neville's parents had been tortured by the Death Eaters during Voldemort's first rise to power. The Cruciatus curse had been cast on them repeatedly and they were exposed to its effects for long minutes at times, so much so that their minds didn't survive the constant pain. Even now, the husks of their bodies were kept alive in Janus Thickey ward in St. Mungo's.
"Well, we told Ron, Hermione, Blaise, and Pansy on Monday. I stopped at the Manor on Tuesday and told Mother," Draco counted out loud.
The Floo chimed, raising them both out of their slumber.
Harry wandered into the drawing-room and fell down heavily on the loveseat facing the fireplace. He looked into the flames, not really seeing anything. Even though it was the end of May, the Manor was cold and the fire helped keep the chill of the evening at bay. There was a sound of footsteps in the corridor on the polished wooden floor. To his surprise, he was joined by Narcissa.
"About the same time, you started getting those nearly deadly headaches and stopped partying with us?" Pansy snickered.
"Don't worry about it too much, your ability already helped us tremendously tonight. Maybe it will improve with time, grow stronger, and you'll be able to hear them better," Draco mused.
"You're actually letting me work with you?" Harry beamed at him. He wanted to hug Malfoy or even better kiss him but he wasn't sure Malfoy would appreciate his sentiment. Harry didn't want to mess everything up the instant Malfoy agreed to help.
"I admit, I might be slightly confused. Do you or do you not want me as your partner? Not that I'm complaining, mind you," Harry added quickly when Draco looked at him sharply.
„Incendio,“ Draco waved his wand and the letter burst out in flames. He threw the burning parchment in the wastebasket and grabbed his cloak. He left the office absentmindedly, seemingly lost in his thoughts.
Draco didn't say anything and Harry felt the finger withdraw. Instead, something larger, silkier pushed against his opening. Draco let go of his wrists and Harry felt, rather than saw Draco prop himself up above Harry in a version of a plank position. Draco pushed inside Harry in one swift motion, eliciting a harsh scream out of Harry's throat. Draco's prick was as deep as it would go, resting inside Harry's most intimate part.
„I was talking politely to the snake,“ Harry continued.
"We won't be able to save anyone like this. We can't even figure out a fucking spell," Harry raised his voice.
"No problem," Tracey Davis, his former Slytherin classmate, nodded.
Harry watched Draco enter the break room out of the corner of his eye. He seemed even paler than usual, his skin looked sallow and there were deep purple circles under his eyes. Harry wanted to scold him for coming back to work so early, wanted to throw him across his shoulder, carry him to his bed, tuck him in and keep him there until Draco was better. He did none of that.
It was getting dark when they finished their tea. They'd been sitting in a melancholic silence at first but then Draco clapped his hands and startled Harry out of his thoughts.
"Let's head inside," Draco's voice pulled her out of her thoughts. "Don't use the flashlight, I don't want to ruin our night vision yet."
Instead of answering, Draco growled, grabbed Harry‘s bicep, and started dragging him towards the bedroom.
Suddenly an idea hit him.
"We should talk about this later, now's not the time. Do you remember rule number eight?" he asked and turned toward Harry. Even though his eyes were shiny with unshed tears, Draco looked more composed with every breath he took. Harry admired the level of self-control Draco had.
"Did he tell you how he and Theo find the Sources? How do they dispose of them?" Hermione asked in quick succession.
"You stole my boyfriend from me," Ginny snarled at him.
„Shower?“ Draco asked.
"I recall you demanding rather loudly to be, and I quote, rid of the menace that calls itself Potter permanently," Robards glared at Malfoy rather smugly in Harry's opinion.
Ron was pinching his arm repeatedly and mumbling to himself. „I‘m dreaming. This is a dream. I just need to wake up...“ He was so startled that he unconsciously let Blaise lead him away from the group.
"Yeah", Draco's voice was rough.
Harry sighed and snuggled closer to Draco, his arms wound even tighter around Draco. Draco allowed his cheek to rest on top of Harry's head, loving that Harry was shorter than him and he could do that easily. He inhaled the scent of Harry's shampoo deeply and something inside him clicked. Harry smelled like home, like safety. Like everything Draco ever wanted. Draco's heart started pounding fast against his ribcage. He was in love. He was completely and utterly in love with Harry Potter. Harry, who apparently loved someone else. Draco's heart almost stopped at that. It was a cruel twist of fate, that he came to realize he loved the most amazing person he'd ever met, only to have it immediately ripped away. Draco took a shuddering breath. Even swallowing hurt. However, no matter how much he was hurting, he loved Harry more. He would be there for him, any time Harry needed him. Maybe one day, Harry would come to love him back.
"Umm," Harry tried to joke. "Always listen to Draco "His-Semidivine-Humble-Self" Malfoy?"
„Doesn‘t matter, turn around,“ Harry ordered him, palming his painfully hard prick, giving it a few strokes. „Fuck, I don‘t have lube on me.“
"What happened next?" Shacklebolt urged him when Draco paused to consider his next words.
„You‘re such a pervert, Potter,“ Draco tried to give him a disgusted look but couldn‘t quite manage it.
Harry wiped his tear-stained face. He'd been laughing out loud while reading Malfoy's rules and instructions. The comments were so Malfoyish in nature, Harry should have been appalled, yet somehow, he found them hilarious. Harry loved every word of every page, even more so because of the drawings that accompanied each point. Harry's favourite one was a caricature of himself, running away from a procession of ghosts who wore smitten expressions on their pale faces and seemingly tried to hunt Harry down for an autograph.
„Yes, well,“ Draco waved her off. „Brook, remind me I need to talk to someone from Magical Law about my proposal on the misuse of potion ingredients. There should be hefty fines on this. People come up with crazy ideas, just to reduce the costs of a potion.“
Harry kept his head bowed. "What do you think? You basically just laughed in my face after I… You could have at least let me down nicely."
"That you can't feel anything before it gets dark. I did, when I was in the asylum, trying to find the Sources on my own. Before you came and saved me, I could feel anger, terror, and pain, seeping through the walls. It was early afternoon and definitely not dark yet, although I recall it was a gloomy day. Also, I know this might sound weird, but I think I heard whispers as if the ghosts tried talking to me."
Draco slowly opened the door, wincing when the hinges creaked. The cold seeped into him when he stepped over the threshold. He immediately knew there was a presence in the room, even without the temperature drop. He felt the small hairs on the back of his neck rise with trepidation. He shook the feeling off and looked around the room. The bed was lit up by a faint, otherworldly, greenish light.
"Promise me you'll stay right here. For me," Harry said and gave Draco a quick peck on the lips. Without waiting for an answer, he climbed up.
„Ginny, I‘m sorry I didn‘t tell you earlier but I didn‘t want to say anything until I knew it was serious,“ a knife of suspicion twisted inside Harry‘s heart. Their relationship was serious, he knew that deep down. He could not let the self-doubt, that the Dursleys managed to instill in him, influence his relationship with Draco. He had to trust him. He continued on, ignoring the stabbing pain in his chest. „You know we can‘t ever get back together. I love you but not like that.“
"But why Malfoy? Alright, he might be the best but why couldn't you have made an appointment at the second-best agency?" Harry threw his arms into the air. "Why couldn't you have made an appointment with anyone else?"
"Are you OK?" Potter asked him quietly.
"Are you sure you want to do this?" Harry stroked Draco's cheek gently. Please tell me I mean something to you, please tell me I'm not just a means to an end to you, Harry begged him silently.
Harry's eyes gleamed with delight and he nodded several times. He couldn't wait. Already, half an hour into officially working with a ghost-hunting agency, he loved the job more than he ever did being an Auror. Maybe, if Malfoy agreed, he would hire Harry as a regular employee. If Harry was honest with himself, he would quit his Auror position and join Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. in an instant if it meant saving more people that way. Then there was the added bonus of seeing Malfoy every day. When Malfoy left the room, Harry got back to his assigned reading material.
Harry released his breath with a shudder. "Draco, I'm already using all of my remaining self-control not to pounce at you right here."
„Haha, very funny, Potter. It‘s not that late,“ Draco frowned at him.
"What's up?" the door opened and Anthony Goldstein, his new partner, sauntered in.
Something shattered in his expression, his face had gone pale and his eyes darkened. He whirled around and slammed both hands onto the kitchen counter, steadying himself. Harry could hear his fast panting. The movement of his heaving chest made his whole torso move up and down heavily. He looked as if he was in pain, his knuckles white with the strength of his grip on the edge of the counter.
"I stand corrected," Draco chuckled once he was able to think again. "That was otherworldly."
Draco's breath hitched. The sight of Potter's naked arse was exquisite, his hole twitching in anticipation, the balls hanging heavily between his legs.
"Of course, Harry," Hermione smiled at him softly. "I'm so happy to hear you convinced Malfoy to help. I would have been so worried if you went out alone, I don't think I could take it if something happened to you too."
"Why did you stop?" Draco whispered, having bumped into Harry's bum with his head.
"I don't think you've lost him, Harry. I think he needs to come to terms with losing his memory. He'll want to get in touch with you when he feels a bit more stable and then you'll woo him all over again. Anyway, I guess we all need to learn to talk more to each other about the difficult things, don't we?" Hermione smiled sadly. "It's a pity it always takes awful things to happen for people to learn from them, isn't it?"
"I can't see shit," Harry whispered. "Lumos."
"Piss off, Potter," Malfoy stood up and stretched his arms above his head. Harry's eyes followed the movement avidly, soaking in every detail. The way Malfoy's white shirt stretched across his taut stomach, the way his body shivered with the stretch, how his eyes fluttered shut.
"I think so too. He's really smart and he knows so much about ghosts. You wouldn't believe how much I learned today," Harry started recounting his day excitedly. "There are so many ways to protect ourselves from the ghosts. By the way, I have upped the protection around your flat. It turns out that lavender and iron are a good way to ghost-proof a household. Malfoy also told me there are different types of ghosts. Specters, Poltergeists, Changers, Cold Maidens. It's really rather thrilling!"
The door opened and a medi-wizard Draco didn‘t know entered the room. Harry shot up, blinking rapidly against the light coming in from the corridor. It was still dark outside, dawn seemed to be slowly creeping in across the sky.
"What are you waiting for then?" Draco grabbed Potter's hand urgently before either of them had a chance to sober up and change their minds. They staggered out of the pub, Draco grabbed Potter around the waist and Apparated them into his flat.
"Come to think of it, I've never heard you mentioning anyone special in all the years of being an Auror," Smith laughed out loud.
„You‘re insatiable, you know that?“ he chuckled, giving Harry a peck on the lips.
"I recall someone," Harry stared pointedly at Draco, "wanted me to become his man slave. I don't see a reason why you should start complaining about it now."
Harry ignored his quip and waited for Draco's affirmative nod. They both climbed the rest of the stairs. Harry’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. He peeked around the corner to his left, trusting Draco to do the same on his side. It was surprising how easily he came to trust him with his life. The corridor was dimly lit by the warm, yellow light of the street lamps. As Harry looked around, a sharper, whiter light of a passing car moved along the wall, brightening the space for a few seconds. The sound of the engine slowly disappeared in the distance, plunging the house into silence once more.
Draco allowed his mind to wander. Potter was holding his hand. Did that mean he actually cared about him? Draco had a vague feeling Potter had called him Draco before but he wasn't sure if it really happened or if it was only a wishful figment of his imagination. Potter's hand was warm in his. Draco allowed himself to stroke his thumb in a circular motion across the soft skin. He could get used to this. His heart constricted painfully in his chest with hope.
Instead of answering, Draco leaned in and kissed Harry. He let his tongue slip inside Harry's willing mouth. The kiss was slow, gentle, and loving. It was everything Draco could ever dream of.
Harry‘s eyes softened and he kissed Draco sweetly, reveling in the softness of his lips. Draco deepened the kiss, sneaking his tongue inside Harry‘s mouth. Their tongues danced against each other playfully. Harry pulled away and sighed contentedly.
The atmosphere around them changed rapidly. What had felt peaceful only seconds ago, was now a torrent of rage around them. Draco heard the shutters in all directions slamming shut, glass shattering on the floor. A loud wail echoed from the dark depths of the corridor behind them. Draco didn't hesitate. He started running back the way they came, dragging Pansy with him. As he cleared the landing of the staircase and looked down from a small balcony overlooking the foyer, he swore loudly. At least three Spectres were floating at the base of the stairs, blocking his way to the front door. Draco could see their faces, forever twisted in agony, as if they'd died in horrible pain. Draco turned around and noticed another apparition closing in on them from the corridor they'd ran out of just now.
„That is highly inappropriate, Ms. Huntley. First of all, you are my subordinate. Second of all, I am gay. Third of all, not that it‘s any of your business, I am in a very happy relationship. You are good at your job so I will let it slide this time. I hope this won‘t happen again, I would hate to have to report your behaviour. Are we clear?“
"Alright, enough of this, Potter. Stop behaving like a child, we have to check the rest of the house," Draco said. "Together,” he added pointedly a second later.
Harry stepped through the flames and looked at Ron. "I guess you want to talk about it?"
Harry pushed the door open and winced when the hinges creaked. The sound echoed in the empty, suffocating stillness of the house. He peeked inside, his eyes were immediately drawn to the two dust-free human-sized shapes on the floor, where Montague and McLaggen had lain. Harry's mind supplied two bodies, sprawled on the floor, unmoving, their faces pale, lips blue and cold. He blinked to clear the image from his mind. He started systematically searching the room, presuming the Source of the ghost that had killed Alpha must be hidden somewhere in the same room. He looked into all the drawers in a cupboard to his left, searched under the broken bunk bed, he even tore the mattresses open and searched the inside of the fabric bags they had been made of. He tried tearing out the wooden planks off the floor. Malfoy had said that the Sources were usually bones or items of emotional value, however, he couldn't find anything of importance inside the room. He even, rather desperately in his opinion, tried to
Hermione sighed. She sat down next to Ron and took his hands in hers gently. "Neither did I. I wish she came to us for help."
"You're doing really well, Hermione. I just wish you tried to rest a bit more, it can't be good for the baby…" Harry trailed off.
"Draco fled to his flat and I realized only then he'd looked sick and not like… not like he'd shagged someone," Harry closed his eyes and let out a deep breath. "I went after him only to find him crumpled on the floor in front of the fireplace, unconscious."
Harry cringed inwardly at the tinge of desperation colouring his voice. Malfoy looked at him as if he was trying to see through Harry's skin and flesh, all the way to his heart.
Draco woke to an empty bed. He sat up, yawned, and scratched his belly languidly. He Accioed his emerald green silk robe and wrapped it around his naked body. He padded down the stairs in search of Harry. He followed the sounds of banging to the kitchen. Harry was dressed in his black pajama bottoms, his torso and feet were bare, muscles jumping in a symphony across his back as he bustled around the kitchen. Draco leaned in the doorway and observed Harry with adoration. Harry hadn't noticed his presence yet and was whistling a jaunty tune they'd heard on a Muggle radio weeks ago.
"Be a bait," Draco replied casually, shrugging his shoulders.
"Hmmm," Draco replied and inhaled the scent of Harry's shampoo deep into his lungs. He let his breath out slowly. He decided right there and then that Harry in his arms was all he could ever need.
"Whatever you need to believe, darling. I'll leave you to your important stuff with Potter then," she winked at him, the cow, and disappeared in the reception area. Even the way her heels clicked against the wooden floor sounded sassy to Draco's ears.
Hermione turned around to look at her boyfriend and narrowed her eyes at him, silently forcing him to shut his mouth at least. „Ronald?“
Draco and Potter fell in formation. They always argued in the office but once in the field, they were formidable. They worked together as one, always knowing where the other was. There didn't have to communicate with words any longer, they were able to read each other's movements and expressions as if they were using Legilimency.
"I'm sorry?" Harry tried, even though he hadn't actually heard a word of what Malfoy had said to him in the past five minutes.
Harry is feeling like an idiot and rushes over to Draco's flat to figure out what's wrong.
"Robards wants to see you," Draco shot in Goldstein's direction as soon as he walked through the door of his office.
"Thank you, Kracher. You should try to be nicer to him, it's been really hard for him, you know?" Draco smiled at the ancient house-elf.
Two medi-witches ran toward them.
„Breathe, Potter,“ he told himself. The voice in his head sounding like Draco‘s. The voice his mind used now as a default to get through uncomfortable situations. It startled him. Harry tried to count to three while inhaling, counted to five on exhale. When his breathing steadied, he got up and Apparated home.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and willed himself to calm down. Then, he threw the powder into the blazing fire and stepped through the flames.
Harry Vanished the rose petals and the puddles of water on the floor. He blew out the candles and went to join Draco in the bedroom. Draco was lying on the bed, stretched seductively on the grey sheets. Harry had asked Kreacher to change the sheets to grey when they returned from the hospital. Draco against grey sheets was his favourite sight in the whole world. Draco was beautiful, his long pale limbs, the barely visible platinum blonde trail of hair on his abdomen leading to his groin, the wetness from his hair staining the silk pillowcase darker. Not even the fact that his mouth was slightly open and he was snoring softly could take away from his beauty. In Harry's opinion, it only made him more gorgeous.
Harry tried to recall all the details that had been said during their briefing earlier that day. The only recorded violent death inside the house was the suicide of Mrs. Emsworth’s mother. She’d suffered from depressions and one night, she hung herself from a beam in the attic. Her daughter found her in the morning when she left her bedroom to make breakfast and found the attic staircase pulled down from its place in the ceiling.
„Bad day at work, it‘s nothing,“ Harry shrugged. He didn‘t want to talk to Ginny about the doubts about Draco that kept coming back. He loved her as a sister but he was not ready to talk to anyone about Draco. Not until he found out what was going on. „What did you need?“
Draco thought about it, really thought about it. He never thought Potter of all people was facing the same issues Draco had to battle every day. He'd had a crush on Potter for years, longer than he could actually remember. Would it be so bad to give in once, to know what it was like to be held in someone's arms, to know the feel of someone's prick up his arse?
"Now I'll know where you are at all times. The spell will last for twenty-four hours," Harry said.
Draco had spent the last two days in the hospital, getting checked by the doctors, being prodded by wands, and examined by various diagnostical charms. All the experts agreed unanimously. Most of his memories from the past three months were gone, taken, deleted, cut out of his mind savagely, irreplaceably. Potter had stopped by on the first day, looking like a shell of himself. Draco was still shaken and confused, and soon he drove Potter away with his snide remarks and jabs. He didn't know why it hurt so much to see Potter's shoulders slump as a single tear fell down his cheek. Draco didn't know why it hurt even more when Potter turned away and left. His mother spent most of his stay in the hospital with him. She held his hand as she told him about his relationship with Harry, how devoted they were to each other, how palpable their love was in the air. Draco didn't believe her. He couldn't comprehend how a love that grand could disappear within seconds, extinguished by a mere spell. Love was supposed to be the strongest magic of all, so why didn't Draco remember a single second of his relationship with Harry? The answer was simple, he concluded. Their love had never been as strong as everyone seemed to think.
"Wait, are you saying?" Draco turned around sharply to look at Potter's face. "Are you saying what I think you're saying?"
Thank you everyone for reading my story till the end! I've loved all your comments and support. Hope you enjoyed this last chapter and that it ended the way you hoped it would!
Draco smirked at him over that beautiful cock he loved so much. It twitched and Draco ran his cheek alongside it, nuzzling it, inhaling the scent of Harry that always drove him crazy with lust. Finally giving in to Harry‘s desperate pleading, he licked his prick in a long line from the balls up to the tip.
„Fuck,“ Draco shouted and came inside Harry.
The medi-wizard trained his sad brown eyes on Harry and shook his head. "I'm sorry. There are no vital signs. They're gone."
"Good," Draco answered from under a set of stairs leading up to the first floor. "The temperature is pretty stable around the hall, however it drops to nine degrees over there," he pointed to a gaping dark hole in the wooden paneling decorating the walls. Pansy realized the door must have been difficult to spot before someone left it wide open. "It's consistent with what Tracey told me. She and Potter encountered the ghosts in the cellar," Draco nodded in the direction of the looming darkness. "And the temperature dips here a bit as well. Not significantly, just as I expected. Potter found the dead Aurors somewhere upstairs, it's bound to get even colder up there."
"Sorry, I should start at the beginning. Today, one of the Aurors, Weatherby, ended up in the hospital," Hermione said in one breath. "Nothing serious," she added immediately when she noticed Harry's worried expression. "Anyway, he'd placed a Trace on a suspect and therefore was able to follow him and Apparate easily to his location. You know better than me how Traces work," she waved her hand impatiently.
"Me," the hand moved to Draco's front, caressing his abdomen.
"You don't," the goblin wouldn't look Harry in the eye. "Its magic will respond only to the owner of the building. Only a goblin can open the door once the protective charms and wards had been locked in place. The building acts similarly to a wizarding home. It's trying to protect the treasures inside."
"I don't care, Robards," Harry slammed his fist on his superior's desk. "I want to be partnered with Malfoy or I'm leaving the force."
"That wasn't flirting, Scarhead. I was just trying to make you laugh. Successfully, may I add," Draco smiled smugly.
When Kreacher returned with the flowers, he spelled the petals off half of the roses and scattered them across the floor and the foam in the bathtub. He arranged the remaining flowers in several vases he'd transfigured from the empty shower gel bottles he'd meant to throw out ages ago.
"Don't tell me you never wanked at work. I find it quite liberating," Harry looked at him innocently. "Maybe you should give it a go."
"Welcome back," Nott clapped him on the back.
"Wanker, huh? I thought you were the one doing all the wanking around here," Draco laughed and winked at Potter, who snorted.
"Make love to me, please," Draco stares into Harry's eyes beseechingly.
"Of course you would," Hermione shook her head as if she didn't believe him. If Harry was completely honest, he wouldn't have believed himself either.
Draco leaned closer to Harry and whispered. „I hate you so much, I sometimes dream about you. I dream about squeezing your neck with my bare hands. I wish I could squeeze you right now, so hard you blacked out.“
Harry didn‘t have to turn around to know what Draco was doing. Instead, he listened for the telltale clink of the belt buckle, the sharp rattle of the zipper, the whisper of cloth dragging over skin. The quiet anticipation made his cock throb harder. Harry arched his back and huffed, sticking out his arse invitingly.
Ron gaped at him, his eyebrows nearly touching his hairline. Draco looked at him expectantly. Not receiving an answer, he huffed and turned to Harry who was beaming at him.
"Of course not, don't be daft," Draco cleared his throat. "It was a hypothetical retort."
"OK," Draco nodded. "But not the Leaky."
Harry nudged her with his chin and spooned her. Hermione didn't ask any more questions but he could feel her body stiffen in his arms.
Malfoy recoiled from him. "What? No way, we're not doing that! I'm not taking you to cast a spell in the middle of a ghost-infected area. It's too dangerous."
"Only one way to find out," Draco grinned. "Cellar or the first floor? Lady's choice."
They move together gently as if swaying in the wind for what feels like an eternity until Draco comes on his stomach on Harry's prick alone and Harry spills himself inside Draco.
Harry sighed and wiped the tears off of his face. Wallowing in self-pity wouldn't help him. He ran a dusty hand through his hair. He was going to make a difference, he told himself. He just had to figure out the Sources. And when Hermione finetuned the spell to extract the ectoplasm, they were going to come closer to solving the Problem. Harry got back to his feet and nodded to himself. As he started out of the room, he noticed that while he'd been brooding, it had gotten dark outside. The ghosts would be out soon and Harry still had to search the cellar. He increased his pace and almost flew down the stairs to the basement. He wanted to leave the house as soon as possible, but not before he located at least one of the Sources. The walls of the basement, as well as the floor, were concrete so Harry didn't have to worry about any bones being buried underneath the floor. He started ripping the mattresses off the cots with a Diffinido spell, levitating the broken pieces of the furniture into an empty corner. He was getting frantic, knowing that any time now, the ghosts would appear and he would have to deal with them. He had to hope he had enough salt in his pockets.
"I'm going to come in that beautiful mouth of yours, Draco," Harry rasped.
Harry and Draco stepped back to the library of Grimmauld Place, exhausted after the rather unpleasant dinner affair. Harry dragged Draco over to the sofa in front of the fireplace and pushed him down on it rather forcefully. He scrambled on top of Draco and buried his face in his chest.
"Mr. Malfoy, you came," she greeted Draco coldly.
"I heard the ghost whistle something but I couldn't distinguish the melody properly," Harry said into the silence.
However, Draco was sure being seen with Harry in public was a bad idea. He had a feeling as if the whole world would suddenly explode, upturning and possibly destroying the cozy life they had built together. At the same time, he had wished many times not to have to hide from Harry‘s friends who regularly popped into Grimmauld Place unannounced. Draco hated he had to lie to Pansy and come up with excuses why he couldn‘t meet up with her and Blaise as often as he used to (headaches, stomach aches, and other aches were such common excuses for him that Pansy taunted him in every conversation he should get checked in St Mungo‘s).
„Yeah, Malfoy, Draco, fuck, that‘s… ahhh,“ Harry screamed, completely lost in the pleasure as Draco kept hitting his prostate with every ruthless snap of his hips.
„They were trying to eat me alive, of course, I tried to prevent that,“ Draco replied defensively, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
"Really?" Harry's head snapped up. His whole face lit up with the force of his smile. Harry's eyes shone from under the long black eyelashes, stronger than a thousand suns.
Ms. Huntley blushed scarlet and nodded. „I apologize.“
"Draco," Potter sounded exasperated but held Draco tight in his arms. "Stop fighting me! I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing because we are both idiots!"
"Boo," hot breath whispered in his ear.
"Come here, you," Harry smiled and hugged Draco tight. He buried his face in Draco's neck and inhaled his scent deep into his lungs. "Just so you know, I'm never letting you go."
"I deserved it," Harry smiled, a corner of his mouth turning up. "I wanted to punch myself too at one point."
„What was that?“ Harry squealed as he impaled himself fully on Draco‘s cock.
Ron had no idea what to do. He wanted to leave but if he opened the door, now that both Harry and Malfoy were looking at it, they would see it move. He contemplated his options. Before he could decide what to do, the shock he was in not helping his brain work any faster, Harry had locked the door. Ron was screwed. Figuratively. Not literary. Harry was the one getting screwed. Right in front of Ron‘s eyes. And Ron was forced to watch.
"Not for a lack of trying, I assure you," Harry laughed out loud. "You gave up after two months, my hair is just impossible."
"The one and only," Draco smiled at her over the cup of his coffee. It was not a pleasant smile. "Now, tell me all you know about the asylum."
Draco stood up and smoothed his trousers just as the client entered his office. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Gladstone. My name is Draco Malfoy and this is my associate, Mr. Potter. Please sit down and tell us what troubles you."
Draco watched Harry as he walked stiffly across the dance floor and disappeared in the corridor leading to the Gents. Blaise and Hermione cast a worried glance at his retreating back. Blaise shook his head in exasperation. He said something to Hermione and followed Harry to the toilet.
"What the actual fuck, Malfoy," Harry wheezed, confused.
"What do you mean by not good and why are you back in the fucking circle?" Pansy's voice sounded shrilly. "Or more specifically, why the hell are we still inside and not at a safe distance to Apparate the fuck out of here?"
„So, you and Malfoy. When did that happen?“ Ron asked once he managed to swallow another bite.
"I… I don't think…," Harry trails off. He feels sick when he imagines doing that to Draco after what he had been forced to go through.
Hermione took a shuddering sigh and tried to hold back the tears, threatening to spill down her cheeks. She knew it was a lost battle. Her body started shaking with suppressed sobs. She hugged herself tightly and buried her face in the crook of her shoulder, pretending it was Ron hugging her, Ron's strong arms wrapped around her. She whimpered and let the tears fall.
Harry's heart started pounding faster as he recalled what he and Draco did just afterward. There was a horrible moment in which Harry worried Draco would indeed not leave out a single detail, and he kicked Draco's shin under the table.
"But why would he be angry with me? I haven't done anything," Ron whined.
Harry bent over the footprints again. They seemed old, a fine layer of dust had settled over them. From what Harry could judge, no one had walked these halls in at least three months.
"I do, it feels so surreal. I don't understand how or why but he's gotten under my skin so quickly. He's so driven and determined, you should have seen him back at the asylum. He was so brave, I couldn't take my eyes off of him. And he drew me a picture brochure. I'll find it and show you later, it was so cute," Harry smiled. "But I also feel guilty because you don't have that and…"
„I don‘t want to think about that now, Harry. Lie with me, will you?“ Draco smiled at him tiredly.
To Draco's horror or pleasure, he couldn't quite decide, Potter had copied the Malfoy smirk masterfully. Potter poked him again.
„Come on, if you stand up, I‘ll carry you to bed,“ Harry sighed melodramatically.
„Harry?“ Draco groaned. He shifted slightly and Harry tried to lift him up and cradle him in his lap. Draco‘s loud cry of pain thwarted his effort.
Draco set down the fork and knife on the sides of his plate. He took a sip of wine and tried to formulate his answer thoroughly. "It all started on Monday. I stopped by in Harry's office on Monday morning, Harry had forgotten his lunch at home." Draco smirked at Harry.
"Yes. Yes, I have. The house has been in my family for several generations. It's an old cottage, under Ben Nevis. Me and my wife, Jackie, inherited it after my father died," Mr. Gladstone sighed wistfully, his eyes unfocused. "It's such a beautiful place, I wouldn't trade it for anything. However, recently we've started experiencing… some issues."
"Can you still hear it?" Draco asked a few moments later.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the salt bombs hitting their target - the cluster of ghosts that had followed Potter, presumably up from the cellar. Draco had never seen that many ghosts in one place. The Spectres disappeared in a blast of salt.
"That's enough, both of you," Hermione shouted shrilly. She looked scared and she was crying. "If you want to kill each other, take it outside, you morons! You're supposed to be best friends, you're supposed to be there for each other during the worst of times!"
"You're so hot like this Harry," Draco growled. "I want you to come on my face."
"Nonsense," Potter bellowed. "I saved you a seat."
Draco smiled and crumbled half on top of Potter, resting his head on his shoulder blade, tangling his leg between Potter's. Harry's. It was Harry now, wasn't it?
"Hmm?" green eyes trained on him as Harry turned around, bringing their faces close. His breath tickled Draco's cheek.
"Yeah, sorry for being late," Draco said. He looked around the table. The only free seat was next to Potter but squeezing there would mean asking Thomas and one of the male Weasleys to get up. "I'll just grab a chair and…"
"You know Smith is an arsehole, everyone knows that," Potter carried on carefully.
The wind outside was swooshing and whistling, the sound seemingly louder in the attic than it had been in the bedrooms. Harry turned in the direction Draco was pointing. A glowing shape in the form of a woman hung from one of the beams on the far side of the attic. The rope was slowly swaying back and forth as if the wind reached all the way there. Another bolt of lightning flashed, the thunder sounding closer this time. It took Harry a few moments to regain his night vision. When he finished blinking away the white spots dancing behind his eyelids, the figure was gone.
"Well," Malfoy shifted in his seat guiltily. "It's not your desk anymore. I asked to be partnered with Goldstein."
"Want a gum?" Draco asked Harry.
Harry slipped into the water and relaxed his legs on either side of Draco's hips. He pressed his groin against Draco's lower back and wiggled his hips several times. Draco shivered and sighed against him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and slowly lowered them both against the cold porcelain of the tub so that Draco was comfortably propped against Harry's chest. Harry slid his hand between Draco's thighs and ran his index finger gently across Draco's balls. He palmed Draco's sack abruptly, eliciting a loud gasp from him. He played with it, teased it, rubbed it between his fingers, tugged at the skin softly. Harry moved his hand up and wrapped his fingers around Draco's cock. It a bit soft because of the hot water but it was soon rock hard under Harry's ministrations.
voice instead. "Step where I step, stop when I stop, do as I tell you, understand?"
“I’m taking the left, you take the right,” Harry said. He pressed his back tightly against the wall and looked at Draco for confirmation.
"It's OK, Harry," Draco said amicably. "I'm used to this. And no, Head Auror Robards. I have been a model citizen ever since I was pardoned during my Trial."
"So tell me, Potter, to what do I owe the pleasure?" Malfoy asked, leaning back in his chair. One of his arms was draped over the armrest casually. His other hand was placed on the desk, fingers drumming slowly on the wooden surface.
"Pansy stop!" Draco tried to shout but it came out barely as a whisper.
"We might have almost kissed?" Harry choked out at last.
"The memory, Ginny," Harry reminded her softly but firmly.
"What are you babbling about, Potter?" Draco stilled and tried to swallow around the lump in his throat. It fucking hurt.
„Draco…,“ Harry exhaled.
"Oh," Harry startled as if he hadn't even considered the possibility of such reply. He crossed the room slowly and stopped inches apart from Draco. Draco took in the way Harry's eyes widened even more, the bewilderment and a flicker of hope shining in them. His breath hitched when Harry's gaze flicked between Draco's eyes and lips uncertainly. The way Harry's chest heaved as he panted heavily, the way he held his hands pressed tightly against his sides as if stopping himself from reaching out and touching Draco.
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy since the Battle of Hogwarts. He'd joined the Auror training program, deciding to skip the eighth year and Malfoy had disappeared from the surface of the earth. Harry hadn't seen him or heard of him once in the last seven years. Over the years Harry wondered many times (out of habit) what had happened to Malfoy and what he was up to those days.
"Thank you," Harry kissed her cheek. "I have to get back to work but I'll see you later."
"OK, I trust you," Harry said simply and watched her disappear in the bathroom.
"Why the hell would I laugh?" Potter looked offended.
"Don't," Draco chokes down a sob. "Don't say that if you don't mean it." His eyes are suddenly brimming with tears, his whole body hard and unyielding where it was soft and pliant just seconds ago.
"Why are you doing this the Muggle way?" Harry whispered, fumbling for any distraction from Malfoy's breath caressing his cheek.
„Not much, I'm on the pain-relieving potion. Just hold me for a bit,“ Draco whispered.
"Is this alright?" Harry whispers.
Harry beamed at him that beautiful smile that lit up his whole face and made Draco's heart clench with love as he slid onto Draco's lap.
Harry carried candles over from the bedroom and arranged them on the sink, cupboard, and floor. He filled the tub with hot water and added lots of foam in Draco's favourite scent that was woody, fruity, and spicy all at the same time.
"I'll tell you over a cup of coffee," Theo sighed and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. His voice sounded raspy and his eyes were red-rimmed. "Where's Draco?"
"Yeah," Draco breathed out. "I stepped into a cold spot."
„You‘re too kind, Mrs. Malfoy but I don‘t think I could eat anything right now,“ Harry replied politely.
"I'm glad you could make it," Potter grinned at him rather spectacularly.
"So, I guess I'll see you on Monday?" Draco asked casually. Considering that his prick was constantly hard for three hours straight, he thought he managed the easy tone of his voice rather spectacularly.
"I do suck, Malfoy," Harry bit his lip seductively. "Rather spectacularly, if I say so myself. Want me to show you?"
They would be sitting on a sofa in their flat in front of the fireplace right now. She would be lying with her head in his lap. He would run his fingers through her hair lovingly. He would place tiny kisses on her knuckles, kiss her temple gently, rub her belly, waiting for their baby to kick.
Potter lifted his hand and stroked his fingers along Draco's cheek. "Are you sure you want to do this?"
Harry stared at him incredulously. Draco seemed as surprised as Harry with his honest answer. It must have been all the alcohol they'd consumed, weakening the walls Draco had erected inside himself.
Draco took another step and immediately cursed. "Fuck!" He jumped back, shivering. His teeth chattered loudly.
The look of pure, undiluted happiness on Harry's face melted Draco's insides and warmed his heart. He needed Harry close, needed him like people needed air.
Harry gulped. Harry and Draco's sex was always fun but usually, they took their time and made it sweet and loving. However, on occasions such as these, Harry loved being fucked roughly. Draco kept Harry's wrists pinned above his head with one hand. His other hand slid across Harry's flank, down his thigh, and back up to cup the round globe of his arse. His fingers dug deep in the flesh of Harry's arse cheek. Suddenly, the hand drew away and slapped him hard across the soft, firm skin there. Harry shouted out loud.
"Let you down nicely? What are you talking about? I didn't understand a word you had said," Draco replied in bewilderment.
"Please, yes, Draco, please, I need you, please, inside me," Harry babbled, just as another slap landed on his other cheek.
"Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Malfoy, has any of you been contacted or in contact with any of the Death Eaters still on the run?" Robards asked, ignoring Harry's outburst.
The medi-witch placed her hand gently on Harry's bicep. "He's undergoing surgery. It will take some time until there is news about his condition. Why don't you clean up, while you wait?"
"Sir, you're bleeding," a medi-witch ran toward him.
"I fucking know how a flashlight works," Potter spluttered. "Are you daft? I want to know what we need a flashlight for!"
They took their time, petting each other, enjoying the comfort of their wet, soaped-up skin sliding against each other while they kissed softly. The second orgasm was less but more intense at the same time. Before, it had been an explosion, a pure need for release. Now, their climax was full of love and reassurance that they were both there, safe in each other's arms. That they would handle whatever the world threw at them together.
„Mmm, I‘m too tired, I think I will sleep here,“ Draco pushed the plate away and lowered his head on the table.
"God, you feel so good under me," Harry whispered. He lowered his head again to look at Draco and circled the tip of his cock around Draco's lips.
Harry smiled at him and placed a hand on Draco's lower back, pushing him gently in the direction of the bar. As he was being led away, he noticed Pansy, Hermione and Blaise stare after them with similar expressions on their faces. All three of them were smiling secretively as if they knew something Draco didn't. He raised an eyebrow at Pansy in what he hoped was an intimidating inquiry but she only winked and blew him a kiss.
Harry's body reacts without his permission, his arms wrap around Draco - because suddenly, it's Draco, not Malfoy, in his arms. Harry lets his hand sneak into the soft platinum-blonde hair as he brings their lips together in a bruising kiss. Draco is stiff for a second, then his body responds, his hands grab at Harry's waist, pulling him closer. Draco tastes sweet, better than Harry ever dared to dream and he can't get enough of it. He explores every nook of Draco's mouth, their tongues twisting, lapping, ravaging each other as the long denied want explodes through their bodies.
"Hermione," Harry wailed, knowing she enjoyed the suspension.
"I'm fine with anything that doesn't involve roaming through haunted mansions, trying to save Potter's arse," Pansy sniffed.
"Nok goog," Draco murmured, his mouth full of a flashlight, and jumped back to the safety of their protective circle.
„Reciprocate?“ Draco lifted an eyebrow. „I didn‘t know that word was part of your vocabulary, Potter.“
Draco was leaning against a wall at the back of the club, alone. Their group had dispersed in all directions during the night. Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise were sitting at a table to his left, heads bowed together, shooting occasional glances in his direction. Draco frowned. He wasn't in a mood for their obvious plotting, so he turned away from them. His gaze landed on Luna and Theo next. They were dancing together in the middle of the dance floor, lost in each other's eyes. Their relationship had been unexpected and Draco would probably never understand how the two of them managed to work out so well, considering how different they both were. His heart gave a painful lurch. He was happy for his friends but at the same time, he was a bit jealous of what they had. Draco desperately wanted to have someone in his life who would gaze at him with that much love seeping out of their every pore. He sighed and forced himself to look away from the dancing couple. At the far side of the bar, Ron and Seamus were standing on a podium, completely butchering some Muggle song (which was quite catchy but Draco would never admit it out loud) with their out-of-tune, out-of-rythm howling.
"Come on, Malfoy! Besides, I would make it good for you," Harry jumped off the desk and moved away to recuperate from Draco's remark. What had he been thinking? Draco would never go for shameless flirting. Harry wanted to slam his head against the desk. He had to come up with something special if he wanted to convince Draco he was serious about him. He had almost overlooked a memo that had landed on the desk before him.
"Apparating drunk, Malfoy," Potter tsked and erased the distance between them. He stopped just inches from Draco and peered into Draco's eyes. His gaze was dazed but it held a great deal of softness Draco hadn't expected.
"You're such an idiot," Harry laughed out loud, suddenly feeling giddy, overwhelmed with such happiness he wanted to start jumping around the room. Draco liked him!
"Draco," Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes and held Draco even tighter. "Stop fighting me! I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing because we are both idiots!"
„I really, really, really hate you. You have no idea how much I want to grab you by the collar, throw you on the table and...“ Harry trailed off, searching for words.
"Go to bed, I'll be there in a minute," he pecked the tip of Draco's nose lovingly.
Draco must have sensed something in the tone of her voice because he quickly turned around and clasped her shoulders in his hands. "Don't be afraid, don't let the ghosts feed off of your fear. You know it only makes them stronger," he gulped and with that he faced the mansion again, climbing up the three steps to the porch. The double door leading inside the foyer stood ajar. A wave of uneasiness wafted from the inside. It felt different from any haunted place Pansy had ever been to, not that she visited that many. Usually, it was Draco and Theo going out on the jobs. And Blaise before. She was never as good as any of the men at sensing the presence of ghosts and disentangling her own feelings from those inflicted upon her by the apparitions. She could never tell if she was projecting her own growing feeling of disquiet onto the haunted sites. She couldn't tell if the fear slowly creeping up her spine was hers or if it was miasma, a feeling of unease caused by the proximity of ghosts. The only thing Pansy was sure about now was, that she didn't want to enter the house.
Harry had to decide fast. If he didn't use the adrenaline shot on McLaggen, he would certainly die. Maybe Cormac was dead already, maybe it had been longer than ten minutes since he was ghost-touched and Harry's effort was in vain. However, the adrenaline shots were not standard medical equipment in a Wizarding hospital and if he portkeyed them to St Mungo's now, McLaggen would die for sure. No one at the hospital would authorize Harry to administer the adrenaline there. Hermione was the one who came up with it. Her research and her parent's job as dentists had proved invaluable as ever. However, the Board of Healers didn't want to acknowledge any Muggle solutions and instead tried to come up with other,
Suddenly, there was a knock on the window. A barn owl was impatiently waiting there, tapping the glass with her beak. Draco crossed the room and took the letter. He offered the owl a treat who took it gratefully and flew off.
Draco had to admit Luna had a stunning, soft, almost whimsical singing voice. It suited the song beautifully.
„Are you OK, can I move?“ Harry was gripping Draco‘s hips painfully, shaking with the effort to make it painless.
"Calm down, you're making me dizzy just by looking at you," Draco scoffed. "And no rapier for you, at least for now. I would very much like to keep my guts where they belong, thank you very much."
„Prat,“ Harry murmured but snuggled closer to Draco, licking the sweat on his neck in long lines.
"Planned to do? Are you trying to tell me you truly believe Potter has a plan? That would be a change for once," Draco snickered. This was going to be so much fun.
Harry started hyperventilating and fell on his hands and knees. He was beyond caring the alley stunk of piss, he didn‘t give a shit his left palm ended in a puddle of mud and refuse. Harry dry heaved. He felt sick to the stomach, his head was starting to spin, his heartbeat furious against his rib cage. Harry knew if he didn‘t get a hold of himself, he would faint.
"There aren't many options for a gay man who happens to be a former Death Eater, are there? The disgusted looks I get, the insults thrown my way, it kind of makes it hard to find someone who would want me. And those who wanted to take me to bed were all perverts, seeking the thrill of fucking a Death Eater. You have no idea what filth some people are able to let out of their mouths. And I would never pay for sex, ever," Draco shook his head and Harry marveled at how his hair reflected the light.
"Anyway, that's not all. I need to use a spell to extract ectoplasm from the ghosts. It's important," Harry carried on, trying to convince Malfoy to allow him to join him hunting the ghosts.
"Malfoy?" Harry exclaimed. Surely, Hermione would never send him to a Slytherin den on purpose. Harry concluded in his mind that Hermione hadn't known the agency was owned by them. Maybe the owner was someone else and Malfoy's name wasn't mentioned anywhere.
"I wanted to make sure you were alright, after…" Ginny trailed off when she noticed Draco lying on the sofa.
Harry tapped his ear with his wand and re-checked his Listening Spell. It was a standard Auror protocol to use the spell for larger busts when more than two Aurors were present. When activated, the Aurors could communicate with each other within a mile radius.
"I think you're the only person who can kill him," Malfoy gives in. "He's awful Harry, I want him to die. I want them all to die," Malfoy's voice breaks into a harsh whisper, his head bowed low, a fringe of matted blonde hair hiding his face from view. "You can't imagine what it's like, living under the same roof with him. My father had painted this picture for me, how glorious it would be when the Dark Lord returned. I was so stupid and naive. I believed him. I wanted to be a Death Eater, to make my father proud."
„I‘m so tired,“ Draco yawned, then sniffed. „You stink.“
"I'm going to beat the shit out of the bastard for hurting you. I promise," Draco placed a gentle kiss on Harry's temple. He couldn't help himself.
Draco obeyed him and crawled backwards onto the bed. He lied on his back, his torso propped on his elbows. His blood was boiling in his veins as he watched Harry crawl up the bed after him, his eyes almost black with lust. Draco wanted nothing more than to wrap his arms around Harry, stretch and lube himself with spells and let Harry ram inside his hole at once. Instead, he forced himself to stay still, to enjoy every second of it.
"I'll be going then, sorry to bother you," he peaked at Draco from under his fringe. He wished Draco would stop him, ask him to stay. Harry wanted to tell him everything would be alright, wanted to hold Draco in his arms while he recovered from his injuries.
Malfoy finished wiping Harry's face clean. "I would have loved to see that. We're starting with your training on Monday. Be here at eight sharp."
"Play me like a piano, Draco," Harry moaned into Draco's ear.
"Oh, that's brilliant actually, the doctor said that hot baths will help with any lingering pain. It should relax your muscles," Harry stopped his rant abruptly when Draco's head hid the dining table.
Draco so did not have to listen to this. "Not everyone here is interested in Potter's private life. Go and be disgusting somewhere else, will you?"
"Of course, you couldn't have known. How could you have? You didn't open my letter and you didn't respond to any of Granger's Patronuses," Malfoy scowled and his hands went up as if he wanted to choke Harry. Malfoy's fingers flexed into fists, then straightened involuntarily. For a second Harry thought Malfoy was going to give in to his urges. In the end, Malfoy composed himself and Harry didn't know if he should feel relieved or disappointed.
