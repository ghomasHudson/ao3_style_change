“It was a variation on the Cruciatus, intended to cause prolonged excruciating pain until the Counter is given. We were able to undo it as soon as I got in the room. He’s a little shaky after being in that much pain for several hours, but he’ll be fine,” Ron tells him, and Draco is simultaneously relieved and horrified.
And then Draco is alone with a slightly-drunk Harry Potter, who offers him the bottle and a shoulder to cry on. He takes him up on it, curling against his side to bury his face in the soft black t-shirt he’s wearing. He’s also wearing the cologne Draco gave him for his birthday last year, and
“Hey, speaking of Molly and the Burrow, will you and Dave be at dinner on Friday? You know you’re both invited, right?”
"I..." Kasper hesitated. "I wanted to request banishment for Grace, as her punishment. Exile. I would go with her and make sure she never returned. We'd leave the continent entirely, none of you would see us ever again, I swear."
Draco comes hard, stars dancing in front of his eyes, and Harry pulls off instinctively, come spattering over his chin and neck. He doesn't mind. He barely notices, his gaze locked on Draco's face.
smarter than they give you credit for, aren't you?" She chuckled. "A little crush on Granger, obviously. But don't you worry, I've long since moved on."
"That is good, sir. Master Harry is a good master. He pays Jenkins very well, and tells him to take as many days off as he wants, and always speaks kindly to him, even though he is not being well. Jenkins would like him to get better very much."
his tongue is tracing the inside of my mouth and he's cupping my cheeks in his hands, and my fingers have found their way into his thick hair, cut shorter than he used to wear it, and he's tracing my cheekbones with his thumbs, and it's absolutely perfect and I never want him to stop.
in this pickup game, Potter,” Draco chuckles good-naturedly, offering a hand to pull him back onto his broom.
He turned and stood, smiling nervously. "Hello Mrs. Malfoy. He doesn't know I'm here, actually. I wanted to, well, I wanted to ask you, if I, er..."
“Hmm.” She sighs and leans back on her hands, thoughtfully examining the sky. “Maybe he’s scared, too.”
"So you did," Harry laughed, "might have happened sooner if you could stop baiting him for one bloody evening."
As the next full moon swiftly approached, Harry became lethargic and sickly again and Draco hated how helpless he felt as he watched him. He brought potions that lessened the discomfort only slightly, and made sure Harry took his Wolfsbane potion.
Harry lingered in the doorway, knowing better than to interrupt Draco when he was actively brewing. He didn't mind waiting and watching him, anyway. The sight of Draco, focused and a little bit disheveled from the work and the heat, eyes bright with excitement and a smudge of ink across his cheek, was always alluring.
“Where did it come from?” Ron Weasley asks. It takes a moment for the words to penetrate Draco’s frenzied mind, but when they do Draco points, and the other man takes off running.
But the sight of Charlie Weasley approaching Harry in the kitchen where Harry was cleaning up some dishes to help Hermione, the redhead touching his shoulder and giving him a bright smile and asking how he was doing,
“More free time,” I smile, leaning forward to kiss him as he undoes the button and zip on my jeans and stepping out of them after he shoves them down my legs. “More sexual frustration to work out.”
Harry. He misses their conversations, and the casual way Harry touches him, and how easy it had been between them for so long. And part of Draco hates himself for mucking that up, even though all he’d done was speak a truth that Harry hadn’t wanted to hear. It all feels so unfair, and he wants to scream. But instead he continues his work carefully stocking potions ingredients and trying not to fret about seeing Harry later that night.
Ginny Weasley-Thomas kneels at the hearth a few seconds later. Her hair is pulled up in a messy ponytail, and she's in her Holyhead Harpies Quidditch gear. “Draco? Is that you?”
Scrabbling away from the lifeless body, he leaned against a nearby tree trunk and tipped his head back, gazing at the bright full moon peeking out from between the branches.
Harry kissed him softly, slowly, letting their lips brush over and over– warm, familiar, perfect. Harry caught Draco's lower lip between his teeth and tugged, drawing a low moan out of him that thrilled him to his core. Draco still liked that, then.
Potter turns his head to look at him, eyes widening in warning. Of course he doesn’t want Teddy to know about his
Slowly over the next couple of hours, the room fills with Weasleys and Draco lets George field their questions, his eyes on the floor. Despite George’s reassurances, guilt is still roiling in his stomach, hot and twisting.
Their lips brush softly, awkwardly at first, and then with more confidence for a few long, perfect seconds. Harry pulls away with a soft gasp. "So, you...?"
Healer Gordon frowned. "I don't either. I'll hold him off as long as I can, but I'm not sure how long that will be. I'll keep my report on your injuries as vague as possible. Does that sound alright?"
"I know," Harry replies, and then he gets a hint of mischief in his eyes. He takes Draco's hand and kisses each finger, returning to and lingering on his ring finger. "Maybe they'd give me a little space if I got married."
"It's only for when you have to be on your feet for a long time," the Healer said gently. "If you take it, I can discharge you today."
She gave Laith's hand a squeeze before letting go and walked up the stairs, shaking her head in amusement.
Draco shrugs. “It was a little funny. His face when you blocked his Hex without your wand, I mean. I thought he was going to wet himself.”
Draco's silk boxers join the pile of clothes on the floor, and then they smile nervously at each other.
The use of the old pet name makes his breath hitch against my mouth, and then our lips meet again. The burning, all-consuming flame from earlier reignites, and after a few minutes of frenzied kissing and frotting, he grabs my hand and slides it between his legs.
Harry glanced over at Nadine, who had come down with him. She looked as worn and tired as he did. With the full moon rising the next night, every werewolf in the house was looking decidedly haggard.
Harry turned off the stove top and waved a hand at the pot, presumably casting a stasis charm to prevent the curry from burning, but Draco didn't particularly care at the moment because now Harry's hands were free to run through his hair, and pull him tightly against him, which they did.
Harry shook his head, grimacing in pain at the movement. "I dunno. Lorcan and I both checked that everyone was locked in securely. She would have had to use wandless magic...in her wolf form...to get out."
Lorcan glared at them all, his lip curling derisively as he looked around for an ally and found none, but he allowed them to lead him down the stairs, Draco's wand pointed at his back all the way down.
"Yes, I do." Harry laughed and pulled Draco into his lap. He let himself be manhandled, leaning into Harry's chest and sighing softly.
He kissed Draco again, short and sweet. "I'll get you some fresh pyjamas and leave them on the counter."
His Auror senses were tingling, and as he neared the office he shared with McDougal, he felt the telltale magical hum of a Silencing Charm being used inside. That was unusual. Ron hesitated with his hand stretched toward the door handle for a brief moment before coming to a quick decision.
“I know I’ll need to deal with the emotional fallout from this, probably get in contact with my Mind Healer again, but tonight...I don’t want to think about it, Draco. I want—”
Ron and Draco, the appointed captains since this whole arrangement had been their idea in the first place, shake hands.
"I'm going to steal you one day," Draco cooed at Louis, gently stroking his fingers over the tiny owl's head while he hopped on his perch. Louis leaned into the touch and let out a happy little hoot.
Harry tilts his head in agreement and reaches out to brush his fingers over the longest of the scars, slashing from Draco’s left collarbone to his right hip. “That’s fair, but never physically. Never like this. Never again.”
Draco swallows. “No, Madam Pomfrey and Snape were able to work quickly. I was fine.” He smiles weakly at Harry. “You’ve already apologized. We don’t need to…”
Draco watched him for a long time, protectiveness and love coursing through him as he slowly ran his fingers over Harry's cheek, down his neck, over his shoulder. Part of him was afraid that if he fell asleep he'd wake up and it would all have been a dream. But eventually he fell asleep too, and to his relief, he woke up with Harry still wrapped tightly in his arms.
"Oh." Draco could feel his face flaming. He cringed internally; he was usually extremely socially adept—able to easily adapt to any situation—but he felt out of his depth here, and he hated it. "We did. A long time ago. But now we, erm, don't. Anymore."
“Okay, but—” Teddy cuts himself off at the sight of Lottie and Violet coming downstairs, eleven-year-old Violet desperately trying to hide behind her mother.
Draco’s stomach twists uncomfortably. It’s been two weeks since The-Night-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named, but the thought of it still stings and makes his face burn with shame. He’d tried to owl David and apologize the next day, but his letter had been returned unopened. He supposed he should just be grateful it hadn’t come back with a hex attached.
Harry smiled and sat in the chair on the right, gazing outside at the sunset and the secluded forest and beautifully landscaped grounds surrounding the Manor.
Draco pulls a face at him, and Harry grins. “Okay, okay, it’s from another Auror raid, I just thought you might be bored of hearing that.”
Harry grins and turns to peck him on the cheek before spinning around on the bench, standing, and turning to leave. "I doubt it. The Owls are on a three week winning streak. Soon to be four. But I
Harry panics and turns away, a hand on the door handle. "Sorry, I don't—I shouldn't have asked. Things have been so good between us, and now I've mucked it all up, haven't I? Fuck, Draco, I'm an
Harry smiled. "It sounds like you're doing a fantastic job. You don't need to worry. Your daughter..."
"No," Robards sighed. "He was one of us. Unless he hurts someone, or runs wild on a full moon, I don't want you seeking him out. You have no idea what he's capable of, wolf or otherwise."
The tingling sensation that accompanies Cleaning Charms washes over him, and Draco shivers. Harry pulls him into his arms and tugs the covers back up over them both.
“Touch me.” Draco brushes their noses together, reveling in the hitch of Harry’s breath in response. “Harry, I’m yours.”
"It's not just the distraction, though. I feel calmer when Draco is around me. I thought he would reject me when he found out what had happened, after Greyback bit me. That he'd be repulsed by me now. So many people are now..."
“She was.” I turn onto my side with my back to him, knowing he’ll want to examine the enormous phoenix I’d gotten during the MACUSA training next. He runs both hands down the smooth, brightly-colored skin. “Why the phoenix? Because you died and came back?”
"Stay away from there from now on," Robards said severely. "If Potter gets wind of this, there's no telling what he'll do. You know how powerful he is, it'll be a fucking bloodbath."
Draco waited a total of thirty seconds before following that arse into the kitchen, where Harry was cleaning up his mess with a few flicks of his wand.
He clenched his teeth when she spoke to Harry in a saccharine voice: "Are you hungry, Harry? Grace and I made stew and fresh bread for supper. I could fetch a tray for you?"
Harry shook his head, still averting his gaze. "I—I can't...I don't understand how you can want this. I'm a monster," he whispered, agony dripping from each word.
Harry smiled gently at her. "'Mione, it's okay. I'm...I can't stay in denial about this forever. And I
"Oh Harry, that's fantastic! He was so excited to have his very own room at Grimmauld Place before—" She cut herself off abruptly in horror. "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean—I just know how excited he was."
"Of course I am!" Draco snaps. "I mean, I don't blame you, this isn't sustainable after we leave, is it? With your fame and my family, and our history, how would we even...No, you're right. We should probably quit while we're ahead, before things get..."
Potter sits at a table with them, listening intently to Teddy as he talks about school and all the fun things Draco has tried to do with him as if he’d had a great time and didn’t whine and throw tantrum after tantrum at each and every outing. Potter is watching Draco’s slightly-pained expression as he eats his ice cream in silence, though, and Draco is convinced that somehow he
"I'd like to send Thomas to stay with Draco at Grimmauld Place for the night, if that's okay with you," he said, "I have some other friends that will be there, too. My friend Hermione agreed to watch Thomas there for you. And if...if I don't make it, I don't want Thomas to see the aftermath, okay? Don't let him come down until...until it's cleaned up. I don't want him to be traumatized by seeing what happened."
been separated from him for six months...time to make up for lost time, Draco decided. Again. And again. And again.
blame you for it. You weren’t out there throwing curses around. If you had been I might, but you weren’t.”
Upstairs, the potential interruption goes completely unnoticed by the two boys, lost in each other as they were.
Taking stock of his senses, Draco's nose is still stuffy, and his head feels...like it might explode. He whines softly, then winces apologetically when Harry stirs.
His former boss's face appeared in his memory, his expression cold and detached, "I'm sorry, Potter. We just can't have a werewolf on the Auror Force, I'm sure you understand. It's just not safe. How unfortunate, you were one of the best, you know, but..."
An older, familiar-looking man standing beside the bed tentatively reached out and touched his shoulder. Harry flinched away, and the hand was withdrawn.
“Maybe not right now, but you might go back to Hogwarts in a few months and start seeing someone you’ve always known in a different way, or maybe you’ll focus on your studies and meet someone new after Hogwarts. You never know how things can change.”
Harry held his wine glass out for Pansy to clink hers against conspiratorially, and they drank in unison, eyes twinkling merrily.
Ginny has her head in her hands when they walk in the kitchen, a concerned-looking Dean hovering beside her.
"I know it won't be easy out there, with the eyes of the entire Wizarding World on us," Harry murmurs, running a thumb over Draco's cheek. "But I do think it'll be worth it."
room now, given that Harry only returns to his own quarters to shower and change and sleep, and he smiles at the memory, wondering briefly if Harry will even go back to his own room for those things now. He hopes not.
Lottie takes the cup in shaking hands and follows them in, immediately setting the cup on the coffee table and perching on the end of one of the sofa cushions.
"You're entirely too cheeky for your own good, you know that?" Harry pressed a kiss to his cheek, laughing softly.
"I know, Tommy," Draco sighed, "but I need you to wait just a little longer. I'll be back to get you as soon as I can."
“I’ll help you practice before your exams. I’m sure you’re better than you think,” Draco says gently, watching as Harry’s expression transforms from concern to pure relief.
planning on doing this today, but... along with the grief, this day always makes me think about family. And
Harry nodded, silently accepting the apology, but his expression was stony. He was grateful he'd convinced Draco to stay home for this conversation. Coming across that bit of information had sent Draco into a towering rage that had yet to abate.
The others are gathering around them as Draco takes Harry’s wrist and carefully heals the broken bones.
Harry sat up and abruptly tugged his own shirt up and over his head, cutting Draco off. He gasped involuntarily at the sight that greeted him.
“What?” Harry asks, turning away from watching Violet’s anxious parents help her lift her trunk onto the train. Ron and Hermione are fussing over Rose and Hugo behind them, waiting to send them up after so they can all find a compartment together.
"You—" Draco attempted to snark back, but Harry trailed his hands over his arse and pulled their hips flush again, thrusting up against him, and Draco cut himself off with a loud moan as a wave of pleasure crashed over him, "oh, fuck it. Mm—
Harry crawled down the bed, jostling the mattress as little as possible, and made his way downstairs.
Harry rolled his eyes and turned over again. "Fine. Whatever. Stay as long as you want. I don't care. Jenkins?"
An hour after the previous nerve-wracking meeting, Harry found himself mentally preparing for another one. He stood outside the small house and forced himself to knock on the cheery yellow front door.
“Was a bully, who was raised in an environment where he was taught that treating me that way was okay. He knows it was wrong now. I’ve never seen him look so guilty before as he did when he looked at me that day, but...there was no point in ruining his life over it. It wasn’t his fault. He was just a kid, he didn’t know better.”
"C'mere." Harry pulled him into a rough, heated kiss, stopping abruptly to ask, "wait, sorry, is this okay?"
Draco sat up in the bed and let Harry curl up with his head in his lap, running his slender fingers over Harry's shoulders and back and through his hair, and soon Harry was fast asleep again.
"Got owled into work — Big lead on a case. Not sure how long I'll be gone, but I'm still planning on Quidditch on Saturday. See you then. —Harry"
Three days after Harry learned about his werewolf pack, Ron and Hermione sat in Harry's bedroom with them, discussing the situation.
They spent the day in bed, eating meals from trays, sleeping, talking, reading, kissing fervently until that devolved into heated snogging and then slow, passionate love-making, and then (in Harry's case), more sleeping.
Harry was asleep under a blanket, as the Healer had predicted. He still looked a mess, but he was breathing slowly, peacefully, his chest rising and falling beautifully as he slept. Draco walked over, gently kissed his forehead, and sat in the chair at his bedside.
Harry started to panic, his chest suddenly painfully tight. A wet rag had fallen from his head into his lap when he sat up. It smelled a bit like Draco. He'd been here. "Where is he? Where's Draco?"
It's nothing like Malfoy Manor, and Draco can tell Potter's a little thrown by that. But it's big enough for Draco and Teddy, and it's well-decorated and kept in order by a small staff of free house elves. Draco is proud of it, and he watches Potter closely, looking for signs of disapproval.
When he was getting overwhelmed, he'd grip Harry's hand so hard it hurt, and Harry would take that signal and redirect the attention away from him.
There was a low rumbling, and the whole building shook as if there had been an earthquake. Robards and McDougal both looked fearfully at the door, but nothing happened.
been having a hard time with his situation, with how much time Draco spends with Harry and Teddy and the fact that Draco hasn't let him meet either of them yet, and Draco knows that going with him tonight to meet his family will do a lot to assuage his discomfort. So he sets his resolve and makes the decision to follow through. It’s just one Sunday dinner, it’ll be fine.
Ron sent the beetle scuttling under the door with a flick of his wand, then tucked the earpiece in his ear, casually leaning against the wall as the beetle breached the edge of the Silencing Spell.
Her attempt to quiet him only made him angrier, and he turned that ire on the man beside her. "Tell me
"I brought lunch back from the kitchens for us," Harry said, sliding a hand into Draco's. "Let's get you something to eat, and then we'll go get you
Potter frowned. "I'm a Junior Auror just like the others in my class. It's my job." He turned to the young woman beside him. "You can head back, Hyatt, I've got this one."
He'd let Draco lay in his lap while they talked, absently running his fingers through the blond strands while he patiently listened to Draco rant about potions ingredients and rare plants for hours, even asking intermittent questions to show he was listening, even though Draco was pretty sure he only understood about half of what he said. Harry was terrible at potions, after all, but Draco appreciated the effort.
He flops onto the sofa as soon as Brandon leaves, in a manner that would have earned him a thorough scolding at the Manor when he was a child, and covers his face with his hands.
"Before we settle the terms of the challenge, maybe you should tell us what happened with Greyback, Harry." Kasper interjected calmly.
Hermione sighed sadly. "Greyback escaped custody. Harry was working the case, trying to track him down. Greyback let himself be seen outside a small village on a full moon night just before he turned, and when Harry's Auror team went after him, Greyback hunted and attacked Harry."
Harry had tucked him under the covers and begun stripping out of his Auror robes. "No, I should have told you. It's just hard to talk about. It's been so many years, sometimes I feel like I should be fine, like it shouldn't hurt anymore."
"I guess my body is finally adjusting to this whole lycanthropy thing," Harry murmured. "If only..."
A few weeks later, Harry shows up to pick up Teddy wearing a new pair of spectacles, rectangular frames that fit his adult face better. They make him look older, more mature. In the best sort of way. Draco’s stomach does that stupid fluttering thing it’s been doing lately whenever he’s around Harry again.
"Because they're your friends and they haven't seen you in six months and they missed you?" Harry laughed, pulling on a pair of jeans.
Harry grins and brings a hand up to cup Draco's cheek, leaning back in and drawing out the kiss in a way that has Draco flushing down the back of his neck.
Draco makes a noise in his sleep and rolls onto his side, dragging me with him to spoon him from behind. Smiling, I shift a bit to get comfortable, press a kiss to his hair, and settle down against him.
"You're welcome." Harry bounced on the balls of his feet, still smiling wide, when his expression changed unexpectedly, and he caught himself on the door frame, breathing heavily. He turned fearful eyes on Draco, who stepped forward to catch him as another vision of the werewolves hit.
"We need a Chief of Security at the Werewolf Sanctuary we're opening in a few weeks. I'm prepared to pay you more for your services, offer you more time off, better hours, whatever you want. Is that...something you'd be interested in?"
As he walked to the door, Lorcan seemed unable to resist one last taunt. "I won't have to keep it long anyway, you'll be dead soon."
Harry reached out to brush his fingers over Draco's, and he took the invitation and intertwined their fingers together.
"I'm sure it's just paparazzi or something. We'll send them on their way and be right back. You stay here and keep the party going." Harry gave Draco an apologetic look and kissed him before walking away.
When he’s finished, Draco stops to eat lunch at a local Bistro on Vertic Alley and tries not to think about the fact that it’s one of Harry’s favorite places. He knows he’s brooding as he sits at a table in the corner and glares down at his food as if it has personally offended him, but he can’t seem to stop, so he just embraces the anger for the time being.
Harry was still wearing the t-shirt and jeans he'd pulled on to face McDougal when they'd come to arrest him two weeks earlier. His face was bruised, and his lips were dry and chapped. His nails and eyes had an unnatural yellow color to them that indicated poisoning...Wolfsbane poisoning.
"Draco?" Hermione was back. She settled onto the other end of the sofa with her drink, turning to face him and brushing a few loose curls out of her eyes.
," Draco is breathless as Harry runs a gentle hand over his cheek, following the caress with a soft press of his lips. "I need you, darling, please," Draco pleads.
Draco forces himself to bite back the words, and rolls his eyes at Harry again. “I don’t know, Potter. Just...no more secrets!”
Harry turns and gives him a small smile, but there's a fire in his eyes that Draco doesn't quite understand. He looks intense, almost angry? But Draco has beaten him to the Snitch before in these little games, and he's never been upset, just frustrated with himself and more determined to win next time...
The boy raised his arms and Harry lifted him up onto the bed beside him. Thomas snuggled against his side contentedly. Nadine's eyes filled with tears as she watched, and Harry nodded to her, definitively indicating his acceptance of them. After getting a watery smile in return, Harry let his gaze travel to the last occupant of the room.
Harry smiles into the kiss. "I've been off the market since the first time we kissed, Draco, over five years ago. I just haven't done a good enough job of showing it, apparently. But I will, starting now."
he tells himself. Teddy is undoubtedly having fun with his grandmother, and Draco himself has been in a foul mood for days. Being alone for a few hours is definitely a good thing for him. Unfortunately, that also means being alone with his tumultuous thoughts, with no distractions to numb the pain.
"That sounds acceptable," Draco grins wickedly, "Although, I won't be satisfied with anything less than an 'Exceeds Expectations.'"
"Oh for Godric's sake," Hermione muttered. And conjured a teething biscuit and pressed it into the baby's hands, quieting her immediately. "I'm sorry darling, daddy will be back with more food for you," she cooed, as Rose sniffled and nibbled on her biscuit, looking mollified.
“Dudley, you remember Draco? My husband,” Harry clarifies, confirming the nature of their relationship and succinctly explaining why Draco is looking at him like he’d like to turn him into a slug all in one. “Why don’t you sit? I’ll tell Lottie you’re here.”
"Come here." He pulled her into a hug and held her tightly for a moment. "Everything is fine. Don't worry about it."
"He also hasn't been himself lately, and he's sensitive about the anti-werewolf shit, you know that, and he's been having more of those strange visions and sometimes they make him—"
“Right. See you on the train,” Teddy says to Violet. “And the rest of you,” he grins at his many Weasley cousins. “Behave.” And then he surprises Harry and Draco by hugging each of them in turn with a cheerful, “Bye Dad.”
. Fenrir Greyback's pack. I thought they were all killed in the war, but some of them chose not to follow him. And I killed Greyback, so now I'm supposed to take his place. I'm...the new Alpha."
When the door closed behind her, Draco lowered his voice. "Weasley had to threaten the Head Healer to get him to let me back to see you. I'm not sure why, I think he was just being difficult on purpose for some reason."
Harry woke to the feeling of Draco wrapped around him, pressed up against his back, his knees tucked against the backs of his own, an arm over his waist. Slow, even breaths brushed against the back of his neck.
Harry Potter stood up slowly, gracefully, no longer pretending to be weakened by Wolfsbane, and the older guard startled, grabbing for his wand. Harry was quicker, raising a hand and pinning the man to the wall with nothing but raw magic.
would. It won't be easy for us out there, and I wasn't sure you would think it was worth the trouble."
, you smell incredible." Warm lips pressed against the side of his throat, followed by the flick of a tongue and a pleased hum. "Taste nice, too."
Draco stalks into the bedroom and grabs a suitcase from the closet. A wave of his wand sends his clothing and several of his belongings flying into it.
"Yes I do!" Lewis called from a corner of the room where he hadn't been visible bending down putting books into a bookcase until he stood up. "And I meant it! The more students the better!"
“Well, I suppose that makes sense. It’s a bit smaller, and I imagine you’ve always been a bit smaller than Dudley, haven’t you?” Lottie continues in her friendly voice, blissfully ignorant.
"Good," Ron looked a bit choked up, and Harry pulled him into a tight hug. "You deserve that, Harry. More than anyone."
"I'm not delirious," Harry murmured. "I'm feeling much better now, I'll have you know. Thanks to you."
. He's been staying with me for the past two weeks. Maybe we should stick with what's familiar for the first month."
Harry crouches down to pick up Draco's wand, immediately passing it over, and Draco uses it to Repair his bag and Summon his belongings, directing them inside in a messy tumble so he doesn't have to gather them.
Still, even as he thinks it, Draco feels a pang of longing that infuriates him. Because even though he’s frustrated and angry with him, above all he just
"Everyone else is still down there," Draco responds, reaching out to brush his fingers over Harry's cheek, marveling at the fact that he
get out eventually. The Wizarding World is more accepting of werewolves now than it once was, but it's still..."
Teddy is nearby, talking to a friend Draco recognizes as one of his Hufflepuff classmates, Teddy’s Head Boy badge pinned to his chest gleaming in the sun. Draco feels a surge of pride at the sight. It’s hard to believe it’s Teddy’s last year at Hogwarts.
Draco sank gratefully down onto the sofa once he got home to his own flat. In some ways, his heart felt better; in others, it hurt much
filling it for almost a year now, and you’ve always been a great father-figure to Teddy. It’s not surprising he’s been feeling a desire to make it more...official, in a way.”
Harry expected her to object again, but instead she put a hand on his arm. He looked up at her and saw silent tears streaming down her face.
The older woman's eyes softened as she listened to him, her motherly expression reminding Harry of a younger Molly Weasley.
"Do you have any idea how traumatic that was? It took months for him to fully recover afterward, no matter the brave face he put on so no one would know. The real Moody never would have done something like that—It was evil and cruel, not funny."
They've been trying to bring down this illegal potions ring for nearly a year, and the longer the case drags on, the more bad-tempered he gets. The wizards and witches involved are some of the darkest the wizarding world has seen in years. A few remnants of the former Death Eaters mixed in with several new, equally-bad recruits.
Draco reaches out to tug at one of his curls and brush his hair out of his face. “No. I’m still a little shocked you quit the Auror Department, though. I didn’t expect that.”
Draco ran his fingers through Harry's hair while he slept and forced him to eat and drink what he could when Jenkins brought them food.
"Yeah, your version of the event that caused a neighbor to call us to investigate. Do you, er, know? What might have startled them?"
He rolled out of bed, tugged on a comfortable pair of jogger sweatpants he'd left on the floor, and picked up his guitar. He summoned one of the chairs from the fireplace so that it was beside the bed, settled into it and began to play, his deep, lilting voice filling the room.
Harry growled and grabbed him, deftly flipping Draco onto his back. "You're going to pay for that, Malfoy."
Draco glared at Hermione and pulled his lips into a tight line, leaving it to her to try and explain.
“Slap me, I’m sure,” Harry laughs. “I was so angry back then, I just said whatever I wanted to, no matter the potential consequences. It really wasn’t a good—“
Harry slides out of his lap and they kneel facing each other, reluctantly breaking kisses to remove items of clothing. Draco drags Harry’s shirt over his head and congratulates himself on his correct assumption that Harry is incredibly fit. He runs a hand down his chest as they kiss again, bracing himself for the moment his own shirt comes off.
Draco covers his mouth to muffle the horrified gasp that escapes him. He can't hear anything else they're saying, his ears are ringing as cold fury floods through him.
“So, you two got married?” Lottie asks when they’re all settled around the table, indicating the shining gold rings on Draco and Harry’s hands.
When Harry coaxes his lips open with his tongue, Draco whimpers shamelessly into his mouth, clinging tightly to him. He whimpers again when he's spun and pressed against a wall so that Harry can hold him up more easily, so that he can feel the hard press of Harry's erection against his hip as they slowly begin to move against each other.
He's trying to take some of the blame, trying to ease my pain and guilt even though he doesn't deserve any of it. Bloody hero.
Draco stares at him for a full ten seconds before he bursts out laughing. He laughs until he can’t breath. He leans against Harry’s side, his whole body shaking. Harry looks extremely pleased with himself as he chuckles softly along with him.
Draco dropped his head back onto the pillow with a thump, burying his face in it so that his voice was muffled. "What are they saying?"
The elation of Harry's news was quickly dampened as Draco quietly told him the events of the previous days at Wolf's Hollow.
"I need to finish putting up the outdoor playground for Thomas and Marie, and I still need to hire our Security Officer so I don't have to keep the Wards in place all on my own and we can stop taking turns doing rounds at night. I'd like to do some more work in the North Wing, but since no one is living there yet, that can wait. I finished the school classrooms on the second floor last week."
"Bit spooky how you can do that," Harry teased, standing up. "He did say he'd be finishing this afternoon though, just in time for us to go to dinner to celebrate our anniversary tonight."
"Yesterday. Hermione finally told me. I just thought he'd decided he didn't want me, but really he was trying to protect me in his own twisted way. I didn't know."
Draco laughs and pulls him closer, slinging an arm over his waist. “Not even close. Goodnight, darling.”
Nadine nodded. She glanced at the door to the stairs and Harry sensed a hint of fear coming off of her. He knew exactly what was going through her mind.
"Sure." Harry had winked at him. Before Apparating away, he'd leaned over and kissed him again, "I'll owl you."
Draco brought him off that way a few minutes later, relishing the look on Harry's face as he released down his throat, and the softness in his eyes when Harry sank to his knees to kiss him, cradling his face in his hands.
"No," Harry said quickly. "It's a long story, but Nadine is the only Alpha here. I'm afraid if you want to stay for longer than a few days, joining the pack is the only option. Are you prepared to do that?"
"I'm sorry," Harry smiled, kissing him again before turning back to their friend. "How are Lewis and Marie?"
Harry nodded. "She did. And she defeated Lorcan in the Challenge. I don't know if this has ever happened before, or if there's any sort of precedence, but as far as I'm concerned,
Harry's body went limp as he fell unconscious in Draco's arms again, his head dropping onto his shoulder.
Ron choked dramatically on a mouthful of cake, while Hermione covered her mouth over a giggle and patted him on the back. Harry flushed crimson up to the roots of his dark hair, and Draco laughed heartily, tipping his head back. He sat in the chair beside Harry, still chuckling at the look on Ron's face.
"I'm excited to get married!" Harry laughed, "I just don't know anything about planning a wedding and they keep asking my opinion on things, but they're just being polite, I don't have any idea what will look nice. They both know that!"
He steps closer and cups my face in his palms again, and I feel the slightest glimmer of hope fluttering desperately in my chest. "You tried to tell me. To explain."
“He did end things with Derek, you know,” Ginny says softly. “After you left that night. And before, apparently, but somehow that turned into break up sex,” she rolls her eyes, “don’t ask me how.”
, I mean, it’s entirely possible that I—I mean it really might not have been him, but just in case—“
Food was fetched from the kitchen, and chairs were summoned for everyone. Soon, they were all seated around the large bed, eating and talking. The conversation was a bit awkward, but still pleasant, as they ate the simple but undeniably delicious meal.
Draco pulled his wand from his sleeve, gave it a wave, and the cauldron poured itself into a line of prepared vials, which immediately corked themselves when they were full.
He brought a hand up to sink into Draco's hair, tilting his head for a kiss, which Draco gladly gave.
The garden behind Grimmauld Place isn’t very big, but Harry has clearly magically expanded it for their Quidditch practice this afternoon, as well as Warded it against prying eyes. He’s also Conjured a set of Quidditch hoops, and is on his old Firebolt, diving to fetch the falling Quaffle.
"Another werewolf vision. It was really quick, like a daydream. I must have only lost focus for a few seconds, but it was enough."
"This is the Alpha suite. It's been empty for a few years, but Gracie and I cleaned it up last week. Good thing, too. We didn't expect Harry for at least another moon cycle. He must be pretty powerful if he's progressing so quickly."
“Oh, nothing. I’m just glad I ran into you and Mal—I mean, Draco—today. I need to get going, but I’ll see you next week, okay?”
Draco caught Harry's wrist before he could pull on a shirt, and kissed the back of his neck, relishing the shudder that ran through him.
Harry swallowed, struggling to speak, shaking his head slightly in response before he forced the words out. "Need to Apparate. Wolf Pack."
"That sounds lovely," Andromeda stifled a laugh at the face Harry pulled behind Teddy's back. "Do you want to meet your cousin, Draco?"
"So, what was all that?" Draco asked curiously. "In the kitchen? You don't cook, and last I checked, you don't listen to Celestina Warbeck, either."
"Robards had to be the one who cast the Imperius Curse on Kingsley, right?" Ron asked in a hushed tone as he and Hermione entered the Ministry, walking through the atrium as casually as possible.
Healer Gordon's lips twitched as she fought a smile. Harry grinned and swung his legs over the side of the bed, cautiously pulling himself to his feet. Draco slid off the bed too, sitting beside him to watch. Harry was able to stand on his injured leg for several minutes this time, and even take a few tentative steps.
"Told me he still hates me and that I'll never be good enough for you," Draco finished for her with a scowl.
He nodded and she made her way out the front door, greeting Draco as they passed on the front step with a breezy, "hello Draco, I'm off to work!"
When Draco was starting to feel like he couldn't take another step, he used his shoulder to press through a thick patch of branches, and suddenly an enormous, decrepit house loomed in front of them. The blond sank to his knees, gently setting his unconscious boyfriend on the ground.
Harry woke on a dirty floor, like he had every day for the past two weeks since he'd been unceremoniously tossed into this cell, but for the first time since Draco's visit the day before, his head felt remarkably clear.
one another, what the other person likes, what they need...I know that when Draco gently bucks his hips up he’s telling me he’s ready for me to start moving, and I respond without even thinking about it, bracing myself on my hands and setting up a brutal rhythm that has him clutching at my shoulders and digging his nails into my skin.
"I—" For once, Ron seems to have been shocked silent, but he recovers quickly, his voice soft when he does. "You're being influenced, Harry. I know you don't see it, but—"
The other Aurors in the department were starting to resent him. Harry could tell, but he couldn't seem to bring himself to care. He continued to bark orders in the field and dole out harsh sanctions if they weren't followed. He put his team through brutal exercises on training days. He snapped at anyone who tried for small talk until they all stopped trying. Ron sent him the occasional judgmental raised eyebrow, but otherwise didn't comment.
“I knew you could do it,” Draco adds, smiling back. “There shouldn’t be anything more complicated than this on your exams.”
Draco looks over at Harry, hesitant to leave, but knowing that someone definitely needs to pick up Teddy. Draco stands up to go, but Ron holds up a hand.
"No, I do. I do love you, too," Draco blurts. "I've been scared to say it, but I do. I love you too, Harry."
hates me. But there was—" Harry sucked in a breath, "—something else. I saw something at the end. A house. I think it's where they are."
With a nervous glance at each other and a reassuring squeeze of the hand from Harry to Draco, they entered the Granger-Weasley residence.
Harry tenses beside him and moves so quickly Draco doesn’t understand what’s happening until the jet of electric blue light strikes Harry in the back, where Draco had been standing seconds earlier. Draco watches in horror as Harry’s eyes widen and his knees start to buckle.
"Listen," Draco said softly as he set the plates on the table, "before Weasley comes down—" Hermione shot him a reproachful look at the continued use of her husband's last name, which he blatantly ignored. "—Can I show you something?"
"You understand," Laith spoke for the first time in over a day. "If I ever see either of you again, I
"Alright, what happened this time? I thought you were happy with Paul. He was nice, and Teddy liked him, even though I know it didn't seem like it the other day... He told me he liked that Paul made you smile."
of someone Apparating to the front step cut her off, and she stopped speaking and gave his arm a squeeze. "Just think about it."
The first time they had done this, it had been a bit awkward. Harry had complained of a headache while they'd been studying, pressing a hand to his forehead, and then he had begun panicking, breathing unsteadily in a way that had alarmed Draco—Harry trying to count slowly, to breathe in time with his counting, to calm himself down.
"I promise to listen next time you have concerns about someone, even if it doesn't seem like it to me, and to make my lack of interest clear to them from the start, even if it makes me come off a bit rude," Harry says softly.
But Harry has barely come into contact with Draco’s mother since the trials, and he’s nervously adjusting the sleeves of his robes as they approach the impressive doors of Malfoy Manor.
Draco stared incredulously at the man beside him who, until very recently had openly hated him, as he stepped forward and grabbed the Head Healer by the front of his auspicious lime green robes, flashing his Auror badge in his face.
Harry smiled, looking around at them all. "I'm sorry I'm late. Let's talk about this challenge process. I've been reading up on it, but I'd appreciate any more insight you can give so we're all prepared. Does the next full moon suit you, Lorcan?"
"I— " Pain spasms through my chest, as if the shards of my broken heart have lodged in my insides like shrapnel.
"I found out that I was the only one on Wolfsbane. Apparently that's upsetting to other werewolves after they transform, so I decided it would be better if I came home this month."
Draco paused in the doorway, taking in the new lanterns and scrubbed stone walls, then bounded down the steps and froze at the bottom, staring into the potions lab of his dreams.
"It all doesn't seem so bad with you here," Harry murmured sleepily. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Drake. I was just afraid you wouldn't...and I
“Skive off tonight. Just once.” Brandon presses a trail of kisses along his bare shoulder, sending a pleasant shiver down his spine, and Draco can feel his resolve wavering. “I’ll make it worth your while when we get back.”
Harry yawned and flopped onto his back, stretching his arms over his head. "Yeah. What do you want me to play?"
"Fair point," Draco conceded, shifting awkwardly before stepping forward and pressing the tray into Harry's hands. "But I did today, and I think it turned out alright. Well, except the toast."
Bag in hand, he finds himself once again stuck. Draco knows he can't stand on his own, having already tried. He's pretty sure his ankle is broken, or at least badly sprained.
Harry just laughed and slid an arm around him, pulling him closer so that he was sitting on the edge of the bed where he'd been just a few minutes earlier.
“We’ll be in the kitchen if you need us,” Harry says kindly, and they close the door behind themselves.
Draco sends Teddy to use the bathroom before they leave, and Potter turns those piercing eyes on him.
Harry looks up when Draco charges into his office and slams the door behind himself. He takes in the furious glint in his eyes, the flush spreading over his face as he plants his hands on the desk and glares down at him.
Pansy has just managed to get the Quaffle past Ron by doing an impressive feint toward one goalpost, then hurtling the ball through another.
“I’m just worried about him,” Draco tells Paul later, over dinner. “People think he’s some indomitable force because he’s, you know, Harry Potter, and maybe to a degree he is, but he’s still...human. He still gets burnt out and tired, and I know he’ll take good care of Teddy, he always does, but he’s not always the best at taking care of
She covered her mouth again. "Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that! Oh, no. I didn't mean to—it just slipped out. Please don't tell him I told you. I'm sure he'll show you when he's ready."
They both began at once, then cut themselves off, gazing at each other in the semi-dark hallway. As they stared at each other, something indefinable passed between them, and suddenly they were moving—closing the distance separating them as quickly as possible, meeting in a passionate embrace, mouths seeking, hands clutching desperately to pull tighter together.
Christine Gordon returned the next day to speak with Harry and Draco, looking nervous. She wrung her hands as she spoke. "I'm afraid... One of the other Healers filed a report yesterday, and it made its way to the DMLE. An Auror named McDougal wants a detailed report from me about your injuries and how I think they were sustained. He also wants to speak with you, but I told him you weren't well enough for visitors yet."
Harry staggered back, his hands gripping tightly onto Draco's arms as he looked into his face. "What are you saying?"
Harry reaches out to tilt Draco's chin up,  examining his bleeding lip and blackened eye. His pained expression makes it clear that he's already surmised what has happened.
Ron swallowed and turned to face him. "Listen, Harry. I'm really sorry, okay? I didn't think that anything would go wrong. I should've listened to Malfoy and done a better job watching out for..." He trailed off, looking miserable.
Harry grinned and tugged him closer. "A precautionary measure. If anyone is thinking about trying anything, hopefully that will give them pause."
"It is better not to be. The screaming and cracking of bones is not being pleasant to listen to. Then the wolf howls and whimpers through much of the night. The sounds is most disconcerting, sir."
"It seems we have a lot to catch each other up on," Draco said soberly. "I called a friend here, a Healer from St. Mungo's to come help."
I run a hand through his hair as he presses a kiss to the Snitch on the left side of my neck. It comes to life at his touch, whizzing away from him, across my chest. “And this one?”
lately. You can listen to him whining and crying for Malfoy like a kicked crup while you both rot in there and slowly lose your minds.
“Go put your broom away,” Harry tells Teddy. “And then go take a shower while I place the order. What do you want for dinner?”
His target was lying on the ground beside him, staining the snow around them with blood. Harry's Severing Charm had done its job. If only he'd managed it a few moments sooner.
Harry found the rest of the Pack in the communal kitchen later that afternoon, just starting to prepare dinner.
Draco nodded, an uneasy feeling settling over him. Based on the way Lorcan looked at Harry any time they visited Wolf's Hollow, he was surprised, too. The man clearly loathed any threat to his power with every fiber of his being...but Harry wouldn't lie to him about this. Not unless...he was trying to protect him. No. This was still too big, and Draco had asked him directly. Harry wouldn't lie to him. He
Harry is nearly asleep when Draco snaps his book closed and sets it aside, patting Harry on the head like a puppy. "Alright. Up, Potter. I need to get ready for bed."
good new," Draco smiled, but then his face fell. "I'm not sure how people are going to react to this, though."
Just then, Rosie let out a wail from the other room, upset at being left alone, and they all hurried to check on her.
Harry smiled, liking the newcomer more and more the longer he interacted with him. "Harry, please. And how could you? You've been on the run. Besides, all it means is that you can join the party, if you want. Or we can have some cake sent to your rooms, if you like. I think you'd better come with me for a moment though, your niece will be furious with me if I don't introduce you to her first."
Ron's expression turned serious. "I'm with Hermione. This Lorcan guy doesn't seem like the type who would allow someone to challenge him and live. Harry could just challenge him again in the future, you know?
At this, Harry doubles over, laughing so hard he starts to wheeze, while Draco folds his arms and glares at him until he regains control of himself.
When he was finished, Harry took the mug from him and set it aside, pulling Draco back against him to lie on top of him on the sofa. Draco turned in his arms so that they were lying chest-to-chest, and Harry squirmed as icy fingers slid up the back of his jumper. "Agh! Is that
Draco saw right through his weak attempt at humor and pulled him into a tight hug. Harry released a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. He relaxed and leaned into the embrace, pressing his lips against Draco's cheek.
They sit in silence for a little while, until curiosity and awkwardness prompts Draco to ask a question that he’s been dying to ask for ages.
Harry chuckles softly and stands up to kiss him and slide the ring onto his finger. "Does that mean you have a ring for me, too?"
"I'm sorry to have bothered you," Potter answered softly, and Draco heard the front door open. "I hope things get better soon."
Potter's face gives nothing away, and he says nothing, awkwardly shifting from foot to foot, a folded piece of parchment in his hand.
He grabbed the cloth and dipped it in the cool bowl of water and dabbed at Harry's face, gently wiping the sweaty sheen from his skin before setting the cool rag on his forehead. Harry sighed and shifted slightly, nuzzling his face against Draco's thigh and murmuring unintelligibly in his sleep, one hand curling possessively around Draco's leg.
He turns, and the kiss happens as naturally as if we’d planned it. He throws his arms around my neck and parts his lips and
The she-wolf stood over the young black wolf, growling ferociously as the grey wolf lowered his head and advanced once again, this time with a new target.
“You’re an evil bastard, you know that?” Draco says when he comes out. “And these are very comfortable, you might not get them back.”
"Of course I do. I love you more than anything in this world. If you love Harry, I'm sure that I could come to love him, too."
Harry shook his head sharply. "No. Please—please stay. Would you just...lie down with me? I promise I won't attack you like I did yesterday."
After they eat, Harry grabs something from their bedroom closet, shrinking it and tucking it in his pocket as they pull on coats and boots and gloves, and then Harry holds out a hand. Draco takes it, and they Apparate together, whirling away to wherever Harry is taking them.
He'd also been forced to come to terms with the reality that the more time he spent with Harry, the more attracted to him he was. He'd acknowledged his physical attraction early on; objectively, Harry was a fit, handsome man, and trying to deny it would be futile. Accepting his attraction to his personality, however, had been a little more difficult.
Harry ignores him. “I have to say, I was a little surprised, though. You never mentioned he was so…”
Soon, Potter was inviting him in to eat dinner with him after it got too dark for Quidditch, and Draco realized the loneliness that had seeped into every corner of his life had lessened significantly.
“Ah, but we haven’t been Potter and Malfoy to each other in years,” Harry says sagely. “It’s Harry and Draco now. Has been since that Christmas at Blaise and Gin’s back in...was it 2000?”
Harry smiles at the words and names and initials written and carved into the wood, running his fingers over some of them.
"Working obsessively on the next batch of experimental Wolfsbane. He's not going to rest until we all wake up fresh as daisies the  morning after the full moon, I swear."
Draco sleeps straight through the night, waking to Harry's soft snoring beside him as sunlight trickles through a crack in the curtains. Harry is facing away from him, but Draco can see the movement of each slow breath in his back.
The underground room was enormous. There were at least thirty cells with barred doors and solid walls between them. The center of the room was a large circle. The door to the stairs was also barred.
“Do you want me to try and fix it?” Harry asks, getting up and walking around the back of the sofa. “I’m getting pretty good at it.”
Harry gave his best friend the same forgiving smile he'd flashed Hermione during dinner. "It's alright, Ron. I just wasn't ready yet. Let's try again sometime in the future."
do you get him to go to bed at night?” Potter asks, looking a bit desperate, catching Draco by the arm before he can slip away. “I can’t do another month like last time. I’ll go insane!”
"Lorcan followed Fenrir in nearly everything. He drew the line at following Voldemort, but he still believes we're above using magic. He won't allow it."
"It was alright," Harry shrugged. "I miss getting drinks with Ron, but it's different now. He doesn't want to talk about you, I don't want to talk about the Aurors... It was a bit awkward."
Ron stood and started pulling on his discarded robes. "Wish I could say the same, but I'd better head in. McDougal will have a fit if I'm one minute late again, the git."
Pansy crossed one leg over the other and smiled at them from the other sofa. "I had a feeling this would happen," she chuckled. "The moment I saw you two dancing together at that club, I knew."
"No, we never moved past fully-clothed snogging," Harry brushes his lips against Draco's temple. "This is all new to me, too."
"Not long." Harry walked over, pressing himself firmly against his back as he stood up again, and Draco wrapped an arm up over Harry's neck and turned his head to kiss him softly. "Are you finished?" Harry asked in his ear, voice low.
"I've been pardoned," Harry said. "Hermione managed to restore Ron's memories. Kingsley was under the Imperius Curse, that's what Ron found out that needed to be hidden. Now Kingsley is back, and Robards and McDougal and anyone else who knew what they were doing is going to trial. But we're free—" Harry chokes up a bit at that. "I think it's finally all over, love."
"I'm just going to go sit on the bed, okay?" Draco used a deceptively calm voice as he crossed the room. He knew Harry couldn't understand him, but hoped using a soothing voice would help them both feel calmer. He climbed up onto the bed and sat with his back against the headboard, watching the wolf nervously.
"Tell me everything that happened yesterday after you left. We were worried sick, and Draco told us some of it, but...I want to know your side. Are you doing okay with all of this?"
After dinner, Hermione took the little one, who was drifting off against Harry's shoulder, chubby fingers tightly clutching his shirt, up to bed.
They ran into the house and down the stairs to find another bloody scene. Sofia was lying at the bottom of the stairs, bleeding from a cut on her arm and a dark bruise blooming on the side of her head.
A thrill runs down his spine at the thought as he opens a cupboard and finds the glasses. He fills one with an Aguamenti Charm and walks back over to Harry.
Harry tries to cover another laugh with his fist, snorting inelegantly into his hand. "Alright, let's get you in the tub."
He slumped forward, resting his head on Harry's chest for a moment. He felt a sweltering hand come up to rest on his cheek. Harry was awake again. "Drake... 'm so sorry. I—"
"Yes. But, getting back to how we handle the full moon around here. Some of the pack were concerned when you came down to breakfast smelling of Aconite."
"I didn't do anything to him! And he was being a complete arse! I've done nothing but care about and help Harry since things started between us. I've already apologized to Weasley for my past behavior, I've been polite to him all these years when we've come in contact through my friendship with you, yet somehow I'm
But they were asleep now, Harry curled tightly around Draco's back, an arm thrown possessively over his waist, his face buried in his hair. Draco had a hand intertwined with Harry's in front of him.
"I'm highly evolved, Weasel, I wouldn't expect you to understand," Draco sneered before leaning down to kiss Harry firmly on the lips. "Hello, darling."
He kisses me and tugs at the hem of my shirt and I obediently lift my arms and let him pull it over my head.
When Harry brings Teddy over two weeks later, Draco is annoyed with himself when he can immediately tell that something is wrong with the other man.
"Your concern for your boyfriend is admirable, Mr. Potter, but I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do. Give him the Pain-Relief Potion for his headache, no more than one vial every six hours, it might help a little bit, but the typical flu remedies just won't work. I'm sorry."
Jenkins popped up in front of him. "Master Draco! Master Harry asked me to tell you to meet him up on the rooftop terrace."
I Apparate us to my new flat, feeling embarrassed at the unkempt, barely-unpacked state of it, but Draco doesn’t seem to mind. He looks around curiously before turning to look at me.
“I just don’t understand, Harry.” Draco recognizes Ron’s voice. “I think it’s pretty clear at this point that things could work. I mean, yeah, maybe in the early days I can understand why you would hesitate, but
“I love you,” Draco says, and my brain stops working. My stomach lurches uncomfortably. “I’m still in love with you. I never
Harry shook his head. "No, go—I'm just going to sleep this afternoon," he swallowed the dose of Anti-Nausea and pulled a face at the strong ginger flavor, "prepare for tonight, you know? Go see Hermione and Rosie and give them both a kiss for me, okay?"
"We'll make it official in a few days when things settle down, but consider that a formal job offer. Now, all of you go home and get some rest. That's an order."
"You can say that again," Harry groused as Draco kissed his jaw, hands trailing down his back and tugging him close.
“I don’t intend to let you kiss anyone else ever again.” He attempts an intimidating growl, but the soft smile on his face makes it clear he’s teasing.
At the top, his shoe caught on a loose floorboard and he fell, the bag full of books spilling and tumbling down with him, his wand flying out of his hand.
“That’s more reasonable,” Draco smiles, leaning back in to kiss him again, determined to move past this conversation. He traces a hand down Harry’s chest again, running his fingers over his stomach and down to the waistband of his pyjamas. “May I?”
She threw herself at the bars that prevented her from helping her friend, growling angrily as she bounced off of them again and again.
Harry froze in place for a moment before relaxing and kissing back. "You're just trying to shut me up so you can claim you've won the argument," he murmured.
"Ah, yes. We're very familiar with mandatory family meals. Every second Sunday at the Burrow for mine. Speaking of, you'll probably be expected to attend one of these days, now that you and Harry are...y'know. Officially together. And Harry's doing better. So...plan on that." Ron finished awkwardly.
I lick my lips and glance back up to meet his cold gaze, eyes as hard as the emeralds they so closely resemble in color.
A few days later, when Draco arrived at Grimmauld Place, he found Harry practically bouncing with excitement.
Harry's grin turned suggestive, and Draco smacked him lightly on the arm. "You know what I meant, you arrogant sod."
"Harry Potter, you're under arrest for the murder of Lorcan Yates. After questioning, you'll be taken to Azkaban until a trial date can be set."
"Overwhelming," Harry sighed, "especially the sharp hearing and sense of smell. But I'm getting used to it. It gets a bit easier each day."
Draco glances at him, and Harry looks mortified, his mouth hanging open. He chokes out a horrified, "
"I've tried to write to you so many times since the war, but I never...I never could get the words right. I wanted to make amends, to meet you and Draco, but I just didn't know how—"
Ron was still staring intently at Draco, his fists clenched and his face pale, making his freckles even more prominent than usual.
Harry swallows hard in response and whispers back, “thanks, Draco.” Then louder: “Thanks for these, Dudley. Bye Lottie, it was nice to meet you,” he glances up at the child peeking around the corner at the top of the staircase, “and you, Violet.”
“We could try being...friends? Maybe spend some time together with Teddy and talk about how we want to handle...parenting situations?”
“I would have asked for permission to touch you,” Harry whispers back, going up on one knee, his free hand moving around to rest on Draco’s thigh in the space between them, then sliding up to rest on the waistband of his bottoms, waiting.
Harry pulls him down the street, their hands still clasped firmly together. When Draco stumbles, Harry catches him against his chest, a hand going to his elbow to steady him, and as he looks up into his face Draco thinks explicitly about kissing him, right there on the street.
Harry finally nodded and Apparated them up to the bedroom, where he set Draco on the bed and set about removing his clothes reverently, kissing over every inch of pale skin as it was revealed—worshiping, claiming, loving—Draco's name a broken litany on his lips, until their bond was undeniably sealed.
"Yes, sir!" She answered, saluting him by placing her hand on her forehead before bounding from the room, closing the door softly behind her.
"The other reason I'm here," Harry said. "Is to formally offer your job back. Minister Shacklebolt would love to see you back in your job at Azkaban, if you're interested. He wasn't happy to hear you'd been fired in the chaos after the takeover attempt."
"Gregory McDougal..." Harry mused, "Ron's Auror partner. I've met him briefly. What makes you think...?"
Draco caught him and slowly lowered him to the floor, cringing at the heat coming off of Harry's body.
Blazing green eyes snapped open. Harry stared at him, and Draco stared right back, keeping his gaze steady.
He slid out from under Harry, ignoring his weak protests, and climbed off the bed. He paused at the door and looked back. "Need anything while I'm out?"
"I don't know," Harry responded, his voice tinged with self-doubt. He leaned over to rest his head against Draco's shoulder in a silent plea for support. Draco curled an arm around his waist and lightly squeezed.
Harry had approached him with the information that he and Draco Malfoy were planning on going public with their relationship, hoping to prepare him for the inevitable backlash that such a shocking revelation was likely to incur. Invasive press, reports that Harry was being Imperiused, etc.
She wiped at her eyes and brandished the tiny spoon at him. "Don't test me, Draco. I'm armed with puréed peas."
“Of course,” Draco steps back to let him into the foyer, then shuts the door behind him. “Harry, what are you…?”
"Got lucky?" Draco asked curiously, lifting his head to look at him. "Isn't that a Muggle term for...?"
Harry was on the floor near the fireplace, naked and trembling from head to toe. He opened his eyes and blinked up at him for a moment before groaning and clenching then shut again.
"When the werewolves wake up back in their human forms the next morning, the winner of the challenge is the one who is still alive, obviously. The wolves who hate any challenge to their position prefer it, because they would rather die than be subject to another leader, and if they win, their challenger is dead and can't challenge them again."
"Erm. Help. With a case. Robards is insisting we need help from your department, because the magic is really old or something, and—"
It felt surreal, having him home after so many months apart. Harry grinned to himself. Surreal, but absolutely perfect.
The kiss lasted longer than either of them intended, and, after a long moment, Draco propped himself up on a hand to get a better angle as he aggressively shoved his tongue into Harry's mouth and rolled his hips down against him.
Ron cut him off with a raised hand. "Okay, okay. I'll keep an eye on him, alright? Merlin, you sound like my mother."
Draco had ended the call, stripped off his costume, taken a long hot shower and got ready for bed, and then he'd waited. And waited. And waited. He drifted off sitting on the sofa watching the front door.
George sighs and sinks down further in his chair. “That’s not your fault, Malfoy. That’s just what Harry does.”
"But how would he...it doesn't make sense, Kasper," Lorcan spoke more calmly than he had the entire morning. "He would have had to prepare an official challenge...is it possible? And why?"
And everyone else? They stared. The reactions varied from staring and fawning to mockery and revulsion, presumably because of anti-Veela sentiment. There was actually very little middle ground between the two reactions in the people Draco came into contact with in his life, with one notable exception: Harry.
He hops up onto the counter, feet dangling, and watches Draco wash his hands in the sink on the far wall before climbing up to sit beside him.
"By wizard standards, maybe. As a werewolf, you're single until you're bonded. Come on, you know we'd be good together."
Brandon shrugs and folds his arms, leaning against the side of the kitchen table, a disdainful expression twisting his handsome face. “I just wanted to finally meet him. The Great Harry Potter
He snapped his fingers and a Tempus Charm flashed the time— Red numbers and letters in the dark: 2:37 AM.
Draco's stomach clenched painfully as he read, and then fury flooded through him. He felt his face heating, angry tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. It was disgraceful, it was revolting, it was
“Er, you too.” Dudley shifts nervously from foot to foot. “So, these have been in the attic. Mum and Dad never said a word, but I imagine they arrived around the same time you did.”
“Well, since you’re a recovering invalid,” Draco smirks. “I thought I’d ride you, if that’s alright with you?”
Harry snuggled up against his chest, tangling his legs with Draco's as he wrapped his arms around him and kissed his forehead. "Breakfast?"
"Yeah, I guess I just..." Harry sighs. "I'm so busy now, I haven't been interested in looking for anything...it's just easier this way, isn't it?"
"Why?" Draco asked simply, his tone questioning, but free of the anger and hurt that had painted his features when Harry had rejected him a week earlier.
"Post-game party!" Dean shouts when they come through the portrait hole, just like he does every week no matter who wins the game, as they pass through the Common Room. "We're getting food and Butterbeer from the kitchens! You two coming?"
"Maybe it has to do with the fact that you made me buy this green monstrosity in the first place," Harry teased.
He tried to contact him a few more times, but after several painful weeks without any response, he gave up.
He set his wand next to Harry's and followed him under the covers, sliding right up against Harry's side and burying his face against his neck.
"Hey," Harry tries to pull him into a hug, but Draco keeps him at arm's length. "It's not like that."
“No,” Paul shrugs and picks up his fork, going back to his pasta. “We can still have dinner together on weeknights, it’s not a problem.”
"I love you too," Harry answered without hesitation, even though the words were new, his eyes filled with so much warmth and devotion that it made Draco's heart beat faster. "So much, Draco."
"Thank you, Mrs—I mean, Narcissa. I... He makes me happy, too. Speaking of, I'm late getting back, which he definitely won't be happy about, so I'd better go."
Twenty minutes later, they were all seated around the table, preparing to eat when an unexpected guest came breezing into the kitchen.
Draco snorted in amusement, casting a wordless Protego Charm to keep his wand firmly in his hand. "Is that all you've got, Potter? It's a wonder you lasted thirty seconds against the Dark Lord."
fault. He drives Harry mad, he always has. If he hadn't involved himself, Harry wouldn't be nearly this wound up.
The rest of the pack gathered in the kitchen the next morning, talking quietly while the twins prepared breakfast for everyone.
looks physically ill. "I couldn't stand to be here, Draco. I left a few days before your wedding. I—I went to—Godric, anywhere I could think of—Romania. Bulgaria. France. Australia to stay with Ron and Hermione for a few months, and then I volunteered to go take a training course at MACUSA for ten months that Robards wants to try and implement here for new trainees..."
"I suppose," Harry conceded. "But not Kingsley. He's not going to let McDougal come after me for an official Werewolf Challenge. It's not Wizarding Jurisdiction. It doesn't even make sense."
Harry makes a contented sound, his eyes slipping closed. He looks beautiful, and peaceful. He’s been so stressed lately, Draco likes seeing him calm for once, likes that he’s the one helping Harry to be relaxed like this.
It was a bloody scene before he even reached the house. Mathias was sprawled on the lawn, eyes wide and unseeing while his brother sobbed over his body. Kasper was gasping for breath, crawling toward the porch despite the kitchen knife that protrudes from his abdomen, leaving a trail of blood.
She points, and I follow her gaze to a brunet dancing a little ways away, watching us and staring openly at my forehead. Absolutely not. I shake my head.
"What? I was just going to say we'd be going to get some dinner. I'm famished." Draco said innocently.
“Transfiguration, Charms, Herbology, and…” Harry swallows hard. “Potions.” He sighs and takes a large gulp of wine. “You’re right, though. I’m not too worried about Transfiguration or Charms. I used them a lot as an Auror. And I just need to study up on Herbology, I did okay there in school. But you know I’ve always been pants at Potions.” His gaze drops to his lap.
Everyone in the vicinity ducks and looks around fearfully. Harry has wrapped himself around Ginny protectively, a glimmering Protego Charm already in place, his wand drawn as they look for any sign of a threat.
Draco steps through the Floo and sets a box on top of one of the piles, wiping at his brow. "That's the last of it from the Manor."
"How would I protect him during the full moon? What do you do with Thomas? How do you keep him safe?"
It took several hours to get everything sorted, but with Robards and McDougal subdued and Kingsley back in control, everything
He does, and when he comes back, Harry is sitting on the edge of the sofa and he seems to be on the verge of tears.
"No. My husband Lewis is very supportive. He was a school teacher at a private Wizarding Primary school, before. Now he homeschools her. And Lewis has a close friend, a former colleague, who is able to quietly make the Wolfsbane potion for her. And we created a...a room. For her. For when she transforms. We're making it work as best we can."
And that's a wrap! This epilogue is 1.2k words of pure, self-indulgent fluff, because ultimately I write for myself and I love that shit. (; Hopefully you do, too. Enjoy! Thanks for reading!
"I mean, I know we can't start over, not really, but do you think we could try...being friends? You know, try..." Harry reaches out a hand toward him, "
"Being with me, it's not easy. I don't know why he puts up with it, honestly. Two years of Mind Healing, three years since the fucking war, and I'm still...broken."
Draco sets Teddy’s books on the coffee table and makes his way over. He wakes him by gently shaking his shoulder and saying his name again. Harry startles, nearly knocking over the inkwell, but Draco manages to catch it before it tips over.
"Harry, what are you—?" When Harry kissed him, Draco pulled away, pressing a hand against his chest. "You're not supposed to—
“Well, this is the best I can do without stepping on anyone’s toes, which I’m sure they all appreciated.”
A loud knock on his door startled him out of his thoughts and he slowly got to his feet, wiping at his eyes on his way to open it.
man. Let's go to bed." Harry pushed at his chest, and Draco finally hauled himself up, pulling Harry after him.
We'd been in the kitchen, and his gaze had traveled between the sofa in the living room and the open door to his bedroom, a clear question in his eyes.
, though. I've lost too much. I live in fear of the full moon, of the pain, of forgetting my potion and hurting someone I love— I'm more afraid than I've ever been, Hermione. And given the life I've led so far, that's saying something."
"You told me yourself that you wanted more with Draco. That you were going to ask him to dinner, that you wanted to try and change your relationship into something official. Something permanent. Why couldn't you still do that?"
"My best friend is Muggleborn and I'm in love with Harry-bloody-Potter, who is now a werewolf, and I don't care in the slightest. Seeing Voldemort's demented mind up close during the war showed me just how wrong all of those Pureblood ideals I was raised to believe are. I've rejected them, and I'm a much better person for it. So yes, Mother, I've changed." He finished vehemently.
and he loves Teddy more than anyone, and he’s trying to protect all three of their hearts all at once like the hero he is, completely oblivious to the fact that Draco’s heart is breaking every single day anyway.
"Has he been awake yet this morning?" Ron asked, summoning the chairs by the fireplace over so that he and Hermione could sit beside the bed.
By the time Harry wakes, the Blood-Replenishment potions have done their work, and most of the color has returned to his face.
Ron's expression flitted between annoyance and disgust at the blatant show of familiarity. Draco glared at him until he looked away. If the improvement in Harry's mood and general health were any indication, he belonged exactly where he was, and he really didn't care if Weasley approved or not.
"You don't have to be rude to them," Harry frowns. "They were just giving me an update on their current case."
Draco makes note of where he is in the brewing process for when he comes back, and then he goes out to help this mystery customer.
Kasper put a hand on his arm and met his gaze. "None of us will even touch him, Draco. I swear it. Understand?"
He dashed over to the door and out into the hallway, closing and locking it behind him, a pitiful sob wracking through his body as he slid down the wall to clutch his knees to his chest.
"I know it wasn't easy to disobey your orders," Harry continued. "But I'm very grateful you did. Thank you."
tried it —" He smiled at Rose and got a wide, four-toothed baby-grin in response, "— when your morning sickness was out of control with this one.
Harry’s rolling laughter follows him as Draco goes to the pantry in search of the bottle of Muggle vodka Harry gave
"Oh, Andy," Narcissa sobbed, "I've wanted to make amends, too. But I was afraid you'd never be able to forgive us, forgive me—"
Harry let out a contented sigh into the kiss. No, definitely not. They have lost time to make up for, after all. And an entire weekend to do so before real life could start creeping back in.
Harry shakes his head, squeezing his eyes closed. “I’m so sorry, Draco, I shouldn’t have...I didn’t know. I didn’t
"You're just upset that he didn't swoon at the sight of you like you thought he would," Mathias scoffed.
Harry shook his head, trying to read Draco's carefully masked expression. "No, just... Come back soon, okay?"
Draco shuddered. He was familiar with the pain of Cruciatus, and it was excruciating, so for Transformation to be even
Draco glanced over at him. From the tinge of red rising on Weasley's ears and spreading over his face, Draco knew he was about to witness his famous temper again, and he was infinitely grateful it wasn't directed at him, for once.
“Chinese!” Teddy takes his broom upstairs with him and after a few seconds they hear the shower turn on.
Teddy stares at him and stays silent, lips pressed together. Harry nudges him, looking embarrassed. “Teddy!”
Lorcan sneered. "So, our new super-powerful Alpha brought a Death Eater bodyguard with him. That's cute. Couldn't fend for himself, then?"
The Eighth Year students aren't allowed to participate in school Quidditch games, but that hasn't stopped them from forming their own teams and playing Professor McGonagall-sanctioned games on Thursday evenings.
Harry walked into the Granger-Weasleys the next day to find Hermione huddled over their kitchen table, several books spread out in front of her. Ron was sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace, playing with Rose, both of them focused intently on a large wooden puzzle.
She nodded hesitantly, glancing between him and Harry and biting her lower lip nervously. "Alright. Please be safe, Draco."
Just like it had on his first visit with his parents, the sign—explaining what the place is and why it's been left like this—rises from the ground.
Hermione had wrung her hands in the background, nervously suggesting that they all have dinner soon.
Draco groaned when Harry rolled over for what must have been the hundredth time. He shifted closer, draping an arm over Harry's waist and tucking his head under his chin.
"I won't," Harry said meekly, reaching out for Draco's hand. "I promise," he murmured, no longer looking at Pansy, instead looking directly into his fiancé's eyes as he said the words. Draco nodded and stroked a thumb over his knuckles.
“I'm so sorry, Harry,” he chokes out, looking devastated, “I am. I ruined everything. I don’t expect you to forgive me, but I do want you to know how—how sorry I am.“
, Ron." Harry violently shakes off the hand on his arm, turning away from him. "I can fuck whoever I like, thanks, and I don't care what you or
Another owl flew in the window and dropped a heavy book on his head. Harry caught it, but he didn't toss it directly into the fire like he should have. The title felt like a blow to his stomach.
"Visiting his family. I gave him a few days off. I tried to get him to take a full week after how hard he's been working for me these past few months, but I only managed to talk him up to three days. House Elves," Harry chuckled, shaking his head. "I was happy to make dinner for Parkinson's visit tonight, though. I'm glad she likes Indian food since I've been trying out some of my grandmother's recipes this past year. There's fresh naan warming in the oven from that place we like on Diagon to go with the curry and rice. I didn't dare try and make it all myself. I'm out of practice."
Even after everyone had eaten their fill, the group continued speaking, their voices lowered now because Thomas had fallen asleep still cuddled against Harry's side.
"No, hug you, you prat." Harry loosens his hold, laughing again, and presses a kiss to his pout. "Alright, let's go shower. And then, I was thinking..." He slides his hands down Draco's back to cup his bum. "We should break in our new bed."
His eyes widened in surprise, but then he smiled kindly. "Of course, Healer Gordon. I'd be happy to meet your daughter."
Harry nods. “Yeah, and a Locking Charm too, just to be safe. We’re going to be using those a lot this summer, I imagine.”
"I think you mean the famous Malfoy-Potter feud," Draco smirks, and Harry likes the sight of it. "Alphabetical and all, you know."
Harry looks up, tilting his head to one side. He scrutinizes Draco's face, looking for any sign of mockery, but he finds only sincerity and understanding there.
It says something about the way the relationship dynamics have changed that Weasley doesn’t question this, just sits down beside Draco with a sigh of relief. He also doesn’t question the way Draco has to reach out and touch Harry while he talks, running his fingers through Harry’s hair and over his face, down the side of his arm, finally clutching at the fingers of his hand.
“It’s not,” Harry says kindly, earnestly looking into Draco’s eyes. He’s so close. Draco can see the dark green outline of his irises behind his glasses. Draco thinks he could drown in those eyes, happily. “I forgave you before we were friends. We’re okay, Draco.”
“I wish you well.” Paul drops a couple of Sickles on the table to pay for his half of the meal, brushing a hand over Draco’s shoulder as he leaves.
Harry is staring into the fireplace when Draco returns. He approaches the sofa from behind, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders. “Are you alright?”
Teddy fixes Harry with a stubborn glare that could rival Harry's own. "No. I want to know what's going on."
Draco sighed. "Fine, I promise. I told Hermione I'd let her know what was going on. I'll go over and speak to her and Weasley tonight. Let them know you're going to live and all that."
“Go on,” Ginny nudges Draco forward, and, after shooting her a reproving look, he makes his way over to Harry’s bedside.
Draco shot him a wry grin, then responded with as much dramatic flair as possible. "Fine. You're an insufferable git who should be punished for your impertinence. My mother will hear about this!"
He thought of Harry, and the way he'd looked at him when he'd walked into his room that morning, pure adoration in his brilliant green eyes, how his warm lips felt pressed against Draco's... "
“It was still the wrong decision,” he says softly. “I should have told you. We could have worked it out…I just…I panicked. I loved you
He was still on the bed, but for once, he was wide awake. There was a book on the bedside table, but he wasn't reading at the moment. He was lying on his stomach, clutching a pillow to his chest, his head resting on his arms as he gazed into the fire glowing merrily in the fireplace.
“Starving. How did it turn out?” Draco asks, taking one of the two containers Harry is holding when he offers it.
"Nadine told us that Wolf's Hollow has a dungeon with a big round space in the middle of the cells," Draco commented.
Harry was still lying on the floor on his side. He lifted his head to look at Draco and let out a little whimper.
“Draco,” Harry sets his drink down and moves closer, setting his hand on his shoulder. “Hey, we’re past this already, yeah? I made mistakes too, and we both apologized a long time ago.”
Potter’s eyes narrow at Draco over Teddy’s head before he turns back to the child in his arms. “Nothing is more important than you, Teddy,” he says firmly. “Nothing. Understand?”
Harry looks up from the potion he’s preparing in Draco’s lab at the back of the Apothecary, the third and final practice potion he’s brewed successfully in a row, with no correction or additional direction from Draco beyond the written instructions he’s following.
Thomas approached the bed, uncharacteristically quiet. "I'm really glad you're okay, Harry," he said, his voice shaking.
I let my mind wander, wondering idly if Draco would be willing to help me decorate the new flat, and how long it will be before he’ll move in again, or maybe he already has a flat of his own that he prefers and I’ll move in there...
"Ah," Ron answers for him, to Draco's relief. "Apparently you and I aren't the only ones to criticize Harry's current relationship and end up on his bad side."
"Yeah, Hermione was with Kingsley in his office trying to wake him up. The strain of having the Imperius Curse lifted made him pass out for a few minutes. Ron was distracting Robards and McDougal outside. She used my invisibility cloak to get in Kingsley's office, so they didn't even know she was in there. Genius, really. I showed up right as things were about to get ugly for Ron, but I incapacitated Robards and McDougal and then Kingsley and Hermione came out of his office and took over from there."
" Harry seethes, his temper flaring again, "you'll just go get divorced and suddenly everything will be fine with us? Everything will just go back to the way it used to be?"
He gently presses his mouth to Draco’s, and Draco clutches his shoulders for balance. Harry kisses like he does everything else—with his entire being. It’s intoxicating, the slow, sweet way his lips drag against Draco’s and he’s nowhere near drunk, but it feels a bit like he is. Draco’s brain is cloudy, and all he can think about is how good it feels, how long he’s wanted this, and how it’s better than he ever could have imagined.
Harry rounds the kitchen counter and pours a third cup of tea to offer to her. “Let’s go to the sitting room.”
Draco's expression turned murderous. He spun toward her and drew his wand, and the woman recoiled, hands raised, eyes wide and fearful.
Lottie smiles again, and Draco wants to scream at her about just how wrong she is, but the shattered look in Harry’s eyes, the only evidence in his expression that anything is amiss, forces Draco to hold his tongue.
“Hey,” Harry pushes the door further open with his shoulder so that he can skirt around it as it falls closed again, carefully balancing two containers and two forks in his hands.
Back at St. Mungo's, Draco had been infuriating various Healers all day by refusing to leave Harry's side, much to Harry's amusement.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. "Okay. What if we just tried actually dating and we decide from there? I want to be with
Draco lets out a shuddering sigh. “No. I, um, I kissed him. On the cheek. Earlier today. He ran away after.”
Harry tilted his head and deepened the kiss, bringing a hand up to the nape of Draco's neck and sliding it into his hair.
A wide, effusive smile split her face. "Of course, darling. Now, I imagine you're quite anxious to see Harry in the wake of this morning's Prophet?"
Draco hums in agreement, brushing a kiss over his jaw. “Are you coming back up to bed with me now, or do you need to brood in front of the fire for a while longer?”
Draco was wary of the unattached wolves, but he decided he quite liked the rest of them. They seemed friendly and kind, not unlike Harry himself.
Harry was sitting up, a tray loaded with food and sweets sitting across his lap. "Yeah, I do. But first—Chocolate frog?"
Draco flung his arms around him, fully expecting to be pushed away, but instead Harry broke down, sobbing into Draco's shoulder. Draco held him and cried with him, rubbing his back and carding his fingers through his hair, murmuring soothing words as his own heart broke over and over.
"The food will be ready in ten minutes," Sofia smiled, batting his hand away from the fresh rolls they'd also baked.
"Choose a couple books that would steer her in the right direction, then. The more information she has, the more good she can do. Trust me."
Draco vaguely recalls that rumor going around, through the haze of depression and horror that was Sixth Year. “So it’s…”
Draco stretched languidly, kicking off the sheets and smiling up at him. "Hm. Better not. I'm still feeling a bit...
The smile on Harry’s face looks like every promotional photo of him that Draco has ever seen in the Daily Prophet. In other words, completely fake.
The woman pulled the blanket down and removed the bandages that covered Harry's left leg from the middle of his thigh to just above his ankle. The open wounds had been healed, but much like the bite mark on his shoulder, the internal damage was still clearly visible.
She nodded. "Good. Because I would be furious with him if he allowed you to put yourself in danger, but it seems we're of the same mind. So. Let's talk about something else. Tell me about your work. You said you've been getting a steady stream of orders recently?"
Harry slowly pulled out and waved a hand, Vanishing every trace of the mess they'd just made. Draco smiled and leaned down to kiss him as Harry pulled the quilt back up over them both. Draco settled against his chest, sliding a hand up to tangle in his soft, thick hair.
He'd ended up curled up on the bed with his head in Draco's lap, and playing with his hair had seemed like the natural thing to do. Harry had liked it, had relaxed, had thanked him profusely. Draco had liked it too, touching Harry's hair, comforting him.
I roll back over to face him, brushing a thumb over his lower lip. “It’s alright. I understand better now, why you felt like you had to…” When he opens his eyes, I lean in, sliding a hand over his waist. “C’mere, love.”
