“The Christmas Ball at the Ministry. We should go.”
Harry gave Draco a warning look and sidled carefully toward him. “So, erm, Ron, Hermione’s probably told you by now – “
“Where are we?” Draco shouted back.
Feruza’s eyes were less hooded after hearing Draco’s surname, and she nodded in acknowledgment. “Mr. Malfoy. A pleasure to meet you. I hope you and Harry are very happy together.” She turned back to Ginny and asked as if neither of the men were there, “Can we go now? I am getting very bored with all this.” The gesture she made seemed to encompass the entire scene, and not just Harry and Draco, which made them feel slightly better.
They ended the conversation after she gave him a few more pointers about getting Harry through the day. Draco felt much better after talking to her, and thought he understood now why Harry insisted on talking to her practically every week.
“Can’t say I did. Are we going to fly or what?” Draco had climbed in place behind him, a warm presence at Harry’s back.
“Expecto Patronum!”
She sighed a little as they separated, concern wrinkling her brow. “Maybe he’s not. I’m still not entirely convinced that he’s good enough for you, but I think you’re right about one thing, Harry. We’ve all changed.” She began to put on her coat after accepting it from Draco with an appraising look. “Times are different now, and I’d like to believe that things can change for the better. I guess I’m willing to give him another chance to prove that he’s not just the same old Malfoy.”
Draco, relieved, tried to steer the conversation back toward his original intent. “Right. So. Learning about the Philosopher’s Stone – the
The stranger smiled at him with a little too much understanding, and Harry was at a loss for what to say that might keep his dignity intact. “Aren’t you the cutest. Got a name?”
Draco insisted on not only sleeping over at Harry’s for the first time, but helping him to clean up the mess. Harry objected at first, before remembering that he had climbed down the ladder when he first returned to his flat and that blood was everywhere. It really was a treat to see Draco at work, climbing up and down the ladder, bending down to inspect bloodstains on the wood floor, gathering various materials from the kitchen to clean up, and bending down once more…. Harry came to the sleepy realization that he had been watching Draco’s arse this whole time, and wondered if it was a good idea to jump someone so soon after sustaining an injury like he had.
“Dig it out? Where do you keep it, in one of your potted plants?” Harry, sniggering, avoided Draco’s lazy sideswipe. “Seriously though, we should find it. How much longer till your magic ban is over?”
He was neatly dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans, with curly brown hair and large eyes that were friendly behind rimless glasses. “Name’s Brandon, what’s yours?”
Draco’s look was not angry, nor disappointed, nor even accusatory. He simply looked defeated, like Harry had wrung every last ounce of strength out of him.
“Well, fancy seeing you here, Mysteria,” Draco drawled. “Aren’t you going to introduce me to –
Harry snorted and punched him lightly in the arm. “That’s quite enough from you, Mr. Malfoy. Let me cook something up, won’t be a moment.”
“Great. I can leave you my address.”
Harry was more than willing to oblige, and Draco soon knew much more about computers than he cared to, but it was worth it to see Harry so engaged and enthusiastic about explaining things. To him. Draco wondered if this was what it felt like, being part of the Trio with Granger and Weasley. He’d had his own version of the Trio, of course, consisting of Crabbe and Goyle, but they weren’t so much good for explaining and discussing things as for ordering around.
“Tell you what, Potter. Before we take our next spin around Friendship Lake, why don’t you let me take you shopping. At a proper department store. Seriously, you may be in hiding but we have to upgrade your look a little.”
Hermione chewed her lip for longer than was necessary. “Harry, I don’t know if you realize, but the interview with you and Draco got scuttled at the last minute. Something to do with Ministry interference due to an ongoing investigation, there was a memo about it. I don’t know who was behind it, honestly, but with this new breaking story about Ginny’s would-be attacker, it probably would’ve gotten buried anyway.” He stared at her uncomprehendingly, and she patted his arm in a kindly manner. “I don’t think you’ll be needing your Invisibility Cloak, in other words. Just use one of the side entrances.”
Draco all but rolled his eyes and flung himself onto the couch across from Harry. Well, not so much flung, as gracefully plopped. Harry was intrigued by what he had done with his hair, which was long but not overmuch, and gently waved so that it fell evenly and softened the sharper angles of his face. If it weren’t for the attitude, he almost looked like he could be in a painting himself.
“Well, isn’t that perfect?” Draco purred. “Horny Potter.”
“Of course. Of course Harry Potter has hippogriffs for friends, what I was thinking?”
Draco’s interest was piqued. “What, the Boy Who Lived knows poverty and shame? Tell me more.”
His last four words seemed to shake something loose in Narcissa. “Help? You want to
“It can be, but once you get the theory right, not necessarily. I can walk you through it. You would have to practice though.”
A slight nod was all he got from Draco before they both stood up, and Harry started to gather his things. Draco handed him the wool coat, then hesitated before handing the broom to him. “Just so you know, it’s impossible to Apparate in or out of my place. You’ll probably have to go across the street to the park that’s a few blocks away if you want to fly home, but you should be able to Apparate again once you leave the steps outside my door.”
The details, it seemed, were that Ginny had been spotted at the last few public functions on the arm of one of the Beaters, Feruza Gallagher, an Amazon of a player who had been on the team for at least a year before Ginny joined. “Oh, and get this,” Hermione leaned in with a gleam in her eye. “Cho Chang is going to be playing against the Harpies, once Jessica Corbyn retires as Seeker for Puddlemere.”
Ginny smiled slyly at him. “Thanks, Harry. I think we’re good here, but we can head upstairs if you’re not comfortable with us in the room.”
, he thought to himself, and had just begun to lean forward when Nigel appeared. “Night Harry, it was really great to properly meet you” he said as he jostled past. “Night Draco, call me.”
Thanks to Kbrick for brainstorming on the chapter title! (Besides the usual excellent beta-ness, of course). And thanks to all of you for joining me on this weird little journey through my first contribution to the fandom. Who knows where we’ll all be once the worst of the pandemic has subsided, but for now just know that your clicks, kudos and comments were appreciated.
She told him, and Harry was off like a shot. The lift had never felt slower, and Harry indulged the useless urge to pummel the buttons multiple times. Floor reached, he made a beeline for the Auror’s offices that had once served as his workplace, although it felt like an eternity ago.
Draco was having fewer nightmares, but he wasn’t sure if his developing friendship with Harry had anything to do with it. There was Nigel, who had proved to be much more useful than he had anticipated, after meeting him at a cousin’s wedding in the French Riviera the previous spring. The night had ended in a drunken tryst, and Draco had not expected to run into him in London, yet Nigel had tracked him down and convinced him that meeting up for some fun every now and then was not an unreasonable thing to do. Most recently, in the form of shopping.
Draco watched her go with a tiny lump in his throat. He’d been so bloody
Fluff with a bit of snark (it moves the plot along too, I promise :P). A new character is introduced.
On the nights when Harry slept over, they liked to take morning walks together in the park across the street after breakfast. Harry had hopes of convincing Draco to start running with him, once the weather grew warmer, but for the time being, he was content to amble along in the autumn chill, talking of this and that.
Harry rummaged a bit before informing her that he was out of crumpets. “Never mind, I can bring some,” she replied. “I also have quince jelly I can bring.” There was always something homemade lying around at their home, thanks to Mrs. Weasley.
Draco stretched out one hand and glared at his sofa. “Expecto Patronum.”
Potter sighed. “You’re drunk, and I should go home. Maybe another time.” He took another sip of his tea and stood up. Draco made as if to follow suit, but collapsed back into his chair when the world wobbled too much for standing. “Come on Malfoy, let’s get you into bed. It’s almost – “ he paused for a glance around before landing on the clock in the corner – “ three in the morning. Don’t you have work later?”
Glancing over at Harry, Draco was endeared by the queasy expression on his face, and gave his hand a quick squeeze before turning back to Hermione. “Where would you like me to put this bottle of wine?”
Feruza and Ginny seemed to agree, and began the climb to the second floor, pausing every now and then for a snog or a fondle. They oohed and aaahed when they saw the chandelier, and Ginny worked a little magic so that the crystals flashed through all the colors of the rainbow in time to the music. Once they had reached the guest room, Harry insisted on giving them a little privacy while he went to Draco’s bathroom to freshen up.
Draco felt like a dolt, clutching a rickety old umbrella as they approached the door, which was brightly lit amidst the gloom of the evening. “Just drop it in the hedge over there,” Harry directed him when Draco held up the umbrella. “They can use it for other guests.” Draco complied and stood back as Harry knocked on the door, adorned with a cheery brass knocker in the shape of a Cheshire cat.
Feeling irritated but curious, Draco pressed on. “Why would I need one? What do you do with it, anyway?”
(somehow the finicky gameplay from an older time seemed to fit his Seeker’s precision just right), Harry was ready to move on. Stepping outside into the darkening gloom, he put his head down against the winds and began the walk to his next destination in Camden Town, a pub that he’d heard mentioned a few times in passing. He was curious to visit after hearing rumors that it was haunted by the ghost of a Witch, as well as various otherworldly apparitions.
Harry accepted her handshake, looking mildly terrified. “Er, yes, that is correct. We split up several months ago though. I’m with him now.”
Draco inclined his head slightly. “Weasley. So kind of you and Granger to invite me into your home,” he drawled, as if possessed by his father.
It was highly disorienting to hear his name on Malfoy’s lips, and Harry found himself struggling for words. “Well, I guess you could say I had a crisis, and I felt the best way to avert it was to stop letting people treat me like I was special.” He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, forgetting that he had spent fifteen minutes that morning trying to tame it. “It’s hard to hide from the Wizarding world when you’re celebrated and adored by pretty much everyone in it. I thought it would be best to return to my Muggle roots for a year or so, figure things out.”
Harry felt relief mixed with frustration at the cryptic lack of detail. “I don’t know why I listened to the Mediwizard, I should have gone to the hospital straight away, press be damned.” He ran one hand distractedly through his hair, which seemed to have gone back to its usual unruly ways. “D’you think you could help me get in, if I get my Invisibility Cloak?”
“With Draco, I think the attraction just grew naturally out of our shared history, and our desire to let go of the hate that had colored so much of it. Life is too short for holding grudges, and I think both of us have had more than our fair share of scarring experiences.” He paused for breath and looked at Draco, his eyes wide with epiphany. “Quite literally, we both have scars that we will never completely heal from. And I respect what Draco has gone through, just as he respects me. It doesn’t matter if he was raised to believe that Purebloods were meant to rule the earth and that Muggles were scum. I think it’s possible to transform those views, in a process of personal alchemy.” Harry looked surprised by the words coming out of his mouth, and Draco could hardly sit still, he was so overcome with love for him. “We are both humans, even as magic runs through our veins. And I want to honor that.”
“It’s really okay, Nigel works here and gets a great discount.”
His hands were hovering threateningly near to Draco’s ribcage, so he relented. “All right then. It’s Drake Macavoy. Like the author.”
Harry picked up his coat from the back of the chair and slung it over one arm. “Home.” Seeing Draco’s growing alarm, he gently added, “Surely you don’t think you’ve recovered enough to leave St. Mungo’s yet, do you?” He sighed. “Besides, I doubt the Ministry will let you go anywhere, they probably think you’re a flight risk.”
Harry watched Malfoy with fascination, as surreptitiously as he could while packed cheek by jowl into a booth with him. With each drink, he appeared to become more playful, chucking one person under the chin, caressing the palm of another, engaging in witty banter. No kissing this time, which was probably for the better. Harry was still getting used to the idea of his former arch-nemesis as a human being with feelings, let alone feelings for the same sex.
“Tell me something helpful you did this week, Mr. Macavoy.”
, Draco thought wryly to himself as he collapsed into Harry’s waiting arms.
“Of course I did, you gorgeous wanker.”
Harry stared, then chuckled weakly, to his great relief, and accepted Draco’s embrace. “You do look very green today,” he commented after a long moment had passed. “I like it though.” He fingered Draco’s thin scarf and twined his other hand through Draco’s, then leaned in for a kiss. Another male couple walking by with their dog whistled at them.
Harry was aware of Draco’s gaze but was too absorbed in his new idea to take much notice. He gathered up a few more layers – it was getting chilly with nothing on except his underwear – and opened up the door to the wardrobe. The sight that greeted him was both impressive and intimidating.
Their plan was foiled by Ginny, who had reappeared at their side, this time on the arm of a towering and muscular young woman who ignored Draco and introduced herself to Harry. “It’s Feruza,” she stated, holding out a hand to shake. “I understand you and Ginny were once an item?”
“Where did you go?” Draco cut him off. “I haven’t heard from you in five days. Can you at least tell me what you’ve been doing? How did you get to this point?”
Tomorrow came, and Harry was a nervous wreck.
Draco sniffed. “I suppose that’s why you might have found Ginny attractive, then? Hair like Mum’s, and all that?”
Besides checking in with Hermione, and night flying, and seeking out various Muggle forms of entertainment that didn’t involve much human interaction, Harry’s life was simple. Too simple. And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to start anything new that might get his life moving again. He had lost the Gryffindor Seeker’s spirit that had once led him into all sorts of trouble, both good and bad, and was on the way to becoming a Boy Who Coasted, nothing more.
With Harry effing Potter, of all people.
Harry’s eyes had disappeared again, and he reached out blindly for a hug. “I’ve just gotten so used to not being the center of attention this past year, I don’t know if I can handle this level of publicity again, all at once.” His breathing had grown rapid, and Draco held him close until he was able to stop hyperventilating.
Harry glanced up briefly, frowning at the interruption. “What’s that?” He followed Draco’s gaze back over his shoulder, and saw Ginny approaching. The look on his face would have been noteworthy, if Draco hadn’t suddenly grown worried about their safety. Someone had appeared on the red carpet, situated midway between where Harry and Draco, and Ginny and Feruza, were standing, and judging from the expression on the security guards’ faces, they were not supposed to be there.
It was the curiosity that won out in the end. Instead of parking himself in the den or the kitchen, Harry silently tiptoed up the stairs and paused on the landing, outside the bedroom door, which was closed. He couldn’t hear much through the door, and before he lost his nerve, he cast a quick spell that allowed him to see through the door without detection.
As if on cue, the young man looked up and saw Draco, with no sign of recognition on his face. “Excuse me, do you work here?”
Draco shrugged, still smirking a little. “I’m just getting started – we're working our way up to better things.”
Draco looked over at him and marveled at how calm he seemed to be, in comparison to the nervous wreck he had been just the night before. His own insides felt like they had been replaced by a Venemous Tentacula, and without the numbing wash of alcohol to distract him, he felt like he might be sick. Holding Harry’s hand seemed like the best possible alternative, so he did. Despite their little tiff earlier, Harry didn’t seem to mind.
Retracing those feelings, Harry came to his senses with a sudden jolt of adrenaline. Dear Godric, what had he been thinking? Telling Hermione to say hello to Draco on his behalf? It might lead to all sorts of things that he wasn’t prepared for, mentally or emotionally. Or physically, for that matter. He hadn’t exactly been prioritizing his appearance since he became an Auror instructor, and suspected that he was rather scruffier and pudgier around the middle than the last time anyone had seen him anywhere near undressed.
The clock chirped, reminding him that it was a quarter to eleven and time to start dressing for work. Draco stood up slowly and hand-spelled his breakfast tray to float back to the sink, where the auto-wash feature kicked in after Vanishing the remaining scraps of crumpet and blood sausage. The mug remained on the table in the kitchen nook, awaiting its usual second filling. But Draco had had enough, and left it where it was, choosing instead to walk upstairs and begin changing into Muggle clothing. It had been an adjustment, leaving his robes behind and picking out a wardrobe of Muggle fashion with the help of a stylist. In the end though, it had helped to enhance his appeal, and for the first time in his life, Draco actually felt likeable. Not just another power broker in the ruthless rules of the game set by the Pureblood circle he was born into.
“Yes, of course you can, you tosser.” Harry felt his heart rate increase as he fumbled Draco’s fly open and slipped in under the waistband of his pants, taking him into his hand. It felt familiar, like wanking, but more thrilling because he didn’t know what kind of reaction to expect. He was flying blind, with only Draco to guide him through the motions to a safe and satisfying landing.
He needn’t have worried, as Draco took one of his arms and leaned in to give him a quick kiss on the cheek. He seemed to instinctively know that Harry might not be ready for anything public just yet. Harry wondered if he had gained some experience in discretion through his string of Muggle lovers.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was, to put it mildly, out of his element. What had he been thinking, climbing onto a roof and getting onto a broom with Harry, let alone Apparating with him? Who did he think he was, going along with this hare-brained Gryffindor scheme?
Ginny laughed out loud at that, and Draco felt pleased with himself. “So long as you don’t put any of us in mortal danger, I think the Weasley clan can adapt to almost anything, but you’re right, Ron is such an easy mark.”
“Wow, that Z’s hit you really hard by now, eh, Harry?” Draco’s arms were gentle as he guided Harry back into the bedroom. “Let’s establish a safe zone for ourselves. I don’t want you ending up anywhere you don’t want to be.” Harry’s eyes were closed, and he murmured something unintelligible. “I’m sorry, what was that?”
Hermione answered the door and shooed them both inside. “It’s a bit of a mess, sorry about that.” She was dressed in comfortable Muggle clothing but had made some effort to tame her hair and might have been wearing makeup. “Ron and I are still figuring out what decorating scheme we want, so it might feel a little – odd.”
Harry did know, and he promised to explain when she arrived. “How do you like your eggs, Hermione? Poached, fried, boiled or scrambled?”
Draco turned over to look at him, his mouth serious but his eyes playful. “Not until I’ve finished having my way with you,” he teased. “But I think we’ve reached our limit on this experiment of ours for today.”
Draco noticed how he lingered over the portrait and came up behind Harry, nestling his chin against one shoulder as he wrapped his arms around him. “You like the Man Ray, do you?”
Draco laughed to himself, remembering how all sorts of misinformation had circulated in the Slytherin dorms about gay sex, before he found out from Blaise how good it could feel. “It’s fine, Harry, we’ll get there when you’re ready. I will tell you this, it’s a whole other world of fun that would be a shame to miss out on.”
Malfoy chuckled, a sound almost as foreign to Harry’s ears as the sound of his name. “I have to hand it to you, Potter, you do surprise me sometimes.” He stopped chuckling at Harry’s look. “Sorry. Harry. I thought you loved getting all that attention, being you. And a Gryffindor.”
“That sounds like a lot to hold,” said Harry, breaking away from the hug and looking Draco in the eyes. “I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, yet here you are, carrying on as best you know how.” He turned back toward the stove and lowered the flame, giving something in a pot a stir. “Our break – er, meal is almost ready, could you get some plates out of the cabinet over there?”
“With a little of this in you, we’ll be dancing all night long.” Draco backtracked when Harry glared at him. “Only if you want to, of course. But I would like to play some music for you.”
Draco took one of Harry’s hands and guided it to his cheek, reaching out to brush Harry’s cheek in a gestured echo. He couldn’t believe it had taken him this long to notice just how green his eyes were, or how delicately the scar on his forehead shone, even through the wayward fringe. He was, quite frankly, beautiful. “Everything is the matter. And nothing at all.”
Pansy’s smile was as wide and wicked as ever, although there was a bit of sadness there now too. “That’s simplifying it a bit, but yes. It wasn’t just the cult of Voldemort either, Dumbledore had the makings of a cult leader too.” She sipped from a champagne flute and continued. “I don’t know if you’ve talked much to Potter or his friends at all since the War, but I’m sure they were just as traumatized in their own way, even if they ended up on the winning side.” She sipped again and crossed her arms. “Still doesn’t mean I don’t want to punch the lot of them when I see their arrogant faces. Potter was the worst, poncing around with his intractable impulse to do good, not to mention those glasses and that bloody scar. Hasn’t he ever heard of corrective spells?”
“Speaking of which – “ Draco’s head disappeared behind the door, and Harry returned to the business of putting on the shirt at hand, which was rather tight for his liking, although the fabric felt wonderful against his skin. No sooner had he finished buttoning up, he had another fright as Draco poked his head back in, this time with company.
Harry couldn’t begin to picture what could be better than the last half hour, but he put it to the back of his mind when he remembered that Draco hadn’t had satisfaction yet. “Come here, you.” He made as if to kiss Draco, but the blond handed him the blindfold first. Harry tied it on him with trembling fingers. How could he hope to live up to Draco’s artistry, with the little experience he had?
“Harry. It may shock you to hear this, but sometimes I say things I don’t mean. I even make up stuff just to sound cool. Especially when I want to impress someone. Like the Boy Who Lived, for example.”
Brandon smiled and took the seat next to Harry. “I can help you out with ordering a drink, if you promise to let me pay for it.” His accent was American but not obnoxiously so, and Harry did not know how to respond at first. But he was thirsty, and lonely, and his tongue was throbbing and he had no further plans for the evening to keep himself from moping, so he went along with it. “Sure, why not.”
“Why don’t the two of you get better acquainted while I gather the noshables. Nigel, can you get Harry something to drink?” Draco asked as he left for the kitchen.
“Yeah, I have it somewhere, but I don’t think it’ll work properly outside of Hogwarts.”
“Harry, Harry, over here!” One voice stood out from the crowd, and Harry paused to look around and identify who it was. A security guard opened the barrier and let someone in, dressed in gauzy pink robes and a glittering tiara. As she approached, Draco recognized her and hesitated to greet her, considering the circumstances of their last meeting.
Draco couldn’t tell who was more shocked, him or Harry. Their shock registered in different ways, however. Harry’s response was to the news about Cho, while Draco was more astounded to hear that Ginny dated women. The topic was still fresh on their minds as they prepared to head to Draco’s with the help of a fresh Portkey.
Harry gnawed on his lower lip and nodded. This was worse than his first time with Ginny – at least they were both virgins, although Ginny had had more of a repertoire of moves than Harry. He colored a bit when he thought of how clueless he had been, and how clueless he must seem now to Draco.
Malfoy stood with cold fury writ large on his face. “I think we’ve had enough of this conversation. Unless you can give me a reason not to escort you out of my home.”
“Well, let’s just see if we can do something about that.”
“Harry?”
At that precise moment, his eyes landed on Draco’s arm again, still bare as he buckled up his belt. The pattern of scarring revealed itself as the faint outline of a Dark Mark, long inactive, yet lingering like the trace of a bad dream, and Harry suddenly remembered an earlier Draco, alone and terrified in a bathroom at Hogwarts before Harry had torn into his chest with that vicious spell. It occurred to Harry that some part of Draco might still be stuck in that place, unable to unleash his innermost feelings around others, and he felt a twinge of empathy. Impulsively, he stepped forward to grab him from behind, placing a long, wet kiss on the side of his neck.
Draco smiled back, crookedly. “Just be thankful I’m not wearing fur-lined robes,
He could also track his decision to the moment when Luna’s interview for Wizarding Vogue had been published, a few weeks after he and Draco had gone their separate ways. She’d called him up beforehand to do some last-minute fact-checking, and he still remembered the sinking feeling of opening the magazine, to see them photographed together on the page, trapped in an eternal cycle of smiles and waves on his part, and a smoldering stare from Draco. The article itself wasn’t too bad – he thought Luna had done very well in encapsulating their message of unity without hammering home the point that they were once a couple. Or maybe she genuinely hadn’t thought to write much about it, as she tended to have her head in the clouds much of the time. Regardless, he had finished reading the article with his pride more or less intact. He’d been tempted afterward to show up at Draco’s townhome on the fly, but when he reached out to the Ministry they’d told him that Draco had moved away. He was too embarrassed at his behavior and fearful of Draco’s reaction to try spelling him, and that was the end of that.
Harry willed himself not to blush, but he wasn’t sure how successful he was in the attempt. “I was there looking for you. Because I was curious. About you, after seeing you at that bookshop.” He took refuge in another bite of scone. “Malfoy, the last time I saw you, you were on trial for aiding and abetting Voldemort. Hobnobbing with queer Muggles is about as far from my previous image of you as I can get.”
First, there was Philippe the stylist. Fortunately he was a Muggle and drew upon a team of other Muggles who had no idea who Harry was, except as Draco’s paramour. To his surprise, Mysteria was part of the team, as a makeup artist, and he had a pleasant enough time catching up with them while Draco talked clothing with Philippe. Harry was impressed to see that Draco was subtly working in a Wizarding theme, without revealing that they were actually Wizards.
Nothing happened, and Draco frowned. “Lumos,” he spoke clearly, and the wand finally responded with a weak glow of light at its tip. “I wonder if its allegiance is still to you, Harry.”
Mysteria leapt in to save him. “Why don’t we get him a mocktail.” It was a statement, not a question, and Draco sought revenge by ordering Potter the fruitiest mocktail possible, embellished with an umbrella. Potter hardly batted an eyelid when the drink arrived, turning his attention back to Draco after his first sip.
“Yeah, well, look where my father ended up. I almost – “ he paused, struggling with himself – “I almost wish my father had just stayed there, in Azkaban. Rather than being beholden to the Dark Lord. At least he was still mostly proud of me back then, and could behave like a human being.”
Was that the best he could come up with? He wanted to fall weeping on Harry’s neck like a courtesan in an overwrought novel and then carry him away to his own private island like a glamorous film star to shag him senseless, followed by a nice long cuddle.  It was a hopeless dream and it was not to be taken seriously, even though he’d thought about it many times before.
She shushed him and got him up to his feet. “Yes, yes, I know. But first we have to take care of the bleeding.” Once they made it back to the bathroom, she managed to get him propped up against the basin, with his good ear pressed against the mirror. “I’m sorry Harry, this is going to sting a little.”
“Look, I’m way out of my depth here. Can the two of you stop messing around and help me find something that actually works? I’m about ready to give up, honestly, and I haven’t tried but the one shirt on.”
Draco was waiting for an explanation of his own. After everyone had left, he surveyed the damage done to multiple surfaces in Harry’s home, visibly shuddered, and put it out of his mind. First things first.
Draco shifted closer to Harry on the couch with the air of a mother cat preparing to give a good tongue-washing. “I think they said one phial every two hours, for the first eight hours. Then taper off to one phial every four hours.” He read over the labels and nodded before fixing his attention on Harry again. “It is possible to repair your vision so you don’t need glasses all the time, you know. I’m a little near-sighted myself, but I went in for a course of Re-Vision treatments twice and managed to see normally again by the end of it.” He handed a dose to Harry and motioned for him to drink. “You should consider trying it sometime.”
“You’re doing really great, Draco.” Harry’s expression was nothing short of beaming. “I think that’s plenty for today.”
Draco paused, gathering himself. He wasn’t sure if what he felt was more annoyance or curiosity, but in the end curiosity won the battle and he approached the young man, who did indeed appear to be none other than the famous Harry Potter.
“What about you, surely you haven’t been moping around at home all this time? Knowing you, you probably went to a pub a day, and had a grand old time.”
“A gigolo. A high-class male escort. Or possibly a thirteenth-century troubadour.”
Harry tried not to look too hot and bothered about it, but Draco noticed his expression and laughed a little. “Feeling a little differently about our schoolboy rivalry, are you?” He began to dress himself then, sweeping a hand over his groin with a quick cleansing spell before putting his silk boxers and wool trousers back on. “Don’t be too flattered, I don’t think there was anything sexual behind it. Maybe the beginnings of attraction in some form, once we got past puberty. But then, well, as you know, we were both busy with other things.”
Draco thought that was rich, after he had taken not just Harry but also
He shrugged and turned his head away. “Oi, Lacey! Got any extra brooms in the back you can bring up here?”
But. There was always a but, and this was a big one. What if his massive need to connect with Draco right now was motivated by pure selfishness, and not truly by a desire to make the world a better place for queer Wizards? Was it really worth the upset it had already caused among Draco’s family, with him in such a precarious position with Wizarding law? For the first time, Harry wondered to himself if Draco did in fact cast a Killing Curse, or if it was all some big setup.
Apparating to Malfoy’s street was easy, but as he approached the short flight of steps leading up to his front door, Harry felt his heart rate increase with disbelief at what he was about to do.
“Language, Harry,” he murmured into Harry’s newly healed ear, which looked like it could use some attention. At a loss, he gave him a quick kiss to the cheek and a comforting rub to the back before turning to Hermione. “Sorry, I know this must be awkward. Can’t we just – I don’t know, let bygones be bygones?” He held out a hand to her, feeling most un-Slytherin-like. She accepted it as if in a dream, one that was not entirely pleasant but held potential for redemption.
Draco did not have a witty response for this. Truly, Harry was a Gryffindor to the bone, and Draco would have to accept it, whether he liked it or not. And he was starting to realize that he did like it, despite his better judgment.
Feruza turned her hooded gaze upon Draco. “Who is he.”
Draco closed his eyes and leaned back. “No, not exactly. I haven’t even told them that he and I are friends now, let alone that we’re seeing each other.”
Harry couldn’t believe how surreal and precious it felt to have Draco Malfoy sleeping on his shoulder, and so soon after their glorious first tumble. But the feeling was short-lived. He was due for his weekly chat with Hermione, and didn’t want to arouse suspicion by not showing up. After some mental dithering, he conjured a Body Pillow spell and left Draco half-lying on the couch, propped up as if by an invisible Harry shape. Draco barely stirred, and Harry hoped he wouldn’t wake up before he finished the call.
Draco raised his eyebrows, but refrained from making any comment. “Cheers.”
She was also naked, and doing something naughty with one hand, but Draco was much more worked up about the levitating part. Looking down at Harry, he saw that his eyes were wide open and fixed on the sight of Ginny in the doorway. A tiny smirk hovered around his mouth, and Draco felt indignant enough to slap a hand on his chest. “Harry! Enough with the Levitating, and put your eyes back in your head. I thought you only wanted to do that with me!”
“So, what was it that you wanted to tell me last night?”
Perfectly normal, eh? Two could play at that game, Harry resolved, and he started to shuffle his own deck of cards. The music scintillated on in the background as they began to play.
“I don’t know. Let me think about it. I – I had hoped to meet your mother first before she got wind of this – you know, our relationship.”
Harry tried to feel annoyed but couldn’t, not with the smattering of luck still bubbling through his veins. “Doesn’t matter much when I’m trying to blend in. Come on, pick something out.”
He felt like he had been reprimanded, and subsided into silence. Hermione broke it first, with an unexpected question. “Draco, are you happy? With all this?”
Harry refused to let him take off his glasses at first because he didn’t want to miss a second of Draco, only to discover that he wanted to tie a scarf around his eyes so that he could relax more fully into his other senses. “I promise I won’t do anything that might hurt,” Draco told him, “although some things might feel surprising. Just let me know if you ever get uncomfortable.”
Harry pulled his coat closer around him. They were on their usual morning walk together, but he was beginning to regret it in the face of the rising wind. And the current topic of conversation. “It may come as a shock to you, but I’ve never much enjoyed public events. At least, not events where I might be noticed.” He paused. “Well, except for Quidditch, but even then I would always get nervous before a game.”
Harry glanced around wildly for any familiar landmarks, then discovered with relief that he was standing above his own skylight. “I’m on the roof, at home. I just got back from an outing gone wrong, I can explain - ”
Before either of them could say more, the Mediwizard ushered over a team with a stretcher and carefully began Levitating Draco onto it, after casting a Body-Bind Charm to keep him stable. “All right, Mr. Malfoy, we’re going to Portkey you to St. Mungo’s, where we have another team ready to examine you and fix you up. Mr. Potter, I’m going to have to ask you to stay put. We don’t need another mob of reporters rushing St. Mungo’s right now. But, I promise you, we will keep you updated about Mr. Malfoy’s condition.” He handed Harry a small object, which turned out to be similar to the coins Hermione had transformed with a Protean Charm during the days of Dumbledore’s Army, before the Battle of Hogwarts. “Now if you’ll excuse us, we have a life to save.”
Trust him? Draco had not been inclined to trust Harry – well, ever - but tonight, with two Felici-Fizzes in him and a pleasant hum of anticipation in his chest at the thought of flying again, he couldn’t exactly say no. “Sure, why not. Let’s give it a go.”
Harry shrugged and resumed looking at a portrait on the wall. This one was nice, a softly focused image in black and white of a model looking away from the photographer, head tipped back in a gesture of abandon. He thought the model looked a bit like Draco, with his long neck, elegant jawline and soft waves of blond hair.
“When did you come to the realization that you wanted to study this topic, Mr. Macavoy?”
Harry started a little when Draco scootched his chair over to sit closer to him, close enough that their thighs were touching. It soon became all too clear what Draco’s intentions were, and Harry found his erection was swiftly making a comeback as Draco’s hand trailed across his trousers. Harry didn’t know whether it was Draco’s insouciant expression as he fondled Harry that did him in, or the quiet assurance of his hand’s movements, but he did know that he wanted Draco to himself in a bad way, preferably in a room with less people.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry yawned and reached somewhere to put on his glasses. “Yeah, I had a hard time falling asleep last night. Too many video games.”
Draco’s lips were clenched together, and Harry wondered if he’d gone too far. The firming of his grip on Harry’s hand, however, put his fears to rest. “No. I want to go through with this, my parents need to know. The Wizarding world needs to know.” He sighed and released his grip. “Besides, we look too good to be all dressed up with no place to go.”
They rode the rest of the way in chilly silence, with Draco taking sips from a tiny bottle of Ogdens out of the mini-bar as they got closer. Harry finally put out a restraining hand when he emptied it and reached for another. “Careful there, I don’t want you sozzled before we even get inside. There will be plenty of drinks, trust me.”
“You stay here, I’m going to get us some breakfast.” Draco pulled on a plush velvet robe and disappeared through the doorway to the landing. Harry was left to his musings about Draco’s Patronus, and the inklings of an idea that he wanted to share with Draco when he returned.
The night wore on into the wee hours, and the bar staff were clearly ready to start closing down by time the group made up its mind to go. Harry felt a moment of unease as he watched Malfoy stumble toward the loo, and wondered if he should step in and make sure he was all right. But he needn’t have worried, as the rest of the group were just as concerned with Malfoy’s wellbeing. It was at Mysteria’s insistence that Harry accompanied them all the way back to Malfoy’s street, and it was equally Mysteria’s insistence that Harry be the one to take him inside and make sure he was all right before leaving. “You still need to catch up, love,” they told Harry with a wink, when Harry might have protested.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, my arse always looks amazing.”
She sighed, and threw up her hands in surrender. “I’m only doing it because I can see you need rest, Harry. I would stay overnight myself, but I don’t want Ron to be worried. Don’t have kittens, I won’t tell him about the two of you just yet,” she added, when Draco opened his mouth to object. “But I do want you to think long and hard about what you want to say to me tomorrow. No effing around, I mean it.” She punctuated her words with a glare. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be on my way.”
“You found it.” Draco had reemerged from his bath and stood behind Harry, wrapped in nothing but luxuriously fluffy towels around waist and shoulders. He looked almost gaunt with his hair still wet, the cut of his cheekbones more prominent than ever, but Harry was too elated with his discovery to notice. “Feel familiar?”
She only paused for a couple of seconds before rallying. “Harry, I need you to tell me where you are, and then I can help you.”
He began to reconsider that assessment when a pair of fantastically dressed drag queens made an appearance from behind the curtain, cheered on by a small crowd that had gathered in front of the stage area. Fascinated despite himself, Harry watched the show from the bar while he inhaled chips, burning his tongue a little in the process. He tried to get the barkeep’s attention so he could order something cooling to drink but found himself S.O.L. as a very chatty group of young women had arrived and seemed intent on ordering half the menu.
The sun had just slipped over the horizon when Harry Apparated to Draco’s street. Nervously flattening his fringe and adjusting his new clothes, Harry rang the doorbell. The long pause that followed made Harry wonder if he had the wrong time, and he was on the verge of taking out his wand to spell Draco when the door opened. It was Draco, but as Harry had never seen him.
“Right.” Harry regained the presence of mind to kneel and unfasten the skylight. It was shaky going down the ladder, but he managed to get back to ground in one piece. “Almost one piece,” he corrected himself out loud.
This chapter contains a bit of violence, although nothing explicit. Harry and Draco learn that they have aliases, and Luna makes an appearance.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded. “Yeah, okay, I think I can do that. As long as you tell me if I’m doing anything wrong.”
Harry looked slightly reassured. “Yeah, I guess there’s no harm, as long as we’re in a contained space, with people we know. Mostly.” He eyed Feruza uncertainly. “I don’t know about her, she scares me a little. Where do you think she’s from, Romania?”
Huh. So Malfoy batted for the other team now? This was news to Harry. Or perhaps it wasn’t, as he couldn’t recall a time when Malfoy was clearly one way or the other, nor when he had cared about anything but besting him. The wink from the bookstore clerk made a little more sense to him now, and Harry felt himself suddenly engulfed by horror at the thought that Malfoy might know that he was asking after him. Or that the clerk might think Harry was – you know. Queer.
When he opened the door, Hermione came barreling through, lugging what looked like a fat briefcase. “I’m sorry it took so long, I couldn’t remember exactly what your place looked like and didn’t want to risk Splinching myself, so I Apparated a few blocks away.” She paused to take a breath and scanned him anxiously. “Oh Harry, look at you. Let me see how bad it is, let me see.”
Harry had had enough of walking. “Let’s turn around and go home, I’m bloody freezing.”
“Seriously? What kind of a discount is going to make any difference with seven thousand pounds? What does that even translate to in Galleons?”
“Fair enough.” Hermione sat back and rested a hand on her swollen belly. “Oof. Pregnancy is no joke,” she grumbled, and rubbed her lower back with the other hand. “Sorry, I digress. The reason I’m bringing this up now is because I think it could be important for the Muggle-Wizard relations committee meeting coming up. The one you agreed to come to?”
Ginny puffed out her cheeks in an exaggerated sigh. “You’re telling me. I haven’t even seen Fer since I left the safe house, once they were able to determine that the attacker was acting alone.” She dropped down into a chair and stretched out her legs. “It was not a fun experience, between not knowing what was going on and hearing bits and pieces from Ron about the case. I don’t even know how he managed to figure out where the gun came from and how it came to be cursed; he must be a better analyst than I give him credit for." She smiled fondly at Harry. "The only thing that made the week slightly more bearable, besides getting to spend some uninterrupted time with Fer, was getting caught up on the latest season of Buffy, thanks to Hermione taping them.”
First, a prophylactic charm, another reflex from his blackout party days. Then, a wordless look up at Draco to ascertain consent, followed by a lowering of the head, drawing back silk to have a good look at him. Harry thought that Draco had a very nice cock, all pink and velvety smooth and longer than he had imagined. Even with no personal frame of reference, he could remember what it felt like to be on the receiving end and did his best, giving him a long, lingering lick before taking him into his mouth and seeing how far back in his throat he could go. Draco’s flustered reactions made it more than worth any mild discomfort to Harry.
It’s turning out to be a looooong day for Draco and Harry. More explicit sexual activity, and an important conversation between Harry and Hermione, take place.
Draco didn’t have anything to say to that, but the comforting squeeze he gave to Harry’s upper arm as they moved on to the next gallery made him feel better.
Then came the momentous decision of what to wear. He liked Draco’s style of dressing at home, casual but not to the point of sloppiness. He also liked that Draco didn’t wear shoes indoors, and considered constructing a temporary shoe rack, but ultimately decided against it because there was simply no room. “Tiny” did not begin to properly describe the size of his flat, and it took some creative maneuvering to get the table set just right.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shushed him and carried on. “Anyway, we started doing more stuff together – shopping, flying, things like that – and it gradually turned into something more – “
“So Potter, tell me more about this business of leaving the Wizarding world behind.” Malfoy stirred his tea spoon laconically, but Harry picked up on some genuine interest behind the cool façade. “Surely the Boy Who Lived must miss being a celebrity.”
“All right, you win, dancing can be fun.” He bent over to catch his breath a little. “But I’m not ready to do it in public.”
Harry swallowed. “Okay, I can do that. Is it all right if I call you Draco? I should have asked before.”
His own testimony passed in a blur of sweaty hands and a lump in his throat that refused to go away however much he swallowed. Hermione patted his hand when he sat down, and Ron reached forward to grab both shoulders from behind in a gesture of manly solidarity. Harry wished they wouldn’t. He had never felt so isolated, yet so leery of being touched by others, as during the interminable week that had stretched out between his vigil at St. Mungo’s and today. Feeling as useless as he did, and going for so long without being able to communicate with Draco, was taking its toll on his mental health.
“Hey, thanks Draco. For this. It was – fun, sort of. I mean, as fun as possible for the amount of time we had.”
“Wait – wait – Draco, I want to tell you something.” Draco paused and gave him a long look rife with hunger that would not be satiated easily, then rolled over to one side to see what Harry would say. His arousal was painfully obvious, and Harry felt a matching flicker of desire in his own groin, but willed himself to hold back, at least for the time being. He wanted to clear up a few things first. “It might be a bit obvious, but… I don’t really know what I’m doing. With this,” he waved one hand vaguely over the bed, “and with you.”
It was Thursday morning when Draco set down his Earl Grey and activated a com-spell to buzz Harry’s wand. Harry took a while to respond, and Draco could see that he hadn’t slept very well. “Someone’s got a serious case of bedhead this morning,” he commented, by way of greeting.
“What, with getting to know Harry? Oh, you mean the publicity.” He blinked and considered. “I think a part of me is happy with the idea that we won’t have to hide for much longer. It almost felt like we weren’t taking things seriously enough, keeping it all under the radar the way we were. Harry doesn’t want to pass up the opportunity for showing the world new possibilities, and I don’t want to give up what I have with Harry.” He gulped as soon as he said it, hating himself for being so vulnerable in front of
say anything. “You know, rubies have magical properties. Something about stimulating creative forces, through blood and through the reproductive organs. It’s also one of the hardest gemstones in the world, second only to diamonds.”
“Of course I do,” he breathed, after the kiss was over. “I’m having too much fun to get hung up on something as silly as planning for the future right now. Although I do rather hate the idea of sharing you with anyone.”
Harry frowned a little as he bent to inspect his shoes again. They were snakeskin loafers, and Harry felt creepy wearing them, given that he was once a Parseltongue. The ability to communicate with snakes had faded away with Lord V’s demise, and he didn’t miss it, but he still felt squeamish around snakes and their parts. “Have to say, they went a little overboard with the accessorizing. But, I will do it for you.” He stood back up and smiled at Draco. “Is that true love or what?”
?” Draco would have laughed if he wasn’t so distraught. “Since when have you cared about that?” He folded both hands across his chest. “And while we’re on the topic of souls, where was yours when you thought I was guilty of using the Killing Curse? You were awfully quick to believe it, weren’t you? Don’t try to deny it.”
Draco was in a mood for trading stories and laughs, and so he offered to host them at his place instead, disregarding Harry’s elbow to the ribs. “I hope you don’t mind that we will have to travel by taxi.”
“Capitellum Draco Floo,” he spoke hoarsely.
“Draco, I – “
Ron turned scarlet. “Hermione! What did I say to you about bringing up the subject, you know it’s all rubbish cooked up by the press.”
“No, thank you, I’m not drinking right now.”
Harry was still blushing, but with a smile that wouldn’t go away despite his best efforts to suppress it. “You wanted to impress me?”
incantation to himself, and was gratified to see Draco slowly lifting until he was floating over the bed, as if gravity had been temporarily suspended in the room. Gently, oh so gently, Harry pushed him until his back was almost flush against the opposite wall, still levitating half a meter above the baseboard.
“I would say, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with being ordinary. But I don’t want to be.”
, thought Draco.
“That’s the problem with you, Malfoy. You think you have people figured out, but you really don’t know anything about me, at all.”
Brandon seemed nice enough, and by time the beer arrived, in a very tall glass, Harry had convinced himself that he had set his head straight about everything. Who cared if Draco was too much of a selfish git to be open about their developing relationship, and if Harry felt jealous every time he thought of Draco messing around with someone else? He had told Draco that he was all right with keeping things open-ended, after all, and why shouldn’t said open end apply to himself as well, if he wanted?
Draco picked up right away. Judging from his expression, he was worried and more than a little upset. “Harry! I’ve been trying to reach you all evening, what in Merlin’s name are you – “ He caught sight of Harry’s bizarre appearance and changed direction mid-sentence. “Ah fuck me, what have you done to yourself?”
Harry and Hermione turned on him simultaneously, with a similar expression of exasperation. “Draco, if you can’t be serious, maybe you shouldn’t be part of this conversation right now.” Harry’s reproach wiped the smirk off his face, and he busied himself with jellying a crumpet.
Hermione had recovered with the help of a hanky and eagerly jumped back into the conversation. “Oooh, really? What was her reaction, did she mention anything about the latest gossip coming out in the papers?”
Looking back up at Draco, he saw him as close to smiling as he could remember since seeing him drunk in the company of handsome men. The effect was pleasant, if foreign, like seeing an exotic bird execute perfect penmanship. “What, you never heard of Felici-Fizz? My mother loves these, sent me a boatload for my birthday.” He took the bottle out of Harry’s hands and showed him the back of the label. “If you look at the ingredients, you’ll see what makes them special, no liquor involved.”
“I didn’t think you were a coffee drinker,” he commented, after requesting decaf. “Not much of one myself.”
“Er, yeah, actually. Have you read it?”
Draco felt only a little pleased with himself. “What about the shape though, shouldn’t it be turning into an animal form? Or do I need to be under duress for that to happen?”
Harry all but glared at Malfoy. “First of all, could you stop calling me Potter? We’re not in school any more, in case you hadn’t noticed. Besides, it sounds like you’re spitting out my name every time you say it.”
When Harry climbed back down into his living room, turning on lamps as he went, Draco was awake and trying to figure out Harry’s electric teakettle. “How the hell do you make tea with this thing?”
“After the Felici-Fizz, no.” He was only half-joking.
Startled, Harry dropped his next chip on the floor. It had been laden with catsup, and he felt badly for the person who would have to clean it up, but right now his immediate attention was claimed by the stranger who had spoken to him.
They ended the session after Draco had succumbed to the nausea and retched a few times into an empty rubbish bin. She sent him off with a pat on the back and a cool glass of water, and Draco found himself wiping away sweat in the hallway as he left. He hated it when his own body betrayed him, and he longed to put his troubled history with his family behind him. But the time was not ripe, not yet.
“So, Ron.” Hermione was again the first to break the silence. “Don’t you want to hear the story of how they met? Or reunited, I should say.” Ron’s expression changed to one of alarm, but Hermione’s pointed stare goaded him into asking to hear more. Harry was only too happy to oblige, and Draco wondered again how it was that he could stay so cheerful under such awkward circumstances.
The commanding inflection of her voice turned it into a statement instead of a question, and Draco felt his hackles going up. He tilted his chin back far enough to look down his nose at her, which felt slightly ridiculous. “He is Draco Malfoy, what’s it to you?”
“Ta very much. And thanks for making dinner, it looks smashing.”
is hardly the right word. But yeah, I think there’s no way to wiggle out of this one, considering his family connections. I’m sure he’s been dying to ask you more questions about what it’s like to be Harry Potter.”
Numbly, Harry complied, shuffling sideways on his knees while unable to tear his eyes away from the sight of Draco. He looked so vulnerable, so alone, and so
Harry was not prepared for the scene that greeted them when they had spun out of Apparition, and from the expression on Ginny’s face, neither was she. They appeared at the top of the red carpet, closest to the steps leading up to the main entrance, and with a joint “Protego” had flung up shields around themselves before advancing down the carpet toward the street. There were still security guards slumped over willy-nilly, some of whom were being tended to by Mediwizards. A cluster of people had gathered to one side, where a pair of bodies lay prostrate. One of them was wearing blood red robes, and Harry’s heart leapt into his mouth as he broke into a run. Was it – could it be…?
Harry took a deep breath. “In for a penny, in for a pound, I suppose."
The invitation was unmistakable. Even with their last encounter just hours before, Harry could feel the stir of erotic energy awakening within him once more. He wanted to do things that would erase the memory of Nigel and Draco together, and he wanted to do them immediately.
Indeed, nothing did happen over the course of the next couple weeks, besides the usual daily grind of meetings, and introducing new trainees to their studies, and administering exams, and advising some of the older trainees. To them, he was Auror Potter, a trusted authority figure, and not the stuff of legend as the papers made him out to be. As long as he felt like he was being useful, he could live with that.
Harry stood up in turn, horrified by Malfoy’s reaction. “I’m sorry Malfoy – I mean, Draco. There’s been a huge misunderstanding, I only wanted to make amends. Or at least start down the road toward making amends. We’ve been through a lot of shit the past eight years, and I think I’ve had enough of holding grudges. I had hoped you would feel the same.”
Whatever Draco’s opinion was, he chose to keep it to himself. “What’s cooking?” he asked instead, wrinkling up his aristocratic nose a little.
“D’you want to try steering this time, Draco?”
A glowing ball of light shot out of his palm, and Draco jumped in surprise. The light quickly dissolved into mid-air, and Draco turned astonished eyes on Harry, who was smiling.
