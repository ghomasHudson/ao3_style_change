Harry jumps, only to discover that the voice came from Draco, reclining against the wall next to him. Draco laughs at Harry's surprised reaction.
: Very basic wards will simply lock out unauthorised people trying to apparate in. But more advanced ones can give you the magical signature of the person, so you can recognise them and decide to allow them in or not.
Harry scowls.
"Just the occasional adventurous hiker. There's actually a trail not too far from here. But it's not very popular, and people rarely stray from it, thankfully."
"Do not worry Lord Potter. If I wished you harm, I would do so in much more subtle ways. You are, however, wise to be wary of me," she adds with a razor-sharp look.
She bows low to the carpet, and disapparates.
"What's that got to do with Draco?"
Draco bends down, lets his hand travel on Harry's bare hips, brushes his lips against his cheek.
A few people chuckle. Some start talking in low voices, others get up to find another show. There's two people heavily making out in one seat, who will probably want the bed soon. Luna sends him a little wave and continues to draw, unbothered.
"Harry... How long have you known him? Personally."
"I'm helping! I'm figuring out what I'm going to do to these clowns to convince them to leave Harry alone!"
"Sorry. But what did you expect? You summon me to a meeting with her, and
"Oh. Didn't find anything about it in the books you lent me."
the letter?"
"I will be weak," Draco says into the silence, his voice reverberating around the stone of the dungeon.
"Can't wait to be there. But for now, I really have to go."
Harry gives him a pointed look, but Draco volunteers nothing more. Harry turns back toward the foal, mulling over the strange words.
Crap.
Hogwarts elves were uncomfortably subservient, which already weirded him out back then. That’s why he rarely bothered them in the kitchens. But this is next level.
The Prince's magic is touching his. Harry recoils in reflex, but the magic follows him, and... he knows this magic. He knows this magic
"I'm gonna need some time to get used to the idea," Harry admits.
Now it's Harry's turn to raise an eyebrow.
The Prince raises an eyebrow. Harry coughs.
Sirius snorts.
"Then... what is my job, exactly?"
Harry mouths a "oh" that comes out breathy and needy as Draco bites harshly on his Adam apple. He can feel his partner's canines sink in his flesh until they hit the cartilage of his voice box.
"Uh, nothing," Harry answers, wondering if he made a strange face.
"Thank you. Now, what do you all want? And for that matter, how do you know where I live?"
"I'll give you some space..." He hesitates.
Hermione closes down the book she just opened and puts a gentle hand on Harry's arm.
Ron sighs in relief.
"I don't get it. What's that about you being qualified for this 'monitoring his magic' stuff?" Ron asks.
"Letting the magic of the wards pass through you, then restoring your own magic," Harry completes.
"Good job on recognising your feelings. Do you want to keep the other thing you're thinking about to yourself, or do you need a little time to organise your thoughts?"
"That's what he said to you? That he's in love with you?" Sirius asks, frowning.
Harry sighs.
"Let's get inside and I'll brew us some tea," Remus suggests instead.
"Didn't you say you wanted to be in the woods?"
Draco gives him one amused glance before reporting his attention to his work.
Harry's heart beats faster as he approaches the pensieve, apprehension biting at his toes. The basin is filled with darkness, revealing nothing about the memory it contains.
"Directly with children?" Harry snickers.
Harry gulps, and enters.
, but all of the rest of him is definitely Kitten.
"Good. That's good. You did a very good job. You've earned a reward."
: No no that's fine. That's totally fine.
"If you don't keep it down you're going to wake my dragons," Harry lies. "And even I won't be able to restrain all of them if they decide to eat you as breakfast for rudely waking them up."
"You said it yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, especially when they're young and inexperienced. It's no fault of your own."
"Yeah," Harry agrees with a little laugh.
"You think it's a good time to shag?"
Draco looks at him with a complicated expression.
Harry is speechless. What? What is happening? The Hogwarts elves never did that!
Which sounds wonderful.
He uncorks one. A high-pitched yell immediately fills the room.
"And the wixes here, the... the people you serve. Are they nice to you?"
"It's not that much," he mumbles into Harry's belly.
For an instant, there's silence. Then Sirius starts talking brusquely.
"I'm what now?"
: I was wondering if I could come over to your place.
A pulse. Harry hopes his sharp inhale doesn't count as sound. He expected pulsating vibrations. They're horribly effective at making him melt. He can't help rolling his hips into it.
Draco grins.
"And the other elves? They're happy too?"
"Just what he said," Harry answers, starting to get annoyed. "We've been seeing each other for a while."
"Still here? Don't you have anything better to do?"
There's nothing else to do beside opening the door, right?
"Harry... It is true neither Sirius or I know him personally. But what Sirius said earlier is also true. He does come from a family which has a history of not being the most honest or trustworthy. And doesn't have the most progressive of views..."
Her wand glows red and Remus is catapulted against the far wall, right next to Sirius. The yell and the sound of breaking bones make Harry cry out and try to run toward past-Remus, to protect him, heal him. But present-Remus's arm keeps him here.
She frowns.
"Mate, long time no see!" Neville greets happily.
Ron stays confused for an instant. Then the meaning of the sentence dawns on him. He appears torn between curiosity and repulsion. Harry rolls his eyes at him.
He can feel a phantom
There's a soft hand touching Harry's knee. He opens his eyes to find Draco sitting criss-crossed in front of him, mirroring his position, a gentle look of worry in his eyes.
Remus bites his lip.
"Thank you, your..." Majesty? Highness? He has no idea what is the correct term. He decides on "Highness" and prays he hasn't offended her already.
Harry can feel the tension melting in Kitty's shoulders. All the stress of whatever is happening in his life right now, swept away by Harry's praise.
: Why do you own an instant owl parchment if you don't use it?
"A while?" Harry asks, fearing the worst.
. And he learned so much more about him in just a week! So much he didn't know before...
"Lord Potter sir?" the elf asks, looking worried.
Harry is left scratching his head. He didn't learn much from the encounter. Know people by how they treat their inferiors... Ignoring them doesn't seem like the best treatment. And the spontaneous self-harm is quite alarming. But he doesn't have any frame of reference here. He has never had a servant. None of his friends have any as far as he knows. He didn't interact much with the Hogwarts elves... which is exactly the situation Mendy described, now that he thinks about it. No interaction.
"You're so needy."
So, so good.
"He did reveal he's the Prince. Soon he's going to talk you into politics."
“Gloating much, mister star student?”
“Sorry for being an idiot.”
Her wand glows and Sirius puts up a shield charm before she even has time to cast. She lashes out on his shield instead, and seeing that she's getting nowhere, she starts destroying the furniture left and right.
"Hey, I'm just saying! It's not like he would starve without a job. I never let any job take me away from Moony!"
How can someone be so horrible toward their child? Harry has no concept of it. He grew up surrounded by love. His friends have great families too, so great they make him jealous.
"Hum. Hi," the Prince says, strangely awkward.
Monitor his magic...? Harry's eyes widen in understanding. This sounds a bit like what they do in bed, right? Magic play. Is this why the Prince thought of him for this job?
"Harry... There's something..."
, even though you already accepted to do it. Some dumb regulation on Ministry jobs. I received a dozen applications or so. So if I just needed a body to sacrifice to the Dark Gods I wouldn't need to spend two years roping someone into it. I just need to offer a little bit of money," Draco completes with an eyeroll.
"Sorry, I've made this evening all about myself," Kitten apologizes while mixing milk in his tea.
"Not the sofa, you wanker. Just... being able to talk. I mean... "
He wonders what's being so stressful at work. Kitten never told him exactly what his job is. Only that he can't talk about it and that there's a lot of pressure on him. Harry is pretty sure he's an Unspeakable, which would explain all the secrecy. Kitten never revealed his name either, hence the nickname. And Harry knows he's hiding his face under a glamour.
Draco raises his hands in a placating gesture.
"They're leading us back to where the rest of the herd is," Harry explains for Draco's benefit.
Silence. Sirius still looks... lost. Not angry.
Kitten puts a hand around Harry's throat, caressing the skin here.
"So what was I supposed to do? I thought inviting you to an audience at the Palace would be convincing."
Draco chuckles at the quip being thrown back at him.
"This was a wonderful evening as always, but if I don't feed the 'griffs soon Buckbeak might take a bite out of me in retaliation."
"Seriously Sirius, are you freaking out about me seeing someone?" Harry groans.
"Didn't know talking could be so tiring," he mutters to himself.
Harry scratches his stubble, thinking.
"Quite convinced. Believe me, if this potion wasn't so time sensitive I would be ripping off your clothes right now."
"Gods no."
"You don't need to understand everything," the Prince says as he drops book after book in a holding bag. "Like I said, I'm in charge of completing the ritual. But it's best if you know the general outline of the process."
"Mother, please."
Harry catches the metal plug Draco drops in his hand, and complies.
"Samhain is coming up," Kitten says in a lull of the conversation, seemingly a propos of nothing.
"I'm afraid I don't follow."
"I recognise little Draco here."
"Yes. Please."
Harry discards the bag and rearranges them. He puts Kitten in his lap, legs spread to display his dick toward their audience. Some people lean forward in their seats to get a better view. Kitten closes his eyes, arousal and shame beating in his heart, and Harry feels all of it. How excited it makes Kitten feel, to have all these eyes on him when he's at his most vulnerable, legs forcefully spread and so close to coming. How aroused he is, to know Harry can feel it, to know that Harry knows, that he can’t hide how much the situation is exciting to him.
The two ensembles are radically different from each other.
Harry shrugs.
"Very much a sap. Stress at work?" Harry guesses.
So he bites on his knuckles and does his best to not moan to the skies as Draco's magic pushes on all his buttons.
"Blimey." Ron blanches. "That's crazy."
Ultimately, there's little in the books regarding the proceedings of the ceremony itself. The Prince said they would come to that later. But they learn quite a few things about the history of the protections placed on Great Britain by Merlin and subsequently maintained and altered by the generations. They learn how the magic from the land itself, as well as its inhabitants, is harvested through the ancient rituals and directed to protect all against harm. In the end, Harry is left with the impression that he knows less than when they started.
"I was only happy after she banished me from the palace," Sirius continues with a bit more energy in his voice. "But now, they're coming back. Not after me, but after you. What if it's a way to hurt us?"
: Apparently not.
"So, flushing your pipes?"
Mendy flaps her ears with an intrigued expression.
gets his curiosity firing. Sirius never talked about his family.
"Oh, Neville is in the kitchen with Ron. He stopped for a cuppa earlier."
"Uh-uh..."
"Perfect."
The Prince makes a long, suffering sigh.
"We like what time we can make together," Harry says defensively.
"... What? You've been shitting on stuck-up pureblood noble families your whole life... and you were from one, the whole time?” Harry is stunned. “Wait, that means you're pureblood too?!"
They make their way back to the shack, hand in hand, and fuck tenderly on Harry's bed over the soundtrack of Draco complaining about the quality of said bed. After that, they get dressed in fluffy bathrobes and Harry starts making spiced pumpkin juice on the stove. Just as the delicious smell starts permeating the room they hear a cracking sound from outside, followed by an enthusiastic knock on the door. Their visitors immediately open the door without waiting for an invitation, which tells Harry the exact identity of said visitors.
"What?"
"Have you been sleeping well?" Remus asks, worried.
"Draco's mother. The current Queen. She's nothing like that," Harry tries.
"I'm a bit busy with my job," he settles for.
"You said you were sorry, Lord Potter Sir."
After a short deliberation, Harry decides to keep this realisation about his feelings under wraps.
The situation does not get better in the following days.
"I'll help you too! Of course!" Ron adds quickly. "Can't honestly say I'll be happy about it though." He looks at the pile of books like it's about to come to life and eat him whole.
Lady Zabini lifts a perfectly penciled eyebrow in an amused expression.
talked about it. I'm curious to know what
"Yeah. That's the one."
Draco chuckles.
"How may Mendy assist Lord Potter Sir?"
They talk about the minutiae of the ceremony for hours. Lady Zabini seems pleasantly surprised when Harry displays his knowledge about how to handle someone else's magic. She probes him for how he learned with such intensity that Harry almost blurts out the whole truth. He ends up vaguely saying that it has something to do with "personal activities". Something in her eyes makes him think that she knows
But before Sirius can reach the bed and make them disapparate, the double-door of the room slams open and harsh light pours in. Framed by the light stands a very big figure, tall and large, wearing a dress making her even larger.
He peeked through his fingers.
“What’s wrong?” Ron asked, seeing his defeated expression.
“Didn’ work,” he mumbled incoherently to his shoes, swaying on the spot.
“Behave yourself.”
Blaise shrugged languidly. He was very rarely affected by alcohol; the only way anyone would know he had drunk anything at all was by the glitter in his eyes, which were a little glossier than usual.
“Well, it’s very—”
He thanked Salazar his robes were thick enough to hide the wilting semi he was sporting.
Harry heard the seam of Malfoy’s lips part, a strangely intimate sound in the empty space, and he looked up.
“Nobody touches—”
“Oh yes,” Hermione said, sweeping a critical eye over the plum shirt. Harry had pushed the sleeves up, left a couple of buttons undone, and he was wearing his tightest black Muggle skinny jeans.
“Just because I did that thing with the pretty Quidditch player that one time…” she mumbled.
Harry did not need to turn around to see the smirk tugging at Ginny’s lips.
How dare this brat?
Because he was just that fatally romantic.
Panic and hurt started to churn in Harry’s stomach, a cold tossing weight of unpleasantness. He didn’t know what to say.
He heard Malfoy snort from below, and it fuelled his cockiness; with a rashness that he hadn’t felt in, far, far too long,  he grinned at the ceiling and spoke, his voice lazy.
, he thought.
“Yes, please,” Pansy said clearly. “Can I have a vodka martini, stirred clockwise for three seconds with an olive? Actually, make that two olives. Draco?”
While the textbooks were being handed out, Potter sneezed.
Draco interrupted her, holding up a hand. “You did this in secret? I’m assuming your parents are also unaware?”
Muggle Studies.
Harry didn’t want that.
Harry slid further down in his chair.
“What’s up?”
“You do?”
He spun to mirror Potter’s pose, leaning back languidly against the stone wall and letting his head rest back, eyes sliding half- lidded as though his mind weren’t racing a million miles a minute.
If he were Malfoy he’d turn around and walk out there and then.
Draco was startled back to reality by Pansy, looking at him strangely. He felt her eyes on him, gaze uncommonly soft and femininely discerning.
“Shut
******************************************************************************************************************************************************
“—treat me this way! ‘S fucking unbelievable. We’re on a
“Ah!” She yelped, voice quavery from shock. Draco leaped away from the knot of limbs that was Pansy and Blaise, raking a hand through his hair and stifling a wince.
“Iwenht’meesmonefrmWishWeekli!” Pansy gabbled in one nervous, incomprehensible breath. She paused, and looked at them anxiously for a reaction.
Zabini’s lip curled, and something of the glacial, savage- eyed boy Draco had been faced with for the past term returned. “No need to sound quite so jealous, Malfoy. At least we can look each other in the eye. You and Potter can barely sit next to each other without coming in your pants or storming out. It’s pretty pathetic, actually.”
She broke in, looking distraught. “I know, I
, and Draco had never cared about Potter feeling sad before.
Nott sucked in a deep breath, and it caught in his throat. His eyes welled up even more.
“Yes, thank you,” Pansy said. “We’ll order in maybe ten minutes?”
Draco stalled, still shifting irresolutely on his feet.
“I just… after it being the three of us for so long, isolated from everyone, I think I got used to that. Not… in a weird way. Just. They did too. I couldn’t break the habit, and to be honest we didn’t need to. The Burrow’s got a lot of rooms, for all it’s not massive.” He shrugged. “We like it.”
“He’s a good boy,” Blaise said again, and nudged Draco.
“Godric, Malfoy,” Potter said in his ear, and that was enough to make him tense all over, the hum spreading over the nape of his neck, which was exposed and vulnerable. He could feel Potter’ warm breath, and he wanted to spin around and kiss him hard enough to bruise, run his hands all over him, bury his fingers in the dark hair he could feel tickling his ear. His arms were held tightly, so fucking tightly, and he wanted to writhe a bit, test the limits.
“It was in the Prophet four days ago. The guy who spilled on… on my mum, and the others. He came out with a whole article about how it was him. He wanted money from the Ministry, or something stupid. I... thought you knew.” He had the grace to look at his dark shoes, brown eyes just shy of sheepish.
With an insolent pause, Draco turned slowly to face the classroom, eyes moving over it. He didn’t get it.
It was hotter than it sounded. With a possessive flash that saw him pressing his cock forward into Malfoy’s own and grinding, he swore nobody else would ever hear it again. Malfoy’s breath shivered out in a gasp, and he laughed, the vibrations going straight to Harry’s cock.
Potter blinked. “Blaise?” His eyes peeked open, and he smiled briefly at Blaise, before his gaze slid – agonisingly drowsily – over to Draco. Immediately, a stream of emotions flashed over his face, too quickly for Draco to identify any of them. His eyebrows drew together finally, and when he spoke his voice was adorably bewildered.
Potter half- turned his head, looking rather like a rabbit hoping a car would come and run it over.
Theo glared at him emotionally, looking strung out, and Draco could feel the superficiality of his grip – it was barely even there; his speed was the factor that had sent the both of them hurtling into the wall. Theo’s wrists, pinning him down, were delicate and trembling, not bruising him or even pinching at him. But the things that arrested Draco were Nott’s eyes. Mossy green and brown- lashed, they were wet and shining with a thick sheen of tears. Draco froze, utterly confounded and past his wits end with the madness of the day.
He took his time pulling on his robes, ensuring his tie was immaculate and collar spotlessly folded, all the while sipping leisurely from his bedside goblet of water. But his hand, when he reached up to flick back his hair, was shaky.
Malfoy’s eyelids slid half- shut; he gazed at Harry with a frightening mixture of awe and tenderness. After a long pause, he bit his lip, bringing his hands back to lace behind his head and tipping his gaze back. His hips leaned back against the counter, erection pressing forwards, and his voice was deep and lazy as he spoke.
“Pansy…”
Draco cocked his head. “Okay,” he replied bemusedly.
Because, yeah, Draco may have gotten drunk off Firewhisky one night and confessed in their small kitchen-- with a few silent tears, but nobody needed to know; it had been dark-- to fantasising rather dirtily about Potter throughout their entire Hogwarts career.
Draco’s mouth hung open. “No… I never really followed her career, but I heard some… I mean,” he passed a hand over his forehead. “Now I’m thinking of it… I remember hearing stuff about the English International team. Salazar, Pans, I know you said the girl you liked was a Quidditch player, but…” he exhaled, feeling out of his depth. “The
“They’re
Draco took a sip of his gin and tonic, smacking his lips from the burn.
“So,” Ron said. “What’s her name?”
Draco swallowed, and it was already to late to acknowledge it. He just hoped he could pull off the suave walk- away, no- looking- back kind of thing.
Draco yelped, eyes flying open as Potter stumbled back looking shellshocked, drawing the back of his hand across his mouth in a slow, obscene drag.
Draco was aghast. “Harry Potter? Delicate?”
But that was the issue.
He was interrupted in his musings for a second time as the boys made their way to their desks- front row like Draco, Longbottom on the far right, Potter in the middle- and Flitwick gestured to their textbooks. They both flipped the Advanced Charms Guide, Grade Seven open to the introduction and began to read, Longbottom fearfully slowly, and Potter with an alert, easy speed that took Draco by surprise. It then dawned on him that perhaps he should not have been watching Longbottom and Potter read- he shook himself, and turned back to his book, feeling the cool waft of air from the window to his left drift over his cheek. In the airy, warm- ish Charms classroom that sat in a little pocket just overlooking a lovely stretch of the Hogwarts grounds, Draco lost himself in the simplicity of black and white print, his wand sitting comfortably in his robes’ right inside pocket. A grounding weight. A reminder that he was safe, that he could relax, and he could learn and just… be.
“Weasley?” he said, eyes raking their cluttered bench.
, I’m- feels so good, baby, oh fuck, fucking,
“Alright,” he said. “But you first.”
Harry raked a hand through his already rumpled hair. “Hermione,” he said, closing his eyes. “Please, please help me. I’m leaving in twenty minutes.”
Would it always be like this? Potter filling up every cranny of his mind, arousing him and maddening him, utterly unreachable… forever?
Blaise was anyone’s dream, and as a boy who had figured out he was gay fairly early in life, Draco had always accepted that he was objectively attractive. At Hogwarts they’d messed around a bit, but it had never meant anything. Partly because Blaise had been completely in denial about his sexuality- which Draco had never been annoyed about, but it was still a surefire way to limit a relationship- and partly because Draco had been just a trifle preoccupied by one green- eyed Saviour. They’d helped each other out as friends, but that was what they were, first and foremost. Friends.
Potter, Potter, Potter.
“You?” he returned the question casually, expecting a careless ‘no’, in return, since Ginny usually talked about her dates freely and without any probing necessary. If she were seeing someone, he would have expected to have heard about it by now.
Potter straightened his white shirt, rumpled as it was, and a stray tendril of hair like ebony silk brushed the cotton collar, curling above it. The bare skin of his neck, pulse unblemished and creamy, was so vulnerable that Draco looked away, at Finnigan, which also turned out to be a mistake, as the stupid bloody Irishman was looking at Potter with this endeared little smile on his face, and Draco could feel his blood-- free of alcohol and renewed in vigour-- rush to his head. He clenched his jaw, looked back at Potter, staring him straight in the eye.
Draco heard a faint sound like a deflated balloon coming from the desk to Potter’s right.
The other boy flushed, pinkish colour spreading down his neck and disappearing under his jumper. It was a very noticeable tinge on his lily- white skin, and Draco raised his eyebrows.
“Don’t be vulgar, Blasius,” Pansy said primly.
To be more specific,
And McGonagall was not even finished.
“Fine, fine, fine!” Harry clapped his hands over his face. “Just, Godric, will ether of you be of any help? What shirt should I wear?”
The gargoyle rumbled, stone groaning as it slid to the side, rotating to reveal a staircase. Both boys ascended as the gargoyle started to groan once more, spinning slowly to propel them up the stairwell, and depositing them gently at the entrance to McGonagall’s office.
He flushed hard, wanted to look at Potter again, but they were turning, and all he caught was a glimpse of Potter smiling after them, looking as though he’d found something unexpectedly pleasant.
“Why not? Why NOT?!” Ron interrupted, and now his lashes were wet as well, both pairs of brown Weasley eyes thick with unshed tears.
“But I have always thought that perhaps it is easier for Gryffindor and Slytherin to be so,” She continued. “At odds. After all, people such as the both of you as
“Stop sulking,” Draco gritted, irritation filing his voice sharp. “And help me find the Kneazle saliva, would you?”
McGonagall, as though sensing his thoughts, thinned her mouth slightly and carried on. “It does not help, of course, that oftentimes they have been two of the strongest contenders for honours such as the Quidditch Cup. Two houses with opposite values, equally as fierce in their convictions… you can imagine, I have not had much success getting them – you – to see eye to eye.”
Relief flooded through Draco’s veins. He clapped a hand over his mouth too late; a shout of laughter escaped him, echoing over the worried murmurs of students. The boy couldn’t get up- he couldn’t stand at all. A long, muscular tail stretched down from his torso instead of legs, scales iridescent in the dinner candlelight. A bony hand came down upon Draco’s shoulder- he looked up to see Professor McGonagall standing behind him. He opened his mouth to defend himself, but she held up a hand to silence him.
“Right about what?”
“-Scorpius’ His Dad cut him off, which was unusual ‘Go to the Potter’s now. Tell Harry Lucius has been released and The Promise he’ll understand go Now!” His Dad pushed him into the Floo and sent him to the Potter’s before he could question it.

“Longbottom.’ he nods. ‘Is there something you need?”
“Harry, you need to tell people things. Bottling it up doesn't help!” Sirius said loudly.

“Thank you mother.’ He smiled. ‘I’ll see if I can go to Gringotts today and get the specific numbers. When I come home next week I’ll let you check.”

He sends another one to moaning Myrtle's bathroom and tells them to ask her where she is buried and then collect a piece of her hair.
‘And Regulus, he hated me for a long time, absolutely despised me. He thought Sirius was replacing him with me. Saw me as Sirius’ idiot friend. When we first got together it was purely physical’ Harry wrinkled his nose.
“Yes.” Harry said clearly.
He had started at the bottom of the list and four days in he had completed Dean, Luna, Ollivander, his fathers and his mother's letter. He had floo-called Nydia again to ask if she would read the letters, but she said the letters were between him and the recipient and they shouldn't be shared until he was ready to share them with everybody, knowing he wasn't ready for that he let Nydia go. He had sent his father's letter to Azkaban knowing it would be read by the guards, and also sent Dean, Luna, and Ollivanders out. He gave his mother her letter at dinner time the day he finished, then retreated to his room not wanting to be there when she read it. After dinner that night he wrote Nevilles letter and addressed it to be sent after his owl got a full night's rest and a good breakfast. The next morning he pulled out three pieces of parchment and addressed them
“That is correct, Minister I wish to speak with her today”.
A few minutes later the gates fade into the air. He walks up and knocks on the door to Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy opens it a minute later.
“You donated Minerva Manor anonymously. But I know you wonder how it's doing beyond what the papers say. So I talked to the head of the orphanage. I made sure it was clear I didn't donate it but I told them the person who did wondered. The other board is in their office so you can ask about it while remaining anonymous.”
“What Potter?”
“Agreed. That sucked.” Tonks added.
Harry asks more questions. Draco deflects but now Harry’s aware, now he’s not unknowingly satisfied with it. Draco begins to wonder if he should tell Harry. Just Harry. He gets the choice taken away from him two weeks later. He gets an Owl from Harry asking him to come over. Both Reluctant to go and to say no to Harry he goes. All five adults are there and Harry sits on the couch with a frown.
Despite working with their bosses sometimes when Tonks and Remus had Teddy they still had to do some work. Remus had Teddy this week, he was also taking 3rd through 5th years on a field trip. His History of Magic class was by far the most active ever. Because of said field trip Harry was doing Godfather duties. He was watching Teddy in his dorm. They had put protective spells around Malfoy’s stuff and Teddy was using Harry’s wand. Malfoy walked in to a face full of pillow feathers from Harry's new exploded pillow.
“Scorpius!’ She smiles. ‘Everything Okay?”
Lily glared while trying to keep her lips from turning up.
Of course this was when Seamus interrupted with "The corridor that we were told would kill us painfully during first year?"
He walked into her office and saw that it was clean and precise with what looked like children toys lined up against the wall on shelves. Along with two couches, an arm chair and a desk with a muggle computer setup.
“Can-’ Harry pauses. ‘Can I meet your family now? Now that I know.”
“Yes, but he’s also Scor and Jamie’s little brother too.” Harry said, looking at the boys behind her.

“Would you like the honest answer?”
Harry quickly kneels in front of him. He grabs Draco’s teary face in his hands. “Hey, Hey, Breathe. They won't. They wont hurt them. But you need to tell us what is going on. Please.” One look into Harry's pleading eyes and he breaks.
She looks apologetic.
And Draco’s morning rush over the previous day’s events crashed. Hard. He continued reading before a hand came into his eyesight.
Harry said it was too late he overpowered Draco weeks ago, took his wand from him. Harry whispered in the quiet of the great hall “So it all comes down to this doesn't it? Does the Wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed? Because if it does... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”

Andy, Ted, Tonks and Teddy would also stay the morning with them. Teddy would go with them to the Weasleys but Tonks had a half shift in the afternoon.

Everyone in this room has already died for this war, no one would blame you if you decided to leave now. However the dark lord would be quite shocked to see you all and I'm sure those fighting today could use a momentum shift."
“Harry, I swear I will kill your best friend.” Draco told him seriously.
Draco could feel his rage grow second by second. He bit out “Fine.”
“I don't know, He didn't even insult me once.” Harry pouted.
---------
“You do?”
They went with their children to Hogwarts as a new tradition set up by McGonagall where the survivors of the war that could make it got recognized every year before the sorting of the first years.
“And you're part of that family so you will probably love them both forever even if you don't forgive them for everything. That's okay.” Harry finished for him then kissing him slowly.
The forest of Dean would have been a wide open space and it  would have thinned out. If it caused issues in the forest the ministry would have cleansed it. Same with the forbidden forest.
“I understand many of you may not know what I am here to testify to considering everyone that was there is now on trial or running. When I gave myself up to Voldemort he cursed me with Avada Kedavra and injured me. When I came back to consciousness Mrs. Malfoy was the one they sent to confirm I was dead. She knew i was alive and proceeded to tell Voldemort that it had worked and I was dead leading to me being able to fake it till we returned to Hogwarts and I could kill him."
When I look at these I'm so happy. I'm happy that he only had so long with you so he couldn't drag it out, okay these scars almost killed me but they saved you and they didn't kill me Severus kept his promise to my mother and his duty as my godfather and saved me. They also remind me that no matter what you can kill me before I can hurt you and I needed to know that sometimes. These are the only scars I'm happy to have because they tell me that I can care more than my father and I have consciousness and that I'm human. Harry, you remind me that I can, so don't ever feel guilty for these okay?” Draco finished with tears down his face and leaned his forehead against Harry's feeling the boy's breath on his lips.
"Thank you Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Haldir please come join the first years."
Harry looks at Hermione and she answers his silent question. “It's called Polyamary. It's referred to as a V in the muggle world.”
“It’s already an emotional conversation. If you say the wrong thing something tells me he’ll tell you. Very loudly tell you.”
“Will you read me what your opinions are now that you've had time to develop them?”
“Yeah, maybe he just needs some space to process it. On the bright side he hasn't rejected you.” Remus added.
“Everything. I guess. I have to go before Lucius finds out about the boys.” He nods toward where Al is comforting Scorpius. Harry jumps in the floo and goes straight to his office. He walks out the door to his secretary.
“I want to use Bellatrix Lestrange Vault to give restitution to the people she hurt the most. I want to use her Black Vault to give to Hermione Granger for when she graduates and starts her campaigns. I don't know what she’ll do yet, but I know it will be about social change and people getting the rights they deserve. I would use the Collective Malfoy Vault to buy the Manor.”
“Really Really.” Draco answered her.
"Okay. So is this going to be like 6th year again with you trying to secretly follow me everywhere or are you guys just going to watch me everytime we're in the same room?"
“Thank you. My mother was reinherited and I'm sure you heard Teddy was made an heir too.”
“I CAN'T UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY! I'M THE REASON YOU DIED! I GOT YOU KILLED!” Harry yelled with tears in his eyes. Everyone had stopped eating breakfast a while ago. (Besides Regulus, he was far too used to yelling at breakfast.) James went to intervene earlier but Lily and Remus stopped him.
"Oh darling are you trying to convince me or yourself?"
“No, I just wanted to return the money to its rightful Owners and Heirs.”
“You first.”
“I want to be an Auror someday. I don't think I want to go back to fighting all the time right now.” Ron said.
“I think that we’ve done enough today right? I have to get ready to go back to school tomorrow. May I go now?” Draco said effectively shutting down anything about his father.
“I think you would be surprised at one's openness after getting free from a maniac and Family expectations.”
The room had cleared the smoke besides the smolerding piles so they could breathe easy.
The trio reacted when the rest of the boys ran toward Chip locking them up on the wall while letting Chip beat the teenager till Hermione went and pulled him off and told him “Chip STOP if you beat him up then you're no better than him, as much as I would like to let you continue we have to take him to McGonagall and let her deal with it okay?”she said while glaring at the david teenager.
Draco barely resisted rolling his eyes. “It was my choice, Potter. My choice: My consequences. And contrary to your belief the war was not all about you. The Dark Lord wanted to rule over muggles, and wanted Muggle-borns to be slaves. You were just an obstacle to him. An annoying, persistent, powerful obstacle but an obstacle nonetheless. His life goal was not your death, it was world domination.”
Harry and Draco introduced the baby at the next large family gathering with all their families there.
---------
“Regulus.’ She handed Teddy to Remus with a smile. ‘I’m considering getting color in my hair just to add another difference.” She sat down by Sirius.
“I’ll help your Mother. Where are you going?”
Remus and Sirius met at the new date place in Hogsmeade. It was a little less explosive than Madam Puddifoot's. Mostly it was the more committed couples who went there for a nice dinner, along with the Hogwarts staff.
“I did. I was also reinherited. Although Regulus had to approve it since it was our parents' Vaults. I can't help but wonder why though.”
MANOR DONATED TO MINISTRY TO BE ORPHANAGE, SAFE HOUSE FOR MAGICAL KIDS IN ABUSIVE OR OPPRESSIVE HOMES, AND TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR THOSE DISPLACED BY WAR.
“Someone please tell me I'm more subtle than that.” James pleaded.
Bellatrix is fighting Hermione, Ginny, and Luna Bellatrix shot a killing curse so close to Ginny she missed death by an inch. Harry goes to fight Bellatrix instead until he's pushed aside by Molly Weasley screaming “NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH.”
“Of course.” Regulus smiled at him and went back to his desk.
“Remus John Lupin, We have survived two wars together. I have loved you since I was 16-
Harry hunched lower in his seat, jeans uncomfortably tight. His waistband was cutting into his stomach, puffed out from all the food he’d eaten. The embarrassment of being ditched was churning nauseatingly in his stomach, along with a salty soup- like dish he’d had earlier. That bastard had left him with the bill.
“You can see more than that,” Ron averred, eyes still fixed on the apex of Harry’s legs.
Ginny swallowed a mouthful of oaty sludge, shuddering silently and wiping a tear from under her left eye when Hermione wasn’t looking. “Well, there’s a massive crowd of fans outside the block. Normally they’re more manageable, but now the Cup final’s coming up,” she shook her head. “Mental.”
Zabini gave him a faux- wounded look, and it was shockingly comfortable, the two of them. “Well, be that as it may, he’d faced a lot worse, and he sussed out that I was cagey about anyone in the wizarding world finding out. So after the third session, he approached me, and we talked, and he reassured me he wouldn’t tell anyone unless I wanted them to know. And we sort of… got close, after that. Met up a lot, talked a lot. But when I got better, more secure in the new world and at dealing with shit at home… Harry had difficulty. He’s been okay so far this year, but at the beginning of this week I knew he’d had a bad relapse when I couldn’t find him anywhere. I found out from Dean Thomas he was in here.”
**********************************************************************************
If pressed, he wouldn’t deny that this wasn’t completely horrible.
“No! Remember that time at Theo Nott’s party last year when I drank a shit ton of vodka and was fine?”
The man blinked. “Of course, sir. They’re just over there—” he gestured to somewhere behind the bar, and Harry felt faintly sick. He’d have to navigate the tables, and go through the staff door, and not make a fool of himself, and he’d definitely trip and fall or what if someone told him he wasn’t allowed and he’d have to explain—
“That will be why, then.” Anybody else would have laughed awkwardly, but Malfoy just stared out of the window, grey eyes intense.
He sped past the others, landing quickly and nearly stumbling, but catching himself before the lot of them could snigger. Draco took his broom in hand and jogged to the changing rooms, opening the door with forced restraint, and trying not to rip his clothes off until the team had dispersed from the usual traffic jam at the doorway.
Pansy slid three large, embossed tickets out of her pocket and fanned herself with them nonchalantly, mouth twisted up in a wry smile.
“My eyes are up here?” Malfoy finished for him. The faintly sarcastic edge of his voice was enough to make Harry’s flush redouble its efforts.
He shook his head, blushing and furious with himself, trying to focus on Blighty and Smythe and the undeniable quality of their respective arses, striding into the shower area without a second glance at the benches.
Blaise dimpled and his tongue played in the corner of his mouth arrogantly, peacocking. Draco felt a thousand times lighter, suddenly, just witnessing them be happy together.
a tiny voice said in the back of his mind.
“Let’s le—we should leave. Come on, let’s go!” Draco declared, making a violent, aborted move to get up before Blaise grabbed his wrist.
“Only when I’m in a hurry,” Draco snapped, and immediately regretted it. Potter’s mouth curled into a tiny smirk. Draco’s heart convulsed; he mentally gave it a shake and told it to behave.
Hot brown eyes flashed fire at him. “Let’s be clear, Malfoy, we are not friends. I am telling you this because I’m worried about Potter staying this long in the hospital wing, and I know you obsess over him enough to care.”
The hot water ran in rivulets down Draco’s face, running into his eyes, soaking his hair and his emerald Quidditch undershorts. He opened his mouth in enjoyment, the way it was natural for him to do in the shower, tilting his head back and letting the water pool on his tongue and in the hollows of his throat. His muscles relaxed under the soapy onslaught, exhausted from two hours of gripping his broom tightly, steering and diving and flying against the cruel October wind. The material of his Slytherin shorts moulded to his legs, drenched a dark, wet green, silver piping glinting dully. As he ran his hands through his hair, he hummed a tune over and over.
“Okay. Okay. ‘M sorry.”
So, I'm posting this maybe an hour before I go back to school for the first time in months? And to be honest, I don't know what my posting schedule's gonna be like from here on out. But I'm gonna finish this, promise. Please tell me what you guys thought, liked or didn't like! Reading your comments is probably my favourite earthly thing.
“Well, I don’t know…” Potter’s brow furrowed, as he stroked his chin in mock- thought. “You were the one speeding through the corridors at breakneck speed.”
“Hendricks is perfect,” Draco said with a nod. “And could I have that with some ice?”
He looked up, hands sweeping the desk for the vial of thick, syrupy saliva.
“—I think I’m going to puke.” Ron finished defiantly.
“Well, it could have been an accident… a sparking of magic in a particular moment of emotion or…” Professor Flitwick trailed off, sounding dubious. Draco appreciated his attempt at ignorance. It was obvious; someone had cursed the ex- Death Eater in the hopes he’d bloody well drop dead or at the very least fuck off back to his London flat. Draco was unsurprised. Actually, it was a wonder he didn’t get more of this.
“Then again, I don’t think he’d be very obliging. You see, I reckon he has a bit of a crush on me.” He lowered his voice to a whisper, feeling the corners of his mouth tug up in a smile. “Don’t tell anybody, though. I think it’s quite sweet.”
.” He didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it tore out of his throat anyway, a serrated blade dragging over the swirling, glimmering surface of his thoughts, dulling them, sharpening them with pain.
Zabini’s mouth dropped open. “You’re seriously telling me that
“Fine!” He said nervously. “Just go on.”He pressed his lips so tightly together Harry feared they might be severed from his face altogether.
“Draco Malfoy, Blaise and I are sick of watching you brush off date after date, guy after guy, just because you had a crush on Potter in school! No—” she held up a hand to stem his protest. “You don’t have to admit it. But we both know it’s true. You’ve never moved on from him! You hated him and wanted to snog the shit out of him so much that you thought about him all the fucking time. He became like a living fantasy to you, and nobody else can ever compete! So go out there, shag Potter, and when you come back we need you to realise that he’s
********************************************************************************************************************************
His first thought tumbled, choked off, out of his mouth before he’d even had the chance to fully form it.
Pansy looked abashed. “I went to meet someone from Witch Weekly.”
Draco sighed. “No! Hit the Bludger at them! Make them scatter! Disrupt their arrangement!” His voice hoarsened every time he went to shout again, and the team were quickly becoming as unresponsive as annoyed Hippogriffs.
“Malfoy, would you please relax? She won’t be angry. Honestly.” He turned to Draco, and he looked so earnest and lovely, hair soft over his eyes and forehead, that Draco’s heart cracked open in his chest. He smiled tightly.
“Ron!” Hermione admonished.
“Mayfair!”
Ginny gave an indistinct groan.
“I wasn’t the one who didn’t check around the corner.”
It was a lot, especially with Pansy’s nipples pressing up conspicuously against the fabric of her boy’s school shirt.
Had Potter in fact been...
,” the bird spilled into his ear. “
“Quiet, everyone!” the Headmistress said sharply. “There is no need for uproar. Now, Mr Warren,” the boy gulped on the floor, mouth opening and closing like a landed fish, “are you alright?”
Now for Harry’s part.
Potter nodded enthusiastically. “And, you know, I was the one who brought you in here. You can always blame me, yeah? I don’t mind.”
“Shut up.”
Draco was nonplussed. “What-- your name? If I’ve been saying it wrong for nine years, though I don’t see how there could possibly be another way of saying Pansy- I mean… it’s a flower, so that’s kind of, well, anyway- you should’ve said someth—”
,” Harry thought glumly. “
“Fine,” Draco croaked, and immediately cringed at the vulnerability in his voice. He cleared his throat, glancing at Zabini out of the corner of his eye. “I mean, great, yeah, I’m okay.”
Comment what you guys thought... I wrote literally all of this in the very early hours of the morning, so there's a solid chance it's crap. Tell me if it's crap- I'm cool with feedback :) I also have very thick skin. Like a seal.
“So…” Draco said cautiously. “You’ll still claim the side door as your part of the house, right?”
Draco exhaled amusedly. “Just telling you the facts, my liege.”
So how could he, given all that, still be interested in finding out who it was that was writing those lyrics on the Quidditch shower wall?
Harry bit his lip. “Right. So…”
him, and then mouth at his love handles while he lay whimpering in the aftermath. His fingers plied the soft flesh of Potter’s hip, and the boy moaned outright, and Draco felt a great pulse of blood rush inevitably to his cock, and then- sweet Salazar- his left hand came away from where it had somehow tangled in Potter’s hair. He opened the door wide. In a tangle of limbs and breath and stormily conceived desire, they stumbled through it, out of the restaurant, and into the cool ambiance of London at night.
He blinked.
But whatever.
“So why…?” Ron looked utterly lost.
“I want to know why you ratted in my mother to the Ministry!”
“We should probably think of what to say before we go in there,” Potter said, eyes dancing with a spark of mischief that made Draco want to lick him. “You know, just roughly. You know what McGonagall’s like.” He looked over his shoulder dramatically, voice swooping into a stage- whisper that shot Draco’s poor nerves to pieces. “Rumour is she’s a
Blaise looked concerned now- he came towards Pansy and sat opposite her. Draco leaned back against the counter, eyes intent on their female friend.
Potter’s expression became cold. His breath was coming slightly more evenly now, but he was no less flushed, and his jaw was a hard, smooth line.
Eight- forty.
Draco set his shoulders, flicking open the Charms textbook and studiously poring over the introduction. He remained like this for a good few minutes, as the bell rang and two other NEWT students came hastily in, taking their seats and sliding textbooks towards them with looks of mingled weariness and nostalgia. Draco knew what they were thinking; what they were all thinking. Even after a couple of weeks of being back at school,
Blaise mock- gagged. “Ah, well, you win some, you lose some.”
He swallowed thickly.
A sleepless night, drunken encounter and deathly boring class drive Draco to the conclusion of what to do next.
The other boy laughed lowly, letting his grip on his wrists go, and he’d been holding on
would fall on his face, clearly far drunker than anyone has any right to be before second bloody period, into what’s clearly a hookup, and
Now that he was really thinking about it, it wasn’t the sexiest place to bring someone.
Hermione looked serene.
Ron looked offended.
Potter smirked at him, and Draco's guts twisted beautifully.
“Shall we?”
Draco cleared his throat, averting his eyes before he did something stupid like shove Potter up against the wall and kiss him soft and deep.
He glanced down at the boy in his arms, smirking hard, and reached his hand just a little further around his waist, pulling him in impossibly tight. Harry did not say a word. Draco pressed a hot breath into his hair, shifting as his fingers reached around, around—
“Mmph. Pansy, will you pass the rice?” Blaise said, mouth full.
Malfoy had rolled his hips, pressing what was definitely an erection (if Harry had to estimate, he’d say… fucking big) against Harry’s own cock, their boxers sliding over one another, the delicious friction sliding Harry’s eyes closed as he moaned unconsciously.
, thought Draco,
Draco looked down and followed the other boy, determinedly ignoring the way his nerves were lighting themselves on fire one by one.
“That was an opening for an apology, Malfoy. I should’ve know you would never take it.”
Harry stepped forward, anger flushing his cheeks. “I was just trying to be polite, Malfoy. Jesus. I don’t have to fucking make tea if you don’t want it, you just looked—”
“…yours?”
(Again, if pressed, he would have to admit that he was not exactly using his full strength.
Ginny gagged. “Ugh, don’t
Potter ducked his head slightly, an almost bashful smile on his face.
Blaise gagged. “Wish you wouldn’t do that.”
Draco spoke up, pressing down the anxiety inside him. “If anyone’s free and wants to spectate, that’s fine by us. But, like you said, Professor… it’s just a practice match.” He swallowed, feeling it necessary to elaborate a little. It had, after all, been his idea. “I’m, um, aware this is a little irregular, and I know normally we just practice in our house teams. But it’s a Muggle custom to have houses play each other less competitively, too. For the sake of getting, you know. Accustomed to the game again. And I just thought since the team was getting a bit restless, it might take the edge off. Challenge them.”
Potter sighed, and Zabini looked….
“Ginny, look,” he began in a hushed voice, “we’ll get you something to eat, just shut up about it for now, don’t say anything about being hungry when—”
“Very true, Malfoy.” His eyes roved, for a second, over Draco’s face, as if searching for something. He swallowed, and Draco saw his Adam’s apple bob with it. “Very true.”
He buried his head in his hands.
Draco’s jaw clenched. He couldn’t let that happen. He needed this person, whoever it was, to get him past Potter and this ridiculous… infatuation that could never lead anywhere.
“No? No, you weren’t serious?”
“Knowing her boyfriend has a boy… crush?”
“No, I’m not
The bell rang loudly, and it sliced through the small bubble they seemed to have been encased in.
Draco reflected peaceably.
The back stiffened, shoulders tensing even more than before, and a hand reflexively shot up to his hair, fingers spreading and raking reflexively.
“You idiot, Draco!” Theo said shrilly, and started to laugh. “Why are you using that bloody leaflet—” He broke off, and bit his lip, tear tracks still shining on his cheeks.
“So, Malfoy,” Potter said, throwing Draco into a mild panic because Salazar, he’d forgotten they’d have to talk and he hadn’t fucking prepared notes.
Hufflepuff finished in five minutes.
, he thought.
The squib sashayed away, pen and pad clasped tightly between two pale, red- tipped fingers. As she set the menus down on a podium near the bottom of the stairs, she tossed a coy glance over her shoulder at Blaise, lips arranged in a sultry pout, and then turned away, bare feet silent as she padded back up the stairs.
As they approached the exit, Potter called after them. “Wait! Blaise…”
Zabini looked pained. “I can’t… he has to…”
Who said anything about kissing?
“He’s alright, isn’t he?”
**********************************************************************************
But then… there was something about the way Nott was staring at the carpet, the way he was shifting uncomfortably under Draco’s heavy gaze, tugging at his schoolclothes as though he didn’t quite belong in them, as though he was afraid someone would point out that he looked different…
“Not in
Potter licked his lips- God, he kept drawing
Another two silvery platters, this time loaded with several china plates, Levitated towards their table with none of the schoolroom jerkiness Draco still Levitated things with (he was ashamed to say he’d never actually mastered Wingardium Leviosa—how could he, when Flitwick spent their entire lesson on it playing favourites with Granger?).
The plates were piled high with sushi, miso- smelling liquids, rice with delicate little crabs fried in honey and a stew- like concoction that Pansy declared, with a casually cosmopolitan slant to her mouth, was called ‘shabu- shabu’. It looked delicious.
“Gay?” Ginny offered.
His pulse skyrocketed, and he clamped down on his breath, trying to calm down, be rational.
The other man looked as though he were about to say something, as though he wanted to, but he was struggling to find the words. He looked right back at Harry, his eyes torn with some strange emotion that Harry wanted so badly to understand.
“Why?”
“That’s fine. He was old, and I think he was glad to go. He was happy when we were living here, but none of us stayed, obviously, and he got lonely—”
"I'm sorry. For-- before. In the broom cupboard, with Finnigan. The things I said... I was drunk. And stupid. I didn't mean-- I didn't mean any of it."
back to the girl I’m seeing. She gave them to me for free, but I guess she’ll be okay with a return.”
Potter grinned at him, a lazy grin that split his face open even as Draco stared at him, incredulous.
Nott rushed at him.
“Aaah, Draco, don’t sulk. We all have our strengths. You’ve the quickest draw in a duel I’ve ever seen,” Blaise said, patting his arm consolingly.
Just like that, whatever it was slid off Potter’s face, replaced by a laugh.
“Yeah.” It was too breathy, like a whisper, but he couldn’t help it. His voicebox felt like it was closing up, stomach screwing itself tight.  “If, you know, there is one.”
“The universe has done a lot worse.”
Draco had sort of expected  it, actually, with a sick sort of surety in his stomach.
Theo blinked, and said delicately. “I assumed… well, I guessed you were just upset.”
, Harry thought miserably, trailing his spoon through the gelatinous mixture.
Harry bit back a foul swear word.
Not Draco.
Blaise pressed his lips together, and to his credit, Draco would never have guessed at his amusement if it weren’t for his dimple pressing so deeply into his cheek it looked like a miniature abyss.
, though Draco could not fathom what. It was incredibly unlike Theo to ever lose his temper, as far as he could tell.
“Right, well the bell will be going any minute, so I suppose you’d all better pack away.”
Blaise raised his eyebrows expressively, dimple so deep it looked like a dent in cocoa cream. Draco fought the urge to snort with laughter, and Pansy narrowed her eyes at them.
Had Draco written that? He wracked his brains, trying to remember if he’d scratched two lines or three. His thoughts spun.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Draco didn’t need to decipher that.
“Right,” Ron mumbled. “Okay.”
“Who is it, then? Who’re you obsessed with now?”
He grinned idiotically at Potter for at least twenty seconds before Potter’s own smile softened to a smirk, and he leaned against the wall beside Draco, dropping his bag unceremoniously by his feet. Draco tried desperately not to get too worked up about the fact that their shoulders were only centimetres away, instead focusing on a speck of ink on Potter’s collar.
, by any chance? Because, if so, you know you can call it that, right? We’re all of age here.” He smirked in Blaise’s direction. “We’ve all done some questionable things in the name of hanky- panky.”
Weaslette stared at him, lips pursed, and turned to look at Potter, raising her eyebrow not unkindly.
“—your principles, yeah, we know,” Blaise finished, re- entering the kitchen and leaning against the countertop opposite Draco. His lean legs were draped in jogging bottoms, baggy fabric hanging just right over his strong calves and thighs. A sleeveless flannel shirt was carelessly unbuttoned over his chest, and Draco knew he looked kind of edible.
“Oh yeah,” Pansy said, “really terrifying, you are, ‘specially when you’re drunk and cuddly like some sort of debauched teddy bear.”
Just wait a second.
” Potter bobbed his head in time to the sound of his name, mouth pinched as though he was tasting something sour. But for all his seeming distaste in being so underhand, Draco could see through it. There was victory, sweet vindictiveness in Potter’s eyes, and Draco couldn’t look away.
Harry shook his head, smiling at her.
Ron paled, and appeared to steel himself, drawing himself up from his seat on the arm of Hermione’s chair.
Draco probed his feelings, anxious. And yes, he still wanted to know, desperately so. But, God… what would he do when he found out? What, was he expecting that person to just
“Suppose you found your balls. I could have helped with that, but looks like Finnigan here was doing a good enough job on his own.” He tossed Finnigan a cruel smirk, savoured the clench of the Irish boy’s jaw.
shirt. Oh, Harry, that’s not maroon! It’s plum.”
The driver’s voice, muffled and faintly annoyed, arose from behind the smudged panel of plastic.
For the next week, Draco thought only of the writing on the shower wall. He stumbled through classes in a feverish state, hair mussed, visualising only the spiky scrawl that he’d seen burned into the tiles. He’d told himself time and time again that it was ridiculous, that the fact that another student knew the Muggle song was coincidental, unimportant. However, it hadn’t stopped him from scrawling down the next line of the song, heart pathetically in his throat, hair plastered wetly over his forehead. He didn’t know what it was about burning the words into the wall- what he felt… it was like a storm of emotion, of power. The concentrated tingling of his magic in his fingertips, mingled with a muddied cocktail of excitement, confusion, and curiosity made his head buzz pleasantly.
“I must say, I am surprised to see both of you…” her nostrils flared slightly. “Working together.”
The cab cut through black, glistening roads, pools of rainwater gleaming silver in the lamplight, and it was really a beautiful night, Harry thought. A sense of delicious peace pervaded him. As Malfoy’s hand slowly reached over to curve around Harry’s knee, Harry’s stomach tightened, curling up and knotting beautifully, and his cock throbbed. With a complete abandonment of his fear that the ferocious desire pulsing through him was not reciprocated, he shifted over to Malfoy, jeans sliding over the leather, and placed his own hand on the leg of Malfoy’s trousers, palm sliding over the fabric.
Ron came thundering down the stairs presently, red hair ruffled. “Sorry,” he said sheepishly, “’Mione was making me try on dress shirts for the baby’s baptism. It’s a Muggle thing—”
Weaslette’s eyes burned into him like a brand.
“Inside.”
But Potter’s arms – predictably – were lean and hard beneath his robes, and even as Draco tried to kick him, the other boy stepped even closer so that their groins were flush, Potter’s thigh slotting between Draco’s legs with a rustle of thick fabric. The graze of friction to Draco’s cock was a jolting shock of pleasure up his spine. He battled desperately with the savage edge of arousal that surged up within him suddenly, sparking up at the most inconvenient time. And yeah, he was probably always a bit turned on around Potter. But this… Draco knew with a sick, cold certainty that he was about to get hard if he didn’t get let up in approximately two seconds. He sucked in a breath, trying to come back to himself, trying to escape the drug- haze of Potter’s heavy scent and the warmth of the fire seeping into the bones of his back. It was torture not to grind forwards, down, anything, on the thick muscle of Potter’s thigh, not even rub off against his hip. Draco held himself tightly in check, body frozen, but for the life of him he couldn’t take his eyes off Potter’s mouth.
and then there was Zabini, right in Draco’s face, chocolate eyes venomous.
Harry wanted to curl up and disappear. The last dregs of arousal were still throbbing in his belly, but now he was prickling with anger and fear and he really needed a shower. The pulse of nervous adrenaline in his ears told him this could go very wrong very quickly.
He looked up, and Draco sucked in a breath, clenching his stomach not to just come at the sight. Potter… his cheeks were flushed, schoolboy- flushed, and the green of his eyes was glossy with a desire that unfurled a thick, hot tendril in the pit of Draco’s stomach. His lips were redder than ever, bitten and slicked by a tongue that Draco could just barely make out, lips parted sweetly as they were. He wanted to lick deep into that mouth, stroke that dark hair back and bite that lip, tease it out between his teeth. He wanted to wreck him, muss up the beautiful glaze that was Harry Potter and make him shake, moan his name over and over in that fucking infuriatingly rough baritone.
“It’s fine,” Potter said roughly, and looked down. “It’s fine,” he repeated, softer.
Harry swore. “Right, off with the shirt.” He started trying to unbutton the unfortunate garment frantically before giving up, tearing it wholly off, and making his hair even more of a desperate situation than before.
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
“Well,” Blaise said slowly, and Pansy gasped audibly, eyes lighting with interest. She put her spoon down and sat forward. Draco slitted his eyes at her.
The three of them began to move towards the square, their breaths evening out as they adjusted to the abundance of oxygen. The cobbles were vaguely round under the stiff soles of Draco’s smart shoes, and as they stepped onto the pavement of one of Mayfair’s most expensive squares he wobbled, tipping slightly into Blaise, who stood stoically like a stunningly handsome post until Draco regained his balance. With a grateful pat on the shoulder they ducked across the street, weaving in between the traffic jam of highly- polished cars in an attempt to catch up to Pansy, who had set an extremely brisk pace. Her dark red dress gleamed in the pale light, and fluttered around her ankles slightly as she reached the other side of the road and continued across the heart of the square without once looking back to check on the other two. Draco and Blaise exchanged amused glances and continued to plunge in and out of the tiny gaps between bumpers and tyres, turning this way and that to avoid streaking their suits with grease.
“No- don’t take that tone! Don’t treat me like a child. Just because I…” Pansy swiped her hand over her upper lip, faint milk moustache transferred to a smudge on the back of her hand. It struck Draco how young that movement was, but decided, upon a second’s reflection, against saying that to Pansy. He doubted she’d appreciate the irony at that exact moment, and something in Blaise’s eyes, still fixed resolutely on the magazine, told him he should tread carefully.
“They’re so… tight.” Ron said lamely, eyes glued unflatteringly to Harry’s crotch area.
“Delicious,” Ron said quickly. “Like usual.”
“Well, my schedule’s pretty packed at the moment,” he said slowly, pretending to mull it over. “You’d have to ask Finch- Fletchley to move his slot over. He’s been wanting to prove things to me for…” he furrowed his brow. “Nearly two months, now.”
Draco resisted the urge to hide from Granger’s venomous gaze behind Potter, who he could hear groaning quietly behind him.
“Yep,” he said shortly, and opened his door onto the road, closing it quickly and dodging an oncoming car to duck around onto the uneven pavement.
It had started after the War, really. It wasn’t one of those gradual things, textbook medical issues that sprouted and grew over time. Exactly a week after Harry had defeated Lord Voldemort, he’d woken up in a cold sweat in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place, where they’d all been living while Ron and Hermione paid for the Burrow’s renovation. They’d been going out for lunch that day. It had been strange anyway, that feeling of freedom. The previous few days had been like something out of a dream. The absence of Voldemort had been surreal, and he’d thought that he was going to wake up any moment and find himself on the marble in Malfoy Manor, or lying tangled on the ground, thick with mulch and leaves, in the Forbidden Forest. It had been odd anyway. But that lunch… had been nightmarish. Harry remembered with a shudder how, when their waitress had approached- she must have been only seventeen, their age, with a bouncy ponytail of curling blonde hair and a shy smile- his heart had burst to thundering life, filling his veins with electricity and freezing him in place. He’d wanted to spring up and run away, screaming, but as she approached, coming closer and closer to their table, it was as though there was a great pressure bearing down on him, keeping him pinned in place. The cogs in his brain ground to a halt, and he was left pounding on the walls of his subconscious. The innate ‘Harry’ that he knew had vanished through his fingers like he never existed at all. He’d sat, ashen- faced, trembling, while the waitress asked for their orders. He hadn’t been able to utter a word. Hermione had asked for five more minutes, and she’d bent her head towards him, looking concerned. The sight of her familiar, soft brown eyes, combined with the sheer relief of the blonde ponytail retreating behind the bar, had loosened the vice- tight grip on Harry’s chest. He’d taken a shaky breath in, swallowed, and asked if they could ‘go home.’
The journey was torturous. It could not have been more than twenty five metres from his table to the small gate on the side of the bar leading to the toilets, but it seemed to him like he’d been walking for hours. Every time someone sniggered or sighed his entire body seemed to curl in on itself, paranoid they were sneering at him, waiting for him to go faster, mocking him.
“I want to say,” Potter continued jerkily, as though he were determined to say it. “I know we can both be… argumentative.”
“We met at a sort of Muggle… group therapy thing.” Zabini said, and a deep blush coloured his cheeks. “I was…” it rushed out of him in a confessional flood, humiliation eating at his diction. “I was there because my mum was distant, and messed up from everything, and I couldn’t risk anyone I knew finding out. I knew I had to resort to Muggles if I wanted to keep it remotely secret that I was having trouble at home. Unfortunately for me…” a genuine, albeit small, smile tipped the corners of his lips up. “Harry had the same idea. He was there because… well, that’s private.” Zabini shrugged apologetically. “But you can probably guess, to be honest. The things he’d had to do the year Voldemort died… he was struggling. Understandably, of course, but when I saw him sitting across from me I was a total dick about it.”
Who was going to want to date him? Who in the seven hells would ever even consider him like that? He was nobody at this school—worse than that. He was scum. He couldn’t put himself on a ridiculous dreg of hope, some fantastical dream that
Pansy’s more delicate capillaries were probably in danger of bursting right now.
“If you think for one second that you can drag my mother down with your father—"
“It has been… one of the few failures of my career,” she continued. “Getting Slytherin and Gryffindor to regard one another as anything but enemies.”
“Oh… great.” Potter looked nonplussed, and maybe a little suspicious, hair falling endearingly into his eyes and sticking up crazily. He looked confusedly between Blaise and Draco, and Draco wanted to laugh madly, because last Potter saw, he and Blaise were at each other’s throats. Blaise was also clearly struggling not to smirk, as Draco kept seeing the ghost of a dimple flashing in and out of his cheek while his muscles worked to keep his face blank.
“How… how long have you?”
Ouch.
And then there were the jeans clinging to Potter’s strong legs, legs that were wrapped around the back of the chair in such a way that made Draco’s blood rush somewhere south of his stomach. He resisted the urge to cover his crotch ashamedly at the sight of the smart, thick heels on Potter’s leathery boots. He wanted more than anything to see him stand up, to admire the turn of his calf and the thick, suckable curve of his thigh muscle under those jeans, accentuated to tearful perfection by the wedge heel.
“Okay Mr. Draco. Mr. Draco, will I have to get new robes, Father said we could only get one set so I have to take care of them and now they are dirty and ripped.”
Dromeda was quite Happy with her life. She got her husband and Child returned to her. She had a beautiful Grandchild. She got her favorite cousin back. And she was at least talking to her sister. Their relationship was still layers of complication but it had been 20 years since they were on speaking terms. Her nephew didn't even seem so bad now that he was determined to be a better person.
“I wanted to ask about my parents. Everyone else that came back. They were dead. My parents were in St. Mungos under my mothers maiden name to keep Death Eaters away. I made sure quite frequently during the last few years Bellatrix had not found them and killed them. Did you heal them? Or did they die?”
“And your Friends, Family, Godfather?”
“Mr. Potter it is also my understanding that during the battle of hogwarts after you came back from the dead so to speak that Draco Malfoy also gave you a wand then when you were defenseless against Voldermort by throwing it to you while you were running away and he was running toward the other side of the battle. Is that correct?”
“Hypothetically, If I knew of such 13 year olds who are now older I would still be under obligation to alert the ministry to unregistered Animagi Potter.”
My name is Narcissa Black Malfoy. I understand I possess no right to ask anything from you, but I beg you if you can, please testify on behalf of Draco the wednesday next at noon. His actions were forced by fear of Voldermort and loyalty to his father. I realize now that my son lied to Bellatrix and recognized you at our manor. My Draco is still just a lost boy who was forced into a war much like yourself I believe. I do not ask for anything for myself or my husband but please help my son however much you can.
A month later he was going to the mind-healer 3 times a week and considered Nydia a friend, maybe one of the few true friends he has ever had. He hasn't spoken to pansy or blaise, they were all dealing with the aftermath of the war.
“We’ll let's go then. We can finish paperwork later.” James smiles at him.
Mcgonagall, Kingsley, Harry, Hermione, Ron, James, Lily, and Remus were standing at the end of the hall. The heat had gone down but Mcgonagall kept the barrier up in case the Dark Magic loses control.
“Yes, she did. If you don't mind me asking how is the Manor these days?”
“Yes dragon of course.”
Teddy proves his point by changing the feathers on the ground to butterflies with a wave of the wand.
“Yes. You ridiculous man.” Remus answered.
“My name is Draco. I'm going to Hogwarts too see?” Draco said while pulling the front of his robes to show the slytherin crest. “What's your name?”
“Exactly he was letting his anger bleed into his magic. When a powerful wizard lets that happen, excess magic builds in the air. Riddle, You, The Dumbledore Family, Bellatrix, Sirius a little bit, many other Powerful wizards. More powerful than the average.
“Stop being a prat.” Harry threw a jinx back. Draco deflected it towards the room.
“Yes. They do.” Regulus smiled at her.
Draco nodded, took the papers and left the room. Almost everyone raised an eyebrow at Regulus. “You’ll see soon enough, the Prophet will have it as Anonymous. He wants it that way, he's only going to communicate with Kingsley to set it up.”
“Fine, we have a plan, we just need to talk to some people.” Harry replied as they continued on their way.
“Mm..Draco your father and I made more than our fair share of mistakes when it came to raising you. One of those mistakes is that we never let you think for yourself we always told you certain things were just the way of the world, for example Mud--muggle born wizards. I always wondered what happened to the smart girl from your potions class that was only in that one letter, until I asked Severus who you could be talking about and realized that you were speaking of Hermione Granger and that's why you never talked about her again. Son I think you can have your opinions, but no one ever asked what they were so you've never had to think about them.”
Kreacher nodded and gathered the house elves.
The Minister put up silencing charms and started to speak to the council, while Harry looked toward Mrs. Malfoy who looked at him and gave him a small smile and a nod. She then turned and looked at her son who looked at her with desperate and scared eyes. She gave him a small smile and mouthed ‘It's okay, It's going to be fine my dragon’. The nickname confused Harry as he looked at his mother and nodded his head then looked at Harry and gave him a minute nod and returned his eyes to the ground. Harry looked toward the minister again who had started to lower his charms.
When they got to the hospital the healers took Draco away to treat him. Harry couldn't get the image of Draco on the ground screaming in pain out of his head he slid down to the hospital floor and put his head in his hands knowing no matter what he did the image isn't going away. While waiting for the healers Harry's anger grew steadily, vowing to himself that once Narcissa got here and Draco's stable he was going to find who did this and make them pay. Just as he felt he was going to explode the healers came out and Harry stood to meet them.
Harry sighed heavily before answering “Of course I meant it. I didn't exactly mean to say it but I Do. I love you, and I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable. We can just ignore it and I'll keep my mouth shut till you're ready to hear it, and it'll be fine.”
“If you run down the DADA professors I've had you can't get much worse.
“No Promises.” Sirius smirked.
After Sirius and Harry’s fight
“What about my condition Minerva?” Remus asks.
Hermione rolled her eyes then nodded her approval. James looked a little put off by the prospect.
James sits in front of him on the coffee table. Sirius and Regulus stand behind James. Lily and Remus stand at each end of the couch circling him in. He can't help his nervous fidgeting. He thought he grew out of that the day he found the new word in a dictionary. That was the last time he fidgeted.
“What about two kisses?” Harry replied imploringly.
“Harry really?” Hermione asked.
“So how do we cleanse a room? Especially if we can't get inside. And it was quite a large room of hidden things.”
“And Do you Draco Lucius Malfoy take Harry James Potter to be your Lawfully and Magically wedded husband?”
“Yeah… I saw you take it that summer. I heard you had to be willing to take the Mark. I was hoping it was just a nightmare.”
“Also Harry said that your friend Chip said he come visit when you woke up lucid enough for a conversation. I also heard that Chip and Ron beat up the teenager who did this, so you'll have to thank them next time you see them.”
They sit until Kingsley comes out flanked by two Aurors. “Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy have to come with us. Draco you're welcome to stay here considering the circumstances, However we ask you don't return to the Manor.’ He says softly ‘We’ll give you a moment to say goodbye.” He turns and heads inside leaving the two Auror’s out by the entrance.
“Really Potter, have you lost all your dueling skills since killing Riddle? That was pathetic.” That worked. The air crackled as they started to duel.
“That's okay when and if you forgive him it needs to be for yourself not for him. But do you still love him?”
Ron destroyed the Locket in the forest of Dean.
Studying with both Draco and Hermione was strict. Very strict. They were willing to help only after finishing that mini section of studying they were on. And there was no joking of any kind. Harry and Ron escaped to the Professor three days a week to get a break from it.
I have seen the worst of you. I have a pretty good track record of being there for the worst times in your life. This is not who you are, you're not that person. If you wanted to rebuild the family name through nefarious ways you would have taken credit for the orphanage and Bellatrix’s vault. And everything else you’ve done without me knowing.
Harry chuckled as they both laid down in their beds. “Dick.’ Harry paused until the lights were all put out. They had stopped the privacy charms a little after they moved past their history. ‘Even so far as to house muggle-born children whose families don't approve of magic."
Harry realized that those must be journals his mind-healer is making him keep. Harry only has a few but would probably react the same way if someone tried to read them. “Oh sorry” Harry said trailing off when he saw that Draco had laid out clothes on the bed for Harry and was currently just standing in his boxers with clothes in his hand.
Death Eater Draco Malfoy Dating The Saviour??
“I understand the terms of my sentence minister. Thank you.”
Teddy was a bright spot for everyone. He tended to change his hair color to who he wanted. That was a guessing game with the Weasleys and Lily. Then with James, Harry, Andy, Sirius and Regulus. Hermione, Ted and Remus were the easy ones. It was set at blue most of the time but changed into a mix of colors when he wanted his mom.
Draco opened it to find a sleek necklace and a note.
"Why?" Draco wrinkles his nose.
“No. Plus you don't have to stop using DADA. You could train on your own for a bit. Practice on other things first. Then you would be prepared for training.”
They spent the next 2 months doing school and visiting Hogsmeade every weekend. Draco hung out with Chip and brought him to hang out with the trio every now and again. 1 month after Christmas Draco got his mother's flowers tattooed around his scarred Dark Mark, and Harry told him he would look good with more tattoos.
Mr Black would take my position for transfiguration. Hypothetically It would take quite high skill to teach 3 13 year-olds to be animagues.”
Draco nodded to Pansy and Blaise and they excused themselves to look at the window sweets.
---------
It was built on the same plot as the old house. They expanded it on the ground and stabilized the upper floors. Now each kid had their own room. The kitchen and dining room were separated by an open counter. The furnishing was new but just as comfortable. They had two sheds out back. One for quidditch and one for Aruthur. They enjoyed their money but didn't spend it all which was smart.
“So you let them hex you even though you could have stopped them?”
“I’ll go get her.’ Harry floo’s while Draco pulls Scorpius back in. He comes back less than 30 seconds later with a very prepared and packed Narcissa. She joins Draco and Scorpius in their hug. ‘He broke into our house. Even with the bullshit paper he used to get out it breaks his probation. What do you want to do?”
“I'm sorry, Harry said my mind was fine but apparently not, Ron Weasly beat someone up for me is a completely mad idea.” Draco said with concern laced on his face.
“I would appreciate it if you didn’t tell your friends everything I told you. Their morals are too high.”
They sat like that for a few more minutes before Greg started to pull away. Pansy and Blaise sat back down. The waiter brought their sweets and coffee plus a hot chocolate for Greg over a few seconds later.
With that there was a strange tension between Lily and Molly given that Molly was the closest thing Harry had to a mother for a long time.
“If they all fail at transfiguration, don't say I didn't warn you.” Sirius said.
“Last I heard he left with Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Granger, His parents, Sirius, Remus, and Mr. Black to the headmasters office.”
The last person Scorpius was expecting to see come through the floo was his grandfather. He knew of his grandfather. The whole world did. His Dad spoke of him as little as possible. He knew better than to mention Grandfather around Grandmother.
“But after 17 years of hearing the same thing it's hard to believe the one time you're told differently.”
Regulus laughed as he opened his present. He stayed until after Dinner and Dessert before heading out to make a Christmas delivery.
“Dragon, shhh, calm down, it's okay,’ Narcissa soothed him, bringing him into her arms. ‘My Draco, why don't you go to Nydia's see if she's there and take the letter with you to show her, and once you have decided what's best we’ll work it out from there. Harry and I will wait for you here. Okay?”
“Thank you sir”
“Hi sweetheart. Whatcha you doin?”
When he got home that night he said hello to his mother then went to his room and started to list the people he hurt the most.
“Yes, but I'm right to. I did terrible things, and let other terrible things happen, of course I feel guilty, It's what I deserve to feel.”
“Sure, Mr. Potter”
5 Years Later
“Good morning Harry, Good morning Draco’ ‘-mmmgggg-’ ‘Anyway sleepy head I made pancakes for breakfast if you want Harry, only awake wizards get their breakfast.” Narcissa teased with a smile.
"Well Fred & George sure are getting him started young." Tonks commented with a WWW box in her lap.
Next week came and all the 8th years along with the rest of the children going to Hogsmeade were excited to go. They made the walk, went to get butterbeer, went to the typical shops, and went to the overlook of the shrieking shack. All together they were having a pretty typical Hogsmeade trip, something all of them were happy with, sometimes typical was really good.
“That's what he said when he did it too. He said he had gone mad.” Harry replied chuckling.
Umbridge, who used a quill that used your blood as ink, taught everything from the book, wouldn't allow practical magic, and forced us to make Dumbledore's Army to pass our O.W.L.’s.
“It was the first time I left the grounds. A man called me Death eaters Scum, Mother didn't react. My family started to teach me at 5. I read a book about the war at 6. Mother killed herself when I was 7. She made them keep it a secret. They raised me, then I went to Hogwarts. I wanted to bring Dobby, he’s my best friend. I was going to tell someone but I was already the first Malfoy in Gryffindor. I didn't want more attention. People tend to forget I'm a Black too. I'm not the first Black that was a Gryffindor. I was 14 and I realised I wanted Harry. It was the first time they weren't enough. Harry asked me on a date when we were 16. They helped me get ready. I kept it secret until I was eighteen. Until you all found out.”
Silence filled the hall as Voldemort and Harry began at the same moment to circle each other.
Narcissa noticed the look on her son’s face. “I agree with Mr. Potter, Chocolate does help after a cleanse.”
“The six newest things on the menu. Three black coffees, and can you tell Gregory the Slytherin’s are here Please?"
“And if we needed to take it slow, even actively try to keep it from the papers for a bit?”
“Draco. Baby please. Explain it to us.” Harry tells him.
“Yes.”
"Oh, Dragon mine and your father's actions are our own. You cannot be at fault for that." She stood and cupped his face in her hands. "Draco. No matter what happens I will always love you and the bad events you were born and brought into are no ones fault but me, your father, and  V..Vold..Voldemort, okay? I need you to know that Draco."
They cant play quidditch outside without the muggles seeing
“Sometimes he would hear about their plans for the younger years and made sure to cross their path. Make a snide comment or two. Then they had the younger years cast cruciates instead, on Malfoy. Most of them couldn't do it. I dont think a lot of people realized he was doing it.” Ginny said.
Malfoy sighs and crouches down in front of Teddy where Harry is presenting him. Teddy automatically changes like he does every time he meets someone new. His blue hair goes platinum blonde. His light brown eyes go silver with a line of amber Teddy can never seem to get rid of.
“Natural curiosity I guess. And they are also confused. In their previous state of mind sometimes they weren't sure what was real and what wasn't.”
“Did you guys order the new stuff? I think you’ll really like it.”
“It seemed like he just wanted to do the right thing.”
“I-I-Sir I have no defense. I do carry the dark mark. I did fix the vanishing cabinet used to transport death eaters to Hogwarts. I was there for the capture and torture of all of those people even if i did not do the tourtering I did not stop it either. I accept whatever sentence you give me minster.”
“Well... what if Regulus came. He's been over there a few times. Draco hasn't reacted badly to him.”
“Yeah they loved us.” Draco answered like it was obvious.
“Hey. How’d it go?” Harry sat up in his bed to ask.
“Of course darling you wrote them, but you may not get rid of any, there's a reason I'm keeping them.”
“NO It's not. Draco are these from me? Did I do this when I almost killed you?!” Harry demanded with tears in his eyes.
“So it's my fault Severus died…” Draco said quietly with tears in his eyes.
Dumbledore put the ring on. His hand was turning black, and Snape said he had a year to live at the most.
Sirius hummed disbelievingly.
“Oh.” Harry said with raised eyebrows.
"I love you too Dragon. Be careful.
“Hey I punched him too. Do I get a kiss from the pretty lady?” Questioned Chip earning himself a kiss on the cheek.
Harry stopped confused, “Why? You were being a dick.”
“Some Restitution to individual people, purchase another Manor and Donate to the ministry for an Orphanage. A wing or two will be for people who are still displaced by the war until they recover. I want to do all that anonymously. No newspaper, No name on the building, No attachment to a political regime.”
“When did you figure it out? That most of what your parents taught you was wrong.”
“I know who you are Mr. Malfoy. I am Nydia, tell me where did you learn such accurate Occlumency, it takes great skill to implant new memories.”
If I had not persuaded your parents to change their secret keeper to Peter.
“So, that's what Harry Potter is going to do. Reshape the education in the wizarding world.”
“Thanks.’ Harry hugged him tightly ‘Now you.”
The next few days were spent in the hospital goofing around as much as the staff allowed it, which brought glimpses of Dracos mischief to his eyes that faded out during sixth year, with Blaise, Pansy, Chip, Hermione, and Ron visiting. Ron and Draco shared a few civil words before going back to bantering with each other including Thank you and You're Welcome.
“Do you feel guilty?”
---------
Her smile.
“No Draco. I don't want to change it. I like the idea of the word meaning something else other than you bleeding out on a bathroom floor.”
“...I know he won't hurt me but he won't always protect me either.”
“Okay.’ Draco said, taking a moment of quiet, ‘You know what made me the most angry when you got thrown in here was?’ He questioned looking at Lucius ' It was that I lost my father and I couldn't ask you what to do. I broke Harry's nose on the train because I missed you, and now you've left again, you're back in here, and Azkaban doesn't exactly have visiting hours. I just want my Father back, the one before Hogwarts and before sixth year, the one who loved me and was proud of me.” He ended quietly.
“Mr. Malfoy has sustained a serious injury to his body. He’s stable now, but he’ll sleep for two or three days till he's lucid enough to hold a conversion. You can go into his room now”
Harry opened his. It looked similar to a muggle camera but things that are similar to the muggle world usually have very different purposes in the Wizarding world. “What’s it do?” He smiled.
Tonks was flying through life. She had one week on the job then one week with Teddy. Some weeks the week with Teddy took more energy than finding dark Wizards. She was ecstatic that she came back and could actually raise her child, and she had her dad back. She was doing okay with the separation from Remus. Some Days she would miss him a lot, those days she reminded herself of the days she felt like second best. They still saw each other now and again but it was different from being together. She hoped someday she would find someone to share the rest of her life with just like her parents.
James threw out a theory, “He might not be ready to have a relationship. He may want to wait until the war’s further past.”
After Ron and Hermione left, Harry poured himself a firewhiskey to think. He could testify and they would probably just get a slap on the wrist. If he didnt they would probably be sent to spend the rest of their lives in azkaban. Draco didn't deserve that he made bad choices, but he didn't have very many options after Lucius got locked up the first although he supposed that was all his fault to, he also sufferd dearly in his own way. Narcissa loved or maybe still loves her husband but she loves her son abundantly more and that love might be the only reason she didn't flee as soon as Lucius was gone she wasn't going to leave her son alone with Voldemort. Lucius did deserve to spend the rest of his days in Azkaban, all he wanted was the glory and power. He thought once more about the way the light seemed to dim out in those shining silver eyes during sixth year, and he knew he owed at least two of the Malfoy family his life, and he would try to save theirs.
Draco woke to screams, shooting up he looked around till his eyes caught Harry tossing and turning in his sleep. “Harry, Harry wake up!Harry,” Once Draco realized that Harry wasn't waking he panicked and put his hands to Harry's head and focused his mind.
"Draco…"
Draco looked down at Chip and saw that he was hiding halfway behind him looking almost as scared as he did in the forest, so Draco nudged at him and said "Hey its okay go on, you have to get sorted into your house' then whispered to him 'plus as soon as you move away from me they'll stop staring at you."
“Why?” Draco asked
“Feel free Mr. Malfoy. You are welcome to use my floo. If the Manor is accessible.”
They were content with the children they had. They weren't actively looking to have more. Plans changed. A baby was left on their doorstep. Baby Knightley the note said. Her parents said they trusted Harry and Draco to be the parents they couldn't be, to give her the family they couldn't. Draco knew it was a done deal as soon as Harry held her for the first time.
There wasn't much to do in Azkaban. If I was really bored I’d pick a fight with Bellatrix. Of course the Dementors came around. But I had 12 years of If’s Harry. They didn't do me a single ounce of good. You can't think about If’s. There really is no If after the fact. It’s not a viable thought. You have to force yourself not to think about it.’ Sirius gently pulled Harry into a hug. ‘It’s not your fault Harry.”
“Can I ask you something personal?”
“...Maybe. If they forgave me.”
“That’s why you didn't know how to shake hands. Why you’re so socially unaware and awkward. You only had interactions with house elves.” Harry says. Draco meets his eyes with tears down his face. Harry wraps him tightly in a hug and kisses his forehead. Draco closes his eyes trying to block out the world.
And you know you can't stay out of the Papers forever. They’ll get bored and come back to their favorite topics. Harry Potter, Powerful families, and The War. You're quite intertwined with all 3 of those. And Harry is certainly not going to care what the Papers say.
“Mr. Malfoy, what can I help you with?”
“Well I think it sounds like a great idea.” Hermione said standing.
Harry rereads the opening page then looks at Draco. “Draco you know this doesn't matter right? They don't even know anything about us.”
He automatically starts to sob. “I didn't know where else to send him. Is he-”
“Good. We’ll do that then.”
“They did. But it's okay because I have a surprise for you two.” He said putting an arm over Regulus and Lily and leading them away.
Each house dorm has been expanded for the overload of students. Eighth year will have separate dorms. Bullying of any kind will not be tolerated. In this castle we are all on the same side. May we come together this year to move past the prejudices of war and into a new time. A lighter time. Enjoy your fest.” McGonagall sat back down amid the applause.
“None of you are acting like this is a social visit. Why are you here?”
“I told you, I have a hand on it at all times. Here come sit by me so you're behind him. He’s not even saying anything, just feels and the wand pops something out.”
Draco caught Harry’s hand in his. “Stay Harry.” He whispered.
He doesn't understand. "Draco Malfoy. Why is your hand out?" He looks at it with a confused frown.
Harry's team won but it was a relatively close game.
“Both Lily and Regulus ignored me for years. Lily thought I was a jerk, which was kinda true, and a player ,which was not true no matter what she says.’ Harry chuckled.
And coming from a muggle family and just thrown into this world. All the things I didn't understand. How the school works, what you can do in the world. Even now I don't actually understand what I can do in the wizarding world. I don't understand how it works.
“Yes, You jerk I know what you mean. And I meant it my mother's wand just doesn't get me well, bloody hell some days my new wand still doesn't get me. Thank you Harry. I've missed this wand dearly. I'll have to call the ministry and tell them to regulate this wand as well.” Draco said, finally picking the wand out of the box.
“Well alright then.” Aberforth then left them to their drinks.
“You said Dark Magic infects the air, but only once it's released. Like my anger charges it but only if I let my anger into my Magic. A horcrux is a lot of Dark Magic but it's contained, until it's destroyed. Mostly it's so powerful that it infects the person who carries it. Voldmort’s Face always came out of the Horcrux. For most it was in smoke form, this one was fire, and the one Hermione and Ron destroyed in the chamber was water.”
“Well’ Hermione sighed. ‘He’s not wrong. Draco probably needs to hear something from you. He's like this because other people said something, you can probably fix it by saying something else.”
“Dobby! I missed you!” He yells.
"Yes Professor?"
James stood and whipped the cloak off. “How’d you know?”

“You forget you can not hide anything from your mother Draco. How long have you loved Harry Potter- don't deny it we both know it's true- and how in the world did you hide it?”
“How do you know that though?!’ Draco stands and starts to pace in front of Harry. ‘With everything I’ve done is it really that hard to believe I see you as a political opportunity? That would hardly be the worst thing I’ve done.”
“Harry, Bellatrix killed me. She’s the reason I died.” Sirius replied gently.
“He told you.”
“I won't.” Neville walks back down the walkway and out the gates. He arraperates as soon as he can. “Mom. Dad. I'm home. I figured it out.”
“What do you mean the elder wand didn't work for him?” Draco asked confused on what his father was talking about.
Muggles: Wankers, Knowledge Limited
“Hello Draco, how has your week been?”
I think you would all make great Professors, Remus already is one.” Harry pointed out.
“Wat knd?” Draco said with his head still buried getting two twin responses
---------
They came out to their friends at the next gathering in the Room of Requirement. This time it was only their friends.
“Okay Harry, whatever you want to do, let us know please. Come on Ron lets go.”
James and Lily Potter land in front of Ron and Hermione, directly across from voldemort. Voldemort furious starts mumbling to himself “how are they alive”.
“Wait, why can only certain people see them?”
He arrived at the ministry at 11 unable to stop thinking about how it would be the first time since Malfoy threw him a wand that he would see him. He supposed he would have to also point that out during his testimony today. He stepped into the lift and thought about the previous times he had been down to the courtroom. One seemed like it was a lifetime ago him being the one on trial and One seemed like it was years instead of a couple of months. All thoughts of anything disappeared when he stepped off the lift and his eyes locked with malfoy’s. His eyes changed so much over the last two years from the beginning of sixth year determined and prideful to when he looked desperately afraid to completely blank and lifeless to relieved and tried, but they never had quite returned to sparkling with mischief and dangerous glee, to matching the mirth and laughter in his voice before that changed too. After a moment Harry forced himself to break away looking to Narcissa who was watching them with a weird expression on her face and the ministry worker who looked scared half to death to be by the malfoys even if they were cuffed and wandless. He supposed he should ask someone how he was supposed to do this as he walked over the workers eyes widened in either surprise or fear although he's not sure which.
"Wait you'll still talk to me right?"
The crowd Gathered around Harry, Ron and Hermione were the 1st to reach him. He thought he could see his parents and Sirius and Remus coming behind them. He closed his eyes and focused on breathing.
“So your solution is to throw money at everything just like your father?” Sirius asked bluntly.
“Yes.”
“Hogwarts would be honored to have you all. Potter I'm to assume you will return. What about Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger?”
---------
“You don't even like him.” Harry pointed out.
Harry’s breath catches and a large smile breaks across his face. “I love you too Draco Lucius Malfoy.” He whispers back equally softly.
“Michelle!’ she looks at him in surprise. ‘I need you to send an emergency message to Draco Malfoy. We need a curse breaker here now! Sign it Head Auror. Nothing else.” She nods her head and he goes back to his office. He waits impatiently in front of his floo. Not 5 minutes later Draco comes through.
This time Andromeda was dropping him off to Remus. Tonks had got called off to an emergency. The professors were hanging out in the 8th year common room. The 8th year's found it soothing to talk to other people who also went to school during a war.
Draco then reached for his mother's hand realizing for the first time he held his mother's hand in one hand and Harry's hand in the other. His mother woke when he moved his arm looking at him worriedly. “Dragon, are you awake? You're not in pain are you?”
By the second day he was dying. Draco was back to class today but he was wearing his old Pureblood mask so of course Harry got nothing from him. When Draco didn't look at him during DADA Harry slouched at his table while everyone else left.
‘Some of the rooms were too much for me and mother alone. Cleansing Dark Magic is taxing for your magic and it has to be precise and practiced. Even Sirius had to come help for the worst rooms. I’m willing to bet that a Horcrux contained to a room this small with Fiendfyre and multiple other objects that were bound to be destroyed by it. It will take a lot more than just us four.”
“Oh. Hermiones the mudblood right?” Lucius asked with curiosity
"I don't believe she did. When she got to my body and realized I was alive she asked me one thing. She asked if her son Draco was alive. I nodded my head yes and she turned around and told Voldemort I was dead. I believe that her reason for lying was her trying to protect her son the best she could given the circumstances. It's the second time my life has been saved by the bond of mother and son".
“I would prefer it was just me and her in an office Minster surely that would be easier”.
“Regulus, would you stop eating?” Sirius said.
“Yes.”
“You're just giving it back?”
“For what…?”
“Alright then Mr. Potter you may speak."
“What?”
“Minnie what would we even teach?” Sirius asked.
“Hello Dragon. I’m very proud of you.”
Sirius heaved a sigh then sat back down and started eating. “Keep eating Reg.”
“Yes. Everything the room could get.” Draco said quietly.
“Yeah. There was a good amount of Dark Magic in the room before but it's never spread out into Hogwarts.”
The Prophet
Each new professor got their own set of connected rooms. It was more set up like the dorm rooms then private quarters.
Draco eventually trusted his father again and forgave him for his past mistakes with the thought that Lucius praised Hermione every time he talked to someone.
“Well forever is a long time but if you must. I would like you to come look at these cottages that are on the ministries list please. I plan to move to the area around Hogsmeade so I can see you during term. I think leaving this house in the past would be best for us.”
“I love you too, Son.”
“If Mcgonagall gets approval for mother, that's her, me, Regulus, and Sirius. It's most effective when the cleanser's magic is close. Family bonds or marriage bonds. I think Andromeda would be willing to help. Tonks would be practiced enough from Auror’s that she would do fine. That's 6. With more than one cleansing session that might be enough.”
“You don't think I would be that out of training if I took time off. Here we have classes and do DADA every other day.”
Harry snorted. “I don't know.’ He sighed. ‘I fixed my Holly wand. Put the Elder wand back. Don't know what to do with this one. If I give it back does Malfoy become the master of the elder wand again. And how do we know this would even work for him.”
"Okay' Harry said with a small smile 'Um. No it won't be like 6th year. Although we will probably watch you when you're in the same room. Sorry."
He avoided eye contact. He couldn't do that. He can't do anything right, he always fails. Now he's failing his mother because she asked him to try and he can't do it.
Voldemort is in a battle with Professor McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, And Professor Slughorn.
“It was good.’ Draco said sitting next to him. ‘He said Thank You. I think it was good for him. His shop is doing great and he made these little sweets. With your taste for treacle tart you would really like it.”
Draco snorted. “No. Absolutely not. I’ve had one drink. I know you aren't drunk, you haven't even finished your first one, even if I'm willing to bet you’re a lightweight.”
“Okay let's go talk to Mcgonagall and Kingsley to get your mother.’ Harry said, grabbing Draco's wrist and taking him down the hall. ‘Then we can write to Andy and Tonks, then talk to Sirius and Regulus.”
Half-Bloods: Half of our world, Strong, Some bad, Some good, Some good and bad
"It's fine Harry. There's going to be plenty of people watching me this year. Anyway goodnight Harry."
By the end of the first month after the end of the war everyone had bonded a bit. There were still problems but the actual fights were more between siblings than anything else.
“I don't know. It was anonymous. I think Kingsley knows. There's been a rise of spontaneous large donations for a specific cause. If it were anything else I would guess wealthy Purebloods. But they probably wouldn’t support some of the things and they like to put their name on everything.”
Harry sighs and leads him to the bed. He wraps himself around him in a hug and pets his hair. “It’s okay. Everything's Okay.”
Muggles
“Yeah, well I fixed mine and this one's yours so…”
“Yeah I'm going to uh do that, Bye Hermione we can finish the potion another time.” Draco said picking up his stuff and slinging his bag over his shoulder finally breaking his trance. Draco sat outside the exam room for an hour and a half waiting for Harry to finish. He came out with Ron who said “Well, as much fun as this seems i'm going to go do anything else. Good luck mate.” While clapping Harry on the back earning a double glare from both the boys.
“You too Love.” Harry replied.
His mother hugs him first “I'm so proud of you, I know you brought them back.” She hasn't hugged him like this since The Dark Lord came back.
“Okay...Has my mother been sleeping and is she allowed to be here?”
Naturally they bought most of the trolley, and the train was packed this year. 8th year students, and 1st years with all the kids who were redoing a year. Hermione said she would bet that McGonagall had to work quite a bit with Hogwarts to extend the dorms.
“Very well. The quarters will be set by the end of the week for you to move in. I will send more information soon. I shall take my leave now.” She smiled.
“He wants us to visit! Who does he think he is, he thinks he can destroy our lives then ask us to come give him some company. Come talk about things. Work it out. And how dare he ask you to come visit him. He must know if you are not there you're not allowed to talk to death eaters. After months, months of being there, now it's okay to want to talk! No absolutely not I'm not going and you can't. We should just burn the stupid thing.” Draco Exploded, letter crumpled in his hand.
“Actually my healer said I should bring someone that understands our family but that's not in the middle of me and Siri, and You and Sirius never got along, Cissa.”
“I...I don't know how I feel. I've always just did what my father wanted or believed what my mother said.”
Now the older kids went to Hogs head to see Aberforth and get refreshments but the younger kids still went to The Three Broomsticks. All the other stores were decorated for the Christmas holidays.
Blood-traitors: Bravest people in the world, considered below muggles and muggle-borns by death eaters
“Hi Jimmy, If something happens to either of them I'm blaming you.” Harry said with a small smile and serious eyes, He waited till Jimmy nodded before leaving “Lets go guys.”
The new ministry worker they were following was much more put together then the previous one although he only looked slightly less terrified which gave him just a sliver of satisfaction. The worker led them back to their holding cell which they got to share being mother and son. He let his mother wrap her arms around him, neither of them speaking just holding onto each other thinking to themselves.
Draco walked away from him ignoring his calls to bring him back. He walks back in and sits back down with his mother, leaning into her touch when she runs a hand through his hair.
“Right. We’ll talk now. I hope you don't mind me eating my lunch. I was going to the breakroom. So obviously your mother can't go but do you want to see your father?” She questioned while sitting at her desk and opening her lunch.
“Come in Narcissa, It's open.” Harry said sleepily causing Draco to whine and snuggle more into Harry.
“Surprised, but pleasantly so,” McGonagall said. Draco looked up.
“Salazar, Zabini,” Draco said angrily, following him in. “I know you don’t like me, but—“
The smirk faded off the Hufflepuff’s face as he took in the look in Draco’s eyes. Little shit had forgotten that he was messing with an eighth- year. For one heady second, Draco imagined shoving the idiot’s face into his plateful of mashed potato. But he was itchingly aware, even then, of eyes on him. It went against every grain of his pride to take his hand off the smooth handle of his wand, give the Hufflepuff one last furious stare, and turn. And it would’ve been fine, he would’ve moved on, but then from where he turned around a jeer arose, undoubtedly from the same arrogant worm. Draco whirled, hand flying back to his wand and whipping it out. Before the sneer could even die from the boy’s lips, the kid screamed in shock. He slid to the floor, writhing oddly. The entire Hall erupted in yells. Draco was faintly aware of the teachers rising to their feet from their table. Draco didn’t even know what he’d done to the boy. Horror pooled in his stomach. Had he inadvertently used the Cruciatus on him? A vision flashed before his eyes; smooth, pale skin, slits for nostrils, red eyes like fire. A wand that twirled and jabbed and a high shrill voice laughing, laughing, as Draco twitched in agony on the ground. Draco ran to the Hufflepuff table. A small fair- haired girl who had been sitting beside the boy shrank away from him, pointing down to where the third- year was writhing.
“I think- I read the Muggles had a word for that sort of thing, I don’t remember, I—”
And making a plan for that turned out to be… a lot more difficult.
“Liar,” Harry said. Ginny grinned sheepishly. “This is the moment you realised you were gay. You remember everything; I should know, I
“I’m going to have to go out there.”
“I don’t need your fucking charity, Golden Boy.” His voice was rough, raspy, and he saw Potter visibly inhale, this sharp little breath that Draco just kind of maybe wanted to press deep into his mouth, imprint on his skin.
Draco stared at him blankly.
Pansy glowered.
Ludicrous.
They separated, and Ron cleared his throat, sinking back down onto the sofa. Hermione wrapped an arm around him, and Ginny sprawled over the loveseat, head in Harry’s lap.
— Draco started, then broke off mentally, berating himself for starting that up again.
“Since the last couple years of school,” Harry replied, trying to keep his voice steady. He shrugged, falsely nonchalant. “Longer, maybe.”
Their mouths met with an easiness that made Harry tremble, and why had they ever argued, why had they ever shouted in hallways and glared and spat insults across classrooms when they could have been doing this, tongues sliding over one another with a wet, filthy friction that turned Harry to absolute jelly, and Draco was groaning into his mouth as his tongue ghosted over Harry’s lower lip, licked into his mouth like he was devouring him. Maybe he was. They were melting into each other, Harry’s hands sliding up to tangle in Draco’s hair- fucking God, it was so soft- and both of Malfoy’s hands were on his back now, moving lower and lower, pressing them together as their mouths moved over each other fiercely.
“You personally, halfwit,” Zabini snapped.
he thought with horror- as he was faced with the sharp glitter from a pair of green eyes that were already staring deeply into his own. It completely disarmed him. The shock of seeing a deep, slow smile carve itself onto Potter’s outrageously full mouth startled Draco back into action, and he tore his eyes away, picking up his bag with an unusual-
Nothing.
A girl walked in front of Harry, the flare of her dress momentarily blocking his view, and he gave a deep sigh of frustration. Being him—being like this—was exhausting.
And he wasn’t
Draco thought randomly. A sudden mental image of the dark- haired boy facing off against Draco in Malfoy Manor flashed into his mind. His cheeks had been stubbled, yeah, but they had retained some boyish roundness. Now… that was gone, along with the stubble. There was only a sharp line of skin, pure and unmarred in its stubborn set.
**********************************************************************************
Harry groaned. “Right. Okay. Fine, just—the shirt?”
Draco tried hard not to blush, thoughts crashing back to a series of very vivid images of Potter holding his wrists with… other intent.
one. He gagged mentally, and—
“Because what?”
Draco’s head began to throb fiercely.
And Potter – damn him, Potter smirked, biting his delicious bottom lip until it was flushed and bright against his pale skin.
he thought frustratedly.
Before Draco could get a word out, Potter was holding up a hand, still coughing- rather dramatically, Draco thought. “Jesus, Malfoy,” he gasped. “Do you always round corners at that pace?”
Draco looked up.
Blaise hooted. “So, what, you did
“Apology?” Draco rounded on him, feeling irrationality take control of him. “Why should I apologise?”
“So,” Potter started, “who wants to start?”
They were practicing Lucidity Charms, simple enough, but requiring a basic level of calm and mental control that Draco was dubious as to any of them possessing at the present time. Indeed, across the room, Longbottom, Bones and Finch- Fletchley seemed to be having better luck, all of them staying remarkably clear- headed after casting Confundus Charms and Tipsy Jinxes on each other.
McGonagall’s tiny smirk grew exponentially as her eyes flashed for a moment towards Draco. “It is a crucial distinction, no matter whom you may wish to impress.”
“It’s called a friendly.”
“Nothing,” Harry said, a smirk tugging his lips up. “I just—”
********************************************************************************************************************************************
In an attempt to wean himself off the addictive- and he was fairly sure, illegal- act of graffiti, Draco had gone into the shower stall to the right of his usual one. Remington, the oblivious wretch, had slid into the stall with the lyrics on the wall, and so Draco had stewed quietly, gritting his teeth the entire shower long, unable to relax under the hot spray of water. He’d listened obsessively to Remington in his stall, enduring the wavering bursts of impromptu song that slid in like demons under the door. And then, like the lost cause he was, he had waited for Remington to get out, listening for the wet slap of feet against tiles to fade away, and Draco had scrambled into his rightful stall, cricking his neck in his haste to turn to the wall with the writing on it. The rush of pure adrenaline at the sight of the new lines, the purr of a hope fulfilled had been good. But the scratching of his own replying words, burned a deep, irrefutable black, had given him a thick feeling of satisfaction in his belly that was even better. The other person had gotten to- what, somewhere in the second verse?
