Harry would also like me to express his gratitude towards his gifts you sent. He is absolutely enamored with the practice broom you sent, and I know I speak for both myself and Crowley when I say we appreciate the height limit it's been charmed with. I do hope it doesn't effect the charm at all that he's somehow managed to carve his initials into the side of it. How he managed to do so, I have no idea, but he was quite so proud of his work that I didn't have the heart to fix it.
She wasn’t sure how conscious he was of her words, but he lifted his head regardless, eyes staring through her as she placed the glass in his hands and helped him raise it. She didn’t let up until he’d at least drank half of the glass, slightly surprised when he then dropped his head onto her shoulder and let out a heavy, broken breath.
Lucius was nodding, tapping his finger on his cane softly. “There are some stores for wizards with disabilities as well. They aren’t very common but I believe I know of one in Diagon Alley. We should stop there as well, perhaps get him an automatic writing quill that will translate lessons for him. I will speak with Draco’s tutor about adding Harry into the lessons.”
Crowley laughed at that and nodded, ruffling the boy's unruly hair with a soft grin. "That's right kid. Go on now. Tell your Ba, bye. We'll see you when we get to the school."
He did not wait for a reply before turning to usher Crowley and the child out the door, ignoring any shouting and sputtering Vernon followed him with. If Crowley shut the door on the man's face, sending him reeling back, then Aziraphale didn't bat an eye.
Narcissa shook her head and straightened out a wrinkle in her skirt. “Yes, because I’m sure they’ll do the boy justice with the entire ministry in Dumbledore’s pocket.”
His partner shrugged, pulling off his apron as he walked over to sit on the arm of the chair. "I dunno angel. His birthday technically isn't for a few more hours."
So Crowley couldn't help but laugh when they were watching the telly days later and saw reruns of the news article showing a missing snake and a cage with no glass to be found.
A sob escaped the boy’s lips as the tears started tracing down his cheeks, his small hands scrubbing desperately to hide the overflow of emotion he was no doubt feeling. But he nodded his head anyway as he threw himself into Severus’ arms, his tiny body shaking with the force of his sobs.
He watched as the photo moved, Lily smiling at whoever had taken it- Potter no doubt- and shifting enough for that tiny face to come into view.
“We are going to fetch him now,” Lucius said when Severus didn’t respond, moving to stand and bowing his head slightly to the goblin. “We appreciate your help Master Griphook and would further appreciate your discretion as this matter unfolds.”
Petunia lead them to a hall just outside of the living area before pausing, hands reaching for a key in her pocket. Something wicked and sick twisted in Crowley's stomach as they drew closer, only growing more and more angry as she pulled a small cupboard door open under the stairs to reveal a basinet. Harry was laid inside it, cuddled into a ratted blanket, brown hair incredibly messy and a wicked Lichtenberg scar  splicing down his forehead and face.
It has come to our attention that you've taken young Mr. Potter out of his protected home with Mr. and Mrs. Dursley. I hope you understand how much of a surprise this is, though personally I'll tell you that I think it was a wonderful decision for you and your partner. I admit that leaving the young boy with that awful family did not sit well with me, however at the time there was no safer choice for us. I am unsure of how much you know about the Potter's situation, and even more unsure of how you came about the knowledge of Harry, but it is quite a dangerous one. I have the utmost confidence that you and your partner will be the safest place for him right now, and I'll be sure to let Albus know as well, though I could not imagine he would argue with me.
Crowley sighed heavily, slumping onto the ground with his back against the back of the couch. He ran a hand over his face, trying to calm his frantic heart.
Harry pouted but after a moment he shrugged. "That's okay. I can wait. This is going to be so awesome! Oh, but- you guys can't go..."
Hermione smacked him in the arm but Harry just laughed and shrugged. "Sometimes, sometimes he's a girl, and sometimes he's neither. I just call him Mum, always have. He's a professor again, and my Ba is a professor too! They're in the teacher car though."
“The circumstances leading to the Potter’s death was… complicated as I’m sure you know, Lord Malfoy,” Griphook sneered, though not necessarily at the blonde, simply at the situation. “At the time, Head Warlock Albus Dumbledore took complete control over the proceedings. For the young mister Potter’s – nee Prince’s –safety, he saw to it that the boy was hidden away from prying eyes and the Ministry agreed. We goblins were not privy to any information further than that, but the wills were left in the vault and Dumbledore was named Magical Guardian.”
Sirius Black, or whatever remained of him at least, grabbed Crowley's hand tight and swallowed. It was clear he was in pain, but there was a crazed sort of look in his eyes that made Crowley worry. And he didn't worry often.
” Confusion slipped into the boy’s face, his nose scrunching up and his head tilting slightly before he pointed the hallway, signing ‘home’ again in question. But Severus only shook his head. “
Lucius hummed, nodding his head in agreement. “Lily Potter would be rolling over in her grave if she knew. Severus,” her husband waited patiently as their friend struggled to collect himself again, waited until he pulled away from Narcissa and turned his gaze to the man, “I cannot begin to understand how difficult this must be for you, but you must decide what your next course of action is.”
Now, it'd been quite a long time since Crowley had been summoned. Properly summoned. In fact, he had erased his sigil from all written demon texts after the apocalypse that wasn't for this very reason. In fact, only five people knew it by heart: Aziraphale, Warlock, Adam, Ananthema, and a friend he hadn't heard from in over a decade.
Harry frowned, a blush decorating his cheeks at the praise and he raised a hand towards the lichenberg figure tracing down his face. "Uh- it's Fell now, actually, Potter-Fell, but my dads said I can just use Fell at school. And- and I'm not a legend! I'm just Harry," he answered, shaking a head.
It sounded a bit grim to Crowley, dreadfully boring, but the Dursley's perked up at the promise and Petunia sighed, nodding slightly. "Very well. It may take me a few moments to gather his things if you'd like to wait?"
Crowley's grin told him everything he needed to know and Aziraphale sighed, fighting back his own smile. "Oh Crowley. You're absolutely hopeless, you know."
“We’re going shopping tomorrow,” Draco said once the potion’s master finished, looking eager to join the conversation. “We can get you books for your shelves and decorations or something. I’ll show you my room too! I have posters of all the great quidditch teams and father gave me his old Slytherin banner to hang on my wall! We’ll get you all kinds of things-“
“Which is why we are going to keep everything confidential for as long as we can,” Lucius said meaningfully. “Dumbledore of course will need to know eventually and there will be no hiding it when the investigation gets far enough to confront him, however I’d like to keep him out of it until we are certain Severus has complete custody over the boy. We don’t want any chance that he’ll take Harry and put him back with that dreadful family.” Narcissa seemed pleased with that information and her husband nodded in understanding. “For now, Severus, is there anyone at Hogwarts you trust enough to bring in?”
"Right. Forgot how fucking awful that is." He straightened his jacket and kicked at the sigil, his foot bouncing off the invisible wall with a soft thud. "Wonderful. Hellooooo? Anyone alive in here?"
His father’s hand on his shoulder had Draco pausing, Harry still trying to catch up on Severus’ translations. After a brief pause, Lucius smiled softly and tugged Draco back a step. “I’m sure this is all very exciting, Draco, but perhaps we should let Harry rest now. It’s been a busy day and we have a lot to do tomorrow. Come, off to bed with you both.”
"Well, it has been quite a while since we've been in Scotland. And your mum taught at Hogwarts when James was your age. So we had a talk with Dumbledore."
Tell the young Mr. Potter-Fell happy birthday and that I loved the letter he wrote me last week, and thank your partner for me in translating what it said. You would think since I teach children I would understand their scribbling. But alas, in that regards I am useless. I've enclosed a reply if you'd be so kind to deliver it to the boy. I've also included a gift for his birthday, from both me and Albus.
Draco Lucius Malfoy liked to consider himself the perfect example of what a pureblooded heir should look and act like. He was poised, polite, and pretty, just like his mother. But he was also incredibly quick and well learned like his father. Even Uncle Severus often told him he was particularly exceptional in potions crafting for a boy his age. No doubt he’d be top of his classes once he got to Hogwarts.
So to say he was surprised to be ripped away from the bookshop and tossed into a dank looking prison cell that smelled like death was an understatement.
” Severus explained, waving a hand slowly towards one of the bruises quickly fading on Harry’s cheek. Narcissa had given him a quick look over before leaving them just to make sure he wasn’t hiding any terrible injuries and had cast a few small healing spells to hurry his bruises along, but she was no mediwitch and could only do so much outside of an official setting without the ministry finding out. “
The hall was huge, with four long tables taking up the main floor and another long table at the front on a sort of dias where the teachers were sat. Candles floated above them all, bobbing softly in the air and putting off no heat in the perfectly temperatured room. All the first years, Harry included, were staring in awe around the room. Until he saw his parents at the front.
Severus tensed at that, eyes narrowing at the goblin. “Magical Guardian? The wills should have been read and he should have been placed with whoever was named his godparents. As magical guardian, he’s had power over the heir seats by proxy and any of the vaults, right?”
"Someone I met when I was frolicking around that school in the Highlands, you remember. I got bored and posed as a teacher for a while." The angel nodded along and Crowley sighed. "There were some students there, a wiley bunch. They were practically wicked, angel. You'd have absolutely loved them. Always in my detention for some prank or another. I kept good friends with them when they graduated."
And then he'd remembered how much he cared about Warlock and how much he missed the boy. He'd never admit it, though he was sure Aziraphale knew, but he did love the boy. He cared about him. Hell, he'd raised the boy more than his own mother had. Aziraphale always said Crowley would be a great parent, but he'd never believed him.
Harry nodded, snuggling down under the covers, more content than he’d been in… well ever, he figured. He grunted when the lights turned off, drawing his father’s attention just before the door shut.
Crowley and Aziraphale sat towards the end of the long front table, almost comically opposite as usual. Aziraphale sat very straight and proper, his usual creme waist coat now covered with an equally tan robe fitted over it. He even had a creme, pointed hat on his head that he looked very proud of as he adjusted it. Crowley too had stuck to something close to his regular attire: black leather pants, a black, skin tight tunic with fishnet sleeves, all with a thick black cloak draped over his shoulders. He didn't have a hat on, instead wearing his hair half up and half down, glasses still fit snugly over his eyes.
"With rules," Aziraphale reminded him. "We will need to practice your flying, and you are not to jump from anything anymore. Understood?"
for. He could perhaps list on only three fingers the amount of people who had ever seen him so much as
Harry stared at him for a while, then down at his hands before looking up at Severus who translated quickly what he said, a look of amusement twitching at his lips. Harry pointed to Draco’s hands and frowned
Fighting down a smile, Crowley followed close behind, nodding as he  rapped a sharp knuckle on the door. "Course, angel."
The brunette couldn't help but glance back towards Malfoy, their eyes meeting for just a moment in curiosity. Harry gave him a friendly smile, but Malfoy didn't return it. He glanced towards his friends, then back at Harry before giving the smallest of nods.
I did make a small change since the first chapter (and updated the first chapter) so that anything being said in sign language is italicized! Hopefully it makes it a little easier to read. That being said, if it ever gets too confusing, please let me know and I'll try and figure something else out!
His friend bobbed his head and waved a hand. “Latricia Horntail has been Draco’s tutor since he was an infant. She’ll no doubt be able to catch Harry up in time for Hogwarts. And Draco will help, I’m sure of it.”
The playful tone turned sharp almost instantly and Aziraphale turned to follow the demon's gaze, only to find Harry had climbed up on top of one of Aziraphale's living area bookshelves. He giggled down at them, his broom proudly in hand as Crowley leapt to his feet, heart in his throat.
how his cold exterior he was usually so proud of cracked at that. For a moment he was glad the boy couldn’t hear the borderline whine that escaped his throat, and he was immensely glad that Lucius was gracious enough to ignore it as well. Not that his friend appeared to be taking much stock in the conversation at hand anymore. Of course, Severus was sure he was
Narcissa frowned, glancing back at her husband who had moved to take a seat on the nearby couch, his hand spread over his mouth as he read the letters in his hands. “What is it? What’s happened?”
He was quickly ushered to the table with the rest of his friends and introduced to Ron's older brothers, the boy from the train with a toad, and a boy with a thick, lilting Irish accent that talked faster than Harry could keep up. Even after the room had settled down enough to get through the rest of the ceremony, Harry couldn't hide his bright grin.
A few more people went after that. A scared looking boy clutching a toad who got put in Gryffindor. An adorable blonde with funny glasses that got sorted into Ravenclaw. And then there was the blonde boy - Draco Malfoy, as the professor called.
"Oh Crowley my dear! You had me so worried, just up and disappearing like that! Oh I thought- well I thought-" He fussed with his vest until Crowley stood and took those soft hands in his own and watched as the angel slumped slightly. "I thought hell had taken you again. It was- it was a summoning yes? I did not think many knew of your sigils."
Crowley shrugged, unconcerned. "Dumbledore doesn't tell me what to do." There was a long silence after that as they sat through a few more students. After a while, Crowley sighed and looked over at the potions master again. "Say what you want, Severus. You know I hate it when you brood."
Draco nodded excitedly, smiling big as his uncle got Harry’s attention to translate what Narcissa had said. Just before the silver-haired boy could turn towards the table however, Severus put a hand on his shoulder and gave the boy a grateful smile.
“He’ll no doubt be behind Draco,” Severus commented with a frown. “I’m sure Petunia let him go to school so she didn’t get in trouble, but I have my doubts that she allowed him help on his studies. Not to mention he’ll have no knowledge whatsoever on wizarding subjects.”
After a moment of hesitation, Crowley plucked the boy off the broom and pulled him into a hug. Harry returned it, his little arms wrapping too-tight around Crowley's neck, though he'd never complain. "No, little one, mum isn't sad. You've only scared us is all."
It's lovely to hear from you again. I know with Harry staying with Adam and you and Aziraphale taking your trip, it's been a while since we've written. I am happy to hear that Harry received his letter in such high spirits. I know he, like most children his age, have been looking forward to getting it. As requested, we've set aside a shared apartment in the teachers quarters for you and Mr. Fell to stay during the school year, however Mr. Potter-Fell will need to stay in the dorms with his classmates, same as the rest of the children. Your classrooms have also been set up as requested, though you will have three days to settle in after you arrive on the train with the students. Feel free to change up whatever you wish.
Something soft flittered around in the demon's chest and he smirked, nodding. "Yeah angel, I heard."
After a many more thanks from Harry to the Malfoy’s, he was left alone in his room with his own father, wearing a pair of Draco’s pajamas that had to be rolled up at the bottom so he didn’t trip. He was sat on his bed, Mr. Prince- his
with it- standing in the middle of an ugly, muggle living room dressed in nothing but rags, gave him a warm, protective sort of feeling that he hadn’t felt since Lily Evans.
Harry had never had a friend before. Dudley hated him and his friends always chased him around for Harry Hunting, and since he couldn’t hear no one at school wanted to talk to him. The closest he’d gotten to a friend was Miss Harendale at the library. She always gave him snacks when he hid there after school and she was the one to tell him about the sign language classes twice a month. She’d even signed the permission slip for him to join because she somehow knew Aunt Petunia wouldn’t.
so Severus didn’t bother even knocking, instead pressing the button beneath the sign. Instead of the
After a moment, the boy squeaked and shut the door, only to open it again and hold up a hand to them as if to tell them to stay. The men nodded in agreement, sharing a glance with each other as they waited. There was a loud shuffling behind the door, the sound of a chain clanking against the door and some more shuffling. Seconds later, the door was pulled open completely to reveal the small boy, huffing and puffing like he’d been running around. He pushed a small step stool out of the way- no doubt used to help him reach the chain- and rushed up towards Severus, holding up a photo and pointing at it and giving a soft, “ah?”
"He's not," Sirius hissed, pulling Crowley down by his wrist so they were at eye level with each other. "You must, Crowley. This is my favor. This is what I ask of you. You must do it."
Draco laughed before pointing to Harry’s eyes. The other boy grinned in understanding before signing “
I do hope you are doing well my dear. I wanted to thank you ever so much for lending me the books I asked for. I never was able to convince Albus to let me into your restricted section of the library, then again, I wasn't strictly a teacher either, was I? The books you provided on raising magical children also helped exponentially and I could not thank you enough for them. As you are aware, Crowley and I's 'magic' is very different than your own, so trying to teach him how to control his own powers has proven... rather interesting. It is very different than young Adam, you see.
"Yeah well... maybe pay more attention next time," he said, but there was no heat in his words as he adjusted his robes.
Harry had even been polite and asked the snake's name, turning a bit sad when the serpent said he was never given one.
Harry’s eyes brightened immediately and he gasped, bouncing on his feet a few times as he nodded frantically.
In regards to young Mr. Harry's sudden flight, please do not be alarmed and do not fret about the Ministry. While it is not uncommon for children to begin showing their magic abilities early, most do not have such control until later when they've had a bit of schooling. The more pureblooded families begin tutoring early, though for the families living in the muggle world, I'm sure you know of our rule against children using magic outside of Hogwarts. Still, with you and Mr. Fell being who you are, I do not see an issue with young Harry learning early, as long as you are careful with what he does in the presence of muggles. I'm not sure the Ministry would be as forgiving as we are if they found out.
After dinner the boys were led upstairs, Draco practically dragging Harry by the hand until they reached a long hallway of doors where they all stopped. Draco pointed towards one door with a little snake engraved on its face and carefully spelling out, “
“She is writing to tell Severus of Hadrian’s true parentage and that she’s left some documents with the goblins in case anything happens to her and Potter. The boy has written, claiming he too received a letter telling him about Severus.” Lucius frowned down at the dirty page, surprisingly unbothered to touch it as he re-read the words. “He writes that his mother told him to contact Severus if he ever needed help and-“
Severus nodded and took a deep, deep breath. She could feel him tensing, shifting, breathing… collecting himself enough to pull away from her. He didn’t go far, and he didn’t complain when he’d finally straightened up slightly and Narcissa had taken his hands in hers. He looked exhausted, a little bit broken, and completely and utterly lost. “Petunia hated magic. She was always jealous of Lily for being born a witch. Lily didn’t speak more than a handful of words to her sister after receiving her Hogwarts letter. I cannot- Albus
Narcissa chuckled, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder to keep him from literally bouncing in his spot. “I heard, darling. I think it suits you well. It’s a pleasure to have you in our home Harry,” she greeted the boy, waiting until Severus finished translating to bow her head and show her hands. “I am Narcissa Malfoy, mistress of this home and mother of Draco. I hope you will feel at home here with us.”
His new friend leaned back to glance in the direction Harry was nodding and a vicious sneer twisted across his features. He scoffed and crossed his arms as he straightened back up. "That's Malfoy," he said, the name like acid on his tongue and it made Harry frown. "Comes from a family of purebloods, he does. His da is always trying to get mine in trouble or fired for something or another. He's a right git and no one can convince me otherwise."
There was a long wait as Harry thought hard on the prospect, weighing the pros and cons of each house- or what he knew of them at least. He knew his parents would be proud no matter what he chose. After a few more seconds, he took a deep breath and made a decision.
?” Severus signed, though he spoke aloud for Lucius’ sake since he knew his friend wouldn’t understand him otherwise.
Some things I totally forgot to mention in my haste to upload the first two chapters. First, of all, I know the story of Good Omens happened more recently than Harry Potter, HOWEVER, that doesn't jive with me. SO, we're pretending Adam is older and the whole apocalypse that wasn't happened before Harry was born. Because it fits better with my Narrative.
"James and Lily," Sirius choked, tears once again welling up in his eyes. Something violent shook through the wizard and his head shot up, eyes finding the door to the cell. "I don't have time. You have to promise me, Anthony," he said, turning back towards the demon with desperation in his eyes. "James and Lily, they're gone. They're gone and Harry has no one left," he choked, fingers gripping tight enough to bruise if Crowley was human. "I heard- I heard they've sent Harry off to his aunt's but- but they're cruel people, Anthony, absolutely horrid. You have to- you have to get him. You have to take care of him, until he's old enough. Please."
“I-“ Severus paused, swallowing around the lump in his throat and gazing at them both gratefully. He squeezed Narcissa’s fingers softly before taking another deep breath. “I cannot take him to Hogwarts with me, and Spinner’s End is no place for a child-“
"By mum! By Ba!" Harry called as he rushed towards the train, his travel case in hand and a smile on his face. He was eager to get on and find somewhere to sit, determined to make friends so his parents wouldn't worry anymore-
"You don't think they're being mean to him do you," Aziraphale questioned, twisting a piece of paper in his lap nervously as he glanced out the window of their room in the teacher's car.
“We are aware of the unusual circumstances surrounding the situation,” Griphook was saying when Severus slipped everything back into the file and glanced up at the goblin, “but we request you return as soon as possible with the Potter heir as to read the wills. They have been sitting sealed for far too long.”
Aziraphale pouted, slumping slightly in his chair before nodding. "Yes, yes I'm sure you're right. Still... perhaps I should go check, just in case."
Still, the boy with the white hair only spared him a glance once his friends pointed in Harry's direction, apparently deigning their interaction earlier that day enough for him. He said something to the both of them, but Harry  couldn't hear what it was.
"At the time I was teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, angel. The kids had to know how to expect the unexpected, so they say." His grin told the angel otherwise however, but he didn't bring it up. "Besides, it's a fun surprise for the first years, and as they get older they'll get used to the patterns. Most of the Ravenclaws figure it out within their first week. Stop fretting so much."
Crowley could feel the angel's pout from across the table. "Yes but from what I've read, most children are able to say very basic sounds and words before they're a year old. Harry is nearly two already."
He glared at the blonde when Lucius laughed. “No one is ever truly ready for parenthood, Severus,” he said wisely, patting the dark haired man’s shoulder before letting it drop to his side, “and yet we forge on because we love them regardless.”
The words choked off and the woman reached up to pull him back into her arms, glancing back at her husband. “Well then? What does it say?”
Eventually they made it to the back of the book where Draco knew the clubs and event photos were held. He showed Harry the photos of his own parents in the Defense Against the Dark Arts Club, and a photo of Uncle Severus toiling over a classroom of various potions. He showed off the many,
Without further ado, Mrs. Malfoy pushed the door open to reveal a room bigger than the Dursley’s whole living room! The walls were a simple crème with pretty silver designs at the top of them, and there was a big four poster bed draped in blacks and greens sitting diagonally in one of the corners. There was a desk and a dresser pushed up against the walls, and a few bookshelves in one corner with a chair, though the shelves were all empty. At the end of the bed was something he remembered his aunt calling a ‘fainting couch’, and there was a window on the back wall that stuck out just enough for a bench to fit up against it to sit on. Harry could just barely see the hint of a garden and maybe a lake in the darkness.
Harry opened his eyes. The sun was warm on his face — it was later than he’d expected. He’d slept in. He smiled into the pillow as he felt Draco move behind him. He pretended he was still asleep, and after a moment, he felt Draco’s chest press against his back, Draco’s arms moving around him, warm breath on the back of his neck.
The man had looked at him like he might be terribly dangerous. Perhaps he looked dangerous. His hair was worryingly long and straggly. He hadn’t made any attempt to do anything but keep it clean since he’d fallen asleep months before. Harry had never known that past a certain length his own hair could begin to curl at the ends. He liked it. It wasn’t practical. It was no less messy than it had ever been but he didn’t feel compelled to make it behave, anymore.
Longbottom had steered Potter to his seat, which was of course beside Draco’s. He’d have liked to pretend it was Minerva interfering, but as he’d been seated beside the previous Defence Professor for the last two years he had to assume it was tradition. Minerva certainly wouldn’t try to bait them into a duel on the night of the Great Feast, surely.
“I thought your imagination had rather a lot going for it, actually,” Draco replied. He looked like he might melt; his pale cheeks were stained with a bright flush, his mouth was red and kiss-swollen, and he was looking at Harry like he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.
“That was a lovely speech,” Harry said, after a long moment, pretending his mouth wasn’t dry and his muscles hadn’t tightened across his entire body. “Do you have a point?”
“Kreacher,” Draco repeated, frowning. “Oh, Kreacher? He’s still there, in Grimmauld Place? He’s about three hundred years old, Harry, he’ll think you’re trying to force him into retirement. Don’t torture the poor thing.”
“Bonnie,” Harry said, because Draco was right, and he was feeling much too cheerful and extremely pleased with himself. “How are you enjoying being Head of House?”
“Oh, don’t even joke about that. I wouldn’t change my name again under the Imperius curse. Now, stop trying to get a rise out of me, and kiss me properly.”
Molly’s reply came less than an hour later. Her handwriting was shaky, but she assured Harry that if he trusted Draco then she would be happy to offer her hospitality. Harry was quite sure that the moment she saw how thin Draco was she’d be fussing over him like he was one of her own brood. Hermione replied shortly afterwards with a declaration that it was a wonderful idea.
legs if anyone so much as breathed on him wrong, or let slip to any of the much younger and stupider staff around the hospital that the famous Harry Potter was under their roof. He gave Rubino a long list of instructions, so long in fact that Rubino had gazed at Draco with hearts in his eyes for a full five seconds before he disappeared into the fireplace looking as much vindicated as cheered. Perhaps he had been bored.
The pain went far beyond the heat of it. Draco couldn’t figure out why, and anyway, he was trying to maintain what was currently passing for poise. Which was hard since he was seeing at least double, and every nerve in his body was tight as a violin string, shrieking for attention. He wanted to shout, yell, scream, perhaps cry.
Strangely enough, it was Ron who cast the deciding vote. “He wanted you to read it, or he wouldn’t have said it wasn’t sealed. The pointy git might be a… pointy git, but if he wanted you to know… whatever that is, then I think you should read it. Otherwise, it’s like throwing it back in his face, innit?”
“And I thought you might ask Ginny. If there’s something terrible. Something she remembers. Maybe something he never told us.”
, and the promise was evident in every syllable. “I swear, Malfoy. If you mean it — I’ll help. But it’s going to be hard. You’re going to be scared.”
“Draco Malfoy’s rooms,” he muttered, and he found his way to bed, and didn’t even bother to take off his robes.
“When you put it like that,” Draco replied, adjusting Harry’s robes before moving to his own. “Yes. And it’s not nonsense, Potter. Your Weasleys have their own traditions. I bet your Muggle relatives do, too, and Granger. Traditions are nice. But we don’t have to worry about those right now. You’ll sit by me for supper where I can poke you in the ribs if you seem likely to say anything too ridiculous.” His face softened. Harry’s expression was part determination and part exhausted resignation, but he looked like he was prepared to try, and that needed to be enough for today. “Don’t worry about the rest. We have plenty of time.”
Later that evening, Draco brought a small desk into Potter’s room. He opened out the map that Granger and —
“I need to apologise to him, as well. I didn’t know — I didn’t realise — that the party was for courting. I hope the rest of his night passed more pleasantly. I am sure that any young woman in the Wizarding world would be delighted to make that match.”
Harry relaxed slightly. “Yes,” he said. “Mr Black, then. I’m very pleased to make your acquaintance. Shall we?”
“Behaving? Predictable? Yes. Strong, and… and I’m having fun with it, in a way I don’t think I have since I was about thirteen years old. I love magic. I forgot that, for years — not many people could possibly understand that, but I know you do. Because when we found out we
Harry took the paper out of her hands. It was less than a week since Harry had spoken at Narcissa and Malfoy’s trials. Five days since Malfoy had been cleared of charges and Narcissa had received a sentence of one year in Azkaban, rather than the ten she had been promised; Harry had told the Wizengamot that she was the reason he had made it back to the castle alive, something they clearly hadn’t wanted to hear about, as they had changed the time and location of her trial and Malfoy’s several times in an effort to prevent him from testifying. Four days since Lucius had been transferred to Azkaban to live out his days there.
Naked, with his long, proud cock curving towards his stomach, Draco was beyond beautiful. His lips were softly swollen from kisses and he put himself up on one elbow as Harry discarded the last of his own clothes.
“The first is this. No one thinks you have time for any kind of secret life, because they cannot fathom that you spend any of your spare time not looking for their company. But despite the appalling hours that you work and your general exhaustion, you do have time to yourself that you don’t spend building homes for orphans and campaigning for the rights of Hippogriffs. And when you have time — you travel.”
“Oh nonsense,” Narcissa interrupted with a scoff. “You practically live here anyway, Severus, darling. We have plenty of room for both you and the boy, you may stay as long as you both need to. Even longer if you wish. Besides,” she said with a smile, “it might do good for Draco to be here to help soothe him in a new environment. I’m sure if our suspicions are correct about how he is treated, he may not trust adults very well. I will speak with Draco about it while you two are gone, make sure he is fully aware of his duties in welcoming the boy.”
"I do not mind, young master," another voice hissed, surprising the demon. "I appreciate you saving me from that place."
It reminded him of the lack of photos they’d seen in Petunia’s house. The lack of any sign that Harry even lived there other than the light above the door and the…
“We’ll take Draco with us,” the woman decided with a nod. “I only planned to take him on the shopping portion, but it might be easier for him if someone his age is there to help him understand, and I think Draco will do well to keep the boy calm. They might not let him in with you in Gringotts, but I’m sure Harry would appreciate the company at the healers and Diagon Alley. Luckily, with it being in the middle of the week, the crowds should be thin. And what of Hogwarts? Surely they’ll find out eventually that the boy is staying with us. Dumbledore will no doubt be furious.”
As Mr. Crowley was a previous employee of us, it is an easy thing to return him to his position here at Hogwarts if he wishes to take it. I am sad to say however that the Defense Against the Dark Arts position he had previously is taken, however Professor Sprout is eager to go into an early retirement. I suspect it is due to her fondness of Mr. Crowley after his many years here, and the fact that her wife wishes to travel throughout their elder years. So she was happy to give him her position if he is amendable.
“He’s with his aunt,” Severus croaked, fists clenching in his lap. “He’s with that wretched woman and her horrid husband.”
The demon frowned, glancing around the room they were in before his eyes fell on their joined hands. He'd seen wizards do their unbreakable promise things. They didn't work on angels and demons necessarily, but the fact that Sirius was about to enact one meant it was- no pun intended- serious.
"And yet I am. And let me remind you of something, Severus Snape," the demon growled, leaning towards the wizard and letting his glasses slip just enough for the man to see his serpent eyes. "Harry is
The boy looked to be thinking for a few moments before he turned to Draco. With a determined expression on his face, he touched one finger to his ear and brought the hand down into a fist, before moving it towards his mouth and wiggling his fingers outwards. It looked absolutely ridiculous to Draco and he couldn’t even begin to understand what it meant, but his uncle looked pleased so he didn’t imagine it was awful. “Well?”
But his mother was patient with the questions and smiled at him when she stood fully. “We aren’t quite sure the truth of the whole matter yet, but rest assured your father will find out. All we know is that the boy is Severus’ and Lily Potter had kept it a secret from everyone but James Potter and Sirius Black. We don’t believe even Dumbledore knew.”
Severus hummed in agreement, his eyes drawn back to both boys and watching them as Harry taught him a few signs after writing their meanings down and then pointing towards the yearbook. “I am grateful he is here,” the potion’s master said quietly, relief evident in his slouched shoulders and his soft gaze. “The boy was so eager to leave, I’m not sure he’s ever even had friends before, and Petunia’s boy was no doubt as horrid as she is. I’m sure it’s not going to be this easy always, and we’ll have our struggles, but I-“ he paused to take a deep breath, glancing up at his two best friends and smiling. “I am forever grateful that you are all here with me.”
Sirius never left Harry's side and became extremely protective of the boy. Much to Crowley's delight. He'd agreed that his size was a comfortable one, easier to get around with, and allowed Harry to keep him as such. He became a bit of a support animal for the boy, curling up on his chest when the nightmares grew bad and resting heavy on his shoulders when his emotions or anxiety weighed too much on the young boy.
Crowley frowned, turning at the familiar voice and glancing down at the lump of fabric near the edge of the circle. Upon closer inspection, it was definitely a person, though their hair was matted and their face covered in grime and dried tears. The demon frowned, crouching as close to him as the circle allowed.
He couldn't help but jump slightly as the hat touched his unruly hair. He knew that it would talk, he'd seen it talk to the other students, but hearing it was a different matter, and his fingers clenched around the wood of his stool.
Sirius smiled, the expression a bit wobbly as he nodded, head resting on their clasped hands. "It is enough. Thank you Crowley. Thank you."
"You have freed me, given me a chance at something better. I think it only polite for you to choose. I have no preference either way, young master."
So when Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were informed by their house elf that their closest friend was collapsed in the east seating room, absolutely distraught, they didn’t hesitate to spring into action.
I do expect that you and Mr. Crowley will not give young Harry any special treatment in his classes, and will hold him to the same standards as the rest of your students.
So naturally, when his mother told him she had a very important job for him, he immediately latched onto her words, taking each one incredibly seriously.
Crowley sighed again, stepping into the room and sitting on the bed next to Harry. He reached under the pillow slowly, ignoring Harrys protests, and pulled the snake out. He was much smaller than before, though still large enough to curl around the demons full arm and then some. "Hullo, I'm sorry my son stole you, but I'm afraid he can't keep you."
"Ah! There's my boy! Go on, you've got it," Aziraphale cheered, nodding eagerly to the boy. "Go on, say Papa."
They only had to wait a few moments before a small figure skidded into view behind the foggy glass, his features blurred as he stumbled forward. A few clicks sounded and a second later the door was being tugged open slightly, a chain higher up keeping it from opening completely.
Crowley reeled back slightly, eyes wide in shock. "Take care of him? Sirius, you cannot be- well serious! I cannot take care of a child! He's better off where he is-"
Number 4 Privet Drive was… disgustingly normal. It looked identical to the other houses on the street and had absolutely nothing about it that was even remotely unique save for the number 4 painted on the mailbox. There was no car in the driveway, though Severus didn’t expect one as Petunia and her disgusting husband were no doubt still on whatever trip they’d decided to take, and all the lights in the windows were dark save for the one in the front room.
But Severus was determined and seeing this little boy- looking so much like his mother that the old man’s heart
“I am aware of how late it is,” Lucius frowned, glancing towards the grandfather clock in the corner of the room, “but it would be best if we visited Gringotts as soon as possible. I know you wish to retrieve the boy now, but without verifying your identity and relation to him through an inheritance test, I’m afraid it would be considered kidnapping. If we leave now, we can fetch the boy in less than two hours, I expect.”
“Nothing to eat,” Narcissa demanded, surprised at how loud her voice became as she tried to hold back a shriek. “The boy is ten years old! How do they expect him to fend for himself at home for a fortnight with
Anyway, you'll probably hear from me a lot in the future. The angel and I aren't really up to date on Wizard stuff, and you know we aren't ones ourselves. Regardless, Harry is taking the move wonderfully. We've moved into a small cottage in Tadfield near some friends. You can write to us there. Feel free to visit if you like, though Aziraphale usually appreciates a heads up before receiving guests.
"We'll need some sort of compensation," Vernon said sternly, crossing his arms over his chest. "You've dropped a child on us after just having our own. We have spent money on the boy already, added him to our insurance, given him a room-"
"Mmmm," Harry grumbled, sounding almost contemplative if he wasn't barely under two. Crowley let him think, ever patient for whatever wisdom the child would bestow upon him, until finally Harry let out a very serious, "Muh!"
Also a note, don't worry about the backstory with Lily and Severus and timelines and such. I'll explain things as the story goes along, but for now just go with the flow! (Though I will be changing up a few things from the canon obviously to better fit my story.)
Lucius hummed, nodding. “Safe seems to be a loose term for it.” He turned the piece of muggle parchment towards her, this one a dirty white with little blue lines across it. The words were written messily with some sort of muggle device, some crossed out like the writer tried to reword things or had spelled something incorrectly. She couldn’t read it from her place before Severus, but she could see the large “Mr. Harry Potter” scribbled at the bottom of the page.
“There is no time, Cissy,” her husband replied sharply, narrowing his eyes at her before turning back towards the potions master. “The boy has asked for help. You must decide if you will give it, and if you do, what the ramifications of those actions will be.”
Harry stared at the card, watching in fascination as the picture shifted and moved as if the man on the front of it was real.
He knew he was, it was incredibly obvious, but the boy didn’t react to either of their requests and it made something anxious and worried knot in Severus’ stomach.
. He was used to being poised, hardened. He hid his emotions behind a wall of Occlumency that even Dumbledore had never managed to break through.
Harry looked at the options with wide eyes and frowned. "I've never had any of these. I've only had muggle candies. Could I have one of each? But two of the frogs?" The woman laughed and nodded, unloading one of every treat into Harry and Ron's arms before accepting the coins Harry handed over to her.
and force us to raise one of your little monsters, and out of the kindness of our hearts, we accept, and now you've come here and assaulted us in our own home! I absolutely refuse to allow this any further! We have had enough of your-"
And the book! Harry had never gotten a gift before, only been given Dudley’s old clothes because Aunt Petunia didn’t want to buy him new ones or waste old ones. But now he had a book with pictures of his parents in it, all three of them! And Draco… Draco said he could
"Ah, a Potter, eh? Interesting. Been quite a while since I've had such a challenge in store. You're quite the pickle aren't you?" The hat asked, humming to itself. "You've got the power and the ambition for Slytherin, but the heart of a Gryffindor. Quite tricky. I'm sure you would excel in both houses no matter what I choose."
Harry's magic had been making little appearances here there ever since the broom incident. Nothing major, and nothing strong enough to draw the attention of the ministry, (though Aziraphale and Crowley had made sure they wouldn't notice even if it had been major enough.)
“I think it did,” Severus smiled, patting his shoulder once more before pulling away. “Harry knows how to write and read, so if you have trouble communicating with him, you may do it that way.”
Petunia sputtered, following the two beings further into the house. "I-I beg your pardon? You cannot simply walk into my home! Vernon! Vernon come down here this instant!"
He watched patiently as the potion’s master set the boy down, hands on his shoulders to keep him steady from the apparating until he was able to hold himself up. Then he crouched down and started speaking, his hands moving as he spoke.
"What is it, Petunia? I only just gotten Dudley to sleep and-" he stopped in the doorway, eyes landing on the two visitors before narrowing into a glare. "Who are you?"
"Yeah, there's all kinds of things a riley demon can get up to in that place, angel," he laughed. "The library is huge, you'll love it. There's a secret swimming pool somewhere on the fourth floor, or there used to be. It moves sometimes. There's a lot of ghosts that roam the halls, a polterguist, things like that. I wouldn't go too close to the lake, they've got mermaids in there, and not the super nice kind." He continued on for a while, explaining various parts of the castle to an eager-to-learn Aziraphale until the sky began to grow dark and the train lit up in soft, twinkling lights.
Crowley nodded, trying to hide the pain this situation brought him. He was a demon for badness sake, he should be mourning the lives of mortals. "The Potters are dead it seems, I'm not sure how. I haven't looked. Sirius Black, James' friend, was the one who summoned me," the demon sighed, slumping back against the couch like a particularly upset serpent.
The darker haired man grumbled and glared out over the heads of the many students. Not for the first time, Crowley wondered why he was a teacher if he appeared to hate children so much. Finally, he said, "I never expected you to come back here."
There was a long silence then, the Dursley's sharing a confused yet hopeful look that set Crowley's teeth on edge. He was glad he let Aziraphale take the lead here, or he'd have just snuck in and stolen the child away. Maybe left some nasty treats for the Dursley's to find the next morning.
“Yes of course,” the woman agreed, waving a hand. “I’ll see to him after dinner.” There was a brief pause where they all watched the boys, their faces softening when they saw Draco make a mockingly straight face that sent Harry into giggles. She smirked, turning to raise an eyebrow at her husband, knowing exactly what their son had shown the boy. Lucius dutifully ignored her however, and Narcissa chuckled. “Regardless, I’m sure there are other things to discuss, yes? What did Gringotts have to say? And the ministry?”
Oh the possibilities of Harry breaking every expectation the world had for him if he managed to sort into Slytherin.
In regards to our previous inquiry about Harry's school letter in the coming years, I know both Crowley and I had quite a lot of questions about what we should be prepared for when Harry turns eleven. I'm sure it's a lot of information, so I thought perhaps you might join us for a spot of tea sometime next week to discuss it. I am aware that Crowley and I are not muggles nor wizards, so we wanted to be sure what the rules are upon attending events, visiting Hogsmede, and so on. Crowley mentioned it wouldn't be an issue, as he was a teacher at Hogwarts for some time, however that was before anyone knew our true nature. I'd like to be sure of everything before hand, just in case.
His parents stood, Aziraphale with his chest puffed out slightly, giving a small bow, and Crowley with a lazy twist of a hand before he dropped back into his sprawl.
"Yes! That's very good, my dear boy! Your pronunciation is a bit off, but if that's what you wish to call me, who am I to object?" the angel laughed. Harry, perhaps not able to help himself, laughed in return, reacting perfectly to Aziraphale's praise. He batted at Aziraphale's lips again and again, yelling 'ba! ba!' to get the angel to laugh. "Do you hear, Crowley?"
"Oh, you didn't tell him to hit anyone did you? That would be a horrible first impression to the school, my dear," Aziraphale scolded, sighing as he saw Crowley's smirk. "Crowley! You know violence isn't the answer!"
Both angel and demon froze at the sound, neither sure they'd heard right. Crowley sat up straight on the couch, watching carefully as Aziraphale lifted Harry up. The boy waggled his feet and giggled as he stood on the angel's knees, fingers reaching eagerly for Aziraphale's curls.
“Remember, Draco Darling, that Harry grew up very different than you did. He was raised by muggles who treated him very terribly,” his mother was saying as she crouched before him, straightening his shirt collar. “He probably doesn’t know much, if anything, about magic and he will most certainly need a friend to help him in this new place. Do you understand?”
Harry shook his head, reaching for the snake. It went eagerly, wrapping almost protectively around Harry's shoulders like a scarf. "But mum, you said he was sad there! You said he was trapped! I couldn't- I just pictured you in there, stuck with people watching and watching but never offering to help." Crowley blinked down at the child, at his clenched fists and his stern face. "I couldn't leave him there! But- but you said I couldn't let him go because he'd die without someone to take care of him. So- so I figured- I thought-"
The boy frowned, glaring at Severus’ lips for a moment before grunting and grabbing at his hand. He tugged the potions master until the two men were following him into the house and living room, the door shutting behind them. Once he was satisfied with their destination, he snatched a notebook from the table and scribbled something on it before he all but shoved it in Severus’ face.
"I raised Warlock not to be the prince of hell, Sirius. It's hardly the same situation," still, Crowley sighed and nodded. "But I owe you a favor, and I owed James and Lilly one as well. If I do this for you, we consider all debts paid." Sirius was already nodding, tears leaking down his cheeks, but Crowley continued before his friend could thank him. "But I can't promise I'll do better. I will try," he quickly said, "Aziraphale, my angel, he's with me now. We- we'll try. But that is the most I can promise you, Sirius."
"That you could take care of him," the demon finished, shoulders slumping at the explanation. Damn, caught in his own words. Something in him twisted at his son's explanation, at the thought of him doing it because of Crowley, because he just wanted to help.
“Not quite,” Lucius answered with a frown. “He would technically hold the accounts by proxy, but would not be able to access anything other than the trust vault. However, if a true guardian came in such as a birth parent or a named godparent, then Dumbledore wouldn’t have access to
Ron's words were too slow however when Harry yelped, watching a frog appearing to be made of chocolate hop out of the box and onto the window. In only a matter of seconds it was leaping into the wind and gone.
He figured Harry must have known that already, since the boy didn’t bother even looking at his father for a translation, too awed at the picture even as he reached a finger out to touch it, stopping just before he came in contact with the parchment. He looked almost frightened for a moment but Draco didn’t say anything about it. He remembered his mother telling him to be patient with the other boy, so he was.
Ron watched the exchange in awe, never having seen that much money in his life, and Harry blushed again.
“The Potter boy?” Narcissa frowned, eyebrows tugging together. “What on Gaia could she have to say about him that would result in such a state? I thought Dumbledore had him locked away somewhere safe until he was meant to attend Hogwarts.”
Lily was just as beautiful as he remembered, her green eyes twinkling in the pale photo and her smile lighting up as she laughed. He could tell it was the day of the birth because her hair was tied up in a messy bun, her skin was flushed and damp, and she was dressed in St. Mugo’s maternity gown. Still, she was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen and he couldn’t help it when his heart lurched into his throat. In her arms was a tiny bundle wrapped in an emerald green cloth, a tuft of wild black curls just barely visible over the edge of the wrap.
"We had no where else to put him," Vernon argued loudly. "Our Dudley already has our baby room and your kind just dropped this one off without any warning!"
Harry nodded, his face screwing up in the same way it had when he'd been a baby and decided upon his parents names. "How about Sirius? Its my godfather's name. I've never met him, but mum says he's good and that he loved me very much. Also he was a super powerful wizard and is totally cool. But you have to stop calling me master, okay? It's just Harry."
"Why scared?" Harry asked, pulling back to watch Crowley's eyes with interest, like he was trying to pick him apart at the seams.
"You told me of the other one," Sirius argued, as if reading the man's thoughts. "The Warlock boy. You raised him, you can raise Harry."
Ron frowned, glaring at the snake as if trying to determine the truth for himself before he glanced up at Harry. "Can we pet him? Or is he like the dogs where you're not supposed to?"
Severus sighed and shook his head. “Not yet. I wanted him to settle just a bit before thrusting everything at him. I’ll explain it after dinner, though I’m not sure how much of it he will understand.”
Aziraphale shifted and sat beside them, a gentle smile on his face. "Most kids can't do what you do," he told the boy carefully. "We didn't know your magic would show up so young. So you scared us because we thought you might get hurt."
Severus sighed, rubbing a hand over his face and shaking his head. He couldn’t help but glance at the two boys on the other side of the room, his heart lurching at the way Harry was practically drinking in Draco’s attention, the way he was soaking up any information the boy could give him from the yearbook. Honestly it’d been a wonderful idea and he’d have to thank Draco more thoroughly some other time, perhaps with a gift of his own to show his appreciation at the boy’s thoughtfulness. Still, it saddened him a bit to see the boy so enthralled with photos of his own mother.
Lucius watched curiously through the glass, eyebrow raised as he turned to Severus who gave no answer.
"I'm Mr. Fell and this is my partner Mr. Crowley. Please sit, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, we have much to discuss," Aziraphale said, a forced politeness to his tone.
Relieved, Draco bobbed his head. “I’d like to learn your signing language though,” he assured his uncle. “If you’ll teach me?”
“Yes,” Narcissa hummed, glancing towards Harry with a curious look. “Well need to hide that while we’re out tomorrow, I’m sure. Probably best that no one see him out and about with us so close to Dumbledore’s nose. The goblins are trustworthy enough, but the random wizard on the street of the Alley is not. If anyone asks I’ll tell them he’s a cousin’s son and we are caring for him until further notice.”
"Angel, he'll do it when he's ready," Crowley grumbled from where he rested on the couch. Aziraphale was sat in the arm chair across from him, Harry propped up excitedly in his lap. They had only had the boy for a handful of months, but the angel had taken to him splendidly and Harry seemed all too comfortable with the both of them. As if there was no other option. Which, he supposed there wasn't really.
It had been merely a decade since he'd seen the wizard, though they'd spoken briefly when he got the baby announcement for the potter boy months ago. Still, to see an old friend in such a state brought worry to Crowley's shriveled heart.
"The Potters," Aziraphale nodded, remembering. "We sent them a bassinet a while ago yes? For their little one?"
"Yes, and I'm not happy about that," Aziraphale huffed, straightening his shoulders and glaring out the window.
Crowley couldn't help but smile, patting the angel's knee before laying back down and relaxing. "He'll be alright, angel. Trust him."
Harry groaned, dropping his head back in complaint as Crowley adjusted his coat for the twelfth time since they'd gotten to Platform 9 3/4. "Mum, you'll be on the same train!"
In the end, Harry only managed to find one cart that wasn't already filled to the brim with excited students, this one held one boy and what looked like a pet rat on his lap. The boy looked a bit scruffy, with messy red hair and some dirt on his nose. Freckles looked like they'd exploded all over his face and his smile was a bit crooked when he turned towards Harry.
Aziraphale sputtered again and shook his head. "We can't darling. He was born here. If we let him out, he'll only get caught again or he won't be able to survive on his own. Come now, let's go."
shocked, had been since he first laid eyes on the boy, at how much he looked like him. After so long of thinking the boy was Potter’s, of imagining a tiny boy with dark brown hair and a wicked smirk, cocky and spoiled in whatever pampered home Albus had put him in… it was hard to look at this skinny boy with broken glasses and damaged ears, with black wild curls and little button nose, and see the same child he’d imagined for so long. And what would he look like as he grew older? Would he take the spitting image of Severus aside from his eyes and small stature? Would he turn to quidditch like Potter or potions like himself? Or perhaps charms like his mother. What house would he be sorted into when he got to Hogwarts? With a Gryffindor mother and adopted father and with Severus in Slytherin.
Crowley pulled his glasses off and rubbed his face. "Alive it seems. Sirius is in some sort of prison, dreadful place really. Looks almost worse than hell. I don't know why. He has... he has cashed in on a favor owed." Crowley held up his arm to show off the golden design now imbedded into it. Aziraphale took his hand, fingers tracing the thread with wonder. He knew what it meant. Knew it was important if Crowley was willing to allow the spell to take hold. "The Potter boy, Harry, has been shipped off to his Aunt's house. Sirius is adamant that he not be allowed to stay."
“Unfortunately I… was not in a good place when Harry was born,” Severus hedged carefully, resisting the urge to scratch at his arm where his sleeve hid his faded mark. “I did not turn to Dumbledore’s side until after Lily was killed and I certainly was not in the right mindset to take care of a child. It’s possible Dumbledore knew and decided I was unsuitable at the time, or it’s possible he was unaware completely. Right now we’re simply unsure.”
He didn’t look much like either of them really, not freshly born and barely an hour old. But he was pale as snow with pink in his cheeks and his little button nose. And when he blinked his eyes open, they were the most beautiful of greens.
“Sealed?” Lucius frowned, leaning forward slightly in his seat. “They were never read? How is that possible?”
The uncharacteristic hesitance in Lucius’ words had Narcissa’s heart lurching even more and she glared at him, willing him to get on with it.
Aziraphale sighed and nodded, turning to Crowley again with a smile. "Very well. Let's talk about something different then, shall we? I have never been to Hogwarts, what shall I expect? I remember you were quite fond of the castle itself."
Hermione, as the girl would introduce herself, didn't seem as phased at Harry's 'legend' status as Ron was, but she did manage to educate them on what to expect once they'd get to Hogwarts, as she had done a
They were at the zoo when it happened. It was Harry's birthday and he'd been begging for ages to go, so they'd surprised him with tickets.
” The boy asked, glancing curiously at Lucius before turning back to Severus with almost pleading eyes. “
Harry had noticed them by now, eyes wide as he tried to hide behind his father’s leg, peeking out at Draco like he was afraid he’d hurt him.
Goodness yall are all the best! Thank you so much for all the support with this project! It's definitely a coping thing for me. She who shall not be named is ruining everything I love about this series, so I'm fixing it by writing my own. Right now I'm uploading pretty regularly, but it's been known for me to skip weeks sometimes. So please don't expect something crazy scheduled. I'm just writing when I'm inspired.
"No need," the angel dismissed, snapping a finger. A bag settled at his feet, making the Durley's jump in surprise, and he grabbed it as he stood. "You can keep any toys or bedding you've gotten him. This is everything he arrived with and some clothes until we've managed to get him new things. Now, the boy?"
Stern eyes shot down to glare at the student who'd dared say her name, only to soften when she saw Harry and a barely-there smile tilted her lips. "Harry, my dear. I trust you're excited to be here. I see you've made friends already." He nodded eagerly, but she didn't continue the conversation past that, only turning to the students as a whole and raising her hands for silence. "First years! I am Professor McGonagal and I will be your Gryffindor Head of House, as well as Headmistress under Albus Dumbledore. Now listen closely, because I will not be repeating myself."
"Well you did promise, didn't you? Besides, I think it'd be lovely to have a little one running around again. I did so love Warlock, and this time we won't have any other objectives in mind when raising him." Aziraphale sat up straight, tugging proudly at his vest before smiling. "And I think we would do a much better job this time around. Especially when we won't have to hide anything from the boy, though..." He hummed, finger tapping on his chin in thought. "We probably should find somewhere else to live. A bookshop isn't quite the place to raise a child I don't think. Nonetheless, that can be done rather quickly I think. I'll set it up for tomorrow. Perhaps Tadfield? It will give us the chance to visit with Adam as well. I'm sure he'd love that. Then we can fetch the boy, yes?"
alright. But can't you feel it, dear?" The angel shivered and tugged anxiously at his labels and began to fuss with his overcoat. "There is hatred in this house. So much of it, I'm surprised it's not seeping out of the floorboards."
"And you look beautiful, as always," the wizard smirked, though it fell a bit flat as he winced. Slowly, he reached through the circle and grabbed Crowley's wrist, forcing the demon to grab his in return. "I-I don't have time to explain. You owe me a favor, Crowley."
“Sevvy, dear,” Narcissa said quietly, gracefully dropping to her knees before the dark haired man and putting a hand on his, “you look awful dreadful. Let me take this and we’ll get you some water, yes?” He didn’t fight her as she gently pried the parchment from his fingers, noticing it wasn’t actually one letter, but two, and she dutifully ignored the stench of firewhiskey on his breath, instead ducking her head to search his face for any hint of what might have happened. She was met with blank eyes and tear tracks down both cheeks, a look she hadn’t seen on him in nearly nine years. Not since he’d lost the closest thing he’d ever had to a soulmate. With the assumption that he wouldn’t be able to speak right now, she turned to her husband and took the blanket he held out for her in exchange for the letter. With a grateful nod, she draped the heavy knit over Severus’ shoulders and grabbed a glass of water from Tipsy. “Severus, darling, I need you to drink for me, okay? Come on, head up. Just a few sips to ease my mind, yes?”
Harry wasn’t sure what the boy meant, his face scrunching up in confusion as he glanced back at his father. “
,” he signed, earning him a wide eyed gaze from the smaller boy. After a quick, frantic response, Severus’ smile turned a bit sad and Draco really wished he would have learned the signing language at some point. “
ignored, which is illegal, it would be well within yours and Hadrian’s rights to demand he repay anything he’s taken from the vault.”
Now, about the Potter's will. I am aware that we previously discussed this after you and Mr. Fell adopted Harry, but I find it pertinent to remind you, just in case, what with Harry taking his first voyage into the wizarding world. I'm sure you remember, but Harry does have a sizable fortune left to him from his parents that is sitting in his Gringots Vault. Since he's turned eleven, he is now allowed to access that vault, so it's asked that you visit Gringots before school begins in order to put Harry's affairs in order. Since he is so young, he will need to have an adult put on file as his guardian officially, but he will be allowed to use the money left to him to purchase his school items.
Lucius gave a rare smile and nodded. “There will be much to do, but your test is the only one needed immediately in order to fetch the boy. We can leave everything else for after. I’d rather not leave him any longer than absolutely necessary.” Severus was already nodding, pushing himself from his chair and smiling gratefully when Narcissa helped him up. “I will write to the Ministry to open a case while you freshen up,” Lucius said as he stood as well, straightening his sleeves and grabbing his cane. “I’ll make sure they are aware to keep it completely confidential until we know the full details.”
Aziraphale snapped his fingers, popping the seal perfectly, and opened the letter. He cleared his throat, hands searching his head for his glasses. Harry groaned and handed them to him impatiently and Aziraphale chuckled. "Ah, thank you darling. Let's see.
wasn’t allowed to sit at the table next to the other boy. But Draco had just expected him to sit beside him and the adults just smiled.
Harry glared at the demon, as if challenging him. When the demon didn't budge, Harry raised a hand and smacked it on Crowley's mouth. "Muh-um!"
Severus said as the boy signed, smiling before Harry faced his hands out and bowed. He looked a bit unsure, his gaze turning towards Draco for just a moment. But Draco’s smile seemed to relax him and he straightened back up to sign something else that looked similar to Draco’s sign name. Severus’ grin only widened and he dropped a hand on Harry’s head. “He says this is your sign name,” Severus told them, motioning for Harry to repeat it, before he could explain however, Harry pointed towards Lucius and did a similar sign only he touched his forehead instead of his chin like he had for Narcissa. “It means Mother Dragon and Father Dragon.”
Severus jolted slightly in surprise, eyes widening and fingers twisting through Narcissa’s so tightly she was sure she might have bruises forming. “So quickly?”
Taking the initiative as the boy’s newly appointed best friend, Draco took a step forward and bowed his head, his hands out flat to show he wasn’t holding his wand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you,” he said, trusting his godfather to translate for him since he didn’t know how to sign. “I’m Draco Malfoy and I’m going to be your new friend.”
Still, his magic had been limited to floating on his broom, making his toys move on their own, and the occasional magical tossing of items when he threw a fit. Nothing quite as big as making an entire glass enclosure disappear.
After a moment of consideration, Draco straightened his back and looked up at his mother. “Do you think he’d like a gift? I have just the thing to give him!”
Harry frowned at the book, though not upset, only confused. He put his hands together like a prayer before separating them. Draco didn’t need his uncle to translate to know the sign meant
Blinking at the sudden change in conversation, Harry shook his head and took the small box from Ron's hand. "Uh- thanks? I didn't know I was a legend, but I guess that's cool. My Ba always said that no one is better than anyone else though so, I don't see why we can't sit together." The boys shared a smile and Harry popped open the lid to the oddly shaped box.
to be. Still, one thing had been bothering him since his mother had interrupted his library time. “I didn’t know Uncle Severus had a son,” he frowned, holding out his hands for his mother to straighten his sleeves even though they were perfect. “And if he’s Uncle Severus’ son, why is his name Harry
Most surprising however were the fading bruises they could see on his cheek and collarbone, as well as the dirty and massive clothing he wore, making him look even smaller than he was. (Which was
And finally, as you'll find out in this chapter, Harry is going to be considered disabled in this story, due to the injury he sustained when Voldemort attacked him. I'll go further into it later in the story as it comes up, but just a warning there.
Harry was actually happy to teach Draco. He learned quite a few words while they were flipping through the yearbook such as “mom and dad”, “school”, “magic”, and “student”. He also learned “pretty” in regards to Harry’s mom and “grumpy” in regards to Severus. The other boy was absolutely fascinated with the moving pictures, but especially the ones of his parents. He’d stopped to stare for a long time when they’d reached the seventh year individual photos, staring at his mother’s image as she winked smartly at the camera. James Potter was a few pages past, his cocky smirk and wild hair nothing like Harry’s. How anyone thought the boy was Potter’s, Draco would never know. He also spent a bit of time on Severus’ photo, amused at the shaggy black hair and the dead looking eyes.
Draco couldn’t help the break in his normally cool mask when he smiled brightly, his eyes all but lighting up at the name. “Brilliant! Did you hear mother? I’m a silver dragon!”
Aziraphale was right behind the demon, breath coming short and hand pressed hard over his chest. "Harry, dear- I thought I'd be discorporated. Bloody heaven, Crowley. You never ought to have shown him that awful show."
A difficult conversation then, the woman decided as she hid a grimace. Draco was a darling, but he grew up very privileged and proper. She would need to speak with him about how to treat the new boy so as not to frighten or upset him. Or worse, insult him.
Now, in regards to Sirius. As I'm sure you remember, the animals allowed at Hogwarts as pets are the following: owls, cats, rats, and toads. Snakes are usually a hard ban due to the incidents we've had in the past regarding Voldemort and his followers. However, I have brought up your concerns with Albus and taken into the account that Sirius is Harry's service animal. We do of course take exceptions for students with disabilities, though we haven't had the need to make an exception on snakes yet. I hope you understand that there will be strict rules as to his being allowed at Hogwarts. Sirius must not roam the halls on his own, and must be with Mr. Potter-Fell at all times if he leaves the dorm rooms. He must stay his current size, and Harry is not allowed to return him to his larger size under any circumstances. We also must ask that Harry not speak to Sirius in Parseltongue when in the presence of other students. Parseltongue, you may not know, is an extremely rare language, and it perhaps may scare other students and parents if word gets around that young Harry knows it. This may also be a given, however we ask that Sirius be made aware that there are other pets allowed at Hogwarts, and he is not allowed to eat another student's pet, including the rats.
What a day Harry thought to himself falling back against the door sliding to the carpet with a sigh. He’d gotten a lot done, learned a lot too. But he wasn’t done yet he thought to himself with a deep sigh hanging his head between his knees. Food, clothing, security, knowledge. With the comforting weight of the vault key in his pocket he was sure he could accomplish all that and more with a little finesse.
Things continued like so, Rogrig naming valuable and unique antiques Harry gobbling the information up like a starving man. So many interesting objects. He learned he could actually talk to some of the portraits. He just had to visit one of the manors, the thought of talking to Potters of the past got him very excited again. His excitement was diminished pretty drastically when Rogrig told him he was most likely barred from any of the Potter estates until he came of age and was named Head in turn. The last Head of House Potter, his dad, had understandably closed the Potter manors during the war to protect them when his family had gone into hiding. They however remained closed with his death, and would remain so until Harry came of age at 17.
However he knew most adults wouldn't approve of an 11 year old wandering London on their own. He had to make himself inconspicuous to them.
“Damn it all.. Now what?” he asked the owl pitifully squishing his face against the cage. It turned with a little hoot and gave his finger a gentle nip through the bars.
“You haven’t overstepped at all, Rogrig! I would be grateful for the assistance.” Harry smiled and stuck out a hand for him to shake. Rogrig looked at it confused, but gave him a bow in return.
“Curses Heir Potter.” Rogrig interrupted smoothly. “Magic, it's not always quite so obvious as an ever-extending filing cabinet.”
vault key sir?” Rogrig continued basking in this moment he found himself in, looking for all the world he’d just eaten something truly decadent.
“Did you think I wouldn’t notice the missing money you ungrateful selfish little boy.” She hissed lunging for Harry’s ear making pinching motions like a great big lobster.
Rogrig hummed aloud looking like he swallowed something bitter with the realization that this wasn’t entirely financial at all. It was vaguely adjacent at best, only in that he was sure he’d be withdrawing money for the Potter Heir today.
Harry's ears were ringing and he was waving away bits of confetti, as the oddest sensation he’d ever felt ran down his body. It felt viscous like oil and left a tingling sensation on his skin as it moved.
Harry was surprised at how quickly that was handled but was all the happier for it. He’d just learned that these vaults were his this morning, and Harry decided he’d had nothing for far too long to go giving it away now. Hagrids instructions to be frugal and strictly purchase only what was a necessary requirement of Hogwarts was now suddenly tinted in a grimer light, was it truly meant as the patriarchal lesson in responsibility as it was presented. Or a sneaky bid to continue to hold control over the Potter estate. Harry had yet to meet the man but with the information Rogrig had imparted to him this morning he couldn't help but assume the worst.
Harry made it to Charing Cross Road without any other major complications, the sun had finally caught up with him casting a crisp morning light on the streets. He could see The Leaky Cauldron down the way.
He didn't know if he’d be turned away without a guardian present but he knew he had to follow through, there was no turning back, it wasn’t an option. He had no way of playing his way through this. It was the whole reason why he was here in the first place to acquire the necessary cards to play the game properly in this new world.
He had been told to hold the vault key in his hands for the duration of his time at Gringotts, that he had to get used to it and it him. Attune himself to it to get a better understanding of it, without a good grasp of how its magic felt he wouldn’t be able to pull on it and summon it to him.
Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream was a must. He'd been craving it for the last week since Hagrid took him. Flourish and Blotts for sure he thought as he passed, giving it a longing glance, much to learn, do much to catch up on. Twilfitt and Tattings had some very nice clothes it seemed, and oh! He had to get another couple sets of school robes from Madam Malkin's. For that matter he'd have to pick up another set of all his first year supplies.
you told me honestly and without the superior airs that wizards use that you are the Heir to House Potter. I invited you back here because you don’t even know how to summon your own vault key. I invited you back here because you are the owner of a large and old account. I invited you back here because I’ve just set papers in front of you that indicate your assets have slowly been draining for years for a war effort that should have ended the night the last head of House Potter died. I invited you back here to offer my services to you, Heir Potter.” Rogrig finished with a small half bow to Harry.
it’d be a cake walk. These people were far out of the Dursley’s sphere of influence. Hell these were people the Dursleys were afraid to interact with.
“Uh I apologize sir,” Tom said, filling the uncomfortable silence between them. “I probably should have asked before I cast anything on you. It’s a busy night, I wasn't thinking.”
Rogrig for the first time in their conversation seemed off balance, Harry wasn't sure if it was the declaration that did it or the way it was declared, but he was off balance all the same.
These letters had chased him and his family all the way to this God forsaken rock in the middle of the sea.
“But isn’t that illegal.. I mean why didn't she ever get arrested if you knew the money had been earned illegally.” Harry asked, confused.
Lulling the Dursleys into his false perceptions, guiding his actions by their unsaid rules, subtly worming his way into their good graces. Years of enduring their insults, years of hiding the evidence of what he now knew was his magic acting out all along. Years of never asking questions. Years spent meticulously combing his hair every chance he got. Years of going above and beyond for them, years with which they began to tolerate him. Years where he finally managed to convince them to let him use Dudley's second bedroom. Three years of the most beautiful game Harry had ever played gone in seconds. With a letter of all things… With a lot of letters, delivered by owls and one by a very large man.
He had picked up yesterday that goblins didn't seem to mind kids being about on their own, but he was pretty positive wizards shared the same view as Muggles when it came to child safety. Parents or guardians were supposed to accompany them to places. That was all well and good Harry thought, when those guardians truly cared.
“Um sure. Please.” Harry said shifting uncomfortably in his seat suddenly feeling caught but not quite sure why.
“If I may be so bold Heir Potter, I’m under the distinct impression that you don't understand anything about this world you find yourself in.” Rogrig finished with a sweeping gesture across his office.
He had to wait about 15 minutes but eventually a relatively large sized group passed through to the entry wall of Diagon Alley and Harry slipped in with them.
,” he emphasized, scolding even. “Not your introduction to the benal enanities of wizarding politics.” Rogrig said with a great puff of smoke at the end. “I have no interest in such things, no knowledge of such things and quite honestly despise them.”
Weaving his way through the crowded alley, peeking up to look at store signs, he eventually stumbled upon one called Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop. Harry was pretty positive this had to be the place. How many joke shops could the wizarding world need really? The uh, Muggles, Harry thought deliberately, didn't have many themselves. It was a rather niche interest and one a lot of people found annoying.
Harry made his quiet way over to the door about to leave when Rogrig stopped him again saying “If you ever enter Knockturn Alley it may be wise to pick up a minor disguise first, that alley holds a darker reputation.” Rogrig was looking towards his ceiling drawing from his cigarellos.
“Ignorance is a dangerous thing in a world where touching the wrong quill could be the difference in having and not having a hand.”
Harry was finding it hard to comprehend how much of a separate entity the goblin bank was and wasn’t sure their turning a blind eye to potentially illegal and dangerous ventures was a good thing. But he was beginning to understand, it had at least worked well for Aunty Esther. Mulling it over in the back of his mind while passing his vault key between his hands, passively listening to ancient family account histories.
A big man named Hagrid had actually just walked him through a magical alley-way, helped him buy supplies for wizards school, explained to him that he was some sort of baby war hero, then left.. Just like that: "Oh by the way yer a wizard Arry, have an owl, goodbye." He hadn't a clue how to care for an owl or any desire to own one. They were apparently "dead useful" though.
Then Uncle Vernon started throwing things: The kitchen roll, a cutting board sans knife, a can of beans. Harry started dodging left and right, the kitchen roll hitting his shoulder with a soft whump, the cutting board clipping his shin making him wince and drop to clutch his knee, then the beans flew over his head and knocked into the China cabinet making it rattle dangerously.
He could do with some proper clothes too. Proper food, a proper prescription for his glasses. It’s a wonder Hagrid hadn’t said anything about the condition he found him in, a wonder nobody he’d met in Diagon Alley had said anything. He was a mess. Hagrid was a bit of a mess himself if Harry was being honest, it's possible he just assumed that's how Harry was and not a distinct indication of the conditions in which he lived. If that was the case it made Harry like the big idiot more for it.
Like I said at the end of the prologue I'm never gonna get really graphic with anything, but honestly the stuff thats glossed over in canon is already pretty bad. I'm just giving it more consequences and focusing on Harry's mental state and that gives it more weight.
And so Harry sat, and when it was as busy as he’d ever seen it and as loud as he’d ever heard it he got up and squeezed through the mingling crowd making his way to the loo. When he was in with the door shut and locked he backed against the wall to reread the directions on the back of the poppers package.
“Better Sir?” Harry jumped, snapping his focus away from the muted patrons. Tom's voice was surprisingly loud over the now quiet din of the dining room. He was now fully attentive to Harry and was giving him a curious inquisitive look. Harry’s heart jumped at the sudden focus and he quickly tried to school his face back to that irritated expression he walked up to Tom with, but was finding it hard to keep the awe off his face.
Not that he didn’t appreciate the owl of course, it was lovely, and Hagrid was the first person Harry had ever met that he didn’t have to bend over backwards to impress. It was refreshing, if a little strange to be loved just because. He imagined it must be what Dudleys day to day with Aunt Petunia was like, if a bit more smothering in Dudleys case. Hagrid was like a very big golden retriever Harry decided and figured he couldn’t really blame him for how he went about introducing the wizarding world.
Harry slid through the garden door and into the Dursley’s dining room gently turning the handle on the old door. Giving it a pull as the latch stuck, he grimaced when it shut with a too loud thump. Then grimaced again when he turned to come face to face with Uncle Vernon eating a popsicle in the dimly lit kitchen.
Rogrig had warned him to be inconspicuous when visiting, but Harry’s interest had definitely been piqued. The possibility for more powerful ways to disguise himself was something he was very interested in, his fame was uncomfortable. While at the same time he saw that it could be useful. It was a double edged sword, and he thought if he could sheath it he’d be less likely to cut himself on it.
“Right. Of course, that’ll be 27 Galleons, 15 Sickles.” Tom finished with a bit of an awkward frown.
He’d suddenly find himself on the roof of the school on occasions he was being chased. Sort of just "pop" up there. Terribly hard to get down.
Harry took this all in trying to keep the obvious interest off his face, pretending like it was all old news looking past his hood and through his blonde bangs at Tom.
And so it continued on like this until they got to the most recent account history of the Potter House.
"Very well,” Rogrig said gathering some papers, “once summoned we will instruct you on how to feel for its presence and summon it yourself. If only to avoid this inconvenience in the future." Rogrig said, hopping down from his dais and opening a half door to the left of it, gesturing for Harry to enter.
Harry saw Vernons shoulders stiffened when Dudley turned around and his pigs tail peaked out from under his shirt. A grim self-satisfied smirk found its way to Harry’s face at Hagrid’s convenient reminder of what magic was capable of.
Picking them back up he proceeded to tear them with a growl making a bitter little pile of confetti.
He looked up at the mirror and into the face of a scruffy looking blonde man who appeared to be in his 60s.
That didn’t mean he couldn’t play, it just meant it was more difficult. That was one of the reasons Hagrid was so refreshing. Playing the game with Hagrid was so easy, it felt like he had three decks of cards to choose from. So many options available to him. He discovered quickly that Hagrid came in with the idea that he could do no wrong, he was a hero. Too bad Hagrid didn’t have more to give him, more influence, he could play him like a fiddle.
“Do you like it Uncle?” Harry quickly replied, giving his hair a flip. His life flashed before his eyes at the end of his hairs 2 second arc.
“Well I’ve recently found myself without a home to return to.” The sentence tumbled out of him, his eyes going glassy.
He was outside, embraced by the chill fog of dawn. He shivered from the cool wet air and the energy that came from sneaking about where one shouldn’t. Hidden from peeping neighbors he made his way through the small woods bordering the back garden and popped out onto Magnolia Crescent.
It took about 10 minutes for Rogrig to finish with the scraggly looking wizard he was helping, doing so with a sigh exhaling a small cloud of smoke.
“I’m sorry sir?” Harry said with wide eyes, stalling for time and cursing himself in the same thought. This was too innocent, self-assured confidence is what he needed for this man to leave him alone.
“There may be other options…” Rogrig said slowly voice echoing off his wall of filing cabinets. He had noted that the boy seemed worn, more so than yesterday. Like he’d aged years overnight. He had dark red rings around his eyes. They were clouded and lacked the confidence and hope he’d left Gringotts with yesterday. His hands were scraped and he smelled of dried blood and sweat.
Dropping the knife back on the table Uncle Vernon quickly turned and gathered his family still standing at the door and started herding them out of the scene.
“One would probably only need a galeon or two to acquire a simple disguise, more for something a bit more grand and only 20 or 30 more to rent a set of rooms at The Leaky Cauldron for a couple weeks.” Rogrig had turned back to Harry but was taking great care to ash his cigarellos now, looking deep into the polished bronze ashtray. Like he was considering something aloud to himself.
If he played with half a deck of cards with most people, he played with a quarter deck with the Dursleys. No matter what he did he’d never have their support. He knew that. It didn't take a magical revelation for him to realize it. His presence was always and would always be a constant reminder of the burden they perceived him as, his roots a blemish on their family. It didn't matter that his parents weren’t actually the drunks that killed themselves and scarred their baby boy in a reckless midnight drive. They were wizards and Harry learned not a day ago that the Dursleys actually thought that was worse.
When he turned, Harry saw he had pulled a folder out about 7 inches thick and at least as big as his torso. With a heave he flopped it onto the desk, cigarillo smoke steaming from his nostrils.
All Hagrid had told him was that an evil lunatic tried to kill him and it didn't work, that's it, that's why he was famous. He lived. And he was a boy. He was the boy who lived. He was quite good at it, being alive. This was after explaining that morality was just as up in the air for wizards as it was for muggles.
“Thank you so much for your help Rogrig.” Harry said with a bow, picking up on the goblins' gestures from the day.
He soon came across a small section on magical disguises. Rogrig had been right that these were minor things. Most looked like they wouldn’t fool anyone, things like cheap looking false teeth and fake mustaches that’d stick to you for hours. Harry was about to go a bit mental wondering how Rogrig could think these would fool anyone when he came across a curious little item. There were only three left on the shelf, it was advertised as a party gag. It looked like a cheap Muggle confetti popper he'd seen on shelves around New Years. However with one big difference. These promised that when popped at someone their physical appearance would change for the hour. There was a moving image on the back showing how it worked, with a tagline next to it in big bold letters stating “New Year New You!”
Rogrig squinted past him dangerously leaning back in his chair with a long deliberate drag of his cigarellos.
.” He eventually said dropping back into a business oriented demeanor and a subtle interested emphasis on his name. Though Harry might’ve been crazy, his nerves still running high.
Harry moved quickly through Diagon Alley not sparing glances for the magical shops, a boy on a mission. Without a place to return to tonight he needed to make arrangements quickly or he’d be sleeping in a park. He didn't know who else to turn to and he’d been very helpful yesterday Harry thought to himself, stepping quickly up the stairs to Gringotts he briskly entered and began scanning the room for Rogrig.
Tom smiled a stiff customer service smile at his meager tip and said “Of course sir, will that be all?”
RECAP: And so Harry exited Gringotts after summoning his key and withdrawing 150 pounds of muggle money, which was roughly 5 Sickles. He thought the exchange rate was ludicrous and didn't know if the muggle economy was just that bad and the wizards just that good. Or if goblins just didn't know how to set a proper value to the paper currency, seeing as how they printed them right there in front of you, either way Harry wasn’t questioning it.
Exiting the drugstore he checked some of the surrounding streets near Charing Cross looking for a barber. He had something drastic in mind.
It was a couple hours later that Harry found himself drained mentally and physically. Along with some other part of him he’d never noticed before now, but what he could guess was his magic.
Now apparently every wizard knew of him and it was unsettling. He needed to figure out what they thought they knew.
Rogrig abruptly stopped in place and turned to face Harry, Harry surprised by the sudden move almost ran into him. Uncomfortably close to Rogrigs cigarillos.
He stopped at a drugstore first and drifted over to the makeup section looking for a bit of concealer. The cashier gave him a couple odd looks but didn’t give him much trouble. He had his scar covered with a hasty application, Harry thought it a bit fun actually. However this still wasn’t enough, he was still distinctly Harry Potter to those that saw him last week even with the symbol of his fame covered.
Harry found himself ushered back into Rogrigs office again and sat into the same plush office chair as the afternoon before.
It'd been about an hour, coming out the other side of the barber shop once found with straight golden blond hair he was sure he’d made the right decision. He wasn’t sure if the Dursleys would let him back inside but he’d cross that bridge when he got there. He was assured his hair would go back to normal in a day or two after the straightening. The young hairdresser thought he was funny getting it straightened then regretting it. It was a bit he guessed, he found he didn’t mind the blonde but that his hair looked rather silly flat against his scalp, used to the messy loose curls that normally topped his head. It did have the pleasing effect of being distinctly different from Harry Potter.
"It's just the last time I was here a man named Hagrid had my vault key, he'd gotten it from a man named Albus Dumbledore.. I was under the assumption that I needed his permission."
“Most inns wouldn’t rent a room to someone your age without adult consent or supervision. You know, wizard laws, irresponsible children, safety and all that.” Rogrig ground out looking like it was difficult to even talk about the customs of humans.
“Uh. Would you have time to discuss something, privately?” Harry asked, making pleading eye contact with the goblin.
“Very well Heir Potter, you have sufficiently proven that you’re capable of summoning your vault key.” Rogrig said, blowing smoke to the ceiling as he leaned back in his chair. “Just in time as well, my shift ends at 7.”
After a bit of awkward fumbling Harry pocketed his change and Harlan looked up to meet Tom’s eyes. “Thank you Tom.” Harlan handed the man a Knut in return.
, there are bad wizards. He couldn’t help picking on the big idiot, and there probably wasn't any harm in it if he kept it to himself.
Haphazardly smearing concealer over his scar he walked into The Leaky Cauldron keeping his head down like before and making his way to the back near the entrance wall of Diagon Alley. He was making the best effort he could muster right now at keeping a low profile.
“Boy! What in the bloody hell do you think you're doing! Sneaking into my dining room at such an ungodly hour!” Vernon bellowed, the other end of his bitten through popsicle flying from his mouth to land at Harry’s feet.
He donned his most nondescript clothes and a hoodie. He was sure it’d be hot being early August, but the hood would come in handy in Diagon Alley where he was very popular.
Looking up he met Rogrigs eyes briefly only for them to skitter away quickly to continue boring a hole in his desk.
It was early, very early, too early for a Dursley to be about and hopefully too early for most folks as well. It was the ideal time to initiate his plan.
All his other text books read like made up guides for fictional solutions to improbable things. The potions text seemed the most logical, but only if you had an understanding of the illogical properties the ingredients possessed.
He discovered most people's rules were relatively similar: kindness, politeness, and a general positivity. He could approach most folks on the street with these in mind and gain a bit of passive favor. Put the right face on and doors normally closed opened to him.
Harry opened one and turned it in his hand. He was surprised to see it was made of a soft wood, and thought for a moment about how odd that was. These kinds of things were usually made of plastic, or other cheap bits of odds and ends.
Harry left Gringotts pockets heavy with galleons, and made his way into the alley proper. The street was bustling with witches and wizards moving to and fro, they all seemed incredibly focused on their own tasks. Seeing this Harry found himself relaxing slightly into the ambiguity a busy crowd provided and went looking for a disguise to buy like Rogrig had said.
“Oh no don't worry Rogrig I’m not here for that..” Harry said shifting from foot to foot uncomfortably.
It was still dark outside when Harry stole a fifty pound note from Aunt Petunia's purse. She had just done her shopping the day before and wasn't due to go out again for another 2 days, with any luck he could return what he took with her none the wiser.
Though courtesy of the Dursley’s undercutting he rarely played with a full deck. Expectations set by others are incredibly difficult to break down and rebuild once there, especially when set by that person's authority figures. The Dursleys were always happy to start the school year by letting the faculty know how much of a horrible troublemaker Harry was, and Dudley always had vicious rumors ready to poison the well.
"I thought maybe because I was 11, or still a student.. Immature, or irresponsible or something. Uh.. the uh. The muggles. They do things similarly."
Simple things, small things, but things he found very important: a bit of extra food in the lunchroom, a bit of extra time in the library.
“Just a little swish and flick and I can give you the same.” He said, putting on a mischievous Cheshire grin.
Then decided he definitely could after a second thought. But after living with them for the last 10 years he wasn’t surprised. That realization is what cooled his Dursley ire. They’d starved him, locked him in a cupboard for years. Was he to expect they’d have the decency to tell him the truth about his legacy. Of course not, they were the Dursleys. They were awful.
“I’ll give him an escort onto the train sir, not to worry!” The officer shouted towards the man who'd waved. He turned back to Harry with a “Come on then son, nothing to worry about just keep an ear out for the Paddington stop. If you happen to miss it just look for someone dressed like me at the very next stop they’ll be happy to help, you’ll do fine I’m sure. There's nothing to it.” Leading him towards his train, with a kind hand to his back.
He’d always been alone, and the Dursleys always made such a big fuss out of it, out of everything he did. His powers. His magic. Was something he learned early on to just hide or ignore when he could. When something
“I’d be the worst sort of help anyway, I’m sure there's a book you could read. You will need to educate yourself on it.” Rogrig muttered smoke puffing out at the corners of his lips and diving back into the paperwork.
So Hatsune Miku wrote some pretty black and white books morally speaking and I'm here to muddle that up, and really ratchet the Slytherin cunning up if I can. This will obviously be an AU, I'm looking to avoid bashing characters. When I said I was muddling things up that goes for everyone! I'm gonna try my best to hold to that even with Harry's POV through out.
“There isn’t a useful scrap of information in any of these!” Harry told Hedwig with a sharp gesture at his open school books.
Petunia gave him another sharp tug and with it the banister snapped with the sound of splintering wood. Harry lost his grip on the banister just as the energy in the hall became pronounced thickening like a deep morning fog. Petunia's grip loosened as the horrible wet cloying energy pooled around them. The light flickered. Then burst above them! Raining broken glass down on them both. Petunia startled with a scream in the sudden darkness and noise, lost her grip completely on Harry and stumbled falling flat on her back.
Tom was a man in his middle years, balding with less teeth than most people had. He seemed quite popular with his patrons. He looked kind.
Harry did eventually summon it again, quicker this time, and Rogrig returned, now smoking his cigarellos with a glass of scotch in hand to take the key again. And so a pattern formed until Harry could summon it in seconds Rogrig would come and take it from him again.
Harry had decided that the best way to play Tom and all those dining in The Leaky Cauldron was to fully immerse himself in a memorable personality so unlike Harry himself that they’d never even think to suspect him. Not that they’d have any reference for him anyway, but this was more fun and it was all possible thanks to his magical disguise, it was like a whole new game. Subtlety seemed pointless with a disguise this good.
Harry shivered remembering this morning, and kept to the same strict rules he’d used yesterday, hood up head down.
Knowing what expectations someone might have of you is a key pillar in the game, without that information he’d step in it every time. And Harry had just learned everyone in the wizarding world he was about to enter had some serious expectations of him.
Some faces worked better than others. Some didn’t work at all. That was another aspect of the game. For example Harry learned the hard way he couldn’t intimidate. It never worked for him, he was underfed, scrawny and poorly dressed.
His disguise seemed to be working, no one was giving him more than a passive glance and he realized if he kept his head down and his hood up he could pass himself off as one of the many smaller folk he’d seen just this morning. His clothes were baggy enough to hide his kid proportions, one good thing about the dingy old clothes he guessed.
Petunia was huddled in the corner of their bed looking for all the world like this was the end, the rapture had happened and they were left behind. End times, bloody end times in the Dursley household.
He decided the lack of an actual confrontation was for the best, there was any number of things they could do to hamper this new opportunity. Avoiding him was helpful all things considered.
“Oh I need to be going.” Harry shot up. He wasn’t too worried the Dursleys would say anything as long as he snuck in before some ungodly hour like 10. They were too nervous around him lately to say anything, but he wasn't gonna push it. They didn't care at all for his safety, if anything they’d be concerned about him disturbing their sleep.
“I must be the only hero in history who hasn’t a clue what he even did.” he huffed at himself in the mirror. With an exasperated puff of air his bangs lifted from his forehead. The lightning bolt scar flashing at him in his reflection.
Harry noticed you could really get him talking if you asked the right questions, he could probably use that to his advantage. He was also alone at the bar which was good too, he seemed to use a lot of magic to take care of all the serving and pouring, and took the orders himself. Lots of tea kettles and pitchers were constantly soaring around the room and pouring refills for folks with their glasses raised. Harry wasn’t sure if that bit of chaos was good for him or not.
The bird stared blankly past Harry once he stopped his petting but he took that as a yes and presented his vault key to her anyway. It glinted in the moonlight. She gave it a curious look and he continued.
The man ran The Leaky Cauldron and he wanted to suss out what cards would work best on him and which to avoid before he tried to rent a room.
Harry gaped looking all around at the patrons of The Leaky Cauldron. They were still actively talking, but he no longer heard them?
He’d just spent the last 4 days discovering his school books were capable of answering none of his questions and only seemed good for creating newer, more obscure ones. With the added side effect of getting him very excited about what he’d be learning to do. Spell work seemed incredibly varied and downright useful. Mostly.
Harry, tired before he’d even made it to Diagon Alley this afternoon, decided he’d call it a day and made his way to The Leaky Cauldron. One last play in mind before he could rest.
“Uh no” Harry said dazedly, studying a quill on Rogrig’s desk. Rogrig frowned, the boy was different today, less focused. Less conscious.
"That would be quite the pickle to find yourself in Heir Potter, as I'm fairly certain your parents are permanently unavailable." Rogrig retorted with a grim sort of humor in his voice, still briskly leading him through Gringotts.
“Alrighty Mr. Patterson you’ll be in room 452.” Tom said, turning seemingly surprised to see the old man struggling to wrangle his coins.
"Good morning bud" Harry whispered with a gentle pat to Hedwig's head. She was awake of course and eager for her early morning flight.
You see he'd figured out that everyone has these little rules. They're these hidden things that once he found provided a structure with which he could follow. He had gotten good at figuring out these individual rules of engagement, and knowing what cards to place in return. That was his game and he'd been playing for years.
“So you say lad, so you say.” The shopkeep said with a happy wrinkling at the corner of his eyes handing Harry his change.
He had learned his game of social persuasion watching the Dursleys. They constantly played it with the neighbors. Very poorly, too heavily handed in Harry’s opinion, but they played it nonetheless. And Harry learned not long after figuring out the rules of this game that he was their joker, the card that if not played properly or taken out of play altogether would cause their house of cards to crumble. The Dursley’s dirty secret.
Still, even after refocusing on searching for the joke shop Rogrig had mentioned he couldn't help but note stores he'd like to visit when next he could.
And Vernon wasn't positive he hadn't already snapped. He gave the rifle he'd boughten only a couple hours ago a glance.
the experience had overwhelmed him with countless questions brimming at the back of his mind. Only to be sent back to the Dursleys to be most assuredly murdered.
Harry decided to buy all three, giving himself 3 hours to look like someone else. To be someone else.
From there he tried his best to act like he belonged moving from street to street till he reached the familiar train station from days before and bought himself a ticket to Paddington at one of the many self-serve ticket kiosks.
Knowing what plays were available with each individual person, when to make them, and what could be gained from it, that was his game.
Harry gave a jerky nod and a nervous smile to the officer in return, He felt he didn't have to act that out it was coming rather naturally at the moment. He happened to look back and saw the man who'd waved watching them go looking supremely confused.
With a grin he remembered his vaults. The stacks of gold, the paltry amount he took out and all it got him. What he could accomplish with it.
he repeated to himself like a mantra. He was desperate. With a stubborn obstinance he summoned the courage to show his hand. Drop all his masks. Harry finally looked up to make direct eye contact with Rogrig, daring him to say anything about what he just witnessed about what he was currently witnessing.
"Sirrr!" Harry called to Tom, still 15 feet away and pushing awkwardly between two tables. Bumping one man's chair and spilling a bit of his pea soup in his lap. Harry winced inwardly but sank further into his charade and bumped the man's chair again as he moved past.
“Ah Har- Harlannn... Harlan Patterson.” Harry eventually drew out, god he was fumbling all over himself tonight.
“Well uh- I’d be happy to uh- cast a Muffliato around a booth for you sir. If the noise is too much.” Tom managed to get out while pouring drinks for other patrons.
Harry ducked back out of the way, hands raised up in front of him in a calming motion, like one would use on a wild horse.
The rating may change as characters grow and wars happen, and I'll be adding tags as necessary for things that could make folks uncomfortable. I'll also be adding a warning at the beginning of each chapter, where applicable. I will say I won't ever be getting super graphic with anything. Not my speed. However I will still warn, because it's all very subjective.
However with one difference, today he was putting money in Aunt Petunia's purse. He stepped lightly down the stairs and made his way over to the coat rack by the front door where Aunt Petunia hung her purse. Squinting half blind in the dark, Harry counted out what he’d taken from the day before adding it back to her wallet.
And realized in his frustration that he didn't have the energy to care about convincing the Dursleys of anything anymore..
After a bit of an awkward pause, Harry mulling everything over, he stood up and bowed. “Thank you for your assistance Rogrig, I’ll sleep easy tonight.” He paused with emphasis. “Knowing my finances are in such good hands.”
“Gringotts has been open every hour since the last great goblin war ended, and will not close until such a time as another goblin war begins.” Rogrig said no small amount of pride, and tacked on at the end. “Besides, some wizards only come out at night, and yes we do the infernal muggle paper money, it's all the muggleborns have.”
Tom looked genuinely relieved as well. He was finally rid of Harlan, and Harry was sure he had no clue he’d just rented a room to Harry Potter for the next 3 weeks.
His heart was thudding in his ears he couldn’t breathe! He grabbed onto one of the stair banisters holding on with all the strength he could muster.
Many of the things he heard he didn’t understand at all. Even so he decided this was something he needed to do daily if he could manage it. He’d read once that the best way to learn a language was to immerse yourself in it, and Harry assumed the same was probably true for wizarding stuff. Besides, if he could manage to keep from looking shocked at every seemingly common element of magical life he’d probably be better for it.
Cutting Harry off she grabbed him by the forearm and started pulling him down the hall. With her other hand she reached out towards the cupboard under the stairs.
.” Rogrig snapped back with a toothy grin that made Harry feel like the absolute prat he was most assuredly meant to feel like.
With a deep breath Harry pointed the painted little popper his way, and waited a bit hoping for some bit of raucous conversation outside to use as cover.
Harry counted himself lucky he had gotten back a little after 9, if this had happened at 10 Uncle Vernon might’ve just stabbed him anyway. Aunt Petunia entered then, or Harry had just noticed. She was glowering at him clutching a worried looking Dudley behind herself, keeping him at the kitchen door and away from the home invader.
It got more complex but vastly more profitable when interacting with people he saw regularly. Teachers and other staff members at school, other students. The more time he spent with them the more time he could build on things, acquire new cards to play.
He was sure Rogrig wouldn’t like him drawing any more attention to it. Only because he realized Rogrig seemed to be helping in a capacity that wasn’t entirely a business matter and it was obviously making the goblin uncomfortable.
Tom, looking relieved seemed to fall back into the motions he’d done a thousand times before. He efficiently pulled a ledger book out from under the counter with an inviting toothless smile.
Harry found a mix of emotions knotting itself in his stomach at the news. He’d discovered he’d never felt betrayed by someone he didn't know.
"Then you'd be dead, for trying to steal from a vault of Gringotts." Rogrig replied offhandedly, shuffling the parchment aside. He began pulling a drawer out of one of the many filing cabinets in his office. Harry couldn't read him, and was under the distinct impression he wasn't joking.
For the next 4 hours Rogrig walked Harry through his accounts history, they dated back almost five hundred years and told a bit of a colorful story. Harry discovered he could learn a lot about his family through just their spending habits.
He wasn’t entirely sure what Rogrig was getting at but now that he mentioned it he could feel a faint rhythmic pulsing coming from it. He could feel it in the back of his mind, like a pressure you weren't aware of till you looked for it, like the sound of silence.
Rogrig continued. “If I have overstepped in my role as a banking professional do not hesitate to say so, but you seem to be in need of guidance, Heir Potter. It is the duty of the Heir when the Heads of the House are.. Indisposed, to run the Houses estate. Heirs are generally taught the basics by your age, in the case of tragedy, but it seems you have been neglected in this right. You would of course still have full authority over your accounts, this wouldn’t be a relinquishing of power but a guiding hand.”
He remained the same height, it seems the magic didn't reach all the way to the bones. But what it did reach. It
Harry found Hagrid had exited his life with the same abruptness he’d entered it. The whirlwind events of the past morning almost felt like a dream, so completely surreal he might’ve thought that was the case until he looked up and saw the owl again.
Things just sometimes happened around him. Like he understood snakes. Like actually understood them. Not in a wildlife expert: I know this things habits kind of way, but a "hello how do you do?" Kind of way.
“The note of withdrawal was signed over by your father James Potter, with the intention of aiding in the war efforts against He Who Must Not be Named. This was a noble intention, and one that was most assuredly used. Hopefully positively, but it is still open and continues to get used to this day..”
He enjoyed his game and it was good that he did. It was how he survived.. He'd been playing it for a long time and quickly found it very effective.
Harry looked down at himself, some hero, he was currently wearing a stained up old t-shirt 4 sizes too large for him, he was scrawny, barely fed. Forget about being emotionally ready. iIntellectually ready. He wasn’t even physically ready to enter this new world. And time was ticking down quickly.
Searching the cramped little isles keeping his head low whenever he passed another customer. Stepping over the occasional whoopee cushion that he learned would scream if he stepped on it, and around the wind-up teeth that'd rattle towards him trying to bite at his ankles.
That didn't stop him from feeling frustrated at the lack of answers Hagrid had. In the last 6 hours he had learned he was some sort of tragic folk hero for a secret community of witches living right here in the UK. He was apparently very wealthy by the amount of gold he witnessed in his vault, and had the ability to cast spells.
He was proud with a thought he could now summon his vault key to him and it appeared, Rogrig seemed proud too, but Harry was tired he could’ve been seeing things.
Harry, now confident he could pull this off, made his way into The Leaky Cauldron just after 11 in the morning, the majority of his 50 pounds spent. He knew where to go to get more though his vault at Gringotts was calling to him.
vaults, Heir Potter, the money is yours by birth right and by magic.” He emphasized his point with a puff of smoke in Harry's direction, and a flick of one of his cigarillos. “You will find that we care little for how men both magical and muggle govern themselves outside of these walls. This is a business, we care about their money. Nothing else.” Finished, Rogrig turned on his heel and continued briskly through the halls.
It'd been almost three years without an incident, well three years without the Dursley’s being aware of an incident. There had been quite a few incidents actually but that was the game wasn’t it. That was his game.
Harry found he was returning it. This was exactly what he needed, help. He had no clue what to do with all of this and not a clue what was expected of him and Rogrig was willing to tutor him.
When Harry arrived he quickly found a seat near the back. He was planning on watching Tom, and listening to some of the conversations around him.
And he knew nothing about them thanks to the Dursleys, to being abandoned. But they sure as hell knew a lot about him. Or thought they did anyway and that was more dangerous wasn't it. The rumors the Dursleys spread at the beginning of each school year had proven that for him. He was already at a disadvantage in this wizarding world.
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been running or even how long he’d been there before Hedwig alighted on his shoulder giving him a soft hoot and nibbling lightly on his ear. But he didn’t know where he was and didn’t recognize the street name. All the same it didn’t seem to matter much to him at the moment, Harry leaned in close to Hedwig and tucked his chin over her feet, awkwardly snuggling the bird as best he could. Clambering for whatever comfort she provided, they stayed like that until Harry’s legs fell asleep, his tears ran dry and his breathing returned to normal.
Harry shoved that thought in the corner of his mind and pulled himself together to take advantage of the opportunity that Tom so graciously presented to him.
“Vault key?” The goblin interrupted with a practiced businesslike ease, reaching out with a knobby hand.
Rogrig, seeming to have finally caught up, grinned and said “Well then Heir Potter I would summon your vault key and buy yourself something to eat. I am your financial advisor, not your mother.” So saying turned and left.
"I'll just add your blood verification to the Potter folder." Rogrig huffed, puffing smoke out in big breathy grunts of exertion, the drawer just kept going, extending out across the office now.
Harry could only think that the events of the last two weeks had all been too much for him. All the revelations and balancing acts piling up on his shoulders, the incident this morning with Aunt Petunia and his old cupboard being the final straw.
They certainly seemed afraid of magic given their reaction to the events of the last week. He bet he could use that to his advantage. Besides by the sounds of it he’d be spending the majority of the year away from them for the rest of his young life. If he played his cards right he'd rarely if ever have to see them again.
“Hagrid seemed to think I would be ok.. Said Hogwarts would catch me up.” Harry said, trying to excuse his ignorance in a bid to save face. Even while knowing Rogrig was right, it was the whole reason he was here. To better prepare himself.
“Oh of course Sir! We have plenty of rooms available all warded to reduce noise I assure you. I’ll just need a name then?” Tom finished, looking up expectantly at Harry.
“You lost son?” Ah speak of the devil, Harry turned to see a portly rail security officer speaking to him.
This one time his hair grew back overnight after Aunt Petunia had given him a particularly spiteful haircut. They’d locked him in the cupboard for a week after that one, god he’d been hungry.
He was biased of course, and in the end felt like a bit of a prat for expecting grounded solutions in magic books.
Magic, he’d been using that same card on the Dursleys all week, with a nervous tittering of his heart he decided he could try playing it here too.
“Um. No sir. I'm uh, just boarding the train to Paddington sir.” Harry said, making fleeting eye contact with the security officer and his shoes.
“I’m not stealing from you Aunt Petunia!'' He hissed back, thankful she didn't seem keen on waking the house too.
Harry shut and locked it again and turned to get himself ready. He was going back to Diagon Alley and he thought it prudent to keep that to himself. The Dursleys didn't seem to bother with him anymore, frightened of his magic. But he knew that only went so far and he was hesitant to push the limits. The Dursleys weren’t the issue though, right now they’d be happiest if he left in the night and never came back.
“There has to be some other way, what are you supposed to do if you lose it.” Harry interrupted smoothly gathering up the rest of his courage to play the card he just played. He rarely used it due to its propensity for catastrophic failure. A strict authoritative ignorance, a speak to your manager kind of voice.
Rogrig said nothing, not even hinting that he’d heard Harry, only picking up an official looking piece of parchment from his desk and giving it a read.
Tom quickly swept it into a pot under the counter that seemed to do the counting for him based on the numbers that were shifting up on a dial attached to the side of it. While the pot counted Tom turned muttering to himself and began picking through the keys hanging on the wall.
All it took was a quick prick of Harry's finger and a small drop of his blood dripped down and landed in the center of a blank piece of parchment below. It began to glow faintly as Rogrig spoke some sort of incantation. Soon the drop moved and began writing in a language Harry had never seen before. Then with a pop Harry’s vault key dropped onto the desk before them. Harry's eyes widened in surprise, still shocked by the reality of magic.
“As you say Heir Potter.” Rogrig said, snapping his fingers with a satisfied flourish. “It is done, Albus Dumbledore will find his withdrawal papers null and void when he next ventures to use them.”
Vernon summoned his courage and followed close behind clutching his new rifle to his chest on the way.
He was relieved when the raucous noise of the dining room overtook him the further he moved from his seat at the bar. It seemed, thankfully, that Tom hadn’t deafened him, permanently anyway.
Another face could blend him into the background, perceived less, a non threat, inconspicuous. Less likely to be called upon in class, ignored by bullies.
There followed a long heavy silence as the two sat in the room not knowing how or finding it difficult to approach this discussion. Eventually Rogrig swiveled around in his chair facing away from Harry, trying to distance himself further from the moment.
Harry sighed contentedly and flopped back onto his bed clutching the key to him like the treasure it was.
Cursing himself again for dropping into innocence like an idiot, this was gonna be ten times harder because of it. And he’d look mighty suspicious dropping it now.
“It’s quite the dangerous tightrope you’re walking, Heir Potter… I get the impression you know you're walking it, but I don’t think you know how far you could fall…” Rogrig tilted his face towards the ceiling and loosed a long thread of smoke.
Harry found he couldn't help himself as Rogrig led him through the ornate back hallways of Gringotts he asked. "So you won't be needing a parent's permission or anything to like… Grant access for withdrawals?"
Which was how he ended up here, frustrated on a train from Paddington on his way back to Little Whinging softly crying with an owl in his lap.
Tom finished with them and turned, smoothly drawing his wand and pointing it at Harry making him flinch. With a silent wave of his wand Harry soon felt the loud din of the dining room drop to a dull roar, like he was suddenly 5 rooms down the hall and not standing right in the middle of it!
Harry mentally took a deep breath, he still had the advantage, he was the customer, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He was just being a bit rude. Tom definitely didn't just permanently deafen him.
“Just walking into my!” He spluttered around the popsicle in his mouth freezer door still open and in his hand.
“I learned to summon my vault key Hedwig, it took a lot of stress to get it but now that we have it I can finally get some answers.”
“Good good,” Rogrig said taking the key from Harry’s hands. “Now I want you to focus on that feeling and I want you to imagine the key as best you can. I can feel it’s tied itself to you now, if you picture it clearly enough and give it a tug it will come to you, now go ahead and give it a try.” So saying Rogrig got up from his desk with a huff of smoke and exited his office taking Harry’s vault key with him.
"I'll be out all day today. It may be best.. Safest, to entertain yourself till this evening. I should be back by then." She gave a quiet hoot in return, and with a few more pets he opened the window and she flew silently out and into the pre-dawn light.
When Harry finally figured this out it broke him for weeks, there was nothing he could do to change it. They would never love him. It had to do with who he was, with what he was. While it cut him deeply it was also something he needed to realize. Without this key card in his deck he would’ve never been able to properly play the game against the Dursleys. It had to do with his expectations of the Dursleys, knowing they hated him to his roots shifted how he approached them in turn. It was this insight that sparked Harry’s nearly perfect run, what got him out of the cupboard and into their good graces. He was the
Eventually Rogrig came to the end of the documents, Harry's head swimming with history and the intricacies of business dealings, holdings, and ownership laws. He was supremely grateful to have Rogrig leading him through this.
Harry couldn’t help but enjoy himself, he’d never had the opportunity to be crotchety, he’d never even had the opportunity too whine. It was oddly freeing.
With a gasp Harry saw light pool down from the upstairs hall, and heard a worried Vernon call down, "Petunia dear?"
The added recognizability in the wizarding world would make this particularly difficult to pull off. And even if adult wizards were fine with 11 year olds moving about on their own he found his fame new and very challenging. The experience of being so seen in The Leaky Cauldron when Hagrid had brought him in made him very uncomfortable. He didn't like losing control of his narrative.
Harry seemed to instantly realize just how completely out of his depth he was. He had no clue how anything worked! It's literally why he was here! How could he be so stupid. Blindly moving on his assumptions.
“Agh!” Vernon yelped, jumping back when three letters flew through a gap in the poorly sealed window and slapped him in the face.
“That concludes, your families account histories, much of which you may find irrelevant but many wizarding families are old and some business deals are hundreds of years old, a few of your own included.” Rogrig said, dragging from his cigarellos.
What was that!? He’d been thrown. What had this man done to him! Harry was quietly panicking and doing his best not to show it.
It was a bit too easy now. He was obviously expecting this a bit, but he was still second guessing in the moments before it became a reality, he wasn’t sure it was possible, he thought he was being unrealistic to think they would be scared of him. But he’d enter a room and any one of the Dursleys would find any excuse to leave it.
Harry ordered dinner and then proceeded to talk Tom’s ear off about his “outlandish pricing”, how the chill in the room was affecting his bones, and the subpar quality of his soup, even going so far as to ask intrusive questions like: “How long have you been without teeth?”
He rattled the door, pulling the knob and stressing the lock, too caught up in his panic to unlock it first. He looked back quickly to see the dark blob of Aunt Petunia dazed just sitting up.
The process for verifying Harry’s identity was a lot less complicated than he’d assumed. Harry was sitting in a plush chair in an office walled entirely in mahogany, Rogrig sat across from him behind the large desk with gold filigree inlays. A wall that looked to be made entirely of filing cabinets loomed over the scene.
Harry had watched Hagrid pin a literal pigs tail on Dudley, which might’ve been the best moment of his life. Except Hagrid had basically pinned a target to Harry’s back in the same instant, then bought him a ticket home.
His first year history text was the most helpful book he had on hand, giving him an incredibly dated glimpse into the wizarding world and a name for his owl. Harry wasn’t sure if Goblin wars were still happening but they sure were an issue back then. He doubted he picked up anything useful.
The man grunted in that way older folks do when they sit anywhere, like their knees were never meant to do what they do. Kneeling next to Harry he placed a hand on his shoulder… Bless his inconvenient heart.
“Your vaults have remained dormant since the last Head of House Potter passed, and have suffered a net loss since the war Heir Potter. This is partly due to the drain caused by your family's considerable contribution to the war effort, and partly due to the lack of a Head steering it through the rocky more turbulent moments that happen in all economies.” Rogrig puffed. “However not to worry, the Potters of the past have set up a considerable amount of passive income, which has rarely faltered. What was lost can be gained again.. I will draw up an investment strategy for when we next meet and with your approval we can begin recouping your losses.”
It’d been 4 days since his trip to Diagon Alley, and Harry considered the Dursleys' reaction to the events of the days prior a bit anticlimactic if he was being honest.
It took Harry around a half an hour to finally summon it to him for the first time, cursing his focus throughout the whole ordeal. When it finally did come he was startled by it knocking him over the head, then quickly overjoyed by his success picking it up off the floor. Rogrig came in not soon after, absent his now trademarked cigarellos, patting his stomach and using the sharp end of a bone to pick at his sharp teeth.
His anger had shifted since Hagrid’s revelation. He couldn’t stop thinking about how he was apparently some big hero and no one had thought to check up on him. How he was expected to just go back. He was having a hard time blaming Hagrid, he was truthfully rather dim and he didn't seem to know much anyway. He was only the messenger. Harry shouldn’t. Couldn’t expect him to do more than he had, he’d done more than enough already. More than the Dursleys had done in 10 years.
Rogrig snorted. "Why would you need Albus Dumbledore's permission to access your own vaults, Heir Potter?"
The sun was high in the sky when Harry finally managed to make his way to Charing Cross Road. He’d sent Hedwig off on her own, reassuring her he was fine and telling her to come find him tonight. Wherever he ended up. He’d decided almost immediately after his tears had dried that he couldn’t return to the Dursleys. Anytime he thought about it his heart started racing and his breathing hitched. He just couldn't, there was no way.
He looked over his shoulder at the now blonde boy, “let's get your identity verified and see if we can’t find you the answers you seek.”
“No I really appreciated Rogrig, it was fun to hear about my family I’ve always wondered about them, I never thought I’d learn so many interesting little things about them.”
This is my attempt at writing a manipulative, sneaky and morally grey Harry Potter, a Slytherin Harry if you will. I'm obviously not the first to do this, and I'm sure I won't be the last. Hopefully I haven't ouroborosed myself to badly by reading all the other good Slytherin Harry fics out there, but hey this is for fun! We're having fun!
“Uncle Vernon! It’s me! Harry!” He shouted finally catching up just as a biscuit tin sailed past him and rolled into the door. Looking up he saw Uncle Vernon with the kitchen knife pointed shakily at him, his popsicle hanging limply from his mouth.
“There may be magical ways of altering one's appearance.” Rogrig continued drawing from his cigarellos. “Minor ones could be found in joke shops. Items to effect more major and longer lasting, harder to conceive changes could be found in certain shops in Knockturn Alley, an apothecary maybe.” Rogrig finished looking at the glowing end of one of his cigarellos.
Having read through it he decided the drawbacks were that it only lasted for an hour, and when it popped it did so with a loud noise and a good bit of confetti like the muggle version Harry was familiar with. Not exactly subtle Harry thought, and it was extremely temporary, but it was the best thing he’d seen in the shop.
Harry realized with a shutter he was trapped, she was giving him that same look she had given him last night. A dreadfully cold scowl that he hadn’t seen in years.
The energy in the room chilled, the color draining from everyone but Harry’s face at the presence of his wand. Harry swore he could hear their pulses quickening..
loud in here! I must insist you do something about this noise!” Harry’s voice gave a wavering little whine at the end.
“What in God’s name did you do to your hair!” Vernon steamrolled over Harry, and truthfully he was thankful Uncle Vernon had. Harry had forgotten about his hair, now though he found himself stuttering mentally trying to think of an excuse.
“I, uh, well I actually don’t have it on me..” There was a roughly six second pause as the goblin, named Rogrig according to the nameplate, finished the line he was reading only to lower it with a distinctly put upon air.
Harry landed prone on his stomach. The shock of falling seemed to knock air back into his lungs, he let in a sudden sharp breath and scrambled up to his feet on broken glass heart still thudding in his chest he turned and ran towards the front door away from the cupboard! Away from Petunia! Away!
Harry knew he needed to play his next move right or the man would escort him to a telephone box and try to get a hold of a guardian. The last thing Harry needed to do was wake up the Dursleys, they’d be obligated to come get him or lose face Then worst yet they'd find the fifty note he’d stolen. Harry didn't just have money, he was 11 and Harry Potter.
“Never too soon to prepare” Harry replied adding a bit of a nasally whine to his voice while looking down at his shoes for anonymity. He placed 3 Galleons on the counter.
“Morning there, welcome in!” A busy Tom greeted over the low roar of his patrons passively waving at the door from the bar, eyes still on the tea he was pouring. Hood up Harry moved through the brunch crowd and decided he’d place himself near the entrance of Diagon Alley and slip in with a group.
“Yes sir, uh my aunt actually, I’m visiting.” With a bit of quick thinking Harry chose a man on the other side of the ticket gate and pointed. “My father escorted me to the gates, he’s over there… Said he’d wait to see me on the train proper.” Harry gave the man a wave, and the blessed bloody idiot waved back looking bemused.
The next morning went much the same as yesterday, Harry set himself to wake earlier than the Dursleys, sent Hedwig out till he returned and dressed in something that would allow him to blend into the background, and left grabbing his concealer and wand on the way.
What he needed was a guide to the magical world itself, maybe a book about recent events, finding some more information about his unique situation would be ideal. But Hagrid had been strict, frugal and surprisingly efficient about his school shopping, only picking out the required books from his first year book list, and only picking up standard level instruments.
Harry passed many shops he hadn’t seen on his last two visits to the alley, noting with a passive interest some of the side streets off Diagon Alley. Like Horizont Alley and with more tentative glances, the entrance to Knockturn Alley.
Harry wasn't sure he'd ever seen so many numbers before. “So what does this all, um mean?” He asked hesitantly, not understanding or really knowing what to do with the stacks of papers set before him.
“Don’t you dare lie to me boy. I had 80 pounds, set aside for this week's groceries and 50 went missing yesterday. It wasn’t Dudley. It wasn’t Vernon. It must’ve been you, and here I find you with your grubby little hands in my purse.” She seethed herding him into a corner trapped between the coat rack and the locked front door.
But Harry suspected it’d work here, he was basing this decision on his last visit to Gringotts. The goblins had become increasingly irritated at Hagrids pleasantries and Harry suspected they found such “niceties” annoying more than anything. He was hoping a direct almost terse approach was the play to make.
He sat up again. He reached for the wand he was using lately and stepped into his slippers. Downstairs, because he was starting to think it was the front door of the shop.
“I would if I knew,” he said honestly. “He showed up in the middle of the night, soaked to the skin, and asked me for my help. I’m giving him my help. That’s as much as I can tell you.”
?” Draco asked. “If I’m not mistaken, that was an enormous box of chocolates — if you’re not partial, I assure you, Neville and I would have cheerfully polished them off for you. And anyway, you
Draco’s expression was odd. Fond, but bemused. Still he couldn’t resist looking at that flash of pale skin.
Draco glanced at the clock over the Floo; it was probably time to go home, perhaps make himself something to eat. Helpfully, the clock’s hands were at ‘time to go home’ and ‘time to eat’, so he thought he was probably on the right track. The sun had almost set; the long days in the summer always made it easy to lose track of time and work too late. He stretched in his chair and was about to summon Rubino when he heard a knock at his door. He glanced at the clock again, and the hands had both settled at ‘something unusual is happening’.
“What can I say. Auror vigilance,” he said. “And I didn’t get much of the crackling. Can you pass the pumpkin juice, please, Malfoy? See, I do have manners.”
Draco nodded. “I know that. When someone hands you two different types of poison, and tells you that you can choose which one to take, it’s not much of a choice at all, is it?”
that Draco could seek out? Harry’s life, so far as Draco could figure, was one fucking nightmare after another with very little rest in between, unless one chose to count his rapidly approaching demise. There had to be something else.
Fuck, he’d been out only a few hours, and as much as he knew it was time to go home, he missed it. The good days, anyway, days when Draco wouldn’t let him out of bed, or when they cooked side by side in the kitchen or talked in the sitting room with their bare feet stretched out toward the fire.
“Er,” Potter replied, his brow furrowing. “Is this supposed to make me feel better, Malfoy? Because —”
One of the most amusing days of Draco’s very strange visit to Harry’s home was the day that Andromeda and Teddy appeared unannounced.
“Madam Pomfrey would have been able to handle this, you know,” Harry said, not unkindly. “Why did you call me?”
Harry shrugged. “Alright. It took them some time to clean it out. There was a lot of…” No point in finishing that sentence. “But with the beautiful grounds, and the clean air — they moved the Janus Thickey Ward there. St Mungo’s needed the space, and so did the ward. That takes up the west wing. The east is an orphanage. There were a lot of children…”
Harry was reasonably sure he’d heard something similar before, but he was feeling peaceful and calm and he didn’t particularly want to try to remember where. “I’m sure you’re right.”
“I’m not interested in finding a bride,” he said. “I… Malfoy, I shouldn’t be here,” he said, urgently, and with so much regret, and the almost overwhelming desire to embrace his inner Gryffindor and snog Malfoy silly, just so he’d know once and for all. “It was kind of your mother,” he repeated, and tried to pull away.
“I think I’m going to bed. Goodnight.” And he stood up stiffly and formally, Auror Potter once again, and Hermione’s heart hurt. He was heading for the stairs, but turned around to speak once again.
. He’d been told that his name on that stupid scrap of parchment was a binding contract, and he had no choice.
A steaming cup floated gently into his hand. Earl Grey, with a slice of lemon. He hadn’t wanted to ask for that, but he was glad the lemon was there. He took a sip. “Thank you, this is perfect.”
“No,” Hermione said, firmly. She lifted Dora off Harry’s shoulder and kissed her irritable little face, before depositing her on the couch. She turned a bone white which matched the sofa beautifully, apparently preparing to launch herself at Crookshanks. “I want to come.”
.” He had the feeling that their surroundings had changed, but he didn’t want to open his eyes to check; he could rely, he thought, on the shift from damp tile grout and cold night air to the smell of thick dust and carpet mildew. They were, he suspected, in the sitting room at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. He felt Harry moving; his arms slipping around Draco’s waist, his head resting on Draco’s stomach. Draco reached down, his fingers carding through Harry’s hair.
“We did, didn’t we,” Harry said fondly. His shoulders had relaxed, and he smiled a little, and he took a step closer again. Draco stilled him, taking his hand, and Harry’s smile faltered.
“Ouch,” Draco replied drily. “Never mind, then.” His smile was brisk, and professional. “I thought you might like to stay at my villa. I have a tower guest room with a view over the water. Plenty of books, access to the hospital via the Floo — I think I need to engage someone else to be your Healer, from now on, but I think it’s a good option.” He raised his hand. “I can hear you, you know, thinking so loudly — oh, Malfoy, I couldn’t possibly impose; oh, Malfoy, I know a Healer in Britain who owes me and will sign off on me going back to work, wouldn’t you prefer I got out from under your feet? Oh, Malfoy — blah blah fucking blah Chosen One needs to get back to work.”
“It was kind,” Draco agreed. “She’d like me to marry, and be happy. I know it’s hard to hear, but once, she and my father were very good together. But my father wanted power, and my mother wanted… respectability, and happiness.” Draco slipped his hand from Harry’s hip to his lower back. They were almost flush together.
Half an hour later, they were back at Draco’s work counter, and Draco was offering small pieces of advice as Harry prepared the ingredients — he was so slow at it, and Draco wanted to be frustrated. But he would look at the intense concentration on Harry’s face, and the shadows under his eyes, and remember telling him he was rubbish at potions and just like that he’d find himself speaking quietly, soothingly instead, as if he was helping little Amelia, and not the Boy Who Lived, Scourge of Dark Wizards, highest ranked Auror of his age in over three centuries.
The days went by. Luna replied that dinner at the Leaky would have to wait until she was back from a trip to Iceland to look for ice bats (Harry wasn’t sure they existed, but Luna was frequently right about things like that and Harry had learned not to assume
“Well,” she said, taking off her heavy coat and hanging it on the rack. “Ron and I will start lunch, then. I hope you’re hungry, Draco.”
“Sold,” Harry said. “The money was more helpful than the properties could have been. You did a good thing, you know.”
It was several days later when Blaise finally re-appeared from his mission. He was as straight-backed as always in his Unspeakable robes and as affectionate as ever once he’d been carefully relieved of them. He didn’t talk about his mission, but only because their time was sacred, not because Hermione wasn’t to know.
“Ah, that’s why Hermione was demanding your wand when she finally laid eyes on me again — makes sense.” He sounded bitter. “She wanted to hex my bollocks off in a
“I try to manage without it,” Harry said, quietly, and sounding very much like he was ashamed to have been caught out. “It’s not good to take too much.”
“Very unlikely.” Harry laughed, and stood up. “Thank you, Headmaster. I do appreciate it. But I promise you, I don’t need a plan B. I’m doing well, you know. I have therapy, I have friends, I’m about halfway through renovating Grimmauld Place — I’m good. And I’ll be a great Auror, just you wait and see.”
And one night, when Ron had been called away on some kind of Auror business, Hermione came to visit on her own. Unscheduled. At first, Harry thought she was worried about Ron, but when she produced Thai food and beer he realised she just wanted to talk to him alone.
“Hermione’s a bloody genius, isn’t she,” he said, turning away, because the satchel reminded him of the tiny beaded purse they’d all lived out of for so many months.
“There is a world of difference between watching out for unexpected love potions, and screening for highly concealed dark magic; but I should think that for the near future, Draco’s mail should come through you.” Her mouth was tight and angry. “The packages, at the very least.”
Draco stared at his glass. He didn’t want to have this conversation. He’d very carefully skirted it for several hours with Neville fucking Longbottom only days before, though Neville had read him as easily as if Draco had written the truth all over his face.
Hermione cleared her throat. “Well,” she said. “He likes to get out into the community. There has been a lot of building, of course. There are three new orphanages since the war and Harry is very passionate about that.”
“Thank you,” Hermione said again, and if she thought Draco’s breath might have hitched for a moment, she was too considerate to mention it.
“Like what?” Hermione asked; Harry had been the first of the three of them to accept that he wasn’t going to get through without help, but like so many others, one by one they had all begun to make their way to acceptance. “Come back to school? Harry, it doesn’t matter that they’ve waived your NEWTs and let you into Auror training — you should finish, just so you know you
They sat in silence for a long time. Ron’s eyes trickled tears; Harry didn’t think he even knew, but they flowed, one after the other, healing and cleaning, Harry hoped. Corroding and burning was the less desirable option.
were his home. He would be glad to see that awful family tree gone from the wall. And how you’ve brought in the light. Not the House of Black, not any more. The House of Potter.”
“Merlin’s liver-spotted arse,” Ginny said suddenly, her eyes lighting up. “Harry has a bloke here. Is it anyone we know, Harry?”
He didn’t let himself wonder if without Harry’s stupid famous shadow over him he’d have far more chances to shine. He did let himself remember all the nights where Ron had patiently tried to teach Harry a more strategic approach to chess, and Harry had gone dizzy, continuing to alternate between aggressive and defensive play without any kind of long term strategy.
Harry dragged a folded-up footstool out of his cupboard and pulled it into the kitchen, in front of the sink. And he began to run the water to wash the dishes, favouring his left arm but refusing to make a sound.
than me needs to be the one to do it. Ron — I want a gentler life. I hope you can find a way to understand. You know what I’m like. I can see it now; hating my job and still running in ahead of everyone to make sure if anyone gets hurt, it’s me, and not them —”
“Really, Harry, European house-elves aren’t so prudish as their British counterparts. And it’s not like you’ve got your knob out. And a bottle of the Sangiovese, thank you, Rubino.”
“Hope so,” Harry said, and he was gone. He found somewhere out of the way to disapparate from and went home to change his clothes, presenting himself at Ollivander’s at nine sharp. He caught sight of himself in a mirror and blushed; he looked exactly like someone who’d gotten laid the night before. Well, maybe he wouldn’t be offered any marriage proposals that day.
“We’ll try it again. Perhaps on the weekend, with no one around who might startle you. I have some seventh year students who sometimes do their own work quietly on a Saturday afternoon. I’m sure you’d be welcome.”
When Harry woke in the morning, he was alone on the bed. He stretched, and grinned; Draco was probably making coffee, or wrestling with Scamp for the Daily Prophet. Harry let his eyes close, and waited a moment.
“We should celebrate.” He rolled over in Draco’s arms. He didn’t move, for a long time, just memorising all over again every line on his face, the pale grey of his irises, those impossibly long eyelashes, golden where the light caught.
The first month after the end of the war — that was the easiest. There was a sense of celebration, even amidst all the funerals and mourning. Everyone had
“I know.” Draco hands shook and shook. He wondered when it had started. The end of fourth year, maybe, when he’d seen the crumpled body of Cedric Diggory on the ground outside the labyrinth and Harry screaming. Maybe later that night, seeing his ashen father clutch his arm. “Do you think he’ll protect my parents? My mother, at least. If I asked him. Would he help?”
“Oh, I’d say you were a solid Wesley,” Draco replied airily. “No… a little higher than that. I assume he still eats with his fingers.”
Blaise howled with laughter. “Yes, but I think stepdad number three did as well. Oh, there’s a summer room off the side — very nice. Show me the bedrooms, then? It really does seem like a lot of work, all of this. Lovely, though. There aren’t enough of the really old Wizarding homes left these days.” He stepped into one of the larger bedrooms. “Fantastic. It’s much too big for one person on his own, of course,” Blaise mused, and Harry’s stomach twisted.
“Oh, no,” Harry said, shaking his head. “A friend spent the night. In the guest room. I’d forgotten, for — anyway,” he said, when she looked worryingly like she might start asking questions. Mrs Anand still had a lot of friends at the Prophet. “I could repair her, though it would be a very delicate job, and I don’t believe that she would ever be able to focus and channel magic properly again. I could put her in stasis, so you could display her as an heirloom.”
A minute later, Draco handed him a large vial with a heavy stopper. “I assume you know the dosage. I’ll put the rest of this aside, for now, and give some to Madam Pomfrey. Just let me know when you need more.”
Once inside Draco’s bedroom Harry realised he was idiotically wearing boots with about fifty holes for laces, which was very fucking inconvenient, but an issue rendered moot when the intense desire to be naked, to be able to look at Draco and touch him everywhere meant that his own magic swirled out and the rest of their clothing fell from their bodies. They didn’t have to pause in their kissing; the kisses got hotter, and dirtier, and hungrier, and Harry couldn’t make his hands stay in one place; he set his thumbs against the sharp grooves of Draco’s hips, gripped his arse hard, ran his palms up over Draco’s back, counting every bump.
