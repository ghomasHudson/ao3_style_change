"Whatever, come on let's go." Harry followed Draco, still chuckling softly. They reached the hallway, and Harry changed drastically. His eyes widened, his breaths short and shallow, his entire body trembling. He crouched down against a wall, staring at wall across them, where a door would appear with just three paces.
And then there was a soft chuckle, and Draco looked for who it was under the cloak. His eyes locked on George, who had his head down slightly, but Draco was positive it was him. And then the other's noticed, and suddenly Ginny was screaming at him again.
"You never told me you and Draco were together." She gave a knowing smirk, and Harry felt his cheeks heat up.
Draco looked taken aback. He was definitely not expecting that. But he wasn't a kid anymore, and such matters did seem rather childish now. "Alright," he said, closing his eyes again, a small smile forming as the trio turned away.
Harry, Ron and I have agreed to end this foolish rivalry with you. We apologize for what we've said or done in the past. We hope you can forgive us, and our friendship is and always will be, available to you." Ron gave her a look at that. "Oh, and you can call me Hermione."
"Hermione and I are dating," she stated simply, holding up their hands that were laced together. Ron started cheering, but quickly stopped and turned beet red as he was the only one. The room was deadly silent, filled with shocked looks, and one smirk from Blaise.
Harry hugged his mother one last time before he left, promising to write at least once a week. With a final nod towards his father, he headed off towards the train, looking for a compartment. When he found an empty one, he slid inside and shut the door behind him, flopping onto the seat.
The end of September rolled around, October coming to greet them. Harry was getting worse, but he kept this from his friends. He had glamours on, to cover the dark circles under his eyes. He wore either his robes, or a hoodie, hoping to cover up his malnourished body. He hid the broken inside him.
Dean and Seamus sat down on the couch, Seamus's head resting in Dean's lap. Seamus closed his eyes, while Dean played with his hair.
"Thank you," she whispered, looking him dead in the eye. "I know you two aren't exactly on the best terms." He nodded, and looked back to Harry. He had stopped trembling, but his clothes were drenched in sweat, and he was in a deep sleep. Draco let out a sigh of relief, relaxing in his chair. Hermione watched him curiously.
She muttered under her breath as she ran to Harry, trying to pick him up, but Draco held on. "Mr. Malfoy you have to let go." He looked up at her, and she sighed at the tears in his eyes. "Very well, put him down here," she said, pointing at one of the beds. Draco walked over, and set the boy down, pulling up a chair for himself as Madame Pomfrey began a chain of spells. Ron and Hermione pulled up chairs themselves, watching Draco with confused expressions. It was going to be a long night.
"It's not really what. Well, it is, but...just...it's kinda a place. I'll take you there tomorrow, ok?"
"Why? And I'm not really allowed to say anyway, and I won't go against my word," she said, and paused, before adding, "unless you give my good reason." The boys beamed at her.
Draco eyes widened, the fear evident in them. "Shoot, I need to find him right now." He got up quickly,, but Hermione grabbed his wrist before he could run off.
was that I like you so much. Ha ha..." He kept rambling, and it was actually quite adorable, in Harry's opinion.
"Poor Harry," Ron whispered to Hermione, who was his partner. It had been a bit awkward at first, but things slowly shifted back to the way they had been before. Hermione laughed and shook her head. "What's so funny?"
Each second hurt worse than the last, and it was too hard to believe the redhead was really gone. Harry's throat burned from crying so much, his cheeks stung from the salty tears.
"Stinging hex," Draco replied simply, not in the mood to go into further detail. Harry let out a sigh of relief, though he knew the blond wouldn't have gone too far.
"Let me see them," Harry repeated. He looked serious. Draco sighed, and started unbuttoning his shirt. When he finished Harry took a step closer. He looked at what he'd done, and horror was written all over his face. "I did that to you?" Draco nodded again, words failing him once again. Harry looked away, refusing  to look at the pain he'd caused any longer.
He shifted in the bed, causing Draco to wake. "Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you," Harry whispered. Draco muttered something inaudible, and fell back asleep, his head resting on the side of the bed. Harry sighed, and reached for his wand. He cast a tempus charm; it was three in the morning. He let himself fall back asleep, not knowing he'd regret it later.
"We really screwed up last night. You should have seen Harry a couple minutes ago, I thought he was going to kill me. Oh, and, is it possible I could be imagining things?"
"Very well. Shall we have dinner then?" the man asked, standing up. He folded the paper, setting it down where he'd been sitting, and began walking towards the dining room, motioning for the two to follow. Harry already felt bad for dragging Ginny into this, but he knew James would be expecting him to have a girlfriend sooner or later.
"Well obviously, Ronald. Now go away, I'm still mad at you." Ron rolled his eyes and walked out of the Great Hall, Dean and Seamus following quickly behind.
"Ginny stop. I can't get back together with you." He took a deep breath, before continuing. "I think we should break up, like, officially this time. I'm no good for you, you'll end up dead. And besides, your like a sister to me." Ginny gave a small laugh, partially because she was so relieved.
He sat down in the grass, feeling a small morning breeze in the air. It smelled like it was going to rain, which was a bit odd since the sky was nearly clear, hardly a cloud in sight. Harry didn't mind though, he loved the smell of rain, it was so...calming. He took a deep whiff of it, then sighed.
"Is he ok? I heard screaming and..." Hermione looks down at Harry. She walks over, and sits next to him. "Harry, hey look at me." Harry looks up. "I need you to tell me about your nightmare. What happened?" She used a calm, soothing voice. Harry shakes his head no. "Harry, come on. Talking might help."
He couldn't live alone with his father, he was terrified of him. Maybe it was unreasonable, he was fifteen after all, but if he even knew Draco and Harry were friends, he'd...Harry didn't even want to think about it.
He pulled back, keeping his hands on Harry's shoulders, studying the boys face carefully. "What do you mean you like me? Expand on that, please." Harry gulped.
When it ended, both boys were struggling to keep their eyes open. "How'd you like it?" Ron yawned. Blaise didn't answer, merely dropped his head on the other's shoulder, and dozed off. Ron stared at Blaise in shock, before falling asleep himself, head casually resting on the Slytherin's.
"Wait," he said suddenly, "we aren't married yet!" And with that, Draco leaned forward and pressed his lips against Harry's, because that's what toddlers thought kissing was, lips touching one another.
Dora was enjoying herself, and Teddy was, well he was the reason most were laughing. His hair and eye color kept changing, and his nose had even changed for a second. Harry remembered when Tonks would keep everyone, especially Hermione and Ginny, laughing endlessly during meals. He gave a sad smile at the thought.
"Are you done yet?" the blond spat out, glaring at the girl in front of him. She opened her mouth to respond but stopped when someone cleared their throat. The pair glanced at the doorway, and Draco could have died on the spot. He wished he had.
"Alright, enough chitchat, I want answers. Apologies in advance to you, Hermione, I know this really isn't how you wanted to tell Harry." Harry nearly died from surprise, if that was possible. It did seem to make a bit of sense now that he thought about it, but he was still surprised.
The two stopped under a tree, Harry instantly sitting against it's trunk. "I think I like her," he said weakly, and a bit shakily.
The Gryffindor swam up to Hermione and looked around for something to help with the rope. He noticed a sharp rock at the bottom and quickly retrieved it before making his way back to his bushy-haired friend.
They set off for the hospital wing, chatting briefly along the way. Harry fell asleep in Draco's arms before they were even halfway.
"Ask him," Ron said, opening the door further so Neville was in view. The two stepped in. Apparently, Neville hadn't even known Harry was meeting a person. Ron thought Harry had a secret girlfriend. Not the most reliable information, but Dean and Seamus wrote their names on the list, though they didn't say what for. They left, leaving Neville and Ron alone again.
"Because she's dating Pansy." Harry's mouth dropped open, though he wasn't jealous anymore. In fact, he felt a whole lot better knowing she didn't like Draco.
After Harry had left, Neville went to Ron, who was in his room. He explained what had happened, while Ron listened, very intrigued.
Tomorrow was Halloween, and the Great Hall was already being set up for the occasion. Harry glared at the decorations as he walked in, blaming them for his sour mood. Ron and Hermione noticed his snappy behavior today, and found it best to give him some space for the next few days.
He fought with his own mind, trying to push the pictures clear to the back of his mind, but they would only keep resurfacing.
Hermione set down the paper, mouth agape and eyes wide. Umbridge and Nott were dead? Had Theo really been controlled the entire time he was doing those horrid things? Was Umbridge really mental? This article raised hundreds of questions, all making Hermione's head spin. By now Pansy, Blaise, and Ginny had all read the article, too.
Again, he pushed it down. It was then that he became aware he was on the ground, two bodies hovering over him. He felt nauseous, and his hands were trembling slightly.
"Answer me!" he yelled, making Harry jump. He was eighteen, he shouldn't be so scared of his dad raising his voice.
"You disgust me," James growled through gritted teeth. " Get the fuck out of my house, faggot, I've dealt with you long enough. Go live with your fucking boyfriend, and you can join him, Sirius, Remus, and all the rest in hell. GO!"
"Well, since you guys were always disappearing and such, we all assumed that Harry had a girlfriend he wasn't telling us about."
"Of course not," he lied easily. "It was an exaggeration." Draco rolled his eyes, and looked back at the boy. Just behind the Weasel, he saw Harry walking up to them. "Harry! I've been looking all over for you," Draco said, maneuvering around the ginger and pulling Harry into a hug.
"But...but..." Pretzel's large eyes filled with tears, and she turned away so her master wouldn't see her so sad. But it was too late, for he had already seen.
They walked into an office that smelled a bit weird. Then someone in a blue outfit asked him to sit on this bed covered in paper, that made a horribly annoying noise every time he moved. She checked him eyes, ears, nose, throat. Then she took out this hammer-looking this, and whacked his knees with it, making them shoot up. That's when everything clicked on his brain. He waited for the nurse to leave, and eventually she did.
"We know, but he needs to stay somewhere while word gets out. Can we just notify the staff, family, and close friends first. I don't think we need the whole school talking about it right now," Pansy said, a pleading look in her eyes. Madame Pomfrey nodded, and led him over to a hospital bed, which coincidentally happened to be the same one he'd occupied near the end of third year. Hermione tried not to think about it.
"Defense Against the Dark Arts." Dinner continued, with small chitchat, and as promised, Harry was shown some adorable photos of Super-Draco afterwards. Days flew by, Harry and Draco getting closer, if even possible.
Dean and Seamus grew worried, and tried to get him to eat. Neville tried to get him to sleep. Draco tried to help him with his work. Harry told Dean and Seamus he would grab a bite in the kitchen before the next class. He would lay in bed until he heard Neville's snores, then get up again.
He burst into the room, and the two broke apart quickly, turning with annoyed looks to see who had interrupted their snogging session.
"Your right, we have bigger things to worry about then a petty rivalry." He glanced at Malfoy, who was in the same position he had been in when he first sat down. His eyes were closed, but he wasn't asleep.
The door to the dormitory creaked open, not that Harry heard, and a muffled voice was speaking. Ron's voice.
"It's a surprise. Now grab my hand." He did, and Draco apparated them, the familiar feeling of being squeezed through a tube making Harry feel sick. He hated apparating. "We're here, you can open your eyes now.
"So, should we start then?" Pansy asked cheerfully, opening up her book to where the instructions were, even though they were right there on the board.
"She's a girl, and girl's have cooties. I don't want cooties, Papa." Harry laughed, and picked the small boy up, placing him  on top of his shoulders. Teddy shrieked, and grabbed fistfuls of Harry's hair to steady himself. Harry walked into the living room, and found Hermione and Pansy sitting on the couch, Rose in between them, sitting upside down blowing hair out of her face. Her face brightened when she saw the boy atop Harry's shoulders.
The death of his parents forgotten in the chaos, Harry actually had an ok Halloween. He spent the rest of the day with Hermione and Draco in the hospital wing, though he'd be out tomorrow. He was now required to take a potion every morning to get him properly nourished, as well as easing back into more food. That was when he gave up with keeping secrets like this from his friends, because with their help everything was easier. This year may not be so bad after all.
"Oh Merlin! I forgot to tell Harry!" The boys were confused. They had figured that Harry and Draco had become friends because of Harry and Pansy's relationship. Now they really needed answers.
"I'm telling you 'Mione, Harry's got a secret girlfriend or something!" Ron stated. The two had noticed Harry's frequent disappearances. And he was happier than before. Not quite happy yet, but happier.
Draco looked over to Harry, who hadn't even acknowledged the others in the room, not that they had spoken to him yet. Ginny broke off from him, and he made his way back over to Harry. Sitting down in the spot he'd been in before, he could hear the uneven breaths coming from the boy next to him.
"SHUT UP RON! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE A NORMAL PERSON ONE MINUTE, AND THEN FIND OUT YOUR A COMPLETE FREAK THE NEXT!"
"Alright, these will be your roommates for the year. Potter and Longbottom," Neville and Harry high-fived at this, causing McGonagall to glare at them before continuing. "Malfoy and Nott, Zabini and Weasley, Thomas and Finnigan..." she proceeded to read off the names until finished for everyone.
"I'm just going to show him my room if that's alright with you mother." She nodded, and Draco grabbed Harry's trembling hand and dragged him inside. Harry gulped, looking at the familiar setting. Draco led him through the house, and Harry thought he heard a faint scream. His head had snapped up from where he'd been staring at the ground in seconds. His eyes widened when he saw Ron looking at him with wild eyes, before screaming Hermione's name repeatedly. He stumbled backwards, the warmth of Draco's hand leaving him.
"He paid me quite a few visits in second year. Kept trying to kill me, he did. Unintentionally, of course. But I told him to stop, he didn't listen. He kept saving me, and then he..." A conversation that had started out lighthearted was rapidly escalating, and the lump in Harry's throat burned, the tears in his eyes threatening to spill over.
"Draco..." the boy croaked. His head felt like twenty thestrals were sitting on it, and his body stung all over.
"That was the most impressive and scary thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Ginny can be quite frightening when she wants to be."
Ron chuckled lightly. "Can you imagine Harry's face right now if he were to wake up surrounded by the three people he'd want to see least of all." Draco snorted. "We should probably leave before he wakes up and murders us all." Hermione hesitated, before standing up.
"R-ron?" he whispered, his voice cracking at the end. But then the screaming stopped, and Ron faded away. Harry was vaguely aware of the comforting whispers in his ear, or the arms wrapped around him. He stared at the wall in front of him, faint screams still ringing in his ear. Eventually the world faded to black as he fell into a calming sleep.
"I'm fine," he said, getting up a bit to quickly, causing him to get dizzy and fall over. He stayed on the ground, waiting for the black spots dotting his vision went away.
"Harry! Thank Merlin you're here, the food was starting to get cold." The Gryffindor flinched when Mrs. Weasley gave him a giant hug, and gave Draco a pleading look. The blond only chuckled, even more when Harry scowled at him playfully.
fell a bit in love with him right then. "Would you like to meet my friend?" Draco asked, pulling away slightly. Pretzel nodded timidly, and she took small steps towards Harry.
Neville answered the door. "Is Harry here?" Neville looked back, before opening the door wider to let Ginny in. There was Harry, on his bed, staring off into nothing, his eyes glossy, though the water never left his eyes. "Harry?" Ginny whispered, her heart breaking a little. How could she do this to him, right now, when he's so vulnerable? But she had to, she couldn't keep lying to him, or herself.
The three continued for another hour, before Operation Drarry finally had an organized, detailed plan. The only problem, was that they needed a certain stubborn blond ferret in on it for the plan to actually work.
He had the blade in his hand, all he had to do was press it to his skin, and drag it up, letting the blood trickle down his hand. But he knew if he did, the self-hatred would only grow. It would spread through his body, a fire he couldn't control once it got out of hand. He'd burn, until he was nothing but a pile of ashes. A pile of ashes for people to mourn and cry over, causing pain and sorrow. Harry had caused so much pain already, he'd ruined countless lives.
Did Malfoy tell Parkinson? Did she tell Hermione?  Will she care? I mean, is there really anything wrong with being friends with him? He's not evil or mean or bitter. He's kind, sarcastic, bit of a drama queen, not to mention that he whines all the time. It's cute, really. Did I just call Malfoy cute?! No, I didn't say that, the stupid voice in my head did. Oh, shut up. Wait, did I just tell myself to shut up? Merlin this is getting confusing.
"Hurry up! Oh Merlin, we're going to die! Fuck this, fuck everything! Harry, faster, oh my Salazar! Why the fuck do I love you again?"
"Wonderful. Harry, who is your soulmate?" Harry held it in a bit longer than the ferret, but it was exhausting, and he soon found himself giving in to the potion.
"I would have. I don't bloody care what happens to me! It's you, and Ron, and Blaise, and Pansy, and Draco."
Wealsey took a few deep breaths, resuming his pacing. Though he didn't cry, it was obvious he was just as stressed out about fight as Granger was. Honestly, he was probably worse.
"If it's not a big deal, then why can't you just tell me?" Harry's hands clenched into fists, and he let out a yawn, only making him even more tired then he already was.
Hermione wrapped her arms around him, and whispered, "I know, but it'll get better. He'd want you to be happy, Ron."
"For your information, I found him like this. And don't act like you care. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way to the hospital wing." Ron walked on, leaving a fuming, worried ferret behind.
Draco took the box from Harry, and took the lid off. "Merlin Harry, how many chocolate frogs are in here?" Harry shrugged.
So, after lunch on that third day, Ron found Harry walking in the hallway, all alone. Naturally, he confronted the shorter boy. "Stay away from Hermione, she's my girlfriend," he growled.
"You know, your hair looks better like this," he stated before running a hand through it. It was literally the softest thing he'd ever touched. Draco's cheeks turned pink, making Harry grin. "First day back, you're wearing it like this." Draco scoffed.
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were already there with Ginny, smothering her with hugs and kisses. Harry would have laughed, but he knew she'd be doing the same to him soon. And he was quite right. As soon and Molly spotted the three, she rushed over and hugged Harry so tight, he couldn't really breathe. He contemplated letting her continue until he stopped, breathing that is, but decided against it. When she pulled away, she kept her hands on his shoulders.
"Oh, right. Well, uh...how do you feel about Hermione?" Pansy perked up at this, and threw Draco a confused look. He mouthed back, "Go along with it." She nodded, though she was still confused.
"What happened, is he alright?" Of course, they all looked a bit beaten up, but the rest were all conscious. A sob escaped Hermione's mouth as she desperately tried to keep herself together. Madame Pomfrey's mood darkened considerably as realization dawned on her. "There's nothing I can do if he's already..."
Draco got a bit lost before he found his way to the trapdoor. He opened it and went through the underground tunnel that he vaguely remembered from earlier. As he was walking, he noticed something silver lying on the ground. He poked it. It was silky, but also soft. Draco picked it up, recognizing it as Harry's invisibility cloak.
"The Weasley family, all of the professors, Dean and Seamus, Luna, and Neville. I can send word to the Weasley's and friends if you wish, might be a bit easier. And could you just tell all the teachers to come here as soon as lunch ends?"
"Haven't lost a game since I was seven, and that was because my brother's liked to cheat all the time. Fred would always..." His voice lost the ability to speak, as he remembered the brother that he tried to forget. Not to be rude, just because it hurt too much. Ron cleared his throat. "Up for a game?"
The common room had three long desks spread out along the back wall. There was a fireplace, with two sofas facing it at a slight angle. One wall was entirely made of books, seeing as the wall itself was a bookshelf. Everything was neutral colors, nothing bright like their previous common rooms. There were two hallways, one leading to the boy's dormitories, the other to the girl's.
The compartment door slid open, snapping Harry from his trance. Giving a small smile, Harry motioned the redhead inside. Ron took the seat across from him, and they talked for a few awkward moments before the door opened yet again, this time revealing a blond boy who looked strangely familiar.
While he waited for Ron, a friend he'd made a year or two back, he busied himself with looking out the window. He couldn't believe it, he was finally going to Hogwarts. Mother and father had told him multiple stories about it, and Remus and Sirius did too before Harry wasn't allowed to see them anymore.
"Of course that's what I'm implying! I'm not blind, Harry." The raven-haired boy snorted at that, for he had seemed pretty blind last week in the corridor with Draco. "I see the way you look at her..." The last part was barely even a whisper.
"No Ron, I'm not talking about the fight. I got over that days ago. I'm talking about what you and Hermione told Madame Pomfrey. What happened to 'Don't worry Harry, we won't tell anyone.' because last time I checked, Madame Pomfrey was included in 'anyone.'"
Hermione, Dean, and Seamus were suddenly spending quite a lot more time together. Harry thought it to be suspicious, but Ron rolled his eyes.
Ron sat up with a groan, confused to why he was currently on the floor. He hadn't fallen out of the bed in ages, so why all the sudden. He hadn't even had a nightmare. Slowly, the events off last night came back to him, and he felt his face heat up. It was then that he noticed the other in the room, who was way to good-looking for his own good. Wait, what?
"Why should I be nice to that redheaded git?" Blaise responded, malice lacing his words. Theo turned from the other Slytherin he had been talking too, and gave the boy an amused look.
"Look, you and I both know Malfoy's got my hoodie, so why not spare me the trouble of having to get it back myself somehow?"
Hermione's screams filled the entire cellar. Ron was in hysterics, trying to break out and help. Harry knew they would all die soon. And it was his fault. They were going to die because of him. Just then, there was a crack, and Dobby appeared, coming to rescue them. Harry told him to take Ollivander and Luna first. Another crack, and the three were gone.
Draco made his way to his new dorm with Theo. He was relieved to have gotten a door with a friend, seeing as Blaise and Pansy were stuck with the Gryffindorks.
Harry ran and ran, until he got to Myrtle's bathroom. He collapsed on the floor, shaking and crying. He couldn't believe he'd done that. He was a freak. He let his anger block out everything else.
She tried not to think of what would happen once they got back. Just trying to imagine the looks on all of the Weasley's faces, and after they'd just lost Fred. Hermione now had tears running down her cheeks that Pansy and Blaise chose not to point out. It hurt Pansy seeing Hermione this way, but she knew it was nothing to the pain her girlfriend must be feeling.
"You should tell people, you know. Maybe they'd stop throwing themselves at you constantly," Harry said as he sat on his bed. Neville put a bookmark in his book, and set it down.
"Good one, Master Draco," she laughed, hunched over. Just then Lucius and Narcissa walked in, Lucius smiling and Narcissa giggling when they saw Harry. He finally gave in, chuckled a bit too.
Pansy knocked on Blaise's door repeatedly until it finally opened. "Blaise, I need your help!" She pushed the door open further, and walked in.
It didn't make any sense. Sure, she was a beautiful girl, but he'd always thought their relationship was more of a brother-sister thing, like with Ginny. But if he felt like that, it was going to ruin everything, with both Hermione and Draco.
Harry looked at him with confusion. "Uh, no. We're just taking a break to figure things out. What's it to you, anyway.
Mr. Padfoot says Harry is always up to something, and he wonders what he's doing now. Surely he knows the password.
The thing was, Hermione wasn't sure Harry should go to Hogwarts anymore. She warned him, again and again, that it could trigger a PTSD attack. He'd had one just that past week. It was quite frightening for everyone else, but Harry had brushed it off and said it was nothing.
"You don't love him. You're going to marry a lovely girl one day, and then you'll have children. Do you want children, Harry?" The small boy nodded, salty tears running down his chubby little cheeks.
"The morning I ran out of the hospital was the first time. And I've done it twice since then." Harry looked down at his feet, embarrassed and guilty.
"But I was happy then. I was carefree and stupid and happy, and I hate that me. I hate the old me, the current me, and even the future me. Because I'll still be destructive, and everyone that I grow too close to will die. So no Draco, I really don't think I deserve to live right now. And by the way, I really like you, so we can't be friends anymore, or you'll die too." Draco froze. Did he mean like like, or like like?
"Oh Harry, that's wonderful! Finally you'll be getting out of your house more often," Hermione said, a bright smile on her face.
The hoodie was spread out before the three on Draco's bed while they just stood there staring at it.
"Headmaster, I think you may have made a mistake. I should have had to free Ron or something, not...Malfoy." The man smiled down at him, giving him a knowing look that Harry loathed.
"I don't know," he replied honestly. Pansy looked at him awhile, before going back to asking the questions.
"Oh, and he wants to talk to you, I suppose?" Ron stared to argue, but Hermione sighed, and pulled him out of the wing.
Harry had been seven, only four years younger than he was now. He remembered it had been Christmas Eve, and the two had been acting odd all night. Finally, just before they were about to leave, they'd said they were together, and had been for quite some time. Father had sent Harry to his room quickly, and mother had held him while he listened to the continuous yelling, until it had finally stopped. Moony and Padfoot hadn't been over since.
"Come here, Pretzel," the blond said softly, holding out his arms. Tentatively, she walked towards him, and he carefully wrapped his arms around the small creature. He held her while Harry watched, and
"Are you hungry, dear? It must have been a little while since you last ate anything." Harry nodded and followed Teddy's grandmother into the kitchen. She heated up some shepherd's pie, which he took his time eating.
"Oh, well...alright then." Harry sat up, a bit too quickly, earning a headache in return. He slowly got back onto the couch, Narcissa eyeing him.
"You take care of him, alright dearie? Draco nodded, and she smiled at him. "See you at Christmas, Harry." And Harry didn't have the heart to tell them that they probably wouldn't see him, and then she was gone, along with everyone else.
"You can borrow one of mine. Now hurry and clean this up; it looks likes a hurricane happened in here." And with that, Hermione left, ignoring Harry's persistent whining behind her.
Hermione stood up from the bed, brushing her robes off, then closing her trunk. She was leaving tomorrow, and had just finished packing her trunk. Using her wand to shrink the bulky chest, Hermione slipped it into her pocket, walking out of her room and into the common room. Pansy, Blaise, and Ginny were all there, chatting away. Ginny and Blaise had started talking at the funeral, and had quickly become good friends, though it came as a surprise to them both.
. The thought made butterflies swarm Harry's stomach, and, as much as he didn't like to admit it, the feelings were very much reciprocated.
"You guys were the only people I told. I didn't even tell you, actually. Hermione did," Harry said. Ron was at a loss for words. "Bye Ron, we'll be going now."
"I don't know, I just threw some in there. Keep looking." Draco moved some of the chocolate around, until his hand hit something hard. He pulled it out, seeing it was a book. A potions book. "There's one more thing in there." Draco nodded, and kept looking. When he couldn't find anything after a while, he gave up, and dumped the entire box's contents on the ground. His eyes landed on a slim rectangular thing.
Harry and Draco continued bickering, putting on a good show for the rest of the class. It was exhausting, and neither of them enjoyed it. This secret friendship was getting to be quite annoying, but they couldn't tell anyone. People would bombard the two with questions, and The Daily Prophet would sure have a grand time. Harry could already see the headline: Savior of the Wizarding World Befriends Ex-Death Eater.
"What did they tell you?" Madame Pomfrey backed away, hands up. "They had no right, no right to do that!" he screamed, shooting a spell at a flower vase, causing it to fall and shatter on the ground.
Harry had calmed down since the fight in Ron's room. He wasn't even mad anymore. He didn't talk to his old friends though, he figured they didn't want him around anymore. They didn't even like him anymore, Hermione had said it herself. They wanted the old Harry, and since he couldn't give them that, he assumed this was the next best thing. He had pretended, for so long, to be that old Harry. He had pretended to be okay. But on the inside, he was breaking a little more each day.
"Maybe I just didn't want to walk to class alone," he stated, running a hand through the mop on his head. Pansy scratched the tip of her nose, and the two walked in a dreadful silence the rest of the way, which, thankfully, wasn't very far.
"Oh, that's good. Because I like him, and I think he might fancy me as well." It was a good thing he didn't know she was dating Pansy, but it was a wonder how he hadn't heard yet. The entire school knew except for him.
"Oh, but Weasley, I know all about it," he said, narrowing his eyes and glaring at them. "I know about the fight in your room, I know about your weak attempts to try and talk to him, I know about a lot more than you realize."
"Oh no, it's Harry to you. I will not have my friends calling me by my last names, I absolutely hate it."
"Draco," Harry whispered, ignoring the weird feeling in his chest, "Ron's right behind us." Draco quickly let go, clearing his throat a bit. "I'm fine," he said, then looked at Ron, scowling. "What are you doing here?"
"What is going on? Why are Malfoy and Harry acting like they're best mates all the sudden, and why did Nott attack him? To add to this chaos, I'm starving and there's not a single piece of chicken in sight!" Hermione and Harry rolled their eyes, and Dean and Seamus looked amused.
"Well, the boys became friends on their own, about a month ago, or maybe two. I don't remember. Anyway, a couple weeks ago, I was talking to Harry, and Draco barged in. That's when I realized they were friends. But then I thought back to before even that, when Harry had been in the hospital wing for a PTSD attack. Yes, Harry has PTSD, but not a lot of people know and you can't tell anyone. Anyway, Draco said he had found him, though I think they had been hanging out or something. What I'm trying to say, is that it was that night that made my realized Draco's feelings, even if I realized it weeks later. The problem is, I'm not sure if Harry is gay or not."
When he got there, however, Harry was gone. "Where is he?" Ron said, pointing a the bed he had been in.
"Malfoy, you take that cloak off right now!" He did, and then she was hugging him. "Thank you," she whispered, confusing him.
"What's Drarry? Is it in the dictionary, because I've memorized it and I don't remember seeing Drarry anywhere?"
Hermione sat down next to the ginger. The boy looked up, tears in his eyes, then looked at his hands. "I miss him 'Mione. I miss him so much."
"HOW IS THIS GOING TO HELP! HAVING THE DOCTORS TELL ME EVERYTHING WRONG WITH ME!" Hermione was trying not to get angry, but it was so hard. Couldn't he see that this was best? Couldn't he see that this would help? Couldn't he see that he wasn't ok?
"Then who did you kiss? Who was it that you enjoyed snogging so much, that you decided to break up with me?"
"Harry-" The doctor walked into the room. Harry tried to make a break for the exit, but Hermione stepped in front of the door. He almost apparated before he realized that this was a muggle place. He sighed in defeat , and walked over to the doctor.
A house-elf appeared while they were wandering down a random hallway hand in hand. Of course, no one was around, but better safe than sorry, right? Okay, and MAYBE they enjoyed holding hands, but they'd never admit it.
"When Draco was a boy, he read a muggle comic once, and for the rest of the week, he kept a blanket tied around his neck, running around the house saying he was Superman, whoever that is. It was adorable, I even have some pictures. I could show you them after dinner, if you'd like." Draco's eyes widened and Harry grinned.
It had been three days. Three days since that morning. He hadn't done it since. He hated himself for it. For giving in, for letting himself enjoy it. And yet, here he was, after three days, back in Myrtle's bathroom.
"What, why?" He continued babbling on, but Draco wasn't listening. He grabbed Harry's arm, and pushed the sleeve up. Harry hissed in pain, trying to pull his arm back, or at least cover the scars up. But it was useless, Draco had seen them.
Harry looked up. He took in Myrtle's worried face, and Draco's paler than usual one. "D-did they scar?" Draco nodded, not meeting his eyes. "Let me see them."
"Ron, I'm not asking for us to suddenly become all buddy-buddy. Just being civil to each other for once." He thought again, and gave a quick nod. Hermione removed the charm, and turned around, so that they were all facing the blond.
"Happy Christmas," Harry grinned. They stood there for a few minutes, Draco staring at Harry with a goofy smile on his face the whole time. Harry cleared his throat after a while, making Draco snap out of his daze. "Um, Draco? Do you mind letting me in?"
Harry had also spoken at Narcissa's trial. She was on house arrest for a little while, but at least it wasn't Azkaban.
Harry used to think he was broken. But that was no longer fitting, in his eyes. Broken was fixable. Harry was beyond fixable, he was far beyond broken. He was shattered.
"I'll tell you later." Madame Pomfey walked in, eyes falling on the boy, who face was drained of color, beads of sweat rolling down his forehead.
"But how? Do you love me like a boyfriend, or like a brother?" Ginny had never really thought about it. She thought for a few moments.
"Want to go outside?" Harry nodded, and the two began their walk. They walked in silence, though it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable. Finally, they were outside, the fresh air immediately making the raven-haired boy feel more relaxed.
Once Harry had calmed down enough, he said," Draco, really Hermione? Why the heck would you pretend to like him, especially when you've got a girlfriend. By the way, I heard I was the last person in the entire school to find out, and I'm pretty sure I should have been the first."
"No offense mate, but you aren't much help like this. Go up and get some sleep, and I'll see you tomorrow. Well, later today I supposed, seeing as it's well past midnight." The redhead nodded, and shut the book he had been 'reading.' He walked out of the library, nearly running into a bookshelf once or twice. Harry sighed, and looked back down at his book. It was going to be a long night.
Hermione looked up at her friend, and turned to sob in her shoulder. Pansy whispered words of comfort, while she led Hermione to the couch. They sat down, and Pansy let Hermione cry, soaking the sleeve of her shirt, though she didn't mind. After five minutes, her crying slowed down, and she rested her head on Pansy's shoulder. Eventually the tears stop, her breathing slowed, and she fell asleep on the Slytherin's shoulder.
"Well, who is it?" Ron questioned, earning a slap on the arm from Hermione. Harry gulped and looked down at his empty plate.
"Oh come on, you've been giving me unnecessary attitude the whole time we've been talking, and you're obviously upset about something."
The thing is he didn't just have PTSD. He also had depression, and an eating disorder. If he had any of those he had before the war, he wasn't sure. Either way, he thought he was pretty messed up.
your company, and you're rather good for him. And do call me Luna." He nodded, and she left, leaving Draco standing in the door frame, unsure of what to do.
"Well, we were watching a muggle movie, long story, and then we kinda fell asleep on the couch when it was over. Then, I don't know, I just panicked and ran in here."
"Potter!" Harry swung around, only to be met with a sour-faced Parkinson. He glared at her because he was feeling especially moody today, and who did this girl think she was, bothering him like this. Whatever she had to say, it most certainly wouldn't be good.
"What were you thinking?" Draco pulled the smaller boy into a hug, and he hugged Harry tighter than he'd ever hugged anyone in his entire life.
"Great! Start packing! Ron will be ecstatic! He was hoping you'd say yes, but with how you've been since..." her voice trailed off, and she quickly tried to change the subject. Hermione knew Harry hated any mention of the war, and she understood. The war hit them all hard, just some more than others. "Anyway, just to pack your things and we'll head down to the Weasley's! " Hermione have a small squeal of delight. The Weasley's? Harry was quite confused, but then he, surprisingly, put two and two together. Hermione must have asked if he wanted to stay at the Weasley's.
The two continued to bicker, but Harry had tuned them out, for the most part. All he could think about were the three words that kept replaying in his head.
The red curtains that surrounded his bed were pulled apart slightly, and the bed dipped near his feet. Harry assumed someone must have sat down.
Harry had just been relaxing by the lake, clearing his mind. He hadn't expected the hex that hit him right in the middle of his back. His first instinct was obviously to get his wand out. Harry ignored the pain in his back as he moved, and turned around to face Nott as he cast another spell, which Harry quickly blocked. Harry was drained of energy, however, from the countless days of no sleep. He couldn't keep up with the amount that Nott was sending so quickly.
"We know you fancy Harry," Seamus said, a grin spread wide across his face. Draco flushed, as Dean admired the goofy grin his boyfriend was sporting, before looking at Draco's red face his face also breaking into a grin.
Not even five minutes later, a man with a shark's head Harry assumed was Krum appeared, and Harry watched expecting him to take Malfoy, but the shark-man went straight to Hermione, making Harry's jaw drop yet again. Sighing in defeat, Harry went towards Malfoy, rubbing his wrist once the merman let go.
Draco felt he wasn't allowed to be upset, since he'd hardly known the redhead. For years he'd made fun of the Gryffindor, all because he was poor, and didn't have everything he had. He'd called him names, ridiculed him countless times, and after all that Ron had still found it in himself to forgive the other. Draco really hadn't deserved the friendship, or anyone's for that matter. Because when had he ever been pleasant to be around? He'd tried to change, tried to fix his mistakes, but who was he kidding? People can't change that much, and Draco was no exception. Here he was right now, making everything about himself like always.
"Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea," the blond said, putting his hands up in surrender. Harry rolled his eyes, before going back to reading his letter. "Who's that from?" Draco asked, peering over his shoulder.
After agonizing minutes, Harry swam upon a crowd of merpeople, singing and calling the champions towards them. He approached cautiously, in case this was a trap. But then he saw four people tied to a statue they were all surrounding.
A crack, and Theo and Umbridge were gone, leaving the others alone in the shack. Hermione broke down in tears, clutching Pansy like her life depended on it. Pansy didn't know Ron well enough, but she couldn't help but shed a tear or two herself. Blaise just stared, as well as Harry.
"No biggie, just got attacked," he said, shifting to a more comfortable position. He was quite tired, and just wanted to go back to sleep.
"I came out to my father as gay before school began again, but he's still convinced this is all a phase. I'm hoping that if I have a boyfriend with me, it'll change things." Harry stared at him for a long time, making Draco's cheeks heat up slightly.
"Now now, Harry, everything's cleared with the ministry. Don't worry, it's perfectly legal for you to use." That wasn't really what Harry was worried about, more so Pansy and Draco discovering all of his secrets.
Harry had to keep telling himself to calm down as he walked to Gryffindor tower. He was just being crazy, he told himself. He knew, deep down, that Hermione wasn't the problem, but he continued anyway. Finally, a familiar portrait came into view, and it was only then that he realized he didn't have the password.
Harry looked around the room nervously, watching all the energetic children run around shrieking while he stepped back into an unoccupied corner of the room, just standing there awkwardly. The wildness of the other kids frightened him just a bit, and he much preferred to stand there and wait for his parents to return. He wasn't sure the other kids would like him, anyway.
The secretary looked up and peered at him through her glassed. If he was being honest, it was quite frightening. He squirmed under her stare, growing quite uncomfortable.
"I provoked them, Potter. And you haven't done anything, so you can't say 'we're.' If we're going about your messed up logic, then I believe the correct term would be 'they're.' And what about when I conjured up that snake in second year?"
"Draco Malfoy." Both were pink in the face at this point, and both were hating just how much Pansy was enjoying this.
For years, Harry could shove his emotions off to the side, as he was always busy. There was always something to be solved, something that wanted to kill him, murderous lunatics to stop. Always something to keep him busy. But now he didn't have that. So yes, he cried about Ron's passing. But he also let out everything he'd been bottling up for so long. He cried for his parents, and Remus and Sirius. He cried for Fred and Ron, and even Colin. Because he missed the boy, who really wasn't so bad. And Harry still couldn't get that look that Dennis gave him out of his head.
"Love you too," Harry mumbled back, still a little upset she had been laughing at him. He wasn't one for attention, that was clear, even if he was only three years old. Lily smiled sadly as she watched her husband lead him up the steps by the hand to the door. They hadn't told Harry he was widely known among the wizarding community, for he was still so young.
"Harry, everyone would be delighted if you did. You could see your friends, the professors, Hagrid."
He walked over to Draco, his breath seeming shallow. "Doesn't this place bother you at all?" he asked, breathlessly. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to rid himself of the terrible flashback he was getting.
"HARRY!" Draco ran forward, snatching Harry's wand out of his hands, which Draco noticed were shaking. He grabbed the boy's hand, which were drenched in a cold sweat, though he didn't care.
The two boys just looked at each other for a little while, before Harry got ready for bed and Neville went back to his Herbology book.
Hermione was about to say something, when Harry suddenly jumped up. "What time is it?" Hermione cast a tempus charm. It was just after nine. "Shoot, I have to go, Hermione."
"I am not a drama queen. And how do I know you aren't lying?" He heard Seamus mutter 'drama queen' again as the three took out their wands and rolled them on the ground towards Draco's feet. He picked them up, and handed them back. The three looked at him bewildered. Draco merely rolled his eyes.
"Mate, you know I was kidding before, right? It's fine that he's your soulmate." Harry nodded. Ron's approval wasn't really his biggest concern right now, it was his own. Draco Malfoy, the boy who had relentlessly bullied him and his friends for years, was his soulmate. He grimaced, and grabbed his goblet of pumpkin juice, taking a sip of it. He looked over to where the blond was, and when their eyes accidentally met, he may or may not have choked on his juice.
Ron tried talking to Hermione all through lunch, but she ignored him and continued talking to Neville and Ginny. After lunch, Ron walked with Hermione to their common room, trying to explain himself. Halfway there, Hermione suddenly stopped. "What do you want from me? Just go away!" she yelled, frustrated and tired of Ron's constant apologies.
"I think we'll be off to the kitchen now," Narcissa said, motioning for her sister to follow her. They left, leaving the two boys alone. Draco took a seat next to Harry, who hadn't so much as looked up yet.
"She's with Harry right now." Hermione raised an eyebrow, but said nothing else. She was about to ask Pansy if she wanted to head off to the library before she left, when the portrait door swung open, Draco rushing through it carrying a newspaper in his hands. He didn't normally read the Daily Prophet, since it was usually full of rubbish. But when he'd seen the headline, he'd quickly snatched the paper out of the hands of a second year, promising to return it as he ran off.
man," Draco corrected. Harry rolled his eyes, and went to start on the head. When he was finished, Harry admired his work proudly. Draco looked up, and stared at it, before saying, "That looks dreadful, the head's not even on straight."
He knocked on the door repeatedly. "Harry James Potter, you open that door this instant." The door opened, revealing a sleep-deprived Harry who was halfway through brushing his teeth. Draco ignored this. "Pull up your sleeve," he demanded. Harry pulled it up cautiously, not wanting to touch the tender skin. Draco studied the wrist, noticing nothing new, and he gave a satisfied nod. "Promise me you won't ever do that -he pointed to Harry's wrist- ever again."
"Oh," Draco said, and Ron left, leaving the two alone with Theo, as Madame Pomfrey had run off to who knows where. Oh yes, this should be fun indeed.
"You can call him your brother you know, its alright. I refer to Draco as my brother all the time," Pansy exclaimed, walking over and sitting on the edge of Hermione's bed.
"Well, those are all good. We'll figure something out. We've got time." Dean kissed Seamus's forehead. "Get some sleep, Shay."
"I've been doing alright, thanks. And, if we're going to be sharing a dorm, I think first names will do." Hermione nodded, and smiled.
He scanned the crowd, before his eyes stopped on a certain blond. How could you not find him, with that ridiculous hair of his. Honestly, it practically blinded him. He walked up to Draco, and sat down on his trunk, resting his legs, though they weren't even that tired. Draco looked at him, letting out a small sigh in relief.
It was his fault, he knew it was. If he'd just seen it sooner, or moved out of the way, he could have saved him. Or if he'd just died instead of Ron. Ron had too many people who cared about him. Molly, Arthur, Bill, Charlie, George, Ginny, Hermione, Harry, Blaise, maybe even Percy and Pansy. It was unfair, and cruel, and it hurt too much to even bare. Because this time, unlike all the others, it was directly Harry's fault.
"I don't know, to be honest. After I do it I only hate myself more for giving in, for letting myself succumb to the self-pity and hate."
"Okay, fine. Remember a few days ago when we went to the kitchens?" Draco nodded. Of course he did, that was the day he...yeah.
"I know, but Moony and Padfoot are meeting us for ice cream as I'd promised Harry, and we shouldn't keep them waiting. Where is Harry, anyway?"
Hermione contemplated this. Does she lie, or tell him the truth? Lying would most likely come back to bite her later, so she decided with the latter. "I kissed someone."
"Uh, ok?" Neville was extremely confused. There was a knock at the door and Ron got up to answer it. It was Dean and Seamus, with a roll of parchment in Seamus's hand.
"Then no." Hermione seemed surprised at this. She thought Ron would be seething with anger by now. "Well don't look so surprised, 'Mione!"
"Hey there little guy, what's your name?" Harry looked up to see a nice lady with blonde hair smiling down at him.
"Because you hate me," he stated as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Harry's frown deepened.
They talked until there was a loud knock at the door. Harry opened it, and Ron burst in, looking furious. That only made Harry and Neville laugh again. Harry closed the door, while Ron took a seat on the coach.
"Harry, you more than anyone deserves to live right now. Your childhood was so messed up, at least let yourself be happy now."
Ron paced the room. He was so mad. At Hermione, at Harry, at life. He was mad at the world, the unfairness brewing deep in it's core. He didn't understand why life hated him so much. He didn't understand why he was so angry all the time. He didn't understand why he couldn't get over his brother's death. The world was against him, it seemed.
"They don't look alike much, do they?" he exclaimed sadly, folding his arms onto the table and resting his chin down on them.
Harry and Draco walked in peace for a few moments, before Harry abruptly pulled his hand away. He started pacing, pressing the palms of his hands to his eyes, muttering meaningless words. "...so stupid...never work out...be dead by tomorrow...right after Ron...bloody selfish..."
"Oh, hey Draco. Listen, Blaise wants us to...you ok?" Draco glared at him, the anger flowing through him, his knuckles white from gripping his wand so tight. "Is something wro-"
Dean, Seamus, and Neville already knew, but it was a thousand times worse actually seeing him. Dean couldn't look away, no matter how much it hurt. Seamus put a hand on his shoulder and gave a comforting squeeze. Dean broke his gaze for a moment to look at his boyfriend, noticing the tears falling slowly and silently. He felt guilty for not crying, not mourning his friend as he was supposed to. He wondered if people would think he didn't care. Neville retched onto the floor, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.
"Bye Blaise." She smirked, and walked away. Blaise stood there, stunned. He hadn't been hearing things, had he? He knew she was friends with Pansy, and there was the so-called "truce" with Draco. But him? He shrugged, and walked back into his room.
"Whatever lover boy, just go to him, or quite staring longingly at his door. People will start thinking you're in love with it or something." Draco scowled, then stood up. He hesitated, before walking up to the door. He was about to open it when Luna beat him to it on the other side. He jumped back, giving a small yelp.
When Harry awoke, Draco was gone, but a sticky note had been placed on his forehead. He took it off, chuckling.
He picked at his food, not really in the mood to eat. Harry wasn't even really hungry. He looked up at Teddy, who was sporting bright orange hair and grey eyes at the time.  He was a metamorphmagus, just like his mother had been. 'Too bad he'll never get to meet her, because of you,'  he thought. Frowning, he stood up.
"You hesitated," she replied in a sing-song voice, grinning even wider. This poor boy had obviously fallen for the blond Slytherin and was still in denial.
It was a relief when he got the letter from Teddy's grandmother. It was a relief when Draco invited him to stay for the holidays. Between the two, it would take up nearly the entire holiday, and he wouldn't need to come up with a dumb excuse for why he couldn't stay with the Weasley's.
Harry began muttering under his breath, a scowl plastered on his face. "Tea, darling?" Harry jumped, falling off the couch, landing with a loud thud. He looked up, to see Andromeda with a thoughtful look on her face.
After Harry had finished eating, Andromeda showed him the room he'd be staying in, and left him for some time to settle in while she set Teddy down for his nap. There wasn't much to be done, and he was quickly done. He wandered around the house a bit, not sure what to do. Eventually he just retreated back to his room, deciding to work on his DADA essay due the Monday they get back. He works for about an hour before there's a knock at the front door.
"Someone's grouchy," the girl muttered, causing him to scowl even more. "And yes, actually, I did need, or rather want, something."
Harry lunged into the water and sighed in content when he could breathe again. The water didn't feel as cold as before, which Harry was unquestionably grateful for. He started swimming and noticed he was faster than he ought to be. Looking down at his feet, Harry noticed he had flippers as well. He tested them out a bit, before continuing with his task, which he only had about fifty-five minutes to complete. Harry wondered how long it would take since he was still unsure of what exactly he was supposed to be looking for.
"Pansy, is that you?" And there was the Slytherin himself, turning a corner and finding the two sitting across from one another on the ground. Harry hadn't even remembered sitting down in the first place, but that wasn't really his main concern right now.
"You'd like that, wouldn't you. For me and Hermione to break up, so you can have her." Harry nearly burst out laughing, but restrained himself due to the look on Ron's face.
Christmas holiday was approaching quickly, and Harry knew he was expected to go to the Weasley's. He couldn't though, he still felt guilty, no matter what everyone else told him. He knew it was his fault, and he relived it every night. The same dream, or rather memory, plagued him every night. Every time he fell asleep, though he tried not too, he would have to see Ron die all over again.
"Quite nice, to be honest. It was refreshing to see a new face. And didn't she just tell you to call her Luna?"
"No. Will you just...hold me?" Harry really didn't care how pathetic he sounded. Draco nodded, and moved Harry onto his lap, wrapping his arms around his waist. They stayed like that for a little while, before Harry broke the silence. "I've got a present. For you, I mean." He reached into his pocket and grabbed his wand, using it to enlarge the present that he'd shrunk before he came.
"Fine, it's Draco. Now can we start talking about you and Blaise again?" Knowing not to push it further, Ron  nodded. "So, what happened?"
"You know what, scratch what I said on the train. THAT was the most embarrassing moment of my life. He put me in Goyle's pants, Harry! I'm literally scarred for life."
He heard a stick or something break behind him, and he jumped. "Sorry!" Someone said quickly. "I didn't think anyone would be here." Harry turned around and saw Malfoy standing there, looking quite red in the face.
"Harry, when you're with Draco, do you feel like there are millions of butterflies flying around in your chest. Does your skin tingle at every touch? Does he make you smile, make you feel...alive?"
Figuring it was probably a seventh year, like Luna or Ginny, the two got ready for bed, and fell asleep in each other's arms.
"I was. But, you see, Granger won't hate you. For one, she stopped by earlier looking for Weasley. And before you say anything, it was to break up with him. And second, she happens to be right behind you, grinning like an idiot." Pansy turned around, and sure enough, Hermione was there, with an adorable smile plastered on her face.
"Hey," Draco said, lifting Harry's chin up, though the Gryffindor wouldn't meet his eyes. "It's Christmas, there will be none of that," he says, wiping away a runaway tear, just as the door opens once again, causing Harry to jump back and give a small yelp.
"Protego!" Harry said, blocking the spell. And that had started the duel. Spell after spell was cast, some hitting the targets, some missing, some blocked. There was no serious harm done, not until Theo said those two awful words, and the green light shot form his wand.
"No Harry, it's alright. I gotta help you..." Harry was barely able to keep Ron's head from falling on the thick book underneath him as his head dropped in his half-awake state.
"What's this about Hermione?" Bill asked, holding a small child in one arm, the other draped around Fleur's shoulders. She looked at him a moment, then the others, staring at each of them individually.
"Oh I can't believe that actually worked! I did the same thing to Peeves in first year," he laughed. Draco rolled his eyes, but smiled.
"I hardly think that's of any importance. Harry, maybe you should sit this one out and let the rest of us go."
"No, of course not! I mean yes, I was saying no to-" Hermione was cut off by Harry's laughter. "What's so funny?" she huffed, crossing her arms.
Andromeda and his mother walked into the room, cups of tea in hand, smiles on their faces. Their eyes fell on Harry, then Draco and Teddy.
"I want it, give it to me!" Rose said, reaching for the treat. She took a big bite out of it, just as her parents tried to stop her. When she turned into a canary, Hermione glared at George.
"Yes, get the ingredients, would you Pot-Harry?" Harry nodded, and practically ran away from the two, taking his sweet time in gathering the different elements for the concoction. He slowly made his way back to the two and dropped the many ingredients onto the table.
"Do it or I'll Imperius you, then make you." Ron grumbled something under his breath as he walked out. When he got back to his room, Blaise was walking in circles around the room, though he stopped when he saw Ron.
"Seriously, I've been standing here for the past five minutes, and all you say is why! Oh my Salazar, maybe I'm just sick of this stupid fighting, did you ever think of that? No, I'm sure you didn't, because I'm a Slytherin, and we just love fighting, right? Merlin, you Gryffindors sure are thick, you know that. Always going on and on about how awful Slytherins are when you don't even know any!"
"Right, so I think I'll be leaving now," he stated, stepping backward awkwardly as warmth rose to his cheeks.
The fire soon enveloped the room. Harry ran and ran, but the room got hotter and hotter. This was it, the end of them all. He didn't want any of them to die, not even the bloody Slytherins in the room. He started coughing, the smoke filling his lungs, consuming him. Piles and piles of junk on fire, spreading like a wildfire. It was hopeless, he was trapped. Hermione threw him a broomstick, and he just stared at it. Then something clicked, and he jumped on the broom. They were almost out, the three of them, before Harry looked back, seeing Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. He looked to Ron and Hermione, before turning around and going back. He couldn't here anything, his ears ringing. He could hardly breathe, they were shallow and rough. He didn't even realize they were out until he hit the ground. He coughed again, and turned to the rest, their expressions unreadable. Goyle was dead.
"Sorry, I was doing homework with Dean and Seamus," Harry replied, folding his cloak, and setting it on the ground with the map on top.
Ron and Hermione had always accused Harry of having a bit of an obsession with Malfoy. However, it simply wasn't true. It wasn't Harry's fault the Slytherin always seemed to be up to something. So naturally, the next obvious place to look for his hoodie was wherever Malfoy was. And no, this wasn't an excuse to get to see the blond's handsome face...it wasn't.
"But they do," Harry whispered. "They always do." Andromeda squeezed his hand, and he took it she heard him, much to his dismay.
"Of course not! We were studying, and gathering information. Very different from spying," Seamus stated. Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco thought it was, but he didn't say so. Here Harry was, finally sharing everything that was going on in his head. He was broken, only letting himself crack further.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but was quickly shut up by Pansy. "Oh no, don't you dare even think about saying you know at least one of us. Let me guess, you were going to say Draco? Okay, well answer me this, Golden boy. What's his favourite colour? Favourite food? Soulmate? I know every single one of these, and I bet you couldn't even-"
"It's Malfoy," Harry whispered, so quietly he didn't even know if he himself heard it. By some miracle, his friends heard him, and Ron dropped his fork.
"He's asleep as I told you. Just over there, look at how adorable they are. Guess he made a friend after all." Narcissa gave a small chuckle at that, and Lily looked at her questioningly.
"Hey Draco, I left my- what are you doing?" Pansy forgot what she was even going to say as she watched Draco shyly bring his blanket up to his chin, hiding everything but his head from view.
"Harry, what are those socks you're wearing? They don't even match!" Harry looked down at his feet. He'd completely forgotten about those.
"Harry, how could you not know? They're the smells you like so much. Surely you'd know what they were."
Pansy looked over to Harry, who was silent. He kept his mouth shut and got a headache from resisting it for so long. He figured he could wait until it wore off, but the pain was quickly becoming too much. It hurt so bad tears began to form in his eyes, and he looked at Pansy pleadingly, though there was nothing she could do. He was stuck, with only one way out.
"The Slytherins aren't that bad, Ronald. And Harry doesn't have to tell us. I found my soulmate a few months ago, and no one knows who they are."
She told him just that when they were getting in the car. Harry groaned. "Don't even start Hermione, I don't need your pity. I was handling it all just fine, not that I knew what "it" was, while you were off snogging Ron." Hermione turned a deep red.
Harry shot up from where he was lying on the bed. His eyes were so wide, anyone watching might have thought they were going to explode. It couldn't be...he wouldn't...he couldn't...did he like Hermione?
Theodore glared and moved to point at the blond, before thinking better of it, due to the pain he got every time he moved. "Malfoy."
"Dude, chill. Can I borrow your Wizard Chess set? Draco and I were gonna go for a quick game or two."
Ron, on the other hand, didn't even give a second thought about Malfoy, he was worried sick for Harry. He decided to skip breakfast and go visit him in the hospital wing, and at least try to talk to him.
When he only managed to skim the fingertips, Harry flew lower, setting the broom slightly on fire. Gulping, Harry reached for Draco once more and pulled him up onto the broom.
"Told him I was gay. Didn't really need to tell mother; I suppose she's always known. That's what she says, at least."
"Me? Why would you draw me?" The blond boy whose name Harry had yet to learn looked at him like he'd gone insane.
"What I meant was why are you here? Shouldn't you be off with your gir-" She stopped herself there, and cleared her throat. Harry furrowed his brows, looking her dead in the eye.
As he was turning the corner to the snake pit, he wondered just how he was going to get in. It was then that he spotted the key himself; Blaise Zabini. He liked the lad well enough. Unlike the other two, Blaise never bothered to torment him and his friends. He was quite nice, actually, when he did make conversation with them, that is. Harry had noticed he leaned more towards the quiet side.
"Wow, I hadn't realized the two of you were so close," he said as they began walking through Draco's maze of a house to get to the dining room.
Hermione walked into the room, blinking twice to make sure she wasn't just seeing things. Clothes littered the floor, as well as school books and pretty much the rest of Harry's belongings. The boy himself was now pulling things out of Ron's trunk frantically, mumbling random nothings under his breath.
Blaise was standing with a shocked Potter behind him, at least having the decency to look somewhat guilty.
"Hold up, you've already found your soulmate! Great, so I'm the only one who hasn't now." Ron dropped his head into his hands and stuffed some more food into his mouth.
"I hate travelling by floo," Harry muttered, using his glasses to fix his glasses that had broken when he fell out of the chimney.
Hermione found Ron with Neville in the courtyard, as Blaise had said. He was sitting against a tree, eyes closed, while Neville stood, going on about his new plant that Gran had sent him. "Hello Neville. Ron, may I speak with you?"
"WHAT!" screamed an overprotective redheaded older brother. "How dare you tell the whole bloody school before me," he added, a bit quieter. Ginny laughed, and looked over at Luna, who was smiling her beautiful, dreamy smile.
"Pansy, calm down. He'll be fine, let's go to Theo's room and see if we can find anything," Hermione said, trying to calm her girlfriend's nerves. Pansy nodded, and the five went off to Theo's room.
"Um, yeah. Sure, let's go." He turned around, walking back to the door, stumbling over a leg of the coffee table. Draco flushed, embarrassed, and Harry gave a small, amused smile.
"Pansy, for Merlin's sake, give it a rest!" The girl hummed in response, which just seemed to aggravate Harry further, for whatever reason.
"Well, it was earlier that day that I found this spell that could...calm me, in a way. A spell to make me happier, sort of. I'm not really explaining it right, but it doesn't really matter. The point is, that's why I let Luna in, and why I left my room. I've been using it ever since, only taking it off at night."
"No." Draco glared at Harry. Teddy started fidgeting in his arms, and Draco almost dropped the boy, who he'd completely forgotten he was holding. Sighing, he turned to go put the baby back to bed. He paused at Teddy's doorway, and, without looking back, said, "This conversation isn't over. We'll talk later." Harry gulped, slouching slightly, and Draco went into Teddy's room, shutting the door behind him.
The two Potters anxiously approached the doors to the daycare, wanting more than anything to see their son again. James pulled open the door, Lily stepping through the frame, eyes darting around looking for the familiar glasses and messy black hair. When she spotted him in the back of the room, on the ground fast asleep with his head in another sleeping boy's lap, she smiled. The scene was just too adorable. It wasn't hard to find the one in charge, since they were the only adult present and definitely surpassed the children in height. Lily was shocked, however, when she realized she knew who it was.
Teddy sat up, squirming and giggling until he saw Draco. He stopped, and stared at the older boy with wide eyes. Draco watched nervously, afraid his cousin, once removed, technically, wouldn't like him. They looked at each other for a while, before Teddy's hair became a platinum blond, and his eyes a stormy grey. Draco's face broke into a grin, and Harry watched the strange yet sweet interaction, before breaking into a fit of coughs. Draco's head snapped towards him instantly, worry etched into his face.
"I'm offering you a job here, Mr. Potter. There's an opening for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, and you would be the preferable option."
Harry, realizing Draco was serious, didn't even try to fight. He pulled his shirt up over his head, reealing a bare chest that would have normally made Draco's heart skip a beat. Ok, maybe it still did, but he was much more focused on the problem afoot. Each of Harry's ribs was easily visible, and he looked scarily unhealthy.
After Christmas dinner, when Harry was packing up to go stay with Sirius for the rest of his holiday, Draco walked into his room. Harry's eyes were drawn to his hair, which was completely gel free and looked quite fluffy to be honest.
"Ok." Malfoy bit back a smile. Harry stood up and walked over to him, him stomach twisting, though he wasn't sure why. Nerves, probably.
"You and I both know that Draco never hated Potter and his friends. He was jealous and constantly in need of Potter's attention. And you, you never hated them either. Maybe you guys didn't get along well, but there was never hate. You could never hate anybody."
"Harry, your parents wouldn't want you dead either. Hurting yourself only hurts the people who love you." Harry's hand went to his wrist, and Draco watched the strange interaction, before his eyes widened.
At last they were done. The only eighth years missing, since it was after curfew, were Hermione, Malfoy, a Slytherin, and a Ravenclaw. They got quite excited when they saw Malfoy wasn't there, before they remembered that he was Head Boy. Hermione was Head Girl, so that explained the only two people they actually knew.
"Only a few minutes," Harry laughed, trying to ease the tension, but he stopped when James glared at him.
"You'd all carry on. It would take longer, but you'd go about your lives. That's how grieving works. You mourn the dead, then you forget about the pain over time. It hurts every once and a while, when you wonder what it would have been like, to have them by your side right them. To wonder what it would have been like, to have a mother and father, who loved you. But then you realize their dead, and they aren't coming back. So you forget, and you move on. Or you don't, and your always left...wondering."
Pansy noticed Draco staring, and followed his gaze. She smirked when she saw he was watching Potter. Draco had liked Potter since third year. She still remembered the day he burst into the common room, freaking out about having feelings for Potter.
Harry got to experience side-apparation for the first time, which he was definitely not a fan of. When they got to the manor, Harry gaped. He'd figured Draco lived somewhere big and fancy, but Malfoy Manor seemed almost as big as Hogwarts, and that was saying something. He looked around, and noticed that there were PEACOCKS just roaming around in the snow. Of all the pets in the world they could have had, of course they had to go above and beyond with peacocks. Weren't they cold though?
"Good, now you need to test it to see if it works. Two of you will take just enough for it to last a few minutes, and the other one will ask three questions each. If something goes wrong, just call me over."
Harry received gifts, admired a lovely dinner, and an even better cake. Neville and Luna seemed to be enjoying themselves. Harry was glad. But when they finally left, Harry immediately relaxed. He was exhausted, and all he wanted to do was lie down. Not sleep though, just lie down.
Everyone just watched him cry, and he hated it. He fully regretted letting them all in. He regretted letting the others go with him to the Shrieking Shack. He regretted being born, for Merlin's sake!
Avada Kedavra! The flash of green emitted from Snape's want hit Dumbledore and just like that, dead.
"And we can't forget the iconic 'My father will hear about this.' By the looks of it though, he definitely did not hear about it."
"I'm Draco. Draco Malfoy," the kid stated proudly, holding his head high, while Harry wrinkled his nose.
"Alright, I'll keep it a secret for you. Now why don't you go find Rose and play with her, I'm sure she'll be very happy to see you." Teddy's face scrunched up.
"You may not, Miss Weasley. This is between my son and me, you may be excused." Ginny nodded and left the room, leaving father and son alone.
"Harry, it really is okay if you like him." The boy glared at Hermione, before sitting up and walking out, grumbling nonsense under his breath.
"Welcome back students. And first years, welcome to Hogwarts. I know your all excited to be back, but please keep in mind that certain areas of the school are still under construction. They are temporarily blocked of for your safety until further notice. Before the feast begins, I would like to ask all eighth years to stay back after dinner. Now, you all must be famished, so, let the feast begin."
"Fine," the ginger said, not even bothering to open his eyes. Hermione turned to Neville, and he left.
"I mean, not necessarily. Why don't you sleep on it, it's getting late. Tomorrow morning, I'll meet you back here, and we can talk about it some more, help you figure everything out." Harry nodded and pulled Ginny into a tight hug.
They boys stopped to think, before Seamus piped up, saying, "We saw you with Malfoy and Harry yesterday, and were very confused at the apparent friendship between the three of you. Care to explain that first?"
"Making sure you didn't do anything stupid. Besides, figured you could use the company." Harry rolled his eyes, but smiled all the same.
"Yeah right. If I do that you have to let me do your hair that day." Harry shrugged, going back to packing. "I was joking!"
He took a deep breath, and opened the door. Zabini was already there, laying on top of his bed, reading a book. Ron muttered under his breath as he made his was to his bed. Zabini looked up at him, scoffed, and went back to his book. Ron ignored him, and left their dorm to go find Harry and Neville.
The flash of green light. A high pitched cackling. Screams, cries, blood, and death. So much death. So many lives lost, all because of one boy. One boy got to live in the place of so many more. One life, compared to hundreds. Remus, Tonks, Fred, Sirius, even Colin. Lavender Brown, Snape, Dumbledore. One death after another. Never ceasing. But that's what life is, isn't it? A countdown to death. Death is inevitable, people aren't.
"Uhhhh...why?" It looked absolutely atrocious, and Harry was bloody well going to have a good reason to stick that thing in his mouth, let alone chewing and swallowing it.
"Nah, my brother's bi. Not exactly the same, but gay people are cool. Sometimes I wish I was gay...is that normal?"
"I'll tell you what I smell then. Broomstick handle, treacle tart, and another one, but I can't remember what the smell is."
"Merlin, what are you, a bloody stalker?!" Draco snorted for the third time that night. Hermione once again gave him an odd look.
"Probably Defense Against the Dark Arts to be honest. My favourite teacher was Professor Lupin though. He was practically the only one who wasn't evil, besides Professor Snape, and Lockhart. Though he was a big fraud so, yeah."
"I'm not sure really. Don't know why I said that." Pansy blushed. "How about we just get to know each other a bit?"
"Just open it," he sighed, though he was watching Draco intently. Draco did, and he almost dropped the box when he saw it.
And suddenly Draco was leaning forward, but stopped, much to Harry's disliking. So he took matters into his own hands, and grabbed the blond's shirt, pulling him forward, and kissing him.
He didn't know how, or why it was then that it clicked, it just did. And the smile on Harry's face was big, bright, and it wasn't going anywhere.
"No, I can't. I don't want to see it again. I have to watch it every single time." Harry swallowed, his throat tight.
Slowly, Harry lifted his head up to look at everyone. Bad idea, because he could very clearly see the state they were all in. Harry choked on a sob, knowing he'd done this to them all. It would have been a thousand times easier for everyone, if he'd taken the curse like he was supposed to.
"Merry Christmas, Pretzel. Could you fetch me a glass of cold water?" She  snapped her fingers, and a glass of ice cold water appeared.
"You can drop this stupid act right now Malfoy, Hermione's already told us everything. And you called him Harry, which was a dead giveaway."
Harry closed the map, smiling sadly. He got up, brushed away the tears, and made his way back down to dinner.
"Yeah, I guess your right. Now get over here and kiss me," Seamus demanded, turning to face the taller boy. Dean chuckled before caressing Seamus's face and pulling him into a loving kiss. Merlin, his boyfriend was great.
Harry nodded. "It's fine Hermione. Just please stop crying, I didn't mean to make you cry. Please stop, I'm sorry," Harry whispered, pulling her into a hug.
After Dora and Teddy left, Harry went to his room without another word. When Ron came in, he pretended to be asleep. He eventually ended up falling asleep anyway.
Pansy, Hermione, Ron and Harry all skipped breakfast that morning. Ron was still pacing the room like a mad-man. Harry was curled up on his bed feeling numb. Hermione was still crying, though not as hard, and telling Pansy what had happened. Pansy, was comforting her crush. Funny how so much can change with one touch, one word, one sound, one emotion, one person. In a matter of seconds, your life can change completely.
Harry followed Blaise to Malfoy's dorm, ignoring the stares from the other Slytherins the best he could. As they got closer to the door, Harry could hear muffled shouts, though he couldn't exactly make out what they were saying.
The three worked on creating the truth serum, Draco doing most of the work, because both Pansy and Harry were miserable at Potions. About an hour later, they were finished, and Slughorn came over to check it.
"Of course, Master. Kreacher is happy to serve you and your friend." He disappeared, and was back just seconds later with food in his hands. Harry walked over to a table in the back of the room, Draco following. They sat down, and Kreacher set the food on the table, then left.
"Drop something, Potter?" Malfoy snickered before he turned around and entered the Great Hall, leaving Harry alone in the corridor with his mouth agape. After a few moments of staring at nothing, he shook his head slightly and crouched down to pick up his things.
Harry didn't know what was happening to him. He felt so many of those stupid feelings that only ruined lives. And they were all jumbled up, so he couldn't tell one emotion from the other. He was just one big, emotional mess.
"You made him laugh." The answer wasn't enough to diminish his confusion, but he didn't press any further. Everyone watched the scene play out, George now embarrassed and red in the face.
"Don't you ever say that. Do you hear me? Not ever. People gave their lives to help you, and you want to repay them by throwing your own away?" This only seemed to make Harry even more upset. Draco sighed. "Harry, look at me." The boy looked up at him. "If you died, the world would be utter chaos. People you've never even met care about you. If the muggles knew who you were, they'd be lining up the streets to meet you. If you died, the world would stop for a second. It would forget how to function, how to breath, how to move. If you died, I wouldn't know what to do with myself. You'd break me, Harry. Do you want to break me?" By now, both boys had tears in their eyes, though Draco tried to hide his. Crying made him soft, soft made him vulnerable. Draco was not vulnerable, nor would he ever be.
"Like I said, it's different from any other spell, it can't be done with a wand," he replied with a yawn.
"Setting him up with a friend. Do you know if he likes anyone by chance?" Pansy stopped walking, and turned so she was directly facing Harry. She put a hand on his shoulder, and looked him dead in the eye.
"Don't ask me," the blond muttered. Ron looked to Harry, who shrugged, picking at the seat a bit. Ron wasn't exactly known for being able to keep a secret, and even if he was, Harry wouldn't tell him he was gay as well. There was the looming fear that word could somehow get out to his father, and Harry shivered at the mere thought of what would happen.
Harry was still broken, he always would be. Well, unless PTSD miraculously became curable one day, or he forgot about Ron and his parents, and everyone else he'd lost. But he was only eighteen, he had his whole life ahead of him. He had Hermione, and the Weasleys. He had Draco, and Teddy and Andromeda.
Ron groaned as he made his way to his dorm, that he was now sharing with Zabini. 'How come Harry gets a room with Neville, while Hermione and I are stuck with the rotting Slytherins?' he thought to himself.
Harry sat on the ground of the bathroom, the knife held in his right hand, while he thought. He sat there for five minutes, before he brought the blade up. Because if the wildfire did spread, who was there even left to pick up the ashes?
"Draco, who do you fancy?" The blond glared at her and spent about five seconds trying to fight the damn thing before he gave up.
Harry shook it off, telling himself it was nothing. He brought his trunk into the house, taking it up to Ron's room. He absent-mindedly turned to let Hedwig out of her cage. His heart clenched. "Right," he told himself, "I killed her too."
Harry's cheeks reddened, and he avoided eye contact with his supposed soulmate. He cursed his heart which was now beating considerably faster and blamed it on a sudden adrenaline rush. Pansy smirked at her new friend, before turning her head to look up at Draco.
"Alright," Draco hesitated. "What're you doing here with Harry, then?" Harry hated how he loved the way his name sounded coming from the Slytherin's mouth.
"I said no talking. Now shut up, let's get out of this bloody lake, I'm freezing." Luckily, Malfoy didn't say anything, just followed Harry out of the chilly water. Madame Pomfrey gave them both thick blankets, and Harry went over to Dumbledore, wrapping the blanket loosely around his shoulders.
"Your guys mind games might work on Ron, but I'm not stupid like he is. I actually have a brain, unlike that teaspoon." Harry flinched, knowing he was the reason that Hermione was speaking this way about Ron. He absent-mindedly touched his left wrist, causing him to hiss in pain. Both Draco and Hermione turned to look at him.
The next day, Draco didn't see Harry at breakfast at all, or in Charms. After class he walked over to Hermione. "Where's Harry?" he asked quiet enough so that no one else could hear. She turned to him, and sighed.
"So, um...I'll give you my present later. You'll either really hate me, or thank me a million times. Or both." Harry gave him a weird look. "Anyway, let's go find mother. She's been worried sick about you."
Draco ran into him room. Harry was bisexual? Does this mean he had a chance now? His heart was racing, and he felt a bit dizzy.
Zabini only grunted again, and walked to his bed. He laid down, and fell asleep the minute his head hit the pillow, not even bothering to change. Ron let out a sound of frustration, and got ready for bed, falling asleep to the sound of his roommate's snores.
"Harry has PTSD." The blond looked over his shoulder at the now shaking boy. Not once did leaving cross his mind. Honestly, Draco didn't know why he didn't realize it sooner. Of course the poor boy had PTSD, look at the messed-up life this boy has. "He also has depression, which causes him to also lose his appetite most of the time." He took in the new information, pondering it for a few moments, causing an awkward silence. Harry was on edge the entire time. Something clicked in the back of the blond's mind, causing him to quickly look back at the smaller boy.
"What happened to him?" Draco asked, his voice no higher than a whisper. He grabbed Harry's hand to calm him down, rubbing circles with his thumb. Hermione studied the strange interaction, before turning her attention back to the conversation.
After much persuasion and flattery, the Fat Lady allowed the other Gryffindor in. He walked into the familiar common room, heads turning toward him. "Is Ginny here?" A small girl with chestnut colored hair, most likely a third year, nodded slowly.
Dora chuckled. "I know, isn't he adorable?! How are you Harry?" she asked, her voice soft and warm, but you could tell she was serious.
"Deep breaths, Harry. Can you stand?" Harry tried standing. His legs felt like jelly, and he was lightheaded, but he still stood. "Good, now walk with us." Harry followed the two bodies, which he vaguely remembered to be Pansy and Draco. He started walking, though he wasn't sure where.
"It's fine Wealsey, no harm done." Harry rolled his eyes at the very obvious lie, but didn't say anything. Ron nodded, and turned to leave, before abruptly stopping.
They ran up the stairs, which creaked and wobbled a bit, then into the only closed door, where the sounds were coming from. There was Draco, chained and gagged, screaming into the cloth as he got his with spell after spell. Harry ran forward and removed the gag, allowing the other boy to speak.
"Rose Granger-Parkinson, Teddy is perfectly capable of making his own decisions! And I don't recall hearing you use your inside voice," Hermione scolded, making Rose blush and look down at her toes.
"Great. Professor Potter, would you mind helping take dinner out to the dining room?" Harry rolled his eyes, but helped anyway. When they had finished with that, the pair went into the living room, finding Ginny and Luna there as well.
It had been a week since Harry knew he was bisexual, since he knew he liked Draco. The only person that knew was Ginny, but he was wondering if he should tell Ron and Hermione. He'd felt bad that he hadn't told them already, but every time he thought about it he got anxious.
" Harry, it's your birthday. You are not spending it in your bed sleeping all day." Hermione insisted. "Now get up, Mrs. Weasley's downstairs making breakfast for us all."
"Give it a rest, Malfoy! You guys have been friends for two months, I think I know what he needs more than you!"
The tour took about an hour, though it didn't feel that long to the boys. They were enjoying their time together. The train ride had caused them to become quite close friends. After Harry realized that Draco wasn't a  rude and snobbish prat, and Draco realized Harry wasn't an attention-seeking git, it was easy to pretend they were dating.
Harry could feel his eyes start to water again, though he hated crying in front of people. He wished Draco had gone with the others, but it was also kinda nice having him here. He sat against the edge of the bed, bringing his knees up and closing his eyes. Draco did the same, sitting right next to the boy, because right now, just being in each other's presence was enough.
Harry got out of bed, showered, changed, and tried to fix his hair, but it was no use. It stuck up everywhere, especially in the back. He sighed, and started packing his trunk. It was supposed to be done yesterday, but Harry had been to exhausted to pack anything. Although, he didn't actually fall asleep until about 4 a.m.
"You are not a freak. You never were," Hermione whispered in his ear as she embraced him. Ron joined the hug, and they stayed like that for a few more minutes. In his friends arms, Harry didn't feel like as much of a freak. But there was still that small part inside him, that said that he was. He didn't deserve his friends. He didn't deserve to eat. He didn't even deserve to live. He was supposed to be dead right now. He was supposed to be free.
"Mind letting me in?" he asked, mentally smacking himself in the face. Oh well, why not get straight to the point? Zabini raised an eyebrow.
Rushing out, the two ran into Harry and Neville's room, and sure enough, Harry was sitting on the ground, hugging his knees as he cried into his arms. Dean bent down, putting an arm around Harry's shoulder, and Harry shifted, crying into the boy's chest. Neville let a single tear slip, silently mourning the loss of his friend. Although he didn't cry, Seamus had lost the cheeriness in himself, suddenly feeling put out.
Harry knew his father was homophobic; he had multiple experiences to go off of. If he wasn't, perhaps Harry wouldn't be so afraid of him.
"Well, I'll see you later Blaise. Thanks for the chess set." Blaise rolled his eyes, and turned to Ron. He looked, well, he looked fine.
"Where'd Potter's hoodie go- OH MY GOD." And before Draco even knew what was happening, his friend was ripping the blanket away from his body, leaving him to feel exposed and, well, terrified.
"You were scared of Moody for the rest of the year," Harry laughed. Draco put his head in his hands. He should have known this was going to happen. Draco's parents were laughing throughout the entire story.
Hermione, for the first time in a while, didn't have an answer. She was stumped, befuddled, baffled. She hadn't even realized that they were at the Gryffindor table until Ginny was pulling her down to sit, waving goodbye to Luna.
"I'll wake you if you start having a nightmare, just get some sleep." Harry hesitated, before nodding. He moved to lay down on the couch, before stopping, and looking at Draco, who hadn't moved. He stared at the blond, who raised an eyebrow at him. Harry sighed, rolling his eyes, before resting his head on Draco's lap, and dozing off.
"But your not bothering me. Your being completely civil right now, and I have decided that the first six years between us never happened."
"New couple? What are you talking about?" Blaise shrunk down in his seat slightly, avoiding eye contact with everyone.
When he tried to cut the ropes, a merman laughed and pulled him away from her. "That one is not yours," he said in a harsh voice. So Harry, though confused, turned to Cho, but was again stopped by the merman. Harry swam over to the little girl, thinking maybe he was wrong, though he really had no idea who she was. The merman grabbed his wrist before he'd even made it halfway, and pointed at
"Probably first year, when you refused to be my friend. God, I don't think I've ever been so embarrassed in my life." Harry shifted guiltily in his seat.
Quickly, the ferret slipped the hoodie over his head, fixing it around his slim body. Potter was small, but the hoodie fit Draco perfectly. Must be a size too big on him. Butterflies swarmed the Slytherin's stomach as he imagined Potter wearing it, and ohmygod he was wearing Potter's hoodie. One that he'd worn before. He took another whiff.
Dementors swarmed the streets. Harry, Ron and Hermione were trapped, the only thing keeping them from the death eaters being Harry's invisibility cloak. One wrong move, and they were toast. One foot, finger, tip of the shoe showing, and they were caught. The dementors only got closer, filling the air with gloom and despair. Harry just wanted to get away, but the dementors were getting a bit too close. Expecto Patronum!
"I do not, Theo. How could you even suggest such a thing?" And that's when Ron walked in. Blaise felt the speed of his heart pick up, and his chest felt funny. His eyes widened, and he turned to Theo. But, the boy only laughed at the new knowledge he had kindly provided for his friend.
"Oh, well I talked to Draco. Apparently he fancies you too. Isn't that great, 'Mione?" It most certainly wasn't. How dare Draco be all straight and fancy Hermione.
"But everyone was worried, and I felt like...like I couldn't be sad for too long. I didn't want what happened over the summer to happen again. And I didn't want Teddy or Andromeda to see me like that, or your mother for that matter. I couldn't even go visit my own family this Christmas, I already feel dreadful about it, but I just
It was a day later that it happened. He had just been walking down the corridor. Just peacefully walking, not a care in the world. Ok, so that was a lie. He was tired, hungry, confused, guilty, depressed, and much more, but that isn't what this is about. He had been walking, and he just knew.
"Harry, I'm not an expert on the LGBTQ+ Community just because I'm apart of it. I really don't know." Harry let out a long, dramatic sigh.
Ron looked confused at first. He didn't know any guys named Pansy. Then something clicked. "Pansy Parkinson, your roommate?"
"I'd rather say when everyone is present, so that I don't have to repeat myself." She then walked out to find Ginny and the others to bring them to the Hospital Wing.
"Would you like to meet my son, he's about your age?" Harry hesitated but took her hand when she offered it to him, and she led him to the other side of the room, to a blond boy who was seated at a table drawing a picture.
"Nightmare," Andromeda said under her breath, though Draco heard. He sighed, and shook Harry's shoulders lightly until he woke. Harry stared blankly at the wall ahead, as the moments passed. Draco didn't have to ask to know Harry had been dreaming about Ron again. Ron
He didn't leave his bed the entire day, he just sat and tried to think about everything. He thought about a certain blond more than he would have liked to admit. It was the thing between him and Hermione that confused him the most. It bothered him, and he just didn't know why. He was almost...jealous.
"The world doesn't care about me. They care about Harry Potter, savior of the Wizarding World. Give it a week and they'd move on."
"That stupid Slytherin," Harry said trying to get up to go after him, before he did anything he'd regret. Madame Pomfrey pushed him back down though, refusing to let him leave. "I have to go stop him, let me go!"
"You shouldn't have come. She'll kill you. Run," was what he told the raven-haired boy before he passed out on the ground. Harry turned around, and there she was, right next to Theodore, the pink and lace alone making Harry's eyes hurt. That stupid, evil toad was back.
He saw Dean and Seamus, hand in hand, and made his way toward them. By the looks of it, they had finally admitted their feelings for one another. Harry gave a small smile.
It was then that the door opened, and Draco walked straight to Harry, sitting down next to him. Taking him from Dean, Draco set Harry down in his lap, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist. Harry cried into the crook of the blond's neck, his throat burning. He couldn't stop though, as much as he tried. It was as if a dam had finally broke.
Harry pulled out his wand, using it to summon a small, sharp knife. He put the tip of his blade to his wrist, and took a deep breath. This was it, there was no going back after. He pushed down as he dragged the knife up his wrist. His arm stung, but he relished the pain. He brought the dagger up again, feeling the cool metal against his skin. He made a few more cuts, then, satisfied for the time being, used his wand to heal the cuts, leaving thin scars along his left wrist. The raven-haired boy took a deep breath, made sure his wrist was covered, and walked out of the bathroom.
"Well, I didn't know until my mum said we were coming for a quick visit. This is the first time I've met Andromeda, but she seems nice." Harry nodded, before standing up, and motioning for Draco to follow him. They walk down the hall to Teddy's room, and Harry opens the door softly, in case the boy was still sleeping.
"Fine," Draco replied. Theo gave him a look. "It's nothing, really." Theo sighed, and went back to his Ancient Ruins homework. Draco looked down at the homework. Crap, he was supposed to go help Harry with his Potions essay! Would he still want help? Draco went anyway, just in case.
"So you admit you hesitated." Harry was obviously getting frustrated, and Pansy would be lying if she said it didn't amuse her.
"Shut up, Malfoy," Harry growled back, before standing himself up. Dean and Seamus just walked past the two, giving them odd looks.
"Doesn't matter," Harry smirked. "So, why'd you do it? You know you could just tell him you don't like him, I'm sure he won't be hurt too bad." Hermione mentally sighed with relief. This could still work.
"Come on, mate, it can't be that bad. At least it's not Malfoy or that pug-face Parkinson." That was another thing, Harry hadn't even known he liked guys. He'd never thought about it to be honest.
The couple had quickly came to the realization that they needed information, so they slipped Hermione a note during breakfast.
There were a few moments of awkward silence, before Ron just blurted out, "I like you." Blaise stopped breathing for a second, but he would never tell anyone that. Too un-Blaise of him.
He missed Lavender, and how she really was a sweet girl, despite the whole mess with Ron in sixth year. He missed Snape, though he really didn't know why, he just kinda missed him. He missed Tonks, and her clumsiness. Harry missed Dumbledore, because Hogwarts just wasn't the same anymore. Harry missed Hedwig, who had kept him company at the Dursley's during his summers there. Harry even missed Voldemort, because he'd become kind of a constant in the boy's life.
Hermione walked to the Great Hall, accompanied by Ginny and Luna, who were deep in conversation. Hermione payed them no attention, as she was thinking of the previous night's events. It was all so strange. Draco finding him, the panic in his voice when he ran into the hospital. She had thought there were tears in her eyes, but was unsure. Then the hand-holding, the worry, the fact that he knew about the fight. And he stayed, when even she didn't.
Well, they always said they married their best friend, and this boy was his only friend, which made him Harry's best friend. Check.
The gillyweed was flavorless, though the texture made him want to vomit. It was smooth, but course, almost like a tongue. The sliminess was especially off-putting, and Harry may or may not have gagged slightly. He could hear mocks and catcalls from the stands, most likely directed at him. He knew he probably looked stupid.
"Come again?" Theo was taken aback by the sudden change in behavior. Just this morning everything had been fine between them.
"What, is this Harry not good enough for you?" Hermione and Ron looked up, startled. Harry was standing in the doorway, looking both angry and upset. Hermione immediately felt guilty for what she said.
"Oh, would you? That would be amazing! Your the best, Harry!" She pulled the boy into a hug, before rushing off to tell Dean and Seamus what had happened, while Harry walked off to Draco's dorm room. He hesitated at the door, his hand up ready to knock. What if Theo answered, or Draco wasn't there? There was something else holding him back, but he didn't know what it was.
"Don't you want your hoodie?" Blaise asked, staring questioningly at the boy. Harry looked over at Draco, only to find him already staring.
"Oh good, he's sleeping again? Before school started, I don't think he got a wink of sleep if he could help it. It was horrible, watching him suffer all alone." Draco looked at her, then back down at Harry.
"You know, Draco talks about you quite often in his letters to us." Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco as the blond sunk a bit lower in his seat, face burning.
Hogwarts. Just another thing Harry helped destroy. The only place he felt at home, and he destroyed it. Partially.
"Honestly Hermione, its alright. And I'm doing great thanks." There was a silence, that was awkward, and yet...comfortable. But, Pansy broke it by saying, "Wanna play a game?"
Moments later, they had set off towards the shack. When they reached the Whomping Willow, they stopped.
Dean, Seamus, and Hermione left because, unlike Harry, they actually could. Ron and Draco stayed back, though Harry hadn't really expected the ferret to leave. Ron looked nervous, and he stood up. "Listen Malfoy, about what I said-"
"Have you seen my hoodie? The lavender one?" Harry asked in response, not even bothering to look up from the trunk. He just continued rummaging through Ron's things until he sighed, moving on to Neville's belongings.
"Too late. Here goes nothing. Just so you know, you are officially the first person to know besides my soulmate herself, of course. Congrats!"
Ginny walked into the garden, looking for her boyfriend. Despite what he had said, she really didn't think he was ok. She found the boy sitting down, picking at the grass. "Hey Harry." She sat down next to him. He looked up at her, and panicked. What was he going to do?
"Draco, would you quit looking over to Harry's room every five seconds?" Maybe he wasn't being as discreet as he thought.
"Few hours, I'd say," Draco said, shrugging. Harry groaned and shoved his face in a pillow. Draco took a seat next to Harry and reached out to touch him, but thought better of it, and brought his hand back. "Do you...want to talk about it?"
"Alright, just take a seat over there, and wait until your name is called. While your waiting, please fill out these forms." Hermione nodded, and grabbed the papers. Then they sat down.
"Well, I've considered an auror, but I think I'd also like being a teacher at Hogwarts." Lucius nodded.
" Fine. Harry grab the map and your cloak, and everyone grab your wand if you don't have it with you already. We'll meet in the common room in five minutes. Any later, and we'll leave without you." They all nodded and broke off.
Seeing as though the entire school would go bonkers if they ever found out they were friends, Scarhead and Ferret had decided to keep their newly found friendship a secret. Even so, they were together all the time. Always sneaking off when classes were over, usually hanging out in the library or the lake. The only problem, what the queasy feeling Harry got in his stomach every time he was with Malfoy. He assumed he must be allergic to something, perhaps his cologne?
Madame Pomfrey looked up from a hospital bed with a student on it when the door opened. When Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise walked in levitating an unconscious Ron, she immediately rushed over.
"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!" Hesitantly, Harry took the gillyweed and put it in his pocket.
"It wasn't your fault, Harry," Draco whispered so only he could hear. How did this boy always know what he was thinking?
"Ten minutes," Harry croaked, realizing he still had nothing. It would take ten minutes just to get there, there was no time left to find anything.
They stopped when they reached the dining room, where Draco's parents were already seated. Narcissa told the two to take their seats. They did, and the house-elf brought out the food.
"Hold on, I thought I was your best mate?" Ron seemed jealous, and slightly offended, which amused the raven-haired boy.
"Figure what out?" Draco growled at her, and ripped his arm from her grip. He ran out of the empty classroom, and to the eighth year dorms. Luckily, they were on the same floor, so he didn't have to go far. When he reached Harry's door, he threw it opens, and his eyes searched for the other boy. When he didn't find him, he panicked a bit. He quickly made his way to the bathroom in the dorm room, and found the door locked.
"Sweet," she said. He gave a small smile back, but the smile was more sad than anything. The two walked out of Teddy's room, and Andromeda led Harry to the couch. "Draco told me everything...just, take it easy, alright? Your best mate just passed away, the world doesn't expect you to be okay right away."
Harry sat outside, waiting for Teddy and Dora. He heard a crack, and he perked up. There she was, cradling a small child in her arms. The baby was a few months old now. He'd been staying with his grandma, although Harry came to visit occasionally.
"What do you think?" he said, throwing the cloak over his body, seemingly vanishing. "If I just walk out of here after weeks, it'd be hours before we even left the common room." Draco nodded in agreement, and then opened the door to leave. Once he was sure Harry had followed, he softly closed it behind him.
No one could believe it. Ron, who could always put a smile on your face, who would shove food into his mouth like he would never eat again, was dead. Harry couldn't take it anymore. He bolted out of the room before anyone could stop him, just wanting to escape it all. But no matter what he did, all he could see was that body, lying on the ground...suddenly he just broke down, right there in the passageway. His knees buckled, and he cried helplessly on the floor, because his best mate, his brother, the first friend he'd ever had, was gone.
Harry groaned in frustration, and went out into the common room. On the way, he ran into someone, falling down from the impact. Malfoy.
"Potter," Malfoy said, but Harry ignored him. He didn't want to deal with him and his taunts right now. But the slimy ferret just kept repeating his name, until Harry whirled around in a very Snape-like manner.
"Sorry, but this is too good," Pansy laughed. She laughed so hard she had to wipe literal tears from her eyes, which Draco rolled his eyes at.
"Me! Your the one who said my name, making it obvious who we were," Seamus retorted. Harry just stared at the two, before bursting out in laughter. Ron and Dean started laughing too, Seamus and Hermione joining in as well. People started coming out of their rooms to see what all the noise was about. Some rolled their eyes and went back in their rooms, other stayed and watched the five with curious faces, before eventually leaving as well.
They passed the compartment they had sat in when Harry was in his third year. Harry had been attacked by dementors. He could still remember the cold, empty sadness that had filled him as he had passed out. He could still remember him mother's screams. And the older man they had shared the compartment with, who turned out to be one of his dad's best friends. He could still remember Remus's stiff body when he had found him lying next to the other dead bodies just a couple months ago. He could remember the night Remus had come, with news of his child's birth, the smile he wore when he asked if Harry would be the godfather. Or when he taught Harry how to cast the patronus charm. Over and over, memories of Remus Lupin played in Harry's head. He hasn't even noticed he had stopped walking.
It had been a rough few weeks. After the rest of school had heard Ron's passing, everyone had been in a bit of a slump. Some got over it quickly, the ones who didn't know him well, or hadn't known him at all. For others, it took a little longer. But then there were the friends and family.
They waited a bit longer for Ron, who came out of his room still half asleep, eyelids fighting to stay open. The three walked to the Great Hall in a comfortable silence, not needing to say anything. They took their usual seats, and began eating. Dean and Seamus walked in, slipping Hermione a note.
"I didn't have a choice, Harry. He's going to kill my entire family, please, listen to me," Draco pleaded, tears wetting his soft cheeks. "I can't do this without you."
Ignoring them all best she could, Hermione strolled over to the Gryffindor table. Oddly, Dean, Seamus, and Neville were all missing. Never mind that, she'd check the dorms later. She walked up to Ginny, and, keeping her voice as steady as she could manage, said, "Get Luna and bring her up to the Hospital Wing with you. Wait outside the doors, and do not enter until I'm back."
It had been three days. Harry had taken to spending his time with Dean, Seamus, and Neville. Of course, there was Malfoy too, but it obviously wasn't at the same time as the others. Ron and Hermione spent their time with Ginny, Luna, and Neville when he wasn't with the others. The two tried talking to Harry, but he would ignore them and walk away.
"Look, I know you two are friends and all, but could you maybe not mention this to him? He'd surely come and murder me if he ever found out, and I only just found out about an hour or so ago."
When Blaise noticed, he quickly said, "Oh, well, I better go. Dray and I are supposed to go to breakfast together. See ya!" He dashed out of the room, and ran into his own, to find a frantic Ron, pacing the room. He groaned, causing to Weasel to notice him. He looked at the dark-skinned boy with wild eyes, his cheeks still stained from tears.
Hermione would be going to Rome with her parents for a week, then she would spend Christmas all over. Her parents were coming with her to Pansy's, where they would likely be for most of the day. Then she'd be at the Weasley's for Christmas dinner, along with Pansy.
." Draco stared at him for a long time, at least, for Harry it felt like a long time. In reality, only a few moments passed.
"Come in," Harry says, hesitating only slightly. The door opened, and Draco walked in, looking around the room. Harry's mouth fell open, and he gawked at the blond for a few moments before Draco spoke.
Harry fidgeted nervously on the front step. He didn't know why he was so nervous, he'd been here before, and it was just Teddy and Andromeda. He fiddled with the zipper of his jacket, before giving a small knock on the door. He waited. Nothing. He knocked again, this time louder, and the door burst open.
James was reading the Daily Prophet in the sitting room, and Harry cringed just looking at him. Ginny gave his hand a squeeze, and his eyes darted towards her's before he cleared his throat.
Hermione was shocked. She couldn't believe him, blaming this entire thing on her. "Don't you dare put this on me," she threatened. "You, are just as responsible for this as I am." Ron let out a frustrated scream, and he punched the headboard.
Across the hall, Draco was sitting with the other Slytherin eighth years. There were only four who actually came. Pansy, Blaise, himself, and a guy named Theodore Nott. He was quite nice, actually. The other three engaged in conversation, but Draco was watching Potter. He wasn't eating. Draco frowned.
"Drarry is the ship name we came up with for Harry and Draco." Hermione made an o shape with her mouth, before getting excited.
"Right, sorry," the blond said, turning red as a cherry. He opened the gate for the Gryffindor, and they walked up to the front door. Draco knocked on the door, and a house-elf wearing a shabby potato sack answered.
