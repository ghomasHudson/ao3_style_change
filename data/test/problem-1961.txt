It sounded like a question. Draco wasn’t sure what answer he was looking for.
Potter’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
He leaned into Draco, pressing their bodies together. Feeling all the hard lines of him made Draco dizzy. He took a steadying breath. This close Potter smelled like cigarettes and Firewhisky, smoky and spicy.
“You should really stop doing things you need to apologise for then,” he said, and he was embarrassed by how croaky his voice sounded. He coughed a little.
Draco forced on the old mask of Slytherin bravado to help carry him purposefully down the platform. He’d wanted to arrive early and slip onto the train before the crowds, like the coward he was, but Blaise was incapable of arriving anywhere sooner than fashionably late. He’d rather face a disapproving crowd with his friends beside him than be caught here alone.
Slow it down, read the sign,
She narrowed her eyes.
“He’s completely fine, it wasn’t even about him.”
Potter ran a hand through his hair, ruffling the messy tufts into further disarray.
He looked up at her gratefully as she began to pass her wand over him, muttering to herself as she catalogued his injuries.
Right, she was also doing her NEWTs this year.
He was still terrified.
“Is that what we are now?” he sniffed.
He turned back to her, squinting.
She’d been helping to distract him from his anxiety about the party. She had visited him at the eighth year table for at least one meal a day during the last week. They had studied together in the library a few times as well. Draco was starting to rely on Luna’s extraordinary memory to fill in the gaps in his notes, and wished they took more of the same classes.
Justin laughed at his huffy expression.
“...Lavender?” Patil rasped, not looking at him.
Draco thought the man might need more carving practice, or perhaps to do some research on what an actual dragon looked like.
“Sitting,” said Draco bluntly, raising his chin to look down his nose at Potter while his head was still lolling back. “Obviously.”
“What?” Draco demanded.
“Must have tripped,” he murmured.
“Pans, you of all people should understand the concept of mingling at a party,” he rebuked her gently, glancing back over his shoulder at all the other Houses getting along well enough.
“I must have tripped and hit my head. I don’t remember,” he lied smoothly.
With the loud shatter of glass against the wooden floor, all at once time pitched forwards in a whirl, as though desperately compensating for that last frozen moment.
Potter ambled down the corridor towards him, swaying slightly. Draco took in his dark ripped jeans, thick leather boots, Motörhead t-shirt, and smudged black eye makeup. His mouth went dry.
Blaise stole the cup of coffee from him and cradled it, looking mournful. Draco sighed and reached for another cup.
“Never have I ever gone skinny dipping in the lake.”
“What!” Potter exclaimed, snapping his eyes to Draco in surprise, “Why?”
His father had been so proud to see his only son held down and branded, like cattle. That was all he’d ever truly been.
She waved her free hand airily.
He grabbed his pyjamas and wash bag, heading out for the bathroom to get cleaned up. It was so late already, but he couldn’t get into a clean bed while he was still filthy from the train. In the shower he leaned against the cold tiles and let the water wash over him while he breathed deeply. This was his first moment completely alone all day, and his thoughts were still buzzing around his head like angry bees. Mostly he thought about how he didn’t deserve to be here.
He was completely drained. The emotional marathon he’d just been on weighed heavy on his shoulders, as he lurched across the corridor and into the blessed peace of his own room. In the familiarity of his space, Draco felt shaky. He went to sit on the edge of his bed, clasping the mattress tightly to ground himself.
He froze, and then faced her, looking at her open and earnest expression. She honestly believed he could change for the better. He felt the wall that was inside him crumble a little. Before he knew what he was doing, he pulled her forwards into a firm hug. She tensed, surprised, but then she relaxed against him and wrapped her arms around his waist.
He did look genuinely sorry. He didn’t offer any kind of excuse for why he was late, but Draco supposed it didn’t really matter.
He must have drifted off, because the next thing he knew was the sound of insistent knocking on his bedroom door.
He laughed and caught her hand to kiss the back of it. When he turned back, a few people still looked confused.
“That’s not what it seems like,” Draco scoffed.
Pansy flinched back from him, blinking in hurt confusion.
“Just be yourself old boy,” he said encouragingly.
“A poodle? Not a labrador or a bulldog?”
Draco laughed, and the mad sound of it twisted his stomach.
So you know just where you're gooooing!
Granger drank calmly, but then so did Thomas, Turpin, and Potter.
His family tree had been drilled into him for as long as he could remember. His father had made him sit and pore over the Malfoy lineage, all the lists of ancestors dating back to when records began. He had been quizzed, and punished for incorrect answers. It was part of the duty of a Malfoy Heir to know their history.
Ooof that was a hard chapter to write. I'm not sure why but it took ages! As a heads up, I'm travelling with work next week and I'm not sure if I'll have enough time (or data) to upload the next chapter but I shall do my best to. If I can't, our regularly scheduled programming will continue the week after! ~Kisses~
Draco couldn’t believe the nerve of people. It was one thing to torment him, he was an ex Death Eater, a bad guy, but by all rights Potter should be untouchable. That people could be so homophobic, even to someone who had sacrificed everything to save the wizarding world, was mind boggling. It frightened him.
She shoved him, rolling her eyes.
Draco put down his toast slowly.
“Yes,” he said suddenly, and Potter jumped, looking up at him with a hopeful sheen to his eyes.
“I told you, it’s not a Mare, just regular old trauma induced bad dreams,” he said flippantly, pouring some coffee.
“How silly of you,” he whispered back, “this is Hogwarts.”
“If that’s what you would prefer.”
Theo gave a loud snort, and then sat up in his chair.
Blaise always had plenty of muggle money, and Draco would pay him back in galleons. They’d buy t-shirts and jackets and trousers and hats and shoes. Everything. Draco loved denim jeans. They were his favourite days.
“Ah, the soup here is done the traditional way, and Raphael is very good at it,” said Draco smugly.
Pansy made grabby hands for the paper, but Blaise turned it around and started reading aloud. A few other eighth years nearby also froze to listen.
"Hello, Granger." Draco held out his hand for her to shake — thank the merciful gods, his hand was steady — because Granger seemed the type of woman to appreciate straightforwardness.
McGonagall closed her eyes briefly in exasperation, before studying them both.
“Darling, why are you dressed as an octopus this morning? It’s a bold choice of look, but I can’t say I’m a fan.”
Finch-Fletchley blinked in surprise, but composed himself in a moment.
“WHAT?” he screeched.
“Whatever Malfoy. Justin said you listened to him go on about those Spicy Girls last night, so that’s probably enough of a punishment without making you go to breakfast by yourself.”
Potter held his hands up in surrender.
“I’m good at healing magic,” he said simply, shoving his cold fingers into the pockets of his cloak.
“I’d be more comfortable if we split the bill,” he said, but Potter shook his head.
On Saturday morning Pansy hugged him tightly. He wrapped his arms around her shoulders and squeezed reassuringly.
Blaise looked momentarily sad, but he perked up when the song playing over the crowd changed again to a fast paced track.
Howard’s face twisted in anger when Potter dismissed him with his body language. He glanced behind himself, towards something Draco couldn’t see, and when he turned back his expression was calculating. Draco didn’t like it one bit. He tugged at Potter’s arm, wanting to escape this whole situation before anything else happened. Potter looked at him again, his sharp eyes softening slightly, and he allowed himself to be pulled.
The other Officer went to take hold of Howard, glancing over at Potter. Beckett caught his eye, and shook his head.
“You’re a lot more fun than I thought you’d be Malfoy. Honestly when I found out you were to be my roommate I was more than a little apprehensive, but we’ve been getting along alright don’t you think? Ernie was terribly alarmist about the whole situation, but I told him it’s just not the done thing to judge someone before personally getting to know them.”
Justin looked back out of the window, pensive and silent, gripping his duvet tighter around his shoulders.
“I told you that was a weird thing to do,” Daphne told him smugly.
“Is this some sort of joke to you Potter?” he said menacingly, stalking forwards, “What did Hermione tell you?”
Draco huffed, stepping back and crossing his arms.
“I’m berating Padma about her crush on my best friend,” Draco replied haughtily.
“I’m sure you were Pans, but I can’t imagine it was even very scandalous gossip. My father was already the Malfoy Heir, and from what Luna says about Pandora, I’m sure it was hardly a surprise to anyone that she was such a big ‘disappointment’. I wish I’d met her.”
He whimpered under the jet from the shower, and soon his muscles started to relax. He washed his hair carefully. The long fine blonde strands were like silk in the water. He’d hated it at first because he didn’t want to look any more like his father, but he hadn’t been able to get it cut over the summer and it grew so fast. Now his father’s gleaming golden hair had been shaved to nothing by the prison guards at Azkaban, and his own silver platinum locks didn’t look so bad. He styled it differently, favouring a dramatic side part, and he really enjoyed plaiting it whenever he was stressed. He remembered when he was little all he’d wanted to do was play hairstylist with his father’s hair, but he’d never been allowed to even touch it.
“Morning Harry. I’m having a family breakfast with Draco. You look tired, I hope you’re not still being haunted by that Mare?”
He clutched at his forehead.
“You don’t want to be an Auror anymore?”
“I guess I never thought about it before.”
Of course Potter didn’t really want to date him. This made so much more sense, in a round about sort of way.
Maybe Potter had gone on an end of term bender, and choked on his own vomit in his sleep. Surely Theo wouldn’t have just left this morning if that were the case.
“And, you’ll never guess who I saw at 5am this morning...”
Draco smirked.
She smiled weakly.
He’d written to his mother a couple of times since arriving back at school. Usually he just wrote generic pleasantries, to let her know he was thinking about her, even though he used a great deal of energy not thinking about her.
He’d understood what she meant. He understood her confusion. His own mind was still reeling. He categorically knew that if he’d found this out a year ago, even a few months ago, he would have reacted with all the horror and fury of any average Malfoy Heir. He would have reacted the way he had been taught to, but Draco wasn’t an average Malfoy Heir any more. Firstly he wasn’t the Heir of anything. When his father was sentenced to life in Azkaban, and Draco was cleared of all charges, all his father’s assets became his. He was the last Malfoy, and he had every intention that the name Malfoy would die with him.
“The M.L.E.P. guys took those two bastards off for questioning I think,” said Pansy snidely.
She was looking down at Draco, and her jaw had a determined set. He was afraid of what she might say. She was steeling herself for something.
Draco crossed his arms.
“This was Hermione’s idea?” Draco asked suspiciously. That girl was up to something,  and he could probably guess what.
He glanced over at Draco, smiling ruefully.
“This seems more intense than it should be for an errand trip to Hogsmeade,” he probed gently, waving a hand to indicate the piles of discarded clothes on Draco’s bed.
Draco immediately relaxed. Their eyes met and they both started laughing.
He refused to look at Draco again as they paid, and pulled on their coats to go back out onto the freezing street.
“Hey man, taking pictures ain’t illegal!”
“Remind me to jinx her later.”
Some violence and mentions of implied past violence in this chapter. Also a lot of time talking about Draco’s hair to make up for it.
Finch-Fletchley bounced onto the end of his bed and stared at Draco with wide eyes.
“Blaise!” Pansy exclaimed shrilly.
He put down his quill and crossed his arms.
Draco shook out Potter’s blankets and pulled them over him, tucking in the corners.
It was almost one twenty, and Draco was convinced that this had been Potter’s evil plan all along, when he finally arrived. He looked flustered and slightly panicked as he scanned around the restaurant. When he spotted Draco, he hurried over, like rushing now would make a difference.
“Both of us are exceptionally beautiful,” Draco agreed.
I spoke in defence of Malfoy at his trial, and he was cleared. Are you doubting my word Terry? The only reason we were in a war was because of this bullshit ‘us and them' mentality. If we keep looking at everything as black and white, then how are we any better than Voldemort?”
“OK, OK, chill. I’m not getting up early to wave everyone off with a hanky. Shall we say midday? The common room will be empty by then.”
Draco knew he had been to every class they shared so far this week, and possibly all his other classes too. Maybe he was trying to prove a point to the Headmistress? Did he need help with homework? Surely that would be something he would go to Hermione for.
Blaise had gone from a casual acquaintance to one of his closest friends through those shopping trips. Pansy had been terribly jealous when she’d found out, but when she came back from France at the end of the summer, she bought him Parisian couture and he knew he was forgiven.
“No matter what the situation was, there are more than a dozen witnesses attesting to the fact that you attacked first, with minimal provocation. That you continued to attack even after the other man was wandless. That you had been drinking heavily. I can’t stop any of those people from reporting this evening to the papers. We have confiscated the camera as evidence, but that will only prevent photographs of the fight being published, and that won’t stop them from trying again. You must not give them that opportunity.”
“Tonight isn’t a night for spilling secrets,” he said mischievously, “tonight is a night for making new ones.”
“Ah!” declared Pansy from across the table, “a new member for the Pining Gays Club.”
He shuffled to the door in his socks, and it was only as he began to pull it open that his sleep muddled brain realised who it must be on the other side.
Potter pulled out his cigarettes as soon as they were outside, and lit one. He walked in silence, one hand shoved in his jeans pocket. It was still softly snowing, the ground crunching underfoot, and Potter wasn’t wearing his jacket.
Then the war was over.
“You’re right.”
Lunch meant casual attire would be appropriate, but he still wanted to look nice.
She studied him for a moment longer, and then picked up her magazine. Draco was relieved she had clearly decided to drop it for now, but not 5 minutes later she began to laugh loudly. She wheezed, clutching her stomach, and flapped the magazine towards him. He stared at her in alarm, before realising she had Witch Weekly open to the centre spread. A bold headline across the top of the piece proclaimed “Harry Potter and the Women in his Life: Which Witch will the Chosen One Choose?”
Draco felt a clench of recognition, but he didn’t think he’d be able to let go of his pain.
“We didn’t get to finish our conversation,” he said accusingly.
“What’re you doing?” he asked when Draco met his gaze.
Draco didn’t tell Pansy and Blaise about what had happened, mainly because he had no idea what HAD happened. The train journey was peaceful once they had settled in. Pansy told anecdotes about her travels around France over the summer, knowing full well that Draco wouldn’t have much to contribute. He’d been under house arrest for most of the summer. He tried to pay attention to her and not think about Potter, or his mother, or what awaited him at the end of the train ride.
Potter appeared, his hair a shambled mess and his clothes a rumpled disaster. A lit cigarette hung precariously from the corner of his mouth, and when the smell of it reached Draco he wrinkled his nose in disgust. There were bags under Potter’s eyes, rough stubble on his cheeks, and a patchwork of mouth shaped purple bruises up his exposed neck. The sight of them made Draco blush.
“I can’t keep secrets from her! She can smell secrets on me, she’ll torture me relentlessly. Can’t you just explain it to her?”
The attendant steps back, and Zaira says, “My usual, and the same for Mr. Potter. My normal companion should be joining as momentarily.”
only absorb patronus magic, but you know how weird things get down here, so I’d try and keep a fresh barrier spell around it if you can.”
, Nagini.” Again, she hisses, and again, he has no idea what that means. He gets off of her and, with only the smallest hesitation, lets go of her head.
“Dad!” Draco cries.
“Avada kedavra,” Narcissa says, throwing out the unforgivable as casually has she had the scourgify. It hits the man on the roof, and so if he wasn’t dead before he certainly is now.
Blaise rolls his eyes, “The Browns came to Britain about a thousand years before we did, I don’t think we have anything to worry about. I probably have more blood in common with you than them.”
“You don’t have to do something just because you’re good at it,” Filius says gently.
Harry blinks, looking over to her. “Uh. Thanks? But you don’t need to.”
“Enough!” Voldemort roars, and then he uses the same wind spell Harry had been thinking about using earlier, sending them tumbling back, and he hears the clatter of a wand falling to the floor.
Sharon shakes her head and they’re back to the same grim, simmering rage they’d entered the great hall with. “It’s not that he wouldn’t answer. We couldn’t find him. He’s lost.”
For several long moments, nothing happens. He’s just getting ready to try again when the door swings open to reveal a short, scowling girl with light brown skin and a scarf pinned close to her head. “
“We’ll go ask Hagrid,” Hermione decides. “He’ll know about them.”
Neville and Millie are pouring over the scroll of ideas that Hermione and Millie had helped him come up with, whittling their initial brainstorming session down to something reasonable for him to teach to a bunch of teenagers. The twins are busy whispering to each other over a thick book that no one has managed to get a proper look at, which isn’t comforting.
“Met before?” Slughorn whimpers.
Harry tells him what happened, endures his scolding, then says, “How’s Blaise’s house?”
“Great,” he says, waiting until Poppy has raised her wand to end the pain numbing spell.
It’s Mr. Weasley, standing in front of a door with his wand held in front of him. What is he doing? Why is he just standing there? He should run! Unless – is he guarding the door? From what? Snakes?
Her eyebrows draw together. At that moment, the portrait swings open and Neville rushes inside, soil clinging to his hands and smudged across his robes. “Sorry I’m late!”
Draco is ecstatic, probably more at being on a first name basis with the basilisk than anything else, but Winky wrinkles her nose and looks around. “I is going to be needing help to clean this place in time.”
Then his soulmate proves that he’s
“Mutations, growth, what’s the difference really?” Neville asks. Blaise glares and he adds, “We should figure out how to do it successfully and then we can figure out how to do it consistently.”
It’s a signed note to Madame Pince giving him permission to check out
“You need to get more sleep,” Harry says. The permanent dark circles under his eyes are looking especially cavernous. Hopefully after the election he’ll be able to run away with Tonks and take a nice long nap.
When Millie looks back at him, her smile isn’t quite as wide as it was before. “Hi Draco! Thanks for coming to get me.”
“You might as well invite your friends to help,” Remus adds. “Between Ron and Hermione, I can’t imagine we’ll miss anything.”
They’ve all taken a couple steps towards the door when Arthur walks forward, his eldest sons trailing behind him. Fleur and Tonks are behind them, and they’ve got a look on their face like they want to get involved too, but are holding back. For now. Harry’s pretty sure that Fleur is dying to jump in. “Kids, hold on. Molly, we talked about this.”
Standing at the top of the stairs are Blaise and Zaira, who has her hand tucked into the crook of her son’s elbow. Blaise isn’t as tall as Ron, but he’s close, and he must have enjoyed the Italian sun, because his skin is even darker than when Harry saw him last. He’s in a set of pure white dress robes that give Harry anxiety just to look at. Blaise is pristine, and he wonders if it’s because of a spell, since Harry knows he wouldn’t be able to take more than two steps before getting something on them. He’s looking out at everything with a look of bored disdain, his perfectly tailored robes emphasizing his broad shoulders, and Harry has to admit that of all his friends, Blaise is objectively the
He says, “I forgot.”
They all freeze, softly floating through the water with the current. He doesn’t know how long it will hold them, so he hurries on his way. His arm is bleeding something awful, and he doesn’t want to stop, but he also doesn’t want to bleed out in the middle of the lake. He skims along the sandy floor until he finds a long, thick piece of seaweed, and he wraps it around his wound and keeps it all in place with a sticking charm. He’s not sure how sanitary it is, but he figures as long as his arm doesn’t fall off Pomfrey will manage to fix any damage he does.
They’re glaring at each other, which rather feels like watching an unstoppable force go up against an immovable object. Ron runs his hand through his hair. “As much as I hate to agree with my sister, she’s right. We should go investigate. If it’s dead, we should take care of the body and use the chamber to hold lessons in.”
“Fuck!” he shouts, their adventure in the ministry coming back to him in a rush. “Is everyone - did we -”
Harry sighs and grabs the back of Draco’s robe, pulling him back, and this time Draco doesn’t resist.
Not one or two, but all of them, dozens and dozens swarming around them in their search for Black. He, Hermione, and Harry fall to ground, nowhere to run and suddenly too tired to move even if they could.
He’s a necromancer. He’s a Mother. He knows how to come home.
The campground may be run by muggles, but the town surrounding it is mostly magical. That means the only thing separating him from the floo network is a couple miles of walking, and the one awkward conversation it will take to convince someone to let him use their fireplace.
“Here!” Winky cries as she appears back in the room, pushing the book into Draco’s hip.
Fleur and Bill’s faces contort into identical expressions of outrage.
“Malfoy,” Harry greets warily, the way his eyebrows are pressed together a sign that he’s confused.
“Still haven’t found it?” she asks mockingly, “I thought you didn’t care, that it was stupid and a hiding place for stupid girls.”
“Does he know about it,” Amelia repeats, scoffing.
over me? Over your safety, over your own life? Over your wife’s life?” he hisses.
He shrugs as best he can in Fred’s grasp. “Probably.”
Zaira shifts her head just enough so her braids obscure her face while Kingsley waves a hand dismissively. “Oh, don’t worry about it, I wasn’t ever really in the running.”
He’s gone almost before he’s finished speaking.
“We were running late because someone was so sure she could figure out how to collapse the wards in the next section of the tunnel,” Bill begins.
It takes several long minutes for Draco to pull away, licking his lips and gaze half lidded, which is a new form of torture, because that just makes Harry want to kiss him all over again. “We have to go find the basilisk,” Draco mutters.
“What did Mum say?” he asks, because there’s no way his dad didn’t talk to her about it.
“Amelia Bones?” he repeats, raising an eyebrow.
Lucius shakes his head. “No. No, don’t, it’s – don’t.”
Pansy snorts, but Ron seems satisfied, obnoxiously ruffling Draco’s hair. “Good.”
“I’m really glad you’re here,” he blurts, “but we’re going to have to wait to hang out. I’m going to be in the meeting too.”
Blaise sighs, clearly reading the look on his face. “If I let you buy in, will you stop pouting?”
There’s a crack, and Dobby appears. “I is doing as Mister Harry asks!” he beams, then he gets a good look at Arthur. “Oh, no, Dobby is not dealing with that snake. That snake is being for Winky to deal with.” He disappears with another crack.
“Why should I?” he asks. He doesn’t sound aggressive or dismissive. He doesn’t sound like much of anything, really. If Harry was forced to categorize the sound of his voice, then Harry would almost say he sounds bored.
“Did you?” Mille asks.
“That won’t be necessary,” he says, because he’s a
Harry likes his hair down, but there’s a low simmer of irritation at the bottom of his stomach at all the ways his day has gone just slightly off kilter that he knows he couldn’t stand it getting in his face right now, so he compromises and quickly plaits it down his back. Harry can undo it later, he has a thing about his hair, so he’ll enjoy tugging apart the tight braid.
Poppy looks him straight in the eye, as serious as he’s ever seen her. “I saw how you healed Fleur, and I knew.”
as if he’s about to cry.
Two arms settle over his shoulders before he gets a chance to answer to that, and Fred and George are crowding in on either side. “Cassius, my good man,” George says cheerfully. “How’s that transfiguration essay going? Well? You know I’m always eager to help, if you need it.”
“That was good,” Sirius says, “Merlin, how come no one told me you were funny?”
Draco paces. Harry needs know, and he has no way of sneaking into the Gryffindor common room to tell him, since he let Harry keep the polyjuice potion. He could send Luna to do it, she has friends in Gryffindor. But then he’d have to send his cousin to walk the corridors when there's some sort of snake that’s trying to kill people, and there’s no way his mother would be okay with that. Then again, she’d probably be less okay with him walking those same corridors, but he can’t help that.
to do those things?”
“And if that doesn’t work?” Slughorn asks.
“That, Ronald, is because you never turn in any of your fucking homework, even though you
,” she says, speaking French once more. “
He doesn’t know what McGonagall wears to bed, so he just summons one of his mother’s nightgowns, which is long and silk and pale blue. Then he realizes it doesn’t cover the soulmark on her forearm, and he summons the robe to match. His mum has like forty of them, and this one isn’t even her favorite. She won’t mind, if she even notices at all.
“Well, she’s not taking all the credit,” Percy says. “I walked by them earlier. She was going on about a house elf. Which is nice and all, but lots of designers have support teams, it doesn’t change that it’s her design.”
(she's added more since the last chapter!)
Hermione pulls the Chimera map out of her bag, scanning it. “They’re in bed.”
He thinks of using his wand to levitate everything in place first, but he’s supposed to be saying sorry, he’s supposed to be trying to help, and he doesn’t think treating her nephew’s body like sacks of flour will do that.
Moody tries to face her again, but it’s too late. A neat cut slashes across his throat, cutting off his voice, leaving him wide eyed and gurgling as he falls to his knees.
He sighs and turns back to the bed. Draco’s buried back under the blankets and he lets out a muffled, “Have fun, dear.”
“The second task is in a week, who has time for that?” she asks. “Good luck Harry, try not to drown.”
“And it fits with our current location,” Quinn points out.
A couple more people step forward like they’re thinking of joining in, and the Gryffindors match them, since they’re apparently incapable of not getting involved in a fight at every opportunity. He assumes Ron’s hand around Harry’s wrist is all that’s keeping his soulmate from bodily throwing himself into this mess.
He looks at the hallway full of dejected students and Sprout’s rather limp smile, towards the great hall, then back again. “Ah, maybe I uh, shouldn’t? I’m, um, really tired. From all the, you know, fighting Voldemort and stuff.”
Everyone else who’s hung over and exhausted just get to suffer.
“I thought you needed an O to take it?” Harry asks.
they’re having a spring wedding! It’s too soon! I have so much work to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. Thank merlin for Winky, honestly. At least this time it’s not entirely made out of lace. If I had to handmake that much lace this time, I couldn’t do it even with Winky’s help.”
Draco is playing a tricky game, a balancing act where he has different faces for everyone. Only five people know all of him, only Pansy, Blaise, Ron, Hermione, and Harry know all his secrets, from his disdain of Voldemort to the marigolds on his hip. He has to look like a Dark Lord supporter to most people, but his house knows him as a moderate, while there are plenty of people who suspect he’s more liberal than he lets on, or even know it for a fact, but – can he really afford to say something in front of everyone, with all their eyes on him?
Abigail lifts her head up next to Nagini, and what the hell, Harry hadn’t even known that she was here. Although Harry supposes he should have guessed that Draco wouldn’t feel comfortable leaving her at the manor without Nagini there to protect her. He can’t magic his parents out of that horrible situation, but he can at least rescue his snake.
“Shouldn’t you be in school?” Fleur scolds, but she’s grinning.
Several hours later, Harry has shown him if not every room in the house (that would take far too long) then at least the most well trafficked. They find Ron and Hermione in one of the spare rooms, heads bent over an alchemy circle and arguing about it. From the bit of their conversation Draco manages to overhear, it sounds like they’re trying to make a structure using the circle, which sounds complicated and interesting, so of course Harry drags him out of there before he can even ask them about it. Rude.
(she's added more since the last chapter!)
“My apologies,” his soulmate’s voice drawls.
“Surely not!” the man cries, turning to him and beaming. “Your adventures sound most interesting, Harry, you must tell me more about them sometime.”
“Do you think Malfoy’s dad will really put Buckbeak on trial?” Hermione asks, seated in between them and speaking softly enough that only Ron and Harry can hear her.
Ron perks up enough to ask, “Hold on, are you telling me that Blaise’s mum’s little murder sprees are politically motivated?”
“Why?” Draco asks, wrinkling his nose. All he really wants is a shower.
It’s too bad that everything they’re doing to replicate Gryffindor’s sword has to remain a secret. They’ll almost definitely be able to squeeze a couple good articles out of that, except they definitely can’t do that, because replicating it hast to be a secret.
, not a sport. Presentation matters, and Viktor is a statue on his broom. He centers his gravity, but then he does not
More drinking, homophobic language, and violence in this chapter.
“Study period too, but I doubt anyone would be worrying if I don’t show up where I’m supposed to be, they never usually do.” He grimaced.
Draco smiled back at him and shrugged.
Maybe he’d get lucky, and spending actual time with Potter would cure him of this infatuation. He was probably really boring when you spent a lot of time in his company.
Draco froze in surprise.
He looked at her through his fingers. She wasn’t letting him off the hook, but she still wanted to talk to him.
“I wasn’t talking about Potter,” he looked pointedly at her.
He gathered his shreds of courage and rapped smartly on Potter’s door.
She ignored him, and looked at Draco.
“This is brilliant though Draco,” Justin continued, ignoring his embarrassment, “Harry doesn’t normally do dates. He must like you.”
“Hmmmm... Never have I ever had sex with more than one person on the same day.”
“OK, what would you do if you could do anything?” he asked wistfully.
The atmosphere in the room plummeted so quickly Draco’s head swam. The Slytherin’s all turned murderous expressions on Boot and even Justin looked angry. Everyone else looked uncomfortable. Draco’s gut twisted painfully, but it wasn’t new information to anyone, Boot was just trying to remind them all he was an outsider.
Draco just shrugged. Padma rolled her eyes.
Weasley and Lovegood deposited him against one of the beds. He wrapped an arm across the burning in his chest with a groan.
“Well I thought it was an emergency.”
He fidgeted with the tiny coffee cup, slightly at a loss for what to do now. Potter seemed to feel the same.
“What are your plans for Christmas?” she asked.
“None of that matters,” Blaise declared grandly, handing Draco a cup with something blue in it. It tasted like pineapple. “Once everyone is sufficiently relaxed, we’ll start a proper Slytherin game. I need to find out all their murky little secrets. They can’t be real people to me unless I do. I’d also like to get Turpin to take her top off, but that’s less important.”
She lunged at him and wrapped her arms around his middle, burying her face in his chest. He tried not to whimper as she squeezed his bruised body.
Draco snorted.
“No need to apologise, we love entertainment at breakfast,” said Blaise happily.
They were saved for a moment by the arrival of the waiter, who bought them some menus, and filled the water glasses.
“Of course. Why do you think I’m forbidding it. Anyway, I was just having a study session with Ravenclaw Patil, and you’re wasting time talking about me?”
When Pansy asked him what he wanted to do on Saturday, he panicked and told her he had to finish his Charms essay, which was a blatant lie. He finished all his homework for the following week by Friday evening, channelling his nervous energy into being productive. Just in case.
“Did you always know?” Draco whispered, not wanting to break the silence, but needing to ask.
Potter’s anger was contained under a calm facade now. He straightened lazily and turned his back on Howard, smiling winningly at Madam Rosmerta. She had appeared behind the bar, worrying a dish cloth in her hands, her eyes assessing the situation with a frown. Draco didn’t move. He couldn’t look away from a potential threat.
Draco snorted.
“I think people always assume everyone is straight. Sometimes only because of the fear of being presumptuous, but mostly because that’s the way the world is. And I think you’ve had no success with Ravenclaw Patil because you haven’t actually ever spoken to her.”
Draco grabbed Potter by the shoulders and started steering him towards his room. Potter perked up at once.
Pansy looked up from her yoghurt.
Blaise pulled Pansy to her feet and dragged her back into the press of bodies. The whole room seemed to be moving and pulsing to the rhythm of the music. Draco stayed where he was and let it all wash over him.
More violence and injury in this chapter, buckle up...
No matter his recent behaviour, Harry Potter was still an influential figure in society. If Potter was willing to publicly date him, it would be tantamount to him forgiving Draco’s past sins. That would have to go some way to clearing his own reputation just a bit. Enough to help his future. It might even be enough to stop the other students violent reactions towards him.
Draco’s hands shook as he was compelled to drink, downing the contents of his glass.
Pansy threw her magazine aside excitedly. Blaise sat down with a casual air and smoothed his shirt front. It must be excellent gossip if he was drawing it out like this.
“I never forget a party darling,” she said sipping her tea.
“You think?”
Blaise let out a sigh of relief when he saw Draco was awake.
Draco shook his head fervently.
In the month that followed the party the rumour mill was working overtime. Gossip about Potter and his night time exploits, sometimes day time exploits, ran like fiend fire through the school. Whispers in the Great Hall. Notes passed in classes. Graffiti in the toilets. Potter was spotted behind greenhouse 3 with a sixth year Hufflepuff. Potter was caught in the Prefects bathroom with a Ravenclaw Prefect and the Head boy. Potter was seen coming out of a broom closet with a Gryffindor seventh year.
“You’ll find the entrance in the Long Gallery, behind a tapestry of Carpathe taming a phoenix.” She smiled slightly, “the password is Unity.”
“This isn’t some sort of trick is it?” he blurted out, before he could stop himself.
Without any greeting Blaise turned on Draco and spat, “Weasley snores,” as though Draco had planned the room assignments specifically to annoy him.
Draco disliked the place too. Unfortunately it was the only place to get a good cup of coffee in the village. The maple scones were a pretty big draw as well, but the decor was just atrocious. He didn’t think Potter would care about something like that though.
She looked at him, focusing.
“What?”
“You OK Justin?” he asked suspiciously.
He sat alone for a while, before he realised he could finally escape.
It was war.
Quite a few people along the table looked up in shock, including Granger a few seats away. Weasley huffed behind Luna, and went around the table to sit with Granger. They put their heads together and started whispering.
The players settled in a loose semi circle around the fireplace. Draco sat on the floor in front of Pansy, leaning against her legs. She ran her fingers lightly through his wavy hair. He was suddenly nervous, and he felt all jittery. Justin came and sprawled out next to him, and squeezed his shoulder. Draco felt a little better.
“I was looking for you for ever such a long time!... but then I got side tracked! Where have you been hiding?” She shouted, waving her arms around and nearly falling backwards.
They sat quietly together, Granger watching him while he picked at his cuticles.
Granger grinned at him mischievously.
It sounded like it could be an awkward group so far, and Justin had a habit of rolling right over awkwardness with his sunny disposition. Any buffer he could get between himself and Potter would be a bonus.
He scratched away for half an hour, rewording and editing what he wanted to say until it looked acceptable. When he was finally satisfied, he pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment, and copied out the finished letter in his neatest handwriting.
I'm glad I decided to post on a Wednesday, I was stupidly giddy all day yesterday and this morning. I've already written quite a chunk of this, it's going to be long but I'm determined to get it finished. Thank you for the Kudos already guys! ~Kisses~
“...But I thought Parkinson and Malfoy were...” Brown blurted out, looking extremely confused.
A brief flurry of conversation picked up around the group as people decided if they wanted to play or not. Some got up, looking nervous, and moved off to sit on the other side of the common room. All the Gryffindor’s remained, plus MacMillan and Justin, Turpin and Padma Patil, and the Slytherin’s, except for Theo who had passed out asleep in a chair closest to the fire.
Draco looked up quickly, and saw Granger’s hand freeze over her page of notes on the other side of the table. He glared at Pansy, but she glared right back at him.
Draco hadn’t had much contact with Beckett, as he didn’t take Defence anymore. The man radiated a calm authority, which eased some of the churning in Draco’s stomach, but didn’t entirely win him over.
“And you’re... OK with that?” She asked, confused.
“Nothing?” he replied, drawing the word out into a question, “I’m staying here.”
He was confused for a moment, before he remembered the cut on his palm and getting blood on his face. He looked down at his hand, surprised it was still aching. He realised he’d forgotten to heal himself when he’d healed Potter’s arms.
He looked up to see Potter watching him intently again, frowning.
Potter’s smile remained fixed but his expression darkened around his eyes, and he glanced down at his right hand. The skin across his knuckles had split.
He leaned down against the bar, content to wait for Madam Rosmerta. The pub was crowded and loud. He was enjoying the atmosphere, and being out of school for an evening. Having a night out with friends was something he didn’t think he would get to have after the war.
The room Potter shared with Theo was so messy it made Draco twitch. He only knew which bed belonged to Potter because he saw his new Firebolt leaning against the wall on the right side of the room. There were clothes everywhere, dirty or clean Draco couldn’t tell. Half the mugs from the common room seemed to have found their way in here, balancing precariously on every surface, mostly still half full of cold tea and cigarette butt’s. The draws in the chest of draws were all hanging open. A half eaten ham sandwich was resting on a pile of school books, and old Quiddich magazines were strewn about. The bed sheets were in chaos, and Draco felt his whole body flush when he spotted a bottle of lube lying casually on the shelf beside the bed.
“Are we talking like first year ooooor recently?” asked Weasley, chuckling.
“Do you think your Death Eater mates showed my cousin any mercy when she begged for her life?”
“Harry fuckin’ Potter,” the man boomed in a heavy Scottish accent, swaying slightly. The people nearest them froze. Potter stiffened.
The Minister looked at him for the first time since they’d arrived.
Draco nodded, embarrassed all over again.
Beckett marched to the Minister’s side, leaning forwards to mutter into his ear. McDonald perched on the edge of McGonagall’s desk in a familiar way. Out of the other Professor’s eye line, she was grinning cheekily at them. When she caught Draco watching her, she winked.
Beyond the crowds at King’s Cross Station, through the magical barrier between platforms 9 and 10, the gleaming scarlet steam engine stood waiting, bathing platform 9 ¾ in white smoke.
“Your memory is amazing,” he said, a little enviously.
Luna turned her wide eyes on Potter, smiling gently.
Beckett handed the cameraman over to one of the Patrol Officers. He squawked, making a fuss.
“Do you want to run through the Arithmancy exercises?” Granger asked, her business-like formality breaking up the awkward tension.
“I’m so happy to welcome you all here today,” McGonagall began, pausing to smile around at the overcrowded Hall. “We have emerged from a terrible darkness. We have faced many battles, and tragedies. We have lost friends and family. Let’s take a moment of silence to remember all those who were taken from us.”
“Well?” Pansy demanded, bouncing a little on her seat, “don’t torture me Blaise!”
Draco watched him silently.
“You’ve been in the wars Mr Malfoy. Would you like me to send for the Headmistress?” she asked gently.
“Harry and Ron are my only family right now, and I can’t even keep them together,” she sighed, scrubbing a hand across her damp face.
As the blond started undoing the clasps of his robes, the layers changed once more,  filtering the powdery soft scent of shyness in with the others. Harry hastily dropped his own clothing to the ground, forming a little pile from both sets of robes. As Harry moved in, Draco’s cheeks burned red, but that wasn’t going to stop him. While Harry would stop if he was asked, the embarrassment seemed to be stemming from a different place. Perhaps at submitting so thoroughly to Harry’s desires, or maybe at being so exposed beneath the golden Gryffindor. Whatever the reasons, Harry was ravenous for his former nemesis.
Bill explained that nothing compared to Fleur’s scent on a regular day, but on the week leading up to a full moon? Forget it. His inner wolf was typically mild-mannered, and calm, but he claimed that during that one week, her scent was stronger than any lust potion. He’d place money on it.
Breaking the kiss, Harry pulled back to watch as Draco’s lashes fluttered against rosy-hued cheeks. It was sweet, but he needed more. Desperately so. “Your robes are going to get a little dirty. Better take them off.” Harry mused with a tone that was more command than polite request. Draco responded in turn with an expression that seemed both shocked and incredibly aroused at being bossed around so smoothly.
“I’m fine.” Harry replied mundanely.
“Hardly. If anything, you were far gentler than I expected given the full moon is tomorrow.”
“It seems your physiology takes over in the case of potions like this. For lack of a better explanation, it seems you are immune to the potion’s effects, Mr Potter. On your way then.”
“Not yet, you’re not,” Draco commanded.
“Touch yourself for me,” Harry growled against him.
On his right side, Harry flicked a glance to where Draco Malfoy was working. Unlike Harry, it seemed the task at hand was taking a lot out of him physically. He still had Draco’s wand, which meant the former Slytherin had to be using something new. All in all, he appeared exhausted and overdrawn.
Hermione gasped, but Harry felt like he’d missed something.
’. Not that he was bothered by the need driving his entire system forward. Not when each inhale of the jersey made his cock harder, or his blood rush through him faster. Settling into a rather strange rhythm, Harry alternated languid hip thrusts right up against the side of the mattress, with inhales of the jersey. It was probably a horrible idea—one he’d likely either feel sick over or at least mentally chastise himself over later—but Harry let his mind wander, imagining burrowing himself deep inside his former nemesis.
“Ah! There we are. Much better. Oh-Heavens Dear, when was the last time you had a wash?” Molly blinked.
“I just worry about you, Harry. We all do. You’ve already done so much for the wizarding world… For the whole world.” Ron continued, his voice softening as he brought his wand up to aid Harry.
People went by him without noticing, most simply laughing and talking game stats to each other, before hitting the showers. Harry, however, was stuck in that one moment. The moment when his whole world came crashing down around him because of Draco’s
“Oh.” Harry said simply.
killed Draco? By not giving his wand back?” Harry tried to connect the dots in his mind, but was struggling to get past this particular hurdle.
bad thing. At least, that’s what he continued to tell himself as he ran full tilt towards the castle.
Even Hagrid had a smaller project (or so he claimed) that had to do with mucking out stalls and other rather dirty work. Not that Harry was opposed to it, but the one that caught his eye the most would pair him with Madam Hooch. There were a few league teams looking to add to their ranks, and it was up to them to determine if any were good enough to play professionally. Harry felt he had a good eye for talent, having added some rather spectacular players to Griffindor’s team in the past.
“No. Not for—
“Harry…” Sirius’ voice called out to him, and for a second, Harry considered running right into his arms.
“Excuse
“F-fuck, Potter! You can’t just,” Draco paused, a moan unable to be held back despite his chatter. “Don’t make promises you’ll regret in a few days, when the moon is waning.”
Harry frowned, wondering if he’d been right afterall.
There was a kind of exhaustion Harry felt these days, that went beyond physical. With the weight of his entire eighteen years now over, and the prophecy shadowing him now fulfilled, he should have felt relieved or at least less tired. But after spending some time over the summer with the best of St Mungo’s therapy Wixen, Harry was starting to understand that he was weighted down with the full understanding of everything he’d seen and that had happened to him. Their recommendation was to return to Hogwarts for a final year, to close out the chapter of his youth. This also allowed time to simply be young and carefree, even for a short time.
The air was muddled with Draco’s scent, peppered with the scent of both of their arousals, and fuck if that wasn’t the most life-changing thing Harry had ever smelled. He was starting to understand what Bill had been talking about before. Despite what they’d gone through, or the fact they could scarcely even be considered friends, Harry would die for Draco. There was something about the feral bonding scent building between them that labeled Draco as Harry’s. If not to anyone else, it was clear as day for Harry.
In the days following his visit to St Mungo’s, Harry had locked himself away in Grimmauld place. The blinds were drawn across every window with the exception of the little library. As if the weather was emulating his feelings, the skies poured down in sadness for days on end. Harry sat in his plush armchair—having turned it to face the window—wrapped in a blanket, and stayed unless his body physically required him to move.
’ and what she is trying to go for with us older students, but honestly. This is too far.”
“There’s really only one right choice, Harry.” Sirius murmured from among the crowd.
With term starting up again, Harry found himself devouring the workload in a way he hadn’t truly appreciated in the past—without his mind constantly occupied by looming doom. Hermione had found herself a new dedicated study companion, which Harry liked to think was also her way of ignoring her rather messy breakup with Ron. Or rather his with her. Actually, Harry wasn’t entirely sure who was responsible for what, but what he did know was that Ron hadn’t planned to return to Hogwarts, Hermione did, and for some reason everything stopped working.
“Draco…”
“Did I hurt you at all?” Harry asked, voice a soft murmur. Draco made a scoffing noise.
“Oh, poor desperate boy,” Draco smirked into their kiss. “I know what will help.”
“Fine. If I promise to get a little rougher with you, will you promise to do this again with me?” Harry proposed. Internally, he was embarrassed at having put the words out there, but by Merlin, he knew there was no way he could live without drowning in Draco’s scent again and again.
“Was it a curse?” He inquired after taking a seat, Hermione sitting carefully at his side.
“What the hell was that? Sounded like something.. Like a-” Pansy started.
Yes, in all likelihood, the regret would kick-in shortly. But for a singular moment, Harry felt...content. Sated. Almost happy.
When the morning returned, Harry rolled over onto his stomach, feeling drained and fuzzy from the day before. Molly was right of course; the more he allowed himself to succumb to the maudlin emotions threatening to overwhelm everything, the more he started to confuse dreams with real life.
picture some unknown person bent forward in front of him, chest pressed into the mattress, arse up and willing, as Harry pressed into him.
“Fuck,” Harry breathed. Struggling to swallow past the saliva building up in his throat, Harry watched his fantasy come to life as Draco stroked himself.
“What the-” Harry practically shouted, startled by the sight of blond hair fanned out across a feather pillow.
’ with Professor Slughorn—which seemed to focus on both potions and working with Healers at St Mungo’s—to ‘
If Harry was ever asked to pinpoint the exact moment he knew he was completely and utterly fucked, it would be the second Draco Malfoy threw his soiled jersey at Harry’s face—post Quidditch game.
“Hnng.”
“I can’t control it,” Harry hissed. There was heat radiating between them, though given the last two incidents, Harry was sure it was mostly coming off of him. Still, despite his attempts to let go and walk—or run—away, Harry pressed his body closer. Mistake. Huge mistake.
“I went to the morgue… I kissed your head… You…” Harry shuddered. “I never got to tell you…”
“Hermione…” Harry made a noise, while clutching his chest. He wasn’t okay, but he knew he had to be strong for Draco. At least here, with only Hermione to see him fall apart, he could let go for a moment, and be terrified that there was a high chance he would lose yet another person he was starting to love.
The blond sent a kick towards his companion, encouraging her to not only look up, but to also perhaps depart and let them be. Whatever the secret signal was, Pansy took one look at Harry, and jettisoned out of there at practically the speed of light—leaving Draco and Harry to stare at each other across a few feet.
“I need a word.”
There was no need to look around and figure out what everyone was doing. He could hear it in the shrieks and shouts of the students finding out their pairing assignments, running up and down the tower stairs.
It was time to wake up, and make a list of things that would help him move forward out of the fog. Shower, dress, make a pot of tea, maybe call Hermione and Ron and-
“I understand how you feel Harry, and I know how it feels to need the sweet relief of dissociating. But doing so comes at the cost of pushing everyone away, especially when they need it most.”
Now that they were a mere few steps apart, Harry could see the weariness in all its fine detail. The dark circles under his eyes were so stark, contrasting to the pale skin gone sallow from lack of rest. Even the former sparkle in Draco’s eyes had dulled to a plain grey. Lines marred the otherwise clear skin of his face, making him appear far older than Harry knew him to be. It wasn’t a genetic thing, because neither Lucius nor Narcissa had shown any signs of age until they were playing house with Voldemort.
The fireplace let out a crackling, whooshing sound that signaled Molly Weasley’s arrival into Grimmauld Place.
But by the time the day came for both of them to make a selection, neither of them could agree. Draco wanted to do something related to potions, and Harry was still determined to work with the Quidditch teams—but their arguing took so long that they arrived five minutes late to the sign ups, making them the last pair.
“Nngh, gonna—” Harry started to warn, but Draco pulled off with a light pinch to Harry’s bollocks.
“Harry, you always try to do everything right. And that’s not fair for those of us with a penchant for fucking up.” Draco chuckled. “I just want to get through the rest of this rebuild, and then maybe we can go away somewhere? Just the two of us?”
“I can’t. You know I can’t.” Harry’s voice was filled with the kind of angst that is made up of a thousand and one losses.
“No, no, I don’t know.”
’ Draco murmured as Harry sank to his knees, practically shouting as his orgasm overcame him. His shots of come washed down the drain before he could even think about everything that had just happened. Including the sure amounts of guilt he was likely to experience the next time he came face to face with Draco. Pun excluded.
It was a million questions packed into one word.
“I do need to do this though, Hermione. I need answers, otherwise I’ll never be able to move forward.”
His mind was clouded over with lust, hardly a coherent thought besides ‘
Harry shuddered. He’d always imagined meeting death would be like truly meeting an old friend, but instead he was reminded of skeletal dementors and their ability to drain the happiness right out of him.
“What!?” Harry exclaimed, practically shooting up from the bed. It was all too convenient, but it was there all the same.
“Alright there, Malfoy?” Harry called out to the passing blond, who looked up with a rather perplexed expression. Steel-grey eyes narrowed, but the blond head bowed in a nod. At least they were trying. That was all Harry could ask for.
“Then don’t,” Draco replied, confidently.
“Ha-Harry! What on Earth!” Draco tried to get some clear kind of answer from him, but Harry was verbally unresponsive. His head shook back and forth as it burrowed into Draco’s neck, while broken sobs, mostly relief, escaped between Harry’s ragged breaths. It took a moment, during which Draco simply wrapped his own arms around Harry, and kissed the top of his head repeatedly.
“Ah, Mr Potter.” The kindly old Medi-Witch entered the room with them, offering a sympathetic smile at their situation. “I think perhaps, you ought to sit down.”
He frowned at her, surprised.
“I’m sorry. Thank you. So sorry,” she gasped, before fleeing off down the corridor.
'I'm teasing you now.' Draco, though, hadn't quite caught on yet.
Granger hissed again. She furiously whispered, "Harry

In black ink and thick, bold lettering, the headline read,
"Nice to see you, Weasley," Draco said mildly.
That prospect exhausted him. Life exhausted him.
Harry was patient, and he waited him out in silence, letting Draco gather his thoughts. Harry traced absentminded and comforting circles across Draco’s chest.

Anyway, he almost mowed me down in the doorway of the apothecary, and he started apologizing in super-fast French (did you know he spoke French?) before he realized it was me. He looked as uncomfortable as I felt, so that’s a plus. And you know how bad I am at small talk, but it turns out, under all his pointy-ness and his ridiculous posh accent, he’s as bad at it as I am. It put us in a great position, let me tell you!

The Muggle pub was loud, but that was one of the reasons Draco favored it. The noise was comforting — mindless and happy-sounding — and he’d been here many times with Pansy and Theo after the war. He enjoyed the anonymity of the place and how he could get lost in the crowd of Muggles — Muggles who couldn’t give two shits about his past and whose stares didn’t linger on the tattoo on his forearm.
Harry settled into the booth as well, and he was looking up at Draco expectantly, but Draco knew his mother would have his ear if she found out he didn't greet Weasley before taking his seat. He took another steadying breath.

Running from his problems was against his nature. He was a Gryffindor at heart, and as Hermione always said, there was a true solution for every situation if you only put your mind to it.

Yup, you read that right. Cooking. I was always pretty good at it when I was forced to do it for the Dursleys, so I figure I’ll give it a go with real recipes. (Plus, I haven’t died yet, and I’ve been cooking for myself since I got here. I suppose I’ve got some potential.)
Seeing his life laid out on the front pages for all to see—whether the media’s interpretations were positive or negative—gave him the shakes and cold sweats. Even more so when something that got reported was actually true. It reminded him all too clearly of sitting in Dumbledore’s dark office, dried tears on his face and bone-weary, as he listened to Trelawney’s disembodied voice foretell his future.
invasive than they already were. Waiting out the talk was probably the best course of action, but the prospect of doing so filled him with dread.
As for potions updates: I’m still a horrid potioneer. Malfoy, on the other hand, is amazing at it (the prat), and he’s since banned me from the potions lab in his penthouse (yes, potions lab! yes, penthouse! He’s such a snob) because I burned through his fancy copper cauldron. So I’m moving on to better things: cooking.

I’ve hired a few people to help me out; we’re only open for dinner, so my small staff is perfect. Frankly, everything about this is perfect.

"Alright," Weasley said mildly, as if this were any other conversation. "What are your intentions with our dear Harry, here?"
Love,
Anyway, we’re kissing now. It’s a thing. Don’t ask me to elaborate, because I’ll roast from the inside out.
Harry
I’m going to visit Place Cachée within the next few days so I can finally see if I’m less noticeable here in France. Don’t lecture me, but I’ve been avoiding the wizarding district because I’m afraid it’ll be more of the same. If this has all been for nothing, I think I’ll actually go mad.
13 November ’98
In other news, I gave up my shoe-box flat and moved in with Draco. Living with him has been a dream—even if he’s beyond annoying about how to put away dishes and the temperature of the bedroom and the way to fold clothes. He also—oh wait, I guess I should say “we” now. That’s strange.
Granger spotted them first, and a toothy grin spread over her face as she jumped from her seat to envelope Harry in a hug. Draco caught Weasley's eyes over the bush of Granger's brown hair, and Draco had no clue what to do with his face. Smiling, he felt, would be disingenuous considering their history.
"Teddy loves it, that's for sure," Harry added, his eyes pinging between Draco and his friends as if he needed a visual of everyone at once.
Draco and I are sitting on our terrace, and he just asked me if I’d like to stay out here and watch the sunset. Sunset is still two hours off, but the only possible answer was yes. I don’t know why I had to take a moment—why I felt so overwhelmed.
Dear Hermione,
Granger tipped her head back and laughed. He didn't think he'd been
“I’m leaving England.”
Harry had thought the vultures at the
“Truly. I’ve seen you struggling, and I’ve tried to think of ways to help, but nothing sounded right. But this…I support you in this, Harry.”
Draco lay on his back, and he was covering his eyes with the crook of his elbow. He was loath to move. The very idea of rousing himself from his prone position — of vacating Harry Potter’s bed — made him break out in a cold sweat. There wasn’t anything particularly special about the bed itself that held Draco captive; the soft grey duvet was covered in multi-colored patches, the sheets were plain cotton, and the pillows were missing about half their feathers.
Draco snorted.
Draco nodded.
Granger scolded. She backhanded him in the stomach, but Weasley grinned and remained completely unconcerned.
Harry
still a force to be reckoned with, and it took him less than a second to clock that she still had the ability to reduce his self-esteem to the murky depths of the Black Lake. "I'm glad you could come out tonight. Ron and I have been pestering Harry for weeks about what's going on between the two of you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"We're dating," Draco confirmed. "And trust me, it was hard for me to accept at first, too. We danced around each other for a couple weeks, and honestly? We were dating a while before we actually admitted that that was what we were doing. All this doubt that you two have? It's why it took us so long to say anything. Most people are going to think we're batshit, and it won't surprise me."
Granger in my fucking drawing room. I won’t be surprised if she can’t even look at me.”
Dear Hermione,
"Guess not," Draco allowed. "And I knew he was a package deal."
Harry pulled back from the hug, but his hand lingered on Granger's back. Draco was unsurprised by Harry's open affection because he was used to Harry's long hugs and steady hands. Draco still didn't know everything about Harry's childhood before Hogwarts, but he knew enough to be completely unsurprised about Harry's feelings concerning touch. Harry leaned into every friendly touch, and he was always ready to offer a pat on the back or to sling an arm around a friend's shoulders.
“Good.” Harry kissed him again, lingering this time and teasing at Draco’s lower lip. It was only when Draco surged forward and attempted to roll Harry onto his back that Harry planted a firm hand on Draco’s chest and pulled back with a satisfied grin. “I also wasn’t lying when I said Hermione would lecture us on punctuality.”
their love languages were 'touch.'
Harry sank into the faded armchair in his living room and looked out the window. It was still early, the sun just cresting the horizon, but the street was already busy. If he stepped out his front door and walked two streets over to a wizarding area of London, he’d be swarmed, and far too many hands would reach out to touch him.
relief, but I don’t have any parchment left. I never knew how much stuff a person has to buy when they move. I have no parchment in my flat at all—I even had to rip my grocery list off the top of this letter. Sorry I’m such a mess.
Dear Hermione,
the same person you were,” Harry said vehemently. “None of us are the same as we were in school — thank Merlin. We can even leave the harder conversations for another night, and tonight can just be a-a-a
“Nothing, I—” Draco broke off. What he’d been about to say would’ve been a lie, and he hated lying to Harry — even small white ones.
"I bet you went apoplectic when Harry told you the truth," Draco replied, trying for levity as she dropped his hand.

You’ll be happy to know my French is not improving. I asked the grocer yesterday where the pasta noodles were, but I
There’s this bakery on Place Cachée that just went up for sale, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to buy it. It’s small, the kitchen is perfect, and it’ll be easy to convert the front room into a little dining space. (Draco has already said he has

“And Pansy might stab me with her high heel if I say something to offend her,” Harry continued. He climbed onto the bed next to Draco, sprawling half on his bare chest and forcibly removing Draco’s arm from his eyes. “Tonight will go perfectly. They’ll take one look at you, and see exactly what I do.”
“Sometimes, I don’t know how
Harry sighed and couldn’t help a small smile. The fact that Hermione knew what was holding him back wasn’t surprising. He liked that she wasn’t afraid to voice anything. It helped when his nerves got the better of him.
Happy Christmas! I hope this reaches you before the holiday, so you can put my presents to you under the tree with the rest. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to my letters taking so long to get to you. I’m used to hearing back from you a day after I write, and I admit the time between correspondences is starting to get to me.
us they were dating! Why on earth would he lie about something like that?"
Don’t spend your winnings all in one place, you know-it-all.
Turns out he’s not returning to England for the holidays either—his mum is visiting Lucius in Azkaban, and Malfoy refuses to see the man—so instead of us both being sad and alone, we’re going to get a proper dinner with all the fixings.

gesture to let Draco pick a familiar establishment, and he might just love Harry for it.
Her eyes widened, but she didn’t hesitate. “Then I’ll come over and help you pack. You go and tell Ron,” she said, suddenly business-like as she rose to her feet and disappeared down the hallway. “Shut the door on your way out, and don’t let Ron talk you out of this! Or let him rile you!
9 February ’99
He glared again at the discarded newspaper.
Harry greeted Weasley over the table with a weird looking handshake, and Granger slid back into the booth. It was a large corner booth, with a big square table, and Granger scooched right back into Weasley's space with the ease of someone comfortable in their relationship. Weasley's pale arm settled around her shoulders as the man continued to stare Draco down.
dating? Teasing and romance — the whole kit and kaboodle?"
“I can’t pack your things by myself.” She pointed a stern finger at him. “And I expect to be invited to farewell drinks.”

was quite pleased when Harry's gaze stopped swinging and settled on Draco.
liked to speculate about
I feel as though ending this letter with an update about my cooking would be underwhelming, so I’ll just say this: Draco told me my eggplant risotto was the best thing he’s ever tasted. That’s saying something, considering he’s as particular about his food as a toddler who says they like carrots one day and splatters them on the walls the next.
"Malfoy," she greeted, shaking his hand. Her grip was firm, her palm calloused, and she stared him down the entire time their hands were connected. She was
“When are you planning on leaving?”
And fine, it smelled like Harry — Draco didn’t mind that bit, though it made him flush to admit it. Every time Draco shifted, a plume of Harry’s sandalwood shampoo and oaky cologne settled around Draco like a welcomed second skin. He supposed, his cheeks pinking, this was
This is all I can write now. Draco’s nagging me from the doorway, saying someone is going to snap the place up if I don’t get off my arse.
"It's not as surprising as you'd think," Granger repeated.
Harry had agreed quickly when Draco suggested this be the place they meet. It was a ridiculously

“You are a fantastic person. You are kind, and generous, and anyone who doesn’t see how you’ve changed are fools. Yeah?”
"Must be a family trait," Harry admitted with a shrug that
"Well, if we're lying, it's nice to see you too, Ferret," Weasley replied, his expression not shifting.

Hermione, I think I’m truly happy for the first time in my life.
Draco froze, and when he looked up from his lap, he'd never been so grateful to see Pansy and Theo in his life.
He reappeared outside the red door to Hermione’s new flat and pounded on it till his fist ached. When it finally swung open, Hermione was in the process of pulling on her lavender dressing robe, still flushed and sweaty from sleep. There were pillow creases on her face, and her hair was still in its silk, protective sleep-wrap. Her eyes were wide and worried as she looked at him.

"No, it's fair, Granger," Draco interrupted.
24 January ’99
The castle’s gates lay in ruins behind them, as did the trail of rubble left over from various blasts. The war had taken its toll on the ancient grounds, but both past and present students came together to do their part. Hermione had taken the lead, organising groups by skill level, year, energy, and taking care to rotate them in and out so that no one over-exerted themselves along the way.
“No, not full. But I don’t want you to treat me like some piece of precious porcelain either.” Though Harry couldn’t see Draco’s expression, based on the sound alone, Harry could surmise there was a bit of a pout. It made the corners of Harry’s lips twitch up in amusement.
“Nah. We’ve made our peace already.”
The first sign of trouble came just at the end of class. Harry had gone the entire time without a single accident. It was incredible, but it helped having Hermione as a partner. That being said, it wasn’t like they were always completely infallible; and despite the numerous precautions Harry took during the brewing process, all it had taken was catching a whiff of Draco’s scent lingering somewhere for just a moment. It could have been the blond headed down the hall back to his dorms, or perhaps the scent simply floated through the classroom from down the hall. Whatever the reason, Harry’s entire body jolted as if pulled towards the scent, which caused him to accidentally bump into the cauldron while Hermione was stirring. Both of them were splattered with the contents.
“Is that right?” Harry growled, nipping at the tender flesh of Draco’s neck. “You’re tempting me to go again just to hear it.”
Before Harry could say another word, he felt the tell-tale swelling at the base of his cock. It bulged to the point that pushing all the way into Draco was becoming difficult. But undeterred—and with a determination that had Harry thinking this was what Draco wanted this whole time—Draco closed his eyes with a grimace, and pulsed his hips until his tightness stretched to accommodate the sudden extra girth. The knot itself was so incredibly sensitive, as if the flesh was wrapped in the same nerves that covered the underside of his cock. So as the tight flesh yielded, Harry could only drag his nails down Draco’s back, and let loose a sound somewhere between a moan and a howl.
“Could you try a bit more subtly there Ron?”
“He’s not getting any better. If anything... He’s getting worse.” Harry sighed, rubbing a hand through his quite messy hair.
Hermione went to speak to Professor McDonald in a hushed voice, and then moved to Potter’s side. A few men from the pub went wordlessly to restrain Howard, and McDonald flicked her wand, releasing the spell.
He grinned at her shrugging, his drink untouched.
“What the fuck?!” he exclaimed loudly.
“I thought everything would be better,” she confessed to her knees, her voice muffled through her fingers. “I thought this year would be so easy, not like every other crazy year we’ve had at this school.”
“Sorry about that.”
“Draco?” called Lovegood’s serene voice from around the curtain, “can I come in?”
“That’s fine, I’m in France anyway.”
“OK?” she asked.
Everything froze.
Blaise paused to snort incredulously.
Potter fidgeted.
“That was kind of her, but I’m sure I can manage,” he replied neutrally.
The upbeat tunes were sort of catchy. Finch-Fletchley’s mouth opened in shock.
“I can never tell if you’re joking or not.”
Luna prodded sadly at her porridge.
“Ummm... mind if I sit down?”
Draco chuckled in agreement as Pansy went back to her lunch. He relaxed slightly, but after a few mouthfuls of soup she said casually, “so what did Padma say?”
A few people shifted awkwardly. Draco, who had already felt on the verge of a panic attack, was too busy concentrating on breathing to decide how to react to this. He knew how he would have responded before the war, but he didn’t think he had the right to defend himself any more. Pansy on the other hand was already bristling. She opened her mouth, but Draco reached out and squeezed her hand to stop her.
He could still hear the crowd in the pub, still see the people gathered around shifting uncomfortably. Potter and Howard were frozen in place, their eyes darting around in shock, the enraged expression stuck on Potter’s face.
“Terribly nice of you to say Malfoy,” Finch-Fletchley was beaming over his bowl of porridge.
“Um... Is it my go next?” said Brown uncertainly.
“I thought we talked about this Terry?” said Potter calmly, looking at the other boy with cool anger behind his eyes, but Pansy suddenly shot to her feet, cutting him off before he could say anything else.
Draco shrugged again.
“I’ve never been here before, obviously,” said Potter conversationally.
“How do you fit into this Mr Malfoy?”
Everyone froze. Even McGonagall, who had clearly been about to intervene. Terry Boot stared at Potter with his mouth open.
“This will be a very busy year at Hogwarts. Not only do we have the largest class of first years in quite some time, but you will have noticed that we have some returning older students who will be making up our eighth year. All of you have a lot of hard work ahead of you to catch up on the education you will have missed because of the disruptions last year, but I have every confidence in each one of you.
He was immediately relieved that he had good reason to forgive Potter for today. He hadn’t really wanted to end things before they had even started.
Justin didn’t say anything more, and after a while Draco heard his breathing relax. He rolled over and looked out of his window, watching the moon rising over the forest.
“Please don’t tell Pansy?” she asked breathlessly. “Please Draco? I’m so embarrassed.”
Potter, unaware of Draco’s sudden mental panic, ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, then wrapped his hand around the back of Draco’s neck. He pulled him down and leaned up to meet him in a kiss, but Draco wrenched his head back. He used his grip on Potter’s arms to push him backwards.
She left, and he stayed lying down quietly, staring up at the ceiling. The calming draught had made him a little drowsy.
Draco blushed deeply.
Draco grinned. He sat back sipping his drink, and realised his hair was still damp from the snow. He could feel the wet ends soaking into the back of his jumper. He checked his wrists and his pockets for a spare hair tie but came up empty. Luna must have noticed because she leaned towards him, sliding off the orange sequin scrunchie she was wearing on her wrist and handing it to him. He pulled his hair up, twisting it and securing a high bun with the scrunchie. A few loose stands of hair fell softly around his face, and he couldn’t be bothered to redo the bun to catch them.
He wrinkled his nose as he looked around. Once he’d established that Potter was indeed gone, and hadn’t fallen off the other side of his bed, he backed out quickly. He shut the door behind him and frowned in thought.
Before he could reply, Blaise was standing before them, his shirt unbuttoned to the waist, holding a shot in each hand. Pansy reached for one, but Blaise downed both shots, one after the other, and grinned down at them cheerfully.
Lovegood looked down as well and hissed in sympathy.
He shrugged.
Of all the injustices in the world.
The Slytherin’s had gathered together by the drinks. He sighed in exasperation, wanting to scurry to Pansy’s side but needing to follow up on a promise first.
So Draco found himself heading to the Great Hall with two Hufflepuffs. It wasn’t even 8am and his mind was already reeling.
Blaise turned the newspaper towards them silently. There, on the front page, was a headline: Sexcapades of the Saviour
“OK but... But... Why the fuck would you pick me?” Draco half shouted, exasperated, “I’m a Death Eater! How will this help your image at all?”
“No I don’t,” countered Draco, trying to sound certain.
“What business is it of yours who I drink with?” he asked indifferently.
The music died to a background hum. Draco wasn’t really sure if he wanted to be involved in Blaise’s game, but it would probably seem more suspicious if he didn’t play.
“Absolutely not!” he exclaimed, “Why would I?”
He did a twirl, his hair bouncing, and froze when he saw Draco. He flushed, but he held his head up and met Draco’s gaze firmly.
Potter rose from his seat and stared them all down.
He went slowly into his own room, looking around to see if he’d maybe missed a note.
“NO! No, sorry, I phrased that badly! I meant there’s a few of us going, as a friend group,” she said in a rush.
She was frowning now.
Draco Malfoy had stared evil in the face. He’d lived with it in his home. He’d spent every waking moment of the last year in perpetual terror. He may be a coward in a general sense, but he wasn’t afraid of Terry fucking Boot.
It was hatred. It was hatred. It was hatred... it was self-hatred.
Things with his mother were tense.
“Is that what this is? I thought you’d invited a crowd to watch your boxing match,” he said flatly.
After a moment he squinted at Draco.
“What kind of fee are you getting for pimping me out Hermione?” He muttered. His words were kept private by the flurry of activity around them, as the other students pulled out their textbooks to begin working on the number grid that had appeared on the blackboard.
“I can wait for you by the door, if you want Hermione?” she asked, glancing back and forth between Draco and Granger uncertainly.
“No! It’s not due until Monday,” he squawked.
The Headmistress gave Potter an odd look, before turning back to Draco, a small smile pulling the corner of her mouth. McDonald looked like she was evaluating him, open interest in her eyes.
“Which one?” Draco asked, grinning down at the wicked glint in her eyes.
She considered him carefully, while he twitched nervously. He didn’t want to keep talking in case he started to go round and round and sound insincere.
Beckett looked down at her, and he smiled a little.
“It was just a kiss,” he said, trying for nonchalance, but his eyes were still too frightened.
“I don’t need to go to the hospital wing. I’m sure I can fix it myself if my head would just stop spinning.”
Draco refused to meet his eyes.
“It’s not that simple,” she argued back.
“Oh, was that too personal? Fuck, I’m sorry,” Draco breathed, panicked and second guessing himself, “It’s just that I don’t really talk about it, and Blaise is so confident about who he is, he almost dares people to have a problem with him, and Pansy is all about striking first and asking questions later...” he was starting to ramble.
Hermione, Luna, and Padma watched them approach. Potter was staring hard at his bottle of butterbeer, as though he could transfigure it into something stronger with the power of frustration alone.
“I’d probably be a Healer,” Draco blurted out, before flushing and wishing he could take it back.
Turpin’s tawny eyes narrowed pensively.
That couldn’t be right. He only had two aunts. His loony ex Aunt Bella, and his Aunt Andromeda, who he had never met.
Draco spoke to him in French, and the man’s smile brightened as he replied. Potter looked between them with his eyebrows raised. Draco had to admit that he was showing off a little, and the small gleam of admiration in Potter’s eyes was worth it. He asked about the specials and made a quick decision on what to order before he overthought it. The waiter nodded happily and took away the menus.
After that, the Ministry had concentrated on Draco’s trial, and when that was thrown out (again thanks to Potter) begrudgingly left him and his mother alone.
Hermione and Pansy shoved their way through the spectators, and rushed to Draco’s side. Pansy immediately started patting him down for injuries, while Hermione assessed the scene. Her demeanour was calm, but the small crease between her eyes betrayed her concern.
“No,” he said more gently, “We’ve never hooked up if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve actually never done that with anyone...”
“What I mean is, this isn’t logic Grang... Hermione. You think there’s an answer for every problem, but this isn’t something you can look up in a book. Potter is processing trauma, we all are, and there’s no one way to do that.”
When he looked up, he saw Potter staring at him from across the table, biting his lip. Draco flushed and forced his gaze away, focusing back on Luna.
Potter grinned and gave a two fingered salute back to the table, before sauntering out of the Hall.
“We haven’t even made it through the first day and already the Potter drama is exhausting.”
“Although,” he muttered, as the students around them started to settle down, “I’ll always accept a favour from the future Minister.”
“Spice up your Life!” Draco yelled back, throwing his arms in the air.
“And they’re OK with it?” he asked Justin, his voice cracking.
If you’re thinking to yourself “That’s 3 Chapters and I was promised a fake relationship” I’m getting there, I promise! There’s just a lot of setting up to do. There’s a party and some drama in the next chapter if that helps? ~Kisses~
Finch-Fletchley gave a small delighted laugh and clapped Draco on the back.
“I’d like you to stay here for a little while, I need to check your chest again in an hour, to see if the burn is deeper than I thought.”
“What flavour of ice cream?...” Lovegood began to ask, before she turned to Draco with wide eyes as though just remembering he was there.
Harry sighed, but Hermione was most likely right. It wasn’t like Draco was willingly talking about his issues, at least not the ones that he could see. They’d talked about a million and a half things, from basics regarding favourite foods, to harder topics such as their respective childhoods.
“Do I get rewarded when I’ve been a
Before Draco could complete the sentence, Harry pinned him against the stone wall. There was a noise not unlike a growling snarl, which Harry realised was coming from him. He grabbed the front of Draco’s uniform with his fists, and despite the aggressive energy radiating off of him, the whole thing felt extremely intimate considering they were practically breathing in each other’s space.
“You’ll find a list of your project assignments along with your individual class schedules on your beds.” Headmistress McGonagall stood in front of the large fireplace, that beautifully adorned the new eighth-year common room. Only a few of them had returned for this attempt at re-doing their missed year, more than expected but still less than worth separating. It made sense to put them all in their own space, given what had happened to them all in the last year, and their relative ages.
