, Malfoy,” Potter snapped back in reply. “Oh but that’s right,
“There’s something I need to tell you. Something I should have done a while ago,” he admitted, swallowing tightly. He couldn’t bring himself to look at his mate; couldn’t bear to see the way those gleaming green eyes would soon surge with anger.
“Apparently,” Harry agreed, turning on his side to stare at the blond Slytherin. Despite the urge to remain with Malfoy in the Slytherin common room, Harry knew it was time to leave. “I should go.”
Harry sniggered. “I was the same,” he admitted. “Although I never once considered that I might like guys—I thought it was normal to feel awkward with a female. I had no one to tell me otherwise.”
“I think I always knew,” Malfoy replied with a shrug. “Of course, I tried to make it work with Pansy but when it got down to it, there was no
Merlin, he was never going to see either one of them again! Staring down at his food again, Draco discovered he was no longer hungry.
Hermione, who had been sitting patiently while Ron came to terms with the news, spoke up.
Pansy giggled at Draco’s teasing. “I’ll miss you as well Drakey-poo!”
Harry flicked his wand and murmured the spell. A little green light blinked into life beside the power button and Harry grinned.
"Well, you need to be careful, if they were after you the whole time they might know where you live." Ackley's face fell. Harry smiled slightly.
He shakes his head. "Well, that's all right. Can you remember where it sits?" He asks, his voice warm.
"No, why?" Draco's look of confusion only deepened when Harry reminded him of what happened, "You were intoxicated." Harry rolled his eyes.
"Are we speaking, yes, I mean, we never really stopped." Draco smiled and Harry cast his attention to the fireplace. They were only a few days into December, yet, they had had three snowstorms; the fire brought a much-needed warmth to the large room.
"The last time I sang was a few months ago, my mum used to like when I sang her bedtime songs, so that's something I find solace in, singing the bedtime songs." Harry smiled at the young lad, he was so young, yet so troubled.
He was wearing his Slytherin jumper over a teeshirt that said something about Quidditch and dark coloured jeans, he was handsome like his father, but in a more 'I don't care', casual way. Draco looked up and his brow creased in worry.
Harry sat across from him and leaned on the table. "Fine, I'm better now that I'm seeing the kids more often." Harry took a sip of his tea and Draco smiled warmly at him.
"Have you taken time to see Hermione and Ron? They've been asking after you?" Harry shook his head and flipped over, signalling to Draco that their conversation was over.
They were quiet for a few moments, "When did we get married?" Draco opened a drawer and began digging through it, finally pulling out a long wooden spoon.
"You look tired," Draco remarked, not looking away from Harry's uniform.
"I mean, we should have broken up long before then, perhaps not even have gotten married. But we strung it on." Harry looked around the wallpapered walls. Hanging behind an old battered wooden desk was each of Draco's diplomas.
"That's one of our family game nights," Hermione remarked.
"I guess not." Percy hummed.
Draco was sitting in a chair, looking displeased. His father was standing beside him. He looked terrible. Looking over, the man in this picture was nothing like the man in the memory with Sirius. This man was dirty and crumpled.
"Why do you think that?" Draco took another sip of his, now, luke-warm tea. Harry considered his question for a while.
And so far, it had worked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione must have talked to Draco sometime during the night because the next day, Draco comes into Harry's hospital room carrying pictures.
want it to be?”
“Thank you, Mione,” he whispered, “for being here with me.”
The young man bounded away from a grin, leaving Harry to three impudent smirks.
,” Harry mocked.
A cheeky glint lit up Harry’s eyes. “For an hour or so.”
The walk through the dark, eerily silent castle was enough to cause the terror within Draco to grow tenfold. He followed Potter obediently, eyes tracking over the debris that scattered along the corridors. The once, Draco assumed, glorious pictures that lines the walls throughout the castle were now scratched and filthy, many of the occupants running submissively from their frames as the dark-haired male passed them by.
“She was going to wait until you woke up,” Hermione explained. “She wanted to ask you a few questions before she gave you anything.” She looked over his face, noticing how fresh and healthy he appeared. “Is your headache gone?”
“There, that doesn’t sound too bad does it?” Draco commented. “I wonder if I’d be able to get Potter to tell me the mystery man’s name.”
Harry rubbed his arm. “It’s just… what with you and Parkinson becoming tentative friends and all… I was wondering if you knew what was up with Malfoy?”
“Fine.” Grey eyes dropped to the undone buttons on Harry’s robes. “Then allow me to finish what you started.” He tugged the black fabric from Harry’s shoulders and the Gryffindor felt the material pool around his legs. His gaze, however, was locked directly on Malfoy’s, who was staring at him with unhidden desire.
The room was circular, tattered remnants of beds and bedside tables strewn across the ragged carpet. It appeared to be a shared dormitory, one that had obviously once homed a few students… and most likely still homed one. Looking about, Draco’s gaze fell on a haphazardly built window. It stretched around half of the tower wall, revealing through the glass a large, what looked to Draco, uneven balcony. The construction was disproportionate, the materials used mismatched. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if it had been built by Potter himself. Just as the curiosity to approach the balcony took over, something caught his eye.
A quick side-along apparition later found Harry and Eli in the shadows of an alleyway a few doors down from the bar. Despite the unknown aspects surrounding his newfound date, Harry was glad to be out of the club. As much fun as it had been back in the day when he hadn’t cared much, he couldn’t help but feel detached from the thrumming atmosphere he had, once upon a time, thrust himself into.
“Where have you been?” Pansy frowned, finally catching up with her best friend outside the History of Magic classroom.
A sigh seeped out of Draco, shaking his head bitterly as he looked up at the ceiling.
“A little better,” Harry replied with a croak. “Thanks, Mione.” He offered a small smile, handing her back the bottle. Still a little concerned with the dark circles beneath his eyes, Hermione placed the water aside and told him to lie back down.
True to his mother’s word, a summons for Draco came at precisely five o’clock that evening. He was startled from his thoughts—
“As long as there is no racing involved,” Draco replied.
Draco sighed but shook his head. “No, I’m really not in the right mind set to deal with Gryffindorks, let alone Potter.”
“Well, if the Ministry is creating wizarding websites I’m sure they’ll make a Chudley Cannons one as well…”
“Playing a little joke,” the one who had sent Draco up said proudly.
“God,
better, as the day wore on Draco found himself regretting ever leaving his room.
“Love means a different thing to different people.” Harry stared down at his hands. “But I’m not going to find out unless I give him a chance now, am I?” He smiled wryly at the male sitting beside him.
“Not even to produce an heir?”
“Wait,” Pansy interrupted.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said gently, “Mione can handle herself.” He eyed the red-head curiously. “Why haven’t you told Mione yet?”
… Harry thought, hoping that there would in fact
“You’re both insane,” Harry declared.
“Somebody’s smitten,” she smiled, replacing Harry’s art book and hiding all evidence that she’d been near it. She was curling up in her seat with a book when Harry returned, suspecting nothing as he retook his place, pencil in hand.
Draco was sure he made a noise in surprise, but when the epitome of his desire was kissing
“You’re damned lucky Granger is as caring as she is,” Pansy commented.
Draco’s breath stilled in his lungs. All he could do was gape at the dark-haired male, thoughts and questions a whirlwind in his mind. He didn’t dare to hope as to what Harry’s answer could be but
“Hmm. What a shame you ended up with me.”
Harry laughed outright. “Yeah, mate, a computer-thingy.”
“Sounds bloody brilliant.” The dark-haired Gryffindor flashed Ron a grin. “Thank god for Mione.”
“Are we… actually going to get
Harry froze in mid step, huffing aloud as he faced the bushy haired female. “… I’m… going for a walk,” he replied.
Potter laughed. “Has that ever worked?”
“Your turn, Potter,” he said darkly, voice husky.
on my essay!”
“Just because we’re not all computer savvy,” Ron sniffed.
pride.”
Harry led the young male through Hogwarts silently, his hand gripping Ron tightly. The candelabra switched his gaze from the brunet to the blond trailing behind, a plan forming in his mind.
Ron’s heart thumped. Glancing around, he slid beside a nearby suit of armour and remained silent.
Another awkward silence fell. Draco distracted himself with petting the cushion in his lap, unsure of what else to say. He couldn’t help but wonder why Potter was even down here.

” Pansy hissed. “Draco, what the
“Blasted irresponsible man.” Pomfrey huffed and folded her arms with a frown. “You could have been blinded!” Lowering her voice, Madam Pomfrey turned her sharp gaze to Harry. “I want to keep you here until at least dinner, Mr Potter, for observation of course.”
A slow, voracious smile began to spread across the vampire’s face, eyes glowing as he gazed at his mate.
“Yes, but, Ronald…”
With a final squeeze of his shoulder, Madam Pomfrey dropped her hand and turned away, heading back to her office. Draco watched her go, disbelief on his face while his fingers curled into the blankets on Harry’s bed, needing something,
Draco glanced at his laptop. He always hated not going on and neglecting his blog—he constantly felt as if he was missing out on something.
Harry was practically purring in agreement when he suddenly jolted. “I—wait, what? Date? Weasley?”
“Well, yeah,” Harry replied, frowning at his friend pointedly. “Duh.”
Ron chuckled. “You’re not wrong.” He reached across the table to fill his plate with eggs and sausages. “So… any further development on the Malfoy-front?”
“What a shame you don’t have much of a life to be distracted from,” Draco murmured softly, hoisting his bag strap over his shoulder. “May I remind you that you have class in five minutes?”
The teacup positively beamed and she bounced happily around Draco’s plate. His smile grew as he watched her for a moment, until the door to the classroom-turned-dining swung open, Potter stalking inside.
a next time. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and slid on his jeans, eyes already scanning for his shirt.
“If only,” Harry replied with a wry laugh. “Can you believe the git actually wants us to start being friends?”
Fumbling for Potter’s wrists, Draco grabbed them tightly in each hand and pinned them above the brunet’s head. Potter’s eyes flashed and he smirked.
“I am not a
“But I do!”
“I—” Harry’s face suddenly fell, his arms folding defensively as he seemed to shrink in on himself. “I had hoped that the more time I spent with you… pretending everything was alright… that I would begin to believe it.”
Pansy stood smirking by his side.
Another stiff nod.
“Do you want to go to Madam Pomfrey?” she said. “She can help.”
,” he added in a growl.
Stepping back under the spray, Harry washed himself clean once more, feeling a little more than repulsed with himself for being so crude.
Malfoy shrugged, settling himself back against the couch as Harry got to his feet, straightening his dishevelled shirt. “Not particularly.”
Potter became undone, coming hard with a cry that sounded very much like Draco’s name. The blond was too far gone to realise this however, as Potter suddenly clenched firmly around him and Draco was brought to completion.
Draco felt his body go still.
“Do you know what it was Mr Malfoy put in your cauldron, Mr Potter?” Pomfrey asked.
The unmistaken scrape of a shoe on stone caused Harry to pause. His gaze shot up and down the corridor, brow furrowed with confusion. There was no one in sight, despite how close the sound had been. He
“I’m thirsty.”
“Yeah Hermione as well,” Potter replied, his gaze falling on the fire as it crackled away merrily. “You know she likes you, yeah?”
The blond did as she said, eyes following the teapot’s movement as she busied herself with pouring some hot liquid into an impatiently waiting teacup who would not take its eyes off him.
“You did just say man, right?” Ron asked after a moment.
“Alright, I get it,” Draco interrupted impatiently. He sighed heavily, running a hand over his hair. “I know,” he continued, slightly calmer. “But I just… there’s no reason to rock the hippogriff now, right? I’m no longer using it against him.”
Gingerly, the blond got to his feet. He ignored the way his limbs shook as he bowed deeply, hating the way he could still feel his lord’s punishment. Backing away respectfully, Lucius retreated to the closed doors, his fingers brushing against the cool metal of the handle. Before he could free himself from the penetrating gaze of the Dark Lord, however, the male spoke.
Moving his gaze away, Harry studied the landscape for some inspiration for his next drawing. His eyes drifted over smiling students and gently swaying trees until an unfamiliar laugh had him searching across the field.
After all, he and Malfoy had been at complete odds until this evening and seeing others getting over their differences to enjoy themselves made Harry feel strangely warm.
?” he spluttered.
Harry thought wildly.
Harry was sitting at the Gryffindor table, head resting in his palm and chewing thoughtfully on a piece of toast as he stared across the hall. Malfoy was speaking with Zabini, occasionally smiling and chuckling at whatever the other male had to say.
“Huh,” Ron murmured. “So what is a username exactly?”
“Severus informs me that there was… a complication in class.”
the cracker exploded into a cloud of gold smoke, a small game of wizard’s chess and a silver crown falling onto the table.
“Tell me about it,” Pansy muttered. “You and Draco should date, Potter, you share some major qualities.”
Ron’s eyes were wide as he stared at the brick wall. Realising suddenly that he was holding his breath, Ron steadily released it, not wanting to give away his hiding place.
“My, my, Potter…”
Pansy smiled and patted him consolingly. “Don’t worry; if Potter breaks your heart, he’s as good as dead.”
“Aside from that,” the blond continued, “who you are, what you do, and who you like is your own business. People aren’t always going to agree but who cares? That’s not your problem. No matter what we wish, there will always be someone who disagrees with you. And that’s alright, because at the end of the day, whatever is making you happy is obviously doing the trick. Why give that up for someone with the bigoted opinion of a troll?”
“How on earth did you manage
Harry released a gentle sigh. “I’m tired of pretending,” he admitted, lifting a hand to rub the back of his neck. And good god he really was. He was tired of the way he hid his true desires, tired of how he ignored the way he felt it in his stomach every time Draco smiled. His body knew what it wanted… and what it wanted was Draco.
“Yes,” Harry murmured, feeling suddenly breathless. “But, I didn’t—”
Gradually, more students trudged to class. The class number was only small as only a few students had elected to continue Ancient Runes for their NEWTs. This made it painfully obvious that when the door finally opened ready to admit them, Malfoy still hadn’t arrived.
…or what Draco even was.
you’re reacting like this to Potter?”
“You’ve had four,” Malfoy suddenly said.
it, Draco. It’s more than that now—it’s about trust. If Harry somehow finds out about this before you tell him, what is he supposed to think?”
Harry hesitated.
“Pouting at your breakfast isn’t going to make the situation any better,” Pansy insisted with a faint sneer. “Seriously, Draco, it’s just a stupid village.”
“A little jumpy this morning aren’t we, mate?” he smirked, reaching for his own glass.

Malfoy’s head shot up, grey eyes so dark with longing they were almost black.
Malfoy made an amused sound. “Good thing you
“You—you do?” Harry said with surprise.

For an easy fuck, there was no one better. Harry knew this. And it was painfully obvious that Eli did too. But that was not what this evening was supposed to be about. Harry didn’t
Harry chuckled but shook his head. “No, it’s not homework—I’ve already finished the essay that’s due tomorrow.”
“This is coming from the same bloke who danced around his fiancée for
The reminder that Lucius’s presence was still expected by the Dark Lord was suddenly heavy in the air. Narcissa dabbed delicately at her eyes with a lace-edged handkerchief as she nodded.
It was Theodore Nott, and he’d jerked away from the brunet as if burned.
Draco frowned faintly. “I haven’t really given it much thought… my lord.”
“He seemed pretty concerned about it,” Harry muttered bitterly.
“Alright I get it,” Pansy said, holding up a hand. “Well that’s good isn’t it? You’ve bagged the Boy-Who-Lived.”
Draco frowned. “What do you mean?”
Draco coughed. “Of course not,” he replied, slightly outraged. “Do you think I’d be as cocky and I am with a tiny appendage?”
“No doubt,” Draco agreed, sighing loudly. “Thus humiliating him is the only option.”
, sleep in on Tuesdays and Thursdays,” Ron said excitedly. “How about you, mate?”
Draco chuckled. “Only the ones that I have a particular interest in,” he replied.
“It’s perfect,” he murmured in reply. “I love it. Thank you.”
Harry was slightly surprised by the lack of nasty comments. Instead, Malfoy got to his feet, his fingers beginning to unbutton his shirt as he headed towards his bed.
Draco’s agreement was lost in a moan as he felt Potter tighten rhythmically around him. He knew he wasn’t going to last much longer and, without thinking, he wrapped a hand around Potter’s erection, pumping it in time with each thrust.
you are,” Harry abruptly snarled, eyes flashing. “God, for a moment there, I thought you might actually be able to be a decent human being—”
“Please let me explain myself,” Draco persisted. “I never meant for that to happen—”
“Good lord, I get enough from Pansy let alone my own goddamn mind,” he growled, scrolling down his dashboard. As his eyes scanned over delicious pictures of different men, Draco began to wonder if Potter had uploaded any more drawings he’d done.

to him and everything—
“That top secret, hmm? Why can’t you tell me now? There’s no one around, come on, Draco, I’d do the same for—”
?” Harry gaped at his best friend who cringed beneath his stare.
“It’s been two weeks of us ducking down corridors and walking with the map out just so you won’t run into the git,” Ron pointed out. “Do you really think you can keep this up for the rest of the school year?”
“Some of them... could you help me?”
Pansy smiled as she examined her nails. “And before you ask, no, I’m not gay—I am very much into men.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Gryffindors,” he muttered. “Page 287 is a good place to start.”
Draco’s heart thumped painfully. “Good, I hope he does.”
Finished, Madam Pomfrey placed aside the empty vials of Blood Replenishing potion and pointed her wand at Harry, whose skin was beginning to regain some colour. Above his chest, glowing gold numbers and symbols appeared and the matron scanned them carefully, taking note of Harry’s vitals with a shrewd eye. She made several gestures with her wand, multiple charms and healing spells falling over the Harry’s form with gentle ease. Satisfied, the matron released a calming sigh, her astute gaze flicking to the blond standing so cautiously beside the bed.
“Fine!” Harry seethed. “Then go ahead and
A little while later, Pansy was beginning to get the hang of her laptop, typing silly emails to Draco who read them with a roll of his eyes.
“… and they are alright with it?”
“I do,” he murmured. “For a while now.”
“Should we go check on him?” Hermione said in concern, glancing up and down the corridor. “I don’t think he’s left his room since yesterday afternoon.”
chemistry with Eli in the first place. But
the smirk the blond was no doubt harbouring as he released the grip he had on Harry’s wrists.
“Yeah.” Ron rolled his eyes exasperatedly. “If you’re going to be staying here with us we should probably know your name don’t you think?”
Ron grinned. “I think I’ll leave it for now—maybe they’ll make a wizard social site.”
,” Harry gasped.
Pansy’s heart began to calm, her breath returning as the initial shock of what Draco had said diminished.
, Potter, not the walking undead. Seriously, what on earth do those muggles teach you?”
“So,” Hermione began, grinned over at Harry excitedly. “Fill us in about
“Mr Malfoy, there you are.”
OKAY so I know I promised that this was the last chapter... but I TOTALLY underestimated how much I was actually going to write. Instead, I have split the chapter into two, as it is about to go over 10k and really, it felt right to end the chapter here.
“On both our counts,” Harry interjected, leaning absently into the blond’s touch. “I wanted things to be back to normal just as much as you did.”
Once sated, Malfoy’s limbs flopped lifelessly onto the bed, chest heaving raggedly. His eyes were closed, hair tousled and cheeks flushed. Harry watched the blond with hungry eyes, mouth practically watering at the sight of Malfoy spread so openly before him.
Satisfied with the documents he now held, Draco shrunk the bundle, bound them together and stuck them in his pocket. Potter may have a great taste in men but it’s not enough to actually want to like the bastard...
“Why did you wait until now to tell them?” Malfoy asked with a frown.
It was the first evening back at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all seated at the Gryffindor table as seventh years. With the sorting having been completed, the three of them, boys especially, were waiting impatiently for the feast to begin.
“Mate?”
pierced the air, quickly followed by a familiar snarl.
“Well…” Ron began uneasily, glancing at Hermione who was suddenly looking extremely smug. “You
git.”
Harry’s face paled several shades. “W-What?” he whispered.
“I’m sorry?”
“About what?”
“Promise or no promise, I can’t stay here a moment longer!” Draco panted in reply, running full pelt towards the front doors. As if sensing his approach, the doors creaked open, allowing the blond to flee the castle without hindrance. He stumbled down the stairs and onto the snow covered lawn, heart pounding in his throat.
Even thinking of the previous evening made Harry’s stomach flutter; made his skin tingle. His eagerness to see the Slytherin was overpowering but he’d managed to restrain himself thus far, knowing he’d most likely frighten Malfoy away with his Gryffindorish nature.
“Oh yes we are
“Yes,” Draco said. “If we’re serious about this new friendship then trust needs to be made.”
“Oh yes most definitely.” Harry laughed, eyes brightening. “I guess that goes without saying.”
“I’ll have to catch up to you,” he grumbled, throwing a dark look over his shoulder at McGonagall.
A thin piece of wood was quickly levelled between his eyes and Draco’s instincts abruptly flared, a snarl curling at his lips at the unanticipated threat. He glared threateningly at the female who, despite the fear she felt bubbling in her stomach, held his gaze.
Harry pulled a face. “Quidditch practice.”
Harry’s mind instantly quietened, body going entirely limp as Malfoy lifted his now sleeping mate into his arms. Draco gazed down at him in complete adoration. He had never felt closer to another male in his life. Shifting Harry in his arms, Draco held him closely, tenderly. Leaning down he pressed a lingering kiss to Harry’s warm forehead. At that moment, his and the brunet’s heart pumped as one. He could feel every breath Harry drew, every emotion that Harry felt.
“... No I’m not.”
,” Harry replied casually. “I’m not joking, Mione, I promise.”
Percy cleared his throat. “Please.”
knew what kissing was.”
“Muggle or wizard?”
“You heard me,” Hermione continued reasonably, gesturing across the table towards him.
“Because I feel like it,” Pansy replied bluntly. “I’ll focus better if I’m happy.” Harry snorted a laugh, earning a dark look from the female. “Shush, Potter,” she sniffed. “You’re almost as bad as Draco.”
“I’m just fooling myself,” he growled. “He’ll never see me as anything… but a monster…” He squeezed his eyes shut, the familiar prickle of despondent tears burning behind his eyelids. Inside the crystal case, another piece of flaking wood fell from the wand.
Potter smiled charmingly. “You know I don’t mean it, Pansy.”
Draco laughed softly. “Just you wait, Potter, it gets much better than this.” As if proving a point, Draco pulled back a little, swallowing a moan as he slid back in, but satisfied when Potter shivered enticingly beneath him. He repeated this motion, drawing further and further out each time. He thoroughly enjoyed the way Potter’s breath hitched each time he thrust inwards and it wasn’t long before Draco was moving powerfully, sweat glistening on his skin from exertion while Potter whimpered and gasped beneath him.
Harry exhaled. “Because I asked them to,” he admitted. The wine had loosened his tongue enough that he did not feel embarrassed about confessing. “I was getting sick and tired of the constant stream of bedwarmers. Anonymous sex is all well and good but it’s not something I wish to continue.”
Draco supposed he should be somewhat wary of what Potter seemed to have in store for him… but it was hard not to be infected with the other male’s excitement. Ever since their walk had come to an end, Potter had been positively buzzing, his eyes alight with pleasure and exhilaration. Unsure as to what had made the Boy-Who-Lived so worked up, Draco hadn’t argued when Potter announced he had something to show him. Until, that was, Potter requested he close his eyes.
“According to the instructions that’s exactly what’s meant to happen,” he said happily.
In spite of his ever growing negative thoughts, Draco soon found himself out of bed and searching for comfortable clothes to wear beneath his school robes. He refused to look at his reflection, preferring the oblivious approach to how he imagined he appeared.
“Oh, really?” Hermione looked pleasantly surprised. “Is this actually happening or are you still sulking?”
“Yes,” Harry replied. “Malfoy added something to my cauldron and it exploded.”
“Peaches.”
The blond rolled his silver eyes. “I believe I was just about to thank Granger for her help.” Draco inclined his head to the Gryffindor. “Thank you, really. I appreciate your help and your finesse during this… situation.”
“I can’t believe you made me wait for an
“Damn, that’s true.”
The blond chuckled again, his tongue trailing languidly along Harry’s collarbone. While he marked the boy beneath him with his teeth, his hand glided with purpose down the brunet’s torso, stopping only when he reached his goal. Beneath him, Harry keened as the blond gripped his hard cock through his trousers, rubbing the throbbing erection with a seductive chuckle.
Harry nodded.
Memories flashed through Harry’s mind and a sultry smile curled at his lips.
“Spread your legs for me,” Draco said, watching as the brunet complied immediately. After a second thought, Draco reached past Potter for a pillow, ordering the Gryffindor to lift his hips. “Elevation,” he explained at Potter’s perplexed facial expression as he slid the pillow beneath him. “It’ll be more comfortable for you.”
“I feel rather certain about it.”
The female sitting beside him smiled with satisfaction. “Someone has to remind you who you are,” she replied. “Aren’t you lucky that I’m so considerate and kind?”
“So?” the other Gryffindor scoffed. “Why do you even care?”
. How about that?
“It’s not so much the fact that you hid Malfoy’s secret,” Ron continued blandly, “Harry and I can understand loyalty—such as it is. The issue here, Hermione, is that you’ve been trying to push Malfoy and Harry together knowing full well that Harry had no idea what Malfoy was. If this stupid bond was so important to the two of you, you would have made the effort to explain the situation, not hide behind lies and hope that everything would work out.” He frowned at Hermione, disappointment swirling within him. “How could you do this to your best friend, Hermione? This is Harry’s
“I—I—” Lucius stammered. Fear like nothing he’d experienced was growing inside him—not even the Dark Lord instilled terror to this extreme.
Draco nodded miserably, hand groping for his bag as he got to his feet.
“What’s Facebook?” Ron frowned.
Draco snorted and shook his head.
Something soft brushed against Harry’s mouth. For a moment, his sleep-addled brain was unable to recognise what it was exactly, until he felt it again, pressing more firmly. His lips curled into a smile as they parted, accepting the gently probing tongue with an exuberant, drowsy sigh.
Potter chuckled. “I look forward to it.”
The Dark Lord’s muddy-red eyes seem to bore into the blond beauty; it took every ounce of will power Draco had not to flinch from the male’s stare. As the surge of anxiety reared to a shuddering peak, a nasty suspicion began to trickle into Draco’s subconscious.
Malfoy’s hands were just as busy. One was curled delicately on the side of Harry’s neck, his fingers stroking the brunet’s nape while his thumb caressed the strong curvature of Harry’s jawline. The other was busy pulling the Gryffindor as flush against him as he could, wanting—no,
there was nothing better than drinking from his mate. With a final tender kiss, the blond lifted his head, cock twitching appreciatively at the sight of his mate looking so debauched.
to?” Ron asked with a frown.
Draco groaned deep in his throat, entire body trembling. He could feel the bond materialising between them, a connection so strong it rocked his very core. The emotions he could feel from Harry intensified and he gasped aloud, swarmed with a feeling of such serenity and acceptance it made his heart ache.
The damn Slytherin always managed to ignite something with the brunet that Harry had been unable to explain. And the most frustrating part was the fact that Harry really
“I don’t need his thanks,” Draco sniped. “I wasn’t trying to help in the first place.” He glowered at the desk, keeping his arms folded. “Merlin if my father ever found out…” He huffed. “Never mind, are we studying or not?”
“No need to be
“Cheer up, love,” Hermione continued gently. “It’ll turn out all right in the end, you’ll see.” She glanced across the room, eyes landing on the tall grandfather clock. “Oh! Look at me, jabbering on when it’s time for dinner preparations! Come along, Gin.”
Ron groaned, folding his timetable and shoving it into the pocket of his robe. “This year is going to be
a silky voice murmured in his mind.
“And yet you came anyway,” the blond continued.

“Although I do enjoy being stared at lustfully, you
Draco forced his throat to unstick as he stared at the garment. “That’s—that’s very kind of you but I’m not going to dinner,” he stated.
“Damage? It’s the best goddamn healing potion in the world!” Ron exclaimed. “What a shame it was Malfoy’s fault.”
“Look at what just walked in!”
“Alright, keep a tight leash on Draco, got it.” Shaking her head, Pansy allowed her gaze to become shrewd as she stared at the bushy-haired female once more. “I can comprehend that you are not overly surprised by this development… but really, Granger, you can’t tell me you were
“Even better,” the blond chuckled, wriggling his hips teasingly. Harry’s eyes rolled back. “Don’t worry, Potter, I don’t believe in fucking on the first date.”
“No.” Draco frowned. “Should I?”
“Ron.” Potter suddenly cut the other Gryffindor off, much to Draco’s surprise.
but... no, it was better to just ignore that and bury it deeply.
“Calmly,” Percy murmured carefully.
“It can be a scary time,” Ron nodded his understanding. “Lucky for you though it’s widely accepted in the Wizarding community.”
“Don’t you worry, Draco dear!” George proclaimed. “Fred and I will show you to the old prefects’ bathroom while our Harry here goes upstairs to refresh.”
“I suppose I may be swayed to join you for dinner, Potter, seeing as you asked
Slowly, Potter’s face relaxed as understanding dawned over him.
Malfoy stared at Harry incredulously. “Get your homework, Potter.”
at me whenever we’re within close proximity?”
“Not me.” Harry snickered, taking back his essay and shoving it into his bag. “I wonder how many blood vessels burst in Snape’s temple before he allowed himself to give me such a good mark.”
Ron was suddenly staring at his best mate uneasily, his mouth slightly agape.
“Sure, Lindy,” he said, taking the other end of her cracker.
Nestled inside was a familiar pile of parchment. Within the pile was every scrap of ‘evidence’ Draco had accumulated over the past few months to use against Potter. He’d almost forgotten about it.
Frowning, Harry looked at the dark haired female curiously.
“You mean aside from the sunlight aversion?” Malfoy commented, quirking an eyebrow.
“This was your plan all along wasn’t it?” Harry snickered.
“Well most laptops are used to create and store information in programs,” Dean replied. “They can be used for specific and intricate tasks depending on what you want.”
“Er… yes?” Harry replied.
as a loud crack echoed around the room. With a sigh, Draco place aside the novel he had been reading and turned his attention to the house elf that stood waiting obediently, large bulbous eyes staring imploringly.
to dissuade Malfoy’s words.
“They’ve found me!”
“But I’m not sleepy,” Ginny yawned, hopping up onto the shelf.
Harry. If Draco had been
Hermione smiled. “Really.”
“Oh?”
Draco was silent as he stared at the screen. The blinking cursor line winked back at him teasingly.
“If it involves bondage, Harry, I don’t think you’re ready for that just yet.”
“Yeah, alright,” he said finally, offering a small smile. He felt a little better about the situation with the prospect of going to the Black Stump, it didn’t seem as daunting if they went to place he was happy and familiar with.
.” Hermione smiled with a shake of her head and turned to look at Harry once more. “By offering himself to you, body and soul, Draco is choosing you and
“How the fuck would you know?” Draco sniped. “Rather, how would
Draco stared at them dejectedly, misery welling up inside of him as the gravity of his situation finally hit him. “But I’ve lost my family, my dreams… everything,” he replied morosely.
Hermione glanced around the common room. “Not here, somewhere else.”
Draco took his time in preparing Potter, knowing full well how much difference it made when done correctly. He was gentle and patient, something that surprised him greatly. In the past, the act had been hurried and rushed; an act of complete lust with whoever it was he was with at the time. It felt different with Potter though, and Draco was unable to express why this was.
For a moment there was nothing but the sound of his breathing as Draco scrutinised the dark form. Then, will painstakingly purposeful movement, the figure stepped into the moonlight. Draco’s gaze was drawn immediately to the face of the young man—but he was like no young man Draco had ever seen before.
Hermione’s frown became more pronounced but she allowed him to leave. Whatever was on the brunet’s mind was obviously bothering him and it was true that Harry preferred to walk it off. There was, however, something different with Harry’s body language that seemed strange to her; not to mention the fact that Harry was a dreadful liar in which Hermione could see through him easily.
Malfoy’s gaze fell away from hers. “Thank you,” he murmured quietly. He pulled out his wand and tapped each of the textbooks once more, shrinking them before placing them inside his bag.
“No! No, I—I meant no harm!” Lucius panicked, turning for an escape.
,” the blond suddenly snarled. “It’s driving me insane.”
“Oh, my life is boring,” Eli remarked. He had yet to even look down at his drink let alone take a sip. He insisted on holding it tightly within his palms. “Not like yours I bet.”
as one another let alone have him tutor me.”
The gentle snores of the candelabra broke as Ron gave a snort. He opened his eyes blearily, catching sight of a familiar blond stepping cautiously down the corridor, disappearing up the stone steps. Ron gaped.
“Apparently,” Draco replied, smirking at the annoyed Slytherin.
“He’s here!” Ron said eagerly.
Abruptly, a
“You can’t do anything about this, Draco,” she whispered fervently. “So why sulk?”
Harry snorted at the thought, shaking his head. Yeah, the looks of pure loathing Malfoy threw at him in the past obviously demonstrated his undying love for him. Right.
” Another sharp intake of breath. “
Draco stared at her sardonically. “Pansy, what about this situation could
“Yeah I’m surprised,” Harry smiled. “I can’t believe I already have over a three hundred notes.”
A small, crystal vial flew into Draco’s outstretched hand and Potter looked at it, tilting his head to the side.
“Oh please, Granger,” Pansy sniffed. “Merely a hint or two was all that I needed; don’t go comparing me to the Golden Boy.”
The vampire had been so desperate, so
“Get your homework. Loathe that I am to admit it but you are far more capable at Potions than you let on to be and I refuse to associate with anyone who rejects their mental capabilities.”
“Fuck… me…” Harry panted, chest heaving.
“I was chatting with Granger the other day,” Pansy began. “She seems keen to get the two of you together.”
“Yeah I’d like to finish this so I can wave it in Draco’s face…”
It was a short walk from their common room to their classroom. The door was open and students were already inside by the time the two Slytherins arrived. Pansy stepped through the doorway first, gaze falling immediately on the familiar group of Gryffindors.
“No! I do but—”
The bushy-brunette’s cheeks reddened. She lifted her stare warily, glancing between the two of them. “I admitted that I’d known about this since the beginning. Harry was… less than pleased that I’d hidden everything from him. I can’t really blame him, honestly. It’s not as if we gave him much choice in the matter.”
“Draco! What on earth are you doing here?” Lucius gasped, reaching through the bars to touch his son. “How did you find me?”
“Feel free to email it to me if you change your mind,” the blond said instead.
“I don’t want to be sick.”
“That’s what warming charms are for.” Pansy rolled her eyes.
Draco just yawned tiredly in reply.
Looking up, Harry’s eyebrows rose at the sight of Draco Malfoy standing beside the Gryffindor table. The blond pointedly ignored the suspicious and annoyed looks he was receiving and simply gazed at Harry, grey eyes unusually soft. Harry found himself nodding jerkily, squashing down the sudden flare of heat that ignited within him.
“But you’re
his son. Any possible chance they had had of looking for him had ended in no sign, not even a whisper of his presence.
“Let’s head back to my common room, I’m the only Slytherin who stayed these holidays.”
“Yes, I can!”
“Well good then,” Hermione finished brightly, reaching for some toast. “Hopefully means less drama for our final year.”
The brunet halted, turning to stare at the Slytherin in surprise at the tone of desperation in Draco’s voice.
Hermione brushed aside his jibe and instead decided to change the subject. “Your drawings are very popular.”
Shifting uneasily on the bed, the brunet bit his lip. “He said Parkinson had been his donor. But he—he also said he can’t drink from her anymore.”
“I don’t know,” Hermione replied, just as softly. “I hope not.” She followed Ron back down the stairs, a niggling sense of concern refusing to go away.
Ron marched down the corridor towards the dungeons. He knew he wouldn’t be able to get inside the Slytherin common without the password, but he was more than happy to bang on the bricks until someone answered him. He was about to turn the corner of the hallway when Ron suddenly stopped, hearing Parkinson’s voice. From the tone, easily recognised from the many time she’d used it on him, Ron could tell that whoever she was berating was getting a severe tongue-lashing.
“Shame you don’t have his—oh! I’m such an idiot,” Hermione said, smacking herself on her forehead. “I have his email if you want it, Harry.”
“In any case, it appears you two have something to discuss.” Pansy got to her feet, smoothing down her robes. “I’ll be here if you need some advice but it will ultimately be up to you and him to fix.”
The corridor was dark. The torches up here, unlike the ones below, did not flare into life when Draco passed them by. Instead, the shadows seemed to grow, casting darkness over a particular wall at the very end of the hallway. The closer Draco approached, the clearer he was able to make out a large gaping hole, ragged bits of grimy golden frame dangling around the edges.
“And if that means that my friends won’t accept you or your parents will hate me I don’t care. I love you and I want to be with you,”
The brunette frowned. “What about him?” Shock suddenly passed over her features. “Does he know?” she gasped.
“It’s alright,” the blond said calmly. “My mind is a tad overactive tonight.”
The blond shook his head. “Whatever curse affected Hogwarts evidently interferes with house elf magic. Do not worry, Mother, I will go. I will find him.”
With a heightened sense of awareness that felt new to him, Draco was as gentle as he could be as eased himself inside the male below, paying particular attention to the worry that he might be hurting the Gryffindor. Both males exhaled a moan once Draco was seated at the hilt, his erection buried so deeply within Harry that when the brunet suddenly tensed his muscles, Draco felt it

After all, out of all the blogs on Tumblr, the chance of someone from Hogwarts stumbling across his blog and even managing to connect his username and posts with ‘Harry Potter’ was pretty slim. Besides, it felt good that he’d most likely be the only person on Tumblr with this username.
“So? That could be anyone,” Draco denied, fingers gliding over the keys as he typed.
“Then tell her that,” Harry replied. “Mione likes you as well, Ron, but she’s worried you don’t see her for anything other than a friend.”
“What the fuck! Since when?” Ron suddenly roared, jumping to his feet to stare at his best mate. Harry shrugged miserably.
” The Gryffindor gasped weakly, the overload of sensations becoming too much. His hands had found one of the legs of Draco’s bed and were gripping it for dear life as the Slytherin demonstrated just how wonderfully his tongue was talented.
me, Potter!” a voice spat.
A smirk curled at Draco’s lips. “The internet is amazing,” he said simply. “I don’t know how I managed without it.”
Harry was slightly amazed by their playing banter as they teased and insulted one another. It wasn’t like Hermione to be so easy-going, nor was it normal to see Parkinson so relaxed around others that weren’t from her own house.
“But it’s not as if you need the money anyway so it could be a hobby with benefits...”
Harry’s Facebook popped up and Ron observed with interest as Harry checked his notifications.
With a groan, Harry rolled over, pulling his blankets up to his chin. God, he was
“Typical.” Harry chuckled. “Well I’m done playing nurse-maid. If I see another grotty tissue anywhere near me I’m going to flip.”
be hearing things.
“Mother? Mother, what’s wrong?” he asked, frowning in concern. “What’s happened?”
“It was Harry’s business!” Ron replied quickly. “Besides, it’s not like you asked me outwardly where Harry was.”
“Hmm…” Draco leant forwards, tonguing the slit of Harry’s cock and causing the brunet to whimper, “is that really something you should be saying to the male currently holding your dick?” He twisted his wrist, clenching and unclenching his fingers teasingly. Harry found himself leaning back against the wall, legs shaking, and cock positively throbbing in Draco’s hand.
An excited bark of laughter caught his attention and he swung his focus to the wardrobe.
“This isn’t homework.” Potter grinned as Draco pushed him back against the carpet.
Harry’s smile was wide as he opened up his messages page.
“Thank you, Draco,” Pansy said honestly. “I’ll help keep the hoard back for you now—I don’t mind helping some of the younger years.”
Another moment of silence.
“You’re absolutely correct, I withdraw my apology.”
Harry glanced longingly up the staircase. He had hoped to escape to his dormitory before Malfoy hunted him down. No such luck.
“Mother, good morni—” Draco faltered. “Mother?”
“I know,” he said in response. “Do not worry, mother. Regardless of what happens, I will find father, alright? I’ll make sure he comes home to you.”
Pansy’s nose crinkled. “That is not what I meant and you know it,” she snapped in reply. “You’re my best friend, Draco, I just want to make sure you’re safe.”
.” The clock tossed a dirty napkin onto the pile of filthy cloths. “After all, Harry did say please.”
he could be,” Ron agreed, half-heartedly. His gaze swept over the Slytherin table, hoping, like Hermione, to see his best mate—even if he was sitting with dirty Slytherins.
“Blast.”
“Fuck off, Draco, this doesn’t concern you,” Nott spat nastily, eyes still on Harry.
be pleasantly surprising? That Potter and I will just suddenly stop hating one another? That Potter would willingly become my blood donor? I have a feeling he’d rather stake me through the heart.”
“So?”
Harry smothered a groan as he realised the truth behind his thoughts. His previous attempts at dating had all failed miserably. It certainly wasn’t a lack of trying on Harry’s behalf—he had really striven to be attracted to Cho and Ginny and even that muggle boy he’d met during the summer. Yet no matter how strong his intent, how much he yearned for a conventional relationship… it had never seemed to work out. Harry was just unable to connect to them in a way that others did.
“Shut up.”
Immediately, the blond’s gaze was drawn to the hideous décor, the many animal heads staring blankly in return. His eyes then travelled to the moving figure that swept across the room.
Draco rubbed his temples. “Do I
Ron grinned. “Told you so, mate.”
“So immature, Draco.” Pansy sniffed.
Hermione snapped her book shut and followed the brunet up to his room. She could see that he was rather excited about their talk—the reason behind why though, Hermione couldn’t be sure. There was no way he could have guessed that she knew so there would of course,
“You’re late, Lucius.”
Harry welcomed the way the blond pressed against him. “Then don’t give me a reason to,” he replied, voice slightly breathy. His lips parted immediately as Draco’s mouth descended onto his, eyes drifting shut as the blond’s familiar tongue swept enticingly, demanding entrance. The pent up desire that had been driving the two of them to the brink over the past few days suddenly erupted and Harry’s hands moved, touching the blond wherever he could.
“How’d it go? Did he truly hurt Harry on purpose? You didn’t hurt him did you?”
Hermione snorted elegantly. “So
he thought drily.
him.”
“I—I just—” Potter cleared his throat, eyes flicking up and down as he fiddled with his knife. “I… thought it would be appropriate for you to send a letter to your father,” he stated gruffly. “To let him know you’re fine. To stop people from looking for you.”
“Oh god,” Draco fretted, looking anywhere but the Gryffindor table.
The corner of Harry’s mouth quirked. “Well you
“You heard me.” The blond smiled wickedly. “I still have many chances to upstage you, Potter. Just because quidditch is no longer on the list does not mean I will stop kicking your arse at everything else.”
“Would you just tell me what you want already?” Potter questioned impatiently, jerking his arms into a defensive fold against his chest.
Harry lifted his head, catching Malfoy’s gaze. The blond quirked his head in invitation and, after a slight hesitation, Harry went to him silently. Ron made to follow but it was Hermione’s gentle hand on his arm that prevented him. The red head looked at her and she simply shook her head, staring at him knowingly. Ron huffed but remained where he was, turning concerned blue eyes in Harry’s direction.
Harry patiently waited for his friend to end her rant. “Yeah, Mione, I know,” he said pointedly. “But the year’s only just started, relax will you? I’ll be fine.”
“Maybe later,” the blond purred, littering placating kisses down the brunet’s jaw. “For now…” He began to move, shifting down the length of the Gryffindor until his mouth hovered over the straining erection poking through the gap in Potter’s trousers, still restrained by red satin. He mouthed the stiff cock, enjoying the way Harry writhed and gasped beneath him. The brunet’s fingers were still tangled in his hair and Draco enjoyed the way they tightened with each sucking kiss Draco applied to the sensitive area.
"Do you like your new house?" Draco asked while taking a sip of his warm tea. Harry nodded and shrugged his shoulders.
Harry busied himself with the tea as Draco took in the house. "Do your children like it here? I know mine would, what with all the open grounds?" Harry chuckled and pulled a glass from the cabinet directly left of the stove.
"You scared the shite out of me, Harry." Harry smiled.
"You wish, Draco's down the hall in his study." Harry smiled and slowly made his way down the hall. Seeing the large wooden doors he knocked once.
"All good I hope." The other man laughed.
"When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?" Harry narrowed his eyes, he actually couldn't recall, probably to Lily when she was younger.
Harry sighed, "Well, there are tons, but probably my mother." Ackley smiled.
"I know." He says, startling Draco.
"Well, because," Harry hesitated. "The only way I can describe this is they like their mother more. She is always around more than I, doing more fun thing with them. She also kept the house, so, a sense of familiarity I guess is another reason."
"This is him?" Harry asked. Draco nodded and stood, picking up the vase of Lillys, he summoned a watering can. Harry jumped slightly before the magic settled into his bones, reassuring him.
"Come to bed soon, will you?" Draco agreed and smiled softly at the man.
Beware that this book is far from complete, we still have lots to go over and I hope you stick around for it!
Draco swallowed convulsively as he tried not to throw up. He turned away, wiping the blood from his mouth. The crimson fluid that he had once been able to swallow was now rotten in his mouth; fermented like decayed fruit. He found himself staring at her in horror, the realisation of what he had done settling over his shoulders. Recognising the look on his face, Pansy gasped.
Both Harry and Hermione turned identical frowns to their friend who raised his hands quickly.
As the scent of his mate hit his nose, Draco’s head suddenly snapped back. He turned incredulous eyes to Harry’s face which was turned away, his eyes shut tight and entire body trembling.
—Harry to be receptive to his advances; Draco desired a partner who yearned for him as much as he did in return. Those wonderful moments when the blond had sensed the Gryffindor’s longing had only fuelled his resolve despite Potter’s reluctance.
The blond snorted elegantly. “Please, Potter, I believe our potential sexual activities are a
“Every other day,” Harry replied. “Usually wherever we feel like parking our butts.”
He thought sourly, closing his eyes as he fell.
Harry felt Malfoy unbutton his jeans and then slide down the length of his figure. Malfoy shoved Harry’s shirt up and out of the way so he was able to drag his tongue teasingly across the brunet’s skin. Harry squirmed, his breath coming out in gasps.
“Happy Valentine’s Day, love.”
“Are you honestly going to sulk all lesson?” Harry stated, quirking an unimpressed eyebrow.
“You could have
The blond sniffed and lifted his chin. “Maybe,” he said, indignantly.
“Pottah?”
Hermione grinned slyly. “I wouldn’t say
“Yet,” Potter grinned.
“What about that guy, Harry?”
“Why not number them while I’m at it.”
Pansy stared at Draco in complete desecration. “Why didn’t you
“Wait a minute, unless Potter has suddenly decided to come out, would he really allow her to view his profile?” Draco frowned.
Draco blinked blankly. “I was told you wanted to see me.”
“Do—Do you like it?” Harry asked hesitantly. His left hand fiddled nervously with his bandage and he watched Draco with slightly guarded eyes.
The blond swallowed around the growing lump his throat. He took another sip of tea before answering.
“Did you say what I think you just said?” Harry asked incredulously.
! Seriously, Pansy, we’ve gone seven years hating those idiotic lions, why are you all of a sudden trying to combine our houses?”
“Voldemort was a ruthless, murdering tyrant,” Harry grunted sharply, ignoring Eli’s wince. “I’d rather not spend our time talking about him.”
you my sign would work.”
Still… Harry wondered how his life would have turned out is Malfoy wasn’t such a git…
“Nothing,” Draco replied automatically, taking Pansy’s hand into his.
Reflecting on the conversation he and Malfoy had had the other night, Harry understood that the blond was truly sorry for what he had done. After all, it was completely out of Malfoy’s nature to be as accommodating as he had been, and the mere fact that the blond was out of sorts over his mistake was evidence enough for Harry.
“Just hold still,” the blond ordered with a frown. Before Potter could stop him, he had placed the hot damp cloth into the injury and the brunet roared in pain, pulling back from Draco before the blond could stop him.
“I doubt we’ll find an answer in our textbooks—I’m positive Professor Snape did that on purpose. I know that man enjoys knowing things his students don’t.”
Slowly, surprisingly, Draco’s face began to relax, his gaze acquiring a searching glimmer as he stared at the brunet, eyebrow quirking slightly.
“Don’t touch,” she said, slapping his hand away. “Not until you’ve decontaminated your hands.”
Quicker than he believed possible, Draco had swung Harry into his embrace, carrying him as if his mate weighed nothing.
Potter shrugged. “Because it’s you,” he said honestly. “I find myself unable to grasp that this is even happening let alone confessing secrets to you of all people.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Malfoy replied, “and allow me to appreciate such a glorious specimen.”
“We’re currently working out our differences aren’t we? Hopefully we won’t hate each other by the time term resumes.”
,” Draco interjected with a grin. “If I recall correctly we were doing fan-bloody-tastic the other evening.”
“Are you sure?” Harry teased, taking a seat beside her on the couch.
And there Draco was, sharing smirks and quips, touching the brunet, speaking to him, acting as if nothing had happened. And it
that boy deny him! Even to go as far as placing a ward to keep him out?!
Potter however had become a sort of game, wherein both he and Pansy had placed themselves strategically in the best possibly place for limited contact with the Gryffindor. This included avoiding all open windows.
“That was just good luck,” Potter replied, shoving his hands into his jacket pockets, “because I like you in return. If I didn’t, you’d end up having to try harder wouldn’t you?”
“Well?” Potter said irritably, green eyes bright with anger.
She nodded, watching him cross the floor to the stairs. Ron climbed them apprehensively. He had no idea how he was going to handle this, he only hoped he wouldn’t say something stupid and make it the entire situation worse.
“He refuses to acknowledge that fact for now,” Malfoy smirked evilly. “My mother on the other hand… sometimes she’s just as bad as Pansy.” He nudged the other boy’s leg with his foot. “Come on, Potter, it’s your turn now, what do you want to know?”
“I can live with that.” Pansy smirked at his red cheeks. “Blushing bride.”
did you do?”
“Was that a heavily disguised compliment?”
and collect any useful information. The
Another smile quirked at his lips, his body positively humming with delight.
“I’m not!”
Malfoy’s gaze was slightly heated as he stared at Harry and the brunet tried as hard as he could not to fidget.
“Wait, Draco, I’ll go—”
Draco glanced up at her. “Your influence is so strong it hardly felt as if you were gone.”
Pansy glared at her friend, intent on gaining his attention. “I heard the other day that Blaise and Weasley made out,” she said, examining her nails.
“What is it, Ronald?” she asked, eye gaze still fixed pointedly on the parchment below.
“I don’t want this,” he managed to whisper. Something sharp shot across his chest as he watched the way Malfoy suddenly recoiled from him, disbelief etched on the Slytherin’s face.
“Merlin you two are frustrating,” she growled, jabbing a finger in their direction. “You’ll want my help soon enough.”
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about this revelation. On one hand, Potter did not outright loathe him. On another, the brunet had no clue as to what had been done to him; what Draco had taken…
“Fine.”
“Can we study about Potter’s love life? I find myself suddenly interested,” Pansy grinned evilly.
for his mate, that Harry had expected nothing but brute force. When Malfoy’s arms cradled Harry so tenderly however, his surprise gave way to a surge of arousal. He felt his body grow hot, his heart thundering in his chest as he felt Malfoy’s lips move against his skin. A moan boiled up inside Harry’s throat, his eyes rolling back as waves of pure pleasure coursed through him. It took him a moment to realise the harsh pants he could hear were
The Slytherin’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. “Don’t go there, Potter,” he said seriously. “I meant it as a joke. I promise you I’m not actually messing around with you in terms of our… relationship.”
“You and Draco—do you think you guys will be able to work it out?”
And that wasn’t about to change.
Jumping on the much needed distraction, the blond snorted. “Please, Pansy, that’s much too easy. Make it ten galleons and within the first five minutes and you’re on.”
Ron’s grin told Harry how well his idea sat with the red-head. “A picnic! That’s a great idea!”
Once on the pitch, Draco wasted no time in swinging his leg over his broom and kicking off from the ground. Although his interest in quidditch had diminished, flying at a leisurely pace was something the blond had always enjoyed; especially when stressed. Flying in lazy circles, dips, dives and loop de loops, Draco relished in the lack of the annoying inner voice; flying higher and higher and faster and faster until his heart was beating wildly from excitement. He loved moments like these, where no one, not even Pansy, could see him so carefree and happy.
“No!” Harry replied quickly, head snapping up to look at the blond. “No, you were right about me being ignorant… about me trying to force this and hurting you. I think…” He rubbed the back of his head awkwardly, wincing as his gaze dropped back to the carpet. “I think, subconsciously, I wanted to hurt you as you had hurt me.” The brunet suddenly flinched, agony swimming in his green eyes as he stared at Draco, his face paling at his own admission. “But that—fuck—that’s not—” Harry stumbled over his words, his stomach rolling unpleasantly. “God that makes me sound like such a vindictive bastard.” He ran a trembling hand through his hair, turning away from the blond. “Look, I’m sorry—I’ll just—”
“Don’t ever tease me like that again,” Malfoy growled possessively.
Ron shrugged. “What about him? He was his normal bigoted self.”
Malfoy blinked at him sleepily. “Why do you need reassurance every time I tell you something? Still don’t trust me?”
It was one thing to crave someone. It was another to crave someone who wanted nothing to do with him only to be coerced forcibly. And, good god, there would be no way he could stay away from Potter now, not after finally tasting his mate. Draco had never felt so fulfilled. He was whole; the empty hollow that had been plaguing him for weeks filled entirely with Harry’s presence. And he only yearned for him more.
“Well…” Ron began slowly. “I mean don’t you think it’s a little… weird? Like, it was so sudden.”
Over and over again Draco brought Potter to the brink but would not allow him to finish. Draco was taking great pleasure in having so much control and was thoroughly enjoying the sounds Potter was making. The teasing had almost become too much for the brunet when Draco suddenly hummed around Potter’s arousal, effectively breaking the hold Potter had. He came with a cry, back arching for what seemed an eternity until he slumped back down against the carpet, eyes closed and mouth lax.
“And?”
“We prefer to study at least once a day,” Hermione shrugged. “When and where do you and Parkinson study, Harry?”
“So, Potter, what’s your favourite class?”
“So I’ve seen,” Harry moped. “He gets along with you alright, he even
!” Draco shouted. “And
,” she conjectured, quirking an eyebrow. “But you seem to forget that I am not a Slytherin. I still care about people regardless of how they may have acted. Lately, you’ve made it hard for me to continue to hate you. It’s funny how you were able to show me your humanity once you lost yours.”
As always, much love and happy reading,
___________________________________
The next picture was one of him and Draco; Harrys' smile went even wider. "That was the day you proposed. You were both ecstatic."
Draco smiled again, "What about during the Fall when she's gone for Quidditch?"
"That's our yard, and that's you and Rosie last fall." Draco obviously likes this photo, it's one of the bigger ones, framed too, and all the colours are vibrant, almost glowing. He closes his eyes and sees where it usually hangs in their entry hall.
"Do your students call you Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy-Potter, or just Mr Malfoy?" Snapping his head up, saw Percy looking around his classroom.
"He's gone, Draco." Looking up, the blonde sighed but continued pulling weeds. Moving in front of the blonde, he looked as Draco's brow creased in concentration.
"I have a hunch he had an affair with his first partner too." Percy sighed and leaned back on his hands, looking up into the slowly setting sun.
"She showed you how to get to the platform, and you, one of her children, Ron, shared a train car. You two became fast friends. You also met Hermione on the train, though you guys didn't become friends until later on."
After they were done, they got under Harry's blankets and snuggled together. Looking down to the blonde he winced.
"Oh?" Draco asked, taking another sip from his cup. Harry looked to his coat sitting beside him on the sofa. It was heavy, long, black, and did its job of keeping him warm extremely well. His red scarf sat on top of his coat. Draco wore a soft, grey scarf. Harry would probably wear a more neutral one like Draco's had his kids not gotten him the one he was currently wearing-
"No. I guess I'm more upset with myself for letting it get that far." Draco nodded.
"That's good that you two came to an agreement, studies have shown the more you try to get along the happier the kids are." Draco paused for a moment, seemingly choosing his next words carefully. "I like the idea of your kids getting to pick. What do you think they will choose."
The next picture she handed him was on what he assumed was their wedding day. "That was all of us on your guy's wedding, the Weasleys, all our friends, Dracos friends, everyone!"
The cloudy spring sky made the room feel cosy and warm. The tall windows showed the vast outdoor wooden area Percy's house sat on.
Draco nodded signalling Harry to continue, "But, it would be totally different than just casual sex if we took it to the next level. We would have to intertwine our lives and, and," Harry paused.
Draco looked down to his soft grey jumper that fell off his shoulders slightly, showing his exposed collarbones, then looked back up at Harry. "Those were two very different trains of thoughts, 'hey I slept with a 17-year-old', and 'why do you keep wearing jumpers?'"
"It's alright, I want to follow you." Draco smiled and opened a single french door. Harry went out first, stepping out onto a pato. All around him were flowers, bursting with colour.
"Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?" Harry stirred the stew that was sitting on the stove once more and thought about it.
Draco took a very deep breath and was quiet until they pulled into a charming ranch style home's driveway. Flowers lined the front, and the grass was dark green and mowed, there were trees in the back that Harry could see, but only one small tree sat outside a massive window in the front. It was cute, quaint, and looked exactly like Draco-- like he had just left a little part of him in the ground years ago, and it made something that fit him perfectly.
"Well, I feel like you overcompensate a bit, you try to be everything even though it gets tiring. That's why you have books varying in author, subject, and theme." Harry paused for a moment.
"You became an Auror and put my father in Azkaban, I became a 2nd-grade teacher, and four years later, Rose was born, and you became a Godfather for the second time."
"Wait!" Harry turned around, "How have you been?" He looked over Draco's worried face.
"Malfoy?" Ron asked pulling his tee-shirt back over his head. "Are you saying you'd like to be a couple?" Harry thought over it, what was he saying?
He could remember when Draco threw Harry his own wand, the wand Harry had then used to defeat the Dark Lord. He had begun to recognize some school years.
"I take back the thing about the smiles, I like them better than you consciously trying to erase them." Draco stared at him for a long moment before standing.
He watched as Hermione dazzled the room with her wit and sharp tongue as he hovered in the corner drinking. The whiskey was only just now reaching his head, making him feel a bit better about the whole situation.
The next morning when Harry woke, Draco wasn't in bed. Flipping the covers off, he opened their bedroom door and moved into the hall. Quickly walking its length, he found Draco sitting at the island. I coffee glass, and a book opens in front of him.
"Um, it was the Summer of 2002." He then opened a cabinet door and began pulling different spices from the cabinet. He then went over to the icebox and pulled a small container of brown liquid from it.

"You and Ginny are speaking again, yes?" Draco had switched out some of the pictures on his desk Harry noticed. The one with the man and him was changed to Crabbe, Goyle, and Draco when they were young.
Harry shot up in bed, his dream making his night pants uncomfortably tight. How he wished he could stop having wet dreams over a man he could never have.
Ackley spun it around and opened it, "Your friend who was betrothed to my mother was Draco Malfoy?" Ackley pushed the book away and looked over Harry.
"If you would like, you could stay with me." He watched as Ackley shivered and leaned into Harry. He caught himself though, and Harry moved back.
The blonde was facing away from the house and had on gloves. He was pulling weeds and throwing them into a basket no too far from him. He was mumbling things under his breath when Harry approached him.

"I think mine is my adoptive parents." They sat in relative silence until dinner was done.
"You are such a bad lair!" Ron looked surprised, as Harry moved away from him slightly. "You should just say that you don't wanna." Ron stood.
"I slept with a 17-year-old, and! ~
The raven-haired man never said another word about it. Instead, they talked about Ginny and the kids, school, and Quidditch, but Draco never brought up the situation with Harry.
"Could you not just keep it a secret, it happened once." Draco huffed and cocked his head.
He really couldn't, it would be like sleeping with his own son. James was just about to turn 17 and here he was, toying with a child. He listened as Ackley rustled around, packing things away.
"What did they do to you, Greyback and Voldermort?" Draco sighed and put on a weary smile.
"My mum used to make Cornish pasties when I was young. When I was living here for a while, I found this little place that makes them almost as good as mum does." Percy was currently taking Draco's raincoat off and pulling out his chair. "I found nothing else settles the nervous stomach like a good home-cooked meal."
"Is that what you're telling yourself?" Draco sighed.
Harry hummed, "I promised I would meet Hermione and Ron for lunch." Harry watched as Draco gave him another smile and went back to writing.
He told Draco to sit and that he would get the tea. The floor had terracotta tiles in the shades sage and grey. He had chosen the furniture to match to hints of sage.
"I figured I owed you." Was all Harry said before standing once more. "Would you like to stay for dinner?"
Flipping off the lights, he stood in the doorway for a long whole, contemplating the papers sitting on his desk. He could throw them in the fire right now, and they could go back to normal.

"You try to put the past behind you by welcoming everyone, witch, wizard, muggle, with a warm smile and an open mind. You cover up your scars, your failures, with your knowledge, wit, and of course, your ever-present overcompensation."
Ackley sat and mulled over this.
This Love- Maroon 5
"Where's your better half?" Harry asked, taking another sip from his tumbler.
Draco was left-handed Harry noticed, and still wore a small silver wedding band. Sighing he returned his thoughts back to the session at hand.
Percy reached for him, but Draco moved before he could touch him. "Draco, I didn't mean-" Draco shook his head and moved back further.
"Do me a favour Harry," Draco said while standing, "Write down what you feel over the next week and bring that back to me." Harry rolled his eyes but agreed none the less.
He was dark complected with dark chestnut hair. He wasn't built like Draco either, he was bigger and rugged, while Draco was lithe and lanky.
Draco smiled and smelled it fondly.
Harry shook his head and stood, "I just wanted to know what you were telling yourself about the whole incident was all, I never asked for your stance on the matter."
"Well, you look totally out of your element, especially dressed like that." Harry looked down to his pressed dress trousers and a button-down shirt, he had left the top few buttons undone and had a black blazer pulled over it.
Sorry for the long wait today, and then a very short chapter, it only has around three hundred words, usually when I write they are in the high thousands, so very sorry. But, everything is about to get good, just bear with me for a few more short chapters!
"I can't say I have ever seen you at a Gala." Harry spun around to see Draco Malfoy standing there, looking better than ever. He was dressed in a black and white tuxedo with a dark rose coloured bow tie clinging to his neck.
"No, that's what I told my husband." Harry put his head in his hands and thought about this for a moment.
As always, much love and happy reading,
^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^
"Hey, well, I'm awake now!" Harry offered to his friends, trying to comfort them.
"I'd say they were loyal Voldermort supporters, every once and a while a gaggle of them will show up somewhere, then, poof, their gone again." The book Draco had loaned him sat in between them.
