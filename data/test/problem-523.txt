To their surprise, he didn't have any bad reaction. On the contrary, he simply congratulated Ginny for her win.
"Well, wow. Then I guess, once again, you should have listened to me." Harry admonished, slapping his shoulder lightly. "She almost broke us up."
Ron stopped walking and gave him a look. He was right, there was no denying in that, but he was right there, in his house, alongside his boyfriend.
He was surprised, though, that the Gryffindors, whom he had bullied relentlessly through the years, were more supportive than his own house mates.
Narcissa looked relieved with Draco's answer, then she cupped his face in her hands and planted a soft kiss on his temple.
Hermione pronounced the password to the common room. The portrait moved to the left and they crawled their way in, one by one.
"Mmm, weird, it won't open... I guess someone is inside." said a soft voice at the other side of the wall. The boys thanked the law of the Room, which prevented anyone from stepping foot inside of it if it were full and they didn't know the reason why.
He stared at them as Potter ran his fingers through her hair, eliciting a giggle from the girl. It was nauseating to watch those lovebirds, if anything. They could get a bloody room, for one.
"I agree with her!" said Ron. "Harry is my best friend, as well as my brother, and I am happy to 'deliver' him in the hands of this bloke right here. They are one of those couples that you look at thinking 'man, this is true love'! And besides, they are two of the most important people in my life. I love you so much, guys!" He, too, was weeping lightly.
Hermione's eyes were filled with tears. She wiped her eyes and snuggled into Ron's shoulder, who held her into an embrace and kissed her head, then looked at the kissing couple and couldn't stop smiling. He felt proud of his friend.
"So um... do you think I'm cute with your mum's gloves?" Luna asked her for a second time, as she sat in the bed next to the other girl.
All of a sudden, his heart sank into his chest, breaking into a million pieces, as he witnessed something he never wished to see.
Draco noticed that the whole room was decorated with Gryffindor and Slytherin flags, so much so that it looked like a Quidditch match was in order. There were also paper hearts and petals scattered all over the floor and table. The chairs were two large maroon poufs with the Hogwarts crest sewed on. He mentally applauded the room and its creator for the artsy view.
Her innocent smile faded as she noticed that the other girl was sitting on her bed, only wearing her underwear.
An harmonious and soft music pervaded the whole room as four hearts beat faster than those belonging to anyone else in the vicinity.
"What do you care, Blaise? It's not something that defines me. But if you're not willing to accept this, then I don't see why we should carry on with our friendship." Draco responded, feeling confident. This earned him a smile from his boyfriend.
"Oh, Draco..." he said, looking at Molly, who nodded for him to continue. "I think I owe you an apology."
They ended up making love into the tub. That was what they both needed to end that exhausting and stressful day.
"Congratulations Big Brother!" Came Ginny's voice. It was the signal. Harry was going to be the next one raising his glass for the newly weds.
Their four friends cheered for the two of them as they both ran through the field, all while laughing hysterically.
"I'm so annoyed that you won't get to sleep in my bed tonight." Harry pouted to Draco, who moved his hair out his face.
Muggles' memories would have been modified anyway, though, as some of them had actually been jinxed.
"Oh, that would be the Nargles, Draco." said Luna, suddenly sitting up, hitting Ginny's face with her hair.
"Well he asked me if it was worth it, losing my father over him. I mean, it sounded a bit out of place. Like, who even is he?" as he said so, he let out a sigh of frustration.
"The way I see it, they're not worth beating yourself up over. Honestly, your parents are... despicable. And I mean no offence." said Harry. "I mean... throwing you out of their lives because you like men? Not even a Christmas card. Sadly as it sounds, you need to try and learn to let them go." he looked down with sad eyes.
The truth was that she wasn't that bad at flying herself - when in Ginny's backyard, she pretended to be terrible at things just to get her attention.
"Oh I think I see one!" Ginny exclaimed, then she detached herself from the other girl to run towards an object that looked like an egg.
Now, she knew that Ginny was going to 'make impossible happen' because she already knew how to do these things - at least, partly.
Draco couldn't read her facial expression, he wasn't sure what it meant, to be honest. It felt a bit weird for him, since he had called her the worst fat shaming names in the past.
He had been heartless. Maybe even his father had taken a part in this vicious plan, pretending to hate his son while he was planning his exquisite revenge.
Draco and Harry were happy to find out that Percy had an urgency at work,  so he had to rush to The Ministry and couldn't stay any longer.
Hermione had chosen to wear her mother's wedding dress, however she wanted some changes made to it - all of which Molly took care of.
Later that day, Draco found himself sitting under his precious tree, alone for once. Not that he loathed having someone to keep him company, but damn, it felt so good to be alone, sometimes. Just as he began to bask into this much needed 'me time' he heard footsteps coming his way. Ugh, why couldn't he just spend a few minutes undisturbed? He looked up to see who the loser was, only to see his crush staring back at him. "Hey." Potter said, looking a bit uneasy. Nevermind the me time, this would be so much better. "I'm not a broken hearts club, Potter, I'll have you know that. I see you're falling out a bit with Lady Weasley, eh?"
"Guys, I will miss this school so much! I will miss seeing you every day!" The green eyed boy said, throwing himself at his best friends, who had pulled away from Ginny.
His trail of thoughts was interrupted by the sound of Harry's light snoring. As he turned his head to look at him, he wondered if there was anything cuter than that in the whole world.
If he made someone feel small, he would be granted the feeling that he would always look for, he felt superior.
"Not to burst your bubble, but... Don't you think you're rushing a bit? I mean, you've just gotten together..." Hermione said.
"Wow guys, won't you look outside? The weather is dreadful." Hermione said, something like five minutes later.
Luna gave a squeal of contentment and she wrapped her arms around her girlfriend's neck, going in for a kiss.
Ron had a point. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but he was interrupted by Miss Sivan's voice. "Come see how you did, this time." she said, then with a swift movement of her wand she made a grade sheet appear.
With one last tear filled look at the cosy Common Room, which enclosed significant memories itself, the four friends left to go meet the rest of the school in the Great Hall. It was time for the leaving feast, but none of them, with the exception of Ginny, was excited for it.
"Because I am in love with you, Draco! Can't you see? I have always loved you, given you everything, while that goody goody Potter screwed you once and got you under his spell!" Pansy shouted. "I thought I had to make you both pay. I figured, if I had transformed into a boy, I could have seduced you, thus separating you two. And I had made it!"
He snapped out of his thoughts and looked at her. Ron was too busy stuffing his mouth with food to notice them.
They would have had to stay in a place that sounded like the Leaky Cauldron, only French, Le Chaudron De La Sorcière.
"Thanks, Gin." Said Hermione. She then removed her hands from Ginny's hold and flashed her a bright smile.
Her hair was tied in ponytail with multiple bands, each of them 'embellished' with a Butterbeer cap. She was wearing the dress Hermione had worn at George's  marriage ceremony, the colour had been changed to green, though.
"I don't have time for your childish matters. I know you two don't like each other, but you need to finish this work, or you won't be able to pass this year, I'm afraid."
She had taken it personal. "Draco, you could have had me, but you chose to fool around with Potter, of all people!"
"Draco..."Ron said, giving him a pitiful look. "If I may... It's simply not worth it... I know this sounds harsh but they will never accept you, not if they don't open their minds."
With a mischievous look, Harry snatched the cookie from his lover's hand with his mouth and munched on it right away.
In the last two months, she and Draco had developed a friendship filled with funny bickerings and teasing.
"Oh, morning, sweetie." Laura greeted her daughter with a smile. "You're just in time for lunch. Gather your friends here, will you?"
He and Harry were sitting next to each other, holding hands underneath the table, while Ron and Hermione were sitting opposite them, also holding hands.
"That'd be you, Malfoy." Harry replied sassily. Oh, how he loved his sassy come backs at Malfoy. He couldn't hurt him, really.
Luna straddled her, taking in the breathtaking view. Then, she carefully placed a hand on each breast, teasing them softly.
Luna looked around, then, when she thought it was safe to speak, she moved closer to her girlfriend and whispered in her ear.
Also, he thought that not forgiving Pansy would be silly on his part, given that he had done things that were significantly worse than putting a picture on a banner.
"It begins!" said Luna, calling to the boys' attention. The House Cup winner would have been revealed.
"I'm sorry." Said Draco, meeting his gaze. "I just wish they weren't so obsessed with traditions and purebloods, you know? Why can't we have a civil relationship? No, we can only hate each other."
Hermione nodded, holding on to the washbasin for support. "Since I wasn't getting my period, I took about twenty tests, magical and muggle, and they all turned out to be positive."
"There's only one way to find out..." Hermione said, looking around the room. "Harry, where do you keep that map of yours?" she asked her friend.
"But it's in a week? I mean, it's impossible to find the dresses in little to no time!" Hermione squeaked.
Draco couldn't find the words, he was far too touched to do so. He was only able to say "Oh, Harry..."
He remembered her insufferable giggle as she'd play with Harry's hair. Now, there she was, congratulating him for accepting to marry her ex boyfriend.
Hermione was the one to break the silence. "Pansy, I hope you know that this is a criminal offence. You will be expelled for this, as a minimum. This is serious, Azkaban serious." She said, sternly.
"We're not afraid of you, Potter." Blaise said. "You are just a pompous shit who struts around saying that he saved the world. But you're just a fairy, is all that you are." He said in a disgusted voice.
"He's telling the truth." said Hermione. She rose back up. "We need to get to Harry, before he does anything stupid."
Hermione's Grandmother looked a lot like her, she had the same kind of bushy hair, just that hers was white. She was a frail woman, possibly in her eighties, her voice was slightly dreamy, kind of like Luna's.
Professor McGonagall, Hagrid, Miss Sivan, Mr and Mrs Weasley tried to stop Lucius and his henchmen by firing silent Stupefys, but to no avail. He dodged every shot.
And besides, Draco needed this and he couldn't always speak up for him, his fiancé was perfectly capable of standing up for himself.
Ginny had to share her bedroom with Luna, so they slept in the same bed, Luna sporting a provocative position now and again. She was determined to seduce her, it seemed. But Ginny fought her urges.
They didn't sit close to one another. Blaise looked at Draco quizzically and the blonde boy simply shook his head. Harry didn't go sit with Ron and Hermione, he sat next to Neville.
He knew that something greater than stress cause by exams had to be behind his lover's strange behaviour.
Ron blinked, hardly believing his ears. He had not gotten used to the fact that this was Draco Malfoy. The same Draco Malfoy who had bullied him for years... was now in his home, sitting on his brother's bed, giving him advice while Harry was on his lap.
"It's not like you need to have a tea party with them! You just have to sleep in the same room as me and hang around my common room." Draco sat up as well.
Ginny continued her screams of joy. "Stella Thompson is a terrific seeker! She's my second favourite player!"
There, dancing at a wedding,he was even more joyous. He was not afraid to show anyone that he loved him, another male. And his love for him was stronger than any spell, it was simple and pure and it was all it took to make him happy. He wanted to feel this way forever.
As the years went by, little Draco got close to both of his parents, but his dad had formed a special bond with him.
Although, at the Slytherin table, a perplexed Pansy was looking at the pink trail of sparkles the air kiss had produced, but she could have easily mistaken it for one of those magic illusions of the Great Hall sky-like ceiling.
"So, Ginny, I don't know if you do this too in your home, but Luna and I have a special tradition for this day! It's hunting nargle eggs!" Xenophilius said excitedly.
"Thanks, Draco." He said, grinning at him. "And Harry. For putting up with me. But don't tell Hermione how I've been, ok?"
This wasn't what they had established. Draco mentally shivered. He had never been in a relationship before, he had always opted for friends with benefits.
Draco gulped, feeling guilty. Harry's look contained a strong disappointment and he knew he had caused it.
His second year hadn't been too fun - he'd almost lost his sister- but he'd still managed to create indelible memories with the two most important people in his life.
How was it that the Malfoys always heard these things about Draco? First, that he was spending easter at Hermione's house, now that he had gotten engaged to Harry.
"You know, Jean Jacques reminds me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who.." Hermione observed.
After paying for their drinks, the four of them rushed to the Grangers' house, fearing that the howler would burst.
"No, don't go near him. This is Draco's father. He's a dangerous man." Hermione warned, grabbing her father's arm.
"Anyone but me, uh, Draco? " Pansy whined. She has always had a crush on him and found it rather unfair that he would go checking out everyone else but her.
Draco was sitting under the tree in the Hogwarts courtyard. It was his favorite spot to study, he found it so relaxing. But that day in November he wasn't too focused on his transfiguration book, in fact, something else had captured his attention: Potter.
"Oh, she's so beautiful!" Hermione's mother chanted, holding her husband's hand as he sat next to her.
Blaise gave him a disgusted look in response, but he seemed to be entertained. "So are you. Now, get to work!" He ordered.
Now I can die happily, she thought as Gwenog Jones in person got up from her seat to squeeze her into a hug and wish her a happy birthday.
"I see them and I can't help identifying myself in them. Their love reminds me of my experience with my boyfriend, Draco, who is with me today..." He went on.
Hermione sighed, but it was Ron who spoke. "It just takes a bit of getting used to, that's all. But, Harry, do be careful with those exchanges. You don't want the whole school to see..."
After her parents left, Ginny ran to the Great Hall. She was determined to apologise to Harry and Draco. She had done something terrible to them. Sure, Harry had hurt her, but he didn't deserve this. She wondered if she had become a bad person. She wasn't positive that she would gain Harry's forgiveness, but she knew that her own forgiveness was far from being achieved.
Luna had spent the whole flight with her face on her girlfriend's shoulder, babbling that at their height they could have been attacked by Flying Cramplehorned Snorkacks.
Luna, Ginny, Harry and Draco were all sitting on top of their trunks, trying to recover from their traumatizing experience.
Harry had calmed him down many times with this method, it only made sense for Draco to return the favour.
Harry didn't mind not giving his own speech - it would have ended up with him bawling his eyes out, not being able to finish it.
Harry proceeded to lightly tug on the girl's left year nineteen times. It didn't hurt, at all, Ginny observed.
The truth was that Harry was undeniably stressed because of the NEWTs and everything else and Draco knew just what he had to do to calm his nerves.
Ginny smiled back at her, then she turned to Draco. "And Draco, when Harry is with you... he's literally the happiest man in the world. The way he looks at you... He's so in love with you, I don't think it's even remotely possible for him to want to divorce you."
"I never even expected him to do anything, you know? I didn't even want to be with him in the first place. I simply wanted a few nights of meaningless sex with him. But I don't know how, I fell for him. Must be the Chosen One charm, I reckon." The blond boy said as he put his head in his hands, sighing. He couldn't believe it, he was opening up to Jean Jacques.
Hence, I had to make it that this guy had a rare illness, so that he would always have the flask on his person.
"Don't make me laugh, Hermione." Harry scoffed. How could she proclaim him their 'best friend' after she had spent a whole month giving him the cold shoulder over something so futile.
Before drifting off to sleep, the Slytherin wondered how his new room mate had developed an obsession with him. Must have emerged from the Daily Prophet edition on the Harry-Draco scandal.
"I don't know how to feel about this, myself!" Hermione whined. "I mean, part of me has always wanted a baby... And I seem to be pretty good at taking care of people... But another part of me is terrified. I don't know if I'm too young... Or if Ron is fine with it. What if I scare him off like this?" She was definitely agitated and she started breathing heavily.
Draco, in particular, was looking forward to seeing his most beloved team play. He hadn't seen them in a while, so he didn't know who was in the team. He was excited to see who would play and if they were able to beat the former players.
She was very happy that her favourite people in the world were discovering her way of living - and liked it greatly.
They aimed upstairs, towards the Gryffindor common room. When they saw the fat lady, Harry blurted out "Lacuna!". She tried to argue against the presence of a Slytherin, but Harry shushed her before she could protest any further.
When Hermione went back to her seat, her boyfriend complimented her and then kissed her softly on the lips.
Luna held her breath as she leaned in, then, as their lips crashed together, she heard fireworks in her head.
He had to be a very apathetic person to create such a strain in a relationship and then leave to watch things unravel from a distance.
"Draco's only doing this to get back at me, because I didn't exactly treat him nicely." Said Harry, looking down at his plate.
It had felt so good and satisfying to excel in almost every subject each year, to always be the one speaking during lessons, to be the brightest witch of her age...
Harry couldn't believe the amount of butterflies that his boyfriend gave him, just by holding him close.
Ginny was the last one to congratulate her ex. She hugged him like a sister would, rubbing his back lightly. "Congratulations, you deserve this!"
"Given your love for potions," Harry explained, "I thought you'd like this miniature set, so that you could make any potion you like, wherever you go. Courtesy of George there."
Hermione noticed Ginny's uneasiness, so she turned to her. "Hey, Gin, it's ok. I'm not mad at you anymore. I can see that you regret what you did. And soon, Harry will come around."
However, Luna still noticed that her friend was a little too tense to only be worried about the NEWTs. She was constantly tapping her book with her quill, biting her lips and looking downright uneasy.
"Let me deal with it." Draco smirked. He got up and walked closer to the trio, focusing on Potter. So I can get close to him... Oh the way he moves those hips...That unkempt beard...
When Hermione had told him to go to the library, he hadn't done that right away. He had simply stayed hidden behind the door, using one of George's Extendable Ears.
"Wow, Draco's parents really love crashing celebrations, don't they?" Ron observed, shaking his head, showing a half a smile on his face.
"I hardly believe this, the four of us, together, at the same table, with no wands out." Ron said with a grin.
Draco was surprised at the way Goyle was talking to him. He never would have done it a year before. He wanted to threaten him, but he was far too distraught to do so. So, he ignored him.
"I feel the same." said Harry, as his eyes began to leak hot tears. He was now sure that the answer would have been positive.
Ginny and Luna were crying while holding each other, relieved that their friend's pregnancy had not been a disgrace, after all.
Ginny ignored the feeling of disgust at the mention of her brother and his girlfriend's search for a place to do their stuff in and focused on the fact that Hermione knew who the people occupying the room were. Could it be... "Luna, it was Harry! I'm sure of it! He was surely there with someone, the bastard!" She got up. "I might finally know who Harry cheated on me with! I need to go there... thank you Luna!" Ginny grabbed her friend's face and planted a kiss on her cheek, then she hurried out of the library.
Draco wasn't used to talking to someone that way, so he found it quite funny to see his boyfriend's face in a chimney.
"I'm the one that's throwing you, Potter!" He slowly put his hands on the other boy's chest, amused at his reaction to it.
The pain was unbearable. That's what you get for trusting Draco bleeding Malfoy so quickly, Harry thought to himself as he lay in his bed.
Draco had mixed emotions about it. Sure, meeting the players would have been an amazing thing, but the Seeker looked too much like the guy who had almost ruined his relationship with Harry.
"Ah well, I only did it so I'd get your attention... Always been a sucker for that." Draco said with a grin.
"What I did," Ginny continued, wiping her sweaty hands on her legs. "I know that there are no excuses, but I did it out of jealousy, anger... but mostly, I acted like a little girl. I wish I could take it all back, but here we are. I'm really, really sorry. I was a bitch and I ruined your lives... especially yours, Draco."
He would always find ways to make Harry miserable, as some sort of a 'vendetta' for refusing him. Harry was everything that he wanted to be.
"Ah..." Harry managed to say. Malfoy was now removing his jeans, just as slowly as he had done with the shirt. Then it was time to remove his boxers.
The four friends ended up spending the night laughing, playing muggle cards and watching the highly anticipated TV.
"Ah yes, Ginny and I knew about it, but it was supposed to be a surprise." Ron confessed, grinning from ear to ear.
"I did care about them. That's why I did all the things I did... to please them. But if he thinks I'm willing to go back to being daddy's servant, he's wrong." He said. His tears had dried on his face, but his eyes were still puffy and red.
Ginny thought that changing the subject would be a good idea, so she turned to Draco and Harry and asked them about their talk with Narcissa, as they had not been able to discuss it before.
"I doubt this will be better than the marvelous gift you received from Luna, but we, your friends, got you something very special." Said Harry, grinning and nodding at his husband.
"Well, now, we really need to get going." Harry said, as he sat up. "You coming?" He extended his hand for Draco to hold.
"Good on you, Potter." he spat. "What you're saying doesn't make any sense. Do you want me to kiss your feet because you invited me at the Weasleys for your own convenience? It's not like you offered to stay here with me. Because your little fake mummy would have taken offence. Cause who cares if sodding Malfoy gets offended, right?" He was now breathing heavily and crying out of frustration. "It's not like I am your boyfriend, or anything."
"Oh no, I wanted to talk about something else." Ron turned to face his sister. "You will have the chance to make amends with Harry and Malfoy, since he's spending Christmas with us."
In the heat of the moment, as everyone was fixed on Harry and Draco, no one seemed to notice Luna and Ginny's quick kiss, except for Molly, whose smile dropped as she did. Although, she chose to ignore it.
"Ok, Ok, I will!" Draco said, breathing heavily and with some tears in his eyes from the excessive amount of laughter.
They didn't know how long their kiss had lasted, but, as they broke it, they were both out of breath and gasping for air. "I guess this is what you wanted to tell me about." Draco smirked. Harry glared at him before grabbing his shirt and pushing him in a second, more passionate kiss. And in that moment, Draco's brain refused to work.
Harry turned around to face him. "Really? You've been caught and you continue with this lie? Wow, you've just won boyfriend of the year."said Harry, now visibly angry. "I heard Pansy talking about what happened the other night in your room." he explained.
The last thing I was missing was a name. I thought of the most French name there was and I chose Jean Jacques. It sounded perfect.
"Here we are!" said a puffing Hermione. She had changed her clothes and she was holding Ron's hand. "Happy Easter, everyone!"
"Harry, it's not so subtle that you and Malfoy are... exchanging... messages..." Hermione observed one day at Breakfast. Harry and Draco were sending each other looks and magic air kisses. They were not so evident, as the air kisses only took a second to arrive to the recipient. They were heart shaped, small, flying pink clouds that culminated in a soft "pop" upon reaching the target's lips.
Ginny screamed upon hearing her name. "Go, Gwen!" she yelled, then she laughed for the enormous amount of happiness that her presence gave her.
"If you say so." Luna shrugged. "Ah, it's so warm here, don't you think?" She said, removing her coat, revealing a low-cut purple dress, with a giant bright pink bow tied around her waist.
As Harry made his way to the Room of Requirement, he was more than certain that he would have refused to have a go at Malfoy's sexual games. "Ah, here you are, Potter!" His rival greeted him with a smile as he approached him.
"You aren't? Well, what do you call being with my sister, but at the same time having wet dreams about Malfoy? And don't deny it, I heard you say his name in your sleep!" he was speaking loudly now, risking to wake up the other three room mates. "Keep quiet, Ron...Look, I don't know what I feel for Ginny, ok?" There, he said it. "So you're using her? It'd make more sense if you broke up with her and told her that you're about as straight as Hermione's hair!"
Because the Burrow had five bedrooms, each couple was granted their privacy, at least for the first night.
Upon arriving in their new room, Jean Jacques had fallen asleep just by touching the bed, still dressed.
Harry and his best friend, Ron, were both waiting at the altar. They were one at its left, the other at its right side.
"Of course I would, but that doesn't mean you have to lie about it!" he said, angrily. "My boyfriend gets molested and keeps it a secret... how am I supposed to take this?"
"Ron, look, I..." Harry began, but his friend interrupted him. "I wouldn't care if you were gay, Harry, but if you are to fool my sister... this is where I'm not fine with it." His voice was stern, Harry had never heard his mate speak like this to him before. He must have been very angry.
"I will never forget you, Harry Potter. You've been a hero to me and reason why now I believe in myself." When he had said that, Harry had not been able to suppress a sob.
He also wondered how this guy had been sorted into Slytherin already, even before setting foot in Hogwarts. There was probably a way to do it from a distance, he thought.
How had he lived his entire life without trying it? There was nothing that tasted better, he was sure of it.
Harry noticed that, above their head, were beautiful colour-changing chandeliers that shifted from red to gold, to green, to silver.
"Oh, he's going crazy in there." said Harry, walking out of the dorm. "He keeps undressing and putting his suit back on because he says it doesn't look good on him!"
Breathing heavily, Harry detached himself from his dancing partner and walked to where Arthur was standing.
The sight was heartbreaking for Ron and Hermione. They watched as their new friend broke down in his boyfriend's arms because of his parents.
"We're on the same page, if it can make you feel better, mate." Ron whispered back, chuckling nervously.
"I know it's not been too long, but I'm in love with him, you know? I feel as close to him as can be, now, and I want to take advantage of this." He replied.
Once in Hermione's room, the girl cast muffliato so that the noise from the screaming letter wouldn't bother the other inhabitants of the house.
"Harry, what... Draco can't be here!" Hermione said in a worried tone. Harry completely ignored her. "Guys we have a problem!" He said.
They simply remained seated at the table, watching as Draco and his father fell apart, right in front of them.
"Your daughter," McGonagall began "should face expulsion, but we firmly believe in second chances. Therefore, she will only be punished with a year-long detention. She will be helping mr Filch with the cleaning of the castle."
As soon as Harry was done speaking, he noticed that Hermione was teary-eyed. Not that it was hard for her to become emotional, but he was glad that she'd reacted like that to his speech about how he felt for Draco.
Dirty Weasley girl, he should have known that she would try to sabotage them in a way. Why couldn't she just keep her nose out of other people's business? He began to think that the only purpose of her existence was to infuriate him.
Bill and Fleur came to visit one weekend, while George and Angelina stopped by for a day to announce the woman's pregnancy.
Harry sighed, looking up, trying to get the tears that were threatening to escape his his eyes to stay in place. "Oh, Luna. I miss him so much."
"I'm so nervous!" Draco said. He was going to spend the next two weeks of his life with the Weasleys, the very people he had treated like scum for years. He wasn't sure how to feel about that.
Draco chose to ignore it, though. It was probably that he was happy that his once fellow players had just gotten married. After all, George and the rest of the Weasleys were Harry's chosen family.
"Oh, I know, my love, I don't expect you to grant me forgiveness right away... But know that, even though I can't understand your liking for a male... I will support you through it. Even if it means the Malfoy name will not see its successors through you."
He saw that the other boy had his arms wrapped around him, which made him smile. Oh Potter, what have you done to me? You turned me into an emotional sap, he thought.
" I need to get the ring, but it's in Diagon Alley. To go there, I need to be granted permission and, since the headmistress isn't here, I was wondering if you could authorize my absence from school tomorrow. Also, if you confirmed to Draco and my friends that I'm at the ministry for Auror talk, I'd be grateful." he said.
"Come on, who cares if you suck at it, this is just so fun!" the Gryffindor said. He took Draco's hand back into his and skated all around the lake, clumsily making pirouettes and tricks, all while a stumbling Draco kept screaming, but he slowly turned his scream into a laugh.
"Oh, fuck!" the blond boy cried out, wrapping his legs around Harry's waist to push him deeper inside of him. "Don't stop."
On Friday night, he was in the Gryffindor Common room, having a chat with his friends. Luna was the other odd one out.
This Foreign Exchange guy, who was sitting next to me, had struck up a conversation. As we spoke, I was hit by his looks. He was dashingly attractive, he was European... he could have looked French and from Beauxbatons, his looks were possibly a match for Draco's liking... so, acting like I had dropped something, I took some of his hair from the floor and brought it here. This is when I made the potion. I didn't know when to act or how to do that, since I had to trick the teachers into believing that this guy was transferring from another school.
Draco didn't expect him to talk about him, so he gasped lightly as many pairs of eyes fixated on his figure. His face turned crimson red at the attention and flashed Harry an almost tear filled smile.
The theory would have made sense, if weren't for the fact that Mr Germain was male. And Lucius hated homosexuals.
Hermione looked more annoyed than ever. "Get lost, Malfoy. That isn't your tree and besides we can all fit there!"
Draco smiled through his tears, then he took his boyfriend's face in his hands. "I know."He breathed.
They would have done the countdown in the garden, as they were going to watch magic fireworks, courtesy of George.
Draco kept silent, still. Harry had a point. "I need you, Draco. Like you need me. Not just physically."
"Oh, no!" Ginny shut her eyes tight, waiting for Harry to do what he'd said he'd have done. "Will it hurt?"
A/N: Second to last chapter, y'all :( so sad that there's only one more, but everything comes to end.
"Why should I? This disgusting excuse of a human being has completely fooled my best friend! He hasn't changed, Hermione! He shouldn't have been trusted!" Ron growled.
Ginny clapped her hands, smiling, although she was a bit bummed that Gryffindor had ended up in the third place. At least, it wasn't the worst one.
"I'll go check on her before she runs into Pukey Boplnikes." Luna offered, then she got up and made her way to the girls' bathroom, leaving Ginny and her brother alone to wonder about Hermione's sudden sickness.
When the people in the room gathered around her to embrace her fondly, Ginny felt like the luckiest girl in the world.
Pansy grabbed the door by its handle and slowly pushed it open. She was not prepared for what she saw when she did: Draco, her longtime crush, had his arms wrapped around his so called rival, Harry Potter, and they were kissing passionately. The girl's mouth dropped open.
As the momentary euphoria of alcoholic beverages kicked in, all the people in the room joined forces to lift the couple in the air and having them crowd surf.
Pansy must have thought that the guy was just a random muggle, but, turned out, he was a Quidditch player, disguised as a foreign exchange student. He was probably just exploring the muggle world, just like the gang had done for Easter.
Your beauty and kindness made me want to befriend you. I thought that, maybe, you could help me keep the nargles and other beasts away. Now, I can say that you did. After many years of loving you silently, we finally merged together and became the super cute lesbians we are now.
Ginny giggled. Her girlfriend was truly a special snowflake, she was so pure and perfect and, well, hers. She was sure, now, that she had found the one.
So, I forged Madame Maxime's signature and sent an owl to the Headmistress, saying that, any minute, one of their students would be transferring to Hogwarts. The letter expressively said to put the new student into Slytherin, as, down in Beauxbatons, he was in the French version of that house.
"Yeah, sure, 'sleep'." Luna giggled. "Someone is eager to have sex." she said, in one of her famously uncomfortable truths.
"Mr Potter, from what I'd heard about you I thought you wouldn't be able to get a grade below Outstanding in this subject." The teacher shook her head. She looked very disappointed.
From a distance, the French Seeker didn't look familiar, but, with the touch of the Omnioculars he most certainly did.
"Maybe. But I'll admit that you might have a point. I know a place that is much better. I can show you the way." Draco whispered in his ear. Then, he licked his earlobe.
"Seeing them today warms my heart greatly. I honestly can't imagine them being separated. I think Angelina is perfect for George, their personalities merge together beautifully." He continued.
"Speak for yourself! Luna and I have one more year!" Ginny pouted. She wanted everyone to think that she wasn't in love with the idea of spending yet another year in that school, but the truth was that she was happy to come back in September. However, it would still hurt to study under the big tree without the gleeful company of her friends and her brother.
Miss Sivan involved a reluctant Mr Lovegood in a very sensual tango, her hair glitter hitting the man with each move.
"I thought you'd get this, out of all people! You're supposed to be my best friend! And it's not like we're dating or anything." Harry said. Was it really so hard to understand that he was just exploring?
Ginny pulled away from her girlfriend, then she summoned a knife and began slicing the pastry the way her sister in law instructed.
When the Hogwarts Express arrived in King's Cross, the two couples were among the first people to get off the train. But they couldn't go to the Burrow just yet, as they were supposed to apparate there and Luna and Ginny, being sixth years, couldn't do it on their own.
"I'll go." Ron offered. He then got up and went straight to his room. He came back right away holding a piece of parchment, that he handed to Harry.
Going to Herbology was hard as ever. It took students several minutes to get through all that snowy path. Neville even fell once, finding himself sinking into the snow. But he would never miss an Herbology lesson, so he got up and went anyway. When he got to the greenhouse, he was shivering so much that Professor Sprout had to send him straight to the Hospital Wing.
"Twenty points each from the four of you!" said Miss Sivan. "And go back to work, you two." She said, addressing Draco and Harry.
"...and the spectrespecs are the only mechanism known to man that makes you see the Wrackspurts." Luna concluded, although she noticed how Ginny had been staring at her.
"Like hell you are! I mean, why do you even have to lock yourself in?" Draco groaned in frustration.
"Baby girl," she started. " Will you please honour me with the details on what on Earth these nargles are?"
"I'm not defending him! It was just a supposition. But don't worry, I would never cheat on you. Hell, I even used Protego on my bed so that he wouldn't be able to replicate his action."said Draco. He was starting to lose his temper.
Harry knew that she wasn't exactly genuine, given her abilities to lie to powerful legilimens, but he chose not to interfere with his lover's happiness.
It was definitely a girl, as the voice suggested. It was slow and a bit dreamy. There was no more doubt as to who that was when Harry heard the words "crumple horned snorkacks".
"You were right, I'm sorry that I didn't see it right away. " said Draco, swallowing a lump in his throat.
Harry was now certain that he had been honest and what he had told him was the most beautiful thing someone had ever said to him.
The real Ginny took it and looked at it. She couldn't stop smiling, so much so that her face cramped.
"I know, Mione," said a smiling Harry. "It's just, I can't really help it... It's hard for me to hide how crazy I am for him." He finished, blushing a little.
"Quaffle in the hands of Miss Weasley-- Seeker Potter of Gryffindor has seen the Snitch, he's flying his way to it - Slytherin has now gained the quaffle... Slytherin about to score... Keeper Ronald Weasley stops it!" Miss Sivan was saying, while watching the game in awe. Her hair was tied in two very fairy-like buns, but it still spilled glitter.
"Did you take a picture of us with that camera?" Harry asked, getting up to get closer to Ginny, who nodded with a smirk.
"Guys!" Harry shouted, running towards his friends. They were both sitting on the sofa next to the fireplace and they were all cuddled up to each other.
Oh dear Merlin and any other wizard. Was his lunatic of a boyfriend going to dance on the damned lake with these ridiculous muggle shoes?
Meanwhile, Jean Jacques Germain, the person who had caused all of this shit, was nowhere to be found. It was like he had vanished in the air.
"You just try and you're dead, Pansy." He finally spoke, although the thought of his father knowing this terrified him quite.
Draco giggled, all while putting his arms around his neck. "You're so cute when you get all fired up about your hair. I like it untamed, it's kind of hot." He said.
He shuddered as Malfoy continued talking. "Well, what can I say? I hate you, Potter, I really do... But damn me, and much as I hate myself for this... I can't stop thinking of fucking your brains out." Draco said in a raspy voice. His eyes were darkening by the second and that was too much for Harry to handle. "Draco... Screw you." He said as he attacked his lips with his own. The kiss felt exactly like it did in his dream. It was all kinds of good. Maybe it was a bit more raw than what he had imagined, but still. Draco was now tugging at his tie, making the kiss even hotter, if that was even possible.
As Hermione and her mum sat on the chairs, the daughter noticed someone she knew sitting three seats from her.
Ginny's heart began to race uncontrollably, she felt warmth creeping up her whole body as Luna's mouth attacked her neck deliciously.
"Yeah, a bit um.. aghast, but I'm fine. All thanks to Harry, I guess." said Draco, smiling at the other boy, who didn't return the smile, though.
Draco was now extremely creeped out by him. He noticed that his room mate was wearing only boxers, nothing else.
On the other hand, he was far from a reconciliation with Hermione. She knew of his 'Malfoy Escapades' and she wasn't in any way willing to accept them. She felt as if she had been betrayed.
"Oh, shed a tear there!" Miss Sivan commented, wiping a tear. Even that gesture was a graceful movement. "So, without further do, do you, Ronald Weasley, take Hermione Jean Granger as your lawfully wedded wife? While, do you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, take Harry James Potter as your lawfully wedded husband?"
This was different than their first kiss, this one was filled with want, encircled in a ring of exploding fire.
He had chosen an emerald embezzled ring for a particular reason; he wanted Draco to be reminded of his eyes every time he took a glance at it.
"No, no!" Draco cried. "You!" He had the most disgusted look on his face. He was determined to hurt those two foul women, so he tried to run after Ginny but Harry grabbed him by his robe.
"I could have lost you!" The Gryffindor weeped, looking up and swallowing a lump in his throat to keep from bawling.
Then, the rest of the gang said hi to him as well, except Ginny and Luna, who were in their own little world, giggling and being cute.
Draco was glad that he was now spending little to no time in the Slytherin common room, for it was always so cold in the winter, due to it being located in the dungeons.
"Oh, I have yours, too." Draco said, then he summoned a package. It was quite big, but harry couldn't make out what it looked like.
"I l-love y-you." Pansy said in a hiccup of sobs. "And I-I u-understand that... we will never b-be t-togeth-her."
George wrapped an arm around his new wife, pulling her closer as his friend delivered such beautiful words.
Then Draco broke the kiss, licking his way to Harry's neck. "Oh..." Harry whispered. It felt so good, better than anything with Ginny had ever felt. The taller boy hummed as he sucked on his neck, thus making him even more aroused. Draco was now unbuttoning his shirt, so painfully slow, Harry observed. He then removed it and traced his body with his hands, from the neck to the lining of his pants.
And, since all three of them were too tired to apparate, they thought it would be best to wait until the morning after.
Mrs Weasley gave her half a smile, an eyebrow raised. "Oh, I don't mean that." she said, looking from Ginny to Luna, then back to her daughter.
"Ha, ha... so funny, Malfoy!" said Hermione, annoyed. She then reached down to help Harry up. "Come on, boys," she said to both Harry and Ron. "Let's go somewhere else, it isn't worth it."
"Remember that in relationships, both participants have to be on ze same level." Jean Jacques said, putting his hand on Draco's nodded, but he didn't say a word.
"Ah yeah, he would definitely pull an amazing prank on us, straight from his joke shop." Ginny chuckled, putting her head on her brother's shoulder.
Hermione and Ron gave a 'woo' at the sight of that PDA, Draco was not afraid to show his love for Harry anymore. Hermione put her hands on her chest, feeling proud.
And so Harry did, by the evening of the day after he had his ring, safely hidden under the invisibilitycloak in his room.
Draco raised an eyebrow. When Harry was convinced on something, he wouldn't stop until he got what he wanted. But he was starting to abuse this power he possessed.
Harry sighed, then he put a hand on Draco's thigh. "A relationship is not just happy moments, Draco. It's getting through things together."
"What was that all about?" Draco asked, as he came into the room. Harry was already in his bed, facing the wall.
But what made her sick to her stomach was the fact that Ron, her brother, knew of this, apparently. How could he have done such thing to his own sister?
His boyfriend grinned at him, then he brushed his face with his thumb and kissed him softly. "I love you, too."
"You are my favourite thing about Hogwarts, too." The blond declared. There was nothing truer than that, he was sure of it.
Ron captured the guests' attention by hitting a bottle of butterbeer with his wand, producing a clink.
The girl scoffed. It was true, though. She wasn't willing to change her mind on Draco, and she wasn't even trying. "I'm just looking out for myself and you! You're such a fool, Harry! Do you really want to ruin a friendship because of that piece of trash? So much for being a Gryffindor! You should have ended up in Slytherin!" It was Harry's turn to scoff. Ron didn't know what to do, he was going a little crazy as he couldn't keep up with all their fighting. "You know damn well that I need this to know who I am! And it's merely physical!" Harry shouted. Now Ron was done. "What the hell is going on?" He finally snapped. The two seemingly ex friends stopped their ruckus and looked at him. They were both panting. "Our 'friend' here has been shagging none other than Draco Malfoy! And he's taking this so lightly!" Hermione said in a bitter tone, puffing a little. Ron's eyes widened. "What? You said you wouldn't!" He was angry. Of course he was, Harry thought. He had to agree with his girlfriend if he didn't want trouble with her. Grow a mind of your own, mate.
"Ginny," Hermione interrupted her. "I don't know if you know this, but Draco's family has just disowned him, because of you. So, if I were you, I wouldn't show my face around here."
"WHAT?" Ron almost shouted. A few heads turned to see what had just happened, but then went back to their businesses when they didn't see anything weird. Ron blushed at the attention he had just received. Hermione elbowed her boyfriend in the ribs. "Well this is quite a bit for us to process, Harry." Hermione said, glaring at a now wincing Ron.
Harry had never made her feel like that just by kissing her on the neck. Now she was sure that she didn't like boys, at all.
It was just too precious to see her girlfriend so happy and thrilled about going to see her beloved team play and this happiness was a consequence of Luna's actions.
That was not quite what Draco expected. The Weasleys weren't so fond of him, to say the least. Arthur Weasley had his fair share of discrepancies with Lucius, so he didn't think that he would have welcomed him into his home with open arms.
The two teams flew to the center of the field, the visual effect was mesmerizing as their colours merged, creating a flash of pink and green light.
He could say that he was ecstatic at the idea of being a father and wondered how it was that his girlfriend's friends didn't think he would have had that reaction.
Harry was the one to put his head in it with some floo powder, so that Draco saw him in the fireplace of the Slytherin common room.
"There's nothing going on! He's the one who kissed me! I don't care about him!" Draco said. He was freezing, so his teeth rattled a bit.
"I don't mean to interrupt a moment but... Harry, what are your intentions regarding the Quidditch team?" After all, they were missing a chaser, now.
The same set of golden chairs was used, they were placed in front of many round tables, all covered by golden silky cloths.
Hermione's parents held hands as their little girl became someone's wife. They had been skeptical at first, regarding her now husband, but, seeing their daughter so happy, they finally accepted their union completely.
Turns out, Arthur had gone to fetch George and Angelina in Diagon Alley, but they were stuck inside Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, due to the snow.
"Because you're afraid. But you shouldn't care. Fear is what turned you into a death eater in the first place. You have to react! I'm almost giving up a friendship for this, because I want to be with you! I always felt something strange for you... now I know that there was a lot more behind our rivalry ."
"Hey, who said we won't have some fun later? It will be a cool way to slither into the New Year." Harry said, getting up.
He would do anything for him, but only if he followed the path that was already established for him.
"You could have tried to at least send me a sign of you still being my mother! Yet you gave me the cold shoulder." Draco snapped.
"Hermione's fault this time." Ron said, defending himself. "She didn't know what to wear. Girls, right?" He shook his head.
He didn't think he deserved to be loved so much. He wondered what he had done to have the most amazing people in the world as his friends and lover.
Right after dinner, Mrs Weasley pulled out a heavy, old set of Wizard's Chess out of a box. As she placed it on the table, it blew dust everywhere.
It was a girl who was sitting next to a guy she apparently found attractive, as she would smile at him and play with her hair from time to time.
Ok now Harry wasn't so sure that he was just exploring. "I could end this right now, but I like him!" He shouted.
The two last year couples spent their afternoon trying to study in the library, as their top spot was occupied, this time, by Blaise and his posse.
He had first set foot in it blindfolded by Harry's hands. Once the other boy had taken his hands off his eyes, the former Slytherin's mouth had dropped very low.
Luna had only flown from time to time, like for the lessons with Madam Hooch or during Christmas time in the Weasley household, but she wouldn't do it that often.
"Father?" said Draco, stunned. His eyes widened in terror and his whole body froze at the sight of that man.
"You mean, like a surprise for the bride and groom to be?" the woman asked, dipping her quill in the ink.
Here went his promise of avoiding usage of cute pet names. He had to admit, though, that these names were not so puke-inducing, once he was the one being in love.
"Dark Magic!" Hermione exclaimed. "How can they say something like this about homosexuality?" she continued. She was appalled, to say the least.
"Not many days ago, when I tried to speak to you near the Room of Requirement, I had been there long enough to hear you two talk about how you had used that room for your dirty doings..."Ginny explained. "And I just thought that Parkinson could be interested in knowing this, too. I knew I'd find you here. Very unwise of you not to use the invisibility cloak, Harry." She finished, pointing at the camera in her hand.
Then, they plunged themselves into each other, diving into the most passionate kiss they had ever shared.
"You just control yourself ok? Don't want Ginny to be hurt... think of how Ron would react..." Hermione warned Harry, who just acted vaguely in response.
"Ginny," Harry said. "I swear to you, I never cheated on you. I got with Draco after our relationship had ended." He took her hand into his. Ginny looked at the hand and sighed.
"Ill take that as a yes." Said Molly. "Ah-ha, I told your father, but he didn't think this was possible! Once again I was right!"
"You little git! How dare you speak to my friend like that? If you don't stop, I'll throw you in the lake!"
Harry wasn't able to contain himself anymore, so he rose to his feet and went to stand next to his boyfriend.
Life had given him a second chance. It had granted him with a mountain of love and affection, only to later have it crumble right before his eyes.
"Worry not, you will see her soon. Why spoil New Year's? When you meet again, you will have a lot of cool stories to tell." Draco reassured, giving him a comforting smile.
She stopped speaking for a moment when she noticed that Draco was wearing a Gryffindor scarf while Harry was wearing a Slytherin one.
That afternoon, in the Gryffindor common room, Ginny was sitting by herself, scribbling on a piece of parchment.
"No, Luna... It was my fault, I was angry and hurt... but I shouldn't have done that. Or involve Parkinson into it." The redhead said.
"These, my love, are ice skates." Harry explained. Then, he made another chair appear, sat on it and gave himself a pair of skates as well. "These are used to skate. It's kind of like dancing, but on ice." He concluded, smirking.
That night Harry went to the Room of Requirement as he'd done those past nights. As soon as he and Malfoy entered the room, the blonde boy was already trying to remove his clothes. Harry stopped him. "Wait, I don't know if I feel like it tonight." He said, looking down. Draco looked at him with widened eyes. "Don't tell me you're still thinking of Weasley?"
"Now, when you soar, your first thought must be balance." the Gryffindor said, rising up in the air. "Just concentrate on a fixed point in the air. Watch." that said, she sped towards one of the rings, looking right ahead of her, not daring to shift her glance.
Also, for Luna's birthday in February, Ginny had kissed her on the cheek and given her flowers. And on Valentine's day they had gone to Madam Puddifoot's, instead of spending the day with their friends at the Three Broomsticks.
"Hermione Granger," Ron began, while taking his bride's hands into his "When I met you, I thought you were an obnoxious little know-it-all. Like, I really couldn't stand you! But then, years later, I finally realised that I was in love with that know-it-all."
"I can't believe this is our last day." he sighed after drying his hair with a movement of his wand.
The Gryffindor girl couldn't repress a laugh. "Oh, Luna, you're a funny one. It's impossible for you to be pregnant if you're having intercourse with a girl."
"No, Ron, I don't need distractions... I have to study... And you should too. Tell you what, you go to the library to save our seats, I'll  meet you there in a bit, ok? Then we can finish the Potions assignment before our class starts."
Hermione was the next one to speak. "Ginny, my partner in crime for our pranks on your bro here and my favourite sister-in-law, you are truly a blessing to this world. I love you so, so much and I hope the best for you in your life to come! I know you will do great things. I'm so lucky to have you by my side."
"Malfoy, can you believe it, Luna!" Ginny said to her friend, that same day. They were walking to Herbology, that they both had in common. "From what I know, they're pretending to hate each other still. I don't understand how he can just... be with him, you know?"
She didn't know how to react, although the fact that her boyfriend was calling her his 'one true love' couldn't be a bad sign.
Most of them had agreed to it, but Ginny and Luna had already made arrangements to spend it in Luna's house. Xenophilius had invited Ginny as he saw her as 'his daughter's most personal friend'.
On August 28th, after weeks spent going to beaches and local pubs, it was time to take the train to Paris, where the wedding would have taken place on that same day.
"Fuck you, Malfoy!" Harry yelled at the blonde boy. All Draco did in response was smile. Yeah, Potter, Fuck me, was Draco's thought.
Their eyes were locked, their breaths uneven, as the feeling of excitement towards exploring new territories pervaded them.
Harry took off Draco's shirt and began kissing his way down on his body until he reached the hem of his pants. Shortly after, he removed them, with trembling hands, leaving him in nothing but his boxers.
"Well,we will leave you to it." said Hermione, then she grabbed Ron's hand and together they left for Hogwarts.
Ginny breathed a sigh of relief. It was not that appealing, but at least it was better than being expelled.
Now Ron was more confused than ever. "Guys-" he tried to say, but the other two kept interrupting him. "If you're not fine with it, then it's your problem! You're too busy criticizing and judging that you don't see that people do change!"
The barman and the customers all screamed and tried to chase it out of the room, but it wouldn't do it before delivering mail to the rightful recipient.
This was their best kiss so far, Harry thought. It was sweet, soft, but also full of love. It was their first kiss as a married couple, so it was, by far, their most special one.
When midnight came, Draco debated using the floo powder to transport himself in the Gryffindor common room, since the new guy hadn't come yet.
Draco would be wearing a dark green suit, which symbolised both him having been a Slytherin and his future husband's eye colour.
"You're joking, right? I risked falling on this stupid ice, I look like a freaking monkey with this walk and I'm afraid we'll drown into the freezing waters of the lake!" Draco whined, this only made Harry laugh more. "What's so funny about this?" The blond boy asked in a semi-infuriated tone.
"Ah, fuck it." said Draco, turning around to face his boyfriend. "Who cares what they say? All that matters is we're together." He then offered his forearm for him to hold.
"Oh I don't know if she told you, but... Luna is coming too, for Christmas. Dad's invited Xenophilius."
"Oh, that's our cue. Let's go back to the altar, guys!" said Hermione, letting go of Draco's face. She grabbed her dress and walked towards where Ron was standing. She turned around to motion for her friends to follow her.
Almost eight years before, Draco had been denied a friendship with the famous 'boy who lived', only to make friends with people he considered 'unworthy', at the time.
Harry wanted to look perfect for the occasion of the day, so he also proceeded to pluck his eyebrows.
Her parents knew that already, so, of course, they didn't act too surprised. But they were happy to become grandparents so they cheered for her.
Draco had to sit in order to process the news. "So, now, everyone in the Wizarding World knows?" he asked Hermione, who nodded.
"Oh Merlin...He's gone nuts. If Draco says no, it's the end of our best friend." Ron expressed, feeling anxious. He grabbed his girlfriend's hand in hope.
As soon as she saw her granddaughter, the old lady trotted to her happily. "Ah, my dear! You've gotten so beautiful." she said, wrapping her into a tight hug.
As the last remaining weeks of Hogwarts life passed, Hermione's secret was kept safe among her friends. Ron had no idea about it and resigned from looking more into his girlfriend's strange behaviour- he simply blamed it on school matters- or, at least, so it seemed.
"I have to apologise for my Mother-in-Law, She has a bit of senile dementia... i hope you're not too uncomfortable at hiding your magical aspects." said Laura, giving Harry the cutlery to put on the table.
A/N: yeah, I know, not much drarry in this episode. But I pinky swear that next chapters will make up for it, my loves.
Luna had recently got a new family member, Miss Sivan had become her father's girlfriend, so she had moved in with the Lovegoods.
As Harry held his husband close, he could have sworn that had never known this level of delight in his life before.
"We are gathered here for yet another wedding - wow, I must say, this is turning into a trend." the woman joked, earing a laugh from many guests. " On the left here we have Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, while on our right we can admire Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger."
Draco wondered why he'd asked him that question, but he didn't want to mind it too much, he was too tired to care. Maybe Jean Jaques' only purpose in life was to annoy people when he was too bored to sleep. Either way, it was too late at night for this shit.
Both girls were finally relieved that they were fine and that the nightmare was put to an end before anyone got seriously hurt.
"Honestly, why should you care now? You've been fine all these months, now all of a sudden you get sad. Screw them Draco, you're here with me, with your friends, why should you give them so much thought?" Harry asked.
He was sipping his butterbeer alongside Jean Jacques, who was drinking something the three friends had never seen before. They were laughing, as Jean Jaques seemed to be teaching French to the other boy, who looked like he was failing at the job.
The french guy smiled widely. "Oh, Oui! I come here late, straight from an 'otel. I spent troi days there... "he explained.
"Ah, Gin Gin, I'm super fine. I worried about you, too. I feared you were dead and the Gordonds of Death were coming for you!" Luna muttered.
That afternoon, during the Quidditch practice, the team was beginning to question their captain's absence. Ginny, in particular.
"And besides, I don't think Ron and Mione are going to murder us if we're two minutes late!" Said Harry while unlocking the door.
But now that she was alone, doing her homework, she couldn't help thinking about how awkward Christmas would have been.
In the nights I spent with Draco, I had to sleep with my whole body covered by the duvet, as I would go back to my true form while asleep. Also, I would wake up so early because I had to rush into my actual dorm. It was the only way I had to see Draco in the morning and hear everything he had to say about the obnoxious new roommate.
He had the impression that it would fall apart any minute, as the floor creaked after he stepped foot on it, but it surely felt warmer than his enormous Manor.
"Friends, Loved ones..." Miss Sivan began in her tinkling voice. As she spoke, glitter fell on her shoulders. "We are gathered here to witness the marriage of George and Angelina..."
"Oh nice to meet you! Such good looking lads! My name is Rosemary Granger." Rosemary said. Her eyes lit up at she saw those two boys. By the looks of it, she found younger men attractive.
"I know... I'm sorry..." he replied, looking down at his feet. The look the other boy gave him cut through him so violently that he had to look away, in order not to be burned by that look that he hated. He knew he deserved it, but it still hurt him to an extent.
He gasped at the sight of Draco. He was standing with the frame in his hands and he had a fading black eye. He suddenly felt a strong sense of worry inside of him. How had he hurt himself like that?
"I'm a what? A nincompoop? Where did you learn this word?" said Harry, nearly falling from Draco's lap.
Harry glared at him. "You're too funny, Ronald. Ugh, my hair isn't even the worst part of this! I'm going to throw up, I know, I'll fuck up the whole thing and Draco will run away!" he said, sitting on the bed and then putting his head in his hands.
Ginny took her friend's hands into hers. "Mione, steady your breaths, ok? If you're this distressed, you might harm the baby." She tried to calm her down.
Luna emerged from the kitchen to walk towards her friends, little Hugo still in her arms, playing with her anti-nargle chain.
He wasn't sure if he knew, but, given the Wizarding World being small, he wouldn't have been surprised had the news spread overseas.
He glared him so intensely that if someone had been in the middle of them, they would have been badly charred.
"Oh Merlin!" she screamed, throwing the object on the table. She covered her mouth with her hands and her eyes widened in surprise.
"Um... Harry?" Ron awkwardly called to his best friend, thus having them break the kiss. Ginny and Harry broke apart, blushing a little. Ginny was the most embarrassed one, though.
They had made history in Hogwarts, not only by being the first openly gay couple in school, but also by opening people's minds.
Luna stopped torturing her neck to give her a lust-filled look. Her pearly eyes were almost fully black with desire.
"Uh-oh, are you telling me that you're willing to lie to Potter so that he won't harm Jean Jacques?" said Pansy, gasping slightly.
Luna was wearing them wrong, so she saw the players even farther than they were. "Wow, why are they so far from us?" She asked naively.
Ginny gave her a dirty look. "Well, Thanks for reminding me... Oh,I really want them to pay. Here's what I'm going to do..." The Weasley girl said as they were entering the greenhouse.
One day, she would have definitely done that. But, at that moment she felt too young for that big step.
"No!" Ginny shouted, then she pulled her hand out of Harry's grasp. "Pansy! Lift the camera up in the air!"
Harry wanted to wipe that smile off that stupid face so badly. But he had to admit that this teasing was not so bad. "Look who's talking!"He simply said.
"Don't call me that." Hermione said in a furious tone and rushed out of the room, leaving Harry there. Was Malfoy really worth losing his best friend over?
Harry wasn't sure about how he should have reacted. It was shocking, but at the same time he didn't know if his friend was happy about it. Judging from her expression, however, she didn't look like she was on cloud nine.
Took him long enough. Ah, his day just kept getting better and better. He wanted to smirk, but decided to play along a little. "Oh come on Potter, did you really think I'd kiss you?" He gave him his best impression of a disgusted face and walked closer to him. He now felt his rival's shaky breath on his face and he loved just the effect he had produced.
Harry hesitated, but then thought that, since he had taken the veritaserum, he wouldn't be able to lie, so he nodded.
Suddenly, the fire crackled and her lips curved into a wide smile as she saw her interlocutor, the shadow of the flames reflected on her face.
Draco was very amused. He had totally fooled Potter into thinking that he would have kissed him... oh, that poor naive soul. At least now he had it, the confirmation that he was totally into him as well, despite him being with Weasley.
"Ok, Harry. But only one minute." The half giant nodded, then he left to say goodbye to some other students.
"She knows? How? Oh God, she's not gonna tell on us, is she?" The pale boy was now panicking. "Oh she saw us once... she's not gonna tell anyone, don't worry. It's just... She's getting under my skin!" Harry let out a frustrated sigh.
"You know nothing!"Harry said, in a rage. Now, this moron was crossing a line. He rose to his feet, ready to fight the douche.
"You never spoil anything. We are not going until you tell me what's bothering you." Harry said with crossed arms. He proceeded to sit next to him and give him a look.
"Well, you could make an effort. Ah famous people, always acting superiorre." said the newbie, looking Harry straight in the eye.
The green eyed boy gasped a bit. "What?" Draco asked. He turned his head to see if anything was off throughout the room. "You just called me Harry! Oh God!"
"Oh, here they are!" said Molly, as she ran towards the children with open arms and the brightest smile Draco had ever seen.
"Oh, come on!" Harry said, putting his arms around his lover's neck. "You know that my biggest crush was you."
"Out of the way, Potter!" Draco spat jokingly, placing himself in front of him, thus cutting him off.
She got just the effect she had intended to receive, as every student was done clapping and shouting.
Harry noticed that his boyfriend was sweating, but he was proud of him for standing up to his father that way.
"But I'm its rightful owner, as I touched it first." Ginny smirked as the blonde kept pulling the egg to herself.
Ron and Hermione, who had not said anything yet (though they had been clapping), congratulated the pair on their courage. "Thanks." Draco responded. "Although...could I sit with you Gryffindors?" He timidly asked.
"We need to study! Or we'll get a horrible mark in our NEWTs. What are you... are you checking out Weasley?" Blaise asked, with a hint of laugh in his voice.
"Do you mind helping me finish with the table?" The woman asked, panting slightly. "It's really a toll."
There were so many excited people that it was almost impossible not to get lost in the screaming crowd. Not to mention, it contributed to the August heat's worsening.
"Oh shit!" Draco exclaimed. He turned to Harry, hoping he had his invisibility cloak with him. "Quick, get that damned cloak of yours!" he ordered.
This was because they were perfect for each other, their complicity was made possible by their differences, which accentuated their similarities, thus making them two halves of a heart.
"Your choice of boys is.. peculiar, to say the least." Her mother expressed. Her lips were pursed, suggesting a minor disapproval regarding Ron.
Draco couldn't believe it. He had trusted Pansy. He had forgiven her for ruining his life and she had not been honest about it. Her tear filled apology had just been for show. He should have known.
"How dare you speak in such an obscene manner? These people are not your people, Draco. They must have put a spell on you or something, because I can't recognise you!" Said Lucius, walking closer to his son. He looked downright sickened.
"I hope so," Harry sighed, "I feel like shit after how I treated him... He's right, for some things..."
"What are you saying? This is just brainwashing that this dirty homosexual performed! If you do not intend to drop this act, I will disown you." The oldest of the Malfoys in the room threatened.
Ginny had learnt, as she grew, that nothing in life was ever a guarantee, so she figured it would make sense to try something new and leaving her fear behind.
"Please, listen to me." Ginny pleaded. She was fidgeting with her hands, apparently from the nervousness.
Harry was ready to fight her, but Draco stopped him. If Harry wasn't in anyway inclined to forgive her and Ginny, Draco didn't have the same idea. He wanted to hear what she had to say.
Harry shook his head. "No, it's just.. Hermione found out about us... and she's giving me shit for it."
When he'd first set foot in Hogwarts, around eight years before, he was delighted to begin this new adventure. He'd had fun, during his first year. He'd met his best friends for life and had finally been able to experience the things that his brothers spoke so fondly of. He had also risked his life a couple times, once with a three-headed dog, once with a Devil's Snare... and his experience with Norbert wasn't too jolly. But, in the end, it had been an adventure.
Harry was on top of Draco, his head rested on his chest, while the other boy softly caressed his head, playing with his unkempt hair.
A/N: So, yeah, this story (sadly) comes to an end. I had a blast writing it, I spent entire days on some of the chapters and I really hope it was worth it.
Additionally, it was strange to see that girl, as, in Ginny's room, a poster of her would often seem to stare at the two girls while they were having intimate moments.
She tasted so, so good, even better than she had imagined. With every flick of her tongue, she brought Ginny to beautiful places.
The woman and her son were going on about memories and happy times, when Narcissa mentioned the wedding ceremony.
Sometimes, when she and Luna would go study under the big tree, she would turn around, laughing, thinking that she was addressing one of her friends.
Draco laughed. "Oh yeah, sure, you really can't lie, Potty." The taller boy shook his head and then moved closer to him and put his arms around his neck, this time. "Let's see if you hate it so much." And then he kissed him. Harry's eyes widened, he was surprised. After a few seconds he let himself go and dived into the kiss, too. It felt so good, so right... But it's Malfoy! The voice in his head said. But he didn't want to care, he just wanted to feel those lips on his.
While Harry and Draco were out with Draco's mum, the remaining four of the group were under their favourite tree, preparing themselves for the impending exams.
A woman, who must have been the French Minister, was sitting next to a flamboyant looking man, who was dressed in a purple suit. He had a fuchsia feather boa around his neck-everyone identified him as head of Magical Games.
"And do you, Angelina Johnson, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and health, in good times and woe, for richer or poorer, keeping yourself solely unto him for as long as you both shall live?"
"Oh right, shoot, almost forgot." said Harry, flicking his wand. Then, a present appeared. "My present for you."
"I don't understand..." The Gryffindor said as the Slytherin sat on his bed next to him, after he put the picture back in its place.
As the other girl made her way to the DADA office, she had the confirmation that they were going to see something about Draco and Potter, since she knew that they'd be there for remedial lessons.
When I saw the disgustingly cute couple out and about in Hogsmeade, wearing each other's scarf, I thought it was just the right time. In a fervent jealousy, I approached you and I pulled my most regretful face - the crying bit was the easiest. I also made myself a tad bit goofy and cute - I knew Draco wouldn't have been able to resist me. So, after he forgave me, I had to come up with a plan to destroy the happy couple. My initial idea was to brew a love potion, but I couldn't get my hands on one, no matter how hard I tried. So, I moved on to plan B, brewing the polyjuice potion to become Potter. But, on New Year's Eve, in a muggle hair salon, a better opportunity presented itself.
Adrian Martin had dark hair, a pointy nose and a large jaw. His protective specs covered his face but they didn't completely hide it. Draco and Harry recognized him right away.
"You wish, baby." Harry said with a wink, then he flew around him and continued going his way. "I'll get it."
Both Harry and Hermione had talked about it dreamily, so Ron and Draco were having high hopes on the dish.
Ever since their reconciliation in December, Draco and Pansy found themselves closer than ever. They would often talk about their problems with the other, seemingly repairing their eight year old friendship.
Ginny's hearing had been temporarily lessened, Hermione had told her that it would pass, but still, she'd had a mild panic attack.
Draco had almost thrown up when the aircraft had taken off and he had been scared out of his mind with the turbulences and the fact that he had never been this high in the sky, not even in the Quidditch Pitch.
Harry was smiling uncontrollably, happy to have finally filled the void that Draco's absence had brought.
"What you looking at, Draco?" Said Pansy, as she noticed that her friend was looking directly at the Gryffindor table.
"Did you find a way to fight crumple horned snorkacks?" Xenophilius asked his daughter, after he put her down.
The boy stopped to think for a moment. He was young, he would have been nineteen soon, but then again it didn't mean they had to marry straight away.
"Oh, he's just at this Defence Against the Dark Arts remedial lesson with Sivan." He responded absent-mindedly.
"Mmm, if you say so." Harry muttered. He suddenly looked upset. It wasn't like Harry to be like this, not around his friends and boyfriend.
He should have just left him in the fire. Now, he would be dead and Harry wouldn't be in this much pain over him.
Great, now Harry was trying to guilt trip him into feeling ungrateful. Was he for real? He had been the one making the effort, not Harry, nor the Weasleys. He had been the one to suck it up and face people who disliked him, just to spend the Holidays with his boyfriend.
"But I don't want you here, you little mudblood." The pale boy said. He was sure that the word "mudblood" was what it took to push Potter's buttons. And so, it did.
True, they had not been together for a long time, but it was proven to him, in many occasions, that they were soulmates.
Ginny reached the seventh floor and hid behind a wall as soon as she heard footsteps approaching. She couldn't believe it when she heard Draco Malfoy's voice.
The had upcoming exams, too, but theirs were simple, routine ones, so they thought it wouldn't hurt them to lighten the load a little.
"And I'm sorry I called you an evil loathsome little cockroach..." Hermione said."I hope this means we can be friends now."
"Ahh that's going to be great! I can hardly wait!" Harry said, excitedly. Then, he kissed his boyfriend on the cheek. "You will see, it will be so much fun! Molly always makes us those ugly jumpers for Christmas!"
"Yeah then you went to get confused with Harry, who is literally, the gayest wizard ever." Luna observed.
"Ah, Draco how could I leave you behind? Congratulations! I couldn't be happier for you! You're both in good hands." she told him, while resting her chin on his shoulder.
Draco sank his body into the bubbly water and suddenly felt all the tension he had built up fade. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the border of the tub.
What he said was true, the last time they had kept things from each other, they ended up not speaking for a week.
"So, when I met you I never would have dreamed to be in a relationship with you. I felt a strong sense of dislike for you, but then as time went on I realized that what I felt for you was a strong attraction that I tried to conceal with hate.
Draco was assaulted by Luna's bone crushing hug. "Now you have to keep the Nargles away from him, till death do you part!" The girl squeaked as Draco giggled.
This was it, Ginny was about to lose her virginity. Now, she knew why she had never been intimate with any of her boyfriends. They just didn't have this effect on her.
"Tell you what, if my brother ever tries to leave you, I will kick his nuts!" The redhead reassured.
Draco's blood went cold. It felt as if his world had stopped spinning. There was nothing he could do, now. His heart was beating so fast that he couldn't hear anything else. He felt like he was going to throw up.
Pansy raised her eyebrow. What if that gingerbread girl was referring to Draco? "Wait, what do I need to see?"
She said goodbye to Harry by lightly pecking him on the lips. "See you at dinner, babe. I love you." She said with a smile. "Love you Ron and Mione!" Then she left to go to the library.
Hagrid was the one to interrupt the sweet moment. "Sorreh to interrupt yeh, but it's time ter go." He said, placing his enormous hand on both Hermione and Ron's shoulders.
On August 10th the six friends had to leave the house to go to France for the European Quidditch Cup, which would have taken place the day after, on Ginny's birthday.
His comeback brought the two of them back to their "hot discussion", as Hermione called it, from November.
"They must have used the room for something...uh... romantic...like a date." Hermione said in her usual know-it-all voice. The door finally appeared on the wall and Hermione displayed her most triumphant smile. "Ah ha!" she gracefully pulled the door open and entered the room, followed by an astonished Ron. Harry and Draco stood before them, both with their faces pale, as though they had seen a monster.
She was right in front of her favourite Quidditch player ever, she had fantasized about that moment so many times and now, there she was, so unbelievably close to her.
"Are you staring at me because you want to kiss me?" She said,without thinking. "Because I'd be fine with it."
"Maybe you deserve someone else, someone who will make efforts for you, someone who would do anything for you..."
Draco shifted his head slightly, so that he could face him. "I am totally fine, really. I've given up on him. His acceptance is something I will never get." he said, sighing. "I'll just have to go on and come to terms with a life without a family."
"I need to get used to seeing Harry smooching my sister." Ron said to Hermione as they walked closer to the pair. "Oh Ron, let it go, if she's happy!" His girlfriend reprimanded him.
When the Weasley girl arrived upstairs, in Fred and George's old bedroom, where Harry and Draco had slept the night before, she found the couple sitting on the bed. Draco was crying, arguing that his boyfriend should have left him at Hogwarts.
Harry was engaging in a long conversation with Stella Thompson, she was telling him about some strategies, but he wasn't listening to her that much, he was too busy staring at Adrian Martin, who was talking to his fiancè.
Draco Malfoy was spending Christmas with her family. The families had been clashing for decades. She wondered how that could have ever worked. But, his presence meant that she could go on and speak to them without the possibility of them running away from her.
"He wants to steal my man, can't you see? Hell with 'innocent dick cuddling' in fucking Beauxbatons, he was trying to seduce him. " Harry spat.
The line went Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna on the right side of the table, while on the left side sat Molly, Percy, George, Angelina, Bill and Fleur. Arthur was the head of the table, sitting between his wife and Harry.
"Harry, wait!" She called to him, but he didn't seem to care. "Please, don't walk away! We loved each other once!"
"Come on, I know a way to make all this stress go away." Draco whispered, lightly brushing Harry's lips with his own and breathing against them, all while he grabbed his left buttcheek firmly.
"I'll talk to her tomorrow..." Harry reassured his friend. He surely didn't want to be hated by him. He knew how protective Ron was when it came to his sister. He shifted uncomfortably in his bed, hoping that this conversation would end as soon as possible.
"Oh and many of the people here who are disguised as muggles are actually Aurors who kindly agreed to supervise the event." Harry continued, raising a smile.
"I'm so excited! I saw 'em grow up right before me eyes!" Hagrid cried and then blew his nose into his sheet-looking handkerchief.
He considered himself lucky to be able to talk to her after the match, he would have totally asked for advice.
Luna linked her arm with hers, smiling. "I love apparating. It's so cool, it makes you feel like you're stuck in a vortex of fun."She said. The bushy haired girl giggled at her excitement.
He had met the love of his life there, after all, and on his last year- his first and only 'calm year' at Hogwarts.
"Well, I hope you like this cake, Gin." said Hermione, trying to suppress a smirk. "You are going to cut it from here." she pointed to the first "P" from the writing.
Their peace and quiet was interrupted by a faint sound in the distance, it was footsteps. Someone was approaching the Room of Requirement.
"You're ridiculous. " Draco hissed. "If I'd wanted to, I would have done it already, don't you think? But I pushed him away because I happen to be dating you."
The three couples were all granted separate rooms, so Harry could sleep in the same bed as his future husband without any unwanted guests-especially Percy-  and the news of the double wedding infected the whole household with a spread of high spirits.
Luna was lying on her back with her legs bent, moving them slightly. Ginny sat on Ron's right, she had Luna's head on her lap and would caress her hair from time to time.
"So if you wanted me present at your wedding, I'd be happy to oblige." Mrs Malfoy said, letting tears escape her eyes, putting a loving hand on her son's shoulder.
"Why, did he make you think about it?" the girl asked. Something in the way she asked seemed off, like she was eager to know the answer, but he chose not to mind it too much- Pansy was known to be a gossip.
"Mini Weasel... um... Ginny,"Draco mocked. "We certainly didn't start on the right foot, the two of us. Mostly because you were dating my man, but then we became close and formed this cute friendship that we now have. Thank you for telling the whole world about me and Harry, doing so you helped me overcome my insecurities and the fear of my father. But, mostly, thank you for being a little sister to me."
"Having to share the bedroom with Jean Jaques is rather, um, horrendous." said Draco, grimacing. Jean Jaques was beginning to make him miss his old room mates. And that said a lot.
Professor McGonagall had had enough of the ruckus that was now taking place in the room, so she yelled "Finite Incantatem!" and ordered for everyone to keep quiet.
"Then we decided to swim into this ocean, new to both of us, and I've come to the realization that we are all we need to be complete. I am the light, you are the darkness. You and I, together, are all that is most different, but also all that is most similar. With you is the only way that I feel like I'm Harry Potter. I love you, Draco, like never before. And I hate the fact that we have to hide. I'd shout it from the rooftops... " Harry said. He was smiling brightly and he felt tears threatening to invade his eyes. "I'm in love with DRACO MALFOY!" He finally shouted. He was now panting, hoping that Draco felt the same as he did.
Draco had detached himself from all Gryffindors and Luna, so that he could become closer to Jean Jaques who, he noticed, was not so bad.
He grabbed him by his robe and pushed him to a wall. Before Draco knew it, the redhead had punched his face hard enough to make him fall.
"I don't think so. Last time I checked it, people saw us as two deadly enemies. They'll just think we had one of our duels, if anything." Harry said. Well, that much was true. So they hurried to the potions class. Hungry and with their hair unkempt, but there was not much time. Not that Harry minded the hair part, anyway.
But what would father say, if he ever found out? He thought. He'd probably disown me. And Blaise... he'd make my nights a living hell. I wonder if this is the right thing...
Suddenly, everyone looked at her and Ginny. The redhead eyed her girlfriend nervously, then she nudged her softly.
Harry could finally understand why Neville had petrified him. He felt so bad for him, his friend was very easy to manipulate and the Malfoys' cruelty pushed him to do the unthinkable.
"It's time." she mouthed. The boy gave a nod of understanding, then he sat up and shouted, " I object!" Everyone in the room looked at him, feeling shocked.
"I don't care, I'm still gonna kill him!" Harry shouted, in anger. He was ready to punch him when Draco stopped him.
Next morning, Harry met up with Ginny in the common room before breakfast. It had been their routine every day so far.
His best friends looked at each other in a knowing look. Hermione shook her head. "They were totally shagging." Ron said in his girlfriend's ear. She nodded. "He didn't sleep in our dorm, this totally confirms it." He added.
"I missed you too, my sweet son. You'll see, your father will understand too, one day. You just have to give him time." Narcissa said in a delicate tone, showing Draco a comforting smile.
He didn't intend to reveal his intention to his friends - he wanted it to be a surprise for everyone.
Harry was happy to comply. He slammed himself into him, earning a scream of pleasure. He moved, slowly at first, then he quickened his pace. "Oh f-fuck, yes!"This is what heaven must feel like, Harry thought. It felt better than anything he had ever done in his life. This is what the fuss was all about. As shocks of pleasure pervaded his body, he thought that there was no place he'd rather be. He was perfectly fine inside of his arch enemy.
He looked at the head seat opposite his, which was empty. "To our Fred, hoping he's spending a marvelous Christmas in Heaven if there is one, filled with fireworks and jokes. Fred, we miss you every day!" As he finished his speech, Arthur gave a sob. His wife hugged him from her seat, fighting her own tears. Everyone was sad, now. George fought the urge to leave the room, but his girlfriend grabbed him by his hand, giving him a comforting smile.
"Oh, damn!" Luna's father groaned. He was a sore loser, unlike his daughter. "This is just beginner's luck!"
"Oh, about that!" Harry said, remembering something. "I've been meaning to ask you... will you spend Christmas with me at the Weasleys'?" he asked.
The bird was holding a letter firmly into his beak, its envelope was red. There was no doubt as to what it was: a howler.
Also, the mystery surrounding the Malfoys knowing everything their son did, even if they weren't communicating with him, was solved.
Draco wondered what might have happened between the happy couple, and he couldn't help smiling at that. Ah, finally they were crashing. This meant that his chances of seducing Potter were becoming more and more.
"You can take this from here." Ron said to Draco, then both he and Hermione left the room, leaving the estranged lovers to deal with their own issues.
That night, at dinner, Harry still had some scarlet and gold confetti in his hair from the celebration in the Common Room. Luna had been invited, too. Draco had not attended, as he was the Captain of the losing team. He was supposed to speak to the Headmistress, anyway.
One afternoon, the six friends gathered under their favourite tree, in the Hogwarts courtyard, with the intent to study, but they ended up talking about the bloke.
"Want a duel, Potter? Make it a duel." Jean Jacques hissed. He, too, took his wand out and disarmed Harry.
"How dare you? On my birthday!" The Green eyed boy scoffed when the mach was over and Draco flaunted his prize - a homemade cookie- for everyone to see.
Harry felt gut wrenching guilt as he looked at the girl walking happily towards him. He was about to rip her heart in a million little pieces... He would have watched her fall apart, helplessly. But this had to be done. He needed to man up and face this. He was a Gryffindor, after all, and Gryffindors didn't know fear.
This was it. They were going to come out to their friends and anxiety spiraled through their bodies. Ginny didn't know why she was scared, after all there was already a diverse couple in their group, but, for some reason, she was not completely calm.
"Don't, Harry, let it go, it isn't worth it." Draco said, then he grabbed him by his robe, motioning for him to sit back down.
"Enough! I don't want anyone else. I made friends with him because I missed you! And I should have been more honest with you, told you I needed more..."
"Oh, mother, I feel so excited yet scared!" Draco said to Narcissa, all while trying to steady his shaky breathing.
"You are a Malfoy, your blood is pure, therefore you should not hang out with this... scum. Or this pervert." his father said, referring to Harry, who had not said a word until now.
"George and Angie here have taught me that if you love someone, why should you wait to always have them by your side?" Harry expressed.
Ginny Weasley, Harry's ex and best friend's sister, was standing there, a smirk set on her face. She had a camera in her hand, the camera that he had given her as a birthday gift in August. His breath caught up in his throat as he began to think that, maybe, Ginny was determined to use that device to hurt him. If she hadn't done that already.
"He's right." Draco said. "This was a mistake. I shouldn't have..." that said, he rushed off upstairs.
"I don't want to listen to-" Harry said, but he was interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from his boyfriend. "ow!"
Luna loved the effect she had on her girlfriend. Everything about her was beautiful, her hair, her freckles, her bright brown eyes, her lips... but she was also beautiful on the inside. She was fun to be around, she had a good heart and a bright mind... she loved her. She had never told her before, not in the 'girlfriend way'. Now, it was the right time to do so. Without further hesitation, she blurted it out.
Wizards and witches attending could travel there by Floo Powder or disapparation, as they would end up in a close by room. which was protected by a disillusionment charm.
She had noticed that, ever since Christmas, the two girls seemed more... United than they had been before.
"Oh, it could be symbolic? Or they could marry somewhere where it is permitted? Don't spoil this, son!" Molly reprimanded.
After a bumpy ride in Rosemary Granger's old Panda Young- a ride that Draco and Ron found rather scary - they all arrived at the Granger household.
Luna looked at their hands and blushed slightly. "No problem. I just think you're influenced by vile creatures, but I know that the real you is much better." she said.
Not replying to the boy next to him, he brought himself down on the mattress, facing the curtains. Tears were still streaming down his rosy cheeks.
Not long before dinner Harry found himself in the library with Hermione, telling her of what had just happened. He watched her eyes widen with what looked like shock together with disappoint. "You made out with Malfoy? I can't believe it... You broke up with Ginny today!" "Shh, Hermione! No one needs to know!" Harry tried to shut her up. "I don't know if you realize just how full of shit you are! I'm gonna tell Ginny. And Ron. You're dead." Just as the girl turned around to leave the room, Harry grabbed her arm. "Oh please, no!"
Draco's face whitened and all he could hear was the sound of his racing heartbeat, which was louder than his father's voice.
"I'm sorry I called you a mudblood..." Draco said, looking down. He couldn't believe he had just apologized. Slytherins did not apologize. He still shook her hand, though.
"Not really,"said Draco. "I suppose if you had kept your mouth shut, maybe, Harry wouldn't have overheard you babbling about the Jean Jacques thing."
"Oh, this is technically a muggle weddin'. If you had seen a real one in our world, boy, yeh probably woulda fainted from the shock." The half-giant chuckled.
"You know, babe." Harry began, after breaking the kiss. "There are many things about Hogwarts that I liked, but my favourite part of it was definitely you."
But Harry wouldn't let him finish. He pushed him away abruptly, using so much strength to nearly knock him to the ground.
It was Ron's turn to talk to Draco now and he didn't seem too happy about it. "Look, Malfoy, don't you dare play one of your tricks on Harry, ok?" he warned. "Or you will see."
On June 5th, 1980, a young woman named Narcissa was lying on a bed, spent. She was sweating profusely, her breath was slowing and her whole body ached.
The last day of school an outbreak of sadness spread throughout the people attending their final year.
Maybe that was why he had invited Ginny over, the 'closest friend' actually meant 'girlfriend' to him, maybe.
Harry's body was as far from Draco's as possible. The distance between them was starting to get under Draco's skin.
Luna and Ginny had just finished school at Hogwarts and they were still living at home with their respective parents.
The couple's destination was the lake. When they reached it, Draco looked at Harry with widened eyes. "What exactly do you think we are going to do on this frozen lake?"
"Sure! To my biggest fan Ginevra, I hope you make it big." Gwengo pronounced the words as she wrote them.
There was no way to reason with him about Ginny, she had done something horrible and he wasn't willing to forgive her, at least not yet.
He heard someone shifting in a bed, but no more sounds were heard. Harry was probably asleep. But, at least, he was alive.
Draco's grey eyes widened in utter terror as he wasn't completely clueless as to what that might be. Who that might be, to be exact.
"No, not yet." Draco breathed. He then stopped what he was doing and rolled around the bed, then went on to remove his own shirt. He was no longer on top of Harry, but he was now positioning himself on all fours. "I want you to fuck me, Potter."
"They say that they're the vilest creatures to have ever lived. But I have never encountered one... only their eggs."
"Ginny, stop!" the boy grabbed her wrists, but she quickly squirmed away and planted a sound slap on his cheek. He totally deserved it, in his opinion. "Don't. Touch. Me!" This said, she ran off.
"No! Are you out of your mind?" Draco said to Pansy in a loud whisper. How had Pansy found out about him and Harry? Had little miss Perfect AKA Granger tipped her off? It had to have been her. Draco felt like fainting in that moment. His heart was beating so fast that he could feel it in his neck.
"The saying is 'may the best team win' not 'may the worst team win'." Harry said with a wink, earning a death stare.
"Oh I ran into Hermione and your brother, who were hoping to use the Room for themselves, and she said that she knew who was inside."
"I saw that you did not respond to my letter. Therefore, I came here to fetch you myself." Lucius said in a cold tone.
"Father, I am not you." Draco spat. "Now I know, I don't want to be like you. You're a cruel man, You cut me out of your life because you didn't agree with my life choices, when I always did anything I could to make you happy, even if it meant being a death eater. I am still mourning over losing you. I spent months waiting for you to contact me, but if you are not willing to accept me for who I am, then I don't care about seeing you."
"Well, I listened to some of the other things you said while asleep." the Slytherin purred into Harry's ear, then he winked.
The NEWTs pressure and the occasional haunting memories of the previous year had been very harsh on Harry and his ability to concentrate, even on his beloved subject.
"Wow, lesbiennes? They turn me on ever more." Adrian giggled softly, as he put a hand on Luna's cheek to caress it.
Suddenly, he heard the drapes of his bed rip open. He lay still, eyes widened in terror. What the devil was going on? He didn't dare look behind his back.
"Maybe it's the nargles that made him change his mind about you..." Luna said in her absent tone. "Maybe it is them... I really don't have a clue... He was so distant..." Ginny said, she then buried her face in her hands.
Just breathing into each other, feeling each other's bodies close, was enough to make them ecstatic.
There was a slow clap, then it became louder by the second. Harry smiled. He felt so much respect for himself in that moment. And for the crowd. Everyone was clapping at the bravery, except Blaise, Gregory, Pansy and Ginny. Blaise was so shocked that he had almost choked on a bean.
Harry was definitely waiting for the blonde boy to say something. He thought about it for a few seconds and then decided to fall head first into this. "Potter, I wish I could say that I want to end this, but I don't. I feel so scared because everyone here hates me...And I'm not good at relationships, as I am toxic. But I feel so many things for you now and... I hate myself for it. So much."
"Oh, Luna, it's been a month and I still have no answers..." Ginny gave an exasperated sigh. She was with her best friend, Luna, in the library to study for a project, but she couldn't focus on it as her brain was haunted by the possible reasons for her break up with Harry. Plus it was getting quite late and she started feeling tired.
As the five friends discussed their way through breakfast, Narcissa was in her house, pacing the floor.
"I saw her in the common room, she says she's too busy for dinner." Hermione explained Ginny's absence. Harry didn't feel sorry at all. He wasn't sad that his girlfriend couldn't see him.
Watching their friends confirm, once again, their undying love for each other made her think of her relationship with that blonde girl. She had jumped, head first, into that new thing that she had been afraid of for so long. That had been the best thing she had ever done.
She opted to keep her eyes on Ginny. It didn't raise suspicion, as she would often spend minutes staring in awe at her girlfriend's beauty.
"Don't you dare say speak ill of Harry! He is my family now. Hell, he has been more family in these months than you have ever been in nineteen years. And Ron, he gave me his house for two weeks. Yeah, the same people you taunted so much were fine with having me in their home."
"Mother... I've missed you, I'm not going to lie... I thought I lost you..." He managed to say through his broken voice.
Additionally, he didn't break down and cry like he would have done on other occasions, he just stood there.
"Poor Angie, she got the worst Weasley." Bill joked from behind Harry. "Hoping he won't drive her mad!"
"What the devil is going on?" Miss Sivan's voice said, echoing through the hallway. "Mr Malfoy, let go of Weasley! And Parkinson, put the wand down!" The woman rushed to the four of them, her cloak brushing the floor. "Do you all want detention?"
"Oh, he's become such a pest. He's uncontrollable, I swear I almost tripped on him once." The brunette whined.
"Yeah." Harry said. He was moving his fork idly in his plate, not daring to eat. "That guy's just so stubborn sometimes."
All those times they spent together, going to see Quidditch matches, roaming through Diagon Alley... Draco cherished them, they were among the only moments of utter delight between them.
Oh, God. He had not eaten a pizza in ages. He would only eat it on rare occasions, as the Dursleys weren't really fond of him eating food that he liked. He had missed it.
He had a very special bond with the place, even if his times there had not all been peaches and dandelions. He couldn't remember how many times he had risked death, together with breaking rules and being almost expelled.
"I swear, you will kill me one day. You gave me a massive scare out here. Now, I want to marry you even more than I did before." said Harry, once he recollected himself.
"Lastly, know that I don't think you are unworthy of love. Someone will love you, I'm sure of it. It just won't be me. As for your Great Hall thing- you know me. I believe in second chances. I figure you deserve it, too."
"Luna, sweetums, really, you shouldn't have done that to him. Sure, he was an asshole and I wanted to kill him for touching your face like that, but you could have been arrested!" Ginny scolded as she pulled on her girlfriend's arm.
"Yes, it is. I am the one he trusts, now, aren't I? It only makes sense for me to make the first move." the woman explained.
The only person in the whole school who didn't seem to hate her was Luna. Too bad that she was a Ravenclaw.
"Draco, the offer still stands." he simply said, then he took his wand from the floor and disapparated, emitting a loud 'pop'.
"And I'm sorry if I fooled you, in any way. I was going through emotional turmoil, as I didn't know who I was. Now, I do. And I am, as you said, in love with Draco." As he said that, he looked at his boyfriend, who was smiling. He turned back to Ginny and continued with his speech.
He had covered his whole body with the duvet, even his head. Draco found it odd that someone could sleep like that, he wondered if he was even breathing.
They were walking in the hallway, making their way towards the Thestrals that would have taken them to the station. They had all used Locomotion Charm on their trunks, so they were flying behind them.
"You think I'm joking because I'm calm? I'm scared shitless, mate!" Ron whined, sitting next to Harry. His face was pale and he kept hyperventilating.
Hermione had given Harry a box of Chocolate Frogs, while Ron had bought him a decoration for Viridis' cage. Harry had given Hermione a new quill. His gift to Ron was a box of Honeydukes exploding bon bons.
His fiance's firm hand on his shoulder indicated for him to move quickly, so he whispered underneath his breath,
"We didn't contact you because we were disgusted in you. We don't think that you're this person now. You've just been influenced. We both know that your place is with us. We are willing to forgive you if you stop with this nonsense, even if you hurt us greatly."
"No, we are going to sleep tonight." said Harry, sternly. Then, he made his way to his dorm, not telling Draco to come with him.
They had been humiliated in front of the whole school, yet that had not been enough to sever said bond.
Harry let out. All he wanted in that moment was to be left alone. He didn't need another one of those mom-like scoldings Hermione was so fond of.
"It's just a lot to take in... You've changed so much since this...happened and I guess I blamed it all on Potter..."
Draco had to put up a fake smile, as he watched his boyfriend prepare himself for their double date. "Ok, shoot. What's wrong?" Asked Harry, all while putting on cologne.
She was a very jealous girlfriend, she had let her hug Gwenog Jones only because she knew she had been wanting to for ages, but this guy was crossing a line.
"Let's go to sleep, shall we? It's, like, 2 am." the black haired boy said, not daring to look at the blond one.
"You're right, I was a piece of shit, but this doesn't mean you can go out and smooch that... that..."
As she sucked on her clitoris, Ginny grabbed the sheets and tried to suppress a moan, all the while her toes curled in pleasure.
"You can't force that upon me, father. You can't expect me to just go back home and forget everything after you and mother have completely ignored my existence for months." Draco said bitterly. "Also, these people now are my friends. And Harry is my boyfriend."
"Ah, is this the surprise? You look like you're going to a wedding. You look even smarter than you did at your own wedding." Draco observed, after giving him a long lasting glance.
Ron noticed that his best friend had not taken his boyfriend to dance, so he became curious as to why he would refuse to do so.
"You know what, Luna... I feel bad for Malfoy. I never thought I'd say this but he didn't really deserve to be thrown out of his home."she said, still looking down.
Draco was puzzled when he heard the word "map". That's why Harry always knew where he was, he had a map that let him do so. "You have a map that tracks people down?" He asked, addressing his boyfriend.
As she kneeled down to examine it, the mystery around it was revealed: it was nothing but a chicken egg.
"Eh mine weren't so bad. I wasn't forced to constantly fix your tie." Said Draco teasingly, apparently off the veritaserum now.
Some of them thought it was an act and that it was part of the show - especially Rosemary Granger, who stood there, watching the scene unravel.
"It's what we've always been, after all, friends." Harry observed. True, their relationship wasn't much more special than a friendship, except for the kissing bit.
When they arrived at the pitch, they positioned themselves on their brooms. Ginny mounted her Cleansweep Eleven, while Luna had to use one of the school brooms.
The Great Hall fell silent. Some students were exchanging looks, some of them were looking at Draco and Harry, but no one dared say a word. The two of them just stood there, next to each other, unable to produce a sound. Harry wasn't scared, but he was still shocked that Ginny could ever do something like this to him. Additionally, he was aware that his boyfriend was having an internal break down.
Draco knew what Potter was playing at. He wanted to be in a cute relationship filled with flowers and chocolates.
"What do you want, Potter?" Blaise asked in a bitter tone. "Looking for trouble, you faggot?" As he said he got into Harry's face. Harry's hand was in his pocket, aiming for his wand.
Hermione's bushy hair needed taming as they were supposed to attend this Dentist New Year's Gala, an event involving all the best dentists of the country and many important people would have participated.
Harry detached himself from Ginny and ran to where Pansy was, Draco tried to do the same but they were too late. Pansy had already formulated the spell.
All while Neville and Blaise kept the others busy, he grabbed his immobilised son by an arm and dragged him to his mother.
Many boys in the class were mesmerized by her apparent delicate manners, but in reality she was a very strong witch. Perfect for the subject, Harry always thought.
Harry's suit was maroon, just like Ron's, and they changed into the bedroom, while Luna got ready in the bathroom.
Hermione's eyes narrowed and her neck turned red, she gave the impression that she was on the verge of exploding. But, just as her lips parted to speak, she started looking ill.
"Ginny, please! Think about what you're about to do! What do you think our mother would do if she saw you like this? This is not who you are!" Ron said, hoping to bring his sister back to her senses. Ginny seemed to consider it for a bit.
All that could be heard was the occasional cough from a student. The teachers were also very quiet. When the two lovers parted the kiss, Draco had tears in his eyes. Harry brushed his fingers on his face to wipe all the residue . Draco looked into his eyes and smiled. The two boys looked at the crowd in front of them and Harry's voice broke the silence.
Hermione didn't know how to respond to that. She knew that look well. It was her 'I know you can do better' look that she'd give her when she didn't agree with her actions.
"Look, I'm going to sleep, now. You do whatever you want. " Harry said, lying back down on the wall's side.
June train rides to King's Cross were never really a fun adventure for Harry and his gang, but this time was particularly hard.
"Oh," the woman giggled. " The other day, on one of my strolls through Diagon Alley, I came accross this Jewel Shop.
"Now, you grip the stick firmly, like so..." said Ginny, holding onto the broomstick like she said she had to. Luna's hands almost slipped from them.
Harry sighed, seemingly dropping his anger to become worried. "I know, but you can't let your guard down. I think you need to change rooms, once again." he said.
Draco quickly removed Harry's shirt, then he gripped his back as the black haired boy sucked on his neck.
While on the train platform, Ron revealed how he had received knowledge of his girlfriend's pregnancy.
Ginny couldn't be happier knowing that her mum was Ok with her being in love with a girl. She had spent months filled with anxiety, in fear that she wouldn't be accepted.
"Can you explain to me why Ginny is so distraught?" Hermione asked, given that Ginny was sitting at another table, looking visibly upset. It wasn't like her to sit far away from them at Breakfast.
In the end, the Quafflepunchers beat the Harpies by two hundred points, as Jean Jacques' doppelganger caught the snitch.
"What do you mean you can't? Let me do that!" Mrs Malfoy shouted, pushing him away to take her son into her arms.
"So, since we're here I propose a toast to the happy couple!" He said, when everyone fell silent, raising his drink in the air.
After taking a deep breath, she tried to make swirls in the blue, but they didn't come out as beautiful as her girl's.
Harry extended his hand for Draco to hold. "Come on, Draco. Don't be a chicken. It will be fun, I promise."
"Because you know, Hermione! That's why... I mean, otherwise someone else would have said something, but no one is." Harry explained. It was true, no one in the Great Hall seemed to have seen it. They were all too busy munching on their food, anyway.
"Hey sis!" Ron greeted her. He was walking funny, she noticed. "Don't mind my walk, I fell on ice and landed on my tailbone." He then sat next to her, flinching slightly.
"You see, this is the only way we can have a moment in public. By checking the grades sheet together." He sighed. "I don't think it's fair, Ron... I mean, why can't I kiss him in front of everyone like you do with Mione?"
Then Hagrid pulled away, not looking at his young friends to avoid getting them entirely wet with his extra large tears.
She didn't take too long to get into her dress, however, fitting Hermione into her gown wasn't as easy as she'd hoped, given the many layers and the zip in the back.
"I'm sorry, too, Harry." came Ron's voice, then he joined the hug. Draco felt a bit out of place as he witnessed this touching reconciliation. They looked like they really cared about each other. He wondered how it felt to actually have friends. It must have a been a very beautiful thing.
He didn't know what to say at this point, he was outraged. After what felt like forever, all while he heard his boyfriend cry, he spoke. "Go back to Jean Jaques, go! Go get fucked by him, since your boyfriend here won't even move a finger for you."
"That is just so pure and... I just can't!" Ron said, his tears flowing on his cheeks. "They grow up so fast!"
When they arrived in their first class seats, Ginny could barely hold her excitement. She felt happiness take over her, as she jumped around squealing.
"I told you, Pans, you're like a sister to me." The boy grinned. She snorted. Sometimes he'd feel bad about this, but there was no way that he and Pansy would ever get together. Also, he couldn't tell her why. The whole school would have known faster than he could say "Potter."
"You will see," Narcissa went on, confident. "we will get our son back, this time. He won't have a choice."
"You are a charmer, Potter." He murmured. "And as much as I would love round 2, we have to get to Ron and Hermione, they must be worried." He said, tapping his shoulder as a way to tell him to get up.
His girlfriend turned around to face him and with a death stare she finally spoke. "Ask him, if you want to know."
The day after, Pansy had her trunk ready, she was in the Slytherin common room, waiting for her ride.
"Don't mention that moron." said Harry. "He didn't, by chance, happen to molest you, did he?" he asked his boyfriend.
The Slytherin shook his head lightly, then he brought their foreheads together. "You are too adorable." he whispered, then he captured the Gryffindor's lips with his own, engaging into a soft kiss.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him. "Why must you always be so insensitive, Ronald? We have so many memories here!" She scolded.
"When I learned that it was Pansy, I couldn't believe it. I mean, I worked on... Some plans with her, but, really, this one is beyond me." Said Ginny, still incredulous.
The whole room smelled like a combination of jasmine and lavender fragrances, evoking a calming effect on the people who entered it.
At the Slytherin table Draco was smiling his brightest smile. "Ah, Blaise, don't you think today is a wonderful day?"
He hated that face, it usually indicated that the other boy had something unspeakable planned out in his mind and there was no escaping from it. Not that he minded-he couldn't wait to see what his plan was- but he was supposed to be studying. Draco, that slimy bastard, knew that he just couldn't say no to his 'hot requests'.
Ginny, at the sight of the applauding people, felt as if she had made a mistake in her plan. She turned to Pansy, her face showing a disappointed look. "I don't understand... why is everyone clapping their hands?" She wondered.
"No, your life is over! The whole school will know!" Pansy replied, eying the camera in Ginny's grip.
"Oh, naturally. I tried to convince him it was good news - he hasn't spoken to me since. So I fear he won't be attending." The woman said in a gloomy voice.
"Oh, I see... he's just a bit...goofy, I don't want to say a bad word." Mrs Granger said as she folded the cream colored napkins. "Are you sure he can provide everything you need?"
Hermione nodded, although she found it rather odd that the adults in the picture weren't too aggressive on the intruders.
He pulled them down with his teeth, all while making eye contact with Draco, who whispered a loud "Oh, Merlin!"
"No worries," said Draco, as he sat opposite her, next to Harry. "Your friend here has taught me a few important guidelines to follow."
"Look, you're free to choose. But I would love to spend Christmas with you. I could stay here, but I already promised Molly I'd go..." Harry said, looking at him with pleading eyes.
Now, he was sure that their whole relationship had been part of a sick plan, Malfoy style. How could he have been so blind? It was all clear to him now.
The blonde let go of the other girl's breasts, moving her hands towards the girls red lacy underpants. She gave her a questioning look as to ask for permission. Ginny nodded for her to continue.
Luna and Ginny did a dance that was very similar to their Easter one, earning a bunch of puzzled looks.
After Draco, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff Seventh-years spoke as well, until the last one to speak was Ron.
In a matter of seconds, the whole of the Great Hall was filled with banners, much like those used in the House Cup, but, instead of a house crest, they sported a picture of Draco and Harry kissing each other.
"How dare you?" Lucius Malfoy hissed, reaching for his wand. This brought Harry back to that time he had freed Dobby and that man had tried to hex him.
Ginny gave a soft laugh. Luna found that her laugh was her favourite sound in the world, it was so cute and always made her squeal.
"Yeah, they are..." said Harry, absent-mindedly. He looked a bit weird, to say the least - like he was out of it. He was shaking his right leg, tapping the floor with his foot.
After what felt like forever, she took a breath. "Well, it's true..." the girl said, holding Luna's hand. "We are together."
Harry must have noticed the boy's puzzled expression at the sight of it, given he chuckled softly. "Oh, don't look at it like that- I can assure you, it's really good. I asked the elves to make us this special muggle delicacy- and a cheap one, too- so that our first date could have a bit of my old traditions, hoping to deliver a new one for you... and to introduce you to Muggle food, really." he added, smiling. Draco gave him half a smile, he wasn't too convinced, but changed his mind the moment he bit into his burger. Harry enjoyed looking at his boyfriend digging into his food, emitting some moans of pleasure. "This is afmafing!" Draco said in a muffled tone and it reminded Harry of Ron whenever food was put in front of him. The messy haired boy grinned. "Told you you'd like it."
"Do you ever think before acting?" She said as she broke free from Harry's grip. "This is the same guy that gave me shit for being a muggle born!"
"Are you saying I'm not Gryffindor enough?" Harry playfully asked, pretending to be offended at Draco's remarks.
"Father, I don't care about our name, for it is only associated with death eaters. And I never wanted to take part in that." Draco said in a serious tone.
The fact that one of them was your son and didn't mention such life-changing event to you, for example.
Ginny finally decided that it was time to ask her girl what in the world those nargles were. She wouldn't go a day without talking about them. They were her top enemies. Hell, she even thought that they ran through her backyard to lay their chicken eggs.
Harry passed a shocked Ginny on his way to his seat. "It takes much more to bring down Harry Potter, didn't Voldemort teach you anything?" he said to her, with a hint of sass.
She didn't know whether she should say hi, since they now had a mutual friend, but they didn't really see eye to eye.
Ginny's birthday celebration was supposed to be a quiet gathering - Ron and Hermione having a child meant that they couldn't stay up all night or make too much noise.
"Well." Narcissa said, when her fancy drink was placed in front of her. Her eyed then fixed on the ring on her son's left hand. "Marriage, uh? What pushed you to make this choice?"
Not finding a better option, he ran away. While he did so, his heart was beating so loud that he couldn't hear his thoughts, his head was throbbing violently. He was crying tears of anger.
"Well..." Draco sighed. "I have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to share this Holiday with you. Without you, I would have been miserable... but you made it perfect. How is it that you always make everything better?"
"This is not what I was meaning to discuss, actually." The boy said, scratching his head. "I need to tell you something very important."
It was a Reception room belonging to the hotel, its walls were white and there were around four marble columns, each of them had a least four balloons tied to it; one was golden, one was red and the last two were green and silver.
That night, as Draco lay in bed next to a sleeping Harry, he thought that this had been the best Christmas of his life.
"She wouldn't shut up about you being presentable at the Chosen One's wedding... sounds to me like she wants to take advantage of the attention we'd get to plan something nefarious." he snorted.
Ginny's laugh echoed through the courtyard and Draco could have sworn that was the most annoying sound he had ever heard, even more annoying than Granger's know-it-all interventions in class. "Draco? Will you pay attention to me? I've been calling you for minutes!" Blaise's voice boomed in his ears and that was enough for him to get out of his trance. Blaise was his study buddy for the day, he was a good fella, most of the times, but he had just interrupted his deep thoughts. "What do you want?" He asked, irritated.
"Ah, yeah, I recall. Right after we did it, you said it was a 'mistake', I quote." Draco said, taking in air quotes.
"Same."Luna said. "People are cruel. And your little game in the Great Hall probably didn't help. I suspect the Wrackspurts had infested your brain that day." She continued, firmly convinced of her theory.
"Oh Merlin, I can't believe I'm about to talk to Gwen!" Ginny squeaked, all while holding her girlfriend's hand. "This is a dream come true!"
"But-" Harry tried to argue. "No buts. Get to work or I'll remove more points." Miss Sivan said sternly.
Not much later, the bridesmaids and the groomsmen made their entrance. Ginny and Luna walked inside, happily greeting the guests with one hand, the other one holding a small bouquet.
Ron nodded, then he added, "Harry must still be in our dorm. He's always so predictable when he's sad. Not that he left it much these days..."
They ended up dancing and blasting music all around the living room, all while making snacks and drinks fly into their mouths.
"Good, you didn't call me a mudblood, for once." Hermione observed. "Well, it just so happens that Harry is our best friend."
Luna didn't worry about making sounds, as she had already soundproofed Ginny's bedroom, in hope that they'd be having sex there.
Ron wasn't good at keeping secrets. If nobody suspected that he was hiding something, he was good to go, but, if anyone ever happened to interrogate him on the matter, it wasn't a hard task to get him to spill the beans.
"Guys..." Harry said, then he took a breath. "You'll think me crazy, but... " he moved closer to them so that no one would over hear. "I think I might be falling in love with him."
"You just mind your business." He said in a menacing tone. This wasn't the first time he told Pansy that. He wondered if ordering her to stay out of his business was a way to make her even more interested in that matter.
Draco was slightly annoyed at the sight of that person, he looked exactly like his former room mate from hell.
Her daughter's wedding had turned into a battlefield right before her eyes not many minutes before, it was her right to be completely shaken.
As Ron, Hermione and Draco made their way into the room, the latter noticed a broken frame sitting on the bedside table and some drops of dry blood were on it. The glass shreds were still scattered all over the floor.
"Potter, you can't help ruining families, can you? You're disgusting! Cru-" Lucius was going to cruciate him, but he was unable to, as Professor Slughorn disarmed him. "Mr Malfoy," he said "I have to ask you to leave these premises, now."
Blaise tried to argue, but Goyle tugged on his arm. Draco smiled because he saw fear creeping up on Gregory's face. "Let's go, Blaise." Goyle said, "These fairies are not worth getting detention over." But both Harry and Draco knew that this was his fear speaking. He had become a scared little shit upon thinking that Harry was taking his wand out. After all, Harry had defeated the darkest wizard of all time.
"I shouldn't have... I don't know what got into my head, really. I was just angry and... I let that get to me. It was just a shock for me to see... this." Pansy said, referring to the two of them.
Draco's heart sunk in his chest when he saw that it was the frame containing their most adorable picture. He picked it up with trembling hands.
"Oh," Draco said. Pansy was not trustworthy with these things, he should have known she would tell her blabbermouth friends. He mentally cursed himself for telling her. "I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to get into trouble... I mean, I knew you'd want to fight him or something." He reasoned.
His trail of thought shifted to the last month of his life. He had thrown all of that away because of a few nights of sex with his old enemy. But, for some weird, astronomical reason, he had fallen for him. He had told him that he loved him. He had never said those words to anyone in his life before. He wondered if it all was worth it.
"Sorry, we're late!" said a puffing Hermione. She waved a hand in the air at the pair, then she skated towards them. Draco was baffled to see that she had such graceful movements on that damned ice. She literally looked like she had walked to them. Ron, on the other hand, was struggling to move an inch. "Oh, Accio Ron's skates!" Hermione said. Her boyfriend flew straight to her, screaming a little.
"Calm down? I'm not calming down for shit, you piece of crap! How dare you cheat on me? After all I've done for you! I'll turn you into a beetle and I'll set fire to your body-"
Minutes later, the two of them were walking around Hogwarts grounds, hand in hand, determined to find their friends to tell them the news.
Said an apparent muggle from several seats behind. He quickly reached his target and bound his wrists together with invisible handcuffs.
Harry blushed and felt all warm and fuzzy inside. He didn't know if it was the effect of all the butterbeer he had consumed, but he sure felt good.
"... And you're free to sleep in my dorm, just like I am free to sleep in yours." Harry concluded, smiling brightly. "Whenever we please."
There was no need to tell them twice. It was a perfect opportunity for the pair to spend some time together, away from unwanted eyes. Sure, Miss Sivan would have been there, but she would disappear during her remedial lessons, as Harry was told by Neville, at least.
"When will you ever listen to me?" Harry said sternly, turning around to finally face his lover. "Lucky I was suspicious, think of what they could have done to you if I hadn't been!"
"George Weasley, do you take this woman  to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, in sickness and in heath, in good times and woe, for richer or poorer, keeping yourself solely unto her for as long as you both shall live?" Miss Sivan proceeded, her attention fixed on the groom.
Draco laughed and wriggled around, all while the others giggled or, in Luna's case, looked at them lovingly.
Although his friends were expecting  some kind of reconciliation between him and Ginny, he wasn't up for it. He was only hoping that the girl wouldn't replicate her Great Hall Harry and Draco bashing as a Christmas present.
This was his second holiday of the year that he would spend without his own family and seeing his friends being happy and cute and cuddly with their parents was becoming more and more unbearable.
Harry's expression was unbelievably serious. His green eyes narrowed and stayed put on the Malfoys, who were listening to him while feeling defeated.
"Please Ginny, it's no one! Please calm down..." He tried to reassure her, but she wasn't having any of it.
"It looks cool, doesn't it?" Harry observed with a smile. Draco nodded. The younger boy put his arm around his shoulder and massaged it a little. Draco wasn't used to affection, but he relaxed immediately. He had been stressed all morning because of Pansy and this surely felt nice, so he proceeded to hold the hand on his shoulder. They stood like that for a while, the time it took for the food to appear. When it did the pair went to sit on their poufs. Harry sank too deep into his, so Draco had to help him up. It all ended with a laugh and a 'thank you' kiss.
"That your grandma doesn't know that you're a witch, therefore we have to prevent strange things from happening." said Ron, reciting it like a line for theatrical purposes. He rolled his eyes after he finished.
The woman sat up to touch Draco's face. "Oh, my dear, naive son. Did you really think that I'd be fine with you marrying a man? In a muggle ceremony?" She shook her head, while clicking her tongue.
"Well he's in the wrong." Harry shrugged. "Besides, he doesn't look so sad, does he?" He turned around to glance at the Slytherin table, where Draco was laughing wholeheartedly at something that disgusting piece of muck had said.
"Oh come on, Hermione!" Harry exclaimed. "I can look after myself. He seems pretty genuine to me. You just need to get to know him, that's all. Didn't you say it yourself, that you were ready to become friends with him?"
Draco couldn't help grinning upon hearing that. "Aw, my sweet! I won't leave you alone in your bed, for the next two nights." he said, planting a kiss on Harry's cheek.
That next weekend, at Hogsmeade, Luna and Ginny had gone to Madam Puddifoot, as the Three Broomsticks wasn't the most favorable place for her.
The last time had been for Draco and Harry's birthday in Hogsmeade, that they celebrated on the same day.
Draco didn't mind her, he got up and walked to his father. Then, he was only able to say a few words.
"Dear Hogwarts,"He began, "Yes, as you can see, Draco and I are a couple. True, we weren't ready to come out, but we were forced into it by the very people we trusted the most. So, what can we do? They were surely hoping to bring us down but we chose to be brave." And as he finished his speech he held his lover's hand in his.
Only a few minutes later, the two couples were once again standing on opposite sides of the altar, Miss Sivan right in the middle.
"I saw it when you played Quidditch together that time, when you exchanged a kiss in mid air." Miss Sivan observed. "So, do you need my help with your proposal, dear?"
"Oh, he went to say hi to George, his parents are here to talk to the Headmistress and George tagged along." The girl answered.
It still had its original vintage vibe, but Molly had applied lacy decorations over the old layers of tulle and organza. She'd modified the top, breaking the round neck part into a V-neckline, and added beads to the ball gown skirt for shimmer.
As Luna babbled, Ginny would find herself looking at her hair, her eyes and her moving lips. The entire ensemble was rather hypnotizing for her. She began to wonder what it would feel like to kiss those lips while running her fingers in her hair... No, that wasn't possible, Ginny was straight and still mourning the loss of a relationship with Harry.
"Ugh, Luna, don't make me think about it!" Ron said, grimacing. The last thing he wanted to think about was his best friend having sex.
He had always been an icon in his Hogwarts years, but he was never too grateful for it, as people's expectations of him were high.
That boy had completely changed his views regarding the school. Maybe it was the simple fact of him being there that was able to turn it into a pleasant experience.
In fact, 1999 New Year's Day was the best day of my life. You are the best girlfriend in the world, when you're not mad at me. I love you to death, your cupcake Lulu."
However, the moment his taste buds felt the pizza, he realised that he had judged too soon, given his delighted expression.
"I love you, too, Draco. everything's going to be alright, I promise you. As long as I am here with you, no one will ever hurt you." The black haired boy whispered back.
Draco and Luna weren't there; they were in their respective Common Rooms, preparing for the imminent detachment.
Ginny took a sigh of relief, then she pulled Luna closer and jumped with her, unable to fight her tears.
"Let me guess, you two engaged in one of your morning duels?" Harry and Draco just looked at each other. "Take a seat, now. You're lucky I'm in a good mood today, or I would have removed a bunch of points."
"Oh, of course you can go! Even tomorrow - I value these acts of love! And don't worry, your secret is safe with me." The ex Hufflepuff said, accepting his request.
Miss Adrastea Sivan was a young woman, possibly in her thirties. Her teal blue hair fell in a cascade of curls on her shoulders and, as it moved, it scattered glitter everywhere. Many speculated that she was some kind of a veela, but it was never confirmed. She was very fond of long, white cloaks, which gave Harry the idea that she was always ready for her own wedding.
He was going to propose at the wedding, as part of his speech. It would have been so romantic, in his opinion.
These thoughts were torture for him, he wanted to obliviate his mind, he wanted to remove this beautiful, raw, emotional relationship that had all been fake.
"No, Ron, don't touch that!" Hermione shouted back, fearing that Ron was talking about the toilet brush. She rushed upstairs to stop her boyfriend from doing regrettable things. While on the stairs, she met Harry and Draco, who were already dressed.
Molly Weasley, who was sitting next to him, was weeping lightly, although not as badly as when her first son got married. "I'm getting used to this wedding thing, three sons in less than two years!"
"Last time it was 'nothing' you and Harry didn't speak for a month. So, tell me what this is all about!" said Ron, close to losing his temper.
"Oh don't worry, I'm used to this, I lived with muggles for ten years." said Harry with a polite smile, as he put down a fork.
"The eggs are spread among the garden. Who finds the most in ten minutes, comes out on top. To catch them, it's necessary to learn this dance. I'm going to need Luna for our demonstration."
"Nargles like to come and lay their eggs in our backyard," Luna explained, as she had seen her girlfriend's puzzled expression. "So we hunt them for Easter! It's so fun, you'll see! The winner is proclaimed Easter queen or king and they are fed by someone else throughout the Easter lunch."
On New Year's Eve, though, Hermione had to leave, as she had promised her parents she would spend that day with them. Ron didn't go with her, as he wasn't ready to meet her parents just yet.
Harry laughed, too. "In your dreams. Um, Draco Malfoy... My life became a thousand times better since you slithered into it." he started with his vows.
When he finished, his sister gave him the most loving look ever. "Thank you, I love you too!" she said, squeezing her brother's hand lightly.
But the girls didn't give him the littlest bit of attention, as their post game excitement brought their lips to press onto each other.
He only needed a ring. He knew he could find one in Diagon Alley, but he couldn't really leave the school premises without permission. After the war, even students of age were put on a watch.
It really flattered him to know that he had given someone the strength to be open about their relationship with another male.
"Good. Night, Harry." Said his best friend. He then lay down and turned to face the wall. That hadn't been an easy talk and boy, was Harry glad that it was over. He closed the drapes on his bed and stared at the ceiling. But as he looked down, he noticed a small problem he had forgotten about. Consequence of his dream, of course. Sighing, Harry opened the drapes, got up and made his way to the bathroom.
"Well, Malfoy... um... Draco.." Hermione said as she pulled away. "I guess we need to establish a truce." She extended her hand for him to shake.
They were sitting in three different arm chairs, one per couple, all located in front of the fire place. On the floor, next to the chairs, was a six pack of butterbeers, courtesy of Seamus.
"So sorry, man... but I need to go study. I'm so behind on Transfiguration..." Pansy said, then she left the room, hurriedly.
Luna, Ginny thought, looked like a veela. There was nothing that Ginny didn't like about her physique.
Harry let out a soft moan, which indicated to Draco that he was ready for his tongue to enter his mouth. Harry's thoughts were fuzzy, he felt like his brain was being attacked by one of those spirits that Luna warned him so much about. He opened his mouth, letting Draco's tongue in.
"Pansy, look," Draco said. "I know that I'm different now. And yeah, the fact I'm dating Harry played a part in that, but in the end, he just let me be the person that I always wanted to be, underneath it all. Now I am free, Pans. Partly because of you, I finally spoke up to my father."
"During this past month," Harry continued. "I found myself letting go of that ancient hate I felt for you. I guess it was there because we'd never got to resolve the sexual tension between us..."
"Um, Harry..." asked a very confused Hermione. She was hungover, so she looked a little ill-like."Did we miss anything?"
Hermione's mouth opened to speak, but she was interrupted by the sound of her boyfriend's voice, coming from the bathroom.
Around five minutes later, Narcissa's rum was almost finished. Harry wondered how such a fragile looking woman could drink this fast.
"What did I tell you, uh? That he touched you because he wanted to get in your pants! Because he wanted to take you away from me!" said Harry, crying freely.
Molly glared at her son, putting her arms on her waist. "When will you learn?" But it was clear that she wasn't really scolding him, as her smile betrayed her.
The moment he began unwrapping, he knew what it was. His mouth dropped as he saw a cage with a tiny owl inside. It was a snowy owl, looking exactly like his late Hedwig, except for some brown spots on its head.
Draco felt as if an enormous weight had been lifted off his shoulders. So Pansy didn't know what was really going on. But the problem persisted: she still knew something was up and, knowing her, she'd be well determined to know what Draco had been hiding all along. He couldn't let that happen, that would have ruined his life.
The crowd roared so loudly that it was impossible for the group to hear what their friends were saying.
When the now fiancés parted, Harry put the ring on Draco's finger and then embraced him in a loving hug, breathing him in. Their happiness skyrocketed through the roof, infecting every guest present.
"I know, I should have accepted this... Harry loves you. And I see that, every day at school... and I'm happy for you. Yes, and I will try to make life easier for the both of you." Ginny finished. She swallowed, anticipating their response. She was hoping they wouldn't kick her out of the room.
Harry sighed. He had to fight the urge to fling his arms around the other boy. He had just spent a good amount of time crying over him, but now, he looked so beautiful and pure...
"I can't believe I fell for this!" He yelled. "How could I ever think, for even one second, that you could ever love me? You must hate me so much, since you played me so well! All our relationship was nothing but a lie!" As he said this, Harry went back to running.
He knew he'd be sharing his dorm with Jean Jacques, but he really didn't feel like talking to him, not after what they had said to each other. And besides, Harry had to be the one to apologise.
Note that I'm posting these chapters one after the other upon importing this story from other sites (like wattpad)
"How did you know the password to this bathroom?" Draco asked. Last time he'd checked, Harry wasn't a prefect. But then he considered that his closeness to Ron and Hermione might have played a part in it.
Harry organized his initial thrusts into Draco's body in a slow pace, which he later accelerated on his boyfriend's desperate requests.
"Hello." He simply said, waving his hand. The Weasley mother walked closer to him and hugged him. "Welcome to the family." She said, leaving Draco at a loss for words.
" Look, it might come as a shock to you, given I'm not the brightest wizard there is, but, Harry... I'm not blind, I saw what happened today. It looked as if Malfoy was about to kiss you... and you didn't seem too mad about that." Ron said. Crap, what now? There was no way Harry could lie his way out of it. He wished that Ron and Hermione hadn't been there to witness that 'incident'.
The morning after Draco woke up in Harry's arms. He was confused at first, but then recalled what had happened the night before. He had agreed to a relationship with none other than Harry Potter. If a year ago anyone had told him that he'd ever become his boyfriend, he would have laughed in their face. But there he was, all cuddled up with him. He couldn't believe this. After years of this crush that had made him hate himself so much, he was finally with him.
"Ginevra Weasley now in possession of the Quaffle- that was close! Good skills, girl!" Adrastea Sivan said, whistling. Ginny had just dodged a Bludger.
"Hey, baby, it's Ok! You can still visit the school, once in a while, it doesn't mean you will never see it again." Draco cooed, caressing Harry's back gently.
However, Ginny had been unable to look at Luna, so she didn't know whether she had been simply petrified or fatally harmed in the fall.
"Happy fourth month-and-a-half-a-versary, baby girl. Here," the Ravenclaw girl pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket. "This is us."
The black haired boy suddenly twirled him around, making a circle in the ice. Draco had to hold on to him to avoid falling head first into the ice. "Are you out of your mind?" he yelled.
"So, I've known these two since we were all midgets and I couldn't stand Draco, it was no secret..." she continued.
It was their building familiarity that did the trick. They became used to each other's bodies and minds, so much to form a connection unlike any.
When the girls went back under the tree, they had all reassured him that Hermione had suffered a panic attack for the excessive stress she was in and she had been sick as a consequence.
"Oh come on, Arthur! He's Harry's boyfriend, he wanted to spend-" Molly began, but her husband cut her off.
Ron was kept in the dark when it came to their fall out, but he had had enough of watching the two most important people in his life grow apart for no apparent reason, so that early December morning at breakfast he decided it was time for them to tell him why they were acting so ridiculously.
Harry didn't really care, though. Hell, he had defeated Lord Voldemort only months before. Certainly, a few angry Slytherins couldn't hurt him.
After Narcissa left- her send-off including a very awkward group hug- the couple found themselves walking back to the castle.
During these past four months, he would hold his breath every time he saw an owl approach, hoping that it was some sort of apology letter from his parents, begging him to come back home, telling him that he was accepted.
"Oh allo, Dracou, I'm Jean Jacques Germain. My old school is Beauxbatons." the boy said, rolling his Rs and shaking Draco's hand. "The same school as Fleur Delacour, so to speak."
Harry looked in his eyes and apparently stopped breathing. He kept eyeing his lips and his heart was racing. They looked as though they were about to kiss. But it wasn't what Draco had in mind, since he pushed the shorter boy to the ground.
There it is, Draco thought. He still thinks I'm the worst git to have ever lived. He's going to break up with me this very moment.
"Lastly, this school is where I ask her to marry me." Ron finished, then he got down on one knee and showed a ring box to Hermione.
"Well, if it makes you feel better, I'm not that relaxed, either... with Ginny and all... and I feel like I'm introducing you to my parents, really." Harry chuckled nervously.
Draco was quick enough to grab his arm. "None of this was a lie! Harry, what you saw was sexual harassment, if anything-"
Harry felt a strong sense of jealousy gnawing at his insides when he saw that Draco had just patted the French boy's shoulder playfully.
That year, in addition to it, the Headmistress had organised a Graduation Speech, which meant that the Prefects from each House had to speak in regarding of their experience in Hogwarts.
Draco wasn't ecstatic to see her, but he couldn't be too mad at her, not when she had snowflakes all over her face.
"Woo! Happy New Year!" Ron screamed, clapping his hands at the sight of the Dragon-shaped fireworks.
"I picked him!" Hermione intervened, smiling. She was holding a book, which Ron must have given her as a gift.
"I knew that something was up!" Pansy shouted, " But never, for the life of me, I could have predicted this!" She pointed her finger from Draco to Harry, then back to Draco. "Potter? Really, Draco?"
All doubt was cleared when a sling figure stepped into the dining room, shaking the ashes off of themselves.
After that, he woke up sweating. "Oh no..." It was only a dream and Harry hated himself so, so much for it. How could he just have dreamed of snogging Malfoy, of all people? And how could he let himself like it? It was just his mind playing games, cause there was no way that he could ever think those things in real life. He could only hope that he hadn't made a sound during his sleep. He was wrong.
"So, instead of talking to us about him into making our ears bleed," Luna began, "Why don't you just talk to him?"
Then, he told them all about him, omitting the details about the weird questions, as he didn't want Harry to worry.

"Oh I can't be too surprised, my dear friend." said Luna. "He literally ogled him all the time. I don't think the nargles had anything to do with it, at this point." Luna raised her shoulders.
"I did this just for you. I mean I know she's better than your dad, but... Are you sure she's completely honest with you?" Said Harry, expressing his concerns.
"I know that, silly." Draco purred. "Althought I'm shocked that a Gryffindor like you isn't willing to have some outdoor fun. I thought your kind was known for being adventurous." He joked.
Plus, Harry's excitement upon seeing the love of his life speak highly of his favourite place in the world had momentarily distracted him from his sadness.
They ran out the classroom as fast as they could, although they were terrified that in that period of time Ginny and Pansy had already leaked the photo throughout the whole school.
"I don't really care." Harry replied with a shrug. "I just feel so euphoric when we kiss. Eh,even by simply being with him, really. I mean just look at him smile... it might sound shocking, but... Draco's really sweet once you get to know him."
The Slytherin was as nervous as can be. This was the first contact with his parents in four months. Sure, it would not be positive, but, at least, they remembered that they had a son.
Mr and Mrs Weasly hadn't been informed about the true reason behind their son's engagement to Hermione, so they just thought that it was Ron's way to settle down and take things seriously.
Minutes later, both girls rushed downstairs as the clock stroke five minutes to the beginning of the new year.
They were both sitting in one of the leather sofas of the Slytherin common room, discussing Draco's misadventure of the night before.
Draco could hardly believe his ears. Harry had just said that he would sleep in his dorm, therefore he had to walk through the Slytherin common room.
Oh. Draco formed an 'O' with his mouth at the realization. This was the first time, ever, in which he had called him by name. And it felt kind of weird. But a good kind of it.
Ginny couldn't help laughing out loud at that. "I was just going to say that there's something in the air that made our boys go crazy. All jokes aside, I'm so happy for you, bro and sis!" she said, addressing her brother and his now fiancée. She then hugged them both tightly.
While looking for a beautiful ring to add to my collection, I was congratulated by the seller for your wedding. I was confused at first, but then he told me that Mr Potter had bought the engagement ring right there, in his shop."
It was beautiful, the light in her room made her pale body shine, thus looking like she was made of marble.
They let Hermione and Ron sleep in Hermione's room, on the condition that they had to leave the door open.
"Then put your pride aside and talk to him! Tonight, at Hogsmeade, before that giga Nargle brainwashes him!" Luna exclaimed, stomping her fork in her chicken.
So much had changed in their lives since then, who would have known that ten months later they would be standing in front of each other, ready to tie the knot.
He needed some air, as the thought of this father was enough to make him incredibly anxious. He was sure that he would have had a panic attack if he had stayed in that bed. So, he slowly lifted Harry's arm and went on to slither out of his grasp.
"Dear Ginevra Weasley," she said, pulling out a piece of parchment from her pockets and starting to read it. "my love and best friend, ever since the day I met you, which was September 1st, 1992, I became mesmerized by you. You hit me like a tidal wave, honestly.
"Oh Crap! What time is it?" Draco said. He sat up suddenly. "Tempus!" He muttered and gasped as he read '10:00am'. "Oh no, Draco! We missed our first classes! And we'll be late for potions!"
So, Lucius really did come to Hogwarts to talk to Draco. The boy was hoping that this fear of him visiting him would not come true. But now, his father was there, for him. He felt like he could faint at any minute. "Oh, no." He murmured. He was shaking and breathing irregularly.
"I know, but it won't be the same! We have so many memories here, together!" Harry said, his voice still broken from crying.
"Thank you, my loves! This will be my way of thinking of you every time I'll miss you." Ginny expressed.
"Are you talking to your hair? Oh, not again! We're late, babe, for goodness sake, hurry!" An annoyed voice said, along with a loud knock on the door.
He had found true love and he wanted to hold on to it as much as he could, therefore, getting married would only reinforce this bond.
If he kept him on his good side, if he was able to please him enough, Lucius would reward him with expensive gifts, like new brooms or antiques.
The redhead sighed softly. Her girlfriend's act had actually made her feel all warm and fuzzy inside. She felt protected by her.
"Then let's do this!" Harry said, quite excitedly. He reached for Draco's hands and held them in his own. "I'm messed up, too. See, we complete each other."
Ginny noticed her friend's hopeful yet scary look. She didn't know, if she had to be honest. Although, her brother wasn't certainly known for being the bravest man the Wizarding World had even seen. The chances of him running away were high.
Draco could barely believe it. They were husbands and they would be for the rest of their lives together. There was nothing that he looked forward to more. Simply growing old with the love of his life was something that he couldn't wait for.
"Yeah, but we have many things to do... You need to change into muggle clothes before my Gran can see us... she's coming to collect us in London. Did you pack everything in? Harry, did you put Viridis in the owlery? Did you all get Toothbrushes? My parents are dentists, they care about dental hygiene..." the only girl in the group babbled.
"I do hope you're right. Now, about our plot, is it sensible for me to act after you do?" Lucius questioned.
He wasn't mad at him, not anymore. When the words "Petrificus Totalus!" had come out of his mouth, he had felt betrayed by him. But now, he could only feel pitiful for him.
"Thank you, baby." She said, as she climbed on the carriage. "I trust Harry on this, but Draco..." she gave her friend a look. Draco had never had anything to do with muggles, so he was a real beginner. She was worried that he would do something that would give them away.
"Ginny!" Harry called while running to her. Pansy was the one holding the camera, apparently waiting for the whole school to be in the room before acting. They had made it, they were in time. Ginny had her wand ready.
"Yeah, good idea. She's not that happy with you... she confessed that she didn't feel wanted by you lately... or ever. She said she doesn't feel like you are attracted to her."
"Oh come on, babe, why do you care? The Room of Requirement is much bet- oh, Luna!" Ron awkwardly greeted the girl, who stopped twirling around to run to the couple.
Draco hated Harry for his ability to bring him to tears. Hell, he had been able to avoid crying through the whole of the confrontation with Lucius, yet, at Harry's words, his eyes rained teardrops like a British shower.
Luna was the best girlfriend in the world, if anyone thought they had a better girlfriend, they were wrong.
Molly shook her head. "No, but I noticed something in the air was... different. And besides, mama knows best!"
And then Pansy. Why the hell had he decided to become friends with her in the first place? She'd always had an enormous crush on him, which had made her so disgustingly attached to him.
But, just when he was about to fall into a blissful sleep, he was interrupted by a much dreaded voice.
I was determined not to be found out, but, apparently I let something slip - I was being too evasive with Draco.
"Oh she's fine." Bill responded. "She's helping mum with some preparations for tomorrow." His attention then settled on the others. "Hi Hermione, Luna! And of course, Harry!" Bill shook his hand. He didn't seem to have noticed Draco, so it was Draco who greeted him.
He didn't know how long he had been there when he heard someone come into the room. He suddenly opened his eyes and sat up, trying to cover his privates with his hands.
But what killed him the most were the memories. Their first kiss, their first time... the way their bodies intertwined with lust, the way Draco's kiss was enough to make him weak in the knees... all the time they had been cute, their ice skating date, Christmas, kissing in the middle of a Quidditch match...
"How long have you been holding this in ? You know damn well that I don't see eye to eye with the Slytherins!" his boyfriend said, in a rage, his jaw clenched
As he, Harry and the professor made their way to Slughorn's office, Draco felt as if he was heading straight to the pillory. This is what people who are sentenced to death must feel like upon their arrival at the execution site.
One Saturday morning Draco was determined to ask his boyfriend to stay there with him and spend Christmas together.
"It is worth it because every day I have something to live for. You're the reason I get up in the morning because I know that, with you, my life will have a meaning." He started. "I lost my family, my house mates... but it is worth it because I love you, more than anything. I never knew love or friendship before you and I won't let that French idiot ruin all of this!"
Ginny would replay every move that her idol made, wishing that, one day, she would play alongside her.
"Attention, everyone!" The Headmistress shouted, getting up from her seat, her palms up. "As you know, next year most of you will be coming back within these walls, but for some of our students today is a very melancholic day. With great honour, I present you our Seventh-years valedictorians! First one to start, miss Hermione Granger" She gave a rigorous applause.
