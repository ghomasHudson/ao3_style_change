“I told you about me so that you know that I won’t go around outing you. I realize that you probably don’t even want me to know about it and I am sorry for overhearing it okay?”
Hermione and Pansy gently pried Harry from Draco’s lap, laying him on the empty couch next to them. The git had fallen asleep. Finally having had enough for one evening, Draco stood and turned to leave, nearly running from the room, when Harry mumbled something in his sleep.
Why he even bothered worrying about the git was beyond him, it’s not like they had agreed on a set date when he would visit again. There was no reason for him to flip his shit when the saviour didn’t visit for 10 days. It hadn’t even been 2 weeks, just because Harry had come around every 3-5 days in the past weeks didn’t mean he would continue to do so. “Get a grip Draco,” he chastised himself and kept cleaning, stoically ignoring the hard on he still had.
His heart jumped when he heard someone stumble through the common room, footsteps coming closer. All the work Draco had just put into regulating his breathing vanished, and then there was a knock on his door.
“Fancy a fight? I promise not to cheat” Malfoy asks, smirking at him. “I know how much it annoyed you when I cheated.”
Draco was almost comfortable sitting with the three of them. After a few minutes he stopped scanning the Hall for potential threats and allowed himself to enjoy his breakfast.
Malfoy silently stared at him for a few moments, then he spoke through gritted teeth, “That’s your big trick? A better memory? Did you honestly think that I didn’t know that? How many fucking content moments do you think I’ve had in my life, huh? After THAT!” Malfoy pointed to his left arm. His voice had gotten gradually louder until he was yelling at Harry.
As suspected, Pansy sat at her favourite spot, one of the tables by the window facing the courtyard. When Draco saw that she was sitting with Hannah Abbott, the Patil twin from Ravenclaw and Hermione Granger of all people, he stopped dead in his tracks.
“Don’t worry, Chris accidentally hit his nose. He will be fine, but it wouldn’t do to ruin the mats now, would it?” Malcolm says with a chuckle and asks them to switch partners again to start a new
Within moments he felt hands on his sides, roaming his torso and pulling him closer. Draco forgot the audience and when he felt the hands wander to grab at his hips, he relented control and lost himself in the kiss, the taste of Firewhiskey on both their lips.
Over the years he added some more figures to his collection and now also had a mermaid, a pixie even a thestral, though the latter went by the name pegasus once they lay in his display; he was living in a muggle neighbourhood after all. He sang along to the radio while he rolled out the dough and cut the cookies.
McGonagall didn’t look surprised in the slightest when Draco stayed behind after Transfiguration yet again. She simply motioned for him to follow her through to her office, and put the kettle on. Despite the odd familiarity of the situation, Draco didn’t sit. He lingered behind one of the armchairs facing the desk.
Granger still didn’t look convinced so Draco jumped into the more theoretical side of each potion ingredient in their assignment, knowing the witch would soak up any detail he offered her. Knowledge was knowledge after all, even if it came from him. The more he talked, the more relaxed he and the girls became. Maybe this could end without a disaster for once.
“Potter, you have to grab his collar but you don’t use it for the actual choke. All contact you have with his neck is via your thumb tendon and your wrist,” he corrects and turns to Chris with a questioning look, “May I?”
“Yes Draco, please. Oh my god please move. Fuck me, please!” begged Harry all while still grinding onto him.
He only realised that he must have been swaying, when Pansy gently touched his hand and said, “Sit down darling. It’s okay.”
Christmas morning Draco woke to presents from his mother, and an angry bond. His insides felt as if they were being pulled out of his chest, his hands and feet were ice-cold.
Potter only nodded solemnly, and Draco dropped the topic. Both went back to silently working on their assignments. Draco was working on his astronomy notes for the next day, while Potter was still finishing the potions assignment due the next morning, occasionally interrupting Draco to ask some clarifying questions about it.
He gladly turns his attention to the middle when Malcolm calls to demonstrate the next hold. His gratitude only lasts a moment though as he realises that Malfoy isn’t acting as the choked partner but as the instructor this time. His smooth voice carries through the room as Malfoy explains his moves step by step.
He didn’t take much notice as Pansy sat herself down next to him. She reached for his hand, gripping it tightly in hers, “Breathe darling. Just breathe”
Harry was certain that the Slytherin had meant it as an insult but Harry couldn’t help but take it as a challenge: Time to give Malfoy a Patronus-worthy memory.
Draco and Gemma remained on the sofas in the sitting area, but before their silence could turn awkward, Gemma turned to face him properly.
An hour and a half later and Harry had produced a respectable batch of pepper-up. After a quick series of diagnostic charms, Draco deemed it safe enough to test the potion himself and he scooped a small glass full. Almost immediately after swallowing did his ears started to give off the signature steam and he felt wide awake.
Draco shook his head, not willing to look up and show his tears. Suddenly he was glad that he had opted to wear his hair loose that day, the strands hid his face from view just then.
field of expertise, Draco gathered his confidence together and changed tactics. He pulled out an empty piece of parchment and began taking notes.
“Rules are simple. It’s basically truth or dare but adapted to make it fair. First off: No choosing your next victim, we will spin a wand to discern who goes next. Second off: Every question or dare can be evaded by taking a shot. And third off, everyone playing has to take a sip of veritaserum.”
And just like that there were butterflies in Draco’s stomach. No longer surprised by their general existence, he revelled in the tingling sensation, letting his mind do a little happy dance at the compliment.
The constricting and contracting of the walls around his cock was enough to drive Draco over the edge as well, as he buried himself deep into Harry.
And there sitting next to him was Harry, clenching his empty glass with a shaking hand, looking absolutely confused and slightly horrified. Realising what must be going on, Draco shot Blaise a glare, willing him to take the attention off of the Gryffindor, who was starting to look green by then.
“Never have I ever tried something kinky.” Draco stated on his turn and reached for his glass. He trusted the spell to discern the general consensus of what was considered kinky but knew he would have to drink no matter what. His fake-firewhiskey turned out to be spiced apple juice.
Malcolm kneels behind Malfoy, who kneels just as rigid as he had for the greeting. Malcolm calmly instructs them on the do’s and don'ts of choking holds as he explains how to use the collar or the tendon of the thumb to restrict the blood flow while leaving enough space so as not to crush the windpipe.
His lips felt like they were dosed with liquid luck; tingles raced through his body, electrifying every movement he made and every point of contact. Gasping as Harry shuffled himself closer still, he felt Harry hum in appreciation, almost shyly exploring his mouth with his tongue. Draco forgot how to function, forgot everything aside from the feeling of Harry on top of him. He could taste a hint of firewhiskey on the other’s tongue and smell the somewhat familiar smell of Harry’s shampoo.
“If anything happens to me, McGonagall will know it was you, so don’t you dare fucking touch me,” he growled before turning to face the wall and block out Malfoy and his damn Lumos.
My lovely, wonderful, fantastic beta Monika made some snarky comments while reading through this the first time and I am honestly living for them. Check out the end for it.
To his surprise Harry woke to his wand ringing on his side of the bed. Alone. Or well, as alone as one gets when sharing a bed with someone. At least they weren’t touching. So he got up, grabbed his clothes for the day and went into the bathroom.
Once again, Draco remained silent. Now wasn’t the time to tell Potter about the nights he had spent lying awake and half heartedly wishing to have died instead of Vince. If he thought about it with a clear head, he was glad too; glad that Potter had managed to pull him out of the fire. Despite the challenges life after the war posed for him, he was glad to be able to live it, and he was acutely aware that it was only due to Potter.
Draco shifted in place at the offer, unable to form an adequate reply. McGonagall seemed to understand though, as she continued on, “Now I don’t claim to understand what you have been through, but I am here for you should you need someone to talk to. I know that things aren’t always the way they may seem on the outside, especially in times of war.”
Potter had forgiven him. Potter believed him. Potter thought that Draco deserved to not suffer anymore.
“This may seem like a lot but we will start small. Everyone please kneel down, we’ll start from a lower height and work ourselves up. It’s more rolling than anything else.”
They just sat like that for a while, Draco repeating his reassurances in his head. Once he was somewhat calm and sorted, he timidly thanked his mother. What for? He wasn’t exactly sure of himself. It just felt necessary.
Despite rolling his eyes, Draco felt touched that Harry had noticed his absence at dinner. Maybe even missed him. His shoulder was warm where Harry had touched it.
and in the window he could see a wall filled with art, some black and white, some with colours. It finally clicked in his mind that he was looking at a muggle tattoo place and his heart raced.
“It’s fine Draco. I sometimes need to be forced into things for my own good. It’s how we always handled it.” Harry then turned to Hermione. “You can’t tell anyone else though. Let Draco tell Pansy on his own terms and I’m really not comfortable with anyone else knowing just yet.”
The warm water of the shower had temporarily calmed him and had helped with the hair situation, but all of that calm was about to become undone again — he didn’t know what to wear. Going back to his school uniform would be stupid, they were done for the day and besides, his robes were still wrinkled anyways. Nothing a good ironing charm couldn’t fix but still. There was no need to rub his Slytherin-ness into their faces.
Suddenly Draco was glad that he was already lying on the floor, because by the way his head was swimming at Harry’s declaration, he would have surely fallen if he had been standing.
Draco had thought falling had been exciting but now he was flying. Soaring freely through the air, the chains keeping him down had finally snapped and he was free. He didn’t understand.
“I… I’ll think about it. Thank you.” he replied, not looking at Granger.. A party seemed impossible. Too many people, especially too many people with good reasons to hate him.
“As in all three of you?” Draco wondered. He knew that Blaise wasn’t one for jealousy, but having multiple partners seemed a lot further than simply not being jealous. When Draco received nothing more than a nod as an answer he shrugged, it wasn’t his problem to understand how it had happened and he wasn’t one to prod for details. If Blaise wanted to talk about it, he would.  “Huh, congratulations, I think. Hope you’re happy and all.”
If his calculations were right, he would only have to endure 15 more meetings before he was allowed to live his life in peace. 15 more meetings and maybe, just maybe he could start healing.
“The hair. The colour. The piercings. All of it. It suits you. I realized I never told you.” Harry clarified.
“But I still don´t know why you did it. This is far too elaborate to be a prank and -” the git had the audacity to laugh. His face coming nearer.
Once again Draco was the first of the study group to sit down but he was quickly joined by Hannah, Neville and Blaise, the three of them sitting in their usual spot across from him, leaving the space next to him for Hermione and Pansy.
I just came back from a rather exhausting day outside (minor sunburn included) and now I'm completely knackered, but I still wanted to update. Hope you like this chapter.
Contrary to the last time, it was the students whispering as if Draco was a rumour or cryptid. By the time he reached the train, there were the first few adults joining in on the whispers, complaining about him.
Draco sat on the opposite end of the brown couch Potter was occupying and pulled his knees to his chest. A little voice in the corners of his mind commented that someone must have taught the Gryffindor some emotional intelligence, as the man sat silently with his eyes trained onto one of the many magical windows, leaving Draco with a semblance of privacy to pull himself together.
An hour later Harry was stuck. He knew why he had avoided doing the potions work, who cared whether he chopped, ground or finely sliced the ingredients? In the end the stuff would be in small pieces and mixed into a bunch of other stuff. But apparently that was not how potions worked and now he had to explain exactly why that. Bloody fantastic.
scratches against it. They are learning the falling exercises themselves in a moment, and hurling himself into the ground at high speed just doesn’t sound fun. Malcolm senses the hesitation from his four trainees and switches tactics.
Both Draco and Pansy looked up at her sudden outburst, Draco having a distinct look of fear in his eyes.
Harry retreated back to Ron and Hermione but kept his eyes trained on Malfoy anyway. By the end of the lesson Malfoy had, once again, not produced the slightest of silver mist. Harry watched him trudging out of the classroom with his head bowed.
He felt himself getting dizzy, his heart pumping way too fast and all his nerves on edge. He hurriedly capped his ink bottle and threw his stuff into his bag. With wobbly legs he practically ran from the library, the laughter of the Gryffindors trailing behind him.
On Saturday morning Draco found himself once again being dragged towards the Great Hall for breakfast. It was way too early but after how hopeful and proud Pansy had sounded after the study meeting on Thursday, Draco couldn’t bring himself to shoot her down. He had promised to try and this was him trying; keeping his promise. Hermione joined them in the Great Hall and listening to Hermione and Pansy bickering, Draco could almost forget his fears.
“Is it always that exhilarating?” he asked, falling into his chair and finally starting to unpack his potions book.
Two hours later Granger had finally stopped asking questions in every small talking break he took. This was the most interaction he had with any human being for a long time now. Well at least if one doesn’t count getting yelled at and berated by one’s parole officer, which Draco indeed didn’t count.
“I’d take the three weeks of silence. I could still communicate via writing if needed, so not much of a disadvantage.” A shrug from Pansy indicated that she considered his turn done and so Draco turned to Blaise, who chose truth as well.
it is easier to fight someone close to your own weight and height.” he explains. Moments later he gives the command to start and Harry is left with the single focus to pin Chris to the ground.
“Don’t! It’s not your fault and Pansy only told because she found you unconscious in the dorms and Madame Pomfrey couldn’t get you to wake up. I came as soon as I could…” Harry broke off. His eyebrows were drawn together and he nervously chewed on his bottom lip. “Merlin you were so damn cold. It took an hour for you to even get close to a normal temperature.”
Their rutting increased until Harry broke the kiss in favour of throwing his head back and moaning, a low rumble spreading from his chest. The sound of Harry lost in pleasure sent Draco over the edge as well, and he came with stuttering hips and a low groan.
A shoulder rammed into Harry’s, even though the hallway was wide enough for all four of them to be able to walk next to each other without accidentally touching.
“I was planning on getting some Ancient Runes work done before the study group session today.” Draco replied. Careful to not appear like he was running away, Draco picked up his pace again. It was too bloody cold out.
To his own surprise, Draco found himself walking down to the Great Hall for breakfast on Wednesday. The eighth years had Astronomy on Tuesday evenings and therefore a free period on Wednesday mornings. As the rest of the school had classes, Draco thought it safe, having accepted that he had to get his fears under control. He didn’t want to rely on Pansy the whole year. Although he thought himself a coward for only going to the Hall when he knew that the chance of meeting people was next to none.
The game continued for another few turns until it reached the younger Ravenclaw, who had previously asked about the unusual usage of spells. “I think I am done for the evening.” She said and a few others nodded at the sentiment. Most had kept to Firewhiskey the whole time and were now fairly drunk, so Draco didn’t blame them. As a mutual decision the group chose to stop playing altogether, everyone getting up to gather in smaller groups again.
Draco’s hands were shaking, his eyes still decidedly fixated onto his feet and the small space in front of them. With his heart racing and his lip bitten raw, he stepped onto the train and immediately began looking for one of his friends. In the end he found most of them in the same compartment in the back.
“It might surprise you, but you do need to eat sometimes. Shocking, I know.” Harry said with fake confidence, gesturing to the plate in his hand.
“Well then let’s plan our sessions. We can use the study group time for theory although we should maybe add another afternoon to that. And then Friday evenings we could do some practical stuff every now and then.” His mind was already racing to where they could brew.
Draco Malfoy will put his Potions Mastery to good use as Hogwarts newest Potions Professor, taking over the position from Professor Sion Armado. Harry Potter on the other hand will be teaching his specialty, Defense against the Dark Arts. Despite not having a Defense Mastery, Mister Potter is well equipped for his newest adventure.
Harry conceded and settled for dismantling the muffliato and walking over to the other table. Watching avidly, Draco saw Harry whisper to Hermione and Hermione in turn giving Harry a supporting nudge. He then heard Harry say, “Uhm so. I guess I just wanted to say that I’m bisexual.”
“Sorry for ruining your Christmas. I- had told Pansy to keep you out of it.” he said as he looked down at his lap.
“The offer to help me with my Patronus? Wilkins said I needed to get at least some mist in order to pass.”
“I cast a muffliato in case we started arguing at some point.” Potter said, eyes still glued to the potions book. The consideration left Draco speechless.
Draco was getting close when Harry pulled off and trailed kisses along his inner thigh. He had been about to complain when Harry stood up and leaned over him, grabbing his chin and confidently said, “Look at me and don’t move!” the words sending a shiver down Draco’s spine in anticipation and he swiftly nodded his head.
Within seconds of meeting her, Draco felt less anxious. The friendly smile and warm attitude he was met with were rare outside of the eighth years common room and it was refreshing to meet someone that didn’t already know him, although Healer Hay- Gemma had most likely heard about Draco before.
Taking a deep breath, he began walking towards the girls again. There were books scattered all across the table, and a scroll in front of each girl. Abbott was leaning over Patil, looking at the book the Ravenclaw was currently reading out of. Pansy seemed to be deep in discussion with Granger.
1. We will all take turns making a statement that starts with ‘Never have I ever’ and if you have done whatever follows after that, you take a drink.
Draco’s head was rearing. Logically he could understand the reasoning but he was still a bit miffed, since technically Narcissa should have inherited the official title of Lady Black. He pushed the thought away, not knowing if his mother even wanted the title or any of the heirlooms. It wasn’t his problem and the death of his second cousin was far enough in the past that Narcissa must have known about the inheritance. If she didn’t deem it necessary to breach the topic, then he wouldn’t either.
He barely noticed Hermione and Pansy joining him, too focussed on the fantasy world playing out right inside the pages in front of him. It took Pansy nudging him in the side repeatedly for him to snap out of it. Once he did, Hermione roped him into a discussion about the theory behind the charms they had covered on Friday.
“You do realize that this was your idea, right?”, voice perfectly cold, mouth turned into a sneer, not showing the nervousness.
“That was quick. Thank you for telling me, and congratulations on figuring it out.” he reached a hand out to squeeze Harry’s knee for a moment.
“Right, because you would have been so welcoming about me talking to you on the train, no preconceived notion, no nothing. Let’s just pretend we weren’t on opposite sides of a freaking war just weeks prior. Even if you did help me, someone would have accused me of controlling you and they would have thrown me into Azkaban!”
“Professor?” Draco asked. The rest of the transfiguration class had already left and McGonagall had busied herself at her desk. At the sound of his voice, she looked up.
“I’ll just add it to the list then.” Draco mumbled. An uneasy silence spread between them as Draco wrote, despite the general murmur of the common room. Nerves hit Draco when he finished with his tutoring notes. “You do realise that this will take more than just one or two afternoons, right? Do you really want
Draco woke to the sound of an owl pecking on his window. Groggily he got up and opened it. The barn owl looked ruffled and exhausted and Draco offered her his arm to rest on and to relieve her of her burden. Untying the scroll from her leg, he set the owl down on the dresser and summoned some owl treats.
The day so far has been rather hectic for a thursday. Only halfway through did he realize that the muggles had a school holiday and with the rather nice weather out, loads of them went to the park nearby to entertain their kids.
The game continued and after a few moments Draco began to relax. Nobody was actually asking anything meaner than a few childhood stories and any touchy subject was avoided. Draco himself didn’t get called on a lot and when he did the tasks or questions were easy - eat a handful of Bertie Bott’s, What’s your favourite book?
This chapter contains: verbal abuse and referenced physical abuse, referenced disordered eating and spiraling thoughts. Should any of this trigger you, proceed with care.
Draco laughed, rubbing at the spot on his arm. “I watched you the whole time you were brewing, you did well and I took no risk testing it.”
Potter, of course, did grab his hand and pulled him into a standing position. The skin to skin contact shocked Draco’s system and made him sway on the spot, which Harry seemed to interpret as Draco being too faint to walk by himself. So he pulled Draco’s arm over his shoulders, placing his own around Draco’s waist. Relishing in the contact and the resulting happy bond Draco simply leaned some of his weight onto Harry as if he was actually too weak to walk.
it. Merlin and Morgana, this was Malfoy! He definitely shouldn’t be getting hard listening to him, but his body betrayed him.
(The editorial staff asks once again that the public be respectful of Mister Potter’s privacy, especially regarding his choice of partner.)
Finally done with cleaning he slipped into his warm winter coat, grabbed his backpack, checked the bakery one last time before he was out the door and locking it behind him.
“Bruises? Did Officer… Morris, was it? Did he hit you?” The usual stern look on McGonagall’s face had evaporated, leaving only concern and some slivers of rage visible.
“There are wards that will alert me if you are hit with a spell or if you say ‘Fawkes’,” as promised wards shimmered around the room at the use of the trigger word. “While you have nothing to fear from Gemma, your reaction is understandable.”
His shaking fingers reached for the wand and he spun. It landed on Pansy. Eager to change the mood, he asked, “Truth or Dare?” even though he knew that she would pick dare. He was right.
“Due to the testimony of Mr. Harry James Potter, and the willingness of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall to assist in the implementation, the Wizengamot sentences the prosecuted, Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy, to two years of Parole under the condition that Mr. Malfoy agrees to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry to complete his education.”
His hands were shaking as Draco packed away his transfiguration notes. Before he even finished packing his bag, both Hermione and Pansy were by his side.
As promised, there was a spellbook text, copied neatly in his mother’s clear cursive. The distinction between book text and his mother’s annotation made clear with a simple change of handwriting. Reading through the instructions twice, Draco wondered why his mother never went into spell invention. It was clear how much thought she had put into this simple spell, taking maintainability and magic levels into account so as not to drain magical energy to keep up the spell.
“You’re wrong. I could have. I do know…. I- I saw it. Or well some of it.” Dark hands scratched a dark neck and then all air left Potter all at once, “I sometimes had visions from Voldemort’s perspective, and I saw some of the shit that happened — what he did to you… I should have known it might shock you. I’m sorry.” Potter admitted, still stumbling for words.
“But think of your reputation, I would ruin your relationship with anyone in this school…” he tried reasoning.
“No need. Those were… rewards.” Blaise gestured to his wrists with his chin and then winked at Draco. “Apparently Neville thinks we look fucking hot together.”
With reluctance they pulled apart and by unspoken agreement they walked back to Draco’s flat, the anticipation prickling between them like electricity.
Harry returned to the living room with two mugs precariously stacked on top of each other and an arm full of alcohol. Malfoy’s shoes stood neatly next to the couch while the owner had pulled his feet up onto it. The odd domesticity of the whole situation left Harry speechless but nonetheless he sat down in one of the armchairs, A flick of his wand lit a fire in the fireplace.
When he felt Harry’s chest press against his back and an arm snake around his middle, it took all his concentration to not immediately melt.
“Uhm. No.” Draco admitted only then realizing his lack of plan. “I’m not really set on a motive yet, but I want it to cover something else.” His brain was already running through possible ideas he hadn’t known he had.
What next? Impulse-control. Just look at your stupid head line, it barely reaches your middle finger but gets deeper towards the middle. Hence it’ll get better but never great. And for your success I wouldn’t even have to look into your palm. You are famous I would have been surprised if your sun line wouldn't be so deep and prominent. What’s interesting is your fate line being shallow, so successful - maybe even talented, but we’re still talking about you so let’s just stick with successful - but never really feeling safe. Blame it on the childhood trauma or whatever.” The Slytherin monologued.
after all. He had been there, he had supported the maniac. It didn’t matter that it was against his will.
Needing to stage run-ins with Potter twice a day without raising suspicion, seemed impossible, but somehow Draco managed it for nearly a week.  His inevitable doom arrived on Saturday, when Potter left the castle with Granger to meet the Weasel in town and didn’t return until long after dinner.
The moment Harry feels Chris grabbing his collar for the choke, he knows he is screwed. Harry has always been sensitive on his neck and apparently that isn’t just limited to kisses and soft touches. Chris pulls his collar tight and Harry feels himself getting aroused. He wills his cock down with some concentration and the mental image of Dudley eating.
“I know I said it before, but thank you.” Draco declared after a few minutes of silence. “For saving me. Not only in here, but at the trials too. I know I would be dead or in Azkaban if it weren’t for you. I owe you for that.”
and you will stop when one of you is pinned down or one of you says stop. Is that clear? Remember, you want to pin your partner down and not hurt them, try to get them into the holding techniques we covered already or get creative.”
“What are you doing here? Why are you following me?” Harry hissed, wand still raised. The shock and confusion on Malfoy’s face vanished and a spiteful laugh escaped his lips.
They made their way towards the Great Hall, their footsteps echoing in the empty hallways. When they reached the first floor Draco could have sworn his heart was convinced it could escape his chest if it simply sped up enough. He paused on the first step and concentrated on his breathing.
“I- no. It is not your responsibility to keep track of what makes me freak out. You couldn’t have known so there is no need to apologise.” Draco began.
“Uhm. Yeah.” Draco admitted and told the group the gist of his hair, piercing and tattoo adventure, mentally making a note to thank Hermione and Pansy for going to McGonagall about Morris once he was alone with them. The compartment door opened just as Pansy demanded that Draco show them his new tattoo.
“Do you have any recommendations where I could read up on it? I don’t necessarily want to theoretically blow up my potion like I did last week.” Potter’s question broke through Draco’s silent musing. The sentiment actually surprised him.
Feeling resigned and slightly nervous, Harry got into bed inches from Malfoy, placing his wand under his pillow.
When no explanation of what the other needed to know followed, Draco cocked his head. “Then ask.” he said softly.
The somber story dampened the mood a bit until Luna decided to skip Weasley’s turn. “Never have I ever used a strap-on with a partner.” she said and Draco heard multiple people gasp at the unusually crass words out of her mouth. Even more gasped when she lifted both her and Weasley’s glass from the floor. Pansy and Hermione were also drinking.
They had finished the main course and Draco was in high spirits. The food was excellent, Harry was surprisingly easy to talk to and on top of that easy on the eye. Against all expectations he really enjoyed himself.
“I…” Harry started, breaking off and then starting again. “I’ve been thinking about coming out all winter break,” he admitted shyly, “I did some research and some self-reflection and I’m absolutely certain that I’m bi.”
“We can always meet here,” Harry suggested, leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Hermione is so occupied with Pansy that she won’t really notice if I’m in my dorm or here anyways and Neville and Seamus never paid that much attention in the first place.”
That night, Draco thought about warm lips that tasted of Firewhiskey, green eyes that sparkled with joy and the weight of a head on his shoulder.
Harry spent all evening and night thinking about the Amortentia and of course about Malfoy. The ever circling thoughts about him shifted and Harry began thinking about the small dimple on Draco’s left cheek when he smiled, how his hand had felt around his wrist, how his lips formed his name. A memory wiggled itself in the forefront of his thoughts, a memory of kissing a blond muggle in a club last summer — the nameless and, at this point, faceless muggle man being swapped with Draco and suddenly Harry couldn’t stop thinking about it. He imagined what it would feel like to pull Draco closer, pressing his lips against his, tasting him. The smell of the Amortentia flooded back into his mind and Harry felt himself falling asleep to the memory of it.
Kissing Harry hadn’t lost any of it’s intensity. It still stole Draco’s breath away to feel the smooth warmth of Harry’s lips against his own — to taste him. Little sparks of electricity shot through Draco, making his fingertips tingle with the need to bury them in the messy black hair.
He cleaned the kitchen while he waited for the dough to rise but in the end he simply put a delayed stasis charm on the whole bowl and went back upstairs. While the kneading had indeed helped him clear his head, it had also left him covered with flour and he needed a shower before bed.
“We?” Draco said in between bites. “Who is we?” Helping her with Potions wasn’t that bad, he did that often enough.
“That fucking asshole.” she hissed and closed the door with more force than technically necessary. Once they were alone, she pulled him into a tight hug, leading Draco to wince and recoil, the tears he had kept at bay beginning to fall again. Pansy pulled away immediately.
“I guess.” Harry admitted, promising to think about it. He grabbed his bag from underneath his table and made to leave, turning at the door to look at Draco questioningly.
as her shoes fell to the floor, and seconds later Pansy lay behind him, arms immediately going around his waist.
Pansy grumbled something about “thick-headed asshole” and got out of the armchair, “For your sake I hope that you’re right, but I still doubt it.” She said and left.
“I want you to at least try to go down with us on Saturday, yeah? I won't force you to actually eat with us, but I want you to try. I could ask Blaise to join us if you want?” To his surprise Draco found the idea of Blaise joining them calming. Force in numbers or something. Besides, Blaise was still one of his best friends even if they weren’t as close as they used to be.
The shocked look on her face was priceless and Draco snickered. It shouldn’t surprise her this much that he knew, after all she spent all her time out of class either with him or Hermione or a combination thereof.
“Hello Draco.” she said, offering her hand. Her voice was soft but certain, her handshake firm. “Please call me Gemma. I don’t like all this formal Mrs. or Healer Hayes stuff.”
Draco looked up, he was nearly finished with the assignment when the disgusted insult made him look up. A few tables over a group of Gryffindor 5th years had finally registered his presence. Draco recognised them immediately, they had threatened him on multiple occasions, taunting him with the knowledge that Draco wasn’t allowed to do any offensive or defensive magic outside of the classrooms. Draco had stopped going anywhere partly due to them.
At least that was what Harry told himself after waking to a sleeping Draco cuddling him for the third time in five days. A quick tempus told him that it was early enough to justify going back to sleep again, at least for a little bit. So instead of gently extracting himself from the arm placed around his middle, he stayed, snuggling back into the covers and fell back asleep.
The workstation was practically spotless, when Draco’s brain wandered to the Christmas Party once again, reminding him of something.
Harry had to admit he was impressed. It made sense but he would have never been able to deduce that much from just a few palm indents. And Malfoy hadn’t even needed the book.
Pansy dropped her attitude and sat next to him, giving Draco a one armed side-hug, “Halfway there is amazing progress darling,” she tried to reassure, “Of course I’ll bring you some food. Any requests?”
Malcolm calls their attention back to the middle and asks them to switch partners and try their hands at a floor
In a much calmer manner he placed one hand on Harry’s neck while his other sneaked onto his lower back, pulling him closer and almost dipping him slightly. Gently yet determined he kissed Harry again, licking tentatively at his lower lip after a few moments.
Understanding dawned on her features and Draco could practically feel her eyes taking him in more purposefully now. “Very well. How about I take you to a hairstylist tomorrow? You do look rather… unfortunate with that haircut.”
This chapter deals with Anxiety, Canon violence (such as sectumsempra and general references to canon occurences) as well as scars.
Harry wanted to reassure him, flee from the awkward conversation but Malfoy beat him to an answer. “Please, you wouldn’t come out like this if nothing had happened last night. Just say what you have against me and what you want.”
Draco watched in wonder as Harry proceeded to take out comfort food after comfort food, peppered with his favourite Hogwarts kitchen specials. With a jolt he realized that Harry had known exactly what to ask for, and was touched that Harry knew him well enough to know his taste. Once Harry had unpacked all there was, Draco reached for one of the muffins that was recommended by the house elf. While he was planning on eating something more proper after, he could really do with the sugar and comfort right then.
“Okay. How much do you know about ingredient properties?” His quill was flying over the parchment, outlining the Potions curriculum of all their school years, categorizing as he went.
This month of hiding had taken its toll on him. Draco had begun to avoid the crowded Great Hall, skipping essentially every meal except breakfast and the occasional snack he took from the breakfast table. He had gotten thinner, his lean body began to look gaunt.
Absent-mindedly he fed her a few treats, wondering who would send him a letter. With an even mixture of curiosity and dread, he opened the letter and began reading.
Pansy arrived back with the potion and added that there would be a spell, keeping everyone from speaking to anyone outside of the game about what happened during the game.
‘Now for the exciting part!’ he thought as he braced himself for the time consuming task of decorating the cookies. The piping bags were one of the few magical things about his bakery. He had multiple for the different colours and any icing inside of them would always have the perfect consistency and they weren’t nearly as messy as muggle piping bags. They cleaned themselves on command and they even had adjustable piping tips that could be changed with a simple spell.
Draco could only nod. The dread of his upcoming meeting was already sucking all the energy and confidence from him, and it hadn’t even started yet. With a last deep breath he grabbed the offered floo powder and stepped into the fireplace. With a quiet “Ministry of Magic” he vanished into the green flames.
Another 20 minutes later and he closed his books, there was only so much extra work he could put into a two word reference. Pansy looked up from her Runes table. “Oh you done? That fits perfectly, I only need to finish this sentence and then we could start with Potions. Hermione is basically finished too and Blaise and Hannah said to simply interrupt them whenever we’re ready.”
When Malfoy just stood there —  unmoving, not answering — Harry switched to what would hopefully be an easier topic than personal memories, “Have you tried meditating?”
He’s growing hard when he finally registers that Malfoy has basically just given him an out of their current position. Harry tries rolling backwards and lands on his knees behind Malfoys head. Before he can use the position to his advantage though, Malfoy shoots into a kneeling position and they start grappling again.
So Draco had dreaded his mother’s reaction, but the soft question that rang with care behind it hadn’t been what he had imagined. Disapproval or admonishment, yes, those he had prepared for. But care? No.
by Merlin. He regretted nearly everything he did in the last two years but what else could he have done? Refuse the mark, run away and leave his mother to... No. He could never have done that.
The stimulation soon became too much and Draco cried out with pleasure as he crested the peak of his orgasm, screaming out his lover's name while coming all over himself. Three strokes later Harry joined him in bliss, his come mixing with Dracos, and Draco’s name on his lips.
The big table in the common room seemed too small with Pansy and Hermione spread out in one corner. Blaise, Hannah, and Neville were claiming the other side, with Susan joining in on their discussion every now and then. And then there were Draco and Potter, trying to find enough space for their assignments, quills, inkwells and potions books. In the end the two of them switched to the smaller table a few feet away.
Chris gives him the go ahead and Harry does his best to focus on what Malfoy is showing him this time. When Harry tries it again, Chris taps out after mere seconds and Malfoy smiles at him before continuing to the next trainee pair.
“I know my darling.” came Narcissa’s reply, no hint of surprise or negativity in her voice. “I’m glad you finally feel safe enough to tell me.”
“MALFOY?” louder this time, something shook Draco and it took him a moment to realise that Potter must have grabbed his shoulder. Slowly, far too slowly, Draco’s pain receded and he gained his consciousness back. He mumbled a response to Potters incessant shaking and immediately regretted it when Harry withdrew his hand. He wasn’t strong enough yet, he needed more contact.
Suddenly there was a hand on top of his own and only then did Draco notice that he had balled it into a fist. “Yes we are together.” Harry sighed in resignation.
Frustrated, Harry flipped Draco over onto the bed, pinning his hands above his head.  He kissed and bit his way down Draco’s chest and when he reached the top of his jeans, he paused his hands above the button and quirked an eyebrow at Draco who quickly nodded his head. He unfastened the button, pulled the zipper down and slid them down off his legs— together with the boxers — and tossed them behind him, off the bed.
Draco wanted to snort, he had just been away from Harry for nearly 20 hours and hadn’t felt a single side effect. The bond was plenty happy with the amount of contact he had with Harry now, to really complain. On top of that the bond was going to weaken considerably in the next few months. He really doubted that daily touch would be necessary.
“Why yes. Although it is not ideal it is better than forcing Miss Parkinson to leave mealtimes early each time. I still hope for you to someday join us back in the Great Hall for meal times but in the meantime I don’t wish for you to only live off of sandwiches or whatever Miss Parkinson can safely smuggle away.”
They disentangle themselves and face each other once more. Malfoy pushes the loose strands — more have escaped the braid during their fight — behind his ears.
Breakfast was a quiet affair after that, and Draco was glad. He felt oddly accomplished when he got up to get his books for the upcoming Charms lesson.
Draco walked out of the Ancient Runes classroom at an almost normal pace, his head down, eyes steadily trained on the corridor in front of him. A hesitant “Malfoy?” made him turn back.
When they pulled apart, there was a glittering in Harry’s eyes that made Draco fall for him all over again. The green of his irises seemed more vibrant than ever, and the slight flush on Harry’s cheeks provided a lovely contrast to them. Leaning his forehead against Harry’s, Draco muttered, “What are we doing?”
Mr.Morris was as charming as ever, which is to say: not at all. Draco disliked the man with a passion and those feelings were most definitely reciprocated. The parole officer was a chubby little fellow, his light brown hair had begun to make way for grey ones and baldness. He was easily old enough to be Draco’s father.
The waitress appeared once again, switching their empty plates with the dessert, a mini chocolate cake and some ice cream on each plate. The cake was still warm and chocolate poured out once Draco took a spoonfull. The ice cream turned out to be a raspberry sorbet and some high quality vanilla ice. The mixture of the rich dark chocolate cake with the sweet and fruity ice was heavenly. Hadn´t he just had a wonderful full meal, he could have eaten multiple plates of this.
The piercing had been another impulse decision while Toby had taken a break from tattooing. Leah had convinced him to get a ‘daith’ after ranting about how perfect his ear shape was for this specific piercing. Feeling daring Draco had accepted, shifting on the tattoo stool so that Leah could reach his ear better.
He turned to look back at Hogwarts for one last time. From his position in the boat, he could nearly see the whole castle and he felt his stomach flutter with nerves. It wouldn’t be his last time seeing it, he had already set up another meeting with McGonagall for his parole, and they had agreed to meet in the Headmistresses office, but he still felt weird knowing that he was officially done with school.
“Draco, I would also like you to know that I won’t accept any form of hateful behaviour, especially at that party. And that includes hateful behaviour against you, too. I don’t expect there to be any, but maybe knowing that someone would be there to back you up and support you, could help with your anxiety.”
He wasn’t. He only glanced up from his book long enough to see Harry step through the door before continuing with his reading. Harry had hoped that Malfoy had finally resigned himself to their situation, but all his hopes were crushed the moment he lay down in bed; Harry once again in his pajamas under the blanket, Malfoy sitting on top of the covers fully clothed except for shoes.
Over the years he had heard multiple of his mates have wet dreams of course — living in a dorm did that — but those had been his mates, not Malfoy. And none of them sounded as desperate or sinful and none of them had begged.
“I am not going to Pomfrey over this.” he stated flatly. He had lived through worse, a few bruises weren’t enough for him to rouse everyone.
Harry looks wide eyed into the mirror, following the trail of love bites along his neck and chest before turning his gaze back to Draco, who is lying on his stomach next to him. “I… kinda like it.” he admits and only then does he register the angry red marks covering Draco’s back.
Without even thinking about it, Draco answered, “No.” and when no one said anything else asked, “You were saying?” Still no reaction. “Something about Astoria Greengrass?”
. The moans rang loud in the otherwise silent living room and Draco had to concentrate not to come on the spot. He focussed all of his attention on stretching Harry, scissoring his fingers and reducing Harry into a quivering mess.
Draco stumbled into the Room of Requirement almost twenty minutes late. He had agreed to meet Harry there directly after dinner but he had lost track of time. His first official therapy session had taken place just before dinner and he had needed some time afterwards to collect his thoughts. When Draco had realised the time, dinner was over, but he still needed to eat. Opting to talk to Harry before going to the kitchen (so as not to keep him waiting), Draco had headed for the Room of Requirement.
“This wasn’t the first time you’ve been beaten up, was it?” Hermione asked once she finished the third diagnostic spell. Contrary to Pansy snapping her head to glare at Draco, Hermione was calm and collected.
Harry thinks about the offer for approximately 5 seconds before he checks to see if he is alone in the locker room, and apparates home. He briefly considers getting changed into more formal clothes instead of his worn-out jeans and shirt but decides against it. It isn’t a date, just a casual drink. Right?
It was only when Draco had closed the door to his room and was lying on his bed that he realised that he had just eaten a whole meal in the Great Hall, and the world hadn’t ended.
In the end, neither of them said anything and Potter excused himself, going back the way he came. Draco finally turned the last corner and let himself into the common room, he wanted to get started on the Herbology essay right away.
“So Neville and Hannah were sitting next to each other opposite him and none of them spoke to each other. Honestly you could have cut their silence with a knife. And then all of a sudden Blaise grabs his bag and tries to leave the table, Hannah reaches out and actually stops him from leaving. Blaise growls at her, Neville jumps in, probably defending her, and next thing I know Blaise yells at him to ‘go fuck himself’ rips his arm away and storms off. McG barely managed to refrain herself from docking points from Slytherin out of reflex.”
Another big grin spread across Harry’s face. “Of course! I just- Yes.” He laughed and Draco found himself joining in.
He took a deep breath, thinking of where to start. “On some level I always knew. And I know that isn’t helpful for you at all, but I was always aware that I liked boys a bit more than was conventional. And then in fourth year Pansy and I got together. I don’t know what we were thinking, it was probably more due to the fact that our families had begun marriage talks for us and we just… thought to give it a shot. We lasted all of six days until we were kissing and I just knew that I didn’t want her like that. It destroyed my last hope of at least being bi, since I already had fantasized plenty about different boys.  Then Blaise and I fell into bed together sometime in fifth year, and then there was just no denying it anymore.”
Please tell me your thoughts on this sstory or chapter, I'd love to hear what all of you think now that it is finally complete.
While Draco had expected the dare, Blaise apparently hadn’t. He looked at Pansy and only she and Draco understood the fury behind his seemingly shocked expression. “If Blaise doesn’t consent you have to take 5 shots.” Pansy added and sent her own personal glare across the table to Blaise.
And completely opposite to their previous drunk and dared kiss, Harry leaned closer slowly, one hand raising up to cup the side of Draco’s face and after what felt like aeons, his warm lips were finally touching Draco’s.
“Okay” Draco whispered and quickly changed into pajama pants and t-shirt before slipping into bed next to Harry.
“That… is personal indeed.” Draco said, watching as the tips of Harry’s ears turned red. He interrupted the spluttered reassurances that he didn’t have to answer with “No. Don’t worry, I'm not opposed to talking about it.”
Harry lifted his head at his words and frowned. “No it’s fine, I can take the couch, this is your flat.” he tried to reason but Draco wasn’t having it. He showed Harry the bedroom and tried not to watch as the man in question stepped out of his jeans and scurried under the covers. Satisfied that Harry was safe in bed he went to turn.
“Your sun and fate lines are both pretty deep but they are both interrupted? So I guess you are going to be successful and popular with breaks?”
Finally finding his wand, Harry cast a dim Lumos and grabbed his glasses. He looked over and found Malfoy laying half naked next to him, the blanket had slipped down onto his hips and the pale skin of his back looked ethereal in the glimmering light.
“Congratulations, did it hurt?” Draco immediately interrupted which earned him a light tug on his hair.
Before he could voice his doubts, Harry continued, “And seeing as Apparating from London to Malfoy Manor isn’t necessarily a one-jump distance… I thought you might want to stay at Grimmauld with me? Until the end of the bond at least? I mean you are more then welcome to stay longer, but…” Harry drifted off as Draco sat up and faced him. He took Harry’s face into both his hands and looked him deep in the eyes.
Harry moans in frustration but nods nonetheless. Pushing his hand into the messy bun, he pulls Draco close to him and kisses him, while their body’s connect in a sensually slow rhythm.
“Father would never approve.” Draco whispered, anxiously playing with the ring in his left earlobe, before forcing his hand back down. Those were already problematic enough.
Potter ordered a latte macchiato and a piece of the crumble cake and Draco promised to bring both to his table once the drink was ready.
When they pulled apart from their snogging, Harry seemed to have forgotten all about his earlier musings and was just resting dazedly against Draco, his head on Draco’s chest. Carding his fingers through the unruly black hair, Draco watched the flames dance in the fireplace.
Draco didn’t hear the rest of the discussion, he just sat at the table trying to breathe. The sound of his blood rushing through his ears drowned out the sound of the people talking right in front of him.
“I’m really sorry. I didn’t know what the spell did. It’s-... It’s no excuse. But I really didn’t know it would…” Harry broke off, unable to find the right words. “Do that.” he whispered in the end and gestured towards Draco's chest.
Draco lay his utensils down and looked her straight in the eye, “Pansy, please. You’ve been bringing up food for me for weeks now. I know you’ve been trying to get some variety but it honestly isn’t your fault that I can’t bring myself to go to dinner. I’m really really grateful for your help, please don’t feel bad that it’s not a freaking feast every day. I don’t mind the sandwiches.” He picks his fork up again before adding, “Besides, it really isn’t supposed to be your concern in the first place.”
Harry’s cock was as beautiful and well proportioned as the rest of him, larger than most cocks Draco had seen, albeit no monster by any means, and Draoc’s mouth watered at the sight.
Draco on the other hand thought a third possibility the most likely: he would be considered a threat to the precious Saviour and thrown into Azkaban, since it was only him suffering under  the bond. It wouldn’t be Harry who’d throw him to the wolves, his saviour complex was too strong for that, but it would be Weasley or Granger or anyone else with a (understandable) grudge against Draco.
They kept throwing jabs back and forth until their speech turned blurry and their insults turned into … Harry wasn’t even sure what they had turned into. Compliments maybe?
They had lain cuddling like this so often it had lost its awkwardness long ago, though it had been some time since they had held each other. During the war both had needed comfort and reassurance. Since returning to Hogwarts however, Draco had purposely evaded Pansy. He couldn’t bear to drag her down, to hurt her too. She still had a chance.
A hush spreads through the trainees and all of them look excited. The excitement falls instantly when the words “warm-up” fall from Malcolms lips. 20 minutes later they kneel on the side again, this time panting for air, sweating in their thick
Seamus had smuggled in a few bottles of Firewhiskey and the rest of the Gryffindors provided the Butterbeers. Upon the mention of alcohol, Pansy and Blaise had shared a knowing look and Draco cursed himself for not running away right then and there.
Silver eyes snapped up in an instant, mouth slightly agape. Draco couldn’t decide whether it was the use of his given name — sounding so sweet in the other's mouth —  or the forgiveness that caused it. He stared at Potter for a few moments, unable to find a single response. What was the response for these situations? Thank you? That seemed like too little. And everything else felt dishonest, considering their years of antagonism.
They sat in silence for a moment and Potter fidgeted in his seat. “I… I know it might sound weird, what with me nearly killing you, but I never wanted you dead either.”
“I’m just telling you because I know how shitty it is having to fear being outed. This isn’t me saying I know what your sexuality is. This is just me telling you that when I woke up last night it sounded like you were having a rather enjoyable dream about someone male. I may be wrong, I may be right, but either way I am not judging you, nor will I tell on you. This is your thing. And like I said, I am sorry that I know about it.”
With his free hand, Harry gently pushed Draco’s shoulder into the mattress and Draco felt himself go limp at the contact. Soothing waves of energy washed over him from every point of contact. He hummed contentedly.
“While that is nice to hear, that’s not what I was referring to Mr. Malfoy. If I were interested in your class standings I would have asked my dear colleagues. I am interested in your emotional state, and frankly put, your life outside of course work. I know it might not be my place but I noticed some instances and have wondered why you haven’t come forward with them.”
Draco learned that Harry liked his coffee bitter and his dessert sweet, that he was excited about starting a new class in January, and had even invited Draco to join him “as a teacher of course”, saying that Draco probably knew more about wizarding customs than him, even after all these years.
“Never have I ever talked my way out of a detention.” Hermione stated and quickly downed her own shot. To his own surprise, Draco didn’t feel compelled to reach for his own glass, his father bribing and threatening the teachers probably didn’t count as ‘talking oneself out of it’.
. Forcing himself not to flinch at the realisation he focussed on the feeling of the Gryffindor in his arms. It felt… right.
A knock interrupted their quiet a while later and Neville pushed his head in. He didn’t bat an eye as he saw his boyfriend cuddling with Draco and Pansy.
The answering eye roll was apparently enough of an answer as the warm hands around his wrists disappeared. Brushing the long strands of hair out of his face, Draco stood. A few calculated breaths later he took the final step to enter the Room of Requirement.
Malfoy cursed under his breath before shooting him a death glare and stormed into the room they would be sharing for the next month, nearly slapping Harry in the face with the door. Grumbling, Harry stomped off to the common area. He would deal with Malfoy later.
Harry thought about reassuring him, telling him he hadn’t heard anything, telling him the lies the other hoped to be true. But he couldn’t. Instead he said, “Don’t look at me like that, it’s not the first time I’ve woken up to a roommate having a sex dream. Let’s not make a big deal out of it okay?” He grabbed his clothes for the day and headed towards the bathroom. Just before he entered he turned once more, adding “I’m sorry I brought it up.” He closed the door and got ready for the day.
Harry was again sitting in the kitchen, enjoying a very late breakfast, when he saw Malfoy walking past again. The telltale white of his hair contrasted against the dark line of trees behind him. Like the day before he wore no jacket, the sleeves of his shirt were pushed to his elbows but unlike the day before, Malfoy was walking a path further away from the cottage. From his position at the window Harry tried but couldn’t make out the expression on Malfoy’s face when the blond momentarily turned towards his general direction.
“Wouldn’t know.” Draco shrugged. “I never really planned any of my coming-outs so I never was that nervous beforehand. I guess though, it always felt emotional and somewhat freeing.”
Harry tries to use his legs to gain enough momentum to shake Malfoy off, but the blond simply grabs the arm closest to him and pulls it into a lever. Harry taps out.
Draco took a few deep breaths and looked at Pansy and Hermione sitting on either side. He looked at Blaise, Neville and Hannah on the sofa and Susan sitting across from him. He knew these people from the study meetings, they knew him. He glanced at Terry Boot and Potter and decided to take a leap of faith, voice slightly unsteady he admitted, “I don’t do well with crowds at the moment, or people for that matter.”
After barely two years of studying under the renown Potions Master Twining, Draco Malfoy has managed to attain his own Potions Mastery at the tender age of 21. He was awarded the title for his work on the wolfsbane potion, making the potion both more effective as well as cheaper to brew, improving the availability of the potion for people afflicted by lycanthropy.
Dropping his backpack behind the counter, Draco took his apron off the little hook, put it on and hung his button down in the vacated spot before going into the back.
“Oh sure. Uhm. Never have I ever had a crush on someone I shouldn’t have.” he said, not reaching for his own glass.
Draco relished in the sight of the sleeping Harry Potter before reality set in with a shock, ‘why is Harry here?’ he thought as he shot into a sitting position which abruptly woke Harry from his slumber.
“You will be using the charm on the board to desensitise your sense of smell for this lesson, as we will be brewing Amortentia and I want all of you to be able to make it through the brewing process without being constantly distracted.” Said Professor Sondulbas on Thursday in her usual manner of jumping straight into lessons. In a way she always reminded Harry of Snape; strict, effective and straight to the point, although she wasn’t nearly as intimidating. “I will test your potion by smelling it at the end of the lesson and afterwards you will be allowed to lift the charm and smell it as well, should you wish to.” she explained, and told them to start brewing.
Both Hermione and Pansy were absent when Draco reached the Great Hall for breakfast that morning. Without much thought he sat down next to Blaise, which also meant he was across from Hannah and Neville. Hannah sent him a small smile as Draco grabbed himself some toast.
“Yeah. Sirius left it to me and I started renovating it last summer, but there are still some rooms left. And I still don’t have a solution for the tapestry in the hallway.”
Instantaneously Draco’s mood changed, the earlier anger disappeared leaving room for heaviness and caution. “I am not ashamed of who I am, not anymore. There’s no point in hiding it and no harm in talking about it. You on the other hand looked really uncomfortable and I get not wanting to talk about specific topics. Life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows and some of that is no one's business. However, should you ever want to talk to someone about it… I wouldn’t judge you for it. For whatever happened to you. I have my own experiences with some shitty situations and although I won’t ever fully understand your experiences, I can at least promise you that I won’t pity you for them.”
“Feel free to step through right away once you are done. I will be overseeing a detention tonight and the office will be empty.” McGonagall informed him.
“I-…. Thank you, Harry. This was - is - a wonderful date.” he couldn´t supress the sigh escaping his lips.
The girls remained quiet and when Draco looked up he saw the both of them in a staring contest, silently screaming at each other with their eyebrows. It was clear that Pansy had lost when she finally spoke up, “We want you to join us for breakfast on Saturday.”
and presses his thumb tendon against the pulse point. Using his own momentum he pulls Malfoy close onto his chest and, remembering his own pin-down, hooks his legs around Malfoy’s, effectively pressing them together from head to toe.
“You act as though you haven’t seen me in weeks, even though I am certain we saw each other just half an hour ago.” Draco grumbled into her hair but wrapped his arms around her nonetheless. Once Pansy released him, he turned his attention to Luna and Weasley, bowing slightly to the red head. “Weasley. My formal apologies for the continued problems and pain caused by me and my actions. I am deeply sorry.”
Draco turned at the admission. “What about Hannah?” He was pretty sure that she and Neville had been dating only a few weeks ago, he had thought they were dating still, with how close the two of them still were.
After having survived the train ride without incident, Draco looked forward to seeing his mother and getting to  simply spend some time with her. But his good mood was crushed the moment he stepped off the train.
Draco opened his potions book to the correct page and pushed it towards Harry. The page read ‘Draught of Living Death’. “Thought we’d start at the beginning so I can focus on any practical mistakes you might make before we get into the complex stuff.”
The sudden return of the focus to himself shocked Draco. He had listened attentively, soaking up the knowledge.
Draco managed to reach the 4th floor before collapsing into an alcove — the world swimming out of focus.
With the multiple congratulations and reassurances going on, Draco didn’t catch any specific reactions, but the smiling faces all around told him all he needed to know. Harry said something about “Christmas party” and “figuring it out” and not long after, he was back at the table Draco was still sitting at, smiling dazedly.
When Harry left on the day before Christmas eve, Draco hugged him goodbye, hoping that it would be enough to keep him going, knowing that it wasn’t.
“Know? No. But you practically asked him permission before agreeing yesterday, so there must be something going on. So? Out with it. What’s your relationship to Neville and did I cause any trouble?”  Draco turned his back to Blaise to grab his jumper.
“Hate to say it, but that was boring my dear. The aim is to hit as many people as possible at the same time OR to reveal some dirty secrets. Let me show you how it’s done.” Blaise said, smirking and letting his gaze run along the faces of the people sitting in the circle.
