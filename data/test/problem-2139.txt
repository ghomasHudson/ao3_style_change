The crowd immediately start clamouring, and Pansy’s comment is almost forgotten.
Remus blushed a tiny bit as Sirius slung his arm over his shoulder, and Draco marvelled again at how in love the two were. He imagined Harry doing the same to him, but tried to ignore it. It was so hard though, with Harry sitting just diagonally opposite him, skin glowing in the dying light, Adam's apple bobbing seductively as he drank, his large hands almost covering the mug entirely. Looking around the table, Draco caught Ginny staring too, and wondered what the story was there.
Sirius, Remus and Molly had been less so, all of them demanding why Harry would want to put himself in a situation that could, and most likely would, dredge up all his trauma from a childhood he was trying his best to move beyond, and heal from. Sirius, too, was angry that Harry hadn’t wanted him to go too, but Harry insisted, and after his therapist gave him the go-ahead with strict instructions to leave the minute he felt he wanted to, they relented.
“Of course they’ll love it. Say, Harry. My dear friend is having a drinks party in two weeks, and it would really be wonderful if you could come” he perseveres.
Love. That was a new name. Harry wonders if Draco knew he had said it. Draco was much more tentative in their relationship than Harry. He dislikes PDA, a fact that Harry likes to poke fun of when they are amongst close friends, and lets Harry take the lead in everything, as if he’s worried that if he ever asks for anything, Harry will become aware of what is happening and leave Draco heartbroken in the dust.
Two hours later, he got a text from Draco, reading
Draco was about to ask Harry if he could sing, or at least play some more Hozier but Harry beat him to it; “Malfoy” he blurted, as if surprising himself, “can I ask you a personal question? I’m not asking to be mean or offensive but I’m genuinely curious”
Harry grew louder here, and Draco’s heart ached as the sound of the two men’s voices swirling together in the dark vortex of the room, ‘and it’s worth it, it’s divine’
He mused that perhaps that was why Harry was now so close to Luna; she was a fourth pillar in his life, now Harry knew he had a life he could truly live, and was not just a glorified sacrificial victim.
And she put her love down soft and sweet
“Potter, if you could please turn your music down for one minute?” (he cringed internally at this, his attempts at politeness always sounded so alien when directed to anyone his own age) “I have something I was hoping to talk to you about.” Harry scrambled to sit up in bed and waved his hand, shutting off the music completely. He looked up at Draco with eyes that looked more awake, and were filled with an earnestness and attention that Draco felt somewhat undeserving of.
Taking a deep, steadying breath, Draco picked up his French sheet and the engraved cross pen he received for his sixteenth birthday from his mother, and made his way down the two flights of stairs before he was outside Harry’s room. He knocked, and then immediately regretted it. He heard movement from inside the room, then Harry’s laughter-laced shout of
“it’s not like the Great Hall, it’s constellations even during the day” said the dreamy voice of Luna at his shoulder. He leaned his head onto hers and smiled. He found that Luna’s companionship filled a deep emotional hole within him; there were no romantic or sexual undertones, but she steadied him, and he found himself always feeling calmer if he was touching her in some way. When they walked together, they held hands, and on particularly bad days at Grimmauld place he would share a bed with her, and when he couldn’t sleep her soft breathing and blond hair that glowed in the moonlight reminded him of what he had fought for, and what he now had to live for.
“Ah. Be quick about it. Harry’ll be needing the help and then I’ll need you back here not too late tonight.”
Draco drew in a breath and reached for Hermione’s hand, his long fingers wrapping around her small slender ones. She clutched back tightly.
He checked his phone then yelled “shit, Ron! Hermione’s train gets into the village in like ten minutes, we gotta run. Sorry, Draco! I’ll see you around yea?” Harry grinned at him, before tugging on some beat up air forces, throwing a book at Ron to get him out of bed, and started putting things like a wallet and a portable charger in his pockets.
The three of them laughed, and then Seamus and Dean stumbled down the stairs, still in underwear. Blaise gave a low whistle and said “if Potty’s out of play can I have these two”
“I’m fucking serious Draco.” Harry responded
Feeling guilty for getting in the way of the two friends, Draco sat up a bit and said “I’m gay, Harry, so I was never going to get with her, and regardless, I think you owe Hermione an apology. She’s right, its none of your business”
The poshness of his voice grated on his ears, but he didn’t know how to talk like Harry and Ron did, all dropped consonants and soft sounds.
Remember me love, when I’m reborn
Then, not a week later, he and Cho start shagging, and eventually going out. I don’t know what happened between them, but it must have ended, because he’s been simpering pathetically at me all term.
“you’re gay?” Draco squeaked again; voice embarrassingly high. He felt as if his world had turned on its head.
Hogwarts Academy had never, ever, lost a rugby match.
Harry laughed, and dropped a kiss to Teddy’s head, before leading the way to the kitchen.
“I can see that mate” Harry deadpanned. “I meant what about.”
“I don’t understand why that’s a pipe dream for you, unless you’re hiding a deep dark secret. Of course you’ll find someone who loves all of you”
As our eighth year continued, and due to Hermione and I wishing to study the same course and my unique position as the only person able to successfully stand up to Potter, I became almost a temporary member of the golden trio. I have my own group, of course, and Pansy, Blaise, Goyle and I are closer than ever, however due to the relative proximity of M and P in the alphabet, I have ended up as Potter’s roommate, and thus spend too much time with Ron and Hermione, and not enough time with my own friends.
“How do you feel about the gays?”
“Thanks, Draco. I don’t know how I coped before, without you to talk to” Hermione said, giving him a small but genuine smile that warmed him up from the inside out.
I made my claim in fifth year. I am still not entirely sure how, but my father discovered that I was homosexual, and he flew into a rage unlike one I have ever seen before. My dear mother tried to defend me, and he had the audacity to lay his hands on her. He hit her; the first time I have ever seen him do so, and in that moment I swore my revenge.
“I did the GCSE. Numquam and quamquam and all that” Harry replied, laughing as if he was used to his intelligence being underestimated and undermined, and used to proving people wrong.
“and then Draco came and said that I didn’t have to forgive them but I had moved past it because if I hadn’t they wouldn’t be in my house around Teddy, which is true but then she cried harder and I told her that I have you and that I’m happy now, but then the minute she calmed down, Draco explained to Blaise and then I could hear Blaise shouting about the cupboard and the starvation and about how badly they bullied me about it without knowing and then I forgot you were coming so I had to bring Parkinson down to make the cake which barely helped because I can’t relax if I’m not alone in the kitchen but she looked so upset I couldn’t tell her to go away and it’s all too much and, and I- I”
Harry rootled around the living room until he found his baby carrier. It was large, and made of African wax fabric. It was from his dad’s family and his dad had used it to carry Harry around before he had been killed. Now, harry expertly wrapped Teddy up in the vibrant fabric, before pocketing the young boys’ snack boxes and milk bottle for the day, and heading to the door. “we’re going full muggle today Draco, which means public transport. Hope you don’t mind” Draco didn’t know what that meant, and so just silently followed Harry out of the door. Soon he found himself in an abominable metal tube, aptly named ‘the tube’ according to Harry that was hurtling through underground tunnels like a basilisk. He felt distinctly nauseous, and hoped that this wouldn’t be a common occurrence for the next 18 months. Harry, however, was in his element. He was currently chatting to a pretty female muggle who was cooing over Teddy. “you seem awfully young to have a baby” she said, smiling at Harry coyly. Draco stiffened at the flirtatious tone of voice, but Harry laughed. “yea he’s not mine. I’m just the godfather on babysitting duty” he replied, giving Teddy his finger to nibble on. “and is anyone helping you with that” the woman said, smirking. Harry just laughed again, and then to Draco’s surprise Harry gestured at him saying, “yea, this posh twat over here. He’s not much help at the moment though, he’s never been on the tube before. It’s been like having two babies to look after.” Draco smiled at the woman now, or tried to. He hoped it came across as friendly rather than just a baring of teeth, but the woman bared her teeth right back, so he didn’t feel too bad. Then Harry grabbed his arm saying, “this is our stop!” and dragged Draco off the tube. So far, Draco was hating his muggle experience, but then he emerged onto street level and was surrounded by massive buildings with lovely architecture and shops full of clothes. “this is probably your personal heaven, Draco. Welcome to oxford street!” said Harry, a cheerful glint in his eye.
“S’not, though.” Harry mumbled.
Draco blushed and nodded, opening his mouth then shutting it when no words came out.
“I asked to kiss you, Malfoy, not the other way round.” Said Potter, nudging Draco’s shoulder affectionately. “of course I don’t regret it. I was drunk, but not that drunk.”
“It’s still a no, Gin. and I think you should go home.” he sounded tired, and Draco had to wonder how long Ginny’s crush on Harry had lasted, and why it was only coming to a head now.
“Yeah, sure, I was about to do mine. Come in, we can do it together.” Harry said, turning and going back into his room. It took Draco’s mind a few seconds to catch up to Harry wanting him to follow. He walked in, looking around in wonder.
When he opened his eyes again, he could see Ron looking at him with something akin to sympathy.
Caught in a landslide
“no. it was not my secret to tell”
Harry jolted Draco out of his reverie by setting down the duffle bag on the bed with a thwump.
“Hey, Malfoy” Harry breathed, and Malfoy giggled again. Harry’s stomach flipped at the sound.
“No! god no. look don’t tell anyone okay?” Harry asked, leaning across the table, radiating earnestness.
The one caveat is that a claim can only be made once.
I immediately feel guilty when Harry’s face falls though, and he looks so dejected, like a kicked puppy.
Draco accompanied Pansy and Remus back to the station late the next morning, and clung to her on the train platform as if she was his lifeline.
“you won’t like what I’m about to say, Potter, but as this is for your benefit, I suppose I should say it anyway” I venture, before closing my book and leaning forward, directing my gaze at him now.
The sound of food and rest for his weary feet nearly brought Draco to tears for the second time that day. He hadn’t even realised how hungry he was until Remus mentioned breakfast, but now it was all he could think about.
The Rugby Boys ran the school, much to Draco’s chagrin. In his humble opinion, he should be at the top of the hierarchy, due to his endless wealth, his unnatural good looks and the fact that his father is on the board of governors. The top spot that he deserves, however, is reserved for the A-Team rugby lads, who are all- again, in Draco’s humble opinion- bumbling Neanderthals with more muscle than sense and the worrying ability to break bones on a whim.  They were loud, boisterous and utterly self-absorbed, roaming the ancient stone corridors like lions, as if they were the only pupils in the whole school. The teacher’s doted on them, and they could always get away with not having done the work with a simple “but miss, there’s a match this weekend”
McGonagall surveyed the teenagers gathered in front of her, all with backpacks on, most looking half asleep and some looking really quite terrified. As a precaution, she had cast tracking charms on all of the tents in case of an emergency. She smiled, and prayed this idea wouldn’t turn out to be a terrible one.
His reply was appropriate it seemed, as he smiled at Draco and nodded. “I can imagine. Life seems so fast-paced in London. I much prefer it here”
“what are you making?” Draco asks, voice soft and quiet, as if not wishing to disturb the serenity of the kitchen.
“I got you something for tonight, Potty darling” said Pansy, her manicured nails taking his hand and pulling him upstairs for a try-on.
“Dean and Seamus, you can stay as long as you like, you know” Harry said, sitting down next to them. They nodded, and seemed content to spend the day with Blaise.
“Probably that he still likes you” Ron said, flipping through the textbook.
What’s funny to him is that for all his raging hormones, he feels no connection with sex. When he was younger, and heard the boys talking about it with awe and shared none of their enthusiasm, he thought it was because he had never had a relationship, but the older he gets, the more he feels sure that he doesn’t want to have sex.
Soon, too soon, Harry pulled away. “That okay?” he asked, green eyes sparkling; the only things Draco could see in the darkness that embraced them.
“I’m just glad it’s a fate you avoided. Narcissa was always on the nicer side. Nowhere near Andi, of course but… better than Bella at any rate”
Draco was astounded, both at Sirius’ kindness and his confession. He had always known his family were not perfect, the opposite in fact. He still hadn't realised they were capable of such mindless cruelty.
“Yeah, thanks Ron.” Said Harry, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders that he wasn’t even aware had been there.
God, Draco was fucked. He thought back on his interactions with Harry that day and physically flinched at how standoffish he had been; how impolite. How was he supposed to strike up a friendship now?
Deciding the fresh air would be good for Draco, and not trusting him not to be sick again, Harry decided they would walk back to Grimmauld. He made the right decision as the walk took over an hour; Draco had to stop every couple of streets to be sick again. Harry was glad he had kept the water he had been given, as it was much needed. They finally stumbled into Grimmauld place and Harry hauled Draco straight to the bathroom. He rubbed Draco’s back soothingly as the boy retched into the toilet, before Draco slumped back into Harry’s kneeling body behind him. Draco messily wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then turned his head, nuzzling it into Harry’s neck.
Draco sagged in relief that they would be stopping walking for hopefully at least an hour. Potter and Weasley, who seemed to have done some intense endurance training since the war, set a gruelling pace and Draco’s thighs were shaking with exertion. They all sat in a small little circle, facing each other. Draco would have found it weird but since Blaise had decided to launch Granger off on a lecture about muggle cultural customs, the two groups had intermingled somewhat. No, that was a lie. Blaise had talked to Granger mainly, and Weasley and Potter at times, and Pansy had spoken to Potter somewhat, and Draco had stayed behind, walking slower than the rest, fighting against the uselessness of his recovering body.
Once done, he found a new book and decided to sit on his little porch in the sun instead of spending the day cooped up inside, and made his way out and curled up on the step, feeling the fresh air fill his lungs. In such a short time, he had grown to love where he was, which he hadn't expected to do for the months he was to stay there.
In this moment, I hate him for how understanding he is, and I hate myself for the fact that I know I will say yes, even though I also know that there is no way this could work. I smile at him and nod nonetheless, before shifting closer to him and tangling our legs together. My bare legs rub against the soft, worn fabric of his pyjama bottoms and I am forcefully reminded of the fact that I am only in my underwear. Potter smiles back, before bringing a hand up to cradle my face, and pressing a chaste kiss to my lips. He kisses me two, three, four more times, his hand moving down to my hip. All the kisses are close-mouthed and sweet, and they are absolutely perfect. He then kisses my nose, my forehead, my cheek, before whispering to me to turn around, and then he pulls me close, cradling my body in his, the soft t-shirt pressing against my back as his strong arm wraps around my middle and holds me securely.
The horrifying ordeal- though Harry supposed it must be more horrifying for Draco to have to watch his best friend kiss his boyfriend- ended soon after that embarrassment, and Harry found himself back in the attic, staring hopelessly into Draco’s watery grey eyes.
“I say boys. Sixth form at last, eh?” Theo said, the perfect carbon copy of his father. Draco was very much a Rich Private School Boy, but he did so in an elegant, modern fashion, he liked to think. He wore his signet ring with cashmere and merino jumpers, and pressed slacks that cost hundreds that his mother imported from Italy. Theo, on the other hand, sported a mullet and wore shoffels and tweed. He was utterly old fashioned, and would likely die in the same room in which he had been born in the Nott estate near the New Forest.
About that night the bugs and the dirt
“That sounds amazing, and honestly I could do with the help” Sirius said, grinning widely at Draco. Draco grinned back, feeling like a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders.
“you’re the best mate” Ron replied, stripping off, throwing his sweaty stuff in the wash basket, and leaving Harry with a lovely view of his freckly arse as he went to shower in their little shared ensuite.
“I never said sorry. For your father. I know this will seem insincere because I hated him but, he was still your dad and I am sorry that he died.”
Hogwarts was a sprawling complex of buildings. The main castle housed the assembly hall, the main reception, the headmaster’s office, various admin offices and some seminar rooms and a lecture theatre. He has his French classes in the seminar rooms, as they were smaller and so used for the much smaller class-sizes for the humanity subjects at A-Level. Sciences and maths and DT all had their own buildings.
He sat up and saw Harry slowly swaying his body in the mirror as he tried -and failed- to plait his unruly hair back. He turned to Draco with a grin. “Luna keeps trying to teach me but I never get the hang of it, and I love the feel of someone else doing my hair too much to really try” he said, giving up and letting his curls tumble free.
“where did Thomas and Finnegan sleep then?” asked Draco, clearly missing something.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And I hate him” he whispered, before shutting the door behind him.
“Well as it’s your birthday you have no farm duties today. Unfortunately I have some accounts that need going over so if you don’t mind returning to the cottage for a little while?” Sirius asked, looking apologetic. Draco was so focussed on this that he missed Harry smirking a little into his mug of tea.
“What’s so funny?” He asks, and I see his knuckles turn white where they’re clutching his pint as he feels mocked.
Suddenly, two staircases appeared, and flowed up to a second level of the common room, like a wrap-around indoor balcony, with doors lining the walls. Harry checked the clock and saw it was 9, like McGonagall said. He summoned his Gryffindor bravery and was the first to walk up the stairs, Ron quick to follow, ready to unpack and settle into his room so he could go straight back to whispering sweet nothings into Hermione’s ear.
“we walked back because Draco kept chunning. He chunned a bit more when we got back, and then I carried him to bed, and that was pretty much it. I gave him a bucket just in case and stayed until he fell asleep.”
“you will always have us, Harry dear” Molly reassured
Sirius and Molly came in.
“Fuck fuck fuck”
“no Malfoy, you spent new year’s bugging me about a girlfriend I don’t have” teased Harry, enjoying how pink Draco blushed. “that was so rude of me oh my god” he said, muffled by the pillow he had pulled over his head.
“Nana, this is Draco. He’s helping us on the farm” Harry said, announcing their presence.
“Oh, didn’t see you there Diggory. In case you haven’t noticed, we’re a bit busy” Harry said, face dripping with disdain, before he turned his face back to Luna, hoping she would be following his train of thought, she was, and they kissed until she quickly looked around and said “He’s gone”
“Harry, please tell me what’s wrong. You’re frightening me”
“cleaning charms don’t clean away the smell of baby vomit. Learnt that the hard way” said Harry. “can you watch ted for five minutes while I go and put some clothes on?” Harry asked. Just as he stood, he heard a voice gasp behind him “my my Potty. And in front of Blaise too, Draco would be most upset”
“I have little in the way of romantic experience, but my best friend Pansy is not only a girl but also a hopeless romantic, and I know she’d tell you to remember that Ginny’s feeling’s are her own responsibility, not yours, and so is how she handles them. If she wants to put them on you that's her decision and her responsibility.” Draco said.
Open up your loving arms
“And Sirius, see he gets so bad about his family, you know? What they did to him. What your people did to ‘im, and I didn’t want you coming anywhere near ‘im. And god, when you and him started becoming all friendly like? I hated it. He’s mine, you know? He’s my fake dad, not yours. And you’ve got parents. It felt like you were taking ‘im away from me.”
Ron was pale, freckles standing out starkly against his shin. He was breathing shallowly, and his neck and chest were covered in small, angrily red gashes and cuts. His lower half was covered by a thin white sheet that did nothing to hide the deep, hideous wound on his milky white thigh.  Dragging his eyes away from the state of the weasel, as Hermione fell to her knees by his bed, Draco turned to Harry, and nearly forgot how to breathe. He saw now that the small cuts on Ron were the result of splinters from a broom, a broom that’s handle was currently sticking out of Harry’s side. He felt sick, really sick. Before he could register what was happening, he fell to his knees and vomited all over the floor. Wiping his mouth and collecting himself, he heard a weak chuckle from above. “I know I look bad but am I ugly enough to make you chunder?”
“Blaise, as loathe as I am to say it, if Draco sees you there he will throw a hissy fit”
“Draco?” Harry said softly from the doorway
Pansy squealed and ushered Draco to sit between her legs as she kneeled and started combing her fingers through it. It was more relaxing than Draco expected, and he relaxed into the feeling of gentle feelings against his scalp. It hurt a bit when she started to tug the strands into place, but a good kind of hurt, that didn't disrupt his relaxation. He couldn't think of a better way to spend his birthday.
The Saturday dawned, and Draco awoke to the sounds of yet another song he couldn’t recognise. The beat was uplifting, but the lyrics held a sort of bittersweet regret;
He stepped aside to let her in but instead of walking past him she hugged him, which was a nice surprise. Draco finally felt like he’d made a friend. She then sat on the sofa and patted the cushion next to him, motioning for him to sit with her.
“In here, love!” Sirius yelled and for a few seconds Draco was desperately worried he was about to be living and working alongside a throuple, when a man who couldn’t have been more than two years older than him walked into the kitchen. He wasn’t massively tall, maybe about 5’10 to Draco’s 6’ but he was well built. Rich dark skin strained over arm muscles that flexed as he ran a hand through his jet black hair.  roundish-squarish glasses with black frames perched on the end of his nose, magnifying his green eyes in a thoroughly distracting manner.
Draco was hit with a desperate sadness at the thought that Harry was leaving. He really, really didn’t want Harry to go.
“i could kiss you, molly. Harry is so lucky to have you”
“you vomited a lot more than that mate. I was with you for an hour in that loo. It was an awful pink colour as well.”
Harry thought he had fallen a little bit in love with Narcissa. Draco was so lucky to have a mum like that.
As Harry wondered through the corridors, he felt the memories of the battle weighing on him heavily. Over the summer he had come to realise that happiness was a choice he had to make, not just a feeling that one happened upon unexpectedly. Whilst Harry wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed and cry about all he had lost to the deep timbre of Nina Simone, the comforting tristesse of Lorde, he knew he would never leave the bed again. He resolved that for Eighth year, above all else, he as Harry James Potter, would always choose happiness. With that in mind, he began to skip through the blessedly empty halls, arriving in the common room flushed, out of breath and smiling too widely for a war veteran.
And so, Harry does what he always does when he feels overwhelmed. He bakes. In a surprising turn of events, he finds himself making his Aunt Petunia’s Simnel Cake recipe, which is fitting for the time of year, and he finds himself humming a hymn they used to make him sing in assemblies in primary school. Harry never knows when his subconscious will bring Harry’s early childhood to the surface, but clearly today will be one of those days.
“god Malfoy you do not look good, let me get you upstairs” said Harry, steering Draco’s body back up towards the party. Draco shook his head vehemently, but the movement made him feel intensely sick and he blanched.
On their way back, Remus introduced him to some of the cows, and Draco decided his favourite was a smaller one named Cordelia. When he said this Remus chucked and said
The entered the room, and Ron immediately made a beeline for Hermione, who’s face lit up at the sight of them. They looked so happy with each other it automatically made Draco happy to see it.
Draco suddenly remembered he had to share a tent with Potter for two nights, and stumbled, only for the very man to grab his shoulder to stop him falling face first into the soft grass of the Welsh countryside.
Despite having seen it so many times before, Draco was still wistful when the end came.
Harry’s face tightened, and he let go of Draco’s hand. “what’s that supposed to mean” he said in a low voice.
As the time grew nearer to Christmas, and Draco was faced with the prospect of returning to the manor, his nightmares grew in both frequency and intensity. So much so that the two boys spent more time in the same bed than in different ones, and by early December Draco gave up waiting for the nightmares to come, and would just slide into bed with Harry. Much as it had been with Luna, there was no tension, no awkward touching, just sleep in the safety of companionship. One night, where sleep seemed beyond arms reach, and Draco believed Harry to be asleep, he stared up at the red draping and whispered into the darkness “I don’t want to go home”. A hand gripped his under the covers and said “then don’t. Me, Ron, ‘Mione and Luna are going to Grimmauld for the holidays, and the burrow for just Christmas. It’s your house too, you know. Join us.”
They passed a lovely weekend, spending most of it in the formal drawing room with the fire on, and his mother’s Edith Piaf records filling the room with lovely music. Without Lucius, they both revelled in the freedom. Draco hadn't even realised how restrictive and strict his father had been until Draco could eat biscuits whenever, and read in the receiving parlour and play music loudly and wear his pyjamas all day and eat cake late at night, sitting at the kitchen table with his mum instead of eating in the dining room. It was an amazing feeling. He had never felt closer to his mum, either.
With the plates and mugs all stacked in the drying rack, Draco made his way back across the little lawn that stretched between his cottage and the farmhouse. He carefully unlaced his boots at the door, and found a book that seemed interesting before settling into the little armchair.
“s’alright mate. I would say it’s because you’re my brother, but I would abandon Percy in a heartbeat”
Luna immediately landed on Botany and scratched her name under it. Hermione settled on history, English and politics- no surprise there. Harry pondered the list, before settling on classical civilisation and French. When he passed the sheet and quill to Draco, the blond almost caused an inkblot when he saw Harry’s name under his beloved subject, but signed up nevertheless.  He could not control his shock, however when he saw that Harry had signed up for French. “you speak French?” he blurted out before he could stop himself.
“cool. I can’t talk to Ron about it because even though he accepts me he turns redder than his hair at the mere thought of me having sex” Laughed Harry. He then got off his bed, and walked over to Draco’s, and stuck out his hand, echoing that first day all those years ago. “so, friends?” he asked, spearing Draco with his piercing gaze once again. Draco was speechless, and could only grasp the strong brown hand in front of him, willing strength into his limp hand.
“He’s come t’see Sirius, and do gap year shit, I don’t really ken, Gin, nor do I really care, so why do you? He seems a decent enough lad lets just leave it at that”
(See the end of the chapter for
They made their way to the village square, where many tables and chairs had been set up, with people dotted around. Ribbons adorned the front  of the village hall, and its two front doors were  wide open. Draco’s eyes alighted on Ron’s mum, Molly, setting up a table laden with cakes and confectionery of all sorts. There were scones, and shortbread, and battenberg and a victoria sponge and a banana loaf, and a chocolate cake and a lemon drizzle and blueberry muffins and brownies and flapjacks and Draco could feel his mouth watering the more he looked. Ron, his brothers, a girl who must be his sister and a man who must be his dad were there already, and their little group made their way over, led by Remus. They were then joined maybe fifteen minutes later by Hermione’s parents.
God, Draco loved his mum.
There will come a poet, whose weapon is his word
Pansy gave him a curious, undiscernible look, then nodded her head and gracefully made her way out of the kitchen, large mug of tea in hand for Draco.
“It’s okay to love them, You know. I have a brother, Regulus. I adore him with my heart and soul. He hasn't spoken to me since I left. He’s some hot-shot CEO now and I can stalk him on facebook, make sure he’s still alive but…”
“Er, you alright mate?” said Ron, sitting up in bed, looking at the boy desperately using their door handle to keep himself standing.
Harry was shaking. He turned to Sirius.
“yes yes yes Ron, I know my living room is full of Slytherins. They are staying to see Draco and they have actually been really fun company.  Until tonight” Harry groaned at the end, feeling very much at the end of his tether
Sirius announced their presence and Harry’s face stretched into a grin as he yelled “Hermione!” and leapt up, hugging her with so much enthusiasm he lifted her off the floor. She laughed and hugged him back with as much force, before he set her down and got out three bowls, before sitting back down and pulling her down next to him.
Harry turned to pick his t-shirt up off the floor and heard Pansy whisper “daddy-mode Harry is coming back” to Draco.
Harry could not remember a time when he had written so formally, but Narcissa struck him as the kind of woman to appreciate such pomp and formality. He rolled up the letter and summoned his tiny black owl. He had chosen her because in appearance she was the complete opposite to Hedgewig, whom he mourned as deeply as any of the people he had lost. Hermione had helped him choose her, and he named her Hestia, after the Greek goddess of the hearth. He found the connotations of warmth and homeliness comforting. After seeing Hestia off, he went downstairs and started on a batch of scones, glad he had time to make fresh jam to go with them. Harry adored baking. It had given him purpose after the war as much as Teddy had. He had spent hours in the kitchen with Molly in the weeks after the war, making all sorts of confectionary which he had started to deliver to saint Mungo’s to be delivered to patients. Despite the fact that he had killed Voldemort, singlehandedly ending two wars and over a decade of pain and loss and suffering, he never felt more useful than when he saw nurses and patients alike nibbling on his cupcakes, or muffins, or biscuits, thanking him for the kindness and complimenting him on the quality. It warmed his heart to be able to help on such a personal level, and it made him feel better than ever before. At the end of the summer, Arthur, Bill and Charlie had built him a large bookshelf in his kitchen, which he had slowly but steadily been filling with muggle cookbooks. In return, he had made them tea with lavender lemon drizzle cake, which the three Weasley men had devoured with all the grace of starving animals. Since then, that had become Harry’s new thing. It was now mid-November, only two and a half months since his shelf had been built, and Harry had done the same thing for everyone who came to Grimmauld. He called it ‘tea and cake’ or just ‘tea’ for short, stealing the tradition from long-held British muggle culture, and his kitchen had soon become a social hub. He had found a lovely vintage table and chair set at a muggle junk yard, and he and Ron had fixed it up, and now it stood proudly by the glass door to the back garden in Harry’s kitchen, and multiple days a week he had people round. Sundays were reserved for Andromeda for tea and teddy time, and no one else ever came to those, but Hermione and Ron came round at least one a week, as did Luna. Neville came every other weekend when he could take the time from apprenticing under Professor Sprout, and various Weasley’s came round whenever they could. That week, he had had Bill and Fleur Tuesday evening, and he had made savoury cheese scones, and Kingsley and Hermione, who was apprenticing under him, had dropped by on their Thursday lunch break, for whom he had made London fog cake. Hermione had suggested Harry open a café of sorts, but Harry didn’t want his passion for baking to be corrupted by money-making or time pressure. He baked for himself and those he held dear, and it would stay that way.
He lay on his bed for what felt like hours, alternating between crying silently and berating himself for such unwieldly emotions. He longed for the Malfoy Mask that he used to don so easily, but had slipped away from him now. He felt too deeply to hide it, and it made him feel so disgustingly vulnerable. The sky outside his window was darkening and he was wiping stray tears from his cheeks when he heard the door knock.
Malfoy closed his eyes, and whispered “yes, please” and that was all Harry needed before he gently tilted his face and pressed his lips against Malfoy.
He explained as he walked the short distance back to the front door before turning to double check Draco was okay.
“I could never, Potter. Draco would have my balls for breakfast”
“Does this ginger dog speak for you now, Harry?” Bryn asked with a slight welsh valley accent  and even Draco felt offended on Ron’s behalf. He pushed down the little voice in the back of his head that told him that was exactly how he used to speak at school, but he couldn't quite push down the shame that arose with it.
Harry turned and led the way. When he opened the front door, Draco was hit by a wall of fragrance. The warm and heady smell of spices wrapped around him, cradling him and drawing him into the kitchen. At the stove stood a woman with her back to him. Her long grey hair was pulled into a single neat plait down her back, hanging over her soft cream salwar kameez.
Draco waited in the living room for Pansy to emerge from his bedroom, which she had commandeered to get ready in. He was in his levis, and a soft cotton t-shirt his mum had bought him about a year ago. At Pansy’s behest, he had kept his hair in the braid she had put it in, and he tugged on the end as he waited for her.
“Fuck. Fuck, mum. I saw Father in the garden, with, with Mrs Prewett, and they were getting off like fucking teenagers and it was so horrible and, just, fuck, mum” he finally says, tears streaming down his face as he holds his mother’s hands.
“Nonsense. Anyway, Draco is upstairs. Good luck with your homework, and I do hope you’ll be staying for dinner, dear.”
Draco felt secretly pleased that he had picked Harry’s favourite, but also a bit worried that Harry might resent him for it. God knows that the individuality complex bred into Draco from years of private schooling made his life hell whenever someone he didn’t know very well expressed interest in something niche that Draco enjoyed.
“Fuck. Oh fuck. Luna, remember I told you about Cedric? Yea that’s him. Shit why is he coming here” Harry groaned. He didn’t want Cedric to ruin the night.
Harry also learnt some of the languages, to prove to Hermione his trip wasn’t lacking education, and arrived on Platform 9 and 3/4 well-rested, well-adjusted, and secure in himself, having experienced pure unadulterated happiness for the first time, to counteract the pure unadulterated loss that walked beside him like a shadow. He was tall, tan and ready to face the year ahead. His hair had grown long, and for the first time in 18 years the wrinkles on his face came from laughter, not worry.
After a yell from downstairs, “come on you bastards don’t feed the stereotypes!” Harry grabbed Dean’s hand and bounded down the stairs.  Draco stared after him wistfully as the group of Gryffindor’s left the common room into the great beyond.
The jealousy in Draco burnt hotter and hotter, the green-eyed monster rearing its ugly head as it unfurled in his stomach. No matter how awful it made him feel, he couldn’t help but stare at Harry’s muscled form in the low light, the way his hips moved so fluidly, the protective way his hands gripped Bianca’s hips as they moved.
He missed London, of course he did. But the more he thought about it the parts of London he missed were his mother, Pansy, and the city itself. He missed the shops and the freedom and the anonymity, but he was starting to realise that maybe being known and liked was a nicer alternative. And two people weren’t enough to convince him to return. If he had more friends, maybe, or if he cared for his family more he might be harder to persuade but really, London was just a train ride away, and staying here didn’t mean he would never go back.
In the four days since then, time spent together was stiff and uncomfortable, and it was just not what I needed today. I had had lectures since 8 am, one of which included a hands-on autopsy, and another of which included an exceedingly graphic video of what happens when childbirth goes wrong. I was covered in fluids from the dead body I had to dissect, and my head was full of images of ripped genitals and breach-births, and all I wanted was to get takeaway with Potter and then fall asleep on the sofa with my feet in his lap, like we usually do on a Wednesday.
Draco could have cried. God, he loved his mum.
“I always wanted a brother” he offered into the raw space between them. “I thought,” he coughed, voice breaking a little. “I thought that maybe if I had a brother Father might leave me alone a bit more. I always had to do and be everything, and god, it was the worst feeling in the world. I was just never good enough.”
Draco spent the rest of the morning in a daze. Now all the food was eaten, his bag was at its lightest, which was a godsend to his ruined legs, and every time he caught sight of Potter he could remember how it felt to kiss him and a sense of bliss descended on him. Even Potter chatting constantly with bloody Talgarth wasn’t enough to dull Draco’s spirits, until he saw the group ahead draw to a stop, and saw McGonagall standing there, Portkey waiting to send them back to Hogwarts.
The concern in Draco’s voice when Harry knew their whole relationship might come to an abrupt end that night cracked something open in Harry, and tears began to well up in his eyes. He shook his head mutely and wrapped his arms around Draco, drawing up all the sobriety he could muster and desperately hoping that he didn’t splinch them.
“Like I said, it’s Pansy’s advice, not mine, but she is a gem and I’m lucky to have her,” Draco said, feeling a pang in his chest when thinking of the best friend he hasn't seen in just over a month.
He vacated the chair to let Sirius sit down, and just as Sirius did so a facebook notification flashed across the screen reading ‘Andromeda Tonks has accepted your friend request! Say Hi!’
“It’s dinner now. Nan’s here so I hope you like curry” Harry said, his lips twitching up in the corners. He looked relaxed, but there was a nervousness about his face that Draco didn't understand.  Draco nodded and stepped out, pulling the door closed behind him and toeing on his walking boots for the brief walk over to the house.
When he woke, he slipped out after leaving Draco a note and a hangover potion, and went to Luna’s room before sliding in next to her. His large body immediately slotted in next to her small one, ad he felt like the morning after a storm; clear and bright, refreshed from the emotion of the night before. Later that morning, He and Luna sat together in bed doing their classics homework, an essay analysing whether the Iliad glorified war. Harry ultimately decided it couldn’t; how could a book that showed so clearly the love between Achilles and Patroclus ever glorify a war that wrenched the two men apart. Harry wondered if anyone would glorify the wizarding war in times to come, and he decided that he would make it his life’s mission to ensure every wizard in the world knew that war could never ever be a good thing, that it rent destruction on everyone, that the winning side won in politics only- Harry had lost too many loved ones, too much of himself to ever see himself as a winner in this.
Out of sheer laziness, and because he knew teddy liked it, he sent a Patronus summons to Draco instead of walking upstairs to get him.
“I know but it's just, it isn't fair. You must have felt so isolated here. You only really talk to Sirius, and sometimes Remus, and they’re twenty years older than you, and even that only happened recently. You spent a month practically by yourself and surrounded by strangers. That must have been hell”
Cho and I were together for nearly a year, and then we broke up over something small that escalated to something big, and it just wasn’t working well. It was good while it lasted, though. We were each other’s firsts, and we trusted each other, we just weren’t compatible. Anyway, after the breakup, Cedric was very supportive, always hanging out with me so I didn’t feel lonely, inviting me to their parties so I stayed in the friendship group even without Cho.
“They’re great, I think,” Draco said, letting Ron know he could turn around.
Draco returned from a late dinner, and was shocked to find Harry on his bed. He had assumed that due to the nature of the injuries sustained, the weasel would be released first and yet the fiery red hair was nowhere to be seen. Next to him sat Hermione, with red rimmed eyes and dishevelled hair. “it’s fine, ‘mione, I promise. It’s just a tiny infection and he’ll be out before you know it. Stay here with me and Luna, and he’ll be back before you know it.”
It suddenly hit Draco that Harry was much too young to have taken on all the stresses of parenthood. He looked so fragile in Molly’s arms, clutching at her while his body shook with tears. Draco felt like an intruder on this moment, not knowing what to say or do with himself.
“of course you can stay, harry dear. Unfortunately none of the spare rooms are set up. You wouldn’t mind sharing with Draco, would you? The bed is big enough”
Draco blushed harder, and the heat from Harry’s hand on his shoulder radiated throughout his body.
Draco hadn't quite been able to hide the hurt on his face when Harry said he was going without him, but Harry knew he had to put himself first in this situation, and Draco had been so sweet and understanding about it.
“So... you and Luna…” Draco said, wanting to reassure himself that Harry really wasn’t dating the blonde beauty from the night before.
“oh fuck and I’ve made it awkward now haven’t I. shit. Shit!” complained Draco, until he felt a hand on his.
Pansy had looked gorgeous as always, in a floor length green silk dress to match his suit, and they made a striking couple. Her and Daphne were fast friends, so much of his evening was spent with Theo and Daphne and Pansy, letting the girls talk whilst Theo drank, and Draco watched Harry out of the corner of his eye.
“Shut up Ron” Harry and Luna replied in unison. “It was just to make Cedric back off. He wasn’t leaving me alone. Was Luna’s idea” explained Harry.
Draco heard mud squelch under the tyres of the Land Rover as the tank of a car crested the hill. All around him were green fields dotted with sheep and horses and cows and the occasional barn. In the shallow valley below him was the heart of a farm.
“Right. I hope you don’t think I’m stereotyping, these are just genuinely my favourites” she said very sincerely, as if Draco would be offended she only bought chic flics because he was gay. She had brought with her Pitch Perfect, 10 things I Hate About You, It's a Boy Girl thing, and some others that Draco hadn’t seen before.
“Harry!” I say, stopping his rambling. “I’ll love it, I promise, I love you, just let me see?” I ask, taking the box from his shaking fingers, with my own equally trembling ones.
I just need your body baby, from dusk till dawn
Sirius sat next to Remus, who was watching his limp with a concerned expression. One of the ginger men shifted up to allow Draco to sit, before passing him a bowl filled with pasta with tuna and sweetcorn.
‘please don’t throw up on me’ Harry thought to himself as he read.
“I’m not good at this,” Harry said after a bout of silence, eyes still closed.
Draco exhaled slowly, pressing the heels of his palms against his eyes, ready for the onslaught of disgust and rage he was surely about to face. He waited long moments, but the angry words, the pain of a punch never came. He felt instead a large palm running comfortingly up and down his arm and he dared to look up.
He can only hold her for so long
I couldn’t utter my love when it counted
“D’ya bring scones, Ron?” Harry asked, but nodded at Draco nonetheless. Draco counted this as a win.
Then, there was also the matter of his education. He had always seen himself going to uni; his father had given him no other choice, and whilst he loved to learn, he had no career in mind for himself, nor did he really know which course he wanted to do. He had thought about applying for English, or maybe French, but the more time he spent away from studying, the less the idea of studying more appealed to him.
“What do you know,” he said, some tears spilling onto his cheeks, “Draco hates the Blacks too. I’m not alone against them anymore”
Harry floo’d to the Burrow with Teddy whilst Draco and Pansy completed their grooming routine, and he watched her fuss over the baby for a bit, before saying that he could stay the night with her, as she seemed to be missing him. She couldn’t say yes fast enough, and he grinned before going back to Grimmauld and floo called Dean and Seamus to see if they were up for a club night with the Slytherins. The two were somewhat dubious about it but said yes as they were curious about Slytherin party habits. Pansy was delighted when he told them, and her and Draco immediately started to plan outfits. Harry had to drag them out of the house to the cinema. Just to take the piss, Harry took them to see the Rugrats movie, which had just been released that year. He found himself enjoying it immensely and made a mental note to watch it again with Teddy. His companions also enjoyed it quite thoroughly. He supposed that after living through war things like children’s films seemed more enjoyable for their innocence and sweetness.
Speaking of Harry, he was sitting a little ways down looking very ashamed of himself between Ron and Sirius. Remus was sitting opposite him and was giving him as many assessing looks as Hermione was glowers. Vindictively happy about this, Draco basked in the attention of Pansy and Hermione, and Charlie who was sitting directly opposite, and he was very glad to note that Pansy and Hermione seemed to get on very well.
Draco stood and followed, turning to go up the stairs.
Anyway, the team was good. They were solid, surprisingly kind boys who did their utmost to make Ron and Harry feel welcome. Whilst Harry felt confident in his physical strength, and his sporting abilities, in past teams it was the group dynamic that sometimes threw him off. He was good, really good, he and Ron both. But he and Ron were a duo that stuck to each other like glue, and at their old school, team members who didn’t understand this resented their dynamic.
“Harry mate, you should have seen the way Malfoy was ogling you!” laughed Dean.
“I understand that this is a big request, and I would not ask if I did not feel I had to. As much as I know you hate the fame and influence you have, it is there nevertheless, and I must beg you to use it. Room assignments will be magically revealed at 9 pm, and I have placed you with Mr Malfoy. If you two can outwardly appear to bury the hatchet, and act civilly towards each other, then hopefully the year, and then the school will follow. Whilst I know this isn’t ideal given your history, I believe this could be cathartic for the two of you also. I have already spoken to Mr Malfoy and asked him not to openly express disdain or discontent for his roommate, and I must ask you to do the same. My wish is that soon you will discover that friendship is not outside the bounds of possibility, however civility is all that I need for this school to heal and move beyond the pain that hangs all around us.”
Draco was stood in the doorway.
“therapy” Harry replied, laughing. That shocked Draco. Boys didn’t usually speak so openly and comfortably about such things.
Blaise just smirked and said “remember Harry- Draco, my balls, breakfast”
“he’s a grass snake, harmless and sweet. His names Talgarth, and we’re best friends now” said Harry, aware that he sounded childish, but loving that he had found a pet to fill the void left by Hedgewig without having to make a conscious choice about it, and Hedgewig had indeed been his best friend over those long and lonely summers.
“morning sunshine”
Potter could do wandless magic? Fuck that’s hot
But I know he isn’t joking. I know he’s mine.
“Mr Potter,” she startled him, walking up from behind his chair.
“And what would those connotations be?” Draco asked.
He heard the crunch of gravel underfoot, and knew Cedric was almost upon them.
“oh god. Why do we ever allow him to drink, Pans?”
“I just mean, I would happily listen to you complain about your father, only you apologise every time you even mention him. Blaise seems the type to sit tight whilst you change a lot, only you never let him. Forgive me if I'm over stepping but other than Pansy, you seem to hold people quite at arm's length.”
Draco gasped. It was as if his deepest fantasies had come to life. He was in shock, and barely managed to reply with “I- what?”
This just confused Draco further. The snatches he got of Harry’s life were going to give him whiplash.
“Did you know about this Draco?” she said against Harry’s shoulder. “we were so awful to him and that whole time he was being locked in a fucking cupboard. A cupboard! And he would escape that cupboard just to come to school and face us being absolutely horrible about it”
“if I knew he would be sick as much as Teddy I wouldn’t have said yes to letting him stay here” groaned Harry, “but as he is unfortunately my roommate, I better go check on him”
” it hissed back, slithering towards Harry. Instinctively, he lowered his arm and the snake slithered up and curled around it, and Harry straightened and brought his wrist up so the snake’s face was level with his.
The three stumbled through the door of Grimmauld as it began to get light outside, and all collapsed onto Harry’s bed, which was just about big enough to fit three.
“Ron! Put your arse away. I’m sure that whoever is outside doesn’t want to see your dick this early on a Saturday.”
bit of a short one!
He also told Sirius, lying on the sofa with his feet in Sirius’ lap, explaining about the skinny blond boy at his school who was both shy and confident at the same time, who trusted Harry enough to go to him with family troubles, trusted Harry enough to cry in front of him.
“she’s not my girlfriend Draco. She’s from Trinidad and that’s how they dance there to that kind of music.” Harry explained, before transfiguring his toothbrush into a glass and filling it with an ‘aguamenti’ and handing it to Draco.
“for fucks sake lads, do you not have a bedroom?” asked Harry, chuckling and moving into their kitchen so they could put their pants back on in privacy.
“It's really nice here” she whispered into the darkness.
Draco wanted to melt into a little puddle. How could just one phone call make him feel all warm all over?
“Please, call me Narcissa. I can see why Draco likes you so much, what a charming boy.”
“fuck” she whispered behind him after minutes of silence. “and we were so fucking awful to you at school about it. God Harry I’m so fucking sorry” she said, and he heard the tell-tale wobble of tears in her voice. He bent down to put a now calm Teddy in his cot and turned to her to say that all was forgiven, but before he could open his mouth, she tackled him into a massive hug, and he felt the wetness of her tears soak through his t shirt where her head rested against his chest.
It didn’t make sense, though. They had barely touched all evening until they left and then came back, and it was like a switch had flipped. They could barely keep their hands-or mouths- off each other. Then they had stumbled off to their room, followed about an hour later by Ron and Hermione.
Hermione let out a weak laugh, and Draco tightened the arm around her shoulders.
“This tiny village is called Hogsmeade. There’s an okay pub here with good food, and a market on spring and summer weekends. Just on the other side is the big supermarket where we buy essentials.” Sirius explained as they made their way down cobbled residential streets, until they came upon quite a large square with a fountain in the middle and a large, old looking building on one side.
We are in the illustrious eighth year at Hogwarts. ‘we’ is of course Blaise, Pansy, and I. the golden trio also returned (ew) as well as a few other Gryffindors, (also ew) and a handful of Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.
“It's nothing. You're the only person under forty who can tolerate my presence so it's the least I can do'' Draco joked, but Hermione detected the underlying dejection.
Embarrassingly, I do not drink from my cup. All the Gryffindors do, including Potter. Weasel turns red and squeaks.  I assume the Weasley sister, but the bond is flung to the forefront of my memory and I know that it cannot have been the Weaslette. Under my claim, Potter can’t sleep with anyone ever enrolled within Hogwarts’ Hallowed Halls. Having drunk too much for my own good, I say “calm down Weasel, it wasn’t your poor excuse for a sister”
Harry laughed and ran after his best friend. Draco would remember that laugh forever. Hermione gave him a soft smile before rolling her eyes, taking Lunas hand and exiting the common room, Leaving Draco sat there, reeling and realising that perhaps he had never experienced real friendship, if real friendship felt like that morning had.
“Alright, Effie” Remus said, also kissing her cheek before helping her place steaming pots of curry on the table, followed by plates of paratha and bowls of rice. It all looked so delicious and Draco could feel himself salivating as Remus served him a little bit of everything.
“you’re getting changed? What for mate, you know me and ‘mione don’t care what you look like” Ron said.
Draco took a deep breath. He wondered if by telling Harry this he would ruin any infinitesimal chances he had. He hoped not.
“I know, mam” Ron said with exasperated fondness, before he started up the stairs, gesturing for Draco to follow.
“We’re adults, Sirius” Harry said exasperatedly, rolling his eyes at Draco as if it were an inside joke between them, and Draco felt his cheeks heat.
(same night, Golden Trio)
Harry’s heart sank at the lack of reassurance, but he nodded mutely, before apparating back to the club, grabbing Pansy and apparating back to the attic, statute be damned.
Draco was shocked and a little jealous that he capitulated, and tried to focus on soaping himself in the silence that ensued. Luckily for his fragile ego, the shower water covered up any sounds they may have made, and quickly enough to make Draco feel a little better, he heard Harry’s voice.
“Harry, where are you? Everything okay?”
Draco had absolutely no interest in rugby, but he had a lot of interest in Harry, and if Harry was asking, yes was the only answer.
“just on my arse and not in? who knew you were such a prude Blaise”
“you spent the whole year in the tent with me working on wandless magic in case something happened to your wand. If anything, we will be the luckiest group possible, because of how strong your wandless magic is. I will be there. Ron will be there. We will be in the muggle countryside. It will be safe, and you know you can defend yourself wandlessly because you’ve done it before, in much more dangerous situations.”
Bryn’s comments had also heavily implied that Harry was gay… or at least not straight. And surely, if he was dating Hermione, he would have said so. Draco tried to suppress the little flip of his stomach when he realised that Harry was attainable to him as a man, and possibly single. He knew Harry would never go for him anyway, so there’s no point in hoping.
“Come on, then” came Remus’ deep, gruff voice and Draco closed his eyes against the pain as he slid out of the car. Remus looked at him, bemused, before turning on his heel and marching off to the front door of the house.
Harry thought that maybe that one text was enough to make him fall in love.
“right. I’ll put Ted to sleep and then we’ll eat?” Harry said, standing up. “Coming, Pansy?” he asked over his shoulder to her.
But in recent weeks, Harry had been a sounding board and a safe space for Draco, and all Draco wanted was to return the favour. He would endeavour to do his best, to fill all the gaps that Ron couldn’t. Ron was a brother to Harry, and Draco could never replace that, nor would he wish to. What Draco needed was to be the best boyfriend in the history of boyfriends, only he wasn’t quite sure how to go about it. Despite Harry’s reassurances, he still felt as though his asexuality meant he was lacking in some way, that there was more he could-and perhaps should- give.
“Yeah. I wonder what it is?” Harry replied.
I finally remember the claim when Boot shyly says “never have I ever lost my virginity”
The winning team ran back to the changing rooms, whilst the losing team slunk off to their bus to go back to their school and lick their wounds.
“you though, Potter, you don’t do any of those things. You never fly with Ron when he asks, even though he only asks when he’s thinking about Fred too much. You always find an excuse not to study with Hermione even though she does it so she can spend more time with you. You are curt, sullen and impolite. You never attend the Friday eighth-year common room parties, you sit alone in most of your lessons, you’re late to every meal so none of your friends ever get to speak to you. You, Potter, are acting like an arsehole, and you have done for weeks, and now everyone is just a bit sick of it. I know it’s hard to hear. It was hard for me to face how awful I was too, but its necessary. Think about it, whilst I go and see that Hermione is okay”
“it’s okay Pansy. You didn’t know, no one new. I preferred the teasing to pity, honestly” he said, but she just cried harder. He navigated them over to the armchair before turning them. He sat down and pulled her into his lap, letting him cry on his shoulder. After about five minutes, he heard the door open and looked up to see Draco standing there. Harry wrapped his arms around Pansy before saying to Draco “my childhood came up.”
Draco squeezed her even tighter and said “yes, of course you can come and spend time with me, I would love that” Into her hair. She then released him and he looked down and said “it’s probably a no on the film, but I really appreciate your invite”
The answer came after a particularly nasty altercation with Potter after potions one non-descript day. I stormed into the common room, pulled myself up to my full height on that snake carved into the middle of the floor and practically shouted ‘I hereby stake my claim upon Harry James Potter of Gryffindor House’
She giggled and blushed, and said “thank you boys” before perching herself on Draco’s lap. After she had downed a few drinks, they all apparated to an alley next to the club, and made their way inside.
Draco was surprised at how perceptive Harry was. He supposed Harry was right; he had spent a lot of time agonising over whether Harry would like him less, or not at all, because of it.
Soon, they trudged back to Draco’s cottage, hands held and swinging between them as Pansy talked animatedly about the party later. Draco had to keep reminding her there were only three other young people there really, as well as Ginny but things between her and Harry had been frosty at best in recent times.
“I didn’t say I had brought you dinner I said I brought you food” retorted Potter, green eyes bright with mirth. Draco rolled his eyes but crawled over the bedsheets towards Potter, who dumped the food between them and started unwrapping a chocolate frog, scowling when he saw his face look back at him on the card.
“I like you Parkinson. I would like to be your friend.” Harry had said, cradling Teddy to his chest.
Draco sat up front with Remus. He was somewhat surprised that Harry hadn't wanted that seat, but instead Harry and Hermione sat in the back, chatting quietly whilst Draco talked to Remus, who was rapidly becoming his favourite person. His no-nonsense yet friendly demeanour made Draco feel safe.
They changed into stiff black suits when they got there. Harry had wanted to wear as much colour as possible, to show the utmost disrespect, but he didn’t want to give Petunia any reasons to unleash her vitriolic verbal abuse on him, not on such a tough day for both of them.
“Y’alreet?” Ron asked distractedly as he set off again, clearly expecting Draco to follow.
First, it seems as if Harry is gay. Then wedding bells ring when he can recite Draco’s favourite sonnet, and now he’s in love? With this girl? It was all too much. Rugby boys weren't supposed to be like this.
When they arrived back at Grimmauld, Pansy hauled Draco upstairs to get dressed while threatening that harry was not allowed to leave before she did his makeup. Harry and Blaise went to the kitchen, chatting amiably while Harry made brownies. Dean and Seamus floo’d in and the four of them sat around the table eating brownies and chatting. Then Pansy came down in a black dress that left nearly nothing to the imagination and pulled Harry and Blaise upstairs to get ready. After pushing Blaise into the spare room, she commanded Harry take her to his room. He showed her his collection of clubbing clothes, and she chose a pair of deep indigo jeans that clung to him like a second skin, and an emerald green shirt that she, like he had, only buttoned halfway. “are you trying to make me Slytherin for the night?” Harry asked. “No, you  handsome fool, it goes with your eyes. Now you’re dressed, show me how you usually prepare your face for these club nights”
“oh merlin Malfoy you’re going to be so angry at yourself for ruining your clothes tomorrow” Harry laughed, lifting Draco up to position him properly over the toilet bowl. Draco vomited again, and groaned, slumping back into Harry, who was slumped behind him.
“Really? He did all that and I didn’t notice? Fuck, I’m so sorry Draco” he says, eyes sad as he unbuttons the first few buttons of his pristine dress shirt.
He hadn't realised that he had actually said that, out loud until Harry turned to him, face radiating sadness and said “oh, Draco” with a heaviness that no sixteen-year-old should be able to feel.
“If you say so, Blondie” Harry replied, running his fingers through Draco’s hair. Draco was a hundred percent sure he was melting.
He desperately disliked the person he had been at school and the longer he was here the more he could begrudgingly admit that his mother was right. This was a chance for him to have a completely clean slate and decide what kind of person he wanted to be.
He looked at teddy, dozing in his high chair, and at Sirius and Remus laughing about something, and he revelled in how amazing his life was now, even as he ached at the decision ahead of him.
Draco slid in the front on the other side, and they were off.  It was a maybe 15 minute drive, and Draco stared at the fields as they flew by his window, blurred white dots of sheep adorning the landscape. Then, a few houses joined the sheep in the fields, and before he knew it they had entered a little village. The buildings were small and quaint, mainly red brick. They had manicured front gardens and little white fences and Draco felt a little like he had fallen into an Enid Blyton book.
After his conversation with Sirius, it was like a wall collapsed, and in the ensuing weeks Sirius and Draco spent more time together than ever.
“Oh, Draco. What’s up?” he asked, not quite smiling like he usually did, but not looking unfriendly either.
Draco heaved in a breath and set off again. If he hadn’t been so self-pitying and tired, he would have marvelled at how clean the air felt, how fresh the earth smelt, and how beautiful his surroundings were. The sun was bright in the sky, shining benevolently over the fell.
“a poem known to muggles, yes, but written by a wizard” replied Luna as she knelt behind harry and started to plait his hair again- Dutch braids this time.
Pansy yawned and said “you’re not allowed to replace me with her” in a sleepy voice.
“you mean a wizarding one?” asked Narcissa.
He discovered the mazing muggle culture of band t shirts while in Europe, and came back to England with a suitcase full a band t shirts.
Draco coughed, unsure of what to do. He looked at the floor, willing away the blush he knew was on his cheeks as a result of how utterly humiliating this whole situation was. “how about, if I carry the food and camping stove and tent? I wont have room in my bag for your sleeping bag but I can strap it on to the back of my bag. You’d have to take it back if it rained though” Potter said, voice bizarrely and uncomfortably soft until Draco realised that Harry’s green eyes were on his pale hands that were shaking. Draco curled his hands into fists and nodded, before thinking and saying “wait, wont that be much too heavy for you?”
“Of course. Make yourself comfortable” he said, helping her arrange the blankets and pillows before going back to his bed and finally falling asleep.
Suddenly, everyone’s looking at me.
At eleven, Draco came down, and lay with Harry and Teddy and the three of them watched the telly. It felt as if they had been together for years and Teddy was their very own son, which was a strange if not unwelcome feeling.
She was in a white lace top layered over a sparkly pink t-shirt. She was wearing a pink pleated tulle skirt over a pair of skinny jeans and bright yellow trainers. Her hair was swept up and pinned haphazardly with fake flowers that were a bright yellow that matched her shoes. Some of the boys were staring a bit, but no matter how crazy she looked, Draco had to admit that it suited her very well.
Draco buried into the soft fabric and inhaled. He could smell Harry’s cologne and a slight tang of sweat that usually followed the rugby boys wherever they went. Draco usually finds it disgusting but when it was Harry it just... wasn’t. Imagine if the boys could see him now. For all that Theo seemed to genuinely like Harry and Ron, he would probably have a heart attack.
Pansy’s scream shook Harry from his thoughts as the six of them walked in the ever-intensifying heat of the late summer sun. “what the fuck. I didn’t know there were snakes in England. What the fucking FUCK” she yelled, rooted on the spot and staring at the ground in fear.
Bruk off yuh back gyal
“Last night, mum. I went out for a walk and I heard voices in the rose garden, so I went in to see and I- I”
“Shit. Shit fuck Harry I am so fucking sorry oh my god”
He groaned, scrubbing at his face and running his hands through his hair.
“Yea, he’s an arsehole underneath it all though.” Harry scowled, face darkening.
Draco started shivering.
“let me guess, gingers?” snorted Blaise disdainfully
Harry’s night went perfectly. He drank, he danced, he sang, he was so utterly happy, and yet… no matter how many men came onto him, he politely turned them down with a smile and a “no no my boyfriends over there” (‘boyfriend! I wish’ he thought to himself each time he lied), gesturing into the black cave of the dancefloor. Still though, he had fun, and stumbled back to his dorm singing one of his favourite club songs
“Thank you, so much” he said to the two men, who laughed.
“we’re teenagers Hermione, and I refuse to let Voldy take that away from me. I need your help because you grew up with muggles too. I want to host a house party at Grimmauld place. A proper muggle-style one with lights and music and dancing. Muggle booze and everything but I need your help with the spell work. Ron agreed to help set up the kitchen and Parlour, but I’m gonna need your help to magically seal off the rest of the house. I’ve been owling with Dudley” at this, Hermione pursed her lips. She knew Harry wanted to forgive his cousin for the sake of familial peace, but she would happily hex him into next Tuesday for everything he had put Harry through.
“I’m sorry for being a dick at the beginning, but Sirius’ family are  t’worst and I just couldn’t understand why he’d let one of youse stay with us, yeah? And you came and you were so posh and shit and I just, I didn’t like you”
Greg and Vince nodded, clearly just excited at the prospect of stronger stuff. Draco was wary. He liked his friends, but not enough to trust them to look after him during drunken mishaps. Draco would never admit this, not even to himself, but he was abysmal at holding his liquor.
And not a moment too soon. The minute the lock turned, he heard the door open, and heard footsteps come into the room.
…until the first sex scene. Coy, sweet, young lovers on their first time together, all candlelight and romance. Except Draco was so utterly and exceedingly aware of Harry sitting right next to him, the warmth coming off his body. The fact that Draco was red with embarrassment and half hard purely because he was watching a sex scene with Harry in the room. Half hard like he even wanted sex in the first place. Draco wished his body was in alignment with his mind on that one. He was so scared he would be making out with someone, and they would assume that because he was hard, he wanted to do more. Not that he had ever gotten that far with anyone, so this was really wishful thinking on his part, but with Harry sitting next to him, oh boy did Draco wish.
As he descended the stairs, he heard the floo chime and then a steady stream of conversation. “not to alarm you Harry, but there’s a naked baby in your sink” “shut up Ronald” “yes, very funny Ron. Draco was feeding him, and it got everywhere like always” Draco stiffened, wondering what the response would be. “he’s here?” asked Hermione. Draco took this as his cue. “yes, I’m here I was just collecting some applesauce-less clothes for the little man” he announced as he strode into the kitchen. He gave the clothes to Harry then turned around, taking in a deep breath. “Ronald, Hermione. I wish to express my deepest apologies for my behaviour while we were at school and during the war. I was an abominable excuse for a person, and I did many many awful things over the course of those seven years. I am not asking forgiveness, or looking to excuse my actions. I just wanted to tell you both that I am deeply sorry for all the pain and suffering I have caused you.” Draco looked at the floor as harry ushered them all into their seats, and began serving generous slabs of chocolate cake, the largest of which was placed right in front of Ron. “aw mate you made my favourite” the ginger exclaimed happily, before digging in. “Ronald! You’ll choke!” trilled Hermione, sounding so much like Molly Weasley that Harry laughed. The tension was cut, and Hermione turned to Draco, putting a slender brown hand atop his porcelain one. “thank you for apologising Draco. While I cannot say that I fully forgive you for your bullying, I can accept that it was in the past and move forward. I am glad that you are here for Harry and Teddy. If Harry trusts you with his baby, then I trust you.” Said Hermione in that diplomatic way of hers. Draco smiled slightly at her. “any mate of Harry’s is a mate of mine” said Ron through a mouthful of cake. “Ronald you are disgusting” scolded Hermione, smiling at him with a face full of so much love Draco had to look away. “see, that went really well” Harry leaned over to whisper in Draco’s ear, patting him on the knee. The warmth of Harry’s hand on his knee brought Draco back to the present, and he began to do his best to join in with the conversation. “Draco’s going to become like an au pair. He’s Ted’s cousin so it makes sense and it’ll make life here immensely easier.” Said Harry casually. “he’s not moving in, is he Harry?” asked Hermione casually. “oh no, ‘mione, we’re not going full muggle. He’s going to come round at 9 three days a week to help me with Teddy and in return I am going to introduce him to the muggle world in the hopes of dispelling the prejudiced brainwashing he experienced as a child.” Draco felt uncomfortable at how accurate Harry’s description was. He really had been brainwashed. He used to think he was such a strong individual, but during the war he realised he was just a Lucius 2.0 and he hated it. He had stopped wearing wizarding robes even, in an effort to gain back just a crumb of his sense of individuality. His voice was hoarse when he spoke. “yes. I am desperate to learn about muggles. I realised almost a decade too late that my parents were wrong but as an only child who grew up on an estate I never really left, my parents were essentially gods to me, and gods are never wrong. Now I see them as the flawed humans they are, unfortunately all too late. But I would like to try now, better late than never as muggles say. I’ve eschewed robes entirely for muggle clothing, but as I still live at the manor that is as far as I have been able to go. Harry here will be my guide.” Draco hadn’t meant to say so much to company he was not at all close with, and he felt vulnerable, but he also felt that it was the right thing, and perhaps vulnerability wasn’t the Satan-spawn his father had made it out to be. “yea I have loads of ideas. There are so many museums in London, and I want to see them all. I want to take Ted to the globe, and the cinema, and for walks along the river” Harry gushed, his mind full of plans for adventured Ted probably wouldn’t remember. Harry could photograph them though, and they would help Draco, which Harry was definitely looking forward to.
“I cannot thank you enough, lads. Honestly, not many people would have done that.” Theo said, leaning across the table to them.
Ron pulled a face. “don’t I bloody know it, mate. She’s constantly offering to babysit Victoire, and it’s worrying me”
“I want to. This is what mates do, yeah?”
“as you did Potty” said Blaise, grinning, and soon the two were swinging their hips to ‘I feel love’. Harry made sure to keep a respectful distance between them, mindful of Draco’s feelings.
‘Good for them’, he thought, before pouring himself a vodka lemonade that was 60% vodka and 40% lemonade. Harry grabbed a beer and Draco repressed a shudder. To him, beer was piss water and only the rabble could stand to drink it.
Mama, life had just begun,
“More than” Draco breathed, before tilting his head, clearly asking for more. Harry answered with another sweet, lingering kiss that left Draco light-headed.
I’m still staring and drinking my coffee when Potter shuffles in, movements weighed by sleep. The article is to be expected. Lots of ‘ex-death eater’ and ‘son of convicted war criminal Lucius Malfoy’ and mentions of love potions. What surprises me, though, is that the final page of the article contains an interview with Hermione, of all people. It starts with “I hate giving interviews, and I want it noted that I am only doing this for Harry and Draco” and it ends with “I have never seen Harry happier”
“I'm not fragile, Draco” Harry all but growled. Draco was surprised to find that he felt scared in the face of Harry’s anger.
“Thank you” Harry said, ignoring propriety and hugging her. He felt her slender hands rest on his back for the briefest of moments before he let go.
It was all becoming too much, and Harry could feel his heart beat quicken. He squeezed Ron’s hand, and the two immediately stood up and slipped out of the church. He could feel Petunia’s eyes watching him leave, burning into his back like a brand.
“it’s lovely to meet you, Mrs Malfoy. You have a lovely home.” Harry said, and Draco could have swooned at his gentlemanliness.
A notable absence at the table, however, was Harry. It made sense that after the last time he would not want to be reminded of the pain, but Draco also thought that if he had lost his parents but still had a grandma, he would want to be as close to her as possible.
Harry saw Hermione’s inquiring glare and so returned to his native tongue. “I travelled Europe before coming here, I wanted a small taste of the youth Voldemort had taken from me before my adulthood began.” He explained.
Sirius raised his hand an inch, as if he wanted to reach out and comfort Draco, but then his hand dropped, the air between them charged with understanding, and sympathy.
Draco felt himself flush bright red from head to chest. His mum was the worst sometimes.
“I wanted to ask how I can post things home, and also if it would maybe be possible for my friend Pansy to come up for a weekend? I totally understand if she can’t stay though, I appreciate that I am here to work, not spend time off with friends.”
One song transitioned seamlessly into the next, and Harry grinned, wide and free as his body continued to move
“You feel how you feel, when you feel, Draco. You can’t help it, okay? And if I'm not in a place to talk about it then I'll tell you, but that’s my decision to make, okay? Not one you get to make for me.” Harry said, and Draco felt both reassured and chastised. He hated feeling like he had upset Harry when all he wanted was to do the opposite. Why was he so shit at this?
He showered in record time, not wanting to overstay his welcome, and raced hurriedly back to his room to change. Theo was asleep in bed again, and so Draco lay back on his pillows and finally went to stalk Harry’s social media. He only had three photos. One of him with an unfairly gorgeous man with long black curly hair who looked a bit like Mick Jagger. They were standing in front of a motorbike, laughing so hard both their eyes were closed. The caption read ‘you can’t be Sirius’
“I’ll do the washing up” Draco said, desperate to prove he wasn't entirely useless. Harry and Sirius merely glanced at him, but Remus nodded and smiled at him, and Draco felt a little bit of warmth in his chest. Remus’ subtle kindness was a sort Draco was wholly unused to, but it was a nice feeling.
Harry and Draco had been together for about four months, muddling along together, juggling Teddy and their budding romance with various degrees of success. There was a lot to work through between them, and Harry was only able to accept forgiveness for the sectumsempra because it hadn’t left scars, and though Harry was of a generously forgiving disposition, Draco’s guilt made it hard for him to accept Harry’s forgiveness at face value. They were happy together, though, and that’s what matters.
Draco nodded and smiled, and some of the light went back into Sirius’ eyes. Sirius led him to a garage a little ways off from the big farmhouse, inside which was the land rover that Remus had first picked Draco up in about three days ago. Sirius eased his way in. He looked stiff and ungainly but not in any pain.
“you’re fucking bevved, Draco” he heard Harry say from somewhere above him. Draco hummed in agreement, before feeling Harry shift and stand beside him. He grumbled in protest, before he felt hands haul him to standing too. He was entirely unsure of where they were going- between his state and the darkness he could barely tell up from down- and soon Harry was tugging him back down again. He flopped onto his back in the grass that he found underneath him. He didn’t know where Harry had taken him- the school grounds were sprawling, and it was too dark to tell which buildings were which.
“I mean, I can understand why he didn't,” Draco said softly.
Draco felt sadness at the resignation of his tone, but he also wasn't naive enough to think that everyone was accepted everywhere. He was also burning to ask what they had done for Harry. Sirius didn't seem inclined to share though, so he tucked it into the mental folder he had of Harry, which already included being called James, and the sadness it caused.
“Yea, but this is about you, not me. What will make you feel better? A film?”
As Harry re-watched the scene, he honestly thought he was going to be sick- was it possible to be sick in a pensive?- he was sure this was the end of the wonderful thing he had with Draco. Harry couldn’t look at Draco as Blaise kissed him, as Harry shoved him away, scolded him, and Blaise left. Harry made to pull out of the pensive, but the memory hadn’t ended yet. In his haste, he had pulled out the whole memory, including him practically confessing his love for Draco to Dean. Shit, shit and bollocks. He hadn’t intended for Draco to know that… yet. Oh fuck, it kept getting worse.
Draco arrived last back at Grimmauld, and stumbled out of the floo to see Harry intensely focussed on the book Draco had given him. The sight made Draco’s heart squeeze; the furrow of his brow and his eyes travelled relentlessly across the page.  Harry was so invested he didn’t even acknowledge Draco’s presence, and not wishing to disturb him, carried on up to his room.
“I say lads, who are we all bringing to the Halloween ball?” said Theo, clearly wishing to flaunt his steady girlfriend. The ball was next Saturday, the final day at school before the two weeks off for October. The school hosted it every year, for years ten through thirteen.
Harry smiled at her sheepishly.
“Draco, Draco” Harry was saying, but Draco ignored him.
Once he’d finished, he steeled himself, and stood at the end of Harry’s bed.
After what felt like an age but couldn’t have been more than a few minutes, Pansy and Draco withdrew their heads. A few tears were silently winding down Draco’s cheeks, and Pansy looked livid.
Someone had hung some lanterns, which glowed a comforting orange in the summer night as Draco and Pansy followed Sirius and Remus out of the house and to the big table.
With that, Harry turned heel and left, leaving Draco with the stranger who’s name he now knew was Ron.
“Oh, pansy and I aren’t together, she’s just my friend” Draco said
On the other hand, Vernon died before he got to see Harry succeed despite the abuse. And, even deeper, a chain in the last, biological link to his parents was gone, and Harry felt them slip even further away from him. He felt tears well in his eyes, even though his chest felt empty and cavernous.
“REMUS” Sirius yelled, and the man came running.  “What is it, love?” came Remus’ gruff voice. Remus walked in and stood behind Sirius’ chair, bracing his hands on the armrests and leaning over to look at the screen.
Harry drinks deep from his mug, letting the heat and sweetness fill him up and calm him down, before he explains the events of the night before, and Pansy’s speculations about Blaise.
This was all getting to be a bit too much. He didn’t know what about him warranted him receiving so much of Harry’s attention, but his heart could barely stand it, and now Harry was talking about being mates with Draco’s friends. Even the anxiety coursing through him couldn’t drown out excitement at the prospect.
“stop encouraging him, Harry.” Hermione huffed again, before walking up to read the list. “no, no, no you’re both right this is bad very bad awfully bad extremely bad.”
“Yeah, that’s okay” harry said, reeling as the words ‘your uncle died’ echoed around his head. He had never, ever seen Vernon as an uncle. Just always ‘Vernon’ or ‘Mr Dursley’
“Hiya love” she said, kissing Ron’s cheek loudly before she turned to Draco, who was standing awkwardly in the hall.
Ron just lifted the corner of his duvet in a silent invitation, and Harry threw a t-shirt on before climbing in next to him. It was reminiscent of the Christmases Harry had spent with Ron’s family when he was younger, when Harry was weak and underfed and terrified of adults and so stuck to Ron’s side like glue. They had shared a bed then, Harry unable to sleep by himself without being wracked with night terrors of cupboards and beatings.
“I am at that. Only five left to lamb now, hopefully not before morning. Ron’s coming in a bit to go up with me”
He had actually refused to apply to any university, yet another grave sin in his father’s eyes. He had called it a gap year to appease his father but he didn’t know if he ever wanted to go to uni. He knew he was young and such a decision should be taken less lightly, but with every week spent on the farm, the idea of Draco claiming the cottage as his own and staying for the next few years- longer, even- got more and more appealing.
He looked too good for so early in the morning and Draco was suddenly very aware that he was in yesterday’s clothes, stand of whiskey and had bed hair that probably made him look a bit deranged.
“The bar's in hell if it means being better than aunt Bella” Draco said and Sirius snorted and gestured for him to sit down.
And he hadn’t expected Harry to look so fit. They had both reeked of sweat, but Harry’s eyes were so bright and his shorts were so short and even though he had been coming from the gym he could just as easily been coming from a one-night stand for how his hair looked.
“You know me too well, mate”
“Oh?”
In the few short hours since Draco had been there yesterday, the village had been adorned with bunting in cheery pinks and yellows and blues, and once again Draco feels like he’s wandered into an Enid Blyton book. This England is miles away from the London mansion and private school and skyscrapers he’s used to, and it’s jarring. He feels almost as if he’s in a foreign country.
Draco was fixated by the sweat running down the golden-brown column of Harry’s neck as he sang impossibly high “Galileo, Galileo figaro”
“it’s Teddy’s bedtime now, but the two of you are welcome to stay for more tea, if you would like.” Harry said, bending to take the infant from Narcissa.
“let’s get you to bed then” said Harry, unsure of how to respond to such affection. He picked Draco up, bridal style again, marvelling at how lithe and light Draco was in his arms. Draco snuggled into Harry’s chest, and Harry once again felt uncomfortable at the affection. He knew emotions ran high when drunk, and he didn’t want to make Draco cry, or give him the wrong idea. Harry was still trying to figure out his feelings.
Draco hadn’t noticed that darkness had fallen during his sojourn in the kitchen, and Harry was swallowed by blackness. Draco was too used to the light pollution of London and was startled by the impenetrable blackness of the air around him.
“that’s not what I meant, but being there for you doesn’t mean putting my insecurities on you.”
He opens the door, which creaks, alerting his mother to his presence. She looks up and gives him a glowing smile. “Draco, sweetheart! Where’s Harry?”
Draco choked. How could Harry be both so perfect and utterly unattainable?
“so you mean to tell me you spent all night at a gay club and then came home to sleep near-naked in the same bed as Thomas and Finnegan?” the blond spluttered. Blaise chuckled at him, and Pansy sighed and said “I wish I had been in that bed”
“a friend you fuck?” I ask again, sceptically.
After what must have been hours but didn’t at all feel like long enough, there was another knock on the door.
It all shattered around him on the first of January. Harry returned home to see Sirius and the lawyer who did the custody proceedings sat on the sofa. His heart shattered, and for one agonising moment, Harry thought he would be going back to surrey. back to the abuse and starvation and horror that had been the Dursley's.
Of course, Harry still spent masses amounts of time with Ron, and Hermione, but now they were together it left him a lot of free time to see Draco.
“You were t’one to teach me about boundaries. What am I supposed t’do when she won't respect them?” was Harry’s reply. Draco inched closer to the door.
He stills and turns around, looking at me expectantly. I know what I’m about to say will sound petty and cruel, but I say it anyway. “really, Potter- who was he?” I see him visibly deflate, before he says
The week between Christmas and new years was somewhat calm and relaxed, but characterised by Hermione and Harry sneaking off downstairs, heads bent together and furiously discussing some sort of spell work.
It was so cute how nervous he was. Harry hadn't considered partnering with anyone else, really. Their merged friendship groups meant Draco was the ideal partner for projects like this.
“if I were ever to share, you know Dean and Seamus are first in line” said Draco, sticking his tongue out at Blaise.
“good evening Eighth years. I hope that you had a pleasant dinner, and that you are all excited for your excursion tomorrow morning. When you return to your rooms tonight, there will be a muggle camping backpack for you to pack necessary clothes and toiletries. Tomorrow you are expected in the great hall at six a.m sharp. There you will be given tents, sleeping bags, camp stoves, food and water bottles. The water bottles are charmed to constantly refill, but the food has been selected by the muggles we consulted when planning this endeavour. I would recommend that you all get an early night, and ensure that your routes have been planned thoroughly, I can assure you that you will not wish to set up your tents in the dark without access to magic.”
Draco tried not to be offended that Hermione assumed he’d judge Harry and Ron for their decisions, but he also had to concede that it was a valid observation to make, and had she told him when he had first arrived he probably would have reacted with disdain.
“I know you don’t Potty dearest, but as his closest friends Blaise and I do. You would do it for Weasley and Granger. Speaking of whom, where is your entourage?”
Malfoy, Draco. Potter, Harry.
“Draco? Y’alright?” came Harry’s deep voice from the other side of the phone.
Luxury, by Azalea Banks (i disagree with her views but as a song this is a popular gay club one)
His friends didn’t make it easier.
Draco also saw his body changing as he steadily gained weight and muscle, what with the work he was doing and the hearty British fare he was eating. There was a full roast with trimmings every Sunday, more often than not with the whole Weasley clan, and his arms were getting stronger as his waist got a little thicker, alongside his thighs.
“the more the merrier”
“Vernon has cancer. It’s not- it doesn’t look good. He's not gone yet, but he will, and soon. The council demanded you be invited to the funeral, whenever that may be, and so I am here to extend that invitation and make you aware of his circumstances.”
I never thought it possible, but I became sick of the sound of my own name.
However, he didn’t think it right to ask what felt like quite an invasive question when he knew none of these people, and essentially they had taken him in out of the good of their hearts given that he certainly wasn’t going to be able to work sufficiently to earn his keep.
“Yea, that’s what all my mates say” Harry said, laughing self-deprecatingly.
“Molly made it” Sirius said from where he was sitting down, his cane resting against the table beside him.
In turn, Draco told her about the farm, about how kind Sirius had been, how at home he felt there. He spoke of how nice it was to see role models in Remus and Sirius, and of course, he spoke about how fit Harry was. The latter was done in hushed tones, their heads bent close together with lots of giggling breaks. Draco loved being with Pansy, she was a safe space for him and he always felt like he was fifteen again around her.
Hermione stood and sniffed when Draco got to the front door of his cottage. “Keys are front pocket” he said and Hermione stuck her fingers in and pulled them out, opening the door for them. She flopped onto the sofa and Draco handed her a cup of tea, setting his down on the little lamp table next to the sofa alongside the biscuits.
“That’s not clothes for the farm, lad”
He is woken by strong arms crushing him as he flails, forcing his limbs to stillness. He doesn’t wriggle out of Harry’s embrace when he’s calm, and Harry makes no move to let go. Just as he’s once again on the brink of sleep he hears Harry heave a huge sigh.
“I tried to apologise” came Harry’s protestation to whatever Hermione had said.
Draco thought about his asexuality. He didn’t see it as a ‘deep dark’ secret, but he was hiding it from people nonetheless. He told Hermione though, which has to count for something, he thinks.
After lunch (and copious amounts of cake),  Draco took her on a tour of the farm, avoiding the fields with the cows and pigs, because he didn’t trust himself alone with them yet, but he led her through the throngs of sheep, and showed her the barns, and the chickens, and the wide stretching fields.
Draco hesitantly climbed back onto the bed next to Harry, who immediately flopped back so he was lying horizontal across the bed, his legs hanging off the edge. Unsure of what to do, Draco dithered there before a hand reached up and pulled him back by the shoulder, until he was lying next to Harry.
The film was great, just as the last one had been, but Harry was more concerned at how tense Draco was when lying next to him, a world away from how comfortable and relaxed he had seemed the last time they watched a film together, even with the weight of his parent’s marital problems weighing on him.
He didn’t know what to do with himself. He felt loose, untethered. On one hand, he knew he would never have to suffer abuse at the hands of Vernon Dursley again. His wrist ached from when he broke it when Vernon pushed him down the stairs. He stared at the burn scars from years of being forced to cook.  he put his hand to his upper thigh, where the clearest evidence of the abuse lay, hidden under his underwear.
Draco doesn’t reply, but rather takes a risk by dropping his head onto Harry’s shoulder. He relaxes when Harry rests his cheek atop Draco’s head, and it’s all Draco can do not to squeal. This is the most intimate he has ever been with a boy, which is very embarrassing but also so, so nice to experience.
“Blaise hasn’t- has he ever done anything like this before?” Harry asked, unsure of what he wanted the answer to be.
“with the war, and the aftermath and everything we went through, everything seemed to get better. We were bonded in our ostracization, and with Blaise and I moving in together, and Draco finally released from Lucius’ shadow, it all seemed to come together. We finally got to be teenagers, and form the friendships we would have, had our parents not dictated our lives with their politics.
“who’s the ex then? I didn’t see any girls I didn’t recognise near you yesterday” Draco said, curiosity winning over self-preservation.
Draco read along, muttering under his breath. It read; ‘Sirius, what a lovely surprise to hear from you. So nice to hear about Draco, as well, though I have never met the boy. I am delighted at the prospect of correspondence with you. The ‘black sheep’ of the family, if you’ll pardon the pun.’
I walk my days on wire
“Pansy chose this one, what do we think?” asked Harry.
Harry couldn’t be considerate. If he turned out to be kind, Draco would never be able to drag himself away from this. Not that he wanted to now, with Harry’s green eyes boring into Draco from behind his glasses, his dark skin glowing in the midday sun, such a contrast from Draco’s alabaster. Draco wanted to keep this moment forever.
“I should hope not, I mean no offence Ron, but it doesn’t really go with the whole ginger thing”
“Hey, Harry. I was wondering if maybe you wanted to be my partner for the French project?”
“There will come a soldier, who carries a mighty sword
“Nice to see you adults getting along then” laughed Sirius. “I’m going to go and find the love of my life, can the both of you entertain yourselves while I’m gone?” Sirius asked, heaving himself out of his chair and walking out of the room more smoothly than Draco had seen in recent days. It must be a good day for him, then.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts when Sirius announced that he would think about inviting her to the farm. Draco didn’t understand why Sirius didn’t just do it straight away, but not only was he young and likely couldn’t understand the nuances and complexities of Sirius’ feelings towards his family, he had also only been away from his family for some weeks, almost two months or thereabouts, whereas Sirius and Andromeda had been cast out of the Black’s for years.
Speaking of, Harry and Ron had wandered around the square and were currently chatting to an elderly woman who was sat knitting and surrounded by little kids munching on what looked to be cucumber sandwiches. As Draco ‘observed’ (spied) he saw a tall, lanky, brown haired boy who looked somewhat greasy slink up behind Harry and Ron, placing his hand on Harry’s forearm. Draco saw Harry and Ron stiffen, and Ron stepped up closer behind Harry, his height making him look surprisingly threatening.
When his breathing calmed down, Harry sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck, and said to Draco, “sorry if the music was too loud, I use it to drown out everything else, and your apology affected me more than I had anticipated… n-not in a negative way” he sputtered when he saw Draco’s face fall. “I’m going to shower now, so you can have some peace”. Harry turned, yanking off his t-shirt as he went, and Draco was left staring at the brown muscled back as it entered the spacious ensuite at the back of the room. Draco flopped back onto the bed, sighing dramatically and desperately praying that a sweat soaked Harry would not grace his dreams that night. His prayers went unanswered when Harry opened the bathroom door, steam curling around him, wet hair curling around his face and down to his shoulders, water droplets running down his abdomen to wear a towel was carelessly draped around his hips. Draco dragged his eyes away, going back to his book, and harry wordlessly got ready for bed, tied up his still wet hair (that’s why it’s always a mess, thought Draco- he never dries or brushes it!) and turned the lights off with another wave of his hand.
“Does it do takeaway?” Harry asks, and Peterson frowns slightly. “I thought we could go out for lunch one day next week, as a change” Peterson said, stepping subtly closer to Harry. I’m clutching the stem of my glass so tightly it’s a wonder it hasn’t snapped yet.
And I’m not saying that to be snobbish, but god I hate them and they hate me. I always feel so… small when I come here. Everyone’s in love with Harry and despite the fact that we’ve been in a loving and committed relationship for the past five years, I am still seen as a mere…obstacle in the pathway to the saviour.
Seamus whistled and Dean said “you look FIT Harry”
Narcissa beamed when he gave her the photo, holding it to her chest in much the same way that she had held Teddy.
Harry settled his hands on Draco’s waist, and Draco cupped Harry’s face, tilting it upwards
“Where’s Ron?” he asked once everyone had finished eating.
“we look happy” I say instead. He nods, smiling at me as if he knows what I was going to say. it’s too early for love, even if I suspect that I am feeling it.
“Oh, are youse two shagging now?” Bryn said, eyeing them lasciviously.
“I really enjoyed myself. We don't have things like that, but I wish we did. There's no real sense of community where I live”
Having gotten his timetable, he strode down the echoing, drafty corridors of the ancient stone castle that housed the main school offices, going towards his French class.
“I’m sorry, mum” he whispered. She said nothing, but kissed the top of his head.
The woman turned and smiled widely. She gathered Harry, then Draco up into her arms.
Soon, Pansy fell asleep, the balmy summer air and stillness lulling her into a gentle doze, and Draco lay, head pillowed on his hands as he stared at the blue expanse of the sky. He was startled when he heard heavy footsteps and looked up to see Harry walking towards the apple trees. Draco waved when Harry looked over, and to his surprise, Harry changed course and started walking over to them.
“I assume it's dinner?” Draco asked to cut the tension and Harry nodded before turning around and walking back to the house. Hermione just hooked her arm through Draco’s and they walked back together. Sirius looked somewhat surprised to see them arrive together but Remus just smiled and Draco got the feeling that Remus was under-appreciated as a silent observer, and likely knew everything there was to know about everyone in his life.
“Seems like quite the crush” she said, winking at him. Draco choked on his hot chocolate, spraying it all over his Egyptian cotton sheets.
‘what are you doing?
Harry grinned and made his way to Draco’s room.
“Potter, you have spent every day of your life since age eleven being told that you are a Good Person, capitalised. You are the saint, the saviour, the golden one, the epitome of goodness in our world. Eventually of course, through no fault of your own, you believe this. You internalise the belief that you are a Good Person, again capitalised. When you look in the mirror, you see a Good Person. When you talk to your friends, you talk to them as a Good Person. Forgive the intrusion, but the first eleven years of your life were spent believing you were worthless, yes?”
The rest of the holiday was a whirlwind of kissing Draco; going to Draco’s house, walking around his grounds, going on long walks in the countryside.
“Distraction first, talk later? I want to hear about you and Cedric” Draco says.
“of course not you wally I meant me and you! This is your room too, and you’ve been supportive me, ‘mione and Luna, and you brought me treacle tart. We’re friends, Malfoy, no matter how much you like to pretend we’re not.”
Soon, Harry was three tequila shots in, loosing himself to Donna Summer, and wishing he could do this every week. Unlike what Draco had insinuated, Harry was greatly desired by muggles and wizards alike. He suspected the mix of dark skin and green eyes, and the fact that he had visible scars made him both attractive and mysterious. The muscles he had gained from fixing the house up, and constantly carrying a baby also helped. The intoxicating sounds of ‘I feel love’ filled him top to toe, and he lost himself to the music. When the song changed, he shouted over the music that Dean and Seamus should crash with him that night, and the two agreed. Seamus soon got absolutely hammered, knowing he was sleeping nearby. The night worked wonders on Harry. The three of them stumbled out of the club at about one, but none of them were ready to go to bed yet. Before he knew what he was agreeing to, he found himself in the chair of a sleazy-looking tattoo shop, while a heavily tattooed woman pushed a needle through his ear, then pushed a small golden hoop through the hole. Seeing the club name stamped onto his hand, and recognising it as gay, she winked at him and said “trust me baby, this will drive the boys wild” before wiping it with anti-septic and shooing the boys out the door, saying that the fun she had had with them whilst stuck on the nightshift was payment enough.
Harry answered the phone looking panicked, and Draco worried that something was wrong, but by the time he hung up, it all seemed okay.
“Hermione, what are you doing here?” Harry asked, looking displeased.
Eventually Draco calmed himself down. “fuck” he whispered, stepping away from Harry.
Draco’s mum arrived, laden with cakes from a local bakery, and Sirius led her through to the kitchen, as Harry and Draco stayed in the sitting room.
“Look. Seamus obviously trusts you if he’s inviting you to first night drinks. It’s an institution. But he and Dean are somewhat of an item, and I will not tolerate any bigotry towards them. I know the reputation private school boys have, and we are not like that here. Understand?”
He went to Ron’s account, which was about twenty pictures. Harry, the girl he assumed to be Hermione and a whole host of other ginger boys with faces near identical to Ron’s were in every single one, laughing and hugging. Even though he knew that lives on social media were carefully curated, he couldn’t help but feel jealous at the lives Harry and Ron seemed to live.
