Dolohov dodged, quick as a viper. He grinned, showing two full rows of teeth. He looked deranged— and delighted.
Harry, James saw, was frowning harder, displeased. Then James noticed an equally dark warning look from McGonagall and Slughorn, and he quickly moved onto his part.
Sirius shrugged and went back to his breakfast, though his expression was dark. "Who better to tell when their mistress is acting odd than her faithful house elf? Nobody casting an Imperius can account for every little thing, like whether the victim takes two sugars with their tea or three. Maybe they know they like red wine over white, but do they prefer a Cabernet or a Bordeaux? Goblin-made or French? The best acting in the world can't fool a house elf. She's the first to go. Then the Muggle-born outreach program? Perfect for Death Eaters looking for targets. Midge had a list of names and addresses at her fingertips. Probably took three weeks for her to copy them all down and hand over to the Death Eater cursing her."
Harry saw it in Hermione's eyes that she didn't trust the offer. She would never eat anything produced in Malfoy Manor.
The figures were too far away to judge for sure. It was too dark to see anything other than their general builds, which placed them as adult men, by their tall, burly silhouettes.
"I don't know, sir," said Draco. "Madam Pomfrey survived to my knowledge. She wouldn't meet him in the afterlife."
It hurt. She and Dumbledore were the most difficult to be around because, despite being two decades younger, they still looked like themselves. They looked like
"Alright," said James, pulling the ends of the Cloak closer. "I think I've got a good idea of what Regulus's strategy is going to be. Let's go—"
Black looked like he didn't know what to make of Draco, like he'd never seen anything like him before. Then he threw his head back and barked out a laugh. "You've got the language and the attitude of a pureblood," Black said, still chuckling, "but you have
It took him a moment to realize that, aside from the blood roaring in his ears, the common room was dead silent.
"I'll send for her at once," said Dumbledore and, true to his word, he murmured something to his phoenix. The bird took off through the open window. Then he knelt in front of McKinnon and, said, regretfully, "I would help you myself, my dear, except I seem to have misplaced my wand recently."
"I jumped in front of—" Malfoy broke off suddenly and frowned, looking away. He repeated, more to himself than Harry, "I'm not dead. This isn't right."
about it. Who actually knew the wand movement for the Killing Curse? Even learning the incantation in their fourth year had given James that heady adrenaline rush of
He wouldn't be in any danger, and he'd likely take all the credit afterwards if they caught that sadistic maniac Dolohov.
"I've already told you," said Harry, just as quietly. He strained his eyes to keep sight on the faint shadows within Everest Wands. "I can't go back. Kingsley already said we're guaranteed a position in Magical Law Enforcement, and… and Hogwarts just won't be the same. You know? Not after… not after this. I
"Said they let their house elf go three weeks ago, and then Midge put in overtime in her volunteer work at the Muggle-born outreach program."
"Sirius and Remus were younger," said Harry. "After they died, I mean. When I saw them in the forest."
"I didn't really expect your friend to last this long against Black," Snape muttered to Harry, as the violent, fast-paced duel dragged on. "He must be quite talented."
And there was Wormtail, twitchy uncomfortably under Harry's haunted gaze, painfully shy and inferior.
Harry took a step back from James, unable to look at him, and took an unsteady breath. The adrenaline rush was already ebbing, and his hands were shaking.
"Leeegggsss," Sirius whispered. "You have leeeeeeggggssss, Slytherinsssss. I wantssss your legssss. Snivellusssss, come closer…. Your greasssse will fuel my flaaaaamessssss, and I need leeegggsssss."
As Lily slapped the shit out of him for the thirty-first time ever, and the first time in seventh year, Sirius barked with laughter until he started choking, hacking up more pumpkin juice from his lungs.
"Ron!" Harry shouted, whirling to protect him before another Killing Curse could fly. He stood over his friend, breathing hard and trembling with exertion, but his wand was up and ready.
? Sure, Dumbledore had insisted they not alter the future, but in what possible way could getting rid of Dolohov be
He hurried up the stairs, unable to shake the feeling of Remus looking after him with an amused twist of his lips.
Remus looked at the clock again and raised his eyebrows. "Better hurry if you want to catch Gryffindor's. Ravenclaw went first thing this morning, and Slytherin will be starting anytime now. Hufflepuff is waiting until tomorrow."
"Ah, Harry!" said James brightly, catching sight of him. "You came, after all! Hey, what did you think of that last play with the Peruvian barrel roll? Spent all summer coming up with it!"
Draco didn't look back at his Housemates, but he nodded once and affected his own disinterested look. "Of course. Couldn't be more obvious, could they?"
"That must have been hard," said Remus, and the words sounded pale in comparison to the depth with which he felt them. "I know it's… it's tough out there in the real world at the moment. The worst we have to deal with here is detention. I can't imagine…."
He had almost lost his godfather again before he'd even had him. He had almost just watched Sirius die a second time because Draco Malfoy had, of course, been trained by Bellatrix Fucking Lestrange, who had been Voldemort's protégé.
He was sure it had something to do with the objects being Hallows, but he didn't understand why or how.
Spending the past few days in the library with Malfoy had been uncomfortable at best. It was so strange to be there without Hermione playing taskmaster, without Ron sitting beside him cracking jokes under his breath.
It was the look the adult Sirius gave Snape at Order meetings. It was the look that meant he didn't trust him, that meant he thought Snape was still loyal to Voldemort.
Harry rolled his eyes. In doing so, he caught a glimpse of gold near the ceiling, close to the head table, and had to stop himself from turning toward it like a hunting dog.
Well, if Remus was in on it, it couldn't be too bad, Harry reasoned, returning to his breakfast. Remus would at least warn him if it were terrible.
To his credit, it took longer than his first Sorting. Harry recalled how the hat had barely grazed his hair before screaming "
"We were just on Gimmick Street at Everest Wands in Knockturn Alley," continued Draco forcefully, rushing to get the words out before Harry could argue. "There's Tabbard's Pawn, across the street, like it should be, but Little Snek's Rare Pets isn't beside it. It's a grubby patch of grass, like Little Snek's never existed. And we're standing in the exact place Everest Wands should be, but there's just that grimy old shed attached to the lawyers' office over there. And the lawyers' names should be Hildebrandt and Kosh, but it's Chattem and Sons. It
The snake was a gorgeous piece of magic. Emerald green and antique silver, individual candle flames curved in an intricate pattern to create the illusion of scales.
Bowie bowed off the stage, and Flitwick returned his wand and the bow with a breathless but pleased little titter.
He took the bed next to Severus's in the dorms, he took a seat at the breakfast table next to Severus, and now for the third time, he took the desk next to Severus's in class.
Before Harry realized what he was doing, he reached for Malfoy's sleeve and gripped the fabric as tight as he could.
"Don't be absurd," said Snape again. "Neither of us needs to practice the Shield Charm. We're not idiots, unlike the rest of these mollycoddled children."
Harry couldn't see the look that crossed McGonagall's face, but her tone had gone softer when she said, "Mr. Potter, see that Mr. Parker finds his way to the infirmary, please."
He whipped his wand at Hermione, and then they were dueling madly, like Sirius and Bellatrix at the Department of Mysteries.
It wasn't that dark, wild look of a prankster with a chip on his shoulder. Something in it had shifted, edging deeper into the darkness and away from the wildness. It was more calculating, watchful…
"Now, most wizards choose wands as their weapon. There have historically been exceptions, however, such as potions, broomsticks, and, in the case of Herolda Finnich, two pork sausages, one which was contaminated with Salmonella.
head, so he supposed it was his own fault. As Dumbledore would have said, it was his party. Resigned, he told him, "I must have, if you're here instead of Dumbledore."
"Not so much," said Remus, giving Harry a wan smile. "He's never going to apologize, not to Snape. Uh— I should mention that's what seconds and thirds do in duels. Er, bearing in mind I'm not from a Founding Family or anything… we're supposed to see if there's a way to talk this out before letting it end in bloodshed, from what I understand."
Harry threw the Cloak over himself and headed to Gryffindor tower to return it before his absence became suspicious.
The injuries accumulated. A gash across the face. An arrow of fire through one shoulder. A stinging hex in the eye, a Jelly Legs curse to one leg, shrapnel striking like bullets—
"Welcome, you lot, to the first dueling club practice!" cried Professor Bowie, immediately hushing the chatter from the dozens of assembled students. It was the upper years' practice, mandatory, held separate from the lower years. They were in the Great Hall, the four long tables gone and replaced with a sparkling golden stage near where the high table had sat. He continued, "I have Professor Flitwick here with me as co-coach, since he has won not one, not two, but
James thought uncomfortably of the rumors of Voldemort's Inferi army and wondered, only half-joking, if they had an infiltrator in their midst.
Rosier caught Draco staring, that Saturday morning in line to Hogsmeade, and held his gaze. He smiled, a chilly, portentous thing that emphasized the maniac glint in his dark eyes.
Or maybe Harry's subconscious had thought of Malfoy as Ron: familiar, a friend. And going to Quidditch tryouts with Ron was always a no-brainer.
team? Harry wasn't on the Gryffindor team. He didn't need to spy on the competition like James and Sirius. Moreover, just the sight of a Snitch at breakfast had made him break out in a cold sweat. He didn't know…. It was stupid, but…. The last time he had been on a broom, Crabbe had died. He had been screaming, shrill and animalistic, as flames devoured him. Harry would remember that sound for the rest of his life. The last time he had been surrounded by his friends on broomsticks had been when he'd left Privet Drive for the final time. Mad-Eye Moody had died, killed by Voldemort as Harry and Hagrid tried to outrun him on that horrible flying motorbike, and Harry had been terrified Hagrid had died, too, plummeting from the sky after
The sheets had been rumpled by Severus's less-than-graceful fall and then exit, so Draco didn't immediately notice the wet streaks.
"I think they've been through something bad, Pads," said James slowly, piecing it together. "I don't know what the war looks like over in America, but it sounds like they… well, they might have been
Now, he made sure to telegraph his approach, stomping louder than he would normally walk, coughing as if to clear his throat, rustling in his bag and crinkling parchment. Those who surprised Harry tended to get a wand in their face or, in some cases, Disarmed before they could even blink.
Severus had revealed that Black was an unregistered animagus after the Dark Lord's return. Black was a large, shaggy black dog.
"Another classic Slytherin sentiment," said the hat. "But, Mr. Potter… you walked to your own death."
Two and a half years for Regulus Black to become one of the grasping, decomposing Inferi beneath the surface of a lake in a far-distant cave.
"It doesn't say," said James, continuing to scan through the article. Harry caught a glimpse of a photo over his shoulder, presumably of Henry and Midge Jarlsberger. They were an older couple, probably well into their seventies or eighties, and were holding a trophy of some sort, laughing and bright-eyed. "There were no signs of a struggle. Their wards didn't register anyone outside of the family…."
But Harry reminded himself that this wasn't his McGonagall. She hadn't survived Dumbledore's death yet. She hadn't fought Death Eaters roaming the halls of her beloved Hogwarts, and she hadn't turned the school she loved into the last foothold, the last stand of the Light and then watched it be smashed into rumble and bones.
Severus-the-teenager was a hard kid to get to know, though Draco could hardly blame him. Even after a single night in the Slytherin dungeons, Draco could tell Severus was an outcast. Elodie Greengrass had been the only one to speak to him with any civility. Their dormmates were crude and mocking, and it was clear they found his status as a half-blood something to torment him over. The other years actively avoided him as if he were contagious, and Severus made no attempts to ingratiate himself with any of them.
Draco rustled through a sheaf of parchments on the desk and finally unearthed a small, scrappy bit like someone's last minute shopping list.
Draco and Severus entered the great hall for breakfast that morning, Draco still in turmoil. He spotted the seventh year Gryffindors at once. Potter Senior and Black were in the center of the table, the center of attention, as usual, while Harry sat farther down the table toward the end, between the young Professor Lupin and his redheaded mother. They were having a much quieter conversation, more suited to the early hour. There were dark bags under his eyes, Draco noticed, much like his own.
. Peter, for example, was an anxious sort in general, but he became an honest-to-God comedian when he had three or four butterbeers. Best thing ever.
"Oh, yeah, that I believe." Malfoy sounded placated. Then, uncertainly, "What… precisely did you say? He's not stopping. Oh, Merlin, you've broken him. A lightning strike he survives, no problem, why not? But I leave him alone with you for five minutes and—"
"You saw him at the welcoming feast," said Sirius, suspicion and distrust flaring in his blue eyes like unholy fire. "He had no appreciation for our hard work! He looked
"Maybe that's why You-Know-Who attacked their school," Peter spoke up, his voice small and his eyes darting to each of them to gauge their reactions. He must have found something encouraging, because he continued a little stronger, "If they teach powerful magic like the Patronus that young, and maybe even something that helped deflect a Killing Curse, then wouldn't You-Know-Who see them as a… as a threat?"
Harry crossed his arms. Ron held Hermione close against his side. Hermione's eyes glinted with a hard, bright light.
Harry felt his hackles rise, and he looked away from his future godfather. "Dunno," he muttered. "Must have heard it somewhere, mustn't I?"
"You'll still have Peter to cheer for you in the otherwise deserted stands," Remus told him with mock solemnity. "But I, for one, thought this would be my only chance in
"Thanks," said Remus to Harry, turning to ignore the scuffle happening right in front of him. He leaned back to avoid one of James's flailing legs. "You're very good at that shield charm."
Harry took it and wrapped it around himself with a vague sense of amusement and befuddlement. It was warm from Malfoy's body heat, heavy with the weight of expensive fabric, and lined with something surprising soft. He pulled it a little tighter, appreciative. "Thanks, Fake-Malfoy. Come on."
"I think he's waiting for us to do a trick," James whispered to Lily, on top of whom he was still lying. "Quick, let's kiss. It's the only wa—"
"Uh," said Harry, blanking. "Well, I guess I saw this guy turn his head into a shark's once. Maybe that?"
"We talked about this, Prongs!" Sirius said, clinging to one of James's arms while Remus braced himself bodily against the other. "Stick to the plan!"
him leveling Sirius a scathing look. "I am considering it, however. I've always made a handy Keeper as well as Seeker, and the spot is open."
Harry loved Albus Dumbledore. He loved him in the way he suspected family loved each other: unconditionally, even when he didn't necessarily agree with him.
Harry shook himself. It didn't make sense, but there was no one he could turn to. Ron and Hermione were gone— weren't even born yet but also just
It was easy to forget he was nothing but a coward when push came to shove. It was easy to forget he was useless, nothing more than a scared little kid in the face of the real world and its problems.
She had never placed her last hope, the lives of her students and friends, into the hands of Harry Potter.
"It wasn't with them," Harry assured her quickly. "It was, uh, Mallory's idea actually. He was trying out for the Slytherin team…."
It had taken some time for them to figure out what was different, but once Peter had pointed it out with all the acumen of a prey animal, it was undeniable.
," said Sirius, throwing an arm around Harry's shoulders. It was less a companionable gesture and more a vise, trapping him in place. "Were you friends with a
"No," said Remus, straightening. He paused, and something in his posture shifted, softening. He sighed. "Listen… I love you guys, you know? You were my first and only friends for a long time. But Sirius, Harry
When he saw those warning signs, he redirected conversations as quickly as he could. How much it helped, and if any of the others noticed, he couldn't tell.
Harry didn't know why. Voldemort had occupied that home. His followers had bled their darkness into every nook and cranny. He could only imagine the number of innocents who had lost their lives to the Death Eaters for
"Thank you," he said. Without further ado, he started waving his wand and muttering enchantments over McKinnon.
But the pureblood lines were too well documented, too well known to sneak in without revealing himself, and so he gritted his teeth, bowed his head, and reminded himself he'd asked for this. He'd wanted to be with Severus just a little longer. He'd wanted to see just a little more of his poorly used godfather before he returned to his time and Severus was gone forever.
James laughed and held out his hands in surrender. Inwardly, he calculated how much quicker they could get to the Hospital Wing if they took that secret passageway behind the bouquet of sheep portrait.
"Well?" he asked, breathless from exertion but still grinning. "Am I as good a Keeper as Seeker, do you think?"
Understanding flooded through Harry. He hesitated and then grabbed Malfoy's forearm and gave it a light squeeze, startling a swift, surprised glance from Malfoy before he again pretended nothing was happening.
"Right," said Harry, ducking his head to hide his expression. Remus was more understanding of his… camaraderie… with Malfoy, but he didn't want to advertise he meant to see the Slytherin tryouts rather than Gryffindor's. "I'll— uh— just grab my cloak and be off, then."
He pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and stared at it. He trailed his fingers across the familiar, woven-water fabric.
"You say that every time, Padfoot!" James shouted, wrestling him for position on top. "But it's a pipedream! A
? Is that why… I mean, it's just the two of them so maybe not, but… what if that's why Mallory and Harry are here?"
There had been a look in his startling green eyes when he'd approached them like he didn't know whether to break into laughter or tears. The look had been so intense, James's heart had skipped a beat when those haunted eyes looked directly into his.
Harry wouldn't be a problem. He'd have to be more alive to run to a teacher over what they were about to do.
"Get lost," said Harry, so quietly he doubted anyone could hear him, but the three nevertheless straightened indignantly, "or I will kill you where you stand."
"Yeah," said Sirius, "or maybe another great black dog will find his way to pissing all over your bed."
They were stuck. They were stuck in 1978, away from the world they knew and instead in an era with a brand new Lord Voldemort rising.
this year. And then, after that is done, you may choose three terribly generous individuals to help clean up the rest of this…" he gestured to the dirt and fertilizer, the puddles of water, the carnage of raw eggs, "…mess."
"Oh, Minnie." A dreamy look crossed Sirius's face. "The love of my life. 'twould be naught but a pleasure to see her more outside of class, even if it were—"
He had no home. No family or friends. No connections. Salazar, he didn't even have his official N.E.W.T. transcripts to get a decent job. He might as well have been a Muggle-born dropout.
A girl who looked startlingly like Gertrude McKinnon was already there, chatting coyly with a sixth-year boy and his friends. As soon as she saw Harry, however, her eyes widened, and she ushered the boys up to their dorm.
More and more it seemed like a better use of his time than going back to school and spending fruitless hours in the library with Malfoy.
Draco let out a heavy breath and looked out the window onto the pristine Quidditch pitch in the distance.
They could be joking around, throwing around some harmless banter, and Harry would slowly relax with them. It would feel like progress. And then the smallest comment would set him off— a comment on the Chudley Cannons' chances that season, Peter wondering if Li Mei Chang would go to the first Hogsmeade weekend with him, Sirius talking about repairing that damned motorbike he'd bought over the summer from some neighboring Muggles, James bemoaning how his parents were still suffocating him at seventeen with their twice weekly letters, Remus muttering darkly about having to learn the Patronus Charm even though less than half the wizarding community was capable of producing a corporeal Patronus….
"Prongs, I'm sure they're going just as friends," Remus attempted, holding his wand uncertainly. "She probably just wants to show him around for his first visit—"
"Why would you say that about me?" Sirius's question finally broke the uncomfortable silence. He looked so lost, so confused. "You don't even like me."
. We've got less than nine months before you lot are out in the real world where there's a war on, and at least half of you are going to be targeted. I don't care about the N.E.W.T. curriculum. I care about your lives. Anyone got a problem with that?"
James instantly sensed there was a right and a wrong answer, and he tensed, because Sirius would definitely—
. None of the 'Marauders' can be trusted alone with her except perhaps Pettigrew, but his incompetence makes him useless to me. And then in a few years, when I am in the Dark Lord's inner circle and have ensured her protection myself, I will put in a good word for you, as well. The Dark Lord values competence no matter your blood status. That is why he is interested in
"Oh, I'm sure it can't be that bad," said Lily. "It's a lovely day, and Hogsmeade is really just this cutest little village…."
"Who's is this?" he asked, inspecting it appreciatively. Whoever owned it obviously loved it and took good care of it. The handle was well-polished and conditioned, the twigs neatly trimmed.
would do well not to laugh at the Dark Lord's name," Snape went on imperiously to Malfoy. "Not with the company you—"
But no, that wasn't quite right, was it? There was a version of the Cloak in this timeline. It just belonged to James still.
"You know Rosier's one," said Sirius, shoving his hands deep in his pockets and staring at the floor. "You heard your dad complaining about the new policies his dad's enacting at the Ministry, forcing wizards to have a blood status interview before they can immigrate…. And the Rosiers run in the same circles as the Averys, and Avery would pull Mulciber in because he's shown the right attitude and has the right bloodlines…. Be serious, here, James. You think Snape has been their little cling-on for six years and hasn't even thought about joining them?"
Draco looked around at the gourmet spread that had appeared at Dumbledore's clap and couldn't have felt less hungry.
— hadn't been working with Dolohov, as he'd suspected in the heat of battle. But considering Malfoy's controvertible actions during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry wasn't quite ready to trust him on that.
The most he could do was get to know these people while he had the chance. He and Malfoy could figure out a way to return to their own time any day now, and then the Marauders and Lily would be gone forever. Again.
Remus smiled easily. "I just asked what your plans were for today. Since most of the Houses are holding their Quidditch tryouts, and James and Sirius usually try to spy on the competition…."
Harry stared back defiantly, even with that haunted look in his eyes as if his entire world had shattered around him.
"And, as always, those wishing to try out for their House Quidditch team should submit their names to their Head of House before the last Friday of this month."
Draco Malfoy didn't know why he was pacing restlessly. Since the Battle of Hogwarts, he'd spent most of his time reading in the sunroom, snacking on biscuits from Addie, and discussing his upcoming trial with his solicitor.
have noticed, and Sirius hates Slytherin with a passion. All his family's been Sorted there, and they've disowned him for being a Gryffindor. It's complicated. I'm sorry you got caught up in it."
"I see," said Dumbledore again. He surveyed Draco again with that penetrating blue stare. Draco wondered if he knew what he had almost let slip, that Potter had been expecting
you were dead. I'm going to make it so that the Wizarding World never turns to you again. You're going to spend the rest of your life regretting the first time you ever heard Lord Voldemort's name."
Harry kept placing one foot in front of the other, a habit of not-dying so many times, until he reached his old familiar table, filled with unfamiliar bright faces.
"Prongs," said Sirius wearily, resting his face in his hands. "There was only one condition. The Quidditch one. We've
Draco's lips wanted to pull into a scowl, but he fought to keep a straight face. "Yes. He obviously thought he could somehow defeat Dolohov. It didn't happen, as you can see."
Harry didn't even seem to notice Draco's reaction, didn't seem to think it was anything more than an obvious, automatic response. His gaze was already darting through the courtyard again.
was why he hated Malfoy, why he never should have tried to comfort him. But Sirius— falling through the veil— and Severus Snape (
Harry had gotten a good whiff from it just a few hours ago and could confirm it was whiskey, not Polyjuice Potion. His eyes had watered from the strength of the alcohol, which bordered on moonshine.
"What are you saying?" asked Harry suddenly, giving Snape a hard look. "You say you're warning me, but what do you get out of it? Why would you help me?"
"You're mistaken," said Black, surprisingly soft. "The challenged has the right to choose the weapons, not you."
He wanted to say he was going to the dorm to take a nap, but he knew sleep would be his enemy now, memories and nightmares waltzing hand-in-hand behind his eyelids.
As they got into the strangest slap-fight Harry had ever seen in his life, McGonagall appeared over their shoulder with a deadpan stare.
James leaned back against the tank of the toilet, which he had claimed like a throne as the undisputed leader of the Marauders.
He's been hurt, and he's obviously grieving. And I doubt Mallory is a Death Eater, either. Haven't you noticed how protective he is of Harry? And even when they're arguing, he's always giving Harry this look, like… like he's looking for Harry's approval or something, I don't know. But that's not how real enemies act.
James took the paper with a thanks and then— impressive even by Harry's standards— started to read with one hand and occasionally swipe the Snitch out of the air with the other.
As the fireworks bombarded the Slytherins with blinding flashes of light and ear-shattering booms, the fire-snake exploded in a flare of red and pink gore, and eggs rained down from the ceiling.
Harry floundered, as he did every time someone expressed interest in Ilvermorny. "Er— yeah— we just…"
Harry sacrificed one of the hands covering himself to pinch the bridge of his nose. His glasses, he noticed, were gone again.
"I got you, buddy," said Sirius, and he reached for his own wand, the duck head clamping it in a bright orange bill. A sweep and loop of his wand later, their hands returned to normal.
If anything, it kept him up more at night. Why was he at Hogwarts going to lessons, making friends with Lily, Mary, and the McKinnons, when he could be out there hunting Dolohov down like a
to thwart Voldemort's plans. And instead of making Kreacher drink that potion in the cave a second time, he had done it himself. He had chosen to sacrifice his own life instead of a house elf's, despite everything he must have been raised to believe. And Sirius— Sirius had died rushing to Harry's rescue. Stupid, reckless… wonderful, brilliant, loyal Sirius.
Dumbledore may have been eccentric, even manipulative, but he had a mind that came around perhaps once in a century. Even that she-devil Hermione Granger, brightest mind of their whole generation as she'd been called in countless post-war Daily Prophet articles, wasn't on the same level as him.
With Hermione's sharp eye for detail, Ron's unconventional but realistic wisdom, Harry's grim determination, and the Aurors' experience, they laid their trap.
He wondered for the first time in his life: What could James Potter have done, who could he have been, if he hadn't died so very young?
There was a confused but calculating glint in Malfoy's eye as the silence stretched unexpectedly. Harry could see it as he began to piece it together, undoubtedly thinking of when they had first arrived in the past and Harry had assumed they were dead.
Everything Voldemort had done in his rise to power was terrible, of course. Scarcely a month ago, they had almost lost Gertrude to his sick followers for no other reason than having Muggle parents. But the idea of an entire school full of children falling under his wand…. James didn't want to believe someone even as twisted as Voldemort could do such a heinous thing.
The only bright moment had been when James received a response from his father, letting him know that he had alerted the Aurors and the outreach program alike with their theory, and that it was being taken seriously.
"Interesting," said Regulus quietly. "Are you complimenting Sirius's ability to defend himself, or are you saying you wouldn't come to his defense if I were to verbally eviscerate him?"
"You don't trust me," he said, his voice sounding far away and very, very angry. "That's fine. I don't
It started as a tiny giggle that he managed to force back down. Then his shoulders were shaking with the effort of holding it back, and his eyes were tearing up, and he was doubling over….
Draco whipped out his own wand and, with cold fury, conjured his school-standard wizard's hat from the Slytherin dorm. He snatched it out of the air, stalked past a bewildered Severus and straight up to the center of the Gryffindor table.
If Draco had had any sense, he would have burned it to the ground, or at the very least, left with his parents. And yet, he was still here.
Draco could no longer sleep in the company of others, and that all his dormmates were present or future Death Eaters did not help matters.
"Yeah, you already know the whole conversation as well as we do at this point," Sirius added, sprawled out on his back on the dirt floor of the tunnel.
"If you want to start another Muggle duel on the Quidditch pitch, you'll get your chance in just a moment," snapped Malfoy, getting right up in Harry's face despite the wand between them. "Look, we just spent the last five minutes going over all the traumatic experiences you've had with Quidditch, and that
Sirius had started getting frustrated, James realized, thinking back on it. He hadn't been able to get through Mallory's defense, and Mallory wasn't giving him a good fight in return. Sirius hadn't even been able to make him move from that position Mallory had claimed at the start of the duel like a man planting a flag in the ground or drawing a line in the sand.
Harry glanced at Black again, and Draco didn't imagine the look of disappointment and hurt in his face.
By the end, they were sitting, their legs having given out from under them. They stared at each other in silence, too stunned to react. And then, almost as one, they looked out over the pitch to see where Harry Parker was flying as wild and free as a bird.
"Right," she said crisply, giving no sign that they had gotten to know each other at all in the week leading up to the start of term.
He forced the flashbacks away, back in that place with the ferocious, all-devouring blackhole somewhere deep in his chest.
Harry didn't know how long he stood in the broom cupboard, but a sense of time passing abruptly seemed important.
He wanted to go home. He wanted to go home, where the war was over and his parents were safe and… and he needed
"Get your delectable ass down here and find out!" Black called back, wise enough not to announce their intentions to duel where the professors could hear.
Harry eyed the stout blond boy at the rear of the procession, trying to hide the look of distaste he knew must be on his face.
Cold sweat trickled down Harry's scalp as he struggled to breathe. He found himself swaying, the edges of his vision graying. He tasted blood in his throat as his memory screamed itself hoarse.
"Sorry," said Harry again, side-eyeing his future father and godfather with mounting apprehension. "Just studying in the library with Mallory again."
He found himself trailing the loud ones— Sirius and James, Lily and Marlene— and falling into step with Remus, who was looking at him thoughtfully.
He hadn't liked Dumbledore while he had been a student. He had grown up with his parents complaining of the man far too often to hold anything but disdain for him. But, looking back, Draco regretted.
The illusion-man's wand flew from his grasp and into the air, where it vanished with a flick of Bowie's wand.
If he was planning a secret revenge prank, he was a damn good actor. He seemed genuinely pleased to see Harry.
"Then we will meet with our wands at the Great Hall, you scoundrel!" said Flitwick. He shook his tiny fist for good measure.
The students cheered, ready for a show. Anybody with a question— Harry saw a few Ravenclaw hands go up— was shut up with no sympathy.
"You got it," said Sirius with a flourishing salute, made more eye-catching by the bagel topped with a sheer tower of bacon and eggs that survived the motion. "Screamy McMindfuck it is. You know, the one that—"
Remus found Harry in the library after lunch. He was sitting at a table by himself with a large, dense-looking old book on… the lettering was too small for Remus to see from a distance, even with his slightly enhanced werewolf vision.
"Eh, if this is your first try, I'd recommend going for a mammal," said James. "That way you don't have to worry about different internal organs and such. And something proportional to the body part. And, while we're at it, choose a body part without a ton of individual bones and muscles. The less you have to account for, the easier it is. Try… your ear."
But Flitwick had just managed to Disarm Bowie with a picture-perfect spell, ricocheting it around Bowie's shield charm like a hook.
The hour went by in a blur. At some point, the rejects began to join Harry in the stands and watch the rest of the candidates, and then the slapdash practice of the new team playing together for the first time.
Sirius's smile twitched and then took an even sharper edge. He cast the first spell— yep, there was the fiery orange of a Blasting Curse— and Malfoy countered it with a Shield Charm in the same breath.
The blinded, deafened Slytherins were not prepared to be physically struck by projectiles. They jumped around, screaming and pointing wands, though they had no idea what they were pointing at, because the projectiles turned gooey and slimy after they struck their targets, and what
"No, we won't," said Remus, deceptively calm. "Harry has already been through enough. Harry is struggling. And
It was painful to say, painful to remember the way Sirius had been taunting Bellatrix just before she had gotten in a clean shot. Worse still to be revealing that weakness to anyone else, but
"I don't need a parent's permission," he said. "We're adults at seventeen in the wizarding world, remember?"
"He's still just a kid," said Harry quietly, bracingly. "He hasn't… he hasn't gone through what we have. Not yet. Maybe the Blacks teach their kids some fancy wandwork, but he doesn't
Wordlessly, he cast a cleaning charm on Severus's sheets and pulled his own curtains closed. He sat awake, pretending he was reading into the early hours of the morning.
Draco shoved the idea aside and focused on Dumbledore, leaving a battered Harry Potter to a very determined Madam Pomfrey.
The portrait hole banged open, and James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter staggered through. They looked like they had been rolling around in the Forbidden Forest by the dirt and general disarray of their clothes.
Then the images shifted. He saw Hermione falling under Dolohov's purple curse, that look of surprise still etched on her face.
Sirius was the only one who looked comfortable, lounging behind them like he was at the beach. And he was taking this turn of events much better than James had expected. He seemed pleased,
"Hm?" Harry glanced up from where he was supposedly working on his Potions essay, though he hadn't written more than a sentence in the hour he'd been there. Her question registered, and he caught himself grinning. "Oh. No, I just… I went for a fly after the Quidditch tryouts. It was… nice."
They were hiding something, and it had something to do with the Death Eater families, with the Death Eater hopefuls.
"So," said Sirius, lounging against the door jamb like a damned underwear model. He was fully dressed, but his robes were open, his tie loosened to the point of falling off, and the buttons of his shirt were undone almost to his navel.
That stare, like x-ray vision, pierced even deeper than before. Draco knew Dumbledore wanted to ask what exactly Madam Pomfrey had survived, but he was restraining himself, just as Draco was making an effort to be vague even though he was desperate for Dumbledore's advice.
have hit me or missed both of us. I'm certain it couldn't have hit Potter. But then we woke up in this time in Knockturn Alley, and he was saying the most ridiculous things…."
of them, and Remus… Remus alive and happy, unburdened by the stigma that would plague him the moment he stepped foot outside of Hogwarts.
Harry caught Malfoy's raised eyebrow and unimpressed look, glancing over to see if Harry found it as amusing.
It smelled fresh and free, ozone and wind, the lush evergreens of the Forbidden Forest, the sunbaked grass and the cool-clean water of the lake. The warmth on his face was the warmth of life, not flames. It mixed with the coldness of the wind, flushing his cheeks and the tip of his nose.
"Mr. Parker!" said McGonagall, reacting first. "The last I checked, this was the transfiguration classroom, not the dueling club! What do you think you are doing?"
"Hm," said Severus. He took a drink of his juice, apparently content to let the subject drop, but Draco caught that dark, gimlet gaze on him more than once during the rest of the meal.
Harry had to stop himself from drawing his wand and hexing him in reflex. Then he turned to stare at his former nemesis.
"James won't do anything to upset Lily," said Marlene matter-of-factly. "He's a fool for her. And Sirius Black knows better than to mess with
The older Slytherins seemed to know to leave him alone during that time, but Draco didn't appreciate Potter's little group of Gryffindors throwing insults and a few hexes in the corridors between classes. Potter was never with them those times— he seemed to have been adopted by the Gryffindor girls like a delicate unicorn foal— but Draco couldn't help but feel a little resentful.
"You're a Seeker?" asked James and, as if the Snitch were in on his plan, he caught the flyaway Snitch out of the air, cheeky and effortless.
Harry's heart twinged again. He glanced between Lily and James, one bright and hopeful, the other working furiously on his letter, and then at Sirius, who was adding a layer of cheese to his absurdly tall bagel.
Finally, Snape said, "He is an odd sort, that much is clear. Still, I doubt he can win against Black. A no-name half-blood against the Ancient House of Bl—"
"Yeah, you arsehole, I still remember you dressing up as dementors the next game trying to get a rise out of me, thanks."
That, and the British and American magical governments had never especially gotten along. James's father had always said it was something about how they treated their Muggles, how they were so strict on enforcing their Statue of Secrecy, it bordered on fanatical. Given a magical government even more secretive than the Ministry, plus their distance and disenfranchisement with the British Ministry after the wide-reaching Grindelwald turmoil, James wasn't shocked the Magical Congress of the USA hadn't released details of an attack to the British.
"Quick question, Professor," said Sirius, even as he assumed a dueling stance as natural as breathing. "You're not going to give me detention if I manage to hit you, are you?"
get to blame yourself for that one. Now get your ass on that broom before I beat you with it, you self-aggrandizing
"Say, is that the Prophet?" James asked, catching sight of the abandoned paper in front of Harry's plate. "May I?"
"You know," said Lily, looking between Harry and Malfoy both. "Whenever you need them taken down a peg, you don't have to challenge them to a duel in front of hundreds of witnesses. Just let me and Marlene know. I'm very good at Pilchardo Dispucto, and Marlene is terrifying with a Tentacle Head Curse."
"Don't be idiots!" snapped Draco with as much disdain as he could muster. "It was those bloody Gryffindors, the— what do they call themselves?— the Marauders. Snape had barely sat down."
"Still can be," muttered Harry darkly. "If you ever call my mother a Mudblood again, I'll blast you through those goal posts faster than a Quaffle after a spin-slap."
"Boys," she said, and they froze as one. "Mr. Black, why don't you put your skills to use helping Mr. Lupin? And Mr. Potter, I believe Mr. Parker would appreciate your assistance."
Harry shuffled under his new Hogwarts robes and rubbed at his hair. It felt weird. He hadn't had hair this shaggy since fourth year, and he certainly wasn't used to seeing straw-blond wisps out of the corner of his eye.
The war had taken too many things from him, too, but he hadn't gotten a choice about those. Why would flying be any different?
Sirius, across from James and Harry, gave a fond chuckle. "Oh, Wendall the Wedgie Bat. Or should I use Wiggle Whipperpants this year?"
Black had stopped laughing. He looked at the wizard's hat in astonishment. Then, when he looked back at Draco, there was a calculating gleam in his eye.
Draco sniffed, straightened his shoulders and the arrogant tilt of his jaw, and glided up to the stool. McGonagall placed the hat on his head.
"Don't be ridiculous," said Hermione, in her familiar no-nonsense tone. Harry and Ron pretended not to notice the way she gripped her forearm as if the wound still hurt.
The girl sniffled, gave one last miserable whimper, and slowly lowered her arms. She looked at Harry with dark, bloodshot eyes, dark hair and lashes, with a broken nose and unknown number of freely bleeding wounds.
And here it was. He could Apparate to Spinner's End at that very moment and find his teenage godfather, unmarked, unscarred,
"Miss McKinnon," said Dumbledore, addressing his only known student first. He rose from behind his desk with a furrow of concern upon his brow. "What has happened?"
Harry catalogued the changes. Honestly, he should have noticed the differences immediately given how much time he, Ron, Hermione, and the Aurors had spent studying the street for their surveillance. But didn't they have bigger problems to worry about? Who cared if his imaginary Knockturn Alley wasn't perfect? They needed to figure out how to get out, move on.
Where were the Aurors? Was it their bodies in the front room? And where was Granger? Draco knew she was the real force to be reckoned with among the Golden Trio. Surely, they hadn't gone after
of disputes with that single statement— when Malfoy arrived, a trickle of other students in green and silver flying gear behind him.
Before the class had time to prepare themselves, a cloaked figure had appeared in front of James and shot a brilliant red spell from its wand.
"Don't be ridiculous," said Harry, giving Snape a scorching side-eye. "Didn't you hear Malf— Mallory at breakfast? He's going to beat Sirius. For
He and James had bounded back to their feet, grinning and panting, but Sirius's face turned suspicious as he caught Harry's question.
Never mind, Harry absolutely wanted to melt into the floor. His eyes were wide, mortified, as James and Lily both turned expectant looks on him, one filled with dire warning and the other hidden mischief.
They added two new Chasers— a huge adjustment to any team dynamic, he'd have to keep an eye on that development— and one Beater. Screamy McMindfuck was still going, making James snicker, until Regulus finally put an end to it by burning the bat to cinders and going for a new one.
There had been that terrible power, that darkness and cold that had built around Potter. It had flooded over them in a torrent even as Dolohov had released his curse.
His world was getting smaller, tunneling. He was nothing but labored breathing, a pounding headache, rushing pulse.
Severus shot him a narrow, thoughtful look and didn't speak immediately. He filled his own plate of breakfast food before he finally said, "You didn't need to do that. It was foolish. The Blacks are well-known for their dueling prowess and powerful Dark magic."
Harry remembered seeing through Voldemort's eyes as he'd dug Dobby's grave by hand. He remembered how brutally Voldemort had tortured the Malfoys and Bellatrix for summoning him only to allow Harry to slip through their fingers.
"Oh," said Draco. It hadn't occurred to him that Potter might already have made plans for the day. Plans that hadn't included him. He glanced at Harry, who was unusually twitchy, shoulders tense, hand hovering near his wand-pocket, head on a swivel. He didn't even seem to notice Draco's presence. Draco stopped himself from rolling his eyes. He returned his attention to Lily and said politely, "If it's not too much trouble. I would hate to be an inconvenience."
Then the badger dropped to all four legs and scurried off, startlingly fast. It raced around the Great Hall under Peter's direction, stopping suddenly to sniff or darting unexpectedly toward someone. The students laughed as the badger went to harass the Hufflepuff table, trying to climb on students and nose into their pockets.
"You got banned after the first game," said Malfoy, his voice practically crackling from the dryness, "for attacking me like we were in a Muggle pub fight."
He was shaking. There was something wild and consuming in his chest, too big to fit in his half-starved body, and Harry struggled to fight it down.
, if I ever touched his possessions again. And Draco, the utter prat, was just laughing the whole time like
Draco considered casting an invisibility spell on Potter Senior's and Black's robes as they passed so they'd find themselves in their undergarments in the middle of the great hall at the height of breakfast hour, but even Draco knew how that would go: Potter Senior would no doubt be surprised at first, but then he would grin that idiotic grin so unlike Harry's, strike a shameless pose like a witch in a nudie magazine, and ask Evans (
Potter Senior, Severus, and the few students around them had gone silent, staring in shock at the serious turn of events.
" he cried, but not even silver mist emanated from his wand. His whole face twitched, and he tried again, "
Parker? Someone was calling the name Parker, and everyone was looking at him. Why were these people calling him Parker?
"You two do that a lot," Remus observed. "But you seem to be doing well in classes. Is the curriculum really that different than Ilvermorny's?"
It was their traditional welcoming feast fireworks display. The chatter was dying down across the hall, bellies were uncomfortably full, and students were happily looking forward to returning to their old beds for a blissful night's sleep.
"Gertrude McKinnon died," said Malfoy without preamble. He had that feverous look again, like he had when he'd asked Harry if they were even.
Sirius grew it slowly as it slithered to the edge of Hufflepuff table and slid down… and down, and down, until its tail hit the flagstone floor twenty feet behind its sleek head, its body as wide around as a grown man's torso.
Harry's chest ached suddenly and powerfully, that deep, dark emotion welling up inside him with interminable force.
First, he understood he was lying on something hard. Then he understood he had a body, and, as soon as he remembered that, his body
"Yeah," said Harry again. He was pressing his fingers harder into the table, tapping more insistently.
Harry wished more than anything he could change who Wormtail would become, more than Sirius, more than Remus, more even than his own father.
On the street harboring Everest Wands, the lights were out. The streetlamps as well as the lights inside the various shops. Nobody roamed the street. Nobody was in sight. It looked like the shops were all closed, but Knockturn Alley
"My friends and I were just wondering," she said. "Is Harry okay? Is he still in the hospital wing?"
It was surreal, almost mesmerizing, to watch James toying with it knowing that a Snitch… sometime twenty years in the future, a Snitch holding the Resurrection Stone would bring James back as a ghost.
Then, despite the visceral response to seeing them, the boy had hardly said two words since. He had sunk into the spot between James and Sirius and then picked at his food uninterestedly. Even though he was skin and bones and, beyond that, looked so exhausted he might have spent the day leading up to the feast
There were other Death Eaters in the small supply room, at least six that Draco could see. And— what in Merlin's name?— chains and handcuffs, covered in blood, lying on a table in the center. A table just behind Harry. Behind Harry, whose bare wrists and ankles were bathed in scarlet and gore.
"And what were you and Reggie chatting about before he started shrieking like a banshee?" asked Sirius archly, taking off his gloves and wrist braces.
He stumbled to his feet, finished tucking in the Cloak under his robes, and half-ran from the Great Hall.
Sirius nodded his understanding, and four hands went idly to the wands in their pockets down the Gryffindor table.
Harry didn't answer but, as Malfoy shook his arm with the sleeve Harry was clutching, he forced his fingers to release one-by-one.
Mulciber dropped to his knees he was laughing so hard, clinging to the doorframe to support himself.
The three boys… Harry's eyes darted to their faces, and he felt the already wobbly ground rip itself from under his feet entirely.
friend!" shouted Malfoy, his face suddenly contorting as he shoved Harry back. Unshed tears glittered in his pale gray eyes. "He was
friend," snapped Harry irritably, coming to Ron's defense in an ingrained habit. "I can't remember which one of them it was, but one of them hit me in the back with a Bludger after I'd already caught the Snitch."
Harry Parker was staring at Sirius in horrid fascination. His expression darkened at the mention of Snivellus, though, and took a disapproving hue.
She started swishing her wand before James could stop her. Horrified, he dove across the table at her, shouting like a madman, "No, the wax! THE WAX!"
to greet him in death. Dumbledore, however, continued, "And what prospects do you have for returning to your time? Have you given it thought?"
The fire-badger stood on its hindlegs in the middle of Ravenclaw table, sniffing with its nose up high in the air, its smoky little whiskers quivering.
James was the star of the team. He flew… not quite like a bird. He was steadier than a bird's sporadic, playful flight, and Harry got the impression he knew his weight and knew exactly how to move it to his advantage. He winded around the other players with speed and grace and
"Now, students," said Bowie, with mock seriousness. "Despite being the only two on speaking terms, Remus Lupin and Harry Parker could not fathom a way for us to overcome our immense and passionate hatred of one another. It was determined that we would proceed to the duel. Remember! Since we are all wizards, the fight shall be to surrender or inability to hold a wand! Now, seconds, thirds, fourths, get up here."
they'd worked out in fifth year to mimic rain, and the next crash of firework waves exploded out of existence and left the whole of Ravenclaw House soaked, as if they'd taken a real ocean wave to their table.
And— yes!— McGonagall's eyebrows rose, impressed, and Flitwick looked like his birthday had come early.
"Well, well, well," said the hat. "Acquaintances with the last one, I see. Another student I have already Sorted, though I haven't met you yet. Gryffindor last time, was it? Let me see, let me see…."
Even when they spoke of his and his parents' trial, he didn't get restless. There was a vague sort of resignation there, that what would be would be. He would plead his case, and if he was sentenced to Azkaban, then he was sentenced to Azkaban. He was lucky enough that he was one of the few even getting a hearing, and the only reason the Malfoys stood a chance of freedom was that Harry Bloody Potter had vouched for their change of sides near the end.
"Dear Head Boy," Dumbledore continued serenely as the rest of the students roared with laughter at their expense. "Perhaps you and the Head Girl would be kind enough to relight the candles? Since, of course, handling the aftermath of pranks is something that falls under your
And Harry nodded. He took a deep breath and looked down at the broom in his hands. It was an old model, older than anything he'd seen at his Hogwarts, but it looked to be brand new for this timeline. It was far newer than the usual loaner broomsticks.
Third, if that was a bust, it might give them some good blackmail material in case they really didn't get along and ended up needing it later.
A proportionally sized mammalian ear. Harry thought abruptly of Sirius changing parts of his face into Snuffles over the Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place to amuse them when Arthur had been in the hospital. He and Tonks had gotten into a competition, which Tonks had inevitably won, having a wider variety in her arsenal, but it had been one of the few fond memories of that dismal time.
"Dolohov won't be an easy arrest, Harry," said Kingsley Shacklebolt. He had moved into Fudge-Scrimgeour-Thicknesse's office for the practical purpose of being locatable, but he had yet to move any of his personal items in. He had only been elected in an emergency session the previous week, after Harry had thrown his whole-hearted, extremely coveted support behind him. Harry suspected that was part of the reason Kingsley had offered him, Ron, and Hermione Auror positions even without going through their N.E.W.T.s.
So, he had been surprised but genuinely pleased to find Harry at the pitch watching the Gryffindor tryouts. That was a good sign his drunkenness would lead to a brilliant, wild night rather than a horrible blackmail night.
James released the Snitch again, preparing to toy with it some more, but Harry couldn't take it anymore.
"No, thanks," said Harry, and he passed the scrap of parchment to Hermione. "That's Dolohov's contacts, then? The ones he has regular meetings with?"
"Dueling etiquette, in and of itself, is simple. The opponents bow to one another," he paused, and he and Flitwick bowed to each other, each bending precisely at the waist. He continued, "They assume a stance, typically with the knees bent, ready for moving in either direction, and wand held shoulder-level facing their opponent. And then they are allowed to cast whatever spells they deem prudent to incapacitate their opponent.
Draco took a deep breath and, as specifically as he was able without revealing too much of the future, explained to Dumbledore exactly what had led up to their return to the past.
Remus clearly understood it without any further explanation. He rolled his eyes and huffed another sigh. "Fine."
The lion moved on to twine around McGonagall, who was struggling not to crack a smile, and then Kettleburn, who grinned in delight and made big motion with his one arm. It was his usual hand gesture when he talked about how loud some magical creatures were and, though it looked different with only three remaining fingers, Remus must have caught it, too. James had the lion throw its head back, and Remus provided a frighteningly good roar.
Insanely, he thought of the seven Harrys escaping Privet Drive for the last time, that stupid, stupid plan that had gotten Mad-Eye killed and could have gotten all of them killed—
He probably shouldn't have worried. As usual, James and Sirius made themselves the center of attention as soon as McGonagall stopped speaking.
"It's none of your concern," had been Severus's cold response. "You made your position quite clear after your little duel with Black."
The attention hadn't suited Crabbe. He was the best at performing the Cruciatus Curse in their year, and he made sure all the terrified lower years knew it. He had taken aim at Draco more than once for trying to reign him in, but Draco had spent a whole summer and Christmas break hosting the Dark Lord at Malfoy Manor and was usually quick enough to avoid it.
Hermione had given them coins charmed like she had done in their fifth year for Dumbledore's Army meetings. Dawlins, the erstwhile Head Auror, was supposed to be watching the other coin back at the headquarters.
Draco was uncomfortably aware that he had little to no idea what Potter had been up to while Draco attended their seventh year at Hogwarts. School that year had been far from pleasant, even though the Slytherins were favored over the other Houses. It had been a shock even to their sensibilities to get a taste of what the world would be like under the Dark Lord's rule. It was a lot harsher even to purebloods, and watching his classmates from every House crumble under unmerciful, never-ending punishments had changed something in Draco.
"A couple of Tickling Charms got past you boys, huh?" came Bowie's raspy voice from above them. "Funny, I thought your Shield Charms were better than that. No problem.
Through his blurry vision, a pair of scruffy men's uniform loafers appeared, alongside the dainty, gleaming pair of a girl's shoes.
Remus breathed steadily, the only sound in the tunnel. His voice had softened, yes, but nothing about it had weakened. He was sure of himself in a way that he rarely ever was, and James took that as seriously as it deserved.
Antonin Dolohov had reminded Draco of his aunt Bellatrix, the few times they had all met. They were wrong in the head, and they took a truly perverse glee in mutilating others. But Aunt Bella had always seemed a bit frantic, while Dolohov was more easygoing. Aunt Bella, even while torturing the latest helpless Muggleborn to stumble into her lair, always wanted to be by the Dark Lord's side. She seemed to have a mental timetable always counting down, things to check off a list as quickly as possible before she could get back to groveling at
Thanks as always to my wonderful beta-reader, Stoneage_Woman! And thank you all for reading! Expect updates alternating Fridays at this point, I think. I haven't started the next chapter yet, but 2 weeks sounds reasonable... right? Lol, let me know what you think of this one! I love hearing from you!
A blinding, jagged white bolt of lightning shot out of Malfoy's wand. The explosion of sound was deafening.
On the other side of the Floo, they came face to face with a bemused Albus Dumbledore. He still had auburn peppered in his hair, and the silver was not as pale as they had known it.
. The seconds, if they are allowed contact, will meet to discuss whether there is common ground for the duelists to start a dialogue and work out the issue nonviolently. If, however, there is no contact, or the seconds determine there is no chance for a peaceful resolution, we move onto the duel itself.
when he had been killed— but he had figured out it wasn't Malfoy's doing. Malfoy had no more desire to see another rising Dark Lord than Harry did.
James had released the Snitch, probably the moment he dove onto the table after Marlene and Gertrude's owl.
As N.E.W.T. students, there were few enough of them that all four houses had the same class together.
Knockturn Alley," said Draco, after Harry had almost forgotten he was present. He was staring hard at the street sign on the corner and then along the stretch of shops around them.
The library was an odd place to be on the very first evening of term, James would admit, but he still felt a twinge of guilt over his role in Harry's… distress… during Transfiguration, so he didn't want to judge him something as horrible as 'bookish' just yet.
Breathing hard, Harry pulled a lock of his hair into sight and watched it, dazed, as it turned from jet black to straw blond.
Malfoy wasn't Dolohov. Malfoy had saved Harry once. He hadn't identified Harry in Malfoy Manor, even though he had recognized him. He hadn't turned Harry over, even though he would have been rewarded. His life would have been assured, at least for a while. Malfoy was a scared child, a coward in the face of war, not a real Death Eater. Not a sadist.
Harry made it through the doors out into the entrance hall and took the first corridor he came across. From there, he slammed his way into the first broom cupboard and shut the door behind himself.
In all his years at Hogwarts, Harry couldn't remember hearing that about Flitwick before. Why hadn't he continued the dueling club in Harry's time instead of Lockhart?
"You're looking chipper," Lily observed as she joined Harry beside the fireplace in the common room. "Good study session?"
Two of the three meandered to a stop on the sidewalk, apparently engaged in a quiet conversation, while the third went ahead to the shop door. He knocked.
He didn't know where the strength came from— he hurt in ways he had never known he could hurt— and he definitely didn't know where the power came from.
yet. He couldn't access his parents' Gringotts vault. The consequences of even finding and speaking to his parents while he had yet to be conceived….
"Boys," said Professor Bowie, appearing on the stage next to Harry and Malfoy in a fog not of steam but of cigarette smoke. "Mr. Black, it rather looks like you dropped your wand."
It was late in that second week of term that Severus dropped, exhausted, into his bed and then let out an ear-piercing screech, popping back to his feet as if his bed had been a massive spring.
"Why don't you and Mr. Potter stay here for the time being?" said Dumbledore kindly, seeing Draco's rising panic. "We have a week until classes start, and this bears discussion before you simply go out into the world and potentially alter history. Wouldn't you say?"
James wondered if he was remembering their conversation from the previous night on their walk to the hospital wing— about the world not being separated into Good People and Death Eaters. About how they needed to make sure they stayed good even as they fought evil.
" Malfoy practically shrieked right next to Harry's ear. They were leaning on each other for support. "Se-
"HA!" shouted James, holding up a round, feathery mass from the tangle of his and Sirius's limbs. "Go, Gingerweed, go! To Potter Manor!"
It stung. Draco couldn't pretend even to himself that it didn't, but he couldn't show it. Severus wasn't his godfather— not yet. He was just a clueless teenager trying to survive school in the Slytherin house. He didn't owe Draco anything.
"He's the only one who can get us back, isn't he?" Draco's voice sounded far away even to his own ears.
"—randomly shouts out your darkest secrets, threatens to kill you in the way you fear most, and then sobs hysterically until you cuddle it?" said James, stroking his chin pensively. "Yeah, mate, good choice. Quidditch can be a high-stress sport. We don't want anyone who cracks under pressure."
And Black… Black could probably just raise an eyebrow at the nearest witch and get a date on the spot. Salazar, the girls would probably be
Draco, who had been reading in his own bed, dropped his book and was on his feet, wand in hand, in an instant.
"And now," said Professor McGonagall, after the last first years had been Sorted, "we have two students recently transferred from our sister school, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in North America. They will be attending classes here for the year leading up to their N.E.W.T.s in the summer and as such need to be Sorted. First, Draco Mallory."
Sirius was proving less than ideal as his second pair of eyes, though, still pacing and demanding answers about Harry Parker's very odd character. Well, pacing as much as the confines of the Cloak would allow, anyway. He kept bumping into James, interrupting his concentration.
All scowling at Remus and Harry, the named duelists filed to the stage and stood behind their respective coach: Harry, Severus, and Malfoy behind Flitwick; Sirius, James, and Remus behind Bowie.
Dolohov grinned that manic grin. He held up a hand and, at once, the Death Eaters stopped casting spells and jeering.
"Here in this club, we will use the sporting rules, though note that some private duels may be different. For wizards, you may duel until one surrenders or one is no longer able to wield his wand. For witches, you may duel until one surrenders or first blood is drawn. Because, as we all know, witches will more readily duel to the death, unlike wizards, who will beat each other up and then go out for a drink afterwards.
Harry huffed and sputtered, red-faced. He couldn't articulate all the raging, conflicting thoughts and feelings hurtling through him at the speed of a meteor shower and just as fiery and violent.
"I know a lot of things you don't know, Ferret-face," said Harry, not looking at him. "What are you referring to in specific?"
If Dumbledore was surprised, he didn't show it. He merely clasped his hands upon his desk and looked at Draco through his half-moon spectacles, as benign as a sleeping kneazle.
"Ah, Rosier," said Bowie darkly. "Your father is head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, isn't he?"
Malfoy shuddered. "I hated you," he assured Harry. "But my stomach still sinks every time I remember you falling. Merlin, you were so high, and it was so stormy we couldn't even see what had happened until you were halfway to the ground."
Remus was perched on the edge of the tub, while Peter sat on the floor between his and James's feet.
"They sure seemed chummy in Defense when Mallory stepped in like Harry was a bloody damsel in distress," said Sirius relentlessly, "and when Harry grabbed onto him like a harlot in Transfiguration."
Laying Hermione down in the dirt felt like ripping out a piece of his own soul and leaving it behind. But he had to do it. She would understand— for Ron, she would understand. He settled her back as gently as he could, placed her fallen wand in her hand against her chest, and then left her alone in the warm, dark night.
"Bang up job he's done of that," muttered Bowie, and Rosier's face twisted. "Yes, for your information, Mr. Rosier, there
The ground at Sirius's feet exploded like a grenade, blowing Sirius into the air yet again, this time engulfed in a mushroom cloud of fire and smoke.
Harry looked up to find Snape's dark, bottomless eyes on him. Astonishingly, he didn't look judgmental or derisive, but there was an intense, piercing quality to his gaze.
"Elodie Greengrass," said the girl. She had a droning, subdued voice, but a cutting glint in her pale eyes. "And that fellow there with his nose already in a textbook is Severus Snape."
Then Sirius was on top of him, shoving his face into the table, where James's half-eaten pie smeared across his glasses.
"I was under the Cloak, going to the kitchens for a snack. He was walking by, bragging to his snaky little friends…. He was so proud of himself. Bet Mum's proud, too. Finally got the
Harry spun and found himself face-to-face with Sirius in Slytherin robes. Then he blinked, and it wasn't Sirius. His eyes were too pale, though they had that same sharp, intense look Sirius often got, and his face was a little rounder, softer and younger. He might have been about an inch or two shorter, too, but the Quidditch boots made it hard to judge.
"Uh, not really," Harry said with an awkward shrug. Sometimes conversations with Lily took on a bizarre undertone when he remembered
"Right," said Draco, and he stood aside, motioning them into the room. "I found something I thought might interest the Aurors. I didn't expect them to send you three."
Harry, Remus, and Marlene dove out of the way as the boys went careening off the table on their side.
He took a deep, shuddering breath, and then another. Empty-handed, ungrounded, he fumbled in his pockets for something to hold.
"Can't get to the coin—" Ron managed, diving under the checkout counter even as the marble countertop exploded over his head. "Can you—?
His hysterical laughter burst out, strangled, sounding not unlike a braying donkey. He clapped a hand over his mouth, but then he couldn't breathe because he was laughing too hard, and he needed his hand to prop himself up on his knees because he couldn't stand up straight….
"Oh, no, what's that on my tail?" Sirius whispered in falsetto as the snake swayed drunkenly back around on itself, curling up and eyeing the hall judgmentally. Only those nearest Sirius could hear him. "By Salazar, it's dirt! Dirt on my tail! Why would such a noble, purebred serpent as I have
There were only a handful of students in the common room, most outside to enjoy the pleasant weather before winter shortened the days and chilled the ground.
Harry gave him a deadpan look in response. Yes, they'd also had the same problem, but that didn't mean it was any less of a problem. O.W.L.s had been messy enough. He could only imagine N.E.W.T.s would be even worse.
James stared sideways at his friend. "Uh, I think you might have hit your head harder than we realized. I didn't step in."
After an uncomfortable moment in which the trio catalogued the points of ingress and egress, potential hiding spots or weapons, the door swung open.
Across the table, Lily gave a small, appreciative gasp, and James felt his heart skip a beat, but then it was
"I don't want to start a fight with them!" said Harry, exasperated. "Just like I'm not trying to start a fight with you. Look, I know Lily used to be your friend. Shouldn't you be supporting me and my— my—
"How very Slytherin of you, Mr. Potter. However… after seeing what's in your mind, I do not feel I can place you in Slytherin."
"Harry… you are dumb as a fucking rock," said Malfoy thickly. "He was trying to kill you. He would have killed you; he would have killed all of us if you hadn't found those broomsticks and gotten us out. He was my friend, but he was
Finally, the lion jumped onto the table and sauntered straight up to Lily. It sat down in front of her and stared, heavy-lidded and purring.
isn't going to save you from an attack. I don't care if you're injured or half-dead. If you can breathe, you can fight, understand?"
Remus gave Sirius a look that could have scorched paint off a wall, but this his eyes moved to meet James's, and he gave a fraction of a nod.
"Death Eaters," said Potter, as if he and Dumbledore had only spoken an hour ago instead of a year. "They attacked her at Diagon Alley. She asked for Madam Pomfrey instead of St. Mungo's."
They had been on the same side for just a moment there. Neither of them had wanted Snape tormented as Sirius had done.
Harry nodded. It wasn't his, anyway. He hadn't set up a subscription in this timeline, hoping to be gone before he needed to catch up on "current" events.
James almost shuddered, wondering exactly how secretive MACUSA had to be in order to hush that up. He was starting to wish he had paid more attention to his father's political bickering at those fancy dinner parties he had always whined about being forced to attend.
, Harry thought, startled by his own forgetfulness. They had learned to become animagi recently. Of course, they would have started out by experimenting with transfiguration spells such as this. And no wonder Remus was behind. He hadn't learned to become an animagus with them; his wolf was in his blood.
He yearned to see Severus, even for a moment. To see him alive and unburdened by his role in the war…. It was a thought Draco had never even considered, that there had ever been such a time.
Two and a half years for Regulus Black to go from this epitome of a pureblood heir, a perfect Slytherin, a talented Quidditch player, to a young man disillusioned about his entire life and prepared to die in order to change it.
He saw Ron crumple one last time under that same wand, his face still red from the force of his screaming.
in challenging Sirius to defend a friend's honor. It was… it was downright Gryffindor of him. Even Lily approved.
"I won't pretend Sirius was in the right," said Remus. "He didn't tell any of us about it before he went and did it. But you've got to understand, the way they are, if Sirius hadn't done that, Snape would have started it with a hex in the hallway or a smear rumor started about, you know, whatever he thought would embarrass James or Sirius at the moment. They're not friends. James and Snape are fighting over Lily's affection, you
— gaze snapped onto Draco. And, holy Hungarian Horntail, he had heard people say Potter had his mother's eyes, but it was just
Malfoy preened under the attention, though Harry doubted anyone else would notice. They hadn't spent seven years getting to know the prat's moods from across a crowded classroom or Great Hall like he had.
"How can you tell?" asked James. He ran his hands through his hair, though for once, it looked like a genuine reaction to stress rather than an attempt to look good for Lily.
Above them, the eagle dove into the dispersing water and landed on the table a yellow and black badger.
She immediately set them up with mirrors and had them work on human-to-animal partial transfigurations.
"Blimey," James said loudly, saving Harry from further stammering. He was looking at the Prophet with a stormy, pained expression. "The Jarlsbergers were found dead yesterday. Henry and Midge. They were friends with my parents."
Marlene nodded in acceptance, her bottom lip trembling, but she took a breath and regained control of herself. She said more crisply, "I saw you didn't like the boys' welcoming feast prank earlier. Don't worry about them, okay? Once they see you're friends with me and Lily, they won't dare bother you."
. So, whichever of us got to you first, we wanted to say you don't need to worry about a thing this year, alright? We all know how hard it is being an outsider, and we've got your back. You'll have at least one of us in all of your classes, so we can show you to the classrooms and help you catch up on anything you missed from the previous years. And we'll never leave you to fend for yourself at mealtimes, and you'll never face a Slytherin alone while we're here, and… and…."
"Parker!" Snape called as Harry turned away, going to find Remus or, hell, even Pettigrew. Harry stopped, took a deep breath, and turned to face his would-be potions professor. Snape didn't smile. He looked serious. "This balancing act you have going on between the Gryffindors and Slytherins… it's not going to last. If you want to maintain a friendship with Mallory, you won't be accepted by them. And if you become friends with them, they won't stand for your alliance with Mallory. You'll have to choose."
wasn't a good man at this point in his life. There was potential for it, his desire to protect Lily almost noble, but… he only expected Harry to give up another friend to do it for "political" reasons, and then he would save Lily and never think twice about any of the other Muggle-borns…
Malfoy didn't know Voldemort had succeeded in killing him, even if only briefly, or he wouldn't have said that. Would he?
Harry's mind scrambled, grasping for a hold on the real world, on Kingsley's voice and what those words meant.
He thought of Dumbledore falling off the Astronomy Tower, the light already gone from his eyes, after Malfoy had disarmed him.
She sounded so much like a mother, even Draco felt a pang of sadness that Harry had never known her.
Flitwick tore the pointed hat off his head and threw it forcefully at Bowie's feet. He cried, in his shrill voice, "You have insulted my dearest bosom friend, sir! I demand satisfaction!"
Nobody else needed to know he might-have-maybe-a-little-bit considered the Sorting Hat's offer... just for a second.
"First, before we get into that, let me give you an overview of dueling," said Bowie. He was standing on the stage with Flitwick, in clear view of the students. "Although dueling is now, first and foremost, a sport in which wizards demonstrate their aptitude with offensive and defensive spells alongside their performance under pressure, dueling was long before that a means to settle disputes between two wizards. As you may have noticed in the Great Hall this morning, a challenge between competitors was issued, according to the Old Ways, by throwing one's wizard's hat at another. If the challenge is accepted, the challenged wizard picks up the hat and states the first term: weapons.
Parker was staring at them, the look of disapproval melting from his expression. He looked even more mesmerized by
Lily nodded. "Will you be going? They should have sent your parents a permission slip over the summer."
his wand in the fireplace when we Floo'd. You were naked when we turned up in Knockturn Alley, and you used it right then and there against Dolohov. What are you hiding?"
Flitwick helped by casting the first spell, another Disarming spell, which Sirius flicked away like an annoying gnat. They grinned at each other.
Potter looked at Dumbledore as if the headmaster had told a joke he didn't find particularly amusing.
"That doesn't make sense!" Remus said, and James had lost count how many times he'd resorted to that argument. "You must have misunderstood—"
In the second week of term, Severus stopped casting wards on his bed and all his possessions. He had gotten comfortable enough with Draco's presence to do homework with him in the common room and had even muttered a dry but surprisingly filthy joke under his breath during their potions class earlier that day. The older Severus would never have referenced those body parts engaged in those activities within Draco's hearing before.
"Look," said Harry once he had gotten control of himself again. He still felt cold and shaken, but he continued firmly, "I'm not going to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey doesn't have anything for me. You just go back to class. I'm gonna… I'm gonna go back to the library for a bit."
fault. After the professors evacuated the other students, I'm the one who had the bright idea to circle back around. I'm the one who brought Vince and Greg along. If I had just kept my head down and followed the professors like a good little boy, Vince and Greg never would have thought of doing that. We would have been clear before the fighting started. It was
"Ah, well," said James, preening. Harry suspected he was trying to feign modesty with that shrug, but it ended up looking more like he was flexing to show off his well-muscled shoulders, which were a bit broader than Harry's.
Harry struggled. He could still taste blood in his mouth, feel his own throat tearing from his screams. He couldn't
Harry dropped to the ground and grabbed Hermione by the shoulders. He held her against him and felt frantically for a pulse.
"We're dead. We have to move on. Which direction is the afterlife? I'd hate to accidentally go back and end up a Hogwarts ghost, wouldn't you?"
It didn't have all the nicks and bumps it would gain by the time he went hunting for Horcruxes, but it was still his holly and phoenix feather wand. It was still his.
He stuffed both hands into his pockets, wrapping one around the handle of his wand, and cast another glance back at the Slytherins.
Three men— boys, really, hardly older than Harry and Malfoy— were taking turns casting spells on the sobbing, begging form of a school-aged girl. She was on the ground, curled up, holding her arms over her head as if to shield it from the magical blows. There were bright crimson lesions covering her exposed hands and wrists. Bloodied slashes like knife-strikes riddled her Muggle jumper and blouse. Even as they watched, one of the boys cast a curse that struck her in the face, and they heard the bones of her nose
," Harry growled, thinking of Cormac McLaggen for the first time in months or more. "I woke up in the hospital wing already planning his murder. Never hated a teammate more than that one. I guess you're a better Keeper than him."
This, the dueling club and Bowie, must have happened the first time around in the original timeline. He and Malfoy hadn't altered
Because Harry and Draco might leave, return to their time, before Malfoy even got to play his first match as a Keeper. And then James would be dead again. Just like all the others.
And then Harry saw the beginnings of purple fire starting from the tip of Dolohov's wand, and he reacted. His mind went clear and blank and smooth.
ideology. You don't have to be a Death Eater to support Voldemort. And if Mallory and Parker and their lot have no issue learning Dark spells… maybe they've met my mother at one of those gatherings. Maybe
he does with his hands, like a nervous tic. How he'll be talking to you one second and then… it's like he's a thousand miles away, and you'd better not startle him out of it, or you'll get a wand pointed in your face. Somebody got in his head and fucked him up. Something fucked him up
Severus flushed, and he looked away briefly before he collected himself. He said, so low Harry had to strain to hear, "I just wanted to say thank you. For that Protego Maxima. I saw that idiot's curse would have hit Evans. Expulso… it would have been terrible."
"That would indeed be an incredible power," murmured Dumbledore. "He was using no magical artifact? No spell or ancient rune?"
He came upon two bodies just outside the front door, both supporters of the Dark Lord, though they had never risen to Death Eater status to Draco's knowledge.
"You've noticed?" Harry asked, and it wasn't about his own emotional state. There was a directness, an intensity to his gaze that Draco understood immediately.
"Next, after the weapons have been established, the challenger issues the location of the duel. Then the challenged is allowed to select the time. Between them, they select their seconds, or wizards who will take over in case the primary is unable to continue the duel, and occasionally thirds and fourths and so on, depending on alliances involved.
Of course, he was the one Harry Bloody Potter would choose to obsess over next. He could never take a break from being the big bloody hero, could he?
"What were you and Regulus talking about?" Harry asked, forcing his mind back to Malfoy instead of a clearing in the Forbidden Forest filled with Death Eaters, Hagrid, and Voldemort.
There was Harry, wholly naked and bleeding from more wounds than Draco could count, hunched over the unconscious— or dead— body of Ron Weasley. Potter's eyes were bloodshot, his cheeks shiny with tears, and his whole body curled around Ron as if he could shield him with that alone. He was clutching Ron in both hands. His wand was nowhere in sight.
"That'd be a no," said Malfoy, his normally composed expression slightly wide-eyed and wild around the seams. "He's a bit slow, but he would definitely decline, thank you. Now. Don't we have a field to take over from the Gryffindors?"
"I'm not a figment of your imagination!" Draco howled, throwing his hands in the air. "Whatever else you're hallucinating,
Harry allowed himself to be ushered onto the bench next to James, hardly flinching at all at his touch, and he looked down to find a glimmering golden plate and goblet appear before him.
Severus whipped out his wand, snarling, but that was when Evans caught sight of them from the far end of the table.
Malfoy didn't hesitate. He ducked under Sirius's latest hex and shot a Blasting Curse of his own into the left side of Sirius's chest, which he had indeed left open after a grandiose movement for the Full Body Bind.
Harry only noticed it was over when the audience around him began to get up to leave. He trailed after them. His foot had barely stepped onto the grass at the bottom of the stands before Malfoy was there, cheeks flushed from the bite of the wind and brown hair swept back from his face like spun sugar. The rest of the Slytherin team made for the locker rooms, but Malfoy stopped by Harry and plucked his goggles from his face.
"He may be a Death Eater," said James softly. He looked up and caught Sirius's gaze, held it. "He may not be. That's not important. The world's not sorted into good people and Death Eaters. Some people are just bad. And you and me, mate? We can't fight Voldemort and Death Eaters if we're just going to go home and be bad people. We have to be better."
"You think this is a joke," said Malfoy. He sounded as if he had finally realized the crux of the dispute between them. His lips went thin as he, too, raised his wand. "Parker was right. You're just a kid, Black. And you need to grow up."
He had only ever cared about Severus among the Slytherins, and Severus was currently a dark-hearted, ambitious, grudge-holding
He didn't know why, in that moment of blind rage, why it was worse to image a dog willfully peeing on Severus's bed rather than a bratty teenager casting a rude spell with a wand, but it suddenly made all the difference.
Dolohov grinned, quick and sharp like unsheathing a knife. "No, no, boy," he said softly, tasting the words like fine chocolates. "I'm going to make you
Harry stormed through the hole in the wall into the main shop and cast a shield as a flurry of lights headed straight for him.
"You know, the shield," said Sirius, waving a hand with effortless elegance, as if that would help clear up James's confusion. "When Mallory shot that gods-be-damned
"Tonight is going to be a special treat," continued Bowie, who lit his cigarette with his wand tip, "because we have
The terror mounted, gripping around his throat like Pettigrew's enchanted silver hand. It was choking the life out of him.
He couldn't tell. The Cloak seemed ageless, always perfect despite being handed down through countless generations all the way back from the Peverell line.
Harry shuffled awkwardly under it and rubbed the back of his head, the picture of a chastised child.
"When I leave him alone," Sirius began heatedly, "he makes stupid decisions that get him in trouble!"
The rest of the week passed with a stony tension among the Gryffindor seventh years. A line had been drawn yet again with the Marauders on one side and Harry and the girls on the other.
Harry was the only wizard alive who ever found out what had happened to him. His family, his friends, Voldemort… they had never learned the truth.
He couldn't tell which bodies were stunned and which were dead. He recognized most as Death Eaters, but there were a couple he didn't know at all.
"You don't have to be pureblood," said Sirius. "And you'd be surprised how convincing they can be when they want. Listen… what if Parker and Mallory were Death Eaters? Probably got cold feet when he saw what Voldemort was doing to his country and tried to get out. But you don't just
"Fuckers," said Sirius, looking to Remus and Harry in betrayal. "Absolute, manipulative traitors. I can't believe you landed in Gryffindor, either of you."
When the Dark Lord had tasked Draco with killing Dumbledore, he'd known it had been little more than his own death sentence. He'd been given a year so that his parents would agonize over him, all the while knowing he was doomed.
Harry followed him up only because he couldn't force himself to let go of that sleeve yet. He needed it, or he'd fall again, back into that blackness in his mind where there was only pain and laughter and purple fire.
"What do you mean?" asked Potter. His voice was weak and hoarse, as it had been since they had woken up in the past. It sounded, Draco thought with a churning stomach, as if he had recently screamed his throat bloody.
She shot a nervous glance past him towards Rosier and Mulciber and shifted weight from foot to foot.
"Well, I do!" snapped Snape, turning red in the cheeks. "I'm not afraid to face Potter! It looks like he's afraid to face
He heard Dolohov laughing— felt the agony of Cruciatus Curse ripping through him, tearing a scream from an already bloody, aching throat—
.) No doubt, Harry would be hiding in the bushes outside the stockroom window, eavesdropping like the diligent goody-two-shoes he was. The new Minister Shacklebolt would have a whole platoon guarding the vaunted Boy Who Lived, Boy Who Won,
He swore to himself, took a deep breath, and let his head fall back against a shelf filled with mop buckets.
"If it helps," said Harry, also feigning interest in the professors' duel, "Sirius tends to favor the Blasting Curse. He's quick, but he can get distracted… playing around…."
"Yes," Malfoy said slowly, enunciating clearly as if Harry were a very stupid child, "you do. You've gone absolutely nutters,
Gertrude flashed Harry a small smile, which helped brace him against the desire to melt into the floor to get out of the conversation.
Anyone who grew up training to duel with Bellatrix Lestrange, in the ancient Black household, could not possibly be an easy foe.
In the end, Draco sat back down on his bed and stared over at Severus's empty one and the locked bathroom door, feeling more useless than he had felt since returning to the past.
you because you were doing the right thing for once! Sirius was wrong! But then you go and do something
, but they so rarely talked about their parents it was usually easy to forget. He hadn't had such a mindboggling interaction yet. "I'm a half-blood, but my mum was a Muggle-born. I grew up with her side of the family."
"Potter," said Malfoy sharply. When Harry glanced up, he motioned with his head to the mouth of the alleyway and said, "A word, if you please."
"Po—Parker is fine," said Draco shortly, finishing with his bag and standing. "If he's not at lunch, you will probably find him in the library. If you'll excuse me?"
Harry stood, holding his position and panting, until silence and relative darkness permeated the Great Hall.
It didn't matter, another voice countered, because Sirius was already dead. Nothing could hurt him anymore.
Potter Senior barked a laugh. "Getting a bit old for that, aren't you? You know, blokes our age are supposed to have a
Dread slid like ice down his spine. His shoulders slumped as the weight of what he had just said fell on them.
"You know," said Sirius thoughtfully, even as he took hold of James's shoulder to brace him, "I bet that's where Harry got that scar."
"What I mean is," said Draco, determinedly keeping his composure despite his embarrassment over the words coming out of his mouth, "Potter keeps muttering about 'moving on' and seeing his friends and family again. Maybe his magic reacted to stop Dolohov from killing McKinnon, but maybe… maybe it wanted to let him see… certain people… again."
"You and Lily?" Harry echoed, surprised. He could guess why James wouldn't want to antagonize Lily, but he'd never heard of Marlene McKinnon in relation to them.
Green light filled his vision even as something collided with him, throwing him back and ripping Ron's body out of his arms. He was aware of grabbing it on instinct, feeling warm skin under his hand, and then something wrenched in his gut, and he screamed again.
d him earlier in the duel. Here was the man who had come after them in the Tottenham Court Road café after Bill and Fluer's wedding, who would have taken them out before they even got their feet under them in the new warring world.
"That won't be necessary, Miss Evans," said Bowie, with a grin that reminded Harry of Mad-Eye Moody just before a fight. "I already know what I want to teach you lot, and it has nothing to do with exams. How many of you are Muggle-borns or half-bloods? Oh, alright, Slytherins, I know you're not going to answer. My point is… I'm going to teach you to
"I will agree to contact," said Flitwick magnanimously, "if you wish to send along your surrender— or apology."
," Black continued mercilessly. "My training partners were Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa Black— now Malfoy. And let me tell you, my family didn't get the name Black because we teach our kids so much Light magic from a young age. Get it?"
Streams of brown, gray, and green sparks shot up, covering the table in a snapping, popping image of grassy, deep dirt.
"Yes, sir," said Harry. Now that the dementor's effects were wearing off, he found himself irrationally angry at Malfoy for stepping in. "I know that."
Severus didn't look up from his book, but his jaw was clenched and the knuckles wrapped around the text were white.
"No, James is onto something," said Remus quietly, before James could come up with a defense. He was still looking at the floor with a faraway, pensive gaze. "I think Harry must have some sort of medical issue, maybe even something like— like mine. He's seen Madam Pomfrey before term even started, like I had to my first year. All last night and today, I could… I could smell healing potions on him. And did you notice how stiffly he moved whenever he had to sit down or stand up? It reminded me of last year when— when you broke a couple of my ribs, remember?"
Black had the nerve to roll his eyes as if it didn't matter. He said, "If you want contact, we'll need thirds. Our seconds won't get along long enough to pass a message. HEY MOONY, YOU'RE MY THIRD!" He shouted down the table.
Harry and Hermione kept watch from an abandoned storefront just across the street from Everest Wands' backdoor.
"I think we can both agree Sirius was in the wrong," said Remus, leaning forward and speaking more quietly, "but we don't want anything
Sirius rubbed his injured shoulder and gave James a deeply unhappy look. He couldn't hold James's gaze for long, though, and he huffed out a breath and stared at the floor.
He couldn't get the images out of his head— Sirius tormenting Snape, James preening in front of Lily, Wormtail sitting there in their midst, laughing and playing along,
"Wait! Here, at least put this on." Draco pulled his cloak off without as much flourish as he once would have and held it out to Harry, looking determinedly in the opposite direction. His hands shook.
So, James had cast the hissing spell mostly to cover up Sirius's muttered monologue in the silence as he twisted and swirled his wand under the table.
"No," said Draco. "I'll take Po-uh-Parker." To Harry, he said, "You're, ah, sure about this? I mean, I know he's…." He shot a sideways, uncomfortable glance at Black, whom he knew was Harry's godfather.
James and Remus looked at each other. Even Sirius sat up so that he could share in their consternation.
It felt empty to Harry and far away, like a half-forgotten dream. The last few Sortings he had actually attended, the hat had been outright political and dire in its speeches.
They sat in silence for a few moments. Remus decided to pull out his potions essay to get started on, even though it had just been assigned that morning.
"I think he might be friends with that Mallory," James admitted reluctantly, "but that doesn't mean he's going to run to McGonagall on us all year. As long as we leave Mallory out of the worst of it…."
Fighting the deep, consuming tidal wave of grief and rage, Harry forced himself to pay attention to the duel in front of him.
Sirius slung an arm around Gertrude and said, "That's why you ladies need a full gentlemanly escort to the village. The Marauders would like to offer our humble services for the weekend."
"Alright," he said heavily. "I get it. Just… just don't do it again, alright? I haven't gone around attacking Snape. I'd appreciate the same courtesy, if you don't mind. Even though they're
Regulus cast Malfoy an unreadable look before he nodded and glanced up at the still-playing Gryffindors.
"I wonder where your true loyalties lie," murmured Regulus. Then he looked at James and said, much louder, "
"Ohh, what a lovely bonnet," Sirius whispered as the snake stared down one second year girl. "I just remembered I'm a girl snake, and I need a bonnet to cover up
"Because the timing would be lost, Evans," said Sirius, but he seemed to realize Harry was too well-defended to continue. He gave Harry's shoulders a parting shake, too rough to be entirely friendly, and let go. "Jokes are all about timing."

He stared into the face of the man he had been sentenced to kill scarcely two years ago, and the bottom of his stomach dropped out.
It was so easy to get lost in the everyday hustle and bustle of classes, of research, of the drama of teenagers.
The thought was tantalizing, even if Dumbledore had expressly forbidden him and Malfoy from changing any major events they knew of in the past.

Ravenclaw lost its mind, standing and cheering, while the other Houses and teachers clapped and laughed good-naturedly.

. There was no wasted movement. It was clear he had a plan, a mental map, and years of experience. He tossed the Quaffle, caught the Quaffle, and threw it for a goal all with the same fluidity, never slowing or hesitating even as he accounted for his teammates' flight patterns.
Harry managed to disarm Rabastan and stun him. He dug furiously in his robes for the hidden inside pocket where he'd stowed the coin.
James hammed it up a bit, keeping the tension going as the lion apparently lazily went around stretching to show off his sleek, muscular body, and jutting his fuzzy, flickering head into people's chairs in demands for praise.
"Ah," said Harry, with a nod. "Well, in that case…. If it were just Mallory and Black, maybe. They, uh, have a little common ground. But not if Snape's involved. Mallory and Snape… they're thick as thieves."
"Thanks," repeated Harry, giving Malfoy a discrete shove. "Could you give us a minute? We haven't gotten any practice in yet…."
The last time Harry had seen it, the spell holding the floating candles had been destroyed in the battle, and Flitwick had still been too injured to recast it. The four tables had been vanished to make room for all the bodies.
"That must be some letter," said Lily, watching the scuffle with her hand inching almost subconsciously toward her wand like she was about to break them up at any moment. She had porridge and bits of egg in her hair, though she had brushed off most of the crumbs from the toast that had hit her square in the nose. "We've mentioned both Hogsmeade
Sometimes being in the past still felt like a dream, like he would wake up and find that it had all taken place in his head over a single restless night. Like he would wake up to Hermione or Ron shaking him awake to take his turn watching outside the tent.
Sirius huffed out a deep breath and turned away. He ran a hand through his dark hair. After an unbearable silence, he said quietly, "Regulus took the Mark over the summer."
and the life he could have had. It wasn't just Harry's loss. The wizarding world, Sirius and Remus's generation especially, had lost something truly remarkable with the death of James Potter.
"Bloody hell," said Black, looking between Draco and Harry in disbelief. "What have you two been up to, then?"
The floor dropped out from under James's feet. He swayed, dizzy, like someone had hit him with a Confundus.
"There was this power coming from him I'd never felt before," Draco finished. "And, somehow, with those words, I think it reacted to what he said."
"First years, line up, please," said McGonagall. "Seventh years, at the back of the line. And in we go; follow me."
Sirius's expression was almost funny. He didn't seem to know whether to be shocked, offended, angry, or confused. "You have no idea what I—"
"Regulus," said Harry, thinking of his bedroom door at Grimmauld Place, of a fake Horcrux and a note signed R.A.B. Of Kreacher's profound loyalty and grief.
time now that magic in the corridors between classes is forbidden, as are a number of things he will let you know as he sees them.
Worse, what if he tried something and reverted back to his black hair, sitting just a couple of seats away from his lookalike father?
Harry rubbed a weary hand over his face as he gave the Fat Lady the password and let himself into the common room.
They sat down to curious stares from their housemates, who were no doubt wondering what had taken them so long at the Gryffindor table, before some even less tactful morons saw that it was Snape and then pointed and laughed.
Breakfast was hit or miss. They were usually too busy for lunch. They only had dinner when they weren't so exhausted they fell straight asleep after a hard day of work.
," Draco sneered, lip curling at the mere idea of being in a street starkers with Potter, "and why… ah… certain people weren't there to greet him, I suppose. Kept muttering about King's Cross Station. I don't know. He hasn't been making sense."
The snake slithered onto the Slytherin table, and it would have been eerie, chilling even, had James not been able to hear Sirius's ridiculous commentary. The realism of the flame-snake, the powerful, graceful way it moved, the way its tongue flicked and it raised its body to stare at each student dead in the eye.
Remus resumed pacing. His poor shoes, already worn low in the heel, wouldn't last the school year at this rate.
She had it anyway. Rosier and Mulciber were watching her closely and whispering to each other with rather lewd-looking smirks.
Message received down the line, Sirius looked pointedly at the boy sitting between them, Harry Parker, and then tilted his head at James, a question made to look like he was smoothing his fine, wavy hair in front of the ladies who were staring at him.
"I agree," said Remus. "He seems… out of place, but I have hopes for him. I think he's maybe just missing home."
Dolohov was standing with his wand pointed directly at Harry's face. Instead of his usual sadistic amusement, he looked furious.
Slytherins at Ilvermorny," came Lily's voice coming up on Marlene's other side. It was chilly. "Next time you want to make fun of someone's choice of friends, why don't you think first?"
But, more than that, he hated the idea of going back to a Hogwarts where Dumbledore had fallen to his death from a beautiful, remote tower, where Snape had bled out in a dusty shack, where Remus and Tonks and Fred and
Sirius and Remus had always told Harry he flew like his father. Now he had seen it for himself, perhaps for the only time he ever would.
," snarled Malfoy, grabbing the back of Harry's robes and physically shoving him back against the wooden stands.
A sound of scuffling caught Harry's attention, too, and he and Malfoy shared a look of confusion before Malfoy realized he was, again, staring at a naked Harry Potter. He spun back around and fiddled with the clasp of his travelling cloak.
"Oh, Merlin," groaned Malfoy, sitting up. He dragged Harry upright, too, the presumptuous git. "Oh, I am never going to laugh like that again, so long as I live."
He understood, unfortunately. He wanted to be angry; anger was familiar, safe. But he knew intimately how one just reacted when a wand was pointed in one's face, how
Indeed, Sirius's wand was lying useless on the ground next to him, doubtless slipped through his numb fingers before or after the lightning strike.
"It isn't your fault," Malfoy said magnanimously. "Many stronger wizards than you have lost their minds after being— ah—
"Do you have information on Antonin Dolohov or not?" asked Hermione, pushing forward with that hard look in her eyes.
Severus had shouted Potter's name so many times during their years at Hogwarts, it took Draco a moment to remember this Potter was Potter Senior,
"So you're the buggered class," said Professor Bowie, not bothering to stand up from behind his desk or put out his cigarette. Even the door into the corridor was left open. "First class to have a different Defense professor every year, I hear, and you'll be trying to scrape together a passing N.E.W.T. at the end of this."
James grinned even brighter. "Thanks! We— me and Sirius, that is— put a lot of time into human-animal transfiguration last year."
Harry almost felt bad. He still didn't know why Draco Malfoy of all people had been transported along with him— if anything, he had been holding onto
Sirius called a Marauders meeting in the bathroom of their dorm, since Harry Parker could walk into the dorm at any moment.
Sirius looked like he wanted to fly apart, that restless energy barely contained beneath his skin, but he clenched his fists and continued, "It's no secret my family is as Dark as they come. And they've always held social functions for the other
"I don't think we're dead," said Malfoy. "I think… I think we've somehow traveled back in time. We're in the past. That's why Dolohov and the others are so young. That's why Gimmick Alley is so different. The shops we know haven't been built yet, or they're owned by different people. It's the only logical explanation."
"Isn't he the Seeker, though?" asked Harry, thinking back to the photograph he had found in Sirius's room at Grimmauld Place. Regulus, he was positive, had been sitting in the Seeker's usual position within the team formation.
Harry struggled to sit up despite his injuries, keeping his lips tightly pressed against more whimpers of pain. That accomplished, he wrapped his arms around himself, uncomfortably vulnerable next to a fully clothed Draco Malfoy. He looked around.
"I didn't—" he began weakly, the trembling migrating into his voice. He stopped, closed his eyes, and said, helpless against his own devastation, "You were supposed to be…
Draco grimaced. But Salazar, Bowie did look a bit like that idiot Lockheart, didn't he? He could only hope their similarities ended at the blond hair and jewelry.
a gentlemanly escort," said Marlene sweetly, leaning forward to leer at Sirius even as she wrapped her own arm around Harry. "Harry's already saved my sister's life once. We'll take
"It's alright," said Hermione. She watched him, worrying her bottom lip, and Harry saw the struggle behind her eyes. Eventually, she sighed and said, "You can't keep going like this, Harry. Don't you think you should take a break before joining the MLE? Take some time for yourself?"
Kingsley and Harry paced around the single desk like it was a dance, moving in one direction together before one of them changed directions and got close, only for the other to change direction, too, and keep the endless circle going the opposite way.
"Yes," Regulus said, after a measured pause. He was still looking at Harry as if Harry were a puzzle he meant to solve. "I did mean to congratulate you, Parker. It was impressive the way you analyzed Sirius's fighting style and saw his weaknesses so quickly. A man with your skills would go far… in life."
"This school year alone," said Remus appreciatively. He continued their previous conversation as if nothing had interrupted, "Hogsmeade is well worth a visit, if you think you can skip one weekend at the library, of course. There's this wonderful little bookshop, even, if you'd like to look at some additional resources. And we usually have lunch at the local bar, the Three Broomsticks. They make an
," said Harry, throwing out his hands in frustration. "Back home, he would have enjoyed seeing me struggle! And even if he wasn't enjoying it, he's always been a cowardly little—" rat, but Remus might not take that well, given Peter's animagus form, "—ferret. I didn't think he could 'play the hero' even if he tried."
Malfoy stared at him, pale, with his lips slightly parted. Finally, he shook his head and muttered disbelievingly, "
There were three wizards in hooded cloaks making their way furtively toward the backdoor of Everest Wands.
"Can't your brother have a conversation without you sticking your nose in it?" Harry snapped, his pleasure in James's companionship disappearing like a candle being snuffed. "It's no wonder you two can't get along if you never leave him alone. He's his own person, you know, and he's allowed to talk to who he wants
He didn't know the girl, could barely see her face between all the blood and her shielding arms, but she seemed to be a Muggle or Muggleborn by the way she dressed.
Rather than trying to be subtle with Peter, Remus tapped Wormtail on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear.
"Fine, keep your secrets," said Malfoy peevishly. "But just know it's not only you who's stuck here. I want to go home, too, you know."
Potter had a break after Transfiguration, but Draco had to leave for Alchemy. Draco had been thrilled to enroll when he'd first seen it. There had never been enough interest among the other students in all four of his last years at Hogwarts, but these students in the past had better taste than his peers, it seemed. Now, his excitement was subdued in the face of Potter's breakdown.
"Uh, practicing the Shield Charm?" said Harry. "Do you want to try to jinx me, or should I jinx you?"
"Er," said James, looking down at his fish-tail hands and then at his wand on the desktop. "How do you reckon I hold my wand to reverse this?"
"And he could cast a Patronus at thirteen?" Remus muttered, definitely to himself. "Unbelievable. And I
Harry's feet moved before his mind caught up. He found himself between Malfoy and Sirius, wand raised and crying
"I like him," said James, purely to forestall whatever Sirius had prepared against Parker. "The girls have adopted him like a puppy, and you know they're canny. They'd be the first to turn on him if he were a bad sort."
He had expected to die jumping in front of that curse. He hadn't planned it, of course, but the outcome had registered even as he had moved to do it.
was easy?" asked Harry. It sounded different than it would have before the war. There was no teenage angst and bravado. It was dry, grim.
, Harry recalled suddenly, and he couldn't help glancing at Remus as grief rose up within him. Dolohov had escaped before Kingsley had rallied the Ministry and started making arrests, but Flitwick had incapacitated him, at least.
It would be an early death sentence to any potential friendship with them if they thought he had already befriended the Slytherins, though. Sirius was not the kind of person to let that go, especially as a teenager.
He looked less like Harry than Harry remembered, the longer he looked, but the similarities were still enough to be distracting.
White, silver, and gold streaks seared into the air to join the stars in the enchanted ceiling. There was a flash like sunlight, and then the hundreds of burning projectiles fluttered softly back to the ground, their shapes changed into that of delicate, glowing white lilies.
Harry found himself on his feet, gasping for breath, his wand pointed at James's chest. James's wand clattered to the floor at Harry's feet, the result of an
Sirius, grinning, flicked his wand to release the Charms professor. Panting, Flitwick stood. They bowed to one another, and Flitwick moved offstage to supervise with Bowie.
"As a date? I don't think that's any of your business, Potter," said Lily, tossing her hair back loftily. "Is it, Harry?"
Draco… could reluctantly admit he'd been more of an immature brat with his forays into practical jokes in the past. The Marauders made it into an art. Their skill with magic, even for seventh years, was impressive. Their confidence and camaraderie made it hard not to envy them.
She seemed determined to offer more, to offer everything he could possibly need, but Harry cut her off gently.
But Severus continued pouring over his book, a Transfiguration text, and didn't even glance up at the attention.
"Regulus's," said Malfoy, throwing a leg over his own broom with a mischievous grin. "Nicked it when he went off to shout at Jones-Kieffer. I'm sure the whole castle will hear when he finds out."
He was saved from further awkwardness by the arrival of a small brown owl, which landed in front of Marlene and Gertrude as if it had been waiting for them. It stuck out its leg with a letter attached.
"Professor Bowie would like me to announce the revival of our school's dueling club, with mandatory attendance at least once a week for fifth years and higher."
The tiny group, plus two freshly turned eighteen-year-olds, followed McGonagall into the Great Hall.
Except Dumbledore had been consumed by the Deathly Hallows in the end, almost as much as Voldemort and Grindelwald had been. The only reason the Elder Wand could have come to Harry in Knockturn Alley was if it remembered its allegiance to him in the future. And he didn't know what Dumbledore would do with that knowledge— knowledge that Harry had accidentally accumulated all three Hallows at some point in the past year, and the Elder Wand was truly his.
It made him… softer. Something about his pointy face just smoothed out with a frame of darker, loose hair highlighted by gentle waves. It made Harry focus on his eyes, he realized.
Hermione screaming above them, sobbing, her blood spilling onto the hardwood floors just a few dozen feet away.
"I'm Lily Evans, Gryffindor seventh year, Head Girl," said Lily. "That overdramatic baboon there is James Potter, Head Boy. I'm afraid you'll be sharing a dorm with him and the boys." She grinned, sharp and fast, a fierce, witty light like a fire in her eyes. "Welcome to Hogwarts, Harry."
James capitulated, allowing Sirius to guide them closer to the pitch, where Mallory and Parker were just meeting.
McGonagall made the usual show announcing the first years, and the Sorting Hat burst into a rather slapdash song about House traits and its role in sorting them.
James had never gotten the full story about what had happened, only that he and his mother had gotten into an argument— nothing unusual there— but it had escalated until she had reached for her wand. When the usual Stinging Hexes and other minor curses failed to shut him up, it had gotten… bad.
They made it to the first moving staircase that would lead them up to the infirmary, and James prodded him up the steps with quiet encouragement.
Draco shivered. He glanced out his window at the clear summer night and drew his robes tighter around himself. He didn't know why he suddenly felt cold all over if it wasn't the weather.
Thoughts aswirl, Harry arduously made his way back to his feet. His ribs were broken. He was cut, burnt, and bruised. Why hadn't his injuries faded in death?
His Patronus wasn't corporeal, but it was bright and swift. It raced between the desks to launch itself between Rosier and the illusory dementor like a misty, silvery shield.
James supported him from the Great Hall with an arm around his shoulders, though Sirius could walk just fine.
. Be sure you have it down nonverbally before the test, though. McGonagall only gives half-credit for verbal spells at the N.E.W.T. level."
"Vince is the one who tried to kill us," said Malfoy firmly, and Harry glanced up to see him looking hard at Harry, like he could tattoo his words onto Harry's brain if he tried hard enough. "You are the one who saved us. And if you couldn't save Vince, too… well, that's war, isn't it?"
"Sorry, fine, alright," muttered Harry, running a hand through his hair. The steam had condensed into droplets of water on him, and he was now soggy and cold. He took off his glasses and did his best to mop off the water with his damp robes.
Hermione and Harry caught each other's glances while Ron only looked mournfully up at the ceiling. Eating regular meals, it turned out, was a habit, and one that they had lost during their year on the run. The past few weeks doing the understaffed, overworked Aurors' work hadn't helped matters.
Severus's cheeks colored even as he scowled his most dire scowl, and he flew past their beds toward the bathroom. He slammed the door shut behind himself hard enough to rattle stone, and there was the distinct click of a lock.
Draco glanced away, frowning, and crossed his arms. He didn't know if he was annoyed at McKinnon or himself for that last thought.
The fire-badger went to town digging, and here Sirius cast a spell he had created to directly combat his mother's constant
'd the first Death Eater standing watch before he could even look up at the sudden commotion. Then he and the second Death Eater were dueling with a vengeance.
He had wished for Ron and Hermione to be by his side in this timeline almost constantly, but now he felt truly adrift without them. This was… this was what they
Hermione sighed softly. She peeked again around the corner of her window and catalogued the miniscule changes. No sign of Dolohov.
"I think that's enough for me," said Malfoy, finishing his stretch. "Slytherin tryouts are in a few minutes."
She reminded Harry not of Bellatrix, but of Andromeda. They were similar, but so very, very different. He suddenly wished Sirius had told him about her, this girl who had been such a nuisance to Voldemort that he'd had her entire family annihilated.
He remembered escaping from Malfoy Manor, that horrible night. Bellatrix had already summoned Voldemort, convinced of Harry's identity and defeat. When they had escaped, and she had killed Dobby…
"It's because I'm a Muggleborn," she finally continued, with a proud, stubborn tilt to her chin that reminded Harry achingly of Hermione. "I know who they were. They were You-Know-Who's supporters. Death Eaters. I just never thought… in Diagon Alley…."
"Whoa, what's your issue, Parker?" said Black, frowning and leaning away from the wand tip. "It was a joke!"
He wasn't stupid enough to think Dumbledore had bought it, of course, but at least he hadn't pushed for the truth. Dumbledore was oddly wary of altering the future, considering he was the one who had suggested Harry and Hermione use a time-turner to save Sirius and Buckbeak in their third year.
"This is a mistake," said Harry, turning toward the doors for the hundredth time that evening. "I already told Hermione I didn't want to return for my N.E.W.T.s. Time would be better spent—"
"Write to your dad," suggested Sirius. "He deserves to know, if he hasn't figured it out for himself already. And he's got contacts in the outreach program from being friends with Midge so long, right?"
"I, uh… just have a bad feeling, is all," said Harry. "Something's going on, and… ah… well, trouble has a knack of finding me."
Harry shifted, excuses to leave rushing to the forefront of his mind, but he opened his mouth only to have Malfoy shove a broomstick into his hand.
"Oi," said James, whacking the Prophet onto the table to better give Remus a look of hurt and betrayal. "You're not going to come watch the Gryffindor tryouts?
"Uh— never mind," said Harry. He lowered his wand, struggling not to look as stupid as he felt. "Anyway. You wanted a word?"
Defeating Voldemort still didn't feel real most of the time, even when he had been back in his proper timeline. After spending the past seven years agonizing over it, sacrificing for it, fighting tooth and nail with everything he had, with everything at stake…. It was surreal to think it was just… done. After a single night.
building and building inside his chest. It was too much— there was no more room for it— he couldn't keep pushing it down— he couldn't keep
After a few minutes, when his breath evened out and he could see through the blinding headache, Malfoy said, "I know what will make you feel more like yourself. Let's practice Wronski Feints. Whoever gets closest to the ground—
There was no mistaking that long, pale face, so often twisted in rage or contempt. Here was the man who had cursed Hermione in their fifth year in the battle at the Department of Mysteries, who would have killed her if she had not
"Ah," said Remus, looking down at his potions essay as if it held all the answers. "You were, ah… bullied? At your old school?"
"Vincent," said Harry. "And he— you don't understand, Draco. I still have nightmares— the shapes coming out of the fire— and I'm not fast enough, my reflexes aren't good enough, and one of the monsters leaps out of the flames and
Harry didn't care. He was panting, his anger suddenly white-hot, and looking at Malfoy like he'd never seen him before.
"Just think about it!" Sirius snapped, finally looking up to glare at Remus. He squared his shoulders and leaned forward in the claustrophobic tunnel as if to get in Remus's face. "Parker and Mallory keep talking about how they hate each other, and Mallory said he and his friends snuck back into their school, probably to find Parker for Voldemort. They were all Death Eaters, and Mallory went after Parker himself for betraying them! That's why they don't get along. And then Parker saw he wasn't safe after that attack and ran to the one place everyone says Voldemort is afraid to enter.
Draco knew Severus's childhood hadn't been a happy one, though he had never bothered to ask for details. It soon became clear, however, that it took time for him to open himself back up to Hogwarts after spending time at home. It took the first week for the Hogwarts food to put a little color back in his cheeks, then the second week for him to stop looking so emaciated. It took days before he spoke to anyone, and then a full week before he spoke in more than monosyllables.
"What if their families were enemies of Voldemort from the very beginning? They ran when he first publicly opposed the Ministry… Voldemort found them in America… and so they ran back here to Dumbledore. For all we know, Voldemort is hunting Harry, and maybe Mallory, for something their parents did, or something their parents know."
"I brought you a broom," said Malfoy. "The pitch is free now that Slytherin tryouts are over. Let's go for a fly."
Draco stared, flushed beet red to the roots of his platinum hair, and whirled around to face the opposite direction.
"You don't understand," Malfoy said eventually, barely moving his lips to speak. "The Blacks… my mother was a Black…. He's well-trained. The curses he probably knows…. It won't be like our little duel in second year."
Harry jolted, but luckily, James stood up and headed to the front of the room before anyone noticed.
He got to the pitch just in time to see the end of Gryffindor's first new-team scrimmage. He could pick out James effortlessly, and the sight made him pause, breath catching.
"Yeah…" muttered James, taking his turn to look at the floor while Sirius glared at him, daring him to argue.
The snake lifted its head and flitted its tongue to taste the air. Its head wound to face Slytherin table.
Bowie was silent for a moment, considering his useless spell. Then he just said, "You Ilvermorny boys are fuckin'
"Rosier and Wilkes," he repeated pensively, pretending to mull it over. Then, "No, I'm afraid it would never have worked out between us. Draco Mallory, at your service. And you are?"
It had been hard sitting at the welcoming feast as a stranger among the Marauders. It had been uncomfortable going to breakfast and making small talk with Remus and Mary while James and Sirius bickered with Lily and Marlene. It had been surreal sitting in a classroom with them as an equal, a regular student among regular students.
Either way, he supposed his next step was to figure out how to move on so he could see his friends and family in the afterlife. He had done his job in life. He no longer had obligations tying him to the living, so there was no conflict in his mind about going back.
His vision was tunneling. He was suffocating under the panic, under the pain. But Dolohov wouldn't let him pass out, that was too much a kindness for him.
The pleasure turned to unthinking, animalistic terror at the sight of a wand pointed in his face. For that second, Harry could only see Dolohov's wand, hear the jeers of the Death Eaters, screaming,
"Mr. Black, do please get your hands out of Mr. Potter's trousers," said Dumbledore tranquilly, cutting through the excited buzz of voices in the darkness.
.' Once you feel you've got a grasp on it, have your partner try to jinx you. No more duels to the death tonight, please; I've only got so much whiskey left in this flask. Now, we've got about thirty minutes left, so chop chop! Off you go! Ah— Mr. Mallory, a word first, if you please."
"Correct. Fire is the only defense against Inferi, as no spell has been found to prevent dead flesh from burning. Five more points to Gryffindor. I'd have given
Harry stared down at her surprised face. Wildly, his mind flew back to their second year when she'd been petrified.
They looked to Dolohov, who was staring at Harry as if someone had just walked over his grave and didn't respond to their urgent whispers if he knew him.
the first time. Now, it seemed to debate with him, and Draco muttered under his breath just as Harry had done his first time through. In the end, though, the hat called out again, "SLYTHERIN!"
"Fourth year was canceled because of the Tournament," Harry continued, feeling vindictive satisfaction in leaving Malfoy hanging when he was clearly hankering for an argument. "Fifth year…. What happened fifth year?"
have done it!" she said. "We— the seventh year girls— we're an odd generation. Me, Trudy, Lily, Mary… we're all Muggle-born, you see. And we've always had to look out for each other because nobody else will. And we— we weren't there for her last week! She didn't have anybody else; she could have
"That's not— I can't—" Harry struggled to find the words, struggled to contain his irrational panic, but then gave up. He made to push past Malfoy toward the school, gasping for breath.
"POTTER!" he bellowed so loudly and so suddenly, Harry almost jumped out of his skin. "GET YOUR RUBBISH TEAM OFF MY PITCH BEFORE WE START USING YOU FOR TARGET PRACTICE!"
Sirius glanced at him for a split second, that confused, helpless expression back before he closed himself off again. He stared at the entrance of the tunnel and said, almost dull, "What if that's how he knows my mother? My
Harry frowned at the undoubtedly intentional pause in there. It was clear he meant to imply something else, something specific, but seemed to be feeling Harry out before he confided his true thoughts.
"He's a bit delicious, isn't he, your Ilvermorny friend?" asked Marlene, sliding neatly up to Harry at the end of class. She was throwing a heavy-lidded look over her shoulder at Malfoy. "I don't usually go for Slytherins, but that was just sweet how he stood up for you."
First of all, maybe they could get utterly sloshed and have a great time together. Maybe it'd break down Harry's ridiculously high guard and help them become friendlier. One could never have too many friends.
If losses were choices, he would far rather have given up his Firebolt than his parents, than Sirius or Remus or even Dumbledore. Moody. Fred. Snape.
Lily crouched down, her brilliant green eyes only inches from Harry's own. "Harry?" she asked. "Is it a Tickling Charm? Those can get pretty ugly. Here.
He would have clawed his way out of his own skin in that moment, if it would get him away from that horrible, devouring
"Fine," spat Sirius. He picked up the hat and held it up like a flag. "Granted. I accept your challenge, Mallory. Wands. Midnight. The Forbidden Forest behind Greenhouse Six. James is my second."
Peter nodded into his dessert plate, covering his mouth with a hand as if politely to keep people from seeing him chew.
"Mal— uh, Mallory and I weren't friends," he found himself saying, almost pleading. "Back at our school, I mean. We actually spent the last six years hating each other. His family and friends, and mine…. We had very different views on the world, you know?"
"Magic… though mysterious and powerful… is as a force of nature," he said. "It is bound by laws of action and reaction, cause and effect. It must make sense, even if we do not see all the pieces that led up to a particular outcome at the time. People, on the other hand…. People, I have found, are just as mysterious and powerful. But they are not bound by the same rationality."
"I don't know, Padfoot," sighed James, rubbing the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses for the millionth time, too.
"I don't like fighting, Potter," said Malfoy at length, as if it cost him a great deal to admit. He didn't meet Harry's eyes. "Neither did my mother, actually. But, as I said, she did teach me to win. And when Black was casting those curses at me, all I could think about was Aunt Bella, and my mother watching in a panic, and I just knew I had to win at whatever the cost… and so I cast that spell. That's all. That's what happened."
With Kettleburn's full-bellied laugh, the lion made his way off the teacher's platform and toward the Gryffindor table.
A grim-looking man with a messy blond bun on his head and an overabundance of jewelry raised a whiskey flask and lit cigarette in greeting.
The Slytherin Ilvermorny boy, James noticed, had conjured an umbrella and was watching the commotion with the dry interest of a scholar, untouched.
"It's a shop for sex toys, Granger," said Draco, pinching the bridge of his nose. "A rather popular one."
Whatever that emotion was, he couldn't afford it. He couldn't let it take him over, not when Dolohov had killed Remus and gotten away. Not when Molly Weasley had had to kill Bellatrix, who had killed Sirius and Tonks and would have killed Ginny, because Harry had been so
The badger was a little disproportionate, its left side a little chubbier than its right, its ears a bit too big and tail oddly curly and off-colored, but it wasn't bad considering Wormtail hadn't scraped together a good enough O.W.L. score in transfiguration to continue to N.E.W.T. level.
The destruction was horrific. Bodies lay strewn about the floor amidst broken shelves, exploded walls, and disintegrated merchandise. It smelled of burnt flesh and blood.
"Oh," said Harry. He watched the blush creep higher up Snape's cheeks, reconsidered what he knew of Snape's history, and felt instantly mortified. "
Peter broke into a face-splitting grin and only tried to take it back a notch when Remus muttered something else in his ear, wearing a look of mild chastisement.
The table on the far left roared its approval, and Harry pulled off the hat reluctantly. He nodded to McGonagall as he stood, and she gave him a suspicious but polite nod back.
Until Harry figured it out for himself, they were stuck, and he should be doing something more useful with their rare opportunity than going to school and working on homework and worrying about upcoming N.E.W.T.s.
