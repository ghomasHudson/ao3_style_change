It’s bad enough that he has a three day waiting period before he can get into his vault, if Narcissa does well, which she will, but he also is in
Wait, what? Harry’s cheeks are slightly flushed, eyes wide behind his glasses, and the worst part is either the water collecting in those green orbs or the shaking of his hands as he explains.
Blaise reaches out to place a hand on his shoulder, warm against his back and very comforting. “If you can’t sleep, stay here with us. We can crack open the new series my dad got me, get out the snacks, make a night of it. Just please,” his sad smile rivals Dumbledore’s knowing looks, “Stay, here, with us. Where it’s safe.”
?” Lucius snarls the second they enter the torture chambers in the dungeon. He doesn’t have much time to respond before he’s hexing Draco into the wall, poking the end of his wand right into Draco’s still open arm wound. “You think a
Draco frowns, “Let me guess. Eating, sleeping, lying to his friends, sneaking around, nightmares, and then his inevitability to stay out of trouble.”
They’re in some sort of forest, trees filling the entire landscape with only a lake and a house to break them. From where they are the house seems like a cottage, something about it gives him joy. That house means something, but he can’t figure out what.
magic evolved from the elements. Water being one of the four eldest, she was once known as Am'ma Veḷḷaṁ, but as Earth began to take over, and magical creatures began to rise, she was forced to split into different bodies. The first, what we know as rivers and lakes, is known as Ertt Vāṭṭar. The second, while most commonly known as Mother Ocean, is called Yathārt'tha Veḷḷaṁ. Okay? You with me?”
On the third and final day, Pansy broke down. Crying and screaming, demanding he come out from wherever the hell he was. To Draco’s surprise, Ginevra Weasley and Hermione Granger were the ones to comfort Pansy.
Draco rolls his eyes at her antics, but she brought him her special calming tea, made with lavender from her own garden, so he lets the comment slide.
June watches eagerly from her side, mouth half stuffed with a bagel. Draco doesn’t know what’s worse, her abhorrent table manners or Howie’s look of betrayal to his left.
He stands right in front of Draco, hands reaching out and then pausing. As though he’s afraid Draco might vanish if he touches him.
The door to their compartment opens and closes by itself. Draco only rolls his eyes before the air moves and three more idiots are standing there.
“No,” Lucius shakes his head. “It’s best that you both come with me. The kids are tired, it’s best that they head to bed.” He turns with a strangely kind look on his face. Well, as kind as Lucius Malfoy can look. “It’s been a rough night, things will be better in the morning.”
A single look at Potter’s grinning face and he decides he’s snag the sample after all. Pity if it found its way onto someone’s lightning scar.
Potter gives him a very nervous grin that makes him very anxious, “Like I said...you’ve missed a lot.”
Here, with his team smirking at him and thanking him for the brooms, he feels welcome. None of them know, or even care, about the Dark Lord. As they walk to the pitch he can feel the troubles melt away, talking about plays, exchanging gloats and other meaningless ticks that only Slytherins would get. It’s somewhat comforting, to be around his people, ones with brains, ones who don’t care about his name because he’s the youngest and most inexperienced of them all. A level of respect is there, sure, but not in the way Crabbe and Goyle mindlessly agree to everything, Flint actually snorts at one of his remarks. Being treated like a human being for once feels amazing, and it ends the second Oliver Wood comes flying towards them.
He’s too shocked at the change in tactics to say ‘no’, so he ends up sneaking past the ghost that everyone avoids. Draco doesn’t get it, she’s really quite easy to handle, all you have to do is give her a smile and treat her like she isn’t worthless. Granted it was a shot in the dark, but he remembers Pansy talking about how lonely Myrtle is, and well. It doesn’t take much to put two and two together.
When he was younger, all of Harry’s Christmases were spent in his cupboard, listening to the Dursleys pittle about on the joyous day.
He’s not sure who grabs him and shoves him into the empty classroom on his way to dinner, but one moment he and Blaise are talking about dessert options and the next he’s in a room with two angry women, and angry Harry, and an annoyed Weasley. He can
The headmaster does something he hasn’t done in a very, very long time. He looks away, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes, almost like he also doesn’t understand...or maybe…
“Understand this, Potter. My father was once everything to me. He was kind and gentle and taught me everything I know. The man you’re about to see is a stranger.”
Malfoy gives him a wry smile, “Nothing we both haven’t dealt with before. I’ll be alright. I would invite you to check on me freely, but I can’t risk your safety for that.”
The distance between them couldn’t give him time to prepare even if he could see into the future. One second Lucius is 30 chairs away from him, and the next Draco is being held by his throat against the wall.
They turn their attention back to the moving words still acting out the book they’re a part of. Much later, once Crabbe and Goyle have returned, and they’ve passed into the fourth volume, Draco mumbled a ‘thank you’. His friends are too asleep to hear him.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow, but then the elf is holding out a sock and a smile is breaking across Malfoy’s face. It’s weird to see him so happy, but the fact that it’s over a freed elf is even stranger.
“Fine!” He huffs, throwing his hands in the air, “I saw Harry Potter’s head in Hogsmeade and I think it’s because I’m going insane!”
Oh shit. Harry closes his eyes and makes Draco do the same, their wands stay up, Draco doesn’t say a word.
Remus freezes, looking over to Narcissa who still has that warm smile, only with a blush over her cheeks. Sirius clears his throat, “Hello to you too,
They arrange a time for their extra classes, Snape gives him the rest of the calming potion with clear instructions to take a tablespoon once a day, preferably in the morning, and even walks him to the door.
2) the they/them character i've been going on about i imagine to look like Nyakim Gatwech, but with natural slicked back blonde hair and weirdly bright eyes. if any of you draw them please PLEASE tag my tumblr because i NEED to see them but i also have NO artistic skills so like ya know :(
he really has a list to choose from at this point, so they ended up not being able to talk or do spells. Instead they listened to the tiny man rant about proper ways to hold a wand, and though he definitely ignored Draco and his friends passing notes, he was
Draco was, indeed, very late for his next class. So late, in fact, he accidentally missed the whole thing while he was in Dumbledore’s study.
gay so the papers still have something to antagonize him about. His first course of action after being cleared? Bullying Dumbledore into letting him give his god damn godson a mother fucking
Once, when he was younger, Draco overheard his grandfather call his mother the ‘Ice Queen’, and he hadn’t understood why. His mother is a breath of fresh air. Charming, delicate, warm and polite to almost everyone unless she has a reason not to be. She was always kind and loving to him, even the few times she had sent terror through his blood, she always ended with a hug. Sitting across from her and the other two pureblooded mothers put a new perspective on that nickname.
It’s that exact moment that everything comes crashing down and Dobby throws the sock on the floor, wailing and beating his head into the floor. “Dobby is a stupid elf! Dobby doesn’t know! Dobby has no home now! Nowhere to go! Dobby will die with no wizard to protect him! Dobby is-”
The last thing Draco Malfoy expected to be doing on his train ride back home was dreading it and being stared at by Harry Potter, who had, for some unholy reason, decided to pick the cart across from his for the train ride home.
“And then what? Would they have hidden their magic away? You remember the witch-hunts happening back then, James wouldn’t have endangered Lily like that, much less Harry.”
That seems to strike a nerve, their eyes light up at the mention. Probably there for information, which is perfect seeing that he has none on the subject. Can’t leave them empty handed, plus this is a chance to clear out his house’s name. “I
Harry holds his hands up in surrender, “But you didn’t! No one got hurt! And everyone understands, they took your sister! I was ready to kill anyone who got in the way of me getting Ron, and if it makes you feel any better you looked like a badass the entire time!”
The quiet voice vibrates from the other side of the fence, making a mockery of the eerie silence that Draco can’t stand.
, as though his ancestors would be proud of his father’s willingness to act like a fangirl over something as stupid as an evil lizard-man.
the right move, as he’s quite literally picked up and forced into a bath. Blaise stays in the room with him, sitting and petting LuLu on a bench by the tub while an elf- he’s really got to learn their names, Hadbey, maybe?- washes his hair and chest. Draco finishes the rest like some weird spell had come over him, Blaise promises not to look but once a towel is wrapped around Draco’s waist, he does.
He’s never failed before, and he’s fought Riddle at least three times and won every time, right?” Another nod. “Even when he was at full power against baby Harry, the guy just vanished after one curse. Harry’s got this, you said it yourself, he won’t lose. He’s got Ron and Hermione, and they’ve got the three of us and we’ve never failed before, we have
“Yes, I am aware.” Krum looks just as startled as Fleur, which is weird since they both know. “I thought it was common knowledge that people always cheat in these types of things?”
Before he can process what that means, Hermione gasps beside him and he turns in time to see them. Actually fucking
And when everyone asks where you got your robes from, you will tell them it was the best seamstress in all of England,
In hopes of finding some clue to where he went, if he was alive, if he offed himself or was killed when no one was looking.
It’s not an ugly room, per say. Much like the common room, there are windows into the Black Lake, giving a view to sparkling water and little creatures that like to swim all hours of the day. LuLu’s chasing a fish by the bed furthest from the door, tucked between the wall and a single ornate black nightstand. Their trunks are nowhere to be seen, but they each have dressers that match their side tables, they each have lush forest green chaises at the foot of their beds, they each have waning imperial flowers that someone has transfigured into soft white lights, they both have Slytherin green comforters on black poster bed frames and they each have a chair right by the fire separating the windows on the long side of the bedroom.
And when Harry sees his outfit, he all but screams in frustration. No wonder Seeker thought Cedric was a second choice.
you to come to me about these things! A cut is one thing, but this? I cannot express the longing I feel to hex your father, the only reason I haven’t is because of the danger it would pose! I really ought to hex
Draco pauses, not sure about the new affection for the stranger in front of him. Lupin seems trustworthy, he’s never felt so at ease around a stranger before, and the man was in league with Dumbledore, which meant he was in league with Potter. Plus, if it weren't for him stepping in and getting rid of the Dementor... If that much was true then….
“Professor,” Draco begins, things gathered and ready to leave if this does go horribly wrong, “Call me Draco. I am more than my father’s son.”
Draco’s suspicions about Dumbledore’s sanity, or lack thereof, were confirmed the second he told the boy that he thought a group of thirteen year olds making a blood-and-magic binding contract was a good idea.
She glares at him, but makes no further moves towards his plate. Pansy and Blaise stifle their laughter behind coughs, completely giggling when Draco sneaks her a bit of the white meat anyways. How could he deny those sparkly blue eyes?
She was declaring that he would be her lunch, and Fred bet twenty gallons that he wouldn’t die until the last task, so he can’t really do that yet.
of his friends, and when he wasn’t making sure they were studying, they had been getting an earful too. Before he knows what he’s doing Draco’s nodding and they make their way to the hillside.
They keep running until they reach the heart of the forest, and only then does Lucius turn and do a headcount before addressing the Weasley crew.
Harry wishes she’d sent him upstairs. Upstairs is where his cot is. He doesn't get a real bed, but they did give him a room after the whole ‘wizards at our house’ ordeal. Yes, the room doubles as a storage room for things Dudley can’t decide if he likes or not, but it’s a room all the same.
LuLu picks that exact moment to hop into his lap, meowing at his friends across the table and looking at his chicken like she’s in love with it.
They’re almost to the main room now, which is bad because he might have lied about how scared he is of seeing the Basilisk again. To be fair, the last time he was down here he almost died and lost his best friend’s sister, who’s also like his little sister, and he isn’t looking forward to reliving those memories in his nightmares tonight.
Draco frowns at that last comment, though he does vaguely recall mentioning how convenient a ‘fall’ down the stairs would be. Like the flooring, the stairs come with a simple spell to remove the old one and pop the new one right in. For a brief second Draco’s worried the house might collapse without the stairs holding it up, but then the spiral is on the ground, quickly shooting up with direction from Draco’s wand, and he hates how good it looks.
His eyes flash in that beautiful grey way, his hair rises just enough to tickle the outskirts of Harry’s vision. Warm to the touch, soft and sweet like a roasted marshmallow. Only this marshmallow has killed for him and would probably do so again.
“They’ve gone to save her,” Snape grimaces. Draco pretends he didn’t hear them, glancing around and surely not peaking at the worry clouding McGonagall’s face as she nods.
Breakfast is always light, fruits and toast, sometimes eggs and coffee. They’ll change it up from there, sometimes homework, sometimes experimental brewing in the cauldron on the second floor, sometimes running just to see who can last the longest, sometimes laying around and doing their own things. Blaise will read, Pansy will paint, and Draco will play piano or mess around with LuLu. He hasn’t been alone since they arrived, and he finds he doesn’t mind it anymore.
The three share a look, Draco wonders if the two adults have the same pressure building behind their eyes.
He always counts. If he doesn’t, Vernon gets a shot at him. Aunt Petunia at least lets him hide it, if Vernon had his way Harry would no longer have a mouth or skin colored skin. The twins voice in the back of his head snark out something about a bruising fetish, but Harry can’t focus on that while he’s counting.
She flings herself onto Draco’s legs again, squeezing them so hard they go numb when she finally lets go.
Draco shutters at the memory, but rises again, pointing his wand directly at the captive fairy in front of him. “
The boy flashes him that charming smile again, “We warn all our first year Huffles to be wary of you, Halloween your first year really had a few of them sacred.”
He tears after the creature, shouting his name while Harry scrambles to his feet to follow Hermione who’s running after her mangled little lion and since all his friends are doing it, Draco thinks
Cedric just sighs, hands out the broom that Draco does take, and then smiles. “Because you’re not your reputation, Malfoy. Not with how much time you’ve been spending with Luna out in public. How you treat Fleur, the way you looked when Harry’s name was called is exactly how NaHui looked when my name got called.”
“Have a nice shower?” Sirius asks, and Harry knows it might be a little weird, but it doesn't stop him from walking right up to his loveable degenerate and hugging him.
on their assignments, not just stare at them. They all instantly regret it once they’re in the stands.
I'm pretty sure the next chapter will be the final one but I want to write the first chapter of the next fic in the series so you guys don't get disinterested also I will say the beginning of the next fic is not something you;ll see coming lol
Lucius shakes his head, “My dear boy, you deserve all the kindness your mother and I have to offer. As for the Dark Lord, I have a new plan to please him. If Potter refuses to become your friend, we shall wipe out his other options and aid his Darkness in his return.”
In the sky, you couldn’t miss it even if you were blind, is the same mark that brands his arm for all of eternity. A skull with a snake nearly dancing around it, the Dark Mark, green and very much real.
“I only asked her after lunch, she’s very sweet and told me my French is awful but cute enough to spend the night with.”
“Mr. Malfoy.” Dumbledore’s voice cuts through him like a knife. Which is fair considering he not only cussed in front of a teacher, but also insulted the precious Potter. “You’ll do well to watch your mouth, and I assure you Harry has no idea about his connection to Voldemort. It was completely accidental and I’m not even sure how strong it is. When the curse struck the baby, and the scar was formed, as was the bond. You cannot have one without there other, and I know not to what extent it exists. All we know now is that somehow, someone in the castle is being manipulated by Voldemort himself, and that may or may not be Harry-”
“Naturally, I haven’t seen him in nearly a year, much less had time to celebrate his birthday in a way he deserves.”
Although he does almost let out a snort when his father pretends to give a damn about the ministry. He idly wonders what the Ministry would do should they discover his father's Dark Collection.
Pansy’s hand comes to rest on his own, warm and grounding. “Yes, but what about the monster? Surely it’s not safe.”
He’s really too tired to be doing much, but he doesn’t trust the train. Something could get him on the train, besides he could sleep at Hogwarts. Under nice and soft silk sheets...his friends all snoring beside him….the rush of water nearby and just close enough to lull him into a beautifully safe darkness…..
Oh well, it’s not like he hadn’t disappeared before. Except he hadn’t. Not on Sirius and Remus, at least.
All three of them blink at him, which is fair. And yeah, he’s pretty open about it because it feels like the sort of thing to talk about. Plus, when you live in a dorm it’s nearly impossible
“Think of it as a revitalizing potion. It essentially gives you a few weeks of extra motive, energy, and endurance.”
“Yeah, uh….we’re friends with snakes I guess?” He looks at the ropes, the quite room, and then the ropes again. “Sorry, I just wanted to test it out, but I can uh, I can put these back on I guess? I don’t really know-”
The answer is well played. It leaves both Draco and Harry gagging at the implications, shaking their heads to get rid of the mental image.
And then he had to be up at three on Thursday morning for Astrology, and the course began again, this time with
“And Granger was only five steps away from the library when she was attacked, wasn’t she?! How much time do you think that is, Blaise? I’m thinking maybe all of thirty seconds.”
Draco’s sure to steer Harry further away from the two teachers before he can ask what the nickname meant.
“Yes, Draco. The last time it was open, Riddle had done it himself. A muggle was killed then, it almost shut down the school. They were difficult times, and if it is opened again...I fear the worst, for both Mr.Potter and ourselves. Not even I know the beast Salazar Slytherin has bread down there…”
That still doesn’t make everything as clear as he’d like it to be, but if Snape is in on it, surely it couldn’t be that bad. Everyone deserves something small that made them happy, right? It was okay if he took this small bit of happiness, right?
“Hello.” He tries, like he’s not bound to a chair by cushy velvet ropes, courtesy of Narcissa. “I bet you’re wondering why I’ve been gone…”
LuLu finds them eventually. She meows at Draco like she’s cussing him out and honestly she’s been spending far too much time around Pansy with
“It says,” Blaise continues, “That you cannot lie to us. Ever. If you do you’ll spend the day speaking in Latin until you tell us the truth, we’ll face the same thing..”
The six gather around and spend the rest of the ride laughing. They don’t talk about the near death experiences. That Lupin has left and some weirdo would probably take his place and make life miserable. That Draco and Harry were both returning to a summer full of abuse. No one says a word about the millions of things that could go wrong until the train starts to slow down and Harry holds up his Invisibility Cloak.
If he couldn’t be safe, he could at least promise to return to them. And that he did, looking at the two sleeping figures on either side of him, he swore to Death himself that he would always return to them, no matter what. They were loyal and he returned the favor ten-fold, once a snake was loyal, there was no going back. No second guesses, no changing minds. Yet, somehow, Draco didn’t feel a smudge of anxiety as he made the oath. Only a deep sense of belonging he had never felt before.
guess who has covid ahahaha. it's not funny, i am very upset about it, but on the plus side this means i have more time to write so i'll be updating tomorrow too if i don't do it later today!
“Yes, I’m pretty sure we’ve covered that already. Are you going to keep laughing at me or tell me what the hell I’ve been missing?”
Lucius joins his wife’s side, easily linking their fingers together. Narcissa smiles at him in a way Sirius kinda missed. The full, completely in-love, stuck in the heart type of way that he hasn’t seen since they were students.
Harry takes a second to really look at his arm, Blaise’s wonder-filled face, and Draco’s tired one. Then he looks down and says, “Um, he kinda made me drink his blood?”
hey, just a heads up, the next chapter is going to be Dark and Difficult to deal with. I'm gonna put a trigger warning for it, but for those who have been following this chapter for chapter I want you to be very aware that even just playing out the scene in my head has been difficult, but it's essential for plot progression.
Hermione laughs, nearly bumping into Ron and Pansy, “That’s because you’ve decided to become Pomfrey’s torture toy.”
She drags him back through the kitchen, past the living room and the stupid fucking broken stair case, and they repeat the process of holding their noses through purple smoke in the hallways, the library, the first bathroom that Draco nearly cries over, a small room that Misty only lets Draco peek into, and finally to a room with an iron door.
Mr. Weasley shakes his head, trying very desperately to tell him to let it lie, but he can’t. Draco steps behind Winky who freezes with his next words.
It comes off rude, but Potter’s eyes widen when he looks into Draco’s face. Surely he can’t see the horror, the sadness, the worry on it. Draco hopes not.
To call it awkward would be the understatement of the century. A more accurate word would be painful, excruciating maybe. Something along those lines.
Ancient Studies notes because his legs were aching the entire time and he could not focus until he got to lunch and was suddenly consumed with annoyance all over again.
This rage is, justifiably, all consuming. And the more Draco thinks about the stupid bastard and the things he’s done, the angrier he gets.
Draco chats the spell he’s memorized, a lengthy paragraph but nothing compared to the poems he used to recite for his mother’s pureblood circles.
Lupin nods, “Yes. You and Harry Potter. Quite some intriguing targets if you ask me, oh there’s no need to worry, Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure it was just a routine check for and fugitives, if you catch my meaning. I really should be off to see the driver now, do make sure to eat that, you’ll feel much better afterwards.”
Harry sets the note aside, hardly believing there’s more than five hundred pages in the tiny book labeled
“Well, they don’t happen often, and this is a little weird, so hear me out.” Godric, they really don’t have to look like the sky is falling. “In first year I kept having dreams about Professor Quil and then Riddle was in the back of his head. In second year I kept having dreams about snakes and someone dying and then Riddle was trying to kill children, and I got a break fourth year, but in fifth year they were awful too. I had a dream about some old groundskeeper dying, and about that Barty Crouch guy working with Riddle, and then
“Which,” Blaise follows suit, leaning back and wrapping the blanket tighter around his shoulders, “means we’re also in deep now.”
Albus. According to James and Lily Potter, Harry should never have met the Dursley’s in the first place. He was left to Sirius, and if Sirius were incapable, Remus. If both of them were gone, by the Potter’s word, he should’ve been taken into
Beside him, Potter relaxes every so slightly, but then the door is opening and Memory Draco is tossed inside. They hurry in, despite at least two of them wanting to run away. Lucius places his wand on the door window, just out of Memory Draco’s reach. For a moment he thinks Potter is going to vomit.
“Oh I’d give up anything to hit him across the head one good time, just not when everyone is suspicious about everything. Besides, I only have two days left to beat you at Wizard’s Chess.”
“Your goal, Albus has been to protect him.” Molly reminds him, “If Riddle already has a hold on him then Severus is right, there is no need to force him into that position!”
He makes a yelp a few seconds later, if Draco had to guess it’s probably because Pansy stomped on his foot.
Hagrid grabs the beast by its neck, and suddenly Draco feels a little light headed. There’s a lot of blood everywhere, dripping through his fingers and staining his robes. Blaise looks horrified, and even Potter and crew look a little concerned. Someone hoists him up in big arms, to his right he vaguely hears Granger say “He needs Madam Pomfrey!” and is suddenly very thankful to have her in this class.
“So I spent all of my life, eating scraps, barely seeing the outside world, locked away in this little cupboard, constantly being told about how awful ‘my kind’ are and then one day a giant shows up and brings me to this place….this
The elf pauses from where he was about to begin his head smashing once more and smiles. Harry, on the other hand, is suddenly very confused and very tired. Maybe he
She bustles around the cafe for a few minutes, then plops a new cup of coffee in front of Draco, “Here, Dearie, this is your favorite.”
Draco refrains from speaking, lest he tell her about what his father thought of him opening packages, even if they were addressed to him.
A little ways down, over the rest of the down stairs, are two guestrooms with an adjoining bathroom. At the end of the hall is a child’s bedroom, and Draco can’t stop himself from picturing little Alexandra playing with toys, laughing at bubbles, and being
Oh fuck, Blaise pulled out his no-bullshit voice. That was never good for his arguments, or his jokes. Call him a coward, but without those he didn’t really have much else to fight with at the moment.
Draco grins, though he does have to admit Mrs. Zabini angry is the type of scary his father aspires to be.
Blaise got Longbottom when he wasn’t looking, “Didn’t wanna be too mean with Mcgonagall standing right there, just a quick pantsing spell, he was wearing heart boxers.”
No one would want to see the Dark Lord, and Draco was sure a few heads would roll if he stepped up and a dead Harry Potter looked back at him.
Millie departs with them as she has to be home in time to bake with her grandmother, and since it’s still light out Draco decides to go for a swim.
Ah; so it’s Hagrid who’s carrying him. He would be mortified if he wasn’t so thankful to have something warm keeping him from losing his grip on reality.
When Hagrid releases the rest of Buckbeaks’s friends, the whole class pairs up to attempt the same idiotic thing as Potter, and given his luck, Draco winds up with Buckbeak himself.
“I see.” The old man waves his hand and Fawkes appears in the room, happily messing up Draco’s hair with his beak, he can’t find it in himself to stop the phoenix.
“By Potter no less,” Lucius sneers, “I thought I told you I would take care of that as long as you kept up your grades. I did not expect you to make an utter fool of yourself.”
Hermione shrugs, “He’s been having more and more nightmares recently. He barely slept beforehand with all this Sirius Black bullocks, now with a living dead man, Dementors, and overthinking on top of his school work and Quidditch…..I think his brain just doesn’t let him anymore.”
“As for my late night wandering, I was checking to see who had gotten into the chamber, curious is all, and I was discovered by Snape and McGonagall, Snape didn’t believe my innocence, so he had me come with him, and McGonagall is easy to fool once feelings are involved. Snape covered for me, and I agreed with him to lower her accusation.”
we're picking up the pace!!!! also i love wolfstar and annoyed narcissa feat brat draco. how Pure and Good, anyways were you expecting lucius to finally man up for his son? and can we please talk about harry 'no i dont like draco but also let me buy him a goodie' potter and draco 'i will choose harry over my father every single time, but also it's nothing personal despite the fact that he calms me down in a way no one else can' malfoy?
Draco hopes Snape takes the note to heart. From the smile slowly blooming across his face, he appears to. Which is good, because Draco has a professor to meet in exactly twenty minutes.
?” Draco sneers. Imagine that headline; Breaking News; Malfoy vs. Malfoy, the son of a former Death Eater says ‘no’!
Draco rolls his eyes, going to grab Fawkes so Snape can look through books, but Fawkes refuses to leave the hat alone. Eventually he takes the stupid hat and gives it to the Phoenix, “Is this what you want? What could you possibly need with the hat-”
“Prepare?!” Hermione shouts. Blaise still isn’t functioning properly, and Draco can’t fault him for it. “He has
for a moment and let us explain,” Blaise glares, “Then maybe it would make a little more sense. Can you manage that?”
“There are clicks, and it has the ten basic creams and salves from that book you showed me. I made them correspond with the emergency of a situation, so the ones most important have the least amount of clicks. I figured it could be used for medical emergencies or for those that don’t have a lot of medical experience.”
As far as smart moves go, cutting off an ancient being probably isn’t one, but what’s done is done and the sullen snake head turns to him, so he continues.
“Well, if you really think of Sirius and I as your family, then you should probably call me Remus. I’m not a teacher anymore, you know.”
He’s fourteen, alone with his cat, and in paradise. Maybe he could just stay here forever. Maybe if he begged enough, mother wouldn’t force him back into the shit show that his world has become, and maybe the guilt of leaving Harry to die wouldn’t be that bad after all.
In all honesty, rebuilding a house isn’t that drastic in retrospect to what his friends have been off doing. In a way it suits them. Draco, once the head of the pack, the one they all listened to and followed, being left in the dust by his magnificent friends.
“I had Kreecher bring me a vile from the Black storages, but Sirius came in and told me to bring you down for hot chocolate. It’ll help with the taste.”
him. The one who did all of Draco’s dirty work, only for him to die alone, killed by his own master.
He was going to have a stroke before this class was over with. Hagrid took Granger’s book and opened it with ease after running a finger down it’s spine. It had been that simple? Oh fuck he was gonna blow.
Draco does as instructed and follows Severus like a dutiful soldier marching off to war. Their footsteps echo like some sort of fucked up drums playing them to their death. They pause at the dungeon doors and even though Draco knows the paintings are watching, he still takes Severus’s hand.
Harry swallows as his friends shake their heads, and he can see Ron begging with his eyes to leave the room with him and the girls, but Harry steps up, between the twins and their mother.
“She knows what he did to you,” Is the quiet reply, “She didn’t say much else, other than you needing to be here. I assume she wants to save her breath and tell us at the same time.”
Given the upcoming match, Draco, Harry, and Weasley hadn’t been able to attend their meetings as much, which left the other three in close quarters where they apparently got along just fine. In all honesty, between his studies and practices, Draco was so tired he didn’t give a rat’s ass about any of it.
His professor looks like he’s aged substantially in the past few seconds, “So we’re dealing with a giant deadly snake, your father, the grounds-keeper who would know more about this than either of us in Azkaban, Dumbledore missing, and Potter’s inability to stay out of trouble.”
Merlin, give him strength. Draco counts to ten, pointedly ignoring the piles of animal skulls, that are very much real, so he doesn’t start screaming. “Fine, then. The last time you saw
sick in the head. Or like...how long has it been since he hacked at his skin like a wannabe lumberjack. Do those still exist? Who’s to say, honestly. Who cares? Who-
Blaise, the bastard, finally got to partner with a plant shop and focus on wizarding pharmaceuticals.
“Yes. Second-hand accounts can only do so much, and it’s like…” Harry runs a hand through his hair. “Like the outside of a puzzle is there, but I can’t fill it in.”
Snape drags him to the Potions labs every Tuesday and Thursday before practice to help find a cure for his arm because, naturally, his father used some curse not even Dumbledore could figure out, so far the trial and eras weren’t going well. Draco had probably used up half the school’s reservoir of Blood Replenishing potions by now.
“Sit down, will you. This is going to be a long one, oh, and shut the door will you, Blaise-bear? This is one of those things that if you talk about it, you’ll die, so we probably shouldn’t let people know too much about it.”
but also WARNING for the bit of cannon tragic Harry backstory. It's not really a main focus, more mentioned briefly but still just in case, ya know?
“Potter will live with Remus and Sirius, good. Now that we’ve taken care of that, would you care to beg Sirius for your original question, or perhaps you can apologize to the Malfoys and Weasleys, and myself of course, for this fruitless waste of time.”
“Okay. Dragons. We’re dealing with dragons, and since you’re rather calm about it, I assume you think you have a good plan. However, I tend to agree with my son on most things, so allow me to give you a bit of advice. If you haven’t already, charm your undergarments. All of them, even your glasses. You’ll want not just heatproof, but water and ice proof as well. Dragons are more than just fire, you know. If you’re not given armor (“He
“Study?” Pansy glares at the boys, “Work? Design the best dress this school has ever seen? Maybe not die for one year? I’d very much like to have just
Seeing that birds can’t talk, he doesn’t get a reply, but he does follow Fawkes to a window and open it for him, “Go and help him, boy. I’ll give you treats when you get back.”
Because he is stupid and forgot that while Harry fucking Potter lacks most, if not all, common sense, he had left him with Ron fucking Weasley, the most ignorant and air-headed wizard of their time.
“Well, everyone, meet Peter Pettigrew,” his cousin manages to choke out, “He’s gonna be my first kill-“
Dumbledore chuckles, moving forward to pat his arm and Snape instantly knows he’s lost. Draco can hardly contain his excitement.
No. No he did not because he was very concerned about his father, and getting to talk to Harry, but she doesn’t need to know any of that-
.” The elder Malfoy spits, and to Harry’s horror, the man raises his hand and pushes his son to the floor.
Draco fights the urge to roll his eyes at his friends, really, he wasn’t doing anything wrong. If anything, he was trying to fix what his father had done. Forgive him for attempting to be a good person. Blaise sees the look on his face and softens, moving cautiously forward.
Narcissa considers this with a small smile. “So you, Harry James Potter, want access to your own vault that has been locked? Was it done so by a family member?”
A look of pure terror comes across his father’s face as green light shoots into the sky and the Dark Mark is looming over them.
And then he sees the first year that asked for Potter’s autograph. The one he had made fun of,  the one who had stood up to him, the one lying frozen with a look of pure horror etched on his features. Reaching out like he'd been holding something, limbs just as stuck as the rest of him.
“Dobby. If I ask you to do me a favor, and not tell anyone, one that is very dangerous and could get us both in a lot of trouble, maybe even killed, would you do it?”
For starters, he had to go down to Snape’s office because he would have a class when he was needed most, and then he had to almost run to make it in time for Defense Against the Dark Arts, which meant he had no time at all to prepare his mind for the foulness of Lockheart parading about and making them take a quiz about his
“Mr. Malfoy,” the toneless voice says, although Draco swears he can sense worry under it all, “Come with me immediately. Your luggage will be seen to, you can bring your Kneazle, and do not worry about dinner. You will eat in my office.”
Ron shares a wide-eyed look with him. Harry gets it, he’s also a little scared. Draco’s starting to wake up, Hermione seems thrilled, Blaise rolls his eyes.
His heart beat picks up. Sirius Black maybe?  He couldn’t have gotten in the school though. There was no way for him to sneak in unnoticed. It was impossible…..besides he wasn’t the man’s target….either way the suspense is starting to irritate him so he snatches his wand and whirls around, pointing it into nothingness.
He would glare but Blaise is already doing it. A poor imitation, really, Draco could show him a pointer or two, but he knows his friends have a point. His little meeting with Potter on the first day had made him anxious, put him in a completely sour mood, and he took it out on any annoying bastard who dared to get in his way. So far he had only hexed about thirty people, but given that hexing was generally frowned upon, he supposes it's kind of an issue. He had expected to come down to breakfast and see the entire school talking about him, whispering about him being a blood traitor, making fun of him for being thrown around so easily, and yet nothing happened. If anything the gossip around him had been his own doing, Potter really was keeping his mouth shut. Here Draco is, at lunch, and everything is completely normal. Well as normal as it could be, putting on a show of pretending to ignore Potter when he would usually be heckling him was a little bit unusual.
Something that will make the silence stop being so loud, that will free his friends, get his mum out of house arrest, give Kingsley his free time back. Something that will cancel the life depths people are sickened by. Something that will grant him freedom he’s never known.
. It wasn’t their fault, the creature really was too cute for her own good. They’re all having a great day, so perfect nothing could taint it.
i hope it was up to your expectations! be warned though, i have a path if i decide to keep umbitch around and a bath if i decide to toss her out, i'm just not sure which path to take...yet
In other words, this is a whole lot of work to bind an elf to the ocean. At the rate they’re going, Draco might as well bind her to him and call it a day.
The ‘D’ had been the most amusing part, if Draco was suddenly going to start leaving him little notes, they should probably come up with another, less obvious sign off. But in order to do that, they would actually have to
An hour later and Dobby has finally calmed, walking him through every second of his interaction with Potter. He spends hours going over every little detail, making sure there is no evidence to lead back to himself. If his father doesn't kill him once he finds out, Severus most certainly would. Eventually he draws it up to being blamed for everything, which he deserves for being a giant ass to everyone, he supposes.
anyways! i'm about to post the first chapter of the next fic where a LOT is going to happen, including the cute scene that everyone knows is coming. leave me some comments and guesses about the story and i'll answer any questions. at the end of the next fic i'll let you guys in on a few secrets and to be honest there are two different places i want to take the plot and i'm trying to figure out how to make us touch both areas so wish me luck and thank you all so much for joining me in this fic :) I hope to see you in the next one
“Sirius Black was returning from a trip to his family’s house that night. He meant to make nice with his brother, and a few other members of his family. Naturally it didn’t end well, I assume you know how your family feels about blood purity, and his choice in lovers was frowned upon to say the least. He was coming to see the Potters and ask for advice, but I was there instead. Sirius tried to warn Lupin, but his mother was quicker...she accused him, and we had no proof to state his innocence.”
“Now,” Pansy says, pinning Draco and Harry with her gaze. “This is not a Christmas gift, but an anniversary gift.”
Hermione huffs, “For crying out loud! If you’re going to tell us about your ancestry will you just get on with it?!”
Snape still has an unusual glint in his eyes, “Well we have the perfect pair right here, do we not? Or are these two students not good enough?”
Everything’s a bit of a blur from there, Draco really can’t remember most of it and he starts to think that maybe he’s reached his threshold for shit he can go through before his mind snaps again. All he knows is one second he’s throwing a protection charm at Harry while clinging to a vicious branch that seems hell-bent on tossing him off the face of the Earth, and the next second he’s going down the same rabbit hole he watched Weasley be dragged off to. Harry lands on him seconds before he can yelp. Hermione tumbles in moments after they’ve stood up and once he’s repaired Harry’s glasses, he swears he going to charm them to never break again, they all look at each other and silently agree that today can’t possibly get any stranger, so why
Draco opened his mouth to protest but Lucius was already exiting the tent and freezing at the sight before him.
Everything would be fine, except Pansy and Blaise have no training, and his mother is deceivingly good at brewing.
Hermione nods and that is apparently enough for Harry because the idiot grabs Draco’s hand and pulls him all the way to the Chamber.
“What is the meaning of this?!” Lucius snarls, opening the door and glaring down at the thing that suddenly looked a whole lot scarier than it had a few seconds ago.
Mrs. Daisy gasps behind them, and Draco realizes with horror that she’s been listening in this whole time. By this afternoon every last one of the nosey shopkeepers will know about this, and
With no effort at all Lucius brings back the smoke. He can feel it, the burning, the pain, the sadness all over again. And in an instant it’s gone, and Harry’s left panting on the floor of the Malfoy’s ridiculous library in their ridiculously big house with his boyfriend’s ridiculous father who’s handing him a ridiculous glass of water.
Which is exactly why Draco goes to see her on Sunday morning, well, that and because his little cousin is there and Luna demanded he go with her.
Pretending like it doesn’t ease a sore spot growing on his soul, Draco nods, offering a ‘thank you’ whispered almost like a prayer. And then he is pushed out the door and ordered to sleep, which he has no problems following.
Draco was here with his father is a complete mystery that Harry kinda needs to know the answer to. Especially when said evil father is casually chatting with the Minister of Magic himself. It’s to make sure he’s safe! Not because something about how Draco looks at Cedric rubs him the wrong way.
“You have something to say, Draco Malfoy?” The man sneers, and because he’s at a breaking point and really fucking fed up with everything, Draco sneers back with ten times the intimidation factor.
The blue around her glows a little more, as though the moon is tugging her backwards. Her hands reach out to him, disappearing in a fog of blue, it travels up her arms, her legs, her torso and-
Draco and Blaise, with their noses in books, lounging in the Slytherin common room while Theo sneers at them. Millie, smirking evilly with the twins as a dung bomb goes off in the background. The brebones of their Yule outfits in Pansy’s hidden workshop. Hermione nearly snorting tea out of her nose in the Gang’s Room. Winky clearly tutting at Draco, who’s asleep with his head on his desk. Harry easily laughing with Cedric and Cho. Luna in one of her famous outfits, smiling at Ginny, who’s blushing even in black and white.
Oh well, at least it’s an improvement from last summer. Or it is until he, Blaise, and Pansy are face to face with their mothers, Severus, and Lucius.
The three are on their feet before he finishes his sentence, Pansy asking the question for all of them, “Who?”
They lock eyes for the billionth time this evening, and then Draco, because he is tired, and because he saw a younger version of the man he most feared, and because Harry
It’s fine, he’ll be fine, he’s good at wandless magic, and if he dies...well, it would mean one less problem for a lot of people.
Nearly a mile later and he’s realizing he probably shouldn’t turn his brain off the second finals end. Proof of his theory lies in the fact that he doesn’t even realize where he’s at until after Weasley has thrown himself on the ground to catch his vermin. Draco really doesn’t even notice until Hermione starts to back up and says “Um, Ron-”
Pansy had gotten an interrogation that lasted all of ten minutes before her mother kindly reminded her father that the Malfoy family was important, and that she should be honored to be so close to Draco.
She’s one of the few people that manage to make his name sound like it isn't an insult or a praise. Just pure ‘Draco’, no intent behind it. One of the many, many reasons he values her friendship so much.
Draco lights up like a tree, “Buckbeak!” Three seconds later he deflates, “I fucking told him not to pull something like this! He nearly died the first time by
Draco almost doesn’t reply, having someone this near is grounding. Plus it’s Harry Potter, the idiot who managed to live year after year so if something fucked up was about to happen to them, having Harry here just meant he would make it out alive. Harry would protect him, keep him safe. He’d fight for Draco just like Draco fights for him because that’s just how it works with heroes.
Draco rolls his eyes at her antics, making his way back to the living room and reaching into his bag for clothes that
After Vince’s death, Greg was inconsolable. Back in Azkaban, Draco would hear him screaming every last damn day. Always asking for Vince, always wondering why it was so cold, calling out to see if Vince was cold too. Once his trial was over, he didn’t have anywhere to go, so Daphne took him in. Apparently he’s a bit of a ghost now, wandering from room to room like he’s still looking for Vince. Theo tells him that it breaks Daphne’s heart.
Howie, with his mouth full of food, beats them to it. “Your sister really didn’t teach you anything, did she?”
Draco pales at first, but quickly begins his bragging, tucking the letter tightly in his pocket and coming up with some excuse he half remembers. He needs to get to Dumbledore and Snape.
“Come on,” Draco whispers, “I think I managed to tire you out, and a bed is much more comfortable than the floor.”
Another challenge, but that one seems a little more impossible than finding a new sofa for the drawing room. Krecher flashes in, leaving a plate of his once favorites out and before he can think he’s blurting out ‘thank you’ and getting a kind smile he hadn’t known the elf to possess. As much as it bugs him, he forgets about it the second Remus walks in.
Draco rolls his eyes. “A party is something we had last Yule, it’s getting drunk and having fun, there are very little rules involved. A gala is supposed to be a charity event. We haven’t had one in years, but typically there is a bit of drinking. Less beer and more fancy wine. There’s a dinner, but given the season I’m assuming Pansy is going to go for a summer spread, and for entertainment I suppose classical music, we are still posh, you know.”
On the plus side, he spent his free period practicing the ‘correct usage of minor healing spells’ with Pomfrey, no,
He’ll be let out in the morning for chores, but for now he has to worry about hiding his newer puffy eye, Draco will be calling any minute.
“Harry, listen.” He really hopes this isn’t going to be sappy, neither of them handle sappy well. “It means a lot that I was the one down there, you know? I mean, we all think of you as family. You mean the world to us, hell, you know you even have your own bed back at the Burrow and I just. What I’m trying to say is uh, well, me too, buddy.”
“Tarantallegra!” he manages between catching his breath, another bout of laughter squeaks out of him at the way Potter’s legs have begun to move. Off to the left he can see Blaise cackling at the two of them.
“Say something!” he all but yells, making Draco flinch and finally meet green eyes that are open. Not closed. Potter is sitting, not lying limp on the Quidditch field. Draco sucks in a deep breath.
Harry nods, not getting it whatsoever, but at least he does understand why Ra was so rude at first. Blaise is looking at him expectantly, and Harry realizes a bit too late that the whole room is looking at him funny.
from the possible killer. He doesn’t stop moving until their little group is in front of the sniffling idiot with a hurt ankle.
not what he wanted to spend the day doing, but he steps inside anyways, making his way to his chair that is thankfully by Snape and not the family. He sits nervously, watches Ellios and Severus nod to each other, and then Ellios is speaking.
She waves, Cedric kisses her on the cheek and closes the distance between them and Harry decides then and there that Cedric deserves the title of Hogwarts Champion not only because he’s kind, charming, funny, and smart, but because Cho might murder someone if her boyfriend dies.
“No you don’t understand,” he tries again, aware enough to know they’re almost at the castle doors and far away that no one will hear him, “He’ll hear about this and try to-“
him if anyone starts to give him shit. It’s him, his friend, uncomfortable clothing, and one Italian club. The latter two facts make him nervous beyond belief, but at least he won’t be doing this alone.
Snape nods ever so subtly, “You should be on to your next class, if you keep asking questions you already know the answers to you’ll be late.”
Blaise would go next, making sure to be extra vicious because he’s almost as over protective as Ron. He’d begin with the quality of Petunia’s ‘fine’ china, slander Vernon’s favorite chair, make sure they know how drab and dreary the wall paper is. He would probably laugh at whatever Dudley thought cool, dumb down his sentences so Dudley could understand the level of insult being directed towards him.
“Stop! Stop! Stop!” Lockheart calls out, making no effort to actually stop them. It’s Snape that mutters “Finate Incantatem” to cease the fight.
Seeing his mother come home, spending the day with her. Getting LuLu, falling asleep with something warm in his arms. Last year, when Harry had been saved, when Dobby had told him he was safe and freed. Snape smiling at some dumb joke he made, Dumbledore offering him a lemon-drop, Fawkes fast asleep on his shoulder. Pansy coming out of her dorm, groaning and not laughing nearly as much as Draco had when they accidentally matched their outfits. Blaise and him cuddled up watching books come to life. Crabbe and Goyle rushing to him to tell him they passed two of their finals with Exceeds Expectations. Draco alone at the top of the Astronomy tower, watching shooting stars. The small moments he treasured, all fading and falling away into images that left him chilled to the bone.
Dumbledore gives him a sad smile but changes the topic out of pity, “You’re rather high strung today, Lupin told me you had quite the amusing rambling about floating heads before your arrival here.”
“If it isn’t the champions!” Seeker gleams in her sly, sticky voice. Something awful lurks behind her smile, Harry hopes it’s just what she had for breakfast.
“Seeing as you were mostly helpful,” the man begins, ignoring his son’s withering and gasping, “I will refrain from cursing you. However, it is time for you to stop making these little mishaps.” He dug his shoe deeper into Draco’s stomach, Harry couldn’t turn away even though he was begging to.
Now he thinks that it was probably not worth it, because Blaise looks pissed and worried at the same time and that
She has wickly wavy hair that trails down her back, big bright eyes, and a beauty mark to the left of thin lips. Normally, Draco wouldn’t be panicking because an intruder means death, which is a good thing, but this isn’t an intruder. She looks more like a ghost patronus.
The cuts and scrapes on the shivering boy isn’t what gets him. It’s the dead look in his eyes, like he can’t even see Harry, like he’s looking into the darkest pit of despair and can’t see a way out. And he’s still standing barefoot in the snow, LuLu frantically meowing at him.
Fleur turns to him with her eyes wide and fists clenched. “You think I’m embarrassed of my magical heritage?” She scoffs, “Never. I am proud to be who I am, let them call me a beast, I hope the pictures of me pointing my wand in the headmasters’ stupid faces make the front cover of every wizard magazine! I am
Pansy can, and will, be cursing them both later, she’s just annoyed because she won’t have access to her sketchbook for the next hour. Millie’s just lucky her book is big enough to hide her grin. The four of them continue making their way down to the dungeons, and yes, they should probably sleep and get ready for tomorrow, but no one’s under the illusion that it’ll actually happen.
“You must have some idea who’s behind it all…” Goyle practically pleads, another mistake on the fraud’s part, they had this conversation last night too.
Cold grey eyes latch on to cold grey skin. Dobby peers up at him, bandages in tow and a worried pinch badly concealed in his brow. Small, not threatening, skinny and dressed in shame, big eyes that made Draco himself feel a little guilty when he commanded the elf too harshly, not to mention the anger he felt after his father had a fit of rage. The elf that had been with him since birth, the one that never asked questions when he needed something dubious, never sold him out on his pranks, his father still didn’t know the truth about how his favorite robe had gotten turned red instead of green. Dobby, his house-elf, was looking to be the exact partner he needed for this year’s troubles.
Cedric scratches the back of his head, “Sorry, Cho. She’s, well...the best to ever happen to me. But that’s besides the point. Look, just. Give Harry his broom, please.”
you! If I hadn’t taken the Mark you’re father would’ve made you take it! If I wasn’t in the raids Luna would’ve
Draco, asleep, completely unaware of Harry making another bad decision: Alarm? Why alarm? It's sleepy time?  What?
“Are we in trouble again?” Draco asks. He’s assuming they’re not going to be secretly served Veritaserum considering that they’re all in workout clothes, but then again, he wouldn’t put it past his mother to sprinkle the stupid potion into their yard fertilizer.
“I know we can’t write, but I expect to see all of you safe and back in this carriage in a few months. Deal?”
The island is stunning, just like it had been when he was little, Baia do Sancho off the coast of Brazil. Full of white beaches and clear waters that Draco once liked to watch fishes swim in. They owned a part of it, big enough for a house, a private beach, and land to hide if one of them needed to use some more….exaggerated magic.
She grabs his arm and marches on, right out the front door and all the way down by the Green Houses before she stops and throws herself into his arms.
“We can do that in the muggle world, right?” Harry whispers back. “Or do we have to get magical clothes too?”
He wakes up at the ungodly hour of four Sunday morning and decides it’s the perfect time to sneak a visit to the infirmary. The sun hasn’t begun to rise, just dark enough to sneak there without waking any of the portraits, or worse, the ghosts. Floating things are down right cranky when something bothers them before they’re ready. Draco is sure to silence his steps, moving quickly so he’s not caught and in trouble before breakfast. One foot in front of the other gets him there quick enough.
“Run.” Lucius says, strained. And then he grabs Draco’s hand and the rest link automatically and they’re sprinting all over again, running as fast as they can until a voice screams ‘stupefy’ and his father hits the ground.
without training? It’s like the boy was asking to die. Draco’s ready to chastise him to no end for that last thing alone, but then he sees the small happy grin Harry has walking back to them and decides it doesn’t matter that much. He might be an idiot, but he hadn’t died yet.
He’s Draco Malfoy, the person who hates Harry Potter most. No one would suspect him of being a spy for Dumbledore, no one would ever guess him of all people to go against his family. And no matter how much he wants to, he can not be friends with Potter. That would blow everything up, although he can’t help but wonder if it would be easier to keep the fool safe if he could persuade him like Granger and Weasley do. Potter obviously needs someone sensible to listen to…
She jumps, looking a little too guilty for any one person, and then sighs. “I have an idea, and none of you are going to like it but it has to be done.”
Pansy, after Draco's medical exams: Why is it always blood? Why can't it be literally any other bodily fluid? Why?
“Deal with me, Potter? Gonna finish what Buckbeak started?” It’s a weak retort, but he can’t manage anything else.
“Are you alright? You didn’t come tonight, there’s been another attack, and it’s bad. I got worried.”
For all of Kingsley’s promises of abandon, the shops are still busy. It’s nowhere near as crowded Diagon Alley, he can only spot about twenty people loitering around, but it’s enough to make him clutch Salem a little closer and keep his head down as he makes his way back to the hardware store.
Harry knows Remus would never hurt him, but he’s also had nothing but violent touches these past few days, and he
His father had not greeted him, in fact this was their first interaction since he arrived yesterday. Narcissa was still in Paris and had no idea her son was home. Draco had left LuLu at Hogwarts out of fear that his father would hurt her somehow, but Lucius had barely acknowledged him the past day. It was almost nice…
It’s not that bad until he steps on rotten wood that caves in, leaving most of his right leg in the floorboard.
“I trust them with my life.” Draco lets the words hang between them for a moment before continuing. “You know they’re contracted to me with a blood binding spell of all things. They wouldn’t be able to talk about anything even if they wanted to, but seeing that their loyalty lies with me I doubt they
“Nonsense, Krecher would never leave a mess lying around.” the Blacks say together, much to Draco’s amusement. He turns those grey eyes on Remus after a moment of watching his mother laugh.
But she was still alone with the bastard that tortured him and then pretended like he had no clue he’d done it.
The cabinets, the broken fridge, the useless stove, the chairs, the tables, even the fucking sink. When he’s left with nothing but an empty room Draco tells Misty that he’s going out.
Buckbeak lands not too far away from where they are and Draco makes sure to place LuLu gently on the floor before hugging the two climbing off the beast.
Hair still messed up from sleep, shirtless and in pants a little on the big side, yawning and making Sirius’s heart double in size.
And because it’s not already awkward enough, Harry picks that moment to rip his hand free from Hermione’s, naturally keeping Draco’s hand in his, and starts rummaging through his pockets.
So no, Draco cannot sleep, he has no intention of ever trying to, and he will continue to pace around his room despite the nervous glances he gets from the house elves that keep coming to check on him.
Draco locks eyes with his professor. Neither of them move for a very long time, but he does lower his wand. He vaguely hears Hermione whispering healing charms, a shaking hand he assumes is Harry’s tangles in the back of his robes but he watches LuLu.
Hey guys! So, I had a person comment recently on chapter 10 that my fic is a lot like the wonderful ShanaStoryteller's Survival is a Talent, and while I disagree, I can see the similarities, so I wanted to tell everyone that I would never insult her like that. I started reading her fic midway through writing Prisoner of a Father, but at that point I had already planned out my fics through the entirety of the Harry Potter books series. She is a wonderful author and I love her works and writing, and as a writer I would hate it if someone did that to me, so I would never do it to anyone else.
Once again shocking Draco, Lucius snorts. Actually, honest to Merlin, snorts, like it’s normal to help his son save his enemy and then laugh about it in the middle of the woods with Death Eaters nearby. He almost busts into insane giggles, and then Lucius straightens, eyes going above their heads and out into the distance.
There are so many holes. So many it’s more holes than it is floor and Draco can feel a headache building. He looks down at Misty, who’s smiling like this is perfectly normal.
now. And isn’t his father going to end up killing one day anyways? He hides things from everyone, even Pansy and Blaise and he’s planning on signing his blood so he can’t do that anymore. Should he turn a new leaf completely? Stop hiding things from people he knows are good, lean on them, let them support him?
“And then the other Death Eaters  found me.” Ellios sighs. They take William’s hand, squeezing it as if apologizing.
The boy acts as though he’s handing over his first born son, but he does hold the squirming rat out and Draco takes it. A ’Petrificus Totalus ’later and it stops moving so he places it on the floor and takes a wide step back.
Well color him surprised and serve him up for dinner, “My mother...she doesn't know. Neither does father, of course, he’s gone a bit off the deep end.”
Salem, the little black Kneazle, is only a month old. So tiny and small, always seeking comfort. On the second day in the run down cottage, Draco had taken his blanket out and the kitten immediately curled up in his lap.
“Nothing too drastic, father wasn’t happy about losing a valued house elf, and he wanted information that I refused to give him. I’m really surprised he didn’t try more drastic measures.”
Anyways, I went off on a tangent while I was writing this because I wanted Draco to finally have a birthday that's actually celebrated, so think of this as a filler episode before another main plot point. See you next Sunday!
3) i'll go ahead and tell on myself, i was debating between this and killing Narcissa later on as the final blow of 'Draco tries to kill his father', and as much as i wanted to write that, i feel as though the parents in HP didn't get a lot of representation, I never felt like i learned about what any of them went through, even though they faced a war with Voldy for much longer than Harry and crew did. They only truly fought a war for maybe a year or two, when in the second book we find out that Voldy has been killing people for a minimum of fifty years, meaning the kids parents and their parents had to be involved more than the books let on and I wanted to show what that does to a person. seeing the people you went to school with die and be driven mad by some villain with an agenda can't have made all of them happy, even if their blood was purer than gold. plus, in all honesty, i couldn't stand to kill my Iconic Ice Queen.
” he hears Lockheart shout. Fills in the gaps of the instructions he’d missed, but he’s too busy laughing to care. It feels like someone is tickling him and it takes a few moments to figure out that he’d perfectly guessed the purpose of the spell. If Potter wanted to play dirty, he could get behind that.
“Please, Mrs. Malfoy, call me Harry. And don’t worry, that includes you Sirius. I totally have the dragon issue covered.”
“I thought I told you to watch yourself around my god father.  As far as I’m concerned, you’re still guilty and adding another murder to the list
“Whatever, she is adorable and sweet, but I’m willing to bet my little Crookshanks won’t like her, plus we have work to do.”
Snape raises an eyebrow, “That chair has been here since I first moved into the room, and I implore you to take a seat in it, you’re swaying on your feet.”
She releases them, cupping Harry’s cheek and smoothing his hair down. “You’re not hurt are you? Lucius told me you saw
Which is a problem seeing as he can’t remember what comment he made in the first place but Harry is staring at him, so he carries on like he does know what he’s doing.
Pansy, Blaise, and Draco all bust out laughing at the face Goyle pulls, Crabbe reaching over him to eat the rest of the enchanted chocolate. So far Draco had hexed twenty five students, dyed Blaise’s hair bright green for an entire hour, gotten Pansy with a laughter potion that only lasted for thirty minutes, stuck Crabbe in place for ten minutes, and left some rather saucy material open on Snape’s desk.
“I didn’t,” Remus sounds more stressed than he does the week of a full moon. “He didn’t have them the year I was at Hogwarts but you heard what Ron and Hermione said….If they’re happening every year do you think we should talk to him about seeing that Mind Healer Draco is going to see? He might have some stuff he’s working through and just not comfortable talking to us about it.”
“Oh absolutely not. We’re adding that to the Tomorrow list! I’ve used up too much magic today and this wand isn’t quite used to me yet, so something that big is going to have to wait.”
It’s nice, Theo’s hug. Warm, but not uncomfortably so. Something he honestly never thought he’d get to experience again. His friend smells like cinnamon and nutmeg, with just a hint of old spice and it takes him back to simpler times, back when he, Theo, and Blaise would argue over who smelled the best.
Narcissa glares at both of them, “So you’re the idiot that has my son convinced he wouldn’t get himself killed during battle. I ought to hang you by your toes, Albus Dumbledore! Or let Lucius torture you!
“It’s not much,” Lupin explains as he opens it to reveal a small silver frog that looks exactly like the ones Lupin forced them to eat after each practice, “But it’s something to remember good times by.”
“You’re the one who isn’t being open, hiding things, and clearly in need of help even though you refuse to admit it. We are, and have always been, loyal to you. We’re just tired of you not returning the favor.”
The end! Sorry this took so long, I like to post the first chapter of the next fic when I post the last chapter of a fic in a series so people can keep going and it's not really an end. (plus i'm low key scared people won't read it if I don't) Anyways! I hope you enjoyed, let me know what you thought and I'll see you in the next fic!
Gabbi is asleep in the corner, Fleur quietly hanging clothes. She pauses when she sees them and Merlin, Draco really hopes she hasn’t been crying this entire time.
“It was kinda gross, actually, he was rubbing blood onto this wound in my arm, it’s right-” Huh? That’s funny. Harry knows, he
to be the backbone of another war! It didn’t work then, it won’t work now, and all you’ll end up with is dead bodies and angry parents.”
He’s had enough of the Death Eaters for a lifetime. No one could be in that group and stay sane. Not with all the torture and killing, the rape and brutality of it all. Not when it meant looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life.
Naturally, Harry and the rest of the house, now awake and coming to find Ron shouting and crying in the common room, think he’s gone mad. And then McGonagall comes back and does what no one else thought to, merely asks Sir Cadogon if he let a man through the door. Proving the house’s complaints about how stupid the painting is, the knight replies that he did, in fact, let a man in, because he had, much to Neville’s horror, found
They don’t talk until they’re inside Harry’s bathroom and he finds himself shaking in his boyfriend’s arms.
“This is going to seem silly,” Draco starts, “But I need that in the contract. Bring it to the Astronomy tower after dinner tomorrow, I’ll meet you there after my extra assignment with Lupin. We’ll go over every word, work out any discrepancy, and if it meets everyone’s standards….”
“Merlin, did you listen to a word Mr. Malfoy said?” Blaise rolls his eyes, “You’ll be learning occlumency. It’s a-fuck why did no one think to explain this to you?”
That thought is probably what drives him to do it. Moonlight leaks in from the windows on his way down from Dumbledore’s office, so he knew it was night. How late it was he did not know, so when he realized that most of the paintings were glaring at him as he walked by, he tried to piece it together.
Theo claps him on the shoulder. After a moment he pulls Draco in for another hug. Chest to chest, arms around his waist, something that he’s never been comfortable with. And yet, it feels nice. Warm. Safe.
“Exactly.” Narcissa nods, “You’re a smart one, Ronald. And you, Miss Hermione Granger, I’ve heard you are the brightest witch of your age.”
Katheriene frowns, but her and Lucius share a look that ends in them both shrugging so Harry hopes there’s a general agreement
Then again, Draco needs a little happiness. Desperately needs it. Long nights are cold when there’s no company but thoughts and fears. Pain had proved useful to ground him just like he thought it would; he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t put his own ebony knife to good use on his thighs. On the plus side, his knife wasn’t cursed, so the cuts he gave himself only lasted for a few days, unlike the one on his arm that was just beginning to heal from where it had been reopened over break.
Sirius looks out into the night with a sigh, “And then we went to Hogwarts. And I wasn’t put in Slytherin. I begged the hat, I knew what would happen as soon as I was in Gryffindor reds. Father was close to death, Mother had wanted to disown me from birth. Bella was starting to lose her sanity, Regulus was being black mailed into Voldemort’s arms, and Sissy...she was too scared to stick her neck out for anyone that wouldn’t benefit her. It was shit. Got my first howler that told me I was disowned, and I really thought there was nothing left for me. But then I met James and Remus.”
“Draco.” Blaise’s other hand slips under his chin and he’s staring into deep brown eyes, “Focus, darling, how long have you been doing this to yourself?”
And then Draco stops, pulling Lucius to a stop with him. He follows the boys gaze to a group of redheads, and in the middle of them, Harry fucking Potter.
“We all know that the elements created magic, right? You all paid attention to that in History of Magic class?”
Even so, Harry knows what happens when he disobeys here, so he creeps out, making sure to stay in front of Remus so Aunt Petunia can’t hurt him.
it for the man. He remembers a Lily person he was told to never speak of, but besides her it’s been nothing. Less action than Riddle, which is an unpleasant thought to have when staring at the back of your god father who is trying to teach.
He’s fully prepared to launch a Crucio at the first tuff of blonde hair he sees, and then his mother laughs. It’s a little breathless and has just a bit of a crazed tone, but it’s still laughter.
Albus Dumbledore pointed his wand at Ron’s face. From that moment on he doesn't really remember much, which pisses them all off. Draco to the point that he’s ready to march into Dumbledore’s office and have a word with the man himself.
“Okay…” Sirius takes a deep breath, “Okay...okay we can’t kill them. We’re going to out parent the fuck out of them and I’m going to make Narcissa help me hurt them through completely legal and respectable ways.”
Fucking goblins. “Howie...what Griphook had you do was essentially give me an ultimatum. I either accept the partnership or become a particle owner of your shop. Think of it like this, a partnership investment means I share a percentage of whatever gains or losses you make. But as a particle
“Granger?” He calls, feet carrying him quicker. No one is in the castle because of the game, but he checks anyways, looking around before shaking her shoulders. “Granger?!” Petrified just like the others.
anything. That being said, Snape might be his last option….if the man wouldn’t turn in his father and completely fuck up the plan in place if he were to be a complete spy. No, Snape had too much of an emotional connection here. Maybe he could whisper it to LuLu in the dead of night, LuLu couldn’t do more than hiss and growl, and that wouldn’t jeopardize something so important.
“Draco, it’s not that we don’t trust you...it’s just not safe. Everyone is terrified of who will be next, and we don’t want it to be you in the hospital wing.”
Draco clears his throat, “Do you really want a picture of us kissing on the front page of tomorrow’s newspaper?”
Draco stiffens in his seat. He hasn’t quite had time to process just how badly he and his friends messed up this round, or the amount of trouble they were in, but one thing was becoming scarily clear to him. Narcissa was right. Her blood coursed through him, he was a part of her for nearly a year, her blood was so intermingled with his and every person with a brain knows how much flesh was shared between a mother and a child. Father provided sperm and magic, but it was the mother’s body that built babies from within….constructed them with their own blood. And since blood contracts needed a willing person to sign with blood borrowed from their mother…
And then, as if this afternoon hadn’t already been weird as hell, the boys all slowly look up to see two very alarming things.
Snape takes a deep breath, “Sirius Black was Lupin’s lover until the moment he went to Azkaban. Tell me, Draco, wouldn’t you let your lover in to finish what he started?”
Blaise gets caught up in it all next, one well timed water balloon hanging in the door of potions, but he gets Draco back in record time, both laughing against each other in the hallway. No one bothers the Slytherins today, too afraid of getting caught up in one of their favorite traditions. Pike gets hexed by someone, probably Milicent’s revenge for the time he called her fat. It’s all going well, the bunch of them sit together at dinner, sharing stories and it’s really the most fun he’s had in ages.
did someone say two chapters in the same night? I wrote this once in about an hour so if it's shitty i'm so sorry but i'm gonna write the next one when i wake up so uhhhhh see you then? goodnight!
Draco doesn’t even bother rolling his eyes at Blaise, or explaining to Crabbe and Goyle where they had disappeared to. Partly because he’s too busy shoving food into his mouth and then choking on it when he sees his father’s owl coming towards him.
“No it wasn’t!” Hermione cries, Ron’s arms around her so she can’t come forward, or perhaps just to keep her from sobbing on the spot. “Mr. Malfoy and Draco saved our lives today! They helped us escaped those masked men and took us somewhere safe! We were in the forest and Mr. Malfoy told us to get behind him and then the spell was cast! Check his pockets if you must,
The last time he checked, the main living room is not stone and he knows for a fact that Kreecher would freak if it ever became
Draco has been called many things in his thirteen years, but no one had ever accused him of being patient.
“I did it!” The boy yells, almost bouncing with happiness. Draco himself is fighting a large smile. Lupin just grins, “You did! I’m very proud of you.”
“You really are bloody brilliant,” he whispers, turning to find Dumbledore, only to turn back around and securely tuck the paper back in. He didn’t know how he knew, but Potter would be needing that. If nothing else, to know that she figured it out.
to see his completed cottage. He’s managed to keep telling them ‘no’, but here is a stranger (to them, at least) that Draco’s completely comfortable letting into his house.
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that so he just throws his arm around his god-father and calls it a day.
Currently he lays on his stomach on the floor of the Dumbledore’s office, pretending to read, but really playing with Fawkes like he came up here to do in the first place. Something about the rain pattering on the windows and the Phoenix sleeping beside him relaxes his shoulders, putting him in an ease he hasn’t had in a long time. Absently scratching at the small feathered head, he lets his mind wander to Potter, the one trouble constantly with him. He looked more relaxed than he did at the beginning of the year. Eyes brighter, but also more focused, like he was listening for something no one else could hear. Part of it worried him, but he knew better than to approach.
The boy’s words are so slurred with sleep Draco hardly understands them. Instead of replying, he brushes some of Blaise’s hair out of his face, muttering a ‘go back to sleep’ to eyes that have already closed.
She speaks way too fast for him to fully comprehend, but he nods and smiles anyways. Having a Greengrass in his debt would be
“She was under the Imperius Curse! No one is safe under an Unforgivable, you of all people should know that!”
He’ll do it in the summer, when he’s trapped at the Dursleys’ with nothing better to do than read about the dead people that might have loved him.
It doesn’t stand a chance in the face of the horrors he’s seen, the evil things he’s done. Logic can’t save him from the cold that’s apparently a permanent part of his body now. It can’t help his emotion filled brain that’s overwhelmed by the sight of his room. By his wand, on his bedside table, by the sheets that should’ve been burned, by the trophies that he never really earned, by the Dark Mark that’s forever a part of him now.
He can practically feel the adults gaping at him, but Harry and Hermione are beaming at him like he personally put the sun in the sky. The hope clouding Winky’s heartbroken eyes is just the cherry on top.
spoiler; this chapter is building for the next fic i'm writing because the slytherin crew is v important to the next two plots. also we only have one more chapter!!!! are you excited? I'm excited, although it is going to be a bit different.
The snakes, there’s only like, fifty of them, ignore her completely, looking directly at Harry like they’re waiting for an order.
is always crystal clean, though it’s never centered correctly. His bed is always made, but the pillows are also rumpled enough to make him want to crawl back in it. His bookshelf has never known dust, but the books are slanted in some places, even with bookends to make room for the Quidditch trophies Sirius had gotten a hold of for him.
Hard grey eyes meet his, his son looks like more of a man than he knows he’ll ever be. “I can’t leave him.” Is all the boy says before tearing his hand out of Lucius’s grasp and running towards the group and he
Sensible Draco would not answer because he knows Blaise is going to either give him hell or watch him like a hawk, or both which is the worst and most likely to happen. However, Blaise is shaking. And Blaise does better when there’s someone else to focus on. And, it’s an asshole move he knows, but he doesn’t know how to handle it if
“Really? Potter and Weasley? Polyjuice? To get in Slytherin? Who do they think they’re trying to be?”
The woman behind the counter, Alice, tells him that she doesn't have what he’s looking for, and sends him to a shop called
Of the boy who’s ass he constantly had to look after? Of the idiot with a scar he could never hide? He knows he should stop, Snape is going to have a row with him over this later, but he’s started and can’t stop now.
Draco can’t bring himself to tell the boy. Strange because it would be the perfect teasing material, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and this was one of them. Instead he focused his attention on Snape completing the lesson and doing something to someone’s toad. From the look on Longbottom’s face, it wasn’t hard to guess what happened.
“It is!” Harry holds his outfit out to her. “Look at this! It’s like they’re trying to make me a champion! And look at Cedric! He looks like a walking Hufflepuff sign! No offense, Cedric, but
“No I’m not.” Harry says before Hermione or worse, Ron, can tell him otherwise. “My goal here is to not die. I don’t want, or need to win. That’s your job.”
The thought of Lucius Malfoy, the dude who lost an arm last year, also known as his boyfriend’s father, penetrating his mind is eased very much by the fact that he has yet to penetrate the man’s son. Or be penetrated, they really should talk about it beforehand, maybe Draco will have read a book about it so it’s easier-
The smile so bright Sirius wants nothing more than to protect him and keep him from looking like the sad, helpless boy he had spoken to at the top of the Astronomy tower.
Harry grins at him, and then waves to Geia, speaking in something that doesn’t really sound like hissing, but Draco can’t understand it so he guesses it’s fine. They lock the door behind them and are almost to the bathroom where they’ll have to part ways when Harry stops him.
Dumbledore beats him to the infirmary and curses a storm he didn’t think the old man was capable of when he sees them.
Harry marvels at it for a minute, tracing the path of the snitch, admiring his stupid cat bookends that he’d gotten because they reminded him of LuLu, grinning at the photos from Pansy that have started collecting on his wall, the books that Hermione gave him, the poster of Quidditch gear that he and Ron laughed at because they were all mislabeled, his self writing quills from Blaise, and the necklace that Draco gave him last Christmas. He plops down on the bed that Sirius and Remus apparently made for him, rolls around on it until he spots the lamp that Narcissa bought for him because he liked the deep purple shade.
Lucius nods, already turning towards the tent to get dressed. They didn’t trust him enough to give him his wand back, and he understands why. He didn’t even miss it until this moment because it would be far more useful than Draco, who seems like he’s on the verge of a panic.
He’s so irritated he doesn’t even notice the baby Weasley until she’s glaring right back at him. “-he didn’t want any of that.”
He tries not to think about Blaise’s laugh and Pansy’s smile. About his mother’s exasperated sighs and his godfather's hidden humor.
“Blood on Draco’s jumper?” Millie asks, taking the seat on his right. “Why is there always blood on your jumpers?”
Blaise replies without missing a single beat, “Ronald, you once stole a car and got caught. Slytherins are the least of her worries.”
to reach out to them. He was never serious about killing himself, so they never came rushing in during his ‘grounding sessions’, but he dreaded the day they did. He’d have to open up then, Potions test or not.
Nothing like a nice bedtime story. Draco takes a deep gulp, already regretting asking the question, “Who was it?”
Snape sighs, and right before he can give any advice Lupin is stepping through his fireplace, “Sorry I’m a bit late, I know we agreed on noon but-oh. Hello, Draco.”
“You’re allowed to talk, you know. If anyone tells you not to talk unless spoken to I will personally rip them limb from limb.”
Draco flinches and it doesn’t go unnoticed. As if deciding to give his son something to actually be afraid of, Lucius raises his hand and backhands him so hard he falls.
They go back to working in a comfortable silence, but there is a new heavy weight on Draco’s chest. On the plus side, now he knows for certain that he’s not the only one worried grey about the sleeping boy in front of them.
He groans, sitting up slowly and glancing at Draco through very squinted eyes. “Ron? Why are you wearing a blonde wig? I swear if this is some type of fucked up joke I’m gonna-”
“Thank you,” Harry huffs, “I was looking to see if Black was anywhere, because contrary to your personal beliefs, I
Remus winks at him, “Don’t tell anyone, okay? But the strength is rather nice, it was especially useful during renovations.”
“Harry,” the name feels weird with no malice to it, but Draco kind of likes it, “Why were you out so late?”
She’s sitting in a chair that’s definitely never seen the dungeons before, Sisily beside her and urging her to drink her tea. Tears stream down her face and when she sees him she stands so quickly Sisily almost drops the fine china.
“Harry James Potter.” Draco says, but his hair is dying down so whatever threat he intended to have is long gone.  “Honestly, I should put wards on you, shouldn’t I?” He mumbles a few spells and Harry’s face feels loads better. Draco kisses him on the cheek, then pulls back to glare at Sirius.
Ellios smiles again, all light and happy. William doesn’t look pleased in the slightest. “I am taking a job here next year, my classroom began preparations at the beginning of the year,” So they're the reason for Hermione’s beginning of the year anger….interesting. “If you do not wish to take my class, I can extend office hours to you.”
The Halloween fest lasts all day long for Slytherins, as they pick the day to be particularly cunning and dark. Everything from sneaking hexes into people’s food to scaring each other with silly tricks. In the morning he gets both Crabbe and Goyle with a few smoke bombs at the ends of their beds, they both pout the whole way to breakfast, but their reactions had been funny enough for Draco not to care. Flint almost gets him with a spell on his toast, no one would expect someone to like eating something sour, but this is Draco afterall. Pansy has the same idea as he does, both starling themselves before bursting into laughter at the cards nearly written word for word the same.
They stare for a long time as Draco recovers his breathing, and then his godfather helps him up and leads them to the room he was aiming for the first time. Snape brews tea in silence, seeming to note that the boy needs at least five minutes to collect himself before he can speak. Once the tea is poured and served, both plain because they both enjoy the taste of the leaves themselves, he raises one bushy black eyebrow.
They burst into a bit of chuckling and Draco hopes Blaise can’t tell his isn’t real. Is Potter okay? Even a mistaken death prediction can fuck someone up mentally, it’s never a fun experience, and fucking
Draco howls with laughter as Pansy recounts that she got Percy Weasley with a surprise she left in Potions class, Snape had come and told her the experience was quite enjoyable.
“The Dark Lord placed a sort of spell on him, a form of the Imperius Curse, but one that brings up past memories so the person in question has no idea of the reality around them until much later. It is meant to confuse and torture the effected’s mind to insanity. Severus says it’s called
Draco glares at him, but ScarFace has a point. They couldn’t avoid each other now, no matter how badly he wanted to. Plus, a Malfoy never goes back on a promise. At least not directly.
That might have something to do with the way Narcissa’s magic has turned from violent to down right murderous.
Draco nods, like the good boy he is, and makes his way back to the common room, fully intending to read a book and go to bed, and then a voice he
The world takes a second to gather around him. No light comes in through the dungeon walls, which makes it that much harder to focus. He can breathe this time, an improvement. A majority of his roommates are asleep, curtains drawn with a spell or two to keep them out. His are also shut, but knowing that his apparent captain stands behind them is enough for Draco to sit up and throw them open.
Blaise chuckles, “I’m personally looking forward to finally knowing where he sneaks off to every night. I feel like a worried father.”
“When I said that I didn’t think you’d be stupid enough to sign us up for a friendly clash with venomous teeth! We could die doing this, and-”
Madam Hooch blows her whistle once more and they’re airborne, his eyes desperately searching. Naturally, because he is also stupid, he finds himself drawn to the other Seeker turning with just enough time for the Bludger to miss his head.
Weasley scowls at them, his face a very unattractive blotchy purple that isn’t doing anything for his freckles. Granger looks a little less insulted, but her eyes are guarded. She shifts her gaze between them like she’s trying to think of the worst that could happen and that’s exactly what Draco’s doing. At least she’s not likely to hex them without provoking on their part. Harry just tries to smile, but it comes out forced and wary. The two sets of three glare and size each other up until Granger huffs and steps forward, sticking her hand out for Draco to shake.
It’s a stranger hissing sound, words are definitely underneath it, but he can’t make out what it is. Polly, however, does. Turning to look past Draco right at Harry fucking Potter, still speaking in the errie hissing voice.
He doesn’t? That’s cool. But, to be fair, that’s probably because of Ra. Should he tell her that? Is it really important?
“I haven’t the faintest clue what you’re on about, love.” Lucius bristles, “I just want to know how our son’s final days of school went.”
Potter is lying face up on the ground, eyes closed and mouth open, and Draco, for once in his life, can’t think of anything worse.
“It’s my vault. My family vault, I mean. Apparently it’s locked until I’m seventeen, so all this ancestry stuff doesn’t really make any sense, and I really just need thirty minutes inside to peek around and see if I can find a journal.”
“But you said yourself that Hogwarts can’t be breached….please stop hiding things from me, Headmaster. You see where that’s gotten Malfoy…”
Sirius is across the room before Draco can blink. Fist in Snape’s robes, hand rearing back to strike. Not a thought crosses his mind before he’s freezing the man in place and throwing him back.
Theo nods and slinks away like a defeated puppy, not that it matters to Draco. He’s a little busy following Cedric to a deserted hallway.
They keep talking over each other and Draco’s head is starting to flare up so he rolls his eyes and yells “Oh for
The first had been when he was young, too tiny to remember, really, and he’d apparently made fried pea-cock when one of the creatures tried to peck him. The first time he remembers them is when he, Goyle, and Crabbe had been playing. He remembered being angry because Goyle had the
“Can’t we just skip? I know you don’t actually like Ancient Ruins, and I can think of many better things to do than pretend to listen in Herbology.”
not Lucius, not ‘father’ none of that distant-ensuring bullshit. Just dad, complaining about Sirius’s bad alcohol.
And the next day Hermione sends out their end of the year study schedules, he has no idea what the final task will be, and he’s busy with living life in the present, so Harry makes a promise.
It’s the next Tuesday when he finally notices something weird. Pansy is knee-deep in her portfolio final and Blaise is drowning in his extra projects, so they both squirm out of coming. Weasley is nowhere to be found in their new secret room, but Harry and Granger are both there.
Lucius is strong, even if he is crazy. He could overtake her and do to her what he’d done to Draco over break. Excuse him if he doesn’t fancy the idea of his mother being beaten.
Draco sighs, casting one final look to the tables before shrugging and sinking down into the mounds of pillows that Harry carefully arranged. “I’m only agreeing to this because you nearly died a few days ago, but one day the novelty of that is going to wear off.”
So Draco goes bounding to them, running smack into Hermione who screams, and then hugs the air out of him the second she realizes who it is.
And with that the Phoenix is gone, sorting hat yelling out into the night and Draco can only hope they make it in time. He runs back down to Snape. “Is there any way we can watch Potter? In the pensive?”
Hi! Fair warning, this chapter is through Harry's pov and the next chapter is going to start off with Draco's opinion of the week. It's not gonna be a repeat of classes and all that, but it'll highlight things he thinks about verses what Harry focuses on. Anyways, here's to giving Umbridge hell!
safe. I need to know all of it, Draco. No more lies, no more secrets. If this is going to work, we both need to be completely honest with each other. I need to know who you trust, where your alliance is. Please.”
Maybe he’ll just smother himself with a pillow. It really would deal with a majority of his problems. His dad couldn’t ‘train’ him if he were dead, he couldn’t provoke Potter if he were dead, he could even stop worrying the people he cared about. Perhaps that’s a topic for another time, one where Weasley didn’t just ask a question he answers without his brain, and only Salazar knew where it had gone.
He hasn’t thought about them since he went into Azkaban, and now he’s stuck as Theo tells him all about Astoria’s new orphanage and Daphne’s mind healer apprenticeship. Though a joint effort, the girls have been aiding every last magical soul to lose a parent in the war. It took a month of planning, and would’ve taken longer if it weren’t for one Hermione Granger using her pull in the Ministry
Pansy’s death grip on his hand is starting to hurt but it’s nothing compared to the grip Blaise has. Narcissa suddenly looks tired, worn down, afraid.
we're almost at the end, and then the next fic is where i'm mostly going off rails because Fleur deserves to be more than a pretty face
“But that soup is being orange, and this soup is being….” She holds up a spoonful, watching the unidentified brown liquid splash back into her bowl.
The team snorts at that, Adrian Pucey actually ruffles his hair. “Don’t you know that’s all they're good for? Haven’t got half the brain that Filch does, and that’s saying something.”
“I’m serious, Draco, next semester Pans and I are studying with you, dammit! It’s not fair for you to get all Os while your friends struggle!”
“Because if that’s the case,” Draco can’t stop himself from smirking. “You could always take Myrtle.”
He probably shouldn’t have said anything, but Lupin just looks at him like he’s lost his mind. “What
Severus clears his throat and takes Draco’s hand. “The sooner this is over, the sooner you are free to indulge.”
Great. Now he just has to explain to his friends how they’re going to be healing a giant snake that tried to kill them.
He recognizes the voice as Dumbledore and almost sighs in relief. If anyone could help him now it would be the headmaster.
Draco smiles at him, there’s snarling behind them but Sirius isn’t in his line of sight so hopefully he’s the reason they all haven’t turned into mince meat. “You need to get out of here.” He manages.
against his lovely floors, the delicate handles curve in the prettiest way, and the ‘walls’ are made of iron flower sculptures that dance all the way up.
Narcissa turns to face him, “You’ve had the whole summer to celebrate! Taking him for a day is nothing, I
I managed to get promoted? and they're offering me the pay for the job i was considering going to an interview for, which is perfect because i can now move out of my not-so-great house and it'll be wonderful.
As nice as that is, Harry is going to be facing a fucking Dragon in a few days and he doesn’t have a fucking carriage.
friends. The idiots who’ve been with him since third year, badly joking about hexing him even though they snarl in the faces of people who insult him.
“Father has them in a room in our house and when he was too busy to hurt me himself he would stick me in there and leave me for hours on end.” Draco shakes his head, glaring at the man in front of him, “Why do you care?!”
It’s the first on his list for ‘tomorrow’ since they haven’t had real food in two weeks and his body is starting to fail him. Spells can only do so much, and Misty enjoys cooking.
makes Draco snap his head up. “You’re business is the liquor store? The one with the guy who doesn’t like me?”
“Your mother sent us here to check on you...she gave us a letter, but we didn’t want to intrude.” Blaise mummers.
Narcissa said they weren’t safe, that they refused to even think of purebloods who don’t support the cause.
worrying me sick?!” Pansy throws her arms around his neck. That part isn’t all surprising, but Hermione grabbing his face so she can inspect his face is.
Blaise takes a deep breath, “We started remembering how weird you were being about things. Like how when you did get a letter from him, you always looked so frightened.”
He’s thankful when they link arms with him and turn them away, even if he does feel guilt clawing up his throat when he hears crows flying away after the ax swings.
been excited about being home, even when we were kids and you would come to visit, you always just wanted to be at your manor.”
Fucking Gryffindors and their damned morals. Fucking Harry and his need to save the world. Fucking green eyes that he’s never been able to say ‘no’ to. They’re the whole reason he got into this mess, well, that and his own need to save the world.
anyways, i hope that explained it enough. if you have any questions let me know in the comments and i'll answer most of them. already working on the next chapter, wish me luck! <3 you all, be safe
He knows Narcissa told him not to kiss her husband, but he deserves a kiss for that. A full, snog-you-breathless kiss. Sirius only hopes a bottle of wine and one of Remus’s chocolate cakes will do.
The light fixtures he wasn’t too sure on. Back at the Manor it was all chandeliers and wall sconces, but looking at those makes Draco feel like he’s going to puke, so he ends up getting three circular, copper, hanging pendant lights.
“Yes,” Snape nods, “You see, I assume you know about the bloody Marauders, but you haven’t been told about a relationship that existed within that little group. It was kept very secret, little people know about it, and I am one of those few. Sirius Black is more to some people than they let on.”
“That Peter Weasley…”he mutters. What an odd thing to see, someone not Slytherin in the dungeons, very suspicious…
Draco knows it’s stupid, but he has a wand and his father doesn’t, so really, how stupid can it be? He looks around at the scared group of teenagers, and then at Potter who seems to be forming a plan. Draco locks eyes with his father.
a blanket he didn’t really need, a set of copper cookware, and a few odds and ends to really make the kitchen feel less...empty.
Snape opens his mouth right as Dumbledore rises, silencing them both. “That is quite enough, Draco has a point, Severus. I believe you and I must speak with the rest of the staff about this occurrence. Draco, would you watch over Harry until I can return?”
do you think you’re doing here? Have you any self preservation?! And you-” he turns those fearful eyes on Lupin, “I’ve just made my peace with you and now you’re endangering
“Ah!” Lupin smiles at him, “I thought you’d never show up! Don’t worry, Dumbledore’s told me everything-”
“Hey,” Draco shrugs, “It’s not being mauled by a werewolf in front of your deranged criminal cousin.”
“I think he is? I’m not really sure, actually. Slytherins are good liars, and while I’ve always been able to tell, he did give himself a loophole.”
Ignoring that fact that Potter’s room was ransacked and the diary stolen, Draco is having a good week. He and Blaise matched class schedules for the next year, same with Crabbe and Goyle. Pansy managed to score an art class, something they’d talked about all week long, and with Flint it had been non stop Quidditch. New tactics, were they going to face Gryffindor again? How to make his broom go faster. The minister hasn’t shown yet, but he can feel it coming. It’s in the back of his mind every step he takes, one of the many reasons he’s trekking it to the library instead of the match. That and a last-minute charms assignment.
He doesn’t speak again until five minutes after the antidote is taken, and even that is just to tell the headmaster that he hopes his day improves. Then he takes LuLu and all but runs out the door, only pausing to put on the easiest façade he can muster, arrogance a little too difficult and feeling too shaken up to go for spiteful, he settles on confidence and strides into the classroom a full ten minutes late.
“Harry?” Remus asks. His voice is much too gentle for this house, it seems almost as out of place as his perfectly fitting suit.
He can see the sunset streaming in from the windows, and Remus looks stunning in the golden glow. Everything is suddenly perfect. Talking quietly through kisses, swaying to the beat neither of them know. Half of him expects Lily to walk in and demand to know what’s taking so long, only to squeal. He can see James rushing in and then laughing, pulling her in for a dance so the four of them can sway together like they did at the school balls. They’d switch partners like they always did and dinner would end up a little burned but no one ever minded. Peter would join them later, fussing about how long it took to get here, or how Lily should be more careful not to hurt the baby in her stomach.
A plush white rug for underneath his dining table, a set of crystal dishes and cups from a flea market. On his trip to the thrift store, which had once been his, Pansy, and Blaise’s favorite muggle thing to do, he finds
Draco grins, “I dunno why it occurred to me, but white strawberries are very good, I wanted to share.”
side!” There’s no malice behind his words, and the smile really dampens the whining effect, but it makes Draco laugh. Blaise does a weak impression of it that has them all snickering and for a moment he can breathe easily.
Narcissa’s smile is only a little crazed, “Correct! You’ve always been so clever, dear, and since we’ve deduced that the mothers in the room know about their children’s little contract, don’t you think it would be smart to tell us why the contract was produced in the first place?”
Not that Dumbledore wouldn’t have told them the truth. Harry had given them a basic idea, and the old coot had told them
Quidditch starts up and Draco’s thrilled to see Flint and the crew again, easily sharing laughs and diving head first into training sessions to beat the unbeatable Potter. The practices are long and grueling, but worth every moment. His cut stops him from playing and dear Merlin had
“It’s just,” Fuck he’s really weak for Harry’s eyes tonight, maybe he didn’t get enough sleep. “Think about it, Draco. She’s been in that room since the founders, right? And after Salazar left, she was alone until Riddle. She hasn’t had a friend in so long, she’s been forced to stay in one area and she’s suffering.”
Lucius felt his heart squeeze at the sight, but the pain in his arm was starting to worsen. “Stay here, I’ll be right back.”
He makes her stand in the clearing, as close to the edge as he can stand. She swears that she’s fine, that there are stairs leading down to a small beach area that will catch her if all else fails, but the stairs are more broken than the ones inside had been and Draco isn’t fucking risking it. He casts three perfect fireballs to surround her, cuts her hand and tells her to wait for his mark.
Draco rolls his eyes, they sound like him with Potter. Really? Don’t they realize how overprotective they’re being? He bids them goodnight, tasking Crabbe and Goyle to look after them, and sneaks out of the Great Hall behind Snape.
to step on that field and be held to a standard so high you can’t even imagine it. Fleur Delacour is an
Green eyes are pleading with him to just drop it, which he isn’t going to do, and then something mildly alarming happens. Harry’s eyes clear and he sighs. “Can we talk about this somewhere that doesn’t make me want to hyperventilate?”
“Sir, if Riddle was the last person to open it, would it be right to assume he’s done it again? Or,” he takes a deep breath, knowing exactly how what he says next will sound, “Or someone with a close connection to him?”
Crouch has suddenly remembered the value of silence as his elf is carried out and laid at his feet, but something about it doesn’t sit right with him. Winky had been terrified of the fighting, she had been trying to get away.
There’s a nasty habit some people have of hating others. They sit in their heads, unbothered by pleas for mercy and cries for help, hating that they’re being bothered. They moan and complain, refusing to lift a finger, taunting those who need aid, never wondering what it’s like to be filled to the brim with something that burns a bit brighter than hate.
Potter is sleeping when he enters, face distorted in pain and beginning to bruise from the fall, broken glasses sitting on the table beside his bed. Draco sighs and grabs his wand from beneath his robes, muttering ‘oculus reparo’ and watching the poor things pop back to a normal shape. Then he turns his wand to Potter’s face. A flick of the wrist and a ‘lenio’ later and Potter’s brow relaxes. Fool really should get better about taking his potions, which reminds Draco that he has his own to take now.
Most of them couldn’t move even if they wanted to, all paralyzed with fear because fur is starting to spout on Lupin’s back, but Draco’s pretty sure he isn’t doing this willingly. No one screams in pain when they’re willing. Harry tries to step around him and move towards the changing beast, but Draco can’t let him. He fights the boy back, somehow ending up the closest to the werewolf he can’t see standing behind him.
“I understand that mistake of an existence, Hagrid, has not been punished for the wound he inflicted on your arm…”
Kingsley sighs for a third time, must be a new record. “Sunday, Draco. I mean it. Tell Misty it was lovely to meet her.”
Life fades out of the trees, the pixies fade, replaced by humans who scream and then become stone at the Blue Basilisk's word.
Men, for one, don’t have vaginas. Just bouts of insanity, rage, and all consuming one-mindedness. And Draco, as he is a man, can handle just about all of those. In fact, as a survivor of the Dark Lord, as Carla insists he calls it, Draco even considers himself an
Pansy bites her lips but still is forced to say, “Because he’s-” Blaise snaps a hand over her mouth, meaning his is useless.
“How long has he been out there?” A different voice whispers. Lighter, friendly, comforting. He knows the voices, if only he could place them.
“I don’t!” He snaps, picking LuLu up and holding her back from her weird love fest with Potter’s jeans. “LuLu is a Kneazle, and a fine one at that, now if you’ll excuse us, we have important places to be!”
Then he has to go out and put lights up, begin chilling the wine, wash his hands again, finish food.
Draco’s spell hits the boy straight in the chest. Potter stumbles back, and he has half the mind to hex him again, the first time sent shivers down his spine.
Myrtle buys every single line like Dudley at a bake sale. She literally melts into a puddle at Draco’s feet, swooning complete with heart eyes, looking like she’s seen some deity, and Harry’s one creepy comment away from snagging Slytherin robes and finding a different place altogether.
and his dad was an abusive prick so Harry knows the boy is hurting and wants to say something comforting, but a blonde is turning him around with a squeal before he can. She’s stunning. Tall and thin, yet strong muscles poking out beneath her perfectly pressed outfit. Not a strand of that silver blonde hair is out of place despite the humidity.
not fond of his boss being younger than him. At least he’s thankful that he’s not dealing with my father anymore.”
tells him it’s only eleven thirty, the ocean won’t be at high tide until midnight, but Misty is nervous so he lugs himself off the floor and leads her to the cliff.
hi! this chapter kinda gives you a better idea about the relationship between Draco and the others. Also I thought my little evil baby deserved actual friends
He’s not surprised in the least to find Hermione outside with her arms piled high. There’s no one else in the hallway, but they don’t talk. Draco does, however, follow her back to the Gang’s Room.
Clean but lived in. A mix of things from people that care for him and things he’d chosen. Entirely, and utterly his.
They both freeze, looking at her with wide eyes but her smile only widens. Not in the threatening way they’re both so used to, just warm and happy.
Blaise pushes past them, following the other Slytherins into the common room and making a beeline for the open couch by the fire. “How big is your family now anyways, Draco?”
Fields of fresh flowers, giant snakes flying into purple nests up in the tops of trees that shine in the sunlight. Geia, young and half her size, chasing a blue dragon-looking snake through snow fields. The same snake, tall and dangerous, glistening wings like the night sky stretching out as she speaks to thousands of snakes before her. Geia flying with the dragons, taking baths in springs surrounded by glowing plants. Playing hide and seek with pixies and flying up to ask the trees if she could rest on their branches.
Draco doesn’t know how to respond, so he splashes water at her. Pansy, of course, splashes them right back, which is how Theo and Blaise find them, in the middle of a war.
“The point, Potter, is that you’re right. And I don’t say that often, Merlin usually I’m cursing every decision and word you say but I’ve put a lot of thought into this and had at least three people trying to talk me into it.” He takes a deep breath, “See, at first I couldn’t be your friend because you didn’t know and it’s dangerous for you to know. My purpose is to keep you safe from danger, so keeping you far away from me was a pretty good plan until….well until you got it in your head to be friends. And sure, I had thought about it before because your friends always manage to get you into bizarre situations so maybe if I had a say in things you’d be safe, but I still thought it was too much to hope for. “
Helga turns to him in her fury and decides he really is her target so Harry makes what might be the dumbest decision in his long list of them. He waits until the moment is right and then jumps, the golden egg tucked securely in his left arm while his right arm reaches out. He grabs onto one of her scales, barely making it to her neck before she’s aiming for the sky.
Fuck becoming an Arour if he managed to defeat Moldy Old Riddle, he was going to be a professional Quidditch player purely for the fucking stadium.
Hermione huffs from her and Pansy’s side of Draco’s ridiculously big bedroom. “We have. Several times actually.”
Theo finds him the next morning when he’s reading. Sunlight streams through the curtains in his little canopy out in the back, blanketing him in an early morning glow. The ocean is calm today. Breezes drape over his shoulder, lazily sending the smell of the sea to mix with his morning coffee.
Harry goes jogging to him, but Krum just waves off his fellow Durmstrangs and walks calmly until they meet.
Harry gets to experience love, from family that he has now, friends that he never expected to make, and the biggest asshole that always makes him warm. He gets to feel happiness, but only if the world’s biggest killer comes with the little joy that’s filling his life.
He spots Krum as he’s heading to lunch, stopping mid-conversation about anti-fire charms to shout “Krum! Hey! Krum!”
Hermione arrives first the following morning. She barely tells Remus and Sirius ‘hello’ before she’s hugging him and ranting about child abuse laws that the ministry doesn’t bother with and how she ought to have the Dursleys thrown in muggle prison because she knows those laws too. Her onslaught is stopped only by the arrival of the Weasleys because if Ron gets to visit then everyone else does.
His first instinct was to rush towards Potter, but one look up and he freezes. Lucius was watching. He couldn’t run and pretend to be concerned about a classmate with him here, instead he sped off to Madam Hooch, “Potter broke his arm, one of the Bludgers kept coming after him, I don’t know why but I know it got him good.” is all he manages to rush out before zipping back to his team. They watch, completely confused as Lockheart marches over to Potter, even from where he stands Draco can hear his fallen nuisance moan ‘Oh, no, not you.’
like being in danger, but I saw a name on the map that struck me as odd because the map doesn’t lie, but the person in question is known to be dead.”
“And while you were getting hurt?” Blaise asks in that steely voice that lets Draco know just how  badly he fucked up. “The issue here is no longer your secret keeping, we understand why you had to do that now, but rather in the fact that you keep putting yourself in harm's way. You complain about Harry, but you do the exact same thing.”
He’s thought about the possibilities before, but now he was sure it was his only future. See, he couldn’t claw his eyes out because a spy with no eyes was rather useless, same with all his other bodily features. He needs his legs to run, arms to hold his wand, lips to talk, so really his hair is all he has left.
Harry smiles at him as though he can see right through him. Lupin’s frown lessens so he guesses he’s doing okay at the whole ‘being nice’ thing his friends all thought was so important.
“Fine, fine. You may think this is a set back, but really, I’m excited. It’s been ages since I’ve seen our dear friend Padfoot, and I’m quite looking forward to our time together.”
“Of course I did! And since I’m now making Fleur’s dress, I offered to make Luna’s. Now I know what you’re thinking, ‘Pansy, you just finished exams and making outfits for our entire group, now you’re adding two more dresses?’ And the answer, my dear idiots, is yes. But not just two dresses, no, I have bigger aspirations than that.”
She returns the twinkle in his eyes, and it’s then that Draco notices she has something hidden behind her back. “Do you remember how I promised you two surprises in Diagon Alley?”
Embarrassing him even further, LuLu completely and utterly disregards him, cosying up to Potter and purring while she rubs against his legs. Behind him, Pansy and Blaise stiffen. It’s not hard to imagine why, after all, here is LuLu, some magical protector and judge for her master, budding up with his sworn enemy. To make matters worse, Granger squeals with delight.
“You mean like a time tuner that’s been with us all along or a sword that literally appears out of nowhere?”
she probably understands them better than he cares to. “Dobby, meet Miss Hermione Granger. Hermione Granger, meet Dobby.”
“This has to be the first time he’s slept in the past two weeks,” Hermione mumbles, rubbing her eyes and yawning a bit.
“I’ve seen this before, it’s the look of a prisoner from Azkaban. His father must have put him in the Dementor room again….”
Because his day hasn’t been awful enough, Lockheart also decides to release Cornish Pixies, just for the fun of seeing his students terrorized with no way for him to stop it. Draco would make a comment about this, but he’s a little preoccupied with Crabbe and Goyle forcing him out of the room. He can’t wait to fall into bed tonight.
The first was when he accidentally destroyed Belle’s evening gown, and the only reason he lived through it was because Pansy had been wanting to make a dress anyways, and Blaise is by no means a coward, it’s just that no one fancies dying at the ripe age of eight. Second was when he and Pansy had thought Draco was going to get himself killed, and yes it’s over protective but if one of them had been sneaking around the castle while a giant murderous beast was on the loose, well, he honestly would’ve done the same thing. Blaise isn’t nearly as crazy as his mother is about his safety, but no one wants to see their friends killed by their own stupid actions. The third and last time Blaise had been scared was when Narcissa told them that Riddle is back, but by fuck everyone should be scared of that.
“Please. We both know that wound didn’t come from Buckbeak,” Potter replies easily, never looking up from cutting annoyingly perfect roots.
That and it was time for his afternoon session with the Cruciatus Curse. And the matching dagger that left a ghastly gash across his forearm.
“A request, though one might find it a bit imposing now.” Dumbledore frowns, “I originally requested to speak with you about your house.”
“Alright there Scar Face?” He calls out against his better judgement. Potter rolls his eyes, barely escaping the Bludger coming at him. Draco decides to ignore it and not scream about him being a mindless idiot in favor of looking for the Snitch, flying around in hopes of catching the stupid thing.
They all watched her come back to herself once the spell was broken, they all saw the horror on her face when she saw the Dark Mark in the sky, they all heard her panicked cries. And yet no one treated her with an ounce of kindness and for some reason that pissed him the fuck off.
good at this spell. McGonagll never liked it when he suddenly appeared cleaner than he was upon arrival, but she never said anything.
Draco glares at him, glares at his own, admittedly, almost attractive reflection in the mirror, and then sighs.
They’re returning from an afternoon of water magic when he sees her. Leaning against the rails in a pale green sundress, hair blowing in the wind, Sisily by her side with a wide smile.
“Pathetic. You’re becoming more and more like a disgrace everyday. The Dark Lord will be among us shortly, you better hope he comes soon, or you and I will have some training to do.”
Lucius Malfoy, here, at the school. There truly was no way for Draco to escape him. Nothing he could do or say, he couldn’t even step one toe out of line. That would be hell.
Draco opens his mouth to protest, to tell them that Polly is a dear friend and he doesn’t wish to see her harmed, after all he would have to see her at the manor and preferred to
He rolls his eyes but grins anyways, Potter is gazing at him with wide eyes, how could he not smile at that?
Draco looks around, did Snape get more decorations? There’s more potions, a lovely vase of lilies, a new chair? “Professor, when did you get this chair? I haven’t seen it here before.”
Chang, Finnegan, Thomas and Greg stopped coming after the first day. On the second day the search party lost the Greengrass sisters.
Hermione and Ron are both seconds away from a heart attack, he’s sure, but he waves them on and smiles at Fleur again. At least this time she’s slightly amused and not dead-seat on hitting him.
Draco has to bite back a scathing comment about how well his Crabbe and Goyle impression had been. He literally chomps down on his tongue before rolling his eyes and crossing his arms. “Is that why you dragged me in here? To gloat about your shitty impression of my friends?”
mood because his mum wouldn’t let him tailor his clothes and Pansy hadn’t been much happier because she wasn’t allowed to hex her annoying teachers. Narcissa picked him up at noon, promising to go home and have tea with Lucius, and Draco had nearly cried tears of joy.
been a conversation. He’d been forced to show Flint the wound that never really stopped bleeding and then gotten the most awkward talking to of his life, buy his captain no less.
Pansy brings lemon tarts with her, Blaise changes in a different room and then they’re all in pajamas, laying on Draco’s king sized bed, eating tarts and watching some book Blaise brought that no one is really paying attention to. LuLu works her way into the middle of Pansy and Draco, curling up in a small ball like always. A small hand cards through his hair, a big hand rubs his back, a ball of warmth purs on his stomach.
“So, Mother Ocean, after the first few millennia of Magical Creatures, realized that too many things were being born and she couldn’t keep up with them. Too many creatures needed too much of her, the land was beginning to ruin her own creatures that had begun to evolve inside her, and so she split into nine seas, and in turn had nine children. The first was Kaṟupp, Ruler of the Black sea, Father to Rallam, King of the Black Sea. That is the king you met today, Harry you absolute dumbass.”
to him, but the boggart’s briefcase is opening and Harry shouts the spell so powerfully he can honestly call Draco whatever the hell he wants to. A glowing doe forces the thing back, and he shouldn’t be, but he’s just as proud as Lupin.
“And you’ll get it.” Sirius says calmly. “Under a few conditions. Tomorrow morning the papers with my cleared name will drop, I will adopt Harry and you won’t say a single word about it. When you hold order meetings, Narcissa, Lucius, and Belle will be invited. In addition, Harry and Draco will sit in on the meetings, keep your hair down, Narcissa. Harry is bound to be in the middle of whatever mess Riddle stirs up, and wherever Harry goes Draco typically is there to protect him anyways. Not informing them would just put them more at risk, and I refuse to make Harry hide in his own house.”
Narcissa looks around the room, and then to all their growing concerns, casts several spells Draco knows are meant to keep voices from listening. Like locking them all in the tiny room and not letting a single syllable out.
Sirius and Remus, obviously. They’d give up everything for him, and Harry wants their happiness so bad it hurts. He wants them to frolic in the sun, prank the way they used to, smile without a ghost behind it.
Harry smiles, letting Kreecher take his things. “Yep. I thought some down time might be nice. Have you made breakfast yet?”
“Either way…” Draco grimaces at his soaked feet, “Someone should let the teachers know, I’ll go tell Snape and meet you in the Great Hall.”
Pansy giggles, “Honestly, Draco, if you wanted some private time with Blaise you’ll just have to wait.”
hi, so I planned on posting this a hot minute ago and then I got sick, had a job interview, had to go look at apartments, and managed to get sun poisoning so how are you all? I am low-key dying. And because this is so long, literally fifteen pages, I decided to cut it in half. I'm also gonna link the pintrest links in the next chapter because I don't want to spoil anything for the dresses, also I'm very excited because next chapter there's nothing to distract me, no pre-anything, no Christmas to worry about, all ball and fun and hopefully nothing else dramatic will happen and I can get it out in a reasonable time.
He’s around three seconds away from punching Potter in his smart mouth but the brat turns around and walks away, leaving him fuming and glaring at empty walls.
“Don’t touch them yet. At ten Pansy will take away their papers and I’ll steer Draco to the showers and to bed.”
Granted, if he does go a bit overboard, it’s because Fleur is having her revenge on Draco not-so-accidently announcing her secret relationship. Yeah, he brought it on himself, but that doesn't mean he has to
She goes on to tell him that since they’ve promised to do so many things ‘tomorrow’ that a list is necessary so they don’t forget, which means she will most definitely be holding Draco to every single promise and Draco kinda wishes he’d pitched himself off the cliff on his first day in Scotland.
and he can see the papers haven’t exactly been nice about it. ‘Pretty Witch Or Ugly Monster?’ written by Rita Seeker and backed up by bigoted children who have no idea what they’re talking about. At least she was singing Harry’s praises instead of calling him a siren, Blaise would have a fit...much like Fleur is probably doing.
They both freeze, taking in a very deep breath. Draco makes an effort to count backwards from ten before he meets a stone cold
“No,” he admits, “I can’t find the right way to tell them about Harry, I’ve gotten so good at changing the truth that I don’t think I can ever tell the full truth again.”
And then the summer of seventh year happened and routine turned into habits he needed for survival. He spent
The four of them make their way to the drawing room and settle in the ugly chairs Sirius swears he’s going to burn one day.
The two don’t speak until they reach Snape’s office, are inside the door, and have tea in their hands. Only then does the Potions Master’s facade crack.
Harry leans back into him. He has to admit, while the bed is a little on the huge side, even for the two of them, the sheets and fifty pillows are wildly comfortable. Almost as comfortable as lying on Draco, or having Draco lie on him. Either way he’s not upset with their situation.
Clmex! Adiuva me! Noli ridens, hoc est non ridiculam!: Assholes! Help me out! Stop laughing, this isn't funny!
“I mean,” Draco looks to Severus, who nods, “I’m always happy to grow, but when would we start? How would we do it?”
Draco flinches back without meaning to. Of course he knows that, he’d been under two of them, he’d seen what mind control curses can do to people, his father is still recovering and Draco seriously doubts that he’ll ever get over it. The first time he hurt his Torture Pixie was when he was under Impero, and the only reason he didn’t fight harder was because of the Crucius Hour he endured beforehand.
He looks up to see two pairs of eyes looking at him, and he takes a deep breath. “The diary, sir...this summer my father, I mean, he found this diary and went on about it for weeks. He said it belonged to some Tom Riddle person, but I didn’t know who it was, I thought it was just dark magic and-”
Draco groans, rolls until his face is completely in his pillow so he doesn’t have to deal with their smiling faces. The past week has been quite possibly the longest week of his life.
There’s a little creek and light floods his cupboard. He squints a little, the light really is blinding, but even more blinding is the happiness that comes from seeing Remus’s face.
“Right…” Dumbledore pops a yellow orb into his own mouth, and while he does refrain from verbally offering Draco a chair, he does point to one. Draco sits, but only because he’s sure that this is going to be another long conversation where he gets no real answers.
The boy is small, maybe eleven, wearing a toga with scuffed up knees and a staff in his hand. His hair is dark, his skin is tan, and his eyes widen at the sight of Geia.
“Okay.” Luna says with a smile, and that doesn’t give him the greatest feeling. Luna is cool and all, but sometimes Harry feels like she knows more than she’s supposed to. It’s a little frightening if he’s honest.
He pushes his way to the front of the crowd, shoving until he has a clear view of the wall and the threat written on it in fresh blood.
They’re out of the shower, he has no idea how or why they got back into the room, but they’re here. LuLu’s glaring at Blaise,
“Yeah, Sev and I are good.” Draco mumbles. He registers Blaise politely asking them to ‘shut the fuck up’, but he might be imaging things.
Draco watches them go, old man practically pushes Snape out against his will. Then he turns his attention on Potter, still trying to accept that he’s here, he’s safe, and he’s just sleeping. It’s kind of hard when the boy sleeps like the dead and hasn’t even shifted. Merlin, people who sleep with no trouble make him sick. Honestly! Look at Potter, all resting and cozy under his blanket while Draco is pacing back and forth at foot of his stupid bed. Where did he get off on a good night's sleep? Is this how he always manages to get out of impossible situations alive? Was sleep really all that powerful? Maybe Draco would have to test it out after he got done jumping five feet into the air because Potter finally made a noise.
As if feeling the panic growing, Fawkes burrows into his arms. Quiet stretches between them, each lost in a different train of thought. If the chamber is opened...someone will die...and that someone might be Potter, the only chance they have against the Dark Lord. And if there is an even bigger possibility that Hogwarts will shut down, that means there’s a chance he will have to return to the manor, where Dumbledore cannot protect him. Bleaker than this morning, Draco meets the headmaster’s eyes. He’s rewarded with a kind smile and another nuzzle from the Phoenix in his arms.
They’ve all gathered in the Gang’s Room for another dance practice. The Yule Ball is three weeks away, but next week is Exam Week and Draco and Hermione originally met up to study, yet somehow here they are. Quizzing each other while waltzing.
Potter looks at him like he’d just insulted the man's unborn children. “I don’t want any of that! I wasn’t going to tell anyone anyways, no one would believe me. I just want to know why.”
So, he’s a bit strange, and is definitely worse off than Harry in the parent department, but he’s also kind and unbelievably funny. Smart, like at least as smart as Hermione and athletic as hell...not to mention the weird feeling he has when he tells them about Draco leaning on Blaise’s shoulder like it was the most natural thing in the world. He can’t put words to it but it definitely didn’t feel
“Your selective listening is worse than mine, dear. Come along, I’ll explain your training over breakfast.”
Narcissa nods approvingly, “You’re correct, Pansy dear, so there are some things to fill out. Firstly, Draco, your father is recovering right now from the removal. It was painful, and he has suffered, but Snape and a few….friendly people managed to rid him of the flower.”
He clues in with the rest of the team, holding out their broomsticks as Flint continues to take charge, keeping up an air that only Slytherins could produce. Proud, probably obnoxious, definitely pompous, and in every way the perfect deflect from Draco’s nerves, he really owed them later. Right as he’s beginning to get a hold of himself, Granger and Weasley walk onto the field, and if they’re here that means Draco will be perfectly fine. He can deal with pests like these.
Blaise steps through the mops of red hair, Pansy hot on his heels. Harry has half the sense to cower behind Draco, and all the courage and stupidity to face them head-on. “What the hell were you doing with the King of The Black Sea?!”
“I do think I agree with your friends. Think of it this way, allies are hard to come by, and you have two throwing themselves at your feet. This way you will be safer, and have the freedom to confide in whoever you chose, plus the contract sounds painless, if there was danger in it I would simply not allow it, but this seems more like your friends are rather protective of you. I daresay they have good reasons to be.”
Draco ignores his friends laughing at the panic on his face, swearing up and down that he loves Blaise with all his heart as the boy gets Draco’s things ready for the day so he can throw on some robes and make himself presentable.
Dobby grins at Harry, who manages a pathetic excuse for a wave, and then peers at the girl with her jaw on the floor.
Two sets of arms he quickly recognizes as Pansy and Blaise wrap around him before he could reach for his wand, but once he’s encased in the familiar warmth, he grins back. “You! Mother? Did you?”
the downside is that i'm working ten hour shifts five days a week and i'm also a fulltime college student which is why the updates haven't been consistent recently. i'm trying to fix it, but i'm moving this month or next month so it might be a while before everything settles down.
Ron gives him a look. “Worrying. It’s only been a day, mate. We both know he gets exactly like Hermione. Give him another five hours, Blaise will probably drag him down to the room. If he’s not there by the time Hermione resurfaces, then we worry.”
Once again, it would be so much easier if he had his wand so they could Apparate back to the manor, but luck is not on his side and he doubts he’ll have earned that so soon. The two of them are swept up in the crowd, filled to the brim with terror. Some people don’t even bother packing up, he hears parents yelling to ‘leave! We can come back later!” Children are crying, mothers counting to make sure they have everyone. Left and right families are disappearing, him and Draco so close to the safe point he has in mind.
It made sense if he really thought about it, and he does drag LuLu to the Astronomy tower so he can muse out loud to her and make sense of the bullshit.  He’s already had one life altering decision: becoming Dumbledore’s spy. He had used all three to make that. Draco had dreamed of a life with and without the Dark Lord, criticized every plan to perfection, and only after careful consideration had he chosen. What would his next one be?
In all honesty he completely forgets about them when he sees Snape. The man doesn’t look half as pleased to see him, and that is a very big warning sign.
hi! sorry that this is so late, also so short. the storms this week knocked out our power and it took a few days before my roomates and I were able to get the wifi fixed, therefore it took a few days to actully write the chapter. I actually got off at 5, wrote the thing, and then posted it so if it's not that good I'm sorry but I'm going to make a long, lovely post next week that will tie all of the strange things together!
“Thanks, you’re great.” Draco mumbles. He doesn’t even complain when a pillow comes flying his way from across the room. Instead he curls around LuLu and tries to go the fuck back to sleep.
“Well. I had them explain, using my new favorite method of acquiring the truth, it works wonders, I suggest you try it. Oh, stop giving me that look we both know you do what has to be done. Anyways, I had them explain the truth behind last year,
“Are you suggesting there is something more important than loyalty? Or do I need to hex you before you leave?”
He shuffles into a more comfortable position before he begins, “I was born into the Black house and almost instantly they hated me. Mother, Walberga, hated everything from my eyes to my laugh which I inherited from my father. Regulus, my brother, looked a bit more like her so she naturally liked him better. We all practiced the dark arts, I remember Bella and Sissy used to make jokes about it whenever Regulus and I were annoyed. The four of us were thick as thieves when we were children, running around our manors and getting into all kinds of trouble. For a very short time we were happy. And then Voldemort came into power. He promised shit like ‘blood purity’ returning to the wizarding world, and Mother bought every cent of it. She joined first, and would’ve forced father if he didn’t fall sick right before my first year at Hogwarts. The four of us kids still met, of course, but we were afraid. Bella hated the idea of bowing to man, and then her marriage arrangement was announced and she started to lose it. He tortured her parents until they caved, you know. She had to listen to her mom and dad screaming for hours on end, and that does something to a child. Sissy learned to be out of the house whenever he came to visit. She’d always end up at ours to the point that we didn’t even bother with the floo anymore. Some nights she would come to me crying and make me swear not to tell anyone how afraid she was...Voldemort made a lot of promises back then, and all our parents thought they were great even though the sight of him followed us into our nightmares…”
