Harry stooped before finishing, slammed his mouth shut painfully as he gripped the wall behind him and bit his lip; causing some blood to drip from it.
“How about you take the bags to our rooms,” she suggested. Draco looked between his mother and Remus before standing up and nodding.
Harry’s lips grew tight and he shook his head. “We can’t wait any longer, if they get to far past the gates McGonagall and the others could get seriously hurt,” Harry whispered back.
Harry watched her leave and then sighed and sat down, playing with his nails as he waited. He hadn’t been able to get what she said earlier out of his head. It had been bothering him the whole time they were talking as she was measuring and showing him the different fabrics; their idle chatter not being enough either. One of the few werewolves that could get a job?
Tom and Narcissa talk about the case against Dumbledore. And Harry gets an apology from Hermione.
Harry was startled by the doors opening and seeing McGonagall and Professor Snape walking over to his bed, he was surprised to say the least. There were footsteps behind them as well, and Harry had to peak around them to spot I very out of breath Charlie and Bill behind them. Lifting his brows as they formed a circle around his bed, he was starting to feel like he was about to be interrogated.
Jariss said bumping against Draco's mind.
Tatsuya spoke, his voice quietly ghosting through Harry’s thoughts. Harry nodded and smiled, tomorrow then!
“Not exactly. I remember changing and it was all fine up to before Bubo pushed the window open,” he sighed and gripped the cup a little tighter. “I didn’t hurt anyone, right?”
he paused for emphasis,
“Well. Honestly, I think this will both be fun and very dangerous. Especially for you, I mean I understand you defeated Voldemort, but compared to him a dragon is-.”
“The dragon didn’t seem anywhere as big as the Hungarian Horntail you faced, or the Ukrainian Ironbelly in Gringotts. I think most of the students said it was only about thirty feet long from head to tail. A Horntail is about fifty feet long, hints as to why the rest of it is so big. From the descriptions, the dragon was probably a juvenile Hebridean Black, full grown but not in it’s prime. It’s also a local species so it’s not completely unusual for this to happen. It probably wandered from the MacFusty’s sanctuary because it was pushed out by an older dragon,” Luna stated, waving her hand about before leaning on Neville. “I heard Charlie is coming from Romania in a day or so to help out.”
Draco lifted an eyebrow and closed his book before placing it on his lap. “It’s a poem book I found at the Malfoy Manor when I was twelve. It doesn’t say who the author is, but I’ve kept it with me ever since.”
Harry nodded however at Hermione's question and laid his hand down onto Ghost's mane, gripping it slightly. Draco blinked, his head lifting up in response to the action and he looked up at Harry. "Well, I'll see you later tonight," Harry stated and then turned. Draco turned with him, if only to make sure his fur wasn't pulled in Harry's tight grip on his mane. It grew tighter even as they walked towards the door and only loosened once they where on the stairs. Draco walked beside Harry patiently but he was starting to feel a bit worried about his knew charge. Could he call him that? Draco lifted one of his lips in a slight snarl. It didn't matter, what did matter was why Harry had tensed up like he had, and what happened between him and Ginny. Normally he would say it was non of his business, but now it was. He'd rather know so he could help Harry if need be than get caught in the crossfire between some feud on accident.
"Um, could you perhaps turn around and keep watch," Harry murmured. His eyes where on the ground and his face slightly flushed like he was embarrassed about something. Draco finally realized why and felt himself starting to blush to, if animals could blush, and then he swiftly turned around and took up his post. He cleared his throat with a huff, his porcupine like mane standing up as his tailed slid over the floor slowly. "Thanks," Harry stated. Draco heard the water starting to run behind him and tried to focus on other things rather than how much he had under estimated Harry's looks. Even with the scars littering his body from front to back he still looked attractive. He wondered how Harry had gotten so many in such a short span of life.
Harry looked around the store, browsing through the shelves and different cages. The store was rather loud, with barking canines and meowing cats along with the sounds from various other animals. He looked back at the door only to spot Sirius talking to a man at the counter and shrugged his shoulders. Apparently, he wasn’t getting any help from him.
Draco nodded and watched as LeFay straightened and left. He still couldn’t believe it all. Harry was alive. Not the Harry he knew, LeFay was alive, but then again. If what LeFay said about the collar was right, did that mean there could be was some part of the Harry he knew left? Still, those emerald eyes haunted him; ones that matched that terrifying monster.
Est-ce mon tour?
Harry explained to the snake as he sat up and rubbed his head. He blinked a few times, swearing Draco had purple eyes before he sat up, but they were his normal grey. He decided it must have been due to him almost blacking out.
‘Take care of him’ was all it said.
Closing his eyes he felt for out Tatsuya within his mind, connecting with him as they slipped into their Kitsune form. Their minds now as one.
“I have to Draco,” Harry merely whispered under his breath.
Harry lifted it too his eye, his mouth going slack when he did. A net of blue covered Draco the dragon, along with a few yellow-green, and red strings of magic. There was a purple and green twisted cord that lead from Harry to Draco as well and it drew his attention. He reached out to touch it but it simple faded through his hand. Harry handed the glass shard back to Charlie.
Tatsuya laughed,
"Let us eat."
He added as he looked at his reflection in the mirror, seeing a ghostly reflection of his dragon half in the reflection behind him. Smoke rolled out of the dragon’s nostrils as it listened to him.
He shook his head, "No."
“How do we start this then?” Harry asked with determination.
“Shh, just drink,” Harry said softly, tipping the bowl to Cadmael’s lips. At first it didn’t look like it worked till Cadmael started to relax, and then a soft gold light started to form between them, hesitantly reaching out to Draco too. There was a moment of silence as the dusty veins of gold wrapped around the three of them, and a ring started to form around the three men. Almost like the first breath of spring finally hit, there was a mysterious breeze that formed the room just as the magic settled, pushing Severus back gently before the magic faded.
“Stable, we were able to get quite a bit of information from his memories, as I’m sure you’ve seen. But we’ve run into a pretty big blockage, formed during his childhood, and one within the last few days. The mind healers are currently working on both. The exhaustion has kept him under for most of it,” August explained, eyes scanning both men before he stood. “Have you gone to see Draco yet?”
August face screwed up into an uneasy expression, “What did he say?”
"Call him," Snape stated, rolling his eyes.
“What was that stuff?” Harry slurred. The Kitsune laughed and smiled.
Draco trailed off, closing his eyes tight,
Will reading, and then Draco gets a new piece of jewelry!
Jariss murmured,
“Harry, get back in here and apologize! These people are part of-.”
A low moan erupted from Draco as LeFay bit down onto his neck, his teeth easily piercing skin as he marked his mate. The blood that flooded his system reminded him of dark chocolate, licking his lips as he continued kissing the fair skin of his mate. He pulled away the robe that kept Draco barely covered, tossing it to the side as he pushed Draco down to the floor of this darkness. Draco growled, snapping his head up as he flipped the two of them, teeth sinking down into LeFay's neck. Another roar resounded and echoed throughout the darkness as Harry's blood met Draco's tongue, his wings suddenly bursting from his back, stretching far over both of them as both moaned in ecstasy.  LeFay's eyes rushed open, lips parting, as he felt the next rush of magic snapping into place and his hands moved to the horns now sprouting from Draco's head. He could feel every heartbeat between them, every breath, every touch.
It had been three days since the Malfoy’s moved in, and nothing was going Draco's way. For starters, his mother made him help with Harry’s lessons. Lessons he should have learned from the day he could walk. Along with that Draco also had to help him with potions, under instruction from Snape of course, but it didn’t make him feel any better.
At least, he’d thought he’d known the real man behind this mask but now he wasn’t so sure. A six year gap, which he thought wouldn’t be a problem, suddenly turned to a massive fault between him and Harry.
“Harry!” Bill shouted and started running to him. Harry sat up and quickly put a thumb’s up in the air when he heard the dragon starting to growl at Bill. He stopped in his tracks and bowed a bit, backing away from Harry without turning his back on the dragon. Draco seemed to relax, his head dropping back down to the ground. Harry got up and dusted himself off, kicking the spears aside, and when he looked back at Draco's dragon head, the eerie eyes closed. He walked the length of the dragon up to his shoulder, one hand always placed on the dragon’s side as he walked. The scales seemed to shiver underneath Harry's hand and large violet eyes opened again when he stopped at the dragon’s neck.
Draco's eyes snapped into focus as his arm wrapped around Harry's and they both swam for the surface. Harry was the first out, pulling himself and Draco up onto the sharp edges of the clear barrier he'd shattered. As Harry finished climbing to safety he turned, tugging Draco the rest of the way up.
Harry could feel Tatsuya’ irritation as they burst from the trees and what they saw was pure chaos. Quickly the group reverted to their wizard forms, watching the battle that unfolded near Hogwart’s gates.
Harry writes a letter in reply to Draco, and Draco had a moment to talk with his godfather.
"It's too late to be thinking about that now," he muttered as he bit into a sweet roll. OInce it was done it was done. Even with a time turner you could only do so much.
Harry laughed, smiling wide as he flicked a nut at Ron.
Draco thinks he's insane to do so.
Hermione turned brighter and thumped him over the head, causing him to smile as he rubbed the new sore spot. Luna smiled and Neville looked rather intrigued.
Hisashi looked up at the large dragon, a smirk forming across his lips before he bounded over to his place at the top of the hill. A toothy smile formed across his face as he looked over the two creatures in front of him. “Now, LeFay, your first lesson. Make him submit,” Hisashi commanded.
Draco lowered his head, pressing the tip of his snout against LeFay's face and letting out a slow breath. LeFay's hair shifted around his face, causing the older man to smile slightly as he brought a hand up to press it against Draco's snout.
Harry finished pulling on his pants and then glanced around for a second, sighing slightly as he looked at the collar and arrowhead. He grabbed both and stuffed them into his pockets before grabbing his coat and headed out the door.
Draco stood beside him, listening quietly as he watched the practice below.
Everyone's eyes were still on the odd pair, and those closest tried to eves drop on the headmaster's conversation. Yet, as their conversation wore on the hall started to regain the volume of conversation it had before, the fascination of the hyena starting to ebb.
The next memory made Harry want to vomit, Cadmael was chained to the wall, head hanging limply. He couldn’t tell quite when this event had occurred, as when he’d pulled it from Cadmael’s mind it had been heavily altered and muddled. It was taking a lot for Harry to even keep the memory together. “Using me won’t work, he doesn’t care for me. He cares for that dragon child!” Cadmael was cursing.
“Sirius,” he whined, eyes still big.
“Sirius!” he snapped, croaking and coughing, hurriedly grabbing a napkin to wipe his face and the spray from the table.
Snape was finishing putting the potions together when he heard a knock on his door. Sighing, he popped the potions into his carrying bag, and then went to open the door. He opened it, surprised when he was face to face with LeFay. He took a step back into the room, casting a quick glance around the room.
Hermione rolled her eyes, "They aren't quills, it very long hair, like hackles on a dog."
“I knew that man was no good, rotten to the core,” she spat as she gathered her items.
Remus was about to explain when Narcissa cut in. “A Kitsune, or fox spirit is a very old creature that originally came from Japan. However, as the wizarding community expanded westward so did many of the magical creatures, including ones like the Kitsune. You see long ago many of the magical creatures we know of today either blessed families with magic, or were the start of a wizard’s bloodline. So, it made since that magical creatures like the Kitsune would spread as wizards did. Of course, there was also magical creatures that already inhabited areas that wizards spread to which inevitably added to those bloodlines. Every so often these inheritances, or characteristics, will resurface in a wizard’s bloodline. Which you well know Draco,” she finished.
Eureka moment! So the story isn't going to go exactly how I was planning it out, I had a really good idea so I'm going with it. Hope you guys like it! SO Hold on for the ride guys!
"I see my father's reputation still creates disgust," Hati smiled sadly, rubbing his arms over each other.
“Actually, I’m not paired up with anyone. The Headmistress can’t find any one capable enough that and won’t fight me all the time,” Theo answered, waving his hand dramatically.
“We knew the moment he got his inheritance,” Remus stated quietly. “We knew that he would most likely revert to his true self.”
“What about using the name it already calls itself,” Snape smirked as he stood beside Harry. Harry lifted his brows.
“Poems? Could I see one?”
“Very well. Mister-Pot. Excuse me, Lord LeFay. First is the matter of your familiar, I understand that the two of you have formed a completed familiar bond. Hogwarts rules state that any animals deemed dangerous or unpredictable are not allowed on campus, however the fact that you two have a completed familiar bond, unlike most students that bring their ‘pets’ with them, Hogwarts rules cannot interfere. Thus, allowing you to keep Ammit with you,” McGonagall explained.
Theo sat up and scowled at all three of them before wrapping an arm around Hermione.
“I’m fine,” Draco told his dragon. The Hebridean Black smirked, dark scales humming underneath Draco’s skin.
Draco felt like his heart was about to burst. He felt unbearable pain as he was both unimaginably angry, and distraught. Harry had sacrificed his soul to safe him, bound himself to Draco in ways no mortal could even understand without first passing through Lady Magic's heart and living to tell the tale. He felt tears streaming down his cheeks as his front limbs finally gave out and he lay there in a heap.
Remus stared at Harry for a moment and then nodded slowly. “Apparently. I wonder why Dumbledore never spoke of it. It could have helped Snape a lot, perhaps we should tell him?” he suggested.
Draco wasn’t sure what happened, but he watched as LeFay seemed to change, his overall aura becoming darker and his posture lifting. He watched as the green eyes looked up at him, and he couldn’t help the bit of arousal that flushed through him.
Tatsuya said, nudging at LeFay's thoughts.
As the second battle of Hogwarts starts, Harry, Snape, and Draco try to counter the attacking ex-Death Eaters. Yet as they move in Draco seems to be the only one able to make a move. That is until Harry makes a very unexpected move, one that leaves all of the wizarding world in an uproar.
"Hang on Neville," Harry called from the door way as he entered the room, he crept slowly towards the bed, his eyes flicking between Ghost and Neville. How did he fix this. "Ne-Neville, this is Ghost, he is going to be my familiar. Ghost, that is Neville, he's a friend," Harry stopped as he noticed the growling starting to emanate from Ghost's body. "Don't move a muscle Neville, just try and stay calm, show him your not a threat, do you have any snacks on you? Maybe try giving him that? It'll work, I think," Harry hurridly suggested
Harry skidded to a stop, having to use his arms to steady himself as he almost hit the ground. There, in a small halo of light stood the boy from before. Harry stared at him and took a step forward, splashing red water onto his leg. "Draco?" he asked softly and his voice seemed to echo. The boy didn't turn around, only continuing to yell Harry's name. "Draco! Draco, I'm right here!" Flashes of memory went by as he started walking, then running to the other adolescent. "DRACO!" he yelled louder, this time the boy turned. Slowly at first till he saw Harry over his shoulder and then his eyes widened.
Harry stated. He pulled on his uniform, complete with one of his Egyptian shendyts and his dark student robes. Ammit tilted his head, seeming to mull something over before flicking his tongue out at Harry when he sat on the bed.
“Why is there only one bed?” Draco growled at the house elf.
Cadmael gritted his teeth, a low growl building in his chest. That old fart lied to him, used him.
Voldemort's face softened as he moved a strand of hair out of Harry's face. "What have I done Severus. Look what at what I let that vile man do to my kin, what I let him shape me into with his lies and speeches of grandor," Voldemort spat. Severus winced slightly and then hesitantly lifted his hand to his master's shoulder.
Someone had done the decency of tucking him into a long robe, but he could still see that from the middle of his thigh, and farther, his leg had turned into a delicate fox leg covered in silky vat black fur. Starting at his pointed fox head he traced down his neck till he felt where the fur stopped and his skin turned slowly from a dark grey to his normal fair skin.
Snape wanted badly to hug his godson but he didn’t think it was right. He lifted his head, eyes narrowed in on Sirius and Remus. Both looked like they were on the verge of tears.
Severus didn't stop though. "If I had known," he paused, "Tom, I'm so sorry."
LeFay stayed crouched as the thing above him moved, uncovering him and letting the moonlight shine down upon him. Taking a step back, his mind exploded questions as his eyes meet giant dark purple orbs.
"More work?"
"Yes. Harry died for Draco, and in doing so released my last soul fragment. If Bellatrix hadn't called for Narcissa, however, I would not be sitting here explaining everything. For that I am forever grateful," he put his thumb to his lip, "Lady Magic is keen to return Harry to our world. He has been blessed by her, and chosen to be her champion. However..."
Harry hung his head, eyes glued to the floor. "I was," he glanced at Ghost, only to see that the animal seemed to be avoiding his gaze. It was curious behavior and drew his attention before Snape cleared his throat.
Harry nodded softly. It was Harry's fault the two had disappeared, and it was his responsibility to find them. Harry nosed Herm and she got up, backing off a bit so that Harry could change back.
LeFay stared at him, flashing fangs in a frustrated display.
"That scowl is unbecoming of you, you'll end up looking like Sev if you keep it up for much longer," LeFay looked down at Draco, grey purple eyes staring back at him. "What were you thinking about that produced such a look?" Draco asked.
Harry stopped at the door to their room, placed inside part of the Astronomy Tower he later found out, and stated the password before mossing in. Draco followed, glancing behind them to make sure they weren’t followed. Draco sighed as he leaned against the door for a moment and then headed over to the bed and flopped down, face first.
Harry sighed, flicking a rock in no particular direction as he thought about all that transpired. Tatsuya seemed to be regarding him silently before he stood up and started to walk away. He could feel the vibrations from his Tatsuya's steps even when he was a good distance away. The power that radiated of the Kitsune was massive.
The last person to come in knelt below LeFay; signalling everyone to stand again and take their seats.
Clearing his throat, Draco shook it off and turned his gaze to the fire place, “So why is it green all around the castle within the wards?” he asked.
“I thought Ron would have been here too,” Harry said quietly. Hermione shrugged slightly and then pulled over another chair from an unused bed so she could actually sit down.
its two pairs of eyes stared at him,
Draco’s eyes whipped up to Harry’s face as shivers fell down his spine. He took a step back from Harry and swallowed. His eyes reminded him of Nagi's just before she killed.
"You don't belong here, Severus needs you."
Draco looked at the hand, confused for a moment before his father took him by the arms and helped him stand.
"I understand, but I need to know something first," he said.
LeFay snorted, like he would forget after almost losing a limb. That had been his first and only mistake before turning his leaf completely around.
Just as sudden as the nightmare had started Draco woke, falling off the bed and struggling to attack the arms that had plagued him in sleep.
Dragoon cleared his throat as he finished and looked up at Sirius who was visibly shaken. “Dragoon are you able to see what the creature inheritance is?” Sirius asked.
Harry grunted and sat up, causing Draco to curse when he hit the bed with a thud he wasn't expecting. Harry got to his feet, summoning a robe to pull on. "And us," he muttered, just loud enough for Draco to hear.
“They will be here within the hour,” hopefully, Remus thought to himself. “They went out shopping for supplies.” Damn he felt cornered, yet he had to hold his ground. Sirius was depending on him to give off a strong front. One of the reasons Sirius had planned them moving in around the full moon was so Remus had the extra boost of confidence from his wolf. Though he doubted they would feel safe here after he turned.
Severus smiled, but it faulted slightly when he looked at Draco in his animagus form. Draco seemed distraught, and he had to wonder why. Apparently Draco had made quite the impression so far, so he'd thought his godson would have been pleased. Yet it didn't seem like it. "Well, there is something you should know about Ghost..." he trailed off as Ghost jumped from his spot, his mane standing on end as he vaulted himself at Snape. At least that was what it looked like to Harry till the african beast cleared Severus's head and landed on the other side of the chair. There was a crash and loud snapping of teeth, along with something else.
Harry swallowed and then sat up as well, looking at the others still sleeping in the morning rays. “Didn’t what?” he asked as he stared at Draco. Draco growled again. “The collar?" Harry asked innocently, "Both Charlie and Snape said it would help with the curses and spells you where under. Perhaps even on your memory at the time. It seems like it worked on both,” he explained. Draco glanced over at the sleeping form of his godfather.
"Our turn," Luna stated as she smiled. Harry sat up on the bed with Theo to give them more room, a smile forming on his face. He really wanted to see how Luna looked as a unicorn, and what Neville looked like since his was a humanoid creature. Hermione came out of the bathroom just as Neville finished transforming, giving her a scare. He looked pretty much like normal Neville but wings, much like a bat, had formed. Along with a pair of small horn nubs along his hair line. He had a tail to complete it and his skin had turned a dark purple while his eyes had become pure white.
There was a long pause in the room as the keys and chest floated over to their respective owners. Severus gritted his teeth for a moment before speaking. “Who were the witnesses to their wills?”
LeFay felt the stir of sorrow, the pang of a broken heart, as the arrow head charm he wore around his neck came to life. He’d only worn it to remember but…
“Now!” LeFay bellowed, his magic starting to form solid tendrils around him, “Cadmael, were is he?!”
“So how are we going to do this?” he questioned, his ears tipping forward as he grinned slyly. All three tails curled mischievously behind him as he leaned forward a bit. Draco looked over his shoulder before jumping to his feet and taking a step back.
They stopped in the snow as LeFay concentrated on looking inwards, towards his inherited half. Tatsuya was sitting in the very back of his mind, darkness enveloping him, but LeFay could tell Tatsuya had heard him.
Ammit stated. He was confused why his master was so upset when it was obvious his master liked the hatchling.
Draco asked quietly, looking into the beastly eyes behind his reflection.
“Yes, and no.”
She looked at him, her eyes wide as she meet his depressed gaze.
LeFay stopped, turning his head slightly towards Draco but didn’t look at him.
Draco’s hand laid on the collar. Angry first as he gripped it strongly before his hand relaxed and began tracing his fingers over the amethysts within. He let his gaze stray from LeFay, hopelessness enveloping him.
"You are still here?" the blackness asked. Harry was use to the world talking to him, and he smiled cooly.
Draco sighed and nodded, his eyes looking back at the way they came.
“Good, now I’ve made the needed adjustments in the wards for you to move freely between them already. However, you won’t be able to take anyone through the wards with you,” LeFay stated in between sips of tea; motioning for Draco to take a seat across from him.
“Why would Dumbledore lie?” Remus voiced, looking at a stunned Sirius.
“They aren’t just your apples.” There was a slight pause as Harry glared at him. He blinked a few times and opened his mouth before closing it again and looking down at his horde of apple slices. Slowly he pushed the plate of slices towards Draco with one slim finger, his eyes never leaving the plate as Draco hesitantly grabbed one.
Once Potter was done showering the two headed down to the common room while everyone was still sleeping. Draco doubted the lazy Gryffindors would get up an earlier than they had to, and especially take advantage of not needing to wake up at all on the weekends. Surprisingly enough when they got down to the Gryffindor common room, there was actually a few people up as early as them. Not so surprisingly one of those people was Hermione Granger. Draco eyed her warily through beady predatory eyes, he had not forgotten what she had done the previous night when she'd taken Potter's book. Currently however she was talking to Ginny Weasly.
What he found there was not disgust, malice, or even anger. Fear yes, but it wasn’t what he thought it would be like. It was fear of him yes, but fear that Draco would be unworthy of LeFay’s presence, that he wouldn’t be useful. Fear that he wouldn’t be what Harry needed. Fear of his power yes, from good reason, but there was also an overwhelming amount of arousal. Lust, and the longing to make Harry his and his alone. He was surprised and pulled away from the connection, but something lulled him back to the connection point, so hesitantly Harry placed his hand back on it. He smiled then, a sense of security, and trust enveloping him. Draco trusted him, respected his power. With someone as strong as LeFay on his side he wouldn’t have to worry about defending only himself, he’ll have something to defend him and have his back while he was weak. He wouldn’t have to be on guard as often. Relief, a strong sense of relief that he wasn’t alone anymore.
Sitting up sharply he grabbed the newspaper from the side of the desk and skimmed it till he came upon the updates for the new year.
Draco could feel the panic bubbling up but he squashed it down, a small smile forming on his face. He really should have been more careful for what he wished for, LeFay had warned him and he'd ignored it. Now it was too late to go back and he hadn't even gotten to the juice bits yet. "You're right," Draco chuckled darkly, looking up to meet the ancient vampires eyes, "What does he need me to do?" he asked.
"About me?" Draco asked, taken off guard by the comment. "Why me? Wait, has the Master's eye?"
This person must have a real taste for the elegant pieces.
He switched his eyes from the fire to LeFay as the older man put down his cup and saucer.
“Well, it’s Harry,” Theo stated, confused as he looked down at him before extending a hand to help him up.
"Would you like me to take the charge you've acquired?" August asked as he looked back at his Lord.
Harry sighed and then headed on his way. He was almost to the tower when he rounded the corner only to stop in his tracks as he spotted a group of people in the hallway. Quickly he hid behind the wall and then peaked around it to see what was going on.
Tatsuya grumbled,
Harry nodded his head slowly and then concentrated on his class work. He had one more day after today to try and achieve his animagus form, he told himself. He really hoped it would be enough.
It had a tracking charm, protection charm, shrinking charm, and a portkey in it. He wondered distantly where the portkey part was, and where the portkey went. Flipping the note over he found a small bracelet charm attached to the back of it in the shape of an arrowhead. Unsticking it with his wand he inspected it further. It was very pretty, with a purple tint to the end of it that faded into the black. He looked over the collar again before flicking his wand, curious about something. He released the shrinking charm on it, almost dropping the collar as it grew and clattered onto the table.
Harry watched as the boy vanished into the bloody waters, he had still been surprised to see anyone else here. As he climbed out of the water he laid down on the cool glass-like surface of his worlds floor. He touched his skin, feeling the raised scarred flesh. The rough spiderwebs of each one traced a new roadway across his body. He looked up into the blackness and let his eyes slowly close. Soon enough he'd be free. Free from all of the world's credulity. Yet, something kept him here in limbo. Maybe it had something to do with the adolescence that screamed his name. He vaguely remembered yelling the boy's name back but, he couldn't remember it now.
His tone sounded far too sad to Draco, he’d never heard his other half sound so somber before.
LeFay gave a soft, tired smile to August; silently thanking him.
“The fact Dumbledore lied about the Lordship, and the fact he sealed Mom and Dad’s wills."
Hermione, seeming to notice the tension too spoke up. "We where studying for the Transfiguration exam on Monday. I thought it would be easier to do with no one else around but us. How about you?" she asked.
“I can’t believe you two. Don’t you think he has been put through enough? It’s one dead end after the other,” Snape countered their conversation. Draco closed the door behind him with a light thump, drawing the attention of the other four adults.
Draco scowled and then threw the newspaper into the trash.
"Are you afraid of me Draco?" Harry asked as he leaned in; his hands moving to rest on the dresser to either side of Draco.
Seamus hooted a few seats down, "What is that thing?!"
Black hair melted into a vat black body with glowing eyes hanging hauntingly over a toxic maw dripping with magic; creating moss and plants were it fell. The creature looked at Snape before gracefully loping down the hall, barely coming into contact with the ground as it disappeared.
“How do you feel about all of this?” Harry asked, turning his head to look at Bill for a second before concentrating on a bramble that had snared his leg.
Snape stopped and turned sharply, stepping up to Harry and almost knocking him over. "Potter," his voice softened slightly, "these are private lessons. The potions lab is no place for what we are about to do, and if you happened to misfire a spell in a room full of expensive potion ingredients." He stopped and straightened himself. "Well, you get where I'm going with this. I do hope you are at least intelligent enough to catch on."
“Try me,” Harry pursued.
Harry stood up after closing his chest as quietly as he could and then turned, about to walk towards the bathroom before stopping. He tilted his head at Ghost and then gestured at the bathroom. "Are you coming or what?" Harry asked. Ghost tilted his head from side to side and looked kind of puzzled before jumping down from the bed and following Harry into the bathroom. "I'd rather not leave you out there to terrorize everyone in their sleep," Harry stated as he walked down to the open air showering area. Ghost made a noise that sounded a lot like human laughter before head butting Harry's leg. He gave Harry a look that just said he was up to no good. "Besides, you can be my look out rather than me putting up tripping jinxs," Harry added.
Years later, Cadmael lay in what seemed like a hotel, letter in his hands as he wanted for his ‘savoir’ to meet him. While he’d been communicating with the man via letter ever since he’d been reunited with the man, this would be the first time meeting him in person since he was little. The reunion went well, they chatted, laughed even. Then, he was asked to do something odd for the man. It would seem there was a new threat in the world, and Albus wanted him to look into it. What else could he do but agree, after all, the older man had done so much for him in his youth.
Et je danse, danse, danse, danse, danse, danse, danse
It wasn’t at all what he had expected. He was about the size of a pony, with three long tails that currently curled neatly up over his back. A small set of antlers sat on his head, but all around he just looked like a normal yet over sized fox. It definitely wasn't as scary looking as Tatsuya, that was for sure. His mouth and teeth even looked normal when he opened them to look at them. Everything seemed okay, that was until he got to his eyes. The Avada Kedavra eyes seemed sad, and sparkling emerald tears spilled from his eyes, down the sides of his cheeks. He hadn't even noticed that he was crying. That's when he felt arms wrap around his neck and a face buried itself into his fur.
“There is more merit to it than last few,” Sirius’ gaze was hopeful as he motioned to it and Draco.
Excuse the shortness.
"You think that's cute? You sure you're okay mate?"
“Lord LeFay only just came into his Throne. I’m sure you will know him when he comes back,” Kreacher chuckled. He was glad they had sorted out the bloodlines so now his mistress didn’t scream from her portrait anymore. “Come this was Master Draco,” Kreacher beckoned with his hand before leading Draco to his room.
Harry grimaced at the sarcasm held within his teachers tone. "I thought-."
“There should be clearing up ahead where we can take a rest at,” Remus stated and pulled ahead of the group with Sirius close at his heels. Charlie followed with Snape, striking up a conversation about the potions he brought.
“Draco, we have to do this,” his mother said tiredly as she dropped her hand. Draco looked wide-eyed at her and paled for a moment before his face turned hard and he spun around to leave.
Tatsuya walked over to a waterfall at the back of the glade. Its waters' glowing from glittering silver-blue, metal, rock face it fell from.
Upon seeing Harry’s realization, and hearing blood start to race, Remus got down beside Harry and turned his face gently away from the mirror. “Hey, listen to me. There is nothing to panic about, you are still you," Remus said sternly while keeping eye contact with panicking fox-man, "What you are seeing is not permanent, it’s just that your magic went haywire and your creature side had to over compensate. The fact you had so many blocks on your magic just made the problem worse," he continued to explain slowly. He could feel Harry's pulse start to slow, "Once your creature inheritance settles the features won’t be as prominent, just like with Sirius." Remus gestured behind him to Sirius and his dog ears.
Draco blinked, for once Longbottom made sense.
With Ammit's death Draco has to suddenly his place at Harry's side. Without it Harry's power would become wild.
Tatsuya said. LeFay held the picture between his fingers for a long moment before glaring while it burst into flames and turned to ash in his hand.
"Harry, what happened to you?" Draco asked softly.
“No, I feel weird in the morning if I take them. And you really must stop calling him that,” he muttered. Lupin agreed and gave Sirius a stern glare, causing Sirius to put his hands up in defeat.
he said softly as he stood in front of Harry.
Harry started to try and stand before stopping. He realized shoes would probably hurt Draco more if he stepped on any of the sore areas, so he quickly slipped them off and dropped them onto the cave. Giving of a resounding thud when they landed. Charlie looked up from the pad he was writing on, eyes wide. “Harry! What are you doing!” he half yelled, half whispered. Harry spun his head around to hush the dragon-keeper.
"Harry! Are you okay?" Hermione asked as she tried to suppress her giggling. Luna was outright laughing and both Neville and Theo looked down at him confused.
“Yea, where’s yours?”
Bill did had to agree with that.
Severus huffed.
,” LeFay repeated, his voice dripped with power as a wave of both pleasure and fear coated Draco’s body. Before he could even think Draco laid down, a soft thud when his head finally hit the ground, nose just at the edge of LeFay’s paws. Harry couldn’t help the wave of satisfaction he felt, but the disgust soon followed, and he turned his head so he didn’t have to look-.
LeFay could hear Tatsuya grumbling in his head and chuckled.
Tatsuya said as he appeared in front of LeFay’s desk.
“Look Ghost! Isn’t it neat!” Harry said.
“Is it not you that decided to come here? If you don’t like it then leave!”
He could have sworn they were on when he'd headed down stairs, everything even seemed to be in perfect definition. Finding his glasses, Harry pulled them on only to have everything he looked at become ridiculously fuzzy. He stared at them for a moment as he pulled them off his face, even cleaning them before trying it again. When he got the same result, he put them down and sighed. “Stran-nge,” he drawled out before looking at himself in the mirror. He stood up and stepped in front of it, catching himself in the full-length mirror. Along with his eyes seeming to be fixed themselves they seemed to be bit brighter. Harry noticed a few other changes as well. He'd gotten a bit taller, and filled in. He touched his cheeks and felt his cheek bones. He didn't remember them being so prominent before either.  Even his eyebrows had changed. They seemed thinner, more delicate, and his hair! When Harry noticed it, his eyes whipped to the reflection of his hair. The strands were so silky now! He was suddenly very caught off guard but then Remus and Sirius hadn't noticed. Maybe it was best he didn't ask. They had been pretty preoccupied with each other lately, and the sudden changes to his appearance weren’t all that extreme. Possibly, he thought, if they were staring at him long enough they might notice something was off, but that was about it.
Draco noticed the frown as he left his thoughts. "Are you alright LeFay?" he asked. LeFay looked up sharply and then put his cup down, smiling broadly.
Both Cadmael and Skoll were shocked. “Then, Father, what about-.”
“Enough.”
Harry's hair cradled his face as it floated around him, suspended in the dark waters around him. Draco could see him, and he moved closer slowly, tears starting to fall down his face but he didn't know why.
LeFay pulled the arrowhead charm out from under his shirt, rubbing his thumb over it, "I can't put into words how I feel about you Draco. It's too complicated. Between lingering memories of the Harry you knew, and the personality that is really me now? There is always conflicted thoughts."
Something moves against them in the shadows and the magical world is starting to feel it.
"Now don't start that," Severus hissed, frowning. "You deserved it and you know it. Now do you think you can control yourself?"
"With what has happened recently, we can't take any more chances. Sadly there isn't enough time to slowly introduce you two," Dumbledore explained as he put his palms together on the table, "These recent events have proved that no one is safe. Now, Snape will be tutoring you in your classes from now on, with some of the teachers supplementing in when he can't make it. Ghost is to be with you at all times, and tomorrow night you are to report to Snape's quarters. He will show you how to create the familiar contract."
"I think we should house them together, it will hopefully keep this from happening again. I'll send some one up here to bandage you arm," Severus stated as he started to walk away and then stopped. "I'm glad you are back Tom. Even if the circumstances around you acquiring your soul  and mind again are at a cost. To think all this time he planned all of this. For us to fall for this trap, for you to loose yourself in the power he forced upon you, and then almost made you kill your own flesh and blood. If I had known."
Harry pointed at the dragon’s neck then and made the same pulling motion. Draco eyed him, eyes narrowing before lifting his head to fully extend his thick neck. Draco set his head down again on the ground but kept it extended out so that Harry could get to the arrow shafts. The arrows came out much easier and it wasn’t long before Harry managed to pull them all. Bowing Harry turned from the dragon and started walking back to the group only to have a tail smash down in front of him, blocking his path.
The others looked from one person to the other before Harry took a step forward and lifted the clothes pile. "Herm?" he asked quietly. There was a quiet mew before a small cat was looking up at him. It took him a moment to recognize it before he broke out into a big smile. "You're a munchkin!" Harry laughed loudly. Theo leapt off the bed and picked up a sulking Hermione from the floor.
"I know we are all tired, but we need everyone as one unit if we want to change our world for the better. Now, I'd like to continue," LeFay paused, looking around to make sure he had everyone's attention, "Good, now about tightening security-"
Harry found the clothes he was looking for and smiled, since they didn't have class today he went ahead and pulled the muggle clothes Sirius had gotten. A green and black long-sleeve and grey denim jeans. Ghost inspected the clothes, sniffing them and then pulling back his head sharply. He gave Harry a look that only could be read as 'really?'. Harry shrugged, "What? You're not going to act like a pure-blood and insist I wear robes everywhere I go are you?" Harry asked. Ghost only huffed, turning his head away. He looked a bit like he was pouting.
Without warning they where launched into the air and LeFay found himself almost falling off if not for his claws. Draco didn't even seem to notice them digging into his scales as the got settled into flight.
Harry however was completely stunned. All that time… Harry sucked in a deep breath as he felt tears start to form at the corners of his eyes. Remus put an arm over Harry’s shoulders to try and comfort him.
He sprinted forward as the singing continued. Feeling his heart race, as the song started to near its end.
-William Shakespeare: Macbeth Act IV Scene I
“I hope I get the chase to feel your last breath beneath my claws hatchling scum,” Cadmael spat venomously as he bowed.
Harry, LeFay, stood there; his mind whirling. Did he? Did he care?
"It's just Snape," Harry muttered before sitting up and turning his body. He froze in his seat after spotting what accompanied their potions master down the isle.
“Why not? You’ve already seen the scars and burns galore,” he shrugged.
Narcissa stirred, summoning her wand and a scroll appeared before her. "This poor child, Severus."
“I won’t tell, I promise!” she said quickly, which caused Harry to freeze.
Sighing, LeFay leaned back in his seat as he watched the smoky silhouette of Tatsuya continue to book browse. LeFay couldn’t stop the small smirk from forming across his face.
Draco couldn’t believe his mother. He'd said he would deal with it yet she'd still gone and wrote a letter to that damned Potter. He sneered at the thought. A Malfoy taking handouts from a Potter, never.
"I asked you if you are feeling okay..." she said; her eyebrows furrowing. Both her and Ron exchanged a look as Harry continued playing with the food on his plate.
LeFay sat in his little sitting room just off his bedroom, a tea cup pressed to his lips as he silently took in the man across from him. He too had a cup to his lips, but his eyes were on the fire, and a blanket was wrapped tight around his shoulders.
Ghost let out a low woop, and started sniffing the collar before sitting down and proudly exposing his neck. Harry chuckled and as he held the collar up to Ghost it already started to change size to fit the hyena perfectly. The charms dangled around his neck, along with another tag in the shape of a little snake appearing on the collar, scrawled on the front and back of it appeared Ghost.
Harry continued walking for what felt like hours before finally stopping and sitting at the base of a large rock.
Who has Draco really fallen for?
It was Remus’ turn to chime in, talking quickly before Sirius could speak. “Albus Dumbledore,” he snarled, “The man blocked most of Harry’s powers, including his creature half and almost killed him. Now his magic has gone haywire do to the sudden release of the blocks. Though I’m sure Harry feels much better now; even with his accepted titles his creature half still overcompensates. Not as badly as before, but they are still side effects.”
“Huh? What is it-oh harr-HARRY!” Sirius put down the paper as he looked at his adopted son, eyes bulging. Harry straightened and then twirled on a single paw, his eyes mischievous as he faced his dads again. He wore a pair of black muggle skinny jeans that he’d cut at the knee, for the fox half of his legs, along with a v cut on the back of them for his tails to poke through. He tried to keep as much of the belt line and loops he could. A studded belt crossed above his tails and secured his pants to his hips so that the v cut in the back didn’t affect his pants’ ability to stay up. His shirt was a dark green v-neck t-shirt made of polyester and spandex with satin around the collar and sleeve ends. The back of it, starting from his neck and down to his bum, was shredded horizontally and stretched to create a ribbed pattern down his back.
Nope. Draco Malfoy was not attracted to Harry Potter in any way what-so-ever.
Then something moved in the water behind Harry. Draco heard himself screaming, trying to get Harry's attention. To warn him, but it was to late as the monster approached through the water, arms outstretched. Draco slammed against something, he felt his nails scratching at the barrier.
"Shouldn't we be going? I would think LeFay gave us new orders during the meeting," Hati said as he placed his hands on his brother's shoulders.
“It was nothing really.”
As LeFay turned to leave Snape stood, “You really should visit him.”
Letting go, LeFay turned and motioned for Draco to follow, only Draco was frozen. Both because of the sheer terror he'd just felt, and because of the way his body had reacted on it's own to the contact. It still felt warm were LeFay’s hand had been and the collar was vibrating against his skin.
Harry nodded his head, swallowing loudly once Snape had stepped away. He glanced at Ghost, only to see that the hyena had a smug look on his face. Harry scowled and grit his teeth before walking past him, making sure to run his leg into the animal's shoulder. Ghost huffed, his eyes following Harry before he started after them.
Harry scoffed but slowly lifted his hand. The dragon winced almost nervously, or expecting pain. Harry frowned but continued until his hand rested of the middle of the dragon’s face.
Draco gulped, and Draco chanced a quick glance at LeFay. The fact that the other kitsune in the room even seemed on edge told Draco everything he needed to know. “Again, I apologize for the intrusion, I’ll leave you two-”
"Oh."
Lefay hissed back to the snake. Draco watched silently, the hair standing up on the back of his neck as he listened to the parsletongue. Why did he find it so intoxicating?
Draco cut him off quickly, "And I said that's not what I wanted," Draco sighed. "The purpose of getting to know you better is so I can figure out my own feelings..." LeFay's eyebrows rose as he looked over him.
"Do you think he will wake?" Voldemort asked softly as he lifted his hand to the resident's cheek. Severus looked over the body of the young man between them.
“Could you bring that man from up front back here please?” Harry asked. The employee nodded and headed to get Sirius, leaving Harry with the snake.
Months later and he was telling Albus about everything he’d found. Surprisingly, Albus had seemed relieved to find that Harry was alive and well, but then their conversation had turned rather dark. While Harry listened in and watched the memory he could vaguely tell the memory was tampered with. Waving his wand, a part of the memory changed, and Albus was yelling, and cursing while Cadmael laid stunned on the ground. A deep bruise and scratch across Cadmael’s cheek. Harry’s brows rose, remembering then a night when Hati, Cadmael.l had returned home late one night saying that it had been a scrap during a training session with one of the wolf pack. So this is where he had actually gotten the injury. He couldn’t tell what Albus was saying in the memory, just saw the feet shuffling back and forth as the old headmaster paced.
Tom had planned on fulfilling Harry’s wish by adding Sirius and Remus to the fold, but Regulus and the attack had challenged that. It took awhile for Harry to accept, but Regulus made a good point. They didn’t know if they could trust the mutts yet. They could be under the same compulsion the rest of the Hogwarts staff were under. It was a miracle that Severus was even able to slip the treatment to McGonagall. They’d spent all of the second half of yesterday doing so, and it had taken seeing Harry and his medical history to convince her. Meaning she had to be brought to the manor under guard.
“You won’t?!" he said, startled by the quick grasp, "Why should I believe you?”
Harry glared at him, unwilling to back down but Sirius stormed out of the hallway. “What is all this racket out here?! Knock it off,” he glared between them for a moment, “Besides you two need to go get some sleep. We are leaving early for Hogwarts. The Head Mistress wants all students with creature inheritances there three days before everyone else,” Sirius grumbled. Both Draco and Harry glared at each other before leaving and grumbling about how annoying interruptions were.
“No,” LeFay said hotly, his jaw tightening, “Not until we settle everything with him. I,” he trailed off and his face softened for just a moment. August nodded, he understood, in a way, what his Lord must be going through. “I want you to go investigate Skoll and Cadmeal’s family. The time between Albus finding and ‘saving’ or beastman seems fishy, I want everything we can find. Even if that means you need to rip apart their old residence,” Harry stated, gripping Cadmael’s hand tighter. August’s surprised expression was wiped away quickly as he nodded, grabbing his book before making his way quickly out of the hospital wing. Harry stood there for a long while longer, thumb ghosting over the back of Cadmael’s hand.
“What about me?” Draco glared at him, his hands clenched at his sides as his eyes met LeFay's.
“No. Most will probably either call you Lord Potter, or Lord LeFay depending on their social standing. LeFay is one of the oldest families, thought to be extinct until now. So those that don’t know you well will probably address you as so. Those closer will probably call you Lord Potter unless you tell them otherwise,” Remus explained before yawning and glancing at the clock. Gosh it was late.
That was crazy to think about; someone being able to see his memories. After he finished getting ready Shibee popped into the room with a plate of food for Harry.
“Tell them that for now Cadmael is under supervised treatment, he’s still a prisoner but something he said before passing out makes me think that he may not be under his own control,” Harry said as he began to walk away.
“People may feel better with you-know-who gone but everything hasn’t quite settled yet, and with some of those death eaters still roaming around free,” she shook her head and looked up at his face, “Honestly a group like that was bad enough with him leading them, but now they are either pushing their own agendas or attacking at random just for fun.” Harry frowned. It seemed like everything almost got worse.
"Draco!" Snape yelled, watching Draco back disappear around a corner. There was a loud crack, and Severus could see the massive new for of Draco disappearing into the clouds.
Draco snickered, "Don't ask stupid questions and I won't have to use them, my Lord."
"Yes it is," he barely said above a whisper. "If I had listened and not left class by myself, if I'd taken up Theo and Herm's offer, none of this would have happened. You wouldn't have that damn thing around your neck, and you wouldn't be stuck with me. You'd be able to live your own life Draco."
Robes.
Harry’s ears twitched at Draco’s words and he could feel tears start to roll down his cheeks. He looked up quickly, going to grab Draco’s hand but he’d already turned and headed back into the hall with Severus. Another hand gripped his opposite in a tight grip and he looked back down at Cadmael as he wheezed and struggled to breath. Slowly the fur faded as he lost the strength to keep his beast form. His eyes cracked open and he looked up at LeFay, a soft smile on his face. He reached his hand up shakily to touch the side of LeFay’s face, whispering something softly.
Regulus and Severus nodded, and the four of them made their way into the next room. They watched through the transparent wall of the next room as those that had gotten their keys spoke. It would seem Augusta and Sirius were having some choice words with Albus. It honestly made Regulus swell with pride that Sirius was defending Harry so adamantly. Harry watched as well, though he felt sicker than anything. Ghost pushed his head into Harry’s hand, and then kept pushing him towards a soft chair.
“I’m sorry we didn’t tell you beforehand Lord LeFay, I honestly thought you had already known. Especially with your creature inheritance, I'd thought Black would have gone over everything with you,” Severus explained. “You see, collaring is something very common in the wizarding community, especially among those with creature inheritances. Some will do it for protection, while others do it for-,” Severus paused trying to find the right words.
Severus grimaced. He already knew Dumbledore had used them, and this only gave life to what he'd witnessed and didn't want to believe. "Tell me more," he said softly.
Shaking his head in slight disbelieve, he finally turned from the mirror and started to rummage through his clothes. Settling with a black muggle turtle neck and tight dark green jeans. Harry flashed back to when he'd first bought the muggle clothing and his surprise to both of Remus' and Sirius' complements about on how nice he looked. He'd honestly expected them to be a little put off by the muggle style choice, but they'd both started to even adopt it into their own wardrobes. Harry had kept his dragon hide boots however, preferring them heavily over muggle footwear. He headed downstairs once he was done, tucked his wand into the holster Sirius had gotten him for Christmas last year as an after thought. Remus was already waiting and checking his watch in displeasure. It was just like Sirius to take his sweet time.
“Ahh, Lord LeFay, I’m so glad you could join us,” Snape stated, his hawk eyes watching Harry’s every move as he stepped through the doors. Harry blushed a little, still slightly uncomfortable when anyone called him by his title.
Draco was confused for a moment, wondering what exactly he meant until it clicked. "No," he answered honestly. "But I have to start somewhere," Draco stated.
“The Wizamgot gained quite a few new seats and kicked out a few members that had been sitting in others. When they went to look at the Goblets, Mister Potter’s name was inscribed on them. That was before the seats all morphed together and left only one. The Black seat however was obvious. It would also seem that Severus has followed suite after hearing about Black being able to claim his title. He now sits on the Prince Throne. Speaking of Lord Black and Lord Potter, where are they?” Narcissa stared, both eyebrows raised.
"Harry? Harry! Come on, wake up. You can't leave us like this," came a soft male voice. It seemed full of worry, grief, as they spoke.
Harry turned his attention to Charlie, “The green and purple one? Yea. What is it?” Harry asked. Charlie shrugged.
Draco's eyes closed as he finished, sliding back up his mate's body just as the wave hit him, his head resting now on Harry's chest. He didn't have time to react as LeFay rolled them over again, Draco's startled gaze suddenly filled with the dripping image of LeFay above him. He smiled hesitantly before his mouth was claimed, and he let his body go weak, submitting into the kiss. LeFay laughed darkly and Draco could feel him at his entrance. With a sharp movement Draco let out a loud gasp, his claws digging into LeFay's back while LeFay pinned one of Draco's wings to the ground. He whinned quietly and Draco could feel his dragon submitting to this, the kistune had him by the throat now and there was no where to go. Not that he wanted to.
“Come on, we have to hurry,” Bill stated before taking off across the grounds.
Harry startled himself awake, clawing at his blankets like he had been clawing at the air while he was falling in his dream. He was panting as he sat up and then lifted his hand to wipe at his brow. It was the first of the two days the headmistress gave him to become an animagus, and already it wasn’t going very well. He had practice last night with help from Hermione and Theo who had stayed with him last night. Looking around he noticed the two were already gone, which didn’t surprise him. He looked at the other side of the bed and sighed, laying his hand on the blankets there.
“Alice Longbottom, Frank Longbottom, and Albus Dumbledore,” the goblin spoke. Severus sneered and looked over at a very angry Sirius and Remus, positioned on either side of Harry.
“How’s he doing so far?” LeFay asked, hesitantly taking Cadmael’s hand into his own.
Draco scoffed and flipped to the next page.
“Oh, but I can help you get him back,” Albus purred, “But I need you to do something for me in return.” Harry could see Albus’ wand move, a spell he couldn’t quite make out falling over Cadmael.
Harry was too busy hissing away with Ammit to notice the purple starting to bleed into Draco’s eyes. He took a step towards Harry, eyes narrowing in on him. The way he was leaning on the wall was just soo-.
“You shut up,” Dean said and turned to grab both of her hands and pulled them behind her back. Seamus pulled out his wand and pointed it at Harry, starting to cast a spell.
“What’s wrong with you freak!” Seamus snapped at her and punched her in the stomach. She doubled over and coughed, trying to suck back in the air she had lost.
Lefay crossed his arms on the balcony’s stone wall, “Because of that mad man he left Lady Magic unbalanced," he explained, "Magic is falling apart at the seams, and there is little more I can do about it, " he sighed as his gaze passed over the group below and landed on Draco, "It was going okay while I was working the underworld but there is a new power threatening to uproot all of our work.”
Well as close as he could get. His hair still trailed down to his thigh, along with his features still being predominantly sharper.
Be not afraid, come follow me
Both let out a puff of air as Draco leaned against a tree, searching for something. Something to piece everything together. Why did he want to do this? What made this relationship so important to him? He use to hate the git.
Filled with my sorrow and blood in my fields
Sirius stepped in and motioned the other two towards the floo. “Well come on then, let’s get moving.”
His eyes widened,
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. "I guess the meeting's over, might as well go look for LeFay," he mumbled. Walking through the various hallways and doorways Draco started to wonder where LeFay would even be at this time of day. He'd only just started to figure his way around the castle the last few days and easily got lost; LeFay probably knew every nook and cranny by now. Draco suddenly felt the collar at his neck growing warm and looked up to see LeFay not twelve paces away from him. Talking to Severus of all people.
“Draco?” Harry asked, eyes widening slightly. The dragon didn’t react, seeming only to grow inpatient as its lips started lifting to reveal teeth. Harry thought it would be too good to be true. Draco hadn’t come back to himself, it was still all dragon.
Draco’s wings immediately curled around him as Cadmael fired off the first spell, it slammed against his scales and Draco could feel a sudden stinging pain and warmth, but it seemed his scales were able to reflect most of the curse. Gritting his teeth Draco opened his wings wide, lifting off the ground and creating space between him and Cadmael as the beastman rushed at him. Firing back his own spell he could see it catch Cadmael in the chest and there was a sudden arcing spark that flew from him. After it cleared Draco groaned as he saw the slight glittery sheen to the beast man’s fur. It was just like his scales, there was damage but it seemed spells were only going to do so much before being deflected.
"Draco?"
LeFay inhaled sharply, a growl building up in his throat till he burst, "YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE DONE OR BEEN THROUGH! Do not come in here, spouting about what YOU think you know!" bellowed at him. The whole room shook as he spoke, "I AM NOT the same man YOU knew!" LeFay stopped himself from yelling again, taking a deep breath and waited a moment for the room to stop rolling under him. "Nor do you desire the pain that would come from knowing that man now," he sighed and then lifted his gaze from his desk to a very startled looking Draco.
“Why did we come out here?” Draco asked as he looked down into the courtyard. A few groups of ten seemed to be practicing dueling; magically and hand to hand.
There was a small noise in the door way that drew his attenion jsut as Harry's eyes flickered open. "Snape?" Harry said softly, very confused as to why his professor was standing over him.
“You may continue August,” LeFay stated, sipping on his drink again.
"What is so wrong about that! You can not deny we have a connection, or this," he gestured angrily at the collar, "This would not have stayed on. You said so yourself that a part of Harry was probably what kept this magic alive! You're magic hasn't changed, its stronger now but it is the same, you can not deny it!" Draco roared at him. He was sick of beating around the bush, if anything Lefay seemed more oblivious than Potter was.
"Yea I'm sure. I think I will head back to the dorms though. I'll see you guys later," he told his friends as he started to gather his things. Harry was just about to turn towards the doors when he heard his name called from the head of the table. He froze as the hall became quiet again. Giving a quick desperate glance at his friends he headed up to the teachers table. He stood on the other side of Snape when he got there; far away from the hyena.
Draco glanced around the hall as he made his way forward, taking in all of the detail before stopping directly in front of the throne. LeFay was staring directly at him and Draco could feel the unease he’d had so many years ago. Like LeFay was just waiting for him to make the wrong move so he could devour him.
“Harry, answer the question,” Draco snapped.
“Harry careful,"Remus sighed pitfully as he held his arms out, only to cover his face with his hands, "Your tails,” Remus groaned as he went to fetch a broom.
Tatsuya went quiet, but LeFay could feel the anger rolling just beneath his ancestor's surface. He sighed, knowing they would have to talk about this sooner or later. Now was just as good as time as any.
LeFay had his back to the wall, pinned between it and Severus. Yet, even in that position, LeFay seemed to be the one on the offensive and that Severus was the one trapped.
year yet?” Harry's quick list assured them that he'd already bounced back from his odd appearance.
Days passed without any sign of LeFay, and Draco’s patience was wearing thin. He thought that at least after he was healed, he would be able to catch LeFay to talk to him, but anytime he’d asked to speak to him he’d been refused access. Snape even seemed disturbed by the fact Draco and LeFay hadn’t spoken since the contestment. It was pissing him off, and yea, at first he didn’t want to talk to LeFay. Especially when he realized he’d gone to Cadmael rather than him, but it was past that now. It had been days, almost a week. And while Severus did tell him that LeFay had a lot to straighten out right now, along with figuring out the full connection between Cadmael and Albus but this? This was just too much, especially after they’d fucked like that. Draco wheezed slightly, blush creeping across his chest and covering his face in crimson. Oh yea, that night had been.
The four-year-old wandered over raising his hands to his father, “Up,” he said. Remus reached down and lifted him into his arms, smiling as he started bouncing his son.
Draco? Seve-severus? Those names sounded familiar.
“From the descriptions, probably not much. We just better hope it can’t produce a flame yet if it is a juvenile. However, I believe Professor Snape brought potions just in case that will cover burns,” he let the branch go he was holding back, whacking said Professor in the face. “Hopefully it won’t come to that,” he added and grimaced slightly. “Sorry Professor.”
"Why the tutoring?" Harry asked, confused.
LeFay was about to retort that Tatsuya didn't know Draco as well as LeFay knew him when there was a knock at the study door. Turning his head he frowned. No one else was scheduled for today, at least he thought there wasn't. The arrowhead on his desk glowed for a moment, catching LeFay's eye. "Come in," he said as he swept the arrowhead pendant up in his hand and placed it on his neck. He tucked it in under his shirt and against his skin as the door opened.
He felt pleasure as he answered Draco, “It’s because it’s part of my domain. Kind of like how unicorns can keep it spring for long terms or how frost creatures can keep it cold. It’s just a type of magic that settles around some magical creatures’ domains. Their homes,” he explained, “Now to business."
“Five more minutes,” Bill grumbled.
Snape, being a spy for so long, caught on to the small hints of Albus' distress. He couldn't help the small twitch of a grin at the corner of his lips. "I thought it was the perfect choice. Hyena's are known for there extreme intelligence, surpassing that of chimpanzees, and for there protectiveness of their young and their packs. Not to mention the high sensitivity of their hearing and smell, and the fact that they are extremely agile and strong for their size. I even made sure to procure one that had been magically enhanced for the boy, and the most easy to tame species," Snape explained rather proudly. Let the old coot have a taste of that.
"You swore your life to me, did you not?!" LeFay had no need to raise his voice. Just talking alone held the power to still Snape's heart beat out of fear.
Harry said quickly as he glanced around again, grabbing his wand from his nightstand. “Who’s there!?” Harry called loudly as he got his wand at the ready. Ammit stiffened on the bed and tasted the air, looking around worriedly as well. When he didn’t smell anything, he looked quizzically at his master. Was he going insane?
think I really want him here?! With how much energy it takes to-."
Opening the drawer he started rummaging through it until something on Draco’s desk caught his attention. A purple and black box sat there with a letter addressed to Harry. He glanced around to see if the person that left it was still in his room.
Draco whined, becoming antsy and wanting badly to just get up and run across the room to Harry's side.
Harry let out a yelp as something solid ran into his side and caused him to fall into the wall. Still unused to his fox limbs he toppled over easily and hit the floor with a thud. Something other than Ammit landed on top of him and caused his breath to leave him. Harry was on the verge of blacking out when the heavy object rolled off him followed closely by the sounds of a very angry Ammit.
Draco nodded, understanding. 'He wanted me to know that there is more to him than just what people want him to be, or what everyone says he is.'
LeFay smirked, starting to show fangs, “You sure? I think you’ll find that there's little of what resembles the person you once knew."
Draco stopped at the opening of the showers and sat down. Tripping jinxs? Why would Harry need to do that? Draco had been focusing so much on thinking that he didn't notice Harry had started stripping in front of him. Then the answer to his question was clear. All over Harry's back where scars, some more recent looking than others and it made Draco's stomach churn. Now he also knew why the Golden Boy never took his shirt off during the really hot spans at Hogwarts, and why he didn't sleep without a shirt like many of the other wizards in the dorm did. It made more questions come to his mind about where he had gotten them.
“Albus, raised m-,” Cadmael coughed and gagged for a moment, throwing his arms out to catch himself, “He raised me after my mother died.” Cadmael could feel the bile crawling up his throat as the memories that had been locked away filled his head. The torment, the abuse, the torture he’d suffered under that man tell he was thrown to the side. Till he’d been set up to find Skoll on day as he wandered the streets. Then living the rest of his life with Skoll, those memories were sweet. He couldn’t believe he went back to Albus after that, thinking he owed him. “We stayed in touch after I found Skoll, then when he asked me to follow someone I did it for him.”
Harry and Draco stood at the gates of Hogwarts, along with all of their things. Unlike how Harry thought it would be, neither Narcissa, Remus, or Sirius accompanied them. Since they were legally adults Sirius said they needed to be self-reliant.
“Still not sleeping well?” Sirius asked as he leaned against the center island with a hot cup of coffee between his hands. Harry nodded as he started to gnaw on the waffle in front of him.
Severus bit the inside of his lip for a second. He had to choose his answer carefully.
“I’m not a sheep,” Draco growled, his eyes flashing violet.
Tatsuya agreed, and the two turned from the pensive before heading down the hall to where Cadmael was currently being treated. He nodded at the nurses as he passed before stopping at the foot of the bed. “August,” he said politely, greeting the elder vampire. August nodded at him from his position at the top of the bed, setting down the book he’d been reading.
Bill laughed quietly and then stopped, turning to Harry. Harry stopped, looking up at him slightly. (He just isn’t quite tall enough.)
Et dans le bruit, je cours et j'ai peur
"Thanks guys," he said before pushing his plate away and laying his head down on the table.
"That's amazing," Harry spoke after watching Luna turn back to her witch form. She smiled at them and did a little bow before bouncing onto the bed.
"No one asked you!" Draco snapped.
“I can’t make anyone happy, can I?” Sirius stated as he left the room with a huff. Both Lupin and Harry chuckled as he left before a few taps at the window drew their attention. Remus frowned as he went to open the window for the owl; only to have another one fly through. It landed on the table before dropping the letter, passing by Lupin again in a rush of cool air. While Lupin grabbed the letter from the first owl, Harry was already picking up the other from the dish it had landed on.
Ghost's ears flicked as Harry stroked the porcupine like mane down his back. "How'd you know all this?" Harry asked.
"That is?"
"I was still coming to from being memory wiped and 'sedated' so many times. After Albus died I suppose I had started to emerge, but I don't think I really surfaced till after claiming my titles. Even then it took a few months, and-."
Hate me
“Hmm, it seems your hatchling has come to visit,” Hisashi purred.
"Professor, I'm sorry he-"
Jassis said,
“There’s no need for that,” he sighed, “people will know eventually. They always find out honestly,” he stated and watched a slight smirk form on her face. “I mean, if I can’t hide it from a werewolf I’m sure I won’t be able to hid it from a lot of other creatures,” he added. The woman shrugged and leaned back against the wall.
Thanks,
Harry has to cope with the troubles of his knew appendages as well as the other many changes in his life, and shopping for a new familiar is one of them. Hopefully he can hold on till school starts, or there will be a lot more than just friction between his new family members.
“Well, it looks like Harry might be the only one that can get close to him. I don’t know if that’s him recognizing you, or recognizing your kitsune side. So, it looks like you might be staying here with us,” Charlie stated as the group headed back to the camp fire. “Tomorrow, Remus and Sirius will take Parvati back to the school while we start working on figuring what exactly happened to cause this. Severus, you should stay. If he is recognizing people it’ll more than likely be you two that he’ll end up trusting most.”
"I don't know. I think it just depends on long you've known him," Hermione stated. Luna and Neville nodded, Theo shrugged. Harry stopped at the door to his room and spoke the password before pushing it open..
Hermione smiled at him, though in the back of her head she was worried. Would Harry really pull this off?
Draco has been having some trouble himself, wondering if being this close to another is actually okay. Or if he is pushing his luck.
"Not without you, not with you looking like this. It isn't right!" Draco shouted. He could have sworn he thought he saw Harry smile at him.
LeFay turned, eyes slightly wide.
"Don't fire!" Skoll yelled as the smoke started to clear. There was consistent coughing as the group of werewolves slowly became visible, the circles wands dropping slowly. "We need healers quickly," Skoll shouted as he held his arm, glancing back at his team. "LeFay, its Ammit."
The changes happened slowly: at first the room started spinning and then Draco felt himself starting to sweat.
Tom nodded, “Of course. Speaking of accounts, I’d actually like you to take over a few more.”
"Since my recovery I have started to try collecting my soul fragments, however Dumbledore has beaten me to it. Add on top of it that I was still as mad as before, I suppose I was not thinking correctly. When Lucius faked his family death I knew you had something to do with it and sent Nagini to attack you. It would seem Dumbledore had taken that into consideration and attacked me, first destroying all of my horcruxes and then raiding Malfoy manner. By destroying the items that held my soul they should have vaporated, however, they've returned to me through the grace of Lady Magic while I lay dying," he started explaining, "Dumbledore had made a mistake though, he didn't count on Draco saving you from Nagini. Or Potter saving Draco."
“Where is Harry?”
Draco pleaded quietly as he looked back at Severus.
Rather than Hogwarts being nice and fluffy like Harry thought it would be after having the war over, it has turned out to be extremely stressful. Between Draco sharing a room with him and the new classes, along with the over headed feeling of being watched by everyone, how is any one suppose to focus.
“Some, the mind healers are working as well as they can, and I have August testing out another lead. Something is awfully fishy when it comes to the deaths of his family. Fenrir was a savage, but his own family, it just seems off.”
Harry pulled himself out of the pensive, hands gripping the sides tightly. Albus twisted Cadmael in the same ways he’d done him. Tricked him and then tampered with his memories so all he knew of Albus was the sweet old man persona. He growled low before glancing at the other viles next to the pensive. He did want to look through them, he didn’t have the energy or the endurance too.
Jariss stirred to the front of Draco's thoughts and chuckled. The dragon beneath his skin smirked in amusement as he spoke,
Green eyes hovered in the darkness as the kitsune grinned before devouring the boy whole and vanishing like smoke in the wind. Harry muttered something in his sleep as he rolled over and tugged the covers up higher.
He turned when he heard a soft crack behind him, stumbling backwards when he saw a forest looming there. He looked up at the trees, awed at how tall they were. He swore he’d never seen anything like them. Not even in pictures of the rain forests Hermione had shown him while researching different climates around the world. He tried to look into the forest, but it was dense and too dark to see anything form the outside.
He wished he had more time to become an animagus but he had to do it in the time allotted.
“Hey, I’ll talk to you guys later. I’m feeling kind of tired,” Harry stated and waved at them as he walked over to Draco and Theo. He approached quietly, clearing his throat when he got close. Both went quiet as Draco looked up at Harry.
Wait what?! Draco reversed his train of thought. Did he just admit that Harry bloody Potter was attractive? Only one day and the half-blood was already infecting him. Draco gagged slightly and shuddered. Harry Potter wasn't hot-er attractive. He was a gangly, short, scroungy haired, mangy mutt looking half-blood Draco assured himself. There was nothing attractive about him, not even the stunning emerald eyes that had always haunted him. Especially after he'd almost died.
LeFay glanced around, making sure no one followed before looking up at the large hedge maze ahead of him. In the darkness the deep purple flowers mixed with blue covered the sides of the maze, creating a sense of longing for something when LeFay gazed at them.
Break me
Harry nodded and turned, stopping when he realized the Striped Hyena wasn't following him. Frowning he looked from Snape to Ghost.
"Well I see you've kept almost the same taste in design, and not just your clothing," Draco jabbed as his hip pressed further into the dresser behind him. He glanced over his shoulder at it, looking for an escape route.
LeFay didn't respond.
Draco looked up from his spot on the steps, pillows surrounding him as he leaned his head against the LeFay thrown. “Patience. For how much that man does for you, and how much trust you put in him, I’m sure he’ll come through. Is everyone else here?” Draco murmured in a low tone so that only his mate could hear him.
Harry nodded and then slowly opened the box, his eyes widening. Inside where five rings, each made with unique metals. “There is an order to how you need to put them on, but I think they are in that order already. First is Potter, than Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and after that LeFay,” Remus said as he leaned forward in his seat, pointing to each as he listed them. Harry nodded slowly as he gazed at the each one. The Potter ring resized to his finger as soon as it touched his skin, the gold tinted metal tightening snugly as the amethyst set into the ring winked at him. The Peverell reacted a bit slower to his touch, and then blended with his Potter ring, causing the amethyst and blue diamond to sit side by side. The white metal from the Peverell ring mixed with the gold of the Potter ring, creating an almost fiery white color.
Severus watched him with a calculating graze while Narcissa leaned on the fireplace.
Just then something made a noise to his right and Draco looked up from his day dreaming. A door he hadn't noticed before creaked open; peaking his interest.
******
He could feel the giant fox smile fearlessly, its muscles stretching as the green mouth glowed brightly. The smile turned wicked as Tatsuya appeared before him, green eyes glowing.
"Draco no! If you do that Hades will take the both of you!" Harry was confused, where was that voice coming from?
Harry passed him the jar and watched as Severus tried to put a drop on each of the wounds.
Draco blushed and shrugged; looking away, "He wasn't that bad. I've known worse."
“Well, yes. Unless they are on an approved list of senders.”
Draco couldn’t help the smirk that formed across his face as he pulled the rest of his clothes off, the blush that formed for a moment on LeFay’s face brought him quite a bit of enjoyment. With a deep breath Draco dropped as he concentrated on his other half, skin melting into scales and hair twisting into horns. He blinked as his transformation finished, nose twitching as he looked down at the kitsunes. They were as different as night and day, LeFay with his vat black liquid fur that polled around his feet, massive antlers that dripped with moss, and those forest green eyes and claws. Three tails billowed out from behind him, far more than someone, even with how old he was now, should have. Hisashi on the other side was covered in bright white fur, gold tipped tails and bright golden eyes. A few red markings littered his body, but overall, even with nine tails, he seemed far less imposing that LeFay did.
“Great.” So, he wasn’t going to be close to his mother. He was used to that, but being on the opposite side of the house did make him feel a little vulnerable.
Draco froze. What had he just heard?
Most witches and wizard he met were selfish, purest, narrow-minded, pigheaded, and well there was lots of words he honestly could use to describe them, but here? Here it didn't seem to phase any of them.
'I understand you felt like you didn't get a chance to live your life to the fullest, and I promise you, I will keep looking for a way to separate our consciousness. To give you you're own body, but right now? Right now I need you to let me live my life. Lately you've been tearing the controls right out of my hands and it isn't fair. Just because you don't feel like you got your full life, doesn't mean you can take mine from me.'
It takes a village to raise a child, and that's basically what stories are right?
Snape huffed. “Whatever for my Lord,” Severus sneered.
“The Grim?” Sirius half shrieked. “You mean the Grim is an actual creature?”
LeFay finally let his walls down as Ammit wrapped himself around LeFay’s shoulders, hissing comforting words. LeFay stroked his head, marveling at how big his familiar had gotten. Thinking about him reminded LeFay of just how much time had passed.
“I think he thinks you’re a hatchling,” Charlie hollered. Harry bit the inside of his lip as his cheeks went red.
“Harry, are you okay?” came a worried voice. Harry squinted in the bright light, and looked up at the face of a very worried Remus; Sirius coming close behind him like a worried hen.
Draco stepped in and cleared his throat, holding a vile in his hands. LeFay narrowed his eyes and then motioned for Draco to come over to his desk. "What is it?" LeFay asked.
Ammit watched Harry get on his knees and cheek under his bed.
Draco flushed, embarrassed. Snape smiled before clapping him on the shoulder. “You should get going now.”
“Well, when we did the inheritance test the goblins said I had blocks on my magic. When they removed them my creature inheritance tried to right the damage. Trust me, it was a lot worse before I put on the Lord Rings,” Harry explained and then showed his friend his hand. Neville smiled and inspected them, his attention was caught by the fox one.
“Seriously,” he mumbled as he backed up against the fireplace. Red eyes blinked at him and one of them moved towards him, before he could react, he was pinned to the fire place.
Draco paled and his smirk faltered. He couldn’t bring himself to look up at LeFay now. This might be the real Harry, but what he just said made Draco’s stomach roll. If that’s what LeFay thought, then hadn’t Draco played a bigger part in the way things ended up?
Tatsuya watched over the boy, his thoughts stirring. He moved within the room, his dark silhouette plastered over the walls in the moonlight. ‘This boy, he is special,’ he thought to himself. ‘This LeFay will be like non-other, and I will make him more. This I promise, this I swear...’
Well you better suck it up buttercup :P cause this one is also my favorite child and I also want to work on this one first. But you gotta be fair to your children people. That means equal treatment for both.
He'd started to turn when Draco spoke again, “I am a Malfoy.”
“Honestly," he started slow, "I thought that when I came to full term, it wouldn’t recognize Harry as me. I-We thought its magic would have failed years ago,” he paused, eyes passing over Draco. “However, it seems that wasn’t the case. I apologize.”
There was a loud crash as Harry burst into the glade, his eyes searching for Draco. “Draco!’ he called out. The singing stopped and the smile faded from his face.
Sirius transformed back in the middle of the room and smiled as a huffing Remus came over to lean on him. “Harry, you’re up. We were just about to come wake you and tell you to get ready. So we could head to Gringotts. It’s better to get it out of the way now then later,” Sirius stated with a sly smile. Remus growled.
It was another twenty-five minutes before they were finished, and Harry was standing at the counter, paying for his order. With his glamours in place and his tails hidden away he felt ready for anything.
“Don’t turn away,” Hisashi commanded from his position atop the hill.
Ammit curled around Harry and then placed his head on Harry’s stomach and side.
Twenty minutes had passed before Harry was Harry again. He sat in the middle of the floor with a blanket covering him and a warm cup of tea between his hands. His eyes stared hollowly into the cup as Luna and Hermione exchanged concerned glances. Both had been instructed to stay on the other side of the room while Neville and Theo took care of Harry for the time being. Harry shivered a bit before taking a sip from the cup.
he stated. Harry cringed and shook his head.
“Sirius Black I presume then," Sirius nodded, "We were wondering when you would come to claim the Lord title one you were since you had been declared innocent after Petegrew’s capture. We thought you would have come right after but you never turned up,” the goblin sneered. “Since I am also the Keeper of the Black Vault’s I will be happy to talk them over with you, but I suggest the wills and inheritance test be done before. My name is Baxeka Dragoon. Call on me after." Sirius was confused for a moment before the goblin chuckled, “We are having all of our major vault holders go through inheritance tests, especially those in line for any Lordship.”
Draco’s eyes widened a second, confusion written on his face for just a moment before Hisashi nodded slowly and winked at him, slowly realization enveloped him and he nodded. “Of course, if that's what you wish,” he smirked. He stood slowly once he realized what Hisashi wanted him here for, pulling his robes off and then reached for his shirt.
“I think this one is promising,” he admitted before she could finish, “The photo isn’t blurred, nor does it look altered,” he added. He could hear Severus sigh and knew if he looked the older man would have his eyes closed. “I’ll be leaving tomorrow,” he told them before finishing his tea quickly and heading back to the study. There he would be at peace and he could look more into the area from the picture. He wished with all his heart that this didn’t turn out like the others.
“Wait a dragon? How did it get into the school, or even fit in the school for that fact!” Hermione opened her mouth to comment about the fact the school’s ceilings where well over thirty feet tall but Luna interrupted her.
Harry continued to sit frozen to the spot between his two father-figures, thoughts buzzing around his ears. When he heard what Augusta said he lifted his head sharply, “That makes it sound like he did other things as well,” Harry commented quickly as she started escorting Neville out the door.
Harry stood, turning away from Draco and taking a breath in. "Come one, we need to get you out of here."
When Harry opened his eyes he was standing in the middle of a field. It was waving back and forth in front of him like a golden sea, and it him smile. He hadn’t expected this when kitsune said he’d need to find him.
The man working the desk hummed and looked over the desk at the albino striped hyena, he pulled a bit of a face but then shrugged. “Well, a familiar? That's impressive young man, not many people have a full familiar at your age. What were you thinking?” he asked.
Ammit hissed. LeFay lifted a hand to scratch under his familiar's chin.
"Why leave.” he replied curtly.
Sorry to my unknown lover
"Lucius, I know you-." Narcissa cut herself off as the door opened and Severus walked through.
Harry was running down the hallway, or at least what looked like a hallway. All he knew was that he felt like something was chasing him, and if he stopped. He didn’t know what would happen if he stopped, but the fear running through his veins told him that if he stopped it wouldn’t be good. So, he ran, his feet slapping on the wet ground. He hopped it was water on the ground as he turned and then slipped as he rounded the corner. He stumbled as he heard a loud scrapping behind him, causing him to panic as he tried to get to his feet again. Ahead was light and he ran towards it, panting as he slipped again and something roared angrily behind him.
“I am not brooding,” he mumbled under his breath as he tapped his wand on his suite case, opening another compartment. A house elf popped into view, startling Draco enough that he almost dropped the glass dragon egg replica he had in his hand. “A warning beforehand would have been nice!” he snapped. The house elf pulled at the ends of its ears and bowed apologetically. “Well-ll.”
Sirius, Remus and Harry all proceed to the will reading, only to find out some extraordinary information that they may or may not enjoy. Along with the will reading they all have inheritance tests done and Gringotts with some 'INTERESTING' results.
Harry was wide eyed as well, holding his hand close to his chest as his heart pounded. "No, he didn't. But he surprised me. Why don't you guys just sit on Ron's bed," he suggested. Hermione nodded and then sat down on the bed next to Harry's, Ron eyes the beast warily before sitting down as well. Ghost eyed the two before laying his head back down on his paws. Harry let out the breath he didn't realize he had been holding and then closed the book he had been reading and sat up.
However, these two stories will definitely be continuing and getting new chapters. Yay! When you might ask, well, as soon as possible really. Yet, this fanfiction piece did not have an outlined plot with it like my other one. So, it will probably be the harder one to pick back up, even with it only being 5 chapters long right now. I do want to get a chapter out on my other story first, because it's a month behind this one, before I work on the chapter for this one.
“Isn’t that a bit dangerous?” Harry noted, looking a bit worried. Theo smiled big, flashing a set of almost saber looking fangs.
Draco put the letter down and sighed. Maybe she was right. It wasn’t the answer he had wanted when he had written her, but he definitely had a lot to make up for. Maybe this was a good opportunity?
“I was almost at the Astronomy tower when I turned the corner and saw a group of students standing there, I decided to hide behind the wall so they didn’t see me and wait till they left,” Harry paused as he felt his heart rate pick up, and a building rage in his veins, “That was before I figured out what was happening.”
“I decided to go ahead and let the Malfoy’s live at the Manor.”
It seemed very out of place, and stressed, in the hall. Despite its obvious discomfort, Harry noticed, it still sat patiently as Snape's feet.
McGonagall stood at the gates of Hogwarts, looking out at the camps of former Death Eaters standing just outside of the Hogwarts wards. The students had been safely evacuated to the great hall and all the doors had been locked, but McGonagall didn’t know how long she could hold them back. After the attack on Hogwarts last year, the castle just didn’t have the amount of magic within its walls like it used to. Oh she hopped her former students, Harry, and Snape where fairing well.
“You look hot,” Sirius complemented.
“How could this be happening again?” Harry whispered as the sound of spells impacting neared. He felt a hand squeeze his shoulder and to Draco.
Draco felt Potter tense up beside him and stop. Looking up he then followed the raven-haired wizard's gaze to Ginny who stared back in the same stunned fashion. "Hello Ginny," Harry stated as he started towards them. Hermione frowned at the approach but didn't say anything back.
The room turned silent. LeFay's eyes locked with August first, and the ancient vampire simply nodded before opening his mind. He could feel his Lord sifting through his thoughts. The steps of something more ancient then himself echoing in his mind. He could catch glimpses of his Lord's true form in his minds eye, however, looking directly at him was impossible. Even as one of the few vampires to live as long as he had, LeFay still had enough power to force August's gaze elsewhere even within his own mind. These mind numbing interrogations went on for hours as LeFay jumped from one person to the next, checking everyone for leaks, even ones they might not even know existed. Finally, he stopped, seeming to mull over everything he'd gathered.
Update
It took about an hour for everyone to be ready for the ceremony. Harry stood behind the alter, head slightly bowed. Narcissa was the first to step up to the alter; carrying with her a small bowl with assorted ingredients. Each participant chose six items to burn, each specific to them, and spoke what they wanted to give with their vows. After they set them a flame they would add their blood while speaking the incantation.
It was breathtaking.
“That could kill him depending on how Draco reacted! He isn’t himself remember!” Bill snapped, uneasy when he thought about either Harry or Draco getting hurt.
Harry stepped away from him, his hand covering his mouth.
Harry headed up to the attic after goodnight hugs from his two fathers, he was so happy he felt like he was floating. Grinning stupidly, he closed the attic door behind him and made his way across the room. Soon he’d be turning eighteen and headed to his 8
Augusta looked absolutely horrified and then boiling angry.
Sirius chuckled while Remus shook his head and smiled. It was good to see that Harry was acting normally despite everything. “How about we talk about this in the sitting room,” Remus stated. Harry stumbled as he tried to do just that, earning a snort from Sirius.
LeFay sat on his throne, eyes unfocused. He wasn't looking forward to this discussion, nor what would possible come of it.
Harry nodded and relaxed a bit, the fear he felt slowly turning into awe. “Wait, if you are this old, and have all of your tails, how come I only have three?” Harry asked Tatsuya. The kitsune seemed to be a little surprised but gave, what Harry thought, was a smile.
Harry leaped forward, following the another animagi. Both Draco and Harry hoped that what they had heard really wasn’t something bad happening to the school.
“It’s pretty late, but one more thing before we turn in,” Sirius stated and pulled a small box out. He opened it and then handed Harry a small black ring like Sirius’ but this one had smaller rubies set inside a black rose. “This is the Black Heir ring. As my godson and living blood relative you’re next in line for the Lord Black title. Also, since we've blood adopted you to stabilize your condition while you were out, you're also officially recognized as our son,” Sirius revealed quietly. Harry was speechless as he slipped the ring onto his pinky finger and watched it shrink to his finger size. He felt like bawling. So much had happened… And now he had a real family.
Draco on the other had felt utterly humiliated and at odds with himself as he bounded around like a bloody fawn trying to make Potter feel better. At least he had the showers with Potter to look forward, and being pampered.
Harry but his hand to his chin, “Well, I to make sure he never gets stolen, probably something only I can remove. Oh, and a portkey and protection charms!”
Hermione was bug eyed as she watched it pass.
“For hurting Draco. For not protecting him when I should have. For not trying harder to sever whatever it was between us. I didn’t want him brought into this anymore than you did, I-”
“Wait!” Harry called. McGonagall turned around, looking puzzled.
“What happened with the last people?” Harry asked, ignoring the man’s comment. The store employee shrugged his shoulders slightly before grinning.
"No," Draco said, cutting through the room, "Like you said, you weren't yourself then."
With that the three headed back home to put the last things into motion before Harry and Ghost left for Hogwarts again. This was going to be their one and only chance to get some of these done before Severus took them back. Though, they had made quite a few new plans. Hopefully it all went as planned.
“But we are going to be rooming together! Shouldn’t I know in case something happens?”
'Listen my child', you say to me
Severus gulped, "Sweet Mother, please protect them," he whispered.
“Avada Kedavra!”
"Hurry, the poison is spreading through his body as we speak. Go to the cabinet in my room, take out the phoenix tears, as well as a a vial with 'ANtox' written on the side," Severus breathed as he took the bowl from Harry and started setting everything up. As he looked over Draco's body his face started to pale. As he combed through the fur the amount of bites his godson had taken dawned on him. "FASTER POTTER!" Severus bellowed.
"Draco, I'm sorry. I am so sorry I made you go though this. I am not the Harry you know, and I understand you want to know me, but if you keep pushing this. How do I know you aren't going to decide it's too much?" LeFay said, his eyes tearing up. He really didn't want to open this can but it had to be done.
“She’s sick. What does it matter to you Dean?”
The group woke up shortly after the sun started to peek over the horizon.
“I want to help,” silence. “I want to help look for the dragon and find Parvati and Draco. I know you said I shouldn’t blame myself but it’s my fault for putting both of them in the position that I did,” Harry kept his voice hard as he spoke. There was a moment of silence before Remus and Sirius started talking at once.
Severus nodded and took his seat, a house elf appearing with tea as he did. He thanked the house elf quietly before looking over at Lucius, his face blushing ever so slightly when he met the other man's eyes. "Yes, I do believe I need answers. This is all too confusing, and I know that I know some of it, but not all. Only what Lucius was able to tell me just after the incident."
“Nah, I’m good Theo. You two go do what you were going to do. I swear I’ll be careful,” Harry stated. Hermione looked skeptical but nodded.
Draco was having fun as he chased the poor boy up the stairs and into the dorms, snapping at Neville's heels. They burst into the dorm room, and rather than head for the bathroom like a smart person Neville fled to his bed and pulled the curtains closed around it. Draco chuckled to himself as he rounded the corner of the door, peeking into the area of beds. Lifting his nose he sniffed deeply. Draco grinning, thinking about how scared Neville must be right now; he'd honestly never get a chance like this again right?
Quickly they each did their part, adding their blood and herbs with Severus’ help, and then the potion mix.
Draco pushed back the top of the tomb and froze. "Bloody hell," he coughed as he covered his nose. It smelt like a potion had exploded and spoiled in the tomb. Pinching his nose shut he pulled a vile out from his cloak and popped the top off, pouring it over the rotting remains of Albus Dumbledore. He couldn't believe he was doing this.
Harry glanced around before continuing to unpack his things; working on his wandless magic as he did. He using it to float his clothes to his cabinet and drawers as well as clean areas to set new items up for display. He knew it would take a while before it became the homey room he wanted. Currently, it still resembled his room at the Dursley's, and being reminded of those years made him sick.
“Let’s all get some sleep then,” Remus stated. Everyone agreed and then settled in for the night. Harry however had a hard time. He couldn’t get those treacherous violet eyes out of his head.
“I can’t believe we are doing this,” Draco growled out as he stood there watching Bubo shake out his feathers. His mother flicked him in the head before she turned back to the door and knocked, smiling when it opened. Kreacher looked up at them with narrowed eyes from the doorway before stepping aside.
Harry didn't reply for a moment before his gaze shifted over to Hermione. "I wanted to get a head start to the showers. The guys are water hogs, plus I'm tutoring with Snape today, Dumbledore's orders," Harry replied.
Bill looked at Charlie and they seemed to share a look before Charlie spoke. “I’m not sure about the hissing, but the black blur Harry saw could have been the dragon. Which means it might have taken Parvati. I don’t know why it would unless Parvati’s creature inheritance coincides with its own biology. We’ll have to ask her sister, since they are twins it’s likely they have the same inheritance,” Bill nodded as Charlie finished speaking, scratching his head.
“Just a few scrapes and bruises,” Neville smiled reassuringly. “What was the very last thing you remember doing?” he asked.
"I've had a bit more practice with mine," he stated quietly before he winked at Hermione. There was a quiet rumble as Theo changed places with his creature form, and a loud roar echoed through the room after he did. Sitting in the middle of Harry's room was a Maltese Tiger. It seemed that Theo was so use to morphing back and forth that even his clothes morphed with him. The blue tiger got up and started towards Harry, a low rumble deep in his throat. Harry backed away, unsure of the large creature in the room. Herm on the other hand boldly stepped in front of him, her head and tail held high before she sat in front of the tiger’s path. It stared at her for a moment before rubbing its face against hers and then rolled over onto its back. Tiny Herm took the chance to pounce on the larger cat's stomach. Everyone laughed as the two cats started to play a version of tag around the room, almost knocking over one of Harry's candles.
Then it occurred to him what Narcissa had said. Why would Draco have needed his own room?
Severus understood that feeling.
Harry woke the next day feeling highly refreshed as he stretched. Today was a new day, but a day he would have to do something about what happened yesterday. He had gone straight to his room after the Draco incident, both because he felt guilty and because he felt like Draco had agreed with the ambassadors. He hadn’t spoken to Sirius either. Well it wasn’t only his fault for not talking to Sirius, Sirius didn’t try to talk to him either.
Draco shook his head in disbelieve as he yelled Harry’s name.
Harry's gaze focused, as the realization of where he was started to come back. "Draco? Draco!" he crawled forward and straight into the arms of the blonde, tears spilling down his face.
“It’s saying something about me coming for my mate,” Harry stated, not taking his eyes off the Naga.
Harry smiled, "That must be why he liked Neville's snack bar so much. It was candied lemon and lime." He patted Ghost's side then, trying to get the animal to stop growling. Ghost huffed with every pat and eventually stopped growling but didn't lay his head down. Instead he stood up and shook himself side to side and then jumped off the bed. Harry watched as the albino animal let out a big yawn and started sniffing around the room. "At least now I know what I'll need to feed him, thanks Herm."
LeFay felt an ache in his chest as he thought about it more. He didn’t want to just use Draco, that would be unfair.
"He made me think killing, that splitting my soul would make me stronger. In the end it made me mad and he was able to control my actions. Able to bend me into his toy, his straw-man. Severus how was I so blind?!" he snapped, his knuckles were white as he gripped the bed harder. Severus sighed, sucking in a deep breath as he turned away from the former mad man.
“Lady Malfoy, Mister Malfoy, we’ll see you at dinner,” Remus stated and nodded at them before closing the door.
“It’s amazing,” Harry commented from behind Black as Sirius took the ring and slipped it onto his finger. Almost instantly the ring resized to fit Sirius’ finger and Sirius could feel the power coiling around his wrist and seeping into his veins. The ring was made of a dark metallic substance that he didn’t recognize, with a ruby set into the middle of the ring.
Draco's eyes flicked around the room, the panic starting to break through how groggy he is. That was till he spotted Harry, or what he thought was Harry laying on a bed across the room. Severus saw the exchange and started to stand.
Harry stumbled back, his legs feeling like jelly. That gigantic thing was Draco?!
August clearing his through, "I suggest continuing conversations like these while not in the presence of our host."
The goblin turned their beady eyes to Albus, “It was a matter of personal security for the Potter boy if I recall.”
Draco looked up from the floor, hope sparking in his chest again. "I won't disappoint you. I'll prove that I am worthy to be your
LeFay looked up at him, a small smirk forming, "Thank you for saving me?"
“Did you say something." Draco asked, frowning. Harry had a firey look in his eyes that Draco didn't like. "Harry, are you okay?”
Sorry for the long wait dear readers, but as long awaited, the next chapter. Hope you guys enjoy!
"You've been here too long Draco, you need to leave."
Draco stepped into his room and froze. It was magnificent. “Lord LeFay gave Kreacher orders to try and recreate your room from Malfoy Manor. The other house-elves Master Draco brought over helped as well,” Kreacher explained as he stood at the door. Draco moved over to the bed and set his hand down on the silver comforter before sitting down on it. The whole room was done in silver and white, save for a few items like the dark mahogany wood that made up most of the furniture and green plush rug. He started unpacking his trunk, wondering who this Lord LeFay was.
Draco turned back to the door, his eyes lingering on the room for the moment. He'd just reached for the door handle when it turned and opened, an irritated LeFay standing behind it.
"It's alright. We understand," Severus said as he finished shaking hands with the last healer. He dropped the last few chocolate frogs and flowers onto the table beside Harry's bed, a delicate smile forming on his face. "You're just like Lily. Always had an eye for those damn frogs," he chuckled softly as he shook his head. "You better be thankful when you wake up," he said as he turned to look over the boys sleeping face. He reached up a hand to brush some of the hair out of Harrison's face. The glamours Harry had been using had finally worn off and you could see the full extent of his scar now. Severus had been adding a cream to it so it was only a thin line starting from his bolt scar all the way down to his lips but at least it wasn't red and angry looking anymore. The rest of the scaring across the child's body, along with his false eye, would have to wait.
McGonagall lowered her head.
Draco groaned, he could hear her laughing at him right now. He’d told her repeatedly that it wasn’t like that, but she didn’t believe him. Not for a second, and during the Ball she was even less convinced. At some point he'd admitted to finding Harry attractive during fifth year, but then everything went to shit and Harry had almost killed him if not for Snape. He sighed and continued reading.
Draco the dragon sniffed him, a flash of recollection in his eyes. ‘
“Thank you so much for everything Kristian,” he said and bowed his head. It was Kristian’s turn to blush and she waved her hand in front of her face.
Harry looked between Severus and Draco, utterly confused. His magical core was connected to Draco’s now? “Wait a second, what’s happening now? I mean I didn’t sign up to share a core with someone,” Harry stuttered out. Charlie and Bill looked guilty at each other but remained quiet.
Narcissa’s eyes bulged, “A rather rare inheritance in deed.”
“They don’t care. I don’t know Lord Malfoy well, but Ha-Cadmael. Even if he’s betrayed us I grew up with him for most of my life. He wouldn’t give up on someone he cared for so easily, or just because that someone didn’t see himself the way he did. Monster you may or may not be, but some people can love the monster just as much as the man.” Skoll chanced looking up into this Lord’s eyes. They rolled and stormed with inner turmoil, cloudy and distant as they stared unblinkly back at Skoll. They blinked slowly, looking down at Cadmael a second before turning back to Skoll.
“We! You mean I was, before you decided to go on a rampage demanding we let him sleep longer!” Remus wheezed as he straightened and dusted himself off. Harry was still smiling at the two as they started to bicker.
“M-mate!?” Harry choked. Draco laughed and stood up, patting Harry on the back hard.
Harry continued to stare at Ammit and bit his lip before he leaned back, laying his head on Ammit’s body and curling up with the snake.
Draco looked up, looking around. "No! That isn't what he wishes, Harry come back to us! Please! If you stay here any longer," the voice cracked. "Please, you can't just promise me forever and then die on me."
And all of the things that we had behind
"That's ridiculously cool," Theo grinned and high-fived Neville as he sat down on the bed. Hermione scowled at both the boys before sitting down beside them. Harry snickered a little before focusing his attention on Luna.
Tatsuya spoke. Harry kept his eyes on the two giant ones looking down at him.
“Good, I’ll speak to you after then,” Tom stated, then turned to face the transparent wall as he watched the rest of the participants enter the other room.
“Down,” LeFay stated, gesturing with a tail for Draco to lower himself completely to the ground. The dragon chuckled at the request, his tail flicking as he eyed the small demonic looking fox below him. Did he really think he’d give in that easily. Harry really didn’t know anything about what they were, did he.
"Come on Herm," Harry pleaded.
Ashliegh simply shrugged slowly before going to her seat, sliding into it gracefully. The faerie smoothed back her hair as both William and August glared.
"You know, we are here for you no matter what," she said, and Ron nodded in agreement.
"Hmm, that's not completely true. Spotted hyena's actually hunt for most of their meals, but striped hyena's do scavenge though I heard they eat fruit and small animals too," she stated.
Une dernière danse
"Potter, do you know what a familiar is?" Snape interrupted; a rather vile looking sneer on his face, "Not those pets student's bring in for their classes, but real familiars."
The food appeared quickly after Dumbledore sat, leaving the golden trio at an odds.
It took seconds, much faster than Harry had expected before he opened his eyes. He could feel the fur moving with him as he stared at McGonagall. She seemed stunned and speechless before starting to clap her hands and smile. “Well done Harry!” she continued to smile as she stepped around him, inspecting his ability to change to see if anything was amiss. “Your clothes even transformed with you, very impressive for only two days of work,” she stated.
“What are you freak?”
“My mother! I knew she was up to something!” Draco practically shouted. Both Charlie and Snape snapped to attention with their wands drawn. When they noticed what the situation they put them back into their respective holsters.
That didn't give much help, Harry noted.
LeFay’s brows came together over his eyes in surprise.
Tom's nose wrinkled. "While you have a point, I think mine still stands. The have at least enough 'love' for each other to make you," he stated, making his own air quotes. "Honestly, I'm glad they did."
"Would it save him.?"
Draco's ears twitched, a small smile on his hyena face. 'Night Potter,' he thought to himself before yawning. Maybe this wasn't going to be so bad, though being bonded to Harry as a familiar was definitely bothering him (a bit less than he thought it would though). He really hoped his Godfather knew what he was doing. Especially since now he was stuck with the wizard that had tried to kill him just a month ago.
“Okay. I do, why?” Harry asked as he started setting up his bed so that he would be comfortable. Since kitsune said it would take a long time he wanted to be as comfortable as possible.
Harry's eyebrows rose as he lifted his head from his arms.
"Im saying you're selling yourself short. You're forgetting that the real you was there the whole time, just taking backseat. The moment I saw you again after the war I didn't even recognize you. When we bumped in the hall back at Black Manor that day," Draco paused as he saw Harry close his eyes.
Dans tout Paris, je m'abandonne
“Hi! I’m looking for a collar for my familiar!” Harry said.
“What is it then? if isn’t really about sharing the bed, then what's bothering you?” Harry’s eyes flared. Draco swallowed a nervous laugh before crossing his arms over his chest.
Draco stood on the balcony over looking the training yard. Those below where in the middle of a break, passing out water and food; it astounded him just how well they all worked together. The mix of creatures and wizards below him made his head spin. Those that he'd been taught were dark seemed to be the most common sight but what surprised him most was just how many wizards and witches were helping.
