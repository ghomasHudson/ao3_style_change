“Harry, if you don’t get this weirdo off me in 2 seconds, I swear to merlin..” before he can react though, Ginny has her girlfriend around the waist and is dragging her off.
“You smell so good.” he murmurs, and closes his eyes, a look of pure pleasure on his face, and I practically convulse. He reaches up and tugs the duvet off the bed, then pushes me gently so I fall on to the mattress.
“The tenacious Miss Parkinson. How do you do?” He gives her a small smile and looks amused. “I trust you are feeling better? Draco said you were unwell last week.”
“See you in a minute.” He hangs up the phone and we carry on walking. As we walk past the whomping willow I blush remembering what happened there.
“Yeah sounds good. Now we just have to choose which bedroom is which.” He says and stops at the top of the stairs.
“Of course it was Ron, the lazy bugger.” I say and we laugh some more. “Do you want some lunch, Dray?” I ask him after we have stopped laughing. He nods then I look at Hermione. “What about you two?”
“And a nice young man hasn’t swept you off your feet? I just don’t understand. You’re twenty-one, nearly twenty-two. You’re beautiful.” He runs his hand through his hair again.
I look up and stare at the ceiling seeing carabiners all over placed at odd intervals. I wonder what they are for but again wonder if I want to know. I glance back over the room and weirdly feel that all the wood, dark walls, moody lighting, and oxblood leather makes the room feel kind of soft and romantic…..I know it’s anything but. This is Harry’s version of soft and romantic. The room itself fits in with the old dark feel of the house though.
I grab the box and the mail and head for the door. I turn the last of the lights out and say one last goodbye. To the house and to the ghosts who live there now. Then I close the door to my past and head to my future.
I nod, my eyes wide, my hands on his forearms. I feel so full. He stays still, letting me adjust to the intrusive, overwhelming feeling of him inside me.
Soon enough me and Luna arrive at the doorstep of grimmauld. I closed the floo down the last time I came. I go to open the door but find I can’t bring myself to do it.  This is probably the last time for years to come that I’ll get to enter this place. The place where Sirius hid out with Buckbeak. The place I was going to live with him before he died. The place where the order met to have secret meetings. The place where me, Ron, and Hermione decided we would sleep better on a couch and the floor all together rather than in separate bedrooms, when we were on the run. And where I stayed hidden after the war. This is the place where Teddy had his first sleepover. Where he learnt to crawl and listened to stories about his parents. This is where me and Draco had so many firsts. How could I leave this place?
We go back to the stairs and look left this time. Around the corner was a bit of an open area where a desk could fit, and then there were three doors. Three bedrooms and the main bathroom. Two of the bedrooms were about the same size as the first one we saw and then there was a tiny one. I couldn’t see Nia living in any of these though, then I had a plan. I turned around and went up to the loft.
“Hey, I’m right here. I just needed some air okay. I’m not going anywhere, you’re stuck with me.” I realise he’s crying again now.
“Theo is in construction, magical building not muggle, and my little sister is currently in Paris, looking for one magical creature or another with some grandson of Newt Scamander.” His eyes cloud with irritation. Either he doesn’t like her being there, or he doesn’t like talking about his family. Is it because he’s adopted?
“-The end. Did you like that one?” I ask him and he nods sleepily. “You know which one is our room if you need us, right?” Again he nods and closes his eyes slowly. “Goodnight cub.” I kiss his head and turn the lights out.
“Oh Harry it was beautiful! The sea was so blue and the beaches so white. We went snorkelling and hiking and fruit picking and we saw some amazing things. We even saw some endangered magical beast’s that Luna had told us about. And we got to spend so much time together, it was amazing and so romantic wasn’t it Ron?” She looked at her boyfriend lovingly and he seemed to melt in her eyes.
“Yeah I’ve had fun too. I guess she was right.” He said and kissed me. I kissed him back and things got quite heated. He climbed onto my lap and kissed me deeply. Just as I was about to make a move, his stomach grumbled. I stopped kissing him and looked at his stomach.
I can’t even pretend to put up an argument against that. Of course I would, if he asked me - as long as he didn't hurt me and if it’s the only way to be with him.
“No. Thank you.” I mutter and turn to head to a table. His hand on my arm stops me. I turn to look at him and he smiles.
When she comes back I am just finishing my hair. I’ve not got enough energy to lift my hands for long though and she takes over. She is very gentle with me and massages my scalp.
“What?” She said with a raised eyebrow much like Draco’s but I must admit Draco makes it look much sexier.
My face is on fire and my blood is pumping faster than I would like. I cannot believe...well…. any of that. I step out of the elevator in a haze and hand my pass back to reception and sign out. As I step outside the rain hits me and it’s like I’ve run into a brick wall. What was I thinking? I close my eyes and take a deep breath. The rain cools my skin.
15.16    The Submissive shall take all measures necessary to maintain his good health and shall request or seek medical attention whenever it is needed, keeping the Dominant informed at all times of any health issues that may arise.
“Don’t need to tell me twice, I don’t think I’m ready to meet ferret while he's being all nicey nice.” Ron said and jumped up off the sofa, that got him a glare from Hermione and he held his hands up in defence. “I’m only joking.” He said to Hermione. “Tell her you know I’m joking Harry.”
Then the elevator stops and the doors open. He is off me and away in a blink of an eye, leaving me hanging. Three men in suits stop and look at us. They smirk and climb on board. My heart is racing. I feel like I’ve just run a marathon.
“I’m so sorry Harry, the new girl in the shop blew up a potion and I’ve only just managed to get the shop back to normal. The floo isn’t working either so I basically ran here.” He said, looking sheepish.
My thoughts and my stomach are in turmoil. My appetite has vanished. I stare at my half-eaten breakfast. I’m just not hungry.
“Hey guys! I didn’t see you yesterday, how did the scan go?” Draco sits down on the steps and I tell Nia what happened. She hugs Draco and tells him everything is going to be okay. He hugs her back but I can tell his heart isn’t in it.
He strips out of his PJ pants and climbs in behind me. The water rises as he sits and pulls me against his chest. He places his long legs over mine, his knees bent and his ankles level with mine, and he pulls his feet apart, opening my legs. I gasp in surprise. His nose is in my hair and he inhales deeply.
“It looks amazing in here!” I tell draco. We are adding last minute things like cushions and a mini fridge.
As I started to climb, the ladder creaked which made Draco peak around his shoulder. Then as I was nearing the top, one of the steps snapped and I would have fallen if Draco hadn’t had his wand ready and a spell on his lips.
“I think if i had had another drink, I would have either been naked or on the floor,” i said hysterically, “or both.” I added.
I get to the bedroom with his glass of water and my plain water. I open the door and Draco is flat on the bed asleep. It looks like he has just fallen face first into the pillows and stayed there. I put our waters down on our different sides of the bed and sit down on the bed to take my shoes off.
I’m getting dizzy again from all the flashing lights and the music and colours. Potter is watching me and waiting. I roll my eyes and take a sip.
“Yes thank you, I’m fine. Have you all got drinks?” At that moment Seamus sits back down with three pints and passes one to Harry and one to Dean. We both say our thanks and Dean gives him a little smirk and a wink. Definitely something going on there.
“Nettle soup.” the waitress informs us before turning and flouncing back into the kitchen. I don’t think she likes to be ignored by Harry. I take a tentative taste. It’s delicious. Harry and I look at each other at the same time with relief. I giggle, and he cocks his head to one side.
“Yeah bye crookshanks.” Ron chuckles to himself and Hermione smacks him and pushes him towards the floo.
I glance around it, plotting an escape route. No - there’s still only the door or window. My room is functional and very slytherin. With dark wooden furniture, a big wooden four-poster bed with a canopy and a patchwork green quilt, my mother made me. The walls are covered in band posters, quidditch posters, and photos, muggle and wizard, everywhere. My desk chair is leather and the bed is covered with a variety of green pillows. There is also the bookcase which has a few plants on, adding to the green.
“Harry? What’s the matter? Is Draco with you?” She asked while looking around me and not finding anyone.
“That’s what you fly?” He’s appalled. Taking my hand, he leads me around the corner. “Is it flyable?” He’s glaring at me now.
“I think I know where she is Ted.” I tell him and lead him to the dining room. He opens the door and suddenly these mini fireworks go off and everyone inside yells ‘surprise!’.
“I’m sorry Draco. I didn’t mean anything by it, I just didn’t know what to say. Please don’t block me out. This is my baby as well, I have a right to know what’s happening.” Clearly that was the wrong thing to say because Draco’s eyes turn to thunderstorms and he pushes me aside.
“I shouldn’t have pushed you Harry. I'm so sorry.” He grabs my hand and begins rubbing circles with his thumb.
I’m posting this chapter as a celebration. I’ve finally finished this story. It has 34 chapters and just under 92,000 words. It has taken me a while but I got there.
I find a couple of plates and place them under the warming charm with the pancakes. Harry reaches into a cupboard and pulls out my favourite tea. I purse my lips.
“Oh please do, I've needed the loo for the last half an hour.” Draco just chuckled and held the baby close on his hip.
“Don’t call me that! And don’t come in here and pretend everything is fine! Because it's not okay?!” He says glaring at me.
“Terrified.” She agrees and we both laugh. “Come on, let's unpack some of the kitchen.” I tell her and help her up.
“The only people who call me by my first name are my family and a few close friends. That’s how I like it.”
Day 9 of Draco being overdue. Mrs Weasley and Hermione come round to bring some food and advice. Draco has basically slept for the last 24 hours and I’m a bit concerned, so I called Hermione.
“Why don’t you get the table and I’ll get the drinks? What would you like?” He asks me, polite as always.
“Bye uncle Hawwy. Bye Dwaco.” He runs over to Draco and gives him a hug too. The next thing to happen is just the cutest and my heart nearly explodes. Teddy’s hair starts to turn the whitish blond of Draco’s. Draco smiles down at Teddy and scrubs his hair.
“Because I’m a mess right now, I don’t know why but i am. My emotions are all over the place just like straight after the war and I’ve not got a clue why.  So you’re just going to have to put up with the crying and the mood swings and everything okay.” All his seriousness is back on his face now and I know not to laugh at him when he's like this. Or he’ll go days without speaking to me.
“Great!” Pansy says. “Thank you again, Mr Potter.” She shakes his hand again and still no signs of any shocks. Then he shakes Blaise’s hand, being polite as always.
We walked to the big barn doors and opened them rather easily. It did just look like an old dusty barn inside. There was a rusted tractor to one side and some stalls to keep livestock one the other side.
“About this house. She said we would spend time together and have fun. I don’t know about you but I’ve had fun.” I looked to my right at his face and smiled at him.
We say our goodbyes and head back through the floo. And as expected Draco rushes to the bathroom. I head to the bathroom and stand in the doorway and cross my arms.
“So Harry, what can I do for you?” Straight to the point as usual. I swallow some tea and take a breath.
When we were both sitting I handed Draco a tissue and stroked his cheek. I never liked to see him upset and it hardly ever happened and especially not this bad.
“We thought we would stop by to see how Draco is and how the house is getting on.” Ron says and yawns straight after it.
“But harry, don’t you want me, in our brand new...lovely...house.” He struggled a bit with the ‘lovely’ but got it out in the end. It showed how much he didn’t want to see the rest of this house. I felt bad but this had to be done if he actually wanted a house in the end.
“Okay Draco, next contraction I want you to start pushing okay?” Katie tells him after a couple of minutes. He nods and I can tell when it’s starting because he leans back ever so slightly and squeezes my hand tighter. “Push.” She says and he starts pushing.
I’m coming back up the stairs with both our breakfasts 20 minutes later when I hear Draco in the bathroom throwing up. I rush to the bedroom to put down the breakfast tray and then practically run to the bathroom. By the time I get there though Draco is at the sink washing his mouth out.
I’m overwhelmed with love right now. He thought of this house as our home and heart even way back then. I kiss him with passion then and things are started to get heated, not that we can have sex in Draco’s condition, when we hear a subtle cough behind us and we pull apart. Standing there is an exhausted looking Ron and Hermione with baby rose is Ron’s arms. I jump up and rush over, then turn back and help Draco up. He’s massive now and can’t do much without help.
I am daunted by his kitchen. It’s so big, with lots of muggle appliances. It takes me a few seconds to figure out what I need, and what not to touch. Perhaps I should cook Harry breakfast. He was eating an omelette the other day….um, yesterday at the hotel in scotland. Jeez, so much has happened since then. I check the fridge, where there are plenty of eggs, and decide I want pancakes and bacon. I set about making some batter, dancing my way around the kitchen.
“Draco, calm the fuck down! No it doesn’t make you look pregnant. Nobody will know.” I try to calm him down and walk slowly towards him like he’s a wild animal.
“Daddy!” Ophelia shouts and toddles over to me. We all go in the sitting room and chat about Hogwarts. I send their trunks to their rooms. Scorpius, Sirius, and Leo are in the attack. We converted it into a two bedroom after Nia left to move in with her girlfriend. Ophelia is in the nursery and the other 3 have their own rooms. Teddy crashes on the sofa when he stays over, which isn’t often these days. Who can blame him though, he is 21 now. I’m not surprised he and victoire ended up together. They always played nice growing up. Now they are planning a wedding.
“Draco calm down. It’s not your fault, Katie said it’s common with first pregnancies. If you do everything Katie said and take your potion, then this will all go away and everything will be fine okay.”
“Hey guys.” It is Nia and she is filthy with mud and dirt. I look at Draco and his eyes are going wide. He is looking from the mud to the floor and back. Nia takes the hint and does a quick cleaning spell. Draco relaxes a bit and flips a page in his book, that I didn’t even know he was reading. “Sorry. I just wanted to ask if you could follow me to the back garden for a minute.” She smiles shyly and rubs her hands together. Me and Draco look at each other and then Draco rolls his eyes so Nia can’t see and holds his hands out. I get up and then pull him to his feet. He makes a pained face for a second and holds his back. Then straightens up and starts wadeling over to Nia.
Just as the lesson is coming to an end I hear a pop of apparation. I turn around expecting Hermione but instead find Andy and Teddy. I get up and Teddy runs for his hug. I shush to him and point to Draco who is asleep on the grass.
During the Term, the Submissive will wear clothing only approved by the Dominant. The Dominant will provide a clothing budget for the Submissive, which the Submissive shall utilise. The Dominant shall accompany the Submissive to purchase clothing on an ad hoc basis. If the Dominant so requires, the Submissive shall wear during the Term any adornments the Dominant shall require, in the presence of the Dominant and at any other time the Dominant deems fit.
That is going to be one difficult square to circle. She’s so tenacious, and she wants to know - in detail, and I can’t tell her because I’ve signed a - what was it called? NDA. she’ll freak and rightly so. I need a plan. I head back into the kitchen to watch Harry move gracefully around.
“She’s just in the toilet, she’ll be back any minute.” He looked very nervous and was sweating a bit. Was he ill or was this because of what he had to tell us? Maybe it was a baby after all, dammit Draco’s going to win the bet and rub it in my face.
“Okay okay, I’m sorry.” I hold my hands up in defence. Draco has been really cranky these past couple of weeks and I’ve been trying to stay out the way.  But with the house now complete and the last of the boxes unpacked, there isn’t much to do. Apart from Nia’s lessons which are only a couple of hours each day.
“I’m fine ‘mione. I'll be out in a second.” I don’t even know how long I’ve been standing here. I turn the water off and start to dry myself but I don’t even have the energy for that so it takes me some time to dry and dress.
I eventually get him out of the bath and get him changed for bed. We then head downstairs to have tea. Andy’s waiting for us at the table when we come into the dining room.
“Draco, you must eat.” he chides. “I know a great place half way. We’ll stop there.” He squeezes my knee again, and then returns his hand to the steering wheel as he puts his foot down on the gas. I’m pressed into the back of my seat. Boy, this car can move.
I look at his hand and then at him and wow he is so young and attractive, very attractive. He is tall, with an unruly mess of black hair, and bright green eyes. He is very smartly dressed in a fine grey suit, white shirt, and a black tie. His eyes look at me and it takes me a moment to find my voice.
“It’s an Audi R8 Spyder. It’s a lovely day; we can take the top down. There’s a baseball cap in there. In fact there should be two.” He points at the glovebox. “And sunglasses if you want them.”
“Okay. I’m tired Harry.” Whether he’s saying he is physically tired or emotionally tired I don’t know.
“How did I get so lucky with you?” I ask him and then look at his belly again and kiss it right on the tiny bump. I place my head on his stomach and just stay there for a second. Draco finally relaxes and places his hands in my hair.
He closes his eyes and presses his forehead against mine, giving us both the opportunity to slow our breathing. After a moment, he kisses my forehead, inhales deeply, his nose in my hair, and then releases me, stepping back.
First thing I do is check my phone. It needs charging, so I hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can see my messages. I have four missed calls, one voicemail, and two texts. Three missed calls from Harry…..no voicemail. One missed call from Blaise and a voicemail from him wishing me all the best for graduation.
“Do you think she’ll like it?” Draco asks me over breakfast. He’s been a bit shy about this whole thing for the past week. I think he really likes Nia and appreciates her friendship. She is the first person Draco has made friends with that he didn’t know before the war.
“I’m so sorry Andy.” I deflate and sit down with my head in my hands. Then the tears come. “I’m so sorry I haven’t helped you with all that. I’m sorry I couldn’t help with the funerals. I just couldn’t. But you had to and I should have been a man and helped you. But instead I spend all my time in bed and can’t sleep through the night without seeing one of their faces. Tonks, Remus, Fred, Sirius, Dobby, Severus, Dumbledore, even Colin and Lavender.” I’m really crying now and think I’m on the brink of a panic attack. Then someone coughs from the doorway and I look up.
“Why...how...What did Katie say? How did this happen?” I ask him, just to get it out the way. Draco takes a deep breath and licks his lips.
He increases the rhythm infinitesimally and his breathing becomes more erratic. Harry keeps picking up the rhythm and I can feel my orgasm coming closer.
I remember what he said to me in that stern voice about flying carefully and I remember his intense green eyes almost warning me. And then I realise that I am flying more carefully than usual. I shake my head to rid the memory and lean forward to gain a bit more speed. Forget him, Draco! Although the experience was….interesting, I never want to see him again. I perk up a bit now and really start moving through the air. This is why I love flying, it's so freeing and I can go as fast as I damn well please.
“Oh Harry, I’m so sorry. I really thought it would work out between you two.” She really did look sorry for him and then confused at his smirking.
“And you sir. I will try.” I smile at him. He turns and walks away then, and I turn to the big gargoyle that I visited so much while here.
“I am so sorry. It’s um...written here.” I point at the parchment, while also being distracted by my first name on his lips. My heart starts pumping faster and I blush again. I squirm again and run a hadn through my hair nervously.
“Does that mean you want to get married.” I cheekily winked at him. He shoved at me and attempted to get up, but I took his hand and pulled him back down to sit in my lap.
“Yeah, our son is one now!  And Nia’s finally passed her exams and is currently being sorted into a house. I still say she’s ravenclaw. She read everything I gave her and went searching for more. I still can’t believe how good she turned out to be with potions.” I tell him.
“Wonderful,” Robards said with a large, bullish smile. “Well, I thought we’d start off slow and ease you into some of the responsibilities, you know?”
“Hey mate,” Greg flipped a stained tea towel over his shoulder as he easily popped a beer bottle cap off against a bottle opener fixed to the counter in a practised movement, which he gave to a man on Draco’s left.
It had begun when Greg had got a Muggle job, and Millie ruled that they had to go and be supportive of their friend. It led to a group of wizards dressed (poorly) in Muggle clothes, awkwardly sitting around a table with only tap water because none of them had managed to work out Muggle money that evening. But despite the weird stares they got for Blaise wearing a top hat out on a Friday night in Soho, no one had spat in their drinks or tried to hex them in the toilets, and it had turned out to be the most enjoyable evening any of them had had in a while, so they went again the next week, and then the next, and the next.
Still, he was relieved when Maggie’s father stood up and thanked everyone for coming. Quiet murmurs rippled through the crowd, and people sidled gradually into the aisles, stopping to talk and mingle with other guests.
To his immense frustration, Potter noticed this. His eyes narrowed and he frowned pointedly at the mess Draco had been lying in. “What were you hit with? There were some nasty curses flying around.”
“Yeah,” Draco said roughly, dragging a hand over his face. “Just…” he trailed off, not knowing where to begin with the bubbling, burning anger that roiled in his gut. It all focused on one person in particular.
the come from his stomach? He hoped desperately that there weren’t any incriminating stains, though he probably wasn’t so lucky, as satin was a notoriously unforgiving fabric.
Her shrill voice, so out of place in the quiet solitude of Draco’s shop, was like a bucket of ice water, and cold, hard reality slowly seeped into his bones, weighing him down like cement.
There were rambunctious cheers from the assembled squad as Harry came out of his office, shrugging into his outer cape and buckling up his arm bracers, pulling the strap tight with his teeth.
Draco sat back at his table, holding the coffee mug with both hands to warm his fingers as he tried to think of anything productive he could do. He’d already organised their fabrics by colour and material, ordered their fashion magazines by publication date, and straightened every tie on the shop floor with a ruler. He was running out of ideas.
straight into her mouth from her wand, the snot dribbling from her nose mixing with the tears streaming down her face. It had turned into a group favourite and they often stayed the night at Pansy’s just to have an excuse to get dinner from Peri’s.
“Uh.” Potter’s eyes flicked across the three different examples. Uncertainly, he pointed to the one on the end: black with velvet accents and lots of ruffles.
I see.” He was quiet for a moment and then he said, “I definitely wasn’t, just so you know. I haven’t told anyone about us. I definitely wasn’t spilling the beans in my work meetings.”
,” Draco said under his breath and began to wonder whether the man was having a very public breakdown.
“I thought you wanted me to show off your work.” Harry’s voice was raspy, and his pupils were conspicuously dilated.
It was a rhetorical question — everyone knew the answer already. It was when he’d allowed himself to have an enormous error in judgement and develop a crush on Harry Potter.
There was an owl waiting on the bannister at the stop of the porch stairs of Number 12. It glared at him with its piercing amber eyes and hooted indignantly at being made to wait outside.
deep in his stomach and the world momentarily slid out from under him like an intense head rush when you stand too fast. He gripped the edge of his desk, waiting for the blackness to fade at the edge of his vision.
him, and let him tell Harry that his dress sense was ugly and that he was squandering his opportunities to go to fancy parties.
The whistling of the kettle momentarily drowned out the sniping and grumbling going on behind him and by the time the water reached a steady boil, the conversation had ambled back around to a familiar argument.
kill anyone though,” Theo announced forcefully. He had finished cleaning his shirt and he was now just staring at his reflection, gripping the corner of the sink with white knuckles.
Draco ran his hand over his hair, checking that the gel was still keeping it in place, swooped back to the nape of his neck. It was longer than he liked it, but the thought of the cost of a haircut made his gut clench unpleasantly.
it’s undignified,” he sniffed, and then scooted to where he was told. Against the trunk of the oak, Pansy knelt in front of him and pointed her wand at his chest. “Are you sure you’re qualified for this?” he asked.
Pansy looked entirely unimpressed. “If you’d been paying attention to me earlier, you’d know that I helped deliver her baby last week,” she said coolly.
He dumped Potter’s robes on a free table and checked on his other work. The ugly Christmas robes were hemmed, but the needle and thread had got bored in his absence and had started embroidering curse words in looping, flowery cursive.
Draco pursed his lips. “How about an unlimited budget and I’ll show you the design before I start making it.”
There wasn’t room to argue, and what else could he do? Stand in place and refuse to leave? He was a grown adult, not a toddler. There was a time and a place for a temper tantrum, and it was neither. Slowly, he gathered his things.
That’s what she’d screamed at him at the end of their worst argument and Harry had told her everything he could think of: he couldn’t remember the last time they’d laughed but they yelled at each other four times a day; she hated that he wouldn’t talk about the war or his nightmares; they hadn’t had sex in five months; he’d forgotten their anniversary; they both constantly found reasons to stay late at work and even when they didn’t, their timetables never matched up; he hated the
She popped the olive into her mouth and smirked. “Good point. So, you were saying — Potter pulled you out of the vegetable stand like you were a damsel in distress?”
,” he spat at the empty air and, hating himself, froze hopefully — waiting for a knock on the door or maybe even for him to Apparate straight into Draco’s room…
He hung back as the others drifted from the room. It was the end of their shift, technically, although no one had been paying much attention to leaving times, they were too passionate about the case. The only exception was Ron, who had taken to leaving work with a bag full of case files at exactly the end of the shift, and who returned the next morning with the same files covered in annotations in suspiciously neat handwriting. Harry didn’t comment on the blatant breach of confidentiality; Hermione’s insights were invaluable (and also she would probably murder him with her bare hands if he took away one of her only current intellectual pursuits).
The Healer was very interested in Harry and Draco’s predicament. He made them demonstrate it many times by sending Harry into a room across the hall and having Draco summon him time and time again while he made copious notes. By the time the Healer announced he’d seen enough, Harry felt nauseous and off-balance. He collapsed onto a bed and closed his eyes, taking slow, deep breaths as he tried not to vomit down his top.
He watched a man in the sewing room pull every garment from their hangers, shake them carelessly and then dump them onto the floor in a haphazard pile. Pins skittered across the floor, disappearing under furniture like frightened mice.
“That’s bloody weird to see,” he muttered, then said, “Bill’ll be over in a second. Gah, I hate fire calls,” he said as a piece of ash fell from his hair, streaks of grey amongst the ginger.
Which, obviously, they weren’t. Potter didn’t have feelings for Draco. He had just been under the influence of a curse that left him disoriented and led to poor decision-making. Sort of like being drunk, Draco imagined.
“An excuse,” Blaise muttered blackly from the end of the row. Draco glanced over and saw his expression matched his tone: he watched the Aurors work with undisguised disgust. He noticed Draco looking at him over Millie’s head and his face softened slightly into a pitying frown. “They’ll never leave us alone,” he said.
Draco spotted him immediately, standing at the top of the lawn with Ron and Hermione as well as Luna and George Weasley, and his mouth went dry.
Draco looked at the floor, but the smile that stretched across his lips was probably still obvious from space.
He wore Muggle workout clothes: hideous knee-length shorts in a lurid green and a black vest made of a stretchy material that should have offended all of Draco’s sensibilities but didn’t. His mouth went dry, and he had to tear his eyes away from Potter’s biceps.
“Just the…” She struggled to find the words, her mouth opening and closing soundlessly a few times. “Your general aura lately.”
“So, any progress with the case?” Ron asked as he picked up their plates and slapped great spoonfuls of pie onto each one.
He didn’t properly wake up until he was halfway through his second cup of coffee, which he drank leaning against the table in the break room, looking at a half-finished crossword someone from the night shift had left out.
She was surprisingly heavy. Draco had expected it to feel as if he was holding something delicate, like a baby bird, but the child was quite
that no one had thrown out yet. Absentmindedly, he flicked through the pages, ignoring the stories themselves in favour of dissecting the photos.
“Remind me to give you the name of the company I used, Draco, they’re excellent; they could do wonders with the Manor when you… are ready for that.” He changed the words at the last moment but Draco heard, crystal clear, exactly what he’d meant to say:
Feeling like someone had punched him in the gut, he said goodbye to the Healer (and signed an autograph, then posed for a picture with the receptionist), and Apparated home.
thing these robes need is more personality,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose. As Maggie left, the self-stitching needle began to roll across the table towards the scraps of Potter’s robes. “Don’t even think about it or you’re going in the drawer,” he warned before putting his head down and getting to work.
His stomach dropped as the windows were smashed in. Blaise, Millie, and Pansy jumped to their feet, reaching for their wands and sending their glasses skittering across the table. Wine spilt in dark red pools, turning the white shirt burgundy. Draco didn’t have time to spare a thought for his stained clothes as he dashed to the shop floor where Pansy was standing, spotlighted in the glare of several
They stood on the doorstep of Harry Potter’s house for a long moment that stretched on for too long. Draco tried to raise his hand to knock, but he felt like he’d been petrified.
A memory of Draco taking a Muggle’s coat and pouring a mysterious potion over it before handing it back, free of charge. Harry had thought it was oddly charitable behaviour at the time but he hadn’t
“You can’t!” Naismith spluttered and, foolishly, took a step toward Potter. He had his wand up before Draco could blink, his arm completely steady as he pointed it between Naismith’s eyes. He didn’t have to cast anything, just the threat of being at wandpoint caused Naismith to freeze and then give up, slumping against the wall, his empty hands balled into fists by his side.
“Good thing they got him,” he said as he shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on the coat stand by the door, his nose wrinkling.
A wave of vertigo hit him, so strong that it felt like he’d been clobbered on the back of the head by a mallet. His thoughts emptied from his brain, like a plug being pulled from a bath, and he slammed his hand against the glass divider separating the display of sandwiches from the public as he scrambled for support.
He caught their wands with practiced ease and put them in his pocket, before locking the door with a wave of his own wand.
Greg had already moved on to another customer and he replied distractedly while pouring beer from a tap as someone else shouted an order at him. “In three hours, so maybe?”
He walked the rest of the way on his own at a pace closer to a jog than a walk, his head down and his hands in his pockets. To keep his mind from wandering, he counted the paving stones, then the white lines of the zebra crossing, then his own steps. He refused to look up from the ground, lest he see another blonde man, or someone slightly taller than Harry, or someone who held their nose up in the air in that infuriating way Draco did, and then he’d lose any semblance of being put together. One time he’d seen someone wearing the same shade of blue that had looked so good on Draco that his mind had wandered…
“You’re the best,” she said, waving as she bustled from the shop, leaving Draco alone in the sewing room.
He shrugged. “You always suited Hogwarts. I would have thought you’d want to be in the countryside or the wilderness. Somewhere” — he searched for the right word — “light.”
“You don’t get any more experienced than killing You Know Who, Potter. Even if you hadn’t been an exceptional Auror for the last eight years, we would have considered you for the position. As it stands now, you’re the only person we’re considering.”
The challenge shocked Harry. Lightning bolts of electricity shot from every point of contact between their bodies. Green met grey in the reflection again, and then Harry turned his head to look Malfoy in the eye. Their faces were millimetres apart: he stood on the pedestal behind Harry and they were the same height, he realised dimly. He could feel Malfoy's sweet, cool breath fanning across his lips as he exhaled.
Filled with a jittery, anxious energy that kept him from being able to sit for more than a minute, he grabbed his broomstick, Summoned his flying coat, gloves, and goggles, and headed out to the garden.
A Muggle came out of the men’s as Draco approached, looking over his shoulder with a confused expression that immediately told him there was going to be trouble.
wait for her to pay and catch up with him but it wasn’t a big deal, they’d find each other. He passed the head of the alley that hid the entrance to Malfoy’s shop and stopped dead in his tracks.
He wasn’t sure what he said was true. His parents would have been shocked, but the root of their surprise would have been the fact Draco was introducing them to a man. Once they got over that… His father would have had a few issues to overcome, but he wouldn’t give Draco any ultimatums. He might actually approve of the match, given Harry’s social standing. He’d probably have regarded him as a means to absolve the Malfoy name.
“Hello Rose,” Harry whispered, and had to blink rapidly to stem the pooling of tears. He reached out to stroke his index finger across her cheek: so small and soft as silk. “She’s beautiful,” he said, looking up at his friends, who were both staring at their daughter with beaming pride.
“Ambrose just told me about the raid later,” he said without preamble. He didn’t sit, he was too full of jittery energy to be still.
“The rest of the team will hold down the fort, don’t worry,” Robards rushed to placate him, once again missing the point of Harry’s question.
Even after they’d made up, Draco had been going through his own problems with debts and job hunting, so he hadn’t realised just how miserable Pansy had become until she bounded up to him two years ago, a letter accepting her onto the further education mediwitch training course in her hand. Pansy wasn’t the caring type and Draco, though he’d been happy for her, had privately doubted she’d last a year. She hadn’t quit though; instead, she’d taken to nursing like a duck to water.
He’d resented them for it at first, even after the apologies, but after a few months back in the wizarding world, he understood why they’d acted like that. For all their lives, they’d been on top of magical society — it was difficult to adjust to one where they were at the bottom. The others hadn’t even been Death Eaters, just
“I’ll tell Kreacher. He only made it because I mentioned I was going to see you, so he’ll be pleased.”
“Blimey, Harry, how’d you manage to get so many?” Ron asked, jealousy tingeing the admiration in his voice.
“Come on,” Harry laughed and pushed off the wall. Draco straightened his shirt and followed him out to the garden.
Harry approached reverently. He put the bouquet he’d hurriedly bought from a twenty-four-hour Waitrose on Hermione’s bedside table as he peered over the blankets at the little face. She had Hermione’s dark skin and her eyes, as well as a little fuzz of black hair that peeked out from under the knitted pink hat she was wearing. She squinted up at Harry and burbled.
?” Ron asked, nonplussed. “I mean, we’ve been on plenty of terrible raids. Like that one with the hippogriff in the cupboard — if any raid was going to break you, I’d have thought that would’ve done it.”
They approached the man and Harry began to say, “Draco?” but before he could get the first syllable out, the man turned his face to watch a passing boat and Harry’s heart dropped. He stared at the pavement, trying
Hermione sighed. “It’s getting better, thank God. But there are still some nights where she just won’t settle.”
“Guess I have. Sorry,” he sighed and ran his hands through his bird-nest hair again, “I don’t know what I’m doing here. I should go.”
“I’m good too. Thanks for asking,” he said as the silence stretched on. “I sent an enquiry to MLEP about what happened to Naismith — the guy from the bathroom.”
“Thanks a lot Kreacher.” With that, I gave him a quick nod and went to fetch my clothes. I heard him disapparate and quickly jumped in the shower. It was one of the quickest showers I’ve ever had and when i got out i spelled myself dry including my hair which I don’t usually do as it leaves it more of a mess than towel drying it. I try to tame it with a couple of spells and some gel but that’s as good as I will get it. I finish getting dressed and head to the kitchen to get the bottle of wine I bought for tonight. I grab it and turn around quickly to head to the floo when I nearly slam into Draco and drop the bottle of wine. It smashes all over the newly cleaned floor.
“Only certain things are funny, Draco. I thought you were saying no, no discussion at all.” His voice drops.
“See, I knew you cared.” I shouted down as my heart was beating from the adrenaline of having nearly fallen.
“I’m sorry I scared you Dray. I didn’t know how unready I was for going to the Manor. I should have told you, I’m sorry.” He looks down at me then and frowns.
After she’s gone, I sit and read the contract again, making more notes as I go. When I’ve finished, I fire up the laptop, ready to respond.
“You have already given me those books, which I obviously can’t keep, so just let me pay you back for these.” I smile at him.
“Harry! What the hell happened in here?” Draco asked, a bit hysterical. I kept my head on the floo and just pointed to the cat. “Why is crookshanks here? And why has he destroyed your living room?”
“Right Teddy, go sit nicely on the arm chair.”Andy says and gets up with Leo. Teddy does as told and practically vibrates with excitement.
“Hey dray? How do you feel if we make one of these bedrooms for Nia? I hate thinking of her out there in an old barn. And she’s helped us loads with the house. And she’s trying really hard in lessons. And-“ he turns around and kisses me, presumably to shut me up.
Then all of a sudden I’m being pushed out of the way and tumble down the hill with something on top of me.
“Wow, Draco Malfoy, finally falling for a man, and it’s Harry fucking Potter - hot, sexy, powerful, billionaire.”
“Okay, just a few questions and then I’ll examine you if that's okay.” Draco nods his head so she continues. “How long have you and Mr Potter been trying? And what potion are you taking?” At that me and Draco both look at each other confused.
The next time Leo woke for a bottle, Teddy covered his ears and went back to sleep. But the time after he threw his hand up and sighed. He got out of bed before I could and headed for the door.
“I never said that! You look beautiful and you can’t even tell a difference.” He seems to calm a bit then and takes a breath.
“The estate agency was shut, I’ll go in the-“ he cut me off with a delicate kiss and pushes me back down.
He opens it slowly and stands back to let me in. I gaze at him once more. I really want to know what’s in there. Taking a deep breath I walk in.
“Draco, I think he definitely likes you.” She says giddily. Blaise glazes at her with disapproval. “But I don’t trust him.” I put my hand up to stop her saying anything else, and by some miracle she stops talking.
“No thank you aunt andromeda, my stomach is still feeling a bit dodgy.” He says making an excuse. We will be able to tell everyone in about 3 weeks, so it will be okay then and we won't have to make excuses.
“Maybe I will.” I whisper in his ear seductively. He sucks in his breath and pulls away slightly, only to slam his lips into mine. It's hot and passionate and we’re both so in the moment that we aren’t thinking about where we are or who’s around or anything other than each other. I lift him up and he wraps his legs around my waist and our kissing intensifies. We pull back a bit to breathe and I start kissing and licking his neck while he breaths into my ear. He’s moaning and breathing hard but he manages to speak.
His eyes blaze at me, his challenge intrinsic in his stare. His lips are parted - he’s waiting, coiled to strike. Desire combusts in me and I’m already desperately hard. I take preemptive action and launch myself at him. Somehow he moves, I have no idea how, and in the blink of an eye I’m on the bed, pinned beneath him, my arms stretched out and held above my head, his free hand clutching my face, and his mouth finding mine.
Throughout our lunch we both kept glancing at Nia, who had no clue and when she caught us she would just smile and wave or put the thumbs up.
“Well, the thing is, me and Draco have come across a lost witch. She’s 18 and doesn’t know a thing.” I proceed to tell her about Nia then. After I’m done I throw back the rest of my tea. “So you see, she wants to learn but she doesn’t exactly trust the wizarding world entirely. But she trusts me, so I was wondering if maybe I could teach her at home. I’m not asking for any wages or anything like that, just some textbooks and equipment and of course your acceptance.”
“Fine well, it’s just that you weren’t exactly our first choice to look after him.” I stared at her in disbelief, she was such a snake sometimes but I still loved her.
“No….I don’t think I could ever get bored of this.” I murmur as we fly over a loch. After another minute he answers my question.
“I’m glad you are back in one piece. There’s something about Harry.” she adds quietly, apologetically. I give her a small, reassuring smile - all the while thinking….how the hell does she know? This is what will make her a great journalist, her unfaltering intuition.
“No!” They both blurted. To which Ron added “and who’s Sherlock?” I rolled my eyes and recounted the night for them, leaving certain things out. By the end of it they were both smiling and so was I. I realised I couldn’t wait for the next date.
“Mr Malfoy, we meet again.” He extends his hand and I shake it, while blushing and blinking rapidly. I feel the current run through us again and wonder if it’s just his power and whether it happens to everyone. I’m sure my erratic breathing can be heard by everyone.
“Is this what our, erm…..relationship will be like?” I whisper. “You ordering me around?” I can’t quite bring myself to look at him.
“I don’t care, I’m your boyfriend. Please Draco…” Finally I hear the door unlock and open it wide to see Draco sat on his knees in front of the toilet. I go over to him and kneel down. He’s throwing up again now so i hold his hair out of his face and rub his back.
“Definitely.” I say while looking at him. He’s flushed and clearly wants this so why is he holding back. “Don’t you?” I stop moving for a minute to try and get an answer.
We’ve still got a couple of hours before we need to be at st mungos so if Draco’s still asleep I’m going to leave him for another hour. I head up the stairs and can’t hear anything so he probably is still asleep. I pop my head around the bedroom door but he’s not there. So I checked the bathroom but no luck there either. There’s a chance I could have missed him downstairs though. I check a few rooms on the way down including the library but there’s no sign of him. I get downstairs and head through to the kitchen, which is empty but the back door is slightly ajar. I released the breath I didn’t realise I was holding and set off outside. Draco’s lying on a blanket on the grass with a warming charm over him. He looks so peaceful, just staring at the sky, I decide to not disturb him and just watch him for now. After about five minutes Draco signs and turns his head slightly to look at me.
“Of course I’m coming stupid.” He snorts at me and pulls me towards the door. Then speaks in french to me. “C’est notre coeur et notre maison.” I don’t know what he’s saying but he sounds sexy saying it. Then off we go together holding hands.
“Where did you learn to dance?” I ask tentatively. He turns to gaze at me, his eyes unreadable beneath the intermittent light of the passing street lamps.
“It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me, in all things.” He says and I frown at him trying to assimilate the idea.
17    The Dominant and the Submissive have discussed the activities set out in Appendix 3 and recorded in writing on Appendix 3 their agreement in respect of them.
Draco leaned in, his thumb pinched painfully between his chest and the chair arm and he hissed, pulling back and shaking out his hand. Potter smiled self-consciously and ran a hand through his messy hair.
“I did and then I got stuck in the middle of some Auror raid — hence the baguette and the lateness.”
Robards, but the man was incapable of asking Harry to do anything without Harry’s hackles raising in response.
Remembering their last conversation just made Harry’s frown deepen. He’d yet to hear back from MLEP about the situation with the wizard they’d arrested and he hadn’t had time to walk down to their offices himself now that the team was one person down.
, Harry thought grumpily as he looked at his desk, grateful for once that he couldn’t see without his glasses. At least this way he physically couldn’t read anything; it was a welcome, brief respite from responsibility.
“He’s not,” Pansy said. She was sitting on the other end of the table, perched on the edge of the picnic bench next to Hermione, and had to shout to be part of their conversation. “He’s a fan of Sex On The—”
He shrugged. He wasn’t sure what to do with these adult-versions of Weasley — who offered him tea like he was a welcome guest — and Granger, who asked whether he was okay. He still thought of her as the girl who punched him in the face.
It was twilight, and thick grey clouds obscured the summit of the Peak District hills. Inside the cosy living room with a light rain pattering against the windowpane, Harry could have closed his eyes and been in the Gryffindor common room. The only difference was the bookshelves that lined every wall, stuffed to the brim with more tomes than Harry had ever read in his life and more befitting of a library than a common room.
He zoned out, not noticing the passing of time until Pansy sighed and sat back on her heels, dropping her wand onto the picnic blanket. The sun’s warmth gradually returned, the warm breeze wrapping around him like a blanket.
“Long day?” Harry asked, putting Ginny and Ron’s mugs down on the coffee table for when they came back in.
. Having thought of nothing except Giles Thorne for the last six months, Harry’s team jumped on the new case with gusto. The board in the briefing room quickly filled with photos of potential suspects and a map of all of the mirrors discovered so far, the red threads beginning to spread like tendrils from a vine.
“So this is the thanks I get for taking my granddaughter out to breakfast?” Madam Malkin said as Draco stirred a teaspoon of sugar into his coffee, intently focused on not clinking the spoon against the mug.
being one,” he said, shoving the robes into the bag without the care Harry would have expected from Draco ‘
Someone rapped their knuckles on the Muggle shop’s window and Draco jumped out of his skin, coming back to the present.
“I don’t know how you withstood the indignity,” Pansy said with a sardonic smile. “What Healer did you see?”
“She buys into all that Chosen One shit,” he said, rolling his eyes. “She was already dealing with her life’s work being smashed to bits. I didn’t think it was the right time to break the news to her that her idol is actually a total twat.”
A cruel part of him immediately said it was the latter, but an equally loud and less vindictive part of him said that Potter didn’t seem the sort of person to laugh at Draco for having feelings, even if he didn’t reciprocate them.
“They, er, don’t like me very much,” Potter admitted, glancing around the shop anxiously as if he was expecting the Ministry suppliers to come jumping out from behind a mannequin.
Keeping his eyes firmly on the tape measure this time, he tugged the loop down to Potter’s waist and then his hips. He tried to be as efficient as possible, brusquely announcing the measurements and not even entertaining the thought of mentioning aloud that this man was nothing but
“No wait, let us guess,” Millie said eagerly, fluttering her hands in front of her like a butterfly stretching its wings. She began counting on her fingers. “Someone we know. He’s hot and Draco’s proud of it, but also a bit ashamed.
to write it?” Maggie asked from where she was watching him struggle in the corner as she knitted a scarf.
It didn’t surprise him when the fire turned green, but he wasn’t expecting Ginny to come tumbling out, a bottle of wine in each hand.
“Not if they were Muggles,” Millie said primly, crossing her arms to highlight her cleavage. Blaise’s eyes lingered on it for a moment and Draco could
“I don’t know how much Potter’s told you…” he said, trying not to look over, but Potter lurched forward suddenly, the book falling from his hands and onto the carpet with a soft
would suit — and I’m not quite ready to have generations of Malfoys haunting me for desecrating our ancestral home.”
“I’ve got work…” Draco muttered again, already knowing he would lose that fight — and it wasn’t one he particularly wanted to win.
“Are you sure you can’t? I’d…” He grimaced, as if someone was forcing him to swallow nails. “I’d really appreciate it, Malfoy.”
He thought back to what he’d seen of Potter’s fashion sense; if his Muggle clothes in Hyde Park the other day were any indication of his wardrobe, he was basically a lost cause. “What’s the dress code? It’ll say on the invitation,” he added when Potter blinked gormlessly.
“What does it matter to you? Are you going to conduct a full Auror investigation because I’m up past my bedtime?” Draco asked snarkily, trying to pull his hands away to no avail. “You should let me go, Potter, lest a house-elf catches sight of this and thinks you’re
Weasley returned to the room, precariously balancing three cups and a plate of biscuits that looked suspiciously homemade. He set down a tea on the end table between Harry and Draco’s seats.
That was it. He’d been at Hogwarts, and he was going to visit Hagrid — or maybe Hogsmeade. In either case, he’d been about to leave the castle when someone had grabbed him by the arm, calling for him to wait.
“She’s so proud of you getting on the team,” Harry said. “You should have heard her telling George’s new girlfriend all about you playing for England.”
hopeless,” he protested, but then sheepishly added, “Although your mum might have dropped a few reminders here and there — mentioning the name of a florist, that kind of thing.”
Ron shook his head and jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the briefing room. Harry picked up his coffee from the table and followed him in. “I don’t know how women notice those kinds of things.
His knees rested on the front of the pedestal, and his head was in line with Potter’s groin but he most definitely wasn’t thinking about that. He pressed his thumb against the centre seam of the cheap trousers Potter was wearing, holding the tape measure up to his crotch. Potter had listened to Draco’s instructions and was standing so ramrod straight that Draco could feel his thigh quivering under his touch.
At least he was moving onto the early shift pattern for the next week — he’d been on nights for the last month and the lack of sunlight had started to get to him. Though that was small consolation for the fact that Ron would be going on paternity leave any day now. Not that he wasn’t terrifically excited for his friends, obviously; Ron and Hermione would make wonderful parents and Harry couldn’t wait to meet his godchild, but getting to spend time with Ron was one of the few things that made him look forward to work.
“Robards cleared it,” Ambrose reassured him. “It’s run by a former Death Eater so they want to be careful.”
Theo slapped Draco on the arm, nodded at Potter and then abandoned him. Draco felt mildly betrayed, he always felt more confident facing Potter with back-up.
He quickly located the Snitch and tucked it into his pocket as he glided down to the edge of the woodland. He leant his broom against the fence, looking around the small graveyard with a grimace. It had been too long since he’d made the short trip. Like his mother’s flower beds, the plots were overgrown with an explosion of weeds.
His wand flew from his hand and Potter’s hand flicked out and easily caught it. Draco gritted his teeth and raised his hands slowly, interlocking his fingers and putting his palms on the back of his head. Aurors flocked around him, parting like schools of fish as they began poking around his shop.
He dragged his hand downward, revelling in the anticipation. His fingertips grazed his stomach, before dragging through the soft curling hair at the base of his dick. He was painfully hard already, but he didn’t touch himself just yet. Instead, he caressed the inside of his thighs as he brought his other hand up to his nipples, rubbing the pad of his thumb across the sensitive nubs.
The breeze wrapped around his shoulders. Its strength was weakening — the heat of the sun winning once again — but in its dying breaths, it swirled around him, enveloping him in a hug.
Kingsley made a sound that could have been a scoff, though he quickly covered his mouth with his hand as if he’d sneezed. He cleared his throat and said, “Then let me give you some concrete advice as well: don’t spend too much time alone in this house. Go and see your friends and let them distract you.”
Ron was happy enough to be distracted and he started telling Harry about the cursed mirrors and Harry put all his worries to the back of his mind for another day.
Weasley took a sip of his tea and nodded. “Yeah, he tried a lot of them out on his victims.” He shuddered. “You think this is one of his?”
Carefully, like he was handling glass, he took the baby from Hermione’s arms. Rose grumbled at the movement, but she didn’t cry as he settled her into the crook of his arm, staring up at him silently with her little mouth partly open. As she settled, he remembered the first time he’d held Teddy. How he’d been so comfortable in Harry’s arms he’d fallen asleep, and Harry had been hit by a wave of grief that Remus and Tonks weren’t there that he’d started crying and couldn’t stop until Andromeda took her grandson back because Harry’s shoulders were shaking uncontrollably.
“Glad to see you managed to work out how to dress yourself this time,” he said, aiming for sarcastic but just coming across breathless.
“I would take that trade,” Harry said seriously, thinking about the piles and piles of mind-numbing reports waiting to be reviewed.
Draco laughed brightly and leant forward, pressing their lips together until it was hard for Harry to breathe.
Maggie tucked her hair behind her ear and glanced between Harry and the door. “He finished those a while ago.”
He trailed off, his chest heaving from the outburst. Just to have something to do, he reached for his tea and took a long slurp. Kingsley leant back, one hand cupped casually around the mug while he drummed his fingers on the tabletop. He exhaled — the sound caught between a sigh and a laugh and shook his head.
Compared to the uptight Auror who forced Draco to see a Healer that morning, Potter was unrecognisable. Gone was any hint of self-assured authority, replaced by a man who wouldn’t have looked out of place in a hippy commune. His top was several years old (judging by the holes in the hem and flaking letters), his jeans were ripped, and he was wearing a ridiculous elasticated headband to keep his shaggy hair from falling into his eyes.
“Oh, Malfoy. Hi.” Potter straightened, taking a hand out of his pocket to scratch the back of his neck.
“Here, this would be good for you, it’s the sort of plant that’s happiest when it’s being neglected,” he said, pointing to an envelope of seeds with an illustration that looked suspiciously like plain tomatoes.
A gentle breeze tickled the hair at the nape of his neck, carrying over a low monotonous voice, the words indistinct. He glanced over his shoulder to see that the ceremony had started. The back of Maggie’s lilac head was bowed, and he sighed. “Fine. What’s their fireplace address? I’ll Floo over after the ceremony.”
I enjoy being outside, being busy, and I’m very good at getting rid of Horklumps — ask Ron and Hermione… Also the only other job we could think of that I’d enjoy was a professional Quidditch player, and Wood told me I’m too old to try out.”
?” the Muggle yelped, but the officer grabbed his shoulder and apparated away with him before he could get the rest of the question out. The other man took Naismith and Disapparated with a
“Morning,” Ron greeted through a yawn so wide Harry could have counted every single tooth if he’d wanted.
“I know it’s here somewhere,” she muttered and then crouched down, disappearing behind the sofa and calling, “Aha!”
He opened his mouth to ask Parkinson about it — maybe she could provide a little more history — but the elevator doors slid open and the reception area, though quiet, was still bubbling with activity.
“Sure,” Maggie said in a placating tone that clearly emphasised that she thought he’d lost his marbles. “Who was that?”
She smiled down at Rose and the realisation struck Harry that it could have been his child in her arms in the living room at Grimmauld Place. Harry would lounge around in pyjamas (but just the bottoms because Ginny always stole his tops because they both liked how she looked in his too-big clothing) and watch his wife dance around with their child with a smile on his face. Like everything about Ginny, the fantasy was easy to imagine, but it was like turning on a random channel and watching a movie from the middle when you didn’t know the characters or have any attachment to them. It was a nice vignette, but nothing more.
“Fuck’s sake,” he muttered, the words strangled by the lump in his throat. He crossed back into the wizarding half of the shop front, where Millie had righted mannequins and was busy gathering all the robes. She’d charmed a broom to follow her around, sweeping up shards of glass.
“Really?” she pressed. “I know you wanted it when you were sixteen, but that was ten years ago. It’d be normal for you to have changed your mind.”
He frowned at the set of robes in mismatching fabric (one of which looked suspiciously like a child’s princess bedsheets) and said dumbly, “We agreed on black?”
“They’re dress robes, they have layers. You should try to stop complaining about them so loudly, you sound like an oaf.”
“There are children, Pansy,” Draco interrupted sharply as a few catcalls broke out further down the table.
“Draco.” For the first time, he noticed Malfoy’s purple haired colleague seated behind the till. Presumably she’d been there the whole time and it would probably worry some of Harry’s fellow Aurors that he’d completely failed to notice her. He’d also forgotten her name again. “Don’t worry, Mr. Potter, we’re still open so you didn’t keep us waiting.”
Malfoy?” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “She might need both of us to work out what’s going on. Will you come?
The alcohol thrummed in his veins, taking the hard edge off the world. Everything seemed a little fuzzier, and if he looked at anything for too long, it began to spin. He was clearly drunker than he’d realised.
He’d changed into a different outfit: grey trousers and an olive green jacket with cuffs that gripped his wrists tightly. He kept his shirt sleeves rolled down. There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky which meant that the park was crammed with scantily clad Muggles, sunbathing on towels or playing games that were all centred around throwing and catching an assortment of different shaped objects. No one spared him a second glance as he passed.
He had a bowl of cereal for lunch — food that required minimal preparation — and then went to his bedroom, like a teenager on his summer holidays. He didn’t think about work once as he lay on top of his sheets, listening to music on his gramophone at an obnoxiously loud volume and flicking through gossip rags. He caught up with the shenanigans that had occurred on the Weird Sisters’ latest tour and the rumours that Celestina Warbeck had secretly been in a decade-long relationship with a woman.
“I’ll see you in September, Potter,” she said. “Term starts on the 1st. Remember, you’ll need to be at the platform to escort the First Years.”
He ducked his head, unable to continue to meet her gaze. “It wasn’t really a conscious decision; I honestly couldn’t tell you.”
“I…” What was his point? The ticket was still in his hand and he held it up lamely. “I wanted to see the robes.”
He wouldn’t be doing that this time. He’d rather throw himself into Hagrid’s pit of Blast-Ended Skrewts than admit his new obsession to any of his Slytherin friends.
“If you want it to be a thing, I suppose I could go along with that,” Draco drawled, but his tremulous smile possibly gave away his true feelings on the subject.
It wasn’t a big deal if Draco hated him, he told himself. It was, in fact, a completely normal state of affairs. The way life
“I don’t like your tone, Margaret. Do you know how much others would pay to have my advice? I run the most successful robemakers in London, no one else even comes close. And I built that shop from the ground up, you’d do well to listen to my advice if you insist on this harebrained scheme!.”
He dropped his keys into the bowl by the door and pulled his robes off and kicked them into a corner of the entrance hall. He made it to the kitchen before doubling back and picking them back up, brushing away the dust bunnies with a sigh. He was being stupid. It wasn’t like he was going to need to wear them anymore — he could burn them and no one would bat an eyelash, but something stopped him and made him hang them neatly on the back of a dining chair.
The man noticed Theo’s attention wavering and spun to face Draco, wand out and pointing right at his chest. His face was vaguely familiar — thin and framed by a bad haircut — and Draco realised it was the man from the bar who’d called him a twat.
His ideas from the weekend were unstructured and incongruous: a sleeveless outer robe on one page, followed by a dozen different ideas for cufflinks for the cuffs that didn’t exist yet, most of them scribbled out. Around one of his later attempts were annotations for possible tailoring charms that would work well with the fabric and achieve the impact Draco was aiming for.
. That train of thought wouldn’t take him anywhere good. He went back to counting the fence posts and thinking of a job he could do once he got home to keep him busy for the evening. He’d weeded and pruned the entire garden until three o’clock in the morning the previous night, waiting until he was on the verge of passing out before collapsing into bed. Now
If he closed his eyes, he could already see the stack of files building up on his desk: new cases, old cases, ongoing cases… His office threshold would be covered in memos and reminders and requests for meetings, accumulating like layers of snow. It never ended. Of course, it was always fine once he got there and started going through it but until then, the dread would ruin his rest days.
The Minister of Magic smiled and entwined his hands in front of him. “Harry,” he said, his deep voice reassuringly casual. “May I come in?”
“Are you making coffee?” Maggie asked apropos of nothing, looking up from her needlework. She was embroidering tiny flowers to the bottom of a white dress for a baby’s dousing ceremony; her work was beautifully delicate, which was surprising given the constant stream of curse words that had flowed from her lips for the past hour.
“No— Well, sort of. He’s dumbfounded. I don’t think he can comprehend the idea that you might not want to be an Auror — he’s sure it’s some kind of protest about the Malfoy raid.”
Draco had stopped leaning on the table. He stood in the middle of the room, every muscle tensed like a fledgling about to fly for the first time.
Screaming starlings in the evergreen outside his window woke him. His pyjamas were damp with sweat. Feeling no more well rested than before he’d gone to sleep, he dragged himself up and got dressed.
I have one final person to thank for this fic, and that's you. Thank you so much for sticking around until the end, and I hope you enjoyed reading it even half as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Granger and Weasley sat next to each other on the three-person sofa. Potter was in the armchair closest to the fireplace and he pointedly didn’t look up at Draco, his attention focused on the book in his lap. There was a baby lying on Granger’s chest, its face resting against her breast, and Draco remembered Pansy’s comments about the birth and felt his face heat.
“What were you thinking of?” Harry asked, putting a hand on Draco’s dick. Draco saw his other hand move between his own legs and he stroked himself as he just held Draco.
“This is Auror Potter. I need a MLEP officer at the men’s bathroom of Bobby Simmonds bar in Soho. The situation is under control: one male is under arrest,” he said to the stag, who then jumped through the wall and disappeared.
He handed it back to the Healer who stuck it in the milky white potion and stirred it around for good measure. Draco looked repulsed, and Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from pointing out that they’d already swapped saliva many times. The Healer halved the potion into the two empty vials and gave one to Harry and one to Draco.
It wasn’t enough, she was already fishing her wand out her handbag. Startled, Draco subtly glanced around them.
He spotted the Snitch in under a minute, glittering in the sunlight behind the tallest of the hoops. With no one breathing down the back of his neck, it was almost too easy to chase it. He surged forward, his robes snapping in the wind behind him. He pulled his elbows closer to avoid knocking them on the metal hoop as he threaded the needle and caught the snitch.
. He wondered whether Harry could see his heart racing because it felt like it was about to beat straight out of his ribcage.
had he not just left Draco alone? Draco’s expression during the raid had made it clear that he wanted Harry to die on the spot, and their conversation had only made those sentiments more obvious. But Harry couldn’t stay away.
He had never hated his fair skin more than in that moment because he knew his blush stood out clearer than sunburn.
“Anyway. I need to head to work,” he lied. He’d just come from work, and Malfoy knew that, but he didn’t call him out. “I’ll just leave these in the changing cubicle? Okay? Great, see you round, Malfoy.”
His friends weren’t too bad, he decided as he grabbed the broom. The Muggle door opened with its accompanying buzz and he heard Theo’s booming voice.
Draco shrugged and dug into his chicken, savouring the explosion of spice that burned his mouth so pleasantly. He’d never admit it aloud, but Muggles knew something about cooking. Maybe wizards could take a lesson from them.
“Does he?” Ron said, frowning as he went to stand next to Belinda. Harry crossed his arms over his chest and shifted his weight from foot to foot, looking uncertainly between the two. Ron’s lip curled in bemusement, and he squinted at Harry. “Looks like he usually does to me.”
“Nothing,” he snapped and marched over to his table, reaching for something to do only to remember he’d finished all of his tasks hours ago. He picked up his coffee cup and went to wash it up by hand in the kitchen sink. “If anyone else comes in, you’re dealing with them.”
The next time he let it go, he waited a full five minutes. He spun lazily in a small circle, nearly lying flat on his broom handle, one arm dangling into the air below. It was terrible Quidditch form — the kind of lackadaisical posture one could expect from the Hufflepuff team practice — but no one stood on the ground, shouting critiques up at him, so he couldn’t bring himself to care.
He heard Pansy snort mirthlessly. “As if you could scare me, Potter. And it’s not me you should apologise to.”
Due to the patchy layout of public fireplaces connected to the Floo Network in London, he got to Hyde Park an hour later than their agreed time, sweaty and irritable after the long walk from the Leaky Cauldron. A picnic in the park had been Pansy’s idea. Draco had sulked about sunburn until she promised they could sit in the shade of a tree and told him to stop being a crybaby, at which point he relented for the sake of his pride.
. I refuse to take your word for it,” Draco sniped and pushed the robes towards him again, but Potter didn’t move to pick them up this time. He glanced between Draco and Maggie, rubbing the nape of his neck.
“Well, yes, and no. The woman has now testified under oath that Madam Malkin paid her to put in the tip. Some family squabble, from what I understand.”
Potter glared at him. “Oh right, of course, because you’re the poster child of humility and modesty.”
“I’d be honoured,” he said. Although casting basic tailoring charms on Millicent’s outfits for free wasn’t his idea of fun, he knew he hadn’t been a particularly good friend recently. He owed a few charitable acts to keep the peace.
care about,” he said, quieter now. His voice was devoid of any emotion and he forced his face into a scowl because without it, he might just look very, very sad.
The spell that hit him was lightless and soundless. In fact, if it hadn’t lifted him from his feet and thrown him into a display of artisanal pickled vegetables, Draco wouldn’t have known he’d been hit by anything at all. At least he hadn’t been the target, for once; it was a simple case of bad luck — wrong place, wrong time. The wrong place being Underborough Market and the wrong time being the morning of the Aurors’ attempt to capture a serial killer.
I glance at Pansy, and she grins, her eyes bright and wide. She’s delighted. Pansy Parkinson, show some dignity!
“It’s fine Andromeda. Please, let me help.” I tell her and walk towards them. I hold my hands out and she passes me Teddy.
Why does he have this effect on me? I know I always blush easily but with him it’s every time I look at him it seems. Maybe it’s his overwhelming good looks, or the way his eyes blaze at me, or the way he strokes his index finger against his lower lip? He’s doing it right now and I wish he would stop because all I can think of is his lips and I’m blushing again.
We exit the hotel and head to the nearest alleyway to apparate. He doesn’t speak, doesn’t even mention the outburst of passion in the elevator. Maybe I should say something? Should we even talk about it or should we pretend it didn’t happen? It hardly seems real, my first proper kiss. As I think more about it, I assign it mythical, Arthurian legend, Lost City of Atlantis status. It didn't happen, it didn't exist. I definitely imagined the whole thing. No. I touch my fingers to my lips and they are still swollen from the kiss. It did indeed happen. I want this man desperately and he wanted me.
“I’m profoundly grateful and touched by the great compliment accorded to me by the professors of Hogwarts today. It offers me a rare opportunity to talk about the impressive work of the environmental science department here at Hogwarts university. Our aim is to develop viable and ecologically sustainable methods of farming for third world countries, magical communities and muggle; our ultimate goal is to help eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe. Over a billion people, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, live in abject poverty. Agricultural dysfunction is rife within these parts of the world, and the result is ecological and social destruction. I have known what it's like to be profoundly hungry. This is a very personal journey for me….”
We get to Andy’s, and Teddy is as excited as ever to see us. He’s practically jumping off the walls when we tell him we can take him to the park today. His hair is changing all sorts of colours and he’s jumping up and down clapping. Andromeda silently mouths a ‘thank you’ to us and goes to get his coat. When he’s calmed down a bit his hair stops changing colour and goes back to the blue he likes so much, thanks to Ginny and Luna.
I’m standing in the doorway, wide-eyed and wary, my arms wrapped around myself. I step forward, while surreptitiously admiring his physique. I take his hand, and he bids me to step into the bath while I am still wearing my underwear and his shirt. I do as I am told. I’ll have to get used to it if I’m going to take him up on his outrageous offer….if! The water is enticingly hot.
It’s been 2 months since mine and Draco’s anniversary of a year together, and 2 months since we had the devil cat over to stay, which means Draco has been in my life now for 14 months. Yet he still hasn’t been to any of the family meals at the burrow. Molly and Arthur have been inviting him since practically the beginning, but he always squirms his way out of them. He always has work to do or plans he has made or people he has to see. But next week is Ron's birthday, and Molly has planned a birthday party at the burrow and invited everyone, including me and Draco. Draco is friends with Ron now, well as good a friend as they are going to be, so he can't say no to this. I’m going to casually slip it into conversation tonight when I go over to his. I told him I would come over for tea tonight because he always comes to mine, so hopefully he will be in a good mood and say yes. I already talked to Narcissa and she told me that he didn’t have any plans for the date of the party. So he has no excuse to say no really.
His bedroom is vast. The windows are ceiling-height and look out across London, and there is a balcony attached. The walls are white, and the furnishings are oak. The enormous bed matches the furnishings and has four posts but no canopy. On the wall above it is a stunning painting of a quidditch match; the snitch flies past with two players following and then all of them out of sight, then it starts again.
“Well today is all about you.” He tells him and pinches his cheeks to which Teddy giggles. “And maybe not everyone will be happy.”
2   The fundamental purpose of this contract is to allow the Submissive to explore his sensuality and his limits safely, with due respect and regard for his needs, his limits, and his well-being.
I read it a couple of times and then place it back down. Draco wipes the tears from my face and kisses my cheek. We just sit there for a minute in silence. I don’t know what to say and I feel a bit down.
“He could laugh in my face and leave me.” I mumble mostly to myself but she hears me and elbows me in the ribs.
“She said that it’s very rare but it has happened before in cases involving one or more very powerful wizards.” He looks at me and raises his eyebrow at me. “So this is all your fault really.” He turns back around and gets comfy in the crook of my arm.
“That sounds very philanthropic. Is it something you feel passionate about? Feeding the world's poor?”
“Weirdo.” He declares and chuckles to himself. I smack his shoulder playfully and then smirk at him. He’s gonna get it now. I pin his arms above his head and put my lips to his stomach. Before Draco can do anything I’m blowing raspberries on his stomach and he’s howling with laughter.
“Yeah, Katie said I might be sick when I’m in labour.” He wipes his forehead and looks up. “Sorry about the mess. I’m not fast these days.”
“So Nia, you seem a lot better than yesterday. How are you taking it all?” I ask her in a friendly voice. I don’t want her to close up again like yesterday.
“Harry, is everything okay? Draco walked off and he looked like he was crying.” He rings his hands nervously and looks worried.
“Yes I’m splendid thank you.” Draco mumbles but carries on walking. I dry him off with a quick spell and give him a kiss on the cheek.
“He’s right, Ron never puts sunscreen on and he always burns. He hasn’t put any on today either.” Hermione says and hits Ron. “You are meant to be setting a good example.” She hisses at him.
“No, Draco. I don’t do the girlfriend, or boyfriend, thing.” He says softly and peers down at me. He has a half smile on his face. I frown. What does he mean by that? Wait….does this mean he is gay...or bi?
I blink at him. Holy shit…..we are going to go through each of these points one at a time. I just don't feel so brave face-to-face. He looks so earnest. I steel myself with another sip of my wine. Harry continues.
“Suppose I’ll have to now, thanks Molly.” He winks at her so she knows he’s joking and everyone laughs again.
“Yeahhh.. I may have done a bit of drinking while you were gone.” I laugh nervously and shrug my shoulders.
“It may take a moment for the results. If your stomach glows yellow, it means you are pregnant. If it glows purple it could mean something serious and more spells would need to be performed. If it glows green, then nothing is wrong there.”
I swallow. I feel my cock hardening. But I can’t have this. His most potent weapon, used against me again. He’s so good at sex - even I’ve figured this out.
“Fuck you into submission.” She shakes her head disapprovingly. I blink rapidly at her, and I feel the blush as it spread across my face.
I shrug, feeling thrown by his sudden interest. Move to London with Pans, find a job hopefully in publishing or potions. I hadn’t really thought about it much. I just want to get through my finals.
“He’s complicated, Pans. You know - he inhabits a very different world to mine.” Great excuse. Believable, too. Much better than: He’s got a Red Room of Pain, and he wants to make me his sex slave.
“Don’t call me that.” He scowled but blushed anyway. “Fine let's give it a go then, it's not like you can give it back anyway because SOMEONE didn’t read the contract.” He said while glaring at me. I held up my hands defensively and looked around innocently. That made him giggle wetly. He wiped his face and I gave him a quick kiss and took his hand and we walked back up to our new house. We stopped at the front door and I gave his hand a quick squeeze while hearing him take a deep breath.
Suddenly we both become aware of voices in the hall outside his bedroom door. It takes a moment to process what I can hear.
As I’m heading out of London I still feel embarrassed and confused. I think about the answers that Mr Potter gave and how cryptic they were. It always seemed like there was something left unsaid - some hidden agenda. I’m still cursing Pansy for not giving me a brief biography. And those questions about adoption and whether he was gay! I shudder, remembering but I’ll deal with her when I get back. If I ever see him again I think I may die of embarrassment. Damn Pansy Parkinson!
His long fingers reach around to gently stroke my cock, slowly circling the sensitive head. His breath is soft against my face as he slowly nips me along my jaw.
“Yes please uncle Harry!” Draco comes out of the nursery with Leo then and holds his hand out for Teddy. He runs the rest of the way up and grips Draco’s hand.
“Not with all this noise.” I say to Leo and blow raspberries on his belly. He screams with laughter and throws his head back. Draco laughs at us and we head back around the front.
We both must fall asleep then because next thing I know it’s pitch black outside and Draco is snoring softly.
I shake my head and strip my remaining clothes. I get in the shower and let the water cascade over me. I welcome it and for a moment I forget everything that happened last night, and I forget about Harry Potter. Then I remember him. All of him. And I want him, really bad. I want Harry Potter. I want to go to bed with a man for the first time in my life. I want his hand on me and mine on his. I want to taste his lips and have them taste my whole body. My dick is hard again and this time I grab it. I start to stroke softly at first and keep thinking of him.
“I can't stay long today Andy sorry. Draco’s not feeling very well so I’m taking him to see a mediwitch later, but i want to get back to be there for him.”
I get up out of bed a minute later and try to find my jeans. I’m bending over, looking under the bed, when I hear the bathroom door open. I jump up and nearly fly into Potter, who has a towel wrapped around his waist and is glistening wet from the shower. He is certainly surprised by my little show and I blush. I’m all bare legs and awkward gawkiness.
“It’s okay, I just told that woman over there the same thing.” I sigh with relief and then we both laugh.
“You don’t need to worry Harry. His body is probably telling him he’s ready and so he needs the rest.” Hermione tells me after we all settle down with a cup of tea.
“Pushover.” He says under his breath which makes me laugh. “Healer bell said we can find out the sex when I’m about 18 weeks gone, but…”
We had both silently decided not to do anymore to the house today. We weren’t in the mood anymore. Everything Nia had told us was awful, of the things she had gone through being so young. And everything we had had to relive to tell her about the war just seeped the happiness out of the house. I looked at my watch and it was 4:20pm, then I looked over to Draco.
“Draco! You’re back!” Pansy shouts from her spot on the floor. She is surrounded by books and has her laptop open in front of her. She’s trying to teach me how to use one but the phone was hard enough and I’ve not cracked it yet.
“I can't call it little avocado though.” He frowns and thinks for a second and then his face lights up. “So simple. Chéri! Sounds like cherry and means ‘darling’.” He grins wide and I giggle.
Sorry it's late guys, I've gone back to college this week and I've just not found the time. I'll try to upload every Friday but I apologise if it's late. Thank you again for all the kudos and comments! x
Holy shit, what is this about? What does he want?  I walk through the doors with Potter and his...security?...following.
“My mother is wonderful. My father, not so much. She supports me through everything whereas he doesn’t even see me as a son sometimes. My Godfather practically raised me.”
At 12 o’clock his contractions are every 10 minutes apart and are getting really strong. He’s tired and sweating and cursing.
Harry Potter just swore at me. I laugh at him again. “I’m in a pub in Scotland...far away from you.”
“It’s okay Draco. You’re pregnant, you have an excuse to act out. I had no excuse to act the way I did and I should have been there to support you. I’m sorry.”
“Ha, I doubt that. He practically offered you a job.” She says and looks up at me. I blush again and get up and practically run to the kitchen to get away.
“Not me, that’s for sure… but I am so so so glad you are in my life, like this, now Draco. I love you so much. I don’t care what anyone thinks and I don’t care that we were on different sides of the war. I don’t care that we constantly tried to kill each other.” I chuckle at this and he’s looking up at me now. “I don’t care about the past, just our future.” I learn down and softly kiss him.
No doubt he thinks I’ve succumbed to Mr Potter’s dubious sexual habits. Not yet, just his exceptional sexual habits, or maybe sex is like that for everyone. I frown at the thought. I have no comparison, and I can’t ask Pansy. That’s something I am going to have to address with Harry. It’s perfectly natural that I should talk to someone - and I can’t talk to him if he’s open one minute and standoffish the next.
“Draco Malfoy. I’m studying English literature with Pans, um….pansy….um….Miss Parkinson, at Hogwarts.”
After finishing our lunch, we headed back to the house to get back to work on Nia room. Tomorrow I’ll have to ring the window guy, look at the furniture catalogue, and find some paint. All after Nia’s lesson. Then I will ring Neville and see when he is free. I think this bedroom will take another week or so just to finish cleaning and get the windows in. Then we will have to paint with the colours she likes and then get the furniture in. And hopefully it will all be done by her birthday.
“Definitely. Would you like to sleep over at our new house tonight Teddy? We decorated a room all for you.” He says kindly. Teddy lights up a bit, sniffs and runs to hug Draco’s legs.
“I didn’t take anything! I swear Harry! I didn’t do anything!” He’s starting to cry again now but I’m still in shock and don’t know what to say. “Please Ha-Harry. Say something.” He hiccups while crying.
“Your aunt and Teddy really want to see you. Are you up for it?” He nods and I guide him back into bed.
“I just don't.” He reaches over and plants a soft kiss on my forehead. “So, that email was your idea of a joke.”
“Thank you so much Harry! Thank you!” He pats my back and releases me. I wave them goodbye with a smile and head to the closest floo.
“Tit for tat is not my usual style, Mr Malfoy.” he whispers as he gently blows up and down my cock. “But you’ve pleased me today, and you should be rewarded.” I hear the wicked grin in his voice, and while my body is singing from his words, his tongue starts to slowly circle the head of my cock as one of his hands holds the bottom of it and the other hand holds my hip down.
I go back to my bedroom and switch on the laptop. There’s an email from Harry from late last night or very early this morning, depending on your point of view. My heart rate spikes instantly, and I hear the blood pumping in my ears. Holy fuck….maybe he’s said no - that’s it - maybe he’s cancelling dinner. The thought is so painful. I dismiss it quickly and open the email.
4    The Dominant and the Submissive each warrant that they suffer from no sexual, serious, infectious, or life-threatening illnesses, including but not limited to HIV, herpes, and hepatitis. If during the Term (as defined below) or any extended term of this contract either part should be diagnosed with or become aware of any such illnesses, he undertakes to inform the other immediately and in any event prior to any form of physical contact between the parties.
He moves his finger in a wide circle, stretching me, pulling at me, his tongue mirroring his actions, around and around. I groan. Then he takes me into his mouth and it’s too much….my body begs for relief, and I can no longer deny it. I let go, losing all coherent thought as my orgasm seizes me, wringing me again and again. Holy fuck!  I cry out, and the world dips and disappears from view as the force of my orgasm renders everything null and void.
The next week goes pretty much the same. Me and Draco go to the house, or ‘Notre coeur’ as Draco keeps calling it, and work on the house until lunch. Then we go to ‘whipped’ and have our lunch. At 4 o’clock Nia joins us and helps clean. Around tea time we send Nia on her way back to the barn and lock up. We go to Andy’s most nights for tea but one night we went to Molly’s and one night we spent at mine. Then suddenly it’s Friday and Draco is 11 weeks pregnant. The next scan is tomorrow and I can’t wait. We get to see what the little cherry looks like this week Draco said.
Weasley has bought me new black jeans, a pale blue T-shirt, new converse, socks, and underwear. They all fit perfectly and the jeans are amazing. They make my arse look great. I briefly feel weird that Weasley picked all these out but soon forget about it.
“I don’t have any idea yet.” He chuckles into my neck again. We are still swaying together to the music. I have my eyes closed and am just thinking about Draco and the baby. We are in our bubble again even though I can hear the laughter and voices of the rest of our family.
After about an hour and a half we landed, Draco in victory. We were both out of breath and our adrenaline was still pumping.
“Draco?!” He doesn’t answer so I make my way upstairs towards our bedroom. On my way past the bathroom, I can hear the tap running so I knock on the door. “Draco? You okay?”
“Yes you are. And I’ve got lots of friends and family to go to when I’m sad. Just like you.” He smiles and we sit there rocking for a little longer.
“I cannot accept these from him. I'll send them back to him tomorrow….with an equally baffling quote.”
“Aargh!” I cry out as I feel the stretching sensation deep inside me as he takes my virginity. He doesn't stop until he bottoms out and then he gazes down at me, his eyes bright with ecstatic triumph.
“Are you smoking again?!” She shouts down the line. Shit, well I was trying to be discreet. I take another drag and ignore her. “Draco, I thought you’d quit for good this time. You were doing so well. How long has it been?” 8 months since I last quit. I always end up starting again, but I too thought that was the last time.
I head through the crowd and know I am going to throw up at some point in the next ten minutes. I don’t feel steady on my feet and my head spins. I make it outside and take a big breath of cool air. My vision is fucked up and I’m seeing double of everything. I feel so sick. Why did I do this to myself?
“Babe...come on. Let's go to bed.” I nudge him, but he doesn’t wake up. I sigh and smile at him. Bloody lazy fool. I get up slowly without waking him up and then pick him up gently. He gives a little intake of breath and then huffs it out and wraps his arms around me.
Greg has always been a friend and it’s really nice to talk to someone normal in this moment with the rich, powerful, awesomely off-the-charts attractive control freak Potter.
“Forget about the rules. Forget about all those details for tonight. I want you. I’ve wanted you since you fell into my office, and I know you want me. You wouldn't be sitting here calmly discussing punishment and hard limits if you didn't. Please, Draco, spend the night with me.” He holds his hand out to me, his eyes are bright, fervent….excited, and I put my hand in his. He pulls me up and into his arms so I can feel the length of his body against mine, this swift action taking me by surprise. He takes the bobbles out my hair and then runs his fingers around the nape of my neck and threads his fingers through my hair. Then he gently pulls it so that I am forced to look up at him. He gazes down at me.
“Harry…. I know everything hurts but if you don’t speak to someone soon then you never will. Everyone is so worried about you. Andromeda says Teddy has been crying for you and she misses you too.”
Next time I come up the stairs is with Katie in tow. Draco is having another contraction and I rush to him to hold his hand.
“Leo is too young Teddy, but I can push you while he watches.” Draco says and Teddy nods. I get Leo out his pram and hold him in my arms so Teddy thinks he’s watching, but he’s fast asleep anyway.
“Did you hear that Harry?! He called me uncle Draco!” I smile back and put my arm around his shoulders.
“Anyway, did you come here for a specific reason, Hermione or just to tell us off about wrongly accused sexism.” I shot her an annoyed look. She just turned and smiled at me and then said,
“Blaise! Great to see you...and alcohol.” I stare lustily at the firewhiskey in his hand. He chuckles and pulls me into a hug. He is a lot taller and muscular than me and I am suddenly wrapped around entirely by him. Blaise is a fellow slytherin and is also gay, so we clicked instantly. Also our fathers know each other and have gotten back in touch since we became close. Blaise stayed on at Hogwarts university too but he does engineering, although his real passion is photography. He mainly does wizard photos but with a push from Pansy he has been developing his skills with muggle cameras. The pictures don’t move but they can be just as beautiful.
We both glance down at the bed at the same time. It’s covered in stains. It seems Harry cast a cleaning spell on just us and not the sheets. I blush.
I wake up from the best sleep I’ve had in awhile, part of the reason why is because Draco has been right next to me all night. I haven’t opened my eyes yet but I can feel his warmth against my side and I can hear his shallow but steady breathing and I can smell the ridiculously expensive shampoo he uses.
I blow Pansy a kiss and head out the door to find professor Mcgonagall. Even though we are adults now, we still have to inform Mcgonagall on our comings and goings, for safety or some shit.
“Does she know youre here?” He asked. I've not realised it but we have started walking up the stairs already.
We step out onto a grey flagstone patio area lit by recessed lights in the rocks. There are shrubs in grey stone tubs and a chic metal table and chairs set up in one corner. Harry walks past those, up some steps, and onto a vast lawn that leads down to the bay….wow - it’s beautiful. There are lights of a town or city on the horizon and the cool, bright May moon etches a sparkling silver path across the water towards the jetty where two boats are moored. Besides the jetty stands a boathouse. It is so picturesque, so peaceful. I stand and gape for a moment.
“Andy it’s okay. I understand and I’m sorry we sprang this on you. We were just excited to tell the two of you.”
I know he comes to visit every Halloween but he can’t today unfortunately. You see, his fiancé Draco is giving birth to their son, your grandson. So I decided to come for him this year. I’m sure he’ll be along soon, just wait for him.
He comes to stand in front of me. He puts his hand under my chin and tips my head back, staring down at me. His eyes are intense as he examines my face. I realise that I’ve not seen his naked chest before. Instinctively, I reach out to run my fingers through the smattering of dark hair on his chest to see how it feels. Immediately, he steps back out of my reach.
“It's all my fault, it’s all my fault.” I repeat to him, barely even recognising he's there while crying and struggling to breath.
I run into the bathroom and grab a very quick, very cold shower. Great, I’m going to look like a bloody mess with no sleep. That will for sure put Potter off me, if he even liked me to begin with.
I tell her everything McGonagall said, about how it could take up to a week, we would have to see her for monthly meetings, and how she can try the hat on if she wants. She wasn’t too keen on that one though but hopefully we will get there.
“Good thank you aunt andromeda, how are you doing? And hello Edward, nice to see you again.” He winks at Teddy and gets a giggle out of him.
“Whatever.” He huffs at me and finishes walking in the first room. I follow behind slowly so I can avoid anything he tries to throw at me if one of his mood swings happen again. I round the corner and look around the room. It doesn’t look too bad in here actually, it's a bit dusty and needs new windows but overall it's adequate (that’s all  Draco’s rubbing off on me that i know words like that now)  for the first room. I look over at Draco and he nods once and leaves for the next room. I quickly jot down some things i'll need for this room and what i can put in here and then get the tape measure out for the windows. As I’m doing that I hear music start to play, a piano if I’m correct. I stand up and make my way through the house to one of the rooms at the back. The melody is soft and sweet, I feel like I’ve heard it before. I walk into the room quietly and see Draco sitting across the room at an old piano. He’s played for me before but not very often as I don’t have a piano at grimmauld and I don’t go to the manor a lot. He plays beautifully and I do love watching him. It's like he forgets about everything and lets his mask slip away. All he knows and sees and feels is that piano and those notes, and it's extraordinary. I don’t know how long I’ve been standing here leaning against the door listening but it seems like an eternity and yet only minutes. His music pulls me in and again i feel like i know this tune, he's probably played it for me before.
“Relationships like this are built on honesty and trust,” he continues. “If you don't trust me - trust me to know how I’m affecting you, how far I can go with you, how far I can take you - if you can’t be honest with me, then we really can’t do this.”
“So that means Teddy and his grandmother got closest with James!” Ginny says looking at the board and Teddy jumps up and high fives her.
“He’s with Molly tonight, I’m afraid we won't be staying late though. Need to get back to my baby.” Angelia declared proudly. We carried on chatting for a bit and then Hermione comes out of the bathroom looking slightly green. This could also indicate she’s pregnant or it could mean they are both sick.
“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. You do know that, don’t you?” His tone is earnest, desperate even, his eyes impassioned. He takes me by surprise.
After a few more minutes of chat, I finish my cup of tea and head to bed. I wrap myself up in my mothers quilt and instantly fall asleep. That night I dreamt of bright green eyes.
“I have a family. I have a brother and a sister and two loving parents. I’m not interested in extending my family beyond that.”
I could gaze at him all day, but I have needs - bathroom needs. Slipping out of bed, I find his white shirt on the floor and shrug it on as well as my boxers from last night. I walk through a door thinking it might be a bathroom, but I’m in a vast walk-in closet as big as my bedroom. Lines and lines of expensive suits, shirts, shoes, ties, and robes. How can anyone need this many clothes? I tut with disapproval. Actually, Pansy’s wardrobe probably rivals this. Pansy! Oh shit. I didn't think about her all evening, and I was supposed to text her. Double shit. She is going to kill me when I get back. I wonder briefly how she’s getting on with Theo.
“Good evening, Draco.” His voice is cool, his expression completely guarded and unreadable. The capacity to speak deserts me. Damn Pansy for letting him in here with no warning. Vaguely, I’m aware that I’m still in my joggers, unshowered, yucky, and he’s just gloriously yummy, his pants doing that hanging from the hips thing, and what’s more, he’s here in my bedroom.
“Yes, they do have a certain resemblance to your partner.” She chuckles, obviously speaking about the hair. “What’s his name?” She smiles at Leo.
“Sit,” he commands, pointing to the plush sofa, and I do as I’m told. He sits down beside me but doesn’t touch me.
“Yes please. I need to get an appointment TODAY.” I couldn’t stress that today enough. “My boyfriend has been being sick for a few weeks now apparently and he’s been very down lately too. He’s always crying which is not like him. I’m very worried. He's not eating and is very stressed.”
“Don’t let grandma hear you say what?” Andromeda came into the hallway and inclined her eyebrow at us.
Sorry it's late, I was on holiday. I've done my best to edit any mistakes. Hope you like it. Thank you for all the kudos and lovely comments. X
When we get back to grimmauld, we do exactly what I said. We have a sandwich and a fruit salad and sit and watch tv. After 20 minutes Draco is fast asleep, curled up on me. So I decide to take a nap with him. He’ll be fine tomorrow, I’ll make sure of it.
“I think you’re clean enough now.” he murmurs, and he stops. What! No! No! No! My breathing is ragged.
I turn my head to look behind us and in the distance can see Hogwarts. This thing moves fast in the air.
“Keep still.” he warns, his breath warm against my skin. Reaching my navel, he dips his tongue inside, and then gently grazes my belly with his teeth, carefully avoiding my cock. My body bows off the bed.
The first thing I notice is the smell: leather, wood, polish with a faint citrus scent. It's very pleasant, and the lighting is soft, subtle. The walls and ceiling are a deep, dark burgundy making the spacious room look enclosed. There is a large wooden cross like an X fastened to the wall facing the door with restraining cuffs on each corner. Above it is an expansive iron grid suspended from the ceiling, eight foot square at least, and from it hang all manner of ropes, chains, and glinting shackles. By the door are two ornately carved poles hanging like curtain poles across the wall. Hung on them are an assortment of paddles, whips, riding crops, and funny looking feathery implements.
“Fuck me Harry, please.” He practically begs. I press my clothed member against his back while at the same time grabbing his. We both moan and Draco tries to push back against me at the same time as pushing forward into my hand.
“No.” I am so not backing down on this. No one is going to dictate to me what I eat. How I fuck, yes, but eat…..no, no way.
He motions for the waitress and asks for the check. Once he’s paid, he stands and holds out his hand.
“Yes, a child. The fourth case this month. If only people would get the vaccination.” She shakes her head sadly, and then smiles. “I'm so glad our children never went through that. They never caught anything worse than chicken pox, thank goodness. Poor Theo,” she says as she sits down, smiling indulgently at her son. Theo frowns mid-chew and squirms uncomfortably. “Harry and Luna were lucky. They got it so mildly, only a spot to share between them.”
He reaches for a bottle of body wash from the built-in shelf beside the bath and squirts some into his hand. He rubs his hands together creating a soft, foaming lather, and he closes his hands around my neck and starts to rub the soap into my neck and shoulders massaging firmly with his long, strong fingers. I groan. His hands on me feel good. I am instantly hard.
After I’ve sat Draco down in the front room with a cup of tea, we go to leave. Then Ron stops and looks at Draco and then Rose.
He passes me a cup of hot water with the tea bag on the side. He remembers. I like to watch the water turn colour and know exactly which colour I like it. I instantly put the tea bag in and start to watch the colour drain from the bag.
Harry is standing by the window, wearing the grey flannel pants that I love, the ones that hang in that unbelievably sexy way off his hips, and, of course, a white linen shirt. Doesn't he have any other colours? Music sings softly from the wireless, something about witches and wizards.
“Everything, I want everything. I want you to fuck me and I want to fuck you.” My hands are on his chest and getting lower by the minute.
“Hey! Where do you think you’re sneaking off to?” I say while yawning. Why’s he trying to sneak out like the morning after our first time.
“Are you ever going to tell me what that means? I could just look it up you know? But I’d rather you tell me.” He smirks and then puts his hand on my chest and grabs my hand to place it on his chest.
“Oh, that reminds me.” He takes the digital camera I got him for Christmas out of his robe. “Let me take a photograph of you.” I roll my eyes at him and he snaps a few pictures after having to be reminded, again, how to use the camera.
“Love, let's just get it over with and then we can go back to mine and I'll cook you your favourite meal and we can watch whatever you want on tv and do whatever you want for the rest of the night. How does that sound?” I offered with a pleading tone.
“Oh Andromeda, you must hold him!” Narcissa says and comes over to place the baby in her sister's arms.
“Of course, darling. Draco, it’s been such a pleasure. I do hope we meet again.” She holds her hand out to me, her eyes glowing, and we shake.
“What if I am ill Harry? What if I’m dying?” Then he breaks down completely and falls forward into my chest. I put my arms around him and rock him gently.
After that, Greg ignores me and goes to sit in the corner with his drinks. At five I am out of the door, pronto.
“Are you ready?” He asks and I just hold on to him tighter. He chuckles and revs the engine. Then we are off. It is slightly bumpy and with the force of the engine I hold on even tighter to Harry, if that were possible.
“Nothing. I’m fine, I just got a bit of dust in my eye... I saw this piano in here and just wanted to see if it works.” He stood up and closed the piano and then attempted to move past me. I scuttled in front of him before he could get out the door.
“You’re very quiet, and you’re not even blushing. In fact I think you are the palest I’ve ever seen you, Draco.” He murmurs. “Are you hungry?”
She sniffs then and carries on. “But I walk into your new home and I see light and the future. I see children laughing and parents loving. I see family and friends celebrating life.” She chuckles and sobs at the same time. “That’s what a home should be, Harry. Not this prison. Besides, it’s not like you have to sell the place. It will still be yours but just empty of people. The ghosts have taken this place now.” She’s quiet then and I think she may have left so I get up to go after her.
There are several papers inside the envelope. I take them out, my heart still pounding, and I sit back on my bed and begin to read.
He cups my chin again and starts to kiss my throat as before. Oh….he’s so frustrating. His hands run down my body and over my nipples as he reaches the dip at the base of my neck with his lips. He swirls the tip of his nose around it then begins a very leisurely cruise with his mouth, heading south, following the path of his hands, down my sternum to my nipples. Each one is kissed and nipped gently and sucked. Holy crap. My hips start thrusting into the air, moving of their own accord, grinding to the rhythm of his mouth on me, and I’m desperately trying to remember to keep my hands above my head.
“Open it then!” Pansy says excitedly as she heads into the kitchen to grab our celebration champagne.
My mouth presses into a hard line. This is what I cannot reconcile. Kind, caring Harry, who rescues me from inebriation and holds me gently while I’m throwing up, and the monster who possesses whips and chains in a special room.
“And you are….” He says in a warm but possibly slightly amused voice. His expression stays impassive and so it’s hard to tell. He looks mainly polite and mildly interested.
“Stay down here, I’m gonna see what’s up there. I don’t want you going up there and the thing caving in.” I said and moved towards the rickety ladder.
“Blaise, you know I can never stay mad at you for long. Just don’t pull that crap again.” I slap his arm.
I stare at myself in the gigantic mirror above the sinks. Do I look different? I feel different. I feel a little sore, if I’m honest, and my muscles - jeez, it’s like I’ve never done any exercise in my life. You don't do any exercise in your life. I tell myself. So you’ve just slept with him, given him your virginity, a man who doesn't love you. In fact, he has very odd ideas about you, wants to make you some sort of kinky sex slave.
“Whatever! Don’t fucking lie to me, lets just get this over with.” I sign and follow him downstairs to the floo.
His hands are really gripping my hair. I can do this. I push even harder and, in a moment of extraordinary confidence, I bare my teeth. It tips him over the edge. He cries out and stills, and I can feel his warm, salty cum oozing down my throat. I swallow quickly. ugh….I’m not sure about this. But one look at him, and I don't care - he’s come apart in the bath because of me. I sit back and watch him, a triumphant, gloating smile tugging at the corners of my lips. His breathing is ragged. Opening his eyes, he glares at me.
That’s when I hang up the phone. He’s such a downer. And he still didn’t tell me about the books. I frown. Well I succeeded in one mission tonight — getting drunk. Holy shit, did I just drunk dial Harry Potter? My phone rings and I almost drop it. Witches and wizards around are looking at it strangely.
Molly has invited us over for tea again tonight and  we gladly accepted. Cooking is just not on our list of things to do right now. And Ron will be there, so we will try and get Ron and Hermione only at some point and tell him.
“I don't have a computer. I usually use the ones at school. I’ll see if I can borrow Pansy’s laptop.”
“You were right, I am tired.” Draco whispers to me and then yawns. I chuckle softly and kiss his head.
“Maybe I don’t want you to go home just yet.” I smirked at him, “maybe, just maybe, we could end this horrid, awful, gruesome ,” I lifted my chin and did an impression of him just a minute ago, “date...on good note.” We were very close now and as he looked up through those long blonde lashes, he blushed deeper and turned his face away.
probably not. Harry Potter is not famed for his sense of humour. But I know it exists, I’ve experienced it. Maybe I’ve gone too far. I wait for his answer.
“Merlin of course, I forgot about that. How far gone is she now?” I lift Leo up and try to pat down his unruly hair which is just like mine bar the colour. I’m glad it stayed the same colour as Draco’s, and I’m glad his eyes stayed the same as mine. He’s a bloody gorgeous kid. I hope Draco wants more children soon.
“It doesn’t matter. We are having a good time at the moment and I don’t need to complicate things with my ‘feelings’.” I use air quotes at her when saying feelings, to which she just rolls her eyes.
“So you want me to fuck you again?” he whispers in my ear, and he begins to trail featherlight kisses around my ear and down my neck. My cock unexpectedly gives a twitch, not knowing if I could go another round.
“Hmm maybe I have.” We walked the rest of the way mostly in comfortable silence still holding onto each other.
15.17    The Submissive will ensure that he procures contraception potion and ensures that he takes it as and when prescribed to prevent any pregnancy.
“Well Potter, it's been a pleasure. Next time, I’ll definitely be choosing where you take me.” He insisted and i stood in shock for a minute, and without thinking blurted out,
The mood shifts entirely and I can see his eyes softening and even a trace of a smile on his beautiful lips.
“Sorry.” I squirm in the chair and feel like an errant child. I glance at the paper and try again. “Have you had to sacrifice family life for your work?”
“He totally did.” I wink at him. He laughs some more and slaps my arm playfully.  “There’s a lot to celebrate tonight.” He says then and sighs happily.
“Feel it, baby.” Harry whispers in my ear, and very gently grazes my earlobe with his teeth. “Feel it for me.” My legs are pinned by his to the side of the bath, holding me prisoner, giving him easy access.
“You know it’s going to be good, don't you baby?” he whispers. I close my eyes as my cock starts to come alive.
I’m panting loudly. All I can concentrate on is his voice and his touch. Nothing else is real, nothing else matters, nothing else registers on my radar. His fingers slip into my boxers and he sucks in a breath of air.
I apparate me and Teddy back to andromeda’s after a couple of hours at the park. We fed the ducks and splashed in some puddles, then we walked around the park, which me and Teddy nicknamed the flower park because it's covered in flowers all around. After that I pushed him on the swings and then we sat on the pier with our feet dangling. It definitely took my mind off things.
Suddenly, the room erupts into applause as Miss Pansy Parkinson takes the stage. McGonagall sits, and Pansy tosses her lovely long hair behind her as she places her parchment on the lectern. It took Pansy years to grow her hair out from the bob her parents insisted on.
12    the Submissive will make himself available to the Dominant from Friday evenings through to Sunday afternoons each week during the Term at times to be specified by the Dominant (“the Allotted Times”). Further allocated time can be mutually agreed on an ad hoc basis.
We apparate to the house and as soon as we land, Draco pushes away and runs around the house. I go after him to find him being sick near a bush.
“No it definitely was not. Wait and see.” Then Draco turns and spots me. “Oh Harry! Come watch me beat weasels arse at chess.” I go over to him and sit on the arm of the chair and wrap my arm around his shoulders.
“Can I eat my sandwich now?” Draco asks, ruining the moment. Me and Nia just chuckle at him, and she hands him the sandwich.
“I won’t disagree with you there.” I say and take his hand while he’s still laughing. He won’t be laughing soon, he’ll probably be being sick in about 5 seconds. 5....4….3….2….1. And off we go.
All thoughts of hotness and naked bodies have gone out the window and let go of my wilting erection. Fuck sake!
“We will be arriving in a few minutes.” Harry says and suddenly my heartbeat accelerates and adrenaline spikes through my system. He starts speaking to Weasley again but I stop listening. I feel faint. My fate is in his hands.
Later on when we are all sat down, the drinks start coming out. Leo is sitting in the middle of me and draco in a high chair, with a party hat on. He is giggling at Teddy across the table, turning his face into animals. Nia is on one side of him and Andy is on the other side. Nia is killing herself laughing at Teddy. Narcissa is on the other side of Andy. While Ron and Hermione are next to me. Everyone else is scattered about.
And I can’t touch him. Well, no surprise there. And these stupid rules….No, no, I can’t do this. I put my head in my hands. This is no way to have a relationship. I need some sleep. I’m shattered. All the physical shenanigans I’ve been engaged in over the last twenty-four hours have been, frankly, exhausting. And mentally….Merlin, this is so much to handle. As Blaise would say, a real mind-fuck. Perhaps in the morning this might not read like a bad joke.
Seeing him on his knees in front of me, feeling his mouth on me, it’s so unexpected, and hot. My hands stay in his hair, pulling gently as I try to quiet my too-loud breathing. He gazes up at me through impossibly long lashes, his eyes a bright, scorching green. His hands travel up and undo my button on my jeans, and he leisurely pulls down the zipper. Without taking his eyes off mine, his hands move beneath my waistband, skimming my cock and moving to my arse. His hands glide slowly down my backside to my thighs, removing my jeans as they go. I cannot look away. He stops and licks his lips, never breaking eye contact. He leans forward, running his nose up my thigh.
Light fills the room, coaxing me from deep sleep to wakefulness. I stretch out and open my eyes. It’s a beautiful May morning, London at my feet. Wow, what a view. Beside me, Harry Potter is fast asleep. Wow, what a view. I’m surprised he’s still in bed. He’s facing me, and I have an unprecedented opportunity to study him. His lovely face looks younger, relaxed in sleep. His sculpted, putty lips are parted slightly, and his shiny, clean hair is a glorious mess. How can anyone look this good and still be legal? I remember his room upstairs…..perhaps he’s not legal. I shake my head, so much to think about. It’s tempting to reach out and touch him, but like a small child, he’s so lovely when he’s asleep. I don't have to worry about what I’m saying, what he’s saying, what plans he has, especially his plans for me.
As we walk through Hogsmeade, I feel lighter than air. We stop outside madam Puddifoot's tea shop. Potter lets go of my hand and holds the door open for me.
“Well, the difference is that I don't want to know about his sex life.” Harry murmurs dryly. “Theo’s a nosy bastard. But only about what we’ve done so far.” he warns. “She’d probably have my balls if she knew what I wanted to do to you.” he adds so softly I’m not sure I’m supposed to hear it.
“Ermm Draco, I kinda already told someone.” He freezes and I go on quickly. “It was a total accident, I was still a bit drunk and she asked me what happened and I told her because I tell her everything.” He relaxes a bit then.
We land at the top of the stairs but not the one leading to the front door, so we must be on the second or higher floor. He leads us to a door at the end of the corridor and produces a key from his pocket. He waves his hand infront of the door and I feel a wave of magic unlocking. Then he uses the key. He takes a deep breath and looks at me.
His expression is warm and appreciative. The red-haired woman beside him turns and beams at me, a full megawatt smile. She stands, too. She’s impeccably dressed in a camel-coloured fine knit sweater dress with matching shoes. She looks groomed, elegant, beautiful, and inside I die a little, knowing I look such a mess.
“Well everyone looks good and healthy. I’ll come again next week, but if you have any problems at all then please call me.” I hug her goodbye.
“Please Harry. I came to apologise, just hear me out.” I take a breath and stop trying to shut the door. He pushes it open. “Can I come in please? If you didn’t notice, I’m quite wet already.” I want to laugh but won’t give him the satisfaction, I’m still angry and hurt.
“No! You think I wouldn't tell you if the baby was born, silly.” I tickle him and put him down. “He’s on bed rest until the baby is born. Do you want to go see him?” He nods and I take his hand. “You coming Andy?” I turn and ask her.
The room is small but sumptuous. Beneath a shimmering chandelier, the table is all starched linens, crystal glasses, silver cutlery, and white rose bouquet. An old-world, sophisticated charm pervades the wood-paneled room. The waiter pulls out my chair, and I sit. He places my napkin in my lap. Harry sits opposite me. I peek up at him.
“YOU DID WHAT!” He exploded. “How dare you buy a house for US without asking me first!! And how dare you buy anything without going in person to look at it!! And how dare you buy it without reading the contract!! HOW DARE YOU!” He screamed at me. He had gotten to his feet and was leaning over the table, it made me feel like I was in 4th year with McGonagall shouting at me.
“I was getting worried that something happened. I don’t know why you didn't just floo there. You and flying! I’m going to die of stress before I’m thirty!”
“I know, I’m kind of jealous.” Draco says and we laugh. “I hope the rest of the house turns out just as good.” He finishes blowing the rest of the birthday balloons up with magic and sits down on the couch. I put the bow on the door and then join him. There was no denying Draco was pregnant anymore. He was huge and couldn’t hide it. Whereas Hermione could still hide hers if she wanted to, which annoyed Draco every time he saw her.
“And I’m seeing him again tonight.” She claps and jumps up and down like a small child. She can’t contain her happiness and excitement and I’m so happy for her. A happy Pansy Parkinson...this is going to be interesting.
“Welcome to the world Rose.” Then the doors slam open and Ron runs in breathless. He takes one look at Hermione and the baby and freezes.
I hear the bathroom door slam and rush to get up. I throw my dressing gown on because it's always cold in this house, then on second thought I grab Draco’s too. I go to hang it on the bathroom door as I’m passing but pause. I can hear Draco throwing up again. I knock on the door and it clicks open.
“Yes! All. To. My. Self.” With each word he plants a kiss on my face and after he says ‘self’ he licks my face right by my ear.
I scramble up and change quickly and then head into the bathroom and brush my teeth. I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror.
When we can see the ducks Teddy runs ahead. He starts feeding them and they follow him around. Me and Draco sit down on the bench and he leans his head on my shoulder.
I’m busy setting up the tables for the party later, when I can hear gigging. The whole family is getting together tonight for Leo’s 1st birthday. And also to congratulate Nia on passing all her exams.
“Bloody Merlin! Draco!” oh shit, it’s Blaise. He sounds desperate. “Where are you? I’ve been trying to contact you. I need to see you, to apologise for my behaviour on Friday. Why haven't you returned my calls?”
All of a sudden the air shifts in the room and then every single thing in the room, including me and him, is floating a few feet off the ground. I turn wide eyed to him and realise he has done this wandlessly and wordlessly. He has done it without so much as blinking. Wow.
“Horrid, awful, gruesome.” He declared confidently. But then I saw the smirk just at the side of his mouth and I burst out laughing.
“Did you know, uncle Harry and Draco, that today is the 27th of march?” We both look at each other as if to say ‘where’s this going’.
She shoots awake when my phone goes off in my pocket. Unfortunately so does Lucy, but fortunately Audrey gets back at that minute and takes over.
I go bright red. I was just imagining myself running my fingers through your hair and wondering how soft it was. I just shake my head and look down again.
“I’m fully aware that this is a dark path I’m leading you down, Draco, which is why I really want you to think about this. You must have some questions.” He says as he releases my hand.
“Yeah mate, you can go after and show them their grandson.” Ron says sadly. Hermione had told me that they had taken Rosie to Fred’s grave and Ron had cried his eyes out. I sling my arm around Ron’s waist and pull him closer.
“So you have any idea how much I want you, Draco Malfoy?” he whispers. My breath hitches. I cannot take my eyes off his. He reaches up and gently runs his fingers down my cheek to my chin.
The waitress returns with venison, but my appetite has vanished. What a revelation. Harry the submissive….holy shit. I take a large slug of wine - he’s right, of course, it’s delicious. Jeez, all these revelations, it’s so much to think about. I need time to process this, when I’m on my own, not when I’m distracted by his presence. He’s so overwhelming, so alpha male, and now he’s thrown this bombshell into the equation. He knows what it’s like.
“Come on. It’s big. It looks interesting.” She hops from foot to foot excitedly and bounds back into the living room. I clamber out of bed and grab my robe hanging on the back of my door. A grumpy looking house elf is standing in our living room floating a large box next to him.
I don’t see anyone or leave the house for the next week. I don’t get much sleep and I hardly eat. I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling. I haven’t showered all week because what’s the point. What’s the point of anything anymore? I should have died when Voldemort threw the killing curse at me.
“I don’t care about that, I like muggles - and love the things they come up with - and you shouldn’t go around spouting that crap.” I turn away from him and continue to focus on my magic where it’s cleaning glasses and placing them back on shelves.
As Pansy goes to get a shower, I sit with my cup of tea and open the email program, and waiting for me is an email from Harry. My heart leaps into my mouth.
“I’m not having either crew put at risk. No, cancel….We’ll air-drop instead…..Good.” He hangs up. The warmth in his eyes has disappeared. He looks forbidding, and with one quick glance at me, he apparates out, then is back a moment later.
It’s Friday and I have just finished my last exam. I am so relieved. Tonight the celebrations begin. I am getting so pissed! I meet Pansy outside the hall and she jumps into my arms and ‘woos’ loudly.
Soon we get onto the motorway, a song singing about being on fire and desire. How apt. I blush as I listen to the words. Harry glances at me. He’s got his Ray-Bans on so I can’t see what he’s feeling. His mouth twitches slightly, and he reaches across and places his hand on my knee, squeezing gently. My breath hitches.
“We are going to start the games now, everyone come around here please.” She tells them and points to around us. “Right George you take over.”
“Oh, Draco, what shall I do to you?” he whispers as he lowers me onto the bed, lying beside me and raising my hands above my head.
“That’s better.” he murmurs, and smiles a wicked, knowing smile. He bends and starts undoing one of my sneakers. Oh no…..no….my feet. No. I’ve just been running.
It smells delicious - chorizo and scallops with roasted red peppers and shallots, sprinkled with flat-leaf parsley. And in spite of the fact that my stomach is churning from Harry’s veiled threats, the surreptitious glances from pretty little Miss Pigtails, and the debacle of my missing boxers, I am starving. I flush as I realise it’s the physical effort of this afternoon that’s given me such an appetite.
“It's okay, open your eyes.” He says to me. I open them and nearly scream. We are in the air, flying over Hogsmeade. I look down and feel nauseous. Oh fuck! I squeeze Harry and hide in his back again.
“Thanks, the elf’s have been teaching me. I asked them to, so I could cook for you. You always do nice things for me so I thought I would do something nice for you this time. I love you too Harry.” He says in a small by meaningful voice, with a tiny genuine smile on his face. He looked so open with me right now and I absolutely loved it and vow to make it happen more often.
“Well i just had to do something and then i came straight here. I practically ran here actually.” I tried to comfort.
He was double-checking the measurements one last time when Maggie called his name from the shop front, her voice sounding oddly high-pitched and breathless.
From the wall, the models in the illustrations and photos sneered at him and his lack of productivity.
“You’re going all the way back to Scotland by broom?” He sounds surprised and a bit anxious. He glances at the window, which makes me look out too, and see it has begun to rain. “Well you should be careful then.” He says in a stern authoritative voice. Why the hell does he care? “Did you get everything you need?” He then asks.
“Yes and Merlin knows when the next time he’ll sleep that much.” Molly says. We chuckle and drink our tea.
“Hey, so are you guys new around here or just visiting? Because it would be great to have more gay people around.” Draco widens his eyes at this and looks at her. Oh no, here we go.
We said hello to Percy and his wife Audrey after that and their baby girl Lucy, who was just 10 months. Then Draco surprised me and held out his hands.
“Oh the baby’s kicking! Do you wanna feel?” She grabs my hand anyway and puts it on her stomach. I thought she was having another false contraction but it was just the baby kicking.
“As long as you record everything then I will transcript it all. The questions will see you through.” She looks at her phone, another muggle piece of technology that she loves and made me get (and yes okay I love mine), and then back at me. “You should get going, it’s a long way.”
“That’s a great idea Teddy.” Hermione says and reaches into her bag for some duck food. “Here you go, only a little at a time remember.”
“Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and you’ve not eaten all day. You said I could trust you.”
I drop my bag on the floor and collapse on the sofa. Then I think of all the studying I have missed today because I was with…..him.
“Really?! That’s great Hermione! Thank you so much.” I said as I got up and lifted her into a swinging hug. This was amazing news, I’m going to go to the estate agency straight after work and put a deposit down. Speaking of which…”hey what time is it?” I said as I looked at the clock. “Great, it's after 5, I can go now.” Answering my own question. I barely got a bye out of my mouth before I had picked my things up my things and shot out the door. I definitely owed Hermione one for this.
Before I can do anymore questioning in my head, Katie knocks and walks back in. Draco quickly wipes his face and harshly pulls his hand from mine where they were still attached.
“Love you to babe.” We sit there for a while just remembering the day and watching the beautiful sunset.
“Charlie Tango, come in please, over.” Weasley interrupts my reverie. Harry answers him, telling him we are almost there. I look down at London and it looks absolutely stunning from up here at night.
I sigh and peek up at Fifty Shades. I could stare at him forever. He has light stubble over his chin, and my fingers itch to scratch it and feel it against my face, against my chest, my nipples….everywhere. I blush at the direction of my thoughts. He peers down at me and raises his hand to pull at my chin.
“They’re lovely. Raising the ordinary to extraordinary.” I all but whisper, too distracted by the paintings….and maybe Mr Potter himself. He catches my gaze and cocks his head to the side and regards me.
Just as Ron and Nia get home, Rose wakes up and starts crying. Hermione jumps up and shouts “what?!” And frantically searches for the crying baby. When her eyes land on Harry and Draco shushing the baby she sits back down and puts her head in her hands and sighs.
