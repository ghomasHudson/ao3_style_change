Harry could feel Malfoy's stare like a physical touch, but he kept his own eyes trained on the pub.
"No, it's fine," he said. "Don't worry about it. Just a bit tired is all."
“I’m just saying, if you want to complain about what we’re spending our time on, then how about you just tell us instead of pretending this is about school.”
“Yeah,” he said quietly. “I thought so too for a little while, last night. But Pomfrey patched her up. She’ll be fine. Pomfrey’s brilliant.”
“Why?”
Harry ignored him. He looked at his watch – he had arrived right on time, but of course Slughorn was late. When he looked up, Malfoy had come closer.
,” she said.
Malfoy raises his eyebrows and his expression is still more disbelief than anger, even if his voice is scathing:
“That he kissed you?” she said.
“No. No, he’s doing really well,” he said, though after that afternoon’s failure it didn’t feel entirely true. “It became corporeal yesterday, so we could have just stopped, but…”
“Yes, I heard you the first seven times, Draco. But what’s happening next? I mean, today didn’t exactly go well-“
“You don’t have to keep secrets from me. No one outside this office will ever know unless you want them to, and if you do not want me to help then I will not try. But if something happened while you went home, or if there is some other reason that you are not well – because you’re not, Mr Malfoy – then I think you should tell me what it is.”
Ron was watching both of them curiously now and Harry grimaced.
respectively. Draco remembered them from his own read-through. They were from one of the chapters that made no sense at all.
“So you know that I can keep it a secret, and I’m sure Potter believes his people would be able to keep quiet as well, yet neither of you have told anyone?”
“Shit, that would have been a fucking nightmare. Do you even think she
“I never laughed about it. I never did that.”
“Look, I wanted to tell you I’m sorry.”
“You don’t know that.”
“Talk to him,” said Draco. “I don’t really know Alain’s… situation. I think he’s usually a quiet kid, but there’s a lot of anger in Slytherin-“
"Oh my God, Irie!" she said through her giggles. "That was
Malfoy looked at him with a bemused expression.
“Why did she look like that?”
He closed his eyes for a moment.
“Yeah,” he said. “Considering.”
“I-“ Harry begins but Draco cuts him off, face twisting into an ugly smile.
He braced himself for the backlash, for the shove and the fight that would follow.
The door was pulled open from the other side and he took a surprised step back.
“So you got my patronus?” he asked.
“Yes, professor. Draco’s doing the same.”
"I don't know," he said. "I just don't know what he wanted from me. His mum already thanked me for being at the trials, so I don't know why he was bringing that up again."
“You haven’t been downstairs all day.”
Harry took a deep breath.
“It’s still kind of a celebration of Voldemort’s death, even though he didn’t die that time. Hermione warned me that there might be speeches this year. A lot of them. She said her and Ron would skip the party with me, but I told them they should go. I just don’t want to be there.”
He hesitated a moment before he added:
“What’s the name of that fifth year they’ve replaced you with?” he asked.
,” cried Potter, his voice sounding far away.
Harry grinned.
At the bottom of the stairs, Hermione cast a tracking spell on the wall.
Harry squirmed.
“No, I’m not even sure the floor actually exists except for this hallway.”
She opened her eyes.
“This is the last time you called me a Death Eater.”
"Why do you think?"
"Harry who - wait, are you shitting-" the connection cut off, and then Harry was left standing there on Draco Malfoy's doorstep.
“No, it was a good idea. We should try it again another time.”
"Yeah," Harry said. "I-"
Draco ran his fingers through his hair.
She laughed.
“Last night…”
“I don’t know. I was angry, I didn’t think of it.”
Potter walked unsteadily to the stairs.
“Why would I think that?”
“What are we drinking?” he asked.
“Are you serious?” he said. “You have been bothering everyone for years! You insult Ron’s family all the time and you wrote that stupid song about him when he became Gryffindor keeper-“
“It wasn’t about that last year either, it was for fighting the Carrow’s and hiding from the snitches in Slytherin.”
"Because you have so many muggle friends."
His mother didn’t answer. She kept stroking his forehead. He tried to chew the chocolate.
“Honestly, I’m not even sure about that…”
"Of course she does. I'm incredibly charming."
,” he said.
“Soon, mate. If not, we’re coming down after you, aurors or no aurors.”
“Yes, thank you,” said Malfoy and the glasses were set down in front of them.
“What?” she demanded.
, and after that was
“Where are you going?” Harry called, but Draco ignored him.
“Crazy.”
“Maybe we shouldn’t be talking about that here?” said Hermione.
"Merlin's saggy teats," Draco swore, gasping for air. "Are you absolutely mad, Potter? If you're too drunk to stand then you're too drunk to apparate! You could have
She didn’t look up, but made a small “hm?” sound to indicate she was listening. He swallowed.
”You know why,” said Draco, putting his aside; there was nothing they could use in it anyway.
He stomped out of the kitchen and up the stairs. Ron didn't follow. He still had to fight not to break into a run.
Potter made a face.
“What do you mean you don’t? You’re the bloody expert on heroics,” said Malfoy, who was starting to look completely unhinged. “You’re the Chosen One, you defeated the Dark Lord and every other dark thing you could find in the world. You’ve almost gotten yourself killed with heroics every year since I met you.”
“Don’t give me that shit,” said Potter loudly. “What the hell was that? I thought we were – and then you pull something like that?”
"I said I'd go with you to a normal pub," Draco hissed. "But you could have told me that it was going to be a bloody Hogwarts reunion party!"
, because her wand flew from her grip and Ginny caught it with a triumphant cry. They watched the two of them catching their breath, then Ginny walking over to Granger to hand her wand back. Next to Draco, Pansy stepped forward.
“We should head back soon,” she said.
Irie leaned back in her chair, but she was still frowning.
“Why not?”
"They are."
“Fine,” she said and turned to leave. Granger didn’t say anything until she was gone, then she pointed to an open door a bit further down the hall.
Pansy laughed sharply.
“It’s fine, I haven’t been waiting long.”
“Your mom has been sending me letters, you know. Ever since we came back after Christmas. She asks me how you’re doing, if you’re okay, because you won’t talk to her.”
"Alright," he said, and then the ground dropped away and air closed around them like a fist.
if it gets close enough to me to change shape. If we’re not taken by surprise, then it should be fine.”
“I just wanted to, I don’t know, to say sorry, I guess. And make sure he was okay. I know how you all feel about him, I know how
She smiles and pats him on the cheek.
It was a long list.
Malfoy passed him the notes.
How horrified had he looked that she was reacting like this, he wondered.
“I understand,” he said.
“See you tomorrow, Potter,” he said, smiling his pretty smile.
"Tell them what?" Malfoy asked.
"You're wearing robes again," Potter said quietly.
“What kind of trouble?” asked Ginny.
“Who is it from?” asked Hermione.
He nodded.
“Come on in,” he said, hardly audible over the thunderous crash of the waves below.
,” he said and immediately wanted to bite his tongue off for letting her make this about Azkaban.
“Potter, I don’t think they’re mad at you,” Draco said. “You didn’t talk them into coming here, they decided that for themselves.”
“I think I saw something… moving.”
Pansy looked eagerly from him to Granger.
She sniffed and stood up.
“Draco, shut up!” Harry cut him off. “Pull yourself together. We’re here. We keep going.”
In the morning, they dragged their trunks to the common room where they met with the girls. Together, all of them proceeded down to the Entrance Hall, where the prefects were trying to shepherd the younger students to the carriages in a somewhat orderly fashion. The teachers stood off to the side, seeing the students off and saying goodbye to the seventh years. The Gryffindors made their way towards McGonagall as soon as they spotted her. She stood next to Professor Flitwick, who had brought a small stepladder to stand on, so the students of his house would be able to find him in the swarm. On her other side was Slughorn, smiling and shaking hands and looking like he was enjoying himself immensely. Harry looked, but couldn’t see Draco anywhere in the throng of students eagerly wanting to ingratiate themselves further, though he did notice that a small tower of gifts was steadily growing next to the professor.
Draco wasn’t sure where they were going, or if they were going anywhere at all, only that Potter seemed determined to put as much distance between themselves and the castle as possible. As long as he wasn’t thinking about the forest below them or imagining the creatures inhabiting it, he could enjoy the flight. Potter seemed absolutely euphoric. He watched him as they flew. He couldn’t remember the last time he had seen him not looking all constipated and tortured. He looked like a different person up here.
He was looking earnestly at Draco. He hadn’t asked mockingly, like Blaise had, but with something like genuine interest.
He had been hoping to find the dorm empty, but Seamus was up there. Harry tensed when he saw him. Seamus didn’t seem to notice.
“We’re talking about everyone.”
"No," he said. "No, not at all."
A reluctant smile curved Harry’s lips.
There was no resistance at all. He fell forwards into those black eyes, the floor disappeared under his knees as he was swallowed by a storm of memories.
“I don’t know.”
,” Draco snapped. “I know all that, but I just – you saw what he turned into, the way he
It was a long walk to the top of the tower. There were no more dementors, but their gloom persisted, and Harry wanted to keep the patronuses with them, but his whole right hand had gone numb and soon his concentration started slipping. The doe faded before the stag did, but both were gone before they reached the fourth floor. When the last silver light died away, Harry felt a shudder of discomfort and sadness, but that was all.
“We’re not in mortal danger yet, just planning to get there. If Hermione ever figures out what to do about the dementors. It’s driving her crazy.”
"Ron, there are some alarming sounds coming from those crates George left in the living room!"
“Has Ron left?” asked Harry.
Granger took a hesitant step up the stairs.
They didn’t begin their descent until they had passed over the village and were far enough up the path to the castle to avoid risk of being seen. Malfoy landed in the gravel of the path and Harry joined him seconds later.
“Oh sure, they’re studying for an obligatory class, they’ve all changed, let’s forgive them for whatever they did last year.”
"Uh, yes?" Potter said, as if it was a perfectly reasonable thing to go around believing and Draco was the one being daft.
"What now?"
Draco smirked.
“Oh yes, they’re doing
"There's a pub up there," Malfoy said.
“Memory charms,” croaked Hermione.
"I swear, it'll take weeks to get the Gryffindor out of the air in here."
They were two weeks into the school year and Harry still felt weird about putting on his uniform. He felt silly, like an adult who was pretending to be a kid, like he was going bald and the uniform was too small and everyone could tell, but just pretended like nothing was wrong. He knew the out-of place feeling was only in his head – just looking at them, it wouldn’t be possible to tell the actual seventh years from the ones who were redoing their seventh. But maybe it was just that all the students were looking older than they should. He had noticed the way the little kids would get quiet near certain classrooms, the grave expressions on their faces, that were completely wrong on children of that age.
"Just… well. Do you want to come along?"
He didn’t cast it again.
eventually reject the theory,” said Lovegood, talking over Granger. “She found that it was much more likely that it was caused by wrackspurts. Sadly, she died young before she could publish her work. My mother spent a lot of time assembling her notes.”
And they couldn’t, but now that they could see them, their presence felt smothering. How long had they walked in darkness without noticing them, Harry wondered. Were there as many dementors behind them as there were ahead?
When Harry returned to Hogwarts after the holidays he was feeling better than he had in months. They could see the end now, which meant that Hermione was already stressing over exams, but to Harry they still felt far away. Classes only picked up slowly after the break and there wasn’t a lot of homework. He spent his free time playing quidditch on the grounds, drinking tea in the common room, and visiting Hagrid with Ron and Hermione, which they hadn’t done a lot that year.
His snake curled in the air. Granger was holding on to Harry as she pushed herself upright.
Hermione nodded.
Draco nods. He hesitates for a long moment before asking:
Harry looked at his watch every thirty seconds of the tense silence while they waited for Draco to show up. After two minutes, he was certain he wouldn’t come. He was about to offer to go back and find him when there was a sigh of relief from Hermione.
His voice was weird, he didn’t sound like himself.
“Draco, look at me,” she said.
"No!" Harry blurted out before he could stop himself.
“Who else would it be?” he asked with a sigh, leaning back against the counter.
Harry was still seething with anger when they left potions. He and Malfoy had cleaned up without saying a word to each other. Ron and Hermione waited for him and he left the dungeon with them.
“They don’t seem to be pulling their load, do they? I mean, I don’t know about Luna, but seems to me Malfoy is just sort of hanging around waiting for us to do the work for him.”
“About me and Draco. We’re- I wasn’t joking.”
“And Astoria keeps offering to have her Ravenclaw friends do my homework for me, which I would accept if it wasn’t for-“ Daphne cut herself off mid-sentence: “What are you rolling your eyes at?”
Draco’s eyes snapped back to him, but Potter was looking past him now with a strange, uncomfortable expression on his face, as if he had just confessed something very embarrassing.
“Did you run all the way here?” he asked.
“It’s
“Fine,” said Malfoy, cutting him off. “Fine. I kissed you because I was completely out of it after the boggart. I know it was stupid, but it really got to me. And then I suppose I was confused about the hand-holding, which isn’t to say I’m blaming you or anything. But you wouldn’t let me leave, for fucks sake - if I had just left like I wanted to, it wouldn’t have happened.”
“I hope you’re right. Just seems like it’s a bit much on her, all the work she’s doing to figure out what to do about the dementors on top of all the classes she’s taking. Half the time I’m with her she’s reading, and she keeps disappearing up to the room.”
Draco followed him, but they had only made it a few feet into it before Harry stopped and pulled Draco with him into a niche between two suits of armour. And then without letting go of Draco’s arm, he reached up with his other hand, pushed it into Draco’s hair and pulled him in for a kiss. And Draco’s heart convulsed in anxiety as much as excitement, because this time they weren’t hidden away in the astronomy tower or in the secret room – no one was going to walk by and notice them, but anyone could. And he let it happen anyway, let Harry push him back against the wall, his hand cupped around the back of Draco’s head, holding him in place, his tongue pushing into his mouth. Draco looped his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him back with him. Harry’s chest pressed against his own, his fingers clenched in Draco’s robes. Draco loosened his hold on Harry a bit, and Harry pulled back, looking slightly flushed but with a wide grin on his face.
“This is bad news?”
He was interrupted by a sharp sound of something hitting the glass of the window they had just passed. Both he and Hermione started, in a second they had their wands out. She approached the window carefully.
“I’m fine,” she said, picking up the skin potion and the salve. “We’re still following the plan: We’ll be back in our beds before anyone notices we were gone and wake up this morning like nothing happened.”
She took the list back.
“Come on,” she said. “Let’s go get that half hour of sleep before breakfast.”
“Why not? From my experience he’s more likely to be lying than telling the truth.”
“Do you think he fancies you?” she asked again as if he just hadn’t heard her the first time.
Potter frowned.
“I’m not going to tell anyone.”
She smiled quickly at him.
Harry saw Malfoy’s fingers brush over his left arm. He didn’t seem aware of the movement himself.
“Good.”
have to be about the war?”
A door slammed somewhere outside the living room and Harry started.
Harry spends the year stalking Draco. He tells himself that this obsession is just about Draco being a Death Eater. It's not like he didn't know Draco was evil last year, he was just fifteen and angry back then. It was a way of acting out. He’s falling in love with Ginny, and despite her being Ron’s sister and everything that’s complicated about that, he can’t help but relish how easy and good and right it feels. There were times the year before when he thought he might be completely fucked up, that he had to be damaged, disturbed, wrong when he could like Cho and know she liked him back and still hook up with Malfoy between classes. That fear can be safely dismissed now – he’s in love with Ginny, he’s doing everything he can to discover what Malfoy is up to, and to stop him from it.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
“That is weird. But it could have been a coincidence.”
And Draco would sit down carefully and and say thank you and politely ask Mr Weasley about his work in the ministry, and it would be tense and difficult but it would not be wrong. Maybe it could happen like that.
“I thought he hated you.”
“Yes, everyone but Draco is scared of me,” called a sharp voice behind them.
something to you, it just… I wish you would stop. I’m asking you to
“I don’t know, I haven’t really been paying attention to him.”
Neville had shown up too. He was by his own bed and was messing with some things in his trunk with his back to the whole scene like it wasn’t happening.
“Shouldn’t there be more than one auror going with us?” he asked quietly.
After months of nothing, he had really expected that he would feel some sort of relief. He had thought that when they found the right solution it would
Potter nodded. There was another stretch of silence. It was the kind of silence that creeps into late-night conversations when all sentences are spoken slowly and the gaps between them become too long – the sound of voices gravelly with exhaustion, of everyone else being asleep, and daybreak still being hours away.
“That you’re the sort of person who throws tantrums, you know: pay attention to me, I’m in pain.”
“So does that mean you’re done being friends with him?”
“But you like Ginny?”
“We would have been stupid not to take whatever safety we were offered! If the eleven year olds in Slytherin were punished with lost house points instead of some other cruel shit, that wasn’t a loss even if it was favouritism, it just meant that one less kid was abused and that was a good thing. So you can all stop acting like we were spared at your expense.”
“I can’t believe you’re here! You look good,” she said.
“I know it’s too late to try to change anything," said Malfoy quickly. "That’s not what I’m doing. I just wanted to see you and say thank you."
Anyway, it wasn't worth talking about. Potter didn't matter. What were the chances even that Draco would ever run into him again? He had his life carefully structured by now so that he hardly ever needed to pass into magic London. He moved on. He went to work. He bought groceries and went drinking at muggle pubs with his muggle colleagues. Irie never brought up the incident with the Dark Mark again - she was a good person in that sense. He was sure she would have been a Slytherin if she had gone to Hogwarts.
"Uh…" he said.
Draco had heard something.
“No, seriously, Malfoy.”
“See you,” he said.
"Me and Ginny. You already asked at the pub."
Slowly, he raised a hand to his face and wiped the spit off his cheek.
“Yeah,” Hermione said. “That’s fine, that’s perfectly normal too.”
Draco hesitated.
Ron shuddered.
He was picking his pie apart, dissecting it on his plate with his fork while he spoke.
I honestly can't believe we've finally reached the end. I've spent so long writing this and it's been great, and it's kind of surreal to finally be done with it. Thanks for reading, and especially thanks to those of you that left comments, I swear I would never have finished this thing without you.
Her voice sounded strained. Draco wasn’t sure he was even able to speak. The patronus-light was calming, though. It relieved the sense of ancient terror that emanated from the place, but the anxiousness inside him wasn’t affected much.
"He totally is! Nice face, smart, too awkward for this cruel Earth."
“What are nargles?”
Harry nodded. Ron kept watching him silently from the door. Harry pushed off the wall.
Harry darted a glance at him, forgetting for a moment that he was trying to pretend this wasn't happening.
“Nothing happened,” he said.
He sounded scared of what he was saying. It didn’t sound like lies, but neither had everything else he had told Harry over the last few months, and that had all turned out to be fake, hadn’t it? Besides, he knew what Malfoy was telling him couldn’t be true.
"I know.
Potter snorted, or maybe it could be counted as a laugh.
"I need to go the bathroom," he said.
“No dangerous spells,” said Ginny, holding Pansy’s wand out to her. “I didn’t break the rules either. If it had been real, it would not have been
Then Ron pulled her into a hug, burying his face in her hair.
Harry pulled out his chair. Malfoy sat back down. He cleared his throat.
“No, I mean… you can’t tell them about the other thing. With us.”
“Oops,” he said. “Sorry about that.”
“Well, to be fair it wasn’t actually the Slytherins who started the fight today,” said Hermione.
He waved and then walked towards the door.
He pulled out his wand and everyone in the room seemed to straighten up a bit. They all watched him attentively, even Blaise with his careful scepticism, and Pansy who already knew. Draco took a deep breath, concentrating on the shape of his memory, the feel of his patronus – and then he hesitated, not on purpose and not for dramatic effect, but the effect of it was dramatic. He had the attention of everyone in Slytherin house worth impressing. They were intrigued by his supposed friendship with Potter, and none of them would be able to turn the fact of it against him. Blaise wouldn’t be able to accuse Draco of being a turncoat like his father, if he decided to go for a low blow, because Draco’s patronus was a snake, and none of them would be able to ignore the significance of that. The realization hit him that this was exactly what he had wanted – a few months ago, he would have given
fixed everything?"
"It's not a difficult thing to check-"
Harry hesitated. He was cold. They had been walking for a long time. He could probably head home now, if he wanted to.
The air outside was clear with frost and the wind scraped frozen teeth over Draco’s cheeks. The gravel crunched under their feet and Harry’s shoulder brushed against his as they walked.
“Cast it again!” said Harry.
Draco pushed him away.
Harry watches paralyzed and hidden under the invisibility cloak when Dumbledore offers to hide Draco from Voldemort, and there isn’t any part of him that doesn’t wish for Malfoy to accept.
The scuffling of their footsteps sounded awfully loud in the echoey corridors of the dungeons.
“You’re being dramatic,” Harry said.
It was a lame solution, but Potter took the suggestion, and Draco was grateful.
“What’s your plan? Are you going to show me your patronus? I heard it’s pretty good. Earned you an “outstanding” for your O.W.L’s and everything.”
“There we go,” he said and went inside.
“And you know how to do laundry?”
“I don’t know,” said Malfoy. “I got bored with it, I suppose.”
He hadn’t noticed when it happened, but Granger’s patronus charm was gone. There were only faint traces of the runes on the wall now, like pale scars, and the room had once again become sad afternoon grey around them. Lovegood was humming under her breath.
The boy looked livid
Ron disentangled himself from Hermione.
“Does it matter?” Draco says coolly.
“What happened? Why did you only come back now?”
“Yeah? That’s good.”
“We need to get back upstairs,” he said.
“Are you going to start now?” asked Ron, squaring his shoulders and turning to face Malfoy.
“No,” said Lovegood. “I suppose it didn’t. But the runes are interesting.”
“Yeah.” said Potter.
“I’ll see you after the holidays,” said Potter when they stood inside the Entrance Hall, just before they split up.
Malfoy closed his eyes, like he was taking a moment to steady himself. Or maybe to show his exasperation with Harry’s stupidity that he had taken what happened so seriously. It was impossible to tell sometimes. Harry was aware of his heart pounding away hard in his chest. Malfoy’s hesitation was excruciating, he had to fight to keep himself from just blurting out everything that went through his head and wait for an answer.
Malfoy closed his eyes again.
“I can see why Weasley would be mad when she spent half the year in hiding and carrying out her little terrorist missions,” he continued. “Maybe if all the houses had been allied before the Carrows came, some of us would have joined the Gryffindors, but it was too late for anything like that. They weren’t about to reach out to us and we weren’t expecting any sympathy if we had reached out to them. The roles were already given before the Carrows came.”
“I think it’s nice that we get another year,” said Hermione. “I wouldn’t want to end it like that…“
“So if we’re ever going to go, we should do it soon. We’re as ready as we’re going to be.”
“Potter! What on earth do you think you’re doing? – let him go immediately.”
"No, but you were spacing out."
“Well, there’s still the dementor’s pit…” said Granger.
In a corner of Draco’s mind, a feeling stirred. He pushed it back.
“They know,” he whispered.
“It’s not a bad plan.”
He managed a smile. Then she turned back down the path and Slughorn’s hand was on his shoulder again. They led him back up to the castle.
He sighed.
He heard Malfoy pull the window shut. He didn't leave his spot in the sill. It had gotten chilly in the flat. Harry cleared his throat.
“Excuse me?!” his voice rose indignantly though it really shouldn’t have.
Harry choked on his beer, which he had unthinkingly kept drinking from.
“The trip back will be faster,” said Draco. “It won’t take us as long to get back as it took to get here.”
“But you’re right, we wouldn’t have time for it now,” said Harry.
”No. She just wanted to say goodbye to my father.”
“I shouldn’t have asked you to obliviate Pansy.”
“Well, then you should have kept in touch,” she snapped.
“The mudblood, the penniless bloodtraitors, the lunatic, the half-squib, those are your friends, remember? Such an impressive group, really. It’s no wonder they all adore you, but it does say some quite unflattering things about you that those are the kinds of people you choose to surround yourself with.”
Harry shrugged.
“It wasn’t very smart of you to start throwing curses at him though. Not in the potions classroom.”
"Not a chance."
“Sure,” he said.
He took a deep breath. He ought to head up to the Great Hall. He was late for dinner. They had been in the dungeon much longer than he had planned. But then, nothing had really gone as planned.
The mark was itching under his sleeve; it had been for the past half hour. It was driving him crazy; he was considering going to the bathroom just so he could scratch it. But that would mean going past Potter's table again.
“What does… it doesn’t have anything to do with you,” he said.
"You say that, but look at what you're actually doing with your life. Are you going to come back to us now?"
“What? Why – Potter, what’s in there–“
There was a note of grudging respect in her tone. There was a brief moment where both of their hands were on the wand and their eyes were on each other, and there was a hint of a smile on both their faces.
He waited for Granger to announce that she wouldn’t be coming with them – that was the only explanation he could think of for her odd timing. But she didn’t say anything and so they all agreed that four days was long enough, and they would be leaving then.
Draco swallowed. His heart was flinging itself madly against his ribs.
Malfoy twisted in his chair, leaning an elbow on the table so he was facing Harry full-on.
He slept a lot. He ate chocolate and didn’t throw up all of it. He knew that the worse things a person has experienced, the more vulnerable they become to a dementor attack, and that the effect of dementors was even stronger on people who had been overexposed before. Still, he could only have been out of reach of the patronus for a couple of seconds, and that shouldn’t be nearly enough to cause permanent damage no matter how weak he was. He kept reminding himself of this when, two days later, he still didn’t feel normal. His mother insisted on nursing him. He told her to leave him alone, but she didn’t listen, so he dragged himself out of bed and locked the door to keep her out. Then she sent the house elves, but he ordered them to stay away. He barricaded himself in his room and didn’t speak to anyone, didn’t read his letters and most days didn’t even get out of bed.
“Yeah. As far as I remember, that was right after you had been beating each other up in some classroom, and you also said that you’d never trust him again. Have you been confunded?”
“Well, that’s a hypothesis,” she said. “We’ll have to check up on it when we start researching. I think we should keep the option of a political solution open until we know more, but I suppose we can put it aside for now and focus on a practical intervention...”
Harry kept walking.
, he realized.
Ginny rested her head in her hand as her eyes surveyed the room, watching the remaining Gryffindors still hanging around, doing homework or talking in little clusters.
“At least he’s trying,” she said dryly. “When are you going to start teaching him?”
“Neither do I,” she said.
They apparated as close to the school as they could, then walked up the path the rest of the way to the gate. Between the columns, two people were waiting for them. One was holding a lantern that illuminated his mountainous size. The man looked wild and uncultured, like he was only partly human and not far from reverting back to some wild animal state. Draco wasn’t a child anymore, but the groundskeeper still made him uncomfortable. He looked down at them when they approached, the light catching in the black eyes hidden in the wild thicket of hair. Next to him was Draco’s head of house, Professor Slughorn, who looked very cultured and very tiny next to the half-giant.
A great, black creature shot up through the yellowing thicket of leaves, for a second the batlike wings swallowed the sky in front of them, they could count every vein of blood in the thin, stretched skin. And then the thestral rose higher and passed over them so closely they felt the wind moved by its body like a heavy force on their backs.
“I don’t have much confidence in the judgment of my housemates. I’m sure the offer was well intended, but I do not want any incompetent muggles attempting to “heal my mind”.”
Lucius jerked violently, the auror’s wand shot up, aimed at his chest.
Malfoy nodded. He looked both relieved and like he was trying not to look relieved.
“The treatment mainly consists of conversation,” she said patiently. “It was recommended to me by both Ms Granger and several other students and parents with close ties to the muggle world. Because of this, Hogwarts has appointed four who are all parents of former Hogwarts students, so they already knew about our world, and they are specialized in working with minds that have been damaged by war. They work at St. Mungo’s and the students who see them floo there for their appointments – we thought it would be more discreet than to have them stay at the castle with Madam Pomfrey.”
"You alright?" Draco asked.
And in between there were memories that didn’t belong to this man, memories of the ones who saw him coming, memories of the people who survived, and Draco felt the strange ache of watching the same memory from two people’s eyes at the same time.
“Good evening, Mrs Malfoy,” he greeted Draco’s mother.
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine, and he wanted to tell her she was wrong, but now he could see it too; the gentle rise and fall of the man’s chest.
Ron shrugged and followed him with his own mug.
“Well, obviously they’re the better team, but it’s not like I can’t support Chudley Cannons too. And no matter how much you like them it’s obvious they made a mistake with Crowley as seeker. Ernie agrees with me.”
Lovegood shrugged.
“But I have no idea what that was.”
“It’s not that bad.”
Harry takes a deep breath.
“Look, maybe I just wanted to check on you, alright?” he says.
Maybe Potter noticed the look on his face – he let go of Draco’s arm and the smile faded a bit but did not go away.
“You're sure?”
“Good luck,” said Ginny.
Malfoy laughed.
“That’s because she’s terrifying,” said Matthew.
“I’m sure they’re nice to
“I’m not going to ask Parkinson.”
“I didn’t want to come,” he hissed, “I didn’t want to see him. And I want us to
“I got it right the second time,” said Ron, pointing at the stack of unburnt slices on a plate on the table. “Anyway, I still think we should get a muggle toaster.”
“Good, you made it,” she said. “I’ve been trying to get a hold of you the whole week.”
Draco buried his face in his hand.
“I’ve been lying to my friends too! Do you think I like doing this behind their backs? Do you think I like that I have to sneak off and make up ridiculous excuses to see you? You have no idea what I’m risking, how angry they’ll be-”
“I didn’t know Ginny hated her so much. What did she do last year?”
"Probably, but I do think you should consider robbing a bank or something while it lasts."
Granger was rolling up her sleeves.
“I don’t know,” said Matthew, looking around at his friends.
“Oh, I suppose Gryffindor is on the same page as Hufflepuff with this whole sentiment of “loyalty is a virtue and I will stand by my friends through everything until I die in an unnecessary but very admirable and self-sacrificing way”,” he said, “but Slytherin has always been more about allies than friends.”
"Keep a lookout for muggles, will you?" He pulled a pamphlet out of his pocket and turned so he had his back to the street before getting out his wand.
She trailed off.
“I thought we weren’t going to do this anymore,” Malfoy says coolly. “You were very determined when you left last night. Did you change your mind?”
did, yes. He was getting quite desperate.”
They looked towards the castle, where two broomsticks were just visible in the dark, flying low over the ground and headed in their direction.
Draco’s hands curled into tight fists.
"All our assets are still frozen,” he said. “My father was involved in a lot of things, not all of them quite legal. It's taking them a while to sort out how much of our fortune they still think belongs to us.” He laughed a small, mirthless laugh. “Or I guess how much they can get away with taking. So I needed to find something… affordable."
“Do you really think that is the only reason I might want to speak with you privately? That I would never call a student to my office simply because they were my student? You’re here because all of your teachers are concerned about you. And not just about your academic performance, but about your wellbeing.”
“It wasn’t working for me. Of course it wasn’t a very good plan to begin with, since you’re not really a hero, just some pawn that happened to be necessary because of a prophecy and some pointless coincidences. And now that you’ve served your purpose you’re really worthless, can’t even be used to pull my shitty reputation out of the gutter.”
“I thought it might be a good idea to see if he could still cast it when there was actually a dementor there. To make sure he’s ready when we go to Azkaban.”
“Weren’t you going to a muggle university or something, Hermione?”
this week.”
“Of course not.”
“He would.”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter.”
"You meant it?" Harry blurted out.
"So you're going home?"
Draco nodded, sidled out between the tables and headed towards the bar. He kept his eyes on his path, determined to not as much as glance at the Gryffindors. It wasn't even just them, he felt sure people were looking, he felt heads turning on all sides, could imagine the whispering, people's eyes on him, his back felt exposed. Pansy was right, he really wasn't nearly drunk enough.
buying Witch Weekly just so you can keep up with the gossip?"
“That’s where Harry and Ron and I have talked about going too. We’ve sort of been looking for a flat, and if we split the rent it might be feasible.”
“But that just means “kill” is the wrong word. We should still be able to destroy them, right?” said Ronald.
Blaise put a hand on his chest to stop him.
“Yeah,” she said. “We’ll probably have to.”
“But why are you meeting him?" Hermione demanded. "Did something happen? What did he say?”
Draco kept his face neutral.
Draco swallowed.
“Sirius left it to me.”
Malfoy shot him a vicious glare.
“My dear, there’s no need to-“
“Apparently they practically do it by themselves.”
Hermione shuddered.
When he wasn’t producing useless wisps of silver light with Potter, Draco found time to read through the books he and Granger had found in the library. She would leave notes for him and he soon started leaving them for her too. That was an aggravating process as well – there was very little information on dementors, it was all very superficial and very brief. There was hardly anything on Azkaban. He began going to the library again, but he didn’t find anything new.
“No idea. Ask Luna when you get the chance. So why don’t you go to Madam Pomfrey?”
“We don’t have a choice, Harry. Either we split up or we fail.”
Malfoy looked exasperated.
“It was a jelly-legs jinx, alright, calm down!” said Ginny, shaking Ron off her.
She nodded.
Draco was dumbfounded.
She looked up, blinking as she resurfaced from the text.
Half an hour later, the door swung open and Harry barged in, out of breath and looking completely disoriented.
Draco shrugged.
It was ten to midnight, so really not that late, but too late for the phone to ring. No one but Mr Weasley ever called them, they had really only gotten the thing installed in the first place to indulge him. But now the sharp noise was cutting through the quiet like a siren and Harry’s chest tightened. He got up from his chair but didn’t reach to pick it up. It kept ringing. His heart was beating too fast.
They all watched the dim hallway anxiously as if keeping themselves from blinking might enable them to see an invisible person sneaking past the guards’ room to make sure the door was closed and further down the hallway to make sure it was empty. Draco wasn’t the only one who jumped a little when Harry reappeared right in front of them.
“And Daphne, I saw her on the station?”
Malfoy was an entirely different issue. A whole area of issues that was taking up more and more space in Harry’s brain.
She stopped and finally managed to lift her eyes to his face. He was grimacing around another half-sentence stuck in his throat.
"Do you want tea?" Malfoy asked stiffly.
“It was,” he said. “But I don’t think it would work.”
She hardly listened to him and was already flipping through the pages.
He would never understand how someone who knew about magic could be excited about pens. He had never minded using quills at Hogwarts. He couldn't imagine writing a transfiguration paper with a regular ballpoint.
“I will be with you in a second.”
“I see you got caught in the rain.”
“Goodnight, Mr Malfoy,” she said as he opened the door.
“I’ll just go,” she said quickly. “I didn’t mean to… interrupt.”
“Honestly, I miss you being captain, Harry. It’s too weird with Ginny – I can’t take orders from my little sister.”
He was expecting Harry to confront him again after their midnight run in on the stairs. He was bracing himself for that second conversation, but then a couple of days passed, and it didn’t happen and he started to doubt his certainty. Maybe Potter really had said all he wanted to say. Maybe Draco was just imagining the stares, the thickening air between them. It’s too late for anyone else to come to his room, but part of him still hopes that he’s wrong.
He stepped away from Harry’s table. He didn’t look disappointed, just resigned.
in his approach to learning it.
“Sort of,” Harry said. “Flying keeps my mind off things.”
It felt very self-indulgent to cast a patronus charm when there was nothing around for it to protect him from. But the light and warmth of it was so comforting and it made the secret room seem much less gloomy. He wasn’t sure what time it was, but probably still late at night. The glass in the windows was mirror-black and showed nothing of the world outside, only reflected the soft light of his patronus back at him. He watched it where it lay coiled on the sofa next to him. Despite its silvery glow it seemed almost like a real animal. And while he wondered about that, he remembered something, though he wasn’t sure from where: That the Order of the Phoenix had used patronuses to send private messages. A lot of information about the people who fought against Voldemort and the way they had operated had become public when the war ended. He might have read about their messages in the newspaper, or maybe it was just another one of the many stories that circulated in Slytherin.
“I should probably come with you to the library,” said Draco.
“I will,” he said and looked towards the stairs. “I just thought I’d wait a bit.”
"Alright, I believe you," she said.
Silver light, the shape of a snake blinked into existence, then collapsed. Hermione shifted her weight against Harry, her breathing was beginning to sound troubled again.
Harry shook his head.
“It’s practical.”
He hated Potter. He hated him so much.
Potter moved a few inches to the left, picking up a handful of acorns.
Ron sat down in one of the empty chairs. Harry stayed by Hermione’s chair.
"I'll be quick," Harry repeated, and then headed up the stairs.
a few months earlier.
He reached for the pumpkin juice and poured himself a glass.
He had told Malfoy that he would try to convince them to come back, but he would just have to explain it to him later. Make him understand that he couldn’t. It shouldn’t even matter if he understood – he didn’t owe Malfoy anything.
"I don't suppose you're going to be generous enough to wait out here, are you?"
“Did you order this?”
Potter nodded almost imperceptibly, picked up his elderberry-leaf and returned to his seat. Draco stayed by the table, taking more time to pick out his ingredients than Potter had. When he returned to his cauldron he cast a quick glance towards Potter’s table to see if he was spilling everything to Granger and Weasley already, and he was relieved to see that he seemed to be keeping his mouth shut. He wondered if he would show up. It might have been Potter’s idea, but Draco was really the only one who had anything to gain from an alliance.
“You’re really going to make me say it?”
He grinned and turned away to walk down the hallway. Draco stayed by the suits of armour and watched until he turned a corner and disappeared. Then he headed back to Slytherin.
Granger smiled awkwardly.
“I don’t know why she went off like that. It has never happened before. Whenever I talk about last year she just looks bored and tells me to get over it.”
They entered the Great Hall, and Draco halfway expected the aurors to be waiting for them right inside the doors. Or that the hall would fall quiet when they entered and everyone would turn to stare at them. No one did. No aurors rushed out to arrest them. They walked to the Slytherin table and sat down like they would on any other morning. Draco poured himself a cup of coffee. He kept an eye on the doors, and didn’t have to wait long before while, McGonagall and Sprout showed up. They looked a lot less grim than he thought they had outside. They didn’t even glance towards the Slytherin table.
“Yeah.”
“It isn’t that kind of strange,” he said.
“It’s not like there’s much else we can find out without going, is there?” she continued.
The door closed behind Granger and he was left alone with Lovegood. They looked at each other and there was a moment where he thought one of them might comment on what had just happened. But that would have been like striking an alliance after Granger had left, that would have been looking for an understanding with the other, so they didn’t say anything. Instead she cast her eyes back down to the parchment in front of her and Draco shrugged and looked away.
“No, you shouldn’t have!”
"You're not. Most wizards don't care. It's only for densely populated muggle areas, so it's not like most people need to know. And you don't normally get in trouble unless the muggles see you, but since I'm… newly immigrated they're keeping an eye on me. Monitoring magical activity around the flat and such. And they put the Trace on me again."
Malfoy shrugged.
Malfoy held up his hands placatingly.
“The wizard’s gone, we’re all that’s left for them to feed on down here.”
“Hi,” he said, coming over to Harry’s bed.
“There’s a tube station right near it,” Malfoy added.
It had been difficult to get her to listen to his apologies, but they had fought before and they had made up before, and eventually she just sighed and said it was like sixth year all over again, and what was it he needed her to do? He had told her that they were meeting the Gryffindors because of what had happened while he was in Azkaban, but not much else. She had agreed to come with him, not to be enthusiastic.
“What the– who the fuck are you?” she cried as she threw a wordless hex at them.
"Fuck if I know."
“How can
Draco immediately averted his eyes – Merlin, what was wrong with him? He hadn’t dragged Potter out of his bed and all the way to the other end of the castle just so he could leer at him.
“Is he still dating the Weasley bitch?” she asked.
of what he had done would allow him to walk into a room and not be met with immediate suspicion, or at least not be met with that from Potter. And when Potter brought him his wand, and they had talked and it had been perfectly civil, he had allowed himself to believe it had actually worked. Clearly, that wasn't the case. Draco gestured towards the bar.
“You should know better.”
“I’m really tired,” said Draco. “Maybe we should just head back and try to get some sleep?”
“What?” said Harry and Draco at the same time.
“I probably would too. Okay, so how did the knights move again? Can I do this?” she asked, and took out one of Ron’s bishops.
“I saw him talking to you outside.”
Harry reached for another piece of toast.
didn’t even come close to covering it.
“You’re being an arsehole, Potter!”
“Well, Harry just announced that he’s meeting Malfoy tonight,” she said.
“Do I?”
“I don’t know,” he says.
Draco nodded.
“This... Hello. This isn’t Mr Weasley,” said someone carefully in a voice that was decidedly un-Weasley-like.
"I can't be the only one who didn't know about the apparition points," Harry grumbled.
“That’s what Hermione said, isn’t it? We could allow him in on it and all, get him to tell us what he knows and see if this was something we still thought needed to be done, and then if it was, we could see if we trusted him enough to bring him along. And we don’t.”
He managed a smile, though not quite as bright as hers.
"Draco, seriously-"
Potter might have tried to say something then, but before he could get any words out, his grip on Draco's arm tightened as he doubled over and retched, emptying is stomach on the pavement.
The name sounded different when Malfoy said it. He spoke it with the same respect that he had for his own family name, pronounced so the pure blood could be heard, the tapestry of the Black family tree unfolding in every syllable.
“I hate that spell,” Hermione said.
Then they went into the sea of dementors and it parted for them, but only just. Draco walked quietly beside him now, his wand held steadily, his snake patronus beside him. It had been easier for Harry to forget his own fear when Draco was panicking before. Now he could hear his words echoing in his mind:
Another rush of angry words stopped in his throat and became air. He exhaled.
over him!" he snapped. "It wasn’t about that. I needed some closure so that I can-“
“Right,” said Malfoy’s voice. It sounded weird, not like Harry remembered it at all. “Of course, you were expecting a call from Mr Weasley,” he continued. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t take up any more of your time, then. I'll try again some other time-“
!” cried Ginny and the red light caught Pansy in the chest, throwing her off her feet next to Granger, the wand flying from her hand.
“Yeah, she went upstairs.”
“You asked me to meet you here,” said Harry, interrupting him. “You said you wanted to discuss a truce, so let’s do that.”
“There were dementors.”
“This whole idiotic thing started because I thought some things might have changed after the war and – I don’t know, maybe I felt guilty about some of the things that happened to you, and it really messed me up seeing you at your trial, and you played it well, I’ll give you that. For a while I really thought that this,” he gestured to both of them, “whatever it was could work out somehow. And then I was reminded what an absolute shitstain you are, and I’m not going to forget that again. I never want you near me or any of my friends again.”
Harry’s grin grew wider.
But in the end, he goes anyway.
“Thestrals?”
“I wasn’t going to-“ he cuts himself off, swallows. His mouth is dry.  “I couldn’t- I didn’t want to-“
"Malfoy, hi, it's Harry," he said.
Draco scoffed.
Still, he decided, it was nice. The wine was excellent. Pansy claimed the seat next to Draco when Daphne got up to go to the bathroom. She made a big show of mourning Draco's wardrobe.
Now it was Harry’s eyes that went to Malfoy. He looked worried.
“Inter-house unity and all that,” he continued, blabbering away to stop himself from thinking. “It would probably be a better bonding exercise than plotting to prevent the atrocious crimes of our government.”
“Why don’t you fuck off?” he says. “Go snuggle with your girlfriend instead.”
“It might take a long time, but I’m sure eventually-“
“I’m here.”
It swung open and they climbed through the portrait hole.
Malfoy ran a hand through his hair.
She cut him off again:
“Well, I’m not just going to stand here and wait for you to say something!”
“Please don’t do this, Harry. I heard how you talked to each other in Potions. And to be honest, I probably wouldn’t have noticed anything weird about it, if Padma hadn’t told me that she saw you and him meeting down on the quidditch pitch last night, when you’d told us you were going flying by yourself.”
“Drink your whisky.”
“I don’t want them to.”
“No one has forced you to be here.”
"Appreciate it while it lasts."
“We’re not doing this again,” he breathes.
“I don’t really have to conjure the memory,” he said slowly. “Not anymore, I think. I can just sort of… feel it. I know what my patronus is supposed to feel like, and it’s the feeling of the memory I use, but I don’t actually have to remember it.”
“Be careful,” said Granger.
“Take care of yourself, alright?"
“I did worse things than you.”
“Tell them not to worry,” he said.
“You going somewhere?” she asked.
A few months after that, Harry watches paralyzed and hidden under the invisibility cloak when Dumbledore offers to hide Draco from Voldemort, and there is not any part of him that doesn’t wish for Malfoy to accept.
“I don’t know.”
Potter looked unconvinced. Draco didn’t care.
"Sorry," Potter mumbled when he was done.
At least that’s the plan, and then Harry finds Draco crying in a bathroom and everything about that is wrong. Draco throws the first curse, and the fight is about everything that happened the year before and everything that has happened to each of them over the summer and it’s about the war they are both being sucked into and it’s about nothing, until Draco’s chest is sliced open and he collapses onto the waterlogged floor with a splash, his wand falling from his limp hand and blood soaking his clothes and turning the water around him red.
“Password?”
"I think there's a table in the back," Pansy said, taking Draco's arm and dragging him with her.
“Don’t get me wrong, it was great back in fifth-”
“Come off it, Ron,” said Hermione.
“Don’t tell them.”
Harry flew over the forest the next night too, and the night after it, and for three days he felt better. Less anxious, less angry, less out of place. School was manageable, Ron and Hermione were easy to be around. Then on the night between Wednesday and Thursday, his nightmares came back. He woke up gasping for air and covered in sweat. He scrambled frantically around in the darkness, groping for his wand and feeling his heart pounding hard and hectic under his ribs. He could still sense the screaming, see the snake and the inhuman face, the graveyard, the bodies. His fingers closed around the handle of the wand tucked away under his pillow.
Ron pulled out mugs for both of them while Harry scraped eggs onto his plate. Ron cleared his throat.
“It’s nothing,” said Draco carefully. “You didn’t do anything. Now let go of me.”
“Just go ahead,” he said. “I’ll be there in a second.”
Draco glanced at Granger who was frowning.
Draco was quiet.
“And now it’s never going to go away.”
“I’ll take it as a compliment,” she said, but her smile was that of someone who likes the idea of murder, not receiving a compliment.
Draco was at Hogwarts and how
"It's amazing."
“No,” said Draco. “I honestly have no idea.”
Draco pulled out his own watch and tilted it so the patronus light fell on the clock face. The second hand was quivering, but it didn’t move.
There was a moment of awkward silence as the conversation stalled. Then Granger cleared her throat.
“I don’t know, in my experience near-death experiences really bring people together,” he said.
“Oh, please-“ said Granger, but Potter cut her off.
But Potter just looked surprised.
He listened to the sound of her footsteps as they receded up the stairs to the girl’s dormitories. Then he stuck his hand into his pocket and pulled out the note. It was a long walk from Gryffindor tower to the Astronomy tower, and he couldn’t even get his invisibility cloak from his dormitory without risking that one of the other’s would ask him where he was going. He looked at the two staircases, the one leading to the girl’s dormitories, where Ginny and Hermione had just vanished, and the other that led to the boy’s dormitories where Neville, Dean, Ron and Seamus were probably asleep by now.
“You’re zoning out. We’re supposed to discuss the chapter questions.”
He cracked a tired smile.
"Hey!" he called after one of the bartenders, knowing full well he was being rude, but at that moment he couldn't have cared less.
“The old Black family-“
She turned to Malfoy.
“In Azkaban?” she asked.
What the hell had Malfoy been doing, going around showing off the mark?
Draco had been biting the inside of his lip without noticing. He could taste blood.
“’morning,” someone said.
“But it just stopped,” he said. “They both did.”
“When?” asked Harry, casting a confused glance at Draco, who was at a loss for words.
They went down another staircase and then the auror unlocked a heavy iron door and a gust of cold air brushed against them, making Draco shiver. He hesitated for a second, before stepping through.
Harry wanted to grab him as soon as he was within reach, to shake him and scream at him and hold on to him and never let go again, but Draco hardly even looked at him.
"I was tired. Anyway, I'm heading out. I'll talk to you later, alright? "
As soon as he had secured the lock, he mumbled the counter curse and Lucius scrambled to his feet, throwing himself against the bars.
“Why-“
“Ask the other Slytherins to stay away from them too.”
“Draco Malfoy,” called a sharp voice.
“I saved your life too,” he said. “Back at the manor. If I had told them it was you, the Dark Lord would have killed you all.”
“I saw you that night, when Dumbledore-“
“Pansy-“ Malfoy began, reaching for her arm to get her to sit back down, but she brushed him off.
Harry woke up feeling like shit. His room was dark, but there was a sliver of grey daylight coming through the heavy curtains, falling across his bed. He had fallen asleep with his glasses on. They were greasy and halfway askew; he could feel where the frame had been cutting into his cheek.
people.”
When he came back, Draco and Mark were gone and Harry felt his stomach drop inexplicably. The rest of the group were still at the table, louder now, and Harry considered leaving then. But his coat was still on the back of his chair, he would have to go and get it, and then he would have to make up some kind of excuse for why he was leaving that wasn't just "Malfoy isn't here anymore."
“Thanks.”
“How soon?” asked Harry.
Pansy strode past as if she hadn't even noticed the Gryffindors, Greg kept his head down and followed her, and Potter and his mates seemed too engrossed in their own conversation to notice, but then Longbottom looked up and caught sight of Draco. He stopped in the middle of whatever he had been saying; the grin slid off his face and the others turned to follow his gaze. Draco locked eyes with Potter, whose expression was frozen and unreadable. Draco felt Blaise's hand on his arm. He ducked his head and hurried towards the table Pansy had claimed for them in the back.
“Is something wrong, Draco?” asked Tracey innocently.
“Sorry, what?” asked Ginny. “When did this happen?”
“She’s excellent. She’s really at ease with it. I think it might be from the DA, her running it last year and all that.”
Draco handed his broom to Luna. He reached his arm out to Harry who took it, trying not to think of how much significance that simple gesture seemed to carry.
Neville shrugged. Luna smiled brightly at him.
“I actually have no idea where to start,” said Draco, taking one of the chairs across from her. “Harry says you’ve been up here a lot. Where should I start?”
”Right,” said Potter. ”You’re welcome. That was the agreement, right?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Draco and Pansy appeared on the path that led to the gates of Hogwarts. Weasley and Granger were waiting for them a few feet ahead. A second later, Longbottom and Lovegood appeared in close succession. Two more cracks snapped behind them and they turned to see Potter and Ginny stumbling onto the gravel.
Granger raised her wand – Draco recognized the movement of the spell, he had seen it too often by now, but had never expected it from her. He stared, too stunned to move. Then she pronounced the first syllable and he lunged for her.
"I don't know,” he said. “He wanted to meet."
Harry’s warm hand was pulled away and Draco watched him spin and disapparate. For a moment he was alone on the coast. His robes had been charmed to keep him warm but he still had goosebumps creeping down his arms. He eyed the silhouette of the house where it crouched low in the lyme grass. The windows were dark but it was probably too optimistic to think that both the aurors in there were asleep.
The four days passed uneventfully and so fast Harry felt sure they must have skipped at least one day entirely. He had left potions that afternoon and when Draco passed with a whispered “see you tonight”, he had had a moment of confusion where he had no idea what he could have meant.
He could actually smell himself. The sour scent of sweat and beer clung to his clothes and his sheets and felt like a grimy film on his skin.
"No, George just dropped them off yesterday."
He flipped the magazine open to the page of the article. There was the picture of Heather and Ginny. It had been taken from afar and the quality hadn't become better by being plastered over half a magazine spread, but you could still make them out: the two of them in their uniforms, walking off the field after a match, Ginny with her arm around Heather's shoulder, leaning in to kiss her cheek. And next to them was some awful portrait of Harry that he was pretty sure was a lot older than the one of Ginny, but he supposed they didn't bother hunting him down for pictures of his angry face any more - they must have at least a couple of hundreds stowed away in their offices by now.
“We should get some sleep,” she said, her eyes still fixed on their group.
Harry shrugged, pretending he couldn't feel his heart rate picking up. It hadn't been a secret. It really hadn't. He just hadn't told anyone; telling Malfoy was the first time he talked about it to someone who wasn't in his immediate circle of friends. It hadn't been a secret, but it had been something people didn’t need to know. They knew the media would be all over it when they found out and neither of them wanted that.
He kept an eye on the top of the staircase and got just a glimpse of magical light before it was extinguished. Draco tensed – whoever it was, they had no reason to try not to be seen if they thought no one was up here. Soundlessly he lowered his feet back onto the floor and crept a few feet along the wall. From where he stood, he would see the person on the stairs before they saw him. He drew his wand and watched as the figure appeared. Then he recognized the silhouette.
“Well, I did.”
at them, which was really the direction we had been going in before…”
But Malfoy’s face just curls into a disdainful sneer, painfully familiar and after all this time painfully transparent too; on his gaunt face, there is hardly a trace of genuine arrogance.
She hesitated, then nodded.
“That’s good,” she said.
“Get to the point,” he repeated. “Or I’m leaving.”
“And I was wrong. In sixth year, when it mattered,  you were right and I was wrong.”
“Yes, but it doesn’t have to be
“Come on, Malfoy, don’t be an arse,” he says, and Draco glares daggers at him, but he still steps back enough to let Harry inside.
Hermione had put Malfoy’s name at the top and below was a list of chapters and sections in different books. There was nothing else.
They all turned around to see Pansy climbing the stairs to catch up with them. Draco offered her his arm when she reached them.
They spilled out onto the platform in the chaos of parents and students and screeching owls. Harry turned to look back up at the red locomotive still belching smoke into the air.
“I don’t have a fireplace.”
. He doesn’t deserve
She looked up at him.
Padma and Hannah might have left at some point. And then there had been a lot of people Harry didn't know, they might have been Terry's friends. One of them had asked for his autograph. Was that when he had decided to leave?
“Have you smashed up your
He was looking at his hands, folded in his lap. They twitched.
"You know," he said, "I thought you were going to crash at Seamus and Dean’s place."
“Well, no. It was Luna’s idea, actually.”
"I can't believe you work at Starbucks," Harry said.
He thought they had been acting pretty normal. Ron shrugged.
“It used to be a werewolf. My boggart. That’s why it didn’t even occur to me… That’s why I didn’t figure it out.”
“How is it different?”
They watched her go up the stairs.
He felt the exact moment he lost control of it. He had been sustaining it, feeling no strain even though it had gotten further and further away, and then out of nowhere he had been cut off. He wondered if it had made it to the Gryffindor dormitories or if it had just flickered out in some hallway.
“Yeah, and you’re the only one I know who doesn’t think it’s a compliment.”
“I know a spell,” he said.
“Goodnight,” she said.
Potter huffed out a laugh.
“Good.”
"Any idea what that girl was on about?"
“I didn’t think you’d show up,” he said.
His mother reached for him, and he freed himself from Slughorn’s grip and walked into her arms. She held him a long time before she let go.
But thinking about Ginny and watching Ron and Hermione stung less now than it used to. Which could possibly be attributed to Malfoy, which was endlessly weird.
Potter crossed over to the wardrobe and Draco followed. He was getting nervous again. He took up position a few feet back and Potter turned to look at him.
“No. I guess they don’t."
He could see one auror lying on the floor right by the door, but the other three were still standing. Ginny was the farthest away from him, quickly retreating down the gallery as she took on one auror by herself, throwing curses like mad and dodging the attacks as well as she could in the narrow space between the wall and the railing. Between her and Harry, the other three were duelling the remaining two aurors, who still hadn’t noticed him and Draco.
“It’s Azkaban. I’ve found something about the dementors.”
He pulled the wand out of his pocket. He had ended up spending half the night looking for it and had finally found it stowed away with some of his old Hogwarts stuff. It had been greasy with fingermarks and dusty too, so he'd polished it and wrapped it in a cloth before going to see Malfoy. Now he kind of wished that he hadn't. It looked too nice, like it was some sort of gesture. He watched Malfoy fold back the cloth and gingerly take the wand.
He looked out the window again just as the train started to pull out of the station. The platform was a sea of faces and waving hands. In fact, he hadn’t even opened most of the letters she had sent him. He hadn’t wanted to deal with the world, and that had meant Pansy too.
“Uh, yeah. I was with Malfoy.”
“Watch your tone, Harry,” said Ron coldly. “I think you’re starting to take after your favourite Slytherin.”
“Well, it was all a long time ago,” he tried.
“We have to find the source. We have to kill them, and we’re in a hurry, so now is not the time to be a coward.”
“They won’t respect you just because you throw curses at them,” said Pansy. “You’re just confirming their prejudices.”
“Okay, I suppose.”
“I just wanted to say that I’ve thought a lot about what you said the other day,” she said. “About me not going Azkaban.”
Harry grimaced.
Hermione shrugged.
It was probably the one back by the Black residence. By
“Alright,” he said instead.
And really, that was just as hard for Harry to believe as it was that he was leaving Hogwarts.
The occlumency lessons are over before they’ve begun. There’s no way Harry can allow Snape into his head; he knows he’s skewing the proportions of things, that Voldemort having access to his mind is worse than letting Snape see a handful of random memories. But this is one humiliation he won’t stand for. Not under any circumstances.
“Malfoy?” Ron repeated.
Then they heard Mrs Weasley’s voice calling out to them over the noise. A cold hand grabbed Harry’s wrist. He looked up at Draco’s strained face. Harry took his hand.
"I said I'm fine."
“Happy birthday,” he says.
“Harry,” said Hermione. “Look.”
“And he shouldn’t have to fight this fight either!”
“Yes," Harry said.
She picked up her books from the floor.
Malfoy looked sceptically at him for a long moment. Then he shrugged.
“It’s a way of coping with your presence,” he said.
”Are you alright?” repeated Blaise.
“Why not?” he said. “Because I’m not in Gryffindor?”
"Emma, don't-" her friend grabbed for her, but she was too quick and in two steps she was back by the counter.
“It’s strange,” he said coldly. ”I have this memory of you actually complaining about them making us out to be villains, and now here you are doing exactly the same thing.”
“I heard you, I – why? Why would you want that?”
“I almost didn’t.”
“Alright,” he said. “I’ll remember that in the future: Beware of Hermione Granger, even the chosen one is scared of her. Anyway, shall we get started?”
Luna shrugged.
“I’m just being honest!”
“Makes sense. Considering.”
He scoffed.
"You were drunk."
She smiled.
He knocks on the door to the attic room and waits. There’s a moment of silence, then the sound of footsteps. The door is cracked open. It’s dark on the landing but the light is on inside, Malfoy is lit from behind and it’s hard to make out his expression. He is leaning against the doorjamb and keeps his hand on the handle, blocking the opening.
“No. It wasn’t really anything,” he lied, “Honestly, I’d rather not go over it again.”
Harry sunk into the couch and let his head fall back against the backrest.
“I regret it so much.”
"It's fine," he said. "You're just drunk, we've all been there."
“I don’t know, but you’re being all snarky and condescending, and you usually reserve that for people who aren’t me.”
“I thought I heard someone,” Potter says.
“Draco Malfoy…”
“You could have just ignored her.”
The pub wasn’t crowded, but it was the sort of place that would feel cramped no matter how few people were in there; the air thick and stale, too many tables squeezed into too little space. The stools by the bar were occupied by a handful of worn, smudgy men who looked like they had lived there for the last twenty years. Harry had the urge to go back outside and check the name of the place again. Not only was it decidedly muggle, it was also not, in even the slightest way, posh. It seemed the last place in the world one would find Draco Malfoy, and Harry had just decided that it had to be some sort of misunderstanding, that it probably had been a joke after all, when he spotted him, sitting by himself in the corner, two untouched pints in front of him. He was staring emptily out the window and clearly hadn’t noticed Harry’s arrival. Harry glanced at the door. He tried to remember why the hell he was doing this. He had already taken one step back towards the exit when Malfoy looked up and noticed him. For a moment, he just stared at him, stiffening visibly in his chair, and Harry froze as well, staring back, and for a second it was like all the time that had passed since Hogwarts melted away and they were fifteen again, glaring at each other across the great hall. It felt like a lifetime ago and at the same time, being face to face with him again, it felt like yesterday.
And finally, Madam Pomfrey turned to Ron and Harry.
He knocked on the door to her dormitory.
"Right…" Harry said.
Malfoy shrugged.
Draco looked back at the Hufflepuffs as the rest of the group descended on their friend,whose wand now hung limply at her side – was she crying?
“I still think it’s completely unreasonable to have us redo this year and then make us take the same classes all over again,” added Daphne. “At least they could let us drop the things we’ve already passed with proper teachers.”
“I suppose you’re right. I’ll come with you, though.”
Ginny sighed.
“Right,” he said. “That’s a problem, of course.”
should deal with the consequences.”
. Neither the good nor the bad. And Harry liked them, he liked them a lot - Irie even reminded him a bit of Ginny - but suddenly he felt a thousand miles away from them. Even the pleasant fogginess the beer had left in his brain, which usually made him feel less distant, didn't help much.  It was like her laugh had put an ocean between them, between him and everyone else at the table. It was a lonely feeling. It made him wish Malfoy hadn't left. Even if everything was strange and awkward and awful between them, at least Malfoy
She didn’t quite manage to sound casual.
Harry grinned.
“You should have warned me.”
“Oh. Right,” he said. “Yeah, I read the book.”
Ron doesn’t notice Harry’s moment of dumb horror, instead rambling excitedly about how brilliant it is, and Harry nods and flips through it, and then it actually is funny, especially when he notices how some of the headlines correlate eerily with Ron’s oddly changed behaviour around Hermione.
He knew he should be grateful that they’re trying to get him out, it’s obvious that few of them want to, it’s just that it’s difficult to be grateful when you’re scared. And he is. All the time. It’s a different type of fear from living at the Manor – he’s escaped the oppressive terror of knowing he was sharing his home with monsters, that his life or death was entirely dependent on their whims, but it’s been replaced by the constant paranoia about when they will catch up with him. He tries to be grateful, but it’s so difficult to remember what one kind of fear felt like and it’s very easy to be consumed by the one that’s currently happening.
“It’s been less than two months since you sat there trying to convince us all of how important this was and we both know that place is evil-“
“We cut off the source,” said Draco, the realization dawning on him as from all sides dementors turned their faces towards them. “They’re choking.”
His voice rose higher, grew more and more frantic as they walked away.
“Do you want to meet again tomorrow?”
"Is he?"
There wasn’t much time spent on hellos. As soon as Draco and Pansy had arrived, Ginny got to her feet and asked them all to split into pairs of two.
He closed the door behind him.
Malfoy looked at him with the apologetic expression of someone who has said his private thoughts aloud.
She was quiet. He hadn’t sat down again and was still watching her from the door.
"No, I am, but not until noon."
She gave him a stern look that reminded him terribly of Professor McGonagall. It was so odd the way Granger occasionally behaved like a teacher towards her peers, though he suspected she had toned it down quite a bit over the years. He remembered her being completely insufferable when they were younger. It was no wonder she had been so unpopular.
"You're terrible," she said.
“I’m leaving soon,” he says and Draco feels an awful tug in his chest.
Malfoy stopped. He looked down at his hands on the table.
One red jet caught her in the chest, the other the side of her head, and she collapsed. They all turned, wands raised, to the last standing auror, who was still fending off Ron and Ginny. Harry couldn’t tell which of their spells caught him, though one stunner came uncomfortably close to hitting Ginny instead. The auror stiffened and fell like a tree tipping over.
“Not at all,” said Ron. “He’s just as big an idiot as usual.”
“Okay. Let’s go,” he said.
He nodded with a quick smile in her direction, and then let himself out.
The hand against his cheek held him in place and forced him to look at her until his vision grew blurry and he felt the warm tears spilling over and running down his face. She let go of his arm and pulled him into a hug.
even talked about it, so how the hell was I supposed to know what was going on in your head? You never said anything, you never said you wanted it to be any different!“
It’s the summer before Harry’s fifth year at Hogwarts, the summer after Cedric’s death. Those endless, dry months where Harry hears nothing from any of his friends, he’s trapped at Privet Drive with the Dursleys and he can’t even dream about returning to Hogwarts, because suddenly that world has become dark and broken too. He is so angry, even angrier when he finally arrives at Grimmauld Place and finds out what has been kept from him, that it was kept from him on purpose on Dumbledore’s orders, that Ron and Hermione helped keep him in the dark, and they have been there together for months without him. And on top of everything he has a hearing at the ministry and is feeling all the powerlessness of facing a corrupt government that, just like the rest of the wizarding world, has gone from hailing him as a hero to treating him like an attention seeking child.
Draco rolled his eyes and hoped it was dark enough that Potter couldn't see his blush.
Draco looked up again.
“You boys are ridiculous,” said Hermione.
And at Hogwarts is Malfoy, who knows perfectly well that Harry isn’t crazy because his summer has been terrible too, though in other ways than Harry’s. He hasn’t been kept from anything, he is already hearing and seeing too much of what his parents have gotten into, the first Death Eaters frequenting his house, and where Harry’s wake-up call from childhood was Cedric’s death, Draco’s is seeing his parents scared and realizing that they are not as all-powerful as he has been allowed to believe for so long. Now he constantly overhears Lucius and Narcissa fighting, because things are different this time, Lucius’ high position with the ministry is useful to the dark lord, but he is also traitorous for having achieved it in his absence. Bellatrix is out of Azkaban, Draco has never met her, he doesn’t know what she is yet, only that she is his mother’s sister and that his parents are afraid of her.
“I know. And I think half these books have just been copying from each other, I keep reading the same sentences. And the other half are just making stuff up, it’s ridiculous.”
“It isn’t, though. It won’t be an easy year. Not for any of us.”
“I got a muggle job.”
“Don’t you feel bad about any of it?”
“Granger has found another book,” said Draco. “We think it might be the breakthrough we’ve been needing.”
“Say something! Are you there? Are you alright?”
“It’s not a
“I would appreciate if you’d turn down the sarcasm a bit,” Draco said.
Draco backed away from the table where Potter still sat and just looked at him like he had no idea what he had done.
“Pansy passed me on the stairs and seemed to be in a perfectly good mood – and lately her temperament after spending time with you has been closer to murderous annoyance. Considering how much you aggravate her, I’m surprised you’re still friends,” he said.
Harry crumpled up the note and put it in his pocket.
“What, you think Slytherins could have made it look good in second year when the Chamber was opened and everyone found out I was a parselmouth?”
Draco stood up.
“Then what?”Pansy snapped. “What do you think would have happened, Weasley? Do you think Snape would have resigned and Voldemort would have pulled his Death Eaters out of the school because one more house was uncooperative? So what if we were cowards, there were kids in Slytherin too, but as far as I know you never let a single person in green into your little hideout.”
The light went out. The corridor had been dimly lit even before he cast lumos but their eyes hadn’t adjusted and now they blind in the darkness. He heard the rustle and clink of Ginny going back to work on the door. There was a scuffle of feet as the other five people behind turned to face the end of the passage. Draco raised his wand defensively too, though he wouldn’t be able to cast anything in here without hitting one of his companions.
“No. No, that’s fine.”
Draco looked down at his forearm, where even in the dark, the ugly, red thing stood out clearly against his skin. He had forgotten – he couldn’t believe it. This was not supposed to happen. It had never happened before. No, he always,
“Draco-” he began.
“We just thought we’d try sitting over here today,” she said. “You know, everyone has been switching around a lot at the house tables this year so…”
“Exactly that. It used to remind people of my pure blood, noble birth and powerful family.”
Granger took a deep breath.
“And I was thinking I would go shopping,” Harry said. “We’re out of pretty much everything.”
“You really mean it, then,” she said, finally dropping the sarcasm. “You want to blow up Azkaban?”
“Honestly, Harry, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Neville made it sound like the DA was practically a refugee camp within the school last year, not really a duelling club. And even when we started it back in fifth year, the purpose was teaching kids how to fight and defend themselves. I know we joked about it, but we were turning them into soldiers.”
"Vanilla latte for… Emma?" he said.
Ron’s suspicions about Azkaban being what was bothering Hermione seemed to be confirmed when she, Harry, Ron, Ginny and Neville happened to get the common room to themselves for half an hour one evening. The number of meetings up in the secret room had thinned out over the last couple of weeks.
“There’s nothing to tell, professor. Things have been fine for half a year, I don’t see why there’s suddenly a problem now.”
I'm aware that it's totally a mess with the chapter titles when the first chapter is a prologue but the rest don't have titles apart from their number (this whole "chapter 4: chapter 3"-business) - if anyone knows of a more elegant solution to this, please let me know!
But he remained seated, and when they were all gathered, Potter crossed over to the door and locked it. Longbottom hadn’t sat down either; he was walking around the room, muttering silencing spells at the windows. Granger was pulling quills and parchment out of her bag. She had settled herself with her legs pulled up in one of the chairs and was taking down notes. He couldn’t read what she was writing from where he sat, but he suspected it might be an agenda for the meeting. It was incredible how that girl would turn everything into a school project. He wondered if she had made time tables and to-do lists for taking down the Death Eaters and defeating the Dark Lord. She probably had.
“Look, I get that you hate me, alright?” he says, voice pulled tight as a wire. “You have made that abundantly clear, and I’m not asking you to change that. You have every reason to hate me. I’m just saying that I can’t do this with you, and you pretending that you
“You didn’t have to come.”
“Sometimes.”
“Look, I know why we all hated him,” said Harry. “I’m not an idiot. But a lot of the things he did during the war, he really didn’t have much of a choice. He was seriously misguided, and I know that what he does now doesn’t change anything, he knows that too, but-“
They walked down the path where the thestrals pulled the carriages to the school on the first day after the summer holidays. Draco thought he had understood where the Gryffindors wanted them to meet, but no one was waiting for them. He looked back towards the castle.
“What do you mean it
“No. I’ll talk to her tonight when she has calmed down a bit.”
“What?” he said slowly.
He and Granger were in the secret room again, reading though the books, going over their notes. They still weren’t getting anywhere closer to figuring out how to kill the dementors. It seemed like all research on them had stalled when the patronus charm was discovered, and that was so long ago everything they could find was mostly guesswork. He had mentioned that perhaps it wasn’t possible to kill them, to which Granger had said that if anyone knew that for sure, they would have written it down. From what they were reading, it looked like nobody had even tried to find out. That was maybe an hour ago and they hadn’t said anything since.
Potter cast a look around.
?” he asked her.
Granger crossed her arms tightly across her chest.
"Really?"
“Yeah, that’s lovely.”
Draco fumbled for his wand, but she hadn't raised hers and she didn't hex him. She leaned over the counter and spat at him. Then she spun around and stormed out of there, her friend hurrying after her.
“Yes,” said Luna. “You do. But you don’t have to tell me what it is if you don’t want to.”
The dementors ahead of them had parted and instead of more dementors, they stepped into thick fog. Illuminated by the patronuses it glowed pearly grey, and through it they could just make out the wall and the corpse of a man slumped against it. Thin chains trailed from his wrists to bolts in the stone and made him look a mirror image of Rabastan Lestrange in his cell above. Only Rabastan had been beaten and filthy to look at, whereas the figure in front of them seemed strangely undamaged by his imprisonment. His robes were beautiful and looked untouched by time, though the style and fabric seemed foreign and ancient. The dead wizard was thin as a skeleton, but the skin still clung tightly to his bones and it was impossible to tell what age he had been when he died. The hair on his head was white, but thick and strong and it grew long enough to reach his waist.
“Yeah.”
Irie put a sympathetic arm around her.
With a dazed expression, she walked to the end of the room, went through the door to her quarters and closed it carefully behind her.
“I think everyone is doing that. I swear I’ve never seen this many parents and siblings on the platform.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We hardly even have a plan,” said Neville.
“I’m pretty sure it’s not gonna make much of a difference to them that you’re snogging him too.”
Harry scoffed.
"Yes. Hello, Potter," said Malfoy. "Fancy hearing from you today."
He reached for the pitcher.
"Did Mark know of this cunning plan?"
Nott knew that Draco had bought whiskey and had probably deduced part of the pathetic scene that naturally followed, but he was the sort of person who got more joy from hoarding secrets than spreading gossip, so he kept quiet too.
Harry didn't get to hear the answer to whether or not Draco and Chris were the only full-timers. He was too busy choking on his beer. Someone thumped him on the back as he coughed, trying to get air into his lungs.
it helps that Snape isn’t hovering around and doing his best to mess you up,” Ginny insisted.
Harry took a deep breath. He should hang up.
Draco glanced at Lovegood. She had put down the quill, but was still looking at the drawings.
“That’s an odd thing to ask.”
“We don’t use the cells in the bottom,” said the auror.
"I mean,” Malfoy persisted, “one would expect some of the muggleborn to have brought them along, right? Honestly, I never want to use a quill again. Did you know the ink dries almost immediately after you've written something?"
“You going to finish tying that shoe?” asked Blaise.
Hermione shrugged it off.
Draco frowned. He had thought he and Potter would be done with their private meetings now that he had mastered the patronus.
“I can’t.”
“We need their help. You heard what I said back there-“
"Sorry. I was trying to get the frying pan out of the cupboard when the toast caught fire. Everything just sort of crashed to the floor.”
"Does your mum know?"
He was also aware that he would probably cling to this memory forever, replaying it to himself over and over just to feel that thrill again of Potter’s hand in his hair, his flustered laugh. The way he hadn’t stopped smiling.
“I don’t want it to be,” he said quietly.
“What?”
“Well…” he said hesitantly. “I mean, no, not really. I think mostly she’s just old - from a time when it was more… common for the noble families to… have certain privileges. It’s not that she has something
“I haven’t travelled like that in a while,” he said flatly.
“I know,” said Harry. “Come on, I’ll walk with you to the apparition point.”
“You’ve been calling her a mudblood every chance you got for the last seven years.”
“Nothing,” he said.
Malfoy sighed.
Draco noticed but couldn’t bring himself to care about the amused tone in Nott’s voice.
“I don’t think I have ever antagonized your friends.”
“Please!” he screamed, “please don’t take it away! Please, I beg you! Stay!”
“You’re really serious about this, Harry?” asked Ron, looking at him like he was still waiting for him to tell them how it was all a joke.
"You know those can kill you, right?" Harry said.
“I expected as much, but I still want you to consider it. If it’s a no for now, I must ask you to talk to me instead. Things cannot continue the way they have so far.”
“Merlin, this is pathetic,” he mutters. “I knew there was never a chance it was real.”
"Yeah, that's me," said a girl.
He had tried talking to his mother about it, about what had happened during the war and the trials and the time he'd spent at Hogwarts. And then he had stopped trying, because he couldn't stand how she kept promising that things would be fine, that everything would be back to normal soon enough, like it was somehow possible, somehow
Since then he’s been moved from safehouse to safehouse, and he has been wondering about Potter. Of course he has. He’s been trying to piece together what his plan is from the fragments of conversation he’s overheard, but no one talks much when he’s around.
“Why do you even
“Okay,” he said.
“Right,” said Potter. “Right, so I know how it feels. I know it’s not exactly the same, or I guess it’s not the same at all but… I know he leaves deep marks. I never even thought about what I might want to do with my life if I actually survived. If I managed to kill him. I still don’t know. I never liked that I was supposed to be some sort of hero, but it’s weird to not… Everything’s weird now.”
"I need a cigarette," he said and stalked out of there.
“Let’s just give it a few more minutes,” said Ginny, interrupting them. “Then we’ll figure out what to do if he’s still not here.”
They both fell quiet. In the other end of the common room, a flock of third years erupted in laughter. Ginny looked over at them. She was curled up in her chair in a sweater that was too big to be her own, it looked like she was melting into it. Harry couldn’t read the expression on her face. He wondered if she knew the third years. Maybe some of them had been in Dumbledore’s Army. He wondered if she felt old in the same way he did when he looked at them.
Harry shook his head.
Those five feet between them feel like an ocean.
He couldn’t even look at Neville the whole day.
He was already at the door, his hand on the handle, when she spoke again.
He shrugged.
And then Ron pulls him aside with a self-satisfied grin to give him his gift in private. Harry unwraps the book and it’s like a punch to the gut – it takes him a second to get himself under control enough to realize that of course this isn’t some sick joke, and for a moment he just stares stupidly at the title:
He could still feel the dream pounding through him, the cold grip of terror in his mind.
Draco picked up his glass.
He pulled out his wand.
“Maybe it does.”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe the fact that I spent half a year with your dick in my mouth might have been a clue-“
They passed through the gates and the winged boars looked sternly down at them from their columns.
Since it was Gryffindor and Slytherin who had Potions together and Slughorn wasn’t the sort of teacher who made seating arrangements, the students had neatly split in half creating two sections in the classroom: one of green and one of red. This meant that Harry’s table was by the opposite wall of Malfoy’s, where he was setting up his cauldron next to Ron and Hermione. Neville and Ginny had taken the space in front of them – he still found it odd that she had classes with them now.
“I left the same time as Ginny and we met Ron in the common room, so they’re on their way. They should be here in a couple of minutes,” said Hermione.
There was no answer and Harry glanced back over his shoulder. Draco was still following closely behind him, but he wasn’t looking ahead; he had his eyes fixed on the nearest dementor and the light from his patronus had faded to a dim glow. The snake was only a thin thread of silver. As Harry watched, one of the dementors surged forward and the patronus snapped and winked out. Draco flinched and raised his wand reflexively:
"It needs to brew for a bit," he said.
The short haired, Indian girl next to Irie hid her face in her hands.
He turned around to leave. Draco watched him, still clutching his arm. He rarely had outbursts like this. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep that made him hot-headed, but right then he was almost trembling with rage.
“I had to go to the library.”
"Well, maybe you should," Malfoy said. "It's called making small talk. It's polite."
“Okay, well…”
“So is this what you’ve been doing when you weren’t stalking me around the castle?” asked Malfoy.
She shrugged. She was looking at her spell with an unimpressed frown.
“They breed?”
They left Azkaban. Their wands were returned to them back at the small house by the coast. They apparated to St. Mungo’s, but there is no treatment for dementor exposure except chocolate and rest, and after being told this several times by a healer, Narcissa took Draco with her back to the manor.
Malfoy looked up and Harry shrugged.
like him. But it had also called him near midnight, on an actual telephone and had just uttered the most muggle sentence Harry had heard from anyone in over a year, and really, it was all such an unlikely combination of things, it had to be a joke.
Malfoy raised his wand again, furrowing his brow in concentration. Harry watched him shift the grip on the wand. His lips moved, like he was murmuring something, but Harry couldn’t hear what it was. Then he took a deep breath.
“Then I don’t know what it is you think you’re doing,” he said, “because usually, when you follow people around to spy on them, that is considered stalking.”
“Don’t worry about it, I’m not doing anything anyway.”
Harry ran his fingers through the silky, white locks.
Lucius Malfoy sat motionless on the narrow stone shelf that protruded from the wall of his cell, huddled under grey blankets. He was thin. His eyes were empty. A sob escaped Narcissa. Lucius did not react at all to the screech of his cell door opening. Only when the stoat patronus stepped inside did he seem to wake up. He blinked. He stared at the silver creature.
Potter made a gesture, half nod half shrug.
"But you two seem close?" Irie said.
When she had disappeared up the stairs, Ginny turned to Harry.
Draco grimaced.
Neville grimaced.
“You know her?”
“I just cast a patronus, didn’t I?”
“I thought about it. I don’t really like the idea that it knocks you out completely for seven hours, or how long it is. What if something happens and you don’t wake up?”
Draco hesitated.
"So this is Draco," Irie said, and Draco twisted around in his seat to shake hands with the boy.
“You’re disgusting,” he said, turning away.
Potter closed his hand around the knob. Draco was a few metres back, Harry stood between him and the wardrobe.
“I know.”
Neville cut her off.
“But now they’ve all decided to dump you?” said Harry.
“It was for some stupid noble reason, wasn’t it?” Draco asks, a trace of a grin on his lips, and Harry nearly flinches at the words, a perfect echo of what Ginny said at Dumbledore’s funeral.
“Like Voldemort?”
“Of course you can. You’re the headmistress of Hogwarts. You’re a member of the Order of the Phoenix. You’re a war hero. You have more power now than you’ll ever have, and if you would just use it-“
The article was fairly vague, the Ministry clearly still trying to hold back most of the information. There were no comments to questions of who could be behind the attack or what their intentions might have been, though the Ministry admitted that they didn’t suspect runaway Death Eaters, since there seemed to have been no attempt to free any prisoners. Most of the official Ministry statement concerned reassurance that a great number of aurors had been stationed at the prison to act as guards in place of the dementors, and that it was therefore still secure.
“And you want seven different majors,” said Harry.
"If…" Malfoy began, but then cut himself off.
“Congratulations on the ground-breaking discovery,” he said to her. “Solving the mystery of how to kill a dementor at the humble age of 18. Looks like you really do belong in Ravenclaw.”
"I'll come."
“You all know he came back late after the holidays,” he continued. “Because he got out of reach of the patronus while he was there. I talked to him right when he came back, and he was acting… strange, which was why we got in a fight.”
Pansy, Longbottom and Weasley left. Lovegood and the other Weasley followed shortly after. When the door had closed behind them, Draco waited for Potter to speak, but he didn’t say anything. He was leaning against the windowsill, looking tired.
They raced up the final staircase and launched into the chaos on the topmost gallery. Spells were flying everywhere; one brushed by Harry’s face so close it singed his ear.
“It didn’t look particularly friendly to me,” she said.
He considered ringing the bell again, but then he honestly didn't fancy trying to persuade Malfoy to let him in. He dug his hands deeper into his pockets, his fingers finding the wand. He was doing Malfoy a favour here, and if he didn't want it, well then that was his own problem.
“You know, you should probably start calling me Harry,” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself.
She scoffed, but that was a quiet sound too.
“But he’s a bloke,” Harry said, because he had to. Someone had to.
They both shuffled back towards their own beds, but then Blaise stopped again.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Malfoy sharply.
“Malfoy, wait!”
He turned around and left while Harry stood there for a moment, looking after him. He watched him go and felt at the same time immensely frustrated and also inexplicably disappointed.
“You said you had the lock figured out,” he hissed.
"Of course we aren't," said Blaise and jostled him forwards.
Except it isn’t at all, they’re much older now, he should be mature about this, he ought to be able to leave it alone.
“Yes, I can see that. What an honour it is to have you join us, I haven’t seen you in quite a while. But perhaps you consider the subject of Transfiguration to be beneath you?”
He was still looking towards the doors where Blaise and Alain had disappeared.
Ron pulled Granger into a hug.
“You’re telling me? You’ll get detention being out after curfew. It isn’t worth it.”
“You mean at breakfast?” he asked.
“Alright,” Harry said with a mad, nervous grin. “This is it, then.”
On the days before Christmas it was mostly Weasley relatives who filled the house. Bill and Fleur came home, and Charlie and Percy as well. They visited graves on Christmas day, when the distant relatives had left and Andromeda had arrived with Teddy. That day was heavy, but afterwards everyone seemed to breathe easier.
“That’s none of your business. Now may I remind you that I am not the only one who is out past curfew, and I suspect that our new headmistress might punish even the chosen one for breaking school rules. Personally, I’m not enjoying this conversation in the least, so unless you’re going to hex me in the back when I turn around, I’m going to leave.”
He wanted desperately to turn and see Potter’s expression, but he was sure he would burst into manic laughter if he did. Or maybe he would start crying, he honestly wasn’t sure. He was so far from having any control over his body. He had still been rushed with adrenaline from the encounter with the boggart, and now he felt like his brain was rapidly short-circuiting itself. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead. He was going to die.
He looked away. She sighed deeply and picked up her magazine again.
“You’re shagging him too?”
He wishes he didn’t sound so bitter, but he can feel himself getting angry again at the unfairness of it all. There are so many things he has to do, that people need him to do, this is just another reminder that his life isn’t really his own and maybe it never was. It was the same with Ginny – they hardly had any time together, he had even less time to figure out his feelings about her than he has had to figure out his feelings about Draco, and then he didn’t even get to break up with her for normal reasons. And he’ll probably be dead by the end of this year if he doesn’t figure out a way to kill Voldemort, so does it even matter? Does it even matter which one of them he would choose, or that he didn’t know until now that choosing Draco was an option, when it’s so unlikely that all three of them will make it through the war?
“I won’t copy it, I just want to look at it - or just the introduction, at least. You could help me with the introduction.”
“Creepy,” he said.
“I’m fine, thank you.”

He leaned against one of the posts at the end of it and watched him.
"We weren't even trying that hard, we just didn't… you know, announce it or anything."
