It worked, quite well. Harry was approached a lot less. They got some glares but neither of them cares as they got to drinking their usual. Ron and Hermoine checked up on them, but after deciding it was all fine, they went back to socializing.  Though they did have to promise Hermoine that they would be able to find Hogsmeade by themselves later. Which they heavily nodded to, bursting out in laughter after. “Weasley did most certainly marry a mother. I swear. He needs it though. The poor lad would be lost without her.”
Harry took his sweet time to start talking. Mostly waiting till Draco relaxed slightly next to him, he swung his leg over the bench, watching him. God he had lost weight again, he looked like a living corpse with those dark circles around his eyes. “So.. I.. I’m sorry for what I put you through.” He said, you know. His plan had worked further than he had though it ever would. He had expected to approach Draco about a thousand times without result. He never actually thought of what he would say. Sober too damn it.
“I don’t know. it has to be something else but.. I am glad you told me. I will keep it in mind.” He smiled softly, finally getting up. “Would you like some tea before you go?” he asked.
After a few more hours, when the sun began to set, Draco got up from his meditation, taking up his wand and muttering the final spell to activate it. It nearly knocked him over. Maybe combining his semi alright Norse with powerful spells he didn’t know many of the side effects from wasn’t perfect.. but damn did it work.
“I don’t get it honestly. They hated each other more than anything. Look at them now. I haven’t seen Draco smile that much. Ever.”
Draco snorted. A messy letter. But a formal greeting. They reminded him of his own letters to his mother way back.  He made a mental note to write back as soon as daisy was back on her feet. she would have to work her stamina up to be able to deliver faster without risking her health too much.
“I see.. well that is settled then. If you do happen to change your minds. Please owl me.” Malfoy said, seemingly relaxing a little more.
“You look like you want to die Potter. Are you able to handle it?” Draco asked softly. Lighting up a smoke for the both of them.
“It’s really common amongst muggles, wait…” He searched up one of his favorite songs. That’s life by frank Sinatra. Malfoy’s eyes watered up. “That is beautiful..” he muttered under his breath. “So you’re telling me that.. this is a normal thing? You can just bring that with you? There is no spell?”
Harry looked drained himself and agreed without much protest. They agreed to meet with Hermoine, Ron and Pansy  in Draco’s room for some after drinks. Jackson was absolutely pissed and needed to sleep. Much to Malfoys amusement.
He was seething with anger. So damn pissed off. He apparated them out of pure spite. He was lucky he didn’t Splinch the both of them. They landed not far off of London. In one of the fields he used to go to as a child. He threw Harry’s wand at him , hoping to hit him in the face. “How fucking dare you?!” he yelled, ignoring the overwhelming need to hug the other and check him over. Ignoring how even grasping his shoulder had temporarily lifted the pull of magic on him and taken away the sore feeling after having the torture curse used on you, how it relieved the pain of the stinging curse.
The conversation was, as per usual, centred on the upcoming quidditch match. Although they weren’t allowed to play this year, Ron had discovered that it was much, much funnier to discuss quidditch when members of the opposing houses were present and involved in some friendly bets. Pansy Parkinson had surprised everyone by winning almost every bet she placed so far.
“We’re... um we’re going to have to move.” Draco nodded silently, not trusting his voice. They started moving very slowly toward the secret passage Harry knew lead to the infirmary. Draco’s hands gripped at Harry’s elbows and his mouth was a tight thin line as he tried desperately to control his breathing. Harry stepped forward urging Draco, who in any other situation, would be arguing and trying to be the one guiding them down the corridor, to back up a step. Draco was glad that for once he could just keep his bloody mouth shut and just follow.
“I don’t know why you would suggest that, professor, I’ve mentioned already that I’d bore myself with the routine of it all. If I didn’t mind working with criminals I would have thought to be an auror.”
”No.” Harry took Draco’s hand and lead him to the table and pulled out the chair, “This is a date.” Draco didn’t sit. He clenched his fists by his side and avoided Harry’s gaze.
”No! No, I’ll take the dare.” Harry said as he pointedly avoided Ron’s questioning stare. He promptly removed his trousers and swung them at Neville. “Anyway there’s so much foam it doesn’t really matter does it? Pansy. You’re turn. Truth or dare?”
“That’s harsh, Zambini.” He thought for a moment. “I’m going to save whoever’s toe I would’ve suck by saying I’d shag the new defence professor. He’s the youngest one of the lot and I’m not shagging any old bags.” He looked around and pointed right at Harry.
After a long relaxing shower, Harry made his way back to the common room, now dressed in his pj’s and went directly to bed. He was far too tired to do anything but replay the day’s events in his head before falling asleep. He slept well, and dreamt he was flying above the lake but every time he tried to turn back to the castle, a shooting pain would spark at his side and he was forced to continue up and away from his home. When he woke up, however, he was not in his bed and his neck ached terribly. It was probably due to the fact that he was lying on the floor at the foot of his bed with his head pulled back at an odd angle by
”It’s not funny, Harry!” He said in such a pitoyable tone that it reminded Harry of a younger Neville. But even Neville smiled after a while and Draco was hiding a smirk in his book.
“Don’t be a prude.” Harry snorted, getting up to stand behind him, ruffling Draco’s hair up big time. Managing to make his semi long hair look an absolute mess. Earning a grumble and an elbow to the leg.
“what are you smiling at Potter? I didn’t ask you to come here for nothing. Let’s get to business.” Draco said, waking harry from his thoughts as he handed him his drink.
They noticed the others staring in awe. Draco groaned lightly, pushing Harry off of him. “You’re Crushing me.” He huffed, hand on his painful ribs. Nothing he wouldn’t be able to heal himself.
“We’ve looked everywhere. Even to places he might’ve gone off too for work. Ginny wouldn’t tell us what happened but she seemed really upset about it.” Hermoine said. “There’s no use in looking tonight Malfoy. Its Friday, the streets are buzzing around here. Just stay, have dinner with us.”
An owl and a raven later and plans were made to meet in one of the bars at diagonally. Both seemed rather happy to hear from Malfoy. Even Pansy, who used to be as cold and stoic as he’d been, had written him a long heartfelt letter about how not a day passed where she didn’t think of him. How much she missed him but didn’t want to be pushy until Draco was ready to meet her again. How much she regretted their argument.
“I hope so..” Harry sighed, looking at him. Only now did Draco see how tired he looked. Drained and sucked empty.
“Potter, what are you thinking about.” Draco shook him from his thoughts, raising one of his brows. Had he asked something?
But here they were. 20 years later. Surviving, getting by. But most importantly, Draco was dropping off his very own son. He’d lost everything, his family home. His status… even his wand for most of those 20 years. But.. he’d gotten by. Now living in what was once a broken old family cabin up in the mountains in Norway, together with his… well his wife he supposed.. they didn’t talk for the most part but… they did do their best when it came to Scorpius.
“The kids ask for you you know. Why isn’t daddy ever here? Why can’t daddy come to the musical? I have to lie to them every time. They still think of you highly. But not thanks to you Harry. I raised them. I did everything by myself. Do you even love them? I know you don’t love me but at least love them.”
He looked around the Cabin. Fire was out. Windows locked, he had packed everything he could possibly need. Chickens would be fed with a simple spell. They would be teleported incase of a fire to Astoria and Brants. Everything was fine as he put up his final protecting spell. Apperating to the first stop. It took him a total of 8 stops, including one mid pond, but eventually he reached London. He was planning on staying a few days so he’d booked a room at the wizards Inn. Before he made his way there he dropped his hair out of the small bun he had been wearing it in, hiding his face behind it. Skadi had propped herself on his shoulder, looking around curiously.
Harry and Malfoy by now had found Seamus and Dean. Finding out they had married just a few years ago. “we broke apart for a while after the war. Dealing with things by ourselves. But then I met Seamus again. Being a chef out of all things. Can you believe mr i-blow-up-everything is a prized chef in Diagon?” Dean chuckled.
“come on Draco. Lets go. I’m certain Scorpius is excited to see his dad looking this fine.” Pansy smiled, taking his hand. “On three we all grab the Portkey hun.” She smiled at her boyfriend, who’s name was Jackson, born in France but moved to Egypt at age 7. His English had a slight accent but it wasn’t terrible. He seemed friendly enough.
He had to think about it for a moment. “Ah I… moved away from England with Astoria. Fixed up the old vacation cabin. Enjoying the quiet life.” He hummed, swirling the wine he’d just gotten and taking a sip. “Me and Astoria are divorcing however. We didn’t work in the long run and now Scorpius is in school there’s no real reason to stay together.” The other two nodded.
“Right. I’m.. I’ll…  I’ll grab the salmon before it burns, please do take place at the table” Draco seemed a bit taken aback. He wasn’t ready to talk about the war. Especially not to Harry fucking Potter.
“Are you.. did you mean it Potter? Are we.. friends?” he felt like an idiot for asking. Here he was a 35 year old asking a 36 year old if they really were friends now.
“Sounds good, don’t bother cooking well for Potter. He has zero taste, you could plate the poor man a rat and he’d thank you for it.” Malfoy smirked.
“we won’t trust me. And if Ginny tries to change her mind I’ll stop her. Its been 20 years since the war. You weren’t to blame for it. We were kids.” Harry huffed, he was sick of people still holding grudges. When he was an Auror they had the monthly case of death eater hunters killing an ex members partner who had nothing to do with it, killing their kids, beating up family members. It had been absolutely disgusting.
“You have different animals?! Oh Pansy I am so glad to have you in my life.” Jackson smiled, squeezing her closer.
“All you have to do, is sit straight, elbows low, heels low, just your toes in the stirrups and follow the movement of the horse. I’ll do the steering” Draco said, looking back at him. The puffiness of his eyes was gone.
By the time they returned Harry was battered, looking like he hadn’t slept for weeks on end and worked a long shift. There was dust all over his face and clothes. Draco laughed at him. “Lot more of a workout huh?” he asked, slapping him on the shoulder.
“We’ll figure it out Draco. Trust me.” Helve spoke with a thick accent. His voice was quite deep and harsh compared to his looks. He was no older that 25, quite short and scrawny despite his hard working at the farm he owned. His brown hair was thin and all over the place. He always wore a friendly expression but he didn’t like just anyone. He was a good friend to those he did like. And Malfoy was incredibly thankful to him.
“Doing quite well. After my mother passed I got her savings. A lot, so I set up a few bars of the kinky variety. Business has been very. Very good.” Blaise smirked. “Married 3 times so far. Following her footsteps well.” He hummed, turning to Pansy.
Dusting himself off he walked up to the door. Which opened just as he was about to knock. “ Evening Potter. Come on in. The food took longer than expected so its just finishing up.” Malfoy said, a bit cold.. but he was trying, stepping aside. “Evening to you too Malfoy. Should be fine. I can wait. “ Harry said, lowering his hand finally as he walked in and found himself a spot in one of the big chairs in front of the small fire. It seemed to be far colder up here than in the UK so the warmth of the fire was welcome.
“I’m glad you agree Harry. I’ll contact McGonagall to see what can be arranged. The castle would be the safest place. The new spell wont let anyone in with less than good intentions.” Hermoine said, taking out her wand and tapping lightly, soft scribbling from her bag indicating a note was being made on the matter.
So he thankfully grabbed his cigarette and made his way over to the court. Grumbling softly as he lit it. Huffing out some of the smoke as he looked around. it was fairly dark already but draco could clearly make out how much even this spot had changed, there was far more green around than before. The old waterspuwing gargoyle in the middle had a lovely flowerbed around it, some of the broken pilars had creeping Figs on them, they bore a poisonous looking purple fruit. Which was actually quite good for eating as long as you asked if you were allowed to take it first. If you didn’t do that you’d end up with festering purple blisters. Truly no fun.
He got onto the horse with ease. Loki was scraping his hooves impatiently as harry got onto the chair, plopping his helmet on and very shakily and carefully got onto the horse.
Malfoy sighed. “It’s busy. So he might come out to grab a bite to eat somewhere if he is still in London. Keeping up appearances. Ever thought about that?” he said.
He awkwardly took a seat with them. softly greeting them, taking another shot before… “Malfoy want a smoke. You look like you need one.”
He kept his mouth shut. Trying his best to deflect new guy getting into his head. He failed. After about 30 minutes, which felt like hours, New guy stopped. He took a sharp and pained breath. Did Harry succeed? He smirked to himself, the cut on his lip splitting open again before it hit him. It was worse than any curse so far. His insides were on fire. His lungs felt like they were collapsing in on themselves. He tried to grab for his throat but the cuffs he was in wouldn’t allow him, he fell forward, face first and passed out. Only faintly hearing new guy yell about who threw that.
Once back up he put a plaster on his finger to finally stop the bleeding, handing the raven her food as he went to write a note. “Did you have to bite the writing hand? Look. Its even worse than my usual writing.. though I suppose Draco would whine about it either way.” The thought of making Malfoy cringe made him grin. “There ya go. You’re free to stay for a bit if you need to rest up.” He hummed, handing the bird the note. “Now if you don’t mind I’m going to get to bed.” He hummed, dragging himself back to bed. Sleeping soundly and forgetting about the whole damn dinner until the day of.
So he found himself an empty cabin, rubbing his by now painful arms. He would have to find a counter spell soon, they were growing too tight, on one side the band was starting to cut into his arm slightly. Today he found however, they hadn’t tightened at all. It was the same as two days ago.. he could worry about that later to be honest. He was just tired now. Sleep sounded nice right? He made himself comfortable curling into the hard bench, Skadi on his lap for pats and…
Instead he felt a warm hand against his before the potion dropped into it. “You’re a terrible drunk Malfoy.” Draco shot up. “Potter?!” he croaked. “I what…”he blinked against the light. Grumbling against his sore muscles. “where am I. What did I do.”
Since they would have to be attached at the hip Harry agreed to take on horse riding for Malfoy, if Malfoy agreed to come to Weasley night. Which was meeting and visiting with the Weasley family every month or so for a family day. Harry had to explain that despite the divorce. They were basically his only family and Draco with some snide remarks about this being a far greater sacrifice agreed to it.
Hermione did however tell Harry she had been able to convince Malfoy to go to the Reunion, since it would be secure and safe at Hogwarts, and it would give him a chance to see his son. Make sure the kid would be ok. Had she lied to Draco and said Harry wouldn’t be attending because he was back to traveling? Most definitely. But only because Harry asked her too and she too thought that having them talk would be good to process everything and get Draco out of this mindset.
“It’s on then, let’s play after dinner. There’s a pretty good spelled field up in the woods. Some of the local wizards play there with us sometimes.  It’s not big but, it should be fun.” Seamus beamed.
After months and months of delaying he now had to.  He could no longer say no to going out with Ron and Hermoine. It wasn’t that he hated them. they just.. they always treated him like he was fragile. Like he couldn’t handle things well. He always felt more like a burden than anything despite their best efforts to make sure he wouldn’t.
Draco kept silent, opening his mouth to say something but shutting it again. It did explain a lot. The binding spell not lifting. The tightening  bands around his arms. How much he missed the other. He looked at Harry.
Either way he stepped into the store. Smiling at the keeper. No one here knew about his past. He was welcome everywhere.
When the door opened he could make out it was Malfoy in the faint light. His eyes were wide. “fucking hell potter what have they done to you?” he asked panting, not noticing New guy getting too, aiming his wand at Draco.
“You’ll do fine. Just keep off the fire whiskey. You were hammered last night and one of us has to be responsible. Clearly I am incapable.”
It stung Harry. It hurt, he cared about Malfoy. He did owe him. He remembered it all. How he had his life threatened because of Harry. How he still got them away from there.
“I grew up around them. I have taken the liberty of finding you a pair of horse leggings and you should fit my helmet. We should hurry. Its getting late.” Malfoy smirked at him. Harry was most definitely in for a ride.
He followed the others instructions the best he could with all the terms and things he had never heard off. Suppressing his nerves about having to get on the animal.
They were woken up at 9 by Skadi acting as Draco’s alarm. Cawing loudly at them. Draco responded with a grumble and she shut up. Harry stirred awake next to him. Groggily pulling him closer again.
“That’s too easy. I’ve got enough embarrassing moments. Worst is probably fainting on my own wedding day.” Ron snorted.
And so, after dinner, they called up Seamus and Deans friends. Gathering at the field. They had just enough players for a full team. Harry joined Seamus, Draco joined Dean. A few makeshift goals appearing.
Helve nodded. “I have picked out just the horse for you. Sigyn. She is one of the most well behaved teaching horses… want me to help you saddle up?” Helve offered with his scrunched up smile. Harry agreed and followed him while Draco stayed behind with Mormor, they were speaking in Norwegian, last thing Harry saw was Draco paling a little.
There was a short applause. Some sighs of relief, people were glad she didn’t bring up the past events and soon the great hall was filled with music, talking and drinking.
“Certain, take care yeah? Don’t get hurt.” Ginny called back. The girls yelled their goodbyes and as Harry yelled his back. Grabbing his wand and the port key.
“My friends grandmother, she lend me some books on old Norse magic. From what I made out this is one of the most powerful finding and binding spells. Which I thought I would need. The bands are a promise to the gods. I promised to find you and return you and asked for their help. Which I did. So it should be fine. But something is off. Helve thinks it might have something to do with us caring too much about one another. Which I admit I must’ve done. I was too emotional. Its all my fault really..” he shuddered, looking away. He felt ashamed. He was a Malfoy. Malfoy’s do not fuck up in terms of magic.. and of course he wouldn’t tell Harry something along the terms of a crush could have messed this up.
Despite having worked in the same building for five years now, the pair hadn’t spoken much. It was known throughout the school that the two had grown up as rivals and that despite the civil greetings when they were in each other’s presence, their rivalry persisted. They never resorted to violence, however tempting. They satisfied their rivalry by comparing the grades their students received in each course. Though they knew it didn’t really mean anything about their teaching skills, they still boasted greatly whenever their students performed better and weather they wanted to admit it or not, they both considered that they were committed and good at their jobs.
”I don’t care,” Harry moaned into his ear as he pumped his member into the long slender fingers that were wrapped around it. He grabbed Draco’s free hand and moved it to his bum, encouraging him to
“You think I did good?” She looked slightly relieved, “Oh! I just felt so terrible when I was pushing everyone out of the way, but I knew it had to be done. Would that be useful, you think? A healer like you’ve described mist be able to escort people through crowds, I suppose. Oh! This gives me so many more possibilities! I will definitely look into it, professor Potter!” Without leaving any time for a response, the girl was bouncing out the door in a flurry of red-hair.
A few creatures rattled in their covered cages but Harry paid them no mind. He replaced the desks to their usual positions and washed the board with a silent flick of his wand. He decided to deal with the papers he needed to grade first, and then later move on to the angry parent letters, if he had time.
“Well I’m glad, because Merlin knows I would have been the one to have to endure your constant complaining. I’ve had enough if your Malfoy obsession to last me a life time, I can only wonder how Ron must have felt back in school.”
”Truth: If you had to shag a teacher... life or death situation here, Nev... which one would it be? Can’t answer that you have to swim a lap around the tub with your eyes closed and suck the big toe of whoever you end up in front of.”
“No, I have to take care of the horses. Loki will be sad without you so I will take him on a long ride when I am home.” Helve replied. “will you be ok?”
Harry snorted in response. “Chin up Potter. Its only one night. Tomorrow you get to see your kids and after that you’ll be on your merry way home.”
Harry groaned, sliding off of Sigyn with great trouble, taking some time to stand straight. “Fucking hurts..” he muttered, making Draco laugh even harder.
Draco was out. He felt a lot better nowadays and had decided to pick up an old sport he used to enjoy. Horse riding. He had to learn it as a kid because that just was how wizards used to get around before apperating was a thing. His family originally got rich selling the best horses, ones people would now consider sport horses. Wizards horses had unicorn bred into them. they had a certain elegance, and depending on the line bred, they were enhanced in certain things. One of the Norse wizards he’d gotten to know bred horses with certain calming and healing effects. Normally ridden by people with disabilities and or severe anxiety issues. Mainly Fjords, tall fjords because well.. unicorns were gigantic.
Pansy then proceeded to strip in front of everyone to avoid revealing her favourite fantasy and she jumped back into the hot bath, tits bouncing, and called on Hermione. Who had whispered into Dean(who had blushed a viscous shade of red)’s ear what Ron’s secret talent was. Next was Luna, who avoided removing any piece of clothing by revealing that she’d slept with a Slytherin at some point in time. Luna then called on Draco.
The stairs that lead to the common rooms were in each corner of the room nearest the castle. On the right side, the black metallic spiral staircases lead to the boys’ dormitory and on the left, the girls’. The dormitories weren’t above the common room but rather on each side of it in order to let the natural sunlight illuminate it. The dorms looked like their old ones, but now the beds weren’t all those of the same house.
They rutted against each other in the hidden staircase as students from their dorm started to wake up across the hall. Harry’s hands slid beneath Draco’s shirt and up his sides and anywhere he could reach in the awkward position. He wouldn’t last long. His pleasure was building at a frantic pace that matched their mouvements and
Harry coughed and looked at the healer, “Could you enlarge the bed, please?” And then feeling the need to explain he continued, “I’ve got the bedside digging into my back”
keep this a secret.” He brushed a tear off the blond’s pale face, “Merlin! Hermione’s right. You are stubborn. You can’t see that you deserve love. You can’t admit that you like this just as much as I do and that you want more. You can’t accept that you’ve always been the most important part of my life. Even when I had a madman chasing me across the earth, I always thought about you. Worried about you! Even if I didn’t realize it, it always been you. You get me. You know exactly how to push my buttons. You know how I feel without me saying so how come you haven’t realized that I love you.”
“That won’t be necessary. I should have known not to give assignments to so many of my groups at once.” He walked around his desk and sat on the edge of it, crumpling a few letters in the process. “I wanted to ask if you’d thought of anything you’d like to do after you graduate since the last time we spoke.” She shook her head, “Well in that case, I might suggest you think about becoming a  healer.”
It took Skadi repeating her antics 10 minutes later to wake Harry up. She seemed about ready to sweep at him when he finally sat up. “Oh erm.. I can explain..”
Malfoy raised a brow. Potter missing? Why? Well it was concerning his son. And he would do anything to cheer Scorpius up. And potter missing wasn’t to great either. He sighed. “Lets go back Loki buddy, we’ll have to continue some other time.”
Without really thinking much more of it. He portkeyed to Grangers, knocking on the door. “Granger, Weasley.” He nodded as he walked in. “Is Potter here? I got a worried letter from my son wondering where the hell his best friends dad went.” He said, plopping down his bag. Hermoine and Ron both looking  quite shocked, making Malfoy roll his eyes.
“Ah. I asked you to be my friend. I was severely snobbish about it. You know. On brand. But.. I meant it. I wasn’t being pressured. I meant to be friends with you and I never forgot you turned it down. I mean I can see why you did it. But it bugged the hell out of me for years.” He stole the cigarette from harry who seemed a bit to baffled to take a hit from it.
“Goodnight Draco.” Harry whispered back, squeezing him a little closer which was met with Draco relaxing and officially passing out. Not much later, Harry followed.
But… tragic backstory and life events aside. Today was the day. An anxious, nerve wracking day he was sending his little boy to school. Facing a lot of his past enemies.  Thanking Merlin for his panic and anxiety medications as he walked around. Ah.. the first group of Weasleys walked past. Practically spitting in his direction. Thank god for Scorpius and his incredible ability to ignore everything. Either way, he held the boy close. Keeping his eyes on the kid..
“Hmm he still is one. But we’ve got it figured out. The trick is to not take it to heart.” Harry smiled, supporting Draco, who claimed to be too sore to walk all by himself.
He halted Loki, thanking merlin he had practiced actually standing still when being halted with the horse. Freeing Skadi from her letter after holding her close to his chest for a moment. “Good Girl.. you did well..” He muttered, putting her on his shoulder where she immediately nestled against him.
Harry stared, he couldn’t help but notice the pale white scars running over his stomach and ribs as far as he could see them. He held back on commenting on it. “Fine. Only once. And I am stealing a muffin for myself. “
Thankfully It only took Scorpius three days to get a letter to his father, Draco had been out fishing out at the river near the Cabin. Stocking up before fall and winter because fish would run low quickly. Even if it was just him eating it. He had learned how to sustain himself for the most part. Without magic, growing his own veggies. Hell, he even had a coop full of chatty chickens he took better care off than off himself.
Draco chuckled, ruffling the boys hair. “Good to see you kiddo.. and to meet you Albus. I’ve heard great things about you.” He looked at Albus, nodding friendly.
If he were to find Potter.. He’d ask him. If he considered them to perhaps be friends now. Really put it all behind them and no longer feel as lonely.. yes that would be nice.
Draco could almost hear his sons chuckle. See his cheeky little grin, knowing full well he’d broken a rule and here was nothing his parents could do. He smiled and sighed in relief… his son seemed happy. Safe.
Malfoy’s eyes went big. “So.. the music that always played at the store.. there is not a band behind a wall playing that… I was to afraid to ask what kind of spell they were using. It seemed very common there.” He was most definitely serious about this, making harry laugh again.
A weekly night trip to the flying fields to get some exercise and let out some energy as well as some planned visits with Helve and Mormor.
Smiling he read the letter. Scorpius was telling about how school had been lately and how he was glad his father was closer now. Daisy was excited to be delivering letters again. The old one eyed barn owl didn’t seem to really care but. What could he say about it. His kid had a vivid imagination and really cared about his bird.
By the time he came by, he felt a lot better. Something familiar seemed to be pulling him closer. A happy memory, something that made him feel so much more at ease, forget about the torture for a moment. He couldn’t help himself but smile as he felt it getting closer. Not knowing that whatever it was. Was walking right into the enemies arms.
As per deal, Malfoy got his first smoking break. They had set a limit for today when they found him packing three packs for one night. “You can drink till you drop… or till I think you’ve had enough but I’m not letting you destroy your lungs over this. Now on with it” Zabini’s exact words.
Due to what has happened, I think it is for the best I go back to isolation. Do not contact me. It is ok. Take care of your family.
Before he could close his eyes. Luna, Neville and Harry joined him. Making him grumble slightly. No naps for him this train ride.
Harry of course wouldn’t be the one to tell Draco that he himself had grabbed Harry by the collar when they went out for another smoke, telling him that he forgot where the Inn was and he needed a place to stay, that he needed Potter to look out for him because he didn’t trust the others.
By the time it was quarter to midnight, almost everyone was naked beneath the water. Bathing suits littered the floor surrounding the tub and empty bottles of firewhiskey too. Not one person was sober enough not to giggle or hiccough when they spoke. Dean was sleeping on the edge of the tub and Pavarti was constantly humming to herself. The game was over. They didn’t have anymore ideas of what to ask each other. Ron and Hermione had gone off to snog in one of the showers and the rest were talking about sex. What else would horny teenagers talk about?
“My favourite pets! Are you having a party without me? I’m forgetting something aren’t I? Oh yes! Draco, Harry, did you enjoy yourselves this morning? I’ve got another present just like the last one for you! I wasn’t planning on giving it to you now but now I think is the perfect occasion!” He said maliciously.
The few Gryffindors that had returned for their eighth year were sitting in their new common room on the first floor. It had been a very difficult adjustment for everyone in their year. Every year prior to this one, they had either needed to climb or to descend the many steps to the towers and dungeons many times a day in order to reach their dorms. The new common, however, room for the eighth years had been created with the entrance on the first floor.
It was a long tiresome aspect of his job that he would despise if not for the pride he felt for his student’s success. He was nearing his last of the third-year essays when Ms. Jordan coughed to announce her presence.
“You bet against me?!” Pansy waved him off and the whole year started arguing about who had actually won.
Harry opened the door and let Draco in before he followed. He hoped the room had provided him with what he wanted. It still had trouble sometimes after the fiendfire.
”First! I think Neville should go first. He’s master of all dares after all.” Seamus said. Everyone remembered how Neville’s last date had ended. Cheers erupted and Blaise was given the ok to give Neville his options.
The entire school soon knew all about Nevilles run-in with the squid. The hickeys had been mostly healed by Madam Pomfrey but he still had many bruises up and down his arms.
ok. They weren’t stuck together by powerful magic. They were free. He shouldn’t like this, he couldn’t. He had responsibilities. His father would-
They’d managed to stand up and had made it the edge of the corridor when they heard voices. Harry accioed his invisibility cloak with his wand and levitated it onto himself and Draco.
“Maybe.” And Harry, who remembered how Draco had responded last time he’d said that smiled once more. They stopped eating after that to explore what Draco had suggested. A bed had conveniently appeared by the fire.
The blond seemed to get the idea and he moved a warm finger down his crack, not before giving the firm globe of his arse a nice squeeze.
”Potter! You bloody fool! I had the snitch!” Malfoy all but wailed as he lunged forwards, jumping off his broom and tackling Harry to the ground a few feet below, where they started wrestling for the small snitch that fluttered helplessly in Harry’s tight sweaty fist.
! The boggart Lucius stumbled and a moment later was covered in a tattered beige bag similar to the one Dobby had worn when Harry had first met him, but barely long enough to cover his pride. On his neck was a leather collar with a bell that jingled and his voice had gone into a high falsetto rendering him incapable of speaking in a menacing tone without sounding like a certain highly frustrated pink ex-ministry official. None of what he said now could be taken seriously.
“It makes me wonder why they never made a tunnel like this barrier to allow students to wander though the lake for care of magical creatures.” Hermione had said when they’d first examined their new home.
Harry plunged forward toward the end of the pitch and cheers erupted throughout the crowd. Malfoy, who caught on to what Harry was doing, used his broom as a bloody bat to throw a bludger at him giving him enough time to look for the snitch around himself.
The whole world faded away as soon as it begun. Harry’s eyes scanned around the pitch for the snitch while he dodged the many bludgers coming his way. He was only vaguely aware of the crowd cheering and Seamus commenting as he was almost knocked off his broom by the ball. It had been almost twenty minutes of fierce competition when he spun on himself barely avoiding a bludger and caught a glimpse of a gold shimmer at the other end of the pitch. Right next to Malfoy, who was also dodging bludgers left and right.
The first time Harry had seen Hermione drunk, he had discovered a completely different side of his best friend. It was fun to see everyone of his friends have fun after everything that had happened in his past years. These Saturday night bath parties were a way for him to let go for a while.
”Let’s go!” He said, impatience clear in his tone. He moved foot forward when he felt a warmth press against him and-
The picture of Draco pouting like a child and holding his pink cheek in the common room later that evening was enough for Harry to use for a Patronus forever.
match. Saviour vs Slytherin Prince. Loser must sing the anthem in the library and be forever at the mercy of Mme Pince.
”It was a stupid dare. Luna says that he’s nice and that he won’t hurt. He often comes to see her through the barrier and I’ve even seen her pet it! Seamus dared me to swim up to it! I didn’t think Delores would grab me and spin me around in the water.” He was trembling and his hair was wet.
It was a secret agreement between them that they not mention what it was they were involved in. It was just casual sex. They did start talking to each other more and more and it brought them closer together despite the fact that neither of them would admit it. They never kissed. It was just casual.
Its certainly been a while hasn’t it. 18 years since the trial? It has come to my attention that my son Scorpius has befriended your son Albus. Now before we both take rash actions and take them apart, which I am assuming would be best to save them from ending up hurt later. I would love to have you and your Wife over for dinner to discuss the matters at hand. Perhaps clear up some stuff of the past?
Malfoy flushed, thanking the darkness of the night no one could see. “It’s strange dude. But.. we stan. You two do go well together..”
He took his time getting ready. But they didn’t leave without him. Pansy made it a point to “Fancy up his hair the way he used to have it.” While her boyfriend just seemed in awe with it all. He was incredibly interested in the solar globe. Which had the entire solar system floating around it.
“father would’ve made me betray you. They would’ve forced me into something and made me hurt you. The way it ended… it was the best solution.” Draco sighed deeply. “Don’t make me depressed Potter. Let’s head back before Weasley thinks I’ve taken you hostage.” He grumbled. Walking off.
Draco snorted. “Good Bird” he chuckled, patting her little head as he carried her to the bird room. He’d send off Daisy this morning so she had the place for herself.
“Ah I see. He can be a bit mean. But do not worry. He means well. Let Sigyn connect to you. she is especially calming and protecting.” He ran his hands through the short Fjord mane, ruffling it up. Despite all the brushing, there was still dust coming up from her fur.
Letting out a deep sigh he went to the kitchen, grabbing some sliced beef he was supposed to use for dinner tomorrow. Figuring the Raven would enjoy some after a flight from wherever Draco seemed to live nowadays.
After the war. After being an auror for about 5 years. Harry had burned out completely. Nothing felt fulfilling anymore. He and Ginny had been together but.. even that didn’t bring him much joy anymore. They had a work schedule where one would be home when the other wasn’t. avoiding fights and facing their failing marriage.
Today, he dared carefully running a hand through the others hair, pushing it back to see his face. Tracing down his jaw before… pulling back to shake him lightly. “Wake up Draco, Breakfast time.” To which he earned a loud grumble. “Morning Potter.” He muttered, taking the cup of coffee “with too much milk” Harry held out to him. Taking a sip.
“Fair point. I suppose I hadn’t spoken to Draco in years till he and Potter met up. He’s… being Draco again. The snakey bitch I loved so much. He had bit of a breakdown over what happened but.. It’s to be expected. I don’t think he’s ever been able to forgive himself.” Pansy sighed. “I need to go find Jackson. I’m fairly certain Draco fed him drunk and send him off to geek on everyone.. If I were you I would go and stop my husband before he… he’s skulling the punch.” Pansy snorted.
“What can I offer you, wine? Beer? Gin tonic? Martini?“ Malfoy said, leaning on the back of the other chair. “figuring we might need some drinks to get this whole conversation going.” He tried a smile. Harry Smiled back. “I guess I’d like a Gin tonic. Half and half.” He hummed. Watching Draco. He hadn’t noticed last time since it had been up. But Draco’s hair was longer. Just over his shoulders and had a slight wave. He also hadn’t grown much. Harry was at least a head taller now which made him grin.
“What can I say. It turns out I am quite talented with handling fire. Too talented with calling for it.” Seamus smirked up. God he never really grew taller after 7th year. Dean however was a fucking tree and a half.
She said something in Norwegian. Which Helve translated for them. “She approves of you, she says your magic is strong and it is no surprise you and Draco are bound.”
He nodded along the conversation the whole ride there. Not really listening to what his friends were saying, they eventually understood and quit asking him things, letting him nap the remaining two hours.
Pansy making Ron wear hemione’s bra wasn’t too far off. By the time they were done Hermoine had lost abut they a decided the last of Draco’s strong liquor for everyone was fair enough. They talked for a bit more but one by 1am everyone left. Draco had fallen asleep about 20 minutes ago. Resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Not that anyone had really noticed. They were all pissed after all.
And so he did. Switching his coffee for a glass of a liquor the local old lady that acted as everyone’s grandma had made and gifted him for bringing her fresh eggs each week.
Once back home, he added a short “The raven nips.” At the bottom of his letter before tying it to the bird together with a mug, a quick makeshift portkey. “now do be quick Skadi, when you return ill have a proper home ready for you.” He smiled, before sending the bird off.
Harry took a step back. He hadn’t expected that. he opened his mouth, but there was nothing to say really. He had heard Ginny was friendly with some healer at work.. thought nothing of it. It wasn’t like Harry had given her what she needed. A loving caring husband. Yeah it was… it was probably for the best right? But damn. Damn did that hurt.. She should’ve told him at least.
“Have you figured something out Mormor?” Draco asked, he tried not to sound desperate but Harry felt he was. Did he really want to rid of him that bad?
He sighed softly. Time for a break from the busy hall as he strolled outside. Glad to feel unsupervised for a moment. There were some people outside but they were either smoking, or kissing each other’s faces off. The wonders of alcohol really. He leaned against one of the walls, his mind wandering. So Potter did consider him a friend huh? It.. honestly made him feel good. He smiled a little, fuck. It made him happy.
He was trotting along nicely on the path. It was a cold day, just warm enough to not have to wear a coat. But most definitely sweater weather. Everything was going great. Draco had even gotten the horse, named Loki for his antics, to walk with a nice curled, but relaxed neck. He pat is neck, letting the reigns go a little and going back to a walk, closing his eyes and taking in the sounds of the woods, the smell of autumn filling his lungs. Letting his mind wander, letting the horse take control of where to go.
But he did it. His line was interrupted by a little drunk hiccup in the middle but: “Have you been covered in bees recently? I just assumed, because ya look sweeter than honey.” Was definitely new and absolutely horrible.
“Dad you told me you simply used a time turner to turn back time at night to get more sleep and to get to classes you missed.” Scorpius teased.
Malfoy spotted the snitch first. Smirking at Potter as he dove for it. Making the other his as he went after him. The game under them seemingly being dropped as they dropped down, fast. Neither of them willing to turn away as the ground inched closer. The snitch only turned about 2 meters off of the grass. Both harry and Draco chasing it back up, zigzagging across the field. Seemingly attached at the hip. They reached out to the small golden ball, attempting to shove each other off of their broom before… back down again. They were too distracted with teasing the other as they dove.
“It’s nothing too Fancy, Most of the fish was gone at the market salmon was all that was left really.” Draco said, putting out a lovely smelling salmon fillet with a herb crust on top, on some mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. “I’ve taken the liberty of pouring you a white chardonnay with it. Makes it taste better.” Draco mused.
The old lady shook her head, but she gave Harry, who had a lot harder of a time hiding his emotions and was looking a bit upset, a smile. She most definitely knew.
“It’s absolutely ridiculous. You might’ve bought your way into the team but you didn’t lack the skill to back it up.” Seamus huffed, leaning against his husband.
For a friendly game. Things got quite intense. Seamus and Dean were just as fierce as Draco and Harry seemed to be.  Determined to win. No insults were thrown but a few nasty bludgers were hit towards the other team. Resulting in at least one fractured bone, quickly healed by Malfoy, as they played.
The next few moments seemed to happen in slow motion. Draco got up in the blink of an eye, seething with anger, ready to curse new guy. “Don’t you dare…”
He popped his wand up the sleeve if his white button up. An old trick he had learned from Pansy, one last look in the mirror and he was off to meet his friends. Chin up, chest forward he left the Inn. Walking through the, despite it being late, still lively streets of Diagonally until he reached the restaurant the had agreed to meet at. Spotting his friends, who apparently also liked to be 30 minutes early he couldn’t help but stop in his tracks for a moment. Staring at them. they were so happy, they were healthy, smiling, and there. He took a deep breath, a pleasant smile on his face as he walked up to them. “Pansy? Blaise?” he asked softly. Pansy immediately got up. “Draco oh my.. I barely recognize you!” she exclaimed, almost stumbling over her chair as she went to pull him into a tight hug. “it’s been so long” she uttered, only letting go after a little bit, quickly wiping her eyes. She had definitely become less of a bitch and more emotional.
“He has been, he’s told me he hasn’t been able to give his children what he wants to give them. what else.” He raised an eyebrow at her.
“Potter you were born dull. The people should understand that any snark you toss is the pure stupidity itself speaking.”
It seemed that after Voldemort had died.. or disintegrated into dust, Harry was in fact able to study fairly well when he could actually focus on the subjects offered. He had become quite the skilled wizard. He had changed a lot… and now. Now he was bored. He felt empty. Without a real goal. He’d never enjoyed the spotlight. He enjoyed helping others, surely. And thank Merlin there were still people on this earth that didn’t know about Potter the golden boy and saw him as just another curse lifter. Hoping he could help em out for a quick buck.
Not that Harry really minded. He was kind of glad his time seemed to be getting close sooner and sooner. He was very much done with it all. Someone walked in. He snorted. “Whatchu gonna do this time. I told you you’re not going to scare me. Just give up already.” He found taunting them daily was one of the only things he could do really. It gave him great joy up until the moment it didn’t and he’d get punished. “You know it’s weak. Hitting a man while he’s tied up. What kind of power kick does that give you? You haven’t beat me in a proper fight have you no…”.
“Potter?” Draco opened his eyes to find potters face really close to his. He swallowed hard. “Uh.. yeah. I don’t drink often.  I think I lost count at the 8th shot.”
She smiled softly. “well… Now I know we had the falling out Draco, and again my apologies over judging you back then. But I met the most lovely muggle when traveling in Egypt. He researches muggle artifacts there. We’re working together on it now. Apparently magic really explains a lot about their culture and… ah never mind. We’re getting married next year.” She sighed happily. “what about you. How have you been getting by?”
“I.. we have been looking for him too. Ginny  called a few days back sayin she and Harry got into a fight and left. We thought he was staying with you?” Ron said, mouth full of spaghetti.
It burned, badly. Like his throat had been set on fire, the remains of it dropping into his stomach, burning its way through there, he choked out as he dropped to his knees, wheezing for air, trying his best not to scream as he felt the bands tighten slightly  around his arms. Skadi hopped up to him concerned. He shook his head  to make her keep her distance, before his head started spinning and he blacked out. Vivid memories, colorful and too bright for Draco’s eyes, making him feel sick passing in front of his eyes. Too strong of a potion probably.
“Fair enough.. I just.. don’t know what to think of it. I don’t know how this will end for them and its honestly frightening.”
She came back just two days later. Carrying nothing but a small letter in the most horrific handwriting. It seemed so  zero effort it almost pissed Draco off.
Harry moaned and cursed under his breath. He shifted slightly so that Draco was pushing against his prostate on every forward thrust. He could feel his pleasure building, his toes curling against the floor. He barely gave a garbled warning before he came onto the wall in front of him. The rhythmic pulsing of the muscles around Draco’s member was enough to send him over the edge seconds later.
That inevitably started a lengthy argument about who was the best of the two seekers. Most had agreed that Harry was superior and that had left the blond boy practically seething and he’d agreed to
He’d felt it against his own but to have it in his palm was entirely different. He’d curiously moved his hand up and down the impressive length and Harry breath hitched, but he kept moving his own hand on Draco. He pulled them both under the hot stream of the shower.
He turned to Malfoy, who was brushing himself off where he stood in the corner of the small office, smiling ever so slightly and avoiding his gaze. He went to shove the boggart into a chest he’d conjured and turned back to speak.
It was in that moment that Harry Potter, Saviour of the wizarding world, realized that he could also be attracted to men. In a hallway, hidden beneath an invisibility cloak at six in the morning with what was now a raging hard-on pressing against his worst enemy’s. He would definitely not tell anyone about this.
Harry pushed back onto Draco’s finger relaxing as best he could to get used to the intrusion. He was left with no doubts about his sexuality. This.
When they arrived, Alyssa lead the professor to the back of the class, still pushing and shoving through the panic-struck crowd that was standing near the door of the potions office. Harry nodded at students, apologizing on behalf of  the young girl and reassuring everyone that it would be fine. His words sounded clear, calm, and true, but a great observer wouldn’t fail to notice the slight shake of his hand and the uneasy look in his green eyes.
”What’s this?” Draco asked, as Harry shut the door behind them. He looked at the all too romantic setting in front of him. A fireplace in the corner and a small table with plates and cutlery was in the center on a large soft-looking red carpet. A string quartet played through a speaker. Draco’s shoulders tensed, “I think the room messed up again.”
Tonight, it was to be a game of magical truth or dare. Two options were given to a student. The first a dare and the second a truth or vice versa depending on which was chosen first. If you refused to do the first, a force, not unlike veritaserum or an imperius curse did, forced you to do the second. There were two rules: nothing physically harmful and if you worded it wrong, too bad for you.
“Even your girlfriend knows I’m better than you.” It got a blush to creep up his pale skin which satisfied Harry immensely.
Word travelled fast in the wizarding world. It was a day after Harry had walked into the great hall with Draco’s hand clasped tightly in his when a fluffy black-banded owl landed in Draco’s plate. He’d been sitting in front of Neville, enjoying frustrating him as he refused to believe the source of the boy’s new love bites.
A crowd had formed around the scene where Hermione was now casting spell after spell to try to unstick the pair, but she was unsuccessful. Peeves had disappeared and teachers were running towards them. Professor Flitwick and McGonagall were asking them to stand and to make their way to the hospital wing. However, walking with another body connected to you from your hip to your knee was much much harder than it seemed. Giggles erupted through the crowd as the boys tried to shuffle their way across the pitch and when Harry tried to move his right leg at the same time as Draco moved his own, essentially kicking the blond and himself to the floor once more, the headmistress decided it would be much simpler to levitate the duo and send them off to the hospital wing herself.
”You clearly haven’t looked at a dictionary. Moronic and imbecile mean the same thing.” He flipped his ridiculously blond hair in a way no one could possibly take him seriously and marched away.
One in particular excelled at grumbling and raising defiant eyes to stare at the giant squid. Malfoy had, in fact, inadvertently started a feud between himself and the squid, dubbed Delores (it had been Seamus’ suggestion and after laughing for a while, no one had opted for a better name and thus! Delores lived on!), and though he refused to admit it, he was terrified of it.
Both boys looked around bewildered. Peeves cackled and twirled around the pair yelling, “Oh no! Oopsie! Potty is stuck to a ferret! Potty is stuck to a ferret!”
When he got back to the common room, most of the eighth years were lounged in the common room. The others had been washing up before their day at Hogsmead.
to lose. Seamus had taken the post of commentator and the bludgers had been expertly charmed by Hermione for the occasion.
“You keep hangover cure in the bathroom?” He downed it in one go as Harry did the same. He took the empty vial back and vanished it. Draco felt the hum of Harry’s magic surround him and his eyes widened at the sheer power he felt.
”I’ll give you a chance, Harry.” Draco finally said. He pulled back and smiled at Harry and walked back over to the table to sit. Harry joined him at the small table and they stated eating in silence. They spent most of the meal smiling but when Harry smiled or stared for too long, Malfoy kicked him under the table.
About thirty more awkward steps down the corridor, Harry shook as he gave the password and lead them to the secret staircase behind the portrait of the fat horse (what was with Hogwarts’ love for well fed beings anyway?) and the portrait closed behind them, but when they tried to go up the first step, Draco slipped. Harry reached for the railing to steady himself as the blond struggled for purchase, the tight squeeze of his hand on Harry’s elbow now moved lower to grab at his bum, essentially pulling their hips even closer together. Draco couldn’t prevent the moaned curse from escaping his lips and the green-eyed boy thought he’d never heard a sound as amazing as that. Harry’s head fell down onto the pale shoulder in front of him and through his lust-filled haze, he registered Draco pulling him closer and slowly rolling his hips against him.
“I didn’t know you could read, Potter.” Draco sneered as he came up behind him in the library one day. His blond hair was fluttering slightly in the breeze of the open window and glowing in the sunlight. He looked angelic.
”I didn’t do that!” He’d said as he looked at his hand. It wouldn’t budge when he’d tried to remove it. Harry had dragged Draco to Madam Pomfrey, kicking and screaming.
”You’ve never been a death-eater, Draco. That mark on your arm says nothing about your character.” He kissed him again and this time the lips beneath his kissed him back. It was better than anything they’d done beforehand. When Harry had kissed Cho, she was crying and it was wet and awkward, but now with Draco it wasn’t awkward. It was passionate.
”Shut it, Potter. Not a word of this to anyone or I’ll hex your precious bullocks off.” Harry didn’t argue. He lead them to the thankfully empty infirmary five minutes later and removed the invisibility cloak. Peeves was thankfully found and they were removed fourth five minutes later. Madam Pomfrey did not question them on the rather incriminating evidence of their sexual endeavour on Harry’s neck.
Luna still refused to say which Slytherin had slithered into her panties and she and Pansy was trying to extract the information from at one end of the tub. If there not-subtle drunken manner was anything to go by, Harry guessed that Blaise was the mystery Slytherin and that Luna and Pansy were now sharing their experiences with him to each other. They giggled sometimes and said
He moved his finger over the puckered hole a few times, relishing in the shudders and heavy breathing from his companion. He tried to slide his finger in, but Harry hissed in his ear. His green eyes shut in concentration for a moment before Draco felt magic surround his fingers. Harry nodded at him and he slid his finger once more and this time it was much easier.
Harry made his way back to his classroom as he thought over recent events once more. He’d only seen Draco crying like that three other times. The first time had been in sixth year, an event that hadn’t ended well. The second had been when Draco was inches away from death in the room of requirement. The third time was after Voldemort died. Draco had been found by Harry thanks to the Marauder’s map. Narcissa had been looking for him in the rubble and was starting to suspect the worst when Harry spotted his floating name up in the astronomy tower. He’d been crying for hours even after the news of Voldemort’s defeat. Harry had left before Draco had looked up from his knees to cry into his mother’s chest. This fourth time hadn’t been the same. They weren’t fighting on opposite sides of a war. This was more personal. The boggart has been his father. What had be been so afraid of? It wasn’t the presence of his father, Draco had never shown any fear at the mention of his name and Harry would know if he was afraid. It was something about what he’d said.
he said his name louder as if he was reciting a play he’d heard a thousand times, “not all of us can get away with being moronic imbeciles, living off a family fourtune.” He said, grinning. He had been waiting for the inevitable outburst from the blond individual and he knew that by showing him that he was indifferent to his insults, it would only frustrate him more.
There was still some hostility between the Slytherins who had returned and the others, but most had been forced by Hermione to acknowledge the fact that no one had had a choice in the war.
Malfoy. He thanked Alyssa for the help and announced that the situation had been taken care of. There was nothing to worry about.
Boggart-Lucius covered his practically uncovered goods and squeaked. His evil glare made him look like an angry puppy and Harry laughed. Partly because he was relieved that the situation had been taken care of and that nothing bad was going to happen in the castle. The fear that had taken refuge inside him when he’d heard of the intruder in the castle disappeared with every exhale. He laughed at the whole situation. To think he’d thought his colleague was up to something like he’d been in their youth. To think that as student he’d always thought wasn’t capable of causing harm to a single soul had escorted him like a badass bodyguard.
