"Oi! No conspiring teams yet, Weasley! We need a fair discussion with everyone present. Including impartial non players." Terry Boot said from across the table.
“Firebolts new line of
“I’m not the one who looks like they need a break, Potter.” He sneered. “Aunt Bella made sure to revisit
Once they all made it to the table everyone began talking at once.
“Have you seen my Potions book? It's only the first day back and I've already lost it.”
Everyone walked over to their partners and groups. Harry and Draco stood a few paces apart, just staring. Harry was struck at how beautiful Malfoy looked. They continued to stare at one another as the others moved about around them.
Once again they leaned in and Draco let his eyes slip closed.
Harry laughed loudly, already knowing what it was. A long, low cut, figure hugging black dress with billowing sleeves. Ron looked about ready to combust on the spot just thinking about it, Harry wasn’t sure how he was going to survive actually seeing her in it.
Blaise frowned and looked at Draco. The two seemed to have an entire conversation through a rapid exchange of looks, because Blaise stood up and sighed.
Harry scanned his excitedly.
Draco sat down at the table and watched as Harry prepared the tea.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah I know. Then he made fun of Malfoy for changing in the bathroom.”
Shaking his head, Draco poured some water into the potion, staring into it like it held an answer he had been longing for.
He flicked on the bathroom light and turned to look at himself in the mirror.
“Gregory's Unctuous Unction causes the taker to believe the giver is their best friend. Depending on how well it is brewed, the potion can last almost 48 hours.” Padma answered.
“You've got to be kidding me.” Harry mumbled. Ron burst into laughter and clutched his stomach.
Turning from the open door, she pointed sternly at him, "Talk to Potter. And do it soon, you know how these Pureblood weddings go."
Harry was brought out of his thoughts when Draco jostled him in his haste to lean forward, his hands flat against the table and hanging off his seat.
His favorite photo though, had been since the day he got it, was the one of all three of them. Harry being held by his mother as his father waved his little hand for the camera. All three had big smiles on their faces. When Harry was younger his parents had seemed so old. Looking at these photos now they seemed barely older than he was now.
Wolf whistles died down as Blaise moved out of the way and Draco stepped forward. For all the camp and overly sexual nature of Blaise's costume, Draco's costume was the complete opposite.
Malfoy stood in front of him, one eyebrow raised.
“So how was everyone's night?” Hermione asked as they walked to the Great Hall.
“Reckon you can go a class without him?” Dean asked, and Seamus feigned collapsing against Dean in sorrow.
“This is fine, I know what I’m doing.” he finished.
It was unseasonably cold for October. Harry wrapped his arms around himself, wishing to be wearing one of the Ghostbusters suits.
“I know many of you would not be able to reach your full potential if you sat next to certain
Harry looked to his own roommates then, to see they were already inside. He sighed but went into the room as well.
"Do Muggles always have these things hanging from the ceiling?"
“Wait, Charms is first?”
Blaise paid it no mind however.
“That’s rough. Are you going to go?”
"She did! That one Christmas, the Manor's grand room had that mistletoe hanging." Pansy reminded, also leaning forward.
“Delivery!”
Draco snorted at that. She did have an incredible perception on the oddest things.
Draco tore his gaze away from Harry when Ginny spoke. His face changed from the unknown expression into a scowl instantly.
They neared the grave, snow beginning to fall, and Harry felt his stomach fall at the sight. The tomb was covered in beautiful bouquets, letters, and small trinkets. Harry, their only son, had brought nothing.
He maneuvered his way around the tables to get to the counter at the front of the store. He always found himself staring around the new products and tchotchkes around the Kettle. The tables were piled high with carefully placed merchandise, one group of tables specifically for Draco and Blaises’ potions.
Harry gave him an easy smile. “Why not? It’ll be fun getting one over on all those stuffy Purebloods. And, you seem like you need the help.”
To Harry's surprise, the man started talking to Draco. Harry watched as they went through some type of introduction. He saw Malfoy hide a laugh behind his hand as the man grinned. The bartender approached, taking his order and then the other man's. Harry had a funny feeling in his stomach as he watched them.
Harry frowned at him. “So do I.”
“And you have all your books? Your robes?” Mrs. Weasley asked as they stood outside the train.
“So we have fourteen days to convince people we’re dating.” Harry said slowly.
for a week as a penalty!”
Once the Great Hall was mostly full, McGonagall walked up to speak.
A Stinging Hex had hit Blaise right on the corner of his mouth. Draco was standing in the doorway, eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched. He stared at Blaise as if he had just insulted Draco’s mother. Without sparing a glance at Harry, Draco turned away and slammed the door shut.
Potter hated press, Draco knew he was single, he fancied men as well as women, and the two were actually friends. Strangely.
“Besides,” Pansy cut in, “we're friends now, just like you said.”
The first thing Harry noticed was how dark it was.
Ginny whispered the password, much to the dismay of the Fat Lady as she had to stop singing to hear it. As she swung open, Harry saw the Common Room for the first time in so long.
Malfoy stood in front of a mirror, openly sobbing and cursing to himself.
“Night, Harry.” Draco said a few minutes after he entered.
“Care to let a few fellow classmates join you for a bit? You know, us Eighth Years have to stick together.”
"Halloween specials!" Hermione yelled over the music.
“Likewise, Harry.” and Neville gave the others hugs and greetings of their own.
“Terry, Anthony, Michael and I are going to Muggle London to celebrate Halloween this year, and we thought it would be great if we invited the rest of the Eighth Years to come too!” The two looked at Harry with matching grins.
The entire house itself was an open floor, no doors closing off any rooms on the first floor, an invitation to himself as well as any guests to feel at home. Only an archway separated the kitchen from the living room but even that had a large opening.
This time Harry
Even thinking about it now had Draco's dick twitch in his trousers.
“From the Addams Family. Really suave character, completely devoted to his wife.” Hermione explained and Theo looked at Daphne with love.
“The usual.” Harry replied with a shrug, causing both his friends to give him sympathetic looks.
“...Thomas, the incredibly good looking and strong Chaser for the black team swerves passed Nott.”
“Morning.” he returned her smile.
“Speaking of,” Harry interrupted, “How exactly did they know about the Cloak?”
Excited murmurs, even from people Harry knew were never good at Transfigurations, rang through the class.
Harry's prediction on how the costume would look was right but amplified ten fold in person. The delicate nature of the costume softened Draco's usual sharp exterior. The long dress and flowy cape were delicately draped over him. His arms, molded by years of Quidditch, looked more defined when draped in thin golden chains. The golden laurel crown placed upon his head appeared almost as a halo.
Draco sighed, “I know. I won’t. It’s been years anyway. I don’t...I’ll be fine.”
“Well I’d only just begun, hadn’t even gotten to the good parts yet.” Blaise turned his attention back to Harry before continuing. “One time, Pansy dared Malfoy to put on her school uniform. Now it’s really no different, but you should have
Why Malfoy always changed in the bathroom, why he was always massaging his left side. Why Blaise gave him so much crap for not changing in front of Harry, and why he had made it so obvious that Malfoy would only
Hermione sat down beside Daphne and Neville sat with Sue.
Once again, thank you so much to all the comments and love you guys have been giving this fic! It's been such a time writing this these past few years and seeing you guys enjoy it means the world to me.
Harry ripped his gaze from Malfoy’s and laughed along with his friends.
However, Draco felt as if he were on fire. His entire body was burning and the places where Harry's hands touched him were an inferno.
Mrs. Weasley's lips tightened but she agreed. “Five minutes. But I expect you to be at Madam Malkin's to get fitted for new robes right after, Ginny.”
Hermione nodded but Harry dug through his bag for his schedule anyway. With everything that had happened yesterday he hadn't even remembered to check it. Sure enough, Charms was first. Harry jumped up from the table.
“Mr. Zabini! Your Gregory's Unctuous Unction is one of the
"Absolutely not." Draco gave her a stern glare.
This time as he danced, Harry couldn't ignore the nugget of thought that had been on his mind all day. His parents were at the forefront of his mind now. He knew they would want him to be having fun but he couldn't help but think he was letting them down. His first year he could actually visit them on their anniversary without fear and he wasn't.
And lastly, Draco Malfoy. Malfoy was...Malfoy. That in itself was explanation enough.
"Maybe just one more time. Just in case."
“Sleep tight Harry, you’ll be looking at two winners tomorrow night.” Blaise said as they got into bed that night.
Padma groaned and Hermione let out a sigh.
"Well then it will have to be someone who would have to have logically agreed to a low profile relationship with you." Pansy said.
Harry had no idea what was in them but that didn't matter. He held onto the two he had carried over and placed one in front of Draco and kept the other for himself.There seemed to be a silent agreement amongst the group to have a drink or two first, then mingle with the Muggles.
Malfoy didn’t answer, just gave a curt nod before grabbing his own toothbrush and walking to the bathroom.
A little shameless self promo if you want to read a more in depth version of Harry and Draco talking about his sectumsempra scars and Draco's parents, my fic "For every question why, you were my Because" has all of that goodness. I just couldn't fit it in organically to this one since they've already been friends for a bit.
Now the fun begins!! As always, thanks for reading and please do leave a comment, they warm my heart like no other! Let me know what you think so far and what you think will happen next <3
Ginny smiled brightly, "Perfect, walk me to Gryffindor Tower?"
"Do you, er I mean, did you fancy him?" Harry asked, trying to school his features. All of a sudden he felt clammy.
Blaise let out a loud cheer and Seamus and Dean both whistled.
“Two weeks. It’s kind of an unspoken Pureblood rule that the less time you give in advance, and the more people who attend, the higher your status is.”
Another couple of minutes passed before he finally saw the Snitch. He dove once again.
Draco let out a small huff of laughter. The unspoken “and then there was a war going on” was an understood end of Harry’s sentence.
“I’m afraid I don’t have anything like that, Nott just keeps to himself when he’s in there. Not a bad bloke, just quiet. What about you, Harry?”
Again, Draco’s lip curled up slightly. “The great Harry Potter not succeeding at something? I'm shocked.”
Draco kept grinning."I'm taking the piss, Harry. He was chatting me up yeah and I'm assuming he was headed there but he hadn't outright said it."
A few minutes after Ginny and Blaise left Draco picked up the crate from earlier. The delivery to The Copper Kettle in hand, Draco opened the door and started walking. Entering the shop Draco called out,
want to be considered?" Blaise asked the group.
"What if I drop it and it blows away in the wind?" Draco asked with a huff. Harry laughed out loud at that, which made Draco bite down his own grin.
Harry didn't know how to react so he just kept walking. Blaise let out an exaggerated moan as Harry pulled open the door.
Harry opened his book and looked through the ingredients.
Draco started to pull back and for just a moment it seemed as if Harry followed him. He opened his eyes to Harry's face only inches from his own. Harry's eyes were dazed, his lips parted and red. Draco was sure he looked the same.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry didn’t go back to sleep.
“Piss off, Dean.” Harry said, a hint of a smile on his face.
“Probably teasing him about his baby dick.” Ron snickered. Hermione shook her head in annoyance but had a small smile on her face. Harry laughed along too but couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew why Malfoy always changed away from Harry, and it had nothing to do with him being ‘ungifted’ in that area.
Long after he crawled into bed that night, Harry’s mind was still racing as he thought about what had happened.
“Oh right.” He answered sheepishly.  A heavy silence filled the air as they both recalled the reasons Harry thought Malfoy wouldn't be able to play.
The other girls followed suit, some of them giggling the whole way down. The boys walked down too, opening the main door before heading to their rooms.
“Mr Finnigan! Do I have to issue a detention on the first night back?”
-=-=-=-
Draco and Harry flew above them all, stopping next to one another high above them all. They turned to look at one another with excited grins.
Even Harry seemed out of place here, shrugging off his coat and placing it on the empty coat rack. Draco followed suit, and now two sets of winter’s clothes sat by the door. Nothing more.
“Good to see you again, mate!” Harry said and he wrapped Neville up in a hug.
Pansy was reading the invitation from over his shoulder. There was a small frown across her face.
“Of course, Mr. Finnigan.”
Draco let out a strained sigh, "Do you always map out your kisses, Potter?"
“Hello, Harry.” Blaise drawled out with a charming smile.
The three fell silent as they all thought it over.
He made his way off the dance floor and back to their table. The effect of his drinks was finally catching up to him. He sank down onto the bench and sighed. Harry wasn't sure how long he sat there by himself. The songs faded into each other, the swirling lights dancing off the walls.
“Hannah, join us as Chaser.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks Gin.” Harry said.
“Susan, please follow us and be our Beater.”
“Firs’ years this way!” Hagrid’s voice boomed out.
House dictate how you see them.”
Millicent and Blaise recounted the hunt they had gone on to find a specific shade of green cloth that had somehow taken them throughout Hogsmeade.
“Oh really? They were probably lying.” Harry said, smile widening.
Much love to you all<3
Harry's eyes widened at Draco's bluntness.
"Obviously I have to go."
Draco gave him an incredulous look. "All the muggles know how to do it, we'll look like knobheads in front of them."
Pansy raised an eyebrow at him before saying, "Showing up with your lesbian best friend is not the way to go. You want to make a statement not be pitied."
“I'm changing.” Draco answered curtly, a warning look thrown at Blaise.
“Since this is your last year, and seeing as I would have been your teacher all seven years, I thought it would be only fitting to have me for one more class.” McGonagall said, rather matter of factly, but her eyes were shining.
“Good afternoon. Before we begin Mr. Potter, due to the nature of this lesson, you'll be paired with Mr. Malfoy for the time being.”
And maybe, on nights when Draco allowed himself the thought, perhaps the reason he was so cautious was out of fear of the unknown. About his own feelings...but those nights were few and far in between.
“I hope you don’t mind, I ordered us some food from Cara’s.” Harry said once Draco walked out.
"Mum had me in lessons when I was younger," Draco added, "nothing like this though. It was all classical Pureblood ballroom shite."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded, “Sure, I’ll meet you outside at six.”
why Malfoy changes in the bathroom. Have fun.”
The killing curse hadn't hurt, Crucio had been horribly painful, but this? This felt like someone had poured molten lava onto Harry’s shoulder, and they were letting it seep down and into his chest.
"This Friday, all classes will be canceled. Instead, we will be hosting a school wide House Unity Quidditch match!"
“Hey, Harry!” Ginny called from the front of the store.
“First years, I welcome you wholeheartedly to our family. This year, you will be the first generation of Hogwarts students to start our Inter House Unity project.”
He had it under control.
Malfoy must have made up his mind, because he looked around the aisle quickly to make sure they were alone before saying softly,“I never got the chance to-”
Harry nodded. “So let’s start at the beginning. When did we get together?”
Harry thought for a moment. Three people had tried out specifically for Seeker. Two Fifth Year boys, Shamar Ownes and Noah Blanche. They had done well but had also done well when Ginny set them up as Chasers. The other was a Third Year girl, Evangeline Miller. She was a small thing, her broom almost seemed taller than her. Her wildly curly hair was pulled back in a tight bun but had managed to come loose by the end. Her skills however were intense. She flew around the Pitch with such agility yet never seemed unaware of the game below her. She had sharp eyes and managed to catch the snitch each time she was Seeker.
Millicent spoke first, “If we were going to try and hurt you, do you really think we would be here right now?”
McGonagall began teaching, and Harry made himself focus solely on the lesson for the rest of the class.
"Fuck the contest." Draco answered with a wave of his hand. "Do you want to get out of here?" he asked again.
And as much as he hated to admit it, Pansy had a point.
"You do realize you need to actually move your lips to kiss, don't you Malfoy?"
Draco was deflecting again. Harry’s face was slowly turning to dawning realization.
The Slytherins seemed to have no problem settling in, but the Gryffindors had still yet to say anything. They sat gaping at the Slytherins with questions zooming through their minds. Blaise looked around the cart grinning at everyone, Theo seemed as indifferent as ever, though he did glance at Daphne as she sat, and Malfoy was staring firmly out the window, one hand massaging his left shoulder.
The four Eighth Years sat down to get comfortable for the journey. It felt like First Year all over again. For the first time in what seemed like his entire life, Harry was free of the looming threat of his death hanging over his head. But he still felt the odd rush of nerves that accompanied him all those years ago on his first trip to Hogwarts.
Pansy grinned and motioned at Harry to lead the way.
Parvarti went next, drawing Leia. “Don’t worry, I won’t steal your girl.” she said to Padma with a wink.
They only had a little over an hour to shop, seeing as they had spent half the period getting there. They had lunch next, so they could spend a few extra minutes shopping but they all wanted to get back in time to eat. Especially Harry. Apparently eating a single roll for breakfast hadn't been his smartest idea. The candy that surrounded them was looking incredibly appetizing right now.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the road, no real intention to where they were going. They popped in to see George and he brought them to the back to show off a new type of popping ears candy. They spent the rest of the afternoon doing some miscellaneous shopping, going to the bookstore for more parchment and poking around in
“You sure?”
Ron finally spoke up then, “How do we know you're not lying to us?”
Theo and Millicent were both already working on homework with Michael and Anthony across the room in one of the large couches.
And it was true. The first few days after they split were a little awkward but that didn't last long. They were back to their regular friendship quickly. Besides, the only difference between them dating and just being friends, as Ginny had put it, was “A little less snogging.”
“Greek Goddess.”
“Please Mum, we won't be long.”
And again the table erupted into quick laughter. This time however Harry didn't react.
Draco nodded and the pair left the dance floor together, hands clasped as to not be separated by the dancing bodies around them.
Harry turned towards Malfoy nervously. He didn't know what to expect exactly.
Harry wasn't sure if he should mention what had happened during the night. But then again, maybe Hermione and Ron could help him.
“Well not exactly. Blaise said he changed in the Slytherin dorm all the time.”
Hello again! I hope you all liked this chapter, it was such a fun one to write!
And with that Draco complied. He took Harry's outstretched hand to rise from the booth and the two walked to their friends on the dancefloor.
He started jogging before breaking out into a run in the hallway.
Harry ignored the comment since Malfoy would soon be trying to look into his mind.
Blaise winked at him in  response. Blaise was also dressed in his uniform. It had the same multicolored border but instead of being white it was black. He turned around for Harry, pointing at the jewel green “Zabini” stitched into the back. The number eighteen just below it.
“-even if you get a dress. Sound fair?” Hermione finished.
“She is well aware. It’s not like they were even together at the point. But anyway, this is not what this conversation is about Potter. Can we get back on track?”
Malfoy must have sensed Harry’s stare, because he turned toward him and gave a quizzical look. Harry shrugged but looked away quickly.
Daphne walked up next and pulled out a name. She read it and frowned. “I'm going as a flower?”
“Good morning all, I hope the first day of classes has treated you all well. Remember, do not hesitate to ask questions, we are all here to guide you through.” McGonagall looked around before continuing.
"Ready?" Harry asked.
Thankfully, his Charms book was sitting there under yet another Chudley Cannons shirt.
“Harry Potter...is dead.”
Draco Malfoy was crying.
The rest of names were called in a similar fashion, with both boys saying the names over the top.
As he quickly walked from the table he heard Ron quietly ask "Do you think he slept at all last night?"
It seemed everyone had the same idea, since they were all lounging around the Common Room when the three of them got there. Harry took a seat on one of the big chairs while Ron and Hermione sat on the loveseat together. Seeing them cuddled up made Harry smile, he couldn’t think of better people the two of them could have ended up with.
“I highly doubt we have time-” Mrs. Weasley began but Ginny cut her off.
"Signing up for the costume contest?" asked the man sitting at the table. He was wearing green face paint and bolts glued to his neck. Harry recognized him as Frankenstein's monster, though he wondered what Draco thought he was.
Blaise looked like a kid on Christmas. “How fun will it be for you to play pretend with Potter? Do you think you’ll get to kiss him? Maybe even talk about your own dream wedding?”
Harry couldn't stand any longer and he collapsed onto the ground in pain. He heard Snape walk in but the pain kept him from opening his eyes.
McGonagall waited for a moment and then continued, “On these days, House tables in the Great Hall are encouraged to be split. No assigned seating. Furthermore, wearing the colors of another House is also encouraged. However, don’t think we won’t take away points from the correct House for any misbehavior.”
They had just gotten back from dinner and were sitting in a corner of the Common Room, away from the others.
Ron sat next to Daphne and Hermione sat on his other side next to Millicent.
“I can't believe this,” Ron said through his laughter, “you and Malfoy are paired up in
Draco jumped slightly, he had forgotten he wasn't alone.
Harry looked at him with confusion, "The contest hasn't-"
Thank you for reading!! As always, leave a comment letting me know your thoughts and what you think will happen next!
“Yes well, I wanted something the complete opposite of the Manor. And this place is just that.” Draco said, looking at his home with fresh eyes.
Outside his door, Harry heard voices coming from inside. They must have been whispering since Harry couldn't make out any words. He didn't want to be accused of eavesdropping on his roommates so he opened the door.
"Alright that'll be five quid." the man said.
“I don't think Malfoy would be able to concentrate even if Potter stayed silent.” Blaise mumbled, only loud enough for Harry and Draco to hear.
Draco rubbed a hand down his face. "Don't you have a date tonight?"
Their interaction put even more energy in the group. As they walked Harry felt himself drifting closer to Malfoy until they were walking shoulder to shoulder. Malfoy made no mention of it and neither did he.
Harry had looked at each photo so many times he had them memorized. James lifting Lily up in a twirl and spinning her around. The two standing outside their house on Godric's Hollow with their hands placed gently on Lily's pregnant belly. His parents on their wedding day, standing with Sirius, Remus, and Peter. Harry had wanted to rip him out one day in Fourth Year but forced himself not too.
Slowly, heads began to nod and understanding rippled through the students.
“Malfoy!” Harry heard himself yell. “I know what you did.”
If someone had told Harry he would have spent half his afternoon with Pansy Parkisnon and Millicent Bulstrode and actually
, but Harry couldn't quite place it.
Harry’s smile returned slightly. “Like I said, I’m happy to help. Want to meet up after work and figure out a plan?”
“Not that I’m not grateful for the help. I just wouldn’t want to force you to do something you probably would rather not.” Draco clarified.
“Not tonight.” he answered finally. It felt odd to go in there now without Ron and Hermione. He would go back, definitely, but not without them.
Preparations for Halloween were well underway. Hermione had made multiple trips with Harry, Justin, Anthony, and Millicent to costume shops. They refused to let anyone who hadn't been outside the Wizarding World before to come as they wanted Halloween to be their first experience.
in their lives”. That had made Draco scoff and down one of the shots that had been brought to the table.
Hermione and Ron said goodnight and Harry made his way downstairs.
Harry's heart clenched at the thought. He knew one day he would be older than they had been when they died, he just didn't realize it would be so soon. It felt wrong to grow older when they couldn't and yet there was nothing Harry could do.
“She's got a point.” Anthony said.
And then later, as they all fought, the barely there struggle Draco gave in keeping the wands from Harry. And the split second look they shared, too many things written across both their faces, before Harry and the others had escaped.
“Noted. Now does anyone have any objections to Draco and Harry being the two team captains? They’ve had the longest Quidditch run out of all of us here.”
Harry rolled his eyes, all the Weasley's had been saying the same thing all summer after he and Ginny had broken up.
An idea sprung in Harry's mind. "Should we dance to this? Since neither of us know how we can't be wrong."
After the teams cleaned up and showered they all walked back out. The other Eighth Years were on the Pitch waiting for them. If Harry and his team gloated just a little too much that night, no one paid them any mind. And if Harry continued to drift over to Malfoy during their celebration, no one paid that any mind either.
“See you in a bit, mate.” Ron said as he and Neville walked into their room. Theo whispered something to Blaise, who grinned, before slipping in beside them.
"That bloke with the purple hair was making eyes at you, Millie!"
“We’ve already started a list of potential costumes. All muggle culture obviously, we want everyone to do something different. It’ll all be group based though so no one feels uncomfortable.” Hermione showed Harry the list and he smiled at the first few he read.
Harry’s throat felt tight and he took the flowers wordlessly. He walked the last few steps alone, Malfoy hanging back. Harry felt tears forming and he wiped his eyes slowly. He placed the bouquet down carefully and sank to his knees in front of his parents' grave.
When they pulled up at the station, Harry told Neville, Ginny, and Luna to go without them, as he, Ron, and Hermione wanted to see Hagrid first.
Harry seemed unconvinced and Draco hated him, just for a moment, for it.
"Ok we have exactly two minutes before the portkey is set to go. Make sure you have a hold on it." Justin said. Everyone moved around to grab onto a piece of the, quite fitting for the occasion, fake pumpkin.
“Race you to Quality Quidditch Supplies?” Ginny said, already in position to sprint down the road.
Draco gave him an irritated look. "I can do simple maths. Now that I know what a bloody quid is." he grumbled as he walked up to the bar, dress trailing slightly behind him.
"Not at all, just finished."
“Mr. Thomas and Mr. Weasley, beside them.” McGonagall read and Harry stilled.
Harry took in the sight of the Great Hall and smiled. He hadn't realised just how much he missed everything about Hogwarts, down to even the benches they sat on.
Harry began keeping an eye out for the Snitch while also basking in the energy of playing Quidditch again. The stands were a blur of colors as everyone was mixed together. Seamus’ voice rang out as he described the match to everyone.
For the first time since that night, Harry wondered if he had left a scar.
Sue lent down and high fived the girl dressed as Buttercup.
Despite once again wanting to fall asleep quickly, Harry couldn't. He listened to Blaise’s peaceful snores but kept an ear out for Malfoy. What was Harry supposed to do if he started crying again?
With a shrug, Theo answered, “Why not? We’re here, we’re alive, we’re with friends.”
Pansy looked over to the mostly decorative clock hanging on Draco's wall. "I've got to go. This isn't over!" She dragged Draco into a quick hug.
Harry felt both surprise and...a pit in his stomach over the confession. Theodore Nott flashed into his brain instantly. He was unquestionably handsome. Quite slender, face pointed but not as severe as Draco's, quiet yet held an air of authority and respect around himself. Harry would have assumed Blaise before Theodore if he was being honest. Something about it being the unassuming boy made his heart twist.
Blaise nodded, “
"Oh fuck all, I can't go
More applause rang out and someone who sounded suspiciously like Seamus yelled gleefully, “Bring out the fucking pudding!”
Harry winced and glanced at Hermione, who was still reading her copy.
Harry grabbed a roll and ripped a piece off and chewed it slowly. He thought over if he should tell his friends about Malfoy crying again until he heard Hermione calling his name.
Draco smiled sadly at him and shook his head. "Harry…"
Harry stared in shock, as did his friends. Did the Slytherins just apologize? To
Harry shook his head again, already standing. "They're all dancing differently, what's two more?"
“You know, Harry,” Blaise began again, louder and airier than before, “Draco had no problem changing in front of the Slytherins. Although,” Blaise turned to Draco with a wicked smile on his lips, “there was a time during Sixth Year where Draco refused to take his shirt off i-
“Scared, Potter?”
Harry wasn't sure if he should say something to Malfoy. It was odd that they kept getting paired up, wasn't it? Or was Harry making something out of nothing? It was only two class after all. And a whole dorm room, but still.
The group followed behind. Everyone was looking about in excitement despite the park being just a regular park. As they got closer to the road people began popping up.
Harry couldn't help his face heating up. "We never had like, full on sex, but did a lot of the lead up? It's kind of awkward going down on your girlfriend when her mum, dad, and six brothers are in the next room."
Draco nodded. A pause, and then he grinned, “So who are you telling first?”
Harry did in fact. Hermione getting her hair done by the same girls who ridiculed her for it almost daily, all while planning a party with them. It was all so absurd the three broke into a fit of laughter as they walked.
like Luna requested, and a sample of a new aroma enhancer I've been working on." Draco said as he placed the box onto the counter.
Blaise either didn't notice or didn't care. “Leaving just to change? Why not disrobe in front of us, I'm sure Potter wouldn't mind.”
-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-
As the song faded into the next Harry leaned over to Draco so he could be heard. "Another drink?"
Everyone began sharing what they had gotten up to for the day.
Draco let out a small sound of approval as his dish was opened. A plate of roast chicken and vegetables, one of his favorite meals from Cara’s. He didn’t even have to look up to know what Harry had gotten. A chicken, rice, and bean wrap, hold the tomato.
“Leaving so soon, Draco?” Blaise asked a few minutes later.
Draco scoffed at him but answered, “You haven't heard? Auntie Bella taught me to keep all our family secrets tight lipped.”
“Harry? I asked if you wanted to go to Charms?”
Through his cheers, Harry locked eyes with Malfoy. He smiled and held up the Snitch with a nod.
Harry just nodded dumbly before Malfoy muttered, “She was wearing a bra.”
Despite it being a truly awful night, Harry realized it was also the first night in a long time that he hadn’t had a nightmare. Though listening to Malfoy was probably torture enough, Harry reasoned.
"Yep, eight o'clock sharp."
Draco groaned again.
“You can't! Don't leave Ron, please! Don't leave us! Don't leave me.” Hermione pleaded, tears in her eyes. Ron stared at her and then walked out of the tent. Hermione sank to her knees, Harry immediately enveloping her into a hug as she sobbed.
knew it was what he needed. As much as Ron and Hermione tried to do for him just the little act of continuing normalcy was perfect.
Harry scanned the rest of the directions before adding his water and turning on his burner. He adjusted the flame before going over to the ingredient table. He took the necessary supplies and then walked over to Ron’s table.
Later on that evening, Draco watched as Harry began locking up The Copper Kettle. He called out to Blaise, saying his goodbyes for the night, and gathered his things.
“A party?” Hermione gave a little huff. “Are we invited?”
Oh...oh god.
“What was that about?” Ron asked as he slipped his arm around Hermione.
“That's pretty intense Harry.” Hermione said after Harry finished relaying Malfoy’s Battle of Hogwarts memory.
Draco groaned, “Of course I thought it out. And he made the most sense. Besides, I already asked him and we’ve already planned it all out.”
“That’s only four months. Maybe May? That’s at least six months. And I’m confident in our ability to have kept quiet during that whole time. Not to mention, it’s not like we weren’t seen around each other the whole time.”

Potter was always running straight to danger. All those Quidditch injuries could have easily been avoided by an actual competent Seeker. Not that you're any better on the ground.”
Harry grinned at her and laughed too. "I'd love too, Gin. This Saturday?"
“Yes, Ms. Patil?”
Just want to say a quick thank you to everyone who has commented and left kudos! It's so lovely to see people enjoying this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.
“Ronald! Harry! Perfect timing!” Blaise called out happily.
He heard the bathroom door open as he began shampooing his hair. His heart rate picked up just the slightest bit and he cursed under his breath.
“Here we are. The password to enter is “family”.”
"My very first Muggles!" Daphne said with a laugh.
“Well you’ll be hard pressed finding better Beaters than Coote and Peakes, and Robins was as good as ever.”
“Well, you’ll have to sleep on the right from now on.” Draco said, matter of factly.
Much love to you all
The title of this chapter is from the song Animal by Troye Sivan! I desperately wanted to use a line from this song for the title of the entire fic but they didn't fit the vibe . But it is the perfect title for our epilogue here!
Little sidenote, I know some of the costumes they're wearing don't actually exist yet when Harry Potter is set in but they were too fun to pass up! This chapter is one of my favorites of the whole story, it has so many awesome moments!! There should be around 4 chapters left! I'm finishing up the final edits and rewrites, can't wait to let you all read it!
We did it!! I just want to thank everyone who has supported this fic, it's been so fun seeing your reactions to it <3
Halloween night the Eighth Year dormitory was a flurry of people getting dressed. Stations were set up to do makeup and costume alterations. All done without magic to keep with the spirit of the night.
Draco shrugged his shoulders, grin still on his face, "Not my type."
Harry cursed silently to himself as Draco Malfoy’s voice rang out from the ear.
Ron grinned and said, “Aside from you and Malfoy being paired up every class? No, not really.”
"They obviously use coins, why not get rid of the paper altogether?" Blaise said.
Ron mumbled, “Yeah, he's got a small dick.”
Harry shook his head with a smile. The image of little Ron and Malfoy fighting flashed in his mind.
Harry's face colored in embarrassment.
plan for this potion.”
Draco’s eyes locked onto his dark mark, still so prominent after all these years on his pale skin. Only now it was placed in between two other tattoos, the ancient runes carefully traced across his skin.
Draco followed suit and a second later they were standing in front of one another beside the table.
Pansy nodded once more.
"I honestly don't know what to do now." Harry said with a smile and shake of his head.
“Pretty sick, right?” Blaise said, striding over to Harry to look into the mirror as well.
When all four stayed quiet Seamus just gave them a toothy grin. “I’m just taking the piss, course you are.”
With that, McGonagall walked to the front of the room, ready to start her lesson.
Draco just continued to stare at him.
“No!” Harry yelled a little too loudly. Draco was standing too, looking nervous. Harry let out a breath and paused his slightly frantic motions.
“Potter. She won't let
And...if he ignored how fast his heart was beating then he wasn't actually nervous, right?
The trio walked into the Great Hall, stopping to say hello to Ginny and Luna who were sitting at the Ravenclaw table together.
Draco was staring at the invitation in his hand with a scowl.
“Did anything else happen?” Hermione asked.
Harry rolled his eyes but got into bed anyway, closing his curtains slightly and placing his glasses on his nightstand.
“Yeah, I guess I will. See you in the morning.” Harry said, yawning again.
Harry thought for a moment. “Well, twice now Malfoy has thrown a Stinging Hex at Blaise.”
were tacky." Pansy said, raising her own glass in affirmation and taking a sip.
“Ron!” Hermione scolded but she was forcing back a smile.
Pansy’s voice whined as she gestured with a pout.
But there was no fighting. Harry took a moment to take in the scene before him. He saw himself, lying still in Hagrid's arms, surrounded by giddy Death Eaters. On the other side of the courtyard stood all his friends, his
“Well then, obviously we have to win."
The three boys all said their goodnights and crawled into bed. Harry listened to the sounds of his roommates breathing as he tried to fall asleep. For some reason unknown to Harry, and a part of him wasn’t sure he wanted to know, his mind kept drifting back to the idea of Draco doing a strip tease.
Blaise stood up slowly but kept his cheer as Harry walked to his bed.
“Ron, did you notice something...off this morning?” Harry asked.
Let me know what you thought and what you think is going to happen next!
Harry watched Draco's face scrunch into confusion. He stared at the coins and notes in his hand before turning to Harry subtly.
Primrose- I can't live without you
Neville had just finished getting his makeup done. The messy yet unmistakable face of the Joker expertly applied by Michael. The purple suit was expertly rumpled by Pansy. His hair had been sprayed with a green dye to finish off.
“We also want to welcome our new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Dreada, and our new Transfigurations professor, Professor Niehaus.” Applause rang through again.
“I've got to get my book. Go without me, I'll be right back.”
”, “it’s fate, I’m telling you babe, it’s fate.”
“Potter, Malfoy!” Flitwick said in surprise. Harry and Malfoy stood in the doorway panting, hands still clasped together.
“Alright, we need to come up with a timeline. Everything about this has to be carefully planned out and decided before we go to the wedding.” Draco started.
A quick tap on his shoulder had Harry looking forward, and McGonagall’s own frown met him.
Speaking of Malfoy, Harry still hadn't spotted him. But he could
“Blaise fucked a pillow.”
“Can’t wait.”
“Really Draco, it has nothing to do with what we were talking about.” Harry found he couldn’t even say the words.
“Oh, well, we've got to go. Ron said you two would go to Flourish and Blott’s with Dad while I get my robes. Hermione should be there by now too.”
Just as Blaise finished speaking, Malfoy came into the room.
Harry couldn't fight the grin as he pulled a five out of Draco's hand and placed it in the other man's outstretched one.
“We all just wanted to stop in and say hello! We won't be long, so don't worry about entertaining Pansy, she'll be fine as soon as she gets something in her mouth.” Blaise said with a snicker, causing Pansy to punch him straight in the crotch.
Blaise was quite civil to Harry as well, aside from sarcastic comments thrown his way. Though to be fair, no one was safe from Blaise's cheek.
year.
“I leave for a half hour and I miss all this?” Ginny said exasperated.
"Regular House teams have already been sorted and so this match will not be played by individual members of each team. Instead, our Eighth Years will be competing!"
“No.” Draco answered, a half truth. Of course he was nervous. This could all blow up in both their faces, how would they return from that?
“Shit, Potter!” Malfoy yelled once he saw Harry.
Draco was impressed. That sounded logical, though they would have to be much more detailed than that. But it was a good start.
Once they sat down Harry unpacked the food he had been carrying. He placed a container in front of Draco. With a wave of his hand, the containers all opened.
“There will be music, dancing, games-!”
-=-=-=-
“We do.” Harry said firmly. He looked at Malfoy, who was staring at him like the others, but there was something else behind it. Before Harry could try to decipher it, Luna’s voice called out,
thought they sounded fun! Imagine that!”
Harry scoffed in response. “Only in your dreams, Blaise.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry still couldn't believe it himself. The thrill of flying on the Pitch had only finally settled in his body and now he could go again? He had resigned himself already to having infrequent visits down there to fly with Ron and Dean but not play a real match. His blood was already bubbling in anticipation.
Harry was about to share his thoughts with Ron but McGonagall stood and began walking towards the podium. The lively chatter of the Great Hall quieted down and McGonagall smiled.
And with that he stood up with a smile to the group and excused himself, disappearing to the bathroom.
Harry wasn’t sure what had just happened, but he did know he was even more clueless about what that meant for Friday’s party.
Harry nodded. He remembered Sixth Year when Malfoy would feign illness to get out of matches and then ultimately stopped being part of the team.
Harry looked around to survey the damage, and saw Malfoy’s shocked face staring at him.
"It's so loud in here!"
First, there was Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass who Harry honestly had no problems with. They kept to themselves and their friends and never outwardly did anything to Harry and his.
(See the end of the chapter for
The group laughed and since no one objected to that either, Ron and Blaise were chosen as Keeper and Chaser respectively. A quick coin flip had Draco choosing first.
As always, let me know your thoughts! The next chapter is the last one but thank you again for those of you who have supported this fic!!
And as a parting gift since we all know I love my flower meanings:

“Doesn't matter. They would have found out eventually, they're Slytherins after all.” Harry said causing Ron to snort out a laugh and Hermione to return to her normal color.
The uniform was white with the hems and seams sewed with the colors of each House. The not quite rainbow created a beautiful border around the entire top and bottom. “Potter” was printed on the back of the jersey in large maroon letters, a number seven stitched just below that in the same colorful thread.
Godric’s Hollow. Harry looked at Draco, who was looking at him the same as before.
And not just any Slytherins, but this group? Harry glanced about the carriage and assessed.
Malfoy and Blaise were sitting on Malfoy’s bed, hunched close together but they flew apart as Harry walked in.
By the end, everyone was in stitches laughing at one another. It was a bit odd, having Malfoy joke around in front of everyone. Perhaps Gregory’s Unctuous Unction had left Malfoy feeling more open. Regardless of what it was, Harry wasn’t complaining.
, but all around him was black.
Once they began, Harry took off to the skies. He had missed the feeling of flying and being up this high. Harry stayed above the players, getting a birds eye view of how they flew, interacted with one another, and overall placement on the Pitch. He and Ginny rotated spots multiple times throughout the four hour tryout. Harry called out a few helpful hints and tips but overall let Ginny take the lead.
“What's the matter Draco? Still can't change in front of us? You know Harry, I think Draco might be emba-ow!”
Draco’s legs in that skirt! And that
“Millicent, only you can join our ranks and be a Beater.”
-=-=-=-
As Harry was getting ready for bed that night, he decided to be the one to start the conversation this time. It was always Blaise, and that always seemed to get derailed quickly. Malfoy had left a few minutes ago to wash up and change, so he wouldn’t be here to hex anybody.
Malfoy was holding a Chudley Cannons shirt, and
Draco felt his face get hotter, because why would he react normally in front of Potter right now?
Harry walked to the front, having hopelessly searched the back for his name first.
They pulled apart briefly before both closed the gap again. Draco let his hands drift into Harry's hair, tangling into the curls. The kiss was slow, neither making any real moves, just holding onto one another.
“Purebloods are sneaky, they want to know the in’s and out’s of all new gossip they can find, and they will be looking for any slip up.”
Draco nodded, “Right, then Blaise and I opened our shop the following January, and Luna opened her shop that summer.”
“Er...Malfoy if you want to take a break we can.”
“This sounds like loads of fun. I’m sure everyone will want to go.” Harry said and the pair in front of him smiled warmly.
“Well, Nolan and I broke up two years ago around this time. I know he knows I was single for at least a few months after that.”
Harry sat down on his bed and looked through his bag, making sure he had everything ready for class tomorrow, not wanting a repeat of today. Malfoy was sitting on his bed, across from Harry, subconsciously rubbing his left shoulder.
The Ghostbusters were running around the Common Room with their handmade equipment screaming about ghosts being in the room. It was hectic and it was loud but no one cared because it was so fun.
"Will you go with me?" he asked Pansy, voice pleading.
He'd forgotten his book.
It was more than Harry expected. All the students from his year were offered apprenticeships from the Ministry, as well as in various Wizarding establishments around the world. Harry knew already that Lisa Turpin and Fay Dunbar were currently training in Romania under Charlie Weasley.
-=-=-=-
That Saturday was the first Hogsmeade trip, and the Eighth Years all traveled down together before splitting up in groups to do their own shopping.
“Night Gin.”
Then there was Millicent Bulstrode. Her and Hermione had gotten into more than one altercation throughout the years. She was also a constant in the heckling and taunts thrown out by her best friend, Pansy.
“Oh, well, you know.” Luna said, with such an air of simplicity that no one pressed the subject further.
As he said that, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, and Draco Malfoy piled into their carriage.
“Oh please! You call
Malfoy turned around to face both of them and countered, “That same night Theodore Nott gave Blaise a lap dance so erotic Blaise came in his pants.”
"I'm quite alright, Potter." Draco took a deep breath and looked at the various trinkets across the counter.
“At least I didn’t come during my friends lap dance.” Draco said.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment and then nodded. He glanced down Harry's hand, still wrapped tightly around his wrist. Harry dropped it quickly and Malfoy walked away just as Ginny walked over.
Confusion and excitement buzzed around the Hall, even the Eighth Years started whispering.
A staircase across from the front door led upstairs to his bedroom, the bathroom and a small guest room. The house was small, much smaller than the Manor, and yet Draco wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Well,” Harry said finally, “I guess we know quite a bit more than we thought.”
Daphne seemed pleased with the explanation and moved aside so Theo could draw a name.
Harry let out a sigh of relief. “I have a free period.”
Harry was sure he had never heard Theo speak so much. It was almost infuriating, he thought to himself as he laughed along to the story Daphne was recalling, how charming each of the Slytherins seemed to be. It really wasn’t fair but moreover it made Harry’s stomach twist at the thought that had things been different, they would have been friends long ago.
Where, obviously, another Slytherin awaited him.
Harry’s next class was Herbology, and based on track record, Harry assumed Malfoy wouldn’t be joining them. Besides, he knew Hermione had Ancient Ruins this class and Malfoy had taken it since Third Year.
Ah ok  we made it guys!! They are together!!!!! AHH
Other nights he imagined finding the Mirror of Erised and seeing them stand behind him once more. The phantom weight of a hand on his shoulder and his parents smiled down on him.
“Just the lads.” Blaise said as he slung an arm around them both. Draco rolled his eyes and shrugged the arm off. A small residual hint of animosity from the potion. Blaise mostly took it in stride, giving Draco a small frown but saying nothing.
And here he was now, actively going against those precautions. And he was already slipping up.
Harry and his friends all looked at each other in disdain. They were hoping this wouldn't happen, at least not yet.
Hermione shook her head, “No ‘Blossom’ is from a cartoon. Her and her sisters Buttercup and Bubbles have special powers to fight crime.”
Hermione nodded slowly but looked skeptical so Blaise carried on.
Draco pointedly looked down at his hands.
"I'll let you know as soon as the next shipment comes in." Harry said as he handed the now wrapped box to the gentleman.
Harry didn't have time to think of why, as he was mentally guessing who he'd spend the next year paired with. Obviously not Ron, he thought glumly. Either Padma, Dean, or maybe Pansy. The thought made him scrunch up his nose. Hopefully it wouldn't be her.
“You’d think after seven years here he would have learned a new hex.”
When they reached their dorm Harry finally spoke.
After another half hour of listening to Blaise’s quiet breathes, Harry started to doze off. Just as he was about to fall asleep a small noise across the room jolted him back into consciousness. Harry’s eyes flew open, and the grip on his wand tightened involuntarily.
“Coming in?” Ginny asked after a moment.
It happened again, but this time it sounded more like someone choking back a sob. Harry peered through his curtains, but it was too dark in the room despite the curtains being translucent.
"That day in the Manor. You didn't tell him. You said you didn't know but you did. I know you did."
Ginny let out a low laugh. “As if you haven’t heard. I told them if they even consider selling to Simon Winston I’m off the team. Fucking sleazebag.”
Draco ignored the pit in his stomach at the thought. Despite having been broken up, they hooked up numerous times after the fact. All before Nolan met Allen, Draco Malfoy was not a homewrecker.
After everyone had their fill of looking around, they walked over to the stairs.
Harry had shut his eyes tightly when Malfoy got up, not wanting to chance Malfoy realizing he was awake.
Ron and Harry gave Hermione small smiles as she split from them.
He walked down a random aisle to try and compose himself. Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath in and a slow breath out. The memory of Malfoy clutching Harry’s sides filled his brain as the smoke seemed to engulf him once again. He could feel the fire licking at his face as they frantically flew forward. As bad as that was, the worst part of that memory was Malfoy’s terrified whisper as the fire came closer.
Draco stared at it for a moment before saying quietly, “You know how I like my tea?”
“That’s where my issue comes in.” another deep breath, and he carried on. “I’m man enough to admit that I don’t want to show up to my ex-boyfriend’s wedding alone. I’m also not dumb enough to ask any random bloke off the street.”
Harry woke up the next morning feeling dead. He didn’t even remember falling asleep, but he knew it couldn't have been very long. He had watched the sun come up, and Malfoy had gotten up then too.
McGonagall waited for each person to realize what she said before continuing.
Draco nodded and resisted the urge to hold onto the chair to steady himself.
“Nevermind actually, I’ve got to...potion now.” Harry winced and walked back to his table. His water was boiling, and Malfoy was staring at it with a frown.
Malfoy walked out of the bathroom then, also in uniform. Harry watched him as he walked by, the neatly stitched “Malfoy” in green letters catching his eye. For no apparent reason, seeing his last name written out like that made Harry’s stomach do the slightest flutter.
Draco could still feel Harry's lips against his as he walked into his home. He felt the ghost of Harry's hands traveling up his spine and holding him close as he walked up the stairs.
The Fat Lady seemed surprised to see him at first but gave him a wide smile. She began to sing her most impressive aria as a way to welcome him home.
Harry reached out and grabbed the Snitch with a familiar stretch.
Harry hesitated but then stood up. Malfoy was flushed and Harry didn't know what to do.
“Not dining in tonight?” asked the server, Gemma. She had been hired a few weeks after they started going there so she knew their usual routine.
Dean walked up next and announced “Pirate! En garde!” and made a fencing motion.
Malfoy was red in the face, hands now firmly clenched at his sides. He obviously knew everyone was staring at him in shock, so he cleared his throat and said, “I agree with Blaise.”
“I'm sure you're all waiting to run to your dormitories, which is exactly why I'm here. This year, due to the fact each dormitory was only built to hold seven years of students, a new dormitory has been provided for all of you in the West Wing.”
Draco looked around the space before him. He didn’t want to exactly insult Harry, but this house didn’t feel remotely like a home.
“I guess so.” was all Draco said in response.
There were large windows to bring in the natural light, although the sun had set for the day, the view was still pretty. His furniture was not the stylized, high arches and stiff cushions of the Manor. He had enlisted the help of Pansy and Millie to get couches that were not only comfortable but also stylish. A large pillowy couch was the center of his living room, made of a tan linen.
Harry shrugged, meaning yes.
From then on they did all the correct Pureblood things. Relationship Announcement dinner, Meeting the Parents dinner, and so forth. But Draco couldn't stand the formalities. Nolan knew this. They were constantly butting heads over it and it drove them both mad.
“Nevertheless... I’ve never felt so dreadful winning a game before. Except for that one time when I was five, and I hexed someone to win a prize for Mother, but I found out, rather late, that I could have actually won that prize on my own, no hexing involved.”
“No! Oh no, Harry! It’s just that Malfoy, Parkinson, Zabini… almost half of the Slytherin students… they just… left. After Voldemort’s death, they left Hogwarts and disappeared. It seems to have been a coordinated plan. No one has heard from or seen any of them since.”
Harry reluctantly walked over and dragged the chair back to sit himself on it.
He crossed the room to Draco, pushed him onto the bed and kissed him. Harry poured every bit of emotion he had felt during the last few months into the kiss. At first, Draco went still with shock, but then his arms wrapped around Harry and pulled him closer.
When Harry arrived at the top of the tower, however, he found none other than Draco Malfoy already there, sitting cross-legged on the floor with a book opened on his lap and a bottled water at his side. The tip of his wand was glowing, giving Malfoy just enough light to read his book.
“Really, Ginny?” Harry shot her an unimpressed look. “A matchmaking agency?”
The fifth date had all the qualities that Harry had specified. She was perfectly blonde, perfect height and just the right amount of cockiness. It was such a shame that Blaze had completely overlooked that one quality.
Seeing Draco in his room on the Marauder’s Map, Harry thought maybe they could talk and sort things over tonight. He donned his Invisibility Cloak and headed into the castle, determined to fix things tonight.
Draco pulled Harry into the nearest classroom, pushed him against a wall, and kissed him. It was so sudden and so shocking that Harry was frozen into place. It all happened in a flash, until Draco pulled back, his grey eyes wide with shock.
“Looking blindingly delicious tonight, Draco. Your room afterwards? Maybe we can revisit those long nights we had in France. ”
After that night, Harry added the Astronomy Tower to the top of his list for late-night excursions.
“Oh.” Harry was taken aback by the question. He was getting used to the fact that they were not going to be talking about their former relationship, but maybe not. “I don’t know.” Harry replied. “You never reached out either.”
“Um.” Harry said very eloquently. “Table no. 7?”
Blaise rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. “No, it’s not.” He said. “Come and take a seat.” He gestured to the chair across from his desk.
Draco’s expression softened.
Harry knew those words were meant to rile him up. He had been prepared to not react in the way Draco wanted. He walked closer to the boy and touched his shoulder.
It was a good thing that Goyle never had good aim, as the hit could have sent Harry to the infirmary. He noted that all the Slytherins were laughing and making kissing sounds at him except for a certain blond Seeker who was looking the other way.
“It’s a blind date, obviously.” Daphne rolled her eyes.
He pushed Harry angrily, turned away from him and walked out.
Harry turned to see Cho Chang beaming affectionally at him. She stood on her tiptoes to give Harry a kiss on the cheek.
Draco woke up with a start. He rubbed his face and looked at Harry with bleary eyes.
A faint blush tainted Hermione’s cheeks as she read her valentine card. She then looked up and cast a shy glance at Ron, who was looking down and was blushing himself. She opened the box of candied gems she had received with the card and offered some to Parvati, who gasped in delight at the beauty of the sparkling amethyst that she selected.
Harry smiled sheepishly.
Harry felt an ache in his heart when he had heard the hint of sadness in Draco’s voice. He pulled the Slytherin close to him in a hug, and kissed him.
“It’s just that... I’m tired of sneaking around. Not being able to see you, to hold you and to kiss you any time I want. It kills me inside. Whatever happens Harry, we can face it together.
Harry only narrowly missed the book that was thrown at him.
Six months went by before Harry had built up the courage to climb back up to the Astronomy Tower. As he lay down on the cold, hard floor, he thought about how this was the first time in a long time that he had been up here without Draco by his side.
“You don’t think all the expectations put upon me —
“His hair was all spikey!”
From the corner of his eye, he noticed the blond boy periodically looking up from his book to stare at him. For someone who had despised him so much, Malfoy sure seemed to enjoy looking at him.
Draco touched Harry’s face gently.
“I definitely would,” Harry replied without a single hesitation.
Draco, eyes bright after having too many butterbeer and pies, told Harry stories of his visits to several places, namely in Europe, where he had travelled extensively with his family.
Sometimes he would even go to the third floor to where the Mirror of Erised was now kept, standing in front of it just so he could see the image of the Slytherin next to him again.
Harry whipped his head around, never in a million years expecting to hear that voice again. He pinched himself, just to check he wasn’t dreaming. Harry was vaguely aware that his mouth may be open in shock, but there was nothing he could do as he watched Draco Malfoy walking towards him, the usual strut in his step, looking extremely fit in an expensive light grey turtleneck jumper and tailored black pants.
Harry’s heart, which had inflated at receiving Draco’s note, now shriveled worse than ever.
Harry glowered with anger, half-wishing his eyes were knifes so he could tear the both of them into pieces.
Soon, everyone was fully dressed and ready to leave. They took turns leaving the castle in small groups under the Cloak. Harry had given up keeping it a secret from the Eighth Years once Pansy and Millicent found out about it. Thankfully they all knew better than to speak about it to anyone outside their class. The last to leave was Harry, Blaise, and Draco.
himself, he would have thought they'd been hexed. But it was true.
He knew this routine like the back of his hand. It was all a power play with the Purebloods. And even though Draco did not care for any of that anymore, he wasn't daft. He knew what it all meant.
“How about you call it a night mate? Try and get some sleep.” Ron suggested and Hermione voiced her agreement. Obviously they could tell he hadn't slept last night. Harry had also told them about his nightmares, Hermione asking him multiple times to see a therapist, but Harry had declined. It was nothing he couldn't handle, but more importantly, he didn't want to burden anyone else with his tales of the war, so he’d keep it to himself.
Walking back to his shop, Draco couldn’t stop the string of expletives from leaving his mouth. There was absolutely no reason for him to be so worked up over that exchange. He had perfected his interactions with Potter to make sure such things hadn’t happened since they all became friends.
If Harry hadn’t been staring at Malfoy, he wouldn’t have noticed the slight tensing of his shoulders.
“Shut it.” Harry mumbled. He shoved them both in the direction of an empty table and then made his way over to Malfoy.
As Malfoy drew closer, Harry started to panic. What if Malfoy thought he was doing this on purpose? Malfoy might think Harry was trying to keep him in check, and had
. Millie and I were going back to the Common Room. We're planning a party you know.”
"Actually,” Draco sighed, “I happen to have a small issue."
It took Draco by surprise and before he could stop himself he was responding, “I don’t know about you, Potter, but this isn’t my first kiss. I think I can manage.”
As always, let me know your thoughts and what you think will happen next!
“That we did Potter.” Pansy said as she and Millicent came up behind them.
A deal was made that benefited both shops. Draco and Blaise would make these potions and balms by demand and Luna would pay and advertise Clover in her own store.
“We took the liberty of getting photos of all the costumes for you all. Muggle pictures, so don’t be expecting them to twirl around for you.” Justin said. He and Hermione started passing out the photos to the correct groups, and everyone was giggling and laughing as they shared.
Harry squeezed back into his spot next to Draco. Due to how many people were sitting at the booth, they were sat pressed close.
Well, maybe sexy wasn't the perfect word, but she definitely didn't look unattractive. The tan pants and white tunic looked expertly styled on her. Pavarti was sat a few steps away getting her hair in the classic Leia buns by Hermione.
Harry helped her set up the final crate as the various players began to gather. He recognized a lot of them but that wasn’t surprising as the last team had been made up of people years younger than him.There were a few new faces as well which was exciting. Almost no one paid him any mind after the first few minutes of subtle nudges to friends from those he didn’t know already.
Pansy rolled her eyes at him. "Draco. My simple, foolish, best friend. Harry Potter is the
"Okay, okay. Reset. This is why we're practicing!"
Malfoy shifted, bringing Harry back to the present. He seemed to be struggling internally about what to do next. He opened and closed his mouth before simply staring at the broom cleaner.
“Sorry.” Harry mumbled and let go. They walked over to the only available desk and sat down together. Harry placed his bag onto the ground and dug around it before sighing.
think that?”
“Er, hello?” Harry answered, wincing as it came out as a question.
“Well boys!” Blaise said loudly as he stepped out of the bathroom. “I bid you all a goodnight, and if this morning was any indication, you both need it.”
“What d’you figure the dorms look like?” Justin asked softly.
Ginny turned to him, Draco watching as her face softened just from looking at Blaise.
“Are you nervous?” Harry asked him.
“How’d you sleep, Harry?” Hermione asked, not even masking her concern.
“After seven years, finally!” Padma said, bouncing up and down in excitement.
Draco let out a small laugh. They actually did.
Harry stood in the doorway a moment longer before rolling his eyes and stepping past him.
“Where do you think you’re going Potter? Can’t break tradition, three class running.” Blaise said as he pulled Harry to the table already occupied by Malfoy.
“People tend to think they are.” Malfoy shrugged, his eyes shining.
Draco waved his hand in annoyance and said, "For tradition, Pansy. And you call yourself a Pureblood." And he sat back down still smiling.
Harry nodded. Draco led them out of the club, a hand gently guiding Harry by the small of his back. They stood in front of the entrance adjusting to the quiet outside.
“Brilliant.” was all Draco responded.
of us try out, we're Eighth Years.” Malfoy said.
And Harry was the only one who could hear him.
"I can't just show up with some random bloke off the street. It has to at least seem like I'm in a relationship." Draco said to Pansy.
Finally Harry said, "Alright this is only going to be as awkward as we let it." and he rose from his chair.
“Couldn’t tell you. Both times he was in the middle of saying something as Malfoy was leaving to change, and then he’d get hit.”
He thought back to that day, all the emotions he felt creeping back in. The terror, the anger, despair. The true fear in Draco’s face as Lucius excitedly brought him closer to examine Harry’s distorted face. The sheer horror turned into total confusion when Draco didn’t identify him. When Draco claimed he
A few groans and lots of laughter followed McGonagall’s statement.
He walked up the path, beckoning Harry to follow. Although it was only the start of fall, there was already a chill in the air. Inside the home followed the same aesthetic as outside.
He had basically spent a half hour making out with Harry Potter. And Harry was the one who suggested it.
was scrawled across the paper. Harry couldn't believe it. Was this a joke?
Harry nodded.
After spending more time than they should have at the shop, the group rushed back to school, just making it in time for class.
“Nothing is as good as Mum’s food,” Ron said, face stuffed with potatoes and chicken,”but this comes damn close.”
“Then you’ll finally know how it feels to win.” Harry joked and Malfoy tried not to grin.
Harry nodded and placed his hand on Draco’s now extended arm. Draco looked at him for a moment until he nodded again. The heavy pull of apparating entered his body.
The group sat around and drank, taking in the scene around them. A second round of drinks was brought soon after and a few of the Eighth Years took their drinks to the dance floor.
Nott seemed to be picking his words rather carefully as he spoke again.
“Good to see you again mate.” Dean said as they settled in. Seamus clapped his hand against Ron’s shoulder, laughing happily as Ron did the same.
go Draco Malfoy attended his wedding." Draco said. He knew she knew but still.
Draco was sure if he touched anything near him he would set it ablaze. He could feel the heat radiating off of himself and he could do nothing at this point to act natural. But then again, it's not as if Harry looked completely collected.
Draco felt a swell of pride at the compliment. He had worked hard to get this place to feel like home.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, who was staring firmly at his own reflection, hands running over the same patch of hair rapidly. He had a pink tint to his cheeks, obviously due to the steam from the shower.
Harry flew down to the ground just in time to be crashed into by his team. They all began hugging and cheering, the cheering from the stands deafening.
Ron was still gripping Harry's shoulders as he said, "Bloody hell mate we're actually playing in the Pitch again!"
Dean burst out laughing and the rest of the table followed suit.
"Oh no, nothing like that." Draco answered and Harry felt a wave of relief come over him.
"Absolutely yes, Draco! Potter makes so much sense!"
Harry eagerly got dressed and checked himself out in the mirror. The uniform was perfectly fitted to his body. Not too tight but not too big either. As he was looking at his reflection, Blaise walked out of the bathroom and wolf-whistled.
The three girls ran ahead and stopped in front of them with smiles.
"See you tomorrow."
“Even if you get a dress, boys!” Blaise called out.
Harry gave her a small smile, “Thank you, and I know. But I want to. I’m sure it’ll be fun. And Mum and Dad would want me to enjoy myself I’m sure. It’ll be my first Halloween without the Dursley’s leaving me home or the threat of being killed hanging over my head.” He tried to joke.
Harry cringed inwardly. As much as he missed Quidditch and would love to be on the team again, he did not miss the early wake up calls.
“We're going to be late for Charms.” Harry said quickly.
Harry focused on his potion and didn't look up until he had finished. By that time, Slughorn called for everyone to stop, and he began grading everyone's potions.
It had started off as a work relationship. Draco and Blaise opened a now quite lucrative potion shop, Clover, Cissus, and Rose, a few years after leaving Hogwarts. It had taken some time for the general public to come to trust them but slowly they came to be a well respected establishment in Diagon Alley.
Draco looked at the clock in confusion. It was only half past ten.
“So how’re things with the Harpies?”
Harry and Ron had led them to the Honeydukes secret passageway. After some minor complaints, mainly from Ron, the four climbed through carefully and arrived in the Honeydukes cellar.
“We all remember what occurred here last year. We must ensure nothing like that
And just like that, Harry was pulled into a new memory.
" Draco groaned. There was no way he was showing up to his ex boyfriend's wedding glaringly single. Even if it was the truth.
Malfoy dropped his ladle with a clatter.
George was all too excited when the group showed up, albeit surprised to see Pansy and Millicent with them. Millicent explained their grand party ideas, and George was immediately put at ease.
"We'll have to make a right team, I'm already thinking Dean, Susan, and Pavarti so far. Well rounded." Ron rattled on.
“Yeah, sorry. Back on track.” Harry was still grinning, “How about it was a mutual getting together. After a few months of...tenuous friendship we realized we had more in common than we ever let ourselves know. And slowly we crossed the line between friendship and relationship.”
“Blaise really said that?” Ginny asked after Hermione explained why he was on the ground when she got back.
"...most drinks won't be more than a fiver, so if you hand them this," Michael held up a five pound note, "they'll hand you back the change."
“It’s a bit odd, isn’t it? Having Slytherins in your bedroom?” he started.
Harry gave Draco a sympathetic smile. Draco fought the urge not to roll his eyes again.
So instead Harry spent the rest of the night listening to Malfoy’s sobs as they grew louder and more heart wrenching.
“Order for Harry?” Harry said once they reached the small restaurant.
Shocked faces from both Houses whipped around to stare at Harry.
The crackling fire, his favorite armchair, the various rugs and tapestries hung about.  It was a rush of familiarity that had Harry smiling softly in an instant.
The following Monday McGonagall had a special morning announcement.
-=-=-=-
“Well,” Malfoy said, startling Harry out of his thoughts. “At least we know we’re going to look good.”
Hermione turned to Harry then, reassurance in her eyes. He smiled at her and the two understood more than if they had voiced it aloud.
“I’m not sure how familiar you are with Pureblood tradition, but weddings are usually a four day event. A lot of mingling with the other guests, which is why I’m sure you can tell I can’t just ask any one man to be my date. It needs to be logical, Purebloods are always waiting to catch someone in a lie.”
“Was that Malfoy?” she asked in confusion. Harry nodded and Ginny looked even more confused.
Ron tripped over the step and choked on air.
Malfoy was transported directly into a memory, unlike Harry, who had been transported into that dark, empty space.
Harry didn't know why he was grinning. “Watching me, are you?”
“And friends hang out together, right? So where are you headed?”
Two days later Nolan’s wedding was still on Draco’s mind. Unfortunately Potter still seemed to be his best option.
Harry couldn’t help the wave of guilt that washed over him as he watched his friends having fun and enjoying themselves. Hermione and Ron had worked so hard to try and distract Harry, to take his mind off today but he was still thinking about it.
However he obviously calmed Draco as he let out a breath and smiled softly at Harry.
Their last class of the day was Defense, and despite the new teacher, Harry was excited. As he, Ron, and Hermione walked in, Professor Dreada walked up to them.
Harry though, seemed three shades darker than he had just been. “You mean kissing and stuff?”
Draco’s eyes widened instantly, looking at Harry in disbelief.
"I will leave it up to you to choose teams by Wednesday with a mix of all four Houses represented. With that," McGonagall addressed the entire Great Hall, "enjoy the rest of your breakfast and have a productive day of learning."
“You are not just a phase for me, Draco.” he murmured. “You can’t be. What I feel for you is too strong to just be a phase.” He pulled back and he could see the blond boy smiling brilliantly at him.
Harry frowned and started to move towards him.
As Harry stared at the glittering night sky now, he thought about how dwelling on the past could cripple him, trapping him in painful memories of heartbreak and grief, leaving him unable to move on. He knew he would eventually have to put it behind him, but that it would take quite some time to do so.
Draco jerked his arm away abruptly, as if the touch had scorched his skin.
Harry
Harry woke up from a deep sleep to see Hermione peering at him with the most curious look. Her face then lit up, and she gave a yelp as she leapt on the bed, hugging him tightly.
“For calling you an idiot?”
“What kind of prefect are you, always breaking the rules?”
“Yes.” Draco said. “Yes, you did. I wanted to hear it from you. I thought I was alone in my feelings. And then you broke up with me to go fight a war. It was so easy for you, telling me to not wait for you and just forget everything. It was so easy for you to leave while-“
Blaise nodded. “I assume you know what this place is?”
After he had bid her a good night, Harry went straight to Blaze. If they were taking his money, they should at least put some effort.
lives,” Harry said earnestly. “A wise wizard once told me that the secret for a meaningful life lies not in the future or past, nor in the way others see us, but in the ability to live the most out of each moment. Maybe we should do just that.”
Draco chuckled at that. “No, I haven’t written any fiction.”
He was extra careful when he entered the Slytherin common room, because Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were there, dressed to the nines, looking like they were going for a night out on the town. This was encouraging news for Harry, who preferred them out from the place as soon as possible so he could sneak into Draco’s room without anyone becoming suspicious.
Draco gave him a small smile and glanced back at the menu. “Have you decided what you want?”
Harry could’ve sworn there was a hint of sarcasm in his voice.
And of course, that concussion,” he added grimly.
Arriving at the library, Ron and Hermione hurried off to find their books while Harry tried to find a secluded area for them to do their research.
Harry shook his head as if to clear his thoughts. He was doing it again. He was deciding all by himself what Draco may or may not want. “I’m sorry, Draco.” Harry said sincerely. “I’m sorry.”
“Because we’ve been listening to you whining for the past month. I think we’ve figured out exactly what you’re looking for.” Blaise said with a smile. There was something knowing in that smile, but Harry wasn’t sure if he was just imagining it.
“Ah, yes. I heard you became an Auror. Quite a good one too.” Draco said.
“Anyone but you, Potter.”
Harry turned to look at him, surprised to have Malfoy suddenly opening up to him. Harry understood what Malfoy was saying, though; after spending so long being cooped up in a small area during his childhood, being in the open-air calmed him down.
*****
With a hand on Draco’s shoulder, Blaise stared longingly at him.
Harry was sure that he saw a tint of pink on Draco’s cheeks. He didn’t comment on it and instead dug into his own dessert. Harry’s thoughts were still racing inside his head. The more they came closer to finishing their desserts and in turn ending their date, the more Harry felt himself panic. Draco had been what Harry was after all this time. All those dates where he found something wrong to complain about was because none of them were Draco.
Draco studied him for a long moment before giving him a small smile. “Sure, why not? For old time’s sake.”
“Long time no see.” Draco said awkwardly.
“Maybe we are meant to live our own life, not the life we see others imagining for us; make our lives
“Why, Potter? You want this place all for yourself?”
Harry was sure that everybody at Blaze hated him at that point. But it wasn’t his fault that they couldn’t find him a decent date. He made sure to tell Ginny too, that her love experts were just a bunch of scammers. Harry wasn’t being unreasonable. If Blaze promises to find anyone their perfect match, then Harry wasn’t going to settle for any less.
Draco scoffed out a chuckle. “Yeah, Table no. 7.”
“Nobody has to know!” Harry huffed.
“Dumbledore told us You-Know-Who is planning to infiltrate Hogwarts, so we need to hasten the search for the rest of the Horcruxes. Harry, we don’t have much time!” Hermione whispered to Harry, being careful not to wake up Seamus and Neville who were sleeping in the same dorm as Harry, but tugging at him insistently.
Milicent only rolled his eyes. “That pride of yours will never really go away, will it?”
“I-“ Harry didn’t know what to say to that. True, he had assumed that Draco wouldn’t like him as the post war zombie that he was. And he genuinely thought Draco had most definitely moved on and the last thing Harry wanted was to barge back into his life and mess everything up. He genuinely believed he was doing the right thing. But now, looking at Draco, eyes filled with something akin to betrayal, Harry didn’t know if he actually did the right thing.
“I spent the night at the Astronomy Tower,” he said quietly. “The urge to see you was excruciating, but there were too many people surrounding you here, and I didn’t want to cause a scene with the Weasel or Granger.” He sighed.
She took a sip of her drink, turned to Harry, and excitedly counted out the reasons the Cannons would win this year.
Harry pouted. “How do you know this is the one for sure?”
“Well, Potter, that’s for me to know and for you
“We’ll see.”
“I was just wondering, that’s all. Stop being so defensive,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Harry shrugged, swallowing thickly and leaning back against his chair. “Okay, I suppose. Mostly just buried in Auror work.”
“Well, I still did.” Draco almost snapped. “Thought you would’ve at least reached out to check.”
Harry opened the door and came in just as Draco was in the midst of undressing. Seeing the door of his room opening, but not seeing anybody enter, had prompted Draco to draw his wand, which he was now levelling at the doorway.
“Did you guys even check what kind of a fashion sense she had?”
“Because you left!” Draco exclaimed. “You left me!”
“I wouldn’t know what to write honestly.”
“I wouldn’t expect anything less.” Harry smiled. His chest felt lighter at seeing Draco’s smile. “Come on, eat your pudding. It’s your favorite.”
“I promise I will hex him the next time I see him.”
“Maybe one day, I will bring you to Norway to meet Erik and his pet Norwegian Ridgeback. His father owns the Karasjok Kites. We can watch them play there. There’s also a wizarding theme park in Oslo. I had such fun there. We should definitely go.”
Harry was startled from his thoughts and saw Ginny smiling softly at him. She took the seat next to him in the Quidditch stands, offering him a chicken sandwich. He took it.
Pansy suddenly lowered her voice. “What is up with Draco, anyway? He’s been acting so weird. He hasn’t been free one night for the past few months and now suddenly he wants to go out with us?”
A look of disappointment marred Draco’s face. Harry braced for the anger to lash out from him. Draco would often react in anger whenever he was disappointed.
“Well, I’ve got to go. See you tomorrow night.”
Harry smiled back in return and gestured at the chair opposite him, indicating Draco to have a seat. There was a moment of awkward silence, broken only by a waiter coming to their table with the menus. Harry eagerly jumped at the chance to hide behind his menu, his heart still beating quite fast because it was Draco Malfoy sitting in front of him. Draco. His Draco.
As Draco left, Harry laid his head down to the pillow with a smile on his face.
It was the Slytherin’s team turn to use the Quidditch pitch today for practice. Ron and Hermione were dead asleep in their rooms as they had endured an endless week searching for, fighting, and destroying Horcruxes. Harry, too, was absolutely exhausted, but he couldn’t sleep without first seeing Draco.
“No.” Blaise said through a tight smile. “This is the last blind date we’ll send you on. We’re all sure this is the one, so if even this doesn’t work, then we don’t know what else to do. You’ll get a full refund.”
Blaise inhaled deeply and let it out slowly. He pressed his lips together in a tight smile. “Right. Noted. Next time, we’ll make sure it’s platinum blonde.”
“Hey, you know what we could do tonight? Let’s sneak out to London. Blaise told me there’s a new pub that serves their drinks in goblets made from dragon glass. We could use Polyjuice so no one would know that the Golden Boy is in their midst.” Draco brought out two bottles from the pocket of his robe.
“You actually believe that, don’t you?” he finally said, in a tone that Harry could not figure out.
“Of course, I do, Draco. I’d want to keep you until the end of time. For eternity, if I could,” Harry replied earnestly, emerald eyes glowing.
“Yeah.” Harry replied. “Um, yeah. Didn’t really expect to see you here.”
The longest relationship Harry had had was with Malfoy, and that was six years ago when he was still studying in Hogwarts. Their nine-month relationship was shrouded in secret and few people knew of it, except for Hermione, Ron and Pansy (who had accidentally stumbled upon them making out on Draco’s bed).
Sometimes Malfoy was already there when Harry had arrived, and sometimes he showed up after Harry did. Sometimes he would bring a book to read, and sometimes he would bring a book to write in. Whenever Harry was up there, so was he.
tolerable.
Draco spent some time just kind of staring into Harry’s chest before he looked up at him, an odd smile on his face. He searched Harry’s eyes for a long while.
Earlier this morning on the way to Hogsmeade with Ron, Harry had caught sight of the Slytherin trio comprising Draco, Pansy and Theodore hanging out at the Courtyard, and he saw red when he noticed Theodore’s arm wrapped around Draco’s shoulders. Swirls of possessiveness had enveloped Harry as he envisioned several acts of violence that he wished he could do to Theodore Nott just then. The only thing that stopped him from doing so was the thought of Draco’s reaction at Harry attacking his friend, no matter his motivation.
“I doubt it, but you’re welcome to try.” Harry muttered.
He ducked his head again and tried to read the words on the menu, but his head was all jumbled. A part of him was somewhat irritated as well, because while Harry was a complete mess, Draco appeared to be perfectly at ease. He wasn’t even a little bit affected by Harry’s presence.
Harry often thought about the progression of his relationship with the Slytherin. He did not dwell on being attracted to a
Now, however, he was stuck in front of Draco’s private room, as it seemed that the blond had changed the password. He remembered Draco mentioning how his passwords were usually the things that were important to him. He began trying all of Draco’s favourite things until finally, he guessed correctly. The answer made him blush.
“Draco.” Harry said tiredly. “Must we really do this?”
Harry had his head on Draco’s lap, and both of them were looking at the ceiling where the room was conjuring a dazzling display of the northern lights. Draco said he had experienced it firsthand when he was holidaying in Norway. The beautiful sight took Harry’s breath away.
“I do, yes.” Harry hummed. “Really, all I want is to get Ginny off my back, so just set me up with a date and then I’ll be out of your hair. If she asks, I really tried, but you couldn’t find me my other half or whatever.”
*****
Harry took a deep breath, staring up at the twinkling lights of Blaze and braced himself to go in and get it over with. At least he would make Ginny happy. The door opened with an overhead bell signaling the occupants that they had a customer. Harry didn’t know what he was expecting to see, but it certainly wasn’t this.
“I’ve been writing mostly.” Draco said. “I work for the Potions Weekly magazine.”
“I’ve missed you too.” Harry said, his brain to mouth filter clearly not working properly.
Harry enjoyed the change in their relationship, but it came with some oddities.
Draco pursed his lips and nodded. “You should know that I’m still very much pissed with you.”
“Want to sit with us? There’s Terry. Michael is somewhere around the library looking for herbology books.”
Harry felt a wave of exhaustion crashing over him. Despite the relief he had felt hearing that Draco was alive, another part of him felt a hollow emptiness, like a black hole had suddenly appeared to draw his soul away from his body. A single tear slid down his left cheek.
Tonight, as Harry smashed glass phials, threw books, kicked cauldrons, exuding raw emotions of pain and rage, Malfoy just stood there, calmly reciting the silencing charm and repairing all the things Harry had destroyed in the classroom.
“I’m not struggling, thank you very much.” Harry sniped.
“Oh Harry... I’m so sorry but…” Hermione closed her eyes and sighed.
Ginny groaned. “Stop being so difficult and just go to the bloody thing!” She said. “You know I won’t stop annoying you until you do, right?”
“Well, well, well.” A man lounging on one of the couches said. Harry recognized him as Theo Nott. “Look who the cat dragged in.” He said, a smirk on his face. “Saint Potter himself. The saviour of the Wizarding World.”
“That was the worst one yet.” Harry groaned settling on a couch at Blaze. “He was too polite! Way too nice! I like someone with a bit of backbone, not someone who would just agree with whatever I say.”
“Great.” Blaise said with a smirk and a mischievous glint in his eye.
“I told her, but she said she’d already figured it out, anyway. She confronted me the day after your accident because I wasn’t around when they celebrated the win.”
“Did Slytherin win the game? The last thing I saw was the Snitch in your hand.”
Harry opened his eyes to see Ron and Hermione standing at the edge of his bed, their eyes wide and panicky.
“Yeah, Harry, do you have a girlfriend we don’t know about? You seem different these past few weeks. Brighter. Happier. Whoever she is, Harry, I’m so glad for you.” Hermione reached across the table and covered his hand with hers.
Harry didn’t like how Draco worded it. He was still shocked, yes, but a part of him was overjoyed at seeing Draco again. “I mean, it doesn’t have to be.” Harry said before he could stop himself. “Since we’re already here, might as well have dinner?”
“How in the hell did you get in here, Potter?”
The subject of Voldemort and the situation involving him had never become a topic of discussion with them. Harry was relieved because he wanted his time with Draco to be an escape away from that part of his life.
He had noticed that Malfoy had changed over the summer; he was quieter and more studious now, almost beating Hermione with the highest scores in their pre-N.E.W.T. exams, much to her chagrin. However, Harry was still wary of him. Seven years of acting like a bully and trying to advance the Malfoy name at all costs did not disappear just because Malfoy had been acting all right for a few weeks.
Draco stood up, packed his things, and started walking away from Harry.
Malfoy gave him an incredulous look.
This was too much for Harry. He felt as if he could barely take a breath with the intense way Draco was looking at him. He let out a chuckle that sounded fake even to his own ears. “Well, anyway. As long as you’re enjoying your job, I’m glad.” Harry said hoping they could change the subject.
’ don’t you understand? Sod. Off.”
Draco leaned towards Harry and kissed him on the forehead.
*****
“So do you still plan to keep me even after our Hogwarts days are long over?” Draco asked with a smirk.
Draco’s lips were soft, and his mouth tasted like peppermint and cherries. He gently licked Harry’s lips, asking permission to open them. Harry opened his mouth and Draco’s tongue went in, colliding urgently with his.
“Why not?”
“Her hair was curly.”
He saw the Snitch at the same time Draco did. They each shot towards it from different angles, but were eventually lined up side-by-side, closing in on the tiny golden ball together. As they both reached for it, their hands touched, and Harry felt an electrical jolt that made him lose his focus. He then felt a painful slam at the side of his body, causing him to lose his balance.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “I was waiting for you.”
find out,” Draco said with a devilish grin.
“Fuck it, Potter. Are you dumb? Which part of ‘
Harry was missing him
He felt a dull ache in his chest.
“I’d say you had a pretty interesting life. Take inspiration from that maybe?”
“Hush. Nobody needs to know I’m here.”
“Sorry, Nurse Henley,” she replied, still not letting Harry go.
Blaise raised a brow at that. “Yes. And I’m pretty sure she meets all the requirements.”
“Potter,” Draco snarled. “What are you, stalking me now?”
“She wanted to split the bill!”
“You know, Gin, I think the Bats could actually win the Championship this year.”
“You never told me.” Draco said again.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Blaise while Pansy rolled her eyes at the both of them.
“He wasn’t that tall!” Daphne protested.
“No, Draco, wait.”
Harry let out a nervous chuckle. “If that was anything interesting.”
“Her eyes were the wrong shade of grey.”
“Potter, wake up.”
Draco turned to Harry with a small smile. “Well, I guess this is-“
Harry glanced at Terry Boot, who was looking at them with interest. However, it wasn’t Terry who had caught Harry’s attention; it was the person sitting at the table at the back that did. For there sat Draco Malfoy, books strewn all over the table, too engrossed in his study to notice Harry staring at him.
Harry had to do something. Even if they had fought for most of the meal, this was still the happiest Harry had been in a while. He was always the happiest when he was with Draco and that still hadn’t changed. Wouldn’t Harry be the biggest idiot on Earth if he let Draco slip away again? He once made the mistake of assuming he knew what Draco wanted. Was he really going to make the same mistake again by telling himself that Draco didn’t want anything to do with him anymore?
Harry laughed. “Leave it to you, Draco, to already have a plan for us. Now where in Merlin’s world did you get these Polyjuice potions from?”
Malfoy closed his book and sat up straighter against the wall. The place was silent for a few minutes, but then Malfoy started to tell Harry about the story of distant planets and warring noble houses.
Harry, as usual, had the table strewn with many chocolate boxes, valentine cards and gifts from his admirers. He would usually just cast a spell on them so they would reappear in his dorm, and then share the goodies with the rest of the Gryffindor boys. But today he seemed to be occupied reading each card, discarding each one for the next. He frowned when he read the last card.
There was a flash of something in Draco’s eyes that Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on. “I see.” He said. “I guess your evening is wasted now?”
Harry gave a weak smile.
“I…” Draco said suddenly, eyes looking everywhere except at him. “I don’t want to be just a phase for you, Harry. You know, like an experiment, where you would tire of me after you’ve had enough?” Draco’s discomfort at the notion was evident, despite his attempt to hide it.
It was the Easter holidays, and the students had a two-week-long break where they were allowed to go back home. Harry had decided to no longer go back to the Dursleys, so he went back with Ron to the Weasleys for the holiday, but he returned to Hogwarts alone a few days early before classes began. It took him several attempts to persuade the Weasleys that he needed time on his own to think before they finally acquiesced to his request. Molly insisted he bring back with him a trunkful of home-cooked food (as she felt
It was Christmas, and Harry was spending the week with the Weasleys. Everybody was back. The house was fantastically chaotic with Ron chasing the twins around the house, trying to experiment on him with their latest trick. Almost every one of them were lazing around in the house after having such a merry time opening their presents and having too much eggnog and plum cakes for brunch.
“I don’t need an agency to find me a partner. I’m capable of doing that myself.” Harry said, tipping back the last of his Firewhiskey.
The match between Gryffindor and Slytherin was almost 30 minutes in. The score was even, Ginny scoring one goal for Gryffindor with Urquhart scoring for Slytherin.
“The fun kind.”
“You are looking a bit off-colour. Are you okay?” asked Cho, her bright brown eyes turned attentively to him.
It’s a miracle you only had broken ribs and a sprained foot.
“Get the
“You’ve been saying that for a month now.” Harry scoffed.
Harry smiled so wide until his cheeks hurt.
“I didn’t abandon you!” Harry exclaimed. “I-“
Hermione, however, seemed to know what Harry was thinking.
Mercifully, the waiter appeared then with their food and Harry almost jumped up his seat and hugged the man. The food proved to be an enough of a distraction. Some kind of a chicken dish was placed before Harry and he was glad he didn’t accidentally order a garden salad at least.
When Harry turned to look at Hermione, he saw she had that familiar, thoughtful look on her face.
“I don’t want rude.” Harry said rolling his eyes. “But someone a bit snarky and prickly. She just wasn’t snarky enough.”
Draco stood and walked to the other side of the tower, clearly trying to be as far away from Harry as he could.
“It was.” Draco said without missing a beat.
Harry hugged Hermione back, and slowly the memories of the past few weeks flooded back to him. He remembered Voldemort was dead... and Harry had nearly died as well. Or had he actually died... and then come back?
Harry woke up, wincing in pain. He reached for his glasses at the table beside his bed. There was a only sliver of light illuminating the dark so that it took a while for his eyes to adjust to the sight, and when they did, he could see the many cards, flower bouquets, gifts and balloons levitating all over the room, and also… He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was perhaps seeing things. That couldn’t possibly be Draco Malfoy sleeping on that chair, could it? Maybe the hit had really messed his head up.
However, it is all entirely up to you. I do not wish to force you into doing something you don’t want to do.”
Harry smiled. Draco’s plans for their future had never failed to make him feel warm inside.
He didn’t know how he could take the worlds back though. “You knew.” He said in the end.
Two Slytherin sixth-year girls giggled as they walked past Harry outside the entrance to the Slytherin Common Room, Harry needing to flatten himself against the wall to avoid them slamming into him.
Malfoy gave Harry a meaningful look. “Maybe we should,” he replied.
“It actually has nothing to do with that,” he said gently. “I just don’t want anything to happen to you. What I’m involved with right now… it’s dangerous for anyone I care about, and I care about you more than anyone. I hope you know that.”
As Harry sat at the small but cozy restaurant, waiting for his date to show up (who was late, by the way), he started to wonder if he was being trapped by Blaze into enduring a horrible date with a horrible person as revenge. He was just contemplating running off before his date showed up that a familiar voice called his name.
Harry went up to Ron’s room, carrying a package that Molly said had arrived earlier for him while he was still sleeping.
“Yeah, you do.” Ginny dismissed and continued on, pointedly ignoring the scandalized look on Harry’s face. “Like I said, they’re pretty amazing. New to the business. Well, kind of.” Ginny furrowed her brows, as if debating the technicalities of what was considered new and what was not. “They started about a year ago. But anyway, that is not important. What is important is that they have an amazing success rate!”
“You don’t have to feel ashamed to admit that you’re struggling to find someone.” Milicent said from her chair.
Hearing the dreadful news magically cured Harry from his sleepiness. He jumped from his bed to pack his things, but stopped when he saw his dress robes hanging from his wardrobe. The Senior Ball was tonight. He knew he had to send a message to Draco to let him know he couldn’t make it.
“Me neither.” Draco said. “Blaise set me up on a blind date. I didn’t think it would be with Harry Potter.”
“Give it a real chance.” Blaise said.
“For being the bigger person and forgiving me.”
“I know about you and Draco, Harry. I’m so sorry.”
A couple of minutes passed by, during which the tower was again silent except for the soft sounds of the wind. Harry was just about to close his eyes when he heard Malfoy speak.
“What the hell is it this time?” Theo barked.
“He said no to dessert!”
They were both kissing hard, teeth gnashing, hands exploring each other bodies. Draco pulled away, breathing hard, lips glistening with Harry’s saliva. He changed his position and pushed Harry downwards to the bed.
“What are your plans for the future, Potter? Or is the future of the Golden Boy of the Wizarding World already set that he doesn’t need to think about it?” Malfoy asked with a teasing glint in his eyes.
Later, as Harry looked at the sleeping boy beside him, seeing the bruises and the raw bite marks on his neck and shoulder, he felt a wave of shame descend upon him. Sometimes, the intensity of his feelings towards Draco scared Harry. He promised himself to keep this part of his affection towards Draco in check, worried that Draco might think him uncaring...
“How long was I out?”
“Just tell me, Mione, did he die?” he managed to ask, with a tightening in his throat and a hitch in his breath.
“Oi.” Ginny scowled. “But yes, my new best friend. She was telling me the other day how she went to Blaze and how they actually managed to find the perfect guy! He’s the son of a very rich Russian oligarch. Ivan. They are very happy together now.” Ginny said. “Pansy always had trouble finding love and now she swears she will marry Ivan someday.”
Draco just looked at him quietly, a thoughtful look on his face.
“Yes, he was!” Harry argued. “Didn’t I specify which height I wanted? I’m pretty sure I wrote it down on the form. Maybe go through it again.”
Pansy chastised me for turning into a Hufflepuff and wearing my heart on my sleeve,” Draco said with a small smile. “Or rather, in her words, ‘an imbecilic, lovesick Hufflepuff’.
He still remembered the Slytherin password from that one night when Draco had sneaked Harry into his room. They had spent that entire night listening to music, playing wizarding board games, and chatting until they both passed out on the floor of his room.
Later that night in the Room of Requirement, Harry was rough with Draco, pinning the blond to the bed and delivering painful, bruising kisses. At one point, he bit his skin so hard that he could taste copper. Draco, saying nothing, just gripped Harry harder, readily submitting to the manner in which Harry was treating him.
“It’s okay, Harry, you don’t have to tell me, I understand. Hey, you want to see what Dean gave me? Meet you downstairs. Ron and Charlie were already having a go at it!”
“Yeah, don’t worry, mate,” Ron added. “You know you have us.”
Their conversation was somewhat stilted after that, both of them skirting around topics that weren’t ones they were used to. Their conversations were never mundane, but now, Harry felt as if they were both trying so hard to ignore the elephant in the room that they ended up talking only about weather and politics.
Harry put the piece of clothing and card carefully into his bag and followed Ginny downstairs.
Harry grabbed the paper and pulled it back so he would actually be able to see it properly. The flyer was decorated in colours of blue and gold. “Blaze” it said on the top in big gold letters. Harry read the contents of the flyer before turning to Ginny, who was looking at him with big, earnest eyes and a shit eating grin on her face.
This was my first time ever writing smut so sorry if it sounds odd or rushed! I was a little nervous posting this chapter but I think it came out alright over all.
“Harry’s got a year on Malfoy, but that’s neither here nor there.” Ron said from beside him with a grin.
Hermione wrapped him into a hug and kissed his cheek. Harry kissed the top of her head and then they continued with the list.
Harry looked up to see Hermione’s cheeks had gone slightly pink but Ron reached over and placed his hand over hers.
A bemused smile formed on Harry’s face. “You did. You and Nott, huh?”
Exclamations of excitement filled the hall so loudly McGonagall had to pause. Once the noise diminished slightly she continued on.
Pansy and Millicent grabbed all sorts of candies before paying.
He knew Draco meant nothing from his comment and that none of the Slytherins meant anything from their laughter. But regardless, any talk of blood class from them brought up old memories.
The rest of the train ride had no interruptions, and it was one of the most fun times Harry had had on the Hogwarts Express. But through it all Harry couldn't shake the look on Malfoy’s face from his mind.
“Potter?”
Hermione and a few others nodded seriously as the rest nodded much less enthusiastically.
-=-=-=-
"You know he only invited me for the press, right? If I don't go I'm screwing tradition and if I
games, and most importantly, alcohol!”
“Potter grabs the Snitch! Gryf-White team wins the match!” Seamus’ voice called out.
“Pansy’s actually the one who suggested it. Well, we both thought of it at the same time but that’s really neither here nor there at the moment. We realized it had to be someone who would have wanted a relationship out of the public eye,” Draco could hear the tension in his voice at the word relationship, shifting his gaze from Harry, ”someone who would make sense, who I’ve been seen with before this week,”
"Have you ever been with a boy?" Harry asked before overthinking it. He honestly expected Draco to not answer but he wanted an answer.
If he was expecting his friends to stop Blaise, he would be mistaken. Everyone started cheering and Harry swore he heard Seamus throw in a wolf whistle. Blaise had him sitting in the chair before Harry could object for himself.
Draco’s stomach did a small flip at that sentence. Harry was looking at him intently.
The pain Harry had felt, the pain Harry had caused Malfoy by using that spell, he never knew it was so horrible. If Harry could go back in time and stop himself from using it, he would. Not even Malfoy deserved that kind of pain, and Harry had been so naive to think he should use it.  The book had said ‘to use on enemies’ not a childhood rival. At the time, it had seemed life or death, but now Harry knew better.
She smiled warmly at him and walked back to her seat.
As always, let me know your thoughts and what you guys think will happen next!!
“Do you know what kind of games the girls are planning?” Harry asked as he stripped off his shirt and changed to his pajamas.
Literally no one can stop me from thanking everyone who has commented and shown love for this fic at every chapter so THANK YOU!! It makes my day to read them, they are so sweet and I reread them constantly.
Ginny nodded.
“Was it something I said?” Blaise mumbled, rubbing his jaw softly.
,” McGonagall gave a pointed look at Dean and Seamus and then to Harry and Ron before continuing, “so I have taken it upon myself to seat you alphabetically.”
Malfoy stood up abruptly at that. “Shut up, Blaise.”
Harry paid and then they joined back up with Ron to walk over to Flourish and Blott’s, Harry clutching his purchase tightly.
Millicent laughed as Pansy pretended to fluff up her hair.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were crouched down, hidden from view, listening in on an Extendable Ear.
“Next time you see the girls you’ll have to give your compliments.” Draco said as he led them to the kitchen.
Blaise shook his head, “They want everything to be a surprise. But knowing them, they’ll probably play some that we used to play back in the Slytherin dorms.”
Malfoy scoffed and began stirring his carefully.
Harry got on his broom and flew a few laps as Ginny divided the teams. He didn’t fly too high but he wanted to get a feel for the air before they began. He landed once Ginny began laying out the ground rules for tryouts and waited for her to officially start.
Draco rolled his eyes and lightly pushed him so he could draw his own name. Harry waited intently. Draco’s small smile turned into a frown as he read it.
“And why, Blaise, are you boring him with those stories?” Malfoy’s voice held no emotion as he spoke, much to Blaise’s apparent glee.
“Well don't.” Malfoy said and he grabbed his bag before storming out with the bell.
Pansy was grinning at him excitedly.
Harry's eyes instantly locked with Malfoy's as Ron shook him in excitement. He and Draco stared at each other in disbelief before smiling widely.
As the night carried on everyone was in high spirits. They were definitely one of the loudest patrons in the pub but they didn't care. Dolan didn't seem to mind either, as he kept their drinks filled and even brought them shots "on the house".
“Oh, I uh…” Harry mumbled. He didn't actually know, he just didn't want to stand next to Malfoy waiting for his water to boil. How awkward…
Draco still looked unconvinced and now Harry was berating himself for causing it.
“Come on Granger, let's check out our new room.” Pansy said with a grin as she and Millicent locked arms with Hermione. She let out a small yelp before going slightly pink.
change in front of Harry.
“When’s the wedding?” Harry cut him off.
Draco, Harry noticed, wasn't paying attention either.
“But we hate each other!” Hermione squeaked, instantly turning red.
"What was that about?" Harry asked as they sat down.
“For our first lesson, I thought we would make Gregory's Unctuous Unction! Not a terribly difficult potion to brew, and a very fun one at that! Now, who can tell me what it does?”
“Justin and I were just talking, and we have an idea.” She said as she leaned over excitedly. Harry sat in the armchair beside them as Justin continued.
As if Harry had read his thoughts, Draco felt his face heating up.
The staircase led downstairs and split at the end, leading to the Girls dorms and the Boys dorms.
"Yeah, and what if I accidentally rip it taking it out of my coin purse?" Neville asked.
-=-=-=-
Malfoy’s frown deepened. “Why do you think I care what class you have next?”
We're halfway through now, next chapter will be up Friday and it is quite the ride if I do so so myself ;)
“Save it, Potter. And get off the ground, you'll cause a scene.” Draco said, trying to sound unbothered but his voice was even shakier than before.
Blaise shrugged but the smile stayed put on his face. It grew even wider when Draco grabbed his pyjamas and started toward the door.
“Now, since it is a much smaller class than normal, you will be two to a desk and only using these ten.” she continued, motioning to the front ten.
“Can we pick another if we don't like ours?” Susan asked.
Harry’s hand reached out instinctively and grabbed Draco’s waist. The three of them stilled, Harry’s hand keeping tight on the other boy's waist. Thankfully, only Peeves floated by. The three of them reached the rest of the group a moment later. Harry dropped his now slackened hand from Malfoy’s waist and dragged the Cloak off of them.
Harry stayed put, feeling utterly confused.
“What’s in this?” Draco asked as he eyed it curiously. His drink was bright blue while Harry’s was bright green.
“Are you jealous?” Harry asked, quieter.
With a shrug, he said, “You’re the only git who takes his tea like that. Kind of hard to forget.”
He heard Harry chuckle from beside him. Draco felt his cheeks burn up
“He loves me, he loves me not, he loves me, he loves me not…” Blaise called out with a smirk plastered on his face.
I hope you all enjoyed this fic! I really liked the idea of making the epilogue just certain snapshots and snippets of their relationship progressing. The whole thing was super fun to write! Thank you again for the comments and kudos, let me know what you thought of this final chapter as well!
Draco looked at Harry once more, “Which led us to you.”
Harry still hadn’t spotted Malfoy as Voldemort’s voice rang out.
Ron smiled back, “Why’s that?”
Of course. Honestly, Harry didn’t know why he was expecting anything different. Louder wolf whistles left the crowd this time. Everyone started making comments at once “can’t break tradition!”, “how
“Now, using what I just taught you, begin practicing with your partners.”
“Alright, I’ll just wash up and see you in the morning.” Draco said.
“Welcome back everyone to another year at Hogwarts.” she started, and the Hall erupted into cheers and claps of excitement.
. Without looking, he shoved Harry with his elbow, causing the other man to stumble into the wall beside them.
Ron finally regained his ability to speak and he asked nervously, “How do you know about the cloak?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, staring at Draco with slight confusion. Draco could feel his face beginning to heat up but he ignored it.
"He would never agree to it. And besides, I don't want to go with Potter. Who would even believe that?"
Harry scanned the room quickly, but no one had seemed to notice either of them.
“It’s been a while since I’ve played against you you know.” Malfoy said as they sailed above the match.
“Alright alright,” Harry said with another small laugh, “that’s what we’re doing now anyway. Yours or mine?”
Harry just rolled his eyes at that. They grabbed their brooms and greeted the Ravenclaw captain and tryouts before leaving them to do their own evaluations.
“Malfoy, I-”
Harry just kept running, his hand slipping from Malfoy’s wrist and into his hand. The pair ran through the mostly empty halls and finally reached the Charms classroom.
-=-=-=-
LOL literally smallest edit right here to say, can you tell how much I adore Pansy Parkinson?? This chapter is like my little ode to her. I love the way the Drarry Community has made her such a great, flawed, beautiful character. All the slytherins in this fic really, I love them all thanks to the work the fandom has put behind them. Anyway, see you next chapter!! Think there are just 2 left now!
The three of them made their way out to the Common Room and then all together they went to the Great Hall. Those who were not participating in the game had swapped colors again but since there were no classes, they were wearing each other's sweaters, scarves, or hats. Hermione was wearing someone's blue and silver striped sweater paired with someone else’s yellow and black hat.
Harry led them up the front steps and into his house. The interior was just as Draco remembered. It was nice but lacked a sense of homelyness. Almost as if it were a show home.
He made sure they were never alone together for longer than three minutes, whether that was at a restaurant, bar, or otherwise. He rarely spoke to Potter without a buffer, only when work forced him too. Of course, he was always subtle about it. He didn’t want anyone to know he was carefully calculating his interactions with the other man. The only reason he was even so careful about it was to ensure their friend group didn’t implode from the inside because of old grudges and what not. Sure, they had all spoken at length about their past, but Draco could never be too careful.
Blaise turned back to Harry and rolled his eyes.
That small part of his brain that Draco so desperately tried to ignore was screaming the opposite.
Much to his further surprise, Harry did not seem more flustered. He actually laughed a little. “Yes, Malfoy. That’s the reason we’re even having this conversation.”
“Blaise wrote and sent a love letter to Snape.”
Draco watched for Harry’s reaction, and as he didn’t immediately seize up or vomit, he sipped his too.
“You guys played Muggle games?” Harry asked, his surprise not hidden well.
-=-=-=-
Harry’s eyes widened and he quickly sputtered out, “McGonagall isn't like that, she won’t stop you from trying out, she would never-”
Harry ran in and down to his room, throwing the door open and running to his trunk. He rummaged around it, throwing his clothes left and right, galleons flying out of one of his robes. A Chudley Cannons jersey flew over to Blaise’s bed and his own old Quidditch jersey got tossed behind him.
Blaise swiped a bit of toothpaste onto his toothbrush before saying, “I for one slept like a baby. Soak it up while you can, I guess. Coursework is about to come pouring in.”
Draco hated the lack of spontaneity, Nolan hated the "wrong" ambition Draco showed. Pursuing a meaningless shopkeeper career was embarrassing, Nolan said, when Draco had all the talent and potential to work in the Ministry.
As the match progressed Harry began actively searching for the Snitch. His team was behind but if he caught the Snitch now they would win. From across the field he saw Malfoy dive. He took off, flying as fast as his broom could carry him. The ground was pulling in close and Harry still didn’t see the Snitch. He saw Malfoy still and as Harry drew closer he could see him laughing.
“I always sleep on the left.” Draco said.
Ron shrugged. “Probably nothing. You were both late to Charms, and McGonagall just made a mistake with her list. That's what’s really odd. But if you want me to beat up Malfoy again, just say the word.”
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, I do apologize. It seems I haven't marked you down.”
Harry landed with a hard thud, and his eyes burned from the sun that had appeared. After his eyes adjusted, Harry immediately recognized the scene.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nott, Chaser number two.” Harry called out.
"Much better." Harry finished in a quiet voice.
“Please...take your seats.” Flitwick said and then resumed his introduction. Or well, tried to. The Eighth Years were all staring at the pair in the doorway.
“Fuck yeah!”
"I suppose that makes sense." Draco said evenly.
As September came to a close, Harry's thoughts began to drift more and more to his parents. The anniversary of their death was less than a month away and Harry finally had the time (and freedom) to visit them.
“Potter, you do realize the potion is supposed to stay in the pot, right? If you stir it with any less caution you'll end up spilling the rest.” Malfoy muttered.
Before Draco could retort, Blaise responded, "Now Pansy, nothing in the Manor is tacky. They're just...severe."
Harry's own costume hadn't needed much to perfect. He had slipped the tunic over his head and applied the various gold accessories. He laced up his wrap around sandals, his strong calves accentuated by the straps. His arms were framed rather nicely by the squared neckline of his toga. The finishing touch was the golden laurel wreath placed upon his head.
“Draco wore
?. He looked away then.
“Draco, mate, you’ve really outdone yourself this time.” Blaise choked out through more laughs once the store was empty.
Harry just laughed softly before turning back to his breakfast with a small smile.
“We want all the Eighth Years to dress in muggle costumes and experience muggle nightlife. We think it’ll be really fun.”
“No, that would be too soon. We would have slipped up at least once during that time. Rumors would have started.”
Harry didn't know any of those three girls well, but he figured they would get along well enough.
“Gomez?”
Harry gave him a sheepish smile.
“Very good! Well then, Mr. Zabini, congratulations! You've earned this potion.” Slughorn announced, and began clapping. Polite applause followed and then the class began packing their bags as Blaise transferred his potion into a vial.
“A rouge party! How could I say no?” and he directed them to the best stock he had.
Draco didn’t have to turn around to know his friends were all giving each other concerned looks. He felt so small in that moment, like he was the scared Sixth Year all over again. But this
Even through the ear, Malfoy’s sneer came across.
“Now that everyone has had the chance to settle in for the school year, I will explain our Inter House Unity plan. As all of you are aware, the House Cup is staying as just that, the House Cup. However, Hogwarts is a home first and foremost and we are a family to everyone here, regardless of House. In the past years, this has not been true. A divide has been created between our houses.”
"Number one," she said, raising a finger, "Potter hates being in the papers. Number two, Potter is single!"
Once he spilled into his own hand Harry frustratingly washed his body again, as if it would erase what had just happened. He felt completely off. He had never wanked to a boy before and certainly never to the thought of Malfoy.
Pansy was sitting on the counter, smirking at her best friends.
Was it just Draco, or were they smiling an unusually high amount tonight?
As the date for their Muggle outing grew closer, Harry's apprehension grew stronger. Whenever he had the chance to be alone in his room he would take out the old scrapbook Hagrid had given him all those years ago and stare at the pictures inside. The scrapbook itself was now worn down, the corners losing their leather as it aged. The photos inside however were still in perfect condition.
Ron ducked his head out right before the door closed and grabbed Harry’s arm.
“We’re celebrating.” Theo announced to the three of them, flashing a smile that Harry could only describe as dazzling.
“There was nothing to work out, Ron. We both agreed we're better as friends.”
Draco nodded and took a hold on Harry's arm before Harry apparated them to his home.
They pulled apart for real this time, letting go of each other completely. If he wasn't red before, Draco most definitely was now. He let out a shaky breath just as Harry did the same. They locked eyes and smiled, then both began laughing softly.
“It’s lovely, Malfoy.”
Harry thought and then he and Malfoy were back in the classroom.
Malfoy went to the sink next to him, and started brushing his own teeth.
Now, a year and a half later, Draco and Harry had become working partners that got weekly drinks with their friends. Their respective friend groups. Which had molded into one big group by now. Basically, he and Harry were pretty much friends.
“He’s a fucking creep.” Draco agreed.
-=-=-=-
Draco’s eyes narrowed, “What can I say, Fourth Year was quite the learning experience.”
Gemma did the same before grinning at the two of them.
I want to say the BIGGEST thank you to every person who commented and kudo'd and bookmarked this fic! I especially want to thank you guys who have been here with me basically this whole time, writing your thoughts and feelings about this fic. Reading all of your comments truly makes my heart happy and I can't thank you enough.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, seeming almost nervous under Draco’s gaze, “I don’t know. I just feel like I would have. Out of the two of us. I made the first move with Ginny. And Matt.”
Hermione hit Ron on the arm again but she was laughing as well.
Draco nodded.
With that the whole group let out a cheer. A few of the more money knowledgeable headed to the bar to buy. They came back with strange looking drinks, smoke rising from the top and vivid colors in the glasses.
Draco stopped abruptly. “Did I?”
Instead, all he did was whisper an apology to Malfoy before taking out his book.
This time Harry nodded. “Yeah, you’re right. I don’t mind a bit of cuddling up. And,” he scratched the back of his head, “if the situation calls for it, a kiss or two wouldn’t be crazy.”
With that, Draco apparated home.
Neville reached in next, reading out, “Joker. Who’s that again?”
Blaise stood up with visible discomfort, obviously wanting to take the reins away from Nott, who was never one for words.
“We do?”
Draco rolled his eyes, “Let’s just push it forward. How about July this past year?”
Without warning, Harry was thrown backwards, and he felt himself being transported back to the classroom. He couldn't hear anything over the loud drumming in his ears and his ragged breaths. He cautiously opened his eyes and saw Malfoy sitting slouched in the chair, sweating, but otherwise handling it much better than Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry decided to wait in the Common Room for Ron and Hermione who, thankfully, were already out there.
“Alright then, we’d like Pavarti as Chaser.” Harry said and more murmurs filled the space.
Harry felt his cheeks burn. “You arse.” he said suppressing a grin and flying back up.
, he was by no means a beginner.
"Not much of a dancer?" Draco asked as they both finished their second drink. Harry shook his head.
Their end of the table all looked down to the Slytherin side, and Harry was surprised to see them all looking already. He locked eyes with Malfoy right away and smiled, Malfoy looking down quickly. Harry stayed staring however as Blaise whispered something to Malfoy causing him to turn pink. Blaise shared whatever he said to Pansy who’s face lit up before the two of them turned to find Harry already looking.
Draco dropped his hand as soon as they were off the dance floor.
Harry stood dumbfounded in his spot as Ron and Hermione came over.
Malfoy’s cheeks coloured again but he made no retort.
“How's it going Harry? Malfoy treating you well?”
The Eighth Years were all looking around humbly, not knowing what to do. The only people not subtly basking in the attention were the Slytherins.
“Because of this, there are new room assignments with new roommates.” A scroll appeared in McGonagall's hand and she tapped it with her wand. Copies of the list floated to each student.
Neither of them said anything as they stared at one another, Harry still planted in the trunk. It was another minute before Harry struggled up.
Thank you for reading! Let me know what you thought and what you think will happen next!
“Wait did you say Nott? As in Theodore Nott?” Harry interrupted.
One day as Harry was walking back to the Common Room after a quick library session, Ginny stopped him.
Draco looked away, studying the barren countertops. He suddenly felt hyper aware of what he was doing, how he was breathing, where his hands were placed. He could see Harry shift from his peripheral, moving about in his chair.
“Off you go, Potter.” Draco said feigning nonchalance, but Harry could hear the slight tremor in his voice.
Harry shook his own head, "Ron and Hermione weren't even-you had to have known it was them."
The trio shook their heads no, and Neville walked away with his head hung low. Harry let out a long yawn and stretched.
Harry made his way to the Quidditch Pitch in the silence of the early morning. It was a nice reprieve to walk along the grounds at this hour. As he made his way closer, he could see Ginny setting up the various equipment for the tryouts.
"We did." Harry answered with a smile. The bartender placed two drinks in front of Draco, who handed her a tenner and gratefully accepted his change.
He looked over at Malfoy’s and swallowed roughly. The costume had the same sandals as Harry’s, though that was where the similarities stopped. Harry’s portrayed a strong, hard god, where Malfoy’s looked beautiful and elegant. The draping over the shoulders was held together by a thin gold chain, and a thin golden headband and belt. It was so...delicate. Harry couldn’t help but picture Malfoy wearing the costume right then, his sharp features contrasting with the softness of the gown. The overall airy and floaty quality of the costume juxtaposing the very essence of who Malfoy is.
Draco let out a huff and rolled his eyes. He was an excellent kisser, Potter just mucked up their first go.
“What the hell, Potter!” Malfoy yelled as they ran up the stairs and out of the Common Room .
“I was only joking, Malfoy.”
invite you all to the start of the year bash thrown by the beautiful and lovely, Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode!” Blaise began applauding and the rest followed suit.
“I-what?” Harry said, stopping mid way to his seat. He stared at Draco who stared right back. Harry seemed confused now, as if he hadn’t even realized it.
“Ah well that must have been fun. For the two of you. I bet.” He forced a smile onto the end of his sentence which only caused Draco to raise an eyebrow.
"I think he’s overrated."
It appeared Malfoy had jokes too.
I hope you all enjoyed this fic and that it brought a little bit of joy to your world at the moment.
They sat across from each other in a lull of the conversation, a second cup of tea long since had.
Harry let his gaze linger on the room for a moment longer. Students were still hanging about despite the late hour.
“Where’ve you two been?” Hermione asked with a frown.
“Nervous, mate?” Ron asked Harry as they made their way down to the Pitch.
Draco scowled at her and turned back to the cauldron in front of him.
“We’ll have Dean as Chaser.” he said, causing a few murmurs and one overly exaggererated exclamation of “a Gryffindor!” from Millicent.
“This might actually work.” Draco said in response.
-=-=-=-
Draco narrowed his eyes, "You barely gave me a second to react before you pulled off me!"
Harry finished showering and wrapped the towel around his waist before stepping out. Of course, Malfoy was standing there, fixing his hair in the mirror. He glanced at Harry through the mirror but looked away quickly. Harry was suddenly very aware of how naked he was. The only other sink was right next to Malfoy though, so Harry went over and began brushing his teeth. He wished he would have done it in the shower, but he hadn't thought of it then.
“Oh calm down, if we wanted to steal it, we wouldn't have told you we knew about it.” Millicent muttered, eyes narrowing.
“Sorry, Headmistress.” Seamus said, but his excitement was not at all dulled.
Refusing to think anymore -except of Nott and Malfoy -Harry took his dick back in his grasp and finished what he had already begun.
“Excellent! Now whoever brews the best potion gets to keep it. Open your books to page one hundred thirteen everyone.” Slughorn looked around the room excitedly before instructing the students to get to work.
“Sorry I’m late, June can talk an ear off if she wants to. And she wants to.” Blaise said with an easy grin.
Both boys stared at each other, breathing heavily. Harry stood there, not knowing
Harry stared blankly at McGonagall. He turned to his left, where Malfoy was the only one left standing. Harry realized why he had looked so put off when she called Nott. She had skipped him too.
"Do you want me to order them?" Harry asked as he reached for his money.
“So Malfoy’s afraid of changing in front of you?” Hermione said this time.
Harry stood a little ways away as Draco waited for the bartender. A man quite a bit taller than Draco walked up next to him. He was wearing an unbuttoned red flannel shirt, a white sleeveless shirt, blue jeans, and work boots. He had dark brown hair that was styled to one side and a thick beard. Harry assumed he was supposed to be some sort of lumberjack.
Not to mention their whole relationship was so very Pureblood. Daphne was the one who introduced them in the first place, Nolan was her cousin. When they first met it was almost like a game between the two. An inevitable coming together, both men charming and being charmed by the other. Draco was instantly attracted to Nolan's dazzling smile, the slightly crooked jaw only making him more handsome. His curly ashy brown hair framed his face beautifully. If anything, Draco knew from that first meeting that they were in for one
“That’s not how the world works.” Daphne chimed in. “People will know sooner or later.”
“Um,” Harry hummed, dropping onto one of the couches. “Did you guys even read through all the forms I filled?”
Harry couldn’t help but smile at that. That was Draco’s way of forgiving him. He looked up into Draco’s eyes. “Thank you.”
“You mean dinner?” Draco asked, a hint of uncertainty in his voice.
Ginny waved her hand dismissively. “We’ve already established that you do. So, let’s move past that.” She said. “You know Pansy, right?”
It was another sleepless night for Harry Potter. The hunt for Horcruxes had been taking a mental toll on Harry — never during any actual execution of the plans he, Hermione, Ron, and Dumbledore had been formulating, but afterwards, on quiet nights such as tonight. He wanted to be able to stop replaying their missteps, their successes, their future goals in his mind, but found that the only way to do so always involved late night wanderings through the castle and grounds. Seeing that tonight was a beautiful, clear night with plenty of stars, he decided to visit the Astronomy Tower to lie down and look at the sky. During nights like this, the Astronomy Tower would turn itself into an open top area, perfect for star gazing.
“Why, Potter, are you scared you will lose your rabid fanbase once word about you being with me is out?”
Harry was glad for that.
He also noticed that Malfoy no longer slicked his hair back, and had grown it longer this year. The white-blond tresses were longer in the front and shorter at the back, and Harry thought he looked like those stylish wizards he’d seen on the cover of those fashion magazines on display at Flourish and Blotts.
“I haven’t really let myself think ahead that far, Malfoy. Right now, I just want to survive… and hopefully not be a giant disappointment.”
Draco was evading all of Harry’s attempts to see him. He was ignoring Harry’s glances in the hall, ignoring his letters, ignoring his calls for him in the hallway (resulting in weird looks from Ron, Hermione and his classmates), and Harry was already sick to his stomach.
“Yes, Potter, we must.” Draco said. “I think I deserve an explanation as to why you abandoned me.”
“Hermione, how are you and Ron? Is Professor Dumbledore okay?”
After the incident, Harry spent the whole evening trying to clear his head by taking his Nimbus for a spin around the training ground. After a shower and several attempts at eating his dinner, Harry donned his Invisibility Cloak and left Gryffindor Tower, heading towards the Slytherin common room in the dungeons.
