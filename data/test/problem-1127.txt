They played a few games, but as the fire began to burn lower and lower, Draco began to lose focus, mind drifting.
He edged around it, slowly, until the glass finally caught his reflection- and there he was, his reflection-self, holding the talon wand, clearly about to lose control. Then another figure entered the scene- sandy blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and he wrapped his hands around mirror-Draco's, tilting his head to say something soothing. Mirror-Draco calmed, mollified, and the wand's shadows receded- and then he turned to Mirror-Theo, and pressed his lips to his. Draco stumbled back, horrified. Theo rescuing him from the talon wand. Theo giving him stability, an anchor- the exact opposite of what he'd done in the blue loop. Theo as his greatest desire. There was no denying it now.
Draco spent much of his Christmas holidays at home with Narcissa, decorating the tree together by hand with her as Christmas neared, and their house full of fairylights and decorations, walking out in the gardens with her. At some point, he asked about his father, if his portrait had spoken to her, and she couldn't answer beyond a small, shaky smile, a dart of a glance away. They had a drink in front of the fireplace as he told her about his life at school (excluding many details), everything he could think of, answered all of her questions.
Malfoy’s whistle quietened. With a tap of his wand, a charmed piece of parchment floated towards Harry. It landed on his desk, innocent and unassuming, but Harry still handled it like it was a bomb.
Chest tightening, Draco laid the letter down on his bureau carefully, promising to read the rest of it later.
Harry runs one hand across the gentle rise and fall of his back, tentative, until they're around his waist, clutching at him. It takes time before his body relaxes under him, until his muscles stop quivering, but when it does, it's incredible and warm. Draco's torso is rising and falling against his rapidly racing heart, his breaths a clear, steady current in his ears and against his skin, something calmed and contented under his skin and flesh. He closes his eyes and breathes him in, shallow and shuddering and unsteady.
Here, Harry was less robotic, but wholly morose. Draco then read about the Triwizard Tournament from his perspective
Since term began, Harry was becoming aware of – well, he wasn’t quite sure yet what it was.
He knew he'd been careful. No one would have seen or heard him mention the colours Harry had left behind, or how his own wand looked almost bronzed when compared to the grey, dankness of everything surrounding it.
And it hit him then, the realisation that he could not see colour in anything, that his world was filled with different shades of grey which his uninformed mind had mistaken as bright and life like.
, Harry mouthed the words back, a small smile flickering around it. His fingers traced over from his hairline, over a cheekbone. Harry's fingers moved down to his arm, drew words into his skin that Draco followed the lines of in his mind.
“You killed Harry Potter," he said. The odd cadence of his voice made him sound quietly deranged.
Their fingers entwined as they shared the small piece of air between them.
Then another realisation sank within him; everything had begun to seem dull since
The memory came back to him over and over, but now with new and fresh understandings of that moment. Draco remembered him, a small and still body in Hagrid's arms. He remembered the soul-cutting pain he'd felt, seeing him in that way
He could not stop crying, could not stop repeating the name of the boy that stood at his back, quietly crying too.
“Not really," Draco said, his smile small and sad.
“Well
Pomfrey wrung her hands and Draco had to force himself to hold her gaze and not stare at the boy sitting behind her.
It was beaming compared to everything else in the room – which now looked terribly dull and a little bluish to Draco. It was like Potter’s Defence book in the library all over again, and despite himself, Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away from it.
Then Harry moved towards him. Draco felt a cool brush of his lips against the corner of his mouth. His eyes fluttered shut as a traitorous tear dropped from his lash.
A pale hand encased in a white, rolled up shirt travelled alongside his own arm. Harry closed his eyes against the sensation, his back and chest tingling. It spoke of a knowing and recognition that was bone-deep and ached within him.
"Thank you," Draco said quietly with a nod, his voice cracking. "For everything."
Their lips brushed. They breathed in one another’s air.
Soulmates,
“He carried your wand everywhere too. I’d catch him staring at it...he was never without it.”
So, Draco did. On the gramophone, Draco turned a song up with the last vestiges of his magic, low and muffled at first as she sang,
Many things wanted to break free from his lips then. Some of them always have
that made any mention of what he was seeing all around him. Colour. The prints of Harry's touch.
"Potions test is day after tomorrow, isn't it?" Harry asks with a frown, watching as Draco draws his Eighth Year Potions book out of his satchel, and then leans back against the Slytherin-green settee.
Draco closed the book when he noted how dark it had become. He walked almost blindly towards the warm light of Hogwarts, lost in thought.
His panic caught up with him then, and he blacked out, just as Harry knelt down over him, his soft touch frantic and roaming.
He looked at Potter again, terrified that the past few months of jeers, shoves, hexes, spittle, and strikes showed in his features. He was terrified Potter could see it.
there was so much I needed to say... I never got to
A drip on the floor caught his attention before that dark thing shifted in his peripheral again. And now he knew it was right in front of him, some mere feet away.
With a furrowed brow, Draco saw the door slowly form. He hadn’t asked for it nor had he paced from side-to-side thrice whilst mumbling his request. He breathed shakily as he turned the door handle. It opened into a moderate-sized room, furnished in deep reds, with soft patterned carpets, a roaring fire, and an overstuffed armchair.
A mild ache had started down in Draco's chest, persisting through all of his classes. By afternoon, it had grown into a steady throb, an occasional spike of pain shooting through his sternum and making him wince sharply. Goyle noticed as they walked back to the dorm and asked him if he was alright.
"Keep it." Draco took her hand and clasped it around the snitch. "You see, I already have a gift from him…"
They sleep together for the first time, and Harry clings to him with all of himself. He kisses and touches and mouths at his body as much as he wants to because it's all high and heat and he knows what to do here, how to make it good. He wonders if Draco can feel it now, how starved he is for him, for the way his nimble hands slide up into his hair, the arm clinging back to him around his shoulders under his underarms, the way his body feels against the flesh of his arms, the heat and softness of him, and the way his torso jounces rapidly against his own, his short, hitched breaths and gasps muffled into the hollow of Harry's neck.
Harry is a little too distracted by the profile of him, his book held up in his hands, leaning against Harry to let him see, and how close he is, and how much closer he could be.
His mother stared at him, and visibly something withered inside her.
“I – I…Yes," Draco garbled out. Then the clock on the wall ticked for a few beats before Draco could speak around the lump in his throat. “Are you real?”
"Today, we will be brewing Icarus’ Ruin, a potion which – as its name implies – is a particularly
The light in the Quidditch locker room was buttery yellow. The light from the early morning sun made the steam from the shower seem hazy, unreal.
As he played with the new cuts and bruises on his arms, courtesy of some uppity sixth and seventh years, Draco pondered his options for the future. As soon as the thought crept up on him, he wished it hadn’t.
Draco was in the library, listening to Goyle’s soft snores as he flicked through page after page idly. He wondered to himself what the point of any of this was. All that Hogwarts had taught him this past month was that people were as unforgiving as they were hypocritical.
“Granger – I –
Draco's breath shuttered and his jaw worked to set against a tremor on his lips, tightening. He stared right back, his gaze hollow.
"I can't," Draco said, barely a whisper. Panic was his heart fluttering about in his sternum, a bird gone wild, trying to free itself. Fear and despair was a thick vine wrapping itself tight around his gut, around his lungs, making it hard to breathe.  "I can't just — it'll all go away. He'll go away if I — "
"It's not that…" It comes out too quiet and raspy. He clears his throat, forcing his voice to be stronger. "I don't
So, when Draco felt and heard a light set of footsteps climb up this rather disused tower, he was instantly on his guard.
Draco’s mind then seemed to grasp the seriousness of his circumstances and then ran wild. Had he been cursed? Hexed? He tried to think back to the last thing he ate and then realised he hadn’t in quite some time. Did he drink one too many Calming Draughts? Draco hadn’t thought so
He had felt that strange, inexplicably intense pull between them, that rise of a sense at the back of his neck whenever Harry was near, in the same room, all without having to look at him.
Draco moved forward slowly, partiallt because of the pain he was in, and partially because he was a little awed to finally be here, near it. Thousands of little hours were spent fantasising about the small space in front of Draco now, but the touch and feel of the sheets under his fingers made it no more real to him, he found. Some of his fantasies was dirty, sordid, but others were childlike, innocent. Either were nothing he could admit to, but frequently felt humiliated for entertaining. Draco would have fevered dreams and then wonder about how warm Harry would feel in his arms, how the heat of his palm would feel around Draco’s.
second year. Both came to me with symptoms much like your own. I would hear them whispering to themselves in the dark. They’d always be distracted, watching something out of the corner of their eye. They’d murmur a person’s name, over and over. All the while, their magic was draining
“...Tiredness?” he offered, trying not to look as if he is hiding something from a very keen-eyed witch.
On another day, Harry finally gains the courage to do something else that he's been thinking about doing for ages.
The thought made the grin slide off him, and the pain in his chest spike.
Harry touched his hand. Draco looked up at him, standing over him. He held up his hand for him, smiling.
Harry ran ahead of him, laughing silently as he led Draco to a door, one that had thousands of golden-brown handprints on it, blazing brightly around the handle, and at the door’s base where Harry had clearly kicked the thing open.
It was a shrine of sorts. Hundreds of small notes and pictures of Harry with others had been stuck to the locker door and the floor directly beneath it. There was a palpable protection charm encasing it, as if many had been layered upon each other to keep the items safe from prying hands and the humid air in the showers.
Draco nodded haltingly as flashes of a roaring crowd and a tumbling ball of red and gold came to mind. Her smile was just as gentle as her words then too. She looked down at it, holding it aloft from him to stare at it too. The gold was awfully bright, and Draco felt something catch in his throat.
“Ah – there it is, Lovegood,” Draco whispered into the air.
Draco closed his eyes against the thick, black shame that curdled in his gut. Turning away from her, he stumbled to his own rooms.
Harry likes sex, and he'd gotten good at it with her too. He knew what she liked, where she liked his hands best and how she liked his mouth on her, but he thinks part of it had always been to get to all the other things, like clinging to her body and feeling her all over him, like sliding his hands up her arms and taking her hands in his own, like the feel of her hands in his hair encouraging him to keep going when he went down on her.
Draco turned it three times in his other hand, to Harry's guiding gestures, and then–
She then unholstered her wand and made a quelling motion before pointing at his stomach, which Draco had protected with his wand arm.
Narcissa flinched, her eyes darting upstairs to where his father’s study was above them. Her eyes clouded for a moment when she remembered; Lucius’ keen ears and constant shadow wasn’t there to dog them anymore. Draco missed it, and thought it was strange what grief could make you wish for again.
“Still here?” Lisander Greets, a seventh year Hufflepuff sneered.
when the light finally stopped stabbing his eyelids. If Draco were so inclined, he might have kissed her feet.
Burns went lame, and was then jerked away from Draco. The air rushed in, and it was painful, unwanted.
He smiled when he watched a depiction of what Potter thought would happen if Draco ever confronted a werewolf – namely him pissing himself before running away in tears. The numbers 394 were littered around the margins of it. This tickled something in Draco's mind, but he couldn’t remember anything specific.
Harry stays still and quiet, but it's in an entirely different way this time.
One day, it stops being little more than an odd schoolboy crush, and it becomes something that keeps Harry's eyes locked on Draco whenever he passes, makes him stop with a quiet smile and pivot around on the balls of his feet to gaze after him, watching him as he walks down towards the end of the corridor, gesturing and talking with Pansy and Blaise.
All the while something vital had shifted loose inside of Draco and fallen away from him, seeing Potter’s body slumped to the ground. The image still replayed itself in his mind’s eye. Again, and again, and again.
“Merlin, you’re a Wizard, Goyle, use your fucking wand,” Draco sneered.
“We could get breakfast—" The man tried.
He then followed them, tracing them as a pup would his own tail
"You didn't take your eyes off of him the whole time until he disappeared down the corner."
Draco holds his hand, and when he releases it to push a hand through his own hair, continuing on to gesture in the midst of telling his story, he doesn't return it to hold his again the way he usually does.
So, if Draco messed up a few steps, he didn’t notice it. He was about to throw a handful of hellebore into the mixture before a freezing sensation shocked him and sent a fissure of panic chasing down his spine.
Here, Harry’s writing was noticeably more legible, as if he’d taken great care with the words written. Most of it was drivel, the day-to-day woes of a frustrated, hormonal teen boy.
all of them kick-offs and landings from Quidditch. He trailed them back up to the castle whilst completely dismissing his wheezing.
“Brilliantly deduced," Draco said waspishly, trying to hide from the burning light.
"I can’t, it’s... not really – I mean, you’re his soulmate, Malfoy and..."
"Will you, er—" he manages. His heart is pounding really fast. "Do you... do you want to do that again tonight?"
Harry handed him a picture, and Draco took it with an amused, confused smile. In it, there was a stick figure drawing of a boy with brown hair, glasses and a thick lightning bolt scar, holding hands with a stick figure sporting a mop of bright yellow hair.
Then Harry's lips were on Draco’s, desperate, wanting, and terrible. Draco murmured a chant of
“Not much to live for," Draco found himself saying, almost absently. “Not anymore.” He was staring at where their hands were meeting, heated and trembling.
“Apart from the head pain and the bleeding, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?” Then after a pause, she added, “Anything unusual?”
took him away from me, just like he did with everything else.” Draco gestured to the room around him.
"Harry?"
He was there with his hands feather-light at Draco's back during a wracking cough that had him rolling over, trembling, ribs seized tight to the point of hurting. He was there with his hands breezing through his hair when he woke up in the middle of the night, nauseated and aching in his joints, Harry's frown over him. He was there laying in front of him on the bed, face close, looking somewhere afar and lost in thoughts. Sometimes he was just watching Draco, with a brush over his hand, his green eyes sometimes slightly wide, and sometimes only tender, almost melancholic.
Harry was now stirring the potion carefully, counting to forty-five carefully and grumplily. But then there was whistling coming from behind him.
"What’s it like to die?" The words came out paper-thin, frail.
Draco's head recoils, nose scrunched. "You really could use someone better for security." He pauses. "Then again, they're using portraits for safeguarding, so what do you expect?"
“Good morning, Mother. I’m sorry to say that whatever it is might have to wait. You see, I’m feeling poorly and—”
Harry sang to him in his dreams.
There's Molly, who's always hugging him whenever he comes over, casually brushing a hand over his hair, touching his shoulder and back, kissing his head, and he thinks she does it more often to him because he's the only one that doesn't recoil away from her or roll his eyes, the only one that's still not really too used to it. Even after Fred, even in her grief, she has loved him the same. He hadn't known what mothers were like until her, and sometimes he tries to put his mum's face to these moments and imagine her doing the same too.
"No," he answered truthfully, trying to sound polite.
Everything went on sluggishly around him, his friends moving like silken bathwater around a cold knee. His eyes struggled to focus, as if a gauze had settled over his eyes and made everything hazy, poorly defined.
"I can
‘"Piss off, Granger."
Draco remembered a slightly older reflection of Harry, staring at him helplessly as Draco bled out surrounded by animate books, and inanimate onlookers. There was sadness as Potter stared at the cut and then back to Draco’s bewildered, too-wide eyes.
"Are you–" Draco's mouth had gone dry, his voice coming too faint and small. "Are you real?"
Draco’s mind was flooded with memories from his third year upon seeing it. It brought a quick smile to his lips. The book felt warm in his hand, and an odd sensation prickled under his skin. It must have been a spare left by one of the students. Draco had found out that the library, somewhat sentient, had a ‘finders-keepers’ policy with misplaced books. Some unlucky sod had also received the same lesson.
Draco did sort of pause at the foot of the boy’s dormitory steps; he simply stared at the footprints carved there. They were a silvery golden, the stone lit in the morning sun almost dazzling him in comparison to the spaces in between that seemed almost
Harry stood abruptly and ran out of the class.
To his left, in the roots of a gnarled, rotted tree, his eyes caught on something that glinted in what little sunlight snuck through the canopy.
Harry stills. He is so still that he's hardly breathing and maybe Draco notices, as he's leaning his face in towards his own, and he pauses. "May I kiss you?"
Harry.
“I’d forgotten how you sounded.” Draco stated, and tears pricked behind his eyes. “I couldn’t hear it in my head anymore.” His voice trembled. "After all those years of listening to it, and it faded so quickly.” Draco swallowed against the jarred breaths in his chest. “And the rest are trying to forget you
Potter held his gaze and slowly shook his head. Not nothing – something. Something you don’t deserve.
Draco gestured for Harry to stop, but he kept moving. If it were possible, Draco could have sworn Harry had become paler then.
"I’m so dead," he whined with a croak.
He stared at it, entranced by how bright it was. Its colours shone in the dark because Harry had touched it. Draco reached out as if to take it, as if possessed, but before he touched it, he snatched his hand back. If he touched it, he would never let it go.
"Like in a good way."
Harry laid him down, very gently, and then laid down beside him himself, arms around him, forehead against his.
Harry shifts his weight on his feet, uncomfortable.
some more serious than others. Some rare
Draco could have died and the world would have looked at his carcass, poked at it a bit, before turning away disgusted. His body wouldn’t have even cooled before they had said
When they settled down, they were still smiling at one another, and Harry was watching them with a wide grin.
Now, Draco had his wish. In the worst possible way, it had been granted.
Harry, it seemed, could do nothing either, except watch with a somewhat horrified expression. Draco’s rather unhelpful mind offered that the experience was somewhat lacking a certain
"I didn't catch that," he told him. "Can you repeat–?"
By the time he had found an appropriate alleyway to Apparate from, somewhat limping up the few flights from the Manor’s foyer to his room, Draco felt the first foreboding waves of hangover-induced nausea.
He wanted to hide away, preferably deep under his covers so that he might never have to leave them again. Draco thought he might get his wish until a figure at the end of the hallway came into view.
He walked up to them, to where the prints almost pointed like an arrow. Standing in front of the pale red doors, he squinted to read the names written. Following the footprints further led him to a set of lockers hidden in shadow.
Lovegood extended an arm out, as if she wanted to touch and soothe Draco’s decidedly stressed features.
And chagrined, he heard that laugh again, one that made his insides curl and tense into a pile of knots.
“Why the fuck are you still here?!”
Half-way through Transfiguration, he dropped his quill, gripped his head, and he couldn't move at all. The pain was taut all throughout his head, behind his eyes, down his face and jaw. It
“I found it in the Forest... opened.” Granger’s features shuttered as Draco’s stomach dropped. Everyone knew that Harry had walked alone into the Forbidden Forest, believed that he hadn’t survived the trip.
There was a tightness in Harry’s expression that Draco wanted to smooth away, with his hands, fingers, or lips. He told himself that it might happen soon, even if Harry didn’t seem so sure.
Draco turned, bouncing on the balls of his feet slightly. The pain potion invigorated him and gave him the sensation of being lighter than air all at the same time.
No, that's not you. You'll betray and crawl and murder to protect your own. You're only against our fathers because the people you've chosen are Gryffindors. We may all be your friends, but at some point, you decided they were worth more."
happened- when Luna was kidnapped, when Sirius Black-"
"I don't know what I am," Theo said, eyes heavy as they bore into Draco, "But I do know... the way you make me feel- Draco, you're so beautiful. I can never get over how beautiful you are..."
"I'll explain it so he'll understand, although I think it'll take him longer to accept it. He confessed last night, too."
" explained Draco. "It's harsh, unforgiving, fanatical." Fanatical was certainly correct- in her eyes, the Dark Lord could do no wrong.
“You didn’t get hurt, right?” Harry asked, turning to face him, and Draco felt his heart swell with affection for his caring boyfriend.
Harry gave a short laugh and a small nudge, enjoying how his lithe frame swayed slightly at the sudden push. “They’re great, Draco,” Harry complimented. “It must have been pretty complicated.”
Harry contemplated how he should try to wake Draco up this time. He’s yet to resort to using a bucket of water, if only because he knew that the blond would probably make him clean it up, thereby making them more late.
“You can’t reject me,” the short man grunted, taking a threatening step towards whoever that was on the ground. “I’m paying you. If only the wizarding world could see how you’ve fallen from grace.”
“We were close to kissing,” Harry mumbled shyly, his skin suddenly heating at the memory of that night. Hermione gave him an excited smile, but then he spoke. “But wouldn’t I be a bad friend for asking Draco out when I know Neville likes him?”
“Okay wait,” Harry said, getting up after changing his mind. Who knows when Draco would actually make it back, and safely at that. “I’ll come with you instead.”
“Next time?” Draco repeated, his eyes widening a bit.
“Nothing, nothing,” Harry smiled, placing a kiss on his forehead. “Let me handle it next time, yeah?”
Harry tried not to feel resentful at the fact that they were forced to get up earlier than normal to witness the sorting of the exchange students’ sorting. At the same time, though, he was a bit excited to see if anyone would be sorted into Gryffindor in their year.
Shoving thoughts of how he thought Draco Malfoy looked good when he was happier, he watched as the blond held his closed fist up for all of his onlookers to set their attention to.“I don’t get it,” Blaise Zabini sighed, and Harry was inclined to agree. “Is something supposed to ha-”
“No,” Draco said desperately. “No just- you can keep going.”
“Yes, fine, bring if you must,” Hermione sighed, not that excited at the prospect of creating drunken teenagers in the party. Activity. Whatever. “It will get them to loosen up a bit, but this isn’t a party so pace yourselves.”
He walked down the familiar hallway, stopping by the kitchen to drop off their cinnamon buns and coffees on the kitchen counter, before heading into the master bedroom of the flat.
“But it’s different,” Harry could hear the pout in his tone. “I kind of want to see what’s inside, too.”
“Okay?”
That’s another thing Harry had to get used to since all this inter-house unity bollocks. Since Malfoy was technically friends with Hermione now, he had given himself the liberty of coming through a Gryffindor-filled room just to talk to her. Not that Harry minded. It just meant he got to see his rather attractive face more often.
No, he tried to be optimistic. It couldn’t be Draco he was planning to ask out. They were alone so often before and Neville’s never made a move, so there was no reason to suddenly start now.
Harry could only nod, heart dropping more and more as the conversation continued, but he should listen. It’s been a while since someone lectured him on the risks of playing the game. That person being Hermione, of course.
“Do you think you’ll be signing up to partner with one of them?” Ron leaned over the table and asked Harry.
“Alright, tell me what you’re up to,” Harry started, trying to ignore the fact that their faces were just inches apart.
The lights dimmed before there was a timer spelled into the air, right in the middle of the stage. It began counting off from 60, with some people counting down out loud with it as everyone waited for the clock to strike 12, welcoming them into the New Year.
“Have you guys seen Harry?”
“Okay, great. Follow me.”
“So you’re going out with Neville, then?” He asked, trying not to sound toi bitter.
“What’s wr-” Harry looked at him worriedly until Draco gave him a reassuring smile, cutting him off. He tried to remember what he saw from those videos he watched on the laptop Harry bought him before sliding down the length of his boyfriend’s body until his face was aligned with Harry’s crotch.
“He’s really smart,” she began, settling herself onto one of the pillows comfortably before looking at him accusingly. “He’s yet to call me a nerd, and doesn’t ask what I’m talking about every few seconds.”
“That’s good enough,” she said, smiling gratefully at him.
“Yeah, well you don’t have nerve damage you-” The blond instantly cut himself off, eyes widening in realization at what he was just about to reveal about himself. “Nevermind. Can we please just go somewhere warmer?”
Harry let out a huff of laughter.”Then maybe you should be the one to fix me up every morning,” he said.
“I don’t want to go,” Harry groaned into his pillow. “I don’t want to socialize and you can’t make me.”
Harry gave his friends what he was hoping looked like a reassuring smile before nodding. “It’s fine. I’ve never had a problem with besting Ma-Draco before,” he shrugged.
“It’s not my fault you make it so easy,” Draco gave him a small smirk.
“But it’s your house. Imagine what your grandmother would say when she finds out about your negligent hosting-”
“I love you too, Harry. But what’s wrong?”
“Sure you do,” Harry snorted, placing a kiss on top of his head. When Draco looked up at him through the hair that had fallen over his forehead, Harry took that opportunity to lean down and press a long, sweet kiss on Draco’s lips.
“Hey, love,” Harry whispered, bringing his face just inches before Draco’s. His hand began spreading the lube between the crease of his arse, cold against the night air. “Don’t be nervous now. I told you I’d take care of you; make you feel good.”
“Why would he be skittish around me?” Harry asked, confused, but he was also pulling himself up.
“Must you be so crass?” Draco huffed once he saw that she had stopped talking, a wide smirk plastered on her face.
“But how will I study?” Hermione suddenly asked.
“Nope,” Draco said, slightly pouting into his drink. “I’ll never hear the end of it if I do. Besides, I won’t be seeing her until January if I skip out.”
Hell, even their travelling capes seemed to move gracefully. The girls wore their silk-blue dresses, hats, with their capes while the males wore a silk blue button-up with a darker waistcoat and a matching tie and trousers and their hats and travelling capes.
“Oh,” Harry tried not to sound too disappointed once again. It was the first day of their final year. They still had a long way to go. “Goodnight, then. And good luck with the firsties.”
He momentarily wondered if any of the neighbors could hear him and cursed silently, scanning the area before casting numerous unlocking charms on the door. It took a while, but he managed eventually, silently thanking Hermione for all the wisdom in the world.
The Hall erupted in cheers, mostly coming from the students. Harry knew, at least for himself, that he was glad to get a sense of normalcy for once in his life and experience a regular school year without fearing for his life.
“This wouldn’t have happened if you just set an alarm,” Harry managed to gasp out, still slightly breathless from having to heave Draco out of bed, and also the fact that he couldn’t believe he just manhandled
“Not exactly,” Harry snorted. “I’m pretty sure she was serious about the ignoring you part, though, so you might want to think of a
"Oh my, they’ve heard us quarrel, darling,” he sighed dramatically, covering half of his face in faux embarrassment. “We do sincerely apologize, we’re normally much better than this.”
“What about it?” Harry asked, feeling a bit anxious.
“Slytherin colors?” Harry raised his eyebrow. “Whatever pleases you, Draco.”
Sofia’s shoulders relaxed a bit, recognizing his friendly voice. “Yeah, I’ll explain later,” she smiled, before turning back to glare at Ron and Harry.
And Draco called him the crazy, impulsive one.
Because you’ve fallen for him. Hard. His bran supplied.
“Well, now you just look ridiculous,” Parkinson sighed, looking around wearily to check if anyone else was watching the spectacle that was Draco Malfoy.
“Draco?” Harry called out, looking for his partner. “You’re bloody late for work! Where are you?”
Harry stared at the retreating figure, his mouth agape.
____________________________
Harry watched as Draco and Neville laughed merrily, unaware of the death-glares Harry was sending their way as they made their way down to the greenhouse, as per usual. It wasn’t that Harry hated either of them- not any more- but rather, he wished that he were there in Neville’s place instead, laughing with Draco and being on the receiving end of all his bright smiles.
“You know…” she said before trailing off. Harry gave her a look that he hoped would encourage her to continue. “Sorry, right. I was just thinking that I’m most likely going to find him before breakfast since we agreed it would be easier to meet by their housing, so why don’t you just come with me?”
watching his coworker sleep is considerably creepy, and
Instead, he tipped his head back and let it rest lightly against the flat of Draco’s stomach, looking him in the eye. His gray eyes, unfortunately, did not look back, seeing as they were much more focused on the task at hand, the fingers massaging his head not even pausing at the movement.
His dancing wasn’t horrible, Draco supposed, before bursting out into loud laughter, along with their friends.
“Whatever. I’m sure we can find a reason to leave whenever he’s around, right?” Ron asked, elbowing him lightly while giving him a sidelong glance.
“You do realize that you were invited too, right?” Draco asked, still not getting up from his spot. Harry was well aware that he was invited too, of course.
“I’m so glad that I get to go into the new year with you,” Harry sighed, smiling against Draco’s neck.
Unsure of what to do next, Harry was rather grateful when Narcissa came up to talk to them.
from what Draco just said. “It was awful.”
“I love you too.”
And to further the nightmare that was unfolding before him, Harry began dancing. He swayed his hips in time with the music and danced around the house elves who were wearing little elf hats and costumes.
“Maybe you ought to have thrown yourself in and spared me, because we were so close that night,” Harry retorted childishly. His friends didn’t know exactly how close they were to kissing, but Harry didn’t feel like mentioning it yet.
“Why is it funny?” Ron demanded, but the girl paid his question no mind. She was beginning to remind Harry a bit of Luna except… French.
Suddenly, the tip of his tongue peeked through his lips, licking over the sensitive bud. Draco arched his back, leaning into the sensation, but Harry had other things in mind. He sucked over the sensitive skin, his tongue lapping over it again, before grazing his teeth against it.
He was promptly shushed by Malfoy’s wave of a hand. “Just give me a second to finish the process.” Then, while keeping his fist still closed, he pressed a finger to his chin for another 5 seconds, still keeping his head held high as if what he was doing was so spectacular.
His fingers trembled. He considered putting it back where he found it.
"Apologies," he garbled as his thoughts continued running frantically.
“So are you,” Harry said. “But you are forgetting to live, Draco."
Draco looked at the stone and then to Harry, who subtly shook his head.
In one, they were softly swaying to a song, one about a woman singing wistfully about rainbows and bluebirds. Draco had his head in the crook of Harry’s neck, listening to his soft humming, his strong heartbeat, and his gentle breathing in Draco’s ear.
Draco stares at him. "Right now?"
He nodded at Lovegood, resigned to the fact she’d either hurt him or heal him. He was past caring then.
But he was functioning enough. He was going to his classes, though focus was a constant battle when his body was a warzone. He was meeting his friends, going out with them on the better days and staying in with them on the less better days, and it was easier to listen than it was to keep up a conversation, but Luna and Goyle didn't seem to mind that much, besides the worried looks they would cast his way sometimes.
He caught Pomfrey following his gaze, her expression tense with concern.
Draco drifted in and out, to the daylight casting on Harry's face there, or his mother gently shaking him awake, casting spells on him, dripping potion on his lips. Nutritional spells. Pain-killer potions. Calming draughts. Sometimes it would be in the noon, or afternoon, or evening — he couldn't always tell. His mother would often be at his side.
Which didn’t make any sense, because it was Draco Malfoy – a boy who he so thoroughly disliked it made his teeth ache. Or, at least, that was what he liked to convince himself of anyway.
Draco felt more than heard a small sob from Harry as he slowly curled up into Draco’s arms, his head now resting atop his stomach. He felt arms curl around his waist as another shaky breath sounded, muffled by Draco’s arm.
She halted him.
Draco lost it a little then.
“Very often, people who are grieving are reminded that those who have passed away wouldn’t want to see them suffer," Harry said as his thumb rubbed against the inside of Draco’s wrist.
"Oh," Harry says, and then looks chagrined.
The sensation on both Draco’s wrist and cheek grew steadfast, as did the shaking of Potter’s head.
Draco had hidden himself away on a crooked, spindling staircase in a branched-off tower of the Owlery. He sat in the wandlit alcove,  from where he stared at a sliver of big, bright skies, rolling hills, and a blanket of dark trees. He wished that he could run into it all from this height and become lost in it. If he could somehow be suspended forever and then become a vapour, he’d take it over the miserable grey study in
There was no answer.
Draco stopped. His voice had begun to shake, his sorrow trapped in his chest.
Then, something brushed against his cheek.
, and he could only sit there in his seat, on the verge of tears as he gasped and choked through the pain. Somebody was talking, a hand on his shoulder, gently pulling at him, and the class had gone utterly silent.
“I don’t think gratitude is a symptom, Ma’am," Draco said through clenched teeth and a now sweaty brow.
There was darkness too; the insidious feelings Harry described when Weasley dismissed him as a cheat was surprising, and juxtaposed what Draco knew of him thus far. Harry’s frustration and elation in the tournament, and everything in between. It struck how insane it was that Harry was put forward at all
When he looked back at Granger, she had followed his line of sight and was now staring at the spot where Harry stood.
And now, Draco looked up to the overhead racks where he could now see a shoelace floating mid-air, unattached to anything. He shook his head violently, trying to shift the notion of
"I love you too," Harry mumbled back into his shoulder, held him carefully and close like he was precious. "I've been wanting to say that for so long." His voice croaked.
it. They had wrapped around its syllable many,
The whirls of the winds rustled Draco's hair and clothes, the leaves on the branches above his head. They carried a familiar, bright laughter amidst its whistle to his ears, echoing back in memory from across Great Halls and classrooms. Draco frowned, his head cocking, blinking in bemusement.  His eyes traversed around for the source, but it wasn't found.
Draco’s thumb rolled over those last words.
"Draco, darling, you aren't making any sense—"
Draco opened it quickly, mindlessly, before smoothing his palm over it in reverence.
and cheered him on as he heaved himself up the steps. Sir Galahad even galloped alongside him on his white horse. He was cursing his ineptitude when he tripped on his hanging robes as he tried to bolt past the Great Hall doors.
a child thrown into a proverbial lion's den.
The last thing he felt was a cool kiss at his feverish temples, and he hoped it was
He had already left the room, donning his coat, and was hastily making his way to the door as the man attempted to plead.
"That you are soulmates," Granger said simply, looking right at him.
It was Harry’s. It was Harry’s mark upon him, bright and blazing where the Dark Lord’s mark was sickly and swallowed light.
Harry said, getting right into Draco’s eyeline, with nought but an inch between them.
“Well, it seems that you are back with us," she stated in a clipped tone, each harsh consonant grating on Draco’s molars.
be for him. Not when everyone would hate him for it, not when Potter
Looking at Draco Malfoy, one will never assume he's much for such sentimental displays. Harry certainly didn't. There is nothing tender about him, after all, what with how he generally seems cold and callous and unapproachable in his resting state, all smirks and snark and snide remarks. Anyone putting unwanted hands on his prim and pristine self are met with an icy glare, a cocked and haughty eyebrow, until they retreat from him.
Footfalls sounded behind him after a short while, calm and quiet. Like they had known where Harry would end up. They stopped right behind him before Harry felt a warmth as his back and heard the rustle of clothes, the sound of slow breathing.
“I’d rather they didn’t mourn at all – I didn’t live to cause tears,” Harry said in a playful tone, as if Draco was in on a secret joke.
To distract himself, Draco spent most of his time in the library, trying to find information on what it was that he was experiencing. No matter which book he looked at concerning hallucinations, ghosts, souls and magical deaths, Draco could find
In the background, their song played on, that they would have always danced to in a life that went differently, and he listened to Harry whisper
“Here and now? Oh, most definitely," Luna agreed happily, snapping Draco from the rabbit hole his thoughts were tripping down into, the sober glint to her eyes returning momentarily. “But we must respect the order of things. Everyone hates spoilers.”
The witch snorted. “Perhaps not...if it came under the purview of ‘normal, typical behaviour.’”
Harry then attempted to take Draco’s hands, before visibly growing frustrated that he couldn’t. Draco humoured him and held up his arms, which Harry’s transparent hands brushed through. It caused Draco to shiver a little when he felt the coolness of Harry’s touch deep in his forearms.
him," Draco went on, frantic. "Right now, I can see him. I can know more about him with this. I
Draco would feel a tingle between his shoulder blades before he saw Harry.
Pomfrey seemed to understand what he was asking and looked at him with an awful amount of pity.
Harry startled, his face pensive. But he flickered a smile, and it was terrible, like he was only trying to for him.
away from him like some frolicking field nymph, leaving Draco the kind of confused that normally necessitated a large knock to the head.
At breakfast he found himself staring at a blond mop of hair. In classes, he’d try and fail to tear his eyes away from a back donned in Slytherin robes. At dinner he’d try to ignore the rich sounding voice, which always seemed to cut through the babble of his schoolmates. Then, at night in the privacy of his own bed, he’d close his eyes to fantastical thoughts all about a boy with grey eyes, one who Harry often found staring right back at him.
finally written in Harry’s spiky handwriting. It was clearly written in a rush, and from the marks on the letter, it was written right here on the forest floor.
He put the chain back down the front of his nightshirt, the cold of the stone making his skin prickle. Blood dripped down over it, like sand in an hourglass.
One day, Harry gathers up all the courage he's mustered over weeks, of quietly reaching for Draco's hand and then always withdrawing it at the last second, and just finally, finally takes it.
“Fifth year...fifth year...Ah! Here.” Draco settled in with a poured cup of tea and toed his shoes off.
Draco's mouth falls into an 'o', his eyebrows twitching upward. His face does something odd, a multitude of emotions that Harry can't quite read well. He thinks Draco might say no. He wonders if he's been reading it all wrong.
rang through his head as he stumbled on the landing between floors four and three. The portraits
all pretending they haven’t just lost you, that you haven’t died. It’s bloody awful and I fucking hate it.
Draco moved to stand, to follow the set of footsteps that seemed to walk out from under the chair he was sitting in. But as he rose, pain spiked through his chest, like a sharp pick on ice. However, this time it did not cease. In fact, it built until Draco’s vision was pulsing with it.
Outside the window, Draco watched the rolling hills pass him. It was later in the evening now and the outside was drowned in warm blues and blackish green. Even though it was so heavily muted, the view now made his gut squeeze a little. The grass banks running along the tracks captured all of his attention. They were bathed in the warm gold from the train lights and seemed to dance in his gaze.
"Harry Potter — he handed it to me. When I asked him about you, before I lied to the Dark Lord about his death. I believe — I did not understand why he'd given me this, but…" She cleared his throat, lips pursed for composure, glanced at him. She gently placed it on his palm. "I've realised now that it was for you. I believe he wanted me to give it to you."
since it was against everything he knew – his parents, his beliefs, his community, his
it only made sense now, why his grief had reverberated down to the deepest core of him, why he had felt the hollow in his soul, like it'd been cut in half, vanished somewhere along with Harry. He was only feeling it come back now, having Harry with him here.
Draco didn’t want to be treated; he didn’t want Pomfrey’s duty-bound interference. He would keep Harry, for as long as possible, even if it meant he’d have to die to do so. Harry was shaking his head slowly, Draco couldn’t make out the words that were spilling from Harry’s lips.
‘Fascinating, isn’t it? What survives complete devastation…’
there were loads in the distance that seemed to begin without origin and abruptly stop.
He must have felt Draco's weight, falling fully onto him, because Harry drew back then and stroked his face softly like he couldn't stop touching him.
Harry was then looking down at Draco’s arms, his left one specifically. Draco shivered when he felt Harry's hand slowly encase the very same forearm Draco hadn’t deigned to look at for months now, lest he attempt to slice it off.
He stared at Harry, whose eyes were wide and unblinking. “I don’t need to die to know how that feels," Draco said slowly. “Because you see...I have already lost something.”
It's something that has Harry thinking that he may be the most beautiful boy he's ever seen.
There was a long pause, and Draco swallowed, trying not to cry. "I swear it," he said roughly. "I will."
"The reason you won't see your boyfriend, even though he's
"In a way. I- I'm afraid I'm becoming more like her."
"Don't presume to comment on Harry," hissed Draco, drawing the talon wand. "Don't."
"I can't say I've ever witnessed anything like that," replied Blaise, quietly. "And I hope I never do."
"Since my father went on a sake kick recently," Theo laughed, and conjured them glasses. "He had this whole tasting just for me at Easter. See, it's best taken hot, especially if it's this refined... what are you doing?"
"Anyone could." His friend put the cards down and peered at him myopically, as if more of Draco’s secrets would emerge the harder he stared. "Is everything okay?"
Draco woke the next morning with an awful hangover and, unfortunately, a perfectly clear memory of yesterday's events. Sev's clock declared it high noon- he'd be at lunch, now. Electing to postpone the awkward conversations he'd have to have, Draco turned away from the dungeons and the Slytherin common room, making straight for Ravenclaw Tower. He waited outside until he caught Luna returning from lunch, in hopes that she would quell the clawing feeling in his chest.
Theo blinked rapidly, swaying slightly, he was still so drunk. He did not look heartbroken, just still perplexed at the turn the world had taken for him, in this Slytherin-colored light over bleak unpolished stone. "You don't... you're saying you don't like me back?" he said again. "Draco, I... I know it took me a while to figure out. But I know what I want now. I..." He licked his lips, eyes going darker. He leaned closer to Draco, something more devilish in his eyes. "You don't know the things I would do, if you wanted me to..."
"He's not my-" issued the usual refrain, and then "Oh, whatever. Yes, Blaise, you've got it in one."
everything! I'm not just looking for
"That's not what I mean." She was unusually serious. "You don't take him seriously. He's like-" She waved her hands, as if pulling words from the air.
Unheeding, Theo forged on. "He can't even wipe his arse without you around, he's naught but useless baggage- for Merlin's sake, Draco, you don't even
The reply arrived quickly, in less than half a day.
"I- I-" He didn't want to tell her the whole truth right now, burden her with his fear and guilt so close to the OWLs. But he had to say something, anything. "Am I a bad person, Striker? D'you think enough Gryffindor has rubbed off on me, by now- so I can fight for what's right-"
"Maybe you need a Slytherin approach."
"You agreed- we were doing what was best-"
"You don't understand!" shrieked Draco, close to tears. "You haven't seen it, so you don't understand how- how destructive it is, how fanatical and violent and it's as much a form of hatred, at that intensity- and you're claiming to have it! You, Harry Potter! No, you aren't even capable of it, you're a Gryffindor, you'd never cross your ideals, never-"
"Please," Theo said softly, "You're the most regal person I've ever met," and stroked his fingers over the exposed skin of Draco's arm. It gave Draco the creeps, since below the small faded white scar was the exact place where his Dark Mark had used to be. He hadn't seen the skull and snake there since the fake Moody had made him draw it on himself under Imperius, and for years then before that. But he could still imagine it there clear as day, especially since the feeling of Theo's hands on it hadn't been unfamiliar. Theo had hated the Mark, and tried not to look at it when they were together, but had been kind enough sometimes to put cream on it when it ached.
"Dobby knows a way to help," he continued. "Follow Dobby."
"Please," she scoffed. "You'd get straight Os in your sleep. You're miserable, and for whatever reason, won't talk to your pet lions. Kingsnakes are here for one another, captain."
"Dobby is happy," he replied. "Dobby would love to have tea!"
"Is that what you want?" His face twisted into anger. "You want me to give up my ideals?"
"Then you have to accept that as a part of you. We're all a multiplicity. Remember when I stopped talking to Ron over the broomstick? It's completely against your philosophy to throw a friend over for something like rule-breaking. But it's also part of the reason I couldn't join the Death Eaters, were I born a pureblood."
Draco was a little more at ease after receiving Sirius & Remus' reply, but he wished it had been more specific. He still had no idea what to do. He knew it was his own fault, given how vague he'd been in his letter, but he couldn't bring himself to put quill to paper again. So he made for his godfather's rooms, clutching a bag of croissants.
"Not exactly," Draco hedged. "Hermione and Ron, they're my friends. I'm sure of it. But- but the reason I avoided my housemates, for so long... maybe. And Harry, I- I'm not sure."
"No," he insisted, almost immediately, earnest eyes filled with melancholy. "I meant it, about my- my feelings, but I shouldn't have said a word about Potter- or tried to kiss you, I'm so sorry-"
it falls short of truth-"
And Severus did, taking the situation in hand. He seemed to sit and talk with Theo far longer than needed to just fix his eyes, but their conversation was muffled magically, and Draco fell asleep long before Theo left.
"Firstly, Miss Granger is absolutely, objectively correct. Secondly, I admit I do not approve in the slightest of your infatuation with Potter- but my reasons for that are neither so dire nor so genuinely concerning. The views Mr. Nott shared- do you believe they’re correct?"
"I'm sorry, Theo," Draco said with a chest leaden with guilt. "I'm sorry I don't feel the same way. I'm sorry if I ever led you on. I..." Severus could clearly still hear, with the expression on his face unspeakably pained.
Blaise shuddered theatrically. "I doubt it, Grindelwald. For all that moniker implies, I genuinely don't believe you're very similar to Bellatrix Lestrange."
I don't know where you got that idea-" And since he'd been yelling, Draco let loose and yelled back.
"You're not
He was slow enough for Draco to push him back, rather gently. Theo's eyes flew back open. He looked genuinely confused, like the possibility of rejection had never been in his calculations. "Draco, do you not like me back? You've always made all these jokes, ever since we were little- before we were at school... even back before second year, Blaise said he thought out of all of us for you, it would be me- and I'm the only one you ever flirt with-"
"Grindelwald," Theo laughed, swaying as he stood up. "Draco, I was- was going to wait for you, but it looked so good- here, I've saved this just for us..."
After what Luna said, Draco began to avoid Harry like the plague, an echo of the year he'd been termed the Heir of Slytherin. He caught Harry's worried glances across the Great Hall, but it felt awful, immoral somehow, to lose himself in kissing Harry when he was implicitly questioning Harry's ability to determine what was best for him.
"I shouldn't have said those things about you, or your- boyfriend. Or- whatever Potter is to you. It is Potter, isn't it? The one that you... I just- I hate that you want him and not me. It just feels... Merlin, I'm so drunk..."
"Theo, no, it's not that. There's nothing... nothing wrong with you." Draco rubbed a hand over his face as he felt the sake belatedly starting to kick in. He didn't feel anywhere close to throwing-up drunk, so he couldn't be that blitzed. But he felt hazy too, like the blue loop was threatening to encroach into the red line, the wants and disillusionments of the past trying to once again become his illusions. "It's not an issue with you, I promise. It's me, alright? Please don't take it personally. Boys, girls, whoever you want, Theo, you're gorgeous, you're rich and smart, you're athletic and talented and you're a really sweet person- you've got everything in the world going for you, so just try and move on, you'll have plenty of options-"
Theo screamed, grabbing at his blinded eyes. Draco was reminded with a pang of grim satisfaction of the sight of the Basilisk in Harry's memories, though he almost missed the streams of red coming down from those eyes.
Then Severus' arms enveloped him, in a welcome surprise, and he let himself cry into his godfather's chest.
"That's your advantage. You've no relatives other than your father in England, nobody you care about- so use the Fidelius,
"You're all my bloody friends-"
. There was a knock on the outside of his curtains, and he opened them to reveal Theo, wearing a concerned expression. "I understand if you don't want to speak to me," he began quietly. "But I still want to be your friend, Draco, even if you don't have feelings for me.” Draco stared up at him, more overwhelmed than anything, remembering the comfort of that familiar sandy-blonde in bed next to him. “Are you okay?"
Hermione cornered him in the library, unsurprisingly, and dragged him off to talk, despite neglecting her own OWL study. "What's going on, Frankenstein?" she demanded. "Why are you avoiding Harry
"Uncle Sev?" he asked, edging into the room without his usual grace. "Are you busy?"
"Theo, I- let's talk about the Kingsnakes another time,
"I'm sorry, I'm fucking it all up-"
There must have been wards to alert of magic in the storerooms, if not already the presence of someone this late. Draco tried in vain to think of an explanation that wouldn't out Theo, but-
The day before the wedding, Draco puts on Theo's lovely birthday gift, a black-opal necklace with enchantments. He prefers white, generally, but the dark color reminds him of his godfather. "Theo," he begins. "You gave me this opal to keep me safe, right?"
less?"
"This is between us," Draco snapped. "Don't talk about Harry."
"I can't say I've ever thought about it."
Hermione was in his dorm the next day, courtesy of Theo. "You looked awful," he said. "And your cousin declared it a job for Granger, when I tried to bring her here."
"Thank you," replied Draco, gaze fixed on the edge of the mirror.
Draco curled his fist around the talon wand, fury rising again. "Really," he hissed, "do you really, Theo? You don't even know if you're
"Someone pointed out to me that I'm not like you, or Harry, or Ron- I'm never fighting for ideals, I only fight to defend the people I love. If I'd never become friends with you, I'd be closer to the Kingsnakes, fighting with the Death Eaters, and- where would I be then, Striker?
"Oh, Draco..."
"You weren't here!" he shouted, rage building. "Where were you when
"So whatever happens, keep your father away from the Dark Lord. At any cost, Theo.
"Uncle Sev, he- he agreed, that I likely would, and apparently, so did the Mirror of Erised. It's, it's breaking my heart-" and the quiet sobs from last night chose that moment to reappear. Draco hid his face in Hermione's shoulder, shaking, surrounded by a curtain of bushy hair. "I just want Harry, more than anything-"
"You don't tell him things, though. Like our Naufragiam plan, from last year- you didn't tell him about that."
he's different, everyone else is too- and the closer they are to him, the more likely that is. So he can't stick to the blue line as law. It's more like a- a prophecy, one of many possible threads- and the Theo thread, that may not even exist as a possibility anymore, given how different Draco was now.
"Nothing happened," he sighed, a refrain he was tired of repeating. "We drank. We argued. Sev caught us. That's it."
Draco knew it wasn't fair to blame red line Theo for blue line Theo not being there, but that didn't stop the emotional certainty that Theodore Nott would betray him, again. "I'm with Harry," he said, instead of the thousand other responses that sprung to mind. "Keep your life."
"It's all right."
"So you're a Gryffindor?" asked Theo, eyes blazing. "You'd sacrifice in pursuit of an
there's no other way, as much as he wants there to be one, as much as he just wishes he was
"I care about
She snorted. "'Course I do! You're closer to them, there's no denying it."
Because if he goes, you're next, and I don't want that to happen."
"Do me a favor and don't mention this to anyone."
"Theo, I didn't mean..." Draco took Theo's hand to try and be empathic, but Theo took that as more heated than he meant it, taking Draco's hand and giving it a soft kiss, blue eyes brimming with feeling over it. Draco shivered at the unexpected wetness of Theo's sake-scented lips. "Theo, no, I'm sorry, I can't return your feelings. I didn't mean to lead you on. I'm really sorry."
" cautions Draco, remembering his own actions in the blue line. "Right now. And if you don't get out soon, you'll never be able to. Soon meaning, tomorrow. Aunt Bella is coming for me, and she’ll probably have the Death Eaters behind her."
I- I'm not good enough for you."
"There's a reason I helped you research the wand," he murmured. "A reason I returned Astaroth to you. It's taken me some time to realize, but I do love you."
make your father the secret-keeper."
Draco lost track of time all too easily there on the floor in the green-tinted shadows with Theo, with the comfort of someone he'd known since before he could walk, combined with Theo's naturally quiet, easygoing personality and his added graciousness while drunk, heaping compliments on Draco in every avenue he seemed able to think of. It was only when he began to wax poetic about Draco's hair and how well the style suited him that Draco experienced a flash of misgiving, though not enough to not finish yet another cup of the hot sake. He had enough of a buzz to make reality seem a step or two away or slowed, a pleasant haziness to the world that made his alarm as muted as anything else unpleasant in the world. He hadn't gotten quite this drunk since the blue loop, when he'd come home in the aftermath of the Wizengamot's judgment. That time couldn't seem further away, even as he and Theo drifted into reminiscing about times in the blue line.
Theo's eyes narrow, and he settles in, defensive. "Yes."
"Then what's the bloody problem?"
"Oh, don't worry," Theo said, dark blue eyes bright, with the taste of fine sake muting the grassy smell of potions herbs behind them. "And I definitely won't tell him it was absinthe in the punch... though I'm not having symptoms of that. I think Montague got ripped off..."
"Nonsense." Severus put down his grading and beckoned Draco to the familiar chairs by the fire, and they both sat down. Then he crossed his arms expectantly. "Well?"
No, Theo. I know exactly what you would do. "I'm sorry, Theo. No."
Grindelwald. Spend time with the Gryffindors, if it makes you happy. We'll always be your first friends, won't we? And, well-" She shrugged. "It's moronic to keep a mental accounting of how much time you spend where. Do what makes you happy."
"What," Theo breathed, eyes almost black in the green light. He pushed the cask away from between them to lean over him, unusual vindictiveness leaping to his drunken face. "And Potter does? Harry Potter loves you?" When Draco was silent, Theo was the one to begin to laugh, a strikingly miserable sound. "I knew it already. I was almost sure. Now it's a certainty, you're with Potter, aren't you? I'm too late, that's the real problem, I waited too long to figure it out, and now you've talked yourself into thinking you'll have some happily-ever-after with that empty-headed-"
"He'll never understand you, not really. You're delusional, you'll always be Astaroth, Grindelwald, skulking about in shadow like Hecate- you're
"Please, please don't overthink it. It's nothing but my point of view."
"Isn't it?"
"Next time," replied Draco, sporting the type of grin that only emerged when he flew- but it froze on his face when he spotted Harry making his way towards them. "Oh, fuck- Ron-"
"No, Dobby thinks not," interjects the elf. "You is simply having a difficult time- and you is not knowing what you wants."
"I'd never let that happen," he insisted, green eyes bright. "I'd never treat you that way."
Theo loved him now, was it? Was that just bullshit to get him in bed? Because what had changed? He hadn't been good enough for Theo before. And this was a Draco who didn't even want him! Was it playing Quidditch together, for fuck's sake? Was it that Draco was more powerful? That Theo couldn't have him as easily? Draco knew it was the sins of the blue loop in his head, not this younger Theo ignorant of Draco's real resentments, but he couldn't believe it still.
I won't risk your sanity- that kind of devotion harms the receiver as much as the giver, if not more. At least the giver lives in ignorant bliss."
you're going to sleep with me a few times, and then push me away." The loop's enforced Langlock didn't let him say what he meant, drunk or not, but it was close enough, a catharsis of sorts from a pain that never left. "You barely even manage to support me- don't think I forgot that you walked right off the pitch with the others at my first Quidditch trials as captain-"
When Harry peered over his shoulder, he realized that the inside of his trunk was expanded and, even worse, the many cabinets it came with were also expanded. He figured that yeah, it would take a while, he might as well take a seat.
“We’ll have to see how the date goes, first.”
“I have,” Harry nodded, agreeing. He was beginning to wonder why Neville wasn’t just getting on with it, but it could have been that he was plotting his long, painful death. Either way, Harry braced himself for when his friend opened his mouth again.
“Don’t,” his boyfriend murmured before kissing him deeply, swiping his thumb over some spit that had caught below his lip. “If you keep going, this might be over too soon.
“Truth or Dare!” Justin Finch-Fletchy screamed. There were cheers in response, which could probably be attributed to the tipsy students, but people agreed nonetheless.
“For a game!” Harry exclaimed, slightly exasperated but mostly tired and sad.
Draco had to blink to himself a few times before looking back down, seeing the laces undone. He couldn’t even bring himself to face Harry like this. Instead, he carefully pulled the joggers off, realizing that Harry hadn’t worn pants underneath them.
Pulling away from their kiss, Harry trailed his lips lower, pressing small kisses down from his jaw to his neck nipping and licking at the skin as he did so. He continued downward until his mouth was pressed against the nipple that wasn’t currently being teased by his other hand.
How fitting.
“Say that again,” he murmured, his voice sounding deeper and scratchy.
“Pizza,” was Harry’s cheeky reply, and Draco just knew he was about to say- “A pizza you.”
So for their first games night, they ended up playing charades. How they were supposed to get to know each other like this, he had no idea. Hermione had chosen it, though, along with Ernie Macmillan, the other person in charge of inter-house unity. Apparently, they wanted them to be comfortable around each other first.
“Oh honestly,” Hermione sighed. “The wedding is going to start soon Harry, get dressed.”
Harry was among the first few to arrive in the common room since he left when the first years did and walked pretty fast to keep up with Draco’s hurried pace. He figured he could sleep early and wake up early as well, since Hermione would most likely be up with a lot of time before breakfast.
It’s not that Harry had explicitly said that he wanted to have sex with Draco tonight, but he knew. Their past few nights spent at one another’s flats were enough to see how Harry was slowly building his way towards it, becoming more and more confident and bold in how he touched Draco when they snogged.
“What do you mean unrelated?” Draco scoffed, heart fluttering a bit as Harry took hold of his hand again, bringing it up to his face and giving it a quick kiss before settling it in between his palm and cheek, leaning on it for support. “You can’t tell me that costume wasn’t part of your grand entrance.”
“I take offense to that,” was Harry’s response, engaging in playful banter with his children.
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. If you're interested, I also post short fics on my
“There was nothing to give,” Malfoy shrugged, only increasing Harry’s confusion further. As if sensing it, the blond continued. “I was disowned before the trials. Around the same time I let you escape from the Manor and my family went through my brain with a Legilimency.”
“Sure,” Harry responded, attempting to return the smile he was given. It was a weak smile, but it was enough for his best mate.
Sadly, it seems that the fates had it out for him that day, because Hermione arrived with Ron in tow, loading their bags and hopping in.
“Not much,” Neville said, “You’ve been hanging around Draco all day, though,” Neville pointed out, giving him a rather skeptical look.
They probably deserved it, anyhow.
Harry observed him pull some people aside and have hushed conversations with them, though. It looked serious, so he decided against interrupting him.
“Honestly, Ron,” Harry sighed, sounding frighteningly like Hermione. “Do you really want to avoid Hermione for months over this?”
“Since we’ll be living together, call me Harry,” the man grinned, holding his hand out for the other to take. Malfoy stared at his hand like it were some foreign object for a few seconds before grasping it firmly. Malfoy immediately added that he could call him by his given name as well.
Right as the clock struck 12, Harry pulled Draco in for a kiss, as did the other couples around them. The only difference is that they didn’t separate after a few seconds, choosing to ignore everyone’s stares and whoops before pulling away for air.
“Mate, just go down there and offer to help them out,” Ron sighed, tired of watching Harry sulk as they rebuilt a pillar.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, his eyebrows furrowed, when Draco readjusted his sitting position.
“Why?” Draco glared sullenly, looking like he was on the verge of falling back to sleep. Harry was overcome with the strangest need to smooth out his hair and kiss his pout away. “Just why?”
Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to find a free seat next to Draco, not that he’d really want to since he and Hermione were seated right up front, which left him to sit next to Dean. Ron was still glaring holes by the time he walked in, but he pointedly ignored it.
“I have no doubt of that,” Harry grinned cheekily.
Harry entered his office alone for the fifth time that week.
Draco’s eyes widened slowly in a way that was almost comical. In fact, Harry would have laughed if he weren’t already silently planning his funeral. Perhaps Hermione would be willing to obliviate him.
“Hermione!” Harry called out to her when he saw she was just about to step out of the portrait. “Wait up!”
“I should probably go then,” Harry mumbled, forcing himself up and extracting himself from the warm bed. It was nice and comfortable, and he regretted leaving it already.
“Tsk,” Harry smirked, placing a kiss on the spot between his thigh and his bollocks. “Patience, love. I’m just making sure that you’re nice and stretched for when I fuck you.”
“I’m tired,” Draco grumbled and, while of course he was, this time Harry understood. They had stayed up until early hours of the morning to wrap up an investigation. All that was left to do was plan for the raid which would be taken care of by a larger team, which meant they were finished.
Is this what causes aneurysms?
“Okay,” Neville said, turning to face Harry once they entered an empty classroom.
Without even bothering to knock anymore, because Draco never had and probably never will hear him when he does, he barged in and took a seat at the foot of the bed.
“Yeah, essentially,” Neville smiled guiltily. “Since you know most of the people in our year because of the DA, I was hoping you could spread the word?”
Since he left his shoes at the entrance, he figured that he’d be fine. Slowly, so that the bed didn’t rustle too much, he climbed on until he was standing, practically towering, over his fellow Auror.
“Wait, you don’t want to do this anymore?” Panic began flooding in again, even though Draco knew he was probably being irrational.
“Draco! We’re going to be late!”
Except the cons seemed to outweigh the pros once he realized that
“Alright,” she laughed, ruffling his hair. “Go. I’m going to need energy if I’m going to make up for the lectures I missed.”
"Don't give me that," Theo sighed. "You really think anyone is as good as you? Anyone?" His hand slid over Draco's thigh. "I always thought it would be you and me if I could just be brave enough- and I'm telling you I love you-"
"Luna-Luna!" he cried, taking her hand. "I was bored, and I thought, who better to see than my favorite cousin-"
Draco to end things with Harry or risk insanity, risk losing himself the same way Bellatrix did. It'd be a risk he was willing to take, but for the potential effects on Harry- he wouldn't want him to be the focus of Draco's insanity, tied by his innate goodness to a raving madman for the rest of his life.
"No," she declared. "You can't look to me as your moral arbiter. You have to look within yourself. If the Slytherins were the only people you loved, and you fought for their lives, would you think of yourself as evil?"
Severus exhaled in soft exasperation, having to listen to this conversation while treating his two foolish drunken students, so Draco leaned in to let a blind Theo whisper to him. "I shouldn't have said any of that, I'm sorry... I just... I'm in love with you, Draco, I can't help it..."
"Look, my father-" Theo shifts uncomfortably. "He's been a Death Eater all his life. I don't want to take that away from him."
Theo barked out a louder laugh, leaning back and pulling into himself. "Fine, then, let's talk about you, Draco.” Draco shifted on his cushion. Instinct called for him to back away, but there was nowhere to go, not in this tiny storeroom, and he tried not to show his apprehension. “You've let your Potter have a chance to confess, no doubt, with that vaunted Gryffindor sincerity. Kingsnakes or not, you don't see us Slytherins the way you do them- and, fair enough. You've spent nearly all your time with them."
"I don't like this," she fretted. "I wish you'd tell me who. But, Draco, as I said, you're no Gryffindor, and I wouldn't want you to be. There's no ideal that could come between us, as friends, and that's more valuable than you know. If you were fighting with the Death Eaters for your Slytherin friends, even if you didn't give a fig about the ideals, I- I'd think you were evil. I'd call you evil."
Theo's bed is empty when he leaves for the wedding the next morning.
and it's not his fault, he's so bloody good and kind and virtuous, and I'll never live up to that, I can't even try, I'm a murderer, I-" He paused, inner Hermione finally shouting loudly enough at him.
He sighed, closing his Charms text. It'd been a long afternoon of memorizing all the trivia he'd forgotten since his first OWLs, and Draco was ready to sit in front of the fire and let his mind go blank- so he did exactly that. Blaise joined him, some time later, bearing a pack of exploding snap cards.
"I- that's not it-"
Clearly alarmed, Ron held onto Draco's shoulders. "Breathe, okay," he said. "In, out, in, out. I'll tell him to go, just- calm down, all right?"
"End it," cautioned Severus, dark eyes swirling with concern. "You must, Draco."
"She loves
"You'll just have to choose. A few more years of tarnished glory for him, if even that, or
And for the sake of all that is holy,
Sev was right, Draco knew he was right, he and Hermione and Luna were all right while Draco himself had been utterly blind. He clenched his fists tight and squeezed his eyes shut, wanting nothing more than to disappear. "Yes," he whispered reverently, almost a hiss. "Yes, I would fall at his feet if he asked- I'd do anything- kill anyone-"
"Of course! Draco, I'd never-"
The writing changed, then, from Remus' tidy penmanship to Sirius' looping scrawl.
"Good luck." And there was a pop as the elf disapparated.
Avoiding the Gryffindors meant that Draco's free time was spent entirely in Slytherin, now. To their credit, it only took the Kingsnakes a few days to adapt to the change, and they shifted slightly to include Draco in their day-to-day. It was still a little awkward, but he was abjectly grateful for their quiet acceptance.
She frowned. "Did Luna say this?"
Draco, the
"I value you, you know, I do. All of you who stepped up to help me with the team, even though- even though I haven't been as present, here, as I should have been."
Draco didn't realize how on edge he'd been until he was lying down with his head in Luna's lap, listening to her commentary on Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. She noticed the shift in his mood, trailing fingers through his hair, and frowned. "What's wrong, Draco? The Nargles only go away when you talk to someone about it."
Draco took another sip of the sake, trying to drown him out. The words rang uncomfortably true. He hadn't enough power or cunning to protect
"You needn't answer me, Draco, but I highly recommend you do. If you truly feel you could be following in Bellatrix's footsteps, I implore you-
He took a break, then. The letter was painfully raw, vulnerable, and he could barely stand to look at it. He wanted to rip it up into a thousand pieces, but at the same time, he wanted to send it- he wanted their reassurance, he wanted to run away- his thoughts were cacophonic, chasing one another in his head, and he sighed, pressing his fingers to his temples. He'd send it. If nothing else, his current state implied he'd want someone else to help him make decisions. Signing his name at the bottom, Draco made for the owlery.
"Do you remember the first time," Theo said absently, sometime after Draco checked his watch and saw it was past two am, "The first time I ever came to Malfoy Manor? We were, like, four or something, maybe less... I don't know if it's too early for you to remember, but I do..."
Frankenstein," he breathed. "You've got it all backwards- I've been obsessed with you for years-"
"Do whatever you have to," replies Draco grimly. "For your life, and for his."
Theo obeyed, sitting politely on the very end of the bed and clasping his hands in his lap. Draco shut the curtains with a spell, making their conversation private. "The things you said to me- in the storeroom-" Theo's expression didn't change, but he pressed his lips together so hard they went white. "Was it all true? Did you mean it?"
"You know why."
in the blue line, not even himself, but he'd wanted to, desperately. He reached into his pocket, pawing about the comforting bend of the talon wand. Could he have made more of a difference in the red line, had he focused on his blue line friends? Could he have helped them? Why had he chosen the Gryffindors over his childhood playmates, to the point where he'd barely reached out until being made Quidditch captain- he was far too drunk for this. He pressed his palms to his face, trying to tamp down the dizziness.
The red line wasn't an echo of the blue line. The red line was overwriting it, day by day, and since he'd chosen the active route the very day he'd touched the talon wand, he'd have to take this new reality day by day, too. Not that he considered his information valueless, but- a butterfly flaps its wings, and there's a tornado halfway around the world.
"Am I supposed to say thank you?" Draco said, unexpected acid coming to his voice.
I'd never want that! I like you exactly how you are!"
"Yes."
"Knut for your thoughts?" asked Blaise, reshuffling. "We should have played for money, I keep winning."
so young, it- listen. Voldemort has no use for an aging wizard, except to recruit you into his ranks. And you don't
When they landed, they were laughing, as usual, still high from the chase. "Of course you caught the bloody snitch," Ron grumbled good-naturedly. "Should've insisted on a keepers' duel."
"You did nothing wrong," replied Draco, mouth dry. "Nothing. You're perfect."
"I wouldn't have loved him if he didn't."
"It's all right," came the reply. "If I lived your life, I'd say crazy things all the time." The redhead offered him a hand up, and Draco took it and stood.
"OWL season?" he offered weakly.
"Will you?"
"Do you remember the first thing I ever said to you?" Draco smirked, and Theo nodded.
the Gryffindors, like you're just an evil person enjoying a few stolen moments before they catch you. Granger must see it too, she's not stupid."
He was loath to admit anything to the boy who'd thrown him into such chaos, but he wanted an explanation. "Come in," he said. "Sit on the end."
"I'm not ready, I can't-"
Draco started from the beginning, then, and told Severus every detail, from his first kiss with Harry, to his night drinking with Theo, to everything he'd discussed with his friends (other than the more vulnerable parts of Sirius' and Remus' letter). By the end of it, his godfather was shocked.
"I'm sorry," Theo was the one to say first.
"Is that what you're thinking about?"
"Fuck, Ron, I don't know what I'm saying."
Draco approached the Mirror of Erised carefully, still from the side. The mirror of desire, back to haunt him after his failed attempt at destroying it. It'd showed him Harry, last time, and he didn't want to face it again, not ever. But here he was, and he was going to.
"Do you truly see Potter as someone without agency? Has Miss Lovegood hit the nail on the head?"
Draco acquiesced, and they picked their way through quiet hallways until Dobby let him into a room. "Feels free to comes back to kitchens when you is done," he said. "If you wants. Dobby will be sleeping, but if you call, Dobby will come."
"Likely not in full," replied Draco. "But- but they rang true, in some ways."
"Draco," Severus said, "Wait in the other room. I will set up another bed, and you will stay here tonight, to sleep off your disgraceful inebriation. I will assist Mr. Nott before escorting him back to his dorm."
to be a Death Eater, Theo, you want to write books."
"What would you have me do, when the mark burns? Petrify him? Stun him?"
And, of course, Draco
What prompted this?"
that's how the talon wand's made you-"
"I ignored it, when she was saying it to me, but now- now it's stuck in my mind."
"No, you're not!" she exclaimed. "You just see yourself as more capable. But you're empathetic, cousin, you wouldn't do anything if you didn't care."
Was it fair for him to judge Theo on his blue-loop actions? He'd judged the Gryffindors, chosen them as his companions on the same, but they'd come out of the blue loop smelling like roses. He'd judged Severus on the same, and made him more of a father figure than Lucius Malfoy. But his mother- he hadn't judged her on all the actions she'd taken in the blue loop. She'd stood by as Father hit him, and yes, that was unconscionable, but she'd also lied to the Dark Lord to save him. She loved him, in some form. He hadn't acknowledged Pansy's own form of bravery in the blue loop, that she told an entire castle of people to hand Harry Potter over, to save her own life. So he was, in truth, being selective. Slytherin. All his psychological manipulations, all the ways in which he lied to himself served to cover up a simple truth. What he'd seen in Erised initially, Harry Potter, the reason he gravitated towards the Gryffindors- he was a Slytherin. And he wanted to pick the winning side.
Theo. Figure it out," Draco demands, "or the Dark Lord will do it for you."
"Luna, you make me sound so self-centered."
"No," Theo said, biting his lip. "Not unless you... Salazar, Draco, if you only knew... I'm trying to tell you- you have this effect on me. So much it throws everything I thought I knew into flux, Draco, it makes chaos out of order... it makes all my conviction into doubt... I'm not sure of anything anymore except for you. I know I like you. I like you so much-"
