They gave each other a quick peck before Remus departed and Sirius sent his Patronus to Kingsley, informing him of the suspicious behaviour.
“Thank you, Professor.” They both smiled warmly. He felt infinitely better knowing that he would be under McGonagall’s wing, he trusted her over any other teacher.
“Dad?” said Draco’s muffled voice. “Are you okay? You looked like you had just seen a Boggart or something!”
Sirius seemed to be debating punishment of his godson, probably putting the whole thing in perspective, excusing him because of his hideous upbringing seemed like it would be fair. But Snape beat him to it.
Draco started to scan the Prophet as his dads read the letter, but stopped immediately at the photograph on the front and the accompanying headline. It was picture of Lucius Malfoy, holding a plaque with his name and number on it, above it was written:
Remus nodded. “That sounds great. What do you say, Draco?” he looked down at his son and ruffled his hair affectionately.
Remus hastily dissected the young boy’s expression. He didn’t seem distressed, or hateful of the name. “Yes. Peter Pettigrew.”
The trio didn’t stay very long, knowing that their friend needed to sleep off his eventful night, but their visit left a golden ball of hope in Remus’s chest. Life wasn’t all bad, not so long as he had his friends in his life.
After that, Sirius opened up his gifts. From Draco, a CD of his favourite Muggle punk band and from Remus, a new bottle of his favourite cologne. The look in his eye suggested that this wasn’t the only present Moony would be giving him, but Draco turned away in silent disgust before he could know for sure. Sirius had gotten Harry a book of photographs of himself, Harry’s father, Moony and a small, stout man Draco had never seen before. Remus told the boys that the man was no longer their friend because he turned out to be a follower of Voldemort, so Sirius had made a rather funny show of defacing the mystery man each picture that included him with moustaches and stupid hats. Harry had thanked Sirius profusely and promised that he would start writing to them himself once he got back to Hogwarts.
Harry shook his head, “I think you’re being overly generous there, but ok. If it makes you feel better. Draco?”
“And there is the fanboy meltdown I had been waiting for. Yes, we’re flying together. Hence the flying clothes I told you to wear, twit. You look nice, by the way. Appropriately dressed, as you no doubt would
Harry had forgotten how good Draco looked in the air. He was decidedly more athletic than anyone with such a sedentary profession had any right to be. To make matters worse, they ended up playing a chaser’s match (easier with two aside) and Draco paired with Davidson, aka God’s gift to Quidditch chasers the world over. Pitted against two dyed-in-the-wool seekers, one of whom was getting on a bit, team Draco was doing quite well and Harry was starting to regret his decision to fly an older model broom. Surely the distraction of Draco’s arse in fitting quidditch breeches and short flying robes would have been handicap enough.
The plan was for the professionals to take Draco through a basic level training. Nothing so advanced as to give Harry tips (he was the opposition after all) but complex enough to be challenging for an amateur enthusiast. Afterwards they would play a two-against-two friendly. Harry was flying Sirius’s Firebolt, which was a good ten years behind the broom Draco was using, in order to even things up just a tad.
Draco laughed. Harry fiddled with Draco’s belt buckle and fly, then his own. “This is ok, right?” Harry whispered, stroking the bulge of Draco’s erection through his pants.
Draco smiled, honey slow, then kissed Harry quickly, full on the mouth. “Shirtsleeves and slacks would be brilliant,” he said.
Harry laughed and continued, enjoying the hot, dense-velvet silky smoothness of Draco’s erection. The way it grew and twitched under his touch, while Draco made small keening noises of pleasure, hips bucking against Harry’s grip. Harry muttered his favourite wandless wanking charm, it made his palm slick with lube and also slightly altered sensation – now when he gripped Draco’s cock it would feel like his hand was fully enveloping it with warm, slippery heat. He shifted on his elbow, carefully placed the flat of his tongue over the head of Draco’s cock, covering his teeth with his top lip, and sucked, sliding his charmed hand up Draco’s shaft from the base to the tip.
“Thank you for telling me all this,” said Harry, “I appreciate you being honest with me, it means a lot. Sorry I spoiled the mood before. You know. While we were getting it on.”
“No!” said Draco. He swallowed, “Lord, no… Harry. I want to. I mean, if you would like to… with me… it would, it would be a privil… what I’m trying to say is that I would be honoured and I want to. Whole-heartedly, without reservation.”
Draco’s tone was teasing, yet Harry still had to swallow back a knee jerk snarky reaction in defence of his friend. Draco was just being a dick, it wasn’t personal. Draco really liked Hermione — he had agreed to go on a charity date for W.A.P. and write it up for
Harry laughed, then came round the table and knelt in front of Draco cupping his face in his hands and kissing him. “I don’t know. I hear you’re a sex god. You might have better offers.”
“Understood.” Harry tongued right up the ridge under Draco’s cock. Draco made an undignified squeal-grunty noise.
“We can shower, if you like,” Draco offered. He was running his hands over Harry’s sides, down to the sensitive dip just before the sharp jut of his hips. Harry shivered.
Without underwear it was painfully apparent that Harry was not properly hard. Harry glanced up at Draco, he had seen.
“You lads have fun.” She gave them a wiggly fingered wave and a look that included a shit-eating grin and lewd eyebrows, before heading to the changing rooms on the opposite end of the pitch.
“Oh,” Draco’s voice sounded slightly strangled, his face flushing. He blinked for a moment while it returned to a more subdued colour. “Yes, you can touch me while we’re naked, if you would like. That sounds quite appealing, actually.”
They towelled themselves off and Draco went to fetch tea and biscuits. Harry sat in the living room checking out Draco’s flat, now he wasn’t heavily preoccupied with more pressing matters. The place was light and airy. There were framed ink sketches on the walls and dried flowers on the windowsill. The colour scheme featured lots of dove-grey, storm-purples, and natural oak timber. It was completely different from how Harry would have pictured Draco’s living space, but undeniably him all the same.
“Yeah, tea might be nice, now you mention it.” Draco gave Harry a wet smile, his face was blotchy, and he had a gob of snot on his chin.
Draco sipped his wine. Harry couldn’t remember what the wine was called, other than that it was some variety of red. Draco had been amusingly invested in it when the bottle had been brought to the table, pouring a tiny bit into his glass before swirling it (not like a regular person, either, he had placed the glass on the table, placed his index and middle fingers either side of the stem and rotated it in a circular motion) before both smelling and ceremonially tasting the beverage, then giving a diatribe on acidity, notes, and something called mouth feel. Harry immediately found a need to become better acquainted with Draco purely so he could get away with doing an over-the-top parody of this act at dinner-parties without permanently annihilating their still fragile friendship. It would be brilliantly effective, especially if performed on non-wine-based beverages, like table water.
“True, but I’ll take it; Never look a compliment in the mouth and all that.” He grinned and handed Harry a menu. “I am sorry about this, by the way. When I agreed to go on a date for W.A.P. I was assuming they would pair me up with someone with whom I had less personal history.”
“Yes. I’m in the process of writing the article. I’ll leave out the extra-curricular dick stroking. Not that it wouldn’t be lucrative, but it’s hardly the done thing to discuss private affairs. Are there any other sensitive topics you would like me to avoid?”
-employed shit that he was – as it would have been nice to have blamed him. But no, the winner of Harry’s ill-judged wager had been one Ron Weasley, jammy bugger. Harry hadn’t even known the bet’s forfeit would be to go on a date, let alone three dates
“Like a film’s soundtrack mixed up together with the dialogue of the film. But better.” Harry enthused. “Because, live performance, Draco! I can’t believe how loud the cast could sing. Was it really not amplified?”
“Well, it is early in the date for pants removal, and you did ask nicely.” Draco batted his eyes, he always flirted when he was wrong-footed or upset in a conversation, it was distracting.
Draco closed the gap between them, and they were kissing. It was good. Good in the way Draco melted into him, warm and willing, their hands and arms and bodies fitting around each on instinct, easy and comfortably thoughtless. Although Harry was worried about being overly spitty, conscious that this was the first time he had kissed Draco and Harry didn’t know what he liked. Harry wanted to deepen the kiss but thought it might be too much. Also, his tailcoat was not designed for ease of making out. Harry kissed Draco once, more firmly, and drew back a fraction, running a thumb along the line of Draco’s jaw.
In the end they didn’t make it to the showers. Once in the dressing room, out of sight of the others, the kissing redoubled, hot and heavy. Draco had both hands on Harry’s lower back, stroking the dimples that sat just above his arse; Harry clutched Draco to him with one arm, carding his other hand up through the hair on the back of Draco’s neck, using this as purchase to deepen the kiss. They were both using so much tongue it was a wonder no gag reflexes had been triggered yet.
Turns out showers can be a bit cramped with two people in them. Not to mention uncomfortable and a little cold. Harry couldn’t have cared less, he got to hold Draco naked and participate in the banal necessities of washing. Soaped backs and shampoo. Washed arseholes – the intimacy of that was breathtakingly hot, even though neither of them was up for another round quite that soon. Harry had no idea his afternoon was going to involve soap and Draco’s arse crack. Draco’s arse crack that he let Harry touch. He was so beautiful and Harry wasn’t sure he would ever recover from the shock or the joy of it.
“Sorry, still don’t really buy it, I’m afraid. Draco, your main reader base is middle-aged witches and forty-year-old mothers who have usually had loads of sex – I know it’s not particularly on-brand for their image, but that doesn’t make it not true. The stakes are so high – your audience are so
Some people were still cheering, other's were sobbing. All she could think of was sleeping until all of this, her entire life, really, was something she could pretend was just a nightmare. Her body ached with the soreness of war and having been on the run for 10 months. Everything felt like it was moving altogether too slow--she wondered briefly why she'd come back.
Malfoy was looking at her, but not like she had three heads. If she had to describe it, the look on his face was almost...empathetic? Like he understood and felt bad, and not in a way that made her feel pitied, but in a way that made her feel like she didn't have to explain or be embarrassed. Her chest was heaving, heart pounding, her skin was almost vibrating from the unreleased magic that threatened to unleash it's defensive fury on a simple car crash. A firm hand on her arm tore her eyes from the wreck. It wasn't until she made eye contact with Malfoy that she noticed his lips moving, that he was telling her to breathe.
Her heart wasn't in it anymore. She was tired of trying to track down the last of the Death Eaters that hadn't answered for their crimes. Tired of following-up on reports of Death Eater copy-cats. Tired of confiscating Dark Magic items. Harriet had done her part for the world in this respect and, frankly, she just didn't want to do it anymore. When she had mentioned it to Ron and Hermione they'd smiled at her softly and wondered if maybe all she needed was a break. Hermione went so far as to say she was working herself too-hard again, and maybe she should try and set up an appointment with the Mind-Healer that had helped her and Ron after the war.
"Let's split up," Ron said suddenly, and Harriet turned to him in shock. He was the best strategist in the department, but splitting up didn't sound at all like a good idea to her. He held up a hand to signal that he wasn't finished, "We stay in sight of one another and move in formation. We'll watch one another's backs from afar, but splitting up might coax them out. Essentially, Harriet, if they see you their first instinct is going to be to attack. Especially if they think they've caught you alone. The moment one of us see's them, we'll call for backup. And if they aren't here, having split will allow us to cover more ground in less time."
“Oh, good.” Harry felt the tension rush out of his shoulders and back. “I’ll just…” he pulled at the cuff of his coat.
“Fuck... yeah, ok. But it’s not how you think; I wasn’t laughing at you being a virgin. It was just a knee jerk reaction. As in, when something emotional surprises you and your brain goes –
Once Draco was still, Harry wiped his mouth, reached for the glass of water on the bedside table, swallowed. Draco looped his arms around Harry’s waist from behind, chin on his shoulder. Harry turned slightly and kissed him.
write-up afterward, not that it was embarrassing to go out with you. You’re a highly acclaimed sex author and a relationship advisor - that makes you a catch. Keep your pants on.”
“I’m not uncomfortable,” said Draco, lightly kissing the nape of Harry’s neck, “by all means, go ahead.”
Draco kissed him, soft and sweet, gentler than before. Harry hummed and kissed back, one hand cupping Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s hand was on Harry’s waist, his thumb stroked smooth arcs back and forth over Harry’s ribs, careful, affectionate. The tenderness of the caress made Harry’s stomach clench and flutter. He ran his hand, flat-palmed, along Draco’s shoulder blade, drawing him closer and deepening the kiss. Draco hummed his approval and responded in kind without attempt at escalation, letting Harry set the pace. As the realisation hit him, Harry’s whole body softened, his chest loosening, skin tingling where Draco had looped his arms loosely around him, hands warm and open on Harry’s lower back. Harry let out a low moan, kissing Draco open mouthed, hot and heavy, present only to the feel of Draco’s lips, the slide and push of tongue on tongue, the murmur and catch of deep panting breaths. Was this what people meant when they talked about being in the moment, Harry wondered? Ironically, the thought brought him back to himself and he emerged from the kiss. Harry nuzzled his head into Draco’s shoulder, they were holding each other close now, chest to chest, which was fortunate as Harry felt unsteady on his feet, knees weak and thighs shaking.
To Harry's dismay, this made Draco worse. Draco had disentangled himself from Harry again and had his head in his hands, rocking, and laughing, and crying simultaneously in huge shaking snotty sobs. Harry didn’t know what to do. He rubbed Draco’s back in slow soothing circles and waited. Harry had found, after the war, that waiting quietly was often the best response to somebody crying. It had been something of a useful revelation, he’d had to use it quite a bit.
“Then, yes. If you’re sure. I think I could manage that. Sex and friendship. With you. That sounds nice.”
cycle. Also, there used to be a belief that extra body weight improved vocal timbre, which was all a load of tosh. But the images of fat sopranos singing Wagner still lingers, more’s the pity.
“Right. So that’s why it’s written in the largest font on the cover then? Also, did you just admit to not taking your own advice, or am I to believe your advertising is misleading?”
Harry was far more nervous than he should have been preparing for the date. They had agreed to meet up again on Saturday and read over Draco’s article, checking that there wasn’t anything in there Harry strongly disagreed with (
Draco moaned, low guttural and needy, closing his eyes and snaking a hand up and around Harry’s back. Harry collapsed beside him, hands ghosting over Draco’s torso, tracing Draco’s chest though his shirt. Draco’s breath stuttered, uneven with arousal. It made Harry’s chest squeeze, his own breath catching then coming back in quick pants. Draco wanted him, his touch, his breath on Draco’s neck. Draco moved his head, giving Harry easy access, and Harry took full advantage, mouthing the thin skin where shoulder met neck, the vibrations of Draco’s moans under his lips. Harry poured himself onto Draco’s lap, Draco adjusting them so their bodies fit better together, hands under Harry’s shirt. Harry’s nose was behind Draco’s ear, still kissing, revelling in the scent of skin, sweat, and cologne. Draco worked more of Harry’s shirt loose from his slacks, hands skating over Harry’s waist to his stomach, down to his fly. Harry froze, heart clenching in his chest in a bad way this time. Draco stopped.
“I haven’t had sex, alright! I’m a virgin. Chaste, pure as the driven snow, all my petals intact, no canker in the bud
. It’s not even fiction. You do understand the concept of fiction and non-fiction, right, Potter? Missed that one in primary school? I can explain it again for you, if by chance you weren’t paying attention in the five years in which it was covered.”
“Oh, Harry,” said Draco with a long-suffering look, “what would you do without me? The synopsis is a summary of the plot. It’s a good idea to read it before the opera starts, so you know what’s going on. You almost still have time now, especially if you read the second half during the interval.”
Harry shrugged, “As in, whenever. It doesn’t have to be now, but I would still like to try things with you. If the offer still stands.”
“Obviously. I also enjoyed them. You write very well – something that astounds me now that I realise how little first-hand experience you have. How on earth did you manage it?”
Draco laughed; this was not what Harry had been expecting. Not that it was a cruel laugh – not a ‘Potter you are an imbecile and I don’t know why I put up with it’ making fun sort of sound. Draco’s laugh was high pitched, hysterical. The kind of laugh you might use when caught out doing something ridiculous and highly embarrassing. A ‘fuck me, I am so overwhelmed with emotion I have to laugh because I’m probably going to be crying in a minute’ kind of thing. Harry was perplexed.
“Harry. You’re wearing white tie,” said Draco by way of a greeting. Draco looked shocked, and delighted, and some other emotion Harry couldn’t quite place. Covetous, perhaps? Harry blinked for a moment, before registering what Draco had said. He peered down at his bowtie: it was a bit tricky to see, on account of being around his neck and under his chin.
For the entire first scene of the first act, apparently, which was likely to be of some significant duration. Had Harry been on his own, he would have risked it. He suspected opera was not going to be his cup of tea at all and missing one scene of bad music would be no great loss. However, there was a very real possibility Draco would wait for him and also be locked out, and the idea of spending 20-30 minutes of sitting alone with Draco berating him would be unbearable. Not to mention that the git would definitely include it in his magazine write up AND bring it up every time he saw Harry for approximately the next eighty years, at the bare minimum. There was nothing for it. Harry drew himself up to his full Gryffindor-on-a-mission unembarrassable height and strode into the building in search of his date.
Harry wanted to please Draco, share with him the intimacy of participating in and witnessing someone else's arousal, the way Draco had so sweetly and openly shared his with him. But Harry didn’t know what he wanted; he didn’t want to be touched the way he had touched Draco. There must be something that they could do, but Harry had been so focused on Draco’s pleasure that he hadn’t spared a thought to what he personally might enjoy.
“I mean, with the kissing and cock touching and everything. I know you said it was all no strings attached…”
Draco looked momentarily flummoxed. “Any thoughts on your choice of date?” He finally asked. “We both get to choose one each, under the terms of the contract with
Quidditch was the theme for Harry and Draco’s third and final charity date. Draco was meeting Harry at the Arrows off-season training grounds midday Wednesday. What Harry had planned would take the rest of the afternoon and Draco had to take time off work. He had bitched about this profusely and at length, which Harry had cheerfully ignored. Draco had a flexible work schedule – he was principally a freelance writer – and he worked too hard as it was. Instead of changing the time of the date, Harry had promised to make it worth Draco’s while and told him to come in clothes suitable for flying and to bring his broom, unless he wanted to use one of Harry’s spares. Harry had good spares. He had a rather exclusive sponsorship deal with Firebolt (being a war hero and a professional quidditch player was occasionally useful) and they sent him new brooms whenever they updated their models. Although Harry still flew the one Sirius had given him for sentimental reasons, it was fun to have other options and essential for training and matches. Consequently, he now had enough top-end brooms that he could have lent spares to all the Weasleys including their extended family and have good ones left over. Not that this was necessary – Ginny was in the Harpies and had surplus brooms of her own – but he
“No. You would have liked this place better if I had chosen it. You can’t take it back now.” Draco looked mildly delighted. It was an odd relationship he and Harry had developed since declaring an end to hostilities during Eighth Year at Hogwarts. They still weren’t friends, exactly. More like amicable acquaintances: a relationship where friendly teasing was permissible without causing offence. It was nice. Still, Harry couldn’t have Draco getting a big head this early in the date.
“You bought two of the ten pound each programmes?!” Harry said, disgusted. “On top of the small fortune it cost for the tickets?”
“As I suspected!” crowed Draco. “I’ll convert you to Slytherin wily ways yet.” He licked a strip up Harry’s neck, kissed behind his ear tenderly, like a gift. It should have been gross, all that spit, but it really, desperately wasn’t. Harry smiled and pulled them backwards onto the bed, Draco landing on top of him, looking both surprised and delighted. It was a very good look. They lay there and kissed for a while, Draco straddling Harry’s thighs, all smiles and loveliness, before Harry flipped them over, kissing a trail down Draco’s chest. Harry rested his chin on Draco’s belt buckle and looked up at Draco, catching his eye and smiling. Harry could feel the hot bulge of Draco’s erection against the side of his throat, the knowledge that their actions had caused this response in Draco’s body was equal parts glorious and terrifying.
When Draco was settled, and all the appropriate protective charms had been cast, Harry crawled up between Draco’s parted knees. He lightly traced the shape of Draco’s outer thighs with his palms. It was strange to see someone else's penis this close up. Draco’s erection was a pretty colour, pinker than Harry’s and a slightly different shape. Harry placed a quick gentle kiss on it’s tip. Draco gasped and closed his eyes. Harry couldn’t believe he was allowed to see him like this, beautiful, naked, and longing. He moved higher, arms encircling Draco’s hips, and kissed the soft white, blue-vein marbled skin of Draco’s stomach. Nosed into the dusting of coarse hair that trailed from his bellybutton down to his groin. Draco groaned, his legs twitching against Harry’s ribs. He was precious, Draco was so precious. Harry buried his face into the fold between Draco’s groin and the top of his thigh and just stayed there a while, breathing in the musty scent of him, feeling the catch of pubic hair on Harry’s stubble, and waited while Draco caught his breath, adjusted to the intimacy of Harry’s touch.
“Not to be rude, but I just want to be clear on something. Would this arrangement be… er… a, a sympathy fuck kind of deal? Because, I don’t think I would really be comf...”
“Some opera plots are a little silly. Usually lots of intrigue and sex scandals, if I’m frank. The horned hats are very specific to Wagner’s
“Uh huh. And your new book, the one with all the giant posters with your mug all over them. What was it called again,
“I know,” said Harry, “I trust you.” He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and apparated them to his room.
“Oh!.. oh... oh…” Draco moaned writhing, hands grasping onto the headboard. He was so loud in bed. Harry almost felt drunk off Draco’s arousal, of the power of being able to draw it out of him, the giddying joy of making Draco come apart. Of being allowed to give him this private, personal, wonderful thing. Harry kept working his hand, adjusting his rhythm, pressure and speed slightly to match Draco’s moans, trying to gauge what felt best from Draco’s responses. It seemed to be working. Draco was panting, crying out, keening. Then he stilled, drawing deep ragged breaths.
“I don’t really keep tabs on your love life, Draco. But as you’re very famous, very gay, and extremely hot, I would say yes? I mean, unless having a famous boyfriend is a turn off or something? Because if that’s the case, I hate to break it to you, but I don’t think the two of us are going to work out…”
Draco snorted. “Only you, Harry, would make that kind of comment about the Blacks’ centuries-old wine cellar. But if you want to offer me exorbitantly expensive wine, be my guest.”
Harry had to use all his will power to keep a straight face. It would have been highly inappropriate and hurtful to laugh, given the situation, however tempting.
“Ah, Draco? Are you ok? Is it something I said? I mean, I assumed I was less experienced than the people you usually shag. Am I not? Do you like hooking up with virgins or something? Like a kink? I mean, that’s probably alright, so long as it’s consensual. Except, maybe it would have been nice to tell me first? In the interests of clear communication and all that…”
for free, mostly (Harry knew) because Hermione had asked him to. It wasn’t the kind of thing Draco usually did. Harry was being touchy, and he needed to chill.  So instead of snapping, he replied, “I guess there are a fairly limited number of famous queer wizards who would be willing to embarrass themselves for the sake of charity. Fewer, if you rule out your exes.”
“Ah, should we head in, then?” he asked, gesturing to where the event staff were tearing tickets and ushering people through to their seats. Maybe if he distracted Draco he wouldn’t notice Harry’s discomfort.
“But aren’t the plots supposed to be stupid? I always thought it was a bunch of beefy singers in horned hats singing of facile rubbish. You know. Pretentious, with
“Would you like a cup of tea?” He asked. This was another useful technique to use when confronted by crying people.
Draco turned, head in hands, elbows on knees. “I’m sorry,” he stuttered, “you said to go slow. I shouldn’t have done that. I was so turned on – didn’t think... I’m such an idiot. I think I should go.” He made to get up, but Harry grabbed his arm.
“What about the poor straight people deprived of being turned on and distracted? Also, the Arrows have always been backward. This is just one more instance of the inevitable.”
“I can’t believe you own a formal suit appropriate for a white tie dress-coded event – including an honest-to-Merlin self-tie bow tie – and you don’t even know that it’s called white tie. Wait, yes, I do believe that. What I actually don’t believe is that you own white tie apparel in the first place. Whatever possessed you?”
is refreshingly gritty and realistic. The play it was based on was written by a female Czech playwright and is very true to life at the turn of last century. It was pretty unusual at the time, for both reasons.”
Harry and Draco’s first date was because of a bet: Harry’s lost bet, to be precise. It wasn’t even Draco he had lost the bet to, which was unfortunate – insufferable blond streak of
“Merlin, no.” Draco suddenly looked terrified. “Harry you won’t… you can’t tell them! It would ruin me…”
As Harry came down, he was vaguely aware of Draco kissing his forehead and casting cleaning charms on him and the bedclothes. When Draco was done, he lay down again next to Harry and Harry turned to him, winding his arms around Draco, pulling him close.
“Merlin. Of course I’m leaving it out. They haven’t paid nearly enough for that kind of content. We’ll leave it a month then do an exclusive with whichever publication bids highest.”
“Er… yes? I think it would be a good idea, Draco. It seemed to be important to you a few minutes ago. I promise not to laugh, or shame you, or anything.”
Harry kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth. “Just checking,” he said before removing their underwear. “Can you do the charms?” Draco muttered protection and lubrication incantations and Harry’s skin tingled, all goosebumps and anticipation. Gently, he grasped both their cocks.
Harry started, realising he had been staring into the middle-distance while fantasising about Malfoy at dinner parties. “Oh, nothing important,” he smiled, shaking his head. “How’s the Sex Author work going?”
“I’m sorry. Have I overstepped? Just, I would really like to go out with you and I thought it was probably better to say so sooner rather than later. Clear communication and all that.”
“Lier. You were laughing internally just now. I saw you forcibly stop yourself, don’t kid me you weren’t.”
“How Gryffindor of you,” said Draco, looking highly sceptical. Harry bit his tongue around the words
have sex before marriage these days. Virginity is positively frowned on. I doubt there’s many people our age who haven’t had sex.”
with Malfoy. He had just agreed to sign up for a charitable publicity stunt for W.A.P. (Wixen Against Preposterous-Pureblood-Prejudice), Hermione’s latest passion project.
It was difficult not to think of Draco in the days after; Harry would find himself daydreaming halfway through random household tasks. Or, more alarmingly, during training at work. Fortunately, it was the off season, so he was mostly working on strength and agility training. Daydreaming during a match would be unacceptable. As it was, he was just given stick by his teammates for being absent minded: so, another day in the office, in other words.
and every bit the heartthrob she had been as Ravenclaw captain at school, pre-transition. Draco fawned over her so much that had Harry not known that both Draco and Davidson were decidedly gay, he would have been worried. The recently retired Birch had captained the
“I don’t know, really. I think it’s probably because I have to know someone really well before I feel comfortable around them in that way? And most people don’t understand that it’s just how I am, they think it’s about them. As in, they think me needing time is some kind of a slight on them, like that I don’t find them particularly attractive or something. I mean, Ginny, for instance. She really wanted to have sex with me when we were together. She talked me into letting her give me a blow job and everything, but I couldn’t…”
“But you’ve dated loads of people! The press never shut up about whoever it is you’re supposedly shacked up with. You mean to tell me they’ve been fibbing all this time? How positively typical. So, tell me, why did you never have sex with your exes? You can’t possibly have been short of offers.”
“Can you take us to your bedroom? It’s just I feel a little on show in the parlour. I’m not angling for anything you don’t want to give, you understand.”
Harry grasped himself gently, muttering the same wandless charm he had used earlier with Draco, and fell into the familiar rhythm of a wank. He could feel Draco holding him, his warm body pressed into Harry’s back, his hand cupping Harry’s hip, the soft huff of Draco’s breath on his neck. It felt good. Harry never fantasized while wanking, he had been quite surprised to find out others did. He even knew guys who couldn’t get off without pornographic photos, which was odd to him, because those things actively turned Harry off the few times he had seen them. But to each their own, he wasn’t judging. When Harry masturbated, he focused on the way his body felt, the movement of his hand, the fissions of pleasure this caused. He sank into the moment without really thinking of anything much, just feeling and feeling and feeling. It was harder to do with someone else there, but Harry found if he focused on the feeling of security and trust of being held by Draco it helped. The specialness of being able to be with him, to share this with him, a man Harry cared for, one he had grown to like and respect, and who he trusted. Draco’s trust in sharing this with him when Draco himself was so inexperienced. Finally, Harry managed to lose himself in sensation, his whole focus on the spikes of pleasure shooting from his groin, curling through his legs, his stomach. His breathing sped up in time with his hand, then plateaued, and then gasping, Harry came. Draco held him through it, as Harry’s vision blurred and his cock spurted and pulsed.
“Certainly,” said Draco, offering Harry his arm. Harry placed his hand in the crook of Draco’s elbow, painfully aware of the heat of Draco’s body, of his closeness, of the tingles that roused in Harry’s stomach and chest.
“I don’t quite believe I’m about to say this, but… if you ever wanted to experiment a little with someone you have managed to have this awkward conversation with already, I could… ah… help you out.”
“That’s good of them,” said Harry soothingly. He noticed that Draco was shivering, the evening was getting cold and Draco’s top was so thin he was practically shirtless.
“Also,” Harry continued doggedly, “I am not calling you a slut. I mean, even if you had slept with every gay man on Diagon Alley I wouldn’t call you a slut, that would be wrong – your sex life is your business and shaming people is never ok — I just meant that the wizarding community is tiny, the queer wizarding community even tinier, and the famous queer wizarding community is minuscule. So. Even if you had only dated and broken up with one famous queer wizard, it would significantly shrink the pool of possible date candidates.”
“Well, let me know if you think of anything. It’s annoying to have to rewrite unnecessarily. I can show you the draft on Saturday. We are still good for Saturday, right?”
“I wish it was easier for me to give you what you want,” said Harry. “I’m sorry I’m so much less experienced than the people you usually sleep with.”
Harry grinned, “Yeah. Really.” He stepped closer to Draco, cupping Draco’s cheek in one hand. “Can I…?”
“Thank Merlin for small mercies,” Draco laughed. His phrasing sounded like it should be biting, but he didn’t deliver it with any of his usual snark. If anything, Draco sounded open and unbearably kind, almost vulnerable. He ran a hand over his face and then squared himself, looking at Harry.
“What? That I would fancy someone who I enjoy spending time with, who makes me laugh, and also makes me orgasm?”
“I’m not Weasley, Harry. I have far too high an opinion of my own attractiveness to be put off by soft cock. You say you want this and I believe you. If you want to stop, or do things differently, tell me. I trust you to let me know.”
“There are cubicles! Non-binary players can shower where they like!” said Harry aggrieved, “We’re not that backward.”
“No! Don’t be absurd, I wouldn’t ever openly plagiarise. Have you any idea how nasty and expensive Intellectual Property Copyright infringement cases are? Besides, it would be gauche. I merely take common turns of phrase and experiences and adapt them to purpose.”
“Language, Potter, muggles present. And don’t be a cheapskate, it’s undignified. Especially for someone who is currently wearing white tie and didn’t even buy the programmes in the first place. Here, take one. The synopsis is on page six, as I have absolutely no doubt you did not take the time to look one up before coming.”
Harry shrugged. “Come back to mine, then? I inherited a whole wine cellar along with Sirius’ family’s old place. You might even be able to help me translate the labels and work out what’s still drinkable.”
“Showers are all yours, boys!” she teased. “Brevis and I will take the team’s dressing room. I refuse to play gooseberry on your date if there’s going to be nudity.”
“Harry, I’m going to, I think…” and Draco came. Harry caught it, sucking and swallowing it down, even though it was jizz, and tasted really awful. He was too high on having made Draco come to care, too delighted with his success. Harry held Draco as he came down. Draco murmured sweet nothings and carded his hands through Harry’s hair.
“Yes,” Harry swallowed, thinking of the other ‘extra-curricular’ plans they had made for that day. “I’m looking forward to it.”
“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Do you want to come with me while I make it? There are tissues in the kitchen and I want to show you the fancy tea someone gave me, see if it looks like the kind of thing you might enjoy.”
“I mean,” said Harry suddenly anxious, “I might not be comfortable being naked at all, tonight. I just want to... I really need to go slow. Is that going to be alright?”
“Yes, yes. Your life is hard, we know,” said Draco, patting his shoulder, the patronising git. “But why do you feel the need to wear a formal muggle suit while performing Ministry Golden Boy duties? Surely dress robes would be more apt?”
“So, you went out and bought clothes you could happily wear to attend a royal wedding in order to brass my father off?”
“Merlin and Morgana,” Draco blinked rapidly for a few seconds and swallowed, his cock twitching hard against Harry’s throat. “Yes, that would be pleasant. If you’re sure that’s what you want.”
“Shh,” Draco soothed, rubbing Harry’s back, “I’m here. You’re alright. You’re wonderful Harry, so lovely, just the most lovely thing.”
“Says the man who has never had sex,” quipped Draco. “Look, except for the sexual intimacy, relationships are a lot like friendships. I have plenty of experience with friendships, I have even had the odd romantic fling. So, I can write about all of those aspects from first-hand experience. After that, you just have the sex, and honestly there are only so many ways people can gyrate against each other. If you read a lot of erotic literature you spot, ah… trends, shall we say.”
Lucius Malfoy was arrested only three years after You-Know-Who’s defeat, leaving his wife distraught with a baby to take care of. Narcissa was inconsolable. The mere sound of her baby’s crying would send her into fits of pain that would take her to the liquor cabinet every time. And whilst the woman and her child were perishing, the Ministry turned its back on the Malfoy clan, claiming their ‘Death Eater Ties’ to be beyond forgiveness. But, Dumbledore had another plan. After months in court, fighting with the Wizengamot, he finally got Sirius Black released from Azkaban, citing that his wand showed no recollected of casting such a spell and that it clearly hadn’t come from him, and returned the man to his husband, a Mr Remus Lupin.
“Albus.” he began, voice shaking and low. In any other situation, Remus would have scolded his husband for use of a former professor’s first name, but anyone with eyes could see that Harry hadn’t eaten in a while. At least not properly. And he would be damned if he didn’t allow Sirius to unleash the full force of his wrath on the one person who insisted on him being placed there. “Please, with as much clarity as you can muster in that tired, old brain of yours, can you tell us where Harry Potter has been since that night in Godric’s Hollow?”
I really appreciate all of the comments and kudos by the way, we had a lovely amount last week and it made me smile seeing how much people were enjoying my work! Thank you if you ever take the time to write a comment or leave a kudos - it makes me smile and lets me know whats working in this series and what isn't <3<3
“Yes, and I think I can guess what it is.” Harry ripped the paper off to reveal a large cut of fabric, that seemed to be made of water and shimmered like a lake.
Pansy turned to look at Draco with big, dark eyes and rubbed his leg soothingly. “Draco, honey,” she began in a timid voice. “don’t be angry with Blaise.”
The game was against Hufflepuff, who had a decent Seeker in Cedric Diggory, who happened to be exceedingly attractive, Draco noted, but he felt sure that Harry could do it. The boy had a natural talent for riding that couldn’t be denied. The second Harry kicked off from the ground, his father’s eyes shone with tears, probably because Harry resembled his father, if it weren’t for the green robes.
A weight on Draco’s shoulder pulled him out of the moment, and he looked up to see his father’s face peering down at him with a slight smirk.
gain control of his powers, as would Harry, and life would be carefree, even if it would take defeating a homicidal maniac to do it.
Harry spent Easter at the Lupin-Black’s and it was incredible. He and Draco had an egg hunt in the garden and stayed up all night talking. Seeing as Harry was now keeping up a correspondence with Sirius, he felt even more at home there than he did before. But, the bliss had to come to an end and Harry and Draco returned to Hogwarts with the most incredible chocolate stashes and exams on their minds.
The blonde thought for a moment before sitting fully on the floor and removing a singular sock. “Okay, Harry, here’s what we’re going to do…” He went on and listed the plan. It was complicated, but Harry felt sure that it would work. He peeked inside the gaping pockets of the stockier man’s coat, inside was an old quill, a jar of some unknown, icky substance, and a pouch.
“I don’t! And neither does Hagrid. But that's just the mainstream rumour. There's talk about you, too and, I think, seeing you so chummy isn’t really helping.” Ron looked like he was withholding information.
” The door clicked open and the pair scrambled in, seconds before Filch rounded the corner. Harry’s breathing was heavy, but Draco seemed paralysed in fear. Harry followed his line of sight, only to see a gigantic, three-headed dog, peering down at them with menacing eyes. “Harry, I think this is the third floor.” They both screamed and bolted out of the door, slamming it behind them. They ran so fast, there were tears streaming down their faces. It was a miracle they didn’t get caught. When they finally opened the door of their dorm, they closed themselves off with the curtains of Draco’s bed and held each other until the panting stopped.
“Stop blubbering, Potter. For the love of Merlin, how you manage to string together a decent set of words to form a sentence amazes me every day,” cut off Malfoy, sighing and looking up at Harry. “Maybe if you’d stop talking long enough to listen, you’d have heard me say yes,” said Malfoy pointedly.
“Potter? I’d like you to meet your new partner, Auror Malfoy,” Shacklebolt casually announced, leaning against the doorway and acting like he was offering to buy Harry lunch instead of delivering life-altering news.
Harry leaned forward until his face was mere inches from Malfoy. “Think very highly of yourself, don’t you, Malfoy?” Harry scoffed, despite the fact that being in such close proximity to him was clearly not healthy for Harry’s heart, which had decided to start beating a mile a minute.
Before he could move, Malfoy grabbed his hand to stop him. When he looked down, he saw Malfoy smiling gently up at him. “Sit down, Potter. I’m not finished speaking yet.”
Shacklebolt cleared his throat from where he was standing, and Harry realised he had been ogling Malfoy for a few seconds, having not said a word. “I’ll leave you two to get accustomed then,” he said, eyeing both of them warily before walking away. Harry could have sworn he heard him muttering under his breath “… and hopefully not come back to an exploded office.”
“See, I told you it wouldn’t be that bad! You even had fun after a while, admit it,” exclaimed Harry, grinning excitedly across the table at Malfoy. After ice skating, Malfoy had demanded that they go to his favourite restaurant, Fiorito, for dinner, after the ‘apparent’ ordeal he had been put through.
Malfoy tilted his head to one side. “I’ve had better, Potter. At any rate, I can see why you only have two friends. If this is what you do to all your friends, it’s a miracle Weasley and Granger have survived this far.”
After what seemed like several hours of bliss, but in reality was probably only two minutes, Malfoy pulled back from Harry, slightly breathless, with this ridiculously goofy, lopsided grin on his face that Harry had never seen before.
“Just shut up and kiss me, Potter,” said Malfoy, pulling Harry’s hand so that his whole body went tumbling towards Malfoy, and the next thing he knew, Harry was kissing Malfoy. And Malfoy’s lips were like soft like cotton candy, tasting slightly of wine, and Harry felt himself drowning in the feeling, wanting to stay in this moment forever.
“Malfoy?” said Harry suddenly, deciding to throw caution to the wind. They were in the middle of doing paperwork on the ‘singed eyebrows’ case, as Malfoy was calling it. It was two days since he had talked to Hermione, and Harry had thought, overthought and overanalysed everything until he felt his brain was about to explode. “Uhh… d’you…… d’you… um, maybe wanna go out sometime? Like I mean, after work hours. It’s totally fine if you don’t want to, I was just wondering if you’d like to and you don’t have to feel pressured or…,” Harry fumbled nervously.
Harry’s brain was now starting to hurt. What the hell was Malfoy saying? “Malfoy, what…,” started Harry but Malfoy cut him off.
The next six weeks passed by in a similar fashion, with Harry and Malfoy easing into a comfortable daily routine. Every morning, Harry would grab his and Malfoy’s morning coffee order on his way to work while Malfoy would pick up a scone and a chocolate donut for himself and Harry in the bakery near his house. Although Harry had initially been sceptical about Malfoy, he had to admit that the man was stellar at his job. Two weeks in and Harry was wondering how he had survived this long without him.
Malfoy then spoke up. “I’ll admit I’m pretty shocked right now, Potter. But I never said that I regret this, nor did I say that I wasn’t interested in pursuing this matter further with you. After all, I don’t just buy donuts for anyone.”
But Harry was speechless with joy, never did he think that Malfoy would agree so easily to this. Hermione was right, thought Harry, trying to suppress the huge grin threatening to engulf his face, he should really listen more to her.
“Fun? Your idea of fun is me slipping in front of unknown strangers and fracturing my hips? Ohh, I should have known what I was getting into when I’d agreed to come out with you,” replied Malfoy, burying his face in his hands.
Harry chuckled and led Malfoy over to one of the benches, where people were tying on their ice skates. He’d anticipated that Malfoy would be less than eager at the idea, which is why he had kept it as a surprise.
Uncle Vernon is a homophobe but I think we all sort of knew that. Please comment if you see any spelling mistakes!!
He wasn’t paying attention to what was being said much anymore. He honestly felt kind of guilty. He knew that Ginny was probably the person who took the dairy, and that the diary was probably quite a dangerous object, and she had been taken into the centre of the Chamber. She could die, all because he didn’t think, even for a second. However, he was shaken out of his thoughts by the loud bang of the door slamming open, to reveal (he sighed) Lockhart.
She snapped at him and stood, with one last glare and a roll of her eyes, Harriet turned on her heel and swept out of the pub without a look behind her. It was only when she had made it across the street and there was more than enough distance between them did Harriet realize she'd left her purse on the back of her chair inside. She groaned and raised a hand to her face.
Emerald met silver instantaneously and, before either of them could stop themselves, laughter bubbled from their lips. And kept bubbling from their lips, so much so that Harriet doubled over with an arm wrapped around her waist, her free hand outstretched to balance herself against Malfoy's sturdy form.
She was grateful to be alone. It had been exhausting watching Ron and Hermione communicate wordlessly on either side of her. And all the times Hermione had opened her mouth (no doubt to tell her she needed to take a break) had put her on edge. They couldn’t very well force her to leave the field...though, if they brought their concerns to Kingsley...
An anonymous tip--they got those all the time, but what was it about this one that Kingsley was so certain warranted an investigation? She supposed, based on the nature of the case, it was imperative that they followed-up on any and every possible lead in case one of them just happened to unearth something they could use.
Harry ignored it, she had to. With a flick of her wand...rather, the Elder Wand, Tom's body was bound by ropes, the sheet still covering the hollow shell left behind, "I'll move him."
"Malfoy," she said in greeting, though she couldn't keep the smile off her face. He stood to greet her and gestured to the seat across from where he was sitting.
Harry could hear Hermione rolling her eyes through the phone, "Yes, Lavender too--but really, she's been getting on my nerves, did you hear what she said about House Elves the last time we met?"
There was chaos as everyone scrambled upon their arrival in the auror office, chaos enough to make Malfoy pinch the bridge of his nose in exasperation, "The Minister and a private room would be a good place to start," he snarled, ignoring Weasley's sudden, surprised insults as the redhead hadn't seemed to realize he would be able to follow them back. Malfoy resisted the urge to tell Weasel he had been granted the clearance of an auror, thanks to the Minister's realization that his knowledge and ability was far more beneficial to them if it were easily accessible and kept under wraps by effective communication. After hours, he was able to apparate into the auror department's general lobby and make his way to Robards office, or Shacklebolt's to provide updates.
It was Parvati who has picked out her gown. Long, form fitting, white. Padma had bejeweled her in Emeralds (a necklace and stud earrings). Both had insisted her hair be pulled back in a sort of half-up half-down look, loose curls fell a little short of halfway down her back. Everyone gushed over how stunning she looked, red rouge on her lips, her eyes highlighted with a touch of mascara and a gentle sweep of blush across her cheeks. She felt like a circus freak on parade, dolled up like this. Harriet had never been much for playing dress-up. And, as always, it made her uncomfortable to have eyes on her. That much hadn't changed.
Currently, she was in the Great Hall, her lips pursed in a tight, fake smile. Camera's flashing, blown-up photographs of her, Ron, and Hermione from this same day, three years ago surrounding the hall, as if any of them wanted to see how they'd looked after the battle. She cringed as she saw a photograph of herself making a very rude hand gesture at the back of an unsuspecting reporter. She laughed as photograph-Hermione grabbed her hand and gave her a stern look. They looked exhausted in those pictures, leaving the castle later that day--reporters rushing the scene while the castle was unguarded. She remembered shoving quick quotes quills out of her face, camera lenses on her.
At last, her  eyes lingered on Draco, who looked like he was going to say something to her, but with prying eyes and attentive ears, he seemed to shrink away from the thought and merely nodded his head like his father.
Kinglsey sighed and turned to him, "Draco is a Ministry asset. I've privately contracted his services. As a private investigator, he possesses a multitude of skills, one of them being tracking. Since he's joined us, the number of close calls in which we've almost captured Mulciber and Dolohov have nearly tripled. Our 'anonymous tip' of course, came from him."
Harry busied herself with straightening up around her flat (which took all of ten minutes as she always kept it clean). It was moments like this that she missed Grimmauld Place--there had always been something to be cleaned or fixed. Well, until there hadn't been anymore and Andromeda had encouraged her to sell the wretched home. Harriet had insisted against it, she didn't need the money and Kreacher would have been happy to look after it.
First, she flicked her wand and tried to get her hair to fall in loose curls--but that made it look like she was trying too hard, and Merlin knew she wasn't going to try hard for a non-date with Draco Malfoy. She decided, long and straight was as good as anything. She compromised by putting in her contacts, instead of wearing her glasses, applying a little bit of mascara and some lip gloss.
"Walk much?" Malfoy snarled, but held out his hand all the same to help her up. She spotted her purse in his other hand and, unlike the first time they met, she took his hand instead of shoving it away.
"Stupid fucking Malfoy," she muttered under her breath and turned, trying not to tuck her tail between her legs as she went because if anything, one thing she had always held onto was her pride--and stubbornness. She clung to that pride even as she ran straight into someone and dropped to the sidewalk sharply.
Harriet realized before Malfoy did that he'd just divulged something very personal. Something he hadn't been meaning to share...certainly not something he ever wanted her to know about, "I--I understand. I did the same thing," she didn't know why, but she felt she owed him a courtesy. Something so that he would know she wasn't making fun of him, nor judging him, "I kicked him," Harry blurted, something she'd never told anyone she'd done, not even Ron or Hermione when they'd asked what had taken her so long. She'd told them what she'd said, screamed at him, rather. But she'd been ashamed of the kick.
"Hey Harry--have you got plans for tonight? I was hoping we could go get dinner--You, me, Ginny, Luna, Padma, Parvati?"
"We don't have time for a pissing contest, Weasley. Ask the Minister when we get back to London--" Draco snapped, flicking his wand and muttering a few counter-curses under his breath, "This is all I can do here, we've got to get her--"
"I didn't mean--I just meant here. Here here, like--" she gestured to the space around them and opened her mouth to speak again but found that she didn't have a follow-up.
All her life she'd thought she was supposed to be an auror. That she was meant for it. And, well, she supposed at one time she had been. At one point, her entire life revolved around eradicating the darkness from the world. Being a "hero" or "the Chosen One". She had never pictured a life in which she had other options. She'd never been able to picture a life in which Voldemort didn't exist. A world where she was free.
Harriet scoffed at the idea even now and sipped idly from her glass. She'd tried therapy once before, well, a muggle therapist--but that had been different. She didn't need a mind-healer...maybe all she needed was a new mind. The thought caused her to snort mid-sip, gracefully choking and spluttering all over herself in the process which only made her laugh even harder. If only the Patil's could see her now.
Hermione's features visibly softened and she threw her arms around Harriet's neck, "Oh, no, I'm sorry--I shouldn't have overreacted, I just--"
The last time she remembered speaking to Draco was after the trials where she'd spoken on behalf of him and his mother. She had been unable to bring herself to speak for the Malfoy Patriarch, as his crimes went beyond that of his kin. But her testimony had lessened his sentence from 15 years, to ten with the potential for parole after five, and Draco's reduced from five years in Azkaban, to three years of probation. If she remembered correctly, Malfoy had told her to "stop meddling" and to "stop being a hero" because he didn't want her help anymore. She wondered if he felt the same now that he was finally off the hook.
A flash of black and a flurry of robes came out of nowhere, slamming hard into her, knocking the air out of her lungs. She stumbled, but gathered herself quickly and shot a stunner in the direction her assailant had gone.
She and Ron high-tailed it out of there with a brief apology and a promise to come back soon. Once they were out of sight of muggles, she tapped the tip of her wand against the coin in her pocket so it would warm and signal to the others that they needed to meet back up. Ron set about explaining what had happened to the other, while Harriet fiddled anxiously with her wand, sliding it in and out of her sleeve, very much at the ready.
"You're such a--a stupid git! I'm leaving!" And when she didn't walk away Malfoy raised his eyebrows at her expectantly. Oh, of course, of course she was the one who had to walk away. She wondered if he was trying to make her feel like she was tucking her tail and running.
Harry would’ve spoke again, only an aftershock rumbled through her and she ceased any and all attempts at telling Malfoy off.
"Because of you my family is free from...Voldemort," Draco finally let go of her, "I'll never be able to repay you."
She met his silver eyes and rolled her own, "I'm not drunk just--clumsy," she admired, not having the tolerance to fight him at the moment. She was hardly tipsy, the Patil's (not to mention Hermione and Ron) would have her head if she was already drunk. They weren't big fans of Drunk Harriet as of late--least of all at an emotional charade like this.
With a snap of her fingers, the champagne was vanished from her gown and the rest of her glass disappeared much smoother through her lips this time around.
Harriet laughed, playing along and pulled her mobile from her pocket, "Oh, shoot--Ralph, we've got to go, Anna's gone into labor."
The blond stiffened momentarily before raising his hand for another round of shots, "Honestly, Potter...I don't know. I just felt like I wanted to spend time with you. After everything. Not to mention, both of us share a pastime."
She turned back to face him then, a look of pain so etched into her face that Malfoy looked shocked, almost just as equally hurt as she felt, "It's been a long time. I don't see why not," she paused, "Doesn't mean I'll stop calling you Malfoy, though," her words made him smirk and she returned a smile of her own.
After they'd essentially agreed that they might be able to be friends, Harriet couldn't stop thinking about him. Rather, about the moment they had shared. And then, her thoughts spiraled to all the others. Even back in first year--the Forbidden Forest. Second year, in the Slytherin Common room. Third year, when she'd set her patronous on him. Fourth year--the 'Potter Stinks' buttons and their confrontation. Fifth year--well, which part? Sixth year, on the train, in the bathroom, in the tower. And what would have been Seventh year...fucksake, there was far too much for her to go over, and yet, after a week of analyzing, Harriet found she'd gone through all of it. Multiple times. Their history was extensive and every bit of it went against the notion that they could be friends--yet...he had helped her.
"What are you doing here?" Harriet snapped before she could help herself, not intending her words to come out as rudely as they did.
"Well. They say to assume is to make an ass out of you and me. Ass-u-me," Harriet told him with an embarrassed laugh, as her response had been much cheekier when she'd sent it, and rather droll when she had to explain it.
Harriet laughed and it was her turn to roll her eyes. She was sure this was more about the fact that Lavender and Ron had dated once upon a time (not that she was about to bring that up), "As much as I'd love to, Hermione, I've got plans tonight--"
The rest of the event had proceeded much like the rest of them. Shaking hands and smiling tight-lipped, resisting the urge to spit "no comment" at every reporter looking for a sound bite as she was told she really should be more mindful of her
The rest of her thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Stupidly, she tried to sit up again, only to feel gentle hands on her shoulders, holding her in place, “Idiot, don’t move—“ Malfoy hissed at her.
Draco didn't say anything but stepped aside with a wave of his arm, signaling her safe passage with a dramatic flourish. She'd taken three steps before he called out to her again, but what he said shocked her so sharply she didn't turn back around, merely froze, "Do you think we could ever be friends?"
everyone because of who they used to be!" Harry lifted her glass and finished it in one go, not caring that a bit of it dribbled down her chin before she drew the back of her hand across her mouth, "So, thanks for proving me wrong, and thanks for the drink, I hope you know how muggle money works because I'm certainly not sticking around to help you figure it out."
"I need to reverse the curse, it will take some time, but if I manage to get it done, she will suffer far less before St. Mungo's takes over," Draco made sure to lock eyes with Weasley, ironically begging for the ginger to trust him. At long last, Weasley nodded and encouraged both Coote and Chambers from the room so they could finish giving their detailed accounts and ready their hostages for questioning.
She allowed him to help her to her feet and scowled when he held her pocketbook out for her to take, only to draw it away from her when she reached for it, "Come back inside."
"No, nothing at all," his sarcasm was all it took to send her over the edge. Harry shoved Malfoy hard, causing him to hit the brick wall of the building behind them. He was raising his eyebrows at her and holding up his hands as if claiming his innocence. The smirk on his face suggested otherwise.
As she opened her mouth to thank her in return, Mrs. Malfoy gave the slightest shake of her head. One that Harriet understood to mean she shouldn't mention it. It was the least she could have done. Her eyes fell on Lucius, who gave a nod of his chin. He looked nothing like the haughty, regal man she remembered from Flourish and Blotts when he'd slipped Ginny the diary and started a chain of events none of them could have imagined.
“I just wanted to make sure you weren’t dead,” he informed her as he dropped into the chair Hermione had recently vacated, “Nasty curse, I had the pleasure of experiencing it once.”
"Not ones like yerself," Ross admitted with a toothy grin and raised his beer bottle in her direction.
It was something like a Muggle Red-Carpet. They showed off their dresses, reporters got to ask questions and tried to unearth drama in the lives of those who had fought in the Battle. Harriet couldn't have begun to count the number of times she'd been asked about her love life--a question she had no answer for.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, but whatever it was got lost in the sudden chaos that broke out around them. Two cars collided and the ensuing 'bang' accompanied by the sound of breaking glass, shouting, and someone crying had Harriet's heart pounding out of her chest, her wand was drawn and she'd yanked Malfoy down to the ground, trying to get low and avoid what was sure to be a duel, right there in the middle of Muggle London.
"She suggested I thank you before I never got the chance. I realized she was right--I thought my future would consist of Azkaban. I never thought..." he stopped speaking and shook his head, "Once I saw Vo--his body, I realized I had a few things to say to him, too."
The bluntness of his statement, the plain look on his face, the way he didn't seem like he was offended by what he'd said at all had Harriet nearly crying tears of laughter and reaching out to smack his shoulder with the back of her hand, "You twit!"
She swept from the Great Hall quickly after that before her chest caved in on itself. The only place she could think of was the dungeons, a pit as dark and lonely as the dead man she was bringing there. Just outside what she knew to be the Slytherin Common Room, Harriet dropped to her knees and let Riddle's body hit the floor without a care.
They arrived in the village an hour after Kinglsey had instructed her to get their team together. After a quick planning session and going over their objectives (investigate casually, make sure no one gets hurt) Harriet was feeling hopeful. Or rather, she was trying to tell herself that she felt hopeful.
," Draco drawled, shoving his hands into his pockets as he tilted his head back towards the ceiling and closed his eyes, "Go on, get back to everyone. I need a minute to myself here as well."
"Harry, you don't have to do this, we can--" She shook her head at Bill Weasley's protests, smiled softly at Fleur who had stepped forward, looking every bit the fierce warrior they'd all been forced to become that day, and all the days before that had led to this very moment where they'd watched Tom Riddle fall to his knees and his reign of terror along with it.
"And a year before that you gave yourself up to Voldemort! If we're looking at patterns here, it's about time for you to do something horrible to yourself again and I won't just sit back and--"
"I don't mean now. I mean back then. That night. Why did you go looking for me?" Harriet blurted quickly, before she lost her nerve. She'd always wondered, but seeing as their interactions were, well, almost never, she hadn't gotten the chance.
She sighed and tried to focus on the article she'd been reading when a large, pitch black owl had swept in through her open window and landed on top of the Prophet she was reading. It wasn't until she realized she'd reread the same line without actually reading it that she accepted the interruption for what it was: a blessing. Gratefully, if aggressively done, the needy bird pecked her finger while she untied and opened the bit of parchment attached to its ankle.
Harriet gnawed at her bottom lip and took a deep breath, "It's stupid but...could we switch seats?" She felt ashamed for even saying it aloud, but if she didn't, this encounter wouldn't be any fun at all, for either of them. She expected Malfoy to mock her, but the other just stood and held his chair out for her to sit before he took place in the other, "Sorry."
“Sure, Potter, if your idea of fun is falling flat on your posterior five times and almost crashing into an unsuspecting couple, then yes, I had the time of my life,” declared Malfoy, looking at Harry with one eyebrow raised.
Despite everything that had happened between Malfoy and him, Harry’s heart did a strange sort of leap in his chest. He gazed up from his extremely unorganized desk clutter to see the one and only Draco Malfoy, standing a few feet from him, and looking like he had just come out of a modelling magazine.
Harry rolled his eyes and leaned back, scrutinising Malfoy for a second (while simultaneously trying to calm his wildly beating heart) before sticking out his hand. “Fine, Malfoy. Friends?” he said, locking eyes with him.
“Potter, are you always this daft or did you take a Confusing Concoction for breakfast? Yes, I’ll go out with you. Honestly, Potter, how you ever became an Auror astounds me,” Malfoy shook his head, looking at Harry in bewilderment.
At this point, Harry felt like his heart was squeezing uncomfortably, sending jolts of pain throughout his chest. This could not be happening. Friends. That’s all Malfoy saw them as. No wonder he had agreed so quickly to go out with Harry, he thought Harry had been asking to hang out. As friends.
Harry dropped his bag on Draco’s white-tiled kitchen floor and pulled the man himself into a loose embrace. Draco hummed and leaned into the touch as Harry buried his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, kissing the thin skin there open-mouthed, the vibration of Draco’s moans under his lips. Draco tasted sweat-salty, musky, and Draco-scented. No cologne this time. Harry didn’t miss it.
“I liked going out with you, for the dates, I mean. I would like to keep doing that if you would like to with me. I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said about relationships being basically friendships but with sex. Seems to me that’s what we have. Or at least, that we could do, if you wanted.”
Harry pulled himself gently off Draco’s lap, so he was sitting beside him, hands shaking, not sure what to say.
Harry laughed, a shaky, watery thing. “Thanks,” he said, scooting a little closer to Draco and giving him a sideways grin. “I kind of want to be chill about you touching my body, though. But I’m not. At least, not yet. Sex really scares me.”
“Harry, over here!” Draco waved to attract his attention. He looked good, thought Harry, as he winded his way through the tables towards the back of the restaurant.
Harry woke sometime in the early hours, to the rumble and clatter of the muggle rubbish collection in the streets below. Draco was curled next to him, the covers wound around his upper body, snuffling and sleep-soft. He shuffled closer and Draco murmured something and pressed his back against him, settling contentedly when Harry looped his arms around him. Harry felt safe and happy and mildly turned on. Not that sex was even a remote possibility – Draco was asleep, and Harry was not going to wake him – but it was still nice. Harry drowsed off again to half-formed fantasies of Draco touching Harry’s cock in various and exciting ways. For the first time, these imaginings were entirely free of anxiety. Dream Harry felt comfortable, loved. Lulled by the haze of half-sleep, Harry let himself believe that this could be a reality and for once it didn’t seem unrealistic. He could imagine having this kind of relationship. He hoped it would be with Draco, but if not, then with somebody, someday.
Harry laughed, embarrassed. “No, worse than that. I couldn’t even get it up, it was so awkward and the worse I felt the worse the no-boner-problem became… it was just bad. Really, truly terrible. Gin didn’t understand it at all, she thought maybe I was gay. Asked me outright, actually, not long afterwards. It would be an easy explanation, right? Especially as I like guys, too. But I’m definitely bisexual, I’ve found all kinds of people from right across the gender spectrum romantically attractive, including Ginny actually. I found her really romantically attractive when we were together just not…”
“No, you’re not. You have proved yourself to be incapable and untrustworthy. Now hurry up and pick a different conversation topic or I’ll be forced to do it myself.”
“Draco, you must be freezing; you have goosebumps all up your arms. Here, take one of my robes.” Harry wordlessly summoned a sleek grey dressing gown for Draco and an old hoodie for himself.
by Leoš Janáček, it is sung entirely in Czech. Do you speak Czech, oh Saviour? No? I didn’t think so. There will be a translation of the libretto – that means the words to the songs Potter, stop looking stricken – but it will be up there.” Draco pointed to a white board to the top right of the stage, that looked vaguely like the kind of screen Hermione used for her PowerPoint projections. “If you would rather rely on obsessively reading that, rather than watching the acting on stage, then be my guest. However, I would recommend reading the synopsis, myself.”
“Probably,” said Draco softly, strong arms cradling Harry’s back “there are a wide range of things I would agree to right now.”
“Poor Dumbledore. Being gay back then was as bad for the reputation as being a woman of easy virtue. But I take your point. Virtually no one
deal and Draco had only agreed to a friends with benefits relationship outside of that. Not real dates in public. Not boyfriends. The more Harry thought about it the sadder he was about the arrangement.
Back at Grimmauld Place, ensconced in the living room along with a bottle of very old but nonetheless exceptionally drinkable wine, Harry continued to quiz Draco on opera.
Harry managed to find the place alright, although he opted to discreetly apparate rather than take the tube. He had managed this without incident, despite the built-up nature of the muggle surroundings. Even from outside the building, Harry could tell he was going to regret his choice of clothing. Several of the men in the crowd milling around the foyer cradling plastic wine glasses were in shirtsleeves without waistcoats or even ties. One particularly casually dressed gentleman was in what appeared to be maroon chinos, a cream cotton t-shirt, and a blazer with elbow patches. Harry glanced at his watch, assessing if he had time to go home and change – into what he wasn’t sure, but he must have something that would make him look less of a prat than what he was currently wearing. He had fifteen minutes before the show started. Harry was looking around for a handy alleyway for apparition when he remembered Draco’s dire warning about Being Late. Harry technically already was late, at least by Draco’s reckoning. Apparently, being late was the worst
Harry choked out the words, despite feeling like his throat was closing in on itself. “I asked you out on a date, Malfoy. We’re on a date. Or, well, it was supposed to be,” said Harry, forcing out a laugh. How could he have been so stupid?
Malfoy looked confusedly at Harry, gently swirling around the wine in his glass. “Then, Merlin help me, why did you bring me?” he asked, bewildered.
Harry’s stomach twisted a little at Malfoy’s words, but he forced himself to continue talking. “Friends? What do you mean friends? I’ve never brought Ron or Hermione there before. I’ve actually never taken anyone there before,” admitted Harry.
Harry didn’t think he could take much more of this. It hurt more than he’d expected to hear Malfoy say those words. He felt like he was going to throw up. Standing up abruptly, he whispered “I think I have to go,” just loud enough so that Malfoy could hear.
“Harry, if you’re that interested, just ask him out,” said Hermione idly as they were having lunch in the cafeteria, flipping a page in her book while taking a bite out of her sandwich. She briefly looked up at Harry, continuing. “I mean, it’s not as if he’s the same spoiled, arrogant brat we went to school with. And he’s worked hard to put his past behind him, I really think we should give him the benefit of the doubt here. You sound as if he’s going to hex you into next month if you ask him out.”
Harry then looked back up at Malfoy, resigning himself to the fact that he was going to be working alongside him. Before he could get a word out, Malfoy sighed and plonked himself down in the chair in front of Harry. “Well Potter, if we’re going to be working together, we may as well try to be civil with each other. Besides, I don’t think Shacklebolt would be too pleased if he returned to find you rendered incapable of movement for at least a week, and I’d rather prefer if I kept my job too, you see” said Malfoy, smirking slightly.
“Hermione, that’s not the biggest problem here. Yes, Malfoy’s changed and though I’m sure he’d never pass up on a chance to hex my balls blue, but I don’t know if he’s bent. Or even bi, for that matter. I’m going to look like the world’s biggest idiot if he turns me down because of this,” said Harry, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose.
Harry felt like his heart was going to beat right out of his chest. “Yes? You… you mean yes you’ll go out with me?” Harry couldn’t believe his ears, it felt like liquid honey had clogged it up.
Admittedly, the real reason Malfoy kept having to repeatedly save him while they were on the field was because, on more than one occasion, Harry had found himself staring at Malfoy’s toned body or his sweet arse, leaving a window of opportunity for whomever they were targeting to attack Harry. So really, thought Harry irately, it’s really Malfoy’s fault that I nearly had my eyebrows singed off yesterday.
Malfoy gave Harry a withering look, raising his eyebrows, with a hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
