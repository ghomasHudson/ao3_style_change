to her.
...tone.
friends but it was a step in the right direction, and one Harry had actually enjoyed.
With an inward sigh, Harry started, “As it so happens, I am struggling with memories of the war and it’s been making it pretty hard to focus on much of anything really. I’ve mostly laid in my bed with the curtains drawn when no one is in the room. If there are people there, I’m hiding in Firenze’s classroom or the actual Forest. You see, I’m also avoiding human interaction so I can pretend there’s nothing wrong with because I am apparently a broody person.” The sarcastic answer rolled off his tongue without second thought. Harry was astonished at himself, and a little terrified. This was the second time in his life that he had given serious lip to McGonagall, and he wasn’t sure if he’d survive a second attempt. He watched her face carefully, his face a blank mask. He wasn’t even sure what emotion it was supposed to be displaying anyway.
He turned around on the landing to find Narcissa standing a  few steps below him.
! behind him.
And the attic was being turned into an apartment in between shopping trips and decorating evenings, which took up the rest of Harry and Draco’s free time. The walls had been cleaned and painted a lovely light blue. Fresh white paint had done up the trim and it was looking more and more liveable. New furniture had been moved in, and after Christmas, Harry intended to do all of the bathroom and kitchen work.
Small groups of students slowly broke off from the tables as they continued their antics, heading out for their classes today. The group split up as classes started for the day; Harry promised to grab a picnic for lunch so they could enjoy the sun. He’d canceled class, partly so he and his students weren’t cooped up on such a lovely day. Instead of class, Harry had told his students to come outside with him whenever they had time, and they could practice their possible spells for the final. Hermione chided him on his practical as they made their way to Transfiguration.
“Don’t look at me like that! You don’t know how I feel! You’re just standing there and looking at me, pretending that understand, BUT YOU CAN’T! NO ONE CAN!”
“Why not? We have the one from fifth year, I think we should have one now too. Our parents never got a second photo...” Harry knew he was right and that thought made his heart squeeze a little too tightly. He nodded, turning to face Neville once he was done organizing.
“Well… No, I wouldn’t think she would,” Andi said, after a moment’s contemplation. “She believed muggles were beneath her, and therefore anything they thought to do was beneath her.” There was a stillness in the room as everyone sat contemplating what that meant. Harry stared at the fire, thinking of everything he’d learned in his years at Hogwarts and the time he spent fighting away from Hogwarts.
“It feels like everyone else has moved forward since the war, but I’m stuck. The memories won’t leave me alone, and I don’t remember what it’s like to not be a soldier anymore. To not always be thinking of plots to avoid death and how to get me and my friends out of messes and out of danger. I always look over my shoulder, thinking I see Death Eaters… Or when the fireworks went off this summer, I grabbed my wand, thinking I was back at the battle… Too many green sparks… Or that kid’s laugh is just an octave too high and it sounds just like him.”
“And George has hired several werewolves, helping them find places to stay, too,” Ron was saying when Harry tuned back in, taking a drink from the teacup Kreacher had brought in. “We’re trying to get access to the recipe for the Wolfsbane Potion as well. Once we have it, we’ll be able to brew it for the werewolves working with us and to hopefully make it widespread enough for others to afford it.”
“Oh, yeah, forgot about that,” Harry said. He waved his hand, as if swatting a fly, and it disappeared.
Students slowly rose from their seats, going to classes and study periods and wherever else they went after breakfast. Only Draco and Harry were left.
“Are we having a row now?” Draco ended his question in a high pitch moan as Harry bit him sharply. Harry pushed himself closer, slotting his leg in between Draco’s.
fast. But Harry’s better than that. He slid to a stop barely a foot in front of me and he caught the Snitch. Then the bastard had the audacity to
“And you didn’t get a detention? Typical Potter.” They laughed, real laughs, as they separated, grabbing their bags from the nearby tree.
Surprisingly, there was no chatter about what happened in the hallway, though the second years did eye him warily as they walked past. The tension eased from Harry’s friends and the mood seemed to return to a semi-normal. Bad jokes and puns, threats of hexing, and impersonations of least and most favourite teachers. There were pieces of food thrown with furtive glances to the Head Table, the veterans still afraid of McGonagall.
The rest of the afternoon passed like this. Veterans beneath the tree working on essays or grading, bickering, criticizing Harry’s form. It was normal, and they liked it that way.
The conversation petered out after that, both of them lost in their own thoughts as they watched Harry play with Teddy. All of his pain and sadness seemed to disappear when he was with his godson, the smile of the baby enough to make his heart feel a little lighter, even if for just a moment.
this is,,,,longer than i expected. still not like great lengths or anything, just 3.5k (HELLO GUESS WHAT ITS NOW 4.9k!!!!), but still,,, thats a lot of information.
“The library isn’t a good place for practicals, and it’s too cold outside. Plus, they have class in here, so they’re comfortable with the space and therefore more comfortable with their spells.” He shrugged, flicking through progress reports he was getting ready to pass out for his class. Since he never gave them tests or quizzes, but he still wanted them to know where they stood in the class, he needed to come up with
He sat at the low table in the kitchen, watching the house-elves run around to prepare Harry a plate. There was a scoff from the far end of the table and Harry’s wand was drawn before he could think, eyes locked on the slumped figure. He relaxed his arm a little, but he didn’t put away his wand when he recognized the figure at the other end of the table.
“Harry, do you remember what day it is?” she asked gently as she came to stand a few feet away from him. She’d become an expert at this kind of thing, between Harry and the Weasleys and her own nightmares, she knew exactly what he needed.
Harry let himself space out a little, continue to reminisce about the twins and the things they’d done throughout their years. He sorely missed Fred and how he and George always knew how to light up a room. Their best, by far, was with Umbridge. Pure genius, and Harry hoped that no one ever forgot about it. Students can, and should, stand up to tyranny, even if that tyranny comes in the form of a tiny woman covered in pink.
Before, he’d been in the public eye at every turn, but he’d ignored what they said because there were bigger things to battle against. Now that the war was over, he was having a minor identity crisis. He’d rather everyone believe he was still an enemy of the Ministry than believe he’s this chosen hero.
. I know you’re used to doing things alone, without help from anyone. But there are people who are here for you. At the very least,
“If they don’t and we end up with a sulky Harry again, and we have to repeat fifth year, I will personally make Malfoy's a living hell.” Ron leaned down to kiss Harry’s forehead too. Once his best mate was tucked in, firewhiskey safely stored on the floor, Ron and Hermione snuck off to bed. Harry was too deeply asleep to hear them laughing at their friend’s flair for the dramatic.
, Draco thought to himself. The monster, like a dog, crawled under the table, giggling. Draco had gotten down on his hands and needs to chase the toddler around some more when he saw Teddy’s eyes widen before he was yanked from underneath the table.
“And she’s right. But even she’d say that fear of his name is just as big as the fear of You-Know-Who himself. He made them that way. He knew what he was doing when he made his name a Taboo…” Harry trailed off, unable to stop his mind from spiraling through the events of that lead up to that night at Hogwarts.
Despite Harry and Andi’s attempts to cheer the stuffy estate, one piece of furniture left a lot to be desired.
“Afterwards, we went out for a pint to avoid the party that was evidently going on in Gryffindor Tower. I, erm, got a little bit more wasted than intended, and there were some embarrassing confessions. After that, we started hanging out more and then he asked me to stay for Christmas and… Well, you know the rest of the story.” He shrugged nonchalantly, his face almost as red as the strawberries Fleur was using to make compote.
“Er.... I…”
They took small breaks every so often to go up and study the painting, how it was attached to the wall, what might work and so on. Hermione gagged Walburga in much the same manner she’d blindfolded Phineas during the war. Of course, the black expression on the painting’s face gave an idea to the thoughts she had about the “filth” in her house, but Harry was glad to shut her up while examining the painting.
“Well, what else have you tried?” she asked, already moving with him towards the library.
“Good afternoon,” Harry said as he strode into Defense classroom, a week after Luna talked with him in front of the Room of Requirement. If he was breathing a little heavy, no one noticed. Getting to class on time was not his strong suit. “Would you please put all your books back in your bags, today’s lesson is a practical lesson. Wands only.” The students quickly scrambled to do as The Chosen One asked before turning to look at him expectantly.
“I’ve charmed these glasses to filter out the worst of the image, so those of you who fought will have the choice of what you face. As for the rest of you, you should face what was done.” His voice hardened, not-so-subtly telling these people he has no mercy for them.
“It’s no’ right for a kid to be wanderin’ like tha’, ‘specially not when he looks like a stiff wind’d blow ‘im over. Once yer dad and the rest’d completed the Animagus transformation, they joined our monthly breakfast and teas.”
comments make my day, but kudos are just as lovely!
“Harry, can you help me with this?” Granger said from one end of the station. Draco spun around to see Harry putting Granger’s trunk on top of the Weasley’s trolley. With promises to see him at Christmas, she left with the redheads. Harry smiled as they left and headed towards the other exit. The exit next to Draco.
, once he got over the nerves. Harry, with his luck, ended up with another nervous Keeper that dropped the Quaffle more than she caught it. Unfortunately, Hannah was the best of the six that had come out.
“You asked me to,” Harry said, shock coloring his voice. “I haven’t missed one yet. I wasn’t going to let a row get in between that. Plus, I was excited to see your exhibit.”
“Of course not, Potter.” Once Harry had caught up, McGonagall started walking again. He fell in step with her and they moved easily through the throngs of students flooding the halls for lunch.
“...Oh, well, in that case…” Harry stood, opened his mouth to say something else then shut it again. He turned awkwardly to walk from her office before McGonagall spoke again.
Malfoy sometimes studied with Harry when he was holding office hours in the Room of Requirement.
“What’s wrong?” she asked, giving him that pitying look Molly often gave him when she thought he wasn’t looking. Wanting to ignore it and any conversation about feelings that may follow, Harry shrugged again before forcing a bite of the cardboard oatmeal into his mouth to avoid answering Hermione’s questions. She narrowed her eyes, and, for a moment resembled Professor McGonagall as she examined Harry. After searching his face for a moment, she said softly, “You know we’re all here for you, Harry.”
… We’d have to go through the Ministry…” At Harry’s grimace, she sighed. She knew Harry would rather avoid the Ministry at all costs, so spell creation was out the window.
Once Neville finished his stories, Harry let his students out early with reminders to practice their wand work for their final. Their chatter rose animatedly as they packed up and left the room. Harry watched with a slight bitterness. What he wouldn’t give to be like that again…
Narcissa, Lucius, and Draco stepped onto a platform at the center of the castle where the majority of the attendees were gathered. They quietly garnered everyone’s attention, and Harry wandered in from the adjacent room. He leaned against the door frame, getting ready to zone out of one of Narcissa’s boring speeches.
When the score reached one hundred and twenty to Hufflepuff, Harry called a timeout, landing hard on the ground seconds after Madam Hooch agreed to the timeout.
“The Room is just mad that we ruined part of it. I’m worried the charms are broken…”
As the morning slowly unfolded, Draco was finding himself further and further out of his element. Having a literal hand in the preparation of the meal was foreign. The kind, easy, mindless chatter was new but nice. Molly talked to Fleur about the preparations for a baby, Andi told stories about everything new with Teddy, and Fleur excitedly talked about her work with Bill and how they were settling into their new house.
The music swam lazily to the surface through the static, drifting through the roar of the motorcycle. Wide open desert surrounded the couple for miles, stretching on, orange and red, ad infinitum. It was a nice change of scenery after years stuck in the endless dark in England.
“That’s a mean trick to play on the little ones,” Hermione said as she hid her smile behind her goblet.
“How did that happen anyway? I mean,
“Hermione, that’s not the point. I think I’m gonna talk to McGonagall about it.”
“Why the Room of Requirement?” Malfoy asked absently one day, twirling his quill in his hand as he edited an essay.
(See the end of the chapter for
to break, Harry’s friends never strayed far from his side. Someone was always with him. Harry, not being completely stupid, noticed this. He wasn’t a child. He didn't need constant supervision. He’d survived this long on his own, he thought he would do just fine brooding by himself for a bit. So, he attempted to ditch them at every given opportunity.
“Many of us maintained that delicate balance between duty to our house and loyalty to our own beliefs. But when we were tested, we chose the wrong side. Eventually, I learned that loyalty could be given to individuals, not just a house. People who had no obligation to support me, to teach me, to care about me, but they did so anyway. Simply because it was right.” Draco’s eyes scanned the crowd as he spoke, and Harry  ducked his head to avoid making eye contact. It dawned on Harry then that Draco was speaking about him.
“Yeh can keep ‘er,” Hagrid said as he watched Harry raise his hands to lift the small creature from his head. “She’d like bein’ out an’ about again.”
Keeper because Ron had been
, and not a supposed serious newspaper. He snorted at the irony and shook his head, handing the paper back to Andi.
Across the hall, the younger students looked confused. Was there really a troll in the dungeon or was it an inside joke? When should they panic? As if sensing their confusion, McGonagall stood. Seamus only grinned in the face of her withering stare.
Hermione’s hair frizzed up the more potions they brewed, but still no results. By dinner, Harry’s glasses were heavily smudged, he and Hermione reeked of a mixture of potions, her hair was the same frizziness as their first year, and they were no closer to getting rid of the blasted painting.
It’s not like there was really anything else to do. Quidditch hadn’t started yet, and classes weren’t in full swing yet. With no more sleuthing to do, now that his purpose had been served, Harry found himself bored all.the.time. All the secrets of You-Know-Who’s plans had been discovered, all the mysteries of his life and everything that involved had been revealed. Writing two rolls of parchment on the theory of Amortentia was less than thrilling after the plots he’d been forced to foil in his first six years.
There was a large main room, big enough for a couch and maybe a chair, a TV, and a desk. There was a smaller room just off to the side that could be a small kitchen, a bathroom, and the largest room could be a bedroom…
“When have you ever done what you were told, Potter? I very distinctly remember your fifth year being composed of you doing exactly the opposite. Even in your first year, you decided the rules weren’t for you to follow. I don’t know why you’ve suddenly decided to go with people’s expectations. It certainly doesn’t run in your blood.”
Why did everyone think he always wanted to be involved in fighting, in defense?? He knew a fraction of the spells the Order had known, and he had only known a miniscule amount of the ones the Death Eaters had used against him. His repertoire of spells included the basic defensive spells and a few of those from the Half-Blood Prince. Fighting wasn’t his strong suit, it just happened to be what he
?” The crest of his House was plastered all over it and it was a deep and shimmery
“Okay, Andi and Narcissa, you’re in charge of food and drinks because you’ve actually planned and hosted Christmas dinners before,” Harry said once they reached the Muggle shopping center.
“Does your mum want to host, or do you want me to?” Harry asked Ginny as they made their way to an empty compartment on the train.
After that, Draco was easily drawn into the easy conversations as they worked their way through Christmas dinner for Draco can’t remember how many people.
“There’s one in here… Ah! Here it is!” Andi held up the little piece of paper for Harry to see. It was light blue and
“There’s an order of chips in, too.”
The room seemed to hold its breath as Harry slowly peeled off the paper from the box. It was light, as if nothing was in it. The box beneath the shimmery paper was plain cardboard. Taking a deep breath, Harry pulled the lid off the box achingly slow to reveal a pillow.
Coming to America had been the best decision Harry and Draco had made since Voldemort had gained power in England. After the Battle of Hogwarts, when only a handful had stood surrounded by the dead, Voldemort had seized power of both Wizarding and Muggle England.
They stayed like this for hours, not speaking much. Dinner came around and Harry’s stomach growls loudly. He grinned at the loud disruption and the disgruntled look his boyfriend gave him. Draco rolled his eyes, sending the books back with another flick of his wand. They left together, Draco’s arm around Harry’s shoulder, Harry leaning into Draco’s warmth.
“If you don’t tell me what happened after, it’ll hurt more!”
“The amount of times I’ve heard that…” He shook his head, remembering when every girl in the school seemed to want to go out with Local Pariah Harry Potter.
The look of affront of Draco’s face warped into hurt. He’d forgotten how much of a self-absorbed ass Harry could be sometimes. But the look of hurt on Draco’s face must have been misread as a pitying look because Harry just exploded.
i think one or two more chapters before this fic is done!!! obvs this isn't the end of the series, i plan to continue more in a few one shot or short chapter fics!!!! i can't believe this is the first multi chapter fic i will have finished!
They fell silent again. Harry’s eyes drifted to stare forlornly at the limp pamphlets. Draco watched Harry, afraid of losing him again to whatever plagued his head again.
“Do they understand what they’re doing?” she asked, shoving a book in her bag and forcing the clasps closed.
“For goodness’ sake, Harry! I live just a floo away and yet you insist on writing owls like we’re countries apart!” she reprimanded, dusting her Muggle clothes quickly before stepping into the house properly.
“How is she?” Harry asked, moving to sit back down across from Ron. None of the werewolves should be treated like they are, but especially not the ones turned as a result of a war they should have never been involved in in the first place.
a new update! it's been a while! (two years, but who's counting)
When they got back to the motel, Harry could barely wait to get through the door before their mouths crashed together again. His worst fear, he realized as he worshipped Draco, was losing him. So, Harry made sure Draco knew just how much he loved him as the sun set the horizon ablaze, their radio crooning softly in the sweet morning air.
The conversations resumed like nothing had happened. Pots and pans clattered and water boiled and laughter bubbled and vegetables were chopped. All of it was surprisingly comforting to Draco, though everything was essentially new to him.
The Chosen One they want me to be. I just… I did what was I was made to do. Not because destiny or whatever chose me, but because there was someone else controlling the strings...” He trailed off, thoroughly confused about how he saw himself now.
. He and the others often went down to the little village once classes were finished, so they could study away from the sometimes stifling air of Hogwarts. With most of them being a professor of at least one Defense class, their students pestered them almost constantly.
“Me too,” is all Harry said. He ended up not going to the Three Broomsticks that night. Instead, he and Malfoy went to The Hog’s Head Inn and had a pint, talking in hushed voices about anything and everything like old friends. With his friends, he felt like he had to be fine all the time. Being open with Malfoy was… easy.
“I’m glad you don’t hate me, Harry… I think I might hate myself enough for the both of us,” Malfoy said. The cold air seemed to be sobering him up, if only in the slightest.
“Harry?”
“Not bad for your first time,” Harry commented. He walked around, fixing postures and wand grips before calling out, “Again!”
Of course, with the holidays meant figuring out where to spend them, which Harry had been putting off for a long time anyway. Too many things and not enough brain cells to deal with them at once.
“Ah, yes, the Weasley twins,” Neville said sagely. “Men ahead of their time, certainly. This was long before the war, but when we were just first years…”
. But she did miss her sister. There was a lot to fix, both with her sister and her son and his boyfriend. Lunch seemed a good a place as any to start.
“Think about it, Hermione. Last year, they had the Carrows. Now they have me, and despite how much I hate it, they view me as a hero. I’m teaching them how to protect themselves in the face of Dark Magic like what they faced last year.”
The morning sun rose slowly over the wide expanse before them, and Draco felt his heart soar a little. For the first time since they’d left, he felt… hopeful. He had Harry. Harry had him. If their world was ending, there’s no one else he’d want by his side.
“I need to breathe…” Harry said in a strangled voice. The idea of facing his friends and the younger students was suddenly too much, the walls of the castle closing in on him. “I can’t breathe,” he said again.
“He was just like that, I think,” Draco said with a laugh. “You really think I dress that strange?”
Added about 700 more words and altered one scene completely. This notification chapter will be deleted 3/29/21!
“You’re at Hogwarts,” Hermione said. “You’ve been teaching Defense for the fourth years all year.”
The days leading up to Christmas were hectic. Andi, Harry, and Draco all took turns minding Teddy while the rest did the holiday shopping and everyone decorated at night after the little monster had gone to bed. Kreacher was dealing with most of the preparations, but Harry and Andi liked helping out.
He laughed on a shuddery breath as he pulled it from the box. It was split evenly into fourths, with a large panel with words on it in the center. The bottom left corner was a black muggle band tee, one of Sirius’ no doubt. The bottom right was a soft gray flannel. Harry had a feeling it was Remus’. The last two, sitting at the top of the pillow… They were soft and warm, and they complemented each other. One was a black soft tee that had been worn down to a gray, and the other was a soft blue.
i like to think im clever
“Oh, honey…” She pulled him to her and Harry rested his head on her shoulder. Minutes passed in relative silence as Harry cried for the family he’d lost, but when he pulled away from Andi, he was grateful for the family he’d gained. Andi patted his cheek before turning back to the washing.
“You’re reluctant to teach.” She wasn’t accusing him or asking him a question, it was simply a statement. Harry nodded, his face screwed up against everything welling up inside him.
do you want us to do about it, Professor?”
Of course, he didn't have to wait long to figure it all out because Draco appeared next to him, two glasses of champagne in his hands.
“It’s the least I can do, Potter. Have a good night,” she said as she waved her wand, the parchment rolls returning to their previous position on her desk.
you, old hag! Nobody needs input from a dead woman’s portrait about the manner of people who come in and out of this house, as it is my house now! Now, if you would KINDLY keep your screams to yourself, there is a toddler who lives here! I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to try to put him back to bed for the
“I work in a muggle bookstore!” Harry said a little too loudly. Nicholas blinked owlishly at Harry, who swallowed awkwardly. He refused to look at Draco, although he knew he was wearing that exasperated
“Let’s start with the youngest, yeah?”
Now, one of the paintings from earlier wandered over and politely cleared her throat.
” he shouted, his hand reaching for the flying wand instinctively. The class gasped and clapped and Harry turned around, swallowing. “Now, er, catching the wand isn’t necessary for this exercise, it’s simply a habit… You want to focus on disarming your opponent, so focus on their wand, not them. The flick of your wrist should be sharp, but don’t focus too hard on it. It should feel natural.”
“I’ve learned to overcome prejudice to see people’s true worth. What lies in their talents and skills. So tonight, I would like to introduce the newest exhibit. At Hogwarts, there was an obnoxious muggleborn Gryffindor who carried a camera around his neck. For six years, he took pictures of anything and everything. Muggle and magic pictures were developed. When the war came, he documented everything he saw, both muggle and magic. Unfortunately, he died at the Battle of Hogwarts.”
As he broke the cloud cover, Harry felt something inside him snap. He relaxed into the feeling of the magic wood beneath him, words pouring out of him into the emptiness surrounding him without much thought.
.” Harry laughed at the understatement.
“Magic paint?” Harry asked in exasperation.
“Harry,” Andi said, looking over at the boy she’d claimed as her son. “I want you to know Sirius would be so proud of you today.” She watched tears form in his eyes at the mention of his godfather’s name and he turned to her slightly, twisting the dish towel in his hands.
“I’m glad I found you,” Narcissa said, cutting into whatever Harry was going to say. She stepped up onto the landing, moving so she was further from the stairs. “I’m afraid I’ve been unfair.”
“I’m fine,” Harry said with a sad smile. “Just a lot of emotion floating around.”
“Who are you talking to Harry?” a dreamy voice asked. Luna sank down next to Harry, who said, “Myself.” She sat her books beside her, obviously expecting to be here a while. Her eyes wandered up and down the hall, and she let silence settle between the two.
The pub was mostly empty when they entered, and Draco made a beeline for a table while Harry went to get the pints. He berated himself for acting like a love-sick child, the noise not enough to completely drown out his thoughts. And there were a lot of them.
to be normal, I don’t know what it means to be a teenager. I’ve always been a rebel, a fighter, a soldier. And now I don’t know what or who I am… So school sucks,” Harry said lamely at the end of his rant.
at me.” Draco let out a laugh as he remembered his entire body turning red at that. Harry had been caught up in the moment, he thought it hadn’t meant anything at the time.
Harry started to leave, weaving through the crowd as inconspicuous as he could be. He wanted to go out and get pissed and do something reckless.
But Draco
“Draco, your pedigree is showing.” His boyfriend sneered slightly, but there was affection behind it. Harry settled down next to him, leaning forward so their arms were touching, wrist to elbow.
He grinned like a lovesick boy, blushed, and flopped over and pushed his face into his pillow, suppressing a giggle. Merlin’s pants, he’d become a blubbering mess in a matter of hours.
He waited until Malfoy was through the portrait hole before making his way up to Gryffindor Tower. He lit his wand as he walked, careful to keep it away from the sleeping portraits. Malfoy hadn’t been the most talkative of company, but he wasn’t bad to have a drink with. Even if he seemed to drown his problems in firewhiskey. He’d feel that bad decision in the morning, and Harry couldn’t help but gloat a little at that. Their rivalry might be dead, but he could still revel in the little things.
“The lecture?” Her voice sounded distant as she spoke as if she wasn’t focusing on Harry.
leave a comment and a kudos for quidditch! (i read so much about the game to write the first part) ((to help write it and edit it as of 12/28/18, i rewatched all quidditch matches and got fucking GOOSEBUMPS watching the beginning of the world cup)
“We have to get ready for the day,” Draco mumbled as he snuggled closer to Harry. He squeezed Draco in response, not wanting this moment to end either. Today would be...a day. Unbidden, his mind raced ahead of him. This Christmas was a
“The Lupin Project is going well, then?” Harry stood and stretched, moving to stand next to the fireplace, wanting to ward away the chill of the early morning that had seeped in overnight. He took a long drink of his tea, watching his best friend become more animated as he told Harry more about the project.
Draco made a sound of agreement and leaned into Harry. He went back to his work with Harry leaning against his left side. It’s hard to read the books with only one hand, but it’s a good thing he’s magic. Students walked past, watching Draco levitate books and flip the pages with a lazy flick of his wand with Harry Potter leaning into his side.
“Malfoy?” Harry called out, slowing his pace. “You alright?” He could see Malfoy’s body tense in surprise at the voice, but he didn't move. Frowning, Harry slowed his pace, giving Malfoy time to adjust to his approaching presence.
“I got one of each so you can pick your poison,” Harry said as he took a sip of the butterbeer. Malfoy didn’t respond as he quickly downed both shots of firewhiskey before taking a long gulp of the butterbeer. Frowning into his pint, Harry watched Malfoy. An hour stretched into two with Harry and Malfoy sitting together in companionable silence. Five pints of butterbeer later and Harry was ready to go, but Malfoy was still sulking into his seventh butterbeer. Rosmerta had capped them after Malfoy could barely stand to grab the next round of shots of firewhiskey for himself.
“The only good thing is I get my own room,” he said, fiddling with his glass. “But it’s going to be more difficult, now that Harry and most of his friends are in another common room.”
The class continued like this, spells shooting everywhere, Harry correcting students gently as they needed it. Only a few students managed to successfully disarm their opponent, but the whole class made a lot of progress anyway. The hour ended all too quickly and Harry dismissed them, telling them their next few classes would be here in the this room.
!” Obviously, Harry had that kicked puppy look. Ron was usually useless against it, but he’d had enough.
“The magic, I know. But do we actually know the effects muggle tech has on brooms? And, really, do you think it would? It’s just like a camera, just recording lengths of time rather than snapshots. And I think it’s time for the Wizarding world to move out of the Second World War.” Harry grabbed a chip from the fresh basket the waitress had just brought, using it to point at Draco. “The rest of the world has, kinda.”
“It’s a brilliant idea, Harry.” Neville nodded enthusiastically. Time stretched out between the three of them before Neville mentioned restarting the Duelling Club. “I think it’d be nice for everyone to let out some tension in a controlled manner,” Neville said. “And Harry, you could help out if you wanted.”
as of 2/15/19 this has been updated!
“That’s a mean trick to play on the little ones,” Hermione said as she hid her smile behind her goblet.
Some were
.” He groaned, throwing himself against the back of the “couch.”
“Walk with me?” he asked. Before Harry could tell him he’d rather go to bed, Malfoy had grabbed his arm to tug him along the passage that led to the dungeons. Their footsteps echoed along the stone and the lights cast an eerie light. They reached the portrait hiding the entrance to the Slytherin common rooms and Malfoy turned around to look at Harry. They stared at each other for eternity, both at a loss for what to say.
Practices were often windy, cold, and wet as October became November, but Harry pushed his team nonetheless. They were flying well together when they could get Hannah to focus long enough to block the Quaffle. Ginny could often be heard called Hannah “Ronald.” Despite her lack of finesse, she got the job done, and really, that was what Harry cared about.
Molly pulled Harry into a tight hug that only a mother can give, already commenting that he needed to eat more and how good it was to see him again. Arthur gave Harry a hug as well, but he was a little more subdued than usual. Fred’s death had hit him hard.
,” but smiled thankfully anyway.
He didn't want to hear this.
it had been inward.
“Troll! In the dungeon! Thought you ought to know…” he yelled before slumping against his boyfriend who shoved him off, laughing. The eighth years cackled at the impression, but the rest of the Great Hall went up in furious whispers.
Malfoy wasn’t hard to find in his black Muggle clothes and silvery blonde hair. Harry quickly joined him, setting the glasses down.
. “You can specify what day and time, too,” she said, which convinced Harry. Merlin, he loved magic.
“Hey, it’s better than Harry obsessing over him, let’s be honest. Come on, Ginevra, let’s leave them be.”
hello! so if u ever pay any attention to the tags, youll notice i changed the main pairing. while writing the last chapter, i came to the realization that this isnt a hinny fic. while i adore hinny and believe its an amazing ship, i personally dont see it happening in this fic. in my opinion, very few relationships will last through the war. its simply just too much to return to that simple, childish love harry and ginny shared during their sixth and fifth years. but harry and draco have a lot of similar traumas they can bond over. i dont think this will become a relationship fic, i think i'll explore the relationship as it develops over the course of the story. itll probs be awkward dates in hogsmeade with The Gang and more silent nights in the kitchens. As for Ginny, i honestly dont feel like shes the settling down type.
“Why do you have
“Ron, I’m not stopping you from going—”
“I don’t think that works with you,” Draco said archly.
Harry readjusted his suit again as he made his way up to the giant museum. It was an old castle full of old art Harry could only vaguely appreciate, but this was the annual Malfoy charity gala and he had promised to go. Fight or not, this was important to Draco, so he would go.
“Harry…” Draco said, dropping his bag by the door. His boyfriend sat on a log not too far from the entrance, his head in his hands, his shoulders shaking with sobs. He moved to sit next to him, but was unsure how he would respond to touch, so Draco just calmly sat next to him, waiting for whatever it was to pass.
Draco moved towards the door, probably to get ready for the day, but Harry hesitated. He knew he needed to get ready. They did have a long day ahead of them… But the idea of being alone had suddenly become riddled with crippling anxiety. While Molly and Andi had often helped him through his nightmares and the horrible hours following, once they left, he was always alone.
“For old times’ sake,” he said with a cheeky grin. Harry opened the rest of his gifts slowly until all his presents had been opened, save one. Draco’s.
“Always one for a good scene,” Hermione muttered. She turned away to keep Harry from seeing the smile on her face.
said, “I’m here for you.” To what extent did he mean it? Only one way to find out.
fair warning: it's gonna get angsty really quick next chapter!! and it's gonna stay that way for a while. because for me, this fic is a way to express how fucking WRONG it was that CHILDREN fought a war because the adults were too afraid. and we get a lot of how harry is and isnt deal with his ptsd (and it leans to the "mostly isnt dealing" category).
“It was only two weeks, love. I’ve been on business trips longer.” Draco gasped as Harry moved to kiss his neck. His hands reached under Draco’s shirt, pressing his hands flat against his chest.
Together they slowly stood and stretched the aches from sleeping on the floor off. Harry watched his boyfriend stretch, a slow grin spreading across his face. Draco was his
“Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor has won the match!” Dennis’ voice was drowned out by the screams of the Gryffindor crowd. Harry landed amid the two teams, the Hufflepuffs shaking hands and congratulating Harry’s team on their win. Ginny ran up and jumped on Harry, yelling and kissing his cheeks before running off to celebrate. It was only the first win of the season, but it had been the first real game where there was nothing to stop them from only feeling the exhilaration of the game.
The first task was to lay Teddy down for a nap. The second was to start painting. The base coat went on easily enough, but the rest of the house took days. Of course, Harry insisted on doing it the Muggle way, which just made it take longer. But slowly, the house became more and more friendly.
“Gotcha!” Harry said as scooped the small boy into his arms. After a brief standoff with the tiny monster, the pants were removed from his head. The monster was then promptly released to wreak havoc elsewhere, and Harry turned to Draco with the pants in his hands, an eyebrow raised.
They walked up the stairs together before parting reluctantly in the hallway, saying their goodnights and going to their respective rooms. Draco made his way up the stairs slowly, trying to suppress a grin. Once in his room, he flopped onto his bed to stare at the ceiling in wonder, his heart and thoughts racing. He was dating Harry Potter. Harry Potter was dating him. They were a couple. His wildest dream had come true. All of those hearts in his notebooks weren’t entirely useless daydreams.
Across the pitch, Harry spotted the Hufflepuff Beater who hit the bludger grinning. He spun his Firebolt around sharply, already yelling out for Coote and Peakes to do their jobs better before speeding off around the pitch again. Any hint of the Snitch was now lost to the wind after his near miss. A smart play by the Beater, but still annoying.
“You are so like your father. He would be proud of you, Harry. I hope you know that,” McGonagall said as she looked at him over the edge of her glasses. “Come by my office after dinner and I’ll get you the paperwork. You may be like your father, but you are going to do this one thing properly. Good day, Mr. Potter.”

Harry’s eyes widened as Hagrid talked. He’d known Remus was a werewolf? But the more Harry thought, the more it made sense for Hagrid not to care. People thought of Remus and Hagrid the same, as if they were less than.
“I need help, Draco…” Harry’s voice was soft when he spoke up again. “The nightmares are worse, and things keep happening during the day… Sometimes it’s hard to remember where I am...” His voice trailed off and his shoulders slumped as he seemed to admit defeat. To admit weakness.
“Nah, mostly the older wizards. Does your dad own anything that
“After I stormed out dramatically and walked down their driveway, Draco tried to defend his mother, and then I yelled at him and then stormed off dramatically and Disapparated.”
“Hey!” His indignant cry was still muffled by Ron’s shoulder and Harry could feel Ron laugh a little at him.
to hear how flawed and
“Me, the dramatic one?”
“Maybe,” he said in lieu of a real answer. Because honestly, Gryffindors outnumbered him on Christmas anyway. But the toddler monster had decided, so his decision was final.
The wizarding community was so used to using magic, they never bothered to even
Pushing all of that aside for brighter things, Harry scanned the room for Ron.
They spent the next part of their morning mostly glued together. Harry showered, Draco providing idle conversation in the bathroom from his perch on the sink. He talked about Charms and what he wanted to do once he was done with Hogwarts, but in an abstract sense, and that he was actually really looking forward to their next semester at Hogwarts. He continued the conversation while Harry dressed in his room, while Draco showered and Harry sat on the toilet, and while Draco dressed. Harry, for once, didn't seem to be in the mood for mindless chatter, so Draco provided it for him.
Six years, they’d stayed and fought. Six years of continuous war, hiding and fighting, and dodging spells and bullets alike. When they’d realized Voldemort couldn’t be defeated, that he would eventually absorb the rest of the Isles, even the Boy Who Lived had fled.
“We spent so much time in our fifth year in there, and then again when the war started. Itt was a safe space. A base. Home. But now it won’t even open its doors when it feels like we need that place more than ever. It’s...weird,” she said again.
Without ceremony, Harry burst through the door, startling Draco into shouting. Harry forgot for a moment why he’d run in while Draco’s exclamation registered.
“Professor, do you mind if I ask you a question?”
Draco threw his head back and laughed as they walked through the entrance. “As if, Potter.”
“Okay.”
because the pipes are banging too loud for your liking!”
Draco had waited until almost everyone was gone, wanting to speak to Harry about his offer to visit/stay at the townhouse. He quickly grew disheartened as the station cleared of witches and wizards, and he had yet to catch sight of the Boy Who Lived or any of his friends.
Sleep came easily for the first time in months.
“I’ve been better,” a familiar voice said. It was more gravally than normal, but still his.
“Harry!” Andi came down, a small blue haired boy in her arms. Harry grinned and took Teddy from her, kissing all over his face. The baby laughed and attempted to grab Harry’s glasses from his face. Draco watched them, awkwardly standing in the doorway as the happy family reunited. Andi told Harry she’d see what she could get together for tea, but as she made to turn away, she finally noticed Draco standing awkwardly.
“I had no idea the work and sacrifice it would take to be married to Lucius, to raise Draco. There were many times I wondered if I would ever be enough for her. But having been through it all,” Narcissa said as she stepped forward, and to avoid falling to his death down the stairs, Harry took two steps down, avoiding the ice in Narcissa’s gaze. “I know this much: You? Will never be enough for my son.”
Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Harry was all-too-familiar with the whispers of these people. He spent most of his Hogwarts days being the center of any and all gossip, so he knew when he was being talked about.
AS OF 3/28/2021: THIS CHAPTER HAS BEEN UPDATED
Harry was standing now, looking at McGonagall in the winged chair. As he glared at her, his chest heaving a little from yelling, she took a long sip of her tea before placing the cup and saucer on the table. Her eyes met his, and Harry expected anger or the look she got before admonishing him, but there was only sadness.
I share? My family was being held hostage by a monster that could read our minds!
“Alright, everyone! In the air!” he shouted, swinging onto his broom.
“There’s nothing wrong with not hiding,” she said. “Just wish the
“Sometimes I forget,” he whispered when Harry couldn’t find anything to say. “I forget he’s not here anymore, he’s never coming back, that I
“It’s your fault I was woken so unceremoniously,” Draco said with a roll of his eyes, putting his palm against Harry’s face to push him away. They struggled for a few minutes, Draco trying to keep Harry as far away as he could before he relented and let Harry kiss him.
“So what is the hard part?” Harry asked, a little more scared than he was previously.
“I only know how to in theory… The Arithmancy
He slowly glanced over to, sure enough, see the blonde leaning against Harry, asleep. Harry was tucked against his side, a protective arm wrapped around his shoulders. Draco’s wand rested on the floor next to him, within easy reach of his hand. He snored quietly from where his head rested against Harry’s, and Harry smiled. Slowly, he moved to lean up and kiss Draco’s cheek.
“Things are… starting to bleed together. It’s becoming harder and harder to remember that there isn’t a war going on still. It’s like my memories are bleeding out into my life… Running from Snatchers, waking up at dawn to keep moving... I catch myself setting up the protective spells around my room before I go to sleep.”
“Ready?” he asked in a low voice. Draco nodded, trying to keep his mouth from falling open. Together, they walked into the evening air, ambling towards a pub a couple of blocks over. Harry made comments about some of his favourite Muggle places to go for fish and chips, coffee, a nice lunch.
Bill shook his hand with a grin, and a pregnant Fleur kissed his cheeks. Molly and Fleur hustled off to the kitchen, while Bill and Arthur stepped into the dining room to get out of the way of the rather large group of people at the base of the stairs. Charlie stepped into the fill their spot, and Harry laughed in surprise.
"That can’t be all of it!” Hermione cried, leaning forward and digging her finger into Harry’s ribcage. “Where did they insult your mother?!”
Not really knowing what was waiting around the corner for him, Harry rushed into the fray anyway,
“Well, dear, I’ve been married to a Muggle-born for a long time… And he taught me to appreciate doing things for yourself like the Muggles do. There’s just something about setting up a fire yourself, watching the match spark and catch on the logs. It’s so much better than doing it with your wand.” She smiled sadly at the memory of Ted, and Harry moved closer with Teddy. Andi stood as the fire finally caught and took Teddy from Harry’s arms before settling herself next to Hermione at the table. Harry looked down at the fire, deep in thought.
“I see you made the front page, Draco,” Molly smiled as she handed him and Andi a large bowl of carrots. He ducked his red face to focus intently on the carrots and peeler. She laid her hand on his shoulder, her whole demeanor radiating motherly warmth.
running from a war is never easy
He was just too fucking tired.
“Well, after the first class in the D.A. room, I went to see Winky because I had forgone lunch to prepare. The Room was being testy. I wanted to make sure it opened reliably and without attitude. Not easy, by the way. It was still testy after the Fiendfyre.” Ron nodded sagely, remembering how the fyre tore through the room, leaving nothing in its wake.
“Harry, you don’t understand,” Draco pleaded, looking at Harry with what he hopes is the right expression of regret and pleading.
“Nah, I’ve got him. Put some tea on, please?”
They hadn’t said those three words yet. It felt much too soon. With everything that had happened in the last year, it felt like too much. And yet…
The Bowtruckle scrambled down Hagrid’s beard and leapt across the table in a few bounds. Once she’d reached Harry, she climbed his shirt and his neck until she sat in his hair. Smiling, Harry watched her while Hagrid went on with his stories.
? When he turned back around to face him, Harry looked shy and unsure.
Narcissa didn't say anything, and there an awkward silence. Andi was the first one to break it by inviting her sister to lunch. Narcissa hesitated. The welcoming invitation was obviously the last thing she had expected. She hadn’t talked to Andromeda is
his parents were. It wasn’t until Harry looked down at his watch that he realized how long he’d been sat there. He raised his arms over his head, stretching. Fang snored loudly from his bed next to Hagrid’s, and the Bowtruckle had long since fallen asleep in Harry’s hair.
And it was
because Harry wasted two years of his life thinking he could.
3/28/21: ...did i add 3k to this chapter. yes, yes i did.
“If you wanted to go on a date, Potter, all you had to do was ask,” Malfoy snarked from the door. Harry startled, unaware he’d been talking out loud. He turned to see Malfoy standing in the open portrait door. His cheeks were red from the chill outside, and he looked more tired than usual.
“What was the rebellion like at Hogwarts?” Lucy Hornswallow asked excitedly, leaning forward. Neville hesitated and looked over at Harry. He really wasn’t used to the hero treatment, but Harry gave him a small nod to continue. Neville knew more than Harry did, of course.
“Yeah, yeah, love you too. See you Wednesday,” Harry grumbled as he shuffled out the door. The latch clicked back into place and Hermione dissolved into giggles almost immediately.
“How can I make Draco understand? This isn’t something where I can just cry about my feelings and be better before Easter! There is so much pain, and anger, and grief, and guilt, and fear all the time… And Dumbledore said that these feelings made me human and I told him that I didn’t want to be human… And I meant it. What’s the point if all I’m going to feel is like shit all the time.”
Harry returned quickly with two pints, settling down across from Draco.
The main doors opened easily for Harry, but what stood on the other side was a little less easy.
“The best I’ve had,” Draco murmured honestly. When he looked at Harry, the white lights from the tree illuminated Draco’s face, giving him a kind of glow that Harry wanted to bask in for a while.
Silence stretched between them awkwardly. Draco had
When Draco still didn’t respond, his gray eyes blinking owlishly at Harry, he stood awkwardly to leave. As he shut the door, he cursed. Maybe he and Draco weren’t friends like he’d thought. Maybe they were just thrown together by circumstance and now they wouldn’t have to talk to each other. They used to hate each other, so this was familiar territory.
“Draco?” Harry asked in a soft voice. Draco stopped in his tracks to the door. He was taken aback by his...
Andi walked in with a tea tray laden with snacks, another one floating behind her with the teapot and other paraphernalia behind her.
“I’m sorry you found out this way, Draco.” Harry leaned into the shoulder not currently occupied by Teddy’s head and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry.
The small gold ball flickered above the heads of a group of Slytherins but Harry didn’t see them. He only saw the Snitch. Pulling upwards on his broom, he skid to a stop at the last second, inches away from the Slytherin sitting in front of him. Harry closed his fingers around the cold metal, feeling the wings retreat into the gold edges.
“Two pints of butterbeer and two shots of firewhiskey, if you please.” He handed her the coins and she set about pouring their drinks.
Staccato drum beats sounded from somewhere outside as Harry yanked Draco close. Hot breath passed between them as they dragged out a heavy, heady kiss. Tongues languidly intertwined as their hands twisted in clothing, desperate to keep the other close.
“Andi, is it possible that Walburga put protections on her painting against Muggle means?” he asked quietly over the din of dinner being served.
the problems Bill does and could have faced if things had happened differently. I can’t imagine them letting Bill do the job he loves as a werewolf. And then there’s Lavender… We may not have ended things properly, but she doesn’t deserve to have her life destroyed like this because of the War.”
“What happened to me wasn’t bloody luck. It was a system that failed me and a group of fucking
He slowed his pace as he reached the far end of Hogsmeade to admire the murals that had been painted on the long wall following his path into Hogsmeade. The familiar faces and words on it brought him a small measure of comfort, and he smiled. But as he reached the end of it, he noticed an interesting new addition with a familiar blond standing in front of it.
Harry had fallen into a deeper sleep than intended because the next thing he remembered was Draco gently running his hands through his hair and gently nudging him, speaking softly. “It’s time for lunch, Harry, and then you have a class to teach.” Harry grumbled as he stood and stretched off the sleepiness. Draco quickly packed up their things with a wave of his wand and together, they made their way back to the castle.
“I’m not sure why I even added it,” he said, shaking his head as he threw himself haphazardly into a chair in her office.
“I was wondering about the Animagus transformation, Professor.”
Andi went with him to buy the paint, Teddy in tow. Thankfully, it didn't take too long to order all of the colors they needed. As they made their way to the till, Andi stopped Harry to point out another bucket of paint.
Unable to put whatever this feeling was into words, Draco dragged Harry close for another kiss.
Everyone at the table shared worried looks over Harry’s head, but didn’t comment. Hermione mouthed to leave him alone, and the other Gryffindors nodded. They remembered Harry in fifth year. and they really didn’t want to upset him anymore than he might already be. Draco had no issues, however, causing a scene with Harry.
and now his family was dying.
Harry thanked him again and wandered his way back up to Hogwarts. He crawled into his bed that night and he smiled as he drifted off to sleep. For the first time in his life, he felt like he knew his family. Not just as the legends everyone thinks they are, but as the people they were.
“And we had Christmas at Grimmauld Place, remember? The entire Weasley clan was there?” she said.
Together, they made their way from the Great Hall. Draco was staring straight forward, his chin tilted up in that “I’m better than you” way Harry was used to. Harry, on the other hand, kept sneaking glances at Draco. He was trying to gauge how upset Draco might be and what Harry might have to do to apologize and make it up to him. They walked towards a small grove of trees near the edge of the lake, and Harry hated the gap between them.
“I’m not sure what to do with this, though… It’s bugged me all semester. It’s got space enough that Andi said I should make it a loft and let someone rent it. Or I could make it into a playhouse for Teddy… Who knows, it’ll come to me.” Shrugging, he turned to walk back down the stairs. Probably to make tea.
After several minutes of snogging in the alley, Harry pulled away to ask if Draco wanted to go back to the townhouse to talk about
They walked dejectedly into the kitchen, Hermione taking a seat at the kitchen table while Harry picked up Teddy, bouncing him around and allowing the little tyke to gnaw on his potion-free fingers while he paced the kitchen.
“That’s reassuring coming from my best Chaser,” he said, smirking faintly. The normality felt nice after being stuck in his head for too long.
leave a kudos (if you haven't already <3 ) and you can always always ALWAYS leave a comment!
“Look at Ronald, having more than the emotional range a teaspoon,” Harry teased, pulling out of the hug. Ron laughed and told him to fuck off. Their conversation was lighter after, but Harry felt so relieved Ron didn’t hate him for becoming a thing with Draco.
“Alright, let me just tell Andi we’re going out.” Draco watched him leave the room. After realizing he’d been staring at Potter’s ass, he came to his senses and ran upstairs to change out of his lounge clothes and into something worthy of actually being seen in.
before he started blowing things up. Again.
“And what is it that you do? All Draco will tell us is that you’re involved in sales. I assume you’re working within one of his family’s companies?”
on choosing the paint alone. After agonizing over paint chips for days, Andi asked why he hadn’t looked at magic paint.
The next morning, the boys went into town for breakfast. A greasy spoon, somewhere no one could find them, recognize them. They spent their day pretending to be normal, to be happy, to be without the crushing weight of expectations.
“What is it?” Draco responded equally as quiet. He walked back to Harry, feeling like this was a conversation to be had in close proximity. He stopped when they were close enough together Harry could see where Draco’s blue eyes became gray. Harry leaned into him, resting his head on his shoulder with his arms hanging at his side.
,” she said with a wicked grin.
“Thanks for not hating me,” Malfoy said in between a poorly contained laugh. Harry grinned and looked at his ex-enemy and said, “Thanks for not always being an asshole.”
“Right, Professor!” Seamus shouted around a mouth full of eggs.
“That was a bloody good catch if I do say so myself.”
Harry muttered a few words and unlocked the door with a key. They walked in, Harry calling out “Teddy, Andi, I’m home!” before dropping his trunk by the door. Fear seized Draco as he remembered Walburga screaming at any disturbance, even if it had been a pure-blood that caused it.
“Draco, why are we going in here?” Harry finally croaked as he registered the temperature difference.
“A gap year is used for that exact purpose, Potter,” Draco drawled with a fond roll of his eyes. Harry looked at Draco, pulling his arms into to make a pillow for his head.
Harry turned his head as he laughed so he wouldn’t spray his beer on Draco. After several minutes of coughing and laughter, he turned back to Draco. “You can’t say things like that,” he gasped, chugging the rest of his pint. “Your father never wearing pants is
The open window drew in cold air and someone’s delicate music, wrapping their hot bodies in a softness that wasn't reflected in their movements. Sharp gasps and long moans drowned out everything else, thoughts of war and death and failing governments.
The sobs tore out of his chest like screams, lost in the roar of the thunder. His best friends. Gone. And Ron, the other Weasleys, dealing with it without him… Sometimes he felt like a coward, leaving. But the whole nation had looked to him. At twenty years old. For guidance. For help. To win a war that they’d already lost. But he
“Fine!” Harry said,
“Professor…” Harry started hesitantly. He and McGonagall were on a more even footing now that the war was over and all was said and done, but he still felt like a first year when he looked at her sharp eyes and stern face.
“You think so?”
. Afterward, we rarely interacted. Passed each other in the halls, sure, saw each other at meals, of course. But then the Quidditch game… I’ve always been a bit weak for Quidditch players,” he said with a bit of a blush.
“I have to grab my jacket and wallet, so either you can come with me, or you can just wait here. There’s a party in the common room, so someone might notice you hanging around outside,” Harry threw over his shoulder as he made his way up the stairs. Malfoy didn’t follow, and Harry felt a weird feeling settling into his chest.
“Are you ready for the fall out of holding hands with
“I… wasn’t sure if I was still mad at you.” Harry shrugged, looking away as he took a drink of his champagne.
had to cement their legacy, after all.
“You don’t have to be,” Draco whispered right back. Together, they headed toward the dungeons, barely a space between them.
“Harry, don’t, you’ll--!” Draco whispered-yelled, his eyes darting to the...non-existent portrait of Mrs. Black. “What?”
Standing from her pile rather quickly, she fixed them with a glare that would make Molly proud before stalking off. Finally he rolled over to look at the man who was sharing his bed, leaning in to kiss him.
That night, they settled into an old abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the rest of town. The door on the old wooden cabin creaked open to reveal a well-loved interior. A worn leather chair sat in the corner, the floral couch worn in one spot more than the others, close to the leather chair. Blue flower curtains fluttered with the breeze the boys had introduced, sending dust swirling across the floor.
this one is longer than most the rest lmao but its still too short imo
“The muggle technology would interfere with--” Draco started with an exasperated tone. How often did they have to over this?
They became anxious, though, as the match drew nearer and their Keeper was late.  At almost the last minute, she ran into the locker room amid grumbles from her other teammates. She hurriedly changed into her robes while Harry ran through the last few plays for the game, and then they were out onto the pitch. Screams and cheers and Luna’s lion hat’s roar met their ears and Harry grinned, waving at Hermione and Neville where they cheered next to Luna. He moved to shake the Hufflepuff Captain’s hand, managing to return her smile before mounting his broom.
“I never thought about it like that,” he said honestly. The conversation came to a close and Draco watched Harry for a few more minutes, reveling in the quiet clatter of the dishes and Harry’s even breathing.
“There are people looking to meet you.” Her voice was stiff and awkward, more so than it had been two weeks ago at the family dinner.
“Well…” Harry launched into a long series of stories about Quidditch and his classes in the old D.A. practice room, and anything he could think of that wasn’t what being back at Hogwarts actually felt like to Harry. Or Draco.
“Would you mind?” Draco asked in a small voice. Facing his parents was hard enough during the summer, but the holidays are meant to be about family. Which… they didn't feel like anymore.
, from one of the most brutal Dark Wizards of our time, Harry. You are a hero, whether you believe it or not.” With a flash of her green robes she was in the fireplace and the words
,” Harry said to the Fat Lady, who inclined her head as she swung open. Harry walked into the fray of the party, ducking his head to evade notice. Once he’d escaped into his dorm, he grabbed his jacket, wallet, and Invisibility Cloak. The Cloak settled across his shoulders and made his way slowly back towards the portrait hole. Hermione turned her head as Harry slid past her, but she didn’t say a word, she just turned around and continued talking to Seamus and Dean.
and like it was this amazing thing to be apart of a rebellion with

wanker then it can’t happen.”
“Hiding from someone?”
An uncomfortable shuffling rippled through the crowds at the mention of the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry swallowed the lump forming in his throat at the memory of little Colin, who would
Hey! It's been a while! I was going through my WIPs and found this! Figured I'd try and finish it while I have the spoons.
Wide open desert surrounded the couple for miles, stretching on, orange and red, ad infinitum. A comforting sight. Harry revved his bike again and pushed her to go even faster, chasing the sun across the horizon.
they were sat here discussing
Andi and Narcissa descended the stairs, Andi looking like herself and Narcissa looking like Andi in acid washed jeans and a frumpy, brightly coloured sweatshirt. Narcissa tugged at it awkwardly before meeting her son’s eyes. It was strange seeing his mother in anything except the “proper” clothes. She looked like Mistress Malfoy then. Now, she looked like his mum.
“Absolutely right,” Molly said, brandishing a spoon in Narcissa’s direction. “After all we’ve been through, you two are the perfect balm for everyone. You two will be the poster child for new growth in healing, just you wait.”
Draco gaped at Harry for a moment. He wanted to be offended, to defend his customs like he always had. But his
All of these places were important to Harry, for various reasons. Some he avoided. Others seemed to call out to him, wanting to return him to a simpler time when You-Know-Who had simply been a bad dream to children.
“I’m removing your painting and making sure none of it can be salvaged. Now SHUT UP!” Harry slammed the curtains against her screaming that had started once he’d threatened her. Exhaustion washed over him and he slumped against the wall, glad her screams quieted in the darkness of the curtains.
The kiss was tender, but desperate. Draco could feel Harry holding back, but he’d been waiting too long for this. Harry could be hesitant later. He nipped at the Chosen One’s lip, licking into his mouth. Harry felt Draco grin against his mouth when he moaned, moving his hands to the blond’s hips. When Draco bucked up against, Harry smirked like a tosser and pulled back. He was breathing heavily, his lips slightly swollen, and he looked gorgeous in the low light of the alley. He could only stare at him for a minute, unable to believe Harry Potter just kissed him. Someone he used to hate with all of his being. Just
“You can leave now. I’m awake.” She still didn’t move, and Harry rolled his eyes. Maybe breaking up with Ginny was a bad idea… Now he had been relegated to sibling status, which meant days like these.

look on his face. “I work in a muggle bookstore in downtown London. I don’t need to work for a living, but I like it. It’s cozy and calm, and after the war, that was nice.”
“Like what?” he asked again in a low voice. Draco hummed his response, unable to voice it as his breath became a little shakier. Harry leaned in slowly. One hand rested on the back of the makeshift log couch and the other cupped the back of Draco’s head. Their lips met slowly, reverently. Draco melted into Harry, groaning quietly at the slow pace his boyfriend had set. Harry smirked against him, nipping his lip.
“Professor…” Harry said slowly. His eyes darted to the open Great Hall doors. Through them, Harry could see Draco’s silvery head among the sea of students. They really needed to talk… When McGonagall delicately cleared her throat in that way that demanded his attention, Harry snapped his eyes back to her stern face.
“Mmm…” he responded, trying to remember what exactly they’d been talking about before they’d started this particular activity.
The next morning, just hours after the sun had made its way over the horizon, Draco and Harry readied their motorcycle, ready to head out once again.
looked, even young Fleur.
But one Sunday afternoon in late April, rain kept the students inside for the day. Harry stowed the map in his pocket. He'd finally reached a corridor empty of his friends, so he stuck his hands in his pockets to meander down the window-filled corridor on the sixth floor. When the acrid smell of spellwork hit his nose and screams reached his ears, all of the breath seemed to leave his body. The light in the corridor seemed to darken, the oil lamps along the walls the only thing keeping the world from plunging into absolute darkness.
Several minutes passed before a highly polished door appeared to rise from the stone, brass fittings gleaming in the light of the torches along the wall. Smiling, Harry opened the door to find the same well-furnished room he’d taught an army of kids to fight in. The thought hit him like a bag of stones, but he left the door open and turned to face the curious students at the end of the hall. They hesitated until Harry beckoned the students to come into their temporary classroom.
,” Harry said as he scrambled from the kitchen into the bathroom to hurry through a shower.
. This stupid fucking war took
… Why couldn’t he remember what was going on? Had it really been a year?
than suitable, to put it kindly.
next is PROBABLY christmas
With no words, in sync, they found the other's hand, intertwining their fingers as they drifted to sleep, exhausted from it all.
“Why did you call up the old DA room?” Neville asked, coming to stand beside him to look at his parents, smiling and happy and whole.
“Well, about how to become an Animagus. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately, and it just seems right. I may not be certain about a lot right now, but this is one thing that feels sure.”
Draco lifted his pint, his head tilted to the side as he thought. “No, you know, I don’t think he does. I have never seen that man wear pants…”
“Draco!” he said in surprise when he caught sight of the Slytherin, who stood still, unsure of what to do. It’s not like he could run now. “Hey, listen,  about staying at Christmas--”
,” Ron hissed. They fervently looked to the doorway. If they stayed gone for too long, however, Harry would come look for them so he could mope around other people and complain.
as of 3/4/19 this work has been updated! sidenote: i'm apparently playing around with style a bit more, so if you see weird things that feel a little like stream of consciousness,  then it's entirely what harry's think (apparently, i don't make the rules). anything in italics is draco's bc technically this is Harry's story. draco just takes over from time to time. (ironically, i'm not the only author to struggle with this)
Laughter won out and Harry doubled over, snorting. Draco snatched them from his hands, his face cherry red.
“This looks different…” Draco commented. He’d only been there once before, when he was younger, but he remembered it being much more cloying and dark. But it was light and spacious and it felt like a home. Maybe that was all the kids’ toys scattered about, or the worn couch, or the warm fire. Whatever it was, Draco loved it.
Conversation stuttered to a halt when Narcissa swept into the kitchen wearing Andi’s muggle clothes again. Molly gaped at Narcissa, Andi smiled, and Fleur looked mildly confused at the whole thing. Teddy laughed, banging his toy on his tray, unaware.
“What about me?” Draco said, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. Harry laughed again, but it was warm and genuine. They sat in the warm silence that followed the not-so-subtle exchange, munching on chips and watching the football match.
already cast with a flick of his wrist.
. So, Harry ignored Malfoy’s baleful glare in lieu of scarfing down the amazing food in front of him.
By the time they were done with dinner, no one felt like moving to the living room to open presents, not immediately. Eventually, Teddy got tired of sitting and the low conversation. They all took that as their cue to move to the living room.
As Arthur sat, Harry stood, clearing his throat. “Happy Christmas, everyone,” he said. “Cheers, to us. To family!” Everyone lifted their glasses and took a drink to hide their tears.
“Harry?” a familiar voice said. He spun on his heel, coming face to face with his friends. Dennis Creevey looked between the group of kids and Harry awkwardly, before turning to talk to them quietly. Only half listening, Harry heard him tell them to run along and that he’d talk to them later with promises of tea and biscuits.
Draco shifted closer to Harry, their leather jackets creaking together. The blond’s sunglasses dug into Harry’s back in a comforting kind of way, the rumble of the engine a lullaby to them both.
“Draco, meet Teddy Remus Lupin-Tonks,” Harry said, moving closer to Draco. The baby laughed and blew a spit bubble; when it popped, Teddy laughed. Harry tried to draw his godson’s attention to Draco, turning his body awkwardly to manage the right angle. Curiously, Teddy leaned towards Draco, making grabby hands like he wanted to be held.
Tears sprung to his eyes as he thought about how close he was to constantly falling apart, that god-awful shitty feeling of dread sticking in his chest. They’d been in America for six months, but the idea of You-Know-Who still haunted them. Harry had managed to close off all mental access to Him and vice versa, but the nightmares weren’t His fault; the idea of Voldemort still haunted them, chased them across the open road.
Neville opened his mouth to say something but Harry walked towards the door, ignoring his friends’ requests for him to come back.
Harry kept the pace slow and deliberate until Draco was panting underneath him. When Draco let out a small moan, Harry pulled away and grinned. It wasn’t a pure grin, it was the one he had when he was up to something a little more devious.
Hermione stepped towards Harry slowly, the rest of his friends exchanging worried looks behind her. She held her hands out to show she meant no harm, her brow furrowed in concern for him. Harry shook his head, confused. Hermione looked different…
, and he really wasn’t ready to face the masses.
“Harry!” Hermione yelled, running over to him on the pitch and jumping to hug him, much as Ginny had. “Congratulations!”
“Well… It was hard. There was a lot of fear and uncertainty because of all of the Death Eaters in the school. They thought we would be easily cowed because our “saviour” was off in the wind. And we thought we could handle a few Death Eaters. We’d done it before, at least two years in a row. And the entire Army, plus a few other students, had staged a full-scale rebellion against Umbridge fifth year.”
“You’re a horrible example, Harry Potter,” Hermione laughed as they made their way down to the kitchen to pick up their picnic. They were silent as they stepped through the portrait and most of the way out onto the grass. As they settled on a blanket Hermione had stored in a familiar beat up bag, Harry looked at her solemnly.
Ron and Hermione loved Harry, had been through so much with him, but there was only so much a person could take. He ate cereal forlornly. He sighed all the time. He rarely changed out of his pajamas. Harry was currently curled up on the couch, staring forlornly at the TV as it cycled through Saturday morning cartoons when Ron tugged Hermione into their tiny yellow kitchen.
“Alright, Harry?” Andi said, peeking her head around the corner. “I heard
Harry walked through the stance, the spell itself, the wand work before focusing on the dummy.
When he had accidentally forced back against Snape hard enough to enter his memories, the memory he’d seen of his father had stung. He never wanted to believe his father was a bully. He wanted to believe James was always like he was in everyone else’s memories… But McGonagall had always been straight with him, and she’d mentioned before how his father was. Tonight, the off-hand mention of his family, of Sirius and Remus, made his heart ache. People rarely talked about his family to him, wanting to avoid any kind of awkward missteps. Without much thought, Harry headed down to the one place someone was willing to talk about his family.
“Maybe we should try burning the painting with Muggle fire,” Hermione said. She was obviously a little upset she hadn’t thought of it before.
“Hey mate,” Ron said as he stepped in from the dining room. Ron wrapped his ridiculously long arms around Harry, holding his best friend close. They hugged for several long moments. When they pulled apart, Harry felt embarrassment creep over him.
“I want the house to be bright,” Harry said, staring at the new paint chips they’d collected. “No more dark, cloistering colors. I don’t want Teddy to grow up like that.”
“Do you know how to go about creating a spell?” He ran his hand through his hair, his mind racing through any and everything he could think of that might remove Walburga.
“I was hoping to catch you being indecent so I could tell everyone, but instead I found you just being disgustingly cute and domestic. I can’t make a good story out of that!” She huffed but didn’t move.
Almost immediately, the door opened and a house elf ushered them inside. They walked through a long entrance hall, Draco leading the way to the dining room. To Harry’s surprise, it wasn’t just Lucius and Narcissa. Lucius’ brother, his wife, and their two children, and Blaise and Pansy were there.
“I can’t believe his mother said that!” Hermione said to herself for the hundredth time. Harry shrugged, slumping further onto the couch.
“The media attention will be atrocious, no doubt, but you can make a game of it if you really wanted,” Andi said with a glimmer in her eyes that was pure mischief. “Have fun with it. You deserve it. Everyone kind of does after the years we’ve had.”
“Ginny.”
“I am thinking about it, at least a little,” he admitted. Hermione was pulling an apple from the covered basket.
They parted ways and Harry carried his sleeping godson up to his room. As he laid him in the crib, his heart squeezed as he thought about how his parents must have felt about him. Such a tiny human being, not in his life for very long, but who meant everything to Harry. He understood why his parents stood against You-Know-Who instead of running again. Harry would stand against You-Know-Who again if it meant keeping Teddy safe.
as of 1/3/19 this has been updated!!
“Someone caught a photo of us kissing, Draco,” Harry said. “And so we made front page news.” Harry came to stand by Draco’s side, absently ruffling Teddy’s purple hair. Draco’s face rippled through confusion, understanding, anger, and confusion again. Andi showed him the front page and the rather...indecent...picture of them in the alley. His face turned red thinking of everyone that had seen it.
“Hey,” Harry interrupted gently. “I wanted to tell you that I’m proud of you.” Ron flushed and grumbled “Thanks
After Harry gave them a brief rundown of the night’s events, there was a stunned silence that lasts only long enough for Hermione to draw air in.
The warmth of the kitchens warmed Harry against the November chill and he relaxed marginally. The house-elves tripped over themselves to being Harry some warm pumpkin juice. He sat at the table, suddenly exhausted. The party in the common room seemed less and less ideal the longer he sat there. So many people at once and forced interactions with everyone… maybe he’d pretend to fall asleep here and not go. Or better yet, he could go down to the Three Broomsticks for a butterbeer.
.’ Then he left.
“They’ll work it out,” Hermione whispered as she stood, kissing Harry’s forehead.
“I’m sorry, weird?” Harry spluttered.
Instead of the slow wake up that Harry had intended, Draco jolted awake, knocking his head into Harry’s as he reached for his wand.
When he stepped in, Harry’s stomach growled as the comforting smells of
“It’s too bad you didn't take on your family’s company,” Nicholas said, quickly recovering. “If your father hadn’t married dirty, you just might have.”
“Then how do we get it to respond?” Harry threw a glare at the door, scowling slightly.
A few long seconds hung in the air as Harry tensed his legs for kick off. Madam Hooch blew her whistle and he rocketed into the air, flying high above the plays the Chasers had quickly set into motion with Ginny taking point. He kept an eye on his teammates while his eyes scanned the pitch, looking for the Snitch.
“It’s a lovely idea,” Hermione said. “It’d have the same effect on the students that the DA had.”
“This process is extremely difficult, Potter. It is a miracle your father and his friends didn’t end up with half transformations or worse. But you have guidance and you don’t have to scrounge for the supplies. I know how to acquire them.”
about him. Draco smiled, entirely enchanted with this tiny, slobbering mess.
that wasn’t the muggle fashion when he was born.”
doing things the Muggle Way.
Time was hard to keep track of in this quasi forest, but Draco knew it was a long time by the way his body started to ache from sitting on the log. Harry’s sobs slowly eased off, and now there was just the quiet sound of his ragged breath and the eerie wind that seemed to blow through the false trees. After centuries of waiting, Harry slowly started to speak.
“It happened just last night. It’s not like anyone except apparently, Andi knew, and I didn't expect to make the front page of the morning edition.”
“Thank you,” he murmured. “So much. This is perfect, and I love it.” Harry kissed him again for good measure. “I don’t think what I got you is going to stand up to this.” Draco laughed and told him he didn't care. He had too much stuff anyway.
as their leader. I have to walk past places that have
Harry offered a soft smile as he set the plate in front of Draco, then he kissed his forehead and sat across from him. They ate in relative silence, the music dancing around the room, the soft popping of the record player soothing the rough edges of their hearts a little.
“...How are you, mate?” Seamus asked tentatively.
“That’s dangerous work, Harry…” At the look on his face, she sighed but relented. “But I can ask around.”
kisses and tears and regret
“Sorry I haven’t Flooed in, or even written,” Harry said, looking sheepish. “Been a bit busy.” Which was an understatement, but Harry hoped Ron would at least hear him out, if not forgive him.
boxers were currently being worn and it honestly drove him a little mad.
What was there to understand? Obviously, this, whatever
Sometimes, it all became too much. He would escape to try and get the Room of Requirement to open so could properly escape. But a door never appeared. No matter how much he begged and pleaded, it stayed firmly closed.
“Yes,” Harry said grudgingly, trying to hide his smile though Ron didn’t bother to hide his. He leaned in closer to Harry, as if they were planning something. Memories of the many nights they’d sat like this, trying to stay alive drifted past. Harry reveled in how different things were now because
Hermione gladly claimed fifth and seventh years, excited to teach everything she knew on the Dark Arts. She took O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s seriously, and no one could help them better than Hermione.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry excitedly asked for details about what the world was like, now that You-Know-Who was gone. (Ron didn’t comment on Harry’s lack of use of You-Know-Who’s name, and he didn’t intend to.) Instead, Ron told stories upon stories of the joke shop and Hermione’s parents and what it’s like not being in school anymore. Harry couldn’t help but feel a little pang of jealousy at the variety in Ron’s life. He had moved forward while Harry did the same things he’d done for seven years. Inwardly, Harry laughed at the idea of telling Ron that The Harry Potter was jealous of
Draco nudged Harry slightly, pulling him from his reverie. Arthur stood up and cleared his throat, drawing attention from the side conversations around the room.
as always, many thanks to my lovely irene who helped me out of a few tight spots here and there. and this time, thanks to emmi and maddi who helped with one scene in particular
A slight glamor charm that Draco had taught him concealed his scar, made his eyes a shade darker and his hair a shade lighter. He really didn't want Draco to know he was here just yet. There were still things he wanted to be mad about and to have a row about, but this
, Hermione could hear the pout from the kitchen.
He didn't answer her question. There were more important things to talk about. “Andi, is there any way you know of to get rid of a Permanent Sticking Charm?” He asked, fiddling with the book in his hands.
“I’m not leaving,” Malfoy said brusquely, interrupting the tense silence.
“Took you that long to come up with that? I thought you were more creative than that,” Harry ribbed, grinning at Malfoy. He grumbled something back and Harry laughed. Malfoy had often just pissed Harry off, but now they’d agreed to make amends and move forwards, Malfoy was loads of fun to tease. Malfoy didn’t come up with any clever quips on their way into Hogsmeade and Harry led the way into The Three Broomsticks and told him to grab a table while he grabbed the drinks.
“Draco!” she said, a wide smile spreading across her face. “I’m glad to see you, dear.” Before he could issue the proper thanks, he was pulled into a tight hug.
“I love you too,” Draco whispered.
insensitive.
Harry’s eyes drifted to the Hufflepuff Seeker, waiting to see how she was approaching the Snitch. She seemed to be imitating Cho’s strategy. Cho had tailed him all during their match in third year, cutting him off when she thought it was opportune. The Hufflepuff Seeker seemed to understand Harry’s tactics a little less than Cho because she was circling lower than Harry and in an awkward pattern.
Harry wanted to apologize to his boyfriend, but he wanted to do it with a clear head. So he urged the Firebolt to go a little faster, a little further. The biting wind and exhilaration of flight helped sweep the worst feelings from his mind. He didn’t know how far he had flown, or for how long, but he finally felt a weight lift off his chest and Harry took a deep breath. It hurt to breathe too deeply, like he’d been underwater for too long, but it helped remind him he was in the here and now. Alive.
hello again!! i've really struggled a lot with this chapter. i know how harry feels, i can understand those feelings, but bc harry doesnt know how to voice them, neither do i. the next chapter is going to get really kind of confusing as i'm going to try to stay in only harry's head for the whole chapter while he tries to work through some of this
Harry was just about to open his mouth and say no thank you when Hermione interjected and said, “Professor, do you have the master schedule with you?”
“Mrs. Malfoy, those rings are gorgeous,” Harry said in his conversational tone, the one he reserved for boring meetings. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“Oh, happy day,” Harry replied. Together, they all returned to the kitchen and settled in again, smiles on their faces as they finished their dinner.
The music swelled as Harry roared down the road, a grin lighting up their faces as they felt the power beneath them bunch and release as they opened up on the long road.
“I knew your family wouldn’t like me! I prepared for that! I knew they would try to trip me up with social graces, so we practiced! But to insult my
“Alrigh’, Harry?” he asked, settling rock cakes down in front of Harry. Fang settled his head into Harry’s lap, and Harry’s hand started scratching his ears immediately.
“It almost killed me twice,” Harry replied brusquely.
He and Harry hurried through the corridors, making their way for the side entrance near the Herbology labs. The less people that saw them, the better. Harry hated the limelight, and he hated it even more right now. As they made their way past the labs, Draco talked about random things as he and Harry. He hoped that mundane things like how much Charms work he had to do before the term was over would help ground Harry. He hadn’t spoken yet, but his tight grip on Draco’s hand hadn’t lessened either.
“Ron? What’s up?” Harry stood from the couch, obviously gleaning this was a serious conversation.
Harry gave him a grateful smile because today, the students were full of questions about the War. He distracted as best he could. It wasn’t his most favorite topic of discussion, but Neville never seemed to mind it as much. The students dropped their games and gathered around the two student professors on the giant pillows.
Harry had launched into a story about how the boggart one of the upstairs rooms had turned into McGonagall telling Harry he was a failure as a wizard because he’d be unable to finish his time at Hogwarts, that he was worthless for needing an extra year.
“Troll! In the dungeon! Thought you ought to know…” he yelled before slumping against his boyfriend who shoved him off, laughing. The eighth years cackled at the impression, but the rest of the Great Hall went up in furious whispers.
Harry Potter, Malfoy?” Harry teased as they approached the castle doors. Draco scoffed, squeezing his hand gently. A few students had walked past them as they came closer and closer to the school. They turned to each other, whispering furiously about Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter holding hands, and you owe me five Galleons, Lucy.
“Oh, well, if that’s all then,” he said with a small laugh. Comfortable leaning into each other, it took a few more minutes for Draco to break it. “What happened last night?” he asked. Harry sighed, trying to keep the memories of the horrid dream from coming forward.
“Yeah, well, I felt like this scenario deserved a scene,” Harry snarked. When Hermione turned around, she had to bite her lip as Harry pouted.
“You look great, Mum,” Draco said with a smile. Kreacher grumpily announced lunch was served. Together, as an odd little group, they moved into the dining room. The table was set for four people and a toddler. Narcissa briefly looked confused at the lack of a head table, but settled next to her sister without a word. Harry placed Teddy on one side of him, while Draco took the seat on his other side. Teddy got to eat first, with everyone serving themselves once the baby was made happy.
He wanted this to be a surprise, so kept his voice low as he muttered, “
Today was one of those days when Neville knocked on the ornate door. The door was never closed, really. Harry allowed other students and professors to wander through as they wanted. It made him feel less pressured to take up every single minute of the students’ time and allowed others to satisfy their curiosity at the Boy Who Lived teaching Defense. Neville’s class had let out early, so he joined in on the games.
“Don’t leave me alone just yet, okay?” Harry mumbled into his shoulder. Draco smiled, wrapping his arms around Harry and hugging him close. Draco relaxed into the hug, relieved Harry had asked him to stay. He didn't want to be alone just yet either.
“Nice glamour,” Draco said as he took a sip, hiding his smirk poorly.
Molly had knitted him a tiny jumper, one that he could grow into over the next year or so. Charlie got him one of the tiny dragons Harry had received during the Triwizard Tournament. It blew steam from its nose and breathed tiny sparks of light rather than fire. After a few minutes of playing, it curled up next to Teddy’s leg and promptly fell asleep. Hermione had gotten him some muggle books for him to grow into, and Ron had thrown in a few wizarding classics as well. Harry and Andi thanked everyone while Teddy went back to playing with the little dragon. Harry moved to sit next to Draco on the couch, wrapping his arm around the blond’s shoulder.
“I said, you were really brave that night… Mum told me she’d spared you because you told her I was safe. That was brave too, but you went out to face Voldemort and no one is ever going to compare to that, Harry. That’s like the bravest thing ever....”
Draco handed Harry one of the glasses as he moved to lean against the wall beside Harry.
As if seeing the agreement on her sister’s face, Andi grabbed her hand and dragged her up the stairs saying, “Then let’s get you out of those stuffy manor clothes, Cissy. Come on, I have some stuff that’ll fit you.” Narcissa argued all the way up the stairs, but it left Harry and Draco alone (Teddy wasn’t paying any attention, so it was the same as being alone).
Even though he didn't have to, Harry took History of Magic again. Part of his wondered in Professor Binns even noticed there was a war.
i keep trying to finish this. but my friend, irene, keeps egging me on and multiplying ideas and what was supposed to be one and done is now three with possibly a little bit more
to have cost more than his entire vault. And that was saying something.
hello! im greatly enjoying this story, even though it's only two chapters long!! i hope you're enjoying it too!
“I’m going to become an Animagus,” Harry stated proudly. He even puffed out his chest a little.
“Harry, that battle was just the kids playing with different hexes and charms. No one was fighting,” Hermione explained. “The war is over and you’re safe.”
“Well, fuck,” Harry said eloquently. Andi snorted, before laughing out right.
“Meeting up with a mate, Rosmerta,” he said. The word felt weird to say, but it was true. He and Malfoy were mates, at the most. He felt that if he’d said “friend,” Malfoy would have come over to hex Harry before leaving in a dramatic scene. Harry chuckled to himself at the image before bewitching the glasses the float ahead of him.
, the eerily soft voice crooned through the static.
“Speakin’ o’ yer dad… He always go’ away with more with more than he shoulda, but James did learn. Once, in his fifth or sixth year, he had ‘is first detention with me. He said some horrible things, sure. It took time. Not a lo’, considering how much time he spent in detention, but with listenin’ to me ramble, he eventually became a bi’ kinder to me. Still took ‘im awhile to become the grea’ man he became, but he wasn’ all bad.”
The conversation came to a halt, though, so Harry had to swallow quickly before it became too awkward. “I came to see you because… Well, I wanted to ask you about my mum and dad. And Sirius. And Remus!”
“Come on, Malfoy,” Harry muttered as he slid from the booth, extending his hand to Malfoy. “Time to go.” In a rather childish gesture, Malfoy shook his head and refused to move. Sober Harry would have greatly objected to what slightly less sober Harry was about to do, but that was a problem for in the morning. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm and gently pulled him from the booth and placed his arm around Harry’s neck, Harry’s arm around Malfoy’s waist. Together, they made slow progress back towards Hogwarts.
“I refuse to believe every compartment is full to Saint Potter,” Draco said with a sneer. It wasn’t as malicious as when they were kids. He looked stunned by hearing those words come out of his mouth but didn't say anything. Harry didn’t say anything either, unsure of what to say. The silence turned stale between them as Harry sat on the bench across from him.
as of 12/10/18 this chapter as been edited. NOTE: IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REFORMATTED SO THINGS NO LONGER EXIST IN THIS CHAPTER, OR HAVE BEEN MOVED AROUND, PLEASE REREAD THIS CHAPTER
The first Quidditch game quickly snuck up on everyone. It was the first game since the war, and energy thrummed through the school. Most of it was excitement because it was the first real game in a long, long time. Some of it was nerves, mostly on the players' side. But nerves were the last thing on Harry’s mind. Even with the first match on the horizon, he couldn’t make himself feel even a fraction of the excitement he used to feel before games. He enjoyed flying, and he enjoyed the wind on his face as he sought the Snitch, but the game itself was rather bland to him at the moment. Winning didn't matter to him, though he knew it mattered to his teammates.
Draco found him in the library staring intently at some pamphlets that McGonagall had handed him earlier in the week, thinking exactly that. Draco could almost see the headache forming in Harry’s head as he stared at the flimsy pieces of paper.
“You mean theory? Well, it’s not my expertise, but I try to help them figure out the feelings behind their spellwork. As much as I hate to admit it, Bellatrix was right. To cast Cruciatus, you had to mean it… Well, after I’d figured that out, other spells became much easier when I focused on their intent,” Harry said with a slight shrug as if understanding magical theory was easy. And he’d taught it to fourth years. Like it was easy.
“That means you and Draco are in charge of last minute ornaments and presents for everyone else,” Andi said, already fishing for her shopping list in her purse. She also handed Harry a second list of people to buy small presents for and any missing decorations. Narcissa and Draco stared around them in amazement while the super important lists were handed around.
Harry didn't attempt to mask his pain when he said, “No,
Harry found himself picking at his food and falling out of conversations. He stared at his plate with a forlorn expression that caught Draco’s attention.
“Oh, like you can talk! I saw your doodles!”
Harry wandered through the gallery, snacking on anything that came his way and slowly sipping butterbeer. The gallery was impressive, for sure. He stopped to converse with the paintings occasionally, curious about their life in this castle, one without children. They told a few interesting stories, but in all honesty, they told him they were a little bored.
The Quidditch pitch provided an excuse to be close and friendly without anyone judging them too harshly. Of course, they were never alone, but it was a start. Alongside their regular, single team practices, Harry and the other captains organized small scrimmages against each other for extra practice. It had been years since most of them had flown in something other than battle formations. They needed the most practice they could get.
The flat was empty when he returned to the bookstore where he worked. Harry couldn’t figure out if he was happy or sad that Draco wasn’t there. He wandered into the kitchen to stare into the fridge, unsure if he was truly hungry. The color on the fridge made him do a double take. Their fridge was normally white, but this one was now covered in various colored post-its. Slowly, Harry walked towards the fridge to read the various notes. They were all in Draco’s hand.
“We should get to class,” Harry said into Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve missed all of them for the last few days.”
“If it doesn’t, then I’ll say I was wrong and we’ll get sloshed.” The laugh Draco let out made Harry smile. He pulled him closer, smiling at the light in Draco’s eyes. A tray floated past and Harry placed both of their half-empty glasses on it.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” she called, still staring right at Harry and Andi. Wide-eyed, Draco hurried into the living room, Teddy on his hip (
He left the locker room after a quick
The next morning at breakfast, Harry settled himself between Neville and Seamus. Wary looks were exchanged over his head, but he ignored them in favor of smiling at his boyfriend. He talked about Quidditch and anything else written about in the morning
In a halting, shaky voice, Harry read out, “We are a part of you until the very end.” His hands spasmed as he gripped the pillow. His fingers brushed over something on the back of the pillow. Curious, he turned it over to find four Gryffindor crests sewn onto the back of a soft black back. The shades of of the badges were varying, a prefect badge emblem sewn into one corner, Head Boy and Head Girl emblems are sewn into the other two.
There were hor d'oeuvres and alcohol that wove their way through the crowd with a charm and Harry
Discussions of papers and assignments and futures drowned out some of the Quidditch talk, and it gave Harry time to just exist contentedly before the match got underway. Once everyone had eaten their fill, Harry called the team to head towards the pitch. The laughter and camaraderie in the small locker room warmed Harry against the November chill.
. Harry, oblivious as always, kept up the conversation until they reached their destination.
Draco scoffed, turning his head away. “Again, I apologize for ruining your year.” His voice was stiff, his body held tightly.
tas always, leave comments and kudos! they help me a l o t
“Well… Not really, no. Thinking of getting rid of that old hag?”
“Malfoy, those days are over. I’m too bloody tired to fuel our rivalry, or whatever this was.” It was the first civil thing Harry had said to Malfoy in Merlin knows how long.
With a triumphant grin, Draco set the stylus onto the carefully chosen record, closing his eyes as a guitar started happily plucked along to various bird calls in the background.
Maybe he should just host it as his place...
“And?” Draco let his eyes drift from Andi to Harry, his heart aching at the thought of Harry suffering alone.
“I know your family isn’t… the greatest right now. So I want you to know that you can come stay at Grimmauld Place for the holidays, if you want. At least come over for Christmas dinner, if your family isn’t doing anything. Or… just come visit. Or something.”
this will probably update rapidly as i'm avoiding all my responsibilities at college, so stay tuned!
He had spent
“Isn’t there a spell for that?” Draco asked from where he stood leaning against the doorframe. As he spoke, he moved further into the kitchen, crossing his arms.
Exploration was mostly a bad idea, too. Parts of the castle were off limits to students, the magical residue from the Battle causing problems. The castle was healing too. So Harry decided it was best not to provoke the castle by roaming around, picking at healing wounds. So, the only area that held a tiny bit of interest was the kitchens.
“And you came up here to bother me why?” he said, glaring at her. He hadn’t actually moved his head yet, but Ginny could still feel it.
“You’re going to enjoy this, aren’t you?” Draco said, resigned.
“You asked about my rings. Lucius had them made when his mother wouldn’t give him the family rings. I wasn’t her first choice, my sister Andromeda was as the eldest child. She would have rather had Bellatrix before me. I wouldn’t make an adequate wife, she thought. Too delicate to bear children, too delicate to run a house. Of course, she had very good reason to believe that.”
Afternoon bled into night, and people slowly bade their goodnights and Flooed home. Molly and Arthur left first, claiming old age and long days. The rest of the Weasley clan followed shortly after. McGonagall said something about making sure the house elves got their presents before night’s end and left with Narcissa when Andi went to bed. Ginny, Neville, and Luna left together, caught up in some conversation, too busy to hear everyone bid them good night.
memories attached. I have to sleep in a bed and suffer through my nightmares and try not to wake my roommates because I don’t want that attention. Most days it’s hard to care about anything, even Quidditch. I don’t know what else to do. My entire life has been fighting You-Know-Who, and now that he’s gone… What am I supposed to do? I don’t know
Not for the first time that day Harry started crying. He thought he’d lost every connection to the people he’d loved. They had left nothing tangible for him, except the love that protected him. But Draco… The man he’d been with for all of two days officially, had created this for him. Before they’d been official. Because he knew how much it would mean to Harry.
“Hey!” Dean cried, looking at Harry indignantly. Harry laughed, shoving bacon in his mouth to avoid having to respond to Dean, who was grumbling about an “unfair Captain.” The conversation resumed normality around them.
trying, but there’s so much to do, to fix…” He trailed off, but Harry knew what he was thinking. So many people were lost during the war, so many jobs now unfilled because they’re corrupt or dead. Without much prodding, the conversation suddenly slammed to a halt as memories of their friends and family lost floated to the forefront. Ron took a deep, shuddery breath, and Harry swallowed his own tears. They looked down at their laps, thinking about different people and different what-ifs.
sorry for the sobbing u may have done, but not sorry bc Damn. this is a good chapter. I'm really proud of it, of all of it, and of the story i've created (this isn't the end, i'm just really fucking proud)
“Actually, I’d love to see the rest of the house. Andi was talking about it before I came in here, she said you worked all summer to make it
on’t understand.
Harry shifted his weight uncomfortably. He wasn’t sure where this was going, but he wished he was back in the dining room of French speakers.
Harry mumbled his thanks as he headed up the stairs to the expansive library. Andi watched him, frowning slightly.
he could do it.” Anger bubbled to the surface as Draco thought about how Dumbledore had groomed Harry for exactly that.
. That thought sent shivers down his spine.
if you're searching for us, you'll find us side by side
“Did you ever think of potions?” Hermione cut him off and Harry opened and closed his mouth quickly, brows drawing together. Then his face split into a grin and he hugged her.
Several stories later, Kreacher was informing them dinner was served. Harry picked up the now-awake Teddy from the pile of blocks surrounding him and carted him into the dining room. Everyone settled around the table and the chatter picked up almost seamlessly. Draco smiled sadly, wishing for the times when his family was like this. A family.
. Draco didn't look up from his carrots until his mother spoke.
“Tonight, we acknowledge the old while celebrating the new. All proceeds from tonight will be given to the R.J. Lupin Foundation for the Welfare of Werewolves. Please, enjoy the exhibit!” Draco said, raising his glass. Social convention required everyone to do the same, even though they weren’t sure what they were toasting to. Most of them wanted to be offended but they knew the Malfoys would cause them many more problems if they spoke against them, especially Draco.
“Just let me know if there’s anything I can do,” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand again. Harry squeezed back. Teddy squealed, then, smacking his high chair tray with enthusiasm. Mashed potatoes went flying as Andi scolded him, hastily cleaning up the spattered potatoes while Molly simply laughed. Stories of the chaos children caused started up and carried them through the rest of the dinner.
fucking finally. i've been trying to get here since i first wrote ch 7.... but here we are!!
“How would you propose we go about changing things?”
“What are you on about now, Malfoy?”
A few sixth years stopped in surprise to see Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy disappear down into the dungeons before hurrying up the stairs. Oh this just

“Draco?” he implored quietly, opening his eyes slowly. Draco stepped from behind Hermione, quickly closing the distance between them. He’d been worried that his face would set Harry back, so deeply entrenched in his memories. Hermione was a friendly face and always had been.
in lieu of a shower, catching up with his friends as they loitered outside. Neville recounted his favorite parts of the game with vivid details, Luna adding in her own comments from time to time. They discussed the match the entire way to the castle, but Harry left them to head to the kitchens, promising to catch up later. He was

Wands clattered to the floor and young voices shrieked. Six first and second years scrambled to each other, looking at Harry with wide, fearful eyes. The couple of fourth years standing with them shared a knowing look before dashing off down the other end of the corridor. Owlishly, Harry blinked and looked around the corridor. Where were the Death Eaters? They couldn’t have heard him coming… He shook his head, trying to clear it. Get the kids to safety, then go after the Death Easters. Their safety was more important. These kids needed to get to the Great Hall, they shouldn’t even
As the crowd dispersed to talk in whispers about what just happened, Harry wandered to the edge of the room, reeling. He leaned against the wall, struggling to process what all Draco had just said.
to get that woman out of his house. He often wrote Hermione for help, sending owls upon owls, until finally, Hermione showed up on their fire grate.
“There’s something you should--”
“Come on, you can do better than that!” a deep voice called out. A sharp red light and a cackle followed it. Pain hit Harry squarely in the chest and grief consumed him briefly.
“Do you want to hold him?” Harry stepped closer, like he fully intended to hand over the small child.
“You’re not that hard to figure out, Potter,” Draco said with a small grin. The fact that his boyfriend thought he was some enigma was hilarious to Draco. No wonder he was awful at Legilimens; his emotions and thoughts were written all over his face constantly.
The warm sun and damp breeze helped settle some of the pain that always seemed to dog him, and Draco’s hand in his always helped.
After their first, rather awkward time having a pint (and several shots) together, Malfoy seemed to loosen up around Harry much more easily. Of course, they still
hello! i hope everyone is enjoying this! i guess these arent really a part of a cohesive story?? theyre more of a set of one shots, so dont really expect one to tie into the next!
. Harry was pulled from his grief by a high pitched laugh following a green jet of light and a boy calling out, “Take him and go! It’s him!” Half-formed memories of his father standing up to face You-Know-Who flooded back to him.
“What did Malfoy do after that?” Ron asked, leaning forward to place his hand on Harry’s leg. Harry sighed and rolled his head to look at his best mate.
. For good. He’s never, ever coming back, and he’s not going to hurt anyone ever again.”
“What is it?” Draco asked in an even voice. When he stared into Harry’s eyes, something unidentifiable was reflected in the gray of his eyes.
“Perfect.” They both turned to watch whatever was on the telly. Draco was drawn into the football game, but Harry apparently couldn't stand the silence.
writers have no morals, honestly, even with Skeeter gone. How are you going to handle this?”
“You’re always welcome, Draco,” Andi whispered into his ear and Draco wrapped his arms around her tightly. She pulled away after a long moment, smiling brightly at him, promising something good for tea. Then she bustled her way into the kitchen, where Draco heard Kreacher ask what it is that was needed.
. A huge sense of relief washed over him.
“Andi… Why are you doing that without magic?” Hermione asked, thoroughly confused, drawing Harry out of his thoughts. Though Hermione had grown up Muggle as well, there was nothing more tedious than starting a fire without magic.
Fifteen students stared at him, blinking owlishly. “Er, now, pair up and settle the cushions around you. Try to disarm each other. I’ll walk through and help you as needed. On the count of three. One, two, three--” The acrid smell of magic filled the air as the spells went awry, causing books to fall and other objects to fly across the room.
“And this one is for George… Check the tag, dear, I don’t know who it’s from. Oh! And this one is for little Teddy… Ginny, this one is yours, love…” Molly handed out presents through a system of floating presents to their proper owner. Harry watched in fascination as a small pile built up in front of everyone; Harry’s pile was stacked neatly next to Draco’s.
“I’ll draft a letter, and we’ll take it on the anniversary, yeah?” Harry said in a quiet voice. Neville nodded in agreement. Both of them drifted off into their own thoughts about the upcoming anniversary. It was the first he’d willingly thought about the anniversary. It was a little under a month away. There were preparations underway for some kind of ceremony, but Harry had explicitly asked to be left out of them. The idea that it was only a year later was surreal for Harry and it hurt too much to think about.
Harry bade them a good night and continued meandering. The art was interesting, but overall, the night was a drag. He missed Draco being with him at these things. They could make snide jokes together and occasionally sneak off to make out in some closet. Merlin, he missed Draco.
warning: after christmas in the fic, things are going to get a little dark for a while. harry is NOT over what happened in the war and i want to discuss that in this fic. i'll try to tag the beginning of the chapter the PTSD flashbacks occur in and where you can pick up to ignore that PTSD stuff if you can't/don't want to deal with it.
The second week of the semester found Draco a little despondent and lonely. Harry’s friends didn't mind having him around, but… It just wasn’t the same without Harry there. It felt more like they were tolerating him than enjoying his company. Still, Draco made a point to sit with them at meals. While it was awkward with them, he couldn’t imagine going back to sitting alone.
Two weeks had been too long. In the last year, they had spent a large portion of it making out on the couch of whoever’s apartment they happened to be crashing in that day. Two weeks apart because of a row was awful, and he wanted to make sure it never happened again.
“I-- I’m nervous, is all…” She picked at her gloves for a few seconds before sighing. “I know, it’s a lame excuse. I’ll try harder.” Harry knew she was ernest and genuine but he turned to Ginny, Dean, and Demelza anyway.
Harry readjusted his suit again as they walked up to the steps. He’d met Narcissa and Lucius before, but he didn’t really think they’d like to remember the times they’d almost been responsible for his death. As if he could read his mind, Draco grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly. “It’ll be okay,” he reassured as he raised his hand to knock.
“Have you seen the
“Will it work?” Draco asked in a small voice, fiddling with the ring on his finger. Harry ran his hand along Draco’s cheek, looking at him earnestly. Draco’s family may not be the greatest in the world, but Harry never doubted that they loved their son, not once.
As the effects of their night at the pub, their kisses grew more urgent and desperate. Whimpers and moans filled the cheap motel room as Harry and Draco dragged each other impossibly closer until there was nothing to separate them anymore.
“No! Never, Draco. Never. I just wished you had
The next day, Harry ran after Professor McGonagall to ask her about the Animagi transformation. She was walking between her class and the Great Hall and Harry had just happened to turn the corner right as she left her classroom. He called her name to get her attention and then ran to catch up, knowing she’d not take kindly to be shouted at.
on the run, with nothing but open road and a staticky radio
A house elf appeared at Lucius’ elbow and set a large tray of cookie dough on the table. With a snap, cookie cutters appeared with various sprinkles and icings. Harry raised an eyebrow, but Draco started telling the story of how his grandmother teaches them all how to make cookies each Christmas as a way to teach them they weren’t above getting their hands dirty from time to time. Of course, that didn’t really stop everyone from being dressed to the nines. Like they couldn’t be bothered to dress down to make
“No, becoming an Animagus,” he said as he stared up into the leaves of the oak above him. “I dunno, the more I think about it, the more appealing it sounds…”

“Excuse me, do you mind?” Harry asked, gesturing to the seat across from Draco. “Everywhere else is full.” Draco gave a short laugh but nodded, stowing his book away.
to be an Auror. But now? Things felt less black-and-white and he was unsure as to where he wanted to go and what he wanted to spend the rest of his life doing. He’d never been able to think this far ahead, only able to take it a year at a time, focus on the most recent death plot and hope to make it to the next year.
“On a date then?” She winked at him but Harry just laughed.
History of Magic was still as dull as he remembered. Even though History of Magic (the parts that didn't include goblin wars) had played a large part of his battle against You-Know-Who, he still couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Yeah, well, that didn’t stop me from playing today did it…” he responded lamely. Malfoy laughed a little before dropping his head again.
The lunchtime chatter was light and easy, with Harry and Draco making jokes about the article, Andi cooing over Teddy and his antics, and Narcissa attempting to adapt to the informal, mostly muggle dining.
“Tell me again what happened, Harry,” Hermione said. She leaned into Harry’s shoulder, trying her best to comfort him when she just wanted to laugh at his behaviour. They were twenty-two for Merlin’s sake.
had just caused a major war…
“No! There’s--You--No!” Draco said, gasping out the beginnings of several different sentences. “
“As it should be,” Ron laughed. Any worry about their reunion drained from Harry’s body as Ron laughed. Everything was easy after that.
Draco didn’t remember ever being in Firenze’s classroom. But knowing his boyfriend, he could see the appeal. It looked and felt and smelled like the Forbidden Forest.
, Harry reminded himself as he took another round across the kitchen.
“I have to get amusement
it's christmas!!!!
Ron really was his best mate.
“Anyway, when I got to the kitchen, Draco was having tea and cookies. Dunno why, never really asked. He tried to pick a fight with me after I’d had my lunch. But for Merlin’s sake, I’m tired of fighting, and I told him as much. Told him that if he wanted a fight, he’d have to look elsewhere. Then I didn’t see him again until after the Quidditch match where I caught the Snitch in front of him and bloody
Harry stared at the ashes at his feet, a grin starting to spread across his face. It was the first time he’d really smiled in what felt like years. She was finally

i've had this idea floating around in my head a bit since i first heard this playlist! i just like the idea of these songs playing in the static filled background while harry and draco travel across the american west on sirius' motorcycle, staying in shitty motels and trying to reconcile that theyve been through war and were helpless to stop it
a robe?”
“Right then,” Harry said awkwardly, looking at the eager faces in front of him. He was still unsure how to act around children not much younger than himself, but they had a lesson to get to. “Well, if you’ll follow me.”
Everyone else took this as their cue to start opening. They slowly worked their way up through the ranks, lots of exclamations of excitement and pure joy went up everytime a present was open. When it was Harry’s turn, he was a little excited to see what Draco had gotten him and had saved that for last.
Draco mindlessly flipped through the radio settings as Harry situated their bags.
“Mmm…”
Part of that included a paint job.
“Do you need a hand?” Draco asked as he made his way into the kitchen. Inside, Andi sat at the kitchen table with Teddy in his highchair next to her, peeling potatoes by herself. As she opened her mouth to respond, Molly and Fleur walked in from the meet-and-greet just outside the door. Draco could hear the rumble of Harry’s voice in the background as Fleur excitedly greeted Draco with a double-cheeked kiss. Molly hid any surprise at Draco being there well.
doesn’t need to know that.)
. His thoughts wandered to Christmas plans as he meandered through the hall. A few people stopped to talk to him, students and classmates, before moving onto their own compartments.
“And the tables aren’t separated anymore! Everyone sits where they want now. So, Luna sits with us every day at meals now, and we chose a random table every meal. The other students are doing the same. I honestly don’t think the first years know how drastically different Hogwarts used to be.”
And with that, everyone wiped tears away and started digging in. Laughter quickly filled the room. Plates were passed around, bottles floating around to be poured as asked, some pieces of food flung from Ginny towards whoever she felt like deserved it at any given moment. (Harry ended up blocking a lot of the food over the course of dinner.)
Hermione was always working, and Ron wasn’t even at Hogwarts, and everyone else seemed to walk on eggshells around him, so Harry felt more and more isolated.
, whatever it was.
As he came to rest in front of the stands, a little above them so as not to block their view, a Bludger whizzed past Harry’s ear. He was forced to jerk upward, raising several feet rapidly to avoid a Bludger to the head. The crowd screamed and ducked as the Bludger soared over their heads. It swerved rapidly back towards the pitch, safely over everyone’s heads this time, before one of the Hufflepuff Beaters swung towards Ginny. Luckily, so was too fast for it.
May 2, 2005.
“Andi, what’s--”
” were lost in the rush of eerie green fire. Harry sank back to the couch, staring at the remnants of the social tea Kreacher had put together.
Looking for anything to do, Draco stared out the window and Harry stared at Draco. Harry debated what he should say when he blurted, “Come over for Christmas.”
“Potter. Is there a reason you’ve been skipping classes?” McGonagall asked sternly. Her one raised eyebrow cut through Harry more than any spell or blade could.
Ron. This was the longest they’d been separated since they’d met. Even during the war, when he left him and Hermione, there wasn’t this long of a separation. It was nice to see him again, and he vowed to make a better effort to keep in contact this semester.
He expected the Entrance Hall to be empty, but Malfoy still stood where Harry had left him, looking as if he’d been Confounded. There was a split second where Harry debated going up behind him and whispering “boo.” But they were all still jumpy, Malfoy arguably most of all, so Harry slipped off the Cloak and made his presence known.
Today was one such day. He’d been pacing in front of the Room of Requirement, asking it for a place to escape for a little while. The door never showed and Harry sighed, looking at the ceiling. After the Fiendfyre, he understood why the room was reluctant to let him enter.
A part of Harry would miss teaching, which was odd to him because he remembered very clearly being against the idea. The looming Very Important Decision of what he would do after school was starting to get to Harry. Everyone expected him to be an Auror. Before the war, he
George gave him a hug and a weary smile before collapsing onto the couch in the living room. Harry made a note to ask how he really is later, but was a little more concerned about the lack of Ginny in the room. Ginny missing after this morning meant
Seamus was late for breakfast the next morning, and the eighth years were gathered in a clump at what was previously the Gryffindor table looking a little worried. Seamus hadn’t missed a meal since they’d returned to Hogwarts for fear of them being taken away without reason, leftover from the cruel detentions he’d suffered last year.
. Reluctantly, Draco agreed and off they went. It took longer than strictly necessary because Draco kept stopping, insisting on kisses. And who was Harry to deny him?

cast without a second thought or an extra word.
After his confrontation with Malfoy, there were a few awkward attempts at communication passing in the halls and many aborted ones at meals. The only successes came when Harry was on his own. Malfoy seemed to relax a little when Harry wasn’t around his friends. The friendly attempts made them uncomfortable, but Harry didn't mind them. Things needed to heal after the war. His relationship with Malfoy was one of them. They may never be friends, but they could at least be civil.
“Oh, no, you really haven’t been unfair…” Harry said, floundering for something to say.
“But--” Malfoy stepped forward and Harry looked at him with a scarily blank face. A little frightened of what he found there, Malfoy took a step back.
“Oh Fiendfyre couldn’t ruin charms as old as those, Harry,” Luna said with a faint laugh dancing through her words as if Harry were being silly. “Horcruxes, yes. But charms as ancient and powerful as those?” She shook her head with a smile. Harry looked at her, frustrated. Of course, it seemed simple to her. She was
Anger bubbled in Harry’s chest, much like it did when Aunt Marge had decided she could speak ill of Harry’s parents, who had sacrificed everything for him, for the chance that he might live. Unfortunately, he cannot inflate Draco’s relatives (he’d promised him), but he also couldn’t stand to listen to their talk.
and the bad news and slander it would bring. They’d attempted a similar type of crap during the Triwizard Tournament with Harry and Hermione, but it hadn’t caught on. Now they were printing about Harry’s relationship as if this were
“We were supposed to hate each other, Draco. And I thought I did. For a long time. But… turns out my interest was of a different kind.” Harry leaned in, fully intending to show Draco just what
No time at all seemed to pass, the kisses slow and unhurried, their limbs heavy with peace for the first time in… too many years to count.
“I tried to warn you,” the painting said smugly. She turned and walked out of frame. Harry snorted. Draco muttered a curse.
“I promise Harry, the war is over. It’s been almost a year now…” Neville piped up, moving away from the group. Harry’s eyes locked on him, and there was a scar on his forehead (
His friends didn’t say a word as he approached their small group. It was like they didn’t want to startle him away. Ignoring them, he dragged his eyes to Draco. The Slytherin’s shoulders tensed as Harry moved closer, but he was pointedly staring at the book in his hands. Harry knew Draco wasn’t going to turn around, he was too proud for that.
“Ah, Potter. Come sit down.” McGonagall waved him to the large chair on the other side of her desk. As he walked towards her, she shuffled the parchments she’d been grading away, folding them neatly with a wave of her wand.
“Thanks again for the pillow. It’s perfect.” Their lips met in yet another kiss of gratitude, but when they pulled away after several minutes, there was else to be said. Harry settled back into the couch, pulling Draco close to him as they stared into the fire. They drifted off together, curled against each other in their Molly Weasley sweaters, a pleasant fire in the background and snow falling softly outside. It was picturesque, and a little sappy, but Harry didn't want it to disappear.
me, instead of letting me find out like everyone else.” She looked sad, knowing her son was drawing away from her. He had every right to, after the events of the last few years. But that didn’t mean it hurt less.
“Yes, Mother?” Draco intoned. He didn't bother to move from where Harry had him pressed against the wall. Narcissa stared openly. She wasn’t used to this kind of behavior from Draco, and it had more than stunned her. But just as quickly as she’d slipped up, her face was back into its mask. Her back stiffened and she cleared her throat daintily.
“You’ll find a way, I’m sure.” McGonagall peered over her glasses at him, a twinkle in her eye that reminded Harry painfully of Dumbledore. He briefly wondered if the twinkling eyes was a characteristic of Head of the school. “You’ve never been conventional and I nothing less from this class.” Harry gave her a small smile but quickly covered it by taking a long drink of his tea.
“We have a long day tomorrow,” he whispered, refusing to break the soft spell that seemed to fill the hallway.
standing out starkly against his clenched fist. “I did what I bloody had to to simply survive! What was left of my family was murdered by Volde--” A shuddering gasp shook Harry before he changed course. “You-Know-Who. Friends, people who’d become my family, were murdered. And you think I have a little Felix Felicis in my veins?! NONE of what happened to me was fucking luck,
“Hello, Harry,” Madam Rosmerta said, smiling at him kindly. “What’ll it be tonight, love?”
to be good at to survive.
Draco’s eyes grew wide, and he whisper-yelled his shock.
Maybe things would get better.
“When the article came out, I wasn’t as upset as I thought I’d be. I mean, you pined over him all sixth-year--”
Didn't mean he had to like it.
“I wouldn’t mind taking a ride around on your broom,” Malfoy said, his word slurring together but Harry had no issue understanding him.
“Undue… Strain… Draco, it’s not a big deal.” He quickly stood to grab his hand pull him close. “I just wanted one year where I could pretend I was a normal student, but as usual, you had different plans.”
Harry started to explain all the little details he painstakingly worked to ensure existed and Draco found himself impressed with all of the work Harry had done, mostly by hand according to both Harry and Andi. Harry recounted funny stories of Teddy getting caught up in the renovations, or when silly accidents would happen.
After class, Harry asked Hermione if she ever thought about becoming an Animagus.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve always known. S’why I provoked you in fifth year…” Harry laughed, then sighed.
“How are classes so far?” she asked after she’d settled back behind the desk.
“Teddy Remus Lupin-Tonks, you give that back right now!” Draco yelled, running after the giggling toddler who’d snatched a pair of his underwear after toppling over a laundry basket. Teddy had pulled them onto his head, liking the colors and texture of the silk boxers. The toddler was now scuttling around the first floor, having a blast with Draco’s pants on his head.
“I have a job that requires my full attention during the day. Draco understands, so he doesn’t force me to go with him. And, to be honest, he knows those kinds of things bore me to death. When I get bored, the mischievous Marauder happens to make an appearance.” Harry lifts one shoulder like its no big deal, ignoring the slightly dirty joke he’d made. (It’s true in both meanings, but he
“I don’t know what I’m going to do next year.”
“The only other time I remember it being this bad was right after I moved in. He was tearing the house apart, using every Muggle means to make this house livable. I think the work made him feel useful, and helped with the aggression. So, as time went on, his nightmares became less and less frequent. The physical strain seemed to help. But his roommates owled last semester saying he’d woken up screaming several times at the beginning of the year. They wanted to know what they could do for him,” she said, worrying the cup in her hands.
Forgetting the school day, as he had for several days in a row, he stalked out onto the Quidditch pitch.
“Stop that right now.” The look of shock on Harry’s face was Draco’s opening, and he took it. “I know you think you have to do everything alone, but that’s not how friends and families work. You have wonderful people who give a lot of fucks about how you do in life, especially emotionally. By not letting anyone in, you’re just making things worse. It doesn’t even have to be me that you talk to, Harry. Just share your burden. Please.”
“There are a few things between that, but they are less complicated. You may start tomorrow night, if you wish. It’s a full moon.”
Her oil-paint eyes stared at him for a moment before opening her mouth to scream again but Harry looked her in the eyes with the sort of blankness and ferocity he’d developed in the war. His next words were even and measured, lacking the emotion from seconds earlier. Walburga was getting on his last nerve, and Ron had worn through most of those while they were camping.
The door creaked open and Harry saw Hermione and Neville peeking their heads in in the mirror in front of him.
“Git…” Harry said, leaning back in for another kiss. Draco shivered as the cold of the rain finally started to seep into his clothes and Harry reluctantly pulled away.
“He’s basically been taught that it’s his burden to bear,” Draco scoffed into his tea. “That’s why he snuck off at the battle to face Voldemort alone. He thought
Neville took the first years, knowing they’d be less harsh if he messed up and knowing that they’d need less attention than the older students.
“The rest of the world has had tellies for at least forty years by this point. We’ve had computers for about that long too, and now we have the Internet. I’m just saying, I think it’s time for the Wizarding world to catch up. Might make us stick out less.” Harry shrugged, taking a long drink of his pint and turning his attention back to the telly.
“There are no more Order members to ask, and the Wizarding world at large has heard of the curse and are refusing me! I even asked an
His pouty thoughts were disrupted by a loud thump. Someone had dropped onto the bench next to Draco, their book bag falling gracelessly to the floor.
The banter continued merrily as the sun climbed higher and higher, and Harry dozed lightly on his boyfriend. This was nice. It was something he never go to enjoy. The spring was always filled with Voldemort’s latest plot, the latest schemes from Harry and the gang, and never ending amounts of sadness and grief. Being able to just exist and enjoy the nice weather was a balm to Harry’s ragged soul. Days like these made it harder to remember that he was so warn torn.
“And that’s another score for Hufflepuff!” Dennis called out in its various iterations as more and more goals slipped past the Gryffindor Keeper. The Hufflepuffs were having a field day scoring, though Harry knew Ginny and Demelza were giving them a run for their money. Harry began to dread the staticky sound of Dennis inhaling to yell out another score for Hufflepuff because frustration was beginning to mount in Harry’s chest; the Snitch was nowhere in sight and they were close to losing as the Hufflepuff Chasers flew circles around Gryffindor’s newest Keeper.
Draco only half listened, instead watching Harry with interest. When he smiled, his glasses rode up his nose as it crinkled. And when he laughed at the kids’ antics as they walked home with their parents, his eyes crinkled and he threw his head back a little. His hair was just a little too long, barely brushing the jacket’s collar, and it looked so soft, he wanted to touch it and
“--But it’s obvious you fancy each other. I still may not trust him completely… but he’s had a lot of his own issues. He deserves a chance.”
Harry nodded, chewing his lip. The idea of hosting it at Grimmauld Place was… daunting. Mostly because there hadn’t been that many people in his house ever. And the holidays were bound to be hectic anyway. It was the first Christmas since the war. People wanted it to be extravagant because the war was over, but they also wanted a chance to mourn. The losses were going to be felt more keenly than most days. Mrs. Weasley may be thankful for the distraction, or for the ability to mourn those she lost without worrying about having Christmas.
