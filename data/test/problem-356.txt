They watched in anticipation as Draco paused in his ministrations. He leaned closer to Harry’s face and whispered something. His thumb brushed against Harry’s cheek and showed him what he had found. She guessed it was probably an eyelash. Pansy held in her gasp when their eyes met. She kicked Hermione under the table in excitement. This was it! She saw their faces light up with an epiphany of how they truly felt. Draco leaned down further and pressed a tentative kiss against Harry’s cheek.
“I suppose I would have given in to what I wanted to do. I would have returned every single one of your hugs. I would have followed you around myself. I would have insisted on remaining by your side. I would have kept holding your hand. I would have given you some cheesy poetry about how angelic you look. I would have done that and so much more.”
Of course, Harry could conjure the flowers. But what knowledge did Harry have about flower arrangements? He surmised it would be best to go to a professional. And since he didn’t want to be mobbed on this particular day, he settled for a local florist’s.
task of killing an old man. It seems that despite it being a new life, he still has a father who loathes him for being so
Harry nudged Draco away with his nose. Of course, he didn’t go very far, what with him wrapped tightly around Harry.
Mark nodded to his coworker Mikey in the break room. He waited patiently as he clocked into his shift. He’d been working at the restaurant for a few months and so far had no complaints. His coworkers were nice, and the patrons were polite and obviously the upper class. Even better, they tipped well which was why he remained there.
What kind of world was it if this was to be acceptable? This senseless killing? How could his father have been so blinded, so stupid?
He stood up and followed Draco to his kitchen. Harry smiled to himself, he found joy in being able to navigate his way around Draco’s home. That it was familiar to him. He found Draco opening his cupboard to retrieve the salt. Throwing caution to the wind, he stopped behind Draco and leaned his chin on his shoulder.
When it was finally his turn at the front, he ordered his regular and batted his eyes at the tired worker for an extra helping of their delicious sauce. She merely rolled her eyes at him and threw in three more packets.
He lets go of Draco’s hand and starts to card his fingers through Draco’s hair, smiling when he pulls out a leaf. He gets a sound that he can only describe as being a purr — if humans could purr, that is.
Harry looked to the two and pursed his lips in concentration. “I don’t care about the people outside the match I’m working on. They aren’t important, it’s the happiness of the couple I care about. Surely after everything she’s been through, Parkinson’s mum will allow her some semblance of joy?”
“Right, let’s focus on these different types of roots and bark that we add to potions. I had no idea that based on the age of the root or bark, it could affect the potion. Did you know that adding a younger bark could make the potion last longer? It can also refresh some of the other ingredients inside the cauldron. Oh! But in turn, if you want to make a potion mature faster, adding in an older root makes reduces the wait time!”
The candles remained where they left it previously. Four on each window sill, and three on the table in front of them. The room got considerably brighter.
“You see, Achilles was given the choice to return home. However, he would not be granted the glory of a hero. Continue to fight and people will venerate him. He chose to continue and fight, and in doing so lost his
It was like everyone had taken a collective gasp. The tension was palpable, and Draco blanched. What horrible dare would he have to do? Anything but sing or dance. When sober Draco was a graceful dancer with perfect rhythm, but drunk? He was nothing more than a snail in contact with salt. Something horrifying, yet attention-grabbing.
“I thought you said he was acting better?” Hermione asks, finally making her presence known. She isn’t looking at Harry, but rather in the direction Draco left in.
“Well, why else would we be glowing? I took it as a compliment—” upon the state of panic Harry was starting, Hermione decided to change her angle, “—okay, so this glowing thing. Maybe you should elaborate more on it so I can understand. So
Harry laughs and starts preparing the table. He opens his textbook again and finds the page that they need. “Do you want to do it as my textbook says, or as yours?”
Before they left the room, Harry pulled Draco into a final hug. “Everything’s going to be alright. We’ll figure out what to do okay? I’ll take you outside okay?”
Harry looked between his professor and Draco, wondering what it was that they discussed. Draco calmly assured him that it was nothing of major concern. They waited for Flitwick to bring out the arrow in silence. Harry was starting to feel antsy, his foot started to tap as the seconds – which felt like hours to him – passed.
The two boys don’t notice their pupils dilating, instead choosing to come closer. Harry’s hand reaches out traces Draco’s wrist. They gasp as the sensation. This is peculiar, nothing in the textbook says anything about how touch can change upon inhalation. Draco, emboldened, twists his hand in Harry’s until their fingers are intertwined. His eyes never stray from their hands, lost in the sensation it brings. Harry steps even closer, his other hand raising until his fingers are tracing Draco’s hair by his ear.
The first bottle that emptied was used for the pointer in the game. Truth or dare Seamus had declared, to the joy of everyone in the common room. Seamus was eager to get the game started so he volunteered to be the first to spin and proudly asked a cautious Hermione ‘truth or dare’.
Harry was sat in his remedial Charms class with Flitwick, sighing into his arm now and again. He drew on his parchment whenever he felt like it, not absorbing much of what his professor was saying. Flitwick seemed to notice and called for a break. Harry shot up, guilty that he was distracted. Especially since Flitwick didn’t need to do this for him. He wasn’t sure how, but while these sessions were supposed to be shared with Draco, he was alone.
Three figures, shorter than Harry, hunched the way they are, appear once his family is gone. They don’t say much to him, only muttering,
Ron laughs into Hermione’s shoulder. She too is smiling, but nowhere near as much as Ron. “You got Amortentia high! Oh, Merlin!”
He looked up into the night sky and frowned at the absence of the stars. Which was a given, seeing as he lived in quite a busy city. He missed the stars he used to see from his bedroom, back at home in Wiltshire. He knew all the constellations by name, and would often make up new ones. Picturing new shapes in the sky.
Harry smiles bitterly and shakes his head. At least the two of them have one pleasant memory together.
The jostling from the broom mimicked that of a horse, which was preposterous because when in this life did Harry ever get the chance to ride a horse? He never even had the chance to ride the donkeys that came to his school during fetes. So, why was he familiar with the sensation of balancing on a moving animal? And why did Draco’s arms trigger the memory?
“Oh no. I still feel furious underneath. Only it’s suddenly not so bad. It doesn’t feel as bad as before. I think it balanced out or something.”
Before long, he had reached his front door. Behind the thin curtains, he saw lights coming from the TV. His melancholy mood left and was replaced with joy. He hoped he was right in his assumption of who it was in the living room.
Draco all but groans, before reversing their positions and pushing Harry against the wall. He buries his hands into Harry’s hair, pulling his head up so he can ravish Harry. Harry rarely protests when he gets like this, so he eagerly welcomes the attention and gives as much as Draco takes.
Harry looked up at the familiar sneering voice, only this time it was more questioning than filled with vitriol. Malfoy? What was he doing in Birmingham, of all cities?
Draco grabbed Harry’s shoulders to make him stop. He stared into Harry’s eyes and suddenly Harry could breathe again. Seeing him calm down, Draco nodded and let go. Harry’s hand moved without his consent and grasped his wrist. Draco looked at their hands, with a questioning look before he looked back at Harry.
Another win for team free will! Wait, that wasn’t right. What was their name again? What was his name again?
On the Thursday of their week off from Hogwarts, he was called into one of the manor’s many sitting rooms. The room was heavy with anticipation and iron – a scent which he hated so much recently.
No one protested to her blatant disregard for the order. In fact, everyone and the portraits had been hoping it would happen sooner.
“Do you want to wait together?” Malfoy asked, looking into Harry’s eyes. Malfoy looked unsure, which made him seem younger all of a sudden.
It isn’t easy, but Dumbledore and Draco talk. Draco is able to find a way to communicate with his mother to get her in the loop. She mails a mirror shard to Draco who shares it with Harry. Seeing the mirror brings back bitter memories of Sirius, but upon talking to Narcissa, he surprisingly finds peace, not enough, but some...
With nothing much to find, he stood back up and felt for his wand. Finding it lost from his back pocket, he supposed it must have rolled under the bed he stood next to. He grunted as he bent down again, his past knee injury flaring up again. He blindly reached for his wand and pulled it back. As he did so, he felt a box brush against his fingers. He
Harry knew all about fear and death so he could understand why one shouldn’t touch the arrow. Oh, but to be blind to the feeling of emptiness and the depression he no doubt had…
He thought about asking Luna since she was taking both Spanish and French, but her hair was all over the place from the frustration she felt. He found it odd that Luna was acting in such a manner, she was very gifted in languages — and everything else academic really. Then he saw her lift her textbook and noticed that it said: “
Harry looks to him, smiling genuinely for the first time in a long time. Not taking his eyes off Draco he repeats, “yeah. We’re together.” His thumb brushing the back of Draco’s knuckles in a slow tempo.
“Boys?” Flitwick could not have chosen a better time to interrupt them. They both looked at him, and he mutely pointed to the Arrow.
greeting Harry, he speaks again. “I did you a great disservice in one of your past lives. Your soul was unable to rest and remained on the mortal plane for aeons before I got my chance.”
“I find myself making plenty of those, and yet many don’t realise it,” Harry replied, poking Draco’s cheek playfully.
“I will ignore today’s potion mess and any future messes you make Mr Malfoy if you accept this. And for you Harry, I will grant you extra points for your help. I truly think you could benefit from this.”
“Did you know the gods of fertility have been working for aeons to create such a shade. Yet, they never would have found one more perfect than what I see in your eyes?”
He let himself listen to the music and closed his eyes as he absorbed the lyrics. He hummed along to the tune of
“Would you like to hear a Wizard marriage vow, by exchanging one with me?” He asked, opening the ring box to reveal a silver band. It was engraved to look like a daisy chain, only it was an alternating one of lilies and narcissi.
: City mentioned is Birmingham. In this city, there are colloquial terms such as bab used as a term of endearment. It’s not a typo. I moved to Birmingham around 2001 so I’m going by memory for some of these facts – could be wrong for some of them, sorry ^^;
Another body rushes to them, Hermione. Her gasping cries call attention to them. Before Harry can escape everyone gathers around the trio hugging and crying. It feels like a dream. Everything is over! Finally!
As if sensing a change in the atmosphere, Hermione and Pansy paused in their conversation. They turned their attention to the couch, where Draco had straddled Harry and was trying to reach his neck where he was the most ticklish.
It’s been two weeks since the Final Battle. Harry has been staying at Grimmauld Place and finds himself enjoying the silence for a few minutes. For the first few days, he’s been unable to handle the silence. Silence means thinking, and that means remembering. He is grateful Draco decided to join him. He didn’t want to think about how it would have felt without him by his side.
He moved to push Draco off his lap, which let Draco know he was about to be rejected. He bit his lip and he made a move to stand and walk away when Harry’s hand wrapped around his wrist. He looked down into the deep green eyes and lost his breath at the hope he saw in them.
Ron smiles to himself. He could use this to his advantage. Draco walks back and hands him a red velvet cake that’s been iced copiously. Oh, look at that. His good day is back on track.
Malfoy pouts, and smacks Harry’s shoulder, quickly apologising when Harry groans. “No, Harry. Make it a fair fight at least.”
“I’m not as ignorant as you assume! I’m well aware that the world is going to turn to shit. I see it every day at my home! Do you think you have it bad as an outsider? Think how someone on the inside feels?”
It was a photograph of his parents slow dancing in what he could only guess was his parents’ wedding reception. Near the end of the loop, Sirius’ smirking face jumped in the corner ruining what would have been a sweet shot. Harry couldn’t have been happier, it was such a Sirius thing to do. He pulled out more photographs and saw more snippets of their wedding. Harry leaned against the bed and stared fixated at his parents’ happy smiles.
“I’ll just put this away then,” Flitwick said to the two boys. They hadn’t realised he was still in the room and closed the door after they left. Flitwick shook his head and smiled at the sight. He looked at the arrow and sighed. Hopefully, it would do more good than bad.
“For the better part of a few months, I found myself paying attention to you. Not in the way I used to, but a new way. This foreign feeling crept slowly and before I knew it, I was unable to stop it. I found myself paying attention to the way you laughed. How your face lit up whenever you talked about something that excited you. I enjoyed that you would come to me to share something that amused you. I —” Draco had leaned onto Harry’s pillows and brought Harry toward him with their joined hands. His eyes were intense, but he made no move to stop Harry. Now that Harry found his words, he was loathed to stop, “—I couldn’t stop myself from checking every day if an aura was around you. I started to hate myself at the thought that should one appear around you… I wouldn’t say anything. I didn’t want to see you end up with someone who… well… wasn’t… me.” At the last word, Harry had found he couldn’t look at Draco.
Harry wiped his hands on his thighs and rose to sit next to Draco. He purposely chose to ignore Seamus’ whispered ‘
“Mione suggested that we were willing to accept his apology, only that we needed to see proof that he had changed. So for the next few whatevers, Mione’s gonna keep an eye on him or somethin’... Honestly, I just wanted to leave the whole time.”
“Yep. And we avoided talking about it for like, two weeks right?” Harry checks and Draco nods, unable to look anywhere else but at Harry. Which is fine with him, Harry is someone he can never stop watching. “But you guys know me, I couldn’t keep quiet about it and somehow I managed to convince him it was a good thing. You know, us…”
Now that he knew about his parents anniversary, he wanted to do something about it. What kind of son would he be to ignore such an important date? His parents who probably married in secret because of the First War; who deserved to have their marriage remembered.
“Great! It should take me no more than two hours to finish off the bouquet. We’re not too busy today, so I might finish earlier than that. You can pay when you come to collect it. If I could please have your contact information?” Cally held out a notepad and pen.
“Oh please. He probably thought I deserved it being who I am.” Draco refuses to look up and see Harry understand Dumbledore’s reasons.
“It was just the Amortentia.” He mumbles, his fingers tracing his swollen lips. Ignoring the heat that rushes through him when he can see part of Harry’s skin revealed when he adjusts his jumper.
On their tenth attempt at a tutoring session, both boys start to relax. Draco isn’t sure why, but something about being alone with Harry causes him to drop his pretences. There are no witnesses around, so it’s easy to fall into an easy rhythm of pleasantry. Sure, they bicker like normal, but the bite has lessened. And in these moments alone together, Draco has come to notice things about Harry, like what he looks like when he laughs or his tells when he’s nervous. A tell that he can see Harry repeatedly make.
He looked between the rows and pointed at the chicken bake pastie, “I’ll have two of those please.” He turned to the refrigerated area and picked up a bottle of water as well, “this as well.”
“That doesn’t sound so bad. Much better than being a Slytherin in this day and age,” Malfoy muttered.
His sound of frustration drew the eyes of the two opposite him. Now there was a pairing he hadn’t expected to come to fruition. Because of what happened, Hermione took to the library – as you do in these situations – and since he wasn’t the only party affected, Blaise followed, offering his assistance. Harry hadn’t realised how much of a tight bunch the Slytherins were, but he can acknowledge that after the year they had, deeper bonds can form.
Hermione grinned and let herself enjoy the sight. No doubt she’d have to reveal more information to Harry, but she left off it. Letting them enjoy their new relationship.
Upon exiting the room, the two land gracelessly onto the ground. Draco’s eyes open after landing and he turns to see the door close and return to stone. Smoke escapes before it seals shut and he gasps in relief.
Harry tilted his head and stared at the glass. His gut feeling told him to trust the other man, and he always relied on his instincts. They were very good – most of the time. He picked up the glass and took a careful sip. Upon discovering it was only water, he finished half the glass. He wiped the excess water off his lips and smiled at the other man.
“I’m going to be out for most of the day, Kreach. I might be back for dinner. Something light perhaps?”
Harry had taken to wandering through the hidden streets of England. Every weekend, he would spend a few hours travelling to a new city. For someone proud to be British, all he knew was Surrey, a little bit of Devon, and Hogsmeade. The latter being entirely magical, and Devon partially due to the Burrow being there. No need to mention why Surrey was even considered.
“I’m not sure why, but I have the sudden urge to—” Draco pauses. He leans away slightly and stares at Harry’s lips. Oh, how lucky he is! They have not changed much, apart from colour. No longer the rosy shade he currently owns, but a deeper red. Full and parting for
“You’re serious?” Draco blankly asks before he starts to laugh. Hysterically. “The crazy old man knew I was suffering and rather than talk to me directly he decided to torture me until I cracked? What kind of–”
“You promised you wouldn’t die.” Malfoy’s face crumples and Ron feels the need to turn away. Hermione instead chooses to focus on Harry.
It was by an unspoken agreement that they went into the room quietly. Flitwick seemed aware of it, probably knowing that this would be the last session. He had requested to speak privately with Draco beforehand, and upon their return, Draco was obviously unhappy about something. He brushed off Harry’s concern and steeled himself for what was to come.
The man shook his head, eyes widening and cheeks turning pink at what he said, “right. Right. I simply misheard you. And you
“Cheers, bruv,” the man muttered. He was currently on break taking a sip of water. Harry smiled at the man and walked back to Malfoy.
it! This is the first time I actually managed to complete something like this on time. That said, I will probably not do a daily challenge like this for a while. Even though these were just short stories, I still felt drained towards the end of the month, hehe... Thank you so much for reading, commenting and subscribing! I appreciate each and every single one of you!! You truly were my motivators to get chapters posted daily!
Harry swallowed as he knocked on the door, refusing to acknowledge the warmth coming from Draco’s breath as he leaned against him. The door opened and Harry looked down, trying his darndest to not to grimace at the fond look Flitwick was throwing them. Even Flitwick had softened after seeing their interactions.
Draco begs) eyes are squinted by how wide his smile is. He offers one more peck onto Draco’s lips before he backs away.
Boarding the Hogwarts train months later had been a struggle. All the excited students new and old wanted to greet Harry and his friends. Which meant by the time they made it to the train their regular compartment had been occupied. He dreaded to know what the occupants would think once they were aware of whose compartment they were sat in.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought too. Mother decided to get rid of Malfoy Manor and the final bid for it took place yesterday. As the only Malfoy not marked, she has the sole claim of the land. And now she’s sold it… Sold my home. I just wish she had consulted me about it. We’ve been arguing since this morning via owl and I just told her I didn’t want to see her. She probably hates me now –”
Now that he has time to breathe, a memory springs in his mind. A promise. A promise that is so long ago, yet so precious he’s surprised he almost forgot about it. Almost.
Draco’s stomach dropped. He had already said what he needed to say, and he doubted he could repeat it. It was hard enough saying it in front of his mirror as practice yesterday. He started to shake his head, in denial.
Harry’s eyes were drawn to the tiger lilies, bright and eyecatching. The girl seemed to notice and asked him if he’d like a bouquet of them. He shook his head and started to explain. “It’s my parents’ twenty-fifth anniversary, so I wanted to get something for them,” he said.
“He’s not doing anything suspicious. I just tugged on the wrong nerve. Nothing to worry about, I had it handled before you guys came."
Harry growled the mirth he felt earlier leaving him. He needed to let Draco see that he wasn’t making fun of him. He grabbed Draco again, ignoring his protest and glares. Instead of taking just his wrist though, he laced their fingers together. The contact of their palms seemed to shock Draco into silence. Harry let himself savour it for a few seconds longer before he spoke.
Neville accepted that was the most he would get out of Harry and patted his back. “Yeah, but you’re still gonna have to pick the next person to tickle truth or dare out of.”
Harry waits for Draco in their usual classroom. Now that things are out, he hopes they can continue meeting. He is surprised to find himself enjoying Draco’s company and sees the two of them becoming close. Maybe even friends.
Draco hesitated, “I have one more person to apologise to. And you’re touched if you think I’ll somehow stop insulting you. I won’t be cruel about it, but you just make it so easy sometimes Potter. I’d end up combusting if I held back some comments sometimes.”
Draco closes his eyes, he thinks back to the previous summer. He remembers his mother’s more restrained smiles. He remembers hearing her cry, sobbing into her handkerchief while he hid behind the door in the second library. He remembers hearing her fall to the ground before the whole room became silent. She no doubt placed a silencing charm around the room.
Draco laughs, that wondrous laugh Harry used to hate loving (without knowing why hearing it made him so
Blank. His mind went blank. All thoughts he previously had? Where did they go? Draco didn’t know. To make things worse, the prat-who-lived-to-ruin-his-life
’. This time, he chose to kiss Draco on his forehead, not wanting Draco to beat him to it. There were only a few more places to kiss before it got… to a stage that Harry wasn’t keen on thinking about. Because it was something Harry had thought about (many a time), and the effects of firewhisky were causing the line to blur and in all honesty, Harry was getting scared.
It had been years since he last saw Malfoy. He decided to take this as an opportunity to find out what he’d been up to in the past few years. What did Malfoy need flowers for? Surely he had is own gardens to gather flowers from. And the prat was as pureblood as they came. Flower arrangements seemed to be something they’d be taught together with how to walk.
Malfoy merely hummed and tried his best to burrow into Harry, forcing his arms apart so it would go around his shoulder. He pushed his face into the space between Harry’s neck and shoulder, where Harry could feel his smile against his neck.
Harry would sit down in the great hall, and a second later would be engulfed in the blond’s hug. He would find himself being fed by Malfoy, to the amusement of everyone in the vicinity, and as much as he hated it, he accepted every mouthful. The grin that would appear on Malfoy's face definitely wasn’t the reason for it. It wasn’t.
Hermione softens and takes his hand. Harry feels a sudden appreciation for Ron, he truly did make a good choice all those years ago. Ron coughs, uncomfortable at how sappy everyone seems to be getting.
“Headmaster Dumbledore has been giving speeches in the staff room about how Hogwarts always gives help. And Mr Malfoy, I think you need some.”
Harry pulls Draco into his lap and holds him tightly. They sit in silence, comfortable in each other’s presence. After a while, Harry looks over Draco’s shoulder and pries his hands open so he can trace his palm. He focuses at a particular break in the lifeline, where it starts again just a few millimetres to the right. He turns his palm up and compares the two side by side. Their lifelines are exactly the same; breaking only to continue.
Draco closed his eyes and leaned against the tree trunk. The smell of the blossoms and fresh grass filled his nostrils as he took in a deep inhale. He opened his eyes again and spotted a few flowers, early in their bloom. He made sure he was alone before he plucked one and fixed his position against the tree.
Both watch as Draco gets lost in the memories of his torment. They see Harry bring him back to the present with gentle whispers and kisses. His hands constantly rubbing on Draco’s back to guide him back.
So their friendship remains secret. They maintain the ‘tutor’ sessions, however. It appears to be convincing as Draco’s marks have improved. That was only because he was no longer stressed about his assignment. Dumbledore saw to that.
Taking a deep breath, Draco fiddled with something under his pillow, which jostled Harry slightly. He pulled out a navy velvet case. Harry’s heart raced, he had a pretty good idea what Draco was asking.
Harry squeezed his nose bridge and closed his eyes. This was another thing on top of another thing that he truly didn’t want to deal with. Why was it always him and Malfoy?
“Did the Fates believe that by changing your colouring I wouldn’t be able to recognise you?” Harry muses. “I mean, yeah we forgot each other… but there was still something that drew me toward you.”
Hermione’s grip in Ron’s hand tightens. He feels like doing the same, Malfoy had just called Harry by his name, and hadn’t Harry called him Draco earlier too? What is going on?
The very idea boiled his blood. He was more than that. He was his own person, whilst also a Malfoy. In anger he countered Potter.
The morning after, Harry awoke with a throbbing headache. He opened his mouth and closed it a few times, trying to figure out if what he ate was a dead animal or if he swallowed garden soil. He sat up rubbing his eyes. The blanket that was covering his shoulders fell onto his lap. He looked down at the soft-looking navy blue velvet throw. This was not his blanket, nor was it his sofa. He picked up his glasses which were on the floor beside the sofa. The room wasn’t his either.
Harry’s head turned to his long-time best friend. She wasn’t even looking at them, she was playing with her fingernails as if this was a simple task that didn’t require her full attention. When they didn’t move, she looked at them and raised an eyebrow. Harry merely stood up led Draco out of the common room to the direction of his and Ron’s room.
Harry let go of Draco’s shoulders and fixed his glasses. He took them off and cleaned them with the sleeve of his shirt, deciding it would be best to not look at Draco for the moment. He licked his lips and could taste Draco on them. He found a section of skin that had lifted and nibbled on it as he tried to make sense of what just happened.
wear his heart on his sleeve, and his poker face sucked. But– Yeah, he had no way of defending himself in his thoughts. What more to Pansy?
Potter said something about the World Cup the previous summer. He made it seem like Draco was ignorant, unaware of the things going on around them. Like he was nothing more than a spoiled figurehead for the Malfoy name.
Harry had somehow covered his face to hide his embarrassment. Why they thought that he would want to… They’re family for goodness sake! But he knew he finally piqued Hermione’s curiosity. And before it went, he wanted to clarify what he meant, “I don’t know. It just appeared. I haven’t been out much since my birthday and even then I think I saw things but I just thought it was cus of drinking you know? And then when you guys came over I noticed a little glow circling both you and Ron. When you were in the kitchen it seemed to grow even more. But when you came back, the glowing came together and now you’re glowing pink.”
Ron smirked, “I was about to, but I think Hermione knew cus she grabbed my wand and pocketed it. I only just got it back before I came in.”
“I… I– I can’t do it. I don’t want to bring back the pain. I can’t feel it, but I remember it. I don’t want it. Harry–” he looked into Harry’s eyes pleadingly, they were becoming watery, “please don’t make me do it. I don’t want it. I’m happy with the way things are, aren’t you?”
He wandered down the streets in Islington and ended up in Old Paradise Yard where he found a place that looked convincing. He entered the establishment and held back a sneeze from the abundance of pollen that suddenly wanted to greet him.
Not everyone could claim to have a solid relationship with their ex. Usually, exes avoided each other whenever they could. No mention of their name by friends; pictures ripped in half from rage. Things like that. Harry, on the other hand, counted himself lucky. He was quite good friends with his ex. Actually most of his exes (
, Draco thinks. He lets himself smile briefly at the funny thought, forgetting he has company. “I doubt I would require such help professor…”
Harry knew this was the perfect time to tell Draco what had happened to him. It was almost the end of the school year, and he had no idea if they would remain in contact after school.
“Hmm?” Draco nuzzles in closer to Harry, wanting more of the warmth and comfort being offered to him. It’s been so long since he was last hugged, was last gently spoken to. He bites his lip, hesitating slightly. “Dumbledore,” he says, “I didn’t want to, but I felt like I had no choice… The Dark Lord has a rope tied around all of our necks and he will tighten it whenever he sees fit. He’s one word away from giving the command to end my family… I felt– feel like I can do nothing.”
Ron and Hermione look at each other in confusion, before rushing to Harry. As they approach, they realise that Harry and Malfoy are whispering to each other.
hard to not pay attention to how it changed Potter’s face when he smiled. He had always seen it at a distance, and never directed at him. Now? He wondered if he would’ve followed his father if Potter smiled at him like that from the beginning.
He suddenly couldn’t breathe. This was the first time that Potter wasn’t glaring at him with revulsion. He moved his left hand, making Draco stiffen as if getting ready for the spell that Potter was obviously getting ready to cast. Instead, his hand carried on rising by his ear where he pulled out something.
The smell of seasoned meat took over his senses and he was drawn to the open kebab shop. It’s flickering neon lights gave him the same irritating headache as in the club. But the smell was too enticing, and he admitted to himself that he was getting increasingly hungry. He reached the door and opened it, causing the smell to increase in strength. It looked as if he wasn’t the only tipsy person in the establishment. He spied a couple getting way too cosy in public and moved away from them. He leaned against the glass, joining the queue.
Draco poked his side, suddenly back at his side which let him whisper, “of course,” against Harry’s ear. Harry was about to retaliate by shoving his wet hands into Draco’s hair, only Draco seemed to know him well since before he could he had apparated away.
There, leaning against what used to be one of the walls in the courtyard, sit two young men. Both their hair have traces of debris, and their cheeks are caked with dust. They stink of sweat and are uncomfortably hot in their clothes. The sun that was hidden behind dark clouds has come out and shines into their eyes.
“Draco.” Harry tried out, he liked how it rolled off his tongue. He ignored the man sputtering next to him. “Draaaaay cooooo… Drahh cooo…” his head fell onto the table again.
Feigning disinterest, lest he got caught, Harry paused in his watching, “and pray tell, what have I been doing Malfoy?”
, but who's really counting?) were very friendly with him. Harry didn’t realise how good of a friendship it was until he saw a text from one of them.
Draco’s voice disappears into the room, yet his sobs remain. Harry pulls his head back and rests it on his shoulder. He shivers slightly as Draco’s breaths tickle him.
Harry shook his head, “I don’t go out into Wizarding areas. I’m sure you read about my secret love affair?”
’d the box out from under the bed and coughed as the dust floated into the air. He pulled the sleeve of his shirt over his hands and wiped the box down. Eventually, words were visible:
“Even if it did, I’d let you win it back,” Harry replies, grinning at Malfoy now that he seems to be past hitting his chest.
Harry leaned over him, ignoring Draco’s stare. He knew what Draco was doing. Draco knew he knew it too, the tracing of Harry’s thumb against his hip sort of gave it away.
Storytime of how Drarry came to be, with periodic interruptions from Ron or Hermione, because they can't help themselves.
The next appointment was a few days later. Draco’s displays of affection were still frequent. When he realised how mean he had treated Harry, he was very apologetic. He upped his efforts in his displays of affection, much to the amusement of everyone in the common room. However, their laughter was cut short when Draco shouted at them to go away. His anger had returned and was triggered by everyone but Harry. Harry who was often greeted with a kiss on the cheek in the mornings and a hug before the separated at night.
Harry lost his footing and almost tripped, “I might as well have been.” He turned to grin at Draco who’s face had fallen. He realised what his mind was travelling to and changed the topic to bring his mood up. “Say, what do you know about Parkinson and Zabini?”
Harry leaned into the sofa playing with the cords of his earbuds. Draco was making sense, it was to be their last year in Hogwarts, it would be nice to stay and enjoy the castle while they still could.
Harry grinned, “one of those word of the day things Hermione has on her desk. Now, answer my question.”
Prey that for the past few days were Harry and Malfoy. Malfoy would get chocolates, or letters signed
Potter looked down at his hand, “oh this? It’s an earbud. It plays music. I normally play my music quite loud when I eat in the Great Hall. The noise is just too much sometimes. I probably forgot to lower it down.”
Draco already knew the way to Harry’s room, so he merely took Harry’s hand and rushed them down the corridor. Harry’s exhilarated laughter filling the empty space the whole time.
Harry turned a page and turned to rest on his stomach, finding the position comfier. “ —For that matter, a match for the Pander would be difficult to find if they glowed much like everyone else. Panders are much more sensitive to others’ auras than their match’s. After much research, it has come to light that the match of Panders appears to emit no aura. When in actuality, they are displaying such pure light, that it is invisible to the human eye.”
, this isn’t what he thought it was going to be like. He felt the chill rushing through his nerves. He trained his eyes to focus on the wall behind the screaming woman. He forced his eyes to ignore her begging for mercy. His fists closed, hidden under the long sleeves of his robes. He refused to show his disgust.
Knowing that whenever he got like this, he didn’t like to be stared at, Draco let him hide his face, once more. “I just feel so ridiculously happy right now. I never would have pictured myself at twenty-six with someone I love as much as I do you.”
With that revelation, Harry is bombarded with images. He sees two boys running around, they look completely different to how Harry and Draco look. Yet, the way they interact is similar. Draco did dislike Harry, much like Patroclus did in the beginning because of jealousy. Harry does watch Draco like Achilles watched Patroclus. It’s fascinating to see how they maintained their behaviours despite the change in time.
Ron looked to Harry, finally realising that he was on the floor. Ron sighed and sat next to Harry, grunting as he crossed his legs. He elbowed Harry, “maybe he’s just scared. I did detect some fear in his posture as if Mione and I would harm him. He’s finally self-aware of how much of a piece of trash he actually is… er was? I don’t know mate. He said he understands if we don’t forgive him any time soon, he just wanted to say sorry to us.”
And what a story it is! The tale of Achilles and how he fought during the Trojan War. Apollo tells him of a man named Patroclus who was always beside Achilles. He calls them ‘star-crossed lovers’ who didn’t get the chance to live their happy end.
Harry can’t help himself from reaching out and wrapping his left arm around Draco’s waist. He willingly goes to Harry and accepts the kisses Harry plants all over his exposed neck and collar bone.
Malfoy nods to himself, whatever he needs to say seems to take all his energy. He deflates a little and slouches, alerting Ron. Malfoy never slouches, leans against, but never slouches.
Harry knew he didn’t have to repeat himself as he saw Draco’s grin grow. An expression that was rare on his face since the previous arrow session. Sure he smiled every now and again, but that huge grin on display? Harry was glad to have witnessed it again.
The sudden smell of iron hit his nostrils. He opened his mouth slightly so he could inhale that way. Something wet was dripping onto the ground. He blinked back the prickling heat he could feel behind his eyes. It would not help to show weakness among these savages. To them, weakness was like blood to a shark. Then again, they were probably worse than sharks, with how bloodthirsty these
Harry laughed along, “right. I think I’ll go with your suggestion. You’re the expert between us, after all.”
’s French toast. It was a speciality of Draco’s Harry came to discover (and love) during the year of their partnership. Draco’s French toast was
Harry was suddenly glad to be back. Maybe he’d learn to cope with his new ‘gift’ whilst at school. Plus, being surrounded by friends seemed like the best medicine at the moment. He had hated being alone at Grimmauld Place for summer but had felt too awkward at the Burrow to stay there. As a compromise, he invited Hermione and Ron over almost every day, and if they knew what he was doing, they chose to ignore it and humoured Harry.
Noticing the difference in Harry’s feelings regarding what was going on, Pansy dragged him to one corner. For once, Draco wasn’t by his side. Rather, he was being distracted by Blaise who was using drama about a failed Ravenclaw date to grab his attention.
He follows them to the shack. He witnesses his mentor killed by the snake. He helps collect the memory, seeing the recognition in Snape’s eyes as he does so. It seems it is not only him who had a past life with Harry. He is unsure, but somehow he is granted permission to follow Harry to the Headmaster’s office.
Now that they’re separate, it’s as if they sober up. The reality of what is happening outside returns. Draco grips Harry’s shirt and he begs, “you come back to me, Harry. You come back to me.”
“Keep an eye on him, for me will you? Ron and I have one more thing to do,” Hermione says when she takes him to the side. She knows what Harry might be planning, but she doesn't want him to be alone.
Draco laughed and pulled Harry down wrapping both arms around him tightly. Harry closed his eyes and listened to Draco’s heartbeat. It was calm and steady. It felt like home if a person could be described as home. He couldn’t help himself, he started to tear up. After all these years of searching for a home, he finally found one. In Draco Malfoy, of all people.
playing through his earbuds. His mouth mimed to the rap, not yet confident in his skill to rap out loud. He was so into the music that he didn’t notice Malfoy’s attempts in getting his attention. That is until he was kicked in the shin.
Harry opens his mouth and starts to lick against Draco’s skin. He can’t help but grin against the shudder Draco lets out. Draco looks up to the ceiling, his hands stilling on Harry’s shoulders.
Hands are combing through his hair. Oh, how ironic that the two of them have switched crowns. Regardless, the green and the dark brown suit Harry. Draco hears his constant apologies,
“I have a proposition for you two. I understand that there is animosity between the two houses. Always has been, I assume since Hogwarts’ creation. However, I think you two could gain a huge benefit from this.”
Harry cocks his head to the side, “true. But if it’s so easy… Surely there would be no struggle right? Mr Malfoy?” Harry grins at his new friend.
“I thought you knew by now. Potter is a perfectly suitable pet name for you. There’s only one Potter, and he’s here with me.
He was so focused on cleaning himself, that he didn’t notice where he was going and ultimately bumped into someone. He apologised to the person, keeping his eyes on the ground, not wanting to look into their eyes. He hated confronting strangers, and from the looks of their shoes, they seemed like a busy important person who would probably throw him to court. Or something. Harry didn’t know. Laws intimidated him.
All of a sudden it’s like cold water douses the both of them. Harry pushes himself off the table and fixes his glasses onto his face. He can’t remember when he removed them, only that they were no longer bothering his nose. He lifts the corner of his jumper to clean the fingerprints on the lenses. Draco’s breath stutters as he tries to think back to the last few minutes. He fixes his hair as he tries to calculate how long they were under the spell for.
Harry raises one hand to rub against Malfoy’s cheeks. He’s so tender about it that Hermione feels a tug at her heartstrings. He looks so apologetic, what is going on between the two?
The voice startled Harry. There, by the door, watching him in amusement was Draco. He was leaning his hip against the door, holding a steaming mug. Harry could smell the caffeine from where he sat.
“Please Harry! Her family is really protective of her, ever since– well I can’t reveal that, it’s too private… Regardless, her family is super protective of her. The only way I can take her out is if she takes her cousin with her. She’s shown me a picture of him, and honestly? I think you’d hate to miss out on this opportunity.” Ginny was incessant with her importuning.
“Is that something we do now?” Draco looked forward, fixing his dragonhide sling bag. “Greet each other?”
He reaches the top of a pile, noticing how fortunate he is that it’s the tallest of all piles. Sweat is dripping down his forehead, sliding down his temples and his palms are clammy. He struggles to grip on the vanity he climbs on top of. The flames are eagerly eating their way through the wood, seeking prey.
Draco brushed away Harry’s stray tears with his thumbs. He smiled at the teary-eyed man before him. The one he wanted to see every morning, day, night, or forever if he could. “A wizarding vow, would you like to see one?”
With one arm wrapped around Draco’s waist and the other around his shoulder, Harry found himself staring into wide grey eyes. It was like the world around him had disappeared. The chirping of birds ceased. All he could see was Draco; his bright hair ruffling from the soft breeze, his face softening from the initial shock, his eyes crinkling slightly from the smile growing on his soft, pink lips. All he could hear was Draco; his quick breathing, the beginnings of a laugh, a sigh. All he could smell was Draco; something citrusy, fresh, and pleasant. All he could feel was Draco; his warmth, the shape of his muscles under his hands, how perfect he felt in Harry’s arms.
They stayed in that position on the ground for a few minutes. Draco’s breathing was heavy after the rants he spewed. He rubbed his left hand where light bruising had formed. Harry thought nothing of it when he grabbed Draco’s hand and rubbed the knuckles. He pried open his fist and held his hand properly, helping them both stand.
“These are adorable!” He pulled two out from the pile and showed it to Harry, who tucked his chin against Draco’s shoulder.
Throughout his whole shift, he would walk as close to the table as possible. He often asked them if they were satisfied, or if he could refill their drinks. Curly-haired guy had already had three refills of whiskey on his second round.
Kreacher stepped behind him and asked him what he would like for lunch. Harry put his mug down and brushed some of the breadcrumbs away from his lips.
All of a sudden everything comes out. Like a waterfall, once the first few drops spill over the edge, his words are endless. He struggles to breathe at certain points and he absently feels warm hands caressing his shoulder blades. His face feels warm, and his nose starts to get congested. He realises that he’s probably crying. The taste of salt in his mouth is another indicator. The room has disappeared and all he can see is a blank space the colour of soft blue. He knows he hasn’t stopped talking, but the room remains the same. He is alone, safe to reveal everything.
After the week he had, Harry was no longer shy walking around while holding Draco’s hand. He had been subjected to much worse from the other boy, something as simple as holding hands felt like nothing.
Draco shook his head, “that would be impossible. I cannot have a child my own age. Think with your brain Harry.”
Draco looked up and caught Harry’s eyes. All thoughts of leaving Draco alone left him. The smile Draco bestowed upon Harry was so bright it made Harry’s eyes water. He may sound like a sentimental fool in his head, but that smile blinded Harry to everyone’s auras. It’s as if he finally noticed the surrounding light around Draco. How that was possible was a wonder, but then again he’s magic. Draco beckoned Harry over to sit in the seat next to him, but Harry shook his head. He gestured back to his room with a nod and waited for Draco to stand before he led the way.
So much like the past. It seems there is no change, other than it will not be him dying first. No, in this life Harry is the one who will leave first. Draco hates it.
For a third time, the memories return. It’s as if he needs the catalyst of being close to death to remember. His frustration grows, wondering why his memories are returning and leaving. Why he cannot keep them — wondrous as they are. Wondering why he was given the chance at another life with Harry, for it to be stolen before they can even acknowledge each other.
He is aware of the voices nearing, but he can’t let Draco have the last word in this little game he started. Draco may start their fights, but Harry will always be the one to end it.
They settled into the couch and watched Harry’s favourite comedy show in silence except for the sound of chewing and occasional laughter.
“I cannot be sure,” he says, wishing he could run to his mother’s side. Instead, he calmly stands up and walks as far away as he can from Harry's side. He doesn't miss the slight way Harry's shoulders relax once he finds out that Draco won't give them away.
Oh who was he kidding, he doubted he could pretend to be friends with Draco if this was how things would be if they were
Now they are hidden behind swollen eyelids. He can recognise those eyes anywhere. One does not stare from across the room for years and not recognise them. He wishes he could shout and celebrate that Harry is alive and breathing! He cannot say anything about Harry’s health, for he is but a realist. Despite that, there is hope for them after all!
Curse the Fates! Draco closes his eyes and tangles his fingers through Harry’s hair. It’s as soft as he imagined. And once more, he hates the loss he and Harry have in this life.
Harry followed Draco around with a fond smile. He just enjoyed being there to witness the little bursts of joy that Draco let out.
Aware of Harry’s relaxed smile, Draco continues. He starts to share about the Black family in Hogwarts. How Narcissa hated being apart from her cousin and shared with him the charms to spell a mirror to communicate with each other. Sirius was aware of the image Narcissa had to portray and was willing to keep in contact. That is until Regulus started to spout off about the Dark Lord being their saviour, and Narcissa never heard from Sirius again.
“Anyways… I believe it's storytime!” He rushes to a spare seat opposite Harry on the breakfast bar and waits for Hermione to take her seat beside him. “You may begin.” He waves at them as if a king gesturing to his servants.
“Prat. Let me have my emacity. I know I’m not the only one. Don’t think I didn’t notice you adding another box of chocolates.”
Draco gulped, his throat suddenly dry. His mind was a mess, and before he could stop himself, he replied, “sure. Now?”
It was the weekend before Easter break and he had finally gathered the courage needed to ask if Draco wanted to come home with him. They were browsing through the shops, last minute,  trying to find something interesting to give to Andromeda and Teddy who were staying at Grimmauld Place for the time being.
Draco weighed his options, “I guess that’s understandable.” He leaned away from Potter, finally realising how close together they actually were.
He looked to Ron and Hermione, it seemed as if they heard it too, but they remained frozen, unsure themselves on what to do. It wasn’t any of their business, and they were
He walked out and passed another coworker, Samantha. She beckoned him to follow her by the welcome area and pointed at an occupied table in her section.
He sits up and breathes in deeply. The air is pure and warm. Something settles in Harry and he feels safe, at home.
Harry sniffled and burrowed deeper into Draco, “I’m not sure how Wizard marriage vows sound, but Muggles use ‘til death do us part’. So no, technically they’re not married anymore.”
Harry searched the common room, the library, everywhere. If there was one thing Draco was good at, it was avoiding Harry. Something he had done for the past few weeks. It was a skill Harry initially enjoyed, not wanting to see his nemesis so often. However, he needed to find Draco. He had
“If I am Achilles, then that leads for me to assume that Patroclus is living somewhere right?” Harry considers, crossing his arms together.
, so he decides to take over. “I’d be happy to help in whatever way I can. I think we both have free time now so we could use this to go over… stuff?” Harry ends in a question. He’s never had to tutor anyone before, so he’s unsure about how to start.
Draco’s smile grew at that, and he made to stand. He placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder in an attempt to comfort, much like Harry had tried to do to him. “As weird as it sounds, yeah it makes me feel somewhat better. Thanks for letting me in on your secret. Hope the matchmaking becomes successful. Let me know if you need help with Pansy and Blaise, or other Slytherins. I know things about them that may help you.”
“Haha.” Harry turns to his textbook, which Draco knows wasn’t his. It was sometime last week when Harry finally revealed the source of his sudden knowledge. Draco can respect the advantage Harry decided to take. If there is anything he appreciates about someone, it’s people who find the easy way out to reduce their problems. Now if only he could find a way to ease his problems too.
Draco’s laughter rose above all others and it was to the amazement of everyone that a little glow emitted from and oblivious Harry and Draco. It grew brighter at the point where their hands were clasped.
This time, there was no huge scene of Draco gasping. He gently lifted his hand off the arrow and nodded to Flitwick as he walked toward the door. He glanced at Harry, who was relieved to see the pink tint had gone and looked away quickly.
“The most peculiar thing happened mate. To me and Mione earlier. We were just talking about our winter plans, what we’d do when we go out and explore in Muggle London when Malfoy, of all people, came over.”
“He went on about how things were really bad for him, and that he was being an idiot for not realising what he was welcomed into his life. He listed everything he did against me and apologised for each action. I’ll be honest with you, I barely remembered half of what he did to me, yet he did. He did the same to Mione too… It was so strange. He wasn’t acting the way he normally does. I could tell he was alone, and no one was around us. So I don’t think it was a prank, so you know, I struggled to believe him…”
He reached out with his clean hand and held tightly onto Harry’s thigh, “no, not just flatmate,” he promised.
It must have been so long since Harry last saw him smile genuinely because it was dazzling. Harry blinked and turned his attention to the rest of the class. They too were shocked but refused to make any sudden movements. Harry let go of Malfoy’s arm, which made him whimper at the loss. His grip on the arrow loosened and he grabbed at Harry’s hand linking their fingers together.
He takes out the golden snitch and opens it. The Resurrection Stone is released. He is greeted with familiar faces and his heart is warm. He startles when he sees Remus, but the peace in his face is enough.
Harry finally looked at Draco and watched in anticipation to see what he would do next. His hearing became muffled as Draco touched the Arrow for hopefully the final time.
“We’ve been together for longer than my parents have been married,” Harry finally said into Draco’s chest. He hated how he was crying over something like this. He was a man already, why is he crying about his parents?
Harry blinked at the excited man before him. A Malfoy showing him the hows and whys of the Muggle world? He was curious to know more. “Alright, sure.”
Malfoy shrugged, “They know their flowers. Of course, so do we, but they put their love into their craft. Flowers are another language of their own. You could say sorry by giving someone tulips, for example.” At this, Malfoy looked around, and noticing that no one was paying attention to them, he transfigured his napkin into a pale pink tulip. He handed it over to Harry, who took it silently. “Tulips represent new beginnings, pink represents sincerity, and if it’s pale it also shows sympathy.”
Draco lifted his head, his eyes moving between Harry’s. Harry was silent, letting him gather his thoughts. He tried to keep his heart steady when Draco pouted petulantly; their faces were so close. If Harry just leaned forward–
Harry nods silently, quickly hugs Draco once more and heads out. Draco’s strength during the last few minutes gives way and he collapses against the guest chair. However, a familiar piece of wood is poking his hip.
From what he could grasp from the conversation, Draco – blondie – and Harry – curly – were dating for two months and hadn’t told their friends, until that day. Ron – ginger – was very vocal and visually upset by this news. Mark winced when he heard how Harry used to date Ron’s sister and was now dating the ‘Ferret’ which he assumed was Draco. The nickname was obviously lacking in love as it caused Draco to almost climb over the table, but Pansy – pixie-cut – restrained him. The other two, Hermione and Blaise, were taking in the situation calmly. Hermione actually confessed how she thought they had chemistry during their years in school, and that she should have seen it coming. Blaise surprised the table by agreeing with her and saying how the school had placed bets on this relationship coming to fruition.
Harry struggles in picturing it, but he smiles nonetheless. Draco’s storytelling is mesmerising. He uses his hands to extend his points, his face changes and glows in his laughter. Harry places his face on his palm and continues to listen.
“I have no problem with older, but I definitely do have one with women,” Harry teased back, uncaring of how it would sound. He had lost his chance to come out and surprise Ron and Hermione. They had such knowing looks when he told them, it had frustrated him to no end.
“H-Harry,” his head tilts to the side, allowing for more of Harry’s ministrations, “you can’t leave a mark like last time. I had to lie about a one-night stand to Blaise.”
. First of all, I’m very kind and keep to myself. I know how to be respectful to my elders – within reason – and can follow rules. Also within reason. Thirdly, –”
He placed the bouquet Cally made on the ground by the headstone. Starting to feel an ache, he settled himself and sat cross-legged. He fiddled one of the baby’s breaths. Some had silver glitter glued on their edges rubbed off onto his fingers. From what Harry knew of Teddy’s glitter, it would take forever to get rid of.
Mark blinked and nodded. He wasn’t one to judge. If he was in the same position, he too would like to be inebriated for the whole meal. The four other people on the table quickly told him their orders. He was grateful to leave the stifling atmosphere and walked to the bar.
Adoration for the man before him skyrocketed. Harry wasn’t very vocal about saying how much he loved Draco. Draco assumed it was a result of never hearing it often enough growing up. He hadn’t either, but at least he had a mother who doted on him constantly, so it was easier for him to express his love for Harry. He felt Harry tense, so he waited for him to gather his courage and words.
“I… something came up… I have no idea how I didn’t notice… Mione was the one who pointed it out to me… I wouldn’t have said anything otherwise you know? I didn’t know… I was just so stupid, I should’ve read the whole thing. And now we have a misunderstanding and like I didn’t mean to —”
Harry returned to the Godric’s Hollow cemetery. The last time he visited was on his father’s birthday in March. Thinking about it, why had he not realised his cluelessness regarding his parents’ anniversary sooner? There surely must be a limit on his obliviousness, right?
Draco scoffs and fixes his robes, which became displaced when Ron pushed against him. “None of your business Weasel. Just a minor disagreement.”
The dares continued in that fashion. When it was to the glee of a pink-faced Seamus that he dared Harry to kiss Draco ‘
, he surmised. Being Draco’s Auror partner this past year was very educational. Whenever Draco was flustered, he tended to say things without thinking about it properly. It also made Harry see him in a different light. He was interested to see if they could be more; they certainly had the chemistry. They knew each other’s tells and were so attuned to each other that they didn’t have to communicate verbally whenever they duelled dark wizards. If this was going to progress into further – like he had been hoping for the past two months – then he needed this confrontation now.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and lifts his wand, spelling the table clear of Ron’s crumbs. Ron sniffs, he could have done it himself. How dare Malfoy to assume he couldn’t.
Draco finds himself opening up about the little tidbits his mother shared when they were alone. Away from his father’s ears. Tales of pranks gone wrong, pranks gone right. Laughter filling the corridors in the Most Noble House of Black. Despite how grim it is now, in the past it was anything but. Children would fill the many rooms. Sirius and Regulus would play in the gardens with Andromeda and Narcissa. Bellatrix would bring her classmates over and study, but when she was done, she too would partake in the revelry.
“Right. Harry, then,” she paused, allowing him to nod in agreement, “okay. So I have noticed something about you. Wait, scratch that, the whole castle has noticed something about you. And I need you to know that you’ve been properly warned before you go on such a path.”
“You’re a bad friend to Harry if you give things away as easily as this,” yet, he stands up and heads for the bakery section.
Magic may have saved his mortal soul this time around, but the Fates cannot allow the memories to remain. After all, the boy lives with a known powerful Legilimens. It could bring ruin to what they have planned.
him slowly. He felt prickly in his skin, and he felt the urge to take a long cold shower. He avoided everyone’s eyes and took another gulp from his glass.
He cast a spell to remove all the dust in the room and smiled when he found it easier to breathe. He walked over to the dresser and traced his fingers against the grain. He could imagine Remus staring into the mirror, much like he was doing then. What thoughts went through Remus’ head when he stayed here? Did he hope to win, or was he preparing for the worst? With a sigh, Harry bent down and opened some of the drawers.
Draco leaned up and gave an affectionate peck to his forehead. He resettled onto his pillow, this time folding his arm up so he could lean on his bicep. His hand raised, tracing along Harry’s hairline, down to his jaw.
Draco rolled his eyes and patted his cheeks, “whatever floats your boat. Let’s go- oh! Look over there! Those onesies are precious! Harry! Quick, before they’re gone!”
“Not particularly, no. I guess you could say I just got used to a routine, and now it’s changed. I feel like a rug was pulled from beneath my feet.”
) and patted his hand against Harry’s, where it was resting just above his belly button. “Took you long enough to recognise, but it’s okay. I’ll accept it. Better late than never, they say.”
He hid his wince once he realised how tight his clenched fists had got. Somehow his nails dug into his palms. He could feel wounds starting to form, but it would be stupid to check for the crescent-shaped moons.
Draco’s eyebrows raised, was Potter acting thick on purpose? “Yes? Who else would I be talking to? Peeves isn’t anywhere near us, and if he was I doubt I would have been quiet with him. Not after – that’s beside the point. What the heck is that?” Draco pointed at the thing Potter pulled out of his ear.
Two weeks later, Ron whistled as he walked into the coffee room on their floor. When he did, all he could do was stare; his whistling fading until he was just pouting. There in front of him stood Harry and Draco. They were facing the same direction, and Harry’s arms encased Draco. His palms resting on the counter in front of them. Harry’s chin was resting on Draco’s shoulder. The two were whispering into each other’s ears.
“I dare you to kiss someone –” Harry looked up at Terry, and was about to go for a forfeit before Terry raised his hand to catch his attention again, “I wasn’t finished, dearest Potter. I have a specific person in mind.” His fellow housemate, Michael, leaned in to whisper in Terry’s ear, a name which caused him to nod eagerly, “Malfoy! I dare you to kiss Malfoy!”
“You promised. You promised.” Malfoy’s voice cracks, he sounds so downtrodden that Ron can’t help but feel bad for him.
“I cannot be alive if he is. It’s one or the other. I obviously don’t want to do this, but Riddle believes in it. So I must…”
Upon returning for their eighth year after the war, there had been civility between those against Voldemort and those who cowed before him. It had increased to friendships, particularly with Blaise and most of the Gryffindor boys. His dark sense of humour was right up Seamus’ alley and the two would often be found snickering away by the fireplace in the common room.
, he heard her mutter. He turned to glare at her, not liking how people thought less of him for things that
One of them, Harry wasn’t sure who groaned into the kiss. Harry turned so that Draco was on top of him. He welcomed the weight with glee and stroked his hand up Draco’s back, bringing his jumper up with it, revealing his white polo shirt. Harry repeated the motion, this time with Draco’s shirt. The gasp Draco let out allowed Harry entrance, and from then on Harry couldn’t remember what happened. He was lost in Draco’s touch.
Harry had stopped tying his shoes and instead slipped to sit down on the ground, leaning against the leg of his bed. He took a look at his walkman, wondering if he was hearing things that he wasn’t supposed to. He returned his attention to Ron who continued to look as if he had been confunded.
This time the lady with a black pixie-cut interrupted him, “I think we have decided our food orders. I’ll have the Saumon Fumé, please.”
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco, “I hear that so much. You’ve got your mother’s eyes, you’ve got your father’s hair yadda yadda yadda.”
He hears the familiar woosh of a broom and turns to it. There he is swift on his broom, much like how he used to be when they raced around the fields. Draco was always one step behind — interesting how little has changed between them. Where Harry of the past thrived in combat, Harry of now was gifted in flight.
The game continued on until it landed on Draco. He stared into Blaise’s eyes, wondering what could happen if he chose truth, and knew it would be safer to choose dare. “Dare,” he declared, eyes widening only after when he caught Blaise’s eyes wander over to Harry.
The room suddenly increased in volume much to the irritation of the inhabitants who enjoyed the solace. Harry supposed one of the school buses had arrived and brought with it more stressed sixth formers. He suddenly sat up, realising that it probably meant there was someone who could help him. He quickly tidied his notes away and searched through the influx of grumbling students. He wasn’t sure if he would be given help in the first place, but it was worth a shot. The person in his mind wasn’t exactly close friends with him. Hopefully, they were friendly enough with each other that helping him wouldn’t be too much of a burden.
He closed his eyes and pictured the past. Blond hair, so alike to the gold of the snitch, both of which always held his attention. Even now, his attention was centred on the same person. That blond hair, artfully styled, framed angled features that were, simply put, captivating.
Draco noticed the crouching form his father was pointing toward. He used every bit of control he had left. He kept his face blank as he approached the kneeling boy. The scent of damp grass emanated from him, yet it wasn’t strong enough to mask that
Harry looks up and flushes when he sees Draco watching. His eyes turn to the cauldron that he forgot about. “Right, right.” He can’t help but wonder why Draco’s words disappoint him.
There wasn’t much to catch Harry’s attention anymore. Before the Eros’ Arrow debacle, he was perfectly content to blend into the background. Though, that was futile as he might as well have walked around with neon signs pointing to him. This time, however, there was the quiet in his life that he had been so desperately seeking. Only, this silence was so uncomfortable. The common room was uncomfortable. Being alone felt… uncomfortable.
Harry jumps, his wand ready to cast a curse. He thankfully isn’t successful because it’s only Hermione. She too has her wand out, and on the count of three the two put their wands away.
Harry turns Draco’s face so that they’re looking at each other, “you’ve got to reach out when things get bad. Dumbledore has always been kind and is willing to help. I’m sure he can help you.”
Harry quickly tidied away the items in the box but kept one picture out. The one of his parents slow dancing, with Sirius photobombing. He imagined a silver frame, decorated in silver lilies and pearls. When his eyes opened, the picture was safely encased in its new home. He traced his parents form with his forefinger and smiled to himself.
Harry finished his remaining water and pastie. He pushed off the little crumbs in a futile attempt of cleaning the flakes off. He stupidly wore a wool jumper and the more he shoved, the smaller the flakes got; the more they burrowed into the gaps.
“Ah ah ah Longbottom my boy, there is more to come for today’s festivities!” Seamus sat next to Neville and manhandled him into a chokehold. “I and my lovely assistant, Dean-oh, have come bearing gifts!
“That’s not what I meant when I said I couldn’t say it. I couldn’t say it because I was nervous about how you’d take it. For months I knew you weren’t happy since I told you about the lack of soulmate. I didn’t know if you’d be happy once I told you that you actually had one, or angry when you found out that you were stuck with me. I only found out about this today, and I needed to tell you.”
“I think she wasn’t aware of the outcome. I remember her being distraught for some time in the summer. I would guess she… She found out about what happened…”
Draco smiles and leans into Harry, sighing when his arms tighten around him. “Besides,” he starts, “I’m a better blond than you.” He closes his eyes and joins in when he feels Harry’s chest rumble with laughter.
Harry nodded and placed the mug on the coffee table before him. He paused before placing it on the silver-plated coaster. Something about ‘coasters’ and the word ‘sunny’ was making him wonder.
The Fates tried to wash him out, making it seem as if he could blend in with the crowd. Yet, doing so only called his attention to Draco more. He was just so
Harry walks in front of Draco into the classroom, “I got another missive from Slughorn. He wants us to redo the Amortentia and its antidote since that was the one you messed up on last time.”
He heard the kitchen door open and familiar footsteps creep up behind him. He wasn’t surprised to find his neck kissed multiple times. Harry kicked backwards and grinned at the Draco’s shout of feigned outrage. Hands found themselves around Harry’s waist, snaking around until he was hugged from behind. Draco’s chin tucked into Harry’s shoulder.
“I wonder if that’s how our wands work, with the interwoven magic! Oh! And our brooms! Think of all the spells woven into the different types of wood! Draco–” Harry looks up and his eyes widen at the dishevelled state Draco’s in. His tie has been loosened, and his eyes are glassy, lost in thought. Harry’s mouth dries at his obvious distress. “Draco?” He questions, straightening his posture. “Is there– is there anything wrong?”
Draco huffs, carrying the different vials of ingredients over, “your way is faster. It’ll get us out faster. I’m looking forward to enjoying my free time for once. So if you please?”
On the other half of the Potions classroom, it’s as if a cloud of darkness has covered one table. One boy, in particular, has his hands buried in his normally immaculate hair. His frustration is obvious to anyone paying attention by the three broken quills next to his notebook. He is unable to figure out exactly where he went wrong, but a manicured finger breaks his vision and points at a particular sentence in his textbook.
Draco led the way this time, looking at Harry over his shoulder, “you’ll do the same as last time right?”
Harry turns to Ron and Hermione who managed to escape faster since they were closer to the door. On Draco’s side, he seems to be the only one who managed to make it through. He takes a moment to reflect on the friends he lost to the room.
