"It got to the point that there was no apology afterward, but I still stayed because he made me fear him. He'd tell me things like if I left, he'd kill me or worse harm my son. He made it so I couldn't tell anybody, not even my mother, what was going on. Then one night he was beating me pretty badly, and Scorpius step in and tried to stop him." Draco broke down into a sob as soon as he said Scorpius's name. "He punched my child, and broke his jaw."
"Umm, well I'm not really sure. I've never really done anything like this." Harry admitted.
"That is the most beautiful sound I've ever heard you make." Harry whispered as he pulled away. Draco didn't stop though he kissed his way down to Harry's neck and started biting and licking till Harry let out a loud moan.
"I'm sorry sir, I can't give out that information. Have a nice day." He replied and hung up.
The waitress sat the water and coffee on the table. "Oh yeah how so?" Harry smile grew but he hid it as he took a long drink of water.
All day Sunday Draco worried about if he was doing the right thing. He knew Harry was different from his ex, but he was still so afraid. it was driving him mad. He had liked Harry since the first time he saw him, but his fear had taken over. Now he didn't know how he felt.
"A-are you sure?" Harry asked. His arousal was growing.
Harry also wasn't sleeping. He couldn't, Draco was running through his head, leaving him worried and scared. What if Draco didn't feel the same thing he felt? A knock on his door shook him from his thoughts. He got up and put on some sweatpants. He looked through the little window on his front door and was shocked at what he saw, a shirtless Draco shivering in the corridor. He threw the door open, "Draco what are you doing?" He said letting his eyes wonder over Draco's bare chest. He could feel himself stir in his boxers.
I love all of you, always.
"Do you want to go on a date tomorrow?" Draco asked.
"I-I-I..." I tried to say but he placed one finger to my lips.
"I'd love to!" Draco said as he gracefully sat down with Griffin on his lap.
Harry POV
Harry looked down contemplating if he wanted to say it or not. He finally built up enough of his courage and decided to just come clean. "Well..." Draco leaned in closer, "when I first saw you actually."
Draco grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him to the bed. He bent Harry over it then leaned over him. As he undid Harry's trousers he whispered in his ear, "Only a few seconds and I already have to punish you."
Once he had entered the club, he was immanently struck by the pumping music and flashing lights. There were both male and female strippers dancing in cages and on poles, and topless waiters and waitresses were serving drinks. A woman dressed in only leather panties and high heels came up to him.
" Draco, I think you make me happy." Harry cliched his face blushing at how corny that sounded, but if only he could have seen how big Draco was smiling.
Five minutes later Miguel came into the cell, "by the way, your price just went down."
"Oh, Merlin, Dray. You feel so good." Harry whispered in his ear.
"Pull your pants down and bend over the bed." Draco smirked.
I was just stepping out of the shower when there was a loud knock on my front door. "Hold on!" I yelled. Who could be here so early. I thought to myself as I threw my button up shirt on and zipped up my pants. There was a second knock even louder than the first.
"Oh, you found it sexy, did you?" Harry knew Draco was flirting now, by the way his eyes changed and his smirk grew.
"Yep! Pretty easy huh? I'm Guessing you're a..." Harry paused and pretended to think hard, "A Hufflepuff."
"Thank you, harry." I said as I turned and helped him off the counter.
"w-what?" He asked.
As I wrote Teddy's name I felt my chest tighten and tears were now splattering the paper.
"Well you didn't stop me last night." Draco teased as He leaned down and kissed Harry.
"Harry, I love you so much." Draco whispered.  Harry's heart fluttered.
"I love you." I said against his lips
"Thank you." As he brushed my cheek there was a knock on the door and I jumped. He smiled, "Are you ready?"
"No, you goof. You have no idea, do you?" He cupped my face staring into my eyes. I just shook my head hoping I hand forgot our anniversary.
"Look at me." Draco demanded. Potter obliged. "Undo my trousers." Harry unbuttoned Draco's trousers. "Now pull my cock out." Shaking, Harry stuck his hand into Draco's pants, gently gripped Draco's cock and removed it from his trousers. He was amazed at how long it was. Long, throbbing and pink. Without being told he scooted forward a little and licked the tip, tasting Draco's pre-cum. Draco couldn't help himself, he threw his head back and moaned. Draco's moan sent chills through Harry’s body, going straight to his own cock. He took Draco's tip into his mouth and swirled his tongue around it. Draco had to fight the urge to grip Harry's hair and throat fuck him. He figured since this was Harry's first blow job that that wouldn't be a good idea. He settled for clawing at the arms of his chair.
"Always call you master." Harry whispered nervous for what was about to come.
"Well, I just got home and guess who was sitting on my front step?" Harry said.
"But first I'm going to cum all over your face and make you lick all of it up!" Draco gripped Harry's head tighter and began thrusting harder and more erratic. "Fuck, God yes! I'm cumming Harry!" He pulled out and released all over Harry's lips and chin. "Lick it off." He ordered through his panting.
"What does that mean?" Draco asked, even though he kind of knew.
"I'd love to go! It’d be great to catch up!" Harry said excited to spend some time with Draco. He saw Draco smile a little but try to hide it."
"Please Harry, I need more." he said sliding his hand into Harry’s pants and gripping his arse. Harry sat up and started unbuttoning Draco’s pants the slid them off leaving him in just his boxers. He started kissing just above the waist band making Draco bite his lip and grip the sheets.
"Harry, if you ever need anything please tell me."
"Yes, really. But be quiet. Scorpius is sleeping. Harry walked through the fireplace as Draco stood up.
"Fuck off, Potter!" Draco said but he was having a hard time putting any bite in his bark.
"I wouldn't ask if I wasn't sure." Draco giggled again.
"I thought no one would believe me, and the people I did tell couldn't do anything for me." Harry wrapped his arm around Draco.
"'Are' as in I still am?" Harry was smiling from ear to ear now.
Draco ran his hand along Harry's back as he moved to be behind Him on the bed. He gripped Harry’s arse cheeks and spread them so he could get a good view of Harry's hole. He placed his thumb over is and teased it. Harry moaned and pushed back. Draco lifted his wand again and did a quick cleaning spell to ensure Harry's insides were clean then accioed the jar of lube from the bed side table.
"Ok let’s go to the bathroom first and wash your hands and face. then we'll walk down to the park." Draco took Scorpius by the wrist and lead him to the bathroom while harry waited. then they walked the half a block to the park. once there Scorpius took off running to play on the toys.
Soon it felt like he was trudging through mud and it got worse the close he got. He refused to give up though. Not seeing Draco again would be worse than death. He trudged on finally he was just in tech of the light. He could see Draco on the other side. Draco reach through and took his hand pulling him through.
"Yes, master." Harry was staring at the floor between them.
Draco sighed, "Yes."
The man turned and elegantly sat down on one of the couches while Harry stopped about five feet away.
"Goodnight Scorp. “Harry ruffled Scorpius's hair then went to the door.
"My ex-husband was extremely abusive to Scorpius and me. So much so he nearly killed me in front of my son. No one believes me because he was a noble pure-blood. I'm afraid of that happening again. I'm afraid of someone hurting me, or worse, my son." Draco was sobbing now. Harry hugged him tightly. His heart was crying for this poor man.
Harry's shook his head. Surely, he couldn't have been talking about him. He followed him over a week ago! He couldn't be talking about him, but what if he was? What if Draco liked him?! Did he like him back? A loud voice in his head practically shouted at him "fuck yes you do!" Harry shook his head and went to bed.
"Teddy." I giggled as he squeezed tightly around my neck. My eyes never left Draco who had the most amazing smile I had ever seen plastered on his face.
Harry slid his tongue in and out of Draco's tight hole, gently lubing it up. He they slipped a finger in and curled it automatically hitting Draco's prostate.
"Thank you, Harry. His name is Abelard Coventry."
"Fuck! The things you do to me!" Draco exclaimed.
"Harry!? You're so early!" Draco exclaimed jumping behind the door so just his head was showing.
I stared at my fingers; every crease, every shadow. They almost looked fake. Like they were drawn by some realism artist.
Draco blushes but was soon moaning and writhing as Harry lower his head and took all of him in his mouth. He conjured some lube wandlessly and pressed his finger to Draco's hole, gently inserting it.
"Aww!" both Scorpius and Harry exclaimed.
McGonagall was smiling at him from behind the podium "Quite all right, Everyone I would like to introduce the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Harry Potter."
Draco had gotten up from the couch and was now stand with one arm out stretched and the other on Scorpius's shoulder. "It’s nice to meet you Teddy." He said as smiled and shook Teddy's hand.
"Yep, a Hungarian Horntail, the most dangerous dragons there is!"
"Oh yeah? What about?" Draco asked.
"I doubt that, I'm naturally good at everything."
It was Sunday night and Harry was lying in bed scrolling through Instagram again. He was kind of addicted. Suddenly he noticed Draco posted. He pulled it up and nearly passed out. The picture was one of the sexiest of Draco he had ever seen. It was in black and white and Draco was lying on a red chaise lounge chair in just black satin boxers Griffin was laying on the end of the lounge chair looking regal as ever.
He swung his legs out of bed and stood up then walked into his living room and sat on the sofa. He accioed his wallet and thumbed around in it for the right card. finally, he pulled out a little black card that read "The Underground Night club; exotic dancers, escorts, and Professional Dominatrix". A work friend had given it to him one day when he was complaining about his sex life.
"True, very true." Harry laughed.
"Dinner service." Harry replied making Draco laugh.
"Fuck yes! Harry! I love your tight little hole! My dirty little slut!"  Draco yelled. He grabbed Harry's head and pulled him down against him still thrusting inside of him. "Do you like when I fuck you, my little slut?"
Harry carried him into his bedroom and fell to the bed, Draco's legs still wrapped around him. He kissed his way down letting his tongue tease Draco's nipple as he passed, till his lips were pressed against the waist band of Draco's lounge pants. He slowly slid them off and watch as the man beneath him turned as red as a cherry.
"That's amazing!" Harry exclaimed. He was quite impressed by how much Draco had changed since they're school days. What once was a spoiled, outgoing prat was now a shy and kind man.
"I love you too, Draco." Harry whispered as he gently laid Draco down in the bed, "now relax, my love, the healers will be back soon to prepare you for surgery."
And other week went by and Harry was over at Ron and Hermione's for dinner. He was sitting on the sofa mindlessly scrolling again while Ron was in the bathroom and Hermione was cooking dinner. He noticed Draco posted something and went to read it. When he did, his heart sank.
"Because it makes the moment sexier." Draco smiled at the thought of making love to Harry.
"Draco, of course I did. I've never felt this strongly for someone in my life." He cupped Draco's face trying to get him to look at him, but he refused.
Draco flirtatiously moved so his arms were folded on the side of the tub and his chin was resting on his forearm. "Do you want to get in with me?" Draco giggled.
"Yes, I'm looking for room 202?" Harry replied.
"Do you need me to stop?" Harry asked concerned.
"Ugh, the super sexy one with you in nothing but boxers." Harry said quietly.
"What do you think you're afraid of?" Draco took Harry's hand.
McGonagall started the feast, food appearing on all the tables, and everyone began to tuck in.
Then there was Teddy. He held all my biggest regrets. One look from his beautifully innocent face and every memory of the war flooded back into my brain like  tidal wave. Seeing the faces of Remus and Tonks in his, set my every being ablaze. He would still have parents if it wasn't for me.
"Yes master!" Harry began meeting all of Draco's thrusts.
"What’s wrong, love? Are you scared?" Draco cupped Harry's face.
"It's a surprise!" Draco smiled.
Draco smiled some more and shook his head, "okay, come through."
Draco blushed and looked away.
Scorpius smiled then headed up stair to brush his teeth and put on his pajamas.
Soon he was in a bright white room. There was no furniture, it was just a white cube. He felt a tap on his shoulder, so he turned around. There was Draco smiling back at him. He quickly took Draco into his arms and held him tightly
He felt the warmth of Draco's tongue again, lapping at his hole. Then a finger being inserted inside him. He moaned and pushed against it.
Hermione,
Harry rushed to his side and when Draco finally realized who was there, he began to cry harder. Harry untied him and removed the ball gag. Once freed, Draco shied away from harry and sobbed ever more.
"You're mine right now." He heard Draco say right next to his ear. Then he felt Draco nibble his lobe and kiss his way down to his chest biting down and making a huge hickey.
A couple big guys picked Draco up and began staging I'm down the hall. They climbed a couple flights of stairs and soon they were in another much nicer hall. They soon stopped at a door which Miguel opened with a key and signaled the men to throw Draco in. The room was very nice there was a four-poster bed and a bathroom to the left of where Draco was laying on the floor. The decor was done in deep reds and burgundies with dark wood floors and furniture.
"I love you too Draco. With all my heart." Harry squeezed Draco tightly not wanting to let him go.
"Oh, I'll have my fun. " he said staring at Draco intently.
Besides me I could see pale skin reflecting the bright light of the room and shimmering white hair. The pearlescent skin was so bright I couldn't see his features. "Maybe I am dead, maybe he's my angel." I thought.
"Do you need me to stop?" I asked.
Once Draco was satisfied with Harry's mouth he pulled away and started kissing, licking, and nibbling Harry's neck. Harry let out another moan, but something inside of him didn't sit right. He was afraid Draco would regret this in the morning if they went any farther. "Draco, are you sure this is what you want?" He asked.
" Do you still want that whiskey?" Draco asked avoiding the question.
"Of course, Ron." I said I reached out my hand for him to shake it. He looked as surprised as I had a few moments ago but shook it as we put our differences aside, knowing we now had common ground. Helping Harry.
About 10 minuets later pomfrey walked in, talked to Dumbledore for a few minutes then “Draco can you stand for me please” she asked Draco stood up avoiding both of their eyes. She preformed some spell on him it made him feel a bit weak but he could handle it.
A little while after the Spring holiday, which he hadn’t gone home for but had spent time with Harry doing all sorts of stuff, (sneaking into Hogsmeade being one)had finished and everything seemed to be going ok Draco was awoken from his sleep in the common room by none other than Snape.
McGonagall was fixing up the great hall when he went to sit down. He bowed his head he didn’t expect to cry but he did it was soft and quiet he had learned to do that, he didn’t know where he was going to go he just wanted to have a bath and sleep.
Idiot
“Y..you want me to break up with Harry?” Draco asked dumbfounded. “Draco please understand this is to try and protect both of you and at the moment its to early to say for how long, I’m sorry” Dumbledore said looking sad at the pair.
“Lets get home shall we” Harry said “do you wanna come back with me Dray?” Harry asked grabbing his hand. “Can i?” “Of course, we have catching up to do anyway” Harry said.
“That’s good I suppose, if your happy, when did this happen?” “3 days ago” Harry said, Hagrid looked even more confused that the last times. “No it’s been 3 years” Draco corrected him. “Well I only remembered 3 days ago” Harry said scratching his head looking up at Hagrid “it’s a long story” Harry and Draco said in unison.
“Mr Potter firstly well done on defeating you know who” the healer said sort of awkwardly and shuffling his feet about “I have a job to do I suppose, where would you like me to examine you” “uh in here’s is fine isn’t it?” Harry asked. “Of course Mr Potter” “you can call me Harry” “oh ok Harry is it ok if you come over here” the healer said pointing to the couch on the other side of the room.
“Can you wait here while i get madam pomfrey” “wait why!” Draco shouted. “I want to make sure you are ok Draco, have a seat please”
Draco accio a quill and parchment and wrote him a letter putting a note to when it should be opened on the front  ‘To be opened when the war is finished, trust me’ Draco then waited for Harry to leave which didn’t take long as he had a lesson with snape soon.
Draco started to put the stuff back in the box “what are you doing” Harry shouter confused. “I want to get back home, we can look at them at home” Draco explained. “Could you bring that case over here for me please” Draco asked pointing to the Slytherin case next to his wardrobe. Harry lugged the piece of wood over placing it on Draco’s bed where Draco opened it and placed the box into it and locking it.
“Stop spying on people Potter” Draco didn’t bother removing the invisibility cloak Harry probably hit himself coming down anyway why make it worse for both of them.
“Can I see then?” Harry asked getting closer to the bed cautiously sitting at the end. “Yeah come here” Draco said holding his hand out. Harry jumped over to Draco to sit next to him, grabbing his hand, taking a look at the stuff laid out. “It’s us” Harry gasped. “I know it’s lame but I kept a load of us, hid it all away after you know.” “It’s not lame it’s cute” Harry said grabbing the photo from Draco’s hand, it’s was both of them with draco sleeping on Harry’s lap at the lake. “Aww you look so cute” Harry coed kissing Draco’s cheek.
Harry seemed to sense Draco’s distress as he woke up just as Draco had given up trying to move. “W...What’s wrong, are you ok?”Harry started to panic fumbling about getting his glasses and trying to get in Draco’s eye line. Draco kept crying, Harry not knowing what do do besides let Draco cry, gently brought him into a cuddle like a teddy but being careful of Draco’s arm after he winced.
"Please, Harry!" I hadn't even realized I had begun to sob. "Please." I whispered again. This somehow shook him, and the shard shattered on the floor. He began to sob with me and fell into my embrace.
"So, is this really what you wanted to talk about?" Draco smiled.
"Again, I'm really sorry." He said kissing Harry's cheek.
"Roll over." Harry whispered as he pulled out. Draco got on all fours with his ass in the air and without warning Harry slammed inside of him once more.
"Mm what partook in these dreams of yours?" it felt so good to finally be flirting back and forth.
"Oops, busted!" Harry laughed. Draco laughed in return. They both picked up the plates of food and walked them over to the Breakfast table.
"H-harry, w-wait." I looked up to meet his eyes as he propped himself up on his elbows.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he licked his lips and used his fingers to get what he couldn't reach, sucking the cum off them as well.
"Yep." Harry smiled as he got down to eye level of the 5-year-old. "During the Triwizard tournament. I out flew him on my broom."
"Yes master." Harry replied. He felt Draco move up his body, finger still fucking his ass.
THE NEXT MORNING
"No, Beautiful, they would never leave you. Hermione just believes I can help you more than they can." Everything about that sentence confused the hell out of me. I just sat there, blinking, again, trying to figure out if this was reality. I don't even think Draco realized everything he had just said in that one statement. Did Draco Malfoy just call me beautiful AND refer to Hermione by her first name!? Not only that there was care in his eyes!
"Well, with medication and potions you'll be able to live a normal life actually. You'll even be able to have sex normally without fear of spreading the disease." The doctor said.
"Do you know?" Draco looked a little surprised.
" I'm not going to lie. You should have told her before, but what's done is done and she knows now and both of you can start to heal and find something that makes you happier." Draco's word made Harry feel a little better and he smiled.
Harry brushed some hair out of Draco's face and Draco shot up in bed screaming.
"Of course, we are, but let's clean you up first." Draco said wiping his son's face with a napkin.
There was Draco tied up, bruise and bloody being fucked by a large man. He was screaming and cry but they were muffled by a ball gag which the man was pulling on making his head arch in and awkward angle.
After he got both Draco and Scorpius to calm down, He made them pancakes and spent the day trying to make them forget, even if it was just for a few seconds, the whole ordeal. They went and got Ice cream, played in the park, and when they got home Harry told Scorpius as many stories as the little boy could handle. He fell asleep in the living room with his head on Harry's lap and Draco, wrapped in Harry's other arm, stroking his hair.
"Please... I need...more... I need you.... Please I need you inside me." I moan against him and pulled myself up his body. I dug around in hi side table till I found his lube and giggled at the fact that it was vanilla flavored.
"4 o'clock 12 Grimmauld place. He asked for you personally, he’s never done that before. He said you’d know what he likes as far as what to wear." The text from Miguel read. Draco smiled and started a message to Harry.
I Could now feel some pricking the corners of my eyes, but I shook them away along with the breaking I felt in my heart. Not able to speak anymore she handed me a small scroll of tear stained crumpled parchment.
"I'm close too." He screamed, "fucking hell, Harry."
He did this multiple times throughout the day. Draco just made him so horny.
"I like when you blush. It's kind of cute." This time Harry didn't know what he was saying so he shook his head and decided he was done eating. "We should talk sometime; I like the new Draco." He practically whispered in Draco's ear as he stood and left the hall.
"Kneel in front of me, pet." Draco ordered.
As I pushed on finger inside, I began sucking the rest of his length into my mouth.
"Granger, what's going on?!" He exclaimed. She could tell he was scared.
After he had changed into Harry's clothes, he walked back into the living room to find harry had already changed as well and sitting on of the couches.
I gave him a smile and a nod. "He's in his room." I pointed him down the hall and he nodded his thanks.
My green eyes pierced into his Startling silver, and I frowned noticing they held just a tinge of sadness.
"Dad told me one where there were rumors of you coming to school in a flying car!" Scorpius got comfy while Draco tucked him in and sat on the side of the bed.
"No, please move!" Draco begged.
"Better than ok! I'm assuming you wouldn't do this for any other client?" Harry asked.
"Yes, my names Chad Milton." Harry lied.
"ok mister, it's time for bed." Draco said after he finished laughing.
"Well, yeah. Freshly divorced, but don't even think about its Harry. He treated you like shit in school." Hermione warned.
"Y-yes." Harry stuttered.
Draco slowly sat the bottle down and started to shake. Harry wrapped him in his arms, "Baby you don't have to tell me if it’s too much."
"No of course not. It's just if you keep going, I won’t be able to stop myself and I don't know if we should go all the way on our first date." Harry brushed Draco's cheek.
"I can't, I won’t survive." Draco said refusing to look Harry in the eye. Harry lifted his chin so he was looking him in the eye.
"Where would you like to go for dinner?" Harry asked as they walked back to Draco's flat.
Harry laid on the bed feeling like the ass he was. He grabbed his phone and refilled Draco.
Draco gave him a small smile, but he was kind of confused as to why Harry was calling him cute. "I'm sorry, would you rather me still call you Potter?" He asked.
"D-dray..." Harry whispered against Draco's lips, "I-I think I love you."
"What!?" How!?!" Pansy exclaimed shooting up out of bed.
"Wow, I like your hair!" Scorpius exclaimed.
"Draco, it's ok! I just don't want to do it if I think you're going to regret it." Harry slid over and gently removed Draco's hands from his face. He kissed his knuckles. "It's ok love. I'm glad you trusted me enough to give me that. It means the world to me. I just want to make sure we're going at your pace and not the pace you think I want."
Harry followed the guy and watched as he got a drink then went to the other side of the room where all the couches were and the music was charmed to be quieter.
"No! If I would have known I would have never asked you to sit!" Draco tried to spit but there was hardly any malice.
Harry burst into Draco's mouth with a loud shout. He came so hard he convulsed for almost a minute after.
"I-it's just... I was so horrible to you, just because I wanted your attention. I cared about you so much and I just wanted to make sure you saw me. I shouldn't have been so terrible. I'm so sorry Harry." Draco cried. Harry's heart melted at the use of his first name.
"Please, Harry, I'm ready." Draco captured Harry's lips again in a searing kiss. Harry grabbed Draco's arse and pulled him closer so he could feel Draco's cock against his own.  Draco threw his head back and moaned. Harry took the opportunity to attack Draco's throat and chest, leaving hickeys as he went. Draco moved his hands from the tub and drug his nails across Harry's shoulders. "I need to feel you inside of me."
"Are you ok?" Harry asked as he came through the fireplace.
"Not anymore. We divorced 4 years ago."
After dinner Harry walked home. It wasn’t my too far between his place and Ron and Hermione's. Just a couple miles. When he got close to his house, he noticed something moving by his front door. As he got closer his eyes got wide. There was a giant orange cat curled up next to his door. It looked up at him and meowed with a meow that was so squeaky he was amazed it came out of this huge cat.
"Good." He smiled and kissed my forehead, "I hope you’re hungry. I've really out done myself this time."
In one swift motion Harry petrified both Miguel and the man who fell back ward on the floor, letting Draco go.
"What are you crying about? Clean yourself up. No one likes a crying slut. Well not before the fun starts." Miguel laughed at his own cruel joke, as Draco wiped his face and tried to show some courage.
"Uh...uhm. Same thing." Harry finally said giving up on trying to think of a drink. "Fuck!" He whispered.
"Draco, I'm going to cum." Harry whispered in reply.
"Draco, what happened?" Harry stroked his cheek to get him to look at him again. Tears were forming in Draco's eyes.
"You're welcome. Goodnight and good luck. Go get him dragon." pansy hung up the phone and went back to bed.
"Uh... No that's okay, I just came to speak with Harry." He said nervously.
The next day Draco swaggered into Miguel's office.
"I mean Potter." Draco shook his head and blushed. Harry noticed the blush this time.
"Everything will be okay, my love. I'm always here for you. Why don't you relax and I’ll make us some lunch?"
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's body, pulling him to his chest, while still inside of him. "I love you Draco." He whispered in his ear.
"No, love, I just gave you a few shoves. This was all you, and I am so proud of you." He kissed me passionately and wiped a tear from my eye.
Trigger warning (suicide, depression, disassociation, PTSD)
"Hi Draco." Harry gave him a sheepish grin. He was so happy to see the man though.
"Ugh might as well come in. I'm not even close to being ready." Draco said opening the door so Harry could come in.
Harry reaches in front of him and gripped Draco's now pulsating cock, and started rubbing it in Time with his thrusts.
"Everyone wants a piece of this #catestboyever"
"Thank you so much! I hope so too!" Harry exclaimed then he closed the call and went back to pacing. He still didn't know how to ask. 20 minute later he decided he'd just call and see how it went. He gabbed another handful of floo powder and made the call.
"Yes!" Scorpius said eyes wide with disbelief.
"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I don't see how anyone could have done that to you. You're just so perfect." Harry took Draco's hand and started rubbing soothing circles on the back of it.
"Yeah." Harry said sadly.
"Give me a second! Holy Shit! Is it the end of the world or something!?" I yelled again as I approached the door and flung it open.
"Yes master."
"I'm not sure, Scorp." He finally said.
"I haven't done anything yet." I moaned and pressed him back down into the mattress.
"That would be lovely. Where's Scorp?" Harry asked.
"f-faster." He begged. I began to pick up speed till sounds of skin harshly slapping skin filled the room.
"They're not your family, they're mine!" Ommin said as he went to take a step toward Harry. Harry grabbed his wand and pointed it to his throat.
"No shit!? The famous Harry Potter is gay too?!" Draco exclaimed. Harry rubbed the back of his neck and nodded. "How long have you known?"
"What’s the matter, love?" Harry's was full of concern.
"Harry, I'm so sorry. I had to see you." Draco said with pleading eyes.
"How'd you sleep?" Harry whispered.
"He could hear them both sobbing through the door, so he knocked softly and entered.
"Y-you...I need you." Harry removed his fingers and Draco could now feel something bigger push against his hole. "H-Harry." He moaned as Harry pushed inside.
"Are you ready." Harry whispered as he lined up his cock with Draco's hole.
The bartender brought them their drinks and Draco noticed Harry was shaking as he took a sip. He pushed the button again nearly making Harry drop his drink. He sat it on the table clutching it tightly as he tried to keep from cumming.
"Sorry I'm late." He Announced to the now quiet hall as he walked, "Had one last mission to accomplish for the ministry."
"Jump." Harry whispered into Draco's ear as he began to suck and nibble the lobe. Draco obliged and wrapped his long legs around Harry's hips. He could feel Harry's tip against his arse, and It drove him crazy.
"Harry...please..." I begged trying to thrust against me, but I held his hip down with my free hand.
"Yeah! Did you really fight a dragon!?" Scorpius asked jumping up and down.
"Uh, water and maybe some food." Harry replied in an exhausted tone.
"Oh Yeah. Sorry, did you want to tell me something?" Harry asked.
Draco smiled and shook his head. This guy was the complete opposite of smooth, but he liked it. "That was a cheesy save."
"wait, wait, wait! there’s a question in that question. Why did you need a male escort!?" Harry laughed at this and Draco smiled as he had never made harry laugh like that.
"I wish I could do this every night." He whispered as he tucked Draco into bed and kissed his forehead again. He then flooed home.
" I love you too." Harry smiled. Then he felt Draco's cock push against his hole and moaned. Soon Draco was all the way inside of him and he felt full and right.  "Fuck, Draco you feel so good."
By the time Saturday came Harry was nearly pulling his hair out in anticipation. He was so excited to find out what was to come tonight. He had fantasized about it every night that week.
"Mmmm if you keep it up neither of us will eat. Save this for dessert?" Harry asked still leaning into Draco.
"I guess I wasn't good enough for him. I hope I'm good enough for you." Draco was fighting back tears now and Harry could see this.
Harry laid in bed next to Ginny staring at the back of her head. They had just had sex, but this was the 5th time he had to fake an orgasm by doing quick cleaning spell so she wouldn't be able to tell. He just wasn't into it anymore. He was even finding it difficult to get hard anymore. They had been married for 2 years and were talking about having their first child, but how could he do that without ejaculating?
"Well I was thinking I'd introduce you to a friend of mine, who's actually your cousin!" Harry handed Teddy his bag, "But first you need to put your stuff away."
"Now get on your knees in front of me." Miguel commanded. Draco just sat there in defiance. Miguel started to get angry and grabbed him by the hair and forced Draco to the ground. He let out a yelp as his knees were pressed into the carpet and his hair was being pulled so he was facing Miguel.
"Trick or treat!" Said a cute little platinum blond haired boy dressed as a cat.
The bartender gave him a weird look and walked away. He looked at Draco who was smirking at him the whole time.
"Would you keep it down potter? Do you want someone to hear us?" Draco whispered as Harry and him made their way through the abandoned mansion.
"You tell stories about me?" Harry laughed.
"Look at me." Draco ordered. Normally Draco liked when his sub refused to look at him, but with Harry he just couldn't get enough of those beautiful green eyes.
"I don't want you to stop yourself." Draco replied as he kissed and bit Harry's ear. That pushed Harry over the edge, so he picked Draco up and carried him into the bedroom. He laid Draco on the bed and crawled on top of him after kicking off his shoes.
"Everything ok?" Draco asked wickedly.
"So, what do you do?" Draco asked.
Harry smiled and started undressing. He looked up after undoing his belt and noticed Draco was covering his eye. "What are you doing?"
"What do you mean with you!?" he shouted.
Harry turned and sat up to look Draco in the eye, "Do you mean that?"
"I'm yours, harry, I'm Yours’s!" Draco Scream as he came, making harry come as well.
"Money is no problem. Can we do 2 hours to start?" Harry asked.
"It's Okay, Harry. I didn't think he would ever track me down at work, and neither did you." Draco started to calm down.
Harry protects Draco and Scorpius from Draco's ex.
"I love you too, Harry." He whispered against my lips.
After putting the toys away, Harry and Draco went upstairs to tuck Teddy in. "What story do you want to hear?" Harry asked.
"Ok, I'll call him. thanks again Pansy. I'm sorry I woke you. Good night." Draco laughed.
He looked up at the clock that read "10" and realized he had to work early the next morning. He shook his head and looked back at his phone. He debated following Draco but he was having a hard time deciding if he should. After about 10 minutes of contemplating he hit the follow button hoping Draco wouldn't see. Then he laid his phone down and went to sleep.

"Drink this." He ordered.
"I’ll show you, and kick your butt at it!" Harry laughed.
Harry danced for an hour. He liked the masks because he could hit on anyone and get rejected by every one of them because they didn't know he was the chosen one. He weirdly liked getting rejected. Made him feel normal.
"So, what about you?" Draco asked.
"Yes... I need you." I said as I licked a strip up his neck to the shell of his ear.
Warning; abuse, child abuse, description of violence, and light sexual content.
"Fuck." Harry said again as he grabbed Draco's hips and pulled him closer. They danced like this for a few songs. The light touch driving Harry crazy. He finally couldn't take anymore so he wrapped his arm around Draco and place a hand on his cheek to turn his face towards him a little bit. "Malfoy, come home with me."
"Baby, I'm already in pain. Why do you have to break my heart with your tears?" Harry smiles as he felt Draco's warm skin against his.
Harry carried Scorpius to bed and Draco tucked him in. Then they went down to the kitchen for a glass of wine.
"I need you." Draco whispered.
"Hi, Draco." Harry said. Draco sat his glass down and stood from his chair. He swaggered towards Harry and paused, staring intimidatingly at him. In a swift motion he pinned Harry to the door by his wrists and brushed his ear with his lips.
A couple weeks flew by with a few visits from Ron and Hermione, Andromeda and Teddy visiting on Sundays, and even Mr. and Mrs. Weasley stopping by. Harry had a hard time with their visit, but we worked through it and him and I were growing closer and closer. We were basically conjoined at the hip. We even started sleeping in the same bed, not on purpose. We would fall asleep in our separate rooms, but when we awoke the next morning, we'd always be in one or the other's, tangled in each other's arms. I was unable to imagine a life without him and thinking about him leaving could bring me to tears. We weren't even officially and item.
"Because I promised myself, I wouldn't date till I was ready, and what if I’m not ready? I don't want this to end like me a Blaise did. Especially because its Harry, the man of my dreams."
"Harry, thank you so much!" Draco cried melting into Harry's arms with his son in his.
He was just getting changed into some more comfortable clothes when he heard Harry come through the floo. He ran down stairs and fell into Harry's arms.
After he closed the door behind him, I walked up behind Draco and wrapped my arms around him and watch as he plated dinner.
Draco shook his head, “not yet."
Harry cupped Draco's face and tilted it so he could look into Draco's eyes. "Can I kiss you, Draco?"
"Everything okay?" Hermione asked.
"Yeah? Who?" Draco asked.
"There's no chance if us going back to the club tonight is there?" Harry asked feeling the tightness in his trousers.
"What if Sunday I come cook for you and Scorp?" Harry asked.
"Yeah scream for me! I love when they scream!"
"Do you want to dance?" Draco offered.
"Oh fuck! Harry!" Draco moaned as Harry squeezed lightly. Harry removed his hand and Draco looked disappointed in the loss of contact. Harry gripped Draco's pants and slid them down sliding down Draco's body as he did. Once Draco's trousers were off, Harry cupped Draco through his boxers.
"Scorpius’s mother passed away when he was born, and I remarried after, but it didn’t work out. I got divorced about 8 months ago, and I’m raising Scorpius all on my own now. well that hasn't really changed. My ex was never really there." Draco crossed his arms and looked down.
I started to take them three at a time, with each swallow I thought of someone's face. Someone who lost their life for me, or someone who lost someone because of me. Counting my regrets till I was down to my last two pills. My head was starting to spin, and my eyes felt heavy, my stomach felt like it was on fire, but I loved the burn. I knew it was going to be the last thing I felt. I rubbed my fingers over the last two pills in my hands, and laughed, "I'm coming mum and dad." I swallowed them and laid back on the couch, waiting for darkness to take over.
"Get on top of me." Draco ordered as he undid Harry's ropes and laid on the bed.
"Since you were in my dreams all night long, and pretty much since the day I met you." Draco whispered seductively.
"Can Harry tell me a story?" Scorpius asked. Draco looked at Harry as if to ask if he would.
"Harry, you make me very happy." Draco sighed.
He was a ghost of himself hidden in the shell of his body. I had never seen him this broken before. I was so used to the brave and strong boy I knew I school. The one filled with so much determination it made his beautiful green eyes glow, but the man in front of me right now was nothing but a shadow of that. Those emerald green eyes were pale now and filled with unspeakable amounts of pain and guilt.
Harry greedily took his cock into his mouth. Swirling his tongue around the tip and using his hand to play with Draco's balls.
7 o' clock was approaching faster, and faster and now Draco was standing in front of a bunch of flats, wearing a muggle tux, and worrying he was going to be late. Suddenly everything started to move and soon a greyer dingier flat appeared with the number 12 on it. He climbed the stair, straitened his now short blond hair, and knocked on the door.
"So, if I asked you on a date tomorrow would you go?" Harry asked.
"So cruel." Harry smile sexily.
Draco smacked his ass hard and said, "No, not yet." He added another finger, really stretching Harry's tight, tight hole.
"Now then get cleaned up and put that on." Miguel said pointing to some black booty spandex shorts on the bed. "I'll be back shortly to make sure your ready then it’s time for work."
Draco was still in the shower when harry finished his fire call and was getting ready to make pancakes. He was just pulling out a pan when there was a knock on the door. He decided it'd be best if he got it, and he was glad he did. He opened the door to see a broad shoulders dark haired man. The man eyed him up and down, taking note of his pajamas.
"Gross Harry!" Ron shouted back.
"So, Harry, if you don't mind me asking, what's going on at home with Ginny?" Draco asked as he stored more sugar into his coffee the waitress just topped off.
He didn't catch up to him till Draco was at the gates of Hogwarts. "Draco, please wait up!" He called to him. Draco turned to face him with his arms crossed and Harry could see the moon light reflect of the tears on his cheek.
"A deals a deal!" Ron yelled.
"Ask before you cum." Draco whispered in his ear.
"Did you get in trouble?"
"What’s been hard?" Harry was feeling concerned.
"Woohoo!" Scorpius whooped and hurried to get ready for bed.
"S-so I am your crush? For how long?" Harry stuttered.
"Harry!?" He cried. Tear started pouring down his cheeks as he took Harry into his arms as gently as he could.
"For that you'll get 4 smacks." Draco would never admit hearing Harry call his name was a huge turn on but he had made the rules and they must be followed. He raised the leather crop and brought it down on Harry’s backside with a thwack. Harry hissed in pain "One." Draco said. He brought the crop down again with another thwack. "Two." Harry arse was turning red already and Draco's cock was throbbing. Another thwack rang out. "Three." Draco made the last smack a little harder and Harry gripped the bed sheets. "Four." Harry was silent and quivering on the bed. Draco then splayed his hand over Harry's sore bottom, making Harry moan, and leaned forward to whisper in his ear, "Are you okay to go on, Harry?"
"Mm me too." Draco moaned as he pushed his hips so he could feel more of Harry.
"You just called me Harry."
When they got inside, they were immediately under fire, as curses they'd never heard of were slung at them. He watched as the other two Aurors were hit and both fell to the floor. It was just him now. He flipped a table over and continued firing back. He could see there were 8 of them. He was completely out numbered.
"Baby I'm already in pain, why do you have to break my heart with your tears?" Harry smiles.
"I-I was just doing what was right. You didn't have to save me. I didn't deserve it." Tears were pouring down his face and soaking Harry's robe now.
"Y-yes, D-Draco." I moaned.
" Wait a minute!? What do you mean 'you cared about me'?" Harry said sitting down again.
"How'd you get out!" Scorpius was clutching his blanket in excitement.
"I don't know how to explain it, but I have never felt this way before. It's like I'm finally complete, there's no hole in my heart anymore."
"What, Why!?" Harry exclaimed.
"Gods, Draco, you're so fucking tight." Harry moaned. Draco pulled him close and they kissed hungrily while Harry pounded Draco's ass.
The machine shut off and Draco's tongue disappeared.
Harry- "Mmhmm he's curled up on my bed right now. Do you want to come pick him up?"
"Who was that post about?" Harry rushes out.
"Everything will be Ok, sweetheart. No matter what happens I'll be here for you." Harry said.
"This is because of Potter isn't it?" Ommin Whispered loud enough for just Draco to hear.
"Make me cum first!" Draco ordered.
"So, next weekend I’ll have Teddy, and I was wondering if I could bring him over to meet the two of you. He's not too much older than Teddy, so they should get along. I'm not too worried about it, Teddy gets along with everybody." Harry laughed, "What do you think love?"
Draco jumped on Harry and kissed his face." Yes, yes yes! I will marry you Harry!"
"Promise me you'll lean on us when you need to?" He said when he released my head.
"Please master, I need to cum." Harry shouted.
"Yes master." Harry said as he did as he was told. He was now face to face with Draco's leaking cock.
"What do you need, dear?" Draco asked quietly. Harry felt butterflies flutter in his stomach at the pet name.
"Oh well. Leave him there to suffer. He's not going to make it this time." Another said and they all walked away.
My eyes wanted to tear up as I felt my mind breaking for the hundredth time. Maybe I should just give into it. I gripped my hair tightly in my hands and stared at the bottle, my only salvation, sitting on the table. I deserved a muggle way out, then again maybe I'm just afraid I'll survive an unforgivable again.
"Oh, yes please." Harry said as Draco poured him a glass. "Now are you going to answer my question?"
That night neither one of them could sleep. Draco was up all-night thinking about how he might have missed the chance to be with the man he cared for so much. Harry was trying to think of any way he could get Draco to change his mind.
Draco leaned forward and whispered in his ear, "for not calling me master...again... I'm going to make you cum right here in front of everyone. Then I'm going to take you back to the room and punish you."
"To see a friend of mine." I laughed at his pout.
He approached a tall bouncer guarding a door in the back.
After Harry finally peeled his eyes away from Draco's body, he finally read the text and just about had a heart attack.
"George? I wasn't expecting you. I said wiping my hands on a dish towel. "Come in. Would you like to stay for dinner?"
"Can I kiss you." He asked huskily.
"You're so big." Draco's head was tilted back and his eyes were screwed shut.
"But you're okay with feeling all of me pressed up against you?" Harry whispered in Draco's ear as he stepped in and wrapped his arms around Draco's torso.
Draco's POV
"Really well, actually." He turned and pulled me closer to him.
"Can't I stay up tonight?" Scorpius begged.
"Harry Potter!? The man from your stories!?" Scorpius exclaimed.
"Mm, yes." Draco said as he slowly laid back and rested his head on Harry's chest. He could feel every inch of Harry's hard member against his back. "Fuck." Draco said under his breath.
"Sorry, I dropped my phone. I'm just in shock. Draco Malfoy wants to be with me!" Harry shouted. Draco laughed. "So, can I take you out tomorrow? Please say I can."
"What was the first rule potter?" Draco spat.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked.
"D-Draco, what are you doing?" Harry moaned. Draco was expecting a fight, but this turned him on even more.
"Of course, darling."
"Take off your clothes." Draco ordered as they entered the room.
Draco collapsed to the bed and pulled a shaking Harry to his chest. "Are you okay, Harry?" He whispered while holding him close.
Harry started kissing his way down Draco's torso till he reached the hem of Draco's boxers. Then he started biting and sucking on Draco's hips while he slowly pulled off his boxers. He stopped to stare for a minute. "Gods you're so beautiful!" He said.
The door creaked open flooding the cell with light. "Grab him and bring him with us." He heard Miguel’s voice say.
"You will come back to me. I know you will." Draco kissed Harry and hugged him tighter. "You're my brave Gryffindor. You can do this!"
"Oh, that's sad! I remember when we lost our dog when I was little. I was heartbroken!" Hermione said. "Dinners ready."
I smiled looking at the silver band round his finger and rolled over pressing my face into his firm chest. I started to feel my husband begin to stir.
He was aching for more and couldn't stand it anymore, so he took Harry's hands and pinned them to the bed. Then he let his tentacles pulsate around Harry's cock. Harry looked surprised and tried to protest but Draco made one tentacle grow and inserted it into Harry's open mouth, soon he let pleasure take over and began pushing into Draco begging for more. Draco realize moisture was building on the larger tentacle and decided to let it move a little lower to Harry's hole and tease him.
"Okay, you know who I am. Ho... wait a minute." Draco got closer to Harry backing him up against the wall. "Potter? Remove that ridiculous glamour." Draco demanded. His voice sent shivers down Harry's back as he did what he was told. Draco chuckled as he realized his biggest fantasy was coming true. He had dreamt about dominating Harry since they were in school together. "So, I take it married life isn't all you thought it would be?" He took a sip of his fire-whiskey.
"Come in. Give me just a second to get dressed." I said gesturing to the living room on my way back to my bedroom.
Harry paced outside the club for thirty minutes trying to think of a plan. He decided his best bet would be to meet Miguel personally and hope he would lead him to Draco. He finally stepped inside the Underground. It was loud and there were male strippers everywhere giving lap dances working the pole and some dancing in cages. He looked at each one’s face hoping to see Draco but none of them were him.
"Auror Potter?" A nurse said. "We can't find anything wrong with him. As far as we can tell he's just sleeping, but to be on the safe side maybe he should stay with you for a few nights to be sure. Once he awakens of course."
"And I would happily get the snake."
"Thank you, Draco." Harry smiled and Draco gave him a sad smile in return.
Draco- "Yes just give me your address and I'll be there as fast as possible."
He felt Draco pull his body close and his lips against his ear. " I'm not done with you yet. Do you need something to help you recover?"
"Sorry, it’s a hard habit to break." Harry gave a shy smile.
"I'm not your baby." he spat.
When he read that post he wondered if this meant Draco was gay. He was embarrassed to say he got a little excited. Harry had fallen in love with Griffin and Draco. He loved how handsome and stoic griffin looked and he adored how much Draco loved him. He hadn't noticed but he had been reading through Draco's posts for an hour.
"Where am I? “Draco cried quietly.
Harry smiled "Yes, I find you incredible sexy and seeing how much you love Griffin is beautiful."
"Seriously, da? Where are we going? I really want to know too." They both gave me their best puppy dog eyes knowing I couldn't resist. God's, I love my little family.
"It's okay, truly. It was an arranged marriage anyways. So, what about you? I know you were an Auror, but what happened to Weasley?" Draco's stomach was turning at the thought of her touching Harry.
"Harry, you are perfect to me. You are and have always been the most beautiful creature I've ever laid eyes on, and I do care about you. Harry I've loved you for years. I've loved you since I first laid eyes on you. I hadn't known it at the time, but the more I watched you, the more I saw your colors show the deeper I fell. You have always and will always mean the world to me."
"What do you need to ask him?" Narcissa asked.
Harry finds a way to contact Draco and asks him out, but his answer surprises him.
"You're mine, Harry?" Draco asked.
"So, what do you want to do today?" Harry asked.
"Kind of." Draco was refusing to look at Harry. Harry suddenly felt a tug on his pant leg.
I'm so sorry you had to find me. I'm so sorry I couldn't do it. I've tried for 4 years now. I tried to be strong for you and Ron... and Teddy. It's just too heavy. Please make sure He's taken care of... since I couldn't. Hermione, I'm so sorry the guilt is eating me away. I don't want to see their faces every time I close my eyes. This is what I deserve.
"Happy tenth birthday my boy. You're the only man I need in my life! #catsarebetterthanpeople"
"Why don't you two go play out in the garden?" Draco asked.
"Oh, fuck Harry! How are you doing this!?" Draco yelled in pleasure. Harry didn't answer just inserted another finger. He spat on Draco's hole lubing it up more so he could add another finger. "I don't know if I can take much more!" Draco moaned.
Dinner went really well they both talked about work, what happened after school, and made amends for what they did to each other during school. They made joke and laughed and there was definitely a surplus of flirting. Soon they had finished, put cleaned up the kitchen and were sitting in the living room.
"Did I say something wrong?" Harry said, not wanting Draco to leave.
"Can I get you anything?" I asked. Granger just shook he head.
Draco crumpled to the bed, barely able to hold his wand, he whispered a cleaning spell. Then grabbed Harry and pulled him close.
"Hey, how's your night going?" Harry said hitting on a guy at the bar as he got another drink.
"Such grace." Draco said sarcastically.
Draco kept glancing out of the corner of his eye to look at Harry as he ate. Every time he did, he couldn't help but notice that the green eyes never left him. His stare was starting to make the butterflies in his stomach flutter harder, completely obliterating his appetite, so he turned to look at him. "Are you alright Professor?" He asked not able to keep the smile off his face.
"Okay! Sounds like fun!" Teddy hurried to his room and quickly put his stuff away. "Ok I'm ready!" He shouted as he ran down the stairs.
"Did I ever tell you I love hearing you say my first name? Makes me feel like I’m in a dream, and if I am, I never want to wake up." Harry said as he started serving the chicken Parmesan. Draco giggled in response. "Now let’s eat before it gets cold."
"Gods yes! Please take me home and fuck me!" Draco replied which made Harry even more horny.
The waitress came and took their order. Harry got pancakes bacon and eggs and Draco stuck with just coffee.
"Harry!? You can't let him hurt Daddy anymore!" Scorpius turned from his dad's shoulder to Harry's. "Please!?"
He took the job because no one else in the wizarding world would hire him. luckily there were a lot of high class people who got off on fucking ex death eaters. He no lived in studio apartment he paid for with hooking. He moved out of the mansion after his mother and father left the country right after the war 7 years ago.
"Throat fuck me!" Harry gasped as he popped Draco's cock out of his mouth for a second. Draco was surprised but happily did as he was told. Pushing Harry down onto his cock till it hit the back of his throat. Harry didn't gag so he started going faster till he was lifting of the bed in wild pleasure.
After Dinner, Harry played trains with Scorpius. Draco couldn't help but smile at the two. He had never seen another person so invested in his son. It made him happy to watch them laugh and play.
"Then I reached my target audience." Draco winked.
"What are you doing here?" Harry exclaimed.
"You don't have to do that, Harry." Draco said. Harry gave him a big smile as he swiped his card
"Oh yeah?" Draco smirked as he slowly started dancing backward till, he was flush against Harry. Ass pressed against crotch. Harry let out a moan as Draco ground against him.
"You're also one of his biggest regrets." Hermione said looking at me through her eyelashes. I was taken aback by her words. Why was I one of his regrets? "He almost killed you, when he knew you were just a pawn."
"Nope." Draco's smirk grew, "You need to eat and I'm going to make you wait."
"Talk?" I gulped.
"Draco! Oh merlin! What have I done?!" I heard him hell he rushed to help me up but stopped when he saw the blood. I could finally see straight and looked up to see his vacant expression. In seconds he was running into the bathroom adjacent to his room. I stumbled after him, not liking the look I saw in his eyes. A loud crash shook the lasts bit of dizziness from my brain and I ran to him.
He looked out over the table watching as kids started to flood into the great hall. Looking down the table he could see Granger taking her seat as professor of Transfiguration and head of Gryffindor, a position she accepted 5 years ago after she grew tired of the ministry. Next to her was Longbottom, Professor of Herbology, and Weasley sat on her other side as the new Quidditch referee.
Once they were seated and had orders a water for Harry and coffee for Draco, Harry let out a deep sigh.
"Please, no Draco." He begged. My heart broke a little at the quiver I his voice.
"Not off to a good start, Harry. What do you call me?" Draco asked huskily.
"Yes, I'm ok." He lied as best as he could through his panting.
"I love you too." I smiled a truly happy smile and handed him over to Andromeda, and they left.
"Yes master." Harry looked confused and this pleased Draco.
"Good boy." Draco said as he kissed Harry's neck.
"Thank you, Draco. I'll see you then. Bye." Harry smiled.
"What you cooking, sexy?" Harry asked.
"Him I guess he knows I'm a huge fan." Harry laughed.
"Good boy. What was your question?" Draco rewarded.
"I'll do what I have to to protect my family!" Harry challenged.
"Also, mum said you and Draco must come over Sunday night for dinner, and we both know she blow her top if you two don't show." They laughed again.
Harry pulled Draco in for one last soft and loving kiss as he pulled out and then collapsed to the bed. He pulled their sweaty bodies together and tried to catch his breath.
I wanted to say something, anything, but I just couldn't find the words. "What do you need me to do?"
"Mm thank... oh fuck!" Draco said as Harry gripped his cock and licked it from base to tip. He then took his balls into his mouth and sucked them both gently. "Oh my god! You're so good with your mouth, baby!" Draco nearly yelled.
"You better stay! I haven't gotten enough of you yet, and you leave tomorrow." Draco replied as he turned and wrapped his arms around Harry.
"Well I had tickets to an opera, but I would much rather stay here and talk to you?" Harry replied as he scooted just a hair closer.
Draco curled up in the corner of his cell trying to stay warm. He had been stripped naked and Miguel had let multiple lackies have their way with him. I had been rough and brutal so his entire body was week and sore.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he delicately slid his pants off allowing them to catch on the tip of his cock making it spring upward again. Draco lost control a little and licked his lips without realizing it. Harry fought a smile.
"Oh, honey, you don't have to repay me. I did this because I wanted to not because I wanted something from you. I'm happy just to be here with you." Harry smiled.
"I was doing some paperwork for my job at St. Mungo's." Draco replied.
"Excuse me, what did you just call me?" Draco smirked, excited for what was to come.
"Excuse me can you tell me what happened to him." Draco asked her.
"Of course!" Draco replied smiling. Harry gave him another big smile in return.
"They locked you in a cupboard and beat you?!" Draco exclaimed, "I thought you were living the good life. I'm so sorry Harry."
"You just didn't look like the type." Harry mentally face palmed at what he said.
"Hey Harry! It's Draco! I got your number from the receptionist. I hope you don't mind. I just couldn't stay away." He heard Draco's excited voice.
"Hmm?" Draco asked as he scooted closer so he could pet Griffin.
"H-harry you're going to make me come." Draco moaned.
Draco tries to quit working for the Underground.
Draco face changed immediately. Going from smiling to sad.
"You have?" Draco could sense the fear in Harry's voice.
"Hello, this is Harry." He answered.
"I don't doubt it." He said as he kissed him, "So let hurry and eat. Dinner is ready."
"Want to tell me over a glass of wine?" Draco asked.
Ginny still wasn't back by the time Saturday came around. Harry didn't mind though. It made it easier to talk to Draco and to go see him when his appointed time came.
"Could you sleep with me tonight?"
"Why are you here Malfoy?!" He yelled.
Then he felt the vibrator in his ass turn on full force.
"I decided I'd let you choose and I would happily get the lion if that's what you wanted." I laughed and kissed his nose.
"Harry?"
"wooooooooow! Daddy said you out flew him on your broom."
"What!? Why not!?" Pansy yelled in Draco's ear.
"Please what?" I asked after taking him out of my mouth with a load pop.
A few weeks past of them just passing each other in the corridors, and every time Harry would give him a smile and a nod sending electricity through his body. He just couldn't understand it. He had never felt like this before.
"This is my treat." Harry said as he took out his bank card, and Scorpius went and sat down with his ice cream.
Harry unlocked the door and sent Ron a text saying where he went then they apparated back to Harry's place.
"Mmhmm he put up a good chase but I was faster!" Harry said as he retold the story from his point of view.
Before he brought the paddle down this time he reached in his pocket and turned the vibrator on full blast. Five thwacks later Harry was shaking again with a throbbing cock.
It caught Harry off guard and he almost fell over from shock. "Ginny! You scared the hell out of me!" He shouted as he caught himself on the door frame.
"Fuck." Harry said as Draco's words went straight to his cock, making it throb and ache with need. He reached around, pulling Draco closer and started teasing Draco's hole by slowly inserting his finger. Draco moaned and placed his forehead against Harry's. He then reached between them and gripped both his and Harry's cocks, stroking them in time with Harry's finger.
"Me either. See you. Bye Griffin!" He said petting him on the head.
"Yeah, bye. It was nice seeing you Draco." Harry said sadly as Draco and Scorpius walked away.
"Of course, I do! I love Smithy's! I'll see you there!" Harry was so happy now. This completely changed his day around. he finished his shopping, loaded up his car and Headed to the ice cream shop. He pulled in just as Draco was getting Scorpius out of the car.
"Now, Draco, you have a choice, continue doing as you told and I'll keep doing what I do, or quit and I'll force you to do whatever I want. "
They collapsed to the bed and passed out without even a simple clean up charm.
"of course." Harry smiled at the pet name.
"Me either. Saturday will be here soon."
"I'm a healer actually." Draco smiled big. He was quite proud of himself. "After the war I decided I wanted to help people, and I figured this would be the best way to do so."
"I don't want to see you naked until that time comes." Draco said.
"Mm that’s good!" Said Harry taking a sip.
"Oh my god Draco! That was more than anything I could ever dream of." Harry panted.
Draco smiled and nodded, "Well I became a healer at St. Mungo's."
"Oh, don't be embarrassed honey. He's really good at what he does. You just go through that curtain and up the stairs it's the third door to the right."
"Hey Harry, is something wrong?" Draco answered.
"We decided it would be best to have an auror look after you just to be sure you're alright, Mr. Malfoy." The nurse said.
"I love you too." Harry smiled against Draco's head.
"Professor." His voice of all things surprised Harry the most. It was smooth and deep, and held none of the malice it used to.
“So if I have this right you both got together in 5th year, Voldemort had a connection with Harry that put you both at risk and as breaking up didn’t help m-Draco made sure Snape had you obliviated so you would forget but before Draco wrote You a letter that you then opened before coming back to Hogwarts slightly reminding and after the battle you went to get memories from the Pensieve that Dumbledore had left to remind you”  Hagrid explained taking a cup of pumpkin juice.
“Is there anything else?” Draco asked “I was also concerned about the scars you have mainly on your torso, do they cause any disruption?” Harry remembering looked down at Draco and rubbing his neck trying to comfort him. “They are mostly fine I had a great man heal me, he wasn’t trained in healing so there are a few that sometimes lightly bleed and itch but I know how to take care of it” “I can give you a potion that you can use to heal it up properly next time it does this” the healer starred rummaging through his bag to find a small ish glass “ put this on some tissue or fabric and place it over the place that isn’t healed for 10 minutes then voila it should be cleaned up but you will still have the scary I’m afraid” “thank you” Draco said taking the glass and placing it on the table next to him.
“Keep yourself safe yeah, i wont forget you though i want us to be happy after this war, get a house and stay there, our own little world” Harry said leaning their forehead together.
Draco made his way down stairs to the kitchen to get new bandages when suddenly kreacher appeared zapping into thin air, “Does masters friend need anything?” “Uh... could you get me some parchment and a quill and 2 glasses of water and take them to the room please” Draco muttered still propping himself up looking for some bandages “he said they were in here”he muttered to himself looking in the last cabinet out of the entire kitchen “are you serious?” 2 rolls of bandages and the gauze laid In front of him.
Draco started to sort out the dead death eaters he didn’t think it was right that people here had to deal with them, rolling his sleeves up, he looked at the mark it has slightly faded he felt sick looking at it but got to work.
When Draco turned round he was presented with two faces of sadness and pity. Draco turned to snape and looked him in the eyes “If he refuses to or can’t forget obliviate him” Draco said firmly but his eyes roaming around a nervous sign.
Age 5
Harry finishing up went to look for Draco it took him a few minutes weaving through the corridor finding a door open. Harry peeped finding Draco on a double bed with a box out, going through it. “What are you up to then” Harry asked as he knocked on the door. “There wasn’t a lot to fix, a few leaks so I packed up people stuff so it can get sent to them, just had to get mine” Draco explained holding a picture in his hand.
Draco suddenly realised where they were it was Dumbledores office “Both of you wait out here” Snape said entering the room slamming the door behind him.
He focused on breathing and writing a message to his mother with the quill and parchment he accio, more people had started to fill the hall finding loved ones, more bodies had been brought in given room to lie in peace, at the back he saw Colin creevys body he didn’t believe in god but he prayed for the boy hoping he would go to heaven if it existed.
The 2 had decided to start with Gryffindor’s common room first, having to reconstruct a few of the dorm rooms that had been blown off. Doing that fairly quick they had a slow walk to the Slytherin common room, stopping on the way at the room of requirements, Draco using his wand to magic up some flowers. They silently left, back on their way to the dungeons. They were both walking hand in hand when “I forgot to say I need to send you mother an owl and thank her” Harry suddenly stating. Draco stopped and stared confused at Harry. “I didn’t tell you but she told Voldemort I was dead when I was alive after he sent the killing curse at me” Harry smiled at Draco, Draco smiled back “I don’t know what to say” “you don’t have to, come one let’s get the dungeon cleaned”
5th year:
“I knew it was you with the necklace and meed, I’m assuming it wasn’t solely your idea” Dumbledore said Draco looked at the ground ashamed he didn’t want any of this. “Im assuming you have the mark Draco” he lifted his sleeve up not looking at Dumbledore face.
Sometime later he had Harry running after him following him to the toilets, they started throwing spells at each other ending up with Draco bleeding on the floor saying “Im sorry” multiple times till Snape came in fixing him.
Draco walked in feeling a bit awkward not seeing Dumbledore so he just sat down at the table.
“I’m not going to hurt you Mr Malfoy” the healer said pointing his wand at him. “You say that’s as you point your wand my way?” Draco retaliated. The healer waved his wand across Draco his eyes looked shocked.
“I think we should leave the two alone Severus” Dumbledore said leaving the room with Snape following behind.
At dinner that night he swore he saw Dumbledore give him a pitted look after he looked at Harry from across the hall.
“Oh me and Draco, he’s staying with me at the minute while his mother sorts Malfoy manor out” Harry explained leaving a bit of information out. “I didn’t know you two were that close” Hagrid was still looking a bit confused. “I didn’t say, sorry, me and Draco are together like dating and all that other stuff” Harry explained bringing Draco closer to him, Harry also noticing that McGonagall had gone to talk to the students helping out.
As soon as the healer had left Draco got up quickly startling Harry slightly going back to the stove to finish making Harry’s pancakes. A small amount of tension had settled on the room. Harry was careful walking up to Draco wrapping his arms around Draco from behind.
“You did a good thing you know” “I know I just have to process that it happened” “that’s ok but can we cuddle while you do that I missed you” Harry finished wrapping his arms round Draco pulling him down into the pillow and blankets.
They settled into a hug “I’m sorry for what i did to you last year” Harry whispered “its fine I’m still here thanks to Snape” Draco said sadly.
When Draco had gotten his Hogwarts letter Lucius knew his son and the famous Harry Potter were going to be starting the year together, it was up to Draco who he made friends with Narcissa had said to him as they were talking about how Hogwarts could go for Draco, he already knew crab and goyle as their fathers were death eaters with Lucius all those years ago but Narcissa hoped Draco would make better friends.
3rd year:
“Draco” his dad “Draco” softer his mum. It was over, hes dead how were we going to win now. He just wanted his mum and to leave his father, he did this to the family why couldn’t he let us be a normal family? So he walked forward to his mothers arms getting a hug from Voldemort WHAT THE FUCK.
“What time are we apparating?” Draco asked as he walked into the room from the bathroom going to the wardrobe. “Whenever you are ready” Harry said not looking up from the prophet, it was just more stories from the battle. “I’m ready now” Draco said turning to Harry wearing all black formal as usual. “We need to get you new clothes you look like you have been attending a funeral for the past 4 to 5 years”Harry said walking over the Draco. “Seems like a good idea” Draco said shuffling his feet about. “You sure you’re ok with going today?” Harry asked making sure. “Yeah fine” Draco answered “let’s get going”
“Your turn now” Harry said looking towards Draco, Draco looked back “do I have to?” He whined, “you promised” Harry said pushing Draco in the direction of the sofa.
“Have a look” Harry said Draco dipped his face in and was met with what he said to Dumbledore and Snape after they broke up then Snape obliviateing him and Dumbledore confronting Draco but during what Voldemort did to him it was censored he was happy for that.
Draco started to silently cry, finding it hard to stop himself as his good hand had been trapped in bandages making it painful to move, this causing even more tears to stream down his face like a broken pipe.
Draco knew he was wasting away he knew it but was there a point of living.
“Isnt it something to do with extracting feelings and memories from another person's mind?” Draco asked. “You are correct Draco and from what we know somehow Harry here and Voldemort have a connection where each of them can see things the other sees. As you may know this isn’t good as Voldemort can know what to use against Harry, you Draco from what snape tells me is one of the big emotional things for Harry and I have to think about protecting both of you as you are both under my care so you have to spend less time together to where honestly you don’t have a huge emotional impact on Harry that Voldemort could tap into”.
While in potions slughorn came up to him as class ended “Dumbledore wants to have a talk with you boy after this lesson, now off you go” Draco nodded packed his bag and walked out, feeling eyes on him as he did so.
Draco had got the dark mark he was one now he had a mission to complete tasked by the dark lord himself.
The end
It felt like ages till Harry was finished with all the memories. Draco ran up to him as he gasped for a breath he moved him to the table.
“What are you doing?” Draco heard a small voice it was Harry as he felt a hand on his back. “Reading” “you don’t normally read that rubbish” “I wanted to read about what happened with you as I wasn’t there to see it but...”
