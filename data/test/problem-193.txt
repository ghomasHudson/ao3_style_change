Draco rose up on his knees so he could position himself.  He held onto Harry’s cock as he started to lower himself.  Harry resisted the urge to grab onto his hips and thrust fiercely, not willing to risk hurting Draco.  Instead he endured the delicious torture of Draco slowly lowering himself - wrapping Harry’s prick, inch by inch, in tight, slick, heat.
Harry thought about just going to sleep himself, but his stomach chose that moment to grumble loudly.  He went to the kitchen and quickly assembled his supper of tea and beans on toast.  He sat in the kitchen to eat and regarded the room around him.  It was as messy, if not more, than the rest of the house.  He knew he should probably try and straighten up before Hilly arrived tomorrow, but he was just too exhausted.
It had been about a week since their date and Draco was still not initiating any kisses.  They had, however, progressed to spending more time together, and Draco didn’t automatically leave the room anymore when Harry entered it.  This evening Draco had come and joined Harry on the couch, where he had been playing peek-a-boo with Al.
Draco captured his lips again and fucked his tongue in and out of Harry’s mouth.  He turned them both and then slowly moved forward so Harry was backed up against the wall of the shower.  Draco pushed a leg in between Harry’s, forcing Harry to spread his legs to make room.  Then he pressed his thigh against Harry’s cock and rocked.  “Yes, yes!  Don’t stop,” Harry whimpered.
“I’ll take the kiss,” Draco said so quietly, Harry wasn’t sure he heard him correctly.  But then he leaned in toward Harry and Harry leaned in too, meeting him halfway.  Their lips whispered together, brushing lightly – then parting, before brushing together again.
Draco was already shaking his head no when he realized that there was such an item. “My father’s walking stick,” he blurted out. “The Dark Lord took it from him when he took his wand. He used it to… well, he used it.” Draco preferred not to detail just how often Voldemort enjoyed humiliating his father. He clapped his hands. “Dilly!”
“Yes,” Draco said slowly, somewhat dazed by Potter’s thoughtfulness and willingness to cooperate. “We can work in the library, that way we can research if we need to.”
“Oh!” Harry parted his lips and Draco’s tongue slipped inside, twisting and tangling with his own.  His hands slid over the warm, wet skin of Draco’s back and stopped on the firm slopes of his arse.  He pulled Draco closer and rocked his hips causing his dick to rub against Draco.  Pleasure spiked through Harry.  He pulled his mouth away from Draco’s and tried in vain to catch his breath.  “Feels so good,” he panted against Draco’s mouth.
“Oh, sure.  Well, we have been able to trace the magical signature on the cursed object to Advard Bulstrode,” Bill informed them.
Hermione and Ron went to wait over with Draco and Hermione immediately hugged him, not letting go even when he made no move to hug her back.  Draco stood stoically, his eyes never leaving the man lying on the hospital bed.  “This is good, Draco.  He’s awake.  This is good,” she murmured and she tightened her arms around him.
“No, no, Draco.  I was wrong to ask you,” Draco pulled back as he heard Harry’s words.  “It was wrong of me to try and push you into something you weren’t ready for.  I’m sorry for the things I said.  I was wrong.  You don’t need to change.”
“Not that kind of weak, idiot.” Malfoy turned and smiled at Harry, taking all of the sting from the insult.  “I had a dream, and I let myself believe it could be true.”  He made a face and grabbed the bottle back from Harry.  “I should have remembered, Malfoys never get what they want.  It’s just the way things are.”
Harry reached out his free hand and clutched at the fabric of Draco’s shirt trying to drag him closer.  The feel of the fabric made it through Harry’s lust clouded brain, there was something wrong about this, if only he could remember what it was?  Harry pulled back abruptly, “Wait!  Why are you wearing all your clothes?  If we fucked, why are you dressed?  I would have felt the pull if you had gone to your wardrobe to get dressed!”
“There may be feelings of aggression if someone else touches your bondmate,” Thropwaite inserted into the conversation, his eyes flicking between Bill, Harry and Malfoy.  “And some of these curses had a consummation component.  We don’t know yet if this one does.”
Draco turned back around to face Harry but his attention was still fully on the baby in his arms.  He began to bounce more in earnest.  Draco cooed at the baby, “Ok, little star, if you tell your daddy I did this I’ll . . . well, I’ll never buy you a pony.”  He smiled down at the baby.  She had stopped crying and was gurgling up at him.  “Oh, you don’t think I mean it, do you?  I’ll have you know I am going to be a very strict father!  And while we’re on the subject, no boyfriends!  Ever!” Draco laughed softly, his eyes shining down at his daughter.
Despair shining from his eyes, Draco snapped, “What would you have me do then?! She is dying, Dilly!”
Harry felt the rising need of want and pleasure spiral up.  And then he was coming, wet and warm all over Draco’s hand and his own chest.  Harry used his clean hand to pull Draco close and kiss him softly.  “That was amazing,” he said quietly.
“Harry Potter must be taking Master Draco to the underworld, and they must be finding the one who placed this dark curse!” Dilly said emphatically.
He had five minutes to spare, so he used his wand to create an enchanted archway out of the heirloom rose bushes.  Some of the petals scattered as he did this, carpeting the lawn underneath the arch.
One minute to spare.  Harry looked toward the house and used one finger to loosen his tie, the tiniest bit.  He shoved his hands into his pockets.  No doubt “ruining the lines of the suit” but too nervous to care.  All of the moisture in his mouth had dried up.  What if Draco hated this?  What if this was a terrible mistake?
’ and then the tingling sensation swept over him as the sticky mess was removed from his skin and his pajama bottoms.
“He… he stayed.” Draco could barely choke out the words. “Voldemort required one of us to stay. And Harry…” Draco broke down sobbing again. “I have to go to him!”
“No, no she’s fine,” Draco said quickly, and Harry sank back down to his pillow.  “Merlin!  I’m sorry.  I don’t know what I was thinking . . . sorry I woke you.”
With the aching in his chest nearly sending him to his knees, Harry turned and quietly let himself out of the suite.
And then there was the kiss.  It had started innocently enough, a game of Truth or Dare enhanced with revealing charms that turned your hands red if you lied.  It had been the usual silly questions and dares until Michael Corner asked Blaise if he liked girls or boys.
“Let me try now,” Harry said in rushed whisper, trying to get this fixed before the professor reached them, but when he cast the spell nothing happened.
Maybe if he was really quiet?  He took another look at Malfoy’s sleeping face.  He slowly rolled over and put his back toward the other man.  Harry held his breath while he waited to see if Malfoy woke up.  There was no movement or sound from behind him, so Harry slowly let out his breath.
They made their way to the office entrance being careful not to stray too far apart.  The staircase revealed itself on their approach, and they soon found themselves seated in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
Once Harry arrived at the hospital, it wasn’t long before Atria Lily arrived.  Harry was pulled into Hermione’s room and stationed on her left, with Ron on her right.  Ron seemed to know just what to do, encouraging her, wiping her brow, and breathing with her in turn.  While Harry just stood there, overwhelmed by the whole thing, and letting Hermione use his hand as a squeeze toy during contractions.  Before he knew it, the nurse was asking him if he wanted to cut the umbilical cord.  Then his daughter was wrapped in a soft blanket and placed in his arms.
He decided it wasn’t worth the risk and rolled over to Malfoy’s side of the bed to get out.  He paused for a minute with his head on Malfoy’s pillow when the distinctive sharp citrus scent overwhelmed him.  What the hell was happening to him?  Was this part of the curse?  All he wanted to do was lay here surrounded by Malfoy’s scent.  He even felt his cock responding, starting to harden all over again.
“There’s only one person who can break the curse, Potter,” Draco said, defeat creeping into his voice.
Far from moving away, Draco leaned his head forward and started grazing his teeth along the side of Harry’s neck.  At the same time he rocked his hips gently so that his hard dick slid back and forth between Harry’s arse cheeks.  A shudder ran through Harry’s body at the sensations Draco was creating.  “Draco!” Harry gasped.  His own cock was hard and aching now too.
Harry was so caught up in his dreams that when Draco finally stirred, he was still a bit disoriented.  Even so, when Draco made a motion to push away from him, Harry tightened his arms and mumbled into his hair, “I like you right here.”  Draco relaxed back into Harry’s embrace and Harry heard him sigh.
“Whah?”  Harry’s head was spinning so he leaned over onto Malfoy.  “You’re nah weak! You . . . you’re . . . so strong.”  Harry reached over and squeezed Malfoy’s bicep, “See?  Strong!”
Unable to stop himself, Harry moved next to the bed.  He lifted a hand to brush at his cheek, but Draco flinched away from him.  “Draco, we’re married,” he said softly.  “I’m your husband.”  Harry felt his heart breaking while he waited for Draco’s response.
When Harry just continued to stand motionless in front of the entrance, Draco took the step forward and knocked on the door.  “Come in,” Dumbledore’s voice rang out.  Bill Weasley and Professor Thropwaite were both seated in front of Dumbledore’s desk.  At their entrance, Dumbledore summoned additional chairs for Harry and Draco.  “Please come and sit,” he directed.
Running out of patience himself, Harry shoved his pants off.  His hard prick sprang up away from his body when it was freed from the confining clothing.  He moved toward the bed and crawled next to Draco.  He straddled him again but took pains to sit well below the hard outline of Draco’s cock.  “You’ve been so good, baby!” he murmured, “you deserve a reward.”  He let his heated gaze take in the aroused man underneath him.  Draco whimpered involuntarily.  “Would you like a reward?  Hmm?” Harry asked huskily.
He was sleeping deeply when he felt his wand vibrate next to him.  He rolled over and started to go back to sleep when it started chiming.  He lay there debating with himself about whether to get up and help Draco or let him sink or swim on his own.  He finally hauled himself out of bed, deciding to be a grown-up.  This was his daughter after all.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, she’s dying.” The private Malfoy Healer put a hand on Draco’s shoulder to comfort him but the weight of the news had Draco sinking to his knees anyway.
“Keep your wand out,” Potter directed, dropping Draco’s hand and holding his own wand in one hand and the talisman in the other. He headed resolutely down a passageway and Draco followed closely.
Draco trembled, more out of shock than any fear Potter would actually hurt him. What had gone wrong? His brain scrambled to come up with an answer. “I… I wasn’t trying to bring you here. Something must have gone wrong.” Draco looked back down at the page in Potter’s hand.
Draco looked up when he heard Harry’s steps.  On his face was a pained expression and it looked like he had been crying.  “Draco. .?” Harry didn’t know what to say.
Now Harry was stuck in this fucking trap and he would never be able to make it right with Draco.  Harry cast another “Lumos” to check and see if anything had changed, but it hadn’t.  He shouldn’t have given up.  He should have fought for their love.  All of the amazing moments of their lives kept replaying in his head.  Harry was too drained to cry anymore, otherwise, he would be bawling.  Instead, he slumped against a wall and waited for either salvation or damnation.
“No! I don’t . . . I can’t,” Draco roughly pushed Harry back and tore himself from his arms.  Draco moved to the other side of the room and stood with his chest heaving and his back to Harry.  “I think you should leave,” he said gruffly.
“It’s been hard to keep up with everything,” Harry pushed his right hand through his hair causing random strands to stick straight up.  “That’s why you’re here.”
Dilly popped into the Malfoy library carrying a tray laden with tea, sandwiches, and fairy cakes. “Is Master Draco being hungry yet?” she asked optimistically, setting the tray down next to him.
Harry reached out to stroke his cheek, but he flinched away.  “But I’m not really him am I?  I’m not the one you fell in love with.  I don’t remember any of that!  I’m the fucked up kid who listened to a homicidal maniac!”  Draco looked wildly around the room and started to get out of bed, “I should g-.”
“Where’s Father? Am I under arrest?  Why am I not at Hogwarts?” Draco asked all in a rush.  “Is Father at the Manor, with,” he looked pointedly at Harry, “with our guest?”
“In cases of memory loss, its best to let the patient regain their memories on their own,” the Healer warned.
Pains had been taken to decorate in a mix of house colors so that all the students would feel welcome.  The common room had a large fireplace dominating one wall;  another wall was filled with floor to ceiling windows.  Comfortable couches and overstuffed chairs were grouped around the spacious room, ready for the students to study or socialize.  The boys’ dorms were off a hallway to the left, and the girls off to the right.
Harry pulled off his own shirt and then covered Draco’s body with his own.  “I’ll show you some perks,” he rumbled into his mouth before kissing him thoroughly.  Draco’s only response was to tighten his arms around him and press his hips up, as he kissed back desperately.  Harry leaned back a bit and trailed his fingers between Draco’s legs.  He skimmed along the length of his cock then gently cupped his balls.   He dipped his fingers lower as he murmured a cleaning and lubricating spell.  He moved his hand lower and then just rested his fingertips against Draco’s furled hole.  He tapped his fingers lightly, causing Draco to moan and buck his hips against Harry’s fingers.
Draco looked down at Harry solemnly, the moment stretching out unbearably.  The lump in Harry’s throat grew the longer Draco remained silent.  Fearful of what he would see in his eyes, Harry lowered his head and stared instead at Draco’s fancy shoes crushing the rose petals.  This had been a stupidly impulsive idea.  He must have misunderstood Draco earlier when they were in bed.  ‘Why the fuck had he done this when things had been going so well,’ Harry berated himself.
“Not just an Auror,” Narcissa broke in, “He’s the Head of the Auror department!  The youngest ever!”
Harry leaned down and sucked on his neck while he gave in to the urge to slam his cock into Draco.  “God, Baby, I’m close!” Harry knew this was going to be over much faster than he had wished, but he also knew there was no way he could stop himself from coming inside his husband.  He reached down between them and grasped Draco’s cock with a slippery hand, squeezing and stroking him as Draco rocked his ass up to meet Harry’s thrusts.
He looked into Draco’s eyes trying to read his expression.  His eyes were a stormy grey, and they glittered with determination.  His fingers tightened, pressing into Harry’s wet skin.  Draco wasn’t moving and Harry didn’t know what to do.  “Are you mad at me?” Harry asked, still trying to figure out Draco’s mood.
Draco didn’t get to finish because Harry grabbed a fistful of his t-shirt and hauled him backwards.  He pushed him down onto his back and then laid on top of him.  “No!  You’re not going until we talk this out.”  Draco gave a halfhearted shove at Harry’s shoulders before closing his eyes and collapsing back onto the pillows.  “I’m not leaving you,” Harry gave him a swift kiss before continuing, “Look Draco, I know you’re an arrogant asshole and I love you anyway!”  Draco’s eyes flew open but before he could interject, Harry continued, “I’m an asshole sometimes too.  And you still love me.  I don’t expect you to be perfect, Draco.  I’m under no illusions about who I married.”  Harry framed Draco’s face with his hands, bracing his elbows on the bed.  “We fit, Draco,” he said in a low urgent tone.  “Neither one of us is perfect, but we are perfect for each other.  We fit!”  Harry started sprinkling little kisses all over his face.  “So. Let. Me. Love. You . . . And let yourself love me too!”
He and Draco had fallen into an unhappy pattern after the night he had snuck into Harry’s room.  During the day, Draco was friendly but he shied away from any physical contact.  Harry had returned to work and Draco had stayed home with Atria Lily.  He was a loving caregiver to their daughter and lavished hugs and kisses on her but none for her daddy.  Then, each night after Harry had settled into bed, Draco would come and get into his bed.  They would make love passionately, and many times Harry would blurt out his love for Draco.  But every morning when he woke up, Draco would be gone and his side of the bed was cold.
“Come for me, Harry,” Draco commanded and that tipped Harry over the edge so that he was coming hard and shooting all over Draco’s hand.  Harry watched while Draco released Harry’s cock and stroked his hand, still covered in Harry’s cum, over his own dick.  Draco leaned in and gave Harry a very messy kiss, more teeth and panting breath than anything else.  “Harry!” Draco moaned and shuddered as he came, shooting all over Harry’s stomach.
He wasn’t sure what had awakened him, but he woke to a darkened room with a figure looming next to his bed.  He pulled his wand from beneath his pillow and cast “Lumos.” “Draco?” he croaked, when he saw the man standing there, “Al?  Is she . . .”  He started to push himself up to get out of bed.
Thropwaite responded again, “We have determined that the trainer was intentionally tampered with.  We don’t yet know why or by whom.”
“You do realize I was pretty much raised by House Elves, don’t you Potter?” Draco Drawled.  “I would stake my life on the fact that neither Lucious nor Narcissa ever changed a nappy, wouldn’t you?”  That mental image succeeded in cracking them both up.
“Harry, no!” Draco protested, grabbing Harry’s arm and pulling him around to face him. Panic and dread, filled Draco. “You can’t do this! It’s too much! There has to be another way!” He couldn’t save his mother only to lose Harry.
“Look!  I don’t know all the details.  I just know that they told me they get paid.  There must be some sort of house elf employment bureau.  Surely an important Auror, like yourself, would be able to find out the details.  Otherwise, we are leaving here and returning to the hotel!  Where there are actual house elves!” Draco crossed his arms over his chest to punctuate his declaration.
Draco’s eyes looked dazed and his pupils were already blown.  He licked his lips, his tongue also touching Harry’s lips.  “My reward,” he whispered, “want my reward.”
He moved through his days as if in a trance.  His attention split between watching Draco and cataloging all of his memories with the other man.  His grades were dropping and he was losing weight, but he couldn’t care less.  Draco never even so much as glanced at Harry, much less had any kind of interaction with him.  It was clear that he just wanted to put the whole bonding behind him.  Harry wished that he could too, but even though they were no longer bonded, every particle in his body screamed out for Draco Malfoy.
All in all, that seemed like a small demand for Potter to insist on, so Draco agreed, “I will work with her but it must be done immediately. Time is of the essence.”
Finally, when the need to breathe could no longer be ignored, Harry lifted his lips and then quickly buried his head against Draco’s neck.  Mumbling against his neck, Harry said, “Is that a yes then?”
“We can talk later.” Draco pushed away from him more forcefully and this time moved out of his embrace.  When Draco moved off the bed and started to dress, the bond tugged at Harry until he too left the bed and moved over to the wardrobes.  They dressed without talking.  Draco put on a button up shirt, pressed trousers and his school robes. While Harry threw on jeans, a t-shirt and a pair of trainers.
Harry moved down Draco’s body until he was face to face with his cloth covered prick.  He rubbed his face along the hardened length.  He grabbed Draco’s hips and forced him to stay still when he tried to push into Harry’s touch.  Draco moaned loudly when Harry turned his head, opened his mouth and started sucking on his cock right through the fabric of his trousers.  He raised his head and smiled up at Draco, “You look so fucking good!” He released Draco’s hips and unfastened his trousers, dropping kisses along the elastic waistband of his pants and mouthing at the cotton covering his cock.
Malfoy looked over at Harry and glared, before turning toward the headmaster. “I cast the spell exactly as it was written on the board, but nothing happened.  Well, nothing but a blue light that is.”
They walked down the hall and Harry opened the door to the pristine bedroom.  He hadn’t used this room at all, so it had escaped the baby detritus.  The room was done in all in shades of grey and silver.  Draco stepped into the room and looked around.  “This is unexpected.  It’s quite nice,” he said in surprise.
“For trusting me,” Harry said, before giving Draco another gentle kiss.  He slowly pulled back releasing Draco’s lips and dropped to one knee.  Still holding his hand, he looked up at the man he loved more than anything.  “Draco Luscious Malfoy, will you marry me?” Harry’s heart beat anxiously as he waited for an answer.
“Thanks,” Harry said, still not turning around to look at Malfoy because he was too afraid of what he might see in his face.  He heard the other boy move over to his wardrobe and felt the familiar tug in his midsection that always preceded the pain when they moved too far apart.  Harry debated whether he could get away with getting out on his side of the bed, or if the pain would be too severe.
Harry heard Draco mutter, “Going to kill me.”  And then he felt Draco’s hands grasp his hips and drag him back against Draco’s body.  His back to Draco’s front.  Harry dropped the soap and reached to cover both of Draco’s hands with his own.  He pressed down, trapping Draco’s hands.  He didn’t want him changing his mind and moving away.
“Well you have me at a distinct disadvantage since you have sprung this surprise wedding on me and I do not have the memory of previous vows to fall back on, but I will endeavor to do my best,” Draco’s soft smile took the sting from his words.  “Harry James Potter, today I take you as my husband. You have been my rival, my friend, my anguish, my savior, my lover, and my greatest challenge. I may never remember our life before.  But most importantly, I know that you are the love of my life and you make me happier than I could ever imagine and more loved than I ever hoped. You have made me a better person, and our love is reflected in the way I live my life. I will dream with you, celebrate with you, and walk beside you through whatever our lives may bring.  I look forward to being parents with you to Atria Lily and any more children we may be lucky enough to have.  Our family is everything to me.  You are my love and my life, Harry, today and always.”  Draco reached up with trembling fingers and brushed the tears from Harry’s cheeks and then from his own.
“Fine,” Malfoy agreed with a curt nod.  Then he lifted his wand and cast the Revealing Spell, only instead of seeing the expected symbols all Harry could see was a blue light.  It seemed like a blue light was all around both Harry and Malfoy.
“That wasn’t me,” Draco hissed furiously, “Mother got her calmed and sleeping and then just thrust her at me, and then she went off to her appointment.  I have been sitting here since she left.  I’m afraid to move a muscle, lest she awakens and starts that racket again.”
“Mother had an appointment that she had to rush off to,” Draco answered sourly.  “Come and take this baby, Potter!  I haven’t the faintest idea of what I am doing.”
“Well, it’s fairly obvious I’d say, Potter.  We’ve clearly been cursed,” Malfoy drawled.  “It’s apparent that the American cocked it up.”
Everyone had turned to look back at Harry while he spoke, but now they turned back to Draco to await his response.  “Haaarrry,” Draco stretched out his name in a plea.
“Oh Sirs!” Hilly looked up at Harry and Draco with a smile on her face and tears in her eyes.  “Can Hilly be taking the Little Miss to her crib?” she looked up at them expectantly.
Once he was dressed Potter faced Draco once again. In a surprisingly calm voice, he asked, “What’s going on here, Malfoy?”
At first Harry thought Malfoy would just ignore what he had said, but after a long pause he heard a whispered, “You’re welcome.”  They worked silently side by side for nearly three hours.  Harry had expected to feel jumpy and nervous, but he hadn’t.  He had felt comfortable working alongside Malfoy, and he had gotten a lot done.
Harry could feel the wild beat of Draco’s heart where their chests were touching, and his hard cock was pressed into Harry’s stomach.  “No?”  Harry ventured.
“Would you want to show me?” Draco whispered.  When Harry remained silent, Draco looked up at him, biting his lower lip.
“No, no!  We need to do this now.  I need to know.  Is he or she the reason you didn’t want the bond?  Are they the reason you didn’t want me?” Harry struggled to keep the quaver out of his voice.
Ron had gotten the word to the rest of the family, and they soon arrived.  Bill brought Rose and Hugo to see their mum and meet their new cousin.  Andromeda arrived with both a sulky looking Teddy and a nervous looking Narcissa in tow.
They had taken one short break, huddling under the invisibility cloak to sneak down to the kitchens and stock up on food.  They brought the food back and kept it under Stasis Charms to stay fresh.
They sat in silence, each man caught up in his own thoughts until Draco spoke again, “Then how did we . . . I mean, how are we . . .” Draco
“No.  Well . . . I mean, I do . . . but only if you want to . . .” Harry trailed off uncertainly.  This was not going how he had imagined while he was trapped.  He had pictured himself apologizing to Draco and Draco throwing himself into his arms.  Then the two of them would kiss and cuddle.  But he didn’t know how to fix things.  The silence grew oppressive again.  “How long have I been here?”
Draco whirled back around to face him.  “Don’t be obtuse, Potter!  You were there!  You spoke to the doctors.  Do you think I wouldn’t give anything to remember?” Draco defended himself.
Harry felt momentarily sorry about the fright he had just undoubtedly given them, but then his anger overtook him once again.  “Well, apparently I can, Malfoy!  I just did!” he shouted back.  Al let out a loud wail just then, bringing his attention back to the reason he had done this in the first place.  He dropped the baby’s bag, marched over to Draco and put the crying baby into his arms.  “This is your daughter.  It’s time you met her, and I need a shower.” Harry headed toward the bedroom that Narcissa hadn’t used on his previous visit.  He paused at the doorway, “I need help, and you’re going to give it to me.  We’ll either live here or at Grimmauld Place, I don’t care which, but you are going to help parent our daughter.”  With that pronouncement, Harry turned into the bedroom and headed toward a door he hoped was the bathroom.
“I’ve got rounds, but let one of the nurses know if the pain worsens,” with that, Wilcox left the room.
Knowing he wasn’t going to like the answer, Harry asked anyway, “What’s a consummation component?”  He addressed his question to Bill, wanting to hear the answer from a man he trusted.
“Alright then mate, take care of the kids, and Mum and Dad.  We’ll see you at the hospital,” with that, Ron disapparated Hermione and himself.
“Be serious, Potter!” Draco insisted with another frown.  He moved off the couch to pace in front of the fireplace.
Then it was too late to worry any more.  Draco was entering the garden and moving across to where Harry was standing.  He was wearing dove grey wizarding robes, edged in pale icy blue.  His robes reached mid-calf and underneath he was wearing black Muggle trousers and shoes.
“Harry we can’t have you touching him while we run diagnostics,” a healer called Uilliam requested.  “You can stay, you just have to move away.”
“Then why didn’t you bring him here?” Potter’s bright green eyes locked with Draco’s own. Draco looked away, unable to look Potter in the eye and admit his desperation. “Draco!” Potter shook him again. “Who is it? Is it a Death Eater who escaped? I can bring it to Robards, the Aurors can get him. Let me help, Draco.”
Harry reached out and took both of Draco’s hands in his and enjoyed the pleasure that washed over him with this small act.  He threaded their fingers and tugged, hoping to get Draco to look at him.  Draco flicked him a quick glance, his grey eyes were flat and emotionless.  Harry’s heart started breaking.  Bill started chanting a spell and a strange blue light swirled around them, then abruptly it was gone.
Just then, Potter broke away and strode over to Draco. He was carrying the snake-head, from the end of his father’s cane, which they had converted into the talisman. If all went well, it would lead them straight to the Dark Lord. And if it did not go well, well… that wasn’t worth contemplating right now. “Let’s go, Malfoy.” Potter had a hard look on his face, and Draco was glad that they were on the same side this time.
“Why don’t we all sit and talk?” Thropwaite said, gesturing to the chairs clustered at the front of the classroom.
“I’ll owl her when I return home. We will work on this tomorrow. 8:00 AM?” Potter said before surprising Draco with what he said next. “I assume you prefer to work here at the Manor, to be close at hand to your mother.”
The first attack came in a flurry of claws and fangs and leathery wings. Draco had no idea what these creatures were but that didn’t matter as he and Potter fought for their lives. They stood back to back and flung curses for what seemed like hours until finally, the attack ceased. They paused only for a quick reassurance that the other wasn’t injured before continuing on their course.
When Draco broke away, they were both breathing heavily again.  “Before I married you, someone should have warned me that you were insatiable!”
The faint red light from further down the passage allowed Draco to just make out Potter’s features. He could feel the hard muscles of Potter’s body pressed all along the length of his own. He knew it was entirely inappropriate for the time and place, maybe being this close to his own mortality had made him foolhardy, but all Draco could think about at that moment was pressing his lips against Potter’s. The other man was always filled with so much emotion and passion that Draco imagined his kisses would be life-altering for a Malfoy. He focused on Potter’s mouth, his lips glowing rosy from the faint red light. Without conscious thought, he pressed himself even closer to Potter and lowered his head until their lips were mere millimeters apart.
Wearily he made his way to his bed.  He stopped to check on Al and was bemused at the sight that greeted him.  Tiny Hilly was sitting in the rocking chair, cradling a sleeping Al in her arms, singing a soft lullaby.  She looked up when she noticed Harry and gave him an adoring smile, then she went back to singing to the sleeping baby.  Clearly, Harry thought, he would have to rethink his ‘no House Elves will raise his child’ policy.  Hilly was obviously in her element and Al could only benefit by having more people who loved her, in her life.
Harry had been nearly an hour late for work this morning, but his idiotic smile hadn’t left his face for hours.  It turned out he hadn’t been able to have lunch with Draco after all.  Robards had pulled Harry into a strategy meeting, and he had had to send Draco a message canceling lunch.  The other Aurors had ribbed him, pointing out what a sappy lovesick fool he was.  But he took it with good grace, knowing it was all true.  He adored his husband and couldn’t get enough of him!
“No, you have to do it again!  Put your hand over your face.  She likes it when she sees you again,” Draco directed.
All was ready for their date.  Molly was thrilled to get Al all to herself for the afternoon.  Harry had gone out to the shed last night and had cleaned and polished their brooms.  Hilly packed them a picnic lunch.  Harry apparated them both out to a meadow in the countryside that they had used for flying before.  It was the perfect late summer day, warm but with a slight breeze.  Harry handed Draco his broom and set down the picnic basket.  He cast the appropriate wards and muggle rappelling charms.  Then he pulled a snitch out of his pocket, “Care for a match?” he asked with a grin.
Harry bit his lip and glanced away briefly before looking back at Draco. He took a deep breath and then spoke, “Um… well… apparently, if you agree to stay in the underworld because of… love—you are released from your promise.”
“Of course, mother,” Draco responded as he moved toward a chair and pulled it out for his mother.  Harry stood there unsure, as usual, about the etiquette required in this situation.  Draco seated himself next to his mother, “Potter, If you are waiting for me to pull out your chair too, you will be standing a very long time.”
More Healers came into the room and, in hushed tones, conferred with the others.  Ron put an arm around Harry and squeezed his shoulder.  “He’s gonna’ make it, Harry.  Draco is one of the toughest blokes I know.”  Harry made no response, mired as he was in his own worry and panic.  Ron seemed to understand this and just kept a supporting arm around Harry while they waited.
“Look, Harry, one day you are going to look over at me and think to yourself, ‘What the hell am I doing with Draco Malfoy? He’s an arrogant asshole, and I can do much better!’  And then you will remove me from your life.  It’s bound to happen sooner or later.  I mean I’m a former Death Eater.  There’s only one way this ends.” Draco swiped the tears away and closed his eyes.  “I was trying to protect myself . . . trying not to fall in love with you,” he said dejectedly, “failed spectacularly at that too.”
“You’ve wrecked me, Draco.  How am I supposed to go into work and get anything done?” Harry smiled and tightened his arms.  “Are you at St Mungo’s or the Ministry today?”
Draco’s smile grew wider and more tears slipped down his cheeks as the ring was placed on his finger.  He grasped Harry’s left hand and gently removed his wedding band and held it up, “With this ring, I pledge myself to you, my husband, my heart, my body and my soul,” he repeated, emotion choking his voice.  Then he slid the ring back onto Harry’s hand.  “I fucking love you too,” he whispered.
“Aah,” Draco whined, as he tried to push back into the hand on his ass.  Harry barely dipped his fingers to brush against his pucker.  “Fucking tease, Potter,” he growled pushing up and glaring at Harry.  Draco pushed one leg between Harry’s and pressed against his erection, and rubbed his own cock on Harry’s leg.
The silence that followed her pronouncement was shattered when Dilly popped in. “Master Draco is being needed by the Mistress.” She focused her eyes unblinking on Draco. “Master Draco is needed now.”
Harry laughed back and rummaged in the basket next to him, “Well I have a sandwich or a biscuit?  Or you could have a kiss?”  The laughter fell away and Harry held his breath while he waited for Draco’s answer.  He looked at Draco, whose eyes were flicking from Harry’s mouth to his eyes and back again.
“You can let go for a minute,” Harry allowed, as he placed his hands over Draco’s and gently pried them from the headboard.  He then pulled the sleeves of Draco’s shirt off his arms.  He took the time to rub and squeeze the muscles of his arms, releasing the tension.  He then took turns with each of his hands massaging them carefully.  Draco was still looking dazed but his breathing had slowed and he had stopped rocking his hips.  “Do you think you can hold on some more?” Harry asked.  Draco took a deep breath and nodded.  Harry once again brought his hands up and curled them around the headboard.  “Good boy,” Harry whispered, eliciting another groan from Draco.
He heard Malfoy’s bed creak right before Pomfrey bustled back in .“All set then gentlemen?”  She whisked the screen away.  “All right then, you will both spend the night here.  If the pain comes back, we can push the beds together,” she said matter-of-factly.
“That’s not . . . I don’t . . .,” Draco sputtered.  “Our shower is considerably smaller than the Slytherin locker room.  There’s just not room.”
“Well . . . you were the youngest seeker at Hogwarts,” Draco said, bitterness creeping into his voice.
Harry hurriedly sat down in the chair next to Draco’s.  “I wasn’t waiting for that,” he mumbled under his breath.  Once they were all seated, the food magically appeared on their plates just as it had during the feasts at Hogwarts.  He could only identify about half of the things on his plate, but he refused to let that show and gamely picked up his fork.
“You’re in no shape to apparate, mate,” Ron pointed out as they moved quickly though the building.  “Let me side-along you.”
“Oh, she is perfect, isn’t she?  Hi, sweetheart.  I’m your Auntie Hermione!  And I’m going to spoil you rotten, yes I am,” Hermione spoke sweetly to the baby in her arms.  When Ron pulled Harry into his arms for an extended hug, she whispered to the tiny girl, “you have the very best daddy!  I couldn’t bear to part with you for anyone else!”
Draco nodded, “That’s acceptable, Potter.”  He looked over toward the hallway, “Where will I be staying?”
“It’s so hard, Narcissa,” Harry’s voice broke too.  “He’s not even trying.  He won’t see me, and he wouldn’t come for his own daughter!”  Harry scrubbed away angry tears.  “Tell him he should have been here!  She needs her Papa too!”
Harry had never before in his life given anyone a striptease, but the love and desire on his husband’s face spurred him on.  He popped the button and eased open the fly of his trousers.  He looked down, slid one hand inside and palmed himself, giving his dick a welcome squeeze.  Draco made a high needy groan and drew Harry’s attention back to him.  He was laid out in a long line, arching his hips off the bed and his hands were gripping the headboard so tightly that his knuckles had turned white.  “Fuck!” Harry growled.  Draco looked so delicious like that!  Harry hurriedly pushed off his trousers, leaving him in only his tight black boxer briefs.  He traced his fingers along the outline of his hard cock, teasing both himself and Draco.  Earning him another groan from the man on the bed.
Draco started to move away from Harry, but he stopped him by resting both hands against the mantle.  Caging Draco in his arms.  Draco raised his hands up to push against Harry’s chest, but Harry refused to move and Draco stopped pushing when Harry began to speak, “I think you can imagine it.”
Resigned to another day of Draco avoiding him, Harry headed to the study to grab a Quidditch magazine that Hilly now kept organized on their own shelf.  He was halfway into the darkened room when he realized Draco was standing over by the fireplace, with a framed photo in his hands.  It was a wizarding photo from their wedding day.  They had both been dressed in custom-made tuxedos.  Draco with a green and silver brocade waistcoat and a green bowtie, and Harry with a black on black brocade waistcoat and a green tie.  They had been so ridiculously happy that day.  They had married in the back garden here at Grimmauld Place, surrounded by their friends and family.  Harry had never seen Draco smile and laugh so much.  The photo Draco held was a candid one that had been snapped when Draco had surprised Harry from behind and spun him around and into his arms for a passionate kiss in front of everyone.  They had both pulled back from the kiss and laughed with the sheer joy of the day.  This was Harry’s most treasured photo from that day.
“What…? I still don’t understand. What’s this provision?” Draco placed his own hand on top of Harry’s hand that was touching him, anchoring himself in that touch.
Harry had just lifted his hand to knock when the door swung open.  “Going to stand there all day Potter, or were you planning to join us,” Draco said snidely as he stepped back from the door.  Harry’s eyes ate up the sight of Draco.  He was wearing a crisp black shirt with black trousers and a green and black striped tie (not quite his house tie).  He looked amazing.  The dark clothing was a perfect foil for his blond hair and ice grey eyes.  He looked amazing and entirely unapproachable.  Harry’s heart sank.
“Yeah,” he answered, too caught up in the intensity of Draco’s stare to give a more coherent response.
Once all was in readiness, with shaking hands he withdrew the parchment from his pocket and unfolded it. He read through the words silently until he was confident he wouldn’t stumble during the spell.
Malfoy released Harry and they all moved to the front of the room and sat down.  “Well,” Bill began, “Here’s what we know so far.  The curse is one that used to be used frequently in arranged wizarding marriages.  It requires proximity of the cursed parties or they will feel pain similar to a
Even though he was tempted to accept this brush off and move on to the kissing plan, Harry knew this was an important moment in trying to repair their marriage.  “That’s not good enough, Draco.  I think you owe me more of an explanation than that.  You didn’t want to stay with me . . . and now you do.  What changed?”
“Why?” Draco asked, his voice cracking slightly.  Harry had to squeeze his fingers together, in order to stop himself from reaching out to him.
Draco hoped to put an end to this nonsense. “Pansy, I dare you to not take a single drink until the end of this game.”
Harry’s eyes had adjusted to the moonlight and he could see that Draco was clutching tightly at the blankets across his chest.  “Did you . . . did you, ah . . . like it?” Harry asked, his heart pounding so loudly in his ears that he almost missed Draco’s response.
Harry stood up, he couldn’t do this sitting down.  “Because, here’s the thing,” all their classmates looked back over to Harry again, “I’m in love with you . . . I love you, Draco.”
Harry had tried talking to him about it.  He tried during the day, but Draco would stiffen up and change the subject or walk out of the room.  He had tried once at night, but Draco had gotten up and left the room and not returned that night.  So Harry had stopped pushing it, thinking that at least he was getting part of Draco having him in his arms at night.  But this situation was slowly tearing him apart.
Harry couldn’t bring himself to return home without Draco so he headed over to Ron and Hermione’s, and slept on their couch.  He knew he was in the way, but the hustle and bustle of the busy household helped keep him from dwelling in his own unhappiness.  He hadn’t heard anything more from Draco.  He had owled twice but had received no reply.  He had almost daily contact with Narcissa, though.  She kept him filled in on Draco’s moods and urged him to be patient with her son.
Malfoy clamped his hand on the back of Harry’s neck and dragged him close.  His lips pressed firmly to Harry’s own.  They were so warm, almost hot, and Harry had not been expecting that.  If he had thought about Malfoy’s lips at all he would have imagined them being cool, as cool as his ice grey eyes and pale moonlight hair.  But they weren’t, they were hot and they ignited Harry.  Malfoy’s mouth moved over Harry’s, his lips firm and soft, pressing and sucking – and fuck, what was happening.
Draco seemed to wilt a little and his shoulders slumped, “Mother heard your pronouncement and declared that it was time for her to return to France.  She will be returning this afternoon.”  Draco looked away from Harry and took a deep breath, “All things considered we will have much more room at Grimmauld Place, so I will move there.”  At Harry’s relieved smile, Draco hastened to add, “I don’t believe for one minute that this arrangement will be sustainable.  We will want to kill each other within days.”
“Well . . . I want us to celebrate as a family.  I want our baby girl with us,” he tried to look away again, but Harry wouldn’t let him turn his face.
“What do you mean?” A frown creased Draco’s forehead, and then it suddenly cleared.  He got an intense look in his eyes and he leaned toward Harry, “Well . . . you were a very generous lover.”
Draco was torn but he knew Harry would want him to go help his mother, it was why he had made his sacrifice after all. He took Dilly’s extended hand and allowed her to Apparate him directly to his mother’s chamber.
“But why now?” Pansy piped up. “Why has the curse hit now? It’s been six years since Potter defeated him.”
A few hours later found Harry and Draco standing in the middle of the living room at Grimmauld Place, the baby in Harry’s arms and Draco’s trunk at their feet.  “You must be out of your mind, Potter, if you think I will spend one minute living in this sty,” Draco said disparagingly.
The tentative truce that they had fostered earlier in the year had disintegrated with the arrival of the curse.  The few times Malfoy addressed him directly, his voice was cold and cutting.  And even though they needed to remain in proximity, Malfoy managed to never touch Harry directly.
“Your mum?” Harry’s voice broke into Draco’s thoughts. “I almost forgot… is she…?” Harry squeezed the hand he was holding.
Harr didn’t know how to begin, the weight of all of his emotions was pressing down on him.  “I . . . er, I’m so sorry.  So sorry, Draco,” his gravelly voice roughened even more with emotion.
It was late afternoon when Draco woke up. He showered and dressed before making his way to check on his mother. He nodded to the house-elf who was sitting nearby and then moved to her bedside. There was no change. She was still in the heavy drugged sleep from the Healer’s potion. He touched her pale cheek softly before turning back to the house-elf. “Notify me immediately if there is any change,” he directed.
Harry tried to speak but the pain was too great.  Ron and Hermione dragged him back into the room to sit at a desk.  “Professor!” Ron shouted.  The pain receded slightly.
“Dying,” Potter said flatly. “Dying wasn’t like that.” Potter was looking at his feet and refusing to meet Draco’s stare.
The other person who hadn’t come was his husband.  The love of his life, Al’s papa, had not shown up.  Narcissa had come by with apologies and more pleas for patience, but Harry’s patience was at an end.  This wasn’t right, it wasn’t supposed to be like this.  He had never planned on being a single parent.  He should have his partner by his side, helping him in caring for their daughter.
Slowly Draco’s lashes fluttered and sleepy grey eyes were looking back at Harry.  He didn’t seem surprised or upset by how close Harry was lying next to him, just cautious.  He didn’t pull away, so Harry kept stroking his hair.  “Hi,” Harry breathed out.
Now that they were actually standing in front of the Veil, Draco was too numb to feel the horror and fear he knew he should. He could hear voices as he stared into the swirling depths, but he couldn’t tell what they were saying. Off to his right, Potter was huddled with Granger and Weasley. No doubt they were trying to talk him out of this, and quite rightly so. He could hardly believe it himself that Potter was willing to risk his life for him.
“No, I’m afraid it’s impossible. She was cursed by the Dark Lord, and he is the only one who can remove it. And, well… he’s been destroyed, of course,” the Healer said apologetically.
Blaise smiled warmly at Harry, “That’s okay, Harry.  Thanks for that, but I’m okay with answering the question.  I have nothing to hide.”  He flashed his most charming smile around the circle. “I like both.  The answer is, I like both.”
“God!  I love you!” Harry said as he brought their mouths together.  Slowly, he brushed their lips together, creating delicate friction.  Draco opened his mouth with a needy cry, and Harry stroked his tongue inside.  He tightened his fingers in Draco’s hair when his tongue stroked back, and he rocked his hips bringing their hard cocks to rub together.
“Oh, for fucks sake!” Draco moved one hand to the nape of Harry’s neck and the other to the small of his back and he dragged him forward until the full length of their bodies were touching.  “Does this seem like I’m mad at you?”
Draco’s head turned restlessly and he groaned as he opened his eyes.  “Pahh,” he croaked.  “Water,” he whispered, holding his hand out in demand.  Harry handed him the closest thing he could find, a cold cup of tea.  Draco drank deeply and then made a face, “Couldn’t cast a warming charm, Potter?”
Malfoy closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, but his hands started to move, gently mapping the muscles of Harry’s chest.  Harry dropped his forehead and rested it on Malfoy’s shoulder.  His head felt so heavy and the room was still spinning.  He tried to think, he knew there was something important he was missing.  “We should sleep now,” Malfoy whispered in his ear, pulling Harry down onto the bed.  He ended up lying half on top of Malfoy, but was too comfortable to move.  He heard Malfoy cast
“I don’t believe you,” Harry said with his heart hammering in his throat.  He knew he was taking a risk by pushing Draco, but he couldn’t lose him now.
She set him up in a nearby room with a hospital bed and a nearby bassinet.  When she left, Harry laid his daughter down in the baby bed and pulled it next to the hospital bed.  He lay down on the bed, the enormity of the day catching up to him.  He had the child he always wanted, but without the man who meant everything to him.  With his heart aching, Harry fell into an exhausted slumber.
When Thropwaite announced that Bill Weasley would be coming as a guest lecturer on the topic of curses, it pleased Harry for multiple reasons.  Firstly, he would enjoy seeing Bill again, especially under happier circumstances.  Secondly, he wasn’t all that convinced of Thropwaite’s credentials but he knew they would receive quality information from Bill.  And, lastly, he was looking forward to having something else to think about other than the feel of Malfoy’s mouth on his own.
Ron spun a fifteen-minute long tale of how he had booby-trapped Professor Flitwick’s desk with billywigs and imps.  Then he turned to Draco. “Malfoy, truth or dare?”
Harry kept his hand atop Draco’s and squeezed it again, “You haven’t ruined anything!  The point of this day was to relax and get comfortable with each other.  Thank you for telling me that.  Look, we can go as slow as you need to.  I’m just happy you’re willing to talk to me.”  Harry gave one final squeeze of his hand and then pulled away to rummage in the picnic basket.  “Let’s eat!  I’m starved.  Then maybe we can fit in one more game?”
Harry got his trousers unfastened and pulled them down his legs.  That was so much better.  He threw them over the side of the bed too.  He looked over at Malfoy, he didn’t look so good.  His face was flushed and his mouth was open, and it looked like he was having trouble breathing. “Draco?  Are you okay?” Harry leaned closer to peer into Malfoy’s eyes.
“I’ll cast first,” Malfoy said.  “You can copy down the symbols so that we will be able to decipher them.”
Draco spoke slowly, exaggerating each word, “The – elves – at – the – hotel – told – me – they – get – paid!”
But with Malfoy plastered to his side, he had been unable to relieve his aching cock even once.  It was Friday morning, and he had woken up with full on morning wood.  Opening his eyes to see Malfoy still sleeping didn’t help one bit.  His long lashes fanned against his cheeks and his lips were parted the tiniest bit.  He looked so soft and approachable like this.  Harry knew the softness would only last a few seconds as he awoke, and then the hard expression would come onto his face and he would be cold and remote once again.
Draco made a high moan in the back of his throat and tilted his hips to push himself further onto Harry’s prick.  Harry took this as his cue and resumed slowly pressing into his husband.  When he was fully seated he stopped and rested, placing his weight on his elbows.  “You ok, Baby?” he asked, looking into Draco’s eyes.
Harry was enjoying flustered Draco, this was much better than the cold angry version.  And now that he had had the idea for the shower, he couldn’t get the thought of showering with Draco out of his head.  “Look, we can face in opposite directions if you’re squeamish.”  Harry turned and started walking toward the bathroom.
Once in the bedroom, Draco crowded Harry up against the nearest wall.  One hand tight on Harry’s hip and the other on the back of his neck.  The moment stretched out as they looked at each other, their breath quickening.  Draco leaned in for a kiss but stopped with his mouth a hair’s breadth away from Harry’s lips.  He slid the hand at the back of his neck up to tangle possessively in Harry’s hair.  “I want you,” Draco whispered roughly.
Bill cleared his throat before answering, “Uh, you may, uh . . . the curse might require you to . . .”
And just like that, Harry’s heart broke again.  This!  This was everything he had imagined back when he and Draco had dreamed of starting a family.  Draco cradling their child and looking so happy.  Tears welled up in Harry’s eyes and fell softly down his face.
Harry reached over and rested his hand on top of Draco’s.  He squeezed it slightly, “I won’t laugh Draco.  I guess that means you hadn’t had sex by sixth year?”
“Sit them down over here.” She turned toward the students and indicated two nearby hospital beds.  “Good, good.  Now, the rest of you students need to head back to class.  I will take good care of Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy.  If they are still here, you may see them during visiting hours tonight.”
The tears were now sliding unchecked into his hair, as Draco made no move to wipe them away.  “It’s only a matter of time you know,” Draco’s voice was a desperate whisper.
Harry sheepishly looked down at the ground.  “I may have used our vows from the first time,” he peeked up at Draco to judge his reaction, but Draco was still looking surprised.  “But that doesn’t mean that I don’t mean them!  I do!  All of it!” he rushed to clarify.
I'm posting this update on the one year anniversary of my first post to AO3!  It's been an incredible year.  Thank you to all who have read my stories and to those who have given Kudos and left comments!  I appreciate all of it.  C-
“Yes!  Yes!” Hilly smile got wider, “Sirs can stay here and talk a long time.  Hilly is looking after the Little Miss.”  She carried the baby out of the room, talking to her quietly the whole time.
They had their bookbags, so they spent the remainder of the afternoon reading and doing homework.  Their friends all trooped in after dinner to see how they were.  By some unspoken agreement, both Harry and Malfoy remained tight lipped with their friends about the nature of the curse.
Harry must have asked him a question, and Neville must have answered but Harry didn’t remember any of that.  All of a sudden Neville shocked Harry back into awareness. “Draco, truth or dare?”
Then all was silent except for the sounds of their heavy breaths as they quieted down.  Even as his body wanted to relax into nothingness, Harry’s brain started racing.  What had they just done?  Malfoy had urged him on, and had touched himself too!  Did this mean something?  Did Harry want it to?
“I can’t have a husband who won’t . . . who doesn’t want to be with me,” Harry wearily replied.  “I think we should  . . . separate.”  His heart was screaming at him to stop talking, but his mouth continued, “We can share custody of Al.”
Harry thought about stepping in to answer the question he knew Draco was asking, but he was taking perverse pleasure in seeing Draco unsettled and uncomfortable.  He was pleased he had any effect at all on Draco.
“Let’s go back to bed,” Harry suggested on impulse.  He wasn’t all that hungry and he had barely gotten to touch Draco at all.  Draco fixed him with another enigmatic stare, but he nodded in agreement.  They left their wet towels in the bathroom for the elves to handle.  Harry took Draco’s hand and pulled him back to their bed.  They tumbled together into the sheets.  Harry decided that the feel of Draco’s bare skin against his own was one of the best things he had ever felt, and he thought that this was something he wanted to feel every day.  Now he just had to convince Draco.
He looked down at the sight in front of him.  Draco’s red lips were parted and he was panting.  His cock was hard and wet, lying against his stomach.  His whole body was tense, poised for Harry’s next move.  Harry moved up on his knees.  He hooked his hands under Draco’s legs and bent his knees, pushing them back and up.  He exposed Draco’s balls and hole to his gaze.  Draco made a soft whining noise and shifted, causing his ass to wiggle enticingly.  “Grab your legs and hold them back,” Harry ordered huskily.  Draco complied with another moan and it left Harry’s hands and mouth free to play.
“You could pay them,” Draco suggested.  Harry raised an eyebrow quizzically but didn’t reply.  “You can!” Draco insisted.
Draco’s hands came back around Harry and started caressing up and down his back, and then both hands went lower, cupping and squeezing his ass.  Harry’s prick was hard and aching, and the feel of Draco’s hands on him as well as rubbing up against Draco’s pajama-clad cock were going to send him over the edge too quickly.  “Oh, Baby!  I missed you so much,” Harry thrust his body against Draco’s and kissed him passionately.
“Yes, flying.  Surely you remember how much you love to fly?” Harry responded.  “We have brooms.  In the shed out back.  What do you say?”
Potter’s gaze swung from Dilly to Draco and back again. “I’m sorry about Narcissa, Malfoy… but I’m not a Healer…”
Draco whined when Harry lifted his mouth away, but that turned into a groan when he carefully slid a lubed finger in.  As he slowly pumped his finger in and out, Harry reached for Draco’s prick.  It was practically standing up straight and had been steadily leaking on his stomach.  Draco pulled his legs wider apart when Harry pushed in a second finger and leaned down to suck at the head of his cock.  “Oh, please!  Oh . . . please!” Draco was begging again.  Harry loved being able to take him apart like this and growled in his throat, knowing Draco would feel the vibration.
He lifted a finger to gently push back a lock of hair that had fallen across Draco’s eyes.  Draco murmured something Harry couldn’t understand and moved closer to Harry.  He pushed his face into Harry’s neck, and just seemed to burrow there.  Harry’s heartbeat stuttered before falling back into a normal rhythm.  Was this love?  Harry thought this might be love.  He realized, quite fiercely, that he would do anything to protect the man in his arms.  Anything at all!
While Harry was standing by Teddy, Narcissa came over to speak to him.  She gestured to Teddy and the baby, “She’s perfect, Harry.”
“No problem.  I’m on it,” Ron tossed over his shoulder as he left the room.  The healers left after him, deciding not to argue with Harry.
“For as long as you’ll have me,” Harry replied just as quietly, the smile dropping off his face as a serious expression replaced it. He moved forward until he was standing right in front of Draco, crowding his personal space.
“What? No! Of course not. My mother and I got rid of all of that as soon as possible, after the war. We turned it all over to the Ministry,” Draco asserted.
The room seemed to be getting warmer and Harry was getting lightheaded.  Was it possible that this room was airtight?  Was Harry slowly losing oxygen?  He made a sob and clenched his hands.  He wasn’t going to be able to tell Draco that he didn’t mean what he had said this morning!  He wasn’t going to be able to take it back, and he was going to die.  He had said a lot of awful things he regretted.
“Why is the room spinning?” Harry giggled.  He closed his eyes to see if it would stop but that made it worse.  He opened his eyes again and they landed on Malfoy.  His hair was mussed up and his eyes were bright.  They had both tossed off their robes a few drinks ago.  Malfoy had taken off his tie and opened the first two buttons on his shirt, Harry could see the shadow of his collarbone and he was hit with the impulse to lick all along it.
Making a mockery of all of Draco’s Shielding Charms, Potter walked right up to him and grabbed the parchment out of his hand. “What’s this?!” he demanded.
The relief that began building when Draco started to speak, suddenly came crashing through his body and he couldn’t stop himself from grabbing Draco and pulling him into his arms.  Without finesse, Harry slammed his mouth against Draco’s.  His desperation, yearning, and love all came pouring out in his kiss.  He had one hand tangled in Draco’s hair and the other wrapped tightly around his waist, not letting the other man move even an inch away.
Draco lifted a hand towards Harry but then dropped it before he touched him. He wasn’t sure if he could trust his eyes or if this was just a manifestation of his longing, come to life? “You’re here?” he whispered.
First I want to apologize for how long it has taken me to update.  I had my first experience with writer's block.  :(  Hopefully, this chapter will make up for it.  It is pure mush and tooth-rotting fluff, but I kind of needed it.  There will be one more chapter after this, and that one will have all of the smut!!  ;)
A huge thank you to all of you have left kudos and such wonderful comments!  I appreciate them more than you can know.  It is the best gift anyone can give me!
Harry wrapped his hand on top of Draco’s and held it still. “You didn’t force me to do anything, Draco.” His voice was equally quiet, not wanting to risk alerting the demons to their location. “I would never have let you do this alone.” His green eyes blazed with an indefinable light as they stared into Draco’s.
“Oh!  You’re a fucking tease, Potter!  Give me something more,” Draco demanded.  His face was flushed and his breath was starting to come in pants.  Harry eased the tip of one finger inside.  “More!” Draco panted, and grabbed Harry’s hand, trying to push him in farther.  Harry resisted, still only pushing that fingertip slowly in and out.  “Quit fucking around and start fucking me, Potter!” Draco demanded.
”Master Draco and Harry Potter and Harry Potter’s friend are needing to eat.” She tugged at her ears some more in distress. “Dilly was instructed not to disturb. But Master Draco is calling Dilly here, so she is not being disturbing. Dilly has made sandwiches…”
Now they were happily married and had turned Harry’s house into a home.  Draco had slowly but relentlessly replaced the shabby furnishings with more stylish ones.  They had opened up some of the small cramped rooms by tearing down walls.  They had even created a large master suite that included a huge walk-in closet and luxuriously appointed master bath.  Harry kept teasing Draco that he was trying to turn Grimmauld Place into Malfoy Manor.  Draco’s standard reply was to scoff and say, “Not bloody likely!”
Harry’s mind raced.  Draco was upset and angry and that hurt Harry's heart, and who was it that he was in love with?  Was that the reason why the bond had bothered Draco?  Because he was in love with someone else?
But during their day of bliss, there was one thing that they hadn’t done.  Well, make that two things that they hadn’t done.  Firstly, they hadn’t fucked.  Like in the arse.  Harry wasn’t sure why they hadn’t.  Draco had slipped his fingers inside him a couple of times, and that had felt really good.  But they hadn’t gone farther than that.
The laughter faded as Harry looked into Draco’s eyes.  He slid his left hand back to cup Draco’s neck and bring him closer.  The right hand he slipped under Draco’s shirt to caress the soft skin at his waist.  With their lips just millimeters apart, Harry waited breathing softly.  He desired Draco so badly his whole body ached, but he also needed to know that Draco wanted him back.  So he waited.
Harry hooked his fingers into the waistband and pulled them down just enough to expose the head of Draco’s cock.  The foreskin was pulled back and the head was dark pink and wet with precome.  “Perfect,” Harry whispered.  He breathed a puff of warm air across the tip and Draco moaned as his prick jerked involuntarily.  Harry wet his lips and then darted his tongue out to tease all around the head.  Draco twisted the sheets tighter and arched his hips up seeking more friction.  Harry rewarded him by sucking the velvety head into his warm mouth and swirling his tongue all around it.
Loud banging on their door echoed around the small room.  “Harry!  Come on!  You need to get up.  Both of you!  Dumbledore wants you both up in his office.  Immediately!!” Ron’s voice carried easily through the solid wood.
“You would feel compelled to . . . do . . . certain acts.  And you would feel pain if you resisted the compulsion.” Bill was looking around the room refusing to meet their eyes.
“There’s no way Potter can do that! Just look at him!” Draco waved his hand dismissively in Potter’s direction. “It was just dumb luck that he defeated him in the first place.” He was sure Dilly had good intentions, but she was wide off the mark here.
Harry stopped the first Healer he could find, “Draco’s awake, but something’s gone wrong!”  Harry returned to the room with the Healer in tow.  Draco and Narcissa were whispering furiously, but broke apart when they arrived.
Harry stared at Draco, putting all of his energy into willing him to wake up and smile at him.  He had never been a very religious man, but he was willing to pray to any and all gods and goddesses if they could help save Draco.
Draco whipped around to face Harry so quickly he dropped the clothes he was holding.  “What?” he squawked.
They had been holding the bedside vigil for three days.  Narcissa had come over from France immediately.  Neither she nor Harry had left Draco’s bedside for more than a few brief minutes at a time.  They used quick cleaning charms and transfigured their chairs for sleeping.  Hermione and Ron took turns sitting with them, Ron staying the bulk of the time because Hermione tired easily in her ninth month of pregnancy.
“That’s not an answer, Baby,” Harry smirked.  He leaned forward putting his weight on one hand next to Draco’s head.  With his other hand, he used his thumb to trace his lips and pull at his bottom lip.  “Now, do you want a reward?  I’m gonna need a yes or a no on that.”
“Draco, you don’t know shit!  I’m not going to leave you.  I love you!”  Harry pulled Draco up to sit next to him on the bed.  “You are not that scared boy anymore.    You have done so much with your life!  You are an amazing, brilliant and caring man!”
Harry played another round of the game, this time paying close attention to Al when he lowered his hand.  “Oh!  There!” he crowed when he saw the baby smile.
Draco was continuing, his voice getting lower and deeper, “Merlin!  The things you did with your tongue, Potter!”
“Baby, you’re doing so well!  Be good for me and don’t let go yet,” Harry leaned down and licked the hard leaking tip of Draco’s cock just as he slid a second finger into his ass.  Leaving him a writhing moaning mess, thrusting helplessly up into Harry’s touch.  The sight of Draco arching underneath him and lost in his pleasure almost made Harry come right then and he barely kept control.
Conversation over, they both crossed back to where Draco was sitting at the large table where they had spread out all the books they thought might help. Granger looked unhappy but Potter flashed him a small smile, and that worried Draco more than Granger’s unhappiness. “Since Harry is determined to go through with this mad scheme”—Granger reached over and squeezed Potter’s hand—“then I think I may have found a way.”
“How are you both feeling this morning?” Dumbledore asked them.  They both muttered quick and insincere assurances that they were fine.  “Mr. Weasley should arrive sometime this morning and he will get right to work solving this curse.  But in the meantime we have made some arrangements to help ease the situation,” Dumbledore paused briefly and then continued, “We have moved Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hopkins into your dormitories’, leaving the one they occupied free for the two of you.  Your belongings have already been moved there for you.”  Dumbledore paused again, longer this time, to let this news sink in.
For one, there was the strange thing that happened in the library.  Harry had been returning from the stacks, his arms weighed down with a pile of books for his History of Magic assignment.  He walked over to where other students were sitting and working at tables.  He saw Malfoy sitting alone at a table, his parchments and books spread across the whole surface.  As he drew nearer, he watched Malfoy draw his wand and move the books and papers into neat stacks, leaving half of the table now clear.  Harry was so startled he halted in his tracks.  Malfoy hadn’t said anything or even looked at him, but Harry couldn’t shake the idea that he had cleared this space for him.  Harry sat in the empty chair and plopped his books down.  “Thanks,” he mumbled quietly.
The silence after Draco’s question seemed to go on forever, grey eyes and green sending silent messages between them. Finally, Harry spoke softly, “I love you.” Draco’s breath hitched and an involuntary sob escaped before he covered his mouth, stopping any more embarrassing sounds from escaping. “What do you think about that?” Harry asked quietly.
Malfoy kicked off his shoes and headed toward their bed. Not really understanding what was going on, Harry followed suit.  When they were both sitting up against the headboard Malfoy opened the whisky, put the bottle to his lips and threw back his head to swallow.  Harry watched with fascination as his Adam’s apple moved when he swallowed.
Potter pushed his thigh between Draco’s legs and pressed him into the wall. Draco could feel Potter’s hard length against his hips and he knew Potter could feel his too. He rocked his hips into him, relishing the answering groan when he did. When the need for breath grew too strong, they broke apart. Potter had dazed eyes and wet puffy lips, and Draco could do nothing else but pull him back in for more. Long minutes later, he released Potter’s mouth only to move his own lips to the strong column of Potter’s throat. He licked and nibbled and sucked, causing Potter to pant and moan and babble incoherently. “Draco!” he gasped, “Didn’t hope… want you… need you… so long…” Draco moved to take his mouth again, wanting to possess Potter and make him forget about anyone else.
“What he’s trying to say is that we might have to have sex,” Malfoy interrupted.  Both boys’ faces turned bright red.
Harry was halfway through his meal, which turned out to be delicious but still unidentifiable, when Draco broke the silence.  “What is it you do exactly?” Draco asked in a polite but remote tone.
“Arrogant Slytherin, always trying to torture me,” Harry grumbled, sprinkling Draco’s neck with kisses in between his words.
Malfoy’s face fell. “No, I’m not, Potter.  Hard as that may be for you to wrap your brain around.  Not everyone believes the sun shines out of your arse.  You should’ve gotten yourself bonded to Blaise.”
As Harry took his seat, next to a stiffly sitting Malfoy, he could see a pile of everyday objects sitting on a table at the front of the room.  Thropwaite addressed the class, “Students, as you can see we will be using the trainers today.  I have written the Curse Revealing Spell on the board.  I want you to take a few minutes to practice the words with your partners.  I will be levitating the objects over to your desks.  And even though the curses placed on these objects are mild, do not, I repeat, do not touch any of these objects directly!  You will use your wands to cast the Revealing Spell and there will be no reason for you to touch the cursed object.”  Thropwaite paused to look sternly around the room. “Is that clear?”
While Thropwaite floated a cursed object over to each pair’s desk, Malfoy copied down the new spell and began to practice it.  “Now when you cast the Revealing Spell,” Professor Thropwaite was speaking again, “the results should show as symbols around the object.  Use the chart that we completed last week as a reference to determine the nature of the curse.”  After he finished talking, he floated an ornate hairbrush onto Harry and Malfoy’s desk.  It was polished silver with ornate scrollwork decorating it.  Harry had the random thought that it looked like something that might be at home on Malfoy’s own dresser.
In the midst of all this, Ron and Hermione rushed into the room.  “Harry!” Hermione cried, running to his side.  She was about to throw herself onto his chest when Ron grabbed the back of her shirt and hauled her backward.
“I haven’t… I wasn’t… I’m not keeping Potter undressed!” Draco sputtered as a hot blush turned his pale skin bright pink. “He came this way. It wasn’t my doing,” he defended.
Draco waved his hand to cut her off and tell her there was no need for food when Potter’s stomach let out a large rumble. “Uh, sorry. Sorry about that.” Potter ducked his head sheepishly.
Harry pulled off and looked up at Draco.  “Do you want to come like this?” he asked breathlessly, as he continued stroking his cock.  He leaned down and licked the tip again to punctuate his question.
“Don’t thank me yet, Malfoy,” Potter brushed off his thanks. “You can thank me if we both live through this.”
Narcissa held out her hands to Harry, and when he placed his hands into her, she squeezed them tightly.  “I’m pleased to see you, Harry.  Thank you for joining us,” she said graciously.  Draco lingered at the door for a few moments before moving to join them.  Silence descended as the two men stared at each other.  Into the awkward moment, Narcissa suggested, “Why don’t we proceed with luncheon.”  She gestured to the table, nearby, that was already set with linens and crystal.
It was true that he thought Malfoy was a fit bloke.  “Who wouldn’t?” he thought.  Tall and slim, he had firm muscles without being bulky and pale blond hair that fell perfectly around his face each day.  And speaking of his face, his pointy nose just fit in with the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones.  His lips, those surprisingly warm lips, were the softest palest pink and were just this side of too full.  But most captivating of all were his eyes.  His blond lashes, a shade darker than his hair, framed his dark grey eyes.  Grey that reminded Harry of a stormy sea or a thunder cloud.  Not that Harry had spent much time think about Malfoy.  It was just that he was so hard to miss that naturally Harry’s gaze would be drawn to him.  That really wasn’t Harry’s fault.  And now that Malfoy had kissed him, Harry was having a hard time dislodging Malfoy’s image from his brain.  But that was totally normal, right?
Just then a piercing scream echoed down the tunnel and both men froze. Potter dropped his forehead to Draco’s shoulder and took several shaky breaths. Then tightened his hold on Draco briefly before stepping away. “We can talk about this later? Yes?” he asked.
“It’s no problem,” Harry said hurriedly.  He needed to get away from Draco before he did something stupid like cry all over him or try to kiss him.  “I’ll let you get settled in, while I send an owl about the house elf.”  Harry moved down the hall towards his own room. When he reached his door, he looked back and Draco was still standing where he had left him.  He looked a bit lost or maybe a little defeated.  “Thanks, Draco,” Harry called back to him, “Thanks for trying this.”  With that, Harry rushed into his room before he lost all composure.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, “so much!”  Harry nervously wet his lips and looked up to see that Draco was doing the same.
Their other friends came by frequently, bringing food, and magazines for Harry and Narcissa.  Blaise and Ginny were there almost as much as Ron, and Pansy had come by at least once a day.  Andromeda had also come, leaving Teddy with Molly, and spent almost all of the daylight hours supporting her sister.
“Were we friends then?” Draco asked.  He broke their gaze and looked back down at his hands that were clasped loosely in front of him.
Dumbledore arrived just as their friends left.  He huddled with Thropwaite, speaking in hushed tones while Madam Pomfrey started in on diagnostic spells.
The students eagerly entered the DADA classroom this Thursday.  Professor Thropwaite had promised them that he was giving them some hands on practice.  He had obtained some cursed objects that were considered “trainers.”  They were the same kind that the Aurors used.  The objects were cursed with mild, non-lethal curses, so that the students could practice identifying and then breaking the curses.
Harry got to his feet too.  “I am serious, Draco,” he said the laughter draining from his voice.  “I had lost my memory.  I’m sure you’ll appreciate the irony of that.  And, well, you pretended to be my boyfriend.”
“Ministry.  Sorting through some potions that were confiscated last week.”  Draco leaned up on one elbow to look at Harry, “We could grab lunch if you want?”
Draco held himself rigidly.  Even though he was only a foot away from Harry, it felt like miles.  “I wouldn’t want to impose,” he said stiffly.
Harry stuffed his parchment carelessly into his bag. Malfoy had stopped to look something up in a book, so Harry left him and moved to join Hermione and Ron who were closer to the back of the room.  The trio had just reached the doorway when Harry felt a stabbing pain move through his body.  It felt almost like
“Dilly is not being born yesterday. Dilly will watch while Master Draco is eating.” She gave him her sternest look. She poured him a cup of tea adding milk and sugar just as Draco liked, and slid it over next to him.
“Oh, Baby!”  Harry placed both of his hands on Draco’s cheeks and held his face tenderly.  He rested their foreheads together.  “That is perfect!  You go get Al and I’ll grab a few more things.”
“No!  No want . . . Oh, fuck!  Want you inside me!” Draco growled as Harry continued to toy with his prick.
“I’m sure you both are eager to hear our news,” Dumbledore began.  “Mr. Weasley, why don’t you explain?”
Harry pulled back the tiniest bit and looked at Draco.  His eyes were still wide and he was breathing hard, but he hadn’t pulled away, so Harry leaned forward and press their lips together again.  The feel of his husband’s lips on his again, after days and days of worry, overwhelmed him.  He pulled Draco flush against him with one arm, while with the other hand he threaded his fingers tightly through Draco’s hair.  Draco’s lips parted under his and he slid his tongue into the wet heat of his mouth.
Harry tried to smile but he was sure it looked more like a grimace.  He was glad he hadn’t eaten any breakfast because he was so nauseated he was sure he would have just thrown it up.  “Great,” he forced out through gritted teeth.
Once Harry was on his side, he could hear cloth rustling and knew Malfoy was getting dressed.  They still hadn’t spoken, aside from the cleaning charm and his muttered thanks, but this was typical of the last few days.  Apparently, their morning activity wasn’t going to change this.
In the intervening years, Draco had occasionally consulted with the Auror department and he and Potter had maintained a cordial civility. During the past year, it had seemed like Potter was there every time he turned around: showing up at Ministry fundraisers and chatting with Draco over drinks, being at the same pubs during his weekly Friday night out with Pansy and Blaise and inviting himself to join them, and then there were the invitations.
“Like that, baby?” Harry asked huskily as he sped up his strokes.  With his free hand he had been stroking Draco’s chest and stomach, but when Draco’s hips started rocking, Harry used that hand to keep him still.
“I have no earthly idea,” Draco answered before he closed that tiny gap and brought their mouths together. Potter’s lips tensed against his for a brief moment before he gasped and parted them, allowing Draco to sweep his tongue inside. Potter moaned and wrapped a hand at the back of Draco’s neck anchoring him there. Draco had been right… this kiss was everything. Their tongues twined together and Draco poured all of his pent-up longing into it.
Draco turned to leave, but Harry hurriedly spoke up,” Don’t, don’t go.  It’s ok.  What . . . er, what did you want?”
, and he had a hard time catching his breath.  The pain coursed through his body again and Harry cried out, ”Aaaaaah!”
“We can and we will!”  Harry sat forward and leaned toward Draco, “You are not a teenager anymore, Draco. It’s time to grow up and be a man!  And start living up to your responsibilities.  You have a daughter now, and she comes first!  Look, I’m not talking about us, being together,” Harry waved a hand toward Draco.  “We can each have our own room.  But you need to be a father, and I’m not willing to do this part-time, so we will live together and both parent our baby.”  Harry was running on pure adrenaline at this point, but he needed to get this settled before he collapsed.  He looked over at Draco who was still frowning and sitting rigidly.  “Are we going to do that here, or at Grimmauld Place?”
“Muggles have these things called baby monitors, that let them listen to their babies from another room.  Hermione created a charm for the same purpose.  It will vibrate when the baby wakes up and it will start to chime if she is crying.  It will get louder as she does.”  Harry held out his hand expectantly.  Draco reluctantly handed over his wand, and Harry charmed it and handed it back.  “You will be on the first shift.  She wakes, every three hours.”
“What is it? What do you not want to tell me?” Draco asked urgently, panicking a bit. What was Harry keeping from him? Was this only temporary? “If you have to go back, I’m going too!” he blurted out.
“I mean, for a living,” Draco explained in exasperation.  “Unless maybe you don’t.  I suppose you’re rich enough not to work.”
Wank in the morning with bed curtains spelled and Silencing Charms in place, then sometimes another wank in the shower (slippery just felt so good), and always a bedtime wank just before falling asleep.
“Hardly!” Harry gave a dark laugh, “I had hardly even kissed anyone at that point.  And for several years after that!”
Harry looked over at Draco’s smirking face.  He truly wished he could have the pumpkin juice or a nice ale, but he refused to give Draco the satisfaction of asking for it.  Instead, he held up his glass toward Draco.  “Wine, of course, Draco.”  When his glass was poured, Harry took a sip and struggled to hide his grimace at tasting the tart liquid.
Fuck!  Harry needed to slow it down, or it would be over much too soon.  He let go of his prick, instead just tracing his fingertips over its length, swirling them over the tip and playing with his slit.   “Do you want to see me come all over myself?” he panted.
“But you’re not,” Harry moved to stand in front of Draco.  “You may not have these memories, but you are this man,” he insisted.  “We can be happy again.  You just have to try . . .”  Harry lifted his hand and traced it along Draco’s cheek, “Please try, Draco.”  Harry felt Draco tense up, so he dropped his hand and moved away.
“Merlin, Blaise!  What is so damned important?” Draco’s voice rang over the room as he, Pansy and Blaise emerged from the corridor leading to the boys’ dormitories.
Harry risked opening his eyes.  Draco was lying next to him propped up on one elbow.  His smirk widened when he noticed Harry was looking at him.  “Maybe next time you should stick to Butterbeer?” Draco chuckled.
Draco was released from St. Mungos the next day, but he flatly refused to return to Grimmauld place with Harry.  Narcissa had decided to take a suite at the Wailing Wraith, in Diagon Ally, and have Draco stay with her.  She and Harry both had high hopes that Draco’s memories would return to him naturally.  Draco was behaving just like the teenager his memory believed him to be, alternately pouting and acting stroppy.
Oh, fuck!  This felt good!  He squeezed just right as he moved his hand along his shaft.  Another small moan broke free.  He needed this so badly.  He wanted to speed up, but he kept his hand motions slow, not wanting to jostle the bed.  His thumb swept over the head and pushed around the wet stickiness that was leaking there.  Fuckfuckfuck!
Needing desperately to fuck his husband, in one swift move, Harry flipped them both over.  Now able to use the leverage of his body weight, Harry pushed Draco’s legs up to rest on his shoulders and thrust roughly into him, setting a rapid pace.  Draco responded by wrapping his arms tightly around Harry.  “Yes, yes, oh fuck, yes!” Draco called out as he came.  As the muscles in his ass clenched repeatedly around Harry’s prick, it triggered Harry’s own orgasm.  They rocked and shuddered together for a few moments before Harry gently pulled his cock free and lowered Draco’s legs.  He waved his hand cleaning their sticky bodies, and pulled the blankets back over them as Draco settled against his side once more.
Draco hurried to the library, eager to send whoever it was away and get busy researching ways to get back to Harry. He faltered at the entrance and stopped entirely when he saw who was there. “Potter!” he gasped out.
“Harry!” he gasped out. “He stayed… I need to get back… I can’t…” Draco turned to blindly walk back into the Veil but Granger and Weasley pulled him back.
Harry used their joined hands to tug Draco closer until he was leaning against him. In one synchronized movement, Draco tilted his chin and Harry lowered his mouth—and then they were exchanging the softest kisses. Lips brushing, parting, and meeting again. Harry let go of Draco’s hand and used both his arms to drag Draco even closer, one hand wrapping around his waist and resting possessively on Draco’s hip, and the other threading through Draco’s hair. Draco’s own hands lifted unconsciously to tangle in Harry’s inky locks and their kisses deepened. When they paused for breath, Harry buried his face against Draco and sprinkled his neck with more kisses.
“Dying?” Draco scoffed. “You haven’t died Potter! I think I would have heard about it if The Savior of the Wizarding World had died.”
Harry had seen some of these changes in Malfoy firsthand.  There was a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher this year.  Thaddeus Thropwaite had come from Ilvermorny to teach at Hogwarts.  Professor Thropwaite had decided that he would assign partners for the entire year and, of course, Harry had been paired with Malfoy.  It hadn’t been as painful as he had expected.  For one thing, Malfoy hardly ever spoke to him.  No insults, no cutting remarks, and no sarcastic songs.  When they did have to speak for class, he was polite and stayed focused on the lesson at hand.  Harry slowly started to relax around him, and was beginning to appreciate his intelligence.  It nearly rivaled Hermione’s.  But just as Harry had started to settle comfortably into the school year, weird things had started to happen that Harry could find no explanation for.
He moved back into the main room and was arrested by the sight that greeted him.  Draco was sitting stiffly on the couch with a sleeping Al held in his arms.  This!  This was what he had pictured for so long!  His heart ached afresh seeing his husband and daughter together.
“Apparently the curse was set to trigger at the death of Mr. Malfoy senior. When he succumbed in Azkaban last month, the curse was set in motion.” The Healer threw worried glances in Draco’s direction, shifting away slightly.
She opened her mouth to give him what Draco was sure was a scathing reply, but Potter stopped her with a hand on her arm. “That’s not helping Hermione.” He turned then to Draco. “Maybe there is something that didn’t belong to him, but he used? Maybe there is something like that?”
Draco’s fingers joined Harry’s tracing over his cock.  Harry moaned and thrust his hips up some more.  Draco’s hand brushed away Harry’s fingers and his hand tentatively closed around Harry prick.  “Please,” he whispered, and Draco’s fingers tightened in response.  “Oh, God!  Yes, don’t stop!” Harry couldn’t stop himself from thrusting up into Draco’s tight grip.  “Please, please,” he begged mindlessly.
Harry paused to place his wand on the dresser and then removed his shirt.  “Someone told me I was overdressed.  Thought I would take care of that,” he teased.
Draco pulled away, and turned his back on Harry, “I don’t remember any of that.”  He leaned against the mantle and looked down at the carpet.  “I can’t imagine it.  It’s like you are talking about an entirely different person.”
Draco’s face turned bright red and he turned and started to rush from the room.  Harry swiftly moved to block him and grabbed his arm.  “No, you need to stay here and talk to me!” Harry demanded.
The one guaranteed daily contact he did have with Draco was thanks to Hilly.  On her first day with them, she insisted on setting the dining room table formally for dinner.  After she had gone to so much trouble, neither man had the heart to disappoint her so they sat down to eat together.  They had continued this every day, surprisingly even on her days off.  Some days all that kept Harry going was the thought that he would have Draco to himself for that hour at dinner.  Their conversations we casual and superficial, but it was better than the rest of the day when Draco avoided Harry.
Harry turned and walked over to a small couch, tugging Draco along with him. He sat and pulled Draco down next to him. “I don’t have to go back,” he stated quietly.
“Nothing.  Well, the blue light went away and I tried to cast the Detection Spell a few times, but nothing happened,” Harry said defensively.
“Step back,” the professor ordered and both boys moved back.  Thropwaite cast a different spell on the hairbrush but nothing visible happened.  “That is curious,” he mumbled to himself.  “Alright, students,” Thropwaite said in a loud voice.  “I think that is enough for today.  We will continue tomorrow.  Class dismissed.”  He levitated the brush back up to the front of the room.
“Don’t.  Stop.  Touching.  Your.  Dick!”  Malfoy whispered.  Harry shuddered, as it all hit him.  Malfoy knew he was wanking, and he wanted Harry to keep doing it while he was right there.  Malfoy rested his forehead against Harry’s neck and moaned.  Harry could feel the bed moving behind him.
When he was finished he decided to head up to his room for a nap. Being exhausted from staying up all night was not an optimal condition in which to confront the Dark Lord, dead or not. Once he was refreshed he would go forward with this desperate plan.
Before Harry could get his brain working and respond in kind, the kiss was over and Malfoy had retreated to his side of the circle.  Malfoy flashed a smug smile in Blaise’s direction, and then the game continued.  Harry spent the remainder of the game in a daze.  He couldn’t have said what happened or even what questions he himself had answered.  That night in his bed, he replayed the kiss over and over in his head trying to figure out why it had happened and what it meant.
“She seems to really like that,” Draco said as he came and sat on the edge of the couch, near to Harry but not touching.
Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed tightly for a minute.  “Time for the baby,” she said after taking a deep breath.  “My water’s broken, and I’m having some contractions.”  She looked up at Harry and smiled, “Your baby’s coming, Harry!”
Harry realized that the temperature must have dropped and he knew that his floor was cold.  “Here.  Get in, you’re freezing,” Harry quickly scooted over to the middle of the bed and pulled back the covers invitingly.  When Draco hesitated, Harry encouraged, “Come on, before the sheets get cold.”
Now it was early Sunday morning.  The window was filled with the grey light of dawn.  Draco was still asleep.  He was facing Harry, his right arm slung around Harry’s waist and their legs tangled together.  He looked so breathtakingly beautiful that it made Harry’s chest ache.  His pale lashes lay on his cheeks.  His pink lips were parted and slightly chapped.  His straight and slightly pointy nose fit the sharp lines of his jaw and cheekbones.  All of it put together, captivated Harry.
“I think Dra . . . uh, Malfoy is the one who will mind, Pansy,” Harry challenged.  But even before he had finished talking, Harry could see Malfoy crawling across the circle towards him, a determined expression on his face.  Before he knew it Malfoy was in front of him, his grey eyes piercing Harry’s.
“Well if they’re in Azkaban it will be even easier to…” Potter’s voice trailed off because Draco started shaking his head while he was still talking.
“You daft man,” Draco murmured before pressing his lips against Harry’s.  He brushed them back and forth against Harry’s mouth, and then his tongue swept out and started tracing along the seam of Harry’s lips.
“I’m talking about the man who was moaning and crying out my name.  The man who was pushing himself onto my fingers and begging me to make him come!” Harry argued.  Harry swiped angrily at his eyes that were filling with tears again.
Harry tried to sit up from where he was slouching on Malfoy but when he started to fall the other way, Malfoy grabbed his shirt and yanked him back upright.  “What . . . uh, what did you want?”
“Dilly, can you fetch me my father’s walking stick? It should be in his study,” Draco requested. When the elf still stood there smiling, not popping away, Draco asked, “Is something wrong?”
Draco, who had been looking away during Ron’s tale, now pinned him with his steely gaze.  “Truth,” he answered through gritted teeth.
“Oh fuck, Harry!  Please!” Draco begged.  He tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair and tried to pull him forward.  Harry resisted the pull and toyed with his slit, flicking the tip of his tongue inside.  “Aah aah aah!” Draco wailed.
“No, not about that.  I know you lost your memory.  But I don’t believe I’m talking about an entirely different person,” Harry insisted.
Draco threw his arm across his eyes in a pitiful attempt to hide.  “Nothing changed, Harry,” he huffed.  “I always wanted to stay.”
He quickly peeked into Al’s room and saw that she was sleeping in her crib and Hilly was napping in the rocking chair.  Harry spent another minute smiling fondly at the two of them before he raced down the stairs.  He went directly to the safe in the study, extracting something and placing it in his pocket. Then he continued his mad dash down the stairs and outside to the back garden.
Harry relaxed into the chair and grinned at Draco, this was fun.  “Yeah, my stuff was too gross.  This shirt though, it feels amazing,” Harry emphasized his last words by stroking his hand down his chest.  It didn’t seem possible, but Draco stiffened up even more, at that display.  Harry looked around, “Where is Narcissa?”
They had been at this for six hours already and still, they had no clear plan on how they would travel to the underworld, confront Voldemort and survive the whole experience. Currently, Granger and Potter were having a furious hushed conversation across the room. Draco didn’t know what they were talking about but he could surmise it from the number of hand gestures and amount of finger-wagging that Granger was using. She had arrived that morning alongside Potter, a stoic expression on her face. Her face brightened only briefly when she had entered the immense bookcase-lined room that was the Malfoy library.
Draco just glared at Neville for a good long minute.  Draco’s voice when he finally spoke was dark and full of anger, “Yes.”
It was Ron who spoke up, “When we finally broke through the trap, it set off a secondary curse and the wall and ceiling fell down on you.  We had to dig you out of the rubble before we could apparate you here.”
Dumbledore continued, “We want you to try and go through your day as normally as possible.”  The twin snorts that came from the boys in front of him didn’t stop him. “Mr. Weasley and Professor Thropwaite will be working on a solution.  We will keep you apprised of progress.  In the meantime, try and make the best of things.”  He sent them both a benign smile that looked out of place.  “Do either of you have any questions?”  Harry and Malfoy both shook their heads no.  “All right then, off to class with you both,” Dumbledore dismissed them.
“It is being the only way.” She folded her arms across her chest defiantly. She produced an ancient-looking book from her right pocket. “Harry Potter will be needing this.”
At Ron’s words, Harry’s arms tightened reflexively around Draco who stiffened in his embrace.  “Draco . . . I . . .” Harry began.
They lay quietly together for a few minutes before Harry had a sudden inspiration, pulled away and sat up quickly.  “Draco!  Dress nicely and meet me in the back garden in thirty minutes!”  Harry hopped out of bed and started moving toward the attached bath.
“About that, Potter.  You weren’t serious.  We can’t possibly live together,” Draco frowned and added another furious hiss.
Harry moved through the doorway, bringing himself very close to Draco.  He took a deep breath and clenched his hands to prevent himself from taking the other man into his arms and kissing him senseless.  No matter how strong his desire, he knew Draco would probably just hex him if he tried that.  Instead, when he drew parallel to him, he leaned toward him and whispered, “It’s good to see you Draco.”  Without waiting for a response, Harry continued into the spacious room and toward Narcissa, whom he spotted standing over by the windows.
“Voldemort?” Potter questioned, making Draco flinch. “But… how could he…” Puzzlement and then anger flashed across Potter’s face. Potter yanked at Draco’s hair and forced him to face him again. “Draco Malfoy?! Were you fucking trying to summon fucking Voldemort?!” Potter’s voice boomed in Draco’s ears. “Not even you could be that stupid?!”
Potter let go of Draco abruptly and he stumbled for a moment before catching and steadying himself. “I don’t… there’s not… I mean…” Potter scrubbed his hands through his hair, stirring up the messy black strands. “What am I supposed to do about it?” He looked rapidly from Draco to Dilly and back again.
Draco moved their hands so that he was now holding both of Harry’s wrists with one hand, still pinned against the wall.  He took his free hand and gently held Harry’s jaw, tilting his head so Harry was once again looking him in the eyes.  “I’m going to make you come now.” Draco’s voice was low, and his words made Harry’s dick twitch.  He slowly dropped his hand from Harry’s face. Draco stepped back and trailed his hand down his chest pausing to pinch at Harry’s nipple.  Then Draco moved lower, softly dragging his nails across Harry’s stomach and down through his happy trail.
Draco’s mother had made a miraculous recovery. The Healer couldn’t get over it. He was still regaling Draco with his convoluted theories of how he healed her, when Draco was once again summoned by Dilly. This time he was told that there was an important visitor in the library.
Harry turned caught up in the joy of the moment and leaned forward to press their lips together.  He felt Draco stiffen for a moment before relaxing and open his mouth to him.  Harry cupped the back of Draco’s head with his free hand and slid his tongue in.  Al squirmed as if wanting her fathers’ attention all back on her, and they broke the kiss with a gasp.
“You can get another house elf,” Draco looked at Harry critically, as his eyes swept over the disaster of a living room.
The house elf was arranged for with surprisingly little fuss.  His assistant had known just who to contact, and it was all arranged that their new house elf, Hilly, would arrive tomorrow morning.  She would be paid, have two days off a week, with paid vacation and sick leave.  Even Hermione could find no fault with this arrangement.
Malfoy interrupted the lengthening silence, “How in Merlin’s name did this happen in the first place?”
“Of course it is!”  Malfoy took another long drink and then stared down at his hands. “It’s my fault though.  I should have objected.  Made Thropplepuff change it.  Demanded to be partners with anyone but, Potter.”  He took another long drink and then passed it back to Harry.  “But I was weak.”
Harry gathered him up in his arms and pulled him into a tight hug.  “You need to let go, Draco, and trust me.  Trust me not to hurt you,” Harry whispered in his ear.  Draco’s arms came around him.  His hands bunched up the soft cotton of Harry’s t-shirt and he held him tightly.
“Calm down gentlemen,” Dumbledore said as he moved toward them.  “Can you recount to me what happened?”
Don’t look at Draco, don’t look at Draco!  Harry tightened his jaw and pressed his hands into his thighs.  “Er . . . ah, well . . . I don’t, or I mean . . .” Harry took a deep breath.  There was no way out of this.  “Yes,” he gave in and told the truth.  Harry cleared his throat. “Uh . . . Neville, truth or dare?”
He started by unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, placing tantalizing kisses on every inch of skin as it was revealed.  When his shirt was all the way open, Harry went back to his nipples, licking and sucking at them until they were hardened red nubs.  Then he turned his cheek so that his evening stubble was brushing against them causing Draco to cry out and rock his hips some more.  Harry lifted his head and watched Draco squirm beneath him.
Harry pulled his wand and closed the bed hangings, warding them shut and put up Silencing Charms.  Then he stuffed the wand under his pillow and turned back to Draco.  “Come here,” he said, pulling Draco into his arms.  He fit perfectly.  The weight of his body pressed Harry’s into the mattress.  Draco propped himself up on his elbows so he could look into Harry’s eyes.  Harry ran his hands over Draco’s shoulders and back, reveling in his ability to touch Draco wherever he wanted.  “I love you.” Harry smiled up at Draco.
“You can remember our sixth year, correct?”  At Draco’s nod, Harry continued, “Well . . . my Draco told me about some very vivid fantasies that he had during his fifth and sixth years.”  Draco did look at Harry then, his panicked grey eyes going wide.  He renewed his efforts to move away from Harry, but Harry couldn’t let this opportunity pass.  “And I was featured in those fantasies,” Harry whispered, bringing his lips next to Draco’s ear.  “So . . . I think you can imagine it,” Harry’s whisper turned into a low growl.  He kissed along Draco’s jaw and heard his breath hitch.  “I think you’re just scared,” he murmured.  Harry moved one hand to cup Draco’s cheek as he brought their lips together in a gentle kiss.
“Enough!” Dumbledore said firmly.  “Mr. Malfoy, what happened when you cast the Curse Detection Spell?”
Harry lost track of his daughter as she was passed around among family members.  He was standing on the edge of the group when he saw Teddy over by himself.  Harry went to give his godson a hug, but the boy stiffened up.  “What’s wrong, Teddy?  You feeling ok?” Harry asked.
“Did you like touching me?  Did you like watching me come?” Harry moved closer as he spoke, so he could feel Draco’s body heat and his leg was pressed alongside the other man’s.
He went straight to the potions floor, the one where Draco normally worked.  He grabbed the first Mediwitch he saw.  “Cassie, where’s Draco?  Where do they have him?” he asked impatiently.
“Yes!  Oh, please!  Yes, yes,” Draco started babbling as he writhed beneath Harry.  Without lifting his mouth, Harry pulled Draco’s pajamas down and off his legs.  He wrapped one hand around Draco’s prick, stroking in time with his mouth and with his other hand he pushed Draco’s legs apart making room for himself between them.  He sucked Draco’s cock down until he felt it touch the back of his throat, then he sucked harder as he pulled off.
“This isn’t right!  Try it again,” Harry complained.  Malfoy said the spell again but there was no change and the blue light remained covering them.  They had gained the professor’s attention and Harry could see he was bustling his way over to them.  Wanting to solve this before they got chewed out by the teacher, Harry acted quickly.  “Here let me try,” he said grabbing Malfoy’s wrist to get his wand.
“Can Hilly be holding the Little Miss?” Hilly asked, her body leaning forward toward the baby and her ears twitching.
Draco shifted uneasily before sitting back down on the settee.  He blew out a breath and Harry notice that it ruffled his bangs.  Draco looked down at his hands as began to speak.  “Mother has told me that you . . .” Draco took a deep breath before he continued, “that you defeated the Dark Lord.”  Draco looked up into Harry’s eyes, “That was a good thing.”
The nurse came over and cast a cleaning charm on Atria Lily.  She helped him put her in a nappy and dress her in a baby gown.  Then he wrapped her up in another soft blanket.
Draco put his other hand down, bracketing Harry’s head and resting all of his weight.  He pushed his tongue into Harry’s mouth, tongues sliding and lips clinging as their kiss went on and on.
“Oh, God!  I’m sorry!” Hermione covered her face with her hands.  She pulled her hands away and gave Harry a stricken look, “Harry …”
He would not fail her, he was not his father. Draco returned to the library and retrieved the spell he had copied. He picked it up, refusing to even look at the evil book where he had found it. He folded the parchment and put it in his pocket before heading down to the dungeons.
Early morning light filtered through the curtains and fell on the pale hair of the man lying beside him.  Harry had been released yesterday, after a week-long stay at St Mungo’s, and he was finally back in his own bed.  The man in his bed was a surprise though.  He had been alone when he had fallen asleep.  Draco must have come and joined him in the middle of the night.
“We think we were able to repair all the damage, but it is going to take some time to know for sure.  Mr. Potter’s body will have a lot of work to do too,” Wilcox intoned, talking right over another muttered “Potter-Malfoy”.  “Are you able to speak, Mr. Potter?” he turned and asked Harry.
“How about we do something fun tomorrow?  I’m sure I can get Molly to watch Al,” Harry smiled, warming up to his impulsive idea.  “We can go flying.”
Every surface in his home (floors, chairs, tables, and beds) was covered with dirty clothes, both his and the baby’s, dirty dishes, half eaten food, cups of unfinished tea, and dirty baby bottles.  His shirt had stains from formula, spit-up, and at least three of his meals.  He couldn’t remember the last time he had showered.  His hair was so dirty and lank it was actually lying flat.  And he was so ripe not even cleaning charms were helping anymore.
“Harry, what the fuck?  Get . . .” Malfoy put up his hands to push Harry away and they landed on Harry’s bare chest.  Malfoy froze with his mouth open and his hands holding onto Harry.
Now, despite recent history seeming to indicate the opposite, Harry tried to be a laid back kind of guy.  You don’t bother me and I won’t bother you.  But on the question of sexuality, Harry was quite passionate.  He had been wrestling with his own sexual identity, for the last few months.  And he firmly believed no one had the right to out anyone else.  And that was what he said.  Before Blaise could utter a single syllable Harry interjected, “That’s not OK!  What kind of a question is that?  You can’t make someone out themselves, Michael!  Blaise you do not have to answer that.”
As the sunlight slanted across his closed eyelids, pain throbbed in his head and Harry felt like something had crawled into his mouth and died.  “Good morning, Boy Who Lived!” shards of Draco’s voice sliced into his head.  Harry moaned as quietly as he could and tried to pull his pillow over his head.  “Here,” Draco was shouting at Harry again, as he thrust a glass bottle into his hand.  “Drink that.”
Harry moved until he was standing directly in front of Draco.  He reached out and grabbed hold of Draco’s wrist and felt the pulse fluttering there.  “It’s true though. You did.  And then when I regained my memory, I pretended too.”  Harry looked into the mists of Draco’s eyes and licked his suddenly dry lips.  He took a deep breath, trying to calm his own racing heart.  “Until suddenly, we weren’t pretending anymore . . . we wanted it to be real.”  Harry’s body swayed, leaning toward the man he loved more than anything.
The shower felt so lovely he considered staying in it for a few hours, but he forced himself to get out after he had washed his hair three times and lathered up his body four times!  He knew he needed to go back in and face the fallout from his previous declaration.  He meant it though, he was determined that Draco was going to help him and to be a father to their daughter.
“Just forget it.” Draco turned away.  “Breakfast is soon and we need to get going.”  He slid from the bed, assuming that Harry would follow.
There were five bedrooms and a shared hall bathroom in the boys’ hallway.  Harry was rooming with Blaise and Ernie.  Ron was in with Theo and Terry.  Neville had been placed in with Draco and Michael.  Seamus, Anthony and Justin were together, and Dean and Wayne were lucky enough to only have two in their room.
After they left Dumbledore’s office, Harry had tried one more time to talk, but Draco had brushed him off and had disappeared for the rest of the day.  Harry hadn’t wanted to return to the dorm and face the well-meaning questions from his friends. So he spent the rest of the day in the Owlry with Hedwig.  After an hour he hardly noticed the smell anymore.
“We should go too,” Hermione said, “We kinda dumped the kids at George and Angelina’s when we got the news you were awake.  We’ll be back tomorrow.”  She leaned over and gave him a gentle kiss on his cheek.  Ron grabbed his hand and gave it a hard squeeze, and then they were also gone.
“Oi!  Harry!  Come on, get out of that bloody bed!  You need to go.  Now!” impatience rang through Ron’s voice.
Harry lay on his side and examined Draco.  He was lying on his side too, facing Harry.  His face looked so much younger in his sleep, relaxed and untroubled.  His eyelashes fanned against his cheeks and his lips were slightly parted.  He had the faintest blond stubble on his cheeks.
