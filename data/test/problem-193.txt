"Quite a convenient time to have your realisation. No matter, Potter," Draco said, still sounding very cold. He stood up, adjusting his folded suit over his arm. "You understand I'm under just as much necessity as you."
Potter's skin was smooth there, in his Dreams, just as Draco's had been, the two of them forever unmarred by the terrible things that had happened here, and his pain and empathy is a violent and alive rush through the nerves of his body. Awakening.
They all seemed like they didn't know what to say. They all said similar things. Things like,
But then Draco smiled, mild. "And I you."
"Salazar," Draco huffed, a little to himself. Then to Harry, "no, Potter, this must be the most unforgivable thing you've ever done, awakening me from my wonderful dreams of becoming a world-renowned potioneer winning his third ever award."
"Nah, mate," Ron said, throwing him a glance, slightly concerned. "Sit down. We're almost done here anyway, and I'm guessing after whatever happened with Malfoy, you need a breather."
"What of your girl Weasley? Ginevra?"
There is a memory trying to make its way into his mind, and he's been trying not to let it in, but now Potter isn't here and it slips through the worn and cracked barricade holding it back. And it grows, from a faded, muffled thing into a bright and clear memory that never happened. Harry, smiling, absently pulling Draco's coat closer around his shoulders. Raising himself on the ends of his trainers to kiss him. Potter, sitting there across the booth from him in it, arms atop the table as he talked, grinned, laughed.
Malfoy shook his head, as if to brush it off. "It's—I'm afraid it can't be more than a one-time thing."
Hermione doesn't look quite like she agrees, but she doesn't say anything to that.
Neville had written in his letters.
They stare at each other for a long moment, and then Draco's mouth twitches, and a second later, they're both laughing, Draco's grey eyes crinkling and bright, the folds of his cheeks dipping with it all.
Draco blinks, and then huffs, mildly awed. "Wandless magic."
. What's he got on you to make you act like you actually give a damn about him?"
* * *
"For what it's worth, Potter," Malfoy had said quietly. "I'm glad you chose life. I know it hasn't been the best one, but you deserve to live long enough to make it better."
"I don't feel anything for you."
The bell rang soon, signalling the end of their class. Harry glanced over at Malfoy, who was quickly gathering up the contents of his satchel and shoving them in. He seemed to be in a bit of a hurry.
Draco is standing so close to him, the tips of their shoes inches apart. His movements were precise, practiced. Harry can't find it in himself to stop him, stilled by the way his heart's fluttering into his gut, by how close Draco's face is to his, slightly bowed as his hands work. It feels very different from when Ron does it for him.
A wrinkle on the sheets draws in all the focus of his gaze.
Pansy snorts. "It's not as if you'd have taken it well, if I
He doesn't realise what he's done until the box is sideways on the floor, and there's an unsteady line of ink staining the floor and some of the letters strewn about all over. There's the sound of an angry cry still ringing in his mind, his own. His hand is trembling, curling into a fist atop the desk.
. The thought comes out of nowhere. "No, just... like you..." He fumbles with words for a few seconds, finally settles on, "...feel good."
"But I can also see you're sincere, and you're serious about him," Blaise says. He shrugs, leaning back on the sofa, elbow on the arm. "Let's be honest, anybody else would have turned tail and ran in your place, not pined after him for years. And everything Draco's told me about you — besides, there was a lot of complicated shite going on before with you two. Maybe now that there's a lot less of that... Pans, she'll come around once she sees that too. She's just never really been able to move past that night when it comes to Draco. I didn't either, for a long time. Not saying that was your fault, but...there's this fear that she can't shake off, since she's learned about those dreams, and you being tied to it. You know?"
On some days, Draco would come in for a drink while Harry was painting in the living room, and he would ask him about it in that same overly casual and borderline disinterested way he did. But he asked, so Harry showed him — Molly and Arthur Weasley huddled together, smiling. Fred and George. A green forest from the perspective of standing upon a hill, a shimmery blue line of a river running through the middle.
is the word that comes to Harry's mind. But
It was sickening to look at, both of them in conflicting ways, and he had only a few seconds of black cloaks in masks and bloody running water in a bathroom before Malfoy had shoved him down onto the bed, hand flat on his chest as he climbed over on top of him, bending over him with his mouth at his neck and a hand beside his head.
At first, Harry doesn't want to give it a name, or an explanation. He's afraid of what he will learn if he tries to work that out. He knows he likes Draco a little too much, and he thinks about him more than anyone he's ever thought about. But it doesn't
"They—" His voice dies instantly, cracked and hoarse and lacking air, as if someone has snatched it away from him.
Draco takes that in stride with a blank stare at nothing, and then a shake of his head. "Alright then.
Harry felt somewhat embarrassed, even as he knew that was true, that it was new, either of them taking any sort of interest in each other's lives.
"Who's going to save your arse on that field when you'll have to face spiders though?" Harry said, a while after, a bit drunker.
At night, whenever Harry got home, he went up first thing to see him, and often found him fallen asleep with a book on his chest and the lamp on
Harry stared at him, giving him his best
"Something to do with Malfoy?" she then says. "I know he was your friend, and then I guess something happened and he left, and you've just been gone ever since."
Harry liked Elias. He liked how they meshed together, how comfortable it was, how effortless it was to talk to him and laugh with him, and when he kissed Harry against the wall beside his apartment room, it was as easy as everything else was with him.
There is one thing, only, that comes to mind, that he never believed Potter would ever know, could never know. He tells himself it cannot possibly be that.
"I…" Harry says, exhales a shuddering breath. "I'm sorry."
Harry swallowed, eyes roving over his steady, fronded silver gaze, fixed on his own, trying not to look at that unmoving mouth. His heart was kicking up a storm, an incomprehensible din, was falling to his feet. His voice came a little forced, strained, "You said it yourself. We don't need to be in love. We just need to be good to each other."
Let Harry kiss him chastely on the lips.
In the haze of dawn, Harry woke up to movement stirring up against his chest. He sobered up instant and wide-awake, his mind still full of everything that wasn't getting through to him. He pushed himself up quickly onto a shoulder as a hand moved back from Draco's belly, up onto his waist, trying to see him. He still had his eyes closed, brows furrowed. A moment later, he opened them, lit under the fade of sunrise, scarlet-circled. He turned a little in the circle of his arms, finding Harry's own eyes.
Conversation was loud and comfortable, full of stories that either took place in rapt silence, or in a chaos, adding details over each other, one taking over to tell their perspective, laughter rising high in the middle, at the end. Harry was throwing out his own ridiculous remarks every now and then into the collective, Ron having snorted so loud at one of them that he choked on his drink.
"You don't talk about it with me," Potter says, softly. "I mean, I'm… I'm glad you talk about it with anybody at all. I just—" His voice fades, but in it, he threads his fingers through Draco's, pulls it under his own cheek, seeming a bit softened by drowsiness. "You know. I'm here too."
There in the bathroom, he closed the door behind him, stared at the mirror in front of him, his own face staring back. He was slightly flushed. He breathed, in and out, swallowed and let his head fall back.
Draco's cheeks and nose are pink against the white frost of the world around them, but the rest of him—his grey woollen hat and his white-blond hair falling out of it—suits the winter well. The crisp-white snow falls soft and slow on him, catching in his lashes, his hat, his scarf. Landing on the black of his coat.
were okay, but nothing was making sense anymore. This curse didn't make sense, and why this had happened didn't make sense, and no Healer or Cursebreaker could say much about anything when it came to curses like these, when everything was so ambiguous, and so Harry was left with a harrowing confusion and no explanation and nothing to tell Draco except that —
"A bit," Harry says, scribbling over his parchment, pausing, crossing out an accidentally repeated word. "Why?"
"Draco! What—" Harry draws back, taking a good look at his face, drinking his boyfriend in in his faded muggle jeans and forest-green sweater, the folded collar of his white shirt peeking out. "You're here. What are you doing here?"
On another moment, there was Draco, with Hermione on one side of him, and Luna leaning her head on his shoulder, Ginny leaning into her. He was showing the three of them through the camera, which did have Harry feeling very strange and a little like he wanted to snatch it off his hands. He kept himself in check, busied with helping Molly set the table alongside George and Ron.
Draco didn't freeze, or pull away, or get mad the way Harry expected him to. He just stayed quiet, not looking at Harry, but he also didn't withdraw his hand, so that was a sign of hope that maybe he would be somewhat open to what Harry said.
He remembered his cousin's last words to him, saying,
"Don't you lot think this is strange?" Harry asked, closely eyeing
He found Draco in the bathroom, curled up against the wall, sweaty and tensed and trembling. His neck was taut with it, his breaths shaky and erratic. The bathroom smelled sick.
Draco has both his arms atop one another, leaning on the railing. "I think Slytherin's beating you Gryffindor wankers just fine without me."
Harry smiled, elbows atop the table, shoulders a little low and rounded as he held the camera. The screen blurred, focused again on Draco's face, on that slight raise of his brow. The morning light, soft and faded, fell on him through the large-panelled café window. "Knut for your thoughts?"
Malfoy faltered in his movements, pausing for only a moment, and then began to clink and clunk through glasses and bottles, a little more careful and pointed, as if too aware of himself. He found something, rotated the bottle to read the label, and then poured it out, his elbow flexed laterally as he measured the drink. Harry sat down, finally, hesitantly, waiting.
In the silence that follows, Draco thinks of his father and Severus, the absence of them that he can no longer keep at a distance from a hospital bed, hollow and dissociated and pretending they were still out there, alive and well. His father's vacant study room, and the living room where he'd sit in front of the fireplace and drink his scotch, and the too large bed where his mother sleeps alone. He thinks of Severus' absence leaving the front of the Potions' class empty, the desk in the Head of Slytherin's office, his house where Draco had often Flooed over to for tutoring as a boy.
Malfoy was holding the door open for him.
Harry sighed. "Sorry. I just don't like to think about it." Draco handed him the bottle again.
"Fifty to
"Don't cry, Potter," Draco mumbled. His eyes were so sunken, scarlet under the white daylights through the window. "You don't look so good-looking when you do."
but I would not call it fair when my son sought
Harry spent the entire day on edge as always, waiting for the contented hum to whirr away into the same old unease. He waited for people to come in while reading, half-distracted by distorted images of last night, trying to ignore every thought of it. Eventually he almost forgot about being on edge, waiting for the curse to act up, and only fully realized at the end of the day that the tangle of magic at his core was still quiet, still content.
* * *
They're all over him. He covered himself, and all of a terrible past he no longer remembered, with everything good, everything that meant something to him: the people he loved, anything he liked. There were the flowers that reminded him of his mother's name around his Dark Mark. The half-moon, after Luna, on his other arm. A snake for Blaise. Intricate patterns and designs chosen by Pansy. The constellation of Draco.
"I suppose he didn't want to be with me just as much as I didn't want to be with him," Harry said.
"Right, yes. Time for
he wanted to say. He wanted to give whatever excuse he could not to.
"Can't we just do this part ourselves?" Harry asked, quiet and rough.
Draco remembers it only in a distant way, the way it felt, like phantoms. Mostly, it's only at an intellectual level that he can speak of it, can only remember the thoughts he thought if he tries hard enough.
And then he walks away, waving a hand at him over his shoulder.
Malfoy had shrugged, arms crossed over his chest, adamant about getting his way. Harry mostly let him win that one after, if only to avoid similar conversation.
Draco glanced at him. "Nothing. I was just thinking about it." His throat convulsed. He looked down, at the top of Teddy's head, who was nestling his hair back against Draco's chest, trying to see him. He flicked a small smile down at him.
They finally looked away from each other, uncomfortable.
"Tea would be fine, thank you."
It was a long while later that he finally straightened, with a sharp inhale, running both hands down his face. He stood up quickly, moving to his side of the bed on his feet so as to not jostle the mattress and wake Malfoy. He climbed up and shifted under his own covers.
He's wiping snow over Harry's cheek, one gloved hand curled into the snow beside Harry's head, leaning over him, and he is so beautiful. Exhilarated and wild like this, joyful. And Harry is struck with the absolute clarity of the thought, how loud it is, and by the tumble of emotions in his gut, softening low and deep — his heart, full to an ache in his throat again, an unsteady and slow pulse.
"Would you really have done this for eighteen years more?"
Harry doesn't try to seek Draco out, to bridge this strange gap between them. He only catches sight of him from a distance, sometimes when Draco isn't looking, sometimes right when he is, and they are both left floundering, circling around each other, neither of them approaching the other out of their own reasons.
"Is there a problem?" Draco asks, an insouciant near-drawl. He doubts it's really all too bothersome. It's dark enough, isn't it, and Longbottom's thick curtains block out much of the light. Draco keeps his own open, because he does not like the way they close him in.
Through dinner, Harry was sitting beside Draco, holding his hand under the table. He could feel the cool metal of Draco's ring on his skin. Half-way through listening to Arthur's story about the accidental animation of a rubber goose that turned out horrifically aggressive, Harry found himself distracted by their hands, and the gleam of silver amidst the tangle. While Draco was still listening to the story, Harry pulled their hands up and gently kissed the ring.
you, so of course he'll do everything he can to save you."
Hermione grinned, taking his arms and pulling him in towards her and clasping her arms around his neck, saying, "Well, you should've been a moment faster." They kissed chastely on the lips before he hugged her waist, laughing again into her shoulder.
"I love you too." She draws back from him, touches his cheek, lets it linger for a moment. Then she steps away, takes her broom off the wall. "Take care of yourself, yeah?"
Over the rest of the month, it became clear that Draco had no faith or hope in surviving at the end of this. He lived like he was dying. He quit his potions mastery classes. He had started to get all his financials in order, had arranged to write his will sometime in the future. He spent copious amounts of time with his mother and Andromeda and Teddy, wrote a lot of owls to Luna, and Harry tried not to let his heart grow heavy at the thought that Harry was not among these people, that he was, in fact, the last person Draco wanted to be around. He understood well why he wasn't.
, Harry was about to say.
Then the class starts talking to each other in a loud chorus as Draco loses all their attention. He awkwardly stands there now that nobody's listening.
Harry passed the time by making dinner, and then eating it, not having realised he'd finished until his spoon clinked against an empty plate. His mind had been stuck running through what had happened not ten minutes ago, the memory of Draco's arms around the nape of his neck, cradling his head. The warm breath of his murmur on Harry's mouth, saying,
“You really didn’t?” Harry asks without his eyes moving from the screen. He keeps his voice light and non-accusing, though maybe sometimes it still does sting to think about. What it led to. The years after. “You couldn’t imagine at all how he’d feel?”
And he can imagine him, sitting at the study desk in his dorm, writing all these letters he'll never send to somebody in a nonexistent world. To Harry.
Harry had stood upright in the midst of his malaise, tangled up in a need for relief still somewhat bearable as of yet, but was steadily overtaking his mind. Malfoy had stood up from his chair, apparently having noticed the state of him, had grabbed him by the arm the next second with a quick glance and a polite,
Another one happened in the middle of an impromptu ball party full of Narcissa's family friends, Harry forced to tag along as a precaution. He spent most of his time there drinking, bored out of his mind and letting Malfoy do all the talking. Apparently he was quite good at it when it wasn't with Harry.
Their beverages and food came at that point. Harry had to stop the recording.
And then one day, it caught up.
. The cure is impossible for them, so they die."
Harry frowned. "Why should we? It's not like we have anything to talk about."
Potter's kiss tastes like warm wine, feels like home, pulling at the violent bubbling in the deepest pit of his stomach, heated and tender beneath his skin, from his spine to his cheeks to his scalp. It is a raw and cavernous hunger all the way to his bones, held together tight, by stitches, in the tremors of his body. Some part of him is certain that to allow the absolute depth of his feelings to slip through is to terrify Potter almost as much it terrifies himself.
an explosion of dark magic that had killed both parties as well as the rest of those in the room. Surely we will not be trying this?" The room was silent. Narcissa stroked back the side of Draco's hair, soothingly.  Hermione gripped Harry's hand tighter. "I understand that this is not...
It was a while after that Harry felt the tentative fingers over the back of his hand, in his lap. It was easy now, to turn his own palm up, let them slide into the spaces of his own. To hold it back, tightly, and hold it still even as it jittered up his arm. Neither of them moved, or spoke for a time.
Draco looks mildly intrigued. His mind seems to be turning, his eyes twitching to narrow for a split-second. He seems to have realized something. Harry suddenly regrets his decision when he considers that he might be thinking of Sixth Year. "And out of all the things you could do with it, you're using it to stalk after me of all people?"
Just then, they both jumped from the sudden and loud rapping at the door, an underlying muffled female voice furiously talking in a low voice—
He didn't want to think about it, had been trying not to, what would happen, when there would be no wireless playing in the mornings, and no violins in the evenings, and nobody on the right side of the bed — the thought of Draco —
He pushed off the doorframe. When Draco noticed him next to him, he stopped humming, but he flashed him a quick smirk, falling with the glance back at the tea, putting in the teabag into his mug.
"But… we're both blokes…" Harry tried to deflect.
"I am."
"I understand. I'll… I'll leave now. Thank you for your time, Narcissa."
There, Draco turned around into a small crossing of Harry's space, facing him, curling one arm around his neck, then the other. Harry's hands came up to touch his waist, an off-focus and dimmed vision fixated on grey eyes, a lovely face.
Harry hums, and then grins. "You being a cheat and a sore loser every time I won against you in the Quidditch cup? No, I suppose not."
"I think we should head back for now," Harry murmured.
It's a long while after, when the movement of his chest steadies and his body finally relaxes slightly, that Potter speaks again.
"That could have actually happened," Potter says, huffing, and there's a twitch at a corner of his lips, and Draco loves him. He loves him with a ferocity so painful it may as well just be pain all on its own.
It was an outdoor, autumn wedding, dry red leaves by trees and a cool breeze that played up Hermione's veil and dress full of pretty, silver embroidery, Ron's heavily decorated robes over a formal suit. It was as beautiful as the two of them were.
"Try," Pansy says. "You have to try, darling."
"What's that?" Sally asks.
"You must miss them a lot," Harry said softly, once the laughter died down, as they walked down the street together.
"I just loved him so much," Ginny whispers, presses the back of her fingers against her mouth to gather herself. "And it's so hard to forget anything now when he's..." Harry steps forward, his throat burning, wanting to hold her, but she shakes her head, stepping away. He stays where he is, arms falling back to his sides. When she finally regains composure, she swallows hard and straightens, looking him in the eye. "you loved him too."
For the first few days, there was no fighting, even if only because, in their lingering exhaustion and recuperating, they weren't talking beyond necessary. Still, Harry was waiting for the outburst.
Harry has become quite fascinated by the picture Scorpius paints of his father.
There is no answer. The endless silence overtakes the room once more.
"It's really not, you disastrous wanker. You're only too used to your incompetent ways." Draco lets him go, patting his chest as he turns around, waving him along with a hand over his shoulder. The warmth of it lingers on Harry's chest. "Come along now, before we become any later."
"I don't think it would have."
"I heard Draco's returned to England," Hermione says. They've all taken to calling Draco by his name over time, having picked it up from Harry.
And then he thinks of brilliant green eyes. He thinks of the ebony of wild, unruly curls. He thinks of glowing golden-brown skin. A faded, grey lightning scar. A quirk of a pink smile. He feels the foolishness and fragility of his own heart, the way it beats down into his gut.
Ginny's hands fold on her lap. Her red hair is getting in the way of her face. "I think I just came back because… I was afraid that I was making the wrong choice, and taking too long, and I'll regret not coming back to you before you stopped wanting me." She looks up at him. "I guess I'm sure now, that there's… this is it, then. Isn't it?"
It was taking too long to come into effect. Draco was leaning into his shoulder. Harry brushed a quivering hand down the nape of his neck, trying his hardest to keep himself calm. He had a tentative hold around Draco's waist.
"Sorry, I—" His voice is barely there when he speaks, hoarse, breaking off. He clears his throat, a line between his brows, not seeming to be able to look up from Draco's shoes, trying to say, "I was at Madam Aileen's and it, um—it took longer than I—"
"What about the whole — I dunno, pureblood, must-beget-an-heir thing? You probably had all that upended with this. The curse and all."
"Fine, then your were-Weasley should do."
"No!" Harry said quickly. "No. I mean… I don't mind. It's alright. You can come as—"
"I know," Harry said. He didn't know what else to say. "I'm sorry too. It must have hurt you a lot."
Draco kissed him, hard enough to bob his head back. His head was tilted slightly, half-lidded eyes lowered to meet Harry's.
"I have fruits," Harry says, lamely. He reaches into his basket and takes out an apple, holding it out to him. Draco cocks an eyebrow, lofty and cold. "It won't bite you now, will it, Malfoy? It's more likely to be the other way around."
They left when it was nearing nightfall. Andromeda did not insist for dinner, because by now everybody had the unspoken understanding that they couldn't stay long anywhere. Harry didn't know what came over him, only felt that he didn't want to go back home, but he looked to Draco outside the door as they were moving down the stairs together, said, "let's go out somewhere."
He remembered the mischievous smirk on Malfoy's face. Oh no. Oh, fuck no. Something was about to happen, wasn't it? Something bad and illegal and
Draco was moved back home that morning, spending most of the day tired and sleeping in his bed. Their bed. Harry held him close there too, the only thing he knew to do. The pillow that had always been between them was at their feet, bumping against Harry's ankle. Somewhere on the edge of sleep, he wondered if there was any space left anymore for all this distance between them.
The videos were just as mundane too, just Draco, humming along quietly to a song playing in a car driving them towards their hotel, not noticing the camera on Harry's lap, turned on him, half-hidden behind a hand. Just Draco, pulling at Harry or shaking his arm off-frame. Draco, talking, explaining history and facts, regaling Harry with his own stories and prior travel experiences. Draco, walking along the sidewalk, head dipping down slightly as he smirked at Harry's retelling of a very uncomfortable encounter with a starstruck receptionist. Draco, turning his face into the camera, his grin crinkling into his eyes as his mouth moved, the rays of the sun behind his head, shadowed by him.
"I know somebody hurt you," Pansy says. "I know something terrible happened to you. Blaise—"
"Thank you."
The glow of the light colors the room a faint yellow, the floorboard of his mother's room hard under his back. He can hear her breathing, the light sound of the currents of air moving in and out. Draco thinks she's sleeping, but it turns out soon that she isn't.
Harry shrugged, glancing away, mindlessly looking at the other patrons to avoid Malfoy's burning gaze.
Harry was drunk, and slow, his mind leaden with the alcohol in his system, and with his inhibitions loosened, it was the easiest thing to grab the pillow out of Draco's hands, throw it down at the foot of the bed instead. He scooted over across the distance between them and left an inch of space, and he folded a loose arm around Draco's middle.
Draco hummed, inquisitive. He appeared bemused. "Of course. Why wouldn't I be?" Harry eyed him, scrutinising, and he sighed. He mindlessly adjusted Harry's glasses on his face, sliding it straight, one-handed. "It's alright. I was only thinking how… strange it is, I suppose… that we won't be having anything like this. Isn't it strange?"
Harry froze at the same time Malfoy did.
Fake marriage proposals. Check.
Harry pushed up into a sitting position on the bed, feeling Draco watching him. He stretched his arms over his back to clutch at the back of his shirt, pulling it over his shoulders and head and off of his body. He tossed it aside on a chair in front of the desk.
That is when the strange feeling starts, low in his chest. "Tell me what?"
"Why?"
He searches for Hermione's name, who's being paired with Susan Bones.
* * *
But he couldn't do that. So he wanted to fix him into his mind instead, every fact and detail of him — he wanted to remember even years later what his voice sounded like, and what he laughed like. How he smiled, and stood, and moved, with all the grace and elegance effortlessly ingrained in his body. How he looked when he was losing himself in something. Like moments in motion stilled in paintings. Like moments in motion held tight in a box, that Harry can keep and carry around with him wherever he wanted, for as long as he wanted.
Just then, the waitress came in, asking if they were ready to order. In his haste of searching for the cheapest thing he could find, Harry ended up ordering something that he promptly decided might have been the last thing he would ever want to put it in his mouth by the sound of it. Malfoy's orders, while few, were shamelessly expensive, and Harry facepalmed so hard he could have broken his own glasses.
"Tell me a secret."
Harry huffs, looking ahead at the portrait on the wall across from them—a bizarrely dressed man standing in front of the mirror, fixing up his hair and making kissy noises at himself. "Well, can
"I miss you," Harry whispers into the coin, some nights. Only some nights.
Draco's cheeks tighten into a smile, just as terribly mad himself, over him. He kisses him again, kisses him long and deep and slow like he's making up for all the years worth of losses, skin heated, tender all over from his spine to his scalp.
Harry stilled. Sure. Why not him, he supposed. It wasn't as if he'd ever seen Malfoy date girls.
, and he was thinking about Ron and Hermione and Molly and Bill, and everybody else that wasn't here but loved him somewhere out there, and how nice it was to be surrounded by the certainty of the people that loved him, and how there was nobody being a certainty for Malfoy outside that door like there were for Harry.
Potter doesn't come back the next day, or the day after. Whenever Draco sees him around, he's avoiding his gaze, focusing too much on his tasks, Weasley and Granger shooting him bemused and worried glances every now and then and attempting at humour to cheer him up.
Shame and pride, that he thought he left behind in a hospital bed and a dream and a cellar, flares in him. "Pansy..."
"Come to dinner," Molly says. "Tell her that."
okay?"
"You do have a lot of blue in your wardrobe," Draco said, suddenly, as if he'd just thought of saying this.
kitchen table?" Malfoy laughed, ironic and wry, a sneer. "Hah! No, husband dear, this is
Harry could hardly hear himself in the bustle and noise, and it was hopeless to hope Malfoy would hear him either. Harry could hear many shouts of protest, and the person at the front of the line shot a seething glare at Malfoy cutting in rudely.
Ron and Hermione loved it, the two of them unable to look away from it.
"You know about that," Draco says, sounding a little bewildered.
"I didn't know I did. But you," Harry trails off, laughs with his gaze trying to meet the grey of Draco's eyes, a little tremulous with nerves and fear and the way his breath sticks high in his throat like an ache. Draco does look at him, then. "God, you." He swallows hard, gaze coming back to rest on Draco's mouth, hunger unfurling at the core of him, pulling tight.
"And your nose?"
He goes inside his room, stops at the desk. He pushes his trembling fists onto the top of the desk and closes his eyes, breathing through something festering sick in him, something in him rearing ugly and bitter and cold.
Harry didn't entirely understand what was happening, why a tremor seemed to run down his face and shoulders, but something in him seemed to break with Draco's hands featherlight and warm on Harry's face, running his fingers over it, frowning sleepy and confused. He was whispering,
They've always been together to the world, because nobody knew they ever broke up outside of those closest to Harry.
"Of course," Draco says with a nostalgic little smile, arm around the back of his neck, forehead to his. A little while after, he appears to remember something, and wastes no time telling of the time Peeves found Harry seemingly alone on the Astronomy Tower, after he threw the Invisibility Cloak over Draco, and he had to pretend he was just dancing with himself to the wireless in the dead of night. Peeves had cackled and made a mockery and a song out of his 'sad state of affairs'. Draco laughed madly at it then, drawing the cloak off himself after and folding over with the force of it, and he's laughing at it now, as he's telling it. Harry shakes his head at him, smiling anyhow.
“I’m really happy you got to have him back,” Hermione says, tentatively. “And that he’s alright now.”
His mother is frantic, hands all over his face and over his arms, her panicked breaths gasping and short as she screams for a house elf. Being on House Arrest and unable to cast a Patronus nowadays, there isn't much she can do to get him to St. Mungos when he stops the house-elves from Apparating him there.
Narcissa shakes her head, turning her head away to hide her face. "It's nothing." She lets go of one of his hands and wipes her fingers over her cheeks. "Don't worry, darling."
So from here on, he resolves to reduce his encounters with Draco, seeing as his company clearly isn't welcome. It wasn't at St. Mungos either, but that had been a far different matter than what it is now. On top of that, it's difficult to interact with Draco when he seems so terribly cross with him. He isn't even sure why he is, because he wasn't cross with him before their return to Hogwarts, was he?
He lurched forward, and he grabbed the other man by the face and turned it around and smushed his mouth against his in a hard, desperate kiss.
"Is that not where it nearly ended?"
"Harry, I've done
He was still numb and off-kilter, his heart strangely heavy and low in his chest, and it was only when Draco's smile faded into a faint furrow between his brows that Harry realised he must not look very good. Draco was sitting up, with a push onto his elbow, sliding off the couch to his feet. He was standing as he was pulling the book off himself and placing it aside on the table, moving over to him as he was asking, "Harry?"
"You're laughing in it," Harry said.
Harry huffed. "I didn't say that."
, he'll say.
The snow-blonde hair wasn't tousled, as if he couldn't be bothered to comb it. Rather, it was well-kempt as it used to be. There was something different in his silver eyes. He didn't look so haunted and lost and empty. They were still bruised with fatigue, like he hadn't been sleeping. Yet, they were alight, more alive than they had been since the first day of Eighth Year. Harry imagined it had a lot to do with getting to meet his mother.
After a while, "What was it like?" she asks instead. It's a vague question. Draco doesn't know what part she's talking about, and she might have seen this, because she tries to clarify, "When you were... after you woke up. I suppose I just wonder sometimes, how you must have felt to be leaving like that."
"So you know, you can leave now. You don't have to stay here anymore. We could just…" Harry didn't finish the rest of the sentence. Still, Malfoy hummed a second or two after, like he understood, sounding noncommittal and somewhat half-asleep. He got rather sleepy after sex. Harry, on the other hand, got riveted up. "Yeah. Like every few days, maybe?"
"Yeah, well, I wasn't the only one that chose to
had to leave everything behind."
Draco is not sure why
" he said, in a low, warning tone.
The thing was that Harry had been seeing Draco and his things in the kitchen for over a year now, or seeing him in the living room, with a drink and a song on his record player, or him with his violin. Now that he wasn't in the kitchen, and hardly ever came out of his lab beyond when it was necessary, it sometimes seemed like he wasn't in the house at all, and something about that didn't sit right with Harry.
Potter is watching him, face turned into the palm of Draco's hand. His glasses aren't on his face, and somehow the green of his eyes are always clearer and brighter without them, even in his dreams. And now here. He will always be the only thing as bright and beautiful as his dreams.
"Have you ever made stuff burst? Like in the cartoons when your hair goes all crazy and your face goes burnt?"
"No. I've worked them out, I think. Not entirely yet, because for most of my life I didn't know it was even possible to — I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, but I think I know one thing for sure."
"Does he?" Harry asked, not quite knowing what to say.
There were many mundane pictures, just Draco walking down the street, sitting in a car beside him with his face towards the window, across the booth from Harry where they ate, stood beneath tall historical buildings as he observed them to the fullest.
"Do you know why I was so angry at you?" Draco asked. He glanced at Harry's, quick, perhaps seeing Harry's uncertainty.  "You thought it was because you pushed the alteration on me. But I was, more than anything, angry at the cost of being in love with you."
They never made it there.
Harry didn't know what to do. He could only understand his silence for what it meant. Maybe some part of him had been hoping that the things Draco had done, that were so muddled by their unique predicament, were some of his own wanting. Like when they were dancing, Draco's fingers at his hairline, his brow. Like when he'd asked Harry for a kiss, told him he was good-looking.
"He did," Harry says, has to repress a ridiculous smile, looking down at his hands. "He came back."
Harry looked at her. "What do you mean?"
Some days went like that, when talking was easy, topics branching into more topics, until they ran out of things to say. Other days Draco seemed less inclined for a conversation, or at least seemed more resistant and wary to it, though Harry wasn't sure what for.
"No."
Harry nodded slightly, his eyes drooping back shut. When he pulled them open again, he noticed the expressions on their faces, until they looked away. "Di'n't work?"
uncouth," Draco admonished, but he was mostly distracted by the task at hand.
Draco eyed him for a moment, seeming strange. He opened his mouth to say something, but Andromeda's voice piped up from the door, telling them it was time for Teddy's nap. Harry gently pulled Teddy off the broom, Draco planting his oxfords back into the grass and helping him get off. Teddy was clearly getting irritable without his nap, and yet not ready to stop flying. It took both he and Draco too much time to coax Teddy away, and even then, he was crying as he was being taken away by Andromeda.
Harry stared at the
"I'm sorry," Potter says, painfully, sincerely contrite, after a long moment. "I… I had no idea what it would do."
"Aw," the lady mouthed, sympathetic and endeared. She smiled at him kindly as she was finishing up with the transaction. "Well, best wishes to the both of you, and I am very sure he will love the surprise."
Harry shakes his head. The amount of protest for something so simple is ridiculous to him. "
Nearing the end of November, Draco was healthier and better, eating well and warm and energised. He was picking up his violins, and re-enrolled into his potions classes, and rejoining his charity organisation. He was going around outside, visiting the people he loved, receiving them into their drawing room.
He could hardly think straight enough to produce a Patronus. It was about fifteen minutes of seeing no improvement in Malfoy and unsuccessful, increasingly desperate attempts that Harry forced himself to stop, take some time to breathe and clear his mind.
"Leave me," Draco mumbles, pushing at Potter's hands, his chest, his own hands too heavy to move much.
"Hey!" Harry exclaims louder to gain their attention, and the class settles, around the same time—
"Can't sleep either?" Draco shakes his head. Narcissa pats her lap. "Come here."
"Don't say his name." It comes out abrupt, the breathless plea out of him before he can stop himself. His eyes burn, a horrible, nauseating lurch through him that leaves its pain long after. "Please just don't..."
at Hermione, who huffs a half laugh. "Shut up, Gin." He pauses, and then turns to Harry. "Honestly, you know, maybe I don't really want to be an Auror either."
"Yeah?" Harry asked.
They're kissing a bit fervently when they hear a shuffle from the doorway. They break away to find Ron and Hermione. Hermione's hand on Ron's arm is about to steer them away, as if they were just on the verge of backing out. They stop, however, under their combined gazes.

Warning for brief homophobia (not by Draco or Harry)
Draco's throat convulses. He feels over the edge of a damp leaf scraping against his finger, grounding his senses into the planting of his shoes against the earth, the swell and sink of clean air moving through himself. It's a sweet and sickening pluck at the strings of his heart, hearing the sound of his own name in that lovely, quiet voice.
Perhaps Harry had just been somewhat concerned. Actually, Harry
When the table was set, Harry went over to him, kissed his shoulder and murmured into it, "Come for breakfast." Though he made no move, either, afterwards to step away, lost in his warmth, the two of them just breathing together in the absolute silence of the kitchen. But for the chirp of birdsong outside, speaking over each other. But for the tremor of a voice, singing on low from the wireless on the kitchen table. He could feel Draco turn his head a little towards him, the hushed smile where he pressed his cheek against Harry's.
questions then?"
Harry spent too long looking for something decent and casual to wear, trying his best to get his hair somewhat in control so that Malfoy wouldn't have anything to point out and mock, but his curls were still too wild and thick, and he was already minutes too late, which would certainly be something for Malfoy to point out and mock.
!" Malfoy gritted out. "Go sit somewhere else, why don't you?"
Harry's brain stopped working there. Which was happening far too much today.
The thestrals rise up into the air, dragging them all up afloat. He watches the world grow miniscule as it grows distant, and is left with a sickening and cold feeling that he is not of it.
" He stopped, puffed out a hard breath as the nausea roiled in his gut. "to
Heading back to his dorm at night, Draco crosses by the sight of Potter and his friends sitting by the fireplace across the lounge, a ruckus of laughter and conversation amongst them.
the curse, and the violent lurch in his chest that had led his body to react of its own accord, a sense of
"Fuck off!" Draco shoves at his shoulder, nearly tipping him over into the Lake. Harry laughs, gripping hard at the edge and Draco's arm to keep his balance.
"I'm going home," Harry says. He stands up from his chair, grabs his coat from the hooks.
Harry kisses Teddy's forehead, lays him down on his bed. Behind him, Draco watches them and smiles to himself. They leave then, closing the door gently behind them. They say their byes to Andromeda, and Andromeda hugs Harry, and then to his pleasant surprise, Draco.
. They were told of the possibilities of well-known complications,
What he had with Ginny was a lot more real, less about hormones and more genuine feelings when it had happened. But after the War, they just never got back together. It was just an unspoken sort of understanding and agreement, that there were a lot of things that could never go back to normal and they were one of those things. Neither of them were in the mindset to maintain a whole relationship after. She was dating Dean Thomas now.
Potter waits for him to say something only for a few seconds. There's nothing. With that, he walks past him towards the exit, Draco left behind to stare at nothing, lips parting around a protest that he didn't have the voice for.
Bill was to study the effects of the curse from a thread of both their magic and, "he might come by sometime in the near future for questions," Hermione warned. "Which, I know it will be difficult to talk about because it's so personal and strange
Ron and Hermione would stay the night at his house. There wasn't much conversation at the table, and Harry mostly spent it staring down at his plate, pushing his boiled vegetables around. Malfoy had skipped dinner. He'd gone straight upstairs with his bag, a heavy hand on the railing.
Harry wanted to say. Of course they can. What was he
He faced ahead, after a stilled moment, towards life and time and their endless, unstopping currents. He couldn't see anything. All the world was blurred.
I'm going to go have a dance with the only man I am all about."
He took it out every day, whenever Draco wasn't around and he could, to practice all the wand movements that made his arms creak and his head hurt by the end of it, trying to memorise and painstakingly pronounce right all the words with the help of a spell that made the words go green whenever they were uttered correctly, red when they weren't.
In the quiet that follows after, Draco falls asleep, bathed in the dim blue lights of astronomy. The next time Harry looks over at him, his eyes have slipped shut. His chest is rising and falling to a slow, even pace, his breaths audible and steady. The sound of him being alive and here.
Harry looked away too, wanting to ask, wanting to—but he didn't know how. He just didn't know how. His stomach was queasy, and a strange, inexplicable sort of dread was gnawing at his insides.
Dudley swallowed again. "It started showing up when she was one. I was at my parents' with her, when I was just getting good with them again. They didn't want Olivia over. You can imagine they weren't exactly glad about us being teenage parents." He paused. "They screamed at her too, you know. Like they used to at you. When she moved one of her toys from one place to another. She was so fucking shaken, and I picked her up and got out of there and I never went back. Not until dad died, and mum got lonely enough that she was willing to do anything to have me back. But they were awful about her for years."
It just hadn't mattered so much, then. Somehow it mattered now, in some way, seeing him here like this.
look. "He hasn't
Harry shook his head. "Sorry. I mean your right. That'd be my left."
She takes the circle of flowers from the air, stands on her bare toes and places it on his head. "I'll teach you."
He doesn't think Draco does mind it. Even when he's smirking at his flustered demeanour, there's always a hint of something mellow about it. Even when his reactions are controlled about the things Harry does, about the way he can't stop touching him, he can now tell Draco likes it, because he always runs his fingers through his hair after every one of Harry's zealous, greeting kisses, under the pretense of fixing the front of his messy hair, and when Harry takes his hand, Draco is never the one to let go first. Harry hadn't thought Draco was the sort of person to like things like that, and certainly not one to tolerate sweaty hand-holding, but apparently he is.
Harry turned his head back, stared at him, trying to read him. It felt surreal and dreamy, not unlike one of those dreams that left him ashamed and embarrassed upon waking, hard and wet, because they were about the one person he shouldn't have been having them about.
long story through the rest of the drive. Thinking of when they were eleven and thirteen and fifteen, and everything that had happened after that they never could have foreseen then. Dudley had, perhaps, taken the hint, and stopped asking him anything.
Pansy stares at him, her neat brows pinched. "Okay," she says, after a while. "Okay, I won't. But I need to ask you if he had something to do with what happened—"
But while Harry really did find it a lot better to not constantly be on the guard whenever he saw his old childhood rival, it was also just… unsettling, to see him the way he was now.
"Muggle song," Draco mumbled. "French. You wouldn't know."
"You fainted," Madam Pomfrey says.
but lie around these past two weeks," Draco said. "I'm tired of it."
"Five years," Harry mumbled at their nightcap. His head was over the back of the couch, his drink between his lap. "How am I supposed to…"
, Potter said.
and they were rolling sideways and Draco was under him, laughing, a helpless sort of sound. Harry was laughing too, putting his forehead to his, watching him as Draco curled an arm around his neck, then another. Then Harry was kissing him all over his face, every part of him, his cheek and his jaw and his neck and his shoulder, touching him everywhere he could.
"You've been looking at him a lot today," Ginny's voice piped up, and when Harry turned, he saw her leaning close to his shoulder, hands folded behind her.
"It doesn't seem so, judging by the look of you,"  she says disapprovingly. "I'll have to keep you here for the day, perhaps a few more. Nutrition, revitalising and strengthening potions three times a day should make you good as new, as well as a long, magically-induced rest."
Harry shrugged. "He just basically saw me as his servant."
But he isn't at all ready for the violent and dizzying riot of his tender feelings, the cramp low in his gut that lingers its ache long after, at the simple sight of him.
This venture, of accepting Potter back into his life, hadn't started off all too well.
of Harry's hand is around one of his wrists. He's pink in the cheeks, surprised, until that falls away and his eyes crinkle with a smile. He's in love with Harry too. He's been in love with Harry for a long time. The fact of that takes the breath out of his lungs once more, burns at the base of his throat.
"That's not the problem, Potter," Pansy says, her eyes sharp. She's staring ahead.
"Okay," Harry said, cutting him off, Draco's voice fading. "Okay. What do you need me to do?"
it also said, and he still doesn't know what to make of it.
Draco lets go, leaves their temples together. He takes hold of his hand, swallowing hard, seeming overcome. "Merlin, you drive me mad," he whispers, huffing. Harry smiles and kisses him hard.
"I know," Harry said, eyes following him as he moved over to his table full of apparatus, glass beakers and tubes and vials. In the centre, a cauldron was set on top of a burner.
"This isn't pity." He sighs. "Look, full disclosure, I spent too much of my life doing things I didn't want to do to invest myself into things I don't care for. So can we not do this again? This whole… you pushing me away thing. It was tiring then, and it's tiring now."
Afterwards, Harry sat there for the longest time in silent shock, overwhelmed by the bizarreness and immense surrealism of it all, as Malfoy laughed and laughed and laughed.
" His face fell, flushed, but he straightened quickly as if to compensate, clearing his throat quickly as well. He was doing everything too quickly. He raised his head to look at Harry, just a bit too high. "I believe this may be related to…"
Harry didn't look at him all throughout, hands gripping tight around the sides of the chair, shoulders and arms tensed. A hot flush was spreading up his neck, his ears, his breathing unsteady. He made Malfoy let him go too early, pushing his hands off, the curse only half-satisfied at the core, and left the room without looking back.
"Yeah, so then… then just friends. I suppose. Unless
is how it's going to be from here on?"
"I hope you're safe, and you're okay."
was the view, and those bloody Pyramids of Giza were just in the way."
Narcissa pauses for a moment, silent, and then says, "I want you to be somewhere I know you'll be safe. Even if it's just for a year right now."
He kept looking up at Draco, getting distracted by him standing in front of the kitchen window with a mug held high in his hand, the other tucked under his other arm over his chest. The sun shone against his silhouette, shadowed around his back, the rest of it diverging into blurry, bright golden around him.
" Harry said, breathed hard, looking down at his hand, at his nails touching the wood of the desk. Surely it didn't have to mean
The reception party had been a surprise, arranged and organised over the course of months by Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Luna for quite a while now. Draco had come in through the door, in the robes Harry had bought and asked him to come wearing. He was left wide-eyed, all the decorations in full bloom, surrounded by all their loved ones.
When he told him that maybe they didn't have to be in love to make this work. Like it wasn't entirely what Harry wanted to hear.
He cannot bring himself to say any of it, jaw working, chin quivering. His face contorts painfully, but the tears don't come beyond a sting in his eyes. He feels hollow and overwhelmed all at once, his breaths unsteady and growing higher and heavier into something louder, bordering on gasps. Panic and despair washes down on him, threatens to take him away somewhere else in his mind.
"I don't blame you for what you feel. Potter," Draco said. His voice was a bit raspy, and from the denying turn of his face, the sunken eyes of his profile, he was clearly tired, like he didn't sleep much, if at all. Like he'd been thinking all night. "My life was saved, with this curse. But your life was only ruined. And I do believe that, somewhere within yourself, you blame me for what happened to you." His mouth parted, working, stayed like that for a few seconds. Quieter, "I would
"Fuck." Harry rushed over, touched his face, dropping to his knees. "Draco?"
Harry spun it around his finger and thought of Malfoy sitting across from him over a table with a marriage document, impassive and sickly. He thought of the haze of his own mind, the illness that had coated his body, and how trapped and heartsick he'd felt in a vague and distant corner of his mind about it all. How he still felt it, now no longer so vague and distant.
"I know." Draco looked at Harry, held him there for a moment. His arms were folded, lounging against the doorframe as he did. His hair was now a muss of a loosened plaited bun and braided crowns, a frizz of stray hairs lit in the daylight, free of the decorative pieces of last night. Even then, he looked unfairly, effortlessly lovely.
"Yeah." Harry smiled. "He was, wasn't he?"
He doesn't finish what he's trying to say, ending it on another rough, quick clearing of the throat. But in the dark of the room, Harry finds himself smiling a hushed smile to himself. He can't explain why the words settle warmer and sweeter in his chest when they're coming from Draco, but they do.
Hermione paused at something over his shoulder. Harry turned to look, bemused, and found Malfoy standing in the doorway, his face pale and eyes bloodshot from a hangover, his hair damp from a shower.
"Hey. Draco?" He stepped close, reaching for his elbow. "Maybe we should go
And then the shame and guilt is sinking in, and he's almost about to turn around and walk away. Just walk away right there, thinking of Ron and what he'd look like if he knew, thinking of Ginny and the way she'd feel knowing of this, these feelings that are no longer for her.
Then they had another night like this, days later. Then they had another, and another, until it started to get easier.
naive—"
* * *
By the next second, Elias was on the floor, bewildered and blinking at him. Harry had sat upright, hands pushed back into the couch, panting heavy and hard as he stared down at him. For a good minute, he was muddled as to what had exactly happened. Then slowly, it followed, one understanding pulling along into another, clicking together
"This is too much, guys, I don't know if I
"Exactly what it sounds like. Removing a selected memory, or memories, permanently."
"My beautiful love," Draco murmured.
the day before that…"
There were vegetables unevenly sliced, the rest left uncut on the chopping board. A few plates were shattered near the counter.
Harry is about to let go of him, his brain only then verging on a horrible doubt, on stepping back quickly. But then Draco's palm flattens at the middle of his spine, a very light and almost tentative touch, and he doesn't move away from Harry.
Draco's mind is racing to the background noise of a grainy tune, the beating of his heart gone haywire, and Potter, as always, oblivious to it all.
Draco raises an eyebrow, looking at him from the corner of his eye. "Look, Potter, it's all in the wording. If you just word something right, you can tell somebody to fuck right off and still be polite."
"Why—" Harry asked hesitantly. Some part of him didn't know if he wanted to know the answer, if he wanted to hear that Malfoy would have spent the day with anyone else other than Harry if he could have, because Harry
conversation.
Harry's brain froze on the words, and his chest went constricted.
"I'm sorry too," Harry says quietly, nearly breathless with the weight of his emotions. Draco looks up at him across the table, his face smoother than it was minutes ago. "I was selfish, wasn't I? You going through all that, and all I could…"
Harry smiles. "Yeah." His voice comes soft and sleep-thick.
Madam Aileen shrugs. "Everybody loves and craves. Fame and fortune. Status and talent. All things you can love and crave, can't you? But as far as I know, it isn't for those who don't love and crave a
Harry wondered if he wanted something with her that he could never have here with Harry, "Did you want to marry her?"
? Why not just finish your last year here? And you're—you're bound to stay here by the Ministry, aren't you? How can you…"
" Ginny says. She's lying down on her back and staring up at the ceiling, Harry sat on the edge of the bed, staring at nothing. They were kissing, but his heart wasn't in it, and she noticed.  "Like your mind's always somewhere else."
Harry nods, tearing his gaze away from Draco, finally, to follow the movement of his own steps. He pulls his hand out as a shiver runs up his spine, flicks his wand again.
"I don't have heterosexual sensibilities," Harry said with an eyeroll. "I'm not even heter—"
Malfoy spent a minute very silent, his glare burning on Harry. Harry pointedly ignored him, flipping through pages. "Get that off, Potter."
"It's hard to miss," she says, softly.
The gala was all drinks and talking and dancing. Harry had a table at the corner, where everybody came to talk to the guest of honour. While Draco was hosting and going around checking on people, conversing with them and charming them with his close attention and easy laughter, Harry was in the company of a man who went on a long-winded story about the amount of money he had made over the years, how he made it, and how he started. Harry was nodding politely along to it, forcing interjections, not entirely certain of what else to say.
And then he slips inside the room, shutting the door. The music is throbbing along to the throb of Harry's heart. Somehow, it's enough for him to work over a decision in his mind, to ease some more of his inhibitions, his inexplicable hesitance and low courage. More than anything, he's just not able to think of much else beyond what he wants right now. How much he does.
He feels the weight of Draco's head, settling against his shoulder. Harry shifts his cheek onto his hair, the two of them with their faces lowered towards their hands. He will never fully understand what it's like to have reality lose all colour in its most literal sense, to need something that doesn't exist, or to have lived an entire life of warped time, but he has seen enough of the way it has hurt Draco.
"Very soft to be using the word 'cute' for a soppy lyric."
"You're good with him," Harry said. Draco looked at him, visibly surprised by the compliment, flushing slightly.
"Good food. Travel. Experience. Adventure." Every word Draco said was a step closer to Harry, and Harry kept himself very still, eyes following his face. He paused, in front of him, smirked, a flick of his eyes down, up. "Sex," he whispered. "I want it all. And if I could have had love..."
What did he think was happening to him? Why did he think it was
They both turned around at the same time to look at the newcomer, Harry's smile growing on his face. Ron spread his arms wide as he entered, and Harry got up and hugged him. He let go with a pat to Harry's shoulder.
Draco had not been amused, to say the least, and it showed.
Basically, the alteration (a sort of surgical procedure that was meant to 'alter' the curse so as to cut it down from its total lifespan of 25 years to 5) went wrong for Draco in that it was redirected more towards him, less towards Harry. This puts Draco's life at risk because the greater intensity of the curse lets negative emotions between him and Harry affect him (when it didn't before)
Draco doesn't say anything to that. Perhaps the worst thing is that he doesn't have enough in him to be angry all that much.
Draco scoffed, derisive. "Weren't
Harry grins, sidles up next to him to look at them all with him, touching the side of his head against Draco's. They reminisce about them to each other, crack up over the stories behind some of them. Draco turns his head and catches Harry's mouth mid-way through his laugh, quieting them both into the kiss.
"But there are still things that I did, that I think about now, and I realise how much they must have hurt you. And I didn't do right by you at all. Not telling Ginny and everybody. Not choosing us, you."
"Vengeance," Harry repeats, just before Draco balls up snow and smears it all over his face, thereby beginning a full-fledged snowball fight that lasts for an indecipherable amount of time.
"Right. Well," Harry said, weakened by the sudden and sharp awareness of his own secrets, quiet. He stood up to his feet. "I'm going to bed."
Draco glances up briefly from his notes to look at what 'this' is. Caramel pudding. He looks back down at the pages, reading through the applications and effects of Porcupine quills, or trying to. "And how do you know that?"
He conjured a Patronus. His mind felt foggy and slow. He had to try a bit harder to feel a memory with Draco, and then his stag came out, flew through a wall. When he turned, Dudley was standing in the doorway, having come back from washing his hands in the loo across the corridor.
Harry laughs.
Harry doesn't wait to listen to the rest of it. He just turns around and runs. He runs out the commons, down all the stairs to the third floor corridor, towards the one-eyed witch with the secret passage that opened into Honeydukes.
Malfoy's father died in Azkaban.
He could only gather that somebody had disparaged and humiliated Narcissa whilst she was out somewhere, had spat on her and called her something awful.
"Shame," Harry says. "It could have been like old times. You and me."
"Yeah. I'll be fine."
"I don't know. Sometimes it's hard to remember that. That they do..."
Harry grinned. He lowered his head in the little space between them to take his hand, Draco's head also lowered, watching him slide the ring into his finger. It was fitted, right above the silver band that symbolised their lack of choices, and now the moonstone gem and silver patterns that said,
, and he was fixated, and he couldn't look away.
He knew that Draco had a mole at the side of his throat, that he had a birthmark on his hip, and he was sensitive on his neck, and his abdomen, the dips of dimples at his lower back, the inside of his knees. He had a greyed Dark Mark, with so many glamours on it that the skin there looked bright. He had scars, the terrible ones Harry had given him, but he hid them too. Harry wondered, vaguely, what it was that made him turn out the lights until he came back one day without them. Had he interpreted whatever Harry must have looked like as a face of disgust?
Draco's mind keeps running through Potter's grin and laughter, dwelling in the sweet, aching warmth filling into the hollows of his chest.
"How can I hurt when holding you?" Harry mouths along to him, smiling. Draco stares at him. "What? It's a cute lyric."
He wonders what she's like, sometimes, what it is that Potter sees in her. From all that he's heard of her, she's expressive, confident and bold.
Harry sat there through the silence stretching after his own voice, only the tinny song from the wireless on the kitchen table, taking him in — the back of his head tilted against the edge of the counter, his eyes red and swollen. His face was held together, worn and hollow.
Potter kisses him behind a statue in the corridor they'll have to part ways from, asks Draco to be by the Great Lake for lunch, and grins much too brilliantly at Draco on his affirmation before he kisses him again, hard enough this time that it bobs his head back.
"Special cases," Xavier answered, simply. "Emotional bonds are extremely tricky things, you see. And when it comes to saving lives, in magic?" He sat back against the chair, fingers curled loose on the desk. "Sometimes, Mr. Potter… it just isn't as simple as being
There was nothing after that. There was just the sound of rustling clothes, when he took off his own robes, and the sheets when Harry laid down behind him on the bed. He slid an arm around him, scooted up close to his back, feeling the clarity of his body and heat through his shirt, reflecting back to himself.
"I'm gay," Draco says, very quietly, to her.
It was also their free and easy love that made something in Harry shrivel up, hopeless and sad.
It's a blur, the seconds and steps that follow. Harry doesn't entirely remember the way it happened, just that he is going to his knees in front of him, one after the other to the floor—just that Harry's hands are around his face, so close to his own that the very tips of their noses are brushing.
"I'm scared," Draco whispered, face half-hidden behind the pillow. He sounded impossibly young, in that raw admittance.
Harry swallowed around his heart, looking up at him now. Draco's hair was all softly around his eyes, feathered shadows on his face, the sharp line of his throat in firelight. He was so beautiful, and smart, and lovely, and Harry hadn't ever thought it was possible to want somebody with an intensity quite like this, in every sense of the word
"I'm sorry," he says. His voice comes out low, strained, and he feels like he can never be sorry enough for what had happened to her at the hands of his family. "For what Bellatrix and my father did to you."
"I tried to," Harry says, repeating his own words back from before. "I couldn't do it."
"No problem." Longbottom's voice is careful and slow. "I'm only curious."
Draco's lips turn up a little, looking down at the slow, swaying steps of their walking.
Harry brought his camera along, and was taking a wide view of the entire room and everybody in it, all the golden fairy lights and a lovely Christmas tree — there, Draco with his mother, Andromeda and Molly, the four of them in a circle of conversation. There, George with Angelina and Luna and Teddy. Ginny had come up to him, which he only realised when he turned with the camera onto her face, her freckles magnified in the grainy, dim quality of the viewer.
"Aco," Teddy said, pulling saliva-soaked fingers out of his mouth, pointing at Draco. Then he rigidly arched his back, insisting to be released, and so Harry did. He set him down on his feet gently between his knees, balancing him with a lingering, loose grip under his arms.
That he's thinking about it, trying not to. Having him on him, under him, and about his mouth, grinning above him, dimples folding into his cheeks. The bright gleam of his grey eyes, set alight with exhilaration.
Draco huffs, trying to transfigure a flowerpot into a bird. Luna isn't the only one who
He snaps awake to hands on his shoulders, shaking him awake, somebody yelling, "
Harry turned the lights off, nonverbally, because it was weirder to have to look at each other when they did this. His magic was erratic and everywhere though, so all the items rattled, and then settled. There was a scuff as Malfoy stepped forward in the dark. He smelled strongly of alcohol, seemed drunker than he was when Harry had seen him in the drawing room.
The whole restaurant exploded into cheers and wolf-whistles. The waiters and waitresses present were grinning too, clapping loudly along with the rest of them.
"Nothing. I just—" He clears his throat. "I can do it myself. Even if it's not—I mean, it's not like anyone cares."
"I can't make myself feel something I don't feel."
"Is it really so hard to believe that I just want you?"
Hello!
Harry swallowed. He felt strangely guilty, in hindsight, for not being that person, because Draco was the one that went through all the trouble for it.
they flooed away, one after another.
Harry did finally manage to pull him down, get him flat on his back to the bed, grinning above him as he kissed him. Draco's breaths were still hitching on his laughter, and the camera was still in his hand, recording, forgotten into the kiss.
He stops looking for Draco.
Harry snorted, and then shrugged. "Um. That's good, I suppose?"
Draco bites his lip as he glances away, and then scoffs, exasperated perhaps more at himself than anything, at his fool of a heart. He turns back and takes the plate from Potter's hand. He doesn't look at him again for fear of his transparency.
Harry keeps silent. It doesn't feel right talking about Ginny to him.
"Yes. Do you know what's happening with Draco?" Narcissa asked, cutting right to the point.
"Can we get back to the part where you said you liked me?"
Harry pretended he didn't notice the two of them going out into the corridor, that he didn't hear the sound of their voices, a low, whispering argument.
"That'll work," Draco says. He's still eying the Galleon, turning it this way and that, a quirk of a smile at his lips. He looks up at Harry, still with that impressed smile, and Harry's heart inexplicably flips into his throat. "It's much better than risking being found by Filch, or bloody
* * *
Her face smoothed, mouth parting in an 'o', as if she understood, even though she might not have entirely understood why he was buying such an awfully expensive ring, the kind that would usually be purchased exclusively for proposals or weddings. "A present for him, then?"
"I'm afraid I'm not entirely sure what we're talking about here."
Or the sudden conflict slipping into his chest, stretching taut and tight, at the thought of forgetting all his joy and good and comfort.
Draco sets his jaw. There is a tight, swooping feeling in his chest. He holds himself still and careful, controlled. He blinks, a bit fast. "What, do I look at you like I like being with you? So sorry. How terrible of me."
In Potions, Malfoy worked alone as always. With Ron and Hermione partnering together, Harry paired up with Neville, which turned out to be disastrous as always as they were both disasters when it came to Potions. They had to try two more times after just to get something that resembled what it was meant to.
Draco kissed him, and then kissed him and kissed him until they were rolling a little, Draco on top of him and Harry fully on his back, taking every one of them against his mouth with as much speed and ferocity, and then he was laughing a bit between each one, pulling Draco in even closer onto his body with an arm.
Harry relaxed, shaking his head. "Sorry, it's just
Malfoy shrugged. "Never hurts to be well-dressed. I reckon you could use a lesson or two." He smirked in amusement, as if to take the edge off the barb.
"He cares for you. We both do."
He raises an eyebrow, staring ahead. He vaguely notices his own speeding pace as he walks down the corridors towards the Hogwarts Library. "So? Smith was being a right bastard to him."
They sat on the chairs and slept in the beds. They ate at the table and used their cutlery. They walked the carpets and floors, left phantasmical echoes of their voices in the halls. They left behind the screams and cries of the tortured. Everywhere he looked, there were phantoms of corpses, of blood staining their table sheets, their rugs and tiles.
It's hard to let him go again, watching him smile at him from the train window as it begins to move forward. Harry raises his hand out of his pocket, a still wave, smiling back. It's hard to let him go when he's only just gotten him back, but it's okay. Harry can let him go when he knows he will come back to him.
Draco stared at him, still seemed to be breathing a bit high and shallow in his chest. He nodded. "Alright. Good. That is…"
he thinks, but his mother seems to expect this to reassure him.
"Would it have worked?"
"Who's there?"
"So it
"No it's not!—" Scorpius shouts from the back, scowling at the back of Matthew's head.
"I think they did something to me," Draco said, quietly. "What I don't understand is why they didn't tell me."
. "RUN!"
When the song ends, Potter asks, "So you listen to it, then? Muggle music?"
"I don't know. I didn't…" He'd been in Knockturn Alley, sometime at night, making his way back to a small room he'd rented in a nameless residence. He hadn't seen. It had been dark, and all he'd heard was a voice, a
Potter's lips raise at a corner in a half-smile. Draco wants to ask what he's smiling about, but that would give away the fact that he's been looking at him this entire time.
But that is where he ends up anyway.
exactly?"
"Draco?" Harry said. Draco had stilled at the sound of his voice. He reached an arm over the pillow and touched his bicep, frowning. "Are you…"
That night, Malfoy had come into the drawing room when Harry was sitting on the couch, pulling his socks off. He'd come back just now from Ron and Hermione's. He spared Malfoy a glance, saw him in his white long-sleeved shirt and black bottoms, towelling his damp hair, and then quickly looked away. The events of the afternoon, which he'd blessedly put out of his mind, came crashing back.
Harry's brain keeps running through the unpleasant scene in the infirmary.
washing him in shame.
Draco didn't say anything for a moment. "Was it about…"
In their later years, he would place them on kitchen counters by coffee or tea under stasis (a drawing of zombie-like Harry becoming happy Harry,
Harry understood. Draco hadn't wanted him either, and it had made all the sense in the world back then, but now it only hurt to hear aloud.
Sometimes the curse was still quiet. Sometimes it had only just begun to grow into his usual, moment-to-moment unease. They tried to stretch out a bit more, but half-way through the fifth day, when they were both in the midst of work and social outings, it had reared itself, and so, four days was decided to be the limit of their ability for separation.
Then he heard it, through the fuzz of slumber still coating his mind, leadening his limbs. There was the sound of a shallow, erratic breathing throughout the room, a small shuddering. It was hushed, but even then, it was audible in the overall silence. Alarmed, he quickly leaned up onto a shoulder.
Harry pushed him down and pinned him to the couch, pressed flush against him between the spread of his legs. Rolled against him, both of them gasping again, trembling from the overwhelming surge of exhilaration and pleasure, just by that alone.
" That was where his face almost contorted. He clenched his jaw harder, eyes red-rimmed and wide with something that was as much terror as it was anger.
* * *
I'm sorry for stringing you all along with this fic so much 🙈 but in my defense, this is all extremely complicated
But once it was over and most of it had calmed, Draco pushed him away again, his breaths just a little short of steady, all hollow-eyed anger and exhaustion afterwards.
"That's what people in love do," Draco said, smiling slightly.
They eye each other for a moment, not saying anything, perhaps waiting for the other to. But neither of them speak. Inexplicably, Harry finds himself smiling, half-grinning, his face splitting with it, strangely dizzied and heady from the warmth of the drinks in his system, the smell of the lingering cologne on him.
He doesn't realize his breathing sounds so loud in the room until Longbottom's voice lightens slightly, "I'm not saying you did. But honestly? I do worry that maybe she sees you and remembers your family, being captive in your home."
* * *
Harry laughs, only the slightest of a tremor. "It's telephone."
Ron raises his eyebrow. "Really? You have… no complaints? At all? This is
"Draco?"
Narcissa stood. Harry's head snapped up, back straightening. From the look on his face, Harry could tell he'd been here for a while.
but he doesn't say this, keeps it inside of himself. He doesn't know what he would have done if anything had happened to him, but it's not about him so much as it is about what Draco must have felt in that moment, what could have had him stand there on the edge, seeing no other way out. He tucks their hands to his own chest and takes Draco in by the back of his head, against his own temple, a wordless solace between them. They sit there like that, just being, huddled under the same coat.
Harry was smiling. He shrugged. "Sometimes. What are your plans for the day?"
The silence draped over them once more.
no." He sounded strange, a bit strained. He straightened, cleared his throat, quickly, "No, I suppose not. I"d rather… not live like this."
Draco doesn't say anything either for a long moment. "You need time," he repeats, then, quietly. "That's what you told her."
He talked about Cedric and Dobby and Hedwig and his beloved godfather, Sirius, and Mad-Eye and Dumbledore and Fred. All the people he lost. He talked about dying in a forest at the hands of Voldemort, and the choice he had, and how much he wanted to go.
Sometimes it felt like he hated Harry from every fibre of his being all over again, and maybe it was because he blamed Harry for it, and maybe it was right, because Draco might have sat in that office and signed the contract for the alteration, but it was Harry who brought it to him, who pushed it onto him even when he kept saying he wasn't certain about it, who didn't do enough to keep him safe from what had happened to him, and now he was sick. Now he was angry and terrified and hurting.
Teddy pushed a finger at the tip of his nose, frowning, bemused.
Their next trip was to Rome, Italy. They travelled in the morning through the Portkey Office, drove by a taxi the rest of the way to their hotel. They went to see the Trevi Fountain, full of coins thrown in the water.
"Mate, why did you even agree?" Ron questioned. "You should have told him to bugger off right then and there."
"Ginny," Harry says, when she's at the door.
For a while, there was nothing said, and then, "Like what?" Draco scoffed, a small movement in his chest. "What can we even do with this damned curse on us?"
Then eventually it would escalate into a whole argument until one of them marched off, not to be seen until the curse reared its head once more.
That evening, Harry called Xenophilius, and told the world the truth on Veritaserum.
After a long time of gathering his composure, Draco spells them all back into the box, casts a
"Yeah?"
"I don't want you to go," she says, a frown on her face. "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. We can just sit here and not speak if you'd like."
They notice that too. It's in their faces, the way they falter at times, seem confused, a wavering smile. He keeps going away, coming back, came back so strange all these years later. He doesn't like being touched where he always used to initiate it, moves away from Pansy's hands now. He doesn't eat enough. He doesn't sleep right, trembles in his dreams. He does not talk about Harry Potter when that is all he once seemed to do, whenever they bring him up, ask him questions about him.
"I'm..." Draco paused, his throat flexing. "I'm sorry."
Harry didn't feel much on hearing the apology, or on anything right now really, and he could only take this as forgiveness, as having moved on. "Water under the bridge," he said. He'd said the same thing to Draco, but right now, he just felt numb and off-kilter.
There's Potions, first, where Harry and Hermione sit together, noting down the instructions on how to brew a Laughing Potion. He sits two seats behind Malfoy on the row to his left, notices him stare ahead at an empty space at the front of the classroom until Slughorn comes and fills its place, and then never lifts his head up again, only listening and taking notes.
," He said the word with a dim sort of disdain. "is what I mean, but that would be difficult to pull off, given your dislike for each other, so civility should do as well. Now it wouldn't be entirely…comfortable for him, even then, but I'm certain elimination of much of the ill-feelings should be enough."
He didn't know where it was all really coming from, or if he entirely understood what the cryptic words even meant. They almost sounded like they were coming from someone else.
That Draco didn't forget
Muddled up emotions and despair, that had laid dormant in his chest, began to swell up into the forefront, overwhelming, running through him. He thought of five years, the burden of a life on his shoulders, dependent on the choices he made
"My feelings for you have always been this muddled, confusing thing tangled up in a hundred other feelings, and…" There was the sound of a small scrape off-camera. "And hatred was the clearest one that I could make sense of, the way I thought about you all the time. It was quite unhealthy, I believe. The way I centred around you. Always chasing after you."
"Oh, for Salazar's—" Draco stood up, rolling his eyes, annoyed. Harry's lips trembled on the edge of another laugh, biting them as he watched Draco push his chair back, presumably to head for a mirror. His eyes followed after Draco as he left the room, still smiling at the doorway where he disappeared.
Draco stopped humming. His brows jumped, even with his eyes closed. He was settled between Harry's socked feet planted onto the settee, hand curled around the neck of the empty bottle they'd been sharing.
It's not all perfect, the way it seemed it was in the dreams by whatever Harry's read of them in the letters. There, it seemed like they never had bad days. But here they do. An upsetting thing at the school, an insolent parent — a rude patient for Harry, a case gone wrong. They have disagreements and conflict. Sometimes they get upset at the other, or go withdrawn and sulky. Sometimes they get snappy if they're both in a bad mood, in which case they both eventually separate into different rooms until they calm down. Harry gives Draco space until he's ready to talk about what happened, and Draco will silently come over and hold Harry if he is open to it, as preferred, and sort through stuff with him. If it's because of something the other person did, they try to work on it together and adjust. They make it work, and it's effort some days, but it's effort that's easy to put in when it comes from a place of love.
"No."
He saw Malfoy only then, now that his line of vision was cleared. He was lying on the bed, arms atop each other over his abdomen, and Harry could only see the tuck of wavy hair behind an ear, a cheekbone. The pale dust of eyelashes. His figure looked strangely small like that, under the falls of the sheets. Harry wanted to say something, voice without words spooling at his tongue, but the medimagical staff started coming in right when he'd opened his mouth.
Harry's eyes flicked to Malfoy, a nauseated feeling in his throat that wasn't entirely to do with illness. Malfoy's widened gaze was rooted to nothing in front of him, boring a hole into the carpet.
"Do you still talk?"
"No," Hermione says, and then she's beside him, grabbing his elbow. "No, today, you're going to
"Um, yeah. The thing about being a primary school teacher that really likes listening to children talk? You pretty much know everybody's business. Do you really have the 'prettiest black alpaca' that you named Harold—? Okay, never mind," he backtracks sheepishly upon seeing Draco's mortified horror.
Ron had become quite calm after the war. There were bad days, of course, when the trauma hit him as it hit the rest of them, and he still had nightmares about losing Fred, but mostly, he seemed to have realized the fragility and importance of life and had developed a sort of stability and appreciation and a one-track mind towards it, discarding all unnecessary things, such as his grudge against Malfoy. Hermione and many others seemed to share that mindset with Ron. Harry envied the renewed perspective they had all gained. He felt as if he himself had only grown harder and more bitter rather than grateful after everything, after all that they lost.
"I didn't know either if you'd… I mean, after your letter… you sounded like you might not want to."
Harry thinks, just for a second, of turning his head and doing something he can't acknowledge the thought of.
There were empty spaces at the jokes shop, where George worked alone, and in the suffocating sorrow between him and Ron some nights when he wakes up crying and missing his brother. In Andromeda's eyes when she looked at Teddy and remembered what she'd lost. In Teddy's sweet, unaware smiles and his innocence, the spaces around him filled by everyone but those that brought him into this world. In letters Harry no longer receives, having
There was a delay, Harry still trying to gather himself. His throat convulsed, shifted his jaw against Draco's hair.
"Please do," Draco says. The chocolate frog ribbits in his grip, as he turns his card over to look at it.
Harry visits her more often after that, and stays much longer.
"What, like you're an idiot?" He's adamantly trying not to think about what else might have slipped onto his traitorous face. He takes a step behind on his shoes, hands pushed into the pockets of his overcoat. "It's because you are one."
, like some
"Will you be going back for Christmas, then? To your mum?" Harry asks him, pushes his hands into his pockets again.
"Perhaps some day," Draco says. He settles back down in his chair. He pauses for a moment, throat convulsing. He darts a glance away, and then down at the top of the desk. His jaw shifts. "And what of the other things I'd—that I'd like to forget? Things unrelated to the dreams?"
It all reached him at a very vague level, but mostly it was slipping off him like water, and he kept trying to repeat it back to her,
Harry blinked, fast, his throat dry. He nodded, working to get his hands under his shirt again.
It was supposed to be okay, was what he would think a long minute after she was gone, holding Draco whilst they laid on the bed sideways. He was still reeling, hearing the words echo back in his head from the end of this very long tunnel, still trying to absorb what wasn't sinking in. The only thing that made it any real was this distant, horrible fear gnawing at the pit of his stomach.
They were home again, back in Grimmauld Place. While Draco was off for a shower, Harry sat in their bed, roving through it all in his camera. He had to have another memory card, because the last one had gotten full. It had many blurred pictures of Draco, but he didn't delete any of them. He wanted them all.
Their lives are not bright beyond imagination, or perfect, but they are full of love and laughter and warmth, all the same.
"Why—" His voice is shallow, thick, a little breathless. "Why are you telling me all of this?"
"Ask the Headmistress, why don't you?"
"You like this, don't you?" he says, pulling him by the hands a little away from the wireless playing a low song into the night, brilliant green eyes brighter with that sweet, crooked little grin as they stumbled a small step to a still, faces swaying too close. "Dancing? You said you did."
"It did," Neville says. Ron is absently wiping his sleeve at Hermione's foamy mustache, most of his attention on Neville. "It still sort of does, but it was worse at first. Not afraid, but just… sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's a bit hard to shake that away, to be honest, but it's been a few days, and it didn't, and… well. Seems to me like there's a lot on everybody's minds these days, and he's no different. I guess he's not really up for being a prick anymore."
"Don't touch me."
"So you must either communicate, or do the work within yourself somehow, I'm afraid."
He still visits Narcissa, but now they do not speak about Draco. He just asks after her.
"Ugh, gross," Harry said, even though he didn't mind. He was hiding his eyes, a laugh rising in his chest when Ron shoved at his shoulder with a, "Oh right! Forgot there were children in the house!"
Draco had woken up bitter and aching, filled with an unspeakable fear and anger thrawn in his chest, an ugly and raw thing. It had followed him all through the morning, and seeing Potter in that moment had felt like the last thing he could bear.
After a momentary bout of shock, eyes shut in startlement and white-blond eyebrows raised up high, Draco responded, lips parting slightly on the next kiss. His hands tugged him closer by the biceps and then wrapped roughly around his waist, one hand clutching at his cheek to hold him in place. He was snogging him back just as desperately, like he was compelled and couldn't help himself, giving back one open-mouthed kiss after another after another, one kiss, two kisses, three more, tongues pressing tentatively against each other's. Their tilted heads switched to their opposite sides to fit their lips better, noses knocking together and Harry's glasses cutting into the bridge of his nose.
Draco hummed. They lapsed into silence again. On the wall was a shape of a diagonal shard of evening light, yellow-orange illuminating the room. Harry's mind focused on it, all the while he was rubbing his thumb back and forth over the space beside Draco's spine, just wanting to hold him as close as he could.
But Harry loses all his nerve, and ends up asking instead, "So, the obliviation procedure, um — what happened?"
Hermione stares at him, takes a sip of her butterbeer. When she pulls it away from her lips, there's a foamy mustache. "It… it doesn't bother you at all, then?"
"You will do no such thing," Draco interrupts her coldly.
It's a while after that she speaks again.
He hums, but doesn't say much else.
Harry took his arm, held fast this time. "Draco," he whispered. "Please."
The closed ceiling expands into open skies. Draco lowers the wand, a tremor in his hand, in his chest, but the spell comes easy to him now despite it all. He puts the wand inside the drawer and closes it. He lays down on the bed, stretching his body across the mattress. He stares up at the scatter of stars above him, folds his arms over his abdomen. The chokehold in his throat relaxes into freer inhales and exhales of air.
Then there was cake, Andromeda's hand firm over Teddy's around the hilt of a blunted cake knife, gently guiding him to cut through it. A small part of it went wasted in a cake fight, all the Weasley siblings smearing it over each other's faces,
"Do you think it hurts? Dying?"
of the timebomb that was their bond now.
Draco shoved at his chest, forcing him to stumble back a step. "Just go! Get out!"
"No, I… fuck," Harry whispered, closed his eyes. He rubbed at his face, the guilt twisting his stomach. "No. I'm so sorry. For… I don't know what came over me. I was so out of line. I shouldn't have done that."
There you go. I'm sure she'll listen to you."
Draco blinked, brows twitching further in confusion, chest heaving slightly. It appeared to take him some time to register what was being said.  "I...My chest?"
"I wasn't their son," Harry told him. "They didn't have to."
"Yeah, I get it," Ron says, grimacing with a wince. They take a left turn out of the classroom and to the corridor, grabbing Hermione's hand.
Draco smiles slightly. He looks so nervous, preciously hopeful. "I'd like that."
"Forbidden Forest." Potter's hand is soothing and firm at his side. He licks his lips, turns his face away. Then, quietly, "I died there."
They're just short letters at first, or they're two lines of a thought, or they're three lines of something he has never said to Harry, or they're something as simple as a dated
"And why exactly did we leave so early?" Draco asked, then, moving over to the hooks. He was tilting his head slightly over his shoulder, reaching his arms up high and hanging his coat on it. Harry thought it rather poncey for him to be wearing overgarments even in April.
Blaise runs a hand down his face, resting at his mouth, wild-eyed and ablaze where they set lower on him again. "if I got my hands on whoever this was, I'd fucking kill them," he grits out, a low, trembling rage.
"Draco?" Harry said, kneeling down in front of him, where he'd fallen back against a tree. He had a hand on his elbow.
"A lot of people are seeing one, you know? Ron and Hermione did too, for some time. It helped them a lot."
Harry finds his name placed next to Seamus' on the
Draco favoured strawberries and cherries in fruits. He'd been taking violins classes since he was seven. He was currently fascinated by and learning to play Jascha Heifetz' pieces. He was trilingual, the third being Italian. He liked butter biscuits.
, I mean it generously. He's going to get on top of the table, sing all the lyrics out drunkenly into an imaginary mic as he points at Hermione, while
He seemed particularly adamant, insistent. Malfoy's jaw was set. There was something in his gaze, a few shades off of some brimming emotion. On Harry's persistent silence, Malfoy closed his eyes, as if trying to summon patience and composure, and said, dangerously low, "Potter, for Salazar's
What happened to you, to
He was just laughing, thick and watery, sort of choked and forced out of him in stilted bursts, and Harry was putting his forehead to his before he was realising it, laughing with him in that same thick and watery way, overcome with a love so tender and painful he didn't know where anything began and ended. He could not bring himself to tell Draco the rest of the story, when the Dursleys came home and got so angry at him.
"Death-Eaters. You Know Who— they took me, and they—for months—" He's shaking, and cold. But that is about all he can get out of himself. Pansy is frozen, and then she's trembling, blinking hard.
"But you're alright?"
He begins to shrug the coat off. "Well.
Hermione would come some weekends with entire tombs of books, searching for something and forcing Ron and Harry to read along with her, but by now, it was clear that there just wasn't much information about these things. She was always encouraging honesty and communication between the two of them, the only other thing there was to cope with their predicament.
"Yes," Harry said, smiled and kissed his forehead. "That there."
Draco's looking at him, his face the same as it was when he stood in the stands, carefully not giving anything away. "I know," he says. "I could tell."
Harry frowned, looking at him again, and then frowned deeper. Malfoy was leaning against the doorway. His face seemed pale under the low light, but Harry couldn't entirely tell if it wasn't just the light. Malfoy had that kind of face, all sharp facial lines and delicate features.
"Pansy Parkinson?"
* * *
Harry didn't understand this right away. Something niggled at him, and his mind stuck on it, for a very long moment, staring up at Draco's patiently waiting face through a watery, faint frown.
"It could have," Draco repeats, quietly, smiling back.
Harry's hair is tied up in a bun today, loose curls at his temples. He is all black turtlenecks,old jeans, and brilliant green eyes behind glasses. And he is so bloody irritating, being all annoyingly sweet to children that fawn over him and flock to him like bloody pigeons—
Malfoy hadn't been looking at him, though, and Harry found his eyes straying, quick to glance away whenever they caught sight of anything of him. When the curse settled, Malfoy pushed him back and quickly shouldered past him, out the door.
"Why can't you call me Harry?"
"I—" Harry says, falters, doesn't really know what it is that he wants to say. Too many things,
happening right after?
Draco's face slips, then, just slightly, a peculiar expression flashing across his face, before it's quickly schooled away into an unimpressed look. Harry awkwardly withdraws his hand.
"Probably around half past two," Harry estimated, and then chuckled softly at the surprised, wide-eyed expression on Draco's face as his hand stilled, glancing over at him sharply.
"What?" Harry asked.
"Did you blame me?" Draco asked, when Harry let the kiss go. "For the curse?"
Sometimes the curse would act up days later, and their hands would escalate into the movement of their bodies instead. Sometimes Malfoy would pull his shirt up over his head in the darkness of the bedroom, crowd him in against the wall until Harry could feel all of him. Sometimes Harry would push his lower back against the desk, and Malfoy would jump himself onto it, hands on his shoulders, letting Harry slip between the spread of his legs.
"Yeah," Harry says. "And besides, the food's way better when it's fresh out of the kitchens. So I don't mind."
He got into contact with Healer Francine days later, made an appointment. He couldn't hear much of what she said where Malfoy was sat on the hospital bed, beyond
Draco intakes a small breath. "Well. They are as good as removed, in that I don't
The fourth time it hit had Draco folding over, hands tight around the desk. He was gasping in pain, and Harry was already at his side, trying to pull him towards himself.
There was a pause, a fairly long one.  "That, I don't know." There was the small sound of him swallowing. "It doesn't matter. I'm going to figure it all out."
Draco slips off of him quickly, seems sort of panicked. He looks ruffled up, with more of his hair out of his woollen hat, loose frizz of stray white-blond locks at either side of his temples, his eyes transfixed intensely at the snow-coated ground in front of him.
Harry remembered not seeing him there, an empty chair at the Slytherin table, thinking that their final day of NEWTs would have been the last he'd ever see of him.
Hours later, he found Malfoy kneeling at the fireplace, his mother's face green in the fire as he said, urgent and frantic,
"You must hate this," Draco said, stilted and thick and raspy, on another day. The illness had only just waned.
This might be… the most bizarre and surreal day he had ever had, and that was saying a
"Bit of a delayed realisation, wouldn't you say," Draco says, coldly.
"Oh there you are! I found you." Harry says, in feigned relief, rushing over to him along with Ron, taking him up by the underarms from Ginny and kissing his head. Teddy squeals, belly-laughing so hard he's folding over, his tiny fists clenching and his face scrunching up. Ron lets out an exaggerated puff next to him, touching Teddy's back. "I found you."
Harry takes him by the face, surprises him with a kiss, Draco’s brows high and eyes closed.

She'll force them into doing their homework and studying for upcoming tests, or at least she will to Harry on the latter, trying to persuade him to begin preparing for his NEWTs
And then Potter appears, as if from behind a cloak falling off. He raises one hand, the other holding the now visible cloak to his abdomen. "Sorry. It's just me."
Draco turned back to the camera, and looked right at him where he was, right now.
"I told her I need time," Harry says. He doesn't look at him when he does. He knows it's the wrong thing to say.
"He doesn't want to be found." She smiles, contrite and rueful.
"You're reminded of them here. I know it hurts and scares you."
Draco slowly settles down on the chair once he's forced his mind blank and decides to write a response letter to his mother. Her last owl had been yesterday, asking him of his well-being, of his classes, sending him homemade desserts. She'd asked about Potter as well, as she did in every letter.
Malfoy exhaled out a shudder of a breath, and then he looked away, his shoulders hunching as if he was carrying boulders on them, just like the Malfoy of these past months, a far cry from the once confident and arrogant man that had always had his chin held up.
"Where'd you go, Teddy?"
I really don't know how much longer I can take trying to tell her that you're fine just as you were yesterday, and the day before that,
"Then keep saying these things."
"Okay," Harry says. They are the only ones there now, and his grin breaks across his face, reciprocating Draco’s. "Okay. See you at seven, then?"
Harry stares at him, still feeling short of air, still that horrible, crushing fear running through him, of what one moment turned the wrong way could have led to. That he might not have seen this day, and Draco, at all.
Harry didn't think he could
The last memory he has of this Manor is of flooing in to find his mother sat in the living room. He remembers her bemused sort of joy upon the sight of him, putting her wine glass away as she stood from the sofa. He remembers being tired in a way that seemed deeper than a need for sleep, crossing the weary steps towards her as he fell, more than anything, into her arms.
"Ah. Ron?" Harry waves a hand in front of his face.
Harry touches his fingers to his skin, runs them over a rib. They falter, unexpected, at the raise of smooth tissue, tremble there. He's looking closer now, and maybe he's seeing them, the hints of them everywhere. Everywhere under ink, a scar. A reminder of that reality, and that past. He looks wrecked, eyes going red-rimmed and pinched, jaw clenching. He shakes his head.
Pansy once says, smirking at him, her perfect eyebrow arched. It's been a joke with her, when they were fourteen and fifteen, sixteen, her trying to goad him and rile him into talking about Potter so he wouldn't be so quiet and withdrawn all the time. She looks at him now like she did then, with a sort of shadow of fear and worry in her eyes, silently examining him.
" Draco jerked his hand out of his grip. "I am the bloody host. I can't just up and leave! What would people think?"
Harry takes his wand out and casts another warming charm, rubbing his hands together to wring out its heat.
Harry stepped closer. Malfoy followed his movement with his eyes, very still. "I'd rather risk it than live twenty years of a life that I don't want, because the only other option we have is to live in this
"Yeah," Harry said, trying not to look like all he wanted in that moment, with a terrible desperation, was to kiss him, to have Draco kiss him back just the same way. "Okay."
Harry frowned, but he remained quiet.
Harry stroked his thumb at his jaw. "Yeah. I suppose it is."
Narcissa tipped her head, all slow and subtle grace. "Harry," she said, and twitched a polite smile.
call me Harry, you know."
He still has his drawings and notes and letters, tucked away in a locked drawer, that he doesn't think he can ever open again, but the space weighs with it all whenever he looks at it. There's a part of him that thinks,
"Of course," Harry said. "Why?"
Draco's breaths is heavy in his chest, held in his throat. His eyes are heavy-lidded, a mellow frown in his forehead, not unlike the way he'd looked when he told Harry
Draco looks at him. "No, I didn't." A beat. "Did you?"
He wonders if he'd only dreamed it all.
The trains are halted still on the rail tracks, the smell of smoke filtering through the air. People pass by on their way to them, cutting through his vision. Potter looks up at Weasley as he says something, his smile breaking into a grin crinkling at his gaze, glancing over at Granger to share his amusement.
That fear and desperation eventually dredged up in his dreams as well, and Harry woke up crying out, the ghost of loss following him back into the waking world. He'd dreamed of something terrible, fragmented into his worst fears. Two silver rings on a cold hand. A headstone, and his love's name on it.
"Globfish," Luna said, smiling against his shoulder. "They look very different when you put them in water."
"I don't care."
Draco takes a minute to look around for Annie and her parents. He finds them far across the parking lot, talking to another pair of parents. One of Annie's mothers, Maria, sees him and waves at him with a friendly smile.
He did say yes.
Harry stared at him. His mouth worked, the truth of the alteration heavy on his tongue. He saw the pallor of Draco's skin, the constant exhaustion in his face, and couldn't bring himself to speak at all.
He doesn't know what he's expecting Draco to say. He's expecting anger, perhaps, some sort of unhappiness on seeing him again. The way his last letter had gone, it seemed like it could be.
"She needs a bit more time to really, truly forgive me." Harry pulls a bit at the muffin wrap, idly. "But I think we'll be alright."
And he's on the verge of walking out of Harry's life forever, kissing him goodbye. He's standing in front of him by the Thestrals, coming back. And he's talking to him on magical coins, flying with him in the dead of nights on empty Quidditch fields, and he's trying to get better and be better. He's bringing him sweets and sending him ridiculous drawings in class and falling asleep under skies full of astronomy with him.
Harry hesitates, thinking of the Obliviation veiling away all the memories in them. "Yeah? I mean. You're sure?"
"Yes." Draco looked up at him then, his face slightly softening. "Go have your dinner."
Harry shook his head exasperatedly. "No, I
"The answer is rather clear, wouldn't you say," Malfoy said, dryly.
At some point Harry's eyes met with Draco's over the man's head, still nodding even though he was hardly hearing anything, desperately trying to be polite. He didn't know what he looked like, but even in his anger, Draco seemed to find it amusing, a tremor of a smirk playing at a corner of his mouth as he quickly broke the gaze, paying intent attention to the man speaking to him.
And so it goes, the two of them like strangers with histories, relearning the new people they were shaped into by the years.
"Frankly, it's not something within my specialty. Mind-Healers of a higher level would be more suited to help you with this, but there's no reason why you can't still talk to me about it."
She doesn't know anything about what transpired in the months they weren't together. He's been trying to move on with her these past few days, trying to remember everything he once loved about her, so he could feel what he felt for her back then.

Malfoy raised his gaze, meeting his. He shook his head, lips parted in his bewilderment. "I—I'm not sure."
above that
I have my examinations coming up in
"It's not... it's a risky procedure. Fairly modern as of yet. Fifty to sixty percent chances of success, and even then, there's always going to be
She laughs again, watery, pushing a hand through her sweat-damp hair. "He would... he'd always be trying so hard to make me laugh. And — and he
"I did feel ashamed though. After," Harry told her, wrapping both hands around his mug. "I mean,
His mouth opens, words perched on his tongue, thinks of telling her many things
For a moment, there's nothing. Ron just stares at him, unreadable. He doesn't seem surprised, or confused about who he is talking about, just a bit like he's got confirmation of something he wondered, didn't quite believe yet.
Draco shook his head. "I don't have that kind of money anymore."
The bed moves slightly as she sits up. The sheets rustle, and her clothes, as she buttons her shirt up. Then she scoots forward to sit beside him on the edge of the bed, hands planted onto it, shoulders a little high.
Harry swallows. His heart is pounding in his throat, body sweat-soaked and hot from the match and now something else entirely — fear. He turns to look at Ginny again, stepping back. Her face is very close and her hands are on his chest, smiling up at him. He's hardly breathing, under the rise of the crowd's cheers and screams. She puts her forehead to his.
"Malfoy." Harry leans against his car, elbow on the roof. "How can I help you?"
"I think you have every right."
"You're cute."
"I do love him, you know," Harry tells her. "More than I can even..."
But Draco loves him. Merlin, he does.
Harry shook his head. "But
Draco huffs a laugh. "Ask away."
"What is with you and all these questions?"
"No," Harry said, when his brain did unfreeze, and he understood Draco wasn't joking. He blinked hard, frowning, swallowed. He was trying to keep himself together, keep his mind away from the burn at the base of his throat. "No, I don't mind at all, I just — you think I'm — "
Before Harry headed upstairs, he bent down from behind the couch and gave Hermione a goodnight kiss on the cheek, Ron a pat on the shoulder as he passed him by. He heard the faint murmurs start up from the drawing room as he was trudging half-way up the steps, but couldn't muster enough energy to care about it much.
