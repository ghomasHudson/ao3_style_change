“Hmmmmm. . .” It tapped it’s claw against the ground, almost rolling it’s nails. “There is no one around.” Cedric was confused. “Around the building, his life, or. . .” he trailed off when seeing its smug expression.
“So… we just don’t say anything, then?” Harry asked. “Wait until he says something, if he ever does?”
“Well, it just means that whoever has it has a certain degree of power over the other gods of Asgard, ASGARD, not Assguard,” Hermione was getting tired of having to pronounce it.  “It makes the wielder more powerful, basically.”
“Answer me this riddle,” the sphinx said, ignoring the question. “A man walks into a room. In this order, he jumps off a building, the telephone rings, and he screams. Pray tell, why does this man scream?”
“And you didn’t think that the bracelet could belong to the only child of Persephone, whose mark is of pomegranate seeds? You didn’t think to ask someone who it might belong to?”
“Sounds super cheap to me,” Hermione said. “Mr. Lupin seems pretty worried. Getting everyone together and having a big quest seems pretty selfish for a god who needs help finding something. Oh well, it has happened a lot throughout history.”
Everyone’s faces were grim, and he remembered that this was going to be the most dangerous of tasks. No one knew yet, but the smell of dread compounded the Mess Hall, and brought down his good mood rapidly. Even Mr. Black was solemn.
“Well, now to tell you why we brought the camps together,” The trio leaned forward eagerly. “We, the leaders of each camp, have decided that it’s time to issue a quest.” The three began to breath heavily, their excitement reaching its peak. “A quest to find and retrieve Gungnir, Odin’s Spear.” Then the trio’s excitement flattened out.
He was suddenly spun around, and before he could react, he saw Draco grab the back of his neck and haul him down. His lips planted on Cedric, a bit rough, but not so that it hurt. He was surprised, not even registering it for the first few seconds, but when he did, it felt like magic sewing them together. Coming about himself, the older boy dragged the younger nearer by the waist,wrapping his arms around him in a tight embrace, and deepened the kiss. It was an act of longing and wanting to be close to each other. The kiss was filled with desperation and something almost like love. It was chaste, but deeper than an ocean, with them not needed to go further to convey their feelings for one another. Cedric felt explosions behind his eyes. Breaking away, their eyes stayed closed, as they remained in each other’s arms.
“This one will be especially dangerous. As you know, we have no shortages of beasts and creatures in our forest. We will be adding to that, a few more that belong to the Greeks, and a good amount from the Egyptian and Norse ‘myths’.” He put quotation fingers when saying myths. “So your trial for today is to go into the woods and upon the first creature you find, you will kill it.”
Hey, sorry for the late update, just some misunderstanding on mine and Kat's part of who was going to update. So we'll have this chapter posted today, and the next chapter tomorrow. Hope you enjoy both!
Boy of them took a breath. It was there out in the open, finally, but now, the blonde didn’t feel pressured to say it.
Crashing through the tree came what looked like a combination of a moose and a rhino. It was larger than a bear, covered in scales, and sporting a moose’s head and antlers. It’s mouth was filled with sharp teeth. Viktor told him that this thing was called a bilgesnipe. They lived somewhere called Asgard and were very dangerous. That’s all he could remember, and the thing charging at him with startling speed didn’t help jog his memory.
He quickly sat down next to Fleur, who had saved him a seat since he was the last one who needed to join.
He decided to try to figure out what she meant by the man being alone. Alone in what way? That could be pulled any which way, but none of which made sense for him to scream at a phone call.
“Yes, you were Ron, but what about us? He probably wanted to tell us in his own time, and the fact that we now know isn’t the best. Plus, if we told him we knew, it would be springing it on him before he was even ready.” Hermione was ever the voice of reason, and another silence ensued.
“Here’s the catch,” Mr. Black interrupted. “You will not be able to kill any from your own ‘myth’. For example,” he stood a bit straighter, and pointed to one from Camp Valhalla, “she will not be able to kill a bilgesnipe, nor will he,” he pointed to and Ares kid, “be able to kill a minotaur.” All their faces paled.
As he drifted off, his thoughts were filled with shiny blonde hair, sparkling grey eyes that could rival Athena’s, and plush, pink lips.
“Maybe Odin’s a camper?” Harry suggested, scratching his head. “I mean, it's a weird name, but maybe?”
Cedric backed into a nearby tree and took a quick breather. He wasn’t quite ready to be attacked just yet. His ears still rang from the harpy and he just realized his arms were shaking. Just to top it all off, he began to feel hopeless, like he would never make it out of the forest. His breathing got faster and more shallow. Cedric was sure he was hyperventilating. He felt lightheaded and saw spots.
He only had to wait about ten minutes till he could slip in alongside a group of fifth years, and he luckily found a large group of the younger students studying (chatting) together on one of the large tables, Millicent among them. Perfect, in his opinion. He hadn’t come here to
Hal didn’t know how long he stayed there, but it certainly was several hours later, when his butt was too sore, and he felt too cold and stiff, that he finally got up and walked semi-automatically back to his dorm. As he slipped into bed, the only thing that prevented him from breaking into tears out of sheer loneliness, was Silver’s soft little paws as he walked on him to finally settle warmly in the crook of his neck.
“I don’t know.” She confessed, her voice apologetic. “You know how I didn’t… I wasn’t really in touch with Lily, at the time.”
Hal raised an eyebrow again. “You won a dragon egg at cards? What, some bloke with a gambling problem just happened to have one lying around in his pocket?”
Just outside the common room, however, he almost ran into Luna Lovegood, who seemed to have just started reading the riddle that would, if answered right, grant her access. Her lower face was covered in blood, clearly from a nosebleed that had been carelessly smudged across her cheeks.
) as she waved her wand again, over him this time. He felt the pressure beneath his temples ease up a little. Not much, but it was something.
“Did Gryffindor have the ability to speak to lions?” Hal blurted out dazedly. He realised it was a stupid question even as it left his mouth, but it had just popped into his head as he was trying to take in and process everything else.
For a moment they didn’t speak, as they both attached their letters to the leg of an owl, and sent them on their way. Harry’s would go to a regional centre that connected to the Muggle posting system, Draco had learnt through Hermione. Not that he had asked. You usually only needed to be in a two meter range of her to learn something, really.
“I don’t know about Hal.” Pan eventually got her answer, from Hermione, once she’d stopped ranting about
“Yeah, sorry if that has lost some of its novelty for me.” He told his cousin. “Been on the news for twelve years.”
“Harry.” A tone of despair was back in the man’s voice. “I know what you must have heard. And I’m not going to disrespect James and Lily by saying none of it was my fault. I convinced them to make Peter their Secret Keeper instead of me.”
He lifted his hair to get this over with. He knew what it looked like – the sunken skin like a great big crack on his temple, healed but still somehow an angry red. The smaller, raised branches crackling away from the main long jagged scar. It covered most of the right side of his face, which looked – as Ley had nicely put it once – like it had been cracked open and pushed together again. It wasn’t a fluke that he’d grown his hair to cover it. He hated it.
Draco couldn’t help but take a step back, because though Flint’s attitude had somewhat changed from the snarling brawny teen who was never wasting an occasion to shove and punch him the year before (and that certainly had something to do with the fact that, Flint himself having repeated a year, most of his mates had now left school, leaving him behind to finish seventh year a lot more on his own), there still was something predatory in his stance.
“And, Hal, darling.” She added, in her best parenting voice. “You know it’s not your job to fix this, don’t you?”
Again, Draco thought he wasn’t wrong. Some of the visions had been truly horrible, even to the rest of the audience, so for the student whose greatest fear it actually was, to see it embodied in front of them… Anthony’s in particular had been rattling – his little sister, lying on the ground with a trickle of blood seeping from her lips and glassy eyes, her neck clearly broken. Anthony had roared “NO” and quickly cast the spell, making the little figure jump up with a giggle and skip about repeating “Pranked you, pranked you!”, which had made Anthony laugh, but Draco knew the scene had still shaken him badly.
“Probably waiting for this extremely awkward conversation to be over.” He said. “Dobby, you can come in.”
at Christmas? All piled up on the boy who was one of the most famous wizards alive, it seemed too much to be a simple coincidence.
“3e sexe” is a rather progressive song from 1985 and there’s a new version Nicola Sirkis (the Indochine singer) made with Christine and the Queens which startled me at first then really grew on me, I think it’s great :)
One of the new arrivals was Luna, so they went up to her to see what that had been about. Another girl was crying, and the whole group seemed pretty shaken. Before they could ask Luna, however, one of the older students among the newcomers hopped on a table.
behind a door a simple unlocking spell will open, so forgive me if I don’t exactly count that as proof that there is nothing to worry about.”
1.	Okay so Draco’s not very kind to Hagrid, but come on, he is a bit of an idiot when it comes to magical creatures.
It had not been an easy sell, though Fred and George had praised Hal’s natural talent to Professor McGonagall with all their might, she had held strong for a long time. In the end, it was only because the current Seeker had gotten involved that the situation had changed.
“Unless they’ve lived under a rock.” He answered. “Or in the Muggle world, I suppose. They discussed putting you in chocolate frogs, but then thought you were too young.”
Draco seemed satisfied with his purchases as well, and he looked happy enough that Hal decided to stop worrying about the bruise – he’d tried to pry a truthful answer out of him a few times, because he didn’t believe he’d just tripped and fallen flat on his face, he had more poise than that, but Draco wouldn’t give away anything. He didn’t seem to be afraid of going back home with his mother, at any rate, so Hal supposed it was good enough for now.
There was definitely a voice, Hal could hear it clearly even if Ron and Hermione were straining their ears and shaking their heads. It was moving away, and Hal started after it.
“He must be with someone.” Hal seized the chance for a polite way out, even though he thought the dog looked rather like a stray. “We shouldn’t-”
Woopsie doops, they went back in time and changed things so Hal never had the realisation he wanted to kiss Draco and officially like him back. Afraid it’ll take him a little longer to get there! But don’t you worry, it is most definitely in the cards. In fact, since I don’t know when I’ll be able to write Book 4, let alone the rest of it, here is a long-term spoiler to soothe your soul in the meantime: they will get married one day. Because neither of them have a father, they will ask their respective godfathers to give them away. There will be wedding planning involved. Sirius and Severus will have to get along. It will be epic.
“Oh, you gonna cry, mouth-breather?” The older kid was telling the little girl. “Are those tears behind your horrible glasses?”
“I said, get out.” Petunia repeated. “You are a guest here, and you are behaving like you own the place. Well, you don’t, and you are not longer welcome.”
“It is a bit.” Hal said quietly, looking back at the dog, who was happily catching the Frisbee Ley was throwing him. “I guess dogs can be really clever, right? We were looking for Birch trees when playing the other day. Maybe he understood.”
“So I looked at the teachers’ stand, and several of them were talking so it was hard to tell if it was just conversation or cursing, but I am pretty sure I saw Professor Quirrell and Professor Snape looking straight at you.”
“If it helps.” Draco said hesitantly. “They were mostly just arguing if it was really you, and saying you’re cute.”
Confused murmurs rippled across the room, leaving rise to panicked voices, and soon even screams of fear. Teachers were on their feet, making fruitless calming gestures, while some students started scrambling off the benches with no plan of what to do next.
Draco did not think Harry Potter would be in his house – he didn’t see anything else but Slytherin for himself, and he knew most of the Potters had been Gryffindors. That might make being friends a little challenging, between those two houses especially, but Draco did not mind a challenge.
“Hal, no, don’t go there.” He understood immediately. “There was nothing obvious about this. You couldn’t have known.”
Draco reeled from the several different pieces of information in that statement, and decided to take them one at a time.
Petunia had met James Potter exactly twice in her life. The first time, when Lily was thirteen, and they had gone to pick her up from the train station – their parents had insisted to ‘make a day of it’ and dragged Petunia along. They weren’t even friends at the time, Lily and James, although it appeared the latter already had a crush on the former. Petunia saw the boy as nothing else but an unruly, unmanageable child, who had been shouting from the other end of the platform at her sister (‘See you next year, Evans! My heart will remain yours forever! Write to me!’).
It was getting creepier by the minute, and Hal was now pretty convinced he was going to end up in a doll. Or locked in his room and drugged up, which wasn’t much better.
“Keep it safe, though.” George added. He mirrored his earlier movement of tapping the map with with wand, this time claiming proudly: “Mischief managed.”
-	Nolan Gould (think Luke from Modern family) is exactly how I picture Dudley in this verse, both as a kid and teenager (except not American)
Draco had not particularly been looking forward to going to Hogwarts before. He liked teaching himself from the books in his family’s extensive library. His mother often took him on her visits to other families, so Draco knew most of his future classmates already. Some of them were alright, but Draco felt like seeing them every now and again was enough – he had not made close friends out of any of them, though he’d been told many times this tended to happen easily within your house at school.
money, to him it was just something for his aunt to manage, and something that would help when he was an adult, his family’s inheritance, like everyone else. But the mounds of gold in that vault, that was another story.
the latter – a particularly vicious spell from McGonagall that seemed to give her a lot of satisfaction.
“I’m just saying it sounded more like a gang feud than what we would call a war.” Hermione said, oblivious to his distress. “Only going by the scale of it.”
“Don’t get on your high horse.” She said with a teasing smile. “You’re right, and there’s no chance he’ll get away with this. I was just hoping, for your sakes, he’d just plead guilty and you wouldn’t have to go through all that.”
“He’s noticed, you know.” Neville added. “You’ve been distant, and a bit… off. Even after the whole thing with Flint. He worries.”
“Another witness for your case is already here.” She told them after she’d gone through most of the details. She saw Hal frown, and perhaps misinterpreted it. “But we can keep you separated if you do not wish to see him.” She added. “Severus Snape?”
He didn’t. He stumbled out of a fireplace, and quickly realised it couldn’t have been much worse as he recognised Filch’s office. He had never been in there, but the three taxidermied cats in pride of place on the mantelpiece, surrounding a large photo of a snarling Mrs Norris, kind of gave it away.
I can’t remember in the series when Harry actually finds out about the prophecy, but I figured people must have known enough to understand that the Potters were targeted for a reason… so he knows the “power to vanquish the Dark Lord” part, but obviously the part about how “neither can live while the other survives” is not public knowledge.
Draco caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror when they entered the bar, and he didn’t look anything noteworthy either. Only the body Pansy was in was striking, really, tall and muscular but lean, with sharp blue eyes and dark brown hair. She seemed to be loving it, too, as she directed them to sit down and act like they belonged there and weren’t twelve, ordering and being served like she owned the place.
He peered behind his aunt, and could only see an empty bed through the gap in the curtains, so Ron must have gone.
“Good talk.” Hal interrupted with a grin. “Let’s have it again when I’m a professional Quidditch player and you’re a professional nutritionist.”
“People say it like I’m meant to feel closer to them, because they probably sat in the same chair fifteen years ago.” He carried on, his voice small. “But I don’t. They’re dead, and I don’t have any memories of them.”
“What better way to reinject some spirit and bravery into our students!” Lockhart carried on enthusiastically. “Of course, this matter will be solved in no time, as I have several ideas as to how to deal with it, but in the meantime, it cannot do any harm for every boy and girl to feel a little safer.”
In spite of that, he woke up in a start after what felt like no rest at all, feeling nauseous. The dormitory was quiet, the other boys’ steady breathing telling him they were all asleep. He grabbed his glasses and his wand on the bedside table, and cast a quick spell Hermione had taught him to tell the time – it was seventeen minutes past midnight.
They were allowed to see him for a few minutes, though he was out of it, before they were kindly, but firmly told to go home, sleep, and come back in the morning. Hal tried to argue it was already morning, because it was getting on 1am by the time they were pushed out of the hospital, but that didn’t really work.
“Intra, something.” Hal replied. “It’s not a spell I know, I can’t remember the word, but it was something like that-” he waved his hand in a loopy fashion to indicate the wand movement “-and it made ropes appear and ties us down.”
Draco quickly attempted to walk back the other way, but sitting in the middle like a king, Flint spotted him.
“Mate, I’m sure they’ll understand, we’re not five.” Hal assessed. “I mean, I’ll avoid making a big deal of it, but we’re not going to keep it a secret or anything, right?”
As for the Gryffindors, he didn’t know which of spending the rest of the month with a million Weasleys, stuck between Longbottom and his grandmother, or in a Muggle home, appealed less. Not that he had any idea where they lived. While his friendship with that lot had grown steadily throughout the year, they’d not actually exchanged addresses.
Hal had his phone in his bag and for a minute he thought of calling his aunt, but it was Tuesday morning, she would be in work. Besides, he didn’t really want her to hear him in this state – she would fret. She had always fretted whenever Ley or Hal had been sick in the past, worrying too much in their opinion, until they had understood that both their grandparents had died of flu, and it was harmless to let her fret if it made her feel better.
Remus closed his eyes briefly, feeling a crushing sense of foreboding. Twelve, barely thirteen years of peace was too short to face the prospect of living through this again.
Hal shrugged, unwilling to get into it, and used the excuse of being distracted by Lupin opening the wardrobe where the Boggart was held and the practical class starting in earnest.
“Me too, fawn.” Sirius’ smile turned pained and sad, though only for a second. “They would have absolutely adored you, you’d have been spoilt rotten, probably even worst than James was.”
“I simply wanted to ask how you’re holding up.” Dumbledore said kindly. “See if there is anything you would like to share, or ask me.”
He wasn’t going to give Flint the satisfaction of looking scared or asking him to step back. He was still expecting to get punched, but Flint leaned right into Draco’s personal space, and his voice dropped to a conspiratorial tone.
“Yeah, same as Christmas.” Pan nodded. “Staying with Blaise is always a bit dodgy, though he’s offered, but otherwise Mrs Malfoy and Mr and Mrs Goldstein have said I’m welcome to stay with them.”
“I’m sure he’s been raised to think a very specific way about it.” Hermione construed. “Maybe it’s weird for him to discuss it so casually.”
He sent an apologetic look towards Neville, who shrugged. The first time they’d discussed how the person responsible for pretty much making Nev an orphan was Draco’s aunt, it had been painful. Now, they were acting like it was all water under the bridge and they were over it. Totally over it.
Ron had never really said anything, and Hal had never really thought about it, but now he did, he could see all the little clues, and really it made sense, having to raise seven children on one salary – Hal didn’t think Molly worked, and fair enough, even with magic to help around, she must have her hands full keeping up that household.
“Good.” Hal answered. “I think I told you he’s got good news a few weeks ago, they’ve established he wasn’t guilty of… well, the whole thing. They’re moving on to actually prosecuting Pettigrew, the other guy, so that will still take a while, but at least he’s officially cleared. He’s found a flat in London, temporarily. His lawyer is still working on getting him all his assess back plus possibly some compensation.”
“Yeah, so get this.” Hal told him with newfound energy again. “We went into that weird bank right, so your mom could change some money, and they were these little goblins everywhere…”
There were quite a few other Hogwarts students Draco recognised, and very few who weren’t Slytherins. In fact, Draco did not spot a single Ravenclaw – though maybe some of the young adults who had recently finished school had been in that House. There were a few of kids he thought he’d seen in yellow, and a scattering of Gryffindors, though the rest of their family had to otherwise be strongly vocal about Pureblood ideals for them to be welcome here.
“It’s not a silly thing!” Hal argued. “And it’s not without consideration either. And I’ll find out how much money I have and how it compares, alright? I’m sure I can find out.”
“But you can’t catch it too soon.” Oliver carried on as if he hadn’t spoken – which was probably for the best. “We’re two hundred points down. If you end the game before we’ve closed the gap, we’ll lose.”
Hermione did know quite a lot about Hogwarts, and the wizarding world at large, for someone who hadn’t been born into it. Hal gathered quite quickly that she just loved to read, and hated being uninformed. He himself wasn’t particularly booksmart, and hadn’t had the curiosity to go past leafing through a couple of his school books, so he listened to her running commentary as they made their way through the train, looking for a compartment to sit in.
“I don’t think this is… me.” She said. “For a long time now, I’ve felt like… There’s been a mistake. I was given the wrong body. A girl body.” She added, almost in a whisper.
(another spell he’d mastered like it wasn’t something you learnt in 6th year and that wizards only tended to really start using once they were overage and had to leave the nest) and the fire looked under control. A corner of the roof and connecting wall had caved in, but the house seemed to be otherwise standing, though significantly singed in a few places.
There were a few pockets of discontent, namely among Slytherins, who theorised Hal had orchestrated the whole thing as a great ploy to make himself look good. Hal decided again not to rise to any of it – he didn’t feel like he had the energy anyway. Madam Pomfrey had warned him and Draco that it would still be a little while before they felt completely normal, and there was nothing but time that would allow their cores to fully heal and replenish. On top of that, Hal’s first night of sleeping without a spell or potion had been dreadful – he couldn’t go to sleep, then he couldn’t stay asleep, then he’d had nightmares and, all in all, had barely slept a wink.
The Hat at least seemed to have a hard time of it, talking to itself inside Hal’s head as he carefully kept his mind blank. In the end, when Gryffindor prevailed, he found he actually was quite happy about that; the lion seemed to be the coolest emblem out of the four, and two of the three people he’d met so far were in that house – Ron hadn’t been sorted yet, but he had seemed as sure of it as his name was Weasley.
And finally getting a good look at Hal. He seemed a little taller again, already, and his skin had taken a soft caramel colour that did unspeakable things to Draco’s imagination. He turned away again, hoping they couldn’t see him blush, and gestured towards the Manor.
“Halley’s comet.” Hal explained. “Cause he’s called Ley. Well, Dudley. So people called us Halley. Like the comet.”
This time, Hal felt like the wood was warm, calling something inside him, and he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
A knot in his stomach, Hal realised that in all the commotion, the ten-year anniversary of his parent’s death had gone right past him. As soon as the realisation hit, Hal knew he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, not as long as his heart was beating that hard in his chest. He sat up on the edge of his bed, trying to breathe deeply and ward off the beginning what was promising to be a cracking headache.
She looked on the verge of tears, but that clearly didn’t soften Pan’s reaction, whose nostrils flared.
Ley wasn’t at all a wimp about pain. He picked himself up and barrelled on, and it took a lot for him to even admit he was in pain. He’d once walked miles on a broken ankle, when Hal and him had been exploring and he’d landed badly when climbing down (falling off) a tree. So when, hours after he’d first complained and a little while after claiming he felt better for a bit, he started crying in pain, Petunia knew it wasn’t just indigestion and she called an ambulance.
“I could take him?” It suddenly occurred to Hal. “We’re allowed pets at Hogwarts, there’s everything there to take care of them as so many students have animals. And then we’ll both be here to take care of him during the holidays.”
Hal wasn’t entirely sure how they’d all ended up lying on what felt like a shrubbery, looking up at a small square of light up ahead. Well, all but Rolf. Hal thought that was how they’d ended up there. Anthony’s cousin had said something like “I can play the flute” and pushed them all into the gaping trap door, which was closer than the exit out of the room. Or, at least, not currently barred by a lot of big fangs. Either way – they had not been eaten by a giant dog, which Hal would count as a small victory.
They went back into the kitchen in barely controlled chaos, Sirius miraculously managing not to drop any of the stuff he was still holding until he could put it down on the table while Petunia filled a vase. He presented a bottle of wine to her as well and a football shirt for Ley, from his favourite club.
“He didn’t quite go as far as diagrams.” He moderated. “But yeah, I know, it’s difficult magic, and I should be glad I can even conjure anything, blah, blah.”
“I’ve heard that too.” Neville backed her up. “But from there to say that he was trying to throw Hal off his broom, isn’t it a bit of a stretch?”
His teeth clenched, Hal was almost in too much pain to retort with a barb of any kind, but he’d be damned if he let that smug bastard have the last word.
It was true, though he decided not to mention he’d never felt pain like he felt through his scar at the time. The headache was gone now, there was no need to worry her even more.
“Fine.” Snape snapped. “I get it, you want to be his friend. How do you know he won’t become a bully?”
The game was aggressive. Both team were playing heavy on the attack, neither of them on the back-foot, and Hal and Draco were whizzing across the field trying to spot the Snitch, while keeping an eye on each other – and on the score. The point difference mattered to both teams, and Ollie had warned Hal (with threats of painful death) not to end the game too soon.
“You’re right.” Draco sighed. “He should know. Well, he should know that much. I don’t want to be kicking myself for not telling him if something happens to him again.”
On the day of the game itself, however, Hal found he was nervous. The fact that there was an audience now, and that somewhere in that audience could be someone cursing his broom again was, quite honestly, putting him off his game. He didn’t know if that same uneasy feeling was spreading to the rest of the team, or if it was down to the absolutely shocking weather they were faced with, but Gryffindor spent the first half of the game playing the worst Quidditch they had ever played, or so it felt.
“The details are getting more and more ridiculous from one version to the next.” Draco shrugged. “I don’t think anyone really cares that it doesn’t make sense. The bottom line is: you’re a hero.”
“Fair point.” Dora sighed. “If that makes you feel better, there are still some supporters of his out there, but he’s definitely no longer flavour of the month. Most people are rooting for you. Some stores have even stopped selling his books.”
“Who cares, we won!” Fred (maybe George) clasped Hal’s shoulder. “The unshakeable little bugger caught the Snitch!”
“Please hear me out.” He’d said immediately, holding his hands up. He was holding a biscuit tin in one of them, which Petunia had thought was odd. Was that his idea of a gift you present someone when both their parents die? Did wizards do that?
Hal wasn’t sure he agreed with that, but he only answered with another groan, and inwardly resolved to never, ever, under any circumstances, give Lockhart any indication that he was quite good at drawing, in case he actually got the same idea as Hermione.
Hal sat up against the wall and picked it up gratefully. Unlike his sleep patterns, his appetite was as healthy as a thirteen year old boy’s should be.
“But what strong moment did I…” He started saying, thinking out loud, before snapping his mouth shut abruptly.
He stayed like that for several seconds, as if keen to give the opportunity to someone to take a photo. Which was when Hal realised, the two wizards who had been sitting at a table behind him were, in fact, and journalist and his photographer, and sprung up to buzz around Lockhart, who waved at them like he was greeting old friends.
“Alright.” The headmaster finally got out of his chair, after a moment, and walked Hal to the door as Hal jumped to his feet. “Don’t hesitate to come and see me if you ever want to talk.” He offered.
Neville had gotten Anthony a miniature greenhouse containing four different plants, which he explained one by one: the leaves of one would glow in the dark if you blew on them, making it a convenient night light when Lumos was a bit too bright, or when outside of school and a permission spell; the roots of another would calm any itch when grounded with spring water; a third was just mean to be air-cleansing, so good to keep by your bedside, and also just, pretty; and the last, which had what seemed like millions of tiny spikes, could be used to season food – it was a bit like salt, with a bit of an earthy, smoky flavour.
“Sure.” Draco nodded. He had no idea if Severus knew anything at all about these things, but he certainly would be able to provide at least some moral support. He did feel very protective of his snakes. “Yeah, we can go talk to him when we’re back.”
He’d never heard that before – unsurprisingly, Muggleborns being rarely discussed at all in his circles – but it was interesting. It made sense. He
Ley has insisted to come and see him off, and Petunia had decided to take advantage of being in London for the day, taking him shopping and for a spot of lunch before heading back to Surrey.
The Potions Master had just finished examining him – with spell-casting, to Pan’s relief it had never involved more invasive or intimate checks – following another course of the Transition potions.
Draco thought congratulations were in order, ludicrous as the whole thing had been, and he was on his way up to his room to fetch a box of dark chocolate honeycomb – his mother had sent him that, and he loved the treats, he’d been saving them for a special occasion, and… well, giving them to Hal in those circumstances seemed like a special enough occasion – when he ran into a group of Slytherins.
“He’s carried a torch for the new Seeker since second year.” Fred informed Hal at the end of one training session.
“It isn’t something I’m saying because I’m looking for congratulations or commiseration.” She added. “It’s just who I am. And I’m telling you because…” She took another deep breath, as if that was somehow just as hard to say. “You’re my friends.”
“Right, well.” Draco sighed to the remaining three – Vince, Greg and Theo. “I should probably head back before curfew anyway. I’ll see you guys around.”
“I didn’t think so either.” Hermione nodded. “So… Quirrell.” She gave Hal a pointed look. “Your scar hurt before in his class, several times. And I saw you clutching your head up there.”
“He’s the best Seeker in the world.” He told them all with conviction. “It's a foregone conclusion.”
“Okay.” He could hear the smile in his aunt’s voice, and she sounded satisfied with his promise. “You stay safe, darling.”
“What does it mean?” Another boy came forward. He snatched Draco’s bag off his shoulder. “Isn’t that in your books, little Ravenclaw bookworm?”
The girl behind the desk gave him a pinched smile – he knew his tone was dry and entitled, maybe he’d need to work on that, but he couldn’t give a toss right now, he was not exactly having a good day – and looked at the address.
He was almost smirking, and Hal took a deep breath to remain calm. It would only help the man’s case if he started kicking off, exasperated as he was.
He didn’t let Hal get away with his odd behaviour, however, and grabbed his elbow once they were back out of the shop.
“Thanks.” Hal forced himself to grit out between his teeth, hoping with all his might that something, anything would happen between now and the end of the year so that Lockhart wouldn’t be teaching the year after that.
They repeated their introductions, expressions of mistrust and non-promises of friendship when Hermione and Ron found them, but Draco’s friends – and he marvelled a little at that – seemed to just accept that Pan was going to be part of their group now, sometimes, maybe.
She showed her Hal and Ley, making an enormous racket at the other side of the room, playfully shoving each other around the machine, sharing the commands and shouting really loudly every time (presumably) something happened in the game.
“They call themselves the Marauders.” Fred informed. “Clearly illustrious pranksters of times past.”
She walked away, and Hal wanted to tell her not to go, but Nils’ other hand was suddenly on his hip, and he couldn’t say a word. The boy kissed him again, soft but insistent, and Hal could feel the tip of his tongue this time. He drew back again, smiling, lovely as anything.
Draco gathered himself before Hal, and before the troll could fully turn back to where it had perceived one of its prey had moved, shot a stinging hex towards it. It didn’t have quite enough range and sloped downwards to land on its foot, and didn’t seem to have much effect at all, except in drawing the monster’s attention to the two of them.
to be here. Maybe not all of them, but she had a strong sense that it was all either a lure or a test for Hal, specifically. She had called him paranoid, but things were adding up, and it was entirely possible Quirrell
It had only been three days, he didn’t see the point of acting tough and proud. He’d almost been poisoned to death by a mythical serpent and Obliviated by a teacher. He was allowed a bit of downtime.
Draco was pretty sure his father would have been of the opinion that bettering yourself included getting rid of your silly crush on a school friend. In that, at least, Draco agreed with Tom – nobody had to know, least of all Hal himself. He’d decided not to mention the diary to him either.
“Well, you’re only kids.” Dora winced. “Underage witnesses are more easily made to look unreliable.”
“Exactly.” Draco said, sweet and threatening. “In my House. So I’m sure you will understand that I have taken an interest in her safety.”
Hermione had a pout, but she didn’t push. She was, after all, very protective of anyone’s phobias (alongside inclinations, identity, psyche, you name it) within her ongoing campaign that mental health was something that was too often ignored and should be more cared for.
Or: fancy that, the sword Hal had wielded was apparently the sword of Gryffindor himself – which actually did great things to dispel the remaining rumours that Hal might be the Heir of Slytherin. Some started speculating he might be the Heir of Gryffindor, and Hal decided to just ignore all of it. They also discovered that Riddle had used his compulsion on Draco to leave another message on the wall before getting him to drag Hal down to the Chamber:
had not reported on that, surely due to Ministry pressures, but Draco knew very well that was the case – he’d overheard as much from several politicians at one of his mother’s “social” gatherings, earlier in the summer.
“As soon as we possibly could.” Hermione confirmed, claiming the chair next to him and taking his hand. “Oh, I’ve taken notes in all classes for the past two weeks, so you won’t-”
And she ran off again, leaving Draco completely astonished. He shook himself, and set out to get the rest of their friends. He didn’t think it would be that hard to drag them away from celebrating their Quidditch win, once he’d told them what Hermione had found out.
He swung it over his head, and it took him several tries to properly remember the spell Anthony had used the previous year (Aloha? Aloarma? Alohara? What
It started with a sharp pain in his head, right behind his scar, like he hadn’t felt in weeks. This time around, it almost felt like it came with a feeling, clashing with the good-humoured cheers and cries of encouragement he could still hear around him. Something like hatred.
Hermione had had what she deemed a perfectly normal and pleasant Christmas, and what Anthony deemed a very boring-sounding one. Every time she described something – the tree, the presents, the crackers, the pudding – he marvelled at how everything was so
Hal had been personally informed of Pettigrew’s escape, but they also had to make an announcement to the whole school since Dementors were on their way to once again be posted around the castle.
Anthony was startled into a laugh. “Well.” He said. “I’m sure he wouldn’t have minded helping, but he’s pretty rubbish at those. On the other hand.” He added with a grin. “My mom’s pretty good with hair-cutting scissors, if you don’t mind going at it the Muggle way.”
When the spell returned nothing, Draco grabbed to book and brought it back to the study to look at it in natural light, leaving the rest of the room to potential future exploration – for now, he pushed back the shelves, which clicked shut seamlessly. You’d never suspect they were anything but shelves.
Ley cried out in surprise and delight at nearly everything, and while it made Hal laugh he couldn’t really judge, he remembered being in the same situation, he knew the feeling. The only time he fell silent was when Hal took him to his vault. Ley’s mouth opened and closed silently for a long minute before he was able to breathe out the words
Hal hummed thoughtfully, looking at the corridor they started walking through – since the stairs had fucked off again, leaving them with no way down in the direction they’d just come from.
In the end, Dumbledore would be taking Pettigrew to the Ministry where the Aurors would make an official arrest. Sirius had to surrender himself to them as well, awaiting a proper examination of the testimonies and evidence so his name could be clear, and he went with obvious reluctance but also Dumbledore’s assurance that he would not let anything happen to him. Lupin wanted to come with them, but the Headmaster kindly reminded him of his teaching duties. That seemed to echo with McGonagall, who started shepherding the students back out to their common rooms.
And with that, he opened fire with a quick firework spell that whizzed past the troll’s head and popped behind it, causing it to turn his massive head long enough for Anthony to dash and disappear into the alcove – so much for no sudden movements.
Draco Malfoy had been raised as a prince until he was six years old, and he had firmly believed up to that point that wealth and reputation, of which his family had plenty, meant you were unattainable, and nothing bad could really happen to you. It had been true for a while. When he was six years old, however, he had had to realise that Death did not care how much money, nobility and influence you had - He would come for you if you found yourself in the way of an explosive curse concealed inside a tin of Gummy Dragons. After his father had died in the attack on the ministry, the terrorist had been caught and, incidentally, the sweets discontinued, Draco started to realise that there were different ways in which to be fortunate.
“And ‘a swear, ‘a swear.” Hagrid shook his head. “Aragog never hurt a soul, he didn’t. He was just a lil’ one. Teaching him to speak, I was.”
“You are soft.” Marge snarled. “You’ve let him trick you, a delinquent posing as a helpless boy, you-”
“She approached him, apparently.” His aunt replied. “On Valentine’s day, she gave him a card. They talked, he invited her to the cinema, then they seemed to both decide it had been a date.”
Then, to his surprise, Hal reached out and took his hand, and with a serious look, asked him to start from the beginning. So Draco did – he told him about the bullying from the previous year, and the turn it had taken lately. He told him about his latest encounter with Flint, just before the game, and how that was why Hal had gotten hurt.
“For a remarkable game of chess with extremely high stakes, and for putting himself in the front line rather than his friends, fifty points to Ronald Weasley.”
“Professor Lockhart, what drove you to such a selfless act? And Mister Potter, do you feel grateful that a Professor of such influence as Professor Lockhart would personally accompany you?”
“Yeah.” Hal nodded. “He said he had loads of stories, but I don’t think he wants to put them in letters. I’ll have to wait till I can see him again and spend time with him.”
“It’s practically in his blood.” The boy smirked. “Lucius Malfoy was such a proud supporter of the Dark Lord.”
Even briefly entertaining the possibility it could be a ghost (how many ghosts were in the castle that they didn’t know about?) at least served the purpose of distracting him as he remembered Halloween was getting near.
“Are you kidding?” Ron spoke up, having swallowed enough of the food stuffed in his mouth to leave space for words. “It’s amazing! I’ll go with you.”
Lupin wasn’t forcing anyone to face the Boggart in front of the whole class, though those who chose not to would have to hand in an extra foot of parchment, to at least give the theory of what shape they thought the Boggart would have taken and what they would have done to counter it. The professor had promised these revelations would remain entirely confidential and that he was there to talk if anyone wanted to discuss something specific with him. Draco was still not about to tell the truth – he’d make up something about being terribly afraid of bees, or something as plausibly mortifying if it were to be revealed in front of classmates, yet not so damaging for his teacher to know.
Hal thanked the man for his help in a bit of a daze, and they left the bank after he’d collected some of that staggering amount of money from his vault – the sight of the piles of coins, that had left him so excited the first time, now made him feel a little sick.
“This is the absolute truth.” Anthony put a hand over his heart, though his voice was shaking with laughter. “My father’s cousins in America were directly involved. Of course Rolf will probably tell you otherwise, but he’s a little biased because he worships the ground his grandfather walks on.”
“It’s there.” Hal nodded, before realising how stupid that sounded. “I mean, I didn’t get to use it much, obviously, but it feels strong. Back to normal.”
“How come you’re not already there?” Anthony was the one to ask, though only because he beat the rest of them to it.
Until he saw Flint say something to one of the Beaters, and then, though Draco could have imagined it, he was sure for a moment that Flint looked straight at him. And a few minutes later, instead of a Bulger, that Beater smacked his bat into the back of Hal’s head, barely even trying to make it look like an accident.
“You don’t have to decide for the rest of your life if you prefer one or the other.” He suggested. “Bisexual is an option.”
“It is no secret at this point that a group of our students have risked their safety in order to prevent a crime within these walls.” Dumbledore proved him right as he carried on. “And the skills and bravery each of them has demonstrated deserves some reward.”
“You know, Malfoy, I read some interesting things about you.” Flint said. “My mother sent me this article about eligible bachelors, and you are in the list of good matches to watch out for in the next few years – they had to include the babies like you since they’re all in a tizzy about precious Potter starting school.”
“She always treated us the same, if that’s what you’re asking.” Hal said. “I think maybe when we were little, before my uncle died, it was a bit different, because he didn’t like me much, but I don’t really remember those years.”
Hal swore again, a whisper this time, and pushed himself up to his feet. He did seem like he was fine, to Draco’s surprise and relief.
Again, the tone went straight over the Professor’s head, even as several students sniggered. Hoping to get away with it, Hal sat down next to Ron, placing the cat bed – Sil was quiet inside it, bless him – carefully in front of him as if that could protect him.
“Here’s to breaking my dad’s heart.” She snorted. After a pause, she said with a wicked smile. “Zabini is going to be
snowball fights raised the level of fun to epic heights. At the moment, however, feeling like death warmed up from the bottom of his bed, he regretted his life choices. He had survived one day after the battles of the weekend feeling increasingly fuzzy, and it seemed to have crystallised overnight.
DADA, however, was not the only subject Hal had started to attend reluctantly. Potions seemed to be a step up from the previous year and Snape was always in a foul mood (what else was new), McGonagall to everyone’s horror’s (and Hermione’s exhilaration) had started talking about exams from the second week of classes, and even Herbology was hard work, dealing with mandrakes, of all things. These things were just nasty.
He put a hand on the back of her chair, and leaned in casually, in a show of keeping this conversation private, though he was still speaking perfectly loudly and clearly enough for everyone around the table – who were hanging to his every word – to hear everything without strain.
as Hal slipped off his broom and started plummeting to the ground – he wasn’t the only one, and the game had to be interrupted as the whole stadium exploded into roars of rage (and disturbingly, some cheers from the Slytherin corner).
After a week or so, they had all gotten past the excitement of knowing there was a massive three-headed dog on the third floor of their school, as every teacher seemed to be intent to pile on as much homework as possible before Halloween.
In the evenings, the four long tables were replaced with smaller ones where students from any House could study, play, organise clubs such as the chess one… It was perfect for them – Pan’s coming out had catalysed for him and Blaise among the Slytherins, and they spent a lot more time with them now than they did with their housemates, though Blaise was still friendly with Theodore Nott and at least tolerated by the others. Understand: too influential to be dismissed – similarly, they were cordial to Draco, even as they had stopped talking to Pan.
“Well, if we’re friends, I guess you’ll need to get to know my other friends.” He said like it wasn’t a big deal.
He caught up with Anthony and Draco, and they made their way out of the dungeons. Neither of them spoke until they were back out in the main hall, and started climbing up the stairs.
While a lot of kids met their families on the platform, Hal and Hermione went back through the barrier to find theirs waiting for them. They quickly exchanged
Ley made a face. His father’s sister, Aunt Marge, didn’t visit very often, but neither of the boys liked it when she did – Hal even less than Ley, as at least the woman doted on her actual nephew. She had nothing but scorn and slurs to offer Hal.
Things did get a little chaotic as they handed out their respective piles, but in the end each of them had their presents and they decided to take turns opening them all.
“Darling, darling. Shh, you’re fine, everything’s fine.” His aunt tried to appease him, taking her seat next to him again and making him stay still with a hand on his chest, another disappearing in his mop of dark hair.
Apologising to Hal was a good plan in theory, if only Draco managed to get in Hal’s vicinity. By an unfortunate combination of the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw schedules keeping them mostly apart, the heaps of homework teachers seemed intent to pile up on them before Christmas and probably Hal perfunctorily avoiding him, Draco just did not find an opportunity to speak to him for the next few days, and suddenly it was only a couple of days before the holidays and there was
“Mister Potter’s incredible ability, indeed, would be more than valuable if you are right, and we are dealing with a Basilisk.”
Hermione and the others were also being monitored, but it seemed that apart from some loss of muscle tone and a voice cracked from disuse, they wouldn’t be feeling too many after effects. All of them came to personally thank Hal, offering congratulations (Nick), giving him hugs (Colin, Hermione of course, Penelope) or apologising for ever thinking of him as a bad person (Justin).
Having heard what the twins were up to, he came foaming at the mouth during breakfast, the morning after they’d tried for the second time to convince the Head of House to let Hal on the team. His screams were hardly fully strung sentences, though the words “going behind my back” and “only because he’s Harry Potter” were recognisable – at which point Oliver Wood himself started shouting back.
And with something from the past. With a pang, Petunia lifted the photo out of the tin. It was Lily, and James, both so young, smiling wide, waving and blowing kisses, looking like proper goofballs. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She was not going to cry today. Today was Hal’s birthday. It was a happy day. A celebration.
Before Draco could say anything, Hal laughed – it sounded a little strained, but it still brought a smile to his lips.
“They did something to the chimney.” Petunia answered, looking a little distressed at the memory. “A… transportation system of some sort.”
Ron yawned again in agreement, dragging himself to his feet, and looking expectantly back at the others, like it was inconceivable to start climbing the stairs to their dorm rooms if they weren’t following. Hal smiled back at them, almost wondering suddenly what he was so strung up about a minute ago. It was something so casual, his friends looking out for each other for even the simple journey of going up to bed, but it warmed him all over. Hermione was right.
A startled laugh pushed past Hal’s lips, and Draco felt a little smug. It was like a superpower, making Hal laugh.
In all fairness, Hal could tell the guy hadn’t made the team solely because it would attract fans either. Word was that he’d made his team work hard, and when it was finally match day and Hal found himself face to face with him on the field, he could tell Diggory was not just a pretty face. He was clearly on top of his game, sharp, steady on his broom, scanning the field with clear competence. And that, damn him, was more attractive to Hal than his biceps and the perfect fall of his chestnut locks over his forehead.
“Is that…” Hal’s voice wavered, and he looked up to Draco, pale and looking lost. Of course he’d remember and recognise the name.
He turned to Draco with a helpless look. Draco had to bite his lower lip to prevent himself from bursting out laughing, because this whole thing was utterly ridiculous. He spotted the same mirth creeping into Hal’s eyes.
“I am afraid poor Quirinus was always going to end up this way.” Dumbledore exposed. “Hosting Voldemort’s soul in such a manner was destroying him from the inside. Harry was merely the… catalyst, for his final combustion. It seems Lily’s protection is still holding strong in him.”
Gryffindor as well, obviously, and Hal briefly regretted missing the Sorting. She reached “Colin” and started ushering him away.
“There’s a Boggart in their dorm.” Ginny informed them when she saw them. “They went back for their stuff for their afternoon classes, and it badly scared them.”
Ley laughed out loud. “And I thought Smelting’s stupid tie and blazer were bad. Sucks to be you, mate.”
1.	The 1991 (for the death of the Potters) isn’t a typo. I have modernised this by 10 years because… because. There are vague plot reasons (like I want Hal to have a phone), but mostly I just wanted to write things closer to my own age and experience.
“In your school, where people are currently getting petrified by an unidentified monster, that seems likely.” Ley scoffed.
Petunia might have gotten into the habit of berating Hal and Ley for expressing obvious displeasure every time Marge came to visit, but it did not mean she enjoyed her sister-in-law’s presence in her home any more than they did. She would much rather have, that evening, spend a nice evening with her boys as they told her all about their adventures playing with a dog in the park and hunting for potion ingredients. (Even though Hal wasn’t to do magic over the holidays, he’d argued potions did not count as you didn’t need your wand. It was like cooking, he assured.)
“Both of them.” Hal confirmed. “They made it into a game, I don’t know. It’s no big deal, I just… It was weird.”
eviscerate one of them if they lost. Maybe the rain had let up a bit – or maybe Hal was just a bit more confident he wasn’t going to die, and he was projecting his feelings on everyone else. At any rate, they dominated the second half.
He turned, beaming, to the circle of students he probably thought had formed around him. In reality, a lot of them were trying to discretely edge backwards.
When Hal mentioned that he had several days of visits lined up, all his friends wanting to see him but having decided they probably shouldn’t all come at once, Sirius bounced back and announced he’d also be seeing Draco the following month.
“Hal reacts badly.” Anthony envisaged. “He thinks it’s terrible, and he doesn’t want to be his friend anymore. And out whole group collapses because we’ll have to pick sides.”
“I honestly don’t understand how you can support them.” Anthony commented. “They’re really not a great team.”
“Put a dog to sleep, fought a plant with light, caught a winged key, played some chess, and gone past a sleeping troll.” Anthony listed. “Harry and Hermione carried on.”
Hal’s first Quidditch game had come around much quicker than he’d realised. The rest of the winter had flown by in snowball fights and heaps of homework, once Hal had recovered from his cold (which had been very fast once he could get a potion), in laughter and petty squabbles similarly cementing the friendships within their little group.
“Okay, so. Last year when we were choosing classes, I couldn’t make up my mind, and I went to speak to Professor McGonagall thinking she might be able to help. I think I ended up pitching each and everyone one of the subjects equally, and honestly I was even more undecided by the end of it.”
