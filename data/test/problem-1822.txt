“I know,” Harry breathed, moving down to Draco’s neck and mouthing up to his ear. Draco let out a wrecked sob; his chest seemed suddenly on the verge of exploding with suppressed emotion. The word he needed to say flitted haphazardly across his mind, but he didn’t let it out, swallowed it hectically back and instead dug his nails so deeply into Harry’s arms he felt the prickling warmth of blood. Harry fucked into him sharply, hot breath panting out against Draco’s ear. His voice was half-strangled when he muttered, “Me too.”
get used to waking up next to him. He smelled wonderful, and when Draco pushed his face into Harry’s neck, he felt his belly instantly flood with warmth.
as prissy as Lockhart, Malfoy."
Having had quite enough of Harry’s particularly sarcastic brand of wit, he ignored this last and reached for one of his hands, removing it from his own hip and bringing it to his lips. It was extremely satisfying to watch the smirk disappear from Harry’s face when he sucked one of his fingers into his mouth.
They spent a week in Grimmauld Place before they found a flat they liked. A week after that, Harry began Auror training. In mid-August Draco finally found a job with an apothecary whose owner was too impressed with his skill to turn him away because of who he was.
"Who, the girl he's with?"
Potter’s eyes roll to the sky. He says, “Meanwhile
, each time Harry pushed his thick fingers deeper inside of him, each time he sucked at the reddened skin around his hole, coating it ever more liberally with slick, Draco could feel the stirrings of arousal not only in his dripping cunt, but in a prick that was no longer there.
Harry nodded, trying not to squeeze too hard where he was gripping Draco's thighs and bending him in half. He pulled out just a few inches and pushed in again, doing this repeatedly, moving inside him while Draco's walls contracted around his cock. Their lips moved together slowly, tasting and exploring, and at some point Draco moved his hand between them and skimmed his fingers lightly along the line of his cock, hard again finally, like he was teasing himself with the touch.
Voldemort being gone, namely. He wondered vaguely where the body would be taken, how it would be dealt with, but he didn't much care when it came down to it as long as he never saw it again in his waking life.
When dinner and dessert had been cleared away and the first-years had been collected by their respective House’s Prefects, the rest of the students were dismissed, and there was a great scraping of chairs and pounding of feet as everyone headed for the entrance hall at once. Harry and his friends lingered at the table to wait for the traffic jam to pass, and looking around the Hall, he saw that many of the other eighth-years had elected to the do the same.
Draco turned his head and Harry caught his eyes, shining with a tenderness he didn’t often show.
“Because all it’s done is make me tired.”
“We’re not fucking,” Draco said, cutting sharply through the accumulated silence with a voice that was a bit unsteady but still strong. “We’re dating. So I’m going to have to ask that you stop insulting my boyfriend, Nott, or I won’t try to talk him out of hexing you.”
“What the fuck!” Malfoy exclaims, stumbling back a step, clearly disorientated. Harry lets out a breath of relief and sets the pot on the nearest workstation. “Jesus — Potter — what the
"Yeah, I'm sure," Harry said gently. "I'm a bit in shock still myself." He paused and Draco could tell he was mulling over something, deciding whether he should say it. "Draco, I ..." He stopped again, let his eyes wander Draco's body and back up, meeting his eyes. "I wanna touch you so badly."
find it again,” Draco pushed, egging Potter on intentionally. It had, after all, been one of his greatest talents for seven years.
There had been two other times Draco had stayed at Hogwarts over Christmas holidays: second year, when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, and fourth year, for the Triwizard Tournament. Both of these things were linked inexorably to Potter, and it was with a sour taste in his mouth that Draco contemplated the castle’s silence.
“You’re doing this wrong,” Draco said, grabbing a pot from him and mending the cracked ceramic the right way. “We’ll be here all night because of you, idiot.”
It takes Harry a moment to process what exactly Draco’s just said, and what he means by it, because
It was nearing nine o’clock when Theo came back up from dinner, and he was carrying a plate of food.
Malfoy nodded. He stared at Harry another moment and then slid back down in the bed, blond hair splaying out around his head on the pillow.
“Potter,” he said suddenly just as Harry had reached for his shirt, stopping him halfway. “As it’s already four in the morning … that is to say, it would be fine with me if you wanted to — erm — stay a little longer. Sleep, you know, before you have to go all the way back up to Gryffindor Tower.”
And then Potter’s warm hand was on his cheek instead of his chest, and Draco had never been so hungry for contact before. They came together like plates colliding, like divers coming up from the bottom of the ocean, and the familiar slide of Potter’s tongue sweeping along the velvety lining of his mouth was sweeter than any wine he’d ever tasted. His hands clutched frantically at Potter’s cloak, he gasped brazenly for air every time their lips parted, and then dove back in without an ounce of shame. Potter’s hands were vices on his back and his waist, holding him so tightly Draco might have been afraid of being snapped in half had he the brain power to worry about anything other than drinking his fill.
“What are you thinking about?” he asked when Draco’s eyes landed on his, thick eyebrows knitted together above the bridge of his nose, behind those ridiculous glasses.

, even.
Draco, breaching his hole and just barely stretching him around Potter’s tongue, he had absolutely no control over the way his legs clamped shut on Potter’s head and his spine arched impossibly under an eruption of pleasure so unfathomable that it seemed to have been wrenched straight out of his gut. His body convulsed, and Potter worked his tongue through the whole thing, fingers digging bruises into Draco’s thighs, wringing every last ounce of exquisite release from Draco’s trembling body until there was hardly enough strength left in him to continue sitting upright. He was left shivering with the aftershocks, body thrumming like he’d been struck by lightning.

him that Draco comes to an understanding of how broken he'd been without it. It can't be healthy, to need someone this much, but god, he does. He needs Harry like he needs his wand, like he needs his arms and legs and his furiously beating heart. He's trembling with the weight of it, and he knows Harry can tell because of the way his hands move up Draco's back, sturdy and soothing.
“How did he convince you to talk to me just now?”

Draco’s tongue found the side of his cheek, mulling her words over, until finally he snapped his book shut and turned his full attention to her. “I’m sorry, Pansy,” he said, and saw the colour drain from her face. “You’ll have to do better than that.”

"About five months," Draco said, laying one hand on top of his mum's. "Mid-October is the due date."
“D’you think that’s a good idea?” Draco asks when he’s gathered himself. There’s a new flush on his cheeks, though, and it’s gorgeous. “Hexing me when I could easily leave you here hard and wanting?”
And then Malfoy’s mouth was on him.
"Right," he says. "Well, I'll see you in a couple hours then."

“There you are!” Hermione said when she saw him, looking incredibly exasperated. Kingsley shot Harry a wink, and Harry smirked at him in return. He glanced once at Malfoy, who lifted an arrogant eyebrow, and then looked away again with every intention of pretending he didn’t exist. Fancourt grabbed Harry’s hand in his turn and shook it once, firmly, with a jovial little “Good to see you, Harry, good to see you!” With those greetings (or lack thereof) out of the way, Hermione directed Harry’s attention to the Israeli wizards. “Harry, this is Moshe Mizrachi, the Israeli Minister for Magic. Minister, this is Harry Potter, our Seeker and Captain.” There was the inevitable lift of eyes to take in his scar, and Harry only just managed not to scowl. “And this is Noam Peretz,” she went on, indicating a second wizard, “their Department Head for International Wizarding Relations. Mr Peretz, Harry Potter.”
is not crazy.”
Malfoy was sitting there, and he wasn’t hidden beneath that circus tent of a school uniform, either. And
“No,” said Draco immediately. He lifted his other hand to Harry’s face, his stubbled jaw he hadn’t bothered to shave lately, the faint dark circles beneath his eyes from lack of sleep. “I can handle it. I’ve just never been good at sharing, that’s all. And you know me … I do tantrums better than anyone.” Harry smiled and Draco kissed him. “I just miss you so much when you’re gone a lot.”
"You left," she said, "before I ever had the chance to thank you after the trial."
And Harry could never understand that.
“Draco,” Potter said again, carefully, but the sound of it — that soft, cautious tone of voice, his given name on Potter’s lips — was that final push Draco needed over some invisible edge.
Draco looks over at Hermione, whom he'd momentarily forgotten was present. She looks extremely uncomfortable and he even manages to feel bad she's been caught in the middle of this. He's at war with himself, part of him desperately wishing he could Apparate away from this situation even as another part of him wants nothing more than to go out there and fight with Harry, because at least it'll be
“I already have my answer,” Harry said without missing a beat. “There’s nothing I could ever want more than having a family. And to have it with you?” Harry’s eyes travelled Draco’s face, and it occurred to him suddenly how spectacular it was to be the person Harry Potter looked at this way. Like a man seeing the stars for the first time. “You’re everything to me, Draco. I’ll spend the rest of my life proving that to you, if you’ll let me.”
“A number of things,” he said after a brief silence. “I got a letter from my grandmother today. My father’s receiving the Kiss first of February.”
“Yes,” he says. “I gave one of my father’s rings to the Auror who came to check on me the other day and asked him to get these for me. It’s worth a fortune, so he was amenable to the errand.”
thinks of him. Not anyone here on earth, anyway.
Harry smiled tiredly. There was no malice in Malfoy's voice that he could detect, only half-arsed sarcasm.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry was engrossed in a deeply complicated conversation with Jeremy Fowler, England’s Keeper, revolving around tactics for the game next week. This made it even more irritating when Malfoy interrupted them.
how it looked, how it sounded — him, falling for Draco Malfoy. If he’d been in Ron’s position, he thought he’d probably have reacted similarly. But did that mean he wasn’t deserving of an opportunity to talk it through?
"Yeah," he said. It was like someone else had taken over instead of Draco Malfoy. His eyes even seemed a little distant. He blinked again, sitting carefully back against his pillows.
When it was over, Harry’s come dripping messily out of his sore cunt, Draco simply lay there, boneless, stretched out naked across Harry’s bed, enveloped in the smell of him that was so pervasive here, and let himself be consumed by it. Harry Vanished the mess before pulling the hangings mostly closed around them and gathering Draco up in his arms.
“What in the world do you mean by that? Draco, darling, if you think things with Potter aren’t going to work out —”
“I know you’re not a bloody woman, Malfoy,” Potter interjected. “I know that. I get it. Christ, do you think I could forget who you are?”

anyone who looked at him would know he was of aristocratic birth. It was an inherently impossible thing to miss.
“After you’ve just told me you need to talk to me about something time-sensitive?” Draco lifted an eyebrow. “Don’t be an idiot, Potter.”
“There was … good news,” he said faintly.
"I didn't even know ... you haven't mentioned it since ..."
“It’s almost eight,” said a deep, whispered voice in his ear.
“You know,” he says finally, whispering it in the dim light cast by dozens of candles, “one day ‘home’ will mean the same place for both of us.”
"I just think it's funny I'm meant to be playing Quidditch right now."
“Draco, darling,” Pansy’s voice sliced through his musings, “you haven’t touched your croissant and your face looks as empty as a troll’s. What is it?”
“Well I couldn’t know for sure until you said something scathing and insulted me, could I?” Harry quipped with a raised brow, finding it much easier to accept this as
Draco felt helplessly exposed sitting naked on the bed, watching with rapt attention as Harry pulled off his shirt and his jumper in one go, then took care of his denims and pants as well. Now that he’d been introduced to them so intimately, Draco could see every scar standing out white and terrifying against Harry’s dark skin as he climbed onto the mattress.
Harry snorted. “I’m going to take that as a compliment.”
"I told you!" he shouted at Hermione, still pointing at him. "I fucking told you, didn't I!"
Agonisingly gentle fingers stroked across the jagged line of a faded white scar which stretched from one side of his abdomen to the other, crisscrossing near the end with another, this one shorter but thicker, having been much deeper.
After a moment’s hesitation, Malfoy said slowly, “You really

“To the stars, my beautiful boy.” She kissed his cheek, drank in the sight of his face one more time, and then she was out the door, Dawlish the Auror following behind.

“Breastfeed?” Harry supplied, a cheeky grin quirking the corner of his lips in spite of the gravity of the topic. Draco’s cheeks filled with blood, turning him what was sure to be an ugly shade of red. One of the hands on his stomach moved further under his blouse, until he was gently cupping Draco’s left breast. He took in a shaky breath that Harry muffled with his mouth.
"Right." He hesitated, and then continued carefully, "Your mum ... she'll be out by next Christmas, Draco."
Draco, eyebrows furrowed, looked from the plate of food to Theo, who had sat down nearby and looked pleased with himself.
“You heard me.” Harry’s hand moved to Draco’s thigh and squeezed. It was as much adoring as it was commanding. “This was exactly what you wanted, Draco. Now be a good girl for me and do what I asked.”
“No, honey,” said Draco kindly. “It’s cranberry juice, that’s why it’s red.” He took the drinks as Harry passed the bartender his Muggle money, telling him to keep the change to pay for a couple girls’ drinks that were ordering. They giggled and fluttered their lashes at him, not knowing he had no interest, he was just
He did indeed look uncomfortable, rather like a wild animal who'd been cornered. Harry couldn't tell whether that had more to do with the simple fact of being addressed up here in the common room where he was usually ignored, or if it was fear owing to Goyle's temporary absence. He surely couldn't have thought Hermione would try to harm him in any way, although in all fairness she

In the meantime, Madam Hooch had overzealously agreed to reinstate Harry as captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He wasn’t, however, fond of the idea that his recent defeat of Voldemort might have had something to do with her over-the-top enthusiasm, and he’d had to remind himself he’d gotten this position a couple years ago even without having slain an evil dictator.
The corridor was empty, not being one of the more popular routes to classes, which made Draco wonder whether this boy had followed him, just hoping he would separate himself from the student body, making him an even easier target than usual. The irony of it was that since Kenny Helstrom, he had deliberately avoided taking the least-trodden hallways for this exact reason.
“I don’t know,” he said with an affected unconcernedness. “Does it matter?”
, Potter. I so look forward to seeing you watching from the sidelines next week.”
, of wrongdoing! I know that, but I also think ... well, that maybe you picked up on it
He draped a leg over his broom and pushed off the stands, not knowing what in the hell had just transpired. Knowing only that if Malfoy wasn’t going to
“Well, yeah, but I was just wondering if … I mean, your mum …” He shrugged helplessly, looking more awkward than Draco had seen Potter look in quite some time. It was a small consolation for the sudden and unwarranted appearance of a topic Draco wasn’t keen to discuss. “Have you … that is, are you going to …?”
Harry drops his head back and takes a hit, pulling the smoke into his lungs, holding it there, and then blowing it out towards the ceiling. He watches with fascination as it joins seamlessly with the larger cloud. He’s become completely neutralised to the smell of the weed but he keeps getting whiffs of Draco’s shampoo, a brand new one he keeps raving about that’s supposed to work all kinds of wonders on his scalp and hair follicles. All Harry really gives a shit about, though, is that Draco’s smelled like coconut lately, which he very much likes.
“Wait, Hermione, just … let me

"Come on," said Harry, looking at Goyle and nodding towards the oak front doors. He would deal with Draco later, in private — right now his main concern was getting Goyle back to the common room. He kept shooting worrying glares at Ryan, who was shooting them back. Hermione and Daphne were gathering up all their things from under the beech tree.
, Malfoy. Not the way they looked. It’s the same with you — he likes the way you make him feel. Not the way you look.”
“Thank you for waiting, Draco.” The door to the little office in which Draco had been waiting, stripped down and forced into a hospital gown, opened up on Healer Penbroke clutching a thick wad of files and wearing a slight frown. Draco shifted anxiously where he sat on the examination table, barely able to meet her gaze. When she looked at him, her eyes were as warm and understanding as always, but something troubled had clouded them over. “Hop on down from there and have a seat with me.”
He thought for a second Draco wouldn’t do it, but then he did. He lowered himself to the hard, tiled classroom floor and parted his legs when Harry crawled between them on his knees. He wanted to see his face, that was the thing — he wanted to watch, wanted to
“There’s nothing to deny!” Draco shouted, and in a burst of frustration tried to stomp on Potter’s foot. He moved it out of the way easily, and when he leaned forward in the next moment, that shit-eating grin was still stuck on his face. Draco swallowed hard and determinedly kept his eyes on Potter’s.
When he went up to the Gryffindor dorm he found Ron snoring loudly with his arm dangling over the side of his bed, having never pulled his four-poster closed. He grinned at the sight and went about changing quietly into a different set of clothes, glad he wouldn't have to explain his absence overnight. He wanted Ron to have plenty of food in his stomach when he got this news, just so he was in the best possible mood.
“Right. Well, except when you’re coming all over my cock, you mean. You
He and Harry walked in silence down to the entrance hall and out through the great oak front doors, the air between them heavy with everything unspoken. The snow was falling thick and slow, the flakes fat and puffy, and the grounds sparkled with the fresh coat. There was hardly any wind, and except for the sound of their feet crunching through the snow, the night was tranquil. They didn’t go far, stopping while they were still within ten feet of the warm yellow light cast by the Great Hall’s windows.
He doesn’t believe Potter is a messiah, or a child of any god; he is a child of the universe, orphaned and touched by fate, chosen by something much larger and more powerful than the Dark Lord, something chaotic and random and indifferent to their human affairs. Something that took his life and then decided to give it back to him.
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” he recited with a shrug.
He pulled out of the dive perhaps five feet from the ground in a manoeuvre that would have sent the stands into wild fits of cheering and Harry smiled just thinking about it, knowing that it was only ever during a Quidditch match that he
“I tortured people,” he says. His voice doesn’t sound like his own, rough and croaky and unused. Scared. Self-loathing. Part of him doesn’t want Potter to hear it.
xxix.
“Why would I wear your ugly jumper, Potter, I have a chest filled with expensive silk pyjamas at my disposal!”
They looked at each other hardly more than five seconds before Draco was pulling Harry into another kiss, which he went into willingly and with a short laugh. It was lazy and sweet and much easier than talking, Draco's hand on his jaw, and for a few minutes there wasn't even all that much tongue, just soft lips and shared breath. But then Draco pressed his tongue into Harry's mouth, drawing it out into something deeper and languid and with a subtle urgency growing behind it. Soon he was beginning to pant and Harry could feel himself starting to get hard again. No sooner had he acknowledged it than Draco's hand was skimming down his chest and over his jeans, cupping his cock.
Draco spluttered incoherently at the pet name, standing there starkers, dripping wet, in front of a horrendously smug-looking Harry Potter who’d just had his tongue three fingers deep in Draco’s arse, and still managing to muster up an appropriate amount of indignity, which unfortunately did nothing to cover up the bright red spots of arousal on his cheeks.

"She said
“What — the
“I’d like to return the favour at some point,” he said when he pulled back, causing Draco’s head to flood with images that made his cheeks red and his heart pound. “Whenever you feel comfortable enough.”
“You had a good time today, right?” he asked, nuzzling beneath Draco’s jaw and inhaling the scent of him deeply. “You weren’t just humouring me?”
he comes back.”
Draco laughs until Harry thrust brutally up into him, and then he’s moaning instead, fingers curling against Harry’s chest. Harry has no way of changing angles, of trying to hit Draco’s prostate or make him scream, so instead he focuses on his own pleasure, because really, at this point, it’s what he deserves. He slams up into him over and over, shaking the bed, making his thighs scream with the effort, and by the time he feels his orgasm approaching his dripping with sweat and his shoulders are killing him and he knows there must be terrible bruises on his wrists.
Something hopeful flickered in Harry's chest. Even all the dull, throbbing pain couldn't stop it from blossoming.
been planned was the subject of the book, which was not Arithmancy, or Ancient Runes, or even Potions — it was an enormous book on hexes, and beside it, a heavily rifled-through tome on human transfiguration that had been no help at all.
Or rather, for

Even if he hadn’t been in the middle of a menstrual cycle, Draco knew he wouldn’t have been even remotely comfortable letting Potter’s hands anywhere near …
sure. And he’s a fucking coward.
"We weren't," Draco counters immediately. "You'll be much happier with Melody or Melinda or whatever her name is."
“I said all right.” Harry raised an eyebrow at him, and even half-naked his presence and tone of voice was authoritative. “I’ll take care of it. I want you to wear that for me today, though.”
Malfoy did so hesitantly, his eyes fixed on the jar Harry had just opened.
Ron and Hermione were in two of the chairs, and their conversation came to a halt the moment they saw him. Ron's eyes widened and he pointed furiously at Harry, sitting up straight in his seat.
There it is again — a twinge of annoyance. The feeling like Harry's accusing him of something. Except unlike last night, when he'd been able to push it aside in order to enjoy Harry's company when he'd come back from seeing Buckley, the twinge turns to a solid pit of irritation.
With Malfoy’s hand on his boxers, finding his erection again, Harry made the split-second decision to act on a crazy impulse and leaned forwards, recklessly, to kiss him.
Harry didn’t smile, only picked at his nails in his lap as he tried to sort out his thoughts.
the beds in Slytherin were like that.
“Yeah.” Draco reaches into a pocket of his robes and pulls out two watches. They look Muggle-made until Draco hands him one, and Harry can actually feel his heart flutter over a beat as he sees the words written around the edges.
Harry stood up from his chair so suddenly that it fell backwards, but before he could speak, Draco rose as well and grabbed Harry’s hand again. He stayed silent, but there was a murderous look about him.
“Not in so many words,” he said. “It’s her letters … she tries to sugarcoat the news she receives from Azkaban — she gets updates, you know, on how he’s doing — but I can tell she’s scared. And today, she didn’t even bother to deny it when I said he wouldn’t know who I was by the time we’ll get a chance to see him again.
“Draco —”
“I don’t have my cloak.” Draco’s eyes flashed to the dormitory window, where snow was drifting lazily past.
to be able to talk to mine. To know what she sounded like when she laughed, and what her favourite book was, and how she took her tea. What it would feel like when she hugged me.” Even up on the Astronomy tower, the first time they’d spoken since their fight, Harry hadn’t sounded like this. It was like watching him impale himself on a sword just to prove he could bleed. “Have you ever wanted something so badly it was like … like a
Right, maybe a little embarrassed. Mostly conflicted.
The very next day, however, Harry quite distinctly noticed someone glance at Malfoy, then at him, and then move on while they were all waiting outside the Charms classroom. Goyle seemed to have noticed this as well, and he stared at Harry for a second before returning his attention to the corridor at large, anticipating any attacks on Malfoy.
“Fawkes,” Potter said again, and finally he looked over at Draco. His face was pale. “Brought me the Sorting Hat and blinded the snake with his talons. The Sword of Gryffindor was inside the Hat. I’m — er — not sure anymore how I managed it, to be honest, everything about the fight itself is blurry, but
"Hi," he said, closing the door behind him. Malfoy eyed him impassively.
like it's a rotting carcass on the kitchen table. "The whole thing's a smear on Kirschkorn, it says I was '
Hermione rolled her eyes as she propped her Ancient Runes book open against a jug of pumpkin juice.
He’d been about to turn around and start heading back to the castle but a tug in his gut stopped him. Potter was watching him, and under that steady gaze Draco’s heart rate picked up again. Not knowing why he was doing it, knowing it was utterly and completely ridiculous, he walked back over to Potter and stopped in front of him, dizzy as soon as he was close enough for that intoxicating scent to grab hold of him.
"You can't be serious."
want me to say anything to anybody, or anything that would — erm — make you feel safer, whatever, just let me know. Okay? I'm happy to help if I —"
“Draco, I —”
"I was just wondering the same about you, Weasel."
“Good,” said Harry. “I’ll see you soon then.” He hitched his thumb over his shoulder. “Gonna go sleep for a few weeks.”
“What exactly is it that you think you know, Weasley?” Draco said stiffly, attempting an air of unconcernedness that lacked its usual lustre and believability. Weasley seemed to sense his apprehension, because for just a moment a satisfied grin came across his face before he visibly forced it away. This show of tact and self-control was utterly foreign on the boy who had once attacked Draco in the Quidditch stands their first year.
“Delicate feelings for an Auror,” said Draco. His voice was weak and breathy but he still got an especially hard thrust for his cheek, rocking him violently against his desk. Harry stayed buried inside him, unmoving, and Draco wanted to yell at him to move but bit back the urge.
“Are you staying here for the holidays, then?”
“Arithmancy is a
Draco intentionally went to bed early every night the next few days, so even if Harry did get home at a somewhat reasonable hour he was already tucked away, precluding the possibility of sex. Normally if Harry was feeling randy it wouldn’t matter, he’d get into bed and his warm hands would coerce Draco from his light sleep just enough to engage properly in a lazy fuck before they both passed out for good, only he didn’t do that this week. And though Draco was
“I’ll — er — take that look on your face to mean Harry didn’t tell you he and I talked?”
“Scared out of his fucking wits?” Draco said sharply. Even in his own head his voice sounded just this side of hysterical. “Yeah. Surprise, so am I. At least he’s not the one with a fucking
to decide that!” With his last shove, Draco pushed Potter up against the corridor’s wall.
Pansy said nothing for so long that Draco finally looked up. She had an eyebrow raised.
"Well I'm not scolding you, Draco," Pratchett chuckles. "My hands used to be a lot prettier if you can believe it."
when they forced you to take the Dark Mark —”
He found Malfoy sitting in a window seat between two beds, setting his wand back down, and he looked devastating in the moonlight. His pale skin was almost translucent; his hair was as white as bone and seemed to be glowing faintly. Up and down the sensual curve of his arched back Harry could see the distinct knobs of his spine poking through his night shirt.
The view was stunning, and yet all Harry found himself looking at was Malfoy.
Potter squeezes a little harder, whispers his name, and Draco's nails bite into Potter's skin as his orgasm crests that final peak and tips over, wracking his body with convulsions of exquisite, unimaginable pleasure. His cock twitches and spurts between them untouched, Potter burying himself in Draco's arse with harsh thrusts until Draco's a shivering mess beneath him. His hand stays on Draco's throat, clenching and unclenching rhythmically as Draco feels him start coming inside his body. His hips slow and finally come to a stop when it starts leaking out of Draco's fucked-out hole, and as soon as he takes his hand off Draco's throat and he's able to pull in a deep breath does he realise just how tight the grip had gotten right at the end.
Rain pounds the pavement around them and a Muggle electric lamp flickers and Harry puts the cigarette to his lips, and he inhales smoke, and he exhales silence.
“I hated you sixth year,” he answered monotonously, biting back the words
* * *
For a moment, Harry doesn’t do anything. He just looks down at Draco, eyebrows furrowed, thinking deeply. When he does finally move, it’s to wrap his fingers around the back of Draco’s neck and pull him into a kiss that’s slow and yet anything but soft. It sends tendrils of fire creeping along Draco’s veins, sparking his nerve-endings and turning his skin into goose flesh.
He doesn’t give Draco flowers either, the way every single one of his exes had. The gifts he gets him are not premeditated and serve no ulterior motive; they’re things he sees and buys because he thinks Draco will like them.
Once again, Malfoy was the one to break the silence.
In Draco’s room later that night, Harry made love to him slowly and with a fervent, spine-tingling passion that was utterly and purposefully different from the way Harry had fucked him following their illicit library rendezvous. And as much fun as it had been to watch Draco soak himself each time Harry whispered

It was all over the headlines the next morning:
Draco clenched his jaw. “I hate when you make plans with me when you know it’s more than likely you’ll have to cancel,” he said as he started around the workstations, collecting tools and gloves that hadn’t been put away and not looking at Harry. He could hear the bitterness in his voice and hated it — it wasn’t Harry’s fault, he knew that. And normally it wasn’t
“Here,” said Weasley, holding out the Invisibility Cloak to Draco. “Let’s go wait outside the common room for Hermione, shall we?”
to stay trapped inside the body of a bloody
“Well, why didn’t you do it, then!” she retorted immediately, looking beady-eyed and disapproving. Any trace of humour had drained from her countenance. “You could have saved us the trouble of repairing your entire flat this afternoon!”
"Yeah," he agreed hollowly. "I feel a bit ... I dunno, numb, when I think about it? I feel like I’m still supposed to be doing something but I don't know what." He shook his head and absently touched his scar, remembering suddenly how it hadn’t been there at King’s Cross, with Dumbledore. It made no sense at all to be telling this to Malfoy, yet here he was. "I s'pose it's because I've been going nonstop for so long. It’s habitual. I’m restless."
The idea was almost as exhilarating as it was terrifying.
Harry blinked at him. "Sorry?"
Harry let out a huffed breath, head tilting to one side in exasperation.
,” Hermione grinned.
“He wasn’t, though,” Harry said, grin widening impossibly. “He was sort of irked, told me I couldn’t handle things delicately, but he wasn’t
“Please don’t apologise.” Draco swallowed hard, unable to meet Potter’s eyes. “Look, I’m exhausted. I think I’m gonna head back to my dorm.”
"Yeah. Twice. I guess I'm not totally surprised how demanding you are —" Draco kicked his shin and Harry broke off with a shout of surprise. "Ow!"
. Because Potter —

“Why?”
Draco’s stomach plummeted. He heard the unfinished 'I still do' as though Harry had said it at the top of his lungs.

, Draco,” Harry cut him off neatly, not without a definite note of authority in his voice. Draco’s mouth fell open, utterly unable to wrap his brain around what was going on.
Draco didn’t answer verbally. He merely stared at Potter, meeting his eyes, knowing they were both replaying the same thing in their heads. Potter seemed to read his mind.
And then his arms were gone, and a hand on Draco’s back was pushing him back down onto the desk. He went without argument to his elbows again even though they were sore, because more than anything right now he needed to get off, needed Harry back inside him, to be so full he couldn’t breathe.
“Kenny Helstrom,” Harry said darkly, kicking at the water again. “Seventh-year. Ron hates him.”
. He can't lock Harry up in a room with him because he's scared he'll stray. He can't have every part of him, as much as he wants it. The whole
“Ron and Hermione are my best friends,” he explained, and his hands came back into his lap where he began picking again, “they’ve been with me through thick and thin.” He paused, rolled the next words around on his tongue, and finally spit them out, “But there’s no thick anymore. And I’ve spent the last seven years — nearly half my
"Are we dating?"
“I’m sorry, Malfoy … I hadn’t thought of that.”
The very same night, with Leo in Ron and Hermione's room for the first time, Draco finally brought up the appointment he had for next Tuesday morning.
"Pretty much," Draco said lowly. "Jesus, it was horrible. Hermione knocked you out when you started screaming bloody murder. Pomfrey says you'll be fine but it was ... it could have been really bad." He looked incredibly shaken; Harry lifted his good hand and took Draco's, lacing their fingers together. Draco, after heaving a deep sigh, bent and brought their lips together. He was excessively gentle, which made Harry smile again. "You know," Draco said, pulling back only to sit down on the edge of the mattress, careful not to bump Harry, "you're far too willing to sacrifice yourself for other people."
But in the middle of this sentence, Harry’s words broke off, for he’d been nearly slammed backwards by the force of Hermione flying into him. Her arms went around his neck, squeezing tight, and all Harry could do, all that made
“I guess the only thing that
“You know, I think she got something right for once, the old bag,” Harry said, lifting his drink in a toast. Ron grinned.
Draco suspected Potter had something to do with this. And some part of him, some

“What time is it, d'you know?”
Draco was glad he was inebriated, because he wasn’t quite sure what to do with this information, nor the blasé way Potter was talking about it. Especially not the fact that he had been instrumental in helping Umbridge catch Potter and his stupid band of heroes.
“I suppose thirteen-year-old me didn’t understand that it’s called

“We don’t have to go down there, Malfoy. You’ve seen the entrance. Can that be enough?”

Instead of answering, Harry slides his hand over Draco’s cock, hard and leaking a wet spot against his sweats. He thumbs the head and feels Draco shudder against him, another delicate sound coming out of his throat. Harry runs his nose along the velvet, breathing hot against Draco’s skin.
“She did it on
“Thank you, sir,” Draco said stiffly. At the sound of his voice, his mother sobbed again.
of my business, and leave me the bloody hell alone.”
“Fuck,” Harry groaned into his ear, hips stuttering as his cock started throbbing painfully. He could feel a distinct dampness along with the heat now. His hands moved from the sheets to Malfoy’s thighs, pressing them down unthinkingly to give himself better leverage to grind against him. Malfoy bent rather easily, and this as much as anything else made Harry feel as though he was approaching the edge of madness. “I’m gonna fuck you so good someday, Malfoy,” he bit out, fingers pressing hard into the skin of Malfoy’s legs, thrusting more insistently now.

“Good luck,” Harry whispered into his ear. He felt the material of the Cloak press against his cheek and knew it had been Harry kissing him there. “I’ll see you tonight, whatever happens. And if you need me earlier than that … please come and find me.”
“It’s just so unfair.” Her voice was watery and unstable, and Harry, who had never really been any good at following the enigmatic, labyrinthine emotional pathways of women, sat there feeling startled.
“But —”
Malfoy went back to the book and Harry glanced at the suspicious group again, only to see one of them quickly look away. He rolled his eyes — did they really have nothing better to do?
But he didn’t like to think too much about that if he could help it.

thinking, actually,” he said, and the way Potter grinned made something warm flare in Draco’s chest.
“Can you say please again? I quite liked the sound of it before.”
“And my father will likely have already gone round the twist by that time. Bully for us.”
When Potter kissed him this time, there was something unspoken within it that Draco felt on an instinctive level. It was something that hadn’t been there before.
Two weeks was probably safe, Penbroke had said, but a month would be ideal. And with over a year already under his belt, he'd committed himself to one more month.
too calloused to have been just from casual Quidditch and Auror training.
?” Draco questioned miserably. “You’d see him again?”
“And what is it, exactly, you plan on doing?” Malfoy drawled.
"I think it's more just that nobody really fancies being singled out for getting on your bad side," said Hermione knowledgeably. "That's all."
Malfoy let Harry slip it off his arms and toss it aside with their shirts. Harry moved between his legs and, unable to stay away a second longer, captured Malfoy in another deep kiss. He groaned when he felt Malfoy’s tits and the hard bumps of his nipples against his own bare chest. His hands fell to Malfoy’s waist, pressing him into the bed.
“And when are you going to start calling me Harry, by the way?”
He can hear footsteps behind him but doesn’t move or open his eyes. There’s a new smell when another body takes a seat beside him, familiar, woody and masculine and holy. He shivers.
"Can I please just kiss you again?" Harry asked. Malfoy's eyes widened and flickered rapidly back and forth between Harry's.
“What about me?” Harry said even more quietly. “Do you still hate
Still, over the next week he found himself flirting —
"I already told you why I did it!" Draco practically shouts. Chest heaving, he looks around the common room to make sure they're still alone. "What more do you want, you want me to tell Daphne? Fine, I'll go write her a sodding letter and —"
“Harry, you told me
"Nothing bad is gonna happen, Draco," said Harry, and Draco broke out of his daze to look at him, his earnest face and kind eyes.
"Malfoy called my girlfriend a Mudblood!" the boy shouted. Nearby, a girl with short brown hair stood looking uncomfortable but determined.
Pansy rolls her eyes. "Right," she says, "in that case I'll see you whenever you decide to emerge from your cave of nihilism then."
, though — it had been Emily, the cute little blonde-haired witch he’d been dating a year now, who had turned out to be less cute and little than she was needy and suffocating. This disaster was the proof, if he’d needed it.
Parvati nodded, but her eyebrows were faintly drawn and she looked contemplative. “I agree,” she said finally. “Like I said, Nott creeps me out a bit. Everyone is so adamant it’s Malfoy who should be in Azkaban, but if you ask me, Theodore Nott is the one I’d be afraid to meet in a dark alleyway.”
These days, when he wakes up first, he has time to look. And he

of me. I’m not —”
His mouth felt suddenly dry as he looked down at the grave, and he felt closer to Lily and James Potter than he ever had before. Letting go of Draco’s hand, Harry dropped to his knees in the snow, aware of and unconcerned by the wetness in his eyes.
"Sure, yeah, that'd be great," said Harry. "You'll come back too, won't you?"
"Where the hell do you think you're going?" says Potter. "We're not even close to being done here."
The night his father had been arrested, then. Draco said nothing, and Weasley didn’t elaborate any further. It was strange to realise many of the horrors Harry had faced, Weasley had faced them right by his side.
Ron blinked. A muscle twitched in his jaw. Harry waited with his heart starting to pound.
on his Healer’s face. Tears of exhaustion, confusion, fear,
Harry said nothing, and when Draco finally set the last pot down and allowed himself to look, he saw that Harry’s expression was uncharacteristically difficult to read. It sent a shiver up Draco’s spine — this, he thought, was probably closer to the Auror Potter criminals were used to seeing.
"Well I do." Slowly, Harry slid first one hand and then the other onto Malfoy's waist, pressing him lightly back against the wall. "How about you just listen?"
The nightmare wasn’t why he’d come.

of those years, we need time."
The past couple weeks, the anxiety that had been slowly but surely creeping up on him since the day the war had ended had seemed to retract its tentacles the smallest bit, and Harry knew very well that this was because he’d been distracted by Malfoy. However, after the arrangement they’d made, Harry had decided to let Malfoy be the one to come to him this time simply because, quite frankly, he was beginning to feel bad for having harassed him. He wasn’t sixteen anymore, he’d had to remind himself — the mature thing to do now was to back off, for he’d left the ball in Malfoy’s court and if Malfoy decided to renege on their unsteady truce, well … there wasn’t much Harry could do about it.
"S'pose you don't need it anymore," he said. "The Elder Wand and all."
"Doubtful," he muttered, pressing one last kiss to his lips before reluctantly pulling back. "Look, let's talk later, yeah? Tonight, after Ron and Hermione go to bed."
“And?” he prompted.
“Wise decision,” he said. “What
This morning, the smile is different. It’s thoughtful, and Draco thinks that perhaps Harry can tell he’s spent the last half hour in deep contemplation of their relationship. The other difference is that he doesn’t say anything — he watches Draco silently, almost as though he’s getting more this way than if he were to ask.
There were only two people who had chosen isolation for themselves, and they were Draco Malfoy and Gregory Goyle.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was the strong one. Even when Draco had found him crying on the Astronomy tower, Harry had not looked scared, or weak, or breakable. He had been stoic down in the Chamber of Secrets, and when he had been telling Draco about his abusive Muggle family. Yet now, when Draco most needed that famous resilience, that unwavering wall of resolve, all he saw standing in front of him was an ashen-faced Harry Potter with terror written in every line of his face.
“That’s precisely what I’m interested in,” said Hermione, flipping yet another page and leaning forward to read a bit of small text. “I’ve never even
“Harry, what’re you doing?” he hissed. “Don’t get in the middle of it, it isn’t your job —!”
Harry shook his head. “No,” he said firmly; with all the questions driving him to the brink of madness lately, this was one thing Harry was absolutely sure about. “He was too embarrassed he’d said it, like it had slipped out. And he wouldn’t talk about it when I tried to bring it up again.” Another sip of firewhisky, another shake of his head, another gritting of his teeth. “Anyway … I can’t see how he and I will ever
“We have to watch this last film,” he says. His lips move on Draco’s skin as he says it and his bottom lip brushes the velvet. His libido stirs, his cock twitching. “Make it an even thirty-one.”
He’d been able to avoid hearing too much about it when he’d actually been on the grounds helping out, but much to his chagrin, the end of the war had brought about not the peace he’d anticipated but a throng of interviews and meetings and trips to the Ministry. The relief was still there, of course — his scar never stung, a cloud of death no longer hovered just above his head, and despite the loss of so many friends and family, all anybody wanted to do was rejoice in the company of those who
“I appreciate it,” Draco said stiltedly. A knot had formed in his stomach. “I don’t think I’ll be wearing any dresses anyhow. That’s a level beyond what I’m comfortable with at the moment.”
“You’ll never learn, Potter.”
Draco lets the words settle for a moment, and then he tugs gently at Harry's hand. Harry lets out a soft, sweet chuckle and leans forward, smiling against Draco's lips before kissing him. It's gentle at first, an unhurried reunion of two people who'd been apart too long, their lips moving together in a deliberately slow and exploratory way that deepens quickly. Harry's hand moves to his face, familiarly scratchy and warm, and Draco's fingers curl around his wrist. He's needed this in the worst way. That had truly been the worst part of the past two months: he'd needed comfort and safety, but it's Harry who's his safe place. The irony could have been astounding if it wasn't so painful.
From time to time, Potter would glance up and meet Draco’s stare, and the look in those vivid green eyes never failed to make Draco shiver.
“You’d rather see me put in my place than win the game?”
“You did tell me you thought he’d had feelings for me a long time, though, back when I first told you about this in the library.”
And Draco, who had spent seven years despising Harry, loathing the Weasleys, caught the startled expression on Theo’s face in response to this and

Draco licked over his lips and forced himself to look Harry in the eye. He was so
…” It came out as an elongated whimper, nails digging into the warm, leanly-muscled expanse of Harry’s back. And Harry, he must have noticed, because his hands were suddenly vice-like on Draco’s hips, pulling him into the rocking movement and tearing a gasp out of his throat.
"Yes, well, that's what Harry does. I think it's for himself too, though," she said, stirring her drink contemplatively. "Maybe not consciously that part, but it definitely is."

The question was the last thing Draco had been expecting, and it hit him with the force of a stampeding hippogriff, leaving him dizzy with arousal and clutching at Potter’s robes. He
Near the middle of March, Daphne came up to
"You is too skinny, sir!" squeaked one of the elves with a look of disapproval almost uncannily like Hermione's. "You is taking more!"
"Go on, Draco," she said, her voice soft but carrying that note of parental authority he was used to from his childhood. "We won't be long."
"— don't understand why you need to be
“Maybe I should go,” Granger said. She started gathering up her own notes until Draco stopped her with a fierce look.
“Brilliant,” Harry laughed, and nearly lifted Malfoy right off his feet when he kissed him again.
"No," she said, eyes flashing. Harry clenched his jaw. "I don't think I need to tell you that this has evolved into an extremely serious situation. You realise, Potter, that this student very likely learned how to use the curse last year, during ..." She stopped, and her face lost a little bit of colour. She looked suddenly as old as Dumbledore, and exhausted. "You weren't here, Potter. Thank

“Fuck,” he whispered to the empty air.

him to say anything. They didn’t want an apology, they didn’t want to hear him say he regretted it, or that he believed his father was better off locked up.
Harry immediately lowered the papers and looked at Draco, surprise evident in his lifted eyebrows.
"Potter," he said softly, "please. I don't — I don't wanna talk about it."
It tasted bitter from the tobacco and whatever he’d been drinking, but underneath that was the distinctly sweet taste of
"It's not sudden," said Malfoy with a roll of his eyes.
chaotic and oftentimes terrifying.
“D’you think he already knows?” Draco asked, eyes fixed on his hands in his lap. “D’you think he’s heard from my mother?”
He and Draco have smoked their way through half the pack of cigarettes he’d bought just a few hours ago on his way home from work. In between them, they’ve been sharing a joint that’s finally almost gone. Draco looks completely relaxed where he’s curled up in the other chair like a cat, motioning with his hands while he speaks, the lit tip of the cigarette between his slim fingers drawing fiery, ephemeral shapes in the air.
"Dry yourself off," he says, and then turns to go back to the sitting room. Harry spells himself dry and follows, sitting in the armchair and watching Draco as he hops up on the windowsill and throws the panes open, then lights a cigarette.
He wasn’t angry at Harry, per se. He realised he was being a bit of a child about it, getting fussy because Harry’s attention was needed elsewhere at the moment and
His stomach lurched. The scene wouldn’t stop replaying in his head, and yet he couldn’t seem to fully wrap his brain around the reality of it. Potter had kissed him. He had kissed Potter back.
“You’ll, erm — you’ll figure it out,” he said awkwardly, fingers raking through his mess of dark hair. Malfoy scowled, a deep blush making his pale skin turn the colour of a tomato.
“It’s a no,” he bit out. “In case you hadn’t noticed, Potter’s straight. And in case you’ve
After several moments, he says, “I don’t know. I did.”
“Now who’s being rude? I suppose bookstore bloke has perfect hair, then?”
Didn’t it count that he’d accidentally admitted, so many weeks ago now, that he didn’t feel he deserved Harry’s forgiveness?
And he was starting to think that was the case, because it had been four days since they’d spoken. He’d caught Malfoy’s eye a few times in the Great Hall, in the corridors, and in classes, but Malfoy never approached him, not even in private. And without that to hold his focus, everything had started to close in on him again.
“Please just go away,” he says forcefully. “Merlin’s f— just leave me alone, Potter. I’m doing this on my own.”
“You want me to hold your hand?” Harry asks, only half-teasing.
“I —” Malfoy blinks again. His utter bewilderment is as endearing as everything else. “Are you serious?”
Harry held his gaze, on some level still, even now, trying to decide if Malfoy wasn’t having him on in a hugely elaborate way. His prick throbbed in that tight grip, leaking pre-come so steadily he could see it dribbling all over Malfoy’s hand.
Draco lifted his mouth to Harry's ear and whispered, "Tell her she sounds like a Hufflepuff."
“Draco,” Potter’s voice was gravelly. Draco wished he wouldn’t say his name like that. “I nearly killed you.”
“Did you just say
“Well, gosh, this is so exciting!” she suddenly squealed. Harry let out a loud bark of laughter. “I never would have believed it, not in a million years. I mean, I suspected he fancied you, of course, but it seemed so
Ron’s face looked a bit off-colour, but Harry was pleasantly surprised to see a lack of judgment there.
mean that I’m going to get down on my knees and do the same!” His chest was heaving, and although he hated it, Draco wasn’t surprised to feel the wetness of tears stinging his eyes.
“I know,” she intoned. “I was going to work on it tonight.”
"Right," Harry said, slightly abashed but still relieved.
“So you led him on,” said Pansy. “Because you liked his attention.”
Draco lifted onto his toes and pressed an unbearably tender kiss to the line of Harry’s jaw.
“Who has the other joint?” Dean asks as he drops the roach into an ashtray on the coffee table. “Someone needs to roll a new one.”
care what house our kid is in," Harry said.
When they were inside and the door had closed behind them, Potter pulled off the Cloak and — completely unnecessarily — ruffled out his hair. His dress robes fit him well, and he even appeared to have done something about the scruff on his face, though a five o’clock shadow was already noticeable.
“You’re the fucking
“It’s a raven,” Draco said hoarsely.
"Go help her!" Ron urged him, practically shoving Goyle out of his seat.
bed."
Harry very deliberately met Draco’s eyes. There was something significant in that terribly expressive gaze, something which made Draco’s heart take a flying leap up into his throat.
“What’s what like?” he asked, looking up at her now with his brows drawn.
Potter’s smirk was absolutely infuriating.
"Ooh, I'm terrified, Potter," Draco says in a childish voice, which causes Harry to snort into his tea and spray it all over his face.
Hermione’s expression was impossible to read; Ron looked utterly baffled but tentatively pleased; everyone else was staring with little to no shame; all Harry could think about, however, was what Malfoy’s face might look like, because he was doing everything in his power not to make eye contact should someone notice. He’d kept everything he’d said to Kenny deliberately vague so no one else would know what he’d been talking about — making eye contact with Malfoy would have made the whole point moot.
He brought their mouths together again for just a moment before divesting Draco of the briefs too. Harry was still fully clothed.
Hufflepuff’s Chasers ended up being as good as Peakes and Coote had warned, but it was their Keeper who had made the game a tense one. He looked like he might have been a fifth- or sixth-year, and he had managed to block Ginny’s, Dean’s, and Izabella’s shots every nine times out of ten. By the time Harry had spotted the Snitch, Gryffindor had been up only ten points at seventy-to-sixty.
Draco is also wearing a choker — a neat, black velvet circle around his pale throat — and this more than any other part of the costume is what Harry’s looking forward to. Draco doesn’t wear them often; it’s tragic at the same time that it’s exactly what it needs to be. As much as he would have liked to see that slim, inviting band around Draco’s throat every single day, he enjoys the thrill of it in these arbitrary bursts.
"After Hogwarts, you mean?"
“Harry —” Hermione grabbed his arm when he made a move to exit the stairwell, and he turned to face her with thinly-veiled fury. Talking about it again had brought back all his initial anger surrounding the situation. “Please don’t lose your head.
"I'd enjoy myself a lot more if you took those off," he says, gesturing to the pants. Potter's smile grows — he looks highly amused.
Draco shook his head slowly.
“It doesn’t hurt?”
to be forgiven. What I do know is that you’re more than just the Mark on your arm, Draco.” Draco lowered his eyes, grateful it was so dark, because his throat was suddenly tight and threatening tears. He wondered if Potter knew just how deeply that comment had touched him. “I’ve told you before … remorse can heal a soul. It’s about
“That’s actually — er — that’s sort of where things start to get complicated.”
For as ambiguous as the statement was, Harry thought he knew what he meant.
for everyone to know we’re dating!”
“Don’t be daft.” Not sure why he was doing it, Draco lifted a hand to brush away the fringe of Potter’s messy hair, exposing his famous lightning-bolt scar. He dragged the pad of his thumb across it, very much aware that he’d never gotten such a close look before. Aware, too, that he, like everyone else, had attached some sort of mythic importance to it. His chest expanded with an emotion he couldn't identify. “It’s you they’re honouring, Potter. You’re the one who saved us.”
," said Hermione fiercely. "Thank you, Neville, that's exactly it." Neville blushed.
"I have some good news for you, by the way," Harry said, sitting back down next to Draco in the grass when Teddy started busying himself with a pile of sticks. "Kingsley came by my training today to tell me he's got the bill through finally about the Dementors. First January they're gone from Azkaban."
Draco walked into Defence halfway through class. All he had to do was catch Harry’s eye and he seemed to understand what Draco wanted, because at lunch later on, when Draco went to the ever-unoccupied girls’ toilet on the second floor, Harry walked in minutes later pulling off his Cloak and stuffing away that infernal,

to try and force them into submission.” Her blue eyes were as bright as Draco had ever seen them, and he thought he could see some indecipherable pain in there, something that made Draco’s heart clench with sorrow. “If you love that boy, then
Now, with his eyes closed and the heavy scent of Harry and rain and wet broomstick lulling him into a state of near-tranquility, he feels immortal. They are hovering together somewhere between heaven and earth, and he imagines he can feel all the pain and fear of his past washing away into insignificance under the elemental assault of water and wind.
Ron Weasley was yelling something Draco couldn’t make out, shoving the heavily-muscled Hufflepuff toward the end of the corridor, until, with a sour look back, he finally left. Draco stared with an open mouth as Weasley turned back to him.
with Kit, he’s introducing you to his family, for Merlin’s sake.”
He was already asleep when Harry came home and had to leave before he woke up the next morning, and when the same thing happened the next night Draco reached the weekend in a thoroughly foul mood. He spent all of Saturday rebuffing attempts to make it up to him until Harry was called into work just before dinner, leaving Draco to Vanish the whole thing without eating out of spite.
Potter smirked and did not bother denying it.

“Now, that’s enough of that.” She closed the book on hexes and set it aside. “You
“Why?” Harry demanded, through what sounded like gritted teeth. One of his hands moved to Draco’s shoulder, pulling him back onto his cock to meet every thrust. “Tell me why not.”
If so, she didn’t bring it up either.
Harry laughed. “I somehow doubt it. And I’m pretty sure it was
“As I said, Potter — they can’t get enough of you.”
"'Bout what?" Goyle growled. Apparently he trusted Harry with Malfoy no more than he trusted anyone else at the school. Maybe even less, going by the thinly-veiled fury in his eyes. It made very little sense to Harry, who would no more have attacked Malfoy out of the blue than shoved him against a wall and started snogging him, but he didn't think he'd be able to explain that to Goyle.

Draco pins Hermione with a fierce look and she lifts her hands in defence, the utter shock on her face enough to convince him she hadn't done this.
He gets up and, cigarette dangling from his lips, pulls his pants on as well. He goes over to the window and blows the smoke out of it. Predictably, Harry follows him, waiting for an answer. Draco feels a very small twinge of irritation that's almost habitual in nature, as if his body had chosen to react before his mind even had a chance to process anything.
. “And if this is what makes him happy, then he deserves a chance to figure that out.”

“Draco,” Harry cut him off. Draco pressed his lips together, ashamed of the tears building in his eyes. “Do you want me to wait for you here?”
“Don’t make me out to be the bad guy, Dean!” Hermione said sharply. Harry rolled his eyes, but nobody seemed to have noticed. “
Pansy, meanwhile, had decided to move past her grudge in favor of using Draco as a human-sized doll in preparation for the ball. She’d outfitted him in some of her most elegant, emerald-green dress robes and slathered his face in so much makeup he felt rather like he was wearing a mask, at which point he’d wiped the whole thing clean and told her to try again. In the end, he looked in the mirror to find that a little bit of eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadow had made his grey eyes much more pronounced, and there was a permanent flush to his cheeks that he attributed to rouge. His hair, already short, hardly needed styling at all.

for brief mentions of sexual assault (nothing graphic) and implied rape.
"Glad your mind is already back on work."
.” Draco lifted his eyebrows, taken aback by this admonishment, but Harry went on too quickly for him to say anything. “And usually he lives at Grimmauld Place, but McGonagall’s letting him work here at Hogwarts while I’m finishing up so he doesn’t have to be alone in that place again. It drove him fucking batty last time.”
Malfoy nearly jumped out of his skin and, on instinct it seemed, tried to cover up the piece of parchment he was writing on. It wrinkled and some of the ink smeared. Harry was able to see that it was a letter, and although the word after 'dear' at the top was covered, he saw the word 'Father' elsewhere and realised with a sinking heart that Malfoy was probably writing to his mum.
“Language,” Malfoy said breezily. Harry clenched his jaw and forced his fists to remain at his sides. Malfoy seemed to have noticed them, because a look of dark amusement crossed his arrogant face. “As I was saying, we need to discuss your behaviour over the following week.”
“I’m eating your arse open,” Harry mumbled, and this pronouncement was followed by the hot, wet sensation of Harry’s tongue passing
“Ah, Mr Malfoy,” said Slughorn in a falsely upbeat tone. “Hate to wake you so early, but of course, rather urgent, as I said …”
“I know what he did,” she grinned. “He told me shortly after it happened; I only hoped Malfoy would actually go through with it. Ron’s really growing up this year, isn’t he?”
“All right,” he said finally, dropping his gaze and nodding to what seemed to be himself. “I mean, it’s not a
“He gave me a detention,” Harry said, laughing. “Promised he wouldn’t tell McGonagall, though. Said it could stay between us as long as I kept my head about me next time. I’ll be helping him with something or another tomorrow night. If I'm lucky it'll be half as fun as the time Lockhart made me address all his fan mail.”
“And what is it you’ll do with me between lessons?” Malfoy retorted, pushing Harry back by the chest and lifting an eyebrow at him.
“I wanna be with you, Potter. Properly. I thought …” But he shakes his head, deciding that now isn’t the time to explain about his father. “I thought it was a stupid idea. Now I realise that it probably is, but that I don’t really care much. I’ve decided to ignore my better judgment this one time.”
He knew that the Resurrection Stone was forever lost in these massive woods, and he hadn’t come here to find it, nor had he come here because any part of him believed he would see the ghosts of Sirius, Lupin, and his parents ever again.
“Ron’s told me about Malfoy,” she said candidly, making Harry’s stomach do a strange sort of startled flip-flop. “I’m not here to yell at you,” she added quickly, probably having seen the apprehension on his face. “I’m a bit disappointed and very,
Snitch, don’t be ridiculous. It’s a trophy in and of itself.”
.” Rough hands pinned him where he was, and Draco realised tears had begun leaking out of the corners of his eyes. The boy’s breath was hot on his cheek and smelled rancid. “Bet you love this, don’t you?” he breathed. His hands found Draco’s slim wrists and when they squeezed, Draco swore he felt bones grinding. He let out a little whimper of pain, but this seemed only to incise his assailant. “Knew it,” his voice was drenched disturbingly with pleasure, “everyone always said you like cock, you fucking fairy. Now you’ve got a pussy to take it with.”
"Well if I've done anything at all, it's just to help you focus a little better," said Hermione firmly. Harry caught Ron's eye and grinned. It was very funny to see other people experiencing the benefits of being friends with Hermione after they had gotten used to it for seven years. "You're perfectly capable of doing all this stuff. I think
As far as Harry was concerned, that was a handwritten invitation.
"Only looking," said one of the boys. His back was to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but Harry could tell he was staring past Goyle at Malfoy. Malfoy, looking very small compared to his current company, was mostly expressionless. But then Goyle started cracking his knuckles and moving forward and the boys continued on their way, looking in Harry's opinion like people who would have been glad to get at Malfoy had Goyle not been there, in view of Harry or not.
"He's doing it for me," said Draco much later, when everyone was gone and it was just him and Hermione in the kitchen with their tea before bed. Ron and Harry were playing chess in the sitting room. "The whole name thing before we find out the gender."
about …” He looked away from Harry, almost as though he couldn’t believe what he’d just said, and Harry felt dazed by not only the admission of something he and everyone else at Hogwarts had suspected for quite a long time — Malfoy’s sexuality — but the fact that he’d shared such a deeply personal insecurity with Harry.
And then Harry was kissing him again, the salty taste of tears heavy on his tongue when Harry sucked it into his mouth. Draco melted into the distraction gratefully.
Ron nodded vigorously. “Course we can. Think you might want to chat over a drink at The Three Broomsticks? Hermione’s said she’s not going today, got too much studying she wants to do.” Ron’s eye roll made Harry feel like they were right back in the old days, and it tugged a genuine laugh out of him that felt immeasurably good.
Draco turned to find Granger standing beside him, looking at him contemplatively. He nodded.
"Oi!" Ron said indignantly. "Could've just asked me to move!"
“You feel like you enjoyed fucking my mouth, Potter,” he said stiffly. “Don’t make it out to be more than it is.”
This is not by any means the first time this carpet has seen a lit joint. Hermione has fixed most of the damage but here and there are obvious reminders, which Harry actually quite likes. There is, he thinks, such a thing as too much cleanliness and perfection. If a burn mark on his carpet is a memory of a good time, he can’t see what’s so bad about it.
“Ow, that fucking hurt, you prick!”
“Right, okay. So … can you help me, then? Try to understand what Malfoy's feeling? What does he want? How do I talk to him?”
about it suited Harry just fine.
Malfoy glanced up at him, then looked around, like he knew exactly what Harry's presence meant. His eyes landed on the group of students who'd made Harry decide to come over; he watched them for a moment, then looked back down at his book.
Draco, who was quite amused, was also pleased to see colour blossom across Pansy’s cheeks. As Blaise had never been inclined to share much about his opinions concerning the war, it was interesting to hear how much he had given thought to it. Somehow, it didn’t surprise Draco to learn that Blaise had apparently been privately hoping Potter would finish it. The boy was a Slytherin right down to his bones and a pure-blood supremacist as fiercely as any Death Eater, but Draco had always gotten the feeling Blaise didn’t care for the dramatics of a war.
“Not … exactly,” he said finally. Ron’s eyebrows dipped.
A little taken aback, Harry nodded. "You're welcome," he said. "I know that you did what you did for Draco but I also know things would have turned out a lot different if anyone else had been sent to check on me."
In the common room, not even Hermione was awake yet. She’d still been up the night before when he’d left to meet Malfoy, buried behind so many stacks of books it looked as though she was attempting to build a city out of them. He’d learned a long time ago that nothing good ever came from lying to Hermione, and yet he’d done it again last night. It wasn’t that he thought she would be mad — on the contrary, she might have even approved of his earnest desire to help. The problem was that she would undeniably want to talk about it, the pros and the cons, the risks and the rewards, and Harry didn’t want any of that.
"He was

“It wasn’t my fault,” he blearily insists, sinking to the floor again a second after Potter vanishes the mess. “I had no choice.”
Harry, heart in his throat, pulled his jumper off and pushed it into Malfoy's hands. "Put that on. It's hand-knitted, it's really warm."
,” Malfoy drawled, though his tone in no way covered up for the fact that his face was pink, “your Gryffindorian lack of subtlety has once again led you astray of the point; that was
“What? No, come in.” He took Draco’s hand and gestured with his head towards the door. “Please. It’s just Ron and Hermione. They know everything.”
"Maybe," said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Malfoy and Goyle and returning them to the game of Gobstones he and Ron were attempting to play in the grass. Ron had already gotten sprayed twice, sending Harry into gales of laughter. "What's she s'posed to do, though? Tell Goyle he's not allowed to hang around Malfoy anymore? Fat chance."
And because he simply didn’t know what else to do at the moment, Draco followed. As they climbed the marble staircase, Theo finally caught up to Harry, and a shouting match began in the entrance hall.
Suddenly the only thing covering either of them was their underwear, Potter in loose-fitting boxers and Draco in a flimsy pair of knickers that were already damp, he could
“I’m just … beginning to realise how wrong I’ve been about you all these years,” Malfoy said. Harry’s eyes widened. “Let me put this into perspective for you, Potter, from a Slytherin point of view. If you destroy the most powerful and dangerous thing in the world, what does that leave?”

“I’m always adorable, Potter. Don’t be stupid.”
"Thanks, Potter."
“Don’t fucking move,” he growled, pumping his finger steadily in and out, the rhythm torturously,
like?"
"What?" he said stupidly. "Do I think what was Azkaban?"
Now all that was left was the countdown until he took the potion that would give him his real body back.
Jaw clenching, Draco lifts himself off the ground and deposits himself on Potter’s lap with a knee on either side, pinning him to the ground, and he’s immeasurably satisfied by the wide-eyed look of disbelief — ah, yes, and a
For the first time since he'd become trapped in this body, he let himself look. He had

Based on the prompt: smol!draco
"Fuck," he hisses, snatching his hand back from the cauldron and sticking his fingers in his mouth like a five-year-old. This is the third time today he's either burned or cut himself because he's too busy brooding to pay attention. This one's worse than the others, the top of his fingers having pressed fully against the blazing hot pewter, and he can already see the skin raising.
"Er —"
"You really expect us to believe you've been
was — only seemed to be further eroding Draco's foundation of beliefs concerning Boy Wonder.
"It'll get worse if she tells everyone to stop picking on me." He brought his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around them, looking heartbreakingly vulnerable. If he hadn't known perfectly well it was Malfoy he might have thought it was somebody Polyjuiced to look like him. "When Greg's around it's just the verbal taunts, I can deal with that —"
“No bloody way,” Draco whispers to himself as Potter touches his wand to the pestle and non-verbally casts what can only be some kind of incredibly advanced Revealing Charm because the tool glows briefly blue and then Potter looks around with obvious suspicion. Draco looks quickly away, back at his station where he hasn’t even started chopping up the Valerian root yet, and silently fumes.
Harry licked his lips. He saw on Draco's face that he'd already had an intuition what Harry was about to say.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t understand. That doesn’t sound like love to me, Draco.”
"Can this not be a big deal?" he said. "He doesn't want you guys to know yet."
want."
Draco shoved his shoulder. "Yes," he bit out, Harry positively beaming at him as he snatched at a bread roll. "
"You're ruminating," Harry says against his skin. He slides his hand over one of Harry's and scratches his nails lightly along the top. "You're still not sure."
Draco splutters, going instantly red. It’s not as though he thinks Harry doesn’t know he has a bit of a fascination with his scar, because he
He sees shock on Malfoy’s face and only half a second before he drops the pot Harry realises what’s about to happen, darting forwards to catch it before it can explode on the ground.
Draco cried out and nearly sagged against the door, but Harry dug the nails of his free hand into the meat of Draco’s arse, stilling him.
When he stepped back into the main office Hermione shot out of her chair, eyes round with anxiety.
"It was a Ravenclaw," Harry said, turning to McGonagall. "He used the Cruciatus Curse."
“Sorry, were you reading that?” a voice said spitefully, and Draco looked up to find a rather burly boy standing before him, a scarlet-and-gold tie telling him this was a Gryffindor. Not from his year, but surely no younger than seventeen, either.
at this body. For the first time, it wasn’t
He feels hands slipping around him from behind and lets it happen, shivering a little when Harry's arms close around him completely and he pulls Draco back against his chest. There are lips behind his ear, soft and sweet, touching the spot where only Harry knows he's got a tiny looping line tattoo of a stag because he usually has a Glamour on it. He'd gotten it one night in Paris, at a
"Fine," he says, standing from the chair and brushing past Harry out of the office, into an open area with cubicles. Harry closes the door behind them. It's not exactly private but it's late enough that everyone other than some maintenance staff and a few other stragglers are still around. He looks at Harry and Harry looks at him and a hundred unspoken things pass between them, leaving Draco feeling stripped bare and vulnerable. For as expressive a person as Harry is, it's difficult right now to know what he's thinking.
Pansy must have seen him looking, because she said, “It sounds like a load of rubbish, don’t worry. They’ll come up with any story at all these days as long as it has to do with Precious Potter.”
Harry starts grinding up into him and Draco eases into the movement, rocking his hips slowly, his cock pressed between them. He ruts himself against Harry's chest, sliding through his own pre-come and moaning softly at the feeling of muscle. There's no sound other than that of the rain tapping against the bedroom window and their panting breaths, and in Draco's head, the sound of his racing heart. Beneath his hand he can feel Harry's too, strong and steady and perennial.
, I mean,
, we still have, like, two weeks. Come on, Harry, let's go hit the pitch."
Tears dripped sullenly down Draco’s cheeks, overwhelmed with relief and gratitude.
But as soon as the needle touches his skin, he’s reaching out for him.
He set down his quill slowly, reflecting on the way his heart had begun hammering in his chest, and then stood up from the table and went towards the section two down from where Potter had gone in. Amidst the cramped rows, Draco began winding his way through the maze, anticipation lighting his nerve endings on fire. Potter was nowhere to be seen; Draco ran his fingers along the dusty spines of ancient volumes as he moved among the shelves, trying to find that iconic head of hair and those burning green eyes below it.
“Jesus, Draco, what happened?” said Harry urgently, pulling him towards his bed and sitting him down on the edge. “You’re scaring the shit out of me.”
, whatever you look like. Now
"A ... ring?" Draco asks, feeling winded.
He was pretty confident Kenny wasn’t likely to start giving out details about “what he’d done,” as Harry had so cryptically alluded the other day, and with the real story contained to himself, Hermione, Kenny, and Malfoy, the issue should have been laid to rest.
Draco laughs without humour. "Yeah well that's the thing with Harry," he says, putting the murtlap essence away and reluctantly grabbing the dragon-hide gloves hanging from a hook on the wall. "He has this bloody annoying way of making anyone he's talking about sound like the absolute

of himself into the things he does,” she said. For some reason, this statement made Draco’s chest feel tight. “Don’t do anything you’re not one hundred percent sure about, Malfoy. Because when Harry gets involved in something —”
. Enjoyable, even. Loathe as he was to admit it, Draco adored having Potter’s eyes on him. He loved the hunger he saw there, and as Potter had so coyly pointed out, Draco loved the way Potter seemed to radiate life and passion and powerful magic. For Draco, whose world had once burned bright with the warm glow of family, was now as cold and desolate as his father’s cell in Azkaban.
Harry scoffed. “You can’t just go around
"Yeah," he says slowly, "I have. Have
written on it in careful script. And because he couldn’t tell by the look on Potter’s face alone whether or not he was open to the idea, Draco was forced to rely on blind hope. This was excruciating, because it was entirely possible he wouldn’t come.
Draco laughs bitterly. "How I wish you'd quit trying to convince me he gives a shit."
When it was over, Potter fell back against the chair with an arm thrown across his face and his cock softening against his stomach. Draco wiped delicately at his lips, as if he’d been enjoying nothing more than a popsicle, and raised an eyebrow from where he still sat on the floor between Potter’s legs. After several seconds Potter removed his arm and looked down, appearing utterly bewildered by what had just happened.
“What, you want me to have a
to be in, that you feel connected to, that’s the House where you belong. Dumbledore told me it's the choices we make, not our abilities. And also,” he added, nudging Malfoy lightly with his elbow, “Slytherins aren’t all that bad once you get past all the thorns.”
It had been satisfying for perhaps one whole minute to think of Malfoy cowering in a cell before the idea had begun to disturb Harry thoroughly, and seeing him this way only heightened that. It would have been so much more satisfying, he often thought, to be able to hate the old Malfoy, who didn't look like a single hex might finish him off.
Potter’s laughter made his eyes sparkle. “Yeah, exactly. You don’t think there’s a second Chamber of Secrets we could sniff out, do you?”
Boothby did indeed stick the Patronus Charm into their exams, but seeing as a good deal of students (with the exception of Potter’s disciples) could not produce anything corporeal, Draco’s shield form was more than enough to earn good marks.
“I beg to differ,” says Potter. His grin is shit-eating and much too smug for Draco’s taste, more of a
Draco let out a pitiful whimper, shivering where he was pushed up against a wall with Potter’s hot mouth on his neck and his stiff cock grinding into his thigh. His hands moved from Potter’s robes to his stupid, wonderful hair, grabbing fistfuls of it and

But Harry decided not to say it. Because what was ‘virginity,’ after all, other than the first time one had sex? It didn’t mean anything. And he wanted this, it was all he fucking wanted after

something. Now, at school, it just feels like there’s so much more time to think, and nothing to distract me. And Malfoy, that hex … it was a distraction. I … I let myself get carried away,” he admitted, his face hot, but the look on Hermione’s face wasn’t one of judgment. Just focused determination, probably to understand.

about that, as well?”
“Let go of me, you lunatic!” Draco cried, terror making his throat tight.
"I know."
Either Malfoy was thoroughly enjoying himself or he’d picked up on the obvious fact of Harry’s sudden, blazing need, and either seemed an absurd explanation for the way he was putting all his energy into this fucking blowjob. He suddenly took Harry in deep, lips touching the edge of his fist, so the head was pressing all the way into the back of his throat as he swallowed around it. Harry tightened his fist in Malfoy’s hair and pushed further, sliding
“Potter’s back, did you hear?”

fucked, so.
“Saying what?” Draco said, voice cracking on the last word.
“They aren’t angry at you —”
"Clearly he can do whatever the hell he likes," Draco snipes at her. She looks sad and exhausted and he feels a nauseating pang of guilt once again. Harry still hasn't said anything. He's just staring, brow slightly creased, as if he's trying to work something out. The only thing more unbearable than avoiding that heavy gaze, Draco thinks, would be meeting it. "Mind your fucking business, Weasley." And, turning to Hermione again, "We can go over that list this weekend. I'm leaving."
“I don’t need you to be proud of me, Potter,” he said, and then spit the toothpaste out into the sink. He met Harry’s eyes through the mirror. “I did it because your golden friends are beginning to bore me. Pansy’s served her time.”
“Because I’m a girl?” Malfoy questioned sharply, but the effect was ruined by the wet quality of his voice. For a long moment, Harry didn’t answer him, and Malfoy didn’t move as he waited for one.
“What, you mean like another Kenny Helstrom?” he snapped, fear and anger bubbling to the surface;
He made it down the corridor and around a corner before he realized he had absolutely no idea where he was, nor could he seem to catch his breath. Peripherally he felt someone take his arm and steer him inside a nearby classroom, but at first Harry couldn’t make heads or tails of who it was.
Those three elusive words were suddenly at the tip of Draco’s tongue again, but he determinedly swallowed them back. He had the strangest feeling Harry could tell.
you weren't here. It was ... we cannot abide by the use of that spell here in these corridors,
He looked at Harry and Harry looked back at him, a soft smile on his face.
“Harry doesn’t want you down there —”
“Yes, that happens to me from time to time, as well,” she nodded. “It’s expected, after a war like that. It helps if you talk a little bit, Harry.” Feeling suddenly uncomfortable with the topic of the war broached (not to mention the clear resonance to what Harry had been saying to Malfoy last night), Harry descended into a silence that wasn’t lost on Hermione. She sighed and slackened her pace, forcing Harry to follow suit, until they were stopped in the middle of an empty fourth-floor corridor. “I know it’s painful, and I know you don’t want to talk to Ron and me about it, and I understand." Harry looked up, startled by this pronouncement at first until he realised it wasn't actually so surprising that Hermione should have figured this out. "But keeping everything trapped inside your head is even more painful in the long run.” One small hand rested on Harry’s arm and he gave her a weak, grateful smile. “Think about it, okay? Carrying all that around with you … it isn’t your burden to bear, Harry.”
He loses himself in it quickly, his hazy, sluggish brain happily forgetting the presence of eight or nine of their friends around them as he drinks his fill. All that’s real or matters is the warm, solid weight of Draco in his lap, the smell of weed and coconut, his soft lips and wet tongue and the gentle fingers on his jaw, stroking lightly. His own hand, the one not draped behind Draco’s back, finds his hip and snakes beneath his shirt, just enough to graze warm skin. Draco smiles against his mouth and hums into the kiss before pulling away and trailing his lips towards Harry’s ear.
Although this was highly strange considering he and Theo had never been close enough friends for him to have picked up on such minor food preferences, Draco didn't say anything, pulling the plate into his lap instead and lifting a forkful of the tender meat to his mouth.
Harry leaned forward and pressed their lips together in a kiss that said the things for which he couldn’t find words right now. He let himself be pulled up by the hand and stood still while Draco cast Warming Charms on both their cloaks and trousers to melt away the snow.
Suddenly the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Ron was sticking his head through.
, he thought to himself, imagining it even as he said it: he could see Hermione’s face like she was right in front of him, that look of worry, of deep concern; it was the same look she’d given him fifth year when she’d been walking on egg shells around him, or the day she’d told him about his wand when they’d been on the run.
to get up and touch his father, hug him, and knowing he couldn’t. “A boy at school did it back in September. The Healers haven’t been able to figure out how to reverse it. It’s … part of the reason they let me come see you, Father. Because by the time we can contest visitation rights …”
why I’m confused, isn’t it? I’m …
“I’m still figuring you out,” he says after some consideration. Harry lifts both eyebrows.
“I really appreciate you coming,” Draco says as he leads her to a small wrought iron fleur-de-lis table near some of the more pungent flower beds. He and his mother had taken tea out here times beyond number in his childhood, almost always without his father. “I know you’ve been up to your ears working on that new assignment you won’t tell us anything about.”
Potter’s eyes rolled skyward, but a grin had at last returned to his face.
"Stay the
Malfoy lineages rest on my shoulders? According to my mother, my blood-tr — er — my cousin Nymphadora had a son before she died in the war.” Cheeks flushed, he knew Theo would be aware he’d been about to say 'blood-traitor cousin,' but he didn’t comment on the way Draco had broken off, merely seemed privately interested by the fact. “Don’t know who the father was, but he won’t have been a pure-blood, so their son is as good as a blood-traitor, probably a half-blood, as well, and even if he wasn’t, he would have taken his father’s name, not Black. My grandfather, Cygnus, only had daughters, so the Black name itself died off with my mother's cousins, Regulus and —”

This wasn’t the way things were supposed to be when you graduated from Hogwarts.” Tears were sparkling in her eyes again, prompting the same from Draco. “I can’t change what’s happened, or how difficult things are going to be for us for a while, but I can at least give you this piece of advice and hope that you use it.
"I almost didn't let you in."
“No,” he said finally, and Harry’s shoulders relaxed. “A little bit irritated you’re so utterly incapable of delicacy, but then, I suppose that comes with the territory, doesn’t it?”

“Theo,” Draco greeted him, attempting nonchalance and just barely attaining it. He was sure his eyes must be red from crying. “If you don’t mind, I’d rather talk later.” He gave him a small nod and kept walking, only for Theo to step in front of his path.
They got their bags and swapped out their morning textbooks, and they were halfway to History of Magic when something invisible grabbed Draco’s arm. He stifled a scream, and as soon as he realised he wasn’t imagining it and it hadn’t been another clumsy moron running into him, a thrill of excitement made his body tingle from head to toe.
“Did your mum tell you he’s doing that badly there?”
“Oh look, it talks,” said Draco disdainfully, sneering up into the face of a boy who might have been quite fit had it not been for the rather unsettling look of disgust combined with something dangerously close to hunger in his eyes. Not like Potter, though — this was nothing like the warm passion he saw in Potter’s eyes when he was turned on, two seconds away from devouring Draco. This was horrible, and it made his gut twist with fear. Draco’s heart leapt into his throat, yet he kept his composure. “I understand it must be difficult for you, to see people
“Without you there?”

smugness, Hermione is hardly the person to revel in anyone's misery, but he still hates it. He hates that she knows he's been a wreck for two months, that any time she comes over for a visit she looks at him like he imagines she would look at an animal she wishes she could help but can't. It's easy to forget sometimes that

thanked me, with the words and all. I think, deep down, he was more afraid of Helstrom than he was letting on. Are you ready for the best part?"
Unable to help himself, Draco smirked up at Harry, pushing the thick mess of his fringe back from his forehead and drinking in his face hungrily. “Yes, well, it’s only my arse anyone’s ever fucked before, isn’t it?”
Potter shrugs again. He looks more interested in studying Draco than talking about his triumphs of nature.
“You certainly seem to have,” Draco bit back. Potter looked genuinely bewildered. Not to mention irritated.
xxxiv.
Harry pulled him in by the back of the neck, kissed him soundly, and was gone in another moment. Draco smiled to himself; around three in the morning, maybe four, he would wake to Harry’s wandering hands and insistent lips, and in that transcendent darkness of the early morning hours, with Harry smelling like sweat and adrenaline and maybe blood, it would feel religious when Harry fucked him and said
"No ... no, I just — it hadn't occurred to me before." Changing the subject back around to Malfoy, he asked, "Why were you wandering around alone without Goyle?"

"Oh, they wouldn't have if I hadn't hounded them," Hermione assured him. Ron made a throaty noise of outrage.
Draco started seeing a Mind Healer. Within just a month Harry started noticing differences — mostly it was that he began letting Harry know when he wasn't feeling good, and together they were able to find things to do to help him cope. It was good for Harry, too, who was certainly still recovering mentally himself, and would be for years to come, he knew.

Some colour blooms on Potter's cheeks and he sighs, looking guilty and irritatingly modest.

On one of the unused desks he found a scrap bit of parchment and used his wand to spell out ‘12 Grimmauld Place London,’ which he then handed to Draco.
Privately Draco thinks Harry's probably underestimating how royally ticked off the team's captain will be considering Harry's about a hundred times more talented than Kirschkorn, not to mention a fan favourite, but he doesn't mention it out loud because he's exactly selfish enough to keep England's most beloved Quidditch player here with him in his flat where he can kiss him.
There was no answer, but the seat he was invisibly occupying moved back further, and Draco felt the Cloak brush his calf just before his legs were prised apart and Harry appeared between them beneath the table. His green eyes sparkled mischievously up at Draco.
"What?"
“She’s nice,” says Draco.
After a tense second Goyle nodded and started following Ron. Harry gave Hermione a significant look and she and Daphne, arms laden with books and parchment and quills, went to Draco to silently accompany him. Harry kept glancing back at Ryan and the group of friends he and his girlfriend had rejoined, not trusting him entirely.
lighting their way, although it wasn’t nearly as dark as the tunnel coming down had been. It was long and damp, smelled of ancient rot, and was, frankly, terrifying. Here and there Draco spotted poisonous green snakeskin which must have been shed by the Basilisk when it was still alive. His arms developed perpetual goosebumps.
“Regardless, though,” he went on, “I mean, whether or not it was a good idea, I don’t regret it.” A flush to match Hermione’s rose on his cheeks. “I realised something when I was with him last night. It scared the hell out of me at first, but then I also realised it had been coming for a really long time.”
He wishes he could take it back. The question. In his head it had been bitingly rhetorical, only it comes out as genuine and he absolutely doesn’t want the answer.
Find me at
Potter nodded stiltedly. “Yeah. He was … friends with my dad and Sirius and Lupin in school. Er — kind of …”
“That wasn’t it?” Hermione said breathlessly. He could see with plain certainty that she was biting back a million things she wanted to say.
A few feet away, there was a piercingly loud explosion of glass, followed by a yelped, “What the
Malfoy laughed softly, and though he hesitated he did indeed put it on. It was too big on him, yet that managed only to look very sweet. It was red this year and Mrs Weasley had decorated the front with a Gryffindor lion.
"Potter —" he said breathlessly, pulling away from the kiss. His thin chest was rising and falling rapidly, his pupils dilated. "Wait, I have to ... I have to tell you something."
"Harry —" Ron starts, but Harry cuts him off.
Harry, appetite gone, found that he couldn't rid himself of the mental image of Malfoy with his face lowered, as if the best he could do was hope they didn't hurt him too badly. It made him feel sick.
had so many times referred to him lately.
As always, comments and Kudos are loved and adored, and you can find me on
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Where's Malfoy?"
“If we’re going to continue shagging, then yes.”
Draco’s eyebrows came together, confused. The past two days had been a blur. Having been the weekend, Draco had spent most of the time in his room, buried under his covers, hidden away from the world and all its terrible truths. He hadn’t even known Potter had been gone. Nor did he care.
Outside the bathroom, the sound of students filing out of classrooms let them know the period had ended.
The flat was on the twenty-fifth floor of a building in the heart of London; it was nearing midnight when Harry, clutching his third beer, pulled Malfoy away from a bloke who was attempting to chat him up and out onto the balcony.
“We, your father and I, raised you to be cautious and mistrustful of your emotions, Draco. They can so often lead us astray and cloud our judgment when we let them get the better of us. But, darling … there are some emotions that are just too big, too
how she'd found out). He left only after Draco assured him he would get dressed and come to his office immediately, and even squeezed Draco’s shoulder in a gesture that was apparently supposed to be fatherly but ended up being nothing more than severely awkward.
or anything, though!” he said quickly. “Not like I deliberately blew her off.”
“Yeah,” he breathed, nodding. Draco fidgeted where he stood.
Harry’s good at that: eye contact. Maybe because he’s not afraid of his feelings.
"I have to whisper it!" Draco said urgently. Harry laughed as Draco cupped his hands around his ear, giggling a little.
“Relax, kitten.” Harry’s hand slid across his lower back, a soothing, warm, heavy presence that Draco nearly arched back into in spite of himself. “You seemed to be enjoying it well enough.” He leaned closer, and to everyone around them, it would merely look like Harry kissing his cheek, whispering something in his ear. Draco thought it severely unlikely any of them had even an inkling as to the kind of filth being crooned at him: “Don’t even think about going down to your room and putting knickers on before Defence, Draco. I want you dripping all over yourself through the lesson for me.”
“Stay out there!” Harry yelled to the guard, who had gotten a hand on the door several seconds after Harry had already managed to take control of the situation. Astoundingly, and with a look of doubt and confusion on his face, he hesitantly obeyed. “Don’t move, Lucius, or I’ll let them take you back to your cell.”
It felt reminiscent of sixth-year in a way that both amused Harry and disturbed him greatly.
Retrospectively, Draco knew that even eleven years after the fact, Halloween night had remained synonymous with the first fall of the Dark Lord in Lucius Malfoy’s eyes.
"Who says nothing'll come of it!"
“Prone to outbursts as it is?” he supplied, to which Hermione rather guiltily shrugged in agreement. “Honestly, I dunno if it was a good idea. I was … hesitant, you know, even in the moment, but he … erm … he was quite … insistent …” He trailed off, tongue finding his cheek as he saw colour rising steadily over Hermione’s face.
me, Potter?” he said through clenched teeth. Potter merely raised his eyebrows, cupping his ear as though he was hard of hearing. “Will-you-please-help-me-Potter,” Draco bit out, and at this Potter laughed delightedly.
Hermione, lips pursed and eyes narrowed, took a handful of Floo Powder from a vase on the mantel and disappeared into the green flames. Harry looked around at the glass all over his floor and, with a deep, resentful sigh, went to clean it up.
Like the war, Harry supposed this was something he needed to move on from. And he would, in time. Just as he knew that, in time,
, and soft.”
He pulled off the Cloak but was too numb to move, and he didn’t need Weasley reaching out to grab his arm to keep him in place. A few other students on the ground floor had come to a halt and were watching from the side. Quietly and unnoticed by anyone but Draco and Weasley, Granger had begun descending the staircase.
That finally does it — he shoves Potter's chest, satisfied when he stumbles back a few steps looking surprised.
"Yeah?"
“It freaked me out too,” he said after a beat. “Don’t suppose that’s going to garner
“So you’re …?” He still can’t say it.
“Don’t get up,” Weasley said when Draco started to do just that. He paused, then sat heavily back down. He was too tired, too emotionally drained, to do anything else. Weasley took the bed next to Harry’s. “Me and Hermione ran into Harry. He wouldn’t say anything, just took off. Hermione’s gone to find him.” There was a long pause. Draco said nothing. Eventually, Weasley did: “Would you feel comfortable telling me what happened?”
While clearly displeased, Pansy left him alone. She’d learned better than to push him past his limits, and in this new hormone-addled body of his, that lesson went double.
He slipped a hand inside the front of Potter’s trousers — warm, damp puffs of air hitting his face when Potter’s breathing noticeably increased — and when his fingers made contact with the hot, hard flesh of his cock, Draco choked out a whimper of sound. Potter groaned.
"I'd have to be pretty mad in the first place to want something like that."

Harry pinched Draco's side and he squealed, but Harry could feel him smiling against his cheek.

He hadn’t mentioned this to Potter. Nor did he plan to.
“Do what?” he says innocently.
"Oh, for heaven's sake," she said upon seeing them, her face white. Madam Pomfrey immediately took Malfoy from Harry and led him into the Infirmary.
“No one else ever will,” said Draco softly. Harry lined up and sank back inside him, the angle better this time and pressing against his prostate. He stifled a moan into the crook of his elbow, jerking forward as Harry started thrusting. He filled all the achingly empty places inside Draco that he’d been stubbornly clinging to lately, a childish and petty revolt against a lack of attention, and deeper than that — scarier — a momentary uncertainty, a terrible, private doubt: could he handle this? Being with Harry Potter? Committing himself to someone he had to share with the whole Wizarding world, who would be busier than ever when he inevitably became Head Auror in a couple years?
One of Draco’s hands landed on Harry’s cheek. He closed his eyes and let the sensation overwhelm him. He wondered vaguely, if he could go back in time, whether his younger self would believe that one day, Draco Malfoy’s touch would have this sort of viscerally calming effect on him.
Again, Harry shrugged. He'd been searching for that answer himself just lately and still hadn't found one.
Until they were actually standing in front of the grave, Harry had been nearly

people could use a little help focusing." Here she shot Harry and Ron a look which wiped the grins off their faces.
Pansy watches him, looks him over with an utterly impassive expression. He doesn't know what she's thinking, but it doesn't matter. She'll tell him when she decides to. In the meantime he puffs at the cigarette, watching her back, thinking suddenly of a night four months ago in early November when he and Harry had been sitting on the sofa looking through a list of potions Draco brought home from work. The apothecary he works for handles some of the strangest requests he's ever seen, often requiring him to do research at home. It had been pouring that night too, and they'd had the windows open because Harry liked the way it smelled when it rained. He'd been laughing himself into a fit at his own jokes, coming up with ludicrous scenarios behind the potions being ordered. He hadn't been wearing his glasses, and when he'd laughed hard enough to cry it made his eyes so green that Draco's heart had ached with it.
growing inside of him. At least
like, Harry thought, watching with his jaw open as Malfoy’s face started slowly but very noticeably shifting, like the bones beneath it were rearranging themselves.
He didn't, though, because he didn't think he needed to. He could see on Malfoy's face that he'd already begun asking himself that very question.
“Pinching,” says the woman with a device in her hand Harry had called a ‘tattoo gun,’ which sounds unnecessarily aggressive, in his opinion. “Just sort of a, erm … I dunno, a pinching sensation. Dunno how else to describe it. Sure you like the position?”
Draco’s eyes rolled, a habitual response to the mention of just one of the myriad things Potter was famous for.
Harry could only shrug. He knew, of course, that oftentimes a person’s Patronus was deeply connected to another person — Snape’s doe; his mother’s doe and his father’s stag, almost
don’t have to look at it.” And with that, he wriggled free of the trap and began stalking in Harry’s and Ron’s direction. Harry was a little stunned to see that Malfoy’s head was down, and because of this he didn’t see who he was walking towards.

at Harry, let alone speak to him. Harry was perfectly okay with this — he didn’t much feel like speaking to Ron, either. His veins throbbed with resentment in time with the throbbing of his freshly bruised jaw.
," said Harry, "it's just that they all really like it whereas you find it threatening for some reason."
Potter-talk was abundant, Draco noted, as he made his way around the vast room, slipping between chatting couples and groups of friends. He’d always suspected Potter secretly liked all the attention, but it became obvious Granger was telling the truth about the likelihood that he was hiding out somewhere when half an hour had passed and Draco still hadn’t spotted that notorious black mop of hair.
Wasting no time, Draco pulled Potter’s cock out of the confines of his slacks and marveled at the weight of it in his hand. The head was flushed dark red and sticky with pre-come, and when Draco brushed a thumb across it, he felt Potter’s hips twitch.
“I came to see you, obviously.”
"Go get McGonagall," he told the Friar without looking up, "I'm gonna take him to the hospital wing."
"She made it sound like I did some big thing, didn't she?" said Harry, successfully getting a wet laugh out of Draco.
Potter gapes and Draco relishes the satisfaction he feels.
“And what exactly does future you need reminding about?”
Harry breathed out heavily through his nose and reached over to the bedside table to grab his glasses. “Can we have breakfast first?”
On the night of Christmas Eve, Draco did not go down to dinner — he could not bear the festive atmosphere, could not stand to look at the younger students and their grinning faces, so unblemished, so innocent, so filled with enthusiasm over a holiday Draco did not feel he deserved to celebrate. Not when there were hundreds of families across Britain who would not be celebrating but mourning their first Christmas without those loved ones who had died under the Dark Lord’s regime.
me?” he said weakly, turning wide eyes on Harry, whom he felt he was seeing clearly for the first time. He thought back to the tantrum he’d thrown in his room earlier that morning and wondered whether he hadn’t accidentally tapped into something he wasn’t fully prepared to handle.
It’s very simple, and almost fool-proof.
wanna keep it?”
"You don't want something you can control," Harry says in a low voice against his ear. Draco shudders and lets his eyes fall closed. "You want something that drives you fucking mad now and then."
. He didn’t think he’d ever been so full before.
, because Hermione says it latched itself onto my chest and she couldn't get it off me when I was passed out. Left me with this.”
He pulls a leg up on the sill and wraps an arm around it, pressing his cheek against a bony knee.
“Draco?” he said roughly, straightening up and wiping unashamedly at his cheeks. Draco lowered his gaze, as though what he was seeing was indecent. It seemed uncanny Weasley had earlier the same day warned about the cracks in Potter’s stoic façade, only now to be confronted with the proof of it. “How did you …?”
“No,” said Draco firmly, lifting his head and meeting Harry’s eyes. “It isn’t your fault. I’m glad I know — I
"I really hate this school sometimes," he said.
of bones.
Draco was silent for a moment, and then, with a small sigh, said, “No. I might be with her a while.” He turned his head, catching Harry’s eyes. It was absurd and strange and wonderful to realise how much comfort they now held for Draco. “Will you sleep here tonight again, though?”
So, with his heart a bit lighter, Harry took the necklace back upstairs and wrapped it. After dinner he used Pigwidgeon to send the gift and an attached note to Hogwarts, where it would hopefully reach Malfoy by the time he woke up.
After a moment in which Harry watched innumerable emotions pass across Draco’s face, he finally said, “And even though you’ve knocked me up at eighteen years old?”
Meanwhile, Harry felt as if he would burst right out of his skin every time he thought about his and Malfoy’s last meeting in the Prefects’ bath. It still seemed surreal, to know Malfoy had, in very plain words, told Harry he liked him back. There was something taboo about it that somehow inflated Harry’s excitement and enthusiasm; this wasn’t just any blossoming relationship, after all — it was
“Here,” said Malfoy, and he went to a door a few yards further down the corridor, away from the blasted wall where Fred died (Harry had to forcefully shove this thought away) and the Room of Requirement. Harry followed him inside and found an untouched classroom, western-facing and thus still somewhat dark. When the door was closed Malfoy turned back to him and reached immediately for Harry’s shirt, which Harry let him pull over his head.
"Good, 'cause clearly he likes blondes anyway," says Tracey with a snigger. "Go on, Daph, what's it like?"
When he looked back before climbing out of the portrait hole, he saw Parvati beaming at him and he flashed her a wink.
"She was shocked."
"No," said Harry truthfully. "It won't. But it won't be impossible. D'you know what you wanna do?"
Harry's chest expanded even further. "You don't mind?"
Apparently, the rest of the world agreed with Potter: Lucius Malfoy deserved no mercy.
“Less talking, more fucking, Potter,” Draco snapped, although even he could hear the strain in his voice, the lack of any real fire. Harry must have heard this, because a beaming, highly amused smile appeared on his face. Draco despised how good it looked there.
In fact, he hadn’t spoken to Pansy for nearly a week now. The last time had been the day after the debacle in the entrance hall with Theo, and Draco had proceeded to ream into her for going behind his back and telling her mum about the hex. Yes, it had turned out okay in the end, but for fuck’s sake, what if it
“Is that a yes to the date tomorrow?” Harry said against his mouth a minute later, delighting in the little irritated huff Malfoy let out in response.
done was helped him figure out the sizes he would need and how to order in advance, keeping in mind how quickly he would grow from here on out.
Draco knew the way his voice was going to sound, and so did not bother saying anything more than, “Yes.” Thinking of the way he felt about Harry. Thinking of the longing in his own heart every time he was pierced with those earth-shatteringly green eyes across a room.
"That's right."
Malfoy kicked him again under the table.
He’d done this while Ron was still browsing another part of the store, unwilling to explain why he’d just spent twelve Galleons on something he’d never wear. The box was shoved deep into a pocket within his cloak, and when they left the store fifteen minutes later, Ron was none the wiser.
For a long minute, Malfoy said nothing. Then —
The reference to something Granger had once said to him was not lost on Draco — those words, so humiliating, had lodged themselves in Draco’s brain forever, it seemed. Potter, he had learned in the last couple months, was really quite dry and sarcastic, and his teasing — at least when it was directed at Draco — was often merciless. This was nothing terribly new, of course: Potter had always gotten under his skin. The difference was that Draco had never before experienced it in a way that made his blood boil with lust instead of rage.
Wrists screaming and starting to bruise, his ribs sore where he’d been thrown into the wall, Draco pulled the sleeves of his robes down further as he walked into the library, past Madam Pince, and spotted Pansy sitting at a table with Blaise. Tracey, Daphne, and Theo were at another table nearby. Theo’s head was bent over his parchment; Tracey and Daphne seemed to be gossiping in low voices.
“No,” Draco said immediately, shocked by the turn Potter’s mind had taken. Too late Draco realised he’d just thrown away his only plausible cover story. “No, it, er — well, yes, maybe. I mean — I don’t know. I suppose it could have been, but it’s not a problem, Potter, honestly, it’s — they don’t hurt, I assure you —”
"All right, we're done here, I think," Hermione interjects, and finally he stops speaking. His face is a bit red. "Would you please put some tea on for us, Ron?"
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed. “I have no earthly idea how to talk to Malfoy.”
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry forcefully. “You may not be able to empathise with the concept of loyalty, Nott, but that doesn’t mean no one else can.”

had to be his new favourite expression.
"The game," Draco reminds himself, blinking owlishly. He's still a bit dazed, not to mention turned on and desperate for more of Harry's attention. Ravenous, even. Harry may have been having sex, but Draco hadn't.
“So,” he said as Harry pocketed his wand and pulled his jumper back on, which he’d discarded in the middle of their lesson. “I suppose I won’t see you until the weekend?”
"And me?"
Draco’s legs felt weak as he stood there against the wall, Potter’s hand working him over slowly and deliberately, two fingers now gliding slick through his pussy lips, gathering the wetness and spreading it so that there was no friction at all, just the slippery movement of warm fingers. Each time the longest finger brushed teasingly across Draco’s hole, his hands clenched their fistfuls of Potter’s robes, and each time he could feel Potter grinning against his skin, pleased with himself.
“What is that?”
“Yeah, he and Ron had Divination. Is everything okay? We were so
“Why do you have to do that?” he demands. Smoke comes drifting out of his mouth and nose as he speaks and Harry smiles at the picture he makes.
Jaw clenched again, Draco looked away from Theo, feeling all over again the enormity of what Potter had done for him. He knew Theo must have been thinking about it too — it hadn’t been a secret that Lucius Malfoy’s sentence had been overturned thanks to the Chosen One. The part that remained a secret was
“Yes, well. Thanks to you, all the monsters are gone, aren’t they?”
doesn’t have to choose between killing it or staying a bloody woman for nine more goddamn months. And
Malfoy must have dropped his own cigarette as well, because he lifted the hand that wasn’t closed around the Snitch and brushed some of Harry’s fringe away from his forehead, not scowling anymore but not smiling either. He looked contemplative now.
The weather as Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express Saturday morning was cruelly indifferent to his inner turmoil: the sky was a uniform, pellucid blue that reflected itself merrily in the dark windows of the train. Nor was there any hint of clouds — just the relentless glare of a winter sun, making the snow on the ground glimmer so brightly Harry had to look away lest he go blind.
Draco’s stomach somersaulted. Some deep part of him had thought maybe,

"You're right," she said again. There were tears misting up her eyes now. "I'm sorry, Draco. I should have talked to you about it. I was confused, I didn't know how to approach you, I just —"
"I don't have an allergy to romance!" Harry protested loudly, getting stares from a few people around them. "I just happen not to think tacky pink decorations are romantic!"
“What, you’re gonna deny it?”
“Thank you, Master Harry!” Kreacher croaked, bowing so low its nose touched the floor, along with the locket.
“As I said,” Theo’s voice broke Draco from his miserable reverie. He appeared to have been watching Draco, but if this was the case, he made no comment. “I’d like to talk
was why Harry had always shown up to school each year looking scrawny and underfed: because he
“You’re hard,” Potter informs him.
Draco's eyes widened and he ran over to a mirror, Harry laughing as he left the dorm.
"That must explain why he's happy to be rid of me, then," says Draco, savagely glad for the look of disgusted disappointment Hermione gives him before walking away. She goes to Weasley, who is surrounded by friends and drops an arm across her shoulders when she stands next to him. They are everything he and Harry never managed to figure out, stable and congruous and easy.
Draco’s gut twisted when he realised that somewhere along the line, his heart had begun believing in Harry's promises in spite of his brain's furious reminder that disaster was inevitable.
“Don’t be upset, kitten,” he whispered, at which point Draco’s entire body erupted into goosebumps. “Hermione still thinks it’s because I was obsessed with you.”
"Harry?"
"That sodding essay!" Ron shouted. Harry snorted into his tea. "I'll do it tonight!"
"Go away, Harry."
“Angelus Hirschkorn is an expert in the field of spell semantics,” Boothby told the class, flicking his wand at the board so the name spelled itself out in a tidy script. “He wrote a famous paper on the subject, stating his theory that the emotion behind the curse, as well as the way the curse was
But the owl stayed on a straight course, never turning to head for the owlery or one of the common rooms’ windows. Indeed, it seemed to be coming straight at Draco, and it was with less than a second to spare that Draco realised that was
"I love it," Harry insisted, "I love how open you've been with me, how easy it's been to talk to you. It's like there's this ... this whole thing between us we never noticed before, and I want ... I dunno, I wanna see what it is. Beyond the, you know ... the physical thing."
What would have happened, he wondered vaguely, if he hadn’t left? Or worse — if he hadn’t shoved Potter away? Might it have gone on even longer?
me anyway, Potter. Just … do what you were doing before …
"Well I think you're being a stupid git," she informs him with lifted brows.
Malfoy went expressionless and looked down at his lap.
Something that felt like a cold pebble of dread dropped into Draco’s stomach. He set down the piece of toast he’d only just buttered and looked with drawn eyebrows across the desk at Harry.

Five minutes, seven minutes, and he sits down on the steps out front.
“Is that right?” Harry says. It’s strained slightly, and he lets out a hoarse laugh. He opens his eyes and meets Draco’s, doing everything in his power not to lift his hips into the constant, torturous slide of that perfect hand. “Keeping in mind, of course, that you’ve always been a bit of a slut for it I do have to say you look more ravenous than usual.”

“Will you stay tonight?” Draco asks eventually. It’s a silly question that Harry answers with a snort and then another kiss.
Draco’s nuzzling his cheek now and Harry slips his arm back around him.
"Mr Goyle!" shouted McGonagall, a hand on her hat as she strode towards them, eyes flashing dangerously. Slughorn lagged behind her, looking completely out of his depth. "Mr Langley! That will be enough!"
Hermione asked, amusement dancing in her eyes even as a hand moved to cover her mouth and hide her giggle.
Mrs Weasley had taken Leo.
"Fancy yourself powerful enough without it, Potter?"
Everyone who had been watching came a bit closer and Harry saw Professor Flitwick come running out of his classroom just in time to hear Malfoy first begin moaning and then
“It’s okay,” Draco told him quietly, shifting his hips a little and hissing. “I liked it. When you let go, I mean.” His hand moved to cup Harry’s cheek, sure that he looked the way Harry had looked before — reverent, worshipful — and found he didn’t even have it within himself to care. Maybe he

Draco’s cunt, middle finger dipping between the labia and dragging across something that made Draco’s breath catch in his throat and his hands tighten where he was still gripping Potter’s robes. He let out a low moan that he simply couldn’t help, and he could feel Potter smiling against his neck.
Harry opened his mouth to answer, only to close it again when he realised he didn’t have one.
what you wanted, huh?” Harry cooed. “Say it, kitten. Say it or you won’t get anything.”
The latter briefly shifted to the back of his mind, however, when the former walked into the pub ahead of a nameless, dark-haired bloke who was holding the door for him.
"You’re acting like we’ve never shagged before," Draco tried to joke as Harry latched onto his neck and began backing him towards the bed. He knew perfectly well the significance, but he couldn’t help himself.
“Sure,” Harry said, kicking his foot in the water and destroying an enormous formation of pink bubbles. “I have Quidditch practise set for Monday and Wednesday evenings and Friday mornings. We could keep doing Wednesday nights, like tonight. Does that work for you?”
endearing.
They stayed this way for a long couple of minutes, sweaty bodies pressed together, Harry still trembling faintly and Draco running fingers through his sweaty hair. He could feel Harry’s come leaking out around his cock, and he found that he didn’t hate it. Maybe even liked it. Eventually Harry lifted his head and, after meeting his eyes, he caught Draco’s mouth in a kiss that shook the whole foundation of Draco’s world.
His mother had once referred to his
However, this too was shifted to the back of his mind when, upon leaving the Potions classroom, someone bumped into his shoulder hard. Before he could react, a piece of parchment was stuffed into his hand, and Draco looked around to see Harry walking away. He fought hard against a grin.
"Draco," she said again.
“What were you doing up so early?” she questioned him on the way down to the Great Hall. “Don’t tell me you’ve been studying behind my back.”
, Potter," said Malfoy the moment Ron and Hermione were gone. "You realise that, don't you?"
“Harry,” Ron’s voice drifted across Harry’s consciousness as if from far away. After several more moments where Malfoy finally realised Harry was staring and they simply looked at each other, he finally tore his gaze away, something achy and longing in his chest.

“I s’pose I still haven’t entirely broken myself of the habit of eating like a fucking —”
“What if it doesn’t last?” he said finally. “What if next week he realises it was a huge mistake?”
Wondering, too, what he’d sensed within that last kiss, and if Potter wasn’t telling him something.

The first was that, whatever had happened to the rest of his body, Malfoy’s face looked … well, it looked

Mrs Weasley came round the table and with a few deft flicks of her wand Draco's platinum blond hair fell to the kitchen floor, leaving him in the end with something much shorter and

know my best mate?"
There was a shocked silence that engulfed the small crowd, and Boothby was the first to break it.
Potter had insisted on finishing off the bottle of firewhisky they’d started a couple weeks ago, and Draco had to admit he was quite enjoying himself, spread out on his stomach on his bed, half paying attention to the pages of his own notes he was flipping through, trying to assure himself he’d done well on his exams this week, the other half of his attention on Potter, who was sitting at Draco’s desk with the chair propped back on two legs, looking effortlessly,

," he says again, voice breaking in the middle of it. Potter only speeds up his fingers, slamming them into Draco's pussy, and he gives a short cry when his orgasm hits him like a speeding train. It's earth-shattering, his hips jerking as Potter fucks him through it, leaning into him heavily with his own body to keep Draco in place.
“Did he say something to you?” Draco asked, voice low and hesitant.
you’ve been off with somebody, Draco. Zabini thinks he’s such a goddamned brilliant liar, but I can see right the fuck through him. Come on, then. Who’ve you been slagging around with?”
Harry said nothing. He was usually so polite, so well-mannered, so genuinely diplomatic even when it came to people Draco knew he disliked. There was none of that now as he silently watched Adrian leave, shut the door behind him with a quiet
It was all very confusing and emotionally draining, and that was on

He found his shirt and glasses and pulled them on, then collected the cloak and his wand.

fucking do, when Draco says, “Kit introduced me to his sister yesterday.” And Harry swallows it all back like the most acidic bile. “He was all, like,” he gestures characteristically with his hands, “intimate about it, you know?” And barely suppressing a satisfied little grin, he continues, “Like, parents next? I mean, he’s
“Sure,” Harry croaked, “but
relevant." Harry grazes gentle fingers along Draco's ankle, letting the pads of them brush the bare skin above his sock. Draco lets it happen for only a few moments before pulling his foot in and averting his eyes back to the street. He draws on the cigarette just to give himself something else to focus on. "I know you couldn't stand it when we fought. I couldn't either. But, Draco ... it's bound to happen. It feels like so long since the war, since Hogwarts, but it hasn't been. It's not quite six years ago I was running round Britain trying to get rid of Voldemort while he camped out at your house. And we've only been together
She was quiet a moment, and then: "That's a very morbid analogy, Draco. I thought most people say it’s like flying. I mean, without the hitting-the-ground part.”
!” Draco broke off on a moan when Harry’s hand cupped him suddenly through his trousers, pressing up against his needy cunt.

doing here, Potter?” His father’s voice had dipped to a sultry, antagonistic tone. “Scrambling for anything to get your face in the news now that the Dark Lord is gotten rid of?”
“This isn’t a ‘sticky situation,’ Potter,” Malfoy said through a clenched jaw, but there was less venom in his voice. Harry’s eyes caught on the way Malfoy’s plump lower lip was suddenly trapped between his teeth, felt his gaze moving lower, and promptly shot back up to meet Malfoy’s eyes again when he realised what he was doing. “I’ve been turned into a
He wonders if Potter sees him as he saw the Dark Lord, as he saw his father: as something evil, and that’s why he’s been pitching the remorse spiel every other night for a week. Potter seems like the sort of person to see in black and white: good or evil, no in between, no room for shades of uncertainty or the fumbling indecisiveness of a petrified sixteen-year-old Death Eater trying to save his parents.
His father turned his cold gaze on Draco. For several moments, he was utterly silent, but Draco could see his sunken chest rising and falling more quickly, and then suddenly he was standing up from his chair with a horrible, slightly deranged look in his eyes.
Sometimes it’s difficult to express the enormity of it – he struggles to get it across to Harry, the depth of what he’s feeling, but
"Fine — what was the question?"
He brought Harry to the library, where he'd known he could keep the gifts without them being found. Quite ironically it
“Are you immortal?” Draco asks. Potter doesn’t laugh, although he does look a little disturbed for the first time.
“This isn’t an apology,” Draco said forcefully, eyebrows coming together. There was no immediate reason to be feeling irritated, Potter hadn’t really done anything wrong, but the habit was so ingrained it was hard to fight. That, and this new stoic thing he was doing was really beginning to get under Draco’s skin. “It’s an explanation. I’m not sorry, Potter. And besides, if I want the message to get through that thick head into your pea-sized brain, I know that I need to say it in person. Otherwise you’ll show up under that damnable Cloak again every time I try to have a midnight soak.”
“Which is why I, unlike you,” Draco returns with a drawl, “am going to look incredible. Hope you won’t feel too sad when I go off with some hot vampire thirsting after my blood. And arse,” he adds, like an afterthought. Harry laughs, grabs Draco’s elbow, and tugs him down onto the sofa beside him. Draco lets out a soft, indignant squawk that for some reason makes Harry unreasonably hard.
"Draco —"
Minutes slipped by without notice, and finally Potter’s hands moved to cup his face, breathing hard and stealing breathless kiss after breathless kiss until they were doing nothing more than panting into one another’s mouths.
“You,” was all Draco could manage to gasp out, flushing so hard at this wanton admission that it spread all the way down his neck, and god, he didn’t even
“I’ll have to Glamour it, you know,” says Draco. He’s frowning a little in thought, although it’s hard to be rational when his blood is heavy with alcohol and he keeps realising anew that he’s permanently stamped with a reminder of this moment in time. This moment when the only thing that truly feels important is making sure he never forgets how good this is – how deep and permeating and all-consuming his feelings are.

"You will come with me immediately," Harry heard McGonagall say, her voice loud but steady. "You too, Mr Langley.
Before Draco could say anything else, Potter had dipped away, back towards his group of friends, towards his real life. Draco stayed hidden among the shelves another few minutes before going back to his table and, instead of finishing his essay like he’d planned, he packed up his things and went to meet Pansy and Blaise at lunch.
"Er — what are you working on?"
Sure, they'd gone ahead and allowed everyone to see them hanging out; that didn't mean they needed people to start speculating what they were doing together

look — obsessively, even. He traces the lines of that beautiful, terrifying scar with the pads of his fingers, and commits the shapes to memory, and knows that he could draw it with his eyes closed if he wanted to.
“You think that’s real, then, do you, Draco?” he said after a moment; there was a mean gleam in his eyes that sent a shiver of revulsion through Draco’s body. “You think Potter here likes you for more than your perky new tits and a place to put his cock? There’s not a bloke in this school who hasn’t thought about fucking you since you got hexed —”
“I think I said ‘very pretty,’ actually,” Hermione interrupted, looking far too amused. Harry scowled.
” cleaning them both of Potter’s mess, and the one Draco had left on Potter’s face. Potter tucked himself back into his jeans and did them back up, then grabbed for his glasses.
Malfoy, who had had the Chosen One’s cock in his mouth just a couple hours ago.
The humiliation clings to him all day and it's the first thing he remembers upon waking up Thursday morning.
“That’s just what it’s called,” Draco explained, grinning. He touched a kiss to Harry’s cheek. “People are quite touchy about terminology.”
He lifted his head when he’d gotten some semblance of a normal breathing rhythm back and looked down at an oddly open-faced Malfoy, whose grey eyes were, for the first time in memory, not cold and calculating but bright with wonder.
It was almost entirely students tonight — all fourth-year and above — but there were Ministry officials dotted here and there as well, not to mention a couple witches and wizards who were clearly from the

it even, but Potter's words had sounded sickeningly sincere, and as much as Draco loved to believe that Potter was nothing more than the hyped-up hero his father had always insisted he was, that image of the Boy Who Lived had already begun cracking and falling to pieces since the day nearly five months ago now that Potter had saved his life.

She scooped up her book and, looking stubbornly determined, crossed the common room to where Malfoy was sitting. Harry and Ron both turned to watch, as did a few other people who'd noticed. Malfoy himself looked up only when Hermione actually sat down in the chair next to him, and he startled so badly Harry saw him drop his quill. Harry wondered privately whether this wasn't simply Hermione's way of trying to engage him, Potions being a very convenient excuse.
“Good. I don’t know how a piece of shit like you got into Gryffindor, but mark my words, I’ll have my eye on you from now on.”
idea?”
“That’s it,” Draco goads him. His own cock is bobbing precariously above Harry’s stomach, red and swollen and dribbling pre-come out of the slit. “Put your fucking back into it, Potter, fuck me like you mean it.”
Even before Potter spoke, Draco would have known it was him, and not just because Potter was the only one capable of invisibly sneaking up on people. It was his smell. It made Draco feel dizzy with lust.
The word
"Really weird," Draco said, pushing fingers through his hair and heaving a deep sigh. "I feel like it's gonna be a few hours before I really ... before it hits me fully, d'you know what I mean? I haven't processed it yet."
"You're a bit shorter than you used to be, aren't you?" Ron said, coming over to them now. He looked amazed and, if Draco wasn't mistaken, a little wary.
It happens again — he retches, clutches his stomach, waits for it to pass.
"No, I ..." Ron shook his head, then burst into a smile. "Well, that's bloody brilliant! Where're you gonna take her?"
for Malfoy.” She looked over at him, as though the sentence had been so ludicrous she’d half expected him to laugh and tell her she’d gone barmy. When he didn’t, her cheeks took on a faint tinge of pink, and she nodded. “I see … so, it’s true, then? You and he are …?”
