Snape sighed. "Look, there's nothing I can say to change your opinion if you don't give them a chance. See for yourself. Look into them, search for goodness, isn't that what you do?"
She looked so much like his mother, and at the same time so so different that his stomach jolted pitifully. His mother was charming, graceful, elegant and Bellatrix on the other hand was ¬†repellent, repugnant, obscene, putrid,

That grouping was of course, excluding the ones that were out there to kill him.
He opened his eyes to reality. He realised that he wasn't a child anymore, an ignorant, puny student who didn't have control over anything. He was
He immediately cringed. It was pathetic really. Harry's glorious transition from a 'Liar' to the great and prolific 'Chosen One' was quicker than one could think. The public adored him, now more than ever and all he wanted to do was throw bricks at the Ministry for filling them up with hope. Worthless hope that he, Harry Potter can save the world.
"Everyone?" Snape asked.

Draco blocked them out. They argued some more, talked in hushed noises but Draco couldn't think, couldn't move, couldn't stand another second in this place. He needed to leave. Right. Now.
Snape broke the contact for a few seconds before looking up at him again. "Slytherins are believed to be ambitious, resourceful, proud,

"Oh, I don't mind sharing, Lucius." Bellatrix skipped in. Horrified, Draco looked at his mother, hoping she'd say something. Something that won't fucking
. Oh, so so yucky. He was certain that one couldn't be any more vomitous.
He blinked back tears at her last words. The ¬†clavier guise that held her eyes, the aloof air the surrounded her frame, was not something he was used to. He remembers last year, when she had hugged and kissed and embraced him as he grew a year older. How she peppered soft kisses on his forehead and requested him to grow no older as she'll always want him with her, in her arms. He remembers being embarrassed by the display of affection and he remembers cherishing every moment of it.
"Umm‚Ä¶No?" He gave himself a mental shove at the pathetic response. "I mean no. I was awake. What do you need?"

really. It was however, oddly believable. The way a mere look at the boy made Draco want to rip his head off, was proof enough that Potter is, by all means, a tempting opponent. His confidence disguises as strength and makes him look powerful. And maybe he is, in his own way. Manipulative, disobedient, intimidating, carefree. Carefree, even after being targeted by the Darkest wizard to walk the grounds.
Not that he
'No', he wanted to say. For no good reason, but that he's stubborn. But it's merely an impractical word, isn't it? Though used so frequently and spoken so confidently that you'd think, it works. That saying 'NO' ceases all our problems. But guess what; NO, it doesn't.

"But know this, with pain comes power." He smiled horridly. "With pain, comes relief."

of others who regarded him as a liar. Still. As a puppet feigning gracelessly in the long, manipulative hands of the Ministry, spell-lessly imperioused by them. Or Dumbledore, in a truer sense. And last year was proof enough that he could be despised as thoroughly as the inverse.
He wonders if this was how Sirius felt. Stuck in a place with no one but his own thoughts for company when everyone else was working with their lives at risk. But Sirius was far more superior than Harry is, in every aspect. Better at coping with loss and being judged, dealing with uselessness and guilt. Guilt was probably the only thing he could relate with his godfather. To be held responsible for the loss of the people you love, if not by others but yourself.

He quirked a smile as it hit him with sudden clarity that he'd do it. He'd do anything to make her proud. And the thought of
A man in cloak.
A mask.
"Didn't the Dark Lord send you to fetch the boy, Bella?" He growled at her, glistening eyes fixed on Draco. "Or is your catnap more important than his command?"
"My Lord." The words escaped his tongue, graced with ease. He felt at home.
"What's the point?" He asked carefully. Politely even. Snape looked up at him, his expression unreadable.
He wasn't quite sure why he felt that way. He's known it for years now, what his parents were, what had to be done when fate calls for it. But the transparent contrast between the future and the present, between words and actions hit him brutally.
. A wave of power twitched inside him. He felt it everywhere.
The other half of his mind was reeling. And he couldn't help but think that Snape's words made sense. That the Slytherins really were being excluded and that if the same continues, it'll be too late they'll make the wrong decision. That they still had a chance.
Snape was asking Harry to hold his greasy hand? Duh, from the looks of it. But, really what the fuck?
Curious, he headed closer towards the window and tried to map him out. The man had long, dark hair and was moving closer towards him. He came closer and closer until his face came alive in the faint light.
If Snape was surprised, he didn't show it. The D.A was old news now anyways.
He saw the Dark Lord smile and felt giddy. Felt elated in a way he never felt before. Joyous, excited,
The wide sweep of territory spread insolently about the Manor, the lively vineyards charged with the wishful delight of summer; did nothing to settle his nerves. The chirpy cheerfulness instead managed to generously dwindle the sense of unease, that was as alien to him as beggary.
Harry exhaled. The 'pink arsed' comment was rather unnecessary, he'll agree. But annoyance and smart-words never go hand in hand. Snape's comment did lighten the air, though and Harry took a moment to ponder if that's what he was aiming for.
"Tha-that won't be necessary. I'll arrange something for him." Lucius stuttered.
"Sure." Snape offered. Harry exhaled, and waited. Waited. And waited.
Maybe not
Just by the door, she retreated.
Snape nodded, a hint of satisfaction quirking his face. "I'm taking you somewhere."
"That's the point, Potter." He sighed. He looked tired, eyes heavy with the apparent lack of sleep and amplitude of baggage to worry about. Looking at him, Harry thought he should at least make an effort to hear him out, no matter how ludicrous his request was.
And a thought hit him. "Dumbledore sent you here, didn't he?"
This time, the cold caused it.
It sounded like an insult. Or that may have been his imagination.

For having expectations? To think one deserves a chance?

Malfoy?"
Harry gave him a jerky nod before gesturing him to follow him upstairs. He opened the door and realised a little too late that his room
"Well done, young Malfoy. Very well done. I knew you'd take it well." The voice was dirty. Horrid. Cold. He didn't look up. What has he done?
Harry woke up one night with his scar hurting after a strange dream and Draco convinced Harry to tell his parents. Narcissa and Lucius hid their worries about this information and the told the children they had nothing to worry about, which was a relief to both kids.
The Yule Ball happened that night and they all had a blast. Draco and Harry danced together for most of the night and during the last song, Draco asked Harry to be his boyfriend. Harry agreed.
During their side meeting, Barty Crouch, who had been missing for weeks, stumbled out of the forest and mumbled things about how Voldemort was getting stronger and he had personally done something bad. When Harry returned back with Dumbledore in tow, Crouch was gone and Krum was stunned.
Draco then watched as his two best friends disappeared and reappeared walking through the hospital wing door with a wicked story to tell and Sirius being free.
They all took Care of Magical Creatures together and Hagrid ended up forcing them to ride Buckbeak, the Hippogriff, together, which was ten times more exciting than riding a broom. Even so, their favorite class that year was DADA by far. Professor Lupin introduced them to Boggarts their first class and it challenged all three of them. To everyone‚Äôs enjoyment, Neville was faced with Severus Snape, starting the class off with the sight of their Potion‚Äôs professor in a dress and large hat. Hermione‚Äôs was Professor McGonagall handing her a failing grade; she turned the grade into a muggle confetti cannon that McGonagall shot above the students. Draco was next and came face to face with a black hooded figure wearing a silver, skull-like Death Eater mask. Draco froze and Professor Lupin looked ready to step in, until he changed the Death Eater robes horrendous pink and the mask was covered in ridiculous flowers.
‚ÄúNice work, Draco-.‚Äù Fred said.
That was how Harry ended up in Slytherin and enemies with Ron Weasley, thanks to the blonde boy he now knew was Draco Malfoy. Draco helped him through his first potions class with Professor Snape and Harry prevented Draco from being a prat to Neville Longbottom. He spent the months leading up to Halloween learning about blood status and debating with his fellow Slytherins on if it still mattered. Harry was not alone in defending half-bloods and muggle borns, much to Draco‚Äôs chagrin.
In May, Slytherin faced off against Gryffindor and it was a pretty close game the entire time. But in the end Harry caught the snitch and won the game for Slytherin by just enough to with the House Cup once again. The rest of the month was filled with studying for final exams and Hermione finally dropped Divination after having enough.
On the night of May 24, the champions were called to the quidditch pitch, where they were informed that a maze would be grown for the final task and their goal was to find the Triwizard Cup in the center of the maze. After the meeting, Victor Krum pulled Harry to the side, near the forbidden forest, and asked about his relationship with Hermione. Harry assured Krum that he was dating Draco and was just friends with Hermione.
Following the reveal, Harry was taken to Dumbledore‚Äôs office where the Malfoys were waiting. Harry explained everything that happened while he was with Voldemort and he was then sent to the hospital wing where he was given a Sleeping Potion to help him sleep.
Draco squeezed Harry‚Äôs hand tightly before stepping back to let Harry take his turn. The whole class was surprised to see a Dementor take form. Before Harry could faint, Remus took his place and turned the full moon into a balloon that shot back into the cabinet.
The five of them went their separate ways at the platform and Harry once again went home with the Malfoys. With Voldemort‚Äôs return, both Harry and Draco were glad that Lucius hadn‚Äôt been involved in either of the attacks this year.
The first day of classes went by without issue, Hermione had narrowed down the classes she was taking so she no longer needed the Time Turner. Following dinner, Ron confronted Draco about an article in the Daily Prophet, claiming that Mr. Malfoy, along with other exonerated Death Eaters, was involved in the attack at the Quidditch tournament. Draco ignored the accusations, knowing the truth, and tossed an insult at Ron before turning away with Harry in tow. Before Ron could toss a curse at Draco, Moody stepped in and turned Ron into a red-haired ferret, bouncing him around to the amusement of the watching students. McGonagall ruined the fun by undoing the spell and berating Moody.
Draco was pulled off of Harry by Hermione as Madam Pomfrey and Professor Snape ran onto the pitch. In a short minute, Harry was being levitated to the infirmary. The Slytherin team all landed and ran over to see what was going on. Lucian Bole and Peregrine Derrick, two of the Slytherin players helped an injured Draco limp to the infirmary while Flint went off to yell at Diggory.
Because the Goblet was a binding contract, Harry was forced to participate in the tournament, much to his dismay. The four contestants and the judges discussed the competition and the first task would be on the 24
They wrote to Sirius and the Malfoys the following morning. When they got letters back, both letters scolded Harry for being out alone with Victor when clearly someone dangerous was wondering around Hogwarts. Both letters also told Harry to practice defensive spells for the third task, since he‚Äôd need to protect himself from what‚Äôs in the maze.
After a few days of rest, Harry was released from the hospital wing. He offered Cedric‚Äôs parents the winnings, but they denied him. He then headed to the end of term feast where a memorial feast was being held for Cedric. Dumbledore informed the whole school of Voldemort‚Äôs return, freaking out most of the students.
Draco eventually did on a trip to Hogsmeade. He asked Harry over a couple of butterbeers and Harry happily accepted the invite.
The next few months were filled with quidditch and Patronus practice for the Silver Trio, along with a lot of studying for exams. They all improved at their Patronus charm, and Draco was able to produce an incorporeal Patronus pretty quick after discussing memories with Harry. Draco‚Äôs new memory also involved holding hands with Harry.
Harry spent his Christmas break at Malfoy manor, and was surprised to find two brooms under the tree with his name on it. The Malfoys are surprised as well, having bought Harry only one replacement broom. They immediately sent the second one out to be inspected for hexes and the like. Over the break, Draco and Harry spent a lot of time outside practicing quidditch on their brooms and discussing the next semester.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder no one can stand her, she‚Äôs a nightmare‚Äù Ron said, irritated.
Their year becomes increasingly more complicated when words showed up, written in blood, on the wall in one of the main corridors of the castle. ‚ÄúTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR BEWARE.‚Äù The whole school stumbled upon the message following the Halloween feast. Next to the message hung Mrs. Norris, Filch‚Äôs beloved cat.
of November at 1 a.m. They would talk then.
Harry was ready to face the accusations and insults as long as he had Draco by his side.
‚ÄúFor Ronnie-kins.‚Äù
On October 30, the students were assembled in the Great Hall as they waited for the new schools to arrive. First arrived the Beauxbaton students, then arrived the Durmstrang students. That night, the Goblet of Fire was revealed to all the students and it was announced that the Goblet will accept three students, one from each school, to participate in the tournament. The champions were to be selected the following night at the Halloween feast.
The following day, the Silver Trio decide ¬†to find the twins for one last day together before break. They found the twins getting yelled at by Ron, who was holding Scabbers, with his two friends flanking him. They headed over to see what the commotion was about.
On Halloween, Draco had to encounter the Weasleys often enough that he felt like he needed a hot shower. He got a hard elbow to the ribs for that comment.
The five of them separated to sit at their respective tables, and Draco and Harry got some more teasing from their Slytherin friends about their relationship. It seemed to bother Harry.
The twins were not impressed, and they hexed Ron and his friends for weeks following the match, along with most of Slytherin house.
Before the twins could react, Hermione had her wand in Ron‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúYou foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!‚Äù
The game went well and Slytherin was winning by 30 points. Harry spotted the snitch and dove for it, quickly followed by Cho Chang, the Ravenclaw seeker. He froze when Cho screamed behind him. He looked up to see three dementors in the middle of the Gryffindor section. He reacted quickly, pulling out his wand and casting the Patronus charm. Once casted he flew and grabbed the snitch while Cho was still distracted.
‚ÄúThe first task is dragons?‚Äù
Ron blubbered in fear. The twins each laid a hand on Hermione‚Äôs shoulders. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay-.‚Äù
That year, they rode the train with the Twins and Hermione. After all they went through last year, they became closer than ever, close enough that Hermione even spent the last few weeks of summer at The Burrow after the Weasleys returned from Egypt. They exchanged prank ideas, treats from the trolley, and summer stories until the Dementors took over the Hogwarts Express. Harry heard a woman scream and everything went black.
Looking back now, as he walked into Hogwarts as an incoming fifth year, Harry wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.
Draco was not thrilled to wake up in the middle of the lake.
‚ÄúWell, you could fly.‚Äù
A few days before the first task, the Twins found Harry and told him to meet them at midnight that night, the 22
A week later the Yule Ball was announced, and Harry was thrilled he didn‚Äôt have to worry about a date, assuming Draco would ask him. Hermione got asked out by Victor Krum and was happy to tell her best friends about it. They were happy for her. The Twins easily found their own dates as well, leaving Harry to wait for Draco to ask him.
Finally Snape showed up, though Harry quickly stunned him. Following that, they soon discovered that Scabbers was Peter Pettigrew and the 7 of them, with Peter, made their way out of the Shrieking Shack and through the tunnel once again. The twins supported Draco, whose leg was now broken. Harry and Sirius talked about Sirius being Harry‚Äôs godfather, and Sirius offered to have his godson come live with him. Harry readily agreed, even though he loved living with the Malfoys. His agreement left Draco feeling disheartened.
‚ÄúTo the two people who can teach Ron a lesson.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was then that I knew we‚Äôd be the best of friends‚Ä¶it was then that I knew I wanted to be a Slytherin.‚Äù
It‚Äôs pouring rain the whole match and the late fall chill left the spectators shivering in their coats. Harry and the Hufflepuff seeker, Cedric Diggory, struggled to find the snitch in the downpour. Points continued to add up, Slytherin staying ahead by a consistent 50 points. With a glimpse of gold, Harry flew into the clouds. He lost sight of the gold when frost spread across his goggles. He weaved through the clouds and the attacking Dementors but was overcome by the sheer amount of them. Black overtook his vision and he fell from the sky.
The task itself went by really quick. One second Harry was selecting a mini dragon from a bag, the next he was entering the arena to face off against a Hungarian Horntail. He took a minor injury during the task but was able to use his Quidditch skills to swoop in and retrieve the golden egg.
Following the match, the Twins and Hermione visited the Malfoy‚Äôs tent. They hung out for awhile until there was commotion outside. Mr. Malfoy and Narcissa burst into the tent and quickly began to escort the children to safety. Once they were away from the commotion, the adults apparated the children to Malfoy Manor. They later found out that it was a bunch of Death Eaters that attacked the crowd. Draco was thrilled to see that his father was not involved in the terror.
A black dog came running over, jumping over the kids and grabbing Draco‚Äôs leg, dragging him kicking and screaming into a passage under the Whomping Willow.
‚ÄúHermione, he‚Äôs not even-.‚Äù
Harry later passed out during Divination and had a vision of Voldemort torturing Wormtail for letting someone escape. When he woke up his scar was throbbing, and he headed out of class, claiming to go to the hospital wing, but instead he headed to Dumbledore‚Äôs office. He then overheard an argument between Moody, Dumbledore, and Cornelius Fudge, until Moody announced that he had arrived.
Harry remembered staring wide-eyed at the blonde, silver-eyed boy as they got measured for their robes. He had never seen someone look so enthusiastic as he rambled on about brooms, a quid itch, a slithering, and something called a huffle puff. Wait, what in the world was this kid talking about?
While Draco had been extremely reluctant to befriend Granger and the Weasley twins, Harry had convinced him. Therefore, the Malfoy heir had worked up the courage to ask his father to not antagonize the Weasleys anymore, since he considered Fred and George to be two of his best friends. Over the summer Harry and himself had asked Lucius to not use the term mudblood, and with the help of Narcissa, who would do anything for her son, they spent the summer free of blood prejudice nonsense. They also avoided a potentially ruthless confrontation in Flourish and Blotts.
Harry landed with his team and they all started celebrating, much to the dismay of the landing Ravenclaw team. The twins came over to congratulate Draco and Harry on a fantastic game followed closely by Professor Lupin who was escorting three cloaked students.
As finals approached, the Silver Trio and the Twins practiced defensive and offensive spells whenever they could to help Harry.
When Narcissa found out the diary was at the school because of her own husband, well, Harry was glad to be at the Dursley‚Äôs for those few weeks. The letters he received from Draco proved just how terrifying Narcissa Malfoy could be.
Sirius‚Äô demeanor became less threatening. ‚Äú..Cissy?‚Äù
Harry spent the summer with the Malfoys once again. They planned on having their yearly summer ball as well as attend the Quidditch World Cup.
It‚Äôs an overall successful first year.
For the first time in their friendship, Harry and Draco were forced to separate for one of the electives. Draco decided to take Ancient Runes while Harry took Divination. Hermione herself was taking all the electives, which Draco quickly discovered was thanks to a Time Turner though he never mentioned it; he merely made sure to read Hermione‚Äôs notes on the classes he was interested in taking, but didn‚Äôt have time.
After dinner, Mad-Eye Moody was introduced and the tournament was announced. Following the announcements, Draco and Harry discovered Hermione was on a hunger strike for house elves‚Äô rights, and the Twins were scheming on how to get around the age limit on the tournament.
When it came time to return to Hogwarts, both boys were ready to face off against the world together. They were going to be the most powerful couple in the whole school, and Draco was ready to take his position as Prince of Slytherin this year. They weren‚Äôt going to have any trouble within their own house if Draco had anything to say about it.
‚ÄúHarry!‚Äù Hermione called out when she saw Harry‚Äôs eyelids flutter then open.
birthday and received a Nimbus 2001. Harry and Draco spent the summer practicing for Quidditch tryouts in the Fall.
She nodded and lowered her wand before punching Ron in the nose, much to her friends‚Äô glee. Ron dropped Scabbers and ran inside, followed by Seamus and Dean. Scabbers ran off down the hill.
The next morning, he was disappointed to find that Draco and Hermione were missing. Right when he needed their encouragement. The Twins escorted Harry down to the second task before joining the crowd to watch. When the task began, Harry swallowed the plant and gained gills and webbed fingers. He swam to the bottom of the lake to discover Draco and Hermione had been taken from him. He watched as Cedric came for Cho and Krum came for Hermione. He watched as no one came for Fleur‚Äôs sister. He freed the girl and fought off the merpeople to return to the surface with both Draco and Fleur‚Äôs sister.
Their second semester was filled with the search for the Sorcerer‚Äôs stone, encouraged by Hermione‚Äôs interest in the trap door the Weasley twins discovered in the forbidden corridor. The Silver Trio took on the different tasks and Harry defeated Professor Quirrell and Voldemort. With the extra points they received, the Slytherin House crushed the other houses for the House Cup.
Hermione turned back towards the castle and gasped. ‚ÄúGuys! Look out!‚Äù
Draco nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good memory.‚Äù He reached over and squeezed Harry‚Äôs hand.
‚ÄúAlright, class dismissed!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat did the twins want?‚Äù The two of them sat on a love seat together, despite the late time and Draco wrapped his arms around his Harry.
During a disagreement between the Slytherin and Gryffindor teams, Ron showed up and tried to make Draco eat slugs. Instead, it was Harry when he shoved his best friend out of the way. While it sucked to cough up slugs for a few hours, it was almost worth it to see the twins throw curses at their own flesh and blood for a week straight, including the jelly-legs curse and the babbling curse. Even Hermione joined in and floated spiders into Ron‚Äôs hair a few times.
Harry and Draco spent their Christmas holidays at Malfoy Manor, where Harry was treated like their second son. He came to adore Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy and had the first true Christmas of his life. He also learned to dance with his best friend at their family‚Äôs annual Yule Ball.
The next morning, Harry sent a letter to the Malfoys and Sirius to update them on the tournament. He knew the Malfoys would be furious that he had to participate. The following weeks were filled with tons of students, from all three schools, shunning and insulting Harry, all believing he somehow cheated his way into the tournament.
‚ÄúThe first task is dragons.‚Äù
It took an hour for Harry to wake up, during which Pomfrey tended to Draco‚Äôs bruised ribs and sprained ankle and Harry‚Äôs concussion and dislocated shoulder. The Slytherin team sat on the bed next to Draco and Hermione, Fred and George occupied the bed on Harry‚Äôs other side. A few of their third-year classmates had passed through and promised to come back when Harry woke.
The large group of people inside the infirmary filled Harry in on what happened. The Dementors, Malfoy‚Äôs heroic catch, and finally Harry‚Äôs broom being demolished by the Whomping Willow. Harry was then fed chocolate and forced to stay in the infirmary all weekend. Draco never left his side, even after he was released.
Quidditch season began in a few short weeks and the Silver Trio spent most their time practicing on the pitch and studying in the stands, respectively. With enough practice, Slytherin was a shoo-in to win the Quidditch Cup. Following their first Hogsmeade‚Äôs weekend, which Harry attended thanks to Narcissa helping him with the permission slip, Slytherin took on Hufflepuff.
‚ÄúDragons?‚Äù
‚Äú‚ÄôMione? What happened?‚Äù
The following day, students sat around the Goblet to watch who would be entering the tournament. The Twins tried to use an ageing potion to get past the age line but were repelled and grew gray hair and beards. This caused much amusement to the spectating students.
‚ÄúThe Hogwarts Houses. Slytherin, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.‚Äù And the kid was off again, spouting off knowledge until both of them had been measured and they walked out of the shop. The only time the blonde stopped to breathe was when he insulted Hagrid.
The Silver Trio received a letter from Sirius, telling them to meet him in Hogsmeade with some food. When they met up with Sirius, they began to discuss all the disappearances and Karkaroff‚Äôs suspicious meeting with Snape that Harry overheard. Not much got done during this meeting, but Sirius warned the children not to wonder around the grounds, for safety reasons.
Lucius and Narcissa spent the summer teaching the boys defensive and offensive spells to help keep them safe during the upcoming school year. They knew things were going to be hard for the boys, from Death Eater accusations, to people not believing Harry after all the bashing articles over the summer. They wanted their boys to be prepared for anything.
That evening, the three names came out of the Goblet: Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff from Hogwarts, Victor Krum from Durmstrang, and Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons. What shocked everyone was when a fourth name came out of the Goblet ‚Äì Harry Potter.
Fred and George decided they were their favorite two Slytherins of all time, when Harry and Draco, with the help of Hermione, charmed all the Gryffindor uniforms to turn Slytherin green when they left the changing rooms for the first Quidditch match. The bitter Gryffindors blamed the uniform debacle for the lost match, but the twins knew the prank was harmless. From then on, the twins pranked anyone that seemed out to get their favorite Silver Trio and made sure the three found Weasley sweaters under their trees Christmas morning.
Moody ushered Harry away during all the chaos. It was then revealed to Harry that Moody was the one to enter his name in the Goblet. It was Moody that helped Cedric with the second task. It was Moody who helped Harry within the maze. Moody then attempted to kill Harry for his master, Voldemort, when Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall appeared and stunned Moody. He was then given veritaserum and revealed everything. He was then revealed to be Barty Crouch Jr. using a Polyjuice potion.
The following week an article went out by Rita Skeeter, stating that Hermione was leading both Harry and Victor on, playing with both of their hearts. This led to a lot of hate mail for Hermione, which quickly began to bother her. This also led to Hermione being suspicious of how Rita Skeeter was getting her information, since she was banned from school grounds.
Following Harry‚Äôs final in Divination, Trelawney gave a real prediction, predicting the return of Voldemort and one of his followers. He told his friends, and they all debateed what it could mean and if it was even real.
With the second task quickly approaching, Harry‚Äôs friends tried to convince him to take Cedric‚Äôs advice about the egg. He eventually agreed and headed to the prefects‚Äô bathroom with the golden egg. With a little help from Moaning Myrtle, Harry opened the egg underwater and learned the second task would involve going underwater to save someone from the lake who were taken by the merpeople.
However, before they could return to the castle, the full moon appeared, and Remus turned into a werewolf. Chaos ensued and ended with Draco, Harry and Hermione in the hospital wing, with the twins watching over them, and Sirius Black being sentenced to the Dementor‚Äôs kiss.
Draco and his parents watched from the sidelines, though they couldn‚Äôt see much. It was over an hour later when Lucius hissed in pain and clutched his arm, where Draco knew his father‚Äôs Dark Mark was. This worried all three of them and they were relieved when Harry appeared through portkey in the middle of the arena. Their relief disappeared when they noticed a dead Cedric and crying Harry. The three of the pushed through the crowd to get to Harry, but by the time they reached him, Harry was gone.
Maybe he wasn‚Äôt the perfect first friend Harry could ever have, but he

year Slytherin had to open his mouth, causing an uproar among the students as they were ushered away by their prefects. Two-thirds of the Silver Trio snuck out of the dungeons after curfew and went up to Gryffindor tower. They spent the night in the common room with the Twins and their darling Hermione, as they discussed the Chamber and reassured Hermione she wouldn‚Äôt become a victim of whatever attacks were to come.
That following Thursday, they finally got to have class with Mad-Eye Moody. In this class they learned the unforgivable curses, much to the dismay of most of the students. Following the class, the Silver Trio found and comforted Neville, who didn‚Äôt take the lesson well. That evening Harry received a letter from Sirius, whom he wrote several weeks ago, telling him that Sirius was returning to Britain because he worried for Harry‚Äôs safety after the Quidditch attack. Harry wrote Sirius back, claiming he was fine, and that Sirius didn‚Äôt need to return.
Every day leading up to the task, the Silver Trio researched ways for Harry to breathe underwater for more than an hour. Everyday they came up with nothing. On the night before the task, the Twins show up and said that McGonagall and Snape were looking for Hermione and Draco respectively. They left Harry alone to find out how to survive the second task. With a little help from Dobby, Harry discovered a plant that would help him breathe underwater.
Before they left for the Hogwarts Express, Lucius told the boys about the Triwizard Tournament that would be taking place that year. He also told them that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to participate, but will be able to watch with their fellow students. They were also warned not to tell anyone about what it was until it was announced to the school.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemort's wand...and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be...he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand...knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight...
"Mr. Malfoy! Ms. Granger!" Madame Pince rushed in. "What on earth are you-"

Of all things Draco had heard and felt within the past twenty-four hours, news of his godfather getting doused in the face wasn't one of them. The image was so surreal, Draco nearly laughed.
Harry hopped off the window seat and walked over to him, offering Draco his hand. "Come on."
" the redhead yelled. "You just can't help yourself, can you? Whatever excitement comes along, you just have to snatch it up like a glorified attention-seeker?"
"You may want to see an ophthalmologist about that," Sirius's lips curled into a cool smile. "Or a shrink to help you with the delirium."
Harry's blood ran cold. He gripped onto the arm rests so tightly, he felt the bones stretching out the skin of his knuckles.
"Dear god." Harry hoped she was all right. Based on what he remembered reading, Veela were able to heal fast, but it all depended how fatal the wound and how many times it was inflicted.
I know a lot of you were stunned by the last chapter. As predicted, tons of feelings came about.
"Never mind the fact that the person who caused his pain was a madman-"
"Of course, we. You honestly didn't think I'd move into a new room without you, did you?"
"You-you sure?"
"Father!"
"Got lost." he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. "Fleur and Krum're coming now!"
Harry gave him a look that silenced any and all protesting he might have tried. With a grumble, Draco complied, squeezing Harry's hand before letting it go and following Mother out.
"Draco, for Merlin's sake," Harry smacked his hand against his forehead. "We kissed a few times but that was it. No need to make a big deal out of it. Besides, didn't you say you had some fun in France?"
Severus' eyes focused on the old Daily Prophet paper on the coffee table, half-hidden under a plate of cookies and scones. His expression became feral. "And I see you've been keeping up with the
Draco sighed. "Like I said, Potter, you have nothing to apology for. They should have told me the truth," His frown deepened. "It actually explains why things have been so tense between them. Why Mother kept her distance."
Harry gave a sugar-laced smile.
. The word sent a crescendo of chills through his back. Harry was sure he would and could never get tired of hearing. He bit on his bottom lip and gave him a sheepish smile. "I love chocolate."
A pang of disappointment shot through his chest.
He thought back to the strange look in his eyes as he looked up at the sky, almost like‚Ä¶he was seeing something more. Could it be-
, Draco said with a sweep of his tongue.
She stared up at him in shock.
It was a bedroom. Judging by the broken antiques crowding the dresser and the four-poster bed with dusty, torn hanging, and the old piano that was set in the middle, it must have been a beautiful room once. On the opposite side of the bed was a blue velvet chair. Seated on the chair, clutching onto his leg, which stuck out at a strangle angle was Ron.
"You know, I really picked the most perfect day to come down for breakfast. Got decent food and a grand show." Blaise concluded, taking a sip of his juice. "And you may want to move your knife another direction unless you want Moody to change you back into a bouncing ferret."
Warmth lashed at Draco's insides like a whip.
So then what if they was wrong? What if Harry's fear was over nothing? After all, blonde hair wasn't an uncommon hair color. The paleness of his eyes could have been a trick of light. And tying the man's appearance to Lucius's lack-of was too much of a coincidence. Lucius never before that day gave Harry any reason to doubt him. If memory served right, he was quite impressed with his mum; Lily Potter had to be the only other woman besides Aunt Cissa who handled Lucius's "wit" and gave it right back. He treated Harry the same as he treated Draco, never making him feel like an outsider but as an additional member of the family.
Narcissa removed her hands from her lap, sipping her tea once more. Her eyes shifted to Draco‚Äôs and the sign of recognition hit him like a slap in the face.
Draco knew this question would be asked at some point, ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù
As Draco struggled with his thoughts, Robards placed a document and a quill on the desk, pointing to the dotted line where Draco‚Äôs name was supposed to be. His expectant glance only furthered Draco‚Äôs thoughts into a flurry.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in latin,‚Äù Draco responded, feeling his heart drop into his stomach, ‚Äú
Pansy gave him an incredulous look, ‚ÄúDraco, we‚Äôre going to a Muggle bar, you can‚Äôt wear your robes out like that!‚Äù
Anthony, already in a besotted state, stumbled over one of Draco‚Äôs lounge chairs, and gripped onto the railing to steady himself, ‚ÄúPansy sure knows how to throw ‚Äòem.‚Äù
Draco shrugged, ‚ÄúI get that a lot.‚Äù
Irma scoffed, leaning back in her chair and kicking her feet up on the table, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always like that, you‚Äôll get used to it.‚Äù
Harry reached his arm out to Side-Along him. His eyes met Draco‚Äôs and for a second, the thought of having to touch Harry ‚Äì to feel his clothed arm pressing against his own, was terrifying. The gesture and look Harry gave him made Draco‚Äôs heart pound against his chest and he prayed to whatever deity was out there that Harry wouldn‚Äôt notice.
‚ÄúIs Muggle art always this violent and outlandish?‚Äù He asked, stepping closer to examine just how incredibly detailed the portrait was. And to think that was done all by hand and not magic!
‚ÄúRight, well if you were your father, where would you go?‚Äù Potter turned to Draco, eyes bright with inquiry.
would be used to open such a well-guarded artefact. As it opened, revealing the artefact inside, suddenly everything made sense.
‚ÄúYears? So...you weren‚Äôt living at home after the war?‚Äù Harry‚Äôs eyes met his and Draco felt his stomach doing flips inside his body.
I'm back and better than ever!!! Tbh I had this chapter written out for AGES and completely forgot about it until recently when I decided to go back and edit some things :) I hope you enjoy it, I definitely enjoyed writing this chapter and I have so many ideas as to how to continue this story. Until next time! Xoxo
Draco vividly remembered the day he set off on his own. He had been sitting and stewing in his room for months, feeling as if he would tear his own skin off if he had to listen to his father preach to him and his mother about how they were going to fix their soiled reputation. It hadn‚Äôt been long after their trial, in which Harry Potter testified in favor of the Malfoys being pardoned. Lucius had seen better days. He bore dark circles under his eyes and looked paler than usual. His long and elegant platinum hair was no longer kept cleanly, instead looking brittle and frazzled. He had always admired his father, but looking at him then, he was nothing more than a madman. His mother was no better, clinging to their old ways by planning soirees and engagement parties to set Draco up with some pure-blood girl he‚Äôd never even met.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be daft, Draco.‚Äù She gave him a look to which he only shrugged his shoulders.
S√©bastien shook his head, ‚ÄúNo, but he said you might ask me that. He told me his son was following him with a group of Aurors and then disappeared. I thought he was just trying to scare me, but here you are.‚Äù
The pub they had entered was quite the establishment. By the time they arrived, it was packed full of people. The lighting was dim and dark, but the noise level was deafening, and Draco realized by the way Pansy was waving over to a few people sitting by the bar, that he recognized a few faces.
Narcissa Malfoy was a good mother, despite her shortcomings. She always wanted what was best for Draco and he was lucky to have her. Even so, she excelled at the art of guilting her child, an art only a mother could truly master. What set her apart from other mothers was her ability to make every little situation about the Malfoy name. That, above all else, trumped emotions, logic, and pretty much everything in between. If anything were to tarnish their name, she would put a stop to it immediately, even if it meant losing her only son.
A moment of silence passed and Draco could tell by the look Pansy was giving him that she was hurt by his outburst. She planned all this out for him and he didn‚Äôt seem the least bit happy about it.
Even so, being in their presence gave him a nervous feeling that even his pride couldn‚Äôt shake off. Perhaps it was the fact that his past wasn‚Äôt so completely erased that people around him would forget that the dark mark stood unabashedly against his skin. Or, even worse, perhaps it was knowing how close he was to the presence of Potter ‚Äì that even being in the same building as him was enough to put Draco on edge. The only reassurance he had was the thought that Potter was a busy man; Draco doubted he would have the time to busy himself with mundane office work when he seemed to be out in the world, killing dark wizards, or throwing them in Azkaban. The thought was equally as disturbing to him as Potter actually
he was a better person than he was back then. He looked down at the rolled-up sleeves of his cream-colored shirt to find the Dark Mark visible for the world to see. Most days he didn‚Äôt notice it, but at that moment, it was all he could see. Letting his head hang, he took a deep breath and prepared for whatever would accompany him the moment he walked out of that bathroom.
spell Blaise had cast as the Casemates was still closed to the public this early in the morning.
‚ÄúI know I shouldn‚Äôt have waited so long,‚Äù Harry finally broke the silence with a soft mutter as he stared intently at Malfoy‚Äôs wand, ‚ÄúI just wasn‚Äôt ready to see you yet.‚Äù
Robards smiled then, in such a way that caused the hairs on Draco‚Äôs neck to stand on edge, ‚ÄúEverything, Mr. Malfoy.‚Äù
Harry looked up at the same time Draco did, their eyes meeting mid-movement, ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôve always had a difference of opinion, you and I.‚Äù
Potter caught up with Draco once he entered the classical art exhibit, ‚ÄúDid you find anything?‚Äù
Harry stood in front of him, wearing a grey cotton button-down and jeans - nothing particularly special, but seeing him out of Auror robes, standing in the doorway of his bedroom was off-putting, to say the least. Draco could feel his mouth go dry and his palms begin to sweat when he realized Harry meant to enter the room- an unlikely situation that Draco never imagined to happen outside of his dreams.
there.
Time-Turners were tricky and required extra careful use lest he got caught in the past or a continuous time loop. He couldn‚Äôt really use it per se without time-traveling and so he instead focused on the design of it, noting every detail about the Time-Turner itself to make sense of how Lucius might have broken it. But the unfortunate reality was that he wouldn‚Äôt really be able to understand the nature of the Time-Turner or the curse placed upon it until it was in his hands. He tried not to focus on that fact as he twirled the artefact between his fingers.
Blaise smirked, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you meeting your mother at the Manor today?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Draco‚Äôs eyebrows furrowed together in confusion.
Weasley interrupted, ‚ÄúNow isn‚Äôt really the best time, Harry.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow can you be sure?‚Äù Potter asked, raising his brows at the latter.
His body filled with dread and the hair on the back of his neck stood on edge.
He wasn‚Äôt entirely sure how he wanted to go about it. He imagined in his head that there would be some screaming and crying involved, but his mother was too sensible for that. She wasn‚Äôt like Draco - constantly struggling to deal with his emotions - no, she was more level-minded than anyone. Her strength was incredible, he only wished he could have inherited some of it rather than cowering in fear over his troubled past.
The group shrugged until Draco spoke up, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this Spanish tapas place that I like in Chelsea. They‚Äôve got some great food and drinks.‚Äù
Pansy shook her head, giving him a mournful glance, ‚ÄúSorry Draco, but you did.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou, I know you.‚Äù The man pointed his finger within an inch of Draco‚Äôs face, ‚ÄúYou have your father‚Äôs face. He said you‚Äôd come.‚Äù
A pause ensued. He was relieved it was Blaise. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt make him feel much better about the current situation he was in.
The Auror‚Äôs thin-lipped smile did not budge, ‚ÄúI understand. It‚Äôs a bigger project than you were expecting, I‚Äôm sure. How about you come in on Monday to tell me your decision. Is that enough time for you?‚Äù
The thought echoed through his mind.
Draco started by clearing his throat, ‚ÄúFirst, I wanted to tell you that I‚Äôve accepted a job with the Ministry.‚Äù
To their surprise, the latin words appeared instantly, with the same shimmery ink they had seen in Rotterdam.
His eyes widened, and his heart stopped. If he wasn‚Äôt so pissed drunk, he would‚Äôve run out the second he could, but the poor, drunken man was paralyzed by what he‚Äôd seen. For that was the exact moment when it happened. That was the first time he had seen Harry Potter in years, and he was staring right into Draco‚Äôs eyes from the other side of the bar.
Draco felt sick to his stomach. He couldn‚Äôt bear to listen to anymore. He got up to leave when he heard Potter speak.
‚ÄúYes, and new cities are built on top of old ones. We‚Äôre looking in the wrong place.‚Äù Draco‚Äôs eyes scanned over to the P√©trusse Casemates, remembering that time he had read about the famed catacombs underneath Luxembourg City.
After a long while of sipping tea in silence, Draco stood, dusting himself off, ‚ÄúThank you for the tea, mother. It‚Äôs been delightful as always.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt looks...nice,‚Äù Harry muttered, staring intently at the Slytherin blanket.
‚ÄúDraco?‚Äù
‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he muttered, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.
Narcissa dropped her tea loudly onto the wooden table.
Thank you for your lovely messages, I'm pleased to see this story is still getting a bit of traction! Until next time xoxo
She didn‚Äôt answer, instead giving him a devilish grin.
Story of his life, it seemed. From the sounds of it, he hardly saw anyone anymore ‚Äì not that that notion was necessarily incorrect. Draco made polite conversation with his former classmate for a while before Pansy loudly announced she was buying everyone a round of drinks. Draco would have laughed at the display if he wasn‚Äôt already feeling so damn awkward at the fact that he barely knew or talked to some of these people.
Several days had passed since their last lead and Draco was becoming restless, awaiting news regarding his father‚Äôs whereabouts. That particular early Friday morning at around 4 AM, Draco‚Äôs peace was disturbed when he received a guest via Floo.
‚ÄúWho else have you appointed?‚Äù
‚ÄúSo I suppose we‚Äôll all be getting to know one another fairly well over the next few weeks, or months depending on how quickly we close the case.‚Äù Draco sat, feeling his palms begin to sweat.
Anthony turned to Draco, with a playful grin on his lips, ‚ÄúYou Slytherin lot are crazier than I thought.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to, I can manage the walk alone,‚Äù Blaise paid the bill this time around, exiting the establishment with Draco following close behind him.
When Draco woke up the next morning, it wasn‚Äôt to the sound of chirping birds outside his window, or to Mittens purring at his bedside. When Draco had woken up the next morning, it was to the sound of the Floo in the living room.
Harry's eyes shifted behind him, ‚ÄúIs this your room?‚Äù
He sat at the head of the table, dropping a stack of files onto the surface loudly ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs here? Good. Let‚Äôs get started.‚Äù
‚ÄúLook at them,‚Äù Draco shook his head, chuckling at the display, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like a wild pack of animals.‚Äù
Draco stopped as he reached the door, noticing the powerful protection charms over it. Blaise was right, if this was the Curse-Breaker working with his father, he knew it was a possibility that his father was inside. He took a deep breath, feeling his heart pound against his ribcage before knocking against the wood.
The group roared with laughter ‚Äì even Draco couldn‚Äôt help the thundering laughter that crawled out of him. Millicent, despite looking mildly offended, giggled at the memory.
He hated how frequently it happened, seemingly for no reason at all. He blamed it on the stressful day, but even that wasn‚Äôt an excuse for his behavior. Now the whole lot of them probably thought him a freak, or worse than whatever it was they already thought of him. Turning the faucet on, he splashed his face with cold water, hoping it would calm him. He couldn't stop hyperventilating, despite knowing he wasn‚Äôt in any imminent danger.
‚ÄúShh!‚Äù Draco hissed at him, noticing how quiet their footsteps were as they entered the cavern - as if they were the only ones there.
"Draco‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so good to see you again.‚Äù She smiled at him softly, and he was slightly dumbstruck until he snapped out of it and pulled her in for a quick hug.
He turned his head once more to watch as the last boat floated by before rejoining the group.
‚ÄúMr. Malfoy, is that you? Please come in.‚Äù Robards' voice rose above the idle chatter in Draco‚Äôs mind, beckoning him to enter.
Draco had just about had it listening to the same rubbish over and over again. He couldn‚Äôt care less about getting married, all he wanted was to stop feeling so empty all the damn time.
, a thought went through his head,
a walking embarrassment.‚Äù
It was amazing to Draco that Harry had been living among muggles for years now, and the papers had yet to pinpoint the superstar‚Äôs home. Draco had always imagined he would be living in some posh manor in the countryside, or some trendy loft in London. He hardly imagined Harry living in his own ancestral home. Although, he supposed it made sense, given his close connection to Sirius. Draco hadn‚Äôt ever spoken to the man before his untimely demise.
Draco couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he stood so close to Potter. Thinking back, Draco remembered his arms gripping around Potter‚Äôs waist as they rode on his broom, away from the Fiendfyre threatening to kill them all. He can still remember the smell of ash all around him if he closed his eyes.
The man‚Äôs boisterous laughter interrupted him.
Draco knew exactly what happened, as did they all, but he said nothing. Forcing himself to be more social, he smiled uneasily at the man before deciding one drink with some old friends couldn‚Äôt hurt.
Draco thought to himself before making a timely escape down the stairs and onto the dimly lit street.
‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Draco replied, surprised to find him not in his work clothes for once.
She felt warm and soft, just as he remembered, although he did notice she was wearing a new perfume that smelled overwhelmingly like lavender, ‚ÄúPans‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt write sooner.‚Äù
Harry didn‚Äôt have a response to that. He just looked stunned, as if Draco just slapped him in the face. When Draco realized Harry wasn‚Äôt going to say anything more, he turned the knob and walked out.
‚ÄúShut it you two.‚Äù Harry retorted, though there was no venom in his voice.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way to keep our name in the good graces of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.‚Äù Narcissa said that afternoon over biscuits and tea.
Pansy placed a hand on her hip and sighed in annoyance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve forgotten.
He barely went to Diagon Alley as it was, but there were days when he could not deny that he needed to shop for supplies. Even so, the days he did go, he stuck to the shadows, lurking away from anyone who had the possibility of recognizing him. The whole thing was a bit childish, he could admit. Regardless, he didn‚Äôt want to risk getting jumped by self-righteous Potter fanatics who probably never even
A moment paused before a loud knock on the door of Draco‚Äôs office brought his attention back to the present. When he exited the Dark Room, he found Robards standing there, looking quite serious.
After having showered, he Floo‚Äôd right over to her flat to find that she was dreadfully underprepared for his visit.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the midst of twilight, when the silver crest of the moon is just barely visible, the clouds disperse and tiny, bright stars dance to the silent night. That is when Draco is most at peace. He found solace then - clinging to the inevitability of the darkness washing over him like a wave of shadows, covering the land that was once illuminated by the sun and now enveloped by the dusk. When all else failed, he could always look forward to this. People may disappoint him, life may disappoint him, but the moon was constant, forever reminding him that the day was done and another would soon begin. One hopefully better than the last.
It seemed that the Curse-Breaker lived beneath the catacombs, from the bed and bookshelves littered behind him. Yet, it didn‚Äôt explain why he‚Äôd go through such trouble to hide himself underneath a well covered by rocks. Perhaps he really didn‚Äôt want the Muggles finding him, or he had reason to hide.
here, Malfoy?‚Äù
He felt a hand slap his back in merriment, to his right, he saw it was Blaise who winked at the shorter blonde wizard, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for you both, really.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you, Harry.‚Äù The name sounded foreign on his lips but it felt right to say.
Silence followed. The words echoed into the parlour, reverberating from the wooden walls. Everything was still for a moment with the only sound being the two of them breathing heavily, mixing their air together in the room. The wood breathed too, creaking as it did so. In and out. In and out.
‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt.‚Äù Draco stared at him, speaking softly.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her, ‚ÄúWhat are you prattling on about?‚Äù
‚ÄúSo he wanted you to fix the Time-Turner?‚Äù Draco asked, despite Blaise opening his mouth to speak.
He pointed to the red headed girl behind him, who was now conversing with her brother, ‚ÄúGinny likes Muggle pubs. She forces us to go to a new one every week.‚Äù
Back with more content! Don't you love drunken team interactions? They're truly my favorite :)
Draco ignored his comment. Yes, he was angry, but not for the reasons that Blaise suspected. Mostly, he was angry that Blaise thought it was alright to Floo himself over to Draco‚Äôs flat at 4 in the morning, scaring the living daylights out of him.
Before Draco had the chance to say anything in response, Anthony closed the distance between them and planted a firm kiss on his lips. It was a warm, pleasant feeling, and yet Draco could not find the ability to allow himself to relax into it. His body remained stiff and cold, his lips unmoving and unresponsive as Anthony pressed his lips unto his.
‚ÄúNow for the fun part,‚Äù Robards smiled back at him before leading him through the hallway that Draco entered from, ‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he swallowed, hesitating before he spoke, ‚Äúbut I thought all of the Ministry‚Äôs Time-Turners were lost.‚Äù
Pansy smirked at him, ‚ÄúAnd how is your Auror training going?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve changed quite a bit, Malfoy.‚Äù Harry‚Äôs voice caused him to turn his head back around.
His face crumpled in desperation ‚Äì it was clear Weasley wanted nothing more than to return to the safety of the Ministry.
Potter looked surprised, almost as if he didn‚Äôt expect him to accept. Perhaps it was better that Draco went home and cuddled with Mittens until the memory of today wiped away with sleep. Although, even the thought of being alone made Draco feel worried about the direction in which his thoughts would go. Besides, he‚Äôd already accepted and there was no backing out now.
Draco, we thought you‚Äôd never figure it out. With all that stalking Potter, vying for his attention- ‚Äú
Ginny nodded, ‚ÄúI agree. You always seemed too uptight for all that,‚Äù
Draco‚Äôs eyes widened, feeling like a kid in a candy shop, ‚ÄúThis collection is incredible.‚Äù
He felt Harry‚Äôs arm slide against his and a moment later they were standing in front of Harry‚Äôs home. Draco‚Äôs head pounded from the Apparation, but not enough to distract him from the burning feeling of Harry‚Äôs arm still gripping his. His grip tightened until they reached their destination and the look on Harry‚Äôs face made Draco come to the conclusion that he didn‚Äôt like Apparating much either. Their closeness became apparent to the both of them fairly soon after they arrived, as they both pulled apart immediately after. Draco, straightening his coat jacket, began to recognize the outside of his home.
Harry, ignoring her for a moment said, ‚ÄúMalfoy, I really don‚Äôt think you should-‚Äú
been years, after all. He looked more mature, and from what he‚Äôd heard, his Auror job had been doing well to keep him in shape. His hair was just as messy as it‚Äôd always been, and a bit longer too. That much hadn‚Äôt changed. His clothes looked expensive, which was odd to Draco ‚Äì he doubted Harry even bought them himself, anyways. Still, he couldn‚Äôt deny that they flattered him greatly. All in all, he looked‚Ä¶like Harry. The thought caused a lump to form in the back of his throat.
‚Äú-and I tell you, I‚Äôd never seen Blaise run so fast in my life.‚Äù Justin could barely get the sentence out without howling with laughter.
Potter was just outside the door.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about marriage,‚Äù Draco muttered, feeling his hands begin to shake from under the table.
Blaise, who was now sporting a dark red flush on his face, either from the alcohol or the embarrassing story, couldn‚Äôt keep a grin off his face, while the others laughed heartily at the tale.
Harry shook his head, ‚ÄúI doubt Robards would say anything to him this early. Once he accepts, however, he won‚Äôt have much of a choice but to help us find him.‚Äù
Draco‚Äôs ears perked up, as he stared at the dark-haired man in disbelief, ‚ÄúFor what reason?‚Äù
Draco blinked, stunned at her reaction, ‚ÄúWait, don‚Äôt tell me you knew. This whole time...you knew?‚Äù
Pansy sat across from him, staring unrelentingly with a snarky smile on her face, ‚ÄúSo, Mittens, huh?‚Äù
Eventually, he was able to reply without a tremor, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very grateful for this opportunity, Mr. Robards‚Ä¶but I think I may need some time to think about it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you two prattling on about? Something interesting, I hope,‚Äù Blaise raised an eyebrow at them, while aiming a mischievous smirk at Draco.
At that, Pansy blushed a bit, ‚ÄúOh, it was no big deal. We‚Äôre adults, who says we can‚Äôt have some fun?‚Äù
‚ÄúAttention everyone,‚Äù Robards cleared his throat before making his announcement. Several Aurors entered the room, leaving their offices as Robards spoke, doing nothing to level the anxiety in Draco‚Äôs mind, ‚ÄúI would like to introduce our new recruit, Draco Malfoy, who will be working on the case with us. Given his exemplary academic record and previous work with the Ministry, Draco will be acting as Lead Investigator and Keeper of Dark Artefacts. I expect each one of you to welcome Draco into this department with open arms and an open mind. If I catch word of any of you speaking ill of Mr. Malfoy during his time with us, you will be taken off of the case. That is all.‚Äù
Several hours had passed since their assignment in Rotterdam and the team had already apparated back home. They reported their findings to Robards, who didn‚Äôt seem to care much for what they found, sorely disappointed they hadn‚Äôt caught him. The witness couldn‚Äôt tell Blaise much aside from what they‚Äôd already been told by Robards and they found no trace that he was even there, save the hint they found at the art museum. Draco knew his father was toying with him. He knew Lucius was five steps ahead of them and was aware that his son has been working with the aurors. How he knew, Draco had no idea, but he was determined to find out.
Robards gave a short, half-suppressed laugh at Draco‚Äôs fascination, ‚ÄúInterested, are you? That is the Candle of Reflection. It mimics whoever stares into the flame‚Äôs emotions. Some reports say it gives insight into the future, but...well, most who‚Äôve come into contact with it burn to death instantly, so it‚Äôs unconfirmed.‚Äù
Draco couldn‚Äôt help but roll his eyes at him now, ‚ÄúYou know I live in Muggle London, right?‚Äù
Anthony spoke up, slightly slurring but not nearly as bad as Draco was, ‚ÄúI could take him home.‚Äù
He fought that anger every time he saw Potter. He felt it knotting his insides, twisting and churning painfully, but he refused to give it life. As much as he wanted to yell and scream at the man standing in front of him, the anger died inside of him before it could begin to fester. Instead, he felt something cutting deeper, threatening to eat him alive ‚Äì utter fucking misery.
‚ÄúNice robes,‚Äù Draco commented, briefly looking at his new colleague before turning his attention back to the Time-Turner.
Harry raised his hand to the sky to ask a question. The familiarity of it made Draco feel like he was back at Hogwarts, which was both a welcoming feeling and a disturbing one.
Harry looked back at him and smiled before walking out of the door, leaving Draco standing there, too afraid to move. He turned to his right to find his reflection staring back at him. Even his reflection couldn‚Äôt hide the fact that‚Äôs become so abundantly clear to him - the look on his face said it all. He‚Äôd tried to repress it. He‚Äôd tried to ignore it and stuff it down with everything else he tried to avoid his entire adolescence, but even then he couldn‚Äôt ignore the signs the universe threw at him. It was always Harry. It will always be Harry. That much would never change.
change, there was no doubt about that, but it wasn‚Äôt a bad different. She looked beautiful, mature- not at all like the young girl he had once taken to the Yule Ball.
Draco raised his eyebrows, somewhat impressed and somewhat terrified, ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs that next to it?‚Äù
Mortal actions never deceive the gods.
The Curse-Breaker looked expectantly between the two of them, ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù
Draco shook his head, ‚ÄúNothing really, he just told me the bare minimum until I sign the contract. Although he did, essentially, give me free reign over the department if I decide to take the job.‚Äù
Draco was stunned, feeling all eyes on him as soon as it was mentioned, ‚ÄúWell, yes, but it was-‚Äù
"Malfoy,‚Äú Harry started, much to Draco‚Äôs annoyance.
Draco nearly commended him for his logic. They were desperate, that much Draco knew from his chat with Robards. Although, it worried him to know just how desperate they really were.
Ron looked like he might fall over from the way he was trying to hold back laughter, while Granger looked like she desperately wanted to get Weasley home.
It had been three days since he received the Head Auror‚Äôs offer of employment, though his thoughts remained in shambles. When Pansy surprised him with an unannounced visit that Saturday evening, he felt obliged to take her someplace nice to discuss the big news, mostly because she insisted after gossiping about it with Blaise. Instead, they found themselves at a Muggle pub down the road from Draco‚Äôs flat. It certainly wasn‚Äôt anything magnificent, but it was less crowded than the clubs and bars Pansy had suggested, which was good enough for him.
Draco laughed at his friends, seeing Pansy grind up on Blaise and Theodore all at once. Justin and Millicent seemed to be having a good time as well, as did the rest of the group. Even Ron‚Äôs goofy face as he danced with Granger almost made Draco want to smile. They all seemed so happy now. Not at all like the hollowed out, empty faces he had seen years ago.
Draco rolled his eyes at the Auror, taking a seat on the park bench where they decided to regroup, ‚ÄúHow very observant, Potter.‚Äù
Potter, ignoring Draco‚Äôs side comment, spoke up for the first time, surprising Draco enough to render him speechless, ‚ÄúAre you going to stay long?‚Äù
‚ÄúI...yes.‚Äù Draco nodded, shaking off the foreboding feeling sinking deeply into his mind.
Reluctantly, he opened the stall door. Draco tried not to hang his head or give any tell-tale signs that he was ashamed, but it was difficult doing so when Potter looked at him so intensely.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remind me.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe night is young, Zabini, it might not be the last time you‚Äôre in there,‚Äù Pansy shouted before flinging the door open and throwing herself into the much taller man‚Äôs arms.
‚ÄúOh thank
‚ÄúIt can be hard, putting on a smile when you feel nothing at all.‚Äù Draco turned to find Harry looking off in the distance, smiling sadly to himself, ‚ÄúMost days I don‚Äôt even bother. Being around people helps, it takes you away from yourself for a moment, away from your own head.‚Äù
to light the way. Behind him, he could hear Blaise and Harry landing on the rocky ground and following his lead.
The words rang through his ears, eerily reminding him of his conversation with his mother. They both bore the same surprisingly affectionate glance and frankly, it worried him. Whatever was to happen, Draco decided, would surely be the end of him.
Draco snickered at that, ‚ÄúShe certainly does.‚Äù
After recognizing that the people Blaise was talking to was none other than Harry‚Äôs Gryffindor crew, including the red-haired Weasley girl who he was most likely married or engaged to by now, Longbottom, and a couple of others Draco was too pissed drunk to recognize, he quickly excused himself to the bathroom. Luckily, everyone around him was too far gone to notice, but he still tried to be as discreet as possible, which is how he ended up having a mini meltdown in the bathroom.
Draco cocked his head at the old man, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve seen it then? Do you know what‚Äôs wrong with it?‚Äù
he cringed internally.
‚ÄúCome on, you‚Äôre missing the party! We‚Äôve brought out the firewhiskey,‚Äù Pansy clapped her hands excitedly as she scurried off towards the kitchen where a handful of others were already drinking heavily.
Draco knew this day would come, but he feared it regardless. His face grew pale and his hands became cold and clammy, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a warning. He knows I‚Äôm here looking for him.‚Äù
Draco wanted to believe that to be true, but a part of him seriously doubted that. Harry was a far better person than he was, time had shown that. Still, the sentiment was nice. Clearly, he didn‚Äôt think him to be an arrogant arse anymore, or if he did, he kept it to himself.
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶sure.‚Äù He responded, not really thinking it through before entering the establishment.
‚ÄúAre you alright, Draco?‚Äù
get worse.
‚ÄúSorry for the delay,‚Äù the man cleared his throat, eventually taking a seat. For a second, Draco didn‚Äôt recognize him, but eventually his eyes readjusted, and he realized the middle-aged man sitting in front of him was none other than Gawain Robards, the Head of the Auror department.
Draco agreed, ‚ÄúIndeed, it has.‚Äù
Draco could hear his heart beating in his chest, his breath became uneven as they scoured through the casemates. At times, they would pass by a cliff with cannon loopholes, reminding Draco of the rich history this place once had. He could feel it seeping out of every crack and crevice inside the rocky cavern.
Across the way, they could see a single flame of a candle, sitting at the floor of a heavy, wooden and iron-wrought door.
Draco grimaced, putting some distance between the Auror and himself, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what the fuss is about, it‚Äôs just a job.‚Äù
It then became apparent to Draco that he had a decision to make. Either he refused and made a complete knobhead of himself, while maintaining his dignity, or he simply agreed and regretted it later. The thought of seeing Harry‚Äôs home was intimidating, to say the least. He had imagined perhaps a million times what the inside of it looked like ‚Äì the d√©cor, the architecture, all of it. He imagined a grand drawing room, where Harry entertained his loved ones. He imagined a garden with a beautiful greenhouse, and seating for when Harry had his morning tea. Worse, perhaps, was that he imagined a room full of Harry‚Äôs accomplishments - an in-house museum filled with dark artefacts he‚Äôs collected over the years. He certainly wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. Granted, in Draco‚Äôs profession, he definitely had somewhat of an impressive collection himself. Regardless, Draco never imagined himself standing inside of that very house, and yet, somehow, it was destined to happen.
‚ÄúWe should get back to the others,‚Äù Harry walked over to the bathroom door.
‚ÄúAre you two quite done?‚Äù Pansy called out, obnoxiously.
Narcissa finally put down the letter to look at him, hard and unwavering. This look would have intimidated a younger Draco, but he was a man now. He was tired of living up to impossible expectations.
Draco sighed, ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs just...I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù
Irma nodded, springing enthusiastically when called upon, ‚ÄúYes, I inquired to one of my contacts in Azkaban, a former Death-Eater that worked closely with the target, about the Time-Turner. He said it was designed to be untraceable and does not have a limit to when you can stay in the past, nor how far in the past you can go. It is likely that if we find the target, he will have hidden it somewhere near impossible to find.‚Äù
Blaise and Harry talked quietly enough so that he couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying, until eventually Draco‚Äôs vision started to spot and the next thing he knew, he was leaning against a warm and firm body until that body disappeared and he recalled the familiar feeling of his silk sheets rubbing against his face. He buried himself into his pillows and within moments he had given into unconsciousness. He could‚Äôve sworn though, as he faded into a deep sleep, he heard a voice speak softly into the abyss.
There she stood, in a bra and a skirt, looking mortified that Draco had suddenly appeared in her bedroom.
Harry paid no mind and returned to his side, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to apologize. I think if it were me, you‚Äôd do the same.‚Äù
Harry turned to the man, ‚ÄúUmm, Malfoy. Are you going to be able to get home alright?‚Äù
She looked shocked, but kept her mouth shut. The rest of the group just sat there, not saying a word.
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt have any information to give you. My family was pardoned, so I don‚Äôt-‚Äú Draco stammered, although he tried desperately to keep his tone even, despite the fear that coiled deep in his spine.
‚ÄúPretty boy?‚Äù Draco repeated, eyes widened.
‚ÄúIt could‚Äôve gone far worse, Draco. Everyone gets drunk.‚Äù She looked at him with a softer look this time.
‚ÄúAre you coming in?‚Äù A muggle, likely someone who worked there, approached him and questioned him with a single raised brow.
‚ÄúPoint taken.‚Äù Harry muttered under his breath, noticing Draco‚Äôs crabby mood seemed to be less about the question and more about the reason they were there.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with what I‚Äôm wearing?‚Äù
‚ÄúMr Potter?‚Äù
Draco glared at his drink in front of him, though he felt no anger. Instead, all he felt was sadness and shame. How could Potter say he was no different, when he‚Äôd barely given the man a chance to explain himself?
"Now there is a bit of paperwork to be done, since you will be assisting my colleagues on the case, but since you‚Äôve worked with the Ministry before, I‚Äôm sure it will be no problem for you. I‚Äôll assign a small team to work under you, when the need arises in which your skills could be of use. Also, I‚Äôll notify the other departments in case you need any aid from them as well. I may need you working out on the field alongside with the other Aurors, however, I don‚Äôt expect you to follow the same training protocols. While I can‚Äôt tell you the details of the case until after you‚Äôve signed the contract, I must warn you that it may be dangerous. Do you have any questions?‚Äù
‚ÄúDraco?‚Äù Blaise placed a hand upon his shoulder. Quickly, Draco turned around to realize that Potter and the rest of the crew were waiting on him to give the orders, ‚ÄúAre you feeling alright?‚Äù
Potter popped his head out into the hallway, raising an eyebrow in confusion as Draco tenderly grazed an old, dusted picture of Sirius and Regulus with his index. Walburga placed her hands on the shoulder of her children ‚Äì the grimace in her face firmly staying in place, though her eyes wandered to her youngest with a sad expression. He was eighteen when he died, or so Draco was told as a boy. The Black brothers were once the pride and joy of this house, now both were gone. The house mourned their presence, and Draco could feel it. He felt it in the air ‚Äì the way the wood inhaled and exhaled in sorrow.
He knew Blaise was right; Not going would be foolish, despite knowing that it would likely be a fruitless endeavor. Regardless, if there was a reason his father decided to go to Luxembourg, he knew it had to be in search of a Curse-Breaker.
It was nearing September and the weather had started to become chilly again. Draco could feel it in his bones when he came to the countryside. It served as a reminder of much colder days than this at the Manor. He remembered the deep chill rattling his bones when the Dark Lord was near and the Death Eaters invaded his home. Every room of the house was filled with the stench of death, save his own room and his mother‚Äôs parlor. He remembered the deep ache from his mark and the chills running down his spine when they called upon him. Sometimes, when he was alone he would feel a phantom pain over it, markedly amplifying the panic and anxiety he had developed over the years as a result of his imprudent choices. The Dark Lord was gone, he knew this for a fact, and yet when he stared at the mark, he wondered what would happen if he pressed his wand into it. Would he still feel pain?
Draco held his breath, feeling the waves of emotion crashing through him.
Harry picked up the portrait in Draco‚Äôs hand, wiping the excess dust off with the sleeve of his overcoat. Wiping the frame, Harry smiled dimly. The sadness was there, it was undeniable in his eyes.
Harry smirked at him, ‚ÄúYou look more like a grown tosser to me.‚Äù
Draco wanted to gouge his eyes out. Of course that‚Äôs what she was concerned about.
‚ÄúSouth America was definitely a favorite of mine, although I couldn‚Äôt stay long. Oh! And I made a stop in Canada as well, it was quite something‚Ä¶‚Äù
Nonetheless, Draco plastered on a professional smile and nodded, ‚ÄúAbsolutely, I‚Äôll be here.‚Äù
‚ÄúFind a way or make one,‚Äù Draco muttered under his breath as he climbed inside the well, ‚Äúhow typical.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou speak Latin?‚Äù Harry asked, confused.
He looked down, now feeling a bit sheepish, ‚ÄúWell you didn‚Äôt exactly tell me where we were going.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù Draco fell back into his bed, hoping that the smooshed pillow over his face would end his suffering and suffocate him.
And with that, Pansy grabbed a handful of Draco‚Äôs platinum hair and forcefully pulled his head to hers and they met in a wet, obnoxious, and obscene kiss. She was stronger than she looked, as she led him through the motions of it. Had he not been completely, utterly, and hopelessly gay, he daresay he would have enjoyed it. Instead, when they finally pulled away for a breath, Draco had to fight not to gag, causing all the Slytherins to laugh, while everyone else stared at them in disbelief.
Narcissa stood as well, nearly knocking the tea tray to the ground to try to calm him, ‚ÄúDraco, please understand. Your father is unwell. I tried to talk him out of it, but he left before I was given the chance. After you left, he became distant. He talked in his sleep often, sometimes he wouldn‚Äôt sleep at all. He spent days, weeks even, trying to fix the Time-Turner to bring you home.‚Äù
Taking a deep breath and tightening his grip on his wand, he grasped the door handle very carefully before swinging it open and pointing his wand in the face of none other than Pansy Parkinson.
‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶suppose not.‚Äù
It's finally here! This is probably one of my favorite chapters I've ever written because of how utterly humiliating and hilarious it is. There needs to be more drunk Draco making a fool of himself in fics, in my opinion lol
‚ÄúLucius has been spotted.‚Äù Blaise explained, causing Draco‚Äôs demeanor to change instantaneously, ‚ÄúPotter just spoke to Robards, he wants us in Luxembourg immediately.‚Äù
To his right, he could hear Blaise giggling to himself through the tunnels until they eventually found sunlight once more. Even after, Draco could hear Blaise mutter the word under his breath every so often before dissolving into a fit of laughter. Already, Draco dreaded coming along.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. You‚Äôll do anything for the ones you love. Unspeakable things, if you must.‚Äù
As he struggled to walk in a straight line out of the bathroom, he was surprised to find that Potter and his entourage had disappeared from where they originally were and instead merged with his group. Draco‚Äôs stomach churned, and he decided it was half from the alcohol sloshing around in his stomach, and half from the anxiety of having to face all those people.
‚ÄúI thought you couldn‚Äôt make it. Had a sudden change of heart?‚Äù Pansy asked.
Anthony must have noticed his change of mood when he placed his arm around Draco‚Äôs shoulder. This wouldn‚Äôt have been unusual if it was one of his Slytherin friends, but this was the first time he had actually talked to this man. The touch made him shiver, but he hid it well, or as well as his drunken self could. Perhaps, Draco thought, he wasn‚Äôt the only one feeling a bit drunk, ‚ÄúYou alright, Malfoy?‚Äù
‚ÄúNonsense,‚Äù he shook his head, motioning his left hand to the chair that sat across from his desk, ‚Äúplease sit, we‚Äôll be done in just a moment.‚Äù
Weasley spoke up next, ‚ÄúDo you think he knows yet? About his father?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need any information, Mr. Malfoy. None that you could give me that I don‚Äôt already know. I brought you here to hire you on for a case.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell good,‚Äù Draco replied smugly, leaving Pansy on the dance floor with Anthony, as he sauntered over to the table.
It didn‚Äôt seem to work, which confirmed Draco‚Äôs suspicions that the well itself was not magical in any way. Yet, if that were the case, then why keep it sealed with rocks and debris?
‚ÄúWe have reason to believe another Time-Turner exists, a true Time-Turner, without the regulated Hour-Reversal Charm placed onto it.‚Äù Robards gave Draco a careful look, almost as if to examine his reactions very closely, ‚ÄúIt is in your father's possession.‚Äù
Weasley had a disbelieving expression on his face, but nonetheless allowed his friend to speak with Draco. After witnessing that strange exchange, he gave Draco a cold side-glance and walked into the Ministry building.
Theodore, who seemed to have gained a bit of courage from the alcohol grabbed her by her waist to put her fully into his lap, ‚ÄúWell that depends, Pans. What‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù
‚ÄúLuxembourg now, is it?‚Äù Draco muttered, feeling his tone grow increasingly bitter, ‚ÄúWill my father take us on a trip through all of Europe then? To do what exactly? More sight-seeing?‚Äù
‚ÄúSay, Malfoy,‚Äù Irma interrupted him, ‚Äúweren‚Äôt you a Death Eater as well?‚Äù
‚ÄúI am,‚Äù Draco hesitated, ‚Äúalthough, I don‚Äôt understand what the Head of the Auror department would want with me.‚Äù
Draco complied, shutting the door, and taking the seat opposite of her. The furnace burnt hot and the flickering flame illuminated his mother‚Äôs silhouette. He looked to his right to see his tea was already poured for him on the side table.
‚ÄúI will either find a way or make one.‚Äù Draco muttered under his breath.
Lunch was pleasant, albeit brief. Blaise had dozens of reports, or so he claimed, that he hadn‚Äôt submitted yet, while his partner remained in his office. Although they spent a precious few minutes bantering while heartily eating their meal, Blaise ultimately had to get back to work. Draco couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit disappointed; he had begun to enjoy the company. Nonetheless, Draco offered to walk him back to his office, to which his companion agreed.
Draco shrugged, feeling utterly drained by the events of the day. He regretted accepting Potter‚Äôs invitation at all. He should have known better than to force himself to be social when being social was the last thing he wanted to do.
Potter stammered, ‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know, bloody anything.‚Äù
‚ÄúNow then,‚Äù Robards exhaled sharply, using his wand to bring an enclosed case towards the examination table near Draco‚Äôs office door, ‚Äúperhaps you can enlighten me on this particular artefact.‚Äù
Harry paused where he stood, eyes widening, ‚ÄúOh...I see.‚Äù
some sad, ironic joke.
Standing outside, however, he realized quickly that as rain poured down onto his face and coat that he was not home at all, but instead at the Manor. The irony was enough to make Draco want to cry ‚Äì of course his old wand took him to the one place he could never call home again, the place that was his home when he still wielded it.
Dropping to his feet, he was surprised to find yet another entryway leading to something that looked like a dungeon of some sorts. He walked towards the darkening tunnels, using
As Draco stood up to leave, Robards halted as he said, ‚ÄúI have to say, you‚Äôre not at all what I expected.‚Äù
Walking back to his flat, he enjoyed the pleasant summer weather, and even smiled at his neighbors who passed him, walking their dogs, or going for a jog. He had been in such a good mood, he almost started humming. That is, of course, until he reached his door to find a letter stuck underneath.
Her eyes shifted over to him, narrowing a bit, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in Brussels. He sends his regards.‚Äù
His vision had begun to get blurry as they filled with tears. He‚Äôd never seen such vibrant, green eyes before. Draco thought he could get lost in them, forever basking in that endless pool of emerald.
Draco scowled at him as they walked to the opposite end of the Auror Department where their meeting was being held, ‚ÄúShut it.‚Äù
He forced Hermione to show Severus her teeth. She was doing her best to hide them with her hands, through that proved to quite a challenge as they now grew past her collar. Behind him, Harry heard Pansy and her friends bursting into laughter. He could picture her leaning against Daphne or holding onto Theo for support to keep from falling over.
The words flew over Narcissa's head.
A loud, terrifying growl ripped through the air, one that shook the ground like a vicious earthquake, slashing cracks onto the walls and benches, one that caused Draco's heart to skid a few beats, one that caused hairs on the back of necks and arms to rise straight up. A terrifying sound that belonged to a terrifying creature. A gigantic, thick claw that was size of Diggory's dragon emerged from the shadows, the pitch-black blending in with the darkness, followed another, then another, and another. Until the dragon finally stepped into the light, the size of all three dragons combined times ten, so tall she nearly towered over the third row.
~...~
"Did not." Sure, he sometimes ate as much as his hands could grab. There were even a few times he polished off three rows of cookies after Aunt Lily took them out of the oven. Times even where he finished off a whole plate. But he did have self-control, one that was better managed compared to Uncle James.
"Be quiet!" Hermione ordered. "All of you."
Harry discovered Scuffy's special talent after that Christmas. He stared at the dog, wondering what was going through Sirius' head when he got him the gift. Somehow the word, speak, spilled from his lips, and the next thing he knew he was hearing Sirius' voice. At first Harry was sure that he was losing it, until he looked over Scuffy who repeated the message.
His aunt smiled and kissed his forehead.
"That‚Ä¶we-
He cut her off. "Ron should've known better. He should have trusted me not to do something like that. Believed me when I said I didn't put my name in the stupid cup. Instead he let his jealousy get the better of him and said some really stupid things-
"Yes, sir."
"Barely!"
Moans fluttered from Harry's throat, body arched, as his cock grew heavier in Draco's hand. "Can't‚Ä¶ Draco‚Ä¶ Can't‚Ä¶ oh, god‚Ä¶ Draco, please‚Ä¶too much‚Ä¶ fuck!"
"Hi Aunt Lily."
Harry was still with the two Gryffindors, talking among themselves. There was nothing unusual about the sight, but it caused sharp needles to prick into his heart and stomach, especially as he saw how they smiled at Harry, like he was already one of them, and how Harry returned the smile with the same warmth.
For a split second, a ripple of cold, crippling fear shot through her body, twisting the muscles in her stomach into a tangled knot.
Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too and then he raised it, pointing it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied. He fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
"What's ironic?" she demanded.
As if he could understand the somber moment, Draco placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.
"Like Black's brother, Regulus?"
Oh dear sweet Merlin. It was bad enough that Harry was attached to the insect, but Theo? Theo? Harry was excused (for the most part) since he was unusual, a trait Draco learned to live with just as Harry learned to deal with his less than favorable ones. But Theo was different. Theo was the rational one of the group, who knew how inadequate the muggle world was to theirs, who was aware of the corruption Muggle-borns brought into their world.
"Both of us," Harry said.
After one last kiss, Draco eased back slightly. He grabbed a fistful of Harry's shirt and tore it apart, causing buttons to fly.
That was the only word he could use to describe how stunning Harry looked up there. Arms spread out, the sun lightening the golden specks in his eyes, the wind running through his hair, the look of utter joy on his face. He looked brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
"Shut up."
Behind the closed door, where he and Harry listened in on the conversation, Draco nearly smiled. It seemed Lupin wasn't as annoying as he thought.
Daphne giggled. "Good one, Potter."
That was the question that has been circling Harry's mind for years now, a question he was dying to ask but knew it would get no answer. Innocent people don't run from crimes they didn't commit. They don't hide away from the authority. They don't become fugitives. So why did Sirius?
"How about I give you a preview of those plans, love?" In a heartbeat, Draco had him pinned underneath him, grinning above him before leaning down for a kiss.
Speak of the devil and he shall appear.
Granger looked like she wanted to defend herself, to snap back to him. But her lips were quivering too much, her face too flushed.
Harry easily picked on what happened after that. Sirius ran. He ran to his house where he grabbed a bag that he stuffed with clothes, supplies, and money, oblivating his house-elf before he left once more.
A gasp boomed from his lips, his back arched, eyes clenched shut as pleasure blazed through him.
Draco's hands laid so casually were clenched into the cushions so tightly, Harry could almost hear the seams ripping apart thread by thread.
Little he did know how long it would be.
blew up his heart, pumping up the organ until it took up his entire chest, nearly breaking through his throat.
As Harry and Draco stepped through the other end of the floo, the Malfoys were already waiting for them in the living room, their faces grim.
Severus stayed still in his chair, a near flawless statue, not blinking, not moving. That alone gave Harry a faint, desperate hope that this was all just a horrible dream unfolding in his head. That nothing he saw today, nothing he heard was real. Until Severus flinched, breaking his gaze, grasping onto his left arm that was shaking on the desk, almost as if he were burnt.
"Me?" Hermione asked at the same time Ron said, "Why?"
"Harry." The touch was meant to be comforting; Harry could tell. Still, he couldn't relax into it like he usually did. Not when memories of white-blonde hair, pale eyes, and a silver mask spun around in his head.
Groaning, Harry's eyes raked over her figure. "You so owe, Malfoy."
"Oh, we're not playing with him today." Draco said, walking past them, heading towards the closet.
Taking slow steps down the stairs, each creak of the steps a thick curve of agitation cracked inside Draco, Father moved over to the living room. Seconds later, Draco followed him in. Father sat on his seat, in front of the coffee table that had a fresh kettle of tea and mugs waiting for him.
To find Draco there behind him, leaning against the wall, looking less and less happy as the seconds ticked by. "Lovegood?"
"That's right, Jamie," Harry grinned. "She's your baby sister and I know you're going to be a great big brother to her."
The idea of his solemn uncle dressed in a bright color, a startling shade of pink, was so surreal Harry had to bite his tongue to hold in his laughter.
"But why-"
"Er‚Ä¶" Harry had to bit his lip to keep in his laughter, though it was hard to do so when one was witnessing a flustered Draco.
Wild flames surrounding him, closing in, ready to devour him the way the snake had his old teacher, and an outstretched hand reaching out to him.
Harry slumped in his seat, hiding his burning-red face with his hands. That encouraged the singing waiters and waitress to come closer, singing louder.
, he scowled as he crawled into bed,
"At least I know how to read!" he snapped. "Unlike some people. And no, I don't consider those fashion magazines you're obsessed with reading material."
Granger's low, uneasy voice was almost as loud as thunder in the suddenly-quiet room, students anxious to hear of the news. "It says here he's been spotted in Dufftown. That's not far from here."
The last time he used it was Wednesday night; leaving Ron's dorm later than he expected and needing to take quick, teacher-free pathways to make it back to his room. Once he was back, he kept the map locked away in his trunk. Except now, two days later as he was finishing up his packing for the holidays, the map was gone.
"Then please just trust me now," Harry pleaded with his old friend. "I-I can't explain it, Draco, but I know what I'm doing. I have a gut feeling about this."
"Yeah," Cedric panted. "Yeah‚Ä¶I didn't believe it‚Ä¶he crept up behind me‚Ä¶I heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand‚Ä¶"
"More like,
There was also the matter of-
Remus smiled and began the day's lesson, ignoring the notes Severus had left on the blackboard. To the class's relief, although he didn't grade the essays, they were receiving credit for their effort. Hermione wasn't as thrilled, peeved that the ten pages she put in wouldn't receive a letter mark. After he dismissed the class, Harry lingered, asking the man if he was up for a walk in the forest. To his relief, Remus accepted his invitation, and soon they were in the brisk autumn air, leaves crunching beneath their feet.
"Shut up. You know what I mean." She drank straight from the bottle's mouth, taking in a big gulp.
"Could you do me a favor, darling? Would you mind passing this-" She snapped her fingers and a book from the top shelf in the back flew across the room, landing on Harry's lap. It was thick, almost the same size as their DADA books. "To Draco? I do so myself but there are last-minute arrangements I need to tend to."
"An arse that in a good five to ten years you two will be naming your first child after."
"Happily," Narcissa said, then glanced over at Sirius. "That is if my cousin is through with his tantrums."
Sunshine gleamed onto her light hair that was pulled into a low ponytail, shimmering like crystals. She wore a light-blue skintight suit that hugged every curve in her body, the short skirt fluttering by the wind, earning her cheers and praise from her admirers.
"Git." Draco socked him in the arm. Harry laughed, returning the favor to him.
"Exactly," Draco said. "It's just a phase. Just something get out of our system. We'll get over it."
The first thing he saw was pink; a light shade of pink that was so pale, it was almost white. The color reminded him of the flower buds from Mummy's gardens, and the powder she dabbed on her face whenever she and Daddy went out. His widened eyes traveling upward, Harry saw how wide the skirt was, almost big enough to fill out the doorway. Next was glitter, golden glitter sprinkled onto the bodice. The long sleeves were pushed off Draco's shoulders, revealing his bare skin, and were poufy at the top like some sort of satin bubbles. He wore a white diamond and gold necklace around his neck and on top of his head was a silver tiara encrusted with small pieces of pink jewels.
His words caused Fudge's scowl to tighten.
It was one thing to sing in private for friends just for fun or to sing for Draco when he needed some cheering up. It was quite another though to sing in public, reminding himself to stand straight, chin up, eyes steady and calm while nerves rattled inside his body like caged animals.
"You're right," Hermione said, her words soft but firm. "We don't know the Malfoys the way you do. We don't know Draco the way you do. But I know these facts. When I was researching the first Wizarding War, there were speculations over who was served the opposing side. Many that were suspected were purebloods, with the Malfoys being at the very top of the list."
Maybe he was a bit hard on Hermione. After all she was only trying to make peace. But it was ridiculous for her to suggest he be the one to apologize. He had no absolutely nothing to apologize for. Ron was the one who accused him of cheating his way in. He was one who called Harry a gloried attention-seeker. He was one acting like a big baby. As for having a difficult life?
Harry wasted no time. "I know it looks bad," he said. "Not just bad, really bad but it's not true. You have to believe me, Uncle. I didn't put my name in the cup."
"Oh?" A sharp brow arched. The gesture reminded him less of Granger and more of his mother, who always seemed to know something before anyone else did.
Draco spared a glance at Harry, who shrugged. He nodded thanks to Theo and had himself a bite.
A strangled cry tangled in his throat, Harry looked up at him. It was that look of sated pleasure, awe, and bewilderment that was Draco's undoing.
"Look everyone," Finnegan announced, his loud voice causing the noise in the Hall to defuse. "Weasley's got himself a Howler."
She wasn't the only one enthralled by what she was seeing. One look at her and Harry declared, "Forgot the party. We're staying in."
Harry understood their shock. He also knew that as soon as Severus woke up, he would have his head, his neck, his hide-everything. He couldn't think about that now. He had to get answers. "Tell me about Peter Pettigrew."
actually came out of his mouth, for Merlin's sake.
Still, Uncle James assured them the boys'only weekend would go on.
Just remembering that night made him quiver.
His eyes were still closed, so the words were sleepily mumbled. A closer examination showed whatever he was dreaming, it was anything but sweet.
"And finish off the poor soul with a hammer." A shudder went through Neville's body at the image. "Just for kicks."
Copying Slyther, he got down on his hands and knees. When he had Harry's attention, he pouted his lips, curled his tongue, and let it rip. The sound that came out him didn't sound at all like Slyther. It sounded like a snake, though by no means a strong one. It sounded pathetic; more than pathetic. But it seemed his effort didn't completely go to waste.
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric gave him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.
"God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait till my father hears about Dumbledore letting this oaf teaching classes."
Godric's Hollow never failed to take Draco's breath away. It was a mind-boggling sight compared to what he had been familiar with at the Manor. Complete polar opposites, which reminded him of how he and Harry were. Unlike the Malfoys, the Potters lived in a neighborhood as opposed to a private estate. Thankfully, there were wide, bush-filled gaps between each house, getting every house-owner a sense of privacy. Though the house was small compared to the Manor, it was still large in a modest way and beautiful in a pretty way. Fresh, green grass with a wide front-porch, a huge backyard with tall trees and a playground set the boys often used.
Suffice to say they had to take another shower after that
The determination and rage set upon the man's face was absolute. He wanted bloodshed and his shrieks made it clear whose blood he wanted. Remus sighed heavily as he handed over his wand.
"Because if timing isn't right or‚Ä¶the want isn't there, then it's fine." He smiled at her. "Whatever you decide, it's fine."
His plans, though, died in a fiery death as Harry felt magic thrumming in the air, sizzling as it expanded to fit the room. The workings of a shielding spell to prevent any attempt of escape. Courtesy of his husband who doubtlessly was readying his wand to fire the next spell at him. Likely a hex.
"Yes, sir," Harry answered. "He's my best friend."
, it whispered, bringing to mind soft, pink lips that tasted so sweet, miles of beautiful skin that was smooth and golden. Beautiful skin that needed to be touched, to be kissed, to be marked-
"I must admit I am impressed," Father went on, settling more into his chair, crossing one leg over the other. "I'd even call it a whole new record."
Shock slammed against Harry like a punch to the gut. "Sirius came to the house?"
Draco and his parents were there to greet Harry in the hospital tent and all congratulated Harry on a job well done. Harry found out he was tied for first place with Krum and learned that the golden egg contained the clue for the next task.
They needed to find the Chamber of Secrets before more students were hurt.
Narcissa made sure to talk to her boys about Sirius Black before they even thought about packing for school. She told them all she remembered about her cousin. They may have had a falling out, but she didn‚Äôt believe for one second that he actually betrayed those friends of his. He chose Potter, Lupin and Pettigrew over his own flesh and blood. She knew he was innocent but warned them to be cautious anyway. She sent them off to school with hugs and chocolates for them and their friends.
Harry was hesitant to share, but this was his best friend, he could tell him anything. ‚ÄúI use the memory of the first time you held my hand, right before you were sorted into Slytherin.‚Äù
Draco and Harry were walking across the courtyard when they overheard Ron talking to Seamus Finnigen, a fellow Gryffindor.
‚ÄúDraco, you‚Äôre brilliant!‚Äù Harry pulled Draco into a long kiss.
, because they knew what the first task was. Harry met them right at midnight and they led him over to where dragons were being kept.
Harry was left alone in Dumbledore‚Äôs office for awhile and he discovered Dumbledore‚Äôs pensieve. His curiosity gets the better of him and he viewed the memory. In the memory he saw Karkaroff on trial where he exposed many Death Eaters, including Barty Crouches son. After he was removed from the memory, Dumbledore explained the memory to him and showed him another. Following this, Harry explained what happened during Divination.
‚ÄúHarry! Hermione! Help!‚Äù
The twins take off after Scabbers, the Silver Trio following right behind. As they approached the Whomping Willow, Draco cast ‚ÄòImmobulus‚Äô on Scabbers and finally picked the little rat up.
The summer was pretty uneventful. The Malfoys didn‚Äôt hold their usual summer ball, as things were tense among their friends with Voldemort‚Äôs return. The boys played quidditch a lot to kill time and worked on their summer homework together. They invited the Twins and Hermione over a few times and spent time with them.
‚ÄúGreat, how do I fight dragons?‚Äù Harry asked.
‚ÄúEnemies of the Heir, beware! You‚Äôll be next Mudbloods!‚Äù A prejudiced 4
The day of the third task, Hermione figured out how Rita Skeeter was getting into the castle and left her friends to go put her theory to the test. McGonagall then announced that the family of the champions have arrived to watch the champions compete. Harry was thrilled to see Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were there for him. They spent dinner together, with Draco, Hermione and the Twins joining them. Following dinner, the champions were taken to the maze.
Draco and Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express and found Hermione and the Twins in a compartment towards the back. They walked in hand-in-hand, causing the Twins to tease them about their new relationship. Draco easily ignored them and then informed them all about the upcoming Tournament and the visiting schools. They were all intrigued.
The year continued without more attacks and a dueling club was started. It‚Äôs during an intense duel between the boys of the Silver trio that the whole school discovers Harry Potter was a parseltongue. After that, the other students kept a close eye on Harry and Draco, assuming they were the ones who opened the Chamber. If Harry spoke to snakes like the Dark Lord, then he was the main suspect for Heir of Slytherin. Harry and Draco were forced to spend time in their common room to avoid the hex happy students of the other houses. Its during those times when Hermione herself was petrified.
Harry mentioned to Draco that he asked Remus for lessons on casting a Patronus, because he‚Äôs sick of being so vulnerable around dementors. He wanted to be prepared in case the dementors attacked during another quidditch match. Draco was hesitant about the idea, especially after finding out Remus was a werewolf, thanks to Snape‚Äôs lesson on them and figuring out the lunar schedule. After a few letters exchanged with Hermione, however, Draco decided that Harry could take the lessons, as long as the rest of the Silver Trio could join the lessons as well.
‚ÄúFly?‚Äù
A streak of blonde tore across the pitch when Harry dropped through the dark sky. Dumbledore shouted a spell, but Draco didn‚Äôt hear as he caught Harry and they tumbled onto the soggy grass. White light filled the arena as a Patronus removed the Dementors from view.
Following his letter, Narcissa Malfoy actually showed up at the school and tried to get Harry out of the tournament, but she failed. There was nothing she could do. Harry was grateful for her efforts though. He also received a letter back from Sirius, telling him to be alone at the Slytherin fireplace on the 22
Draco‚Äôs friends burst through the door right then and stood between Draco and Sirius Black. Then things escalated from there. There was screaming and misunderstandings before Professor Lupin showed up and then all hell broke loose. The two adults tried to convince the kids that Peter Pettigrew killed Harry‚Äôs parents, not Sirius.
In the days before the summer ball, Draco seemed to be extremely nervous, something that Harry noticed and wrote Hermione about, asking for advice. Hermione knew why Draco was nervous, but kept Harry in the dark, telling him that he shouldn‚Äôt worry about it. So Harry followed Hermione‚Äôs advice.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt listen to them, they‚Äôre just jealous.‚Äù Draco kissed Harry‚Äôs cheek, causing Harry to blush.
The twins sighed. ‚ÄúGuess we should get the little bugger.‚Äù
Most nights, Harry woke up screaming about Cedric and his death. This led to Draco sleeping in his bed with him to help keep the nightmares away. Over the summer the two grew even closer. They spent every waking minute together and their relationship grew stronger.
He woke up to hearing arguing outside the door. Turned out that Fudge let a dementor kiss Barty Crouch Jr and couldn‚Äôt take Harry for his word because the kid was dangerous and likely lying. Dumbledore gave Harry his winnings and Harry quickly went back to sleep, not wanting to think about Cedric‚Äôs death anymore.
That was how Ron discovered hundreds of spiders in his bed that night, how Draco and Harry ended up defeating a mountain troll and becoming friends with Hermione, and how the twins discovered a liking for the two Slytherins.
Harry returned to the common room just in time to talk to Sirius. Sirius talked a lot about Death Eaters, like Karkaroff, the headmaster of Durmstrang. But he didn‚Äôt get a chance to give him advice on what to do about the dragons when Draco walked in and disturbed their call.
Harry quickly discovered why Draco was nervous when he presented him with a bracelet, at the summer ball, which was the first step of courting. Once Draco told him what courting meant, Harry immediately said yes. Narcissa immediately put a set of rules in place, including no sleeping in the same room while at Malfoy Manor. After the ball, Draco dragged Harry away to their wing of the manor and there they shared their first kiss.
‚ÄúThis blasted thing,‚Äù He sighed, placing the wand back into his coat.
‚ÄúWhere to, lads? And lady?‚Äù Blaise asked the group, humbly bowing his head to the sole female in the group. Draco wanted to roll his eyes at the sight, but avoided doing so in hopes that Blaise wouldn‚Äôt say something to embarrass him later on.
Draco stared at the parchment in front of him, struggling to find the words that came so easily to him a moment ago. Evidently, he blamed it on the noise. As more Muggles poured into the coffee shop, he scowled at their incredible loudness. It was 10 AM on a Saturday, so perhaps it was his fault for assuming there would be no people around. Still, he preferred the loud noise of Muggles than anything he would experience in Hogsmeade, which was full of Hogwarts students and wizards he went to school with who couldn‚Äôt get over the war.
The rocks dug into themselves until they reached a solid bottom. Oddly enough, there was no water underneath the well, but a rather shallow puddle on the ground, and an empty space between, meaning there was another level below the catacombs that had been sealed by someone.
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off, after realizing he wouldn‚Äôt say anything.
As scandalized as he was, he couldn‚Äôt help the small tug at the corner of his lips, giving into the slightest smile.
‚ÄúHow do you and my father know each other?‚Äù
Blaise too, was now leaning against the front door, waiting for Draco, it seemed.
‚ÄúI asked Blaise to make sure he was sober enough to take you home.‚Äù
Pansy must have sensed this as she immediately bit her tongue and stammered an apology.
A knock on his door threatened his peace, but he knew he had to answer it. Shrugging off his black overcoat, he opened the door to find Harry standing on the other side of it.
Draco stared down at his own drink, which was now nothing more than a watered-down gin and tonic. He watched as the ice melted somewhere in between the forced jokes and half-lipped smiles he shared with Pansy. Something about the way his drink diluted before his very eyes soured his mood.
‚ÄúPans,‚Äù Draco started, with a confused expression on his face, ‚ÄúWho else did you invite?‚Äù
The door handle began to turn. Draco panicked and rushed inside one of the bathroom stalls. He nearly slapped his hand to his forehead when he realized he‚Äôd left the faucet running.
‚ÄúAnyways, we should focus on the task at-‚Äù
‚ÄúMy name is Draco, of course I speak Latin,‚Äù Draco rolled his eyes at him.
Draco said nothing. Instead, he gritted his teeth together so hard he thought his jaw would break.
‚ÄúIs he still there?‚Äù Draco remembered his mother‚Äôs letter, stating that he was in Brussels the last time he wrote to her.
‚ÄúTheodore took her home.‚Äù Anthony said from behind him, allowing his beating heart to ease itself for a moment.
‚ÄúDraco‚Ä¶‚Äù She sighed, sounding exasperated of having to continue this conversation again.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the half of it,‚Äù Draco smiled slyly at the man, with a willful glint in his eye. Perhaps it was the alcohol, or the fact that Anthony was sitting much closer to him than before, but he noticed the smell of sandalwood and pine and couldn‚Äôt help but realize how
The moment between them was gone and Draco rolled his eyes as he opened the door, facing an incredibly nosy and wide-eyed Pansy, who had hoped secretly in her mind to catch them in some inappropriate act or another.
Narcissa surprised him by raising her voice too, ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôd sooner join them than your own family.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have.‚Äù Draco responded, handing him back the newly signed documents Robards had given to him previously, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs in my best interests to accept.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, you know. I get them too.‚Äù Potter spoke softly, stepping aside so that Draco could exit the stall.
Had their friendship not been so close, she would have slapped him across the face. Instead, the pair roared with laughter, while Pansy gave him a playful punch on the shoulder. Draco found it hard to keep a straight face as well, allowing for a snicker to escape.
‚ÄúDo you want anything to drink? I have coffee, tea, or ‚Äì
Draco, confused, asked the Auror, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
you‚Äôve finally figured it out,‚Äù Her loud, boisterous laugh caused a few Muggles to turn their heads around, but it didn‚Äôt stop Pansy from being as loud as ever.
Potter replied, scratching at his chin, ‚ÄúIt would make sense.‚Äù
‚ÄúParkinson,‚Äú Narcissa looked deep in thought, ‚ÄúA pure blood family. Is she spoken for?‚Äù
Onlookers inside the restaurant followed the noise with their glances, directing their attention back to him. His heart couldn‚Äôt stop racing. He hastily made his way to the men‚Äôs room, taking a deep breath of relief when he realized he was finally alone. Now, he could panic in peace.
Harry‚Äôs face visibly lifted. The sight of his emerald eyes glowing so vibrantly was almost too much to bear, but Draco couldn‚Äôt find it within himself to look away. It was embarrassing, to say the least, that the last time Draco had looked into Harry‚Äôs eyes was when he was utterly sloshed. It was nice looking at them while sober, though Draco would never admit it.
‚ÄúDraco?‚Äù She looked up from the letter she was reading, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here so early?‚Äù
Was this all a dream? It certainly felt like it, but the awkwardness of the situation made it all too real. He huffed and turned to Pansy, ‚ÄúYou are the worst friend ever.‚Äù
‚ÄúI found this last week while cleaning the attic,‚Äù Harry placed the frame back on the cabinet, staring at a prepubescent Sirius, who looked like he wanted nothing more than to break from his mother‚Äôs grasp and leave to do whatever young boys do, ‚ÄúThis was the only picture of him I could find. Walburga burned him off the tapestry.‚Äù
Weasley straightened his back upon seeing the former Death Eater. He said nothing to him while he remained in Robards‚Äô office. Instead, he leaned over his boss‚Äôs desk to direct his attention to the stack of documents he laid out in front of him.
‚ÄúWhat more could we possibly have to say to each other now? It‚Äôs best we leave it be.‚Äù
He stared down at his feet and frowned, thinking that yes, time had passed, but had he truly healed?
Anthony, who Draco had noticed hadn‚Äôt removed his arm from his shoulder, moved a bit closer, as if he was trying to hold himself up, despite sitting on a stool. Anthony really
Narcissa shook her head, still reading the letter intently, ‚ÄúAs did I. It seems his business is taking him elsewhere.‚Äù
The rest of their afternoon together was quite pleasant, as they steered the topic away from the horrors of the night before. Eventually, Pansy had to leave, and Draco had to go as well. As they parted ways, a promise of later engagements passed their lips, and for once, Draco felt excited about the aspect of seeing his old friends again.
Pansy guffawed at his effort, startling him and leaving him unable to finish his testimony.
‚ÄúNow then, have you thought about my offer?‚Äù Robards leaned back in his chair, eying Draco‚Äôs composed demeanor.
Draco looked at her with disbelief, ‚ÄúYou sure about that?‚Äù
Harry laughed at that, ‚ÄúYeah, I can see that.‚Äù
Draco rubbed the back of his neck while his face burned a scarlet red, ‚ÄúAh, well, you see ‚Äì the thing is‚Ä¶‚Äù
Draco nearly laughed at that, but all he could manage was a snicker, ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt be more different, really.‚Äù
Draco blinked, and for a moment, he forgot where he was, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶yes. Forgive me, the house-‚Äú
She snickered as he felt a small thump on the bed and turned minutely to see a small vial had been thrown on his pillow.
‚ÄúMr. Malfoy,‚Äù A voice rang from across the hall, causing the blonde wizard to look up from the copy of the Daily Prophet that laid upon the waiting room table, ‚ÄúFollow me, please.‚Äù
A house-elf led them to his mother‚Äôs parlour, disappearing momentarily to bring the pair some fresh tea. Draco would have declined if he‚Äôd gotten the chance, but he knew what his mother would say.
Both Harry and Draco raised their hand at the same time, causing a sheepish Draco to withdraw his hand. They looked over at each other uneasily as it happened.
He expected this question. While he wanted to be as honest with Robards as he could, he couldn‚Äôt possibly tell him everything, ‚ÄúNo, not for a while now. My mother is the only one who receives word from him, but he never mentions his location.‚Äù
Draco smiled back at him, albeit a bit timidly, ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs fine with me. It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Robards.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy family-‚Äú
‚ÄúOh relax, I‚Äôm coming,‚Äù Draco rolled his eyes at the pair, remembering to leave his now discarded robe folded on the chair.
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Blaise stood, making conversation with the group, ‚Äúthat was a quick meeting.‚Äù
Draco felt his heart beat in his chest at a steady rate,
Her ears perked up then, placing her tea back onto the tray, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
‚ÄúI suppose a trial run couldn‚Äôt hurt,‚Äù He shrugged, disbelieving his words as they left his mouth.
Not long after their groups integrated with one another, Pansy and Theodore made their way to the dance floor, despite the fact that there probably wasn‚Äôt a dance floor to begin with. From seeing how Pansy wrapped her entire body around the man, it was clear she likely wasn‚Äôt going home alone. After that, Justin led Lovegood and many others as they danced to a Muggle pop song that Draco had heard of once or twice from the shops nearby. Eventually, all that was left behind was Ginny, Harry, Anthony and Draco. Even Longbottom was too hammered to say no to dancing, and from the way he moved his body, Draco could tell he was just as drunk as he looked. Anthony, who Draco had barely talked to since Harry came by, put his arm around Draco‚Äôs shoulders once more.
the war ‚Äì not like Draco did.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a child!‚Äù His voice shook and for a moment, Draco thought he‚Äôd lost himself, ‚ÄúI know, okay? I saw his picture on their board, they‚Äôre just waiting to put a big, red X on it, I know it!‚Äù
‚ÄúDraco,‚Äù Blaise eventually turned to share a quick embrace with him, ‚Äúyou look good. It‚Äôs been awhile.‚Äù
He sat there for a moment, with an empty coffee cup in hand and his pride feeling a bit wounded. As he stood up, grabbing his coat, he saw the parchment on the table, with only
Draco was still a bit shell-shocked and did not respond. Eventually though, the man stared up at him, studying him in a way that made him feel simultaneously guilty and sheepish, for Merlin knows what reason.
‚ÄúI take it you recognize this?‚Äù Robards asked, holding the Time-Turner in his hand.
He‚Äôd just started to get used to his presence, after working together for a number of weeks now. Day after day, he and the others would come through Draco‚Äôs office, strategizing and trying to find new leads regarding Lucius‚Äôs whereabouts since the trail had gone cold after their last excursion to Luxembourg. Most days, the pair were never alone, but as he stared into his green eyes, he was surprised to find himself pleased at the fact that it was him and not Blaise or Pansy, or some other uninvited guest trying to offer him comfort. Their relationship had gotten better for the most part; No more snarky side comments or otherwise unwillingness to play nice. Since the last time they were alone together in the bathroom of that restaurant, Draco realized that Harry was the last person to judge him for needing some time alone. In fact, he understood it all too well.
(See the end of the chapter for
At first, Draco was in denial. He just stood there, paralyzed as if someone cast Stupefy on him. Unable to move, or speak, he then began to feel anger. Anger at himself, but also at Potter, for thinking it was okay to just drop in his life out of the blue after all these years, when his life was
, are you really going out wearing that?‚Äù
‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre-‚Äù
‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Potter reached his hand out, stopping Draco in his tracks, ‚ÄúIt could be a trap.‚Äù
Potter tried, waving his wand over the well.
Draco might have snickered, if he wasn‚Äôt taking a long, hard sip of his gin and tonic. Wiping his mouth with the napkin in front of him, he smirked, ‚Äú‚ÄôLots changed since then.‚Äù
"I don‚Äôt know, Draco,‚Äù She rolled her eyes at him, ‚ÄúMaybe it has something to do with my parents being locked away in Azkaban, or it could just be my imagination.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually at my home, we‚Äôll only be gone for a second,‚Äù Harry responded, refusing to make eye contact and staring at something interesting in the direction of the Ministry.
She rolled her eyes at him again, but this time, with a playful smile at her lips, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your sense of adventure, Malfoy?‚Äù
Draco couldn‚Äôt believe what he was hearing. He thought, for a moment, that it was some sick joke played onto him by the universe. As he stared into her face waiting for her to show some sign of understanding, he realized that she was completely serious and there was no getting around the idea of marriage.
Draco rolled his eyes and stared at her expectantly until she finally answered his question.
Blaise was the first to greet the two outsiders while Pansy continued to chatter with Millicent about whatever it was that females chatted about. Draco, looking mildly uncomfortable, sat next to Theodore, who was at least a friendlier face to see.
Robards nodded, ‚ÄúYes, or at least within our department.‚Äù
‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Robards rubbed his chin in a sleuthical way, ‚ÄúYou may go.‚Äù
The closer Draco got to the table, he was able to recognize some more of the faces around him. Lovegood was there and was in deep conversation with Justin, which was no surprise there, since they were both Ravenclaws. Theodore and Millicent mostly kept to themselves, while Blaise talked to Granger and Weasley. Longbottom and the other Weasley girl laughed at a joke Anthony had told. And Harry‚Ä¶well, Harry was talking to Pansy, and they both seemed to sense Draco openly staring as they both turned their heads, as if on que, to look at the bewildered man. Had Draco been sober, he would‚Äôve died of embarrassment. But after the pep talk he had given himself in the restroom and the liquid courage in his system, he sauntered over to them as if he wasn‚Äôt currently shitting himself.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Draco pulled away from Harry‚Äôs grasp, taking a moment to grasp onto the sink, something solid to ground him to the present day, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you have to see me like this.‚Äù
Draco stiffened, ‚ÄúWhat does he want?‚Äù
Draco shrugged, though internally rejoicing for the change in topic, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind some takeaway. Are you okay with Chinese?‚Äù
starting to come together.
‚ÄúWait, what is that?‚Äù Potter asked, pointing to the shimmery ink that was now fully visible to the two of them.
‚ÄúThe Bock Casemates, of course!‚Äù Blaise replied as he recognized the fortress behind them, ‚ÄúI saw a sign leading down to a tunnel.‚Äù
Blaise gave him an apologetic look, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. That can‚Äôt be easy.‚Äù
Blaise looked baffled, ‚ÄúDraco Malfoy eating Muggle takeaway? I never thought I‚Äôd live to see the day.‚Äù
He couldn‚Äôt remember who it was that ordered more drinks for the table, but soon their intertwined groups had begun to dominate that area of the pub, as they had to put two tables together to fit everyone. Draco, feeling more drunk than usual, was quite talkative, and tried to make conversation with every person there. He also tried his best to avoid Harry in conversation, but it was hard to do when the man actively
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre ready to see me now?‚Äù His voice had an audible tremor in it, though he covered it up by clearing his throat.
"I wasn‚Äôt the one who named him,‚Äù Draco smiled slightly at the memory, ‚ÄúA floor down from my flat, there‚Äôs a Muggle family with a young daughter. When I found him, she called him that because of his white paws. The name sort of stuck. It‚Äôs the only name he responds to.‚Äù
Narcissa waited for him to continue, but when he did not, she realized it was of a serious nature, ‚ÄúCome. Join me in the parlour.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you go to Hogwarts?‚Äù Draco asked, wanting to change the conversation to anything but Potter. Regardless of his reasons being jealousy and anger, Harry looked thankful.
‚ÄúI was also surprised to hear you advocated for me,‚Äù Blaise met Draco‚Äôs gaze, trying to change the subject from his father.
it‚Äôd been since he‚Äôs felt someone touch him. Not even sexually, but to feel the firm arms of another wrapped around you. He couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he felt that.
Blaise stopped in his tracks, craning his head around to give Draco an incredulous look, ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù
The footsteps stopped directly outside of the stall. Small, audible breaths were heard outside of the stall door until a familiar voice eventually replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Blaise.‚Äù
Draco recognized the look on his face - pure, unsolicited lust - it was. He‚Äôd seen it one to many times while at school. Blaise has always been a dog, even as an adult.
The action made Draco gulp, but he played it off with a shrug, ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚Äù
Robards shuffled in his seat, as if to prepare to stand, ‚ÄúAs soon as I get confirmation. In the meantime, I‚Äôd suggest the team get acquainted with one another in Draco‚Äôs office. You‚Äôll likely be working together for a while. Meeting adjourned.‚Äù
Pansy grinned like a child and escorted herself out of his bedroom. After Draco showered and got dressed, he waltzed out with her to the caf√© he always frequented on the weekends. That is, when he wasn‚Äôt burying himself under the pile of work he
‚ÄúI need another drink,‚Äù Malfoy muttered, before screaming loud enough to cause Harry and the others to flinch, ‚ÄúWAITRESS! A COCKTAIL PLEASE.‚Äù
Draco, unsure of how to answer her, opted for an awkward chuckle and a yes that sounded more like a question. Mittens, free from Draco‚Äôs grasp, came to Irma willingly and sat upon her lap, causing tears to well up in the drunk woman‚Äôs eyes. Draco took the opportunity to step out onto the balcony, hoping to get some fresh air, when Blaise, ever the lecher, replaced his seat and coyly placed an arm over Irma‚Äôs shoulders.
‚ÄúJust in here,‚Äù Harry propped the door open, before rushing ahead into some hidden room down a hallway.
As much as Draco wanted to remain scowling and indifferent towards the situation, forever stewing in his gloom, he found it was difficult to do so with the influence of alcohol coursing through his veins. He couldn‚Äôt deny himself the pleasure of conversing with his friends, and some acquaintances, while feeling particularly courageous after having a few drinks.
Before long, they reached the entrance to the Ministry. Draco waved Blaise off before lingering a bit, staring at the building and the burning feeling in his gut ‚Äì a feeling that was not unfamiliar to him, shouting that he did not belong. It bothered him at times, mostly when he felt guilty or shameful when thinking of the past. This time, as he stared at the building in distaste, he didn‚Äôt feel neither shameful nor guilty. Instead, he just felt lost.
‚ÄúHow do you know he hasn‚Äôt used it already?‚Äù Draco asked, more out of sheer curiosity than anything. He wanted to know what they knew before letting on any information he already had.
Draco tried not to have any visible reactions on his face. He knew the likelihood of his father hiding the Time-Turner was very high, but didn‚Äôt want to let on any more information than what's already been told. His father may be mad, but he‚Äôs always been incredibly intelligent. He‚Äôs likely already five steps ahead of them, trying to throw them off of his trail by popping up in different places across the map, sending them on a wild goose-chase to deter them from finding his real hiding spot, wherever that may be. But again, it was simply too soon to speculate.
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve got yourself a flat around here, yeah? I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt buy a wizarding home.‚Äù Draco sipped at the last of his drink, before wiping his mouth with a carefully folded napkin.
Remembering his time in Rotterdam, Draco whispered, ‚Äú
Draco found himself zoning out of their conversation. Blaise was many things ‚Äì arrogant at times, a bit selfish, and often quite pompous, but he was never a Death Eater, nor was anyone in his family, which is likely the reason he had decided to undergo Auror training after the war had ended. Despite him being enthusiastic, and pretty damn good at his job, the fact that he was a Slytherin and hadn‚Äôt fought on either side during the war meant his training was prolonged, unlike certain Gryffindors who were practically handed job offers.
A soft purr brought his attention down to the floor where Mittens figure-eighted between his legs. Harry‚Äôs eyes brightened almost instantly as he knelt down to caress the cat, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think your flat would be so‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúShut up, Pansy!‚Äù Draco yelled back, immediately wincing after as his head throbbed.
The truth was that since the case led him to Rotterdam, Draco couldn‚Äôt get his father out of his mind. At night, he dreamt of being condemned to that fiery wheel himself as Ixion was, watching as his father cast him out, grinning that barmy grin that only a power-hungry madman could give. At least it was a break from his usual nightmares involving Potter, especially now that Draco had finally come to terms with the truth he had been hiding for so long. Draco fancied him, perhaps since the beginning, but it hardly mattered now. He doubted Harry would ever feel the same way, and even if he did, the two could hardly stand being near one another long enough to not argue about some stupid matter or another. At least Draco could thank his lucky stars that he was able to suppress these feelings, if need be. He‚Äôd already been doing it for so long, what‚Äôs an extra dozen years or so? And still, with the looming threat of his father trying to use a Time-Turner to bring back the Dark Lord, Draco could hardly think about anything else.
‚ÄúGoodnight, Draco.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the face?‚Äù Blaise bumped him with his elbow, ‚ÄúYour water tastes funny?‚Äù
Draco turned back to the painting then, understanding the look of terror on the man‚Äôs face. Just below the portrait, on the title and description that was written in Dutch, Draco spotted something below it, something written in magical ink. It was invisible to the naked eye unless you were a wizard, of course. It was easy enough to detect, Draco had seen invisible ink like this before when working on other dark artefacts.
‚ÄúDraco, you‚Äôve barely touched your tea,‚Äù Narcissa spoke aloud, bringing his thoughts back to the present.
After some time and several miles within the tunnels, they had passed through a particularly narrow passage, leading to a large entryway that must have been used as a barracks or storage room by the shape of it. The large, empty space left much to be desired, but Draco could see, in the distance, a well that stood in the center of it.
‚ÄúDid Lucius mention where he might be going next?‚Äù
With that, he walked out of the door, not waiting for the house-elf to escort him there, until the Manor was far out of view.
‚ÄúMillicent, you look great! You lost so much weight,‚Äù Pansy practically gushed over the woman in front of her, who really did in fact, look quite beautiful.
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Draco responded. He didn‚Äôt need it explained to him.
‚ÄúMe!‚Äù he shouted, causing everyone in the room to quiet instantly and look at Draco.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Draco opened the door wider so Harry could step in.
Lucius began to shake with fury, but Narcissa spoke to try and mediate the situation, ‚ÄúDraco, please be reasonable! You will learn to love her with time.‚Äù
As he stepped into the Manor, he was unsurprised to feel the massive headache that often accompanied him on these visits. He tried not to think of the horrible memories threatening his sanity as he passed the hallowing hallways into his mother‚Äôs parlor, which seemed to be the only room in the house that the Dark Lord didn‚Äôt corrupt. That didn‚Äôt surprise him; his mother greatly prided herself in keeping this room to herself, as if it was her little secret getaway from the dreadful events this house had endured.
‚ÄúThis is just a reconnaissance mission, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù He muttered to himself, though he could barely hear anything over the noise of some muggle band playing loudly over the speakers, and the noise of chit-chatting from the crowds around him.
‚ÄúI saw Pansy today. Pansy Parkinson. Do you remember her?‚Äù Draco blurted out without really meaning to.
on the other hand, well‚Ä¶that was a different story. His mother prevented him from being disowned, as long as he married a pure blood witch, then he could have as many liaisons as he wished. That
‚ÄúOh stop it. He was nothing but a gentleman the whole night.‚Äù The look on her face forced her to act casually, but Draco could see past it ‚Äì the way her eyes lit up, and the way her cheeks bore the slightest pink tinge.
Draco looked around at his friends and felt his lips droop. Blaise and Justin were chatting about something work-related, while Millicent, Theodore and Pansy seemed to be laughing over some ludicrous story Pansy had told them.
Even Harry couldn‚Äôt help but smile at the comment, ‚ÄúIt means pretty boy in German.‚Äù
On the subject of knocking before entering, Draco had mixed opinions. As a child, if Draco were to enter any room in the Manor before knocking, he was sure to receive lashings from his father due to the sheer disrespectful nature of it. Living at Hogwarts for most of his childhood, however, he realized that knocking before entering was not always required. In fact, most times, he rarely knocked before he entered a room, especially if he were entering the Slytherin dormitories or classrooms.
As an adult, he understood the propriety of it, though he supposed there was wiggle room in the door-knocking debate if the door was already slightly ajar. What then? Does he knock before pushing it open? Or does he walk in unannounced, regardless if there is anyone in the room or not?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I need to-,‚Äù Draco scraped his chair loudly against the floor as he stood abruptly and made his way to the bathroom.
‚ÄúThis morning at approximately seven o‚Äôclock.‚Äù Robards responded, pushing his sleeves back as he continued, ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôve already sent a detachment to scout out the area where he was spotted. I want Malfoy, Potter and Zabini to be the first on the scene if we get a visual on him. Miss Dendron and Mr. Longbottom, I‚Äôve arranged for you to meet with the local Aurors in the area and set up a place to conduct your tracking spells efficiently. Miss Dendron, I believe you are familiar with the object he‚Äôs using?‚Äù
Draco stood over the edge of the pavement of Het Park, looking onward as the Nieuwe Maas revealed more buildings across the way. They had just apparated to Rotterdam, and he had found himself here - drawn to nature corrupted by steel buildings and polluted water. In that way, Rotterdam was very similar to London. Draco thought to himself as he watched the boats come and go that he would have liked to see Rotterdam in its heyday, before the surge of bold architecture was created to show its modernist teeth to the world. Not that it mattered, Draco was near certain they would be leaving quite soon. He was certain his father wouldn‚Äôt stick around long enough to make a second appearance. Yet, it all seemed too convenient that after he was spotted, the Auror department seemed to get word of it immediately. How did they know where to look? Unless, of course, the anonymous tip called in was Lucius himself hoping to throw them off of his trail. Still, Draco didn‚Äôt mind the sightseeing, even if it was a waste of time.
He offered her a meaningful smile, ‚ÄúOf course I will, Pans.‚Äù
Draco sat there speechless as the man continued.
Pansy gave him an incredulous look before taking another sip of her martini. It wasn‚Äôt Buckingham Palace, sure, but it was comfortable enough. Though, he supposed moving to a nicer loft closer to the Ministry wouldn‚Äôt be terrible.
thing. And I will tell you the same. You are crazy for following him.‚Äù
Draco rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that, he‚Äôs also a part of our team, per Robards‚Äô orders.‚Äù
To Draco‚Äôs left, he could see Blaise walking back towards them, intrigued by the direction of their new conversation.
Ginny, much to Draco‚Äôs surprise, also had chuckled at Harry‚Äôs bewildered expression before she leaned into Harry‚Äôs ear to say something over the loud noise, then excused herself to the lady‚Äôs room.
The thought came to him angrily, although he wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if his idiotic, drunken self had told him. He wanted to tear the letter to shreds and throw it out the window, but the sound of Mittens purring against his leg calmed him down enough to set the letter down on the dining room table as he took a seat.
Blaise sneered, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs very few things you would sell your freedom for, even fewer people. What did they offer you? Something you can‚Äôt refuse, I imagine.‚Äù
He wanted to scoff at her question but didn‚Äôt want to disrespect his mother by doing so. There was always something on his mind, that was the problem.
off of a book that looked tattered and dusted over, though he wouldn‚Äôt have minded to sink his claws into it and take it home with him.
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at him, ready to lecture him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong, Draco. How dare you speak of your father that way.‚Äù
The trio stood in silence for a moment, contemplating the words spoken aloud. Draco pondered what they could mean, knowing that it was likely the well itself was not magical in any way, and yet, he had a strange feeling that the passage was meant to lead inside the well.
wouldn‚Äôt be able to Apparate safely, nor use the Floo. It seemed his only option was to take the Tube.
Irma, already tipsy off a couple of shots of firewhiskey, looked as if he‚Äôd told her she‚Äôs just won a million galleons, ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù
Irma was the first to speak up, in a cheery tone, ‚ÄúExcept me, of course. You lot graduated five years after I did.‚Äù
‚ÄúSeriously though,‚Äù Potter spoke to the rest of the group, wielding a rather proud face, ‚Äúif Malfoy hadn‚Äôt found that inscription on the painting, I‚Äôm not sure what we‚Äôd have done.‚Äù
His eyes widened upon seeing the giant binder, to which Robards laughed boisterously, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry lad, you don‚Äôt need to read it all at once. This is the new hire packet. It explains all of our rules, laws, history; basically it includes everything you need to know about our department. Most of it, I‚Äôm sure, you‚Äôve read through before considering your previous work with the Ministry.‚Äù
Blaise‚Äôs eyes lit up at the question, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going wonderfully. Just the other day, I was assisting the Head Auror on this case‚Ä¶‚Äù
His face dropped and his eyes darkened. Among one of the unspoken things they were
This chapter took me a super long time to write because I ended up changing a bunch of things. I mentioned this before, but this story is a slow burn!!! There will be a happy ending (eventually), but i've barely scratched the surface of what this story is about, so please bear with me. I'm thankful to all those who've sent me nice messages about the story, and I promise I will continue updating this and my other story (Dandelion Prophet), as much as possible. With the holidays coming up, I have some days off so I will spend those days writing as much as I can. Have a great rest of your week, everyone!!!!
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Draco cleared his throat, awkwardly as Potter walked about in his room.
‚ÄúDraco dear, shut the door, would you?‚Äù His mother had failed to look up from whatever it was she was reading.
Looking up at the Manor, which seemed rather menacing as a thick layer of fog covered the ground and thunder roared in the distance, he remembered his letter from his mother. He knew he was early for tea, but it didn‚Äôt matter. After the day he had, he quickly realized that nothing he thought mattered actually mattered.
‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Blaise demanded, his face surprisingly hard, ‚ÄúAre you going to take it?‚Äù
Potter nodded once and Draco left to go up the stairs. He searched and scoured through every exhibit he could find. Not long passed before Draco realized that there was nothing there and Lucius was gone. What was the point of him coming to this museum, of all places? It made no sense to him. It was clear Lucius had turned into a madman following the war, but even so, what was he to gain from this? What was he to gain by popping up in a Muggle art museum so far from home?
‚ÄúPermanent employment? As an Auror?‚Äù Draco asked, voice cracking in disbelief.
‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre angry,‚Äù Blaise walked over to him, giving him an understanding look, ‚Äúbut you can‚Äôt let your anger cloud your judgement. Come on, we‚Äôve got to leave within the hour.‚Äù
The manor was silent save his yelling. Draco thought the glass would shake from the noise, but if they could withstand the screams of torture from his classmates, they could withstand him screaming now.
‚ÄúMaybe another drink will make you talk,‚Äù Draco wanted to refuse, and really, he should have. Instead, he nodded, since words came a bit harder for him at that moment.
Draco tried to suppress the bitterness in his tone, but found it a bit impossible as he raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt being an Auror make it difficult to be inebriated every week?‚Äù
After that, a moment of silence ensued where neither one of them knew what to say next. It lasted for nearly a minute until Pansy hesitantly took her leave, with a promise at her lips to meet up again soon. He hoped she meant it.
Blaise laughed at his stoic expression, despite moving their discussion to more stories about his new partner‚Äôs placement. Dorian was his name ‚Äì an older gentleman who seemed to have a distaste for Slytherins, as much of the rest of the Wizarding World did after the war. Blaise‚Äôs stories were bordering on cynical, although he laughed it off regardless. Draco could imagine that he would experience the same discrimination if he accepted the job offer, though he tried not to think about it too much.
He looked around the room, watching as those around him wielded the same expression of mixed surprise and playfulness. All except for Harry, whose eyes stayed trained on his drink. To his right, he felt Pansy pour him another shot of Firewhiskey, before bringing it to his lips, yet his eyes never left Harry, who refused to look at him. Even Neville and Justin, who he hadn't had much chance to talk to yet, smiled at him as if it had just been announced he and Anthony were newly engaged. Draco didn‚Äôt know what to make of it.
Harry chuckled, ‚ÄúIt certainly can be. What is that one you‚Äôre looking at? The fall of Ixion? That‚Äôs based on a Greek myth, you know.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy dear,‚Äù Narcissa stood abruptly as she took in his appearance and walked over to him, worry etched into her features, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Has something happened?‚Äù
Harry seemed unconvinced, ‚ÄúRight...well, our shift is over. A few of us are getting drinks, would you like to join us?‚Äù
The lot of them erupted into a flurry of chanting and laughter over drinks. From the sound of it, it was likely they were playing a drinking game inside, which led Draco to yearn for the comfort of the indoors. Not that he was uncomfortable with Anthony‚Äôs words or his closeness, but he couldn't help but feel a bit startled by it. Not to mention the fact that all of his friends were inside, waiting to celebrate
The sun had just barely set and from the streaks of pastels in the sky, Draco could see it would be another clear night. Frankly, they were starting to become rarer as the seasons began to change. The memory of the grey skies casting over the Manor earlier that day sat uneasily in his mind. He took a deep breath, letting the air fill his lungs for a precious few minutes before he heard the sliding of the glass door and footsteps coming from behind him. Exhaling sharply, he turned around to face the intruder of his peace. Draco half-expected it to be Harry but felt the unmistakable sense of disappointment to find it was, in fact, Anthony Goldstein who had joined him outside on the balcony.
Draco let it slam behind him. The cold air of the outside hit him like a ton of bricks, and Draco suddenly couldn‚Äôt breathe. He tried and tried, but the more he gasped for air, the tighter his throat closed. Yet, he still walked on, refusing to look behind him as the House of Black transformed into a muggle building once more. Without a second thought, he whipped his newly returned wand and apparated home.
‚ÄúAnd what about you?‚Äù She waggled her eyebrows at him, ‚ÄúIs there a witch that‚Äôs finally caught your eye?‚Äù
‚ÄúThen we find nothing,‚Äù he sighed, hoping that wouldn‚Äôt be the case.
Pansy cackled, ‚ÄúAt this point, you‚Äôd let anyone fuck you.‚Äù
‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Draco interrupted her, mildly offended, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo we
‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Narcissa sighed, ‚Äúis a letter from your father.‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe I could start now,‚Äù Harry gave him a crooked smile, one Draco had seen so many times before but never directed at him.
The bewilderment of the crowd matched the bewilderment Draco felt during that entire announcement. Some faces looked angry, others not so much. Longbottom was clearly not pleased, though Weasley maintained a coolness to his expression that made it seem like he couldn‚Äôt care less. However, none of the faces looked the least bit surprised upon seeing him. Rumors spread fast, Draco has come to realize, and since his first venture to the Auror department, people had already begun to figure out that Draco was soon to be employed there.
