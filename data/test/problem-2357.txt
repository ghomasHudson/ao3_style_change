. Harry tried not to look mortified as he sulked to his room, feeling the peer pressure get to him. He found the jacket he had been wearing the day before on the floor where he had left it and an orange scarf hung up on the bed frame. Sometimes he resented luna for her kindness, but only sometimes. He looked at his wand on his bedside table, considered slipping it in his pocket for a second, then decided it was a good excuse to leave later on when things got uncomfortable as they were sure to. He put it away safely in the draw.
"Good morning lovegood," draco chimed quietly, his eyes flitting between the ditsy shoeless lady in front of him and the demonstration going on about correct re potting of venomous wormtail weed. Something gently brushed Draco's hand making him jump and yelp, turning a few heads in his direction embarrassingly. He looked down and saw luna trying to pass him a little stem of dainty blue flowers like some kind of organised drug deal. He wondered for a second if the flowers were a drug, but he'd seen them growing in the front of the school and decided they were probably safe.
"You never mentioned that," Ginny swatted at Luna's knee, accepting the joint from her but keeping it away from her face. Harry took it, holding it in his lips while he messed with ginny's hair, looping and knotting it loosely.

Then Draco Malfoy walked into the room and looked around, apologizing to the teacher for his tardiness. she rolled her eyes and indicated to the empty seat next to harry that trinity usually sat in. she was skipping potions to play quidditch with ginny as she was actually on top of the workload. Draco hesitated a moment and made eye contact with Harry for a second, who was trying his hardest to look indifferent. After Draco's trial and all the shit that happened post war, his father in prison and his mother's move to France for some much needed mental rest, Harry and Draco had come to a mutual understanding- to treat each other like classmates, nothing more and nothing less. there were no more snippy comments  thrown here or witty spells flicked there. it was mutual ground to leave each other alone to complete their final years of schooling in relative peace and harmony.
Ginny grinned at the posh way he spoke and held out her hand which draco shook. She had a firm grip, tough skin, not at all the tender hands of what one would expect form a young lady.
him in such a way. He tried to think back to the memory but the boy that had once been there in the kitchen grew taller, his blackened, skin darkened, freckles faded and his eyes bloody bloomed emerald green.
Harry nodded. It was dangerous ground he was treading. He felt like perhaps humering draco had been the wrong move, perhaps he should have done his potions assignment with someone else. But he was too far into it now and his mouth was running away from him,
“His names Brenton,” Draco said, petting the cat's head fondly. Harry tore his eyes from the sand and his features softened. The corners of his mouth turned upwards slightly and draco noticed his fingers twitch, like he was stopping himself from touching the cat.
Harry looked at Draco suspiciously, standing much to the complaint of the cat, he went inside to find Luna leaving Draco on the front porch to deal with whatever problems he was having. Luna was in the lounge room studying with Ginny where Harry had left her. They were both without shirts, Harry had done an exceptional job on the heating charm, so good he had actually browned the newspaper that was nearest him when he had made it and singed his arm hairs. They were kind of suffering for the time being in the heat, waiting for it to cool down a little. Ginny, who suffered the dearest, was even sweating.
Ginny shoved past Draco gracelessly and launched herself onto Harry's back, grappling him to the ground in a tangle of limbs. Harry yelled out as ginny shoved a wet handful of moss down the back of his shirt and squirmed on the ground under her weight in distress. Luna gazed at them a little confused and walked around, continuing down the path. Ginny saw her and sprung to her feet, chasing after luna and grabbing her hand swinging it theatrically. She had wet patched down the arm of her hoodie and along the side of her leg.
Luna skipped into the greenhouse cheerfully, humming to herself a song she had had stuck in her head all week. Ginny gave her a blue flower that Harry had given Ginny in the morning, a very confusing chain of events that had led up to it being in Luna's hand. She gazed at it for a minute while her herbology teacher Pots cracked onto her for being late again. She explained that it was Monday, and Harry had left his curtain open allowing the verrigors into their home which had made her sleep really heavily. Pots had argued something ridiculous about how
Luna sighed. She looked at Harry gently, brushing off her hands on her pants to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear, "I'm sure draco is aware of that," she said, "I'm not saying you have to do anything, I just think it's good for you to be aware." She didn't wait for Harry to acknowledge her and went back to weeding, "so you don't hurt one another," harry added the word
He shook his head. These were forbidden thoughts, forbidden memories. Draco was stronger now, on his own away from his parents, away from the war and the dark lord,  far away from his past decisions and getting further with each passing day. He would not impede his progress with thoughts of such nature.
"You need a shave," Ginny told him, sucking the butter off the spoon and stirring her coffee with it. Harry cleaned out the perculator into the compost bin and ran water through it. he always needed to shave, every morning his chin was scratchy and ginny refused all kisses until he was smooth. and fair enough, he often thought her prickly unshaven legs under the sheets some nights were unbearable, so perhaps the small surface area of his chin was a small sacrifice. but a warm kiss in the morning would be nice one day.
“I resent that accusation,” draco protested, leaning forward tediously to set his glass down on the little coffee table. He flopped back half into Harry's lap and tried not to look sulky. His shoulder was pressed against something hard under Harry's sweater, he slid off his lap and reached out to touch the form through the fabric. "What's this?" He asked, forgetting the stupid show playing nonchalantly in the background.
"it used to be our thing, the three of us on the couch! i introduced you two to it!" Harry exasperatedly explained, sitting straight and looking panicked. Ginny found it hysterical in her evil little way, giving him the look that roughly translated to
“Pardon?” Harry asked, setting his mug down and wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. Harry had seen dracos glances and reddened face, he had caught him staring sure, but he wouldn't have put that down to Draco having a
"can you believe them? even luna! and she knows how much it means to me,"
Draco laughed, "so weasley
weekends were bothersome without anyone to do anything with. Draco had invested in a television at pansie's recommendation, she had one in her dorm room and rattled off a bunch of tv shows  he should be keeping up to date with. many of their letters were about said shows they enjoyed, and movies they had seen. without the tv and school work he could catch up on draco feared he might lose his mind on the weekends. there was nothing to do in the little town. there was the forest sure, far kinder than the dark forest had known at hogwarts. Draco had found a few little walking trails through the dense foliage and sometimes indulged in wandering along them, he collected potions ingredients when he came across them, sometimes even a little collection of jars had started to grow in his kitchen pantry. The little shire offered the cinema, no new movies were shown there but he enjoyed watching the repetes when home life really got to him. The market intimidated Draco a little, all the people he saw he knew knew him, could see into his darkened soul and he wasn't quite ready to face all the people. He only went there for his weekly shop, often spotting other people in his classes. There was also a small library and bookshop where he had purchased a dictionary of potions ingredients, inspired by the ferns and mushrooms he found in the forest.
there came a thumping from the main entrance making draco jump, and he recognised the sound of the brass knocker on his front door. draco towelled himself dry and rummaged through the draw for his hair jell, waiting for whoever it was to either state themselves or leave. he found the gell and slicked it through his hair, combing the sides down. he would need to get it cut again soon, it was unrule at the back.
Harry saw draco watching him and raised an eyebrow like a fool, like a bloody fool with no self awareness. His scar had begun to fade finally, the jagged edges and tendrils of a lightning strike dulling and softening into his skin finally after all these years. Hair was escaping from the band that secured most of it behind his head and danced over his cheeks with the chilly wind. Smoke curled up over his hand, held away from the cat politely, and Draco felt the urge to pluck the cat back and collect his mug and send Harry away. He fit too snugly into draco's home.
"Yeah alright," Harry grunted, rummaging in his satuel and producing a cheap copper cauldron. He walked around the counter and set it up next to Dracos, going back to his bag to find his notes.
“Sorry to barge in, I said I needed to go earlier,” she announced, glancing at Harry who was still sitting in the bottom of the bathtub under the spray of the shower. “Jeez that's hot harry, you're red,”
The bathroom was stylish and small, a sink and draw below a round mirror on the wall, a toilet wedged in the corner and a pokey bath wedged between two walls with a black stainless shower head protruding from the ceiling. A little fern hanging next to it thriving in the humidity. The room was tiled in white with a thin line of pink glass tiles running around all the walls at waist height. Harry sat on the toilet lid and squeezed his hands together, his knee jumping around. He said his list in his head, once, twice, then out loud in a whisper, and again louder. like a chant he recited his list between knee bounces over and over until his body relaxed and stilled. Harry sat up straight and rolled his shoulders. He looked at himself in the mirror and turned the tap on, washing his face and hands.  He thumbed the little tin box in his chest pocket but left it alone. in the reflection of the mirror he noticed a pile of clothes in the bathtub, soaking wet.
Ginny examined him carefully. He hated it when she did that, it was like she was trying to read  his mind. And although she didn't have half the observational divination skills as luna she almost always read him correctly. Harry tried to look fine, like he was just chilling in the bathtub under scalding water, but she wasn't having any of it.
“You better not be knotting my hair,” Ginny grumbled, turning sharply to look at harry. He smiled politely and shook his head, ash dropping onto ginny's shoulder. She brushed it off and turned away and Harry quickly raked his fingers over her scalp, marveling at the deep red colour of her curls. Luna plucked the joint from Harry's lips just before he got burnt and snuffed it out on Ginny's shoe. She had a thing against putting fire near grass, something about attracting a little gremlin creature that protects good lawns, and luna was always without shoes apart from at school where they were sort of a requirement. Even then though she wore sandals and socks, something most of the muggle born kids cringed at.
Harry grunted a word that sounded vagley like
“I know, gin, I killed him,” Harry whispered. His voice came out hoarse as his throat was tight, Harry had cried a little, thinking back to all of it. “It was just, shocking, seeing it right there in such a casual setting,” he picked at his nails and ginny reached out, holding his hands still to stop him, “makes you wonder how many other murderers have mooved on, whether there are death eaters out there, fucking i don't know, like gardening or something,” he breathed, feeling exasperated and tired.
Harry shrugged, going through his list quickly.
“I really am quite fond of his cat, we should get another one,” she hummed, then broke into a song quietly.
he thought, feeling like a bumbling idiot. What kind of question was that? But Harry didn't snicker or anything, he nodded slowly.
“Is that why you left? The mark upset you?”
part but didn't bother to say anything. Luna had been asked to move up a year in herbology, the grade below was full and she was top of the class anyway, she was doing really well at senior herbology from what Harry had heard.
"No, yes I mean, yeah we should uh," draco looked at him and their eyes met, he was very red, "we should go out."
"You find it alright?" Draco said, scraping the diced ferns into the sleeping drought with an obsidian blade. He was side eyeing Harry, who was paler than before. Harry scowled at him and picked up his notes, reading over the next step instead of responding. dracos brow furrowed and he looked away, somewhat disappointed. He had begun to feel at ease with Harry being in his home, brewing potions with him in his kitchen. perhaps he had imagined it.
Harry dusted himself off and collected their mugs. He looked at Luna for a long moment. "Thank you," he said finally, "Luna, really."
Draco pulled the little blue flower from his bag. Some of the petals were bent and it was looking very sad and droopy, but the colours were still vibrant. He still felt unsure about what to do with it, he didn't feel comfortable just throwing it outside or into the bin. A real friend, that's what luna had called draco and herself, had given it to him- maybe even passed it on to him from another possible friend. Draco hadn't felt bold enough to press further about what she had meant, but he found that he liked the thought of harry asking luna to give him a little flower. He would quite like for it to happen in person. Jordan had often slipped flowers into his pockets..
“I, uh,” draco started eloquently, “Luna, she invited me to, uh, walk with her…” draco trailed off, not really sure on the details himself. He had brought a bag in case he came across any of those late blooming roses, or other potions ingredients for that matter. It was also to carry cat treats, which he was a little embarrassed about. Draco looked down at Harry and then back away just as quickly. He was wearing a loose knitted button down cardigan which was open at the top and no shirt underneath. Draco could see down the cardi from that angle, it had caught him off guard, he took a step back. The whole predicament was doing wonders to dracos imagination, seeing Harry kneeling in front of him sent his mind reeling and he could feel his face heating up.
Harry felt himself creeping inside his skin, it was uncomfortable. The more comfortable he became with Draco the more he felt dislike for himself.
Draco actually had quite an impressive library, inheriting most of its books from the manors collection. He had written out a list of his favourite books for a house elf to pick up for him, not daring to enter the cursed building himself. so his favourite books rested proudly and relieved away from the dark literature found in the halls of his once home.
and harry would recite his list, faltering on the word albus.
Draco strolled over steadily and pulled the chair out, sliding into the seat. He turned out a parchment and a muggle fountain pen from his satchel and settled in, spinning the pen in his slender fingers.
it was annoying actually, coping harry's notes. He kept flipping between pages to try to stay on top of the work mis v was slapping on the chalkboard while allowing Malfoy to write down what he'd missed. Draco felt mildly superior with his parchment roll, he wouldn't have this problem if Harry had just stuck to good old wizard schooling equipment. but draco also found it a little.. kind, perhaps, for want of a better word, that harry was clumsily making an effort to lend a hand.
Harry was sitting on the floor with Brenton in his lap smoking another cigaroll when draco finally dared to go back outside. There was still a quarter of sand in the hourglass and he was feeling tired despite the afternoon sun. He just wanted to finish up quickly and have a sandwich and maybe a good wank and go to bed. But Harry was still there, invading his space and petting his cat, and Draco felt obliged to be at least civil. Draco offered Harry another tea which he turned down. Harry was no longer shaking or chanting, he looked content and lazy in the yellow glow and draco resented him for that, and the fond feeling he got in the pit of his stomach.
"Hello draco," she greeted him cheerfully, slipping for a moment into humming that song. Draco observed Luna almost fearfully for a second while she sang, her back to pots who were looking quite mad while also trying to hold it together and teach the rest of the class. Luna was lucky she always did well on assessments.
The two cats inspected each other, interrupted by large human hands scratching their ears and backs, and finally settled down again satisfied with their greetings. Tybalt was eyeing harry sceptically, looking slightly betrayed that he was allowing an intruding cat onto his lap. Harry knew he was going to suffer for it later. In fact he felt like he was suffering for it now. The way draco was watching him felt like an accusation in the waiting/. It was quite discerning. Being observed like that. Like it was Harry being inspected for oh&s and not the house.
He figured she would take him through the forest, or maybe down to the market, was it a date? No, it couldn't be, perhaps she thought they were friends. They were certainly friend
"skip potions with me later?'' The water was scalding when ginny turned the tap on to rinse out her mug and she dropped it in the sink, shattering. a swear word slipped out and she went hunting for her wand.
Draco looked almost smug, "once or twice, the atmosphere's quite welcoming."
"I didn't think you knew anything muggle,"
Harry reached down his top and pulled at the chain around his neck, presenting a coiled snake carved out of some sort of white material. "It's a bassisk carved out of one's tooth," he grinned, turning it around this way and that, "pretty cool ay?"
amount of hungry," Draco parroted,  filling the bowls to what he'd consider a regular amount. What kind of measurement was that anyway. Draco fished out a pair of spoons from the draw, borgons brandy caught his eye sitting on the counter top nearby. He supposed that might help move the night along.
"carry on," harry shuffled his papers and coughed into his fist, giving a short nod. he scribbled down the rest of seans notes quickly into his book. he's had enough of parchment scrolls and quills, it had been fun at hogwarts but the innocent magic and impracticality of such a practice had surpassed him along his journey and he had bought muggle lined paper and ballpoint pens to use for his final catchup years of study. Many kids had chosen extended years, like Harry, running a more advanced and in depth seventh year over a two year period. They were almost finished with the first year having started the final term, and Harry was looking forward to the holidays the same way he had begun to look forward to weekends.
Draco laughed nervously, not sure if they had reached the point of beig able to joke about the past quite yet. But he appreciated her effort at normalizing him. Harry peeled himself from the couch, setting the empty mug he had been cradling down on the coffee table.
“I left my wand at home, we’ll just walk,” Harry shrugged, allowing Ginny to pull him to his feet. She pecked him on the cheek and took Luna's hand, disappearing with a crack. Harry looked at draco, still sitting on the ground relaxing into the sensation of being high. Harry had almost asked him to aparate them to the end of the trail, but on second thoughts that probably wasn't the best idea. He nudged draco with the toe of his boot gently and picked his bag up, slinging it over his shoulder. “Come on.”
It was actually pretty
"i'm gonna go shower, last chance for the toilet,"
. But he took too long thinking and Harry had come to his senses, a clarity sliding over his eyes, and he snuffed the cigaroll out on his boot. Draco thought it was a very considerate action, a lesser man would have risked scorching the wood slats of the floor. He watched Harry slide the half smoked roll back into the tin where it fit loosely next to several others, and sat down on a chair. It had been a close call.
“im gonna head off to bed,” she said, twisting to crack her back.
Merlin he felt disgusted with himself, he felt dirty and stupid and pathetically alight with sensation. Like a cat in heat he rolled over and rutted against the soft sheets on his bed. Half suffocating with his face pressed into his pillow draco came onto them with a muffled groan, twitching against the fabric.
. He felt motivated, Draco thought he might book a port key to Thailand, hang around pansy for a while, go out for sneaky drinks like the old days. He thought of flying to Australia on a muggle plane, making a real
Draco looked up and held both his hands out for Harry to pull him to his feet. He wobbled, gripping harrys hands tightly for a second, he felt light and dangerously relaxed. Like he could say something he shouldn't say, or do something he would regret later. Like he could lean into potter and press his forehead to Harry's chest, the material was cold and damp.
"picking at your nails, youll go blind that's what mum always says." the water ran through a hole in the bottom of the mug where a piece of it had fallen into the drain. ginny cursed the thing and threw it into the bin with malice.
“No,” Draco’s voice sounded small and feeble to Ron, so contrasting to his burst of rage a few moments ago, and he couldn’t help but overcome with sympathy for the scared and emotionally scarred man sitting across him.
Before she closed the door shut, she waved a hand to end the transfiguration charm. All the chairs turned back into what they once were and clattered onto the floor.
“Fine! Tell him that I need to live and in order to do that, I need money, which I do not frigging have!” he screamed at the Floo Hermione and wished his voice was loud enough to reach the ears of his deranged husband on the other side.
"What? No! Why would I want to kill myself?! You shut your frigging mouth!" Draco sneered at the mirror-Draco, his entire body trembling in sheer anger and revulsion, but the one in the mirror only laughed like Draco's reaction was the funniest thing ever. The bud he held between his fingers fell into the washbasin and Draco held onto the counter's edges tightly so that his body would not crumple to the floor.
"Then I'll wear that hideous sweater too," Draco snorted indignantly.
“No one else,” he replied with an air of finality.
“Harry, let me side step here for a bit okay? Since there is no point in beating about the bush, I will ask you directly. Why do you
“Why did you marry Malfoy?”
“What does Flying mean to you, Harry?”
His owl flew into the kitchen and perched on his stomach, pecking at his chest, as if asking if he was alright. Though it was a bit painful, he brought his hand and ruffled the bird's feathers in a gesture of mutual comfort.
The moment you walked into my life.
“Why?”
one, if you’ve conveniently forgotten,” he rolled his eyes and took the chance to scan her attire. Ginny was dressed in a skin-fit neon orange top with off-shoulder sleeves and equally skin-fit black jeans.
“How dare you insinuate that I killed them! How (punch) fricking (punch) dare (punch) you (punch)!” Harry stood there, not moving an inch now that he anticipated Draco’s hits. Given the blonde’s physical condition, his punches lacked strength to them but they sure left a searing pain in Harry’s face and Draco’s knuckles.
“Thank you, Healer,” Harry tried smiling but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“If you are not inclined to talk, as you so boldly stated before and after having sex with me, then fine,” Draco turned away from Harry. Frankly, the reason didn’t matter to him because he was now a free man if he ignored the fact that he was still in hiding because he feared the public’s wrath if he ever dropped by The Leaky for a good old drink.
"However the child had been conceived, Draco, it's not the baby's fault. You can't punish it for something it hasn't done," Hermione reasoned but Draco wasn't listening. He didn't want the baby. Period. Even if Harry chose the baby, he would get it aborted. Harry could go and find someone else to carry his seed. He wasn't a baby-making machine and he wasn't going to give birth to one. At least not without his consent or knowledge.
He stood in the center with arms crossed across his chest, staring down at an emaciated Malfoy, who was clad in a tattered dusty damp one-piece and was resting on the equally dirty ground; his eyes on Harry.
“We’re going out and that’s final,” she declared as she surprisingly pulled Draco by his wrist and led them to his bedroom.
The merry bustling stopped and all eyes and ears were fixed on Hermione.
Harry’s responses were steadily shocking Draco. He wasn’t calm all the time but he sure was better than before. No snapping at irregular intervals, or hitting, or forcing Draco to admit things he didn’t want to say out loud. It was a strange feeling and Draco liked it. No, he could never forgive Harry for all the crap his husband put him through. Then again, Draco wasn’t innocent either. If Harry chose to lock away Draco deeds and forgive him for the past and the Mark on his arm, then Draco supposed he must be willing to let go of things too. The only problem was that he didn’t know if he could let go.
“Haven’t had the opportunity. Working at the Ministry as an Auror takes up a huge chunk of my time,” replied Harry.
Unlike Harry, Draco didn’t favor drinking blood so he pressed the pad of his thumb into Harry’s fresh wound and played with it, causing more than required blood to slip out of the folds. Surprisingly, Harry seemed to like it even though tears slipped past his closed eyes. The image he made was utterly debauching and without another prompt, Draco cut a second line on Harry’s waist.
Without another word transpiring between them, Harry got onto the bed, his knees bracketing Draco's sitting form. He caressed Draco's cheeks before placing one of his palms on Draco's nape and leaving the other on his cheek. Time stopped for both of them as their faces titled slightly before fitting their lips together in a perfect embrace. It was just a touch at first. Then Harry pressed their lips together a tad bit harder and Draco's tongue swiped across Harry's bottom lip, asking for permission. At that point, Harry would give anything to Draco and he parted his lips, allowing Draco inside, letting him explore the deepest parts of his mouth. A shiver ran through their bodies when their tongues touched and Harry moved his body impossibly closer to Draco's, knees lifted to their tallest as he towered over the sitting blonde. His fingers fisted Draco's hair as he pushed the man's neck as far as it would bend back without any strain before plunging his tongue down Draco's throat. Draco's arms slid down his shoulders to rest at his waist and Harry could foresee the bruises his skin at the waist would sport due to Draco's unforgiving grip.
“As far as charges are concerned, there won’t be any. This is a familial issue and I choose to not make it legal or public. As his husband, I will be the one to deal with whatever happened. The End,” Harry concluded. The anger that sparked inside him wouldn’t die down. The reporters’ quills and questions only added fuel to the fire raging inside of him and he craved a strong drink to quell it. It was taking so much effort on his part to reign in his magic which wanted a target to let its wrath out on.
He wondered if he could ever be free. Potter's house was just a homely jail because Draco never went anywhere as he couldn't visit the Wizarding World alone for fear of being attacked and Potter never took him anywhere. He stayed cooped up in this place just like he did in Azkaban. The only difference was that he didn't choose Azkaban but chose Potter yet it didn't change the fact that he had to live with what he had and make the most of it despite his disdain. The one thing the war had taught him was to adjust and compromise. That mighty horse of his had long been dead and it wouldn't come back ever for him to mount. Draco often felt bored staying in Potter's place which was devoid of books. DVDs could only be interesting for a while. So he started cooking and by following the culinary reality shows he found in the idiot box, Draco somehow miraculously cooked a proper meal. He felt so relieved, like all his stress melted away like a glacier under the warm Sun. The upside he didn't ask for was Harry's approval to the food he prepared. He could still remember how his heart filled like a balloon when Harry complimented him for the food. Maybe he was exaggerating what he felt but it had been years since he heard someone praise him and he loved to be pampered. He felt like a boy once again. Smiling and thinking that he could endure living in Potter's jail, after all, Draco's eyelids fell shut like an iron door.
“How?” he gritted out in barely contained fury.
Ron and Hermione nodded at Harry and squeezed his shoulder in support. Harry was itching to go in and demand the Healer to keep him noted of Draco’s condition but he knew that it was useless. If he made a ruckus, he’d be thrown out of the hospital altogether and that wouldn’t do. He begged for Draco and their baby to be okay and hoped that his good intentions reached into Draco’s unconscious heart.
"Where the heck have you been, Potter?" Draco growled.
“I prefer relaxing at home on my off days. Besides, I don't have many of them. As the Savior, I'm supposed to be fighting
"Shall we proceed, Harry?" he asked.
Really? It wasn’t a hex? Was it merely an illusion?
“We thought you were getting better! What the hell were you thinking, Harry?” he heard Hermione’s shrill voice as soon as he opened the door.
It didn’t matter Harry had come back to him for a
He kept repeating that phrase continually, ignoring the other wizards and witches glaring at him. If looks could kill, he’d be buried ash. As he passed by a couple who were huddled together – the man vomiting what looked like glitter rather fervently, given his state, into a tub-sized bucket and the black haired woman who looked pregnant, vanishing the lurid contents with a swish of her wand; he heard the woman whisper into the man’s ears, ‘… so cruel to even kill a baby!’ and covered her own belly in fright when Draco looked at her unwittingly.
"No, it is a word weasley," draco argued, "do you own a dictionary? Surely one of these books.." he started picking them up from the piles Harry left scattered around the house, examining the spines theatrically. Harry grimaced, many of the ones in that room were cooking books. He felt that was an old lady thing, a Molly Weasley thing, not a teenage-boy-hero-of-the-wizarding-world thing. draco perked up at a glossy muggle  magazine, flipping through a few pages and forgetting what he was doing for a moment. Harry and Ginny exchanged a glance.
"Is there any leftover?" Harry asked, dodging the question. Luna caught his eye, sitting on the floor with the cat on her lap behind the couch. She was wide eyed, shaking her head adamantly.
Harry was watching draco as he thought, the little furrow between his brows as he considered something in his head. Draco was subjectively attractive harry thought, he was pale and smooth and sure, maybe a little pointy. Draco had slim, almost geometrical hands, hands you would see playing music, like piano or guitar. Harry considered that for a moment, trying to imagine draco sitting down and relaxing into a song. It was a forign image to him, a scenario he would never have put Draco in back at hogwarts. But here, in their little clearing in Scotland where draco was almost a different person, he could see it. Their eyes caught for a moment, and in the dwindling light Harry saw dracos cheeks reden. He held out the joint to draco and for a moment the blond hesitated, then took it between his slender fingers and brought it to his lips. Harry watched him breathe in and blow out a cloud of smoke. He could see why girls had swooned over him at hogwarts.
Tybalt, originally Ginny's cat that had adopted Harry and Luna as secondary owners, slunk out from under the curtain where it had been sleeping. The windows were cool, the poor tabby cat didn't really approve of hot environments. It sulked its way under ginny's homework onto her lap  and pawed her thighs, settling down. The cat had sensed dracos chubby white feline, Tybalt didn't really warm to others of his species, but the white cat jumped onto Harry's lap like he owned that seet.
Jordan was waiting for him in the library. He had a spare period and dracos divination  professor was I'll with dragon pocks. There were a few students studying quietly between the rows of bookshelves but it was otherwise empty for a friday third period. Draco and jordans prefered spot was on the outskirts of the shelves, the dimmer part of the library that held books on advanced gardening spells and other useless junk school students weren't  interested in. There was a small table against the cool stone wall and a torch bracket nestled above it, although it didn't contain a torch anymore. Jordan did a good lumos charm, producing warm gentle light that shone for ages. Draco sat down next to him, bumping his knee against jordans. He placed his bag on the ground leaning against the table leg and pulled out his divination book and a roll of parchment. Jordans hands were hot, he'd been scribbling away at some charm assignment, when he cupped dracos chin and pulled him in for a kiss. Their lips met gently, slotting together, and draco sank into it like a bee in honey.
“ill walk you to the apparition point,” he said. Thinking better of the mug, harry picked it up and walked it over to the sink in the kitchen where he quickly rinsed it out. Draco waited for him at the front door slipping into his coat and slinging his bag over his shoulder. He handed harry his jacket and they stepped outside, the door closing with a soft click behind them.
The flower looked nice on his windowsill lapping up the afternoon sun.
“Sometimes,” he shrugged, “they go well in a nice brandy.”
“Lunas already beat you to that,” Harry muttered, nudging her with his boot. Luna stirred and peeled her eyelids open, looking up at him with big pale eyes. “Side along with Ginny home,” Harry told her, glancing at the ominous clouds gathering in the sky beyond the clearing, “it'll rain on the walk back, might as well apparate.”
"do you need the notes?' Harry asked, flipping his page over to the theory mis v had already wiped off the board. draco looked across at him a little startled and confused. there were other empty seats in the room, but he had sat down where he was told to avoid any possible conflict. mis v didn't seem to like draco very much, he sensed it was his past that she disapproved of, and fair enough he thought. he also had not wanted to look on bad terms with harry potter, the boy who lived, the saviour, it would only serve to further damage his tarnished image. it was simply easier to take the seat next to him and hope for the best. Draco looked across at Harry's notes, neat scrawl poorly organised and rushed though they were, he tried a thin smile and thanked Harry and started copying the text down.
Harry coughed and raised an eyebrow at her, considering his answer carefully. Luna had heart enough to ask about even Voldemort's health. "He seems lonely," Harry mused, looking to the back door as Ginny stomped her way outside, clearly frustrated beyond belief at her homework. She threw herself onto the grass in front of Harry and wiggled her fingers at him. Harry slid his hand into hers and squeezed it, but she slapped him away.
Dracos stomach flipped as he recognised the feeling of attraction. He shook the cat off his lap and stood up suddenly, declaring something about checking on the potions. He closed the door gently behind him, not wanting to come off as irritated, and went to the bathroom. His wet clothes were still in the tub, he thumbed his forehead in frustration and embarrassment and threw them into the laundry room and went to stand over the potions. Draco would not be attracted to Harry potter. But he could already feel strong arms wrap around his waist and pull him back into a firm body, he could feel warm breath on the back of his neck and stubble graze his jaw, soft lips on his cheek. He was thrown back to sixth year, the little fling he had had with jordan, the soft hufflepuff boy who had seen right through him and held him regardless, had kept their secrets and indulged draco in a kindness he hadn't deserved, and whom had left humbly and with understanding when draco had lashed out fearfully.
for him. It would complicate everything, and he really didn't want
"You got your potions done then? All up to date?" She passed him the joint and tied the front of her cardigon up waiting patiently for Harry to answer. Harry watched the rolled bud smoulder and go cold in his fingers for a minute, nodding absently. He lit it again and breathed in deeply, grinning at Luna who asked suddenly "how is draco?"
“I’m sorry I had to wake you,” Harry apologized as he sat down close to Draco even though he could’ve maintained enough space between them.
“What? I’m not sending you back to Azkaban!” Harry exclaimed in a hurry.
"Like it's been broken bad and fitted together rather poorly."
“Answer me, Draco!” Harry yelled and watched as Draco screwed his face and eyes shut and a few tears escaped his eyes. That was when Harry realized and confirmed that he turned Draco into a depressive suicidal maniac who wasn’t quite there but would be if left alone.
“So was I, you imbecile,” Draco sighed.
"Harry?" Hermione called and he ran straight into her arms, crying into her shoulder.
'Sure,' I replied and fought against the urge to ask her about you. The longer she lingered like a puppy at my doorstep; I realized that the danger of me asking about you is over the threshold of my self-control.
“So, have you flown?” she asked, diving straight into the topic Harry hoped she’d forget.
Draco scoffed. “You need me to spread my legs for you so that you can impregnate me with your seed and those potions behind my back,” Draco stated coolly.
“I am deeply compelled to kick you out and ward the house and the Floo connection against you, Weasley,” Draco hissed angrily.
“I’m sincerely working on that with my Healer,” Harry replied. “And I want to introduce you to her,” he added.
"So bite me, Potter, and mark me yours. Please," Draco begged, his hands fisting the pillow under his head tightly to cant his hips upwards properly and match Harry's unforgiving tempo. Harry was more than happy to give his husband a bright red love bite at the juncture where his neck and his shoulder met. Oh, it would be visible to the entire world and Harry gloated in pride at that knowledge.
"That's because I didn't."
It was fast but it never blurred in my memories. I ripped open your uniform that day and exactly four buttons flew in different directions. I shut your protests with another bruising kiss and it was the cue you, my dear, needed to shuck off the rest of your clothes and mine and push me down onto the soft mattress. Your eyes and your touches clearly told me that you were the leader and I let you lead me into a fiery rapture filled with screams of pain and moans of pleasure.
“It doesn’t change the way you or the others treat me,” Draco clarified and for once, Harry was left dumbfounded; his thumb feeling the textures of the scratches and burn marks left behind by their owner, until his eyes caught the two wedding rings and he smiled wistfully.
“Hold up a second! What? Woman, let me go!” Draco tried shaking off her hand but her grip was unforgiving. All the Quidditch muscle she had was being put to good use as she dragged him around like he was merely a tiny toddler. And she did let go after they reached Draco’s bedroom. He didn’t even want to ask her how she knew the room. It would be pointless.
“I don’t mean that, huh? Let me show you HOW truly I meant what I said, Draco,” Harry caught Draco’s left wrist in a punishing grip and yanked it towards him from where it lay on Draco’s lap so that Draco’s dark mark was visible to both of them.
Draco found himself tumbling into a rather clean alley that had dust piled up neatly to one corner in a large rectangular green bin with a lid. Harry caught him before he could fall face-first into the ground.
“You can after you’re completely healed.”
“Good. It’ll make your Healing process smooth when you are true to yourself. And to me. You have to be honest and open with everything, Mr. Potter. In a way, I need to see your mind laid out bare for me to heal you. Are you following me?”
"What's wrong with you?!" Draco's voice broke and Hermione's grip of Draco's hand tightened reflexively at his outburst.
. Usually, I don't prefer song lyrics as titles to my stories but this one felt apter than any other title I could come up with for this particular chapter.
“Oh, yes! Hideous, actually!” Draco commented as he produced two knitted sweaters from under the sofa. Only this time, Harry and Draco received Couple sweaters. They were Gryffindor red with their initials ‘HD’ knitted in the center in silver thread. The cuffs were also the same shade of silver and it was amusing to Harry. He often used to wonder what kind of couple sweater Molly would make once he married Ginny. When Ron and Hermione married two years ago, they received orange sweaters, Ron’s favorite color, with their initials knitted in royal blue, Hermione’s favorite color. They looked ghastly once worn. Harry couldn’t stop laughing after Molly left the room and for the first time in a long time, he felt free as his best friends laughed along with him without any barriers or inhibitions.
"I'll be going with you to the Weasleys this weekend," Draco announced the next morning as Harry was getting ready to go the Ministry, grumbling like an old man about his work hours.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can hardly trust you on that,” Draco said, not wanting to comment on Harry's admission to have a baby with him. The thought of it scared him.
"Good morning," Harry greeted with a toothy smile when Draco opened his eyes.
They were beyond exhausted when they came back home. What was supposed to be an hour of shopping had dragged on for almost four hours. By then their stomachs growled and complained loudly, hence they had to eat outside at a minor establishment which Draco liked inwardly but never voiced aloud.
"No," this time, Draco wasn't so confident.
Harry and Draco TALK, actually, in the next chapter and is a continuation from where we leave off here.
Sneering at his husband through tears of shame, Draco snatched his hand back and wiped the vile spit away using the blanket.
“So you think it is necessary to hit Draco. Why?”
"They're a couple now and I need input for my products so that I can sell them for profit. Two birds with one stone. Right, Harry, Draco?" he winked at them again.
Today, as he found himself plastered to the rough wall of their kitchen with Harry’s arm digging into his back, his entirety looming over Draco angrily, he reckoned, was Harry’s day of dementia. Draco grunted in pain at the impact and was sure that the wall left a few scratches on his right cheek.
“You know nothing,” Draco insisted.
“My parents died protecting me. They were heroes who stood against Voldemort. Draco’s parents can’t even compare. They didn’t die protecting their spawn. Instead, death was their punishment. Liberation from all the crimes they’d committed, all the people they tortured and killed. I believe that they deserved what they got. As far as Draco is concerned, I married him because I wanted to. Really,” he frowned pensively, not believing his own words.
“I bet you are,” Harry’s eyes crinkled playfully when he smiled at Draco.
“Should never have chosen you,” he whispered as silent tears flowed out of his eyes singly, dropping down soundlessly onto the upholstery.
“You tell me,” Arya seemed unfazed by Harry’s reaction.
Draco smiled wistfully. “Let’s leave that to another day, shall we?”
- implied self-harm
"It's not my place to tell Harry. I'm not going to be that bridge for either of you," Ron said and for a moment, Draco wondered if the ginger-head had read his mind after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
It's been seven months since the incident and still, the broken corners of my heart make me bleed rivers. I don't cry for you anymore. I suppose it is hard to manufacture tears when all I want to do is bleed red. I go to the job I got for you and work till my body says it can take no more. I go out with my muggle friends and party till the night is up and then go back to work like I slept the night before. I haven't heard from you but two months after you last stepped into my life, Granger paid me a visit. She was just returning all the gifts I gave you and it clenched my heart so painfully that I had to take a minute or two to compose myself and not breakdown in front of your friend. I still had my pride and it might let me grovel like the pathetic idiot I am for you but certainly not in front of your friends or anyone else for that matter. Like a gracious guest, she inquired me if I was doing well. If she had eyes, she'd have known that I was anything but okay. I chose not to answer her and thanked her for my things.
Harry inhaled sharply. Draco was so wrong about them and he would prove it one day. He would go back for now, let himself be healed and come back for the one who he broke and pick up all their pieces so that whatever was lost between them could be rebuilt again beautifully.
His hand stilled in its journey towards Ginny’s sundae at the sudden influx of information. Did she really need to bring Harry up? Then again, he supposed, it didn’t do him any harm. When it settled down in the back of his mind, Draco resumed his journey towards the sundae for another spoon but was denied as Ginny took it out of his reach.
“Not particularly,” Harry was racking his brains to find an excuse but came up with none. Why had he stopped flying? Was there really a reason for it? He liked it since forever, didn’t he? Then, why?
'Draco, wait,' you tried to talk to me.
The room burst into laughter once again except for Ronald, who fumed in embarrassment rather than in anger.
'If you need anything, Draco, you can call me. This is my mobile number,' she gave me a card and I took it although all I wanted to do was shut the door in her face and have a look at all the things of mine you returned.
"Ssh, Malfoy. Struggling won't do you any good. Stay still and I might just take pity on you," Harry smirked as he sat down over Draco, who was on his back on the floor, looking up at Harry with terrified eyes. Only this time, Draco knew that Harry wasn’t going to assault him sexually as he did months ago. This was to be Harry’s physical wrath thundering down on Draco.
"No, I'm not. Did you know that I almost pissed my pants when I faced Voldemort before killing him? I'm not strong. I never was," Draco could feel Harry's tears wetting his nape and the shirt around his shoulders.
he was still willing to be where he was. It’s not like he was
“It won’t work,” Draco said instead. “You, me, we will never work, Harry. Just send me back to Azkaban or wherever. That is where I truly belong,” he confessed.
Why couldn’t Draco understand that he was extremely sorry? Harry was trying to make things right, at least a bit and with Draco being uncooperative, he was only losing his temper like a child. He started counting his breaths and following Draco’s breathing pattern to calm his nerves down. When he was sure that his anger wouldn’t cloud their conversation, he opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a face peeking not so subtly into their room.
you are here, for ‘Mione or for me but save the rest for when we get home. I don’t want to spoil this for Hermione.” Saying his piece, Harry gave no attention to Draco anymore for he worried that he might snap if they continued further. Whatever needs to be said will be said at the right time and at the right place. Home. Not in public. Certainly not when Hermione, his best friend since childhood, is struggling with her life in order to deliver her baby.
"You deserve NOTHING, Malfoy. Except for this hellhole, of course. But here I am giving you a second chance. A frigging chance at life and you are asking me questions like a rude little prick," his hand skated towards Malfoy's dirty matted mop of hair, his fingers gently feeling the texture of it.
"Okay," Ron agreed after a long pause. "Okay," Hermione echoed, albeit with great reluctance.
That is how Draco found himself the next day on his Manor grounds, outside its gate, with a pack of Marlboro coupled with a lighter in the pocket of his trousers. He knew nothing about cigarettes except that smoking them helped with emotions and forgetfulness. That was all he needed. To not feel a damn thing. Hence, soon as he woke up, he put on some clothes and ran a hand through his bed hair, picked up some muggle change he found in Harry's now nearly empty wardrobe and apparated to muggle London, now that he could thankfully without requiring help from one non-existent Harry-sodding-Potter. Taking up the shopkeeper's suggestion that Marlboro leaves a better aftertaste than Camel, he purchased a pack and went home. The one he grew up in and not currently lived in. The Malfoy Manor which now is The Potter Manor.
“I can’t believe it, mate! After all these months… I am a father now!” Ron squealed. “My baby girl; you should see her, Harry. She’s the prettiest thing I’ve ever laid my eyes on. I feel like I’m over the clouds,” Ron’s toothy smile could rival the Sunlight. His face and his teary eyes shone brightly under the dim light of St Mungo’s.
“You didn’t write back to me or contact me after I sent you the letter with my ring,” Harry started and impulsively, Draco hid his left hand under his right elbow so that Harry wouldn’t notice two rings sitting on his finger of promises.
Instead of answering his question, Ginny clucked her tongue rather comically. “Harry never took you anywhere, did he? God, he’s such a shitty person!” she gritted through her teeth, throwing her hair back.
“I am merely rephrasing what you are telling me, Harry.”
"Why me?" Malfoy was giving in and Harry could sense it.
They must’ve done it knowingly, he surmised. He dared not lift his eyes for he feared the eyes of everyone else on him. As if on cue, he couldn’t breathe properly. Somebody must’ve cast a spell on him which obstructed him from breathing. He needed his wand to throw a counter spell; one that could make him breathe again. But as his hand hovered over his wand which was sitting inside a pocket in his robes, he couldn't make the final move to take it out. What if they thought he was about to attack them when all he wanted was to save himself? So he dropped the idea and his hand at the same time. If this continued, he would choke on non-existent air and die right there on the street. Would it be better?
“I’m trying, okay? You know it,” Harry stressed once again.
“I’m sorry,” he said sheepishly.
"I do. Still, only those would suit your face," Draco shrugged.
Alone yet again, Draco’s body finally realized that it was still haunted by the flu and collapsed on the sofa weakly. For the first time in a very long while, Draco slept dreamlessly.
“Don’t sweat it, Granger. I don’t need your pity or your apology. You can leave after finishing your coffee. Good day,” he wished before exiting the room, ignoring Hermione’s protests.
Just like that, Draco stopped talking anymore. He threw that invisible boulder of crap atop Harry’s head and sought nothing else. The way his back arched was simply screaming resignation. Like ivy, wild fury crept through his every vein, strangling him. It was getting difficult to breathe or to see. If he parted his lips to speak, Harry was afraid that no one around him would appreciate the litany of curses he would spew. But he had to say something. His silence would only mean he’s agreeing to whatever balderdash Draco built and voiced about their situation. How a mere span of hardly forty or fifty minutes could change his enraging husband to a bereft one, Harry couldn’t understand.
“But what if it doesn’t and I lose control?!” Harry exclaimed in horror.
sorry for ever saying that to you,” Harry apologized and soundly kissed Draco’s knuckles before catching the blonde’s stunned gaze.
"No, you can't," Harry shook his head, perfectly aware of what Draco would be asking of him the very next second.
“I can’t help it, okay? Since I cannot smoke, I can only do this,” Draco said albeit moving his hand away from his Mark.
Noises filtered in through the closed door but he couldn’t make out what they were speaking.
When Draco didn't reply or turn towards him, Harry nudged Draco's nape with his nose asking and demanding attention from his husband. On the other side, Draco was smiling so hard that he supposed he could cut diamonds with it but made no move to acknowledge his drunken husband.
"Thank you," Draco echoed Harry's gesture.
Draco’s eyes shone silver even in the partially lit room and Harry got lost in their intensity. He missed this closeness with Draco. His hands found Draco’s waist and squeezed hard. Harry knew that a conversation between them was long overdue and that was the reason why he chose to drop by and set things right between them – as right as they would get, given their states of mind. But with Draco so close to him, the lust he subdued came back to the front in full force. No man or woman could replace the way Draco felt in his hands, so supple, so compliant, so fierce, yet at the same time offering his entire being for Harry to take in.
“Please?” Harry asked again.
Harry inhaled deeply as if preparing himself for a battle. “I came here for you. Again. I was worried about you after your panic attack.”
"I'm sorry. Draco miscarried," the Healer replied.
“If you want me, you know where to find me. The Floo will always be open for you and I will always be waiting on the other side,” Harry desperately wanted to cry or hit something just so he could take the invisible weight off of himself. “Take care, Draco,” he said heavily before leaving the room.
'Are you sure you're okay? You don't look so good,' she just had to turn around and ask me that!
“That is not the right way to get him talk to you, Harry. You need to be there in person,” she chided gently.
“You can’t promise, can you?” Draco stressed.
“They’ll be great once you wear them,” Harry didn’t look up at Draco when he said that. He was feeling the woolen sweater between his fingers and was awash with a feeling of loneliness. He really missed the Weasleys.
“You’re welcome. Still though, a wrong doesn’t make another wrong right. If you know what I mean,” she continued softly.
"He is pregnant. And he drank three bottles of alcohol. He’s not waking up," Harry answered to the best of his abilities.
"Renervate," she whispered and after a couple of seconds, Harry opened his eyes to blurry figures. Draco instinctively handed Harry glasses to him, which he carefully placed on the bedside table before sleeping.
“Draco, please, stay,” Harry took Draco’s right palm in his’ but he pulled away from Harry’s touch as if singed by fire.
Ron immediately got up and stood in between Harry and Draco, blocking their view from each other as he tried to usher his friend out of his own house.
cathartic in any way.  I don’t even understand why I agreed to come out with you in the first place,” Draco groaned.
“You could’ve thrown me back in,” Draco stated as a matter of fact.
“I don’t?” Harry drew back and paced the room with a prominent frown on his face which looked like he was thinking hard.
“I’ll make sure you lose your OTHER virginity too, Harry,” Draco bent forward and squeezed Harry’s butt.
"Will you laugh at me if I say that I am scared of the Voldemort I see in my dreams, Draco?" Harry asked.
“Yeah, okay,” Draco agreed. Ron was being sensible and Draco couldn’t deny any of it.
“Yeah. I asked for the Potion, didn’t I?”
“You have to, ‘Mione. One step at a time, okay? Careful, lean on me. Yes, just like that,” Harry groaned shortly when Hermione finally got up and put her entire weight on his left side. Holding her up seemed to be an excessively hard task but he wasn’t going to let go of her. They just needed to get to the hospital and she’d be alright. Besides, where the heck was Ron?!
“Like what?” Draco asked, feebly defiant.
“What do you mean why? You suffer from nightmares almost every single day and I cannot predict when you will hit me and when you will kiss me. I feel extremely tempted to say that you need help, Potter, and it would be better if you see a professional regarding this instead of holding on to me. You’re only getting worse,” Draco huffed out, crossing his arms across his chest and wincing at the action.
“No one is a saint, Draco. The only issue here is that your sins are far greater than theirs so they think that they have the right to judge you,” Ginny said.
“I’m scared,” he heard Harry’s muffled voice as the man awkwardly half-climbed into Draco’s lap like a child for comfort.
The silence that surrounded them was heavenly to Draco as they lay stuck together, one crying silent tears, the other trying to hold on to both of them.
“What got your knickers in a twist so early in the morning?” Ginny asked.
"No buts, Ronald! For God's sake, you're about to be a Father and is this what you'll teach your kids?!" she bellowed.
Thank you so much for all the Kudos!
“Don’t rub it in my face!” Leave it to Harry to concentrate on the most unimportant lines ever.
"It has never been an issue until now!" Dean continued in a heightened tone and tempo.
“What? Why?!” Harry asked incredulously.
“Soon. After you get better. He’s well, by the way. Now, how are you?” she repeated.
His mind provided him with images of a bloody Draco writhing underneath him, not in pleasure but extreme pain. His ears echoed with Draco’s screams and pleas for Harry to stop beating him to death. His palms burned with the reminder of Draco’s neck clenched between them in a choking grip.
“How’s your bum, by the way?” Harry asked nonchalantly, eliciting an indignant gasp from the blonde.
When Harry didn't answer, Draco continued poking his husband. "Who were you with?" Draco asked even before he could contemplate what that question might imply or sound like. Harry reacted then as he turned his head to face Draco before smirking wide.
“You’re smoking,” he stated the obvious.
"What's wrong, 'Mione?" Harry asked worriedly, exchanging a similar glance with Ron.
~ Wheezy
“What happened?” he asked though he remembered every bit of his breakdown. He graciously accepted the glass of water Harry gave and gulped it down immediately. His throat was beyond parched and he wished for another glass of water.
“Hm, then you should’ve chosen The Dementor’s Kiss instead of me,” Harry’s fingers dug into Malfoy’s cheekbones; their faces merely inches away.
A plethora of emotions closed in on his heart yet again upon taking in the lifeless eyes directed at him. Never in his life did Ron imagine that there would come a day when he would be compelled to help a Malfoy live. A voice that sounded like Harry’s in the back of his mind reminded him gently that the person in front of him was not a Malfoy anymore and Ron shook his head slightly to overthrow the voice.
But tomorrow would come. He would wake up, visit St. Mungo's, and get rid of the mistake growing in his stomach. Yes, he would do that. For now, all he wanted was to forget what his life had become.
Thank you so much for all the Kudos!
This new feeling of emptiness was liberating to him. A year after walking out, Ginny came back but by then Harry was so far off the reservation that they couldn’t stay in each other’s presence for more than a few minutes. Harry’s silence and dispassion for basically everything built a permanent wall between them and long before Harry realized, he was once again left alone in his flat which was devoid of all the things Ginny once owned. They never spoke of it and remained on good terms since.
If only he could escape this prison too, just like he did Azkaban. Yet, he was pretty sure that there was no escape. He was terrified to go out into the Wizarding World. Once people knew he was out in the open, not as Harry’s husband but as a free man, an escapee, he would be torn to bits. He was now the branded murderer of Harry Potter's child. There was no way he could live for a second if he ever went out into the Wizarding suburbs. And, he didn’t even want his thoughts to stray towards making a life for himself in Muggle London. It wouldn’t work. He didn’t know anything there except the one convenience store he visited previously for his Lights, the one Harry had taken him to a long while back. Draco had no idea how to go from there. The realization that he was probably stuck where he was, for the rest of his life, brought hot tears to his eyes which he adamantly refused to shed.
Harry leaned down and pressed a wet kiss on Draco's forehead before thanking him for his thoughtful gift. He'd been meaning to change his frames as they were more than two decades old; close to three decades in a couple of years. They had been broken many times and he always got them fixed and sized according to his face instead of purchasing new ones. Now that he got new ones, he wanted to get them fixed with lens soon so that he could flaunt them with pride.
For it is too filled with thorns.
“Draco, believe me when I say that I want to get better and be there for you. I want you to get better too,” Harry said, his eyes never leaving the burn marks. “Please,” he made sure to look straight into Draco’s eyes before saying, “give me another chance.”
“What the hell have you become, Draco?” Harry asked exasperatedly but making no move to close the distance between them despite there only being a foot or two apart from each other.
“Get out, now!” he was now extremely angry but Ginny didn’t seem to be fazed by it.
, Harry finally understood what Hermione meant.
“I know you are trying but I can only take so much of you for so long, Potter,” Draco said resignedly in a soft voice as he allowed himself to melt in Harry’s embrace.
“Please, ‘Mione, give him more credit than that. You asked him to go and talk to Malfoy. So, he went. He’s getting better and you know it,” Ron gathered her in his arms and rubbed soothing circles between her shoulder blades in an attempt to comfort her.
“People lose interest in the things they love when they’re extremely stressed or disturbed in their life, Mr. Potter. It is generally the first sign. When was the last time you flew?” she asked and her twinkling eyes suddenly reminded Harry of his late mentor, Dumbledore. Only, her eyes were green, not blue.
“Draco! Will you stop doing that?” Harry whirled on him abruptly although his voice was no more than a hiss.
Thank you for leaving Kudos!
"When are we going to talk about what happened? Or what will happen?" the post-haze period mellowed Draco's stern exterior a bit and it was loud in the way he spoke.
“Picking an outfit for you,” she stated.
"You look like shit," she observed as she handed him the mug and he took it gratefully though he wouldn't be admitting it ever.
So, he Floo-called Hermione’s house, as sending an owl didn’t work.
“He didn’t. He wanted to keep his family name or at least hyphenate our surnames. I denied him that option,” Harry’s fingers clenched tightly together. Talking about Draco was harder that he imagined.
"Potter, wake up, your friends are here," Draco tried shaking the man awake but he wouldn't budge. Harry caught a summer cold a few days ago and the potion he ingested for it had sleep-inducing herbs in it. That was why the man slept soundly. Draco was about to wake Harry once again but an idea popped into his mind and he smirked before calling out to Ronald and Hermione, "Come in!"
"I'm fine, Sebastian," Draco answered the bird's silent question.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
I’m stuck here and
"The child or me," Draco left the choice for Harry now though he was pretty sure Harry would not choose him. He was never anyone's first choice; not in the past and certainly, it wouldn't be so now or in the future.
"Thank Merlin! What the hell were you thinking, Malfoy?" Ron yelled again and it was giving Draco a stubborn headache.
Harry gritted his teeth audibly to curb a strong wave of anger bubbling and rippling towards Healer Reynolds. It wasn’t her place to decide how Harry feels about himself now, is it? She was appointed to cure his mind; not to determine his love for himself, or lack thereof. He was just about to make this fair point against her when she raised a hand to quiet him down.
“My recent session with the Healer… it wasn’t so good,” Harry suddenly stopped speaking and hunched over himself. His grip tightened around Draco’s palm as if letting go would mean he’d fall off a cliff.
“Are you going to say anything, Malfoy?” Harry asked, standing up to his full height and preparing himself for a fight.
“Correction. Auror Harry Potter’s office is not private. Any Ministry building is not private. Also, I shall take the liberty to remind you of freedom of speech and freedom to write, if you’ve forgotten the commandments, Mr. Potter. You can’t legally charge us, not when you’re a public figure. Your everything belongs to us,” Rita piped up again and deep down, Harry knew that.
"And I make my choice, Potter."
"Please," he wanted to kill himself for begging Potter, of all people. "It's the only thing I have left now. You can hyphenate your surname to mine. Would that work?"
“Luckily, no. It happened only once but it scared the shite out of me,” Ron said, his body shuddering at the memory of Harry losing control and breaking half the things in his home.
'Don't you think I deserve to be happy too? I lost everything! I lost the one I love. What am I supposed to do, Granger?'
"I like you, Draco," Harry confessed before licking Draco's lips, not quite kissing him.
“You’re wearing my ring too. That means something, right?” Harry asked, a faint spark of hope burning his heart warmly.
“Don’t look,” Draco protested, covering the Mark with his right hand but Harry swatted it away to the side and took in all the red raised scratches and what Harry could only decipher to be cigarette burns littered over the Dark Mark unevenly.
Suddenly, Harry’s hands cupped Draco’s face and turned it towards him so that they were facing each other. Draco’s heart pounded, partly in fear of what Harry would do but he willed himself to calm down. This time there was no mistaking the way Harry looked at Draco. He felt relieved that his mind wasn't playing tricks on him but Draco wasn't sure that he could go any further with Harry at the moment. It was hard to come to terms with the fact that he might be falling for the boy he hated long ago.
“Beautiful, isn’t it? I purchased this house for the view I get from this window and from my bedroom,” Harry said, resting his chin on Draco’s right shoulder. “Our bedroom now,” he corrected.
“You guys good?” a bossy female voice startled the pair of their stupor and Draco parted his hands in a flash. Ginny Weasley’s head peeked into the room. “Draco?” she pointed her eyes at him.
Ignoring the buzz in his ears, Draco stepped into the Floo. Taking in a deep breath, he said, “Diagon Alley.” And off he went through a myriad of chimneys until he fell out of the right one rather ungraciously. He coughed and wiped ash off of his robes and hair when he felt a Cleaning Charm rush over him.
“Yes, it’s me. Can you please open your eyes?” And he did. Curiosity got the best of him when the strike he expected never came. For a while, he blinked rapidly until his eyes adjusted to the pastel light in the room. They were alone in a tiny room and the candles overhead were dimmed so that the room was in a state of semi-darkness. It didn’t take long for him to find Harry’s eyes staring down at him in concern.
“Draco! Hey!”
“Save it and get out,” Draco’s tone of disinterest mixed with unbridled anger didn’t falter in the least.
“He really rubbed off on you, didn’t he?” Draco commented. After a couple of seconds passed, he realized that his question could be a double entendre and swiftly tried to cover it up. “You must have acquired a lot of tastes from Harry.” Even this one didn’t sound right.
He seated her on the sofa and sat down next to her.
"Say ah!" Harry sang and his mind still whirling, Draco complied and savored the burst of the soft juicy chocolate pastry. It took him a while to break out of his stupor and find two entirely befuddled faces of Ron, whose face was flaming red, and Hermione, whose face was equally red too. "Belated happy birthday, Draco darling," Harry wished before kissing him on the cheek lightly, so reminiscent of Draco's Mother who did the same for him. Only gagging sounds from Ronald brought Draco back to reality and when he realized why the ginger head blew a fuse, he smirked at him before planting a loud wet kiss on Harry's cheek and wishing him a Happy birthday once again.
And Draco did hold on as Harry asked and fell into the plush blue sofa, raising his arse for Harry as an offering. The thrusts that followed were so ruthless and aggressive that Draco’s skin tore a bit, bleeding into Harry’s motions and lubricating the passage hotly. They were too lost in the passion of feeling each other to recognize the slight damage which could be healed almost immediately.

"Good," he nodded. He needed a smoke. Now. His hands impulsively came together and his right-hand fingers started twisting his wedding ring again, a secondary means of comfort if a cig wasn’t available.
“Just keep still, please!”
"Have you ever had something on you that you desperately wanted to erase but couldn't? Something you're ashamed of because the only person who you thought would treat you as a human chooses to acknowledge that which you could never ever erase in the worst possible way?" Draco's eyes were vacant and distant as he forced his words to penetrate the depths of Granger's understanding.
“Let’s go to our room? And, have some celebratory drinks later? I have the finest wine sitting inside my kitchen cupboard,” Harry asked, his breath fanning hotly across Draco’s face. He smelled like butter, which he had along with his lunch as if the butter on the bread wasn't already enough. Draco couldn’t comprehend the man’s love for it. Potter did not spread butter over his food but dipped his food in it. At this rate, he’d die of a heart attack instead of going down by fighting the bad guys, like everyone thought he would.
"Oh, Harry," she whispered against his shoulder as she hugged him tight. "I'll
I knew whose story is almost exactly the same as Hertzfeld's! And
"Harry," she said, the exasperation clear in her voice. "You're doing it again."
"Er…"
Draco laughed, ruffling his son's hair, and Harry moved away, deciding to give the family some privacy while he wrapped things up.
Buxley strode to the door, but before he left, he looked over his shoulder and asked, "Who was the fellow who reminded you of Hertzfeld?"
"We're unsure, but the parents claim that the boy went through the Floo before Mr Malfoy did but never arrived at the destination."
Feeling his heart begin to race, Harry took on a demeanour of confusion and shook his head. "Last night? No, I didn't. Ginny fell asleep on the sofa so I went up to get some work done. Why?"
They sat in silence for a while, watching Lily feed her doll the pudding while making a mess around her, and Molly finally spoke up.
"And this is the last of it?"
He looked over his shoulders where the other Auror was standing. The man jerked his thumb over his shoulder and exited the room, and Harry followed after him. They walked over to where an Auror was bent over a table, examining the discarded the envelope within which the blueprint had print. The blond Auror tapped the other one on the back. "Hughes."
“I'm with Ginny,” Harry told her sternly, “we’re happy together, Malfoy knows that.”
it with a goddamn sword like a bloody medieval
Draco passed him a petite glass of borgans brandy, rose petals and ice cubes swirling around in the bottom. Harry was sitting on one of the little chairs on dracos porch resting his ankle on his knee comfortably, his favorite black jacket smelt of smoke and that dusty herbal scent cleaning charms leave behind. He smiled tightly at draco as he took the glass and thanked him politely, watching him sit. Although he was trying his best to present as comfortable he felt quite the opposite. Harry was nervous and tense around Draco, like he was anticipating Draco making a pass. He hadn't gotten as far as to imagine his response yet, and he didn't really want to think about it. He stared at the darkening skyline, the sun long since disappeared behind the trees.
“I'm having a shower, last calls for the loo,” he yelled, pulling his flannel shorts out from the bed frame where they had been wedged. Ginny yelled something affirmative back at him and he stepped into the bathroom, casting a warming spell. The tiled floors were always cold in there. Luna had mushrooms growing in jars next to the bathtub stuck to the walls, they were looking a little sad but neither of them knew how to properly cultivate mushrooms so they were just hoping they might perk up. Harry stripped and kicked his clothes into the corner where they wouldnt get wet and turned the shower on. He examined his body in the mirror while the water heated up, there was nothing special about him. He had a few scars here and there, the gash that ran up his forearm from wrist to elbow pit hadnt healed nicely at all and was still waxy and puckered even after all these years. He thought of malfoys wrist, how it was marked in a similar way but with the curling black ink of a terrible mark. He had caught a glimpse of it earlier, when malfoy rolled his sleeves up to do the dishes after dinner. It had stunned him for some reason, still so vibrant and dark, the mark hadnt faded at all. He had been expecting it to dull, after his death and the years that had passed, he thought it might fade even a little. But there it was, cruel and harsh and black as ever. It disgusted harry.
Harry could see how his actions were affecting the other man, the confusion that crossed dracos features when he frowned at something Draco said, the way his cheeks heated when their eyes held for a moment too long, he knew watching him in such a way wasn't healthy for anyone. When draco came over to explore a new animal trail luna had found on wednesday night, the turn of the seasons, harry had tried his hardest to ignore him as if it would counter the over attentiveness draco had been on the receiving end of all week. but If anything it had fueled his fire, the next day another partnered potions assignment was given out and draco had been at his elbow. Harry had said yes, Sean and Lavender had gotten together some time on the weekend at a small house party and were doing everything together, Harry  found it a little disturbing. He was almost grateful for draco providing an alternative.
made him seek it more vigorously. And with puberty and sexuality slipping into his life draco had become mean, only realising his feelings as attraction when they were blatantly spelled out. For a while he thought  he might have moved on from Harry, after he had pushed Jordan away, but those same feelings had returned anew and he felt heavy.
Harry looked down. It was worse than it felt, the bleeding around his cuticles was pooling and looked terrible. What a terrible habit Harry had to stop, it was a nervous twitch of sorts he had developed, he hardly noticed he was doing it most of the time. He examined his rough hands, trying to see them from draco's point of view. Untidy and torn and calloused, he looked tough Harry supposed.
he waved the percolator at Ginny and raised an eyebrow, asking silently if she needed a second cup, then fought off a yawn and missed the answer. He filled it up any way and threw it on the stove lighting the gas.
that he wore a necklace of the thing around his neck, draco reached out to hold Harry's hand still so he could examine the little details, tiny intricate scales and sharp teeth and mean eyes, it was beautiful and haunting.
Draco had been busy, for the first time in a while he
"i like your place," he offered up eloquently, looking at draco now fully clothed standing nervously in the doorway. The pressure seemed to be let out of him for a second and his shoulders slumped in relief he didn't even know he was waiting on. draco nodded and set about setting up a cauldron on the stovetop unhurriedly, pouring a measurement of aqua into it to start boiling.
“Are you going with malfoy? The wards are all fixed, yeah?” ginny asked. They had an incident a while ago when Ron tried to apparate directly into their backyard and the warding had sent him a kicking stinging hex. But they mostly had it figured out now and only people with ill intent suffer the consequences. In hindsight rod had probably fallen under that list, bearing stink bombs as a practical joke to spice up their wednesday evening.
“There's a little walking path I like, always covered in moss. Did you know the niplets that spread it live in the creek down that way? I want to find some,” luna petted the seedling she was holding gently, roughing up its roots to get the soil off them, “also bring your cat, i want to meet him.”
"You taste like booze," Ginny said when Harry finally let her go, "What did you and malfoys get up to?"
"I'm sorry, come in," Draco huffed, a little embarrassed as he opened the door. harry stared at him for a second while draco squinted at the bright sunlight that streamed in through the doorway. he hadn't anticipated sleeping in so late, it was 12:36 according to his clock. he left harry in the doorway to decide for himself weather he would come inside and angrily opened up some curtains, filling the unit with light. he vowed to leave the curtains open at night from then on. "I won't be a minute, sit down anywhere," Draco said and hurried to his room. He threw on a silver knit jumper and trouser pants and his favourite socks with the grip on the bottom so he wouldn't slide about on his polished wooden floors.
"You should just come with us," luna was saying, pouring out more tea for Ginny who had been giving her side eyes about it, "the weather's nice for it."
“No, actually I invited him to go down to the creek with me, you should come too!” luna bounced to the feet and wandered over to the front door, inviting draco into their house. Harry felt a little unsteady, he sat on the back of the couch behind ginny. It was strange seeing Draco in his kitchen, so clean cut and propper, he looked very out of place. Draco came across more like an OH&S inspector than a guest, Harry felt like he should be pointing out the muggle fire alarms he had on the roof and the warding they had set up. But Luna was asking if Draco wanted tea, using his first name like good old chums, and Draco was saying yes and Harry's mind was spinning too fast.
and brushed himself off roughly. He removed his boot and shook it out wobbling on one foot. Draco touched his elbow to support him and to his surprise Harry held his shoulder as he put his show back on.
“Awwww,” ginny cooed, dropping her pen, “malfoy, is this your cat?” she asked, having skipped greeting the shy blonde in their kitchen. He looked over at them, tea in hand hovering by his mouth, and nodded. “It's very chubby,” Ginny said, which made Harry snort.
"I mean, I'm sure he's got many," he mumbled, "I was just poking fun. Actually, I think it's pretty hot that you wear that," oh god there it was. He'd said too much, he was too drunk to be sitting so close, his hand was still resting on Harry's chest. He should move it, but his fingers were tightening on the material and the way Harry's eyes were staring right through his, the way his cheeks were pink from booze and his hair was roughed up, made draco feel funny inside.
Sometimes Luna just said weird things, draco knew that, but he couldn't tear his eyes away from the delicate blue petals. What had she really meant by that, was the flower handed to Luna from Harry, and she had then decided to pass it on to him? Or had Harry asked Luna to pass it on? A little extension of the metaphorical olive brace, was Harry looking to be perhaps friends? In which case, why the flower? Draco could feel himself slipping into a little crisis and tried to snap back to reality where the other students had already moved on and were slipping into elbow length leather gloves.
Friday morning. ... Friday mornings had changed for him, becoming a person or a colour almost.  It had taken a while for days to regain their substance and meaning, and a deal of healing to catch up, but now Friday morning signified the last day of the week, a day to spend looking forward to Saturday, to the weekend. The days had been traveling slowly, since the war and the cleanup that came next. and not just the cleanup of the school, that mess was easily swept under beds and hidden, but people needed cleaning too, cultures needed re shaping homes rebuilding around empty seats, new neighborhoods with new neighbors that would struggle for trust. cleanup after funerals clean up after parties, after weddings twice postponed and children conceived in the sudden shocking still and calm of the world. There was a lot of clean up, work hasn't returned to a regular schedule even months after His death, and the weeks in that time, and the few years before during the war, had simply been numbers to cross off on a calendar. but they were regaining substance. Wednesday felt green, number three of the week, one of Harry's favourite days. Saturday was red with energy and excitement and Sunday mulled down to a calmer purple slipping into blue Monday.
“What's wrong?” ginny asked. She flushed the loo and kicked her shorts off and slipped out of her shirt. Wincing Ginny stepped into the tub and under the water, settling in next to Harry, his body scalding besides her own. “Did Malfoy do something?”
“Draco has a thing for you,” Luna said. Harry spat his tea across the flower bed he was working on. It was a mild Saturday morning, every now and then the clouds above them would squeeze out a smattering of rain but it never settled into
"What are you doing?" Draco asked, he felt that casual questions were acceptable now, given everything.
He instructed Harry on the best way to chop the bore root and kept a close eye on him, not sure if brewing slightly stoned was the best idea. But Harry was diligent and careful and more concentrated than before so draco didn't say anything on the matter. He pondered while he stirred whether Harry ever attended classes in that state, and thought the answer was most likely a yes, he did. Then he considered how often, and why he'd never noticed. Which he supposed was the same reason he hadn't noticed his attraction until sixth year when Jordan had spelled it out for him. He had been avoiding the matter furiously, when it would have been easier to face head on in hindsight. Harry was a reasonable man and draco was sure he would have understood, spared some empathy in light of draco's dialemmer. Instead Draco had bullied him for years, a more extreme form of playground pigtail pulling backed up by poor parenting and prophecies that enabled self entitlement.
Malloy looked over at Luna, visibly avoiding Harry's eye. He looked uncomfortable and stiff, all Strait jutting angles in their soft kitchen, observing a homely conversation he was unused to bearing witness to. Harry leaned over ginny's lap and sipped her tea.
but they were all inadequate responses. they would only serve to drive a steak between them and whatever progress they were making towards being something like, not quite friends, buddies perhaps. they may even descend back into arguments and snide comments, and Draco was surprised to find he didn't want that. that he had moved on and matured past the childish whims of fighting for fun and stirring shit. He felt like he could try to be a good student without the outliers.
"You're pregnant?" Harry was the first to break the stupor that blanketed them upon Hermione's accidental reveal of her condition.
Thank you Irisk for your precious comments and here's the update!
“Um, don’t be mad about what I’m going to say. Considering you’ve gone through trauma too, we believed it would be best if you also saw a Mind Healer,” Ronald said cautiously, avoiding Draco’s incredulous look.
The Dark Mark on his left arm was coated with red lines, which, of course, Draco did to himself in an attempt to scratch the vile thing away. It still stayed. He now had an idea that he could probably burn it off his skin just like how it was burned into it by the Dark Lord. Maybe then people would look at him differently. Maybe then Harry would see him for the miserable human that he was all along.
They were sat in Shacklebolt's office with "Bond in Marriage" papers in front of them on the desk. And Draco had a problem.
“These rings will recognize you to be bonded in marriage once you finish exchanging them,” Shacklebolt answered Draco’s confusion. Harry simply nodded in acknowledgment.
“I couldn’t see you destroying yourself because of me and I knew what triggered your panic attack earlier at St Mungo’s,” Harry said, placing his hand on Draco’s but Draco pulled away.
Draco immediately led them to the farthest table and got into the cubicle, saving his face from the crowd. He slumped on the table with his head in his arms.
"Move, Harry," Draco wanted to say it boldly but it only came out as a whining plea.
Her words echoed in the confines of his mind.
“I suppose you’ve bought another broomstick?”
"Cut the cake, Potter. Unlike you, some people here want to eat it," Draco replied, twisting his fingers together so as to not grab the cake for himself and Harry laughed.
"Such a simple name," Draco mumbled and sure enough, he was unheard by the two parties.
"Who would've guessed I'd live to see a Malfoy wear a Weasley sweater for Christmas?" George commented and everyone laughed. They didn't mock him. No, they were trying to be civil with him by making light fun of his predicament.
"I'll see you tonight," Harry got up to leave when Draco's voice stopped him.
I remember.
Madcheshirefox, Irisk, kikukaku, canadianliverfailure - Ron has always been the least understanding one, especially in the case of Death Eaters and the like. But, yes, you have to wait for a while for everything to get better. Thanks!
"Doesn't every Auror at the Ministry know that I'm here, Weasley? Where are the rest of you?" he asked, the answer obvious, at least to him.
“Hey,” he greeted them.
"I deserve it," Draco repeated Harry’s words breathily, tears flowing out of his eyes and mingling with his blood that was gradually pooling around his head, as he could take no more for he feared that he'd die if he let Harry continue any longer. He was already on the edge of blackness due to the lack of air and loss of blood.
Okay, so now the story's on the road to recovery. We're still in Harry's lane it'll not be long before we will also get to walk the path of Draco's recovery. It'll be slow. Probably mundane. But that's what healing is. It's boring but wholesome in the end.
“I want to talk to him,” Harry countered as he fisted Ron’s grip of his shoulder, trying to pry it away.
"Ronald Weasley! Don't be a vermin. Sit and eat like a human," Hermione scolded her husband and Ronald deflated like a pinched balloon.
Thank you I'm_a_bird and CherylMercury for commenting your thoughts!
“St Mungo’s!” Harry told more to himself than to Hermione as his body jerked forth to help her stand up.
Hope you guys are safe and sound. I pray for you to have the strength to support yourself and your families. Let the world be normal soon.
I'm really sorry for not updating for more than a month. I am dealing with some personal issues as of now. I got robbed a month ago and lost quite a couple of important items. I was scared to death and left for my hometown. Not even once has this story crossed my mind because I was dealing with the aftermath. Luckily, I was safe and am recovering pretty well. Sorry once again but I hope you guys understand. Thank you.
“Is that an order, Harry?” Draco asked, blowing out a shapeless cloud of smoke.
"You can't be sure of that," Draco said, trying to grab his hand back but Harry didn't loosen his grip.
Draco breathed out smoke through his nostrils and put out his bud.
damn coffee from
He wanted to. He wanted to confront Harry and yell at him demanding an explanation for all that had happened. But what was the point? Harry’s reasons for doing what he did were simple enough to understand. They were no puzzles. Harry wanted a child, a family and he knew Draco wouldn’t ever be ready to carry one. Only Merlin would ever know why Harry turned out to be so twisted that he spiked Draco’s drinks with an Artificial Pregnancy Potion. According to him, he was doing both of them a favor, trying to give themselves a chance at a normal life. Yet, he failed to understand the emotional repercussions his decision would bring about. They used to be something but it all fell apart in just one day and Draco wasn’t sure if they could build that burnt bridge again.
For now, he’ll let himself adore the sweet bundle that is Rose Granger-Weasley.
"Forty seconds, Harry," Draco counted.
"Is poor Draco jealous? Does he want some kisses and cuddles?" it would've sounded so cringy if the situation was anything but this. But right then, Harry only mocked whatever Draco was feeling towards him and Draco's cheeks heated up in sheer humiliation. He sneered down at his husband before turning away and laying down on the bed as far as he could from Harry. Draco focused his gaze on the night sky through the window as he tried to lull himself back into a state of deep slumber where no one, not even Harry could enter.
Harry slipped the mushrooms into his bag and stood, looking down at draco for a minute. He pocketed the knife and held out a hand. Draco gazed up at him, recognising the encounter for what it was suddenly. Harry had actively sought him out, had made his way over to him and started up a conversation. This was them turning into something more than classmates. This was Harry accepting the olive branch. Draco let the smile he felt inside slip over his face and he took Harry's calloused hand, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet. He held on for a second longer than was necessary, locking eyes with him for a moment. Harry pulled his hand back and brushed it off against his hip.
Kelly's was a little pub on the corner of a cross road, parkland burst over the pavement across the road on one side and there was an old abandoned theatre next door most people smoked in. Harry caught up with Hermione and Ron there sometimes on Friday night's, at school they mostly just chatted about school work so it was nice to go out for a few drinks and talk rubbish. Kelly's was one of those warm orange lamp lit pubs, burgundy couches and small splintered coffee tables littered the walls and tacky fake plants in vases by a tiny platform for small bands or solo musicians. Harry pictured draco standing by the tight dance floor holding a glass of beer and tapping along to the rhythm while sweaty niche hipsters bumbled around half baked and drunk. He tried to imagine him interacting with the staff and other patrons, he almost managed it. It was a funny sight, but Harry was becoming used to these little conjured scenes of draco.
that ridiculous thing. And Hugo even carries his car into the bath—the paint's already started chipping."
"At least he'll be able to spend the rest of his days in peace." Harry watched two Aurors help Lestrange climb over a small boulder.
"Right, guys, hey," he said, clapping his hands together and drawing everyone's attention to him. "Since you both are here, what say we go out and get some lunch?"
"How's Lestrange doing?" Harry asked when Robards passed by, earning a scathing look from the older wizard.
"Right, of course. Sorry that I had you take time off work."
It took Harry about ten seconds to put two and two together. And when he did, a sense of exhaustion settled over him, and he fell back in his seat.
you can have some."
"My apologies," he said breathlessly as he adjusted his dishevelled clothes and hair. "My son was throwing a tantrum and refused to go to his pre-school without seeing me, so my wife had to bring him here before she left for work. And once he saw me, he refused to leave."
Buxley glowered at him, Levitated the pile off the desk again, and left Harry's office while muttering expletives loud enough for him to hear. Rolling his eyes, Harry signed the parchment and placed it on the completed pile. He'd just started with the next case study when there was a knock on the door.
"The auction's happening in their ballroom. It starts at nine, but I suppose we'll have to be there around four or earlier to get your vase sorted out. Is that alright?"
Malfoy nodded. "She's one of my best. Correct me if I'm wrong, but seeing as she's the one corresponding with you, I presume you're here as someone suffering from war trauma?"
Draco turned to face Harry and saw that he was looking up at something. When he followed Harry's gaze and spotted what he was looking at, Draco whispered, "Mistletoe."
and waiting for something to jump out at him. A shiver ran down his spine, and he felt like there was something in the shadows, but before he could check, a stair creaked. He snapped around, wand brandished, only to come face to face with a bewildered Fleur.
"Oh…" she trailed off, and he straightened up with a frown.
"Sometimes I wished you'd just quit with the mind games," he said tiredly, and Kingsley chortled.
Malfoy smiled. "Three o'clock sounds perfect. I hope your surprise trip to see your wife goes well."
Neville shook his head. "I even wrote it all down, just in case." He scratched his chin awkwardly, and Harry couldn't help but grin.
"Actually, I would like to argue that it is. I
"You're not going on
Harry ground his teeth together as he tried to breathe, and then, reaching down, picked the bottle up and took a swig.
Hermione's eyes widened and she got a slack-jawed expression on her face. "You want me to
"It's just… Arthur and I were talking, and we both think that it's time you put the children back in pre-school."
"How come?"
It wasn't long before Neville and Ron returned, and Draco gladly made conversation with the former about the latest research work he was conducting with his interns while the latter yelled at his sister for causing a mess before anything had even begun. The evening passed quicker than Draco had thought it would; between discussing the book Hermione had lent him recently and the sad game the Chudley Cannons had displayed with Ron, as well as the alcohol that was going down by the gallon, he had managed to avoid Harry for most of the evening.
Harry looked around and realised it was him who had spoken. Damn weed, he shouldn't smoke around people. “I mean, he wasn't mean to me, and he knows what he's doing,” Harry should have just stopped at that first statement but wasn't quite able to control his tongue so it seemed. Luna smiled at him broadly, nodding along.
"Hi," draco hummed, leaning forward for another kiss. Jordans chin was scratchy and rough against Draco's face, pansy had asked about the faint rash on dracos jaw last week and since then he had invested in some lovely skin lotion. He appreciated Jordan for keeping them a secret. He wasn't sure what they were, boyfriends, lovers, an affair, labels didn't seem to suit, the only one Draco had been adamant on was
"it's just a tv show, catch up on it later,"
"We should go out then," Harry said, picking up his glass, draco made a noise. He looked up at him as he took a sip, draco was wide eyed and red and it struck harry suddenly what he had said, he coughed into his glass, "I mean, the group, the uh, our little study table, to Kelly's," he spluttered, trying to make up ground for whatever line he had crossed. He emptied his glass and draco followed suit.
They had chosen to have separate rooms when they moved in, space was a key aspect to not biting each other's heads off. It was also nice to not have to fight over things like pillows and temperature and who sleeps nearest the door and why the blanket keeps being pulled over to ginny's side of the bed. They functioned well as a couple who lived together in separate rooms, Harry couldn't imagine why anyone would choose to have it any other way.
“What are you looking at?” Harry asked, appearing out of nowhere. Draco yelped and fell back onto his bum.  Harry had almost filled his little heshed bag with chamomile, draco could smell it from where he sat, and some other purplish leaves were poking out of the top. Draco saw Harry still had leaves and moss in his hair.
"No can do," Harry mused, flicking at the pieces, "I'm behind on my last assignment but I'll catch up with you at lunch still." ginny swatted his hand away and flicked a spell at the mug, the pieces flying back together and crackling into place. Harry watched the sink for a bit and ran through his list again in his head.
Draco was actually a surprisingly good potions teacher Harry discovered. He knew what he was doing and did not hesitate making decisions. it gave harry a little confidence, he was better to work with than ron who chatted too much and got them both side tracked. ron and hermione both had chosen to fast track their catchup years. Ron chose to because he hated school and prefered working in the joke shop he and George were trying to revamp, and Hermione had too many ideas and career paths she wanted to explore. They were in different classes to Harry, their classes going at a different pace to his, and Harry didn't mind. He had spent the last eight years of his life with them and he knew they would always be there for him when he needed them. it was nice, he felt more grown up and in control on his own.
"You can borrow that one if you want," Harry told him, trying to hide a laugh that might come across as discouraging. He found it cute that Draco might be interested, that he had come so far from the boy who handed all lesser tasks down to elvs. He could see draco at a stove top, cooking a fine dinner with the same skill and effortlessness he had for brewing potions. It was a nice image, Harry smiled to himself.
he thought.
"Hi," Jordan breathed into his mouth. He slid his thumb along dracos jaw and ran his fingers through his hair sending shivers down dracos spine.
and he leaned into ginny and hugged her and cried into her shoulder.
There came a knock from the door and Ginny barged in stumbling over Harry's pile of clothes. She launched herself at the toilet and dropped her shorts.
was still, at least in part, alive. Harry felt helpless for a moment, like it had all been for nothing if there was still parts of voldemort in the world.
Harry yelled his greetings to Ginny who was in her chair struggling with history of magic homework and threw his satchel at his room, watching it bounce into the laundry closet instead. Luna Released him and bounced down the wooden steps onto the tame lawn, turning in time to watch as Harry tripped on the lip of the dorway and fell down the stairs, rolling ungracefully. He came to a stop on his back looking up at the sky. It was just gone dusk, the clouds were tinged pink and orange and he spent a moment just gazing at them. He didn't feel embarrassed around Luna, she was busy picking grass and dropping it onto his head. No, he thanked Merlin Ginny hadn't seen him do that just then. The merciless minutes of teasing he would have had to endure had she bared witness to that tumble.
he often cooed to it. Brenton had chased it around the house much to dracos delight.
Draco showed him where he was doing things incorrectly with his brewing techniques without being insulting, and Harry found himself relaxing into the small kitchen area easily. it shocked him how easily he was able to move on from hatred and scepticism and unease to this comfortable environment he found himself in. he got distracted sometimes, looking at draco and the way he moved, trying to piece together how this could be the same person as the boy on the astrology tower, or in the bathroom, or the scared little kid in the dark forest who easily abandoned him to save his own skin. and draco would catch harry staring and scowl at him and ask
“He's a good potions teacher,”
Draco touched his forehead, it wasn't painful anymore but rather at the itchy stage of healing. He had hoped Harry might not have noticed it but felt no such luck. and Draco was faced with the dilemma of answering that question. so many responses ran through his head;
She looked up and grinned at Harry and he offered her another mug of tea.
“Hurry uppp,” ginny yelled at them from further down the trail, grinning maniacally. Harry flipped a finger and told her where she could shove the moss next time and jogged to catch up with them, leaving Draco to shove his hands in his pockets and wonder where he stood in Harry's life. His chubby white cat broke out of a bush near him and composed itself, strutting over to walk next to draco calmly.
of the trip to see his dear friend Blaize, getting a tan, or horribly sunburnt. He felt new energy to do
draco pulled himself out of the shower, clenching and unclenching his fists to stop his fingers from shaking. what a way to start his sunday. he looked at himself in the mirror and frowned at a growing bruise on his forehead where he must have hit his head in his writhing sleep. he pulled open the second draw where his products were kept, fine hair conditioner and tea tree shampoos, aftershave that smells like cinnamon and pine needles and a cologne he had found in a muggle store that took to his fancy, and a little bottle of fresh healing potion that he had made in class last week. he dabbed it onto the bruise on his face and ran a comb through his hair while he waited for the potion to settle into his skin.
“No.'' Ginny said. Looking dejected. She shoved a cat out of the way and lay down next to luna, curling into her side. Harry smiled at her fondly, sucking in smoke, and draco felt a sliver of jealousy which was quickly batted away. He had no right to get in between their relationship. Draco would eventually have to move on from this stupid crush he couldnt seem to get over. It was the damndest thing, Draco had fallen for Harry so many years ago in the robe store in Diagon alley. Back then the little boy on the stool, his ethnic appearance and shy, kind face, had caught draco's attention immediately. He had been interested in friendship, and when that offer was batted down so harshly in front of the whole year level he had grown somewhat obsessive. The stubborn allurence of
Luna passed Harry the half smoked joint shed had stored behind her ear and he accepted it without a word. Draco watched him light it wandlessly, slightly disturbed with himself about the way that image made him feel, and when Harry breathed out thick bluish smoke he had to look away, feeling a little overwhelmed.
“Do you play any instruments?”
Luna was completely blazed when they returned to the clearing, humming that same song to herself happily and waving her arms through the air. The cats were sitting by her head next to ginny who was eating a plain bread roll. Harry said something stupid about ginny not bringing him a roll too and pulled tybalt into his lap. Ginny graciously broke off a piece of bread for him.
“But it isn't him, Harry,” Ginny tried reassuring, “he's dead, Voldemort died and those marks left are just that, souvenirs of poor life choices.” Ginny rested her head on harrys, her hair fell into his face, plasted there by the water.
friday mornings he woke up to yellow light filtering through the window and the smell of the shower down the hall and coffee ready made sitting on the stove. he arched his back under the duvet and stretched out his spine, digging his heels into the soft mattress. he spent a moment suspended from the bed to think through the list of names in his head.
Draco looked down at Harry pittingly and extended his arm to pull him up. He was still rummaging through the back of his jacket, picking moss out distractedly, sitting cross legged on the wet ground. Draco could see moss and leaves in his hair and without thinking reached the short distance further to pick it out. Harry flinched and slapped his hands away, looking up surprised to see Draco there. He was particularly quiet and still sometimes.
"Can I kiss you?" He spoke the words quietly, Harry didn't react. He was still watching draco, his expression mild terror or excitement, draco couldn't pick. Without any real thought he took a wild leap into the unknown and pulled Harry forward. Draco closed his eyes as their lips connected, warm and gentle against each other. Harry didn't move, he seemed frozen for a long moment that stretched out even further when draco tried to deepen the kiss, slipping his tongue into the heat of his mouth.
Draco closed the draw a little harder than was necessary, his facial expression was near impossible to read, he almost looked constipated. ,"or you can, if you want i mean," he started and Harry knew where that sentence was going to end. Draco starred a little helplessly, mouth open as he debated weather to speak the words. Harry watched him expectantly, cocking an eyebrow.
"no, ,no no I do value it, I really do," Draco stumbled, grimacing, "I'm sorry I just missed my alarm, won't happen again." It was a weak excuse and he could feel her disappointment. but it was the truth and he really couldn't see any other way to escape telling her this. a lie would have sounded far worse and he was trying so hard this year to set things right, to make good impressions and argue less.
off the screen.
“Would you like to join me for a stroll this evening?” luna asked airily, her elbow brushing against dracos so he knew she was talking to him instead of the other students on their workbench. It was funny hearing luna speak so formally and properly. Draco supposed she was putting it on a little to impress him or something, he thought they were thoughts luna might have.
"I'll stay," Harry cut him off, kicking himself the moment the words left him. What was he thinking? Really, what could possibly be achieved by staying the night at draco malfoy's little unit?  Draco was staring at him a little stupidly, not really sure what was happening. He looked.. gleeful. Harry's stomach dropped, he was going too far with this game of chicken but there didn't seem to be any breaks to it either, he was just a passenger in his fucked up alter egos cart watching the world hurtle past. He heard himself ask about dinner, watched his hands place his bag on the ground and unbutton his jacket, his body sat on a chair opposite the blond, he saw Draco smile more confidently as he chatted something about leftover lentils. It was surreal, it was a dream.
"Uh, west witches I suppose," Harry decided on humoring Draco's little whims, it was actually kind of amusing seeing him so flustered, such a change from the cocky little twat back at hogwarts. He sat up straighter in his chair and picked up his glass, "I usually just listen to triple j on the radio though."
Padma stared at her, the disbelief clear on her face, and even Harry himself was eyeing the girl with amazement. Was this the same girl who had broken down in tears less than twenty minutes ago?
to die. And Harry's heart broke as he stared into those dark eyes completely devoid of life.
"Alright, where's it broken?" Harry asked, putting Lily down and squatting beside what looked like a rather large, lopsided yellow tricycle. He frowned. "Jamie, where did you get this?"
