“I do not know whether or not to curse you, honor you, or bind you to my court, young Lord Potter.” Harry turned and seeing who spoke went to bow. “Do not kneel.” Harry stopped and stood uncertainly before Phariah Xerxes. “Join me young man, your visit has brought strife to my lands. We are the land the Peverell’s called home, we recall well the daughters who left our shores to secure the alliance between your house and there’s. Whispers abounded in the court even then that we should bind your house to these sands. But Rome held your family’s allegiance, and when it fell, a people saw your worth, and your house found in them a place to call their own. Your house has flourished in the North, I will not deny that, but it has suffered to. Look out into the streets the people rejoice they know no fear, despite that a man that brought us almost to the brink of war with Albion is free again. Your visit has been noted by them, but they see your strength, they see the honor of there former queens words.”
“Not for me but for my current client.” Said Alrick in response.
"You can't do that here either, its why starting this year Hogwarts will have a Wizarding Culture and Traditions class. The wizarding world has different do's and don'ts, it's a different culture."
Finishing that first set Harry started onto the second group. He first divided the students up by school they were attending and then wrote a letter requesting Progress reports with an attached list with all the children of House Potter attending that school. These letters he set aside to mail more towards the end of September. He then added a caveat to the letter, requesting that said progress reports be sent at the end of each month of the school year for his assessment.
Draco thought of the prophecy now, what was the choice, what was the decision he could make that would cause one over the other.
"Done," the Slytherin said holding out his hand.
Sirius, Neville, and Harry walked towards the exit talking amiably about different things as the two young men spoke enthusiastically about their summer. While Sirius listened happily on. They were however stopped by to figures suddenly in their path. The two quick open palmed slaps that landed on Harry’s faces quickly saw to all conversation stopping and focusing on the group as Harry’s guards immediately had both girls to wand point.
"For the most part things have not changed overall, however claims have been made that Voldemort survived that night and has now returned. The ministry has denied it and is slandering both Dumbledore and the Potter heir in the press, but Potter is also starting to make waves. Something has happened with him and now he has suddenly changed, going as far as to openly challenge Dumbledore at the sorting feast of Hogwarts. Six months ago, I would have sworn that the Potter line was all but dead, the boy very obviously knew nothing, now I'm left scrambling to find out where he's getting his information."
December 25, 1992, ~ Obliviate ~ Albus Dumbledore
"That is some I never understood, house Potter is second to none in defensive magics throughout Albion, yet they aren't our defensive masters in either the Longbottoms, or the Blacks capacity. But their position lies in the one area where their family magic lacks. Does it tie into the reason the house of Potter is able to harness the wards?" Brwen Davies, Ravenclaw sixth year, and heir to the house of Davies, asks.
This chapter we deal with the repercussions of the last chapter, Harry meets his last guardian, who begins to teach him how to deal with the Political turmoil that Marvolo has brought with his return.
On Sunday Gryffindor also witnessed the rare event of complete silence in the Great Hall. As students were engrossed in their papers, the Prophet was forced to write a completely unheard of apology and retraction on the front page of the paper, for gross misrepresentation and slander of a head of one of the elder houses. Furthermore, the article corrected its mistake and wrote a nice piece praising the Black Head for its "remaining faithful to its royal charge, even after so long."
Potter Manor, England
“I’m, I’m” Harry started stuttering.
“That is to be expected not to sound rude, but this is a matter of which I wish to speak to Grinholt of, the honor of the Goblins is at stake and I will not see my words falling on deaf ears.” Harry answered. Alomar and Neville looked on in surprise.
“Well, now I am authorizing you to invest 10% of the family vaults worth in various companies as you see fit. I’ve been made aware that you traditionally make 1% of all dividends on investments. However, if you double the income of house Potter of my parents’ time, you will receive 6% instead. If you triple the income, you will receive 10%.” He told Sharptooth.
“Come sit next to me. We need to talk about Alexandria’s family.” Harry warily came and sat next to Sirius.
“Well, I that case I could also see the Minister disavowing me as I could technically be classified as a family. But here is what we’ll plan for.” For the next two hours, the 3 wizards went through many plans of defense against the charges against Harry. Until they finally had two that should work and a possible third that was last resort.
"Do remain in your seat Albus, our business today has little to concern yourself. Lord Potter, might I introduce to you Prince Dimitri of the Empire of Russia. He has been in contact with my department for about a month now. Recent actions taken by you are in direct violation of…"

Black ~ heir
"Tonks and I are on duty in the Alley today, but he doesn't know us. We could message either Remus or Molly if we see him, I guess." Kingsley offers. A few grunts of agreement emerge from the silence.
AN: Currently undergoing Rewrite, as always Read and Review
Said Ravenclaw, "We'll teach those whose
“I suppose the story would be too old to have any written records anymore. Well, young heir listen closely and perhaps you will learn something of your own history. I was raised in an era of war. Villages were ransacked, homes destroyed all for the sake of more power. As I am sure you have learned the arcane arts are very different than the magic you use today. But the truth remains the same you are born with the ability for magic or not and the arcane arts are just another branch of magic. In my day the arcane were more well known, well versed in stories, this modern magic so civilized and absolute was only for the big cities, the people close to kings, safe from the rages of war. I was an illegitimate son of the local lord and had no power to my name and unlike my siblings in the castle was not raised learning wanded magics, I learned the arcane, and eventually went to war, as my brothers did. In war they perished and upon returning home I was brought to my father’s house and made heir. The arcane magic practiced by the Le-Fay house I did not find difficult, but I used them sparingly having seen the devastating effects of war, I had no desire to add to it with the arcane ancestral magics. You have to understand that in that era in that time peace had no meaning to us. But then we were conquered, in this new governance, my father was put to the blade and I was installed in his place. For the first time in my life I learned what peace was. Our king was not as power hungry as the last, I married, I saw my family prosper, my children lived a different life than I had. But outside our borders a foolish king rose. His father had like me been a bastard son of a nobleman, with the death of all his fathers’ legitimate siblings his father had been brought into the house as heir, but quickly died in an assassination attempt, on his grandfather’s life. The boy had been turned out for a time and then was welcomed as the new lord of the manor.”
"Lord Potter, there is currently no Lord Potter." The Minister stammered out.
"I'm sorry why is that so important, and who was that at the ministry Harry? He seemed to scare you, that's why I almost went for my wand."
“Our kings are chosen by the land, the Ramses were chosen by the land, almost two millennia ago, over two millennia before that another house was chosen to rule these lands. The earth knows what its people need, she cares for us and is our mother, she doesn’t raise men to be king for no reason. You have battled my daughters words all day, but if the magic of Albion chose you over all those others their must be a reason. I see that reason, it is the reason that from the Hittite, to the Mandarin, to even Japan, your last name is both a curse and an honor, they all desire your houses power to stand at their sides, but curse you when that power is used against them. The power of house Potter is known to them, and they feared most of all, the day that an Albion daughter would bind herself in marriage to a Potter son, knowing that with every instance, it gave the house of Potter one more tie to throne. For some of us, it is unsurprising that a child of your house would be named Albion’s next king.”
For Draco the time between the imprisonment of Sirius Black and the solstice was weird. He had pointed out at dinner the night of Michalis’s verbal tongue lashing to his father that just releasing Black and clearing the charges would help Harry in forgiving the house of Potter. His father had merely sneered and said the house of Malfoy didn’t bow to weakling such as Potter. But since his suggestion both his parents and Grandfather had been having discussions that abruptly stopped if he got within earshot. These conversations made Draco suspect that Lord Black had had an accident while under guard. It would suite Michalis’s words of power hungry, and the furious anger that was Harry was holding. The ominous silence from house Potter also set his father on edge, and if he was honest, everyone Draco encountered. This silence unnerved Draco as well, if for a different reason. The others seemed to believe that this silence meant that the house of Potter would let the slight go without repercussions. Draco knew that silence from Harry meant that he was plotting and that his revenge would be epic.
“Of course, as you wish Lord Potter, here is your abilities test.” Complies Sharptooth.
"I'm afraid I don't know what you are talking about, what have I supposedly done this time." Harry blandly asked allowing his mask to fall into place.
"Well," answered a Slytherin 7th year "and don't get me wrong I'm not trying to be mean but it's complicated and somewhat all jumbled up in Wizengamot secrecy laws as well. We can't just give you a straight answer."
“A little while ago, Draco and I were speaking about names. It started out as a conversation about baby names-” Harry began.
"Exactly." She grinned. "Your mind had certain expectations and Harry hasn't met them yet."
A few days later, Pansy got her opening. She was walking through the halls with Harry and Draco on the way to a class the three of them shared when they heard a strange sound.
Malfoy interrupted her by grumbling. “It’s not a convenience if we can’t have the children it was supposed to create.”
“Sew-ana?” Lyra frowned and shook her head.
"Anyway..." Harry blushed and finished his explanation. "I go to university for psychology - where I met Michelle - and I found a reputable mind healing course through St. Mungo's so I'll be able to bridge the gap between the muggle world and the magical."
When he entered the small store, Harry saw the elderly man speaking with Remus look at him with wide eyes.
“Now watch this…” Draco winked at her. “No, Teddy; Uncle Draco wants to hold you. Come to me.”
“I’d imagine it has to do with having a pregnant spouse and three children under five years old to help care for.” Harry commented sadly knowing Andy would’ve likely thought to save him from any unnecessary work.
She nodded. "That would be great; thanks, Potter – erm – Malfoy-Potter."
"Why? What did you think we would name them? James and Lily?" Draco scoffed.
“While you are putting on your costume, I’ll clean the cock cage so we can put it back on later.” Harry smiled at his slave before patting the top of Draco’s head and turning around.
"For many years Dobby’s ancestors lived happy in bond with the Malfoy family..." The elf explained while wringing his hands. "But then he- who- must- not- be- named rose to power and young master Draco’s grandfather fell for lies and began to practice black magic. It corrupted him and he soon be treating elves differently to how he’d been taught. Dobby’s father broke the bond but Master Abraxas Malfoy found his hiding place and used the spell to enslave. Father to son such tales are passed on."
Luna giggled as her hair fell over her eyes. "I think we should go for a walk, Ginny."
Draco involuntarily bit his lip when his breathing hitched. “Yeah...just like that...” The blond just barely held back an aroused whimper. “Say something else?”
After a few more minutes, Lucius and Narcissa made an announcement for everyone to find their spouse because the midnight countdown would begin in thirty seconds. Harry stared into Draco’s silver eyes as their guests shouted the last ten seconds around them. As soon as he heard Ron shout ‘one’ from his position next to them, Harry’s lips were tenderly pressing down on Draco’s.
The party was nearly as large as the one that had heralded the first year of their marriage. Once again they were announced and once again the happy couple led the dancing. When it came time, Harry did the honors.
The look on Harry's face was pure happiness as he reached out in return and they walked up to their dorm in content silence.
Having noticed that his wand was looking battered, Harry had gotten a wand-care kit from Ollivander’s at Diagon Alley. Along with the kit, Mr. Ollivander gave him a new holster; it was black with silver fastenings and matched his outer robes perfectly. It was also warded so that only the owner could release the catch, which Harry thought was a rather helpful aspect.
“So if I’d come to you this afternoon, having agreed to Harry’s idea...” Draco posed.
Draco moaned as the edge of his desk bit into the back of his thighs. “Only you…Only you can overpower me like this, Harry!”
Ron had decided to train as an Auror while Hermione would stay home until Angelica turned one. Ginny was conflicted because she had twins to care for and didn’t want to leave her mother in the lurch but what she really wanted to do was play Quidditch professionally. Dean wasn’t thrilled with her choice of profession but he promised he’d support her in her dreams while he joined Ron in training for the Auror Corp. George would continue running Weasleys Wizarding Wheezes with the help of his wife and several other members of the family. Bill remained a curse breaker for Gringott’s but also spent a fair amount of time at WWW, while Fleur – who was pregnant again – would be a stay at home mother helping Molly care for her multitude of grandchildren. Penelope Weasley gave birth to Herod Gideon on the sixteenth and Percy happily went back to his Ministry job as Shacklebolt’s personal assistant.
Draco chuckled. The babble meant Harry was nervous and that meant the gift would be something fun with no real purpose. He pulled the paper off and what he found was amazing. “A chocolate snitch?”
“Alright, dear; I’m sorry.” She nodded and began to eat her Belgian waffle which was covered in fresh berries.
“Yes, Dinki, I buried him in a beautiful place,” he whispered. “There was a lovely hill overlooking the beach at a place called Sh- Oh, I forgot it’s still under the Fidelius charm. Don’t worry; I’ll take you there sometime soon.”
“So that’s how it happened! I always wondered why Father was so angry with you after second year. He only told Mother and I that he’d given one of our elves clothes and it was your fault but he never would say why.” Draco shook his head when Harry finished telling him about saving Ginny from Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets and freeing Dobby the house elf from Malfoy service.
“None of your business, Ron!” Harry laughed. “I think that’s a little personal, don’t you?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I believe you know Draco Malfoy?”
"Ye can call me Mac. Nearly all the magical visitors do."  Mac said quietly, scratching his short graying beard. "Now, I don't precisely know what yer purpose is... so I can't rightly give adequate advice."
Harry glared at him playfully. “If we got married on Halloween, that gives us a month to ‘court’, giving my in-laws the illusion of tradition.”
“The school has quite a few elves – that’s true - but they’re supposed to take care of the students and faculty and Marcus’ elf is hard pressed to care for the ones in his charge so we will not be adding another to his list. Kreacher will assist me best by taking care of you…” Harry’s voice took on a hard tone. “And you will let him.”
“Remember how I looked through all three of the windows?” Harry answered her as soon as Draco once again took his hand. “Well, I noticed that there didn’t seem to be any wildlife beyond the line of starfish going out through the center. Then on the left side I saw a fish swim up to avoid something and then down the other side...of nothing. It had to be an object that fish can see but is invisible to humans.”
The brunette came up close to his husband. “True…but I don’t…because I much prefer your touch to my own…”
Narcissa had stayed quiet as she watched this byplay. “Thank you, Harry; I’d been trying to get him to eat better for a long while.”
“Feels…” Draco took a moment to gauge the oddly pleasant feeling on his overly sensitive nipples and nodded. “Oh, Harry… Salazar... so good!”
“I’d actually said ‘I wish you could take me with you’,” Draco told him. “He – I was horrified by the things he was doing and I knew that in his insanity he’d turn on us sooner or later. I went back to school after our punishment with the resolve to never return to the Manor. I figured I could appeal to Father and Mother to live on my own – preferably here or another of our houses; but if they said no…I didn’t know what I’d do.”
"All the more reason, then." Dean smiled sadly at his old friend. "You'd know what to do or say to make the kids feel at ease. You'd be careful not to prejudice them toward or against any particular house..."
The boys had talked for what seemed like ages about the differences between muggle and magical sweets when Ron and Hermione walked by the window.
The pregnant man stared. “You’d do that? Give up a day of work to come out with me to an appointment at the healer?”
During the meal, Ginny and Luna told Molly all about Raven's Roost and she told the whole group about the plans Bill and Charlie had made since coming home from their jobs. Charlie was happy to be home but was hoping to get his own apartment in the nearby town while Bill had been made head of his fellow curse breakers at Gringotts and was looking to find a life companion before choosing a place to share.
Draco huffed but agreed and motioned to the others who dutifully swore themselves to secrecy about the rest of their adventures that day.
Harry snorted as he rolled to the side and stood. “Sorry. Here, let me help you up.”
“Lie down on the table, Harry.” Draco said softly.
Draco smiled and stood up. He stretched and walked into the bathroom, noticing that Harry was following him.
That's when he noticed it. A small trunk peeked out from under the bed. As he lifted the corner of the quilt, Harry saw an embroidered HH but ignored it in favor of the trunk.
The room went so silent that Harry was sure he would hear a pin if it dropped.
Harry caught him and lifted the boy into the air. He spun around quickly and by the time he’d set Teddy back on his feet their eyes matched too. “You look like a miniature of me!”
Harry took a deep breath. “And then, we heard the bushes rustling.”
for something...” Harry frowned feeling as though he shouldn’t be talking about Draco like he’s not there.
“Dobby knew.” Harry murmured.
The blond flicked his gaze to the right side, not meeting their eyes. “Well, Viktor tried to catch me, you see ...but m-my arm slipped...and I fell anyway. My neck hurts too.”
“Some of us do visit the Manor, dear boy.” A haughty older woman spoke up from a frame Harry didn’t recall ever seeing occupied.
“I’ve seen him freeze water, Blaise. He’s not delusional.” Draco frowned. “As for my uncle, I’m not really sure. He’s gotten a lot less crazy since he came back. He might not want total world domination anymore. If he does, Harry can’t join forces with him.”
He mounted the broom and took off, gaining speed and height with every second. It didn’t take long before he was diving down onto the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch. As he’d thought, his friend and godson were waiting for him at the center of the green expanse.
A moment later the door opened and, when Draco saw Harry, he brought his hand up to touch the collar Harry had placed there and gasped, “You’re here.”
After an hour of walking the grounds with her and just talking, she took him to Hogsmeade for dinner and gave him his gifts. She asked to meet Harry officially but Draco wasn't sure if his boyfriend was ready for that yet so he told her to be patient and they'd try to arrange something after graduation.
“I’ll make them now.” The bushy-haired girl nodded.
She went on to say other flattering words about him but Draco’s mind got stuck on the word
It was Hogwarts! But it wasn’t like he’d seen it recently.
Pansy gave them clothing for the babies as well as a set of formal traveling luggage.
Lucius looked at his son. “You lament this?”
Draco moaned, knowing it probably wouldn’t take long.
“Oh, really? ‘Well, sort of’ isn’t good enough for me.” Harry grumped.
Lucius barely restrained an eye-roll as he called the elves.
"Harry? What's going...on...?" Sirius asked as he stepped into the brightly colored room. He looked down at his still giggling godson and nodded before trying to explain.
Harry untied the ropes from his slave’s wrists and helped the blond stand before turning him and wrapping the rope around them again – this time together instead of apart. Then, Harry pushed him to his knees, “Look up, slut.”
Snape was silently staring at him.
“Wednesday.” Draco nodded.
"Don't be silly, Harry. I told them not to bother you." Dumbledore shook his head. "You had so much on your mind when you left school and I thought you could do with some peace and quiet."
Draco’s wide-eyed expression and minuscule nod encouraged him to continue so Harry decided to respect Draco’s ‘of age’ status by addressing him directly.
If it was possible, Teddy got even more excited. That’s when Harry noticed that his godson’s hair hadn’t changed once in the whole time since the group had arrived.
“A good friend wouldn’t take advantage like that, Teddy.” Draco placed a hand on his cousin’s knee. “I value the part I already have in his life and I don’t want to jeopardize that.”
/*/*/*/*/*
“Oh, Harry...” Hermione suddenly bit her lip. “Well...just as long as you don’t make any overtures of a romantic nature, Harry...at least until they break up.”
Glaring at the older man, Harry skimmed over his discovery of Dumbledore’s lies and manipulations before getting to the question. "The goblins found spells and potions in my system that had kept my full potential bound all these years." Harry swung his gaze to the man he'd known as a potion master. "Their healer had to perform a ritual and give me a potion to fix the damage."
Harry followed Garnett over to the counter and watched the man pull out three forms. He wrote down several notes on each one before handing them to Harry.
Draco nodded his understanding.
“I simply requested a few items from his vaults as part of the contract.” Lucius smirked devilishly.
Draco grinned at them and nodded. “Yes. Grandma and Dinki will take you to the Manor.”
"It sounds like a clearing in the forest." Draco murmured as the last of his dinner disappeared with the plates. "Was there anything there?"
"She was told only because her father tried to get us betrothed." Draco explained. "I know that my father put him off for a while, but after my powers began to manifest, they decided that there were too many unknowns to set something like that in motion."
"Dobby was called Donny yesterday, sir." Dobby looked at the floor sadly. "And he asked after Wonky's health. We was planning to ignore it because he is quite old."
Harry shook his head. “Do you need us or can I take Draco back to our rooms?”
"Knew what?" Dean asked, startled at such a response.
"Hmm..." Harry mused. "That's an idea. I'll think about that but along those lines, Luna is Ravenclaw and, therefore, air. She's been supportive if a bit cryptic."
“And I will…” Draco assured him. “Uhmmm, Harry? I know this isn’t the ideal situation, but do you think you could do me a small favor?”
“You’re going to be poking around in a very private place,” Draco snarked. “I’d think you could use my name.”
"It'll be ok, Draco." Harry reached out his hand, hoping Draco would take it. "We can handle it...together."
Draco froze and glanced up at the other boy who was grinning as he chewed.
The second floor held a telescope and a large table with star charts along with an awe inspiring mural of Raven's Roost. As the group watched, a young woman swam in the water with a beautiful creature that Harry and Luna knew was Nessie the hippocampus.
"As far as I know, your needs involving the ministry are the most pressing but if that changes...”  Percy eyed the young lord and his youngest brother as they arrived at Sigmund's door. “I will, of course, consider helping out in other areas as well. Agreed?"
“Welcome to the family, Caelum Orion Malfoy-Potter,” Lucius said softly.
The blond turned as he tried to stand but stopped when Harry’s voice smoothly commanded him.
“I don’t know if this happens with all of them or just mine – Harry gave me one too – but when Harry put it on me it felt like I was being held in a tight hug.” Draco blushed slightly at this admission. “I suggested the leopard for you, Mother.”
“Then I’ll have Kreacher go shopping while we snack on nachos.” The older woman was happy to make her nephew happy.
Slowly, Draco licked up the salt, washed it down with the shot and took the lime from Harry’s lips as the brunette swayed in place. Harry looked amazing this way. Draco loved seeing him so free and wild. “Your turn...”
“I need to see you before you meet with Potter.” Draco quickly reported. “I told you what happened on the train but I had a meeting with him today which ran quite long.”
Seamus’ eyes widened as he understood. He nodded and grinned. “Well, that’s lovely! Cadence Etamina. I’m sure she’ll be a sweet little thing.”
"Yes." Harry cast a tempus charm. "Dobby?"
“And you were mentioned too, Father,” Draco smirked mischievously.
“Well, if you take care of me then who takes care of you?” Teddy asked as his hair turned dark like Harry’s.
“Yes, Andy was disowned by the Black family…” She admitted. “But while we are no longer Blacks by name; we are still Blacks by blood and I have missed her. Do you think she’ll accept an invitation to join us this evening?”
“Luna mentioned it yesterday when she and Blaise visited with their son but we only got ours this morning.” Ron said.
“Oh dear! I cannot imagine this kind of thing happening at our magical school.” Starla had a hand to her chest by the end of his retelling of their fourth year. She shivered at the thought of a wizard out for her blood and that was nothing compared to participating in such a dangerous contest as this Tri-Wizard Tournament. They fell quiet for a few moments before a chime rang and Starla stood and held out her hand. “Well, that chime means that my next appointment should be here soon…”
George piped up. "It's only the second day we've been here."
"How urgent is this need?" Snape asked.
“So it’s just physical, Potter?” Draco asked, gritting his teeth.
"Where did you go?" Dudley asked them knowing they'd never answer if Harry asked.
Harry got low to the ground and seemed to skim the grass as he reached forward.
Finally dressed and ready for the day, Harry went out to the sitting room and into his office where he’d last seen the beautiful ghost.
“What happened in there, Father? Why is your shirt wet?” Draco asked quietly.
"Do you punish her?" Hermione asked contemptuously.
Madam Pomfrey breathed a sigh of relief and went off to tell the Headmistress that her patient would be back in class the next day.
"You should tell Kingsley. That way there's no need for a ministry official to interrupt your first married weekend with an inquiry." She suggested slipping her hand into Ron's.
The elf bowed low as his masters disappeared.
They entered the station and hurried through to their platform. Once there, the famous couple said their farewells to Lucius and Narcissa and boarded the train with Pansy.
"Have you thought of any names?"
A sly smirk came to Olgok's face and he turned around. "What about your hearing?" He whispered; his volume just above a breath.
"Dean, I want to dance some more." Ginny said with a smile. Her husband couldn't get up quickly enough, but they didn't go in the direction of the dance-floor.
Harry stared at his friend. He felt a bit warm, all of a sudden as he watched Draco’s throat convulse around the liquid he’d swallowed... swallowed...what would it feel like to see Draco swallow something else?
Harry pulled the fabric back to reveal a bedroom with an elegant canopy bed set against the wall with a matching nightstand. A family portrait hung above a delicate writing table and Harry walked silently over to look closer. A woman in her thirties stood behind two children; a girl sitting in a chair and a young boy at her feet.
Draco took note of his godfather's eyes as they settled on Harry. He watched the older man approach their group and wasn't surprised to hear the deep voice ask him for a word. Standing up, Draco moved off to the side and asked what he wanted.
“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing to the necklace Salazar’s wife was wearing.
"That’s a great idea, Professor, and if I may... I'd like to request that Neville be involved with this project." Harry replied respectfully. "He's got a great instinct for herbology. He'd likely find it fascinating as well as enjoyable."
"Alright then, I think we should enjoy each other's company and talk before deciding what direction to go next. Ok?" Harry asked.
“Oh. I just saw him in the hallway and said hello.” Harry smirked back. “No wonder he seemed a little taken aback.”
"I'm not the only Slytherin, Harry." Draco reminded him.
"I need to get his information but I don't know if I can trust him." Harry told the blond.
Draco’s breath caught – that meant he had to crawl, “Yes, Master,” he said softly before placing the papers in his mouth and lowering his hands to the floor. He crawled across the floor to Astoria’s chair and handed the contracts to her. Meeting her eyes was difficult for him to do, but he did it for a moment before lowering his hands again and making his way back to his Master’s side.
"Gryffindors in both house and ancestry. All of them have something they're passionately fired up about." Harry smiled as he thought them over. "Ron has that short fuse and a hot, violent temper."
"I don't think you understand me very well, cousin." Harry sighed. "I may be an earl, but I only have this position because I lost my family at a young age. Therefore, I value them highly and desire to keep them safe and in good health."
Draco watched from the doorway in fascination as Harry held a sibilant conversation with the poisonous creature.
Narcissa looked intently at her son who had a somewhat smug expression as he continued to eat his egg and salsa concoction. Thinking she understood what they were saying, she gasped.
“Yes, she’s got a special dispensation because she’s going to train as an auror.” Hermione’s lips twisted into an ugly pinched expression.
“They told me everything they could.” Percy admitted quietly, glancing between Harry and his two siblings. “Including that Dumbledore is suspected to have had a hand in things.”
“And that, my friends, is what I learned here at Hogwarts.” Harry replied sarcastically. “I can honestly say that I've had very little positive adult influence in my few years of life and even less of an example of favorable Slytherin influence. I find myself in desperate need of it now. Will you help me?”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
“I’m mostly over Marion’s death anyway, it’s been so long. So, I’ve written a letter telling them to send me the list of available women,” Marcus shrugged.
"You were the first wizard I met who was my age, Draco." Harry said softly. "You've challenged me, which is exhilarating. You've frightened and angered me...water changes for the occasion. You've already changed from what I knew."
"Do you know where it came from?" She asked.
During the month before their ceremony, the two young men had taken the opportunity to date and become affectionate with each other, so Harry knew what Draco was asking. Harry’s reaction to this was to duck into the nearest empty classroom and gather Draco into his arms. “I know it’s scary, Dray. I know you’re nervous. I’m not very experienced either. I’ve had one time as a bottom and it was nice but I’ve told you that I prefer to top. I’ve learned, over the past few weeks, what you’ll like and hate. I know how to give you pleasure, Draco. Please trust me...”
“He wanted to be the one in control.” Draco felt calm enough to listen.
Harry moved his lips to the pulse point of his husband’s wrist and licked delicately.
"I see." Harry nodded sadly. Apparently, the betrayal of friends was not uncommon in his family. "So Dudley's classes begin tomorrow."
"I did not!" Draco protested.
Ron hurried his wife inside before ushering Harry and Draco in the door. "Mum and Dad's room is bigger and down the hall from the kitchen and living room but now there's a room across from theirs." He put Harry's hand on the knob and motioned for his friend to open the door.
“Well, I’ll tell our circle that you’re home. I’m sure some of them were friends of yours.” Harry took the papers and smiled. “I’ll just fill these out so we can go.”
"In my first year, I caught Professor Quirrell trying to steal the sorcerer's stone and stopped him... no thanks to the adults in my life who didn't believe me when I warned them it was in danger. In my second year, I fought and killed a basilisk when the adults couldn't figure out what was going on or how to stop it!" Harry railed. "Third year, I was being hunted by an escaped murderer and, not only did I survive, but I found out the truth! He wasn't a murderer at all! He was my godfather and he needed saving!"
"It's amazing." Sirius smiled. "I don't have to look down at you anymore, pup!"
His hair turned white for just a second before he forced it to go blue. “Not bad. I mean, the three of us have such fun together and all.”
With a shrug, Harry shook the minister’s hand. “Good to see you. Would you care to join us for dinner?”
"What? Why?" Harry asked, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
"Why'd you request Malfoy?" Ron whined.
Harry noticed that Draco’s blond hair was back...a reminder of bygone days, it also reminded Harry that things that change can sometimes come back. The wand in Draco’s hand wasn’t pointed at anything in particular but Harry remained cautious until his boyfriend laid it on the table and simply asked to be held. Harry took him into the bedroom and laid down beside him.
"He did." Tom filled in the blanks. "He sold it to himself under a secret identity before faking his death. The locket is with him."
"As Draco does?" Lucius asked lightly, though he was quite surprised.
"Well no but..." Harry admitted in confusion.
“Bill and Fleur have decided on Victoria Adelaide for their daughter while Charlie and Gus will have a son named Corvus Frederick.” Harry smiled when he saw Pansy stick her tongue out at the blond. “Aww, that’s sweet – naming him after Fred.”
Of course it drew the attention of her Masters. “Little Master said something, Masters.”
"Of course; it'll be good practice." She laughed.
Harry grinned at him. "Good, now let's go out there and finish this nonsense."
Pansy lifted her head and fixed her gaze on Harry. “Blaise will be joining us.”
“He is - I just don’t know if I can trust Slughorn.” Harry suddenly grinned. “Actually, now that I think about it, I’m pretty sure Draco’s searching Slytherin now.”
Harry felt a slight weight lift from his shoulders as he realized it was true. “That’s right.”
After they collapsed, Harry smiled at the exhausted blond. “So beautiful…”
"Fine." Harry rolled his eyes. "I had a feeling this might happen." He pulled out a familiar bit of parchment and laid it on the bed. He showed Fred and George that it was blank and bowed to his godfather.
“It bloody well does affect me!” Harry hissed at the infuriating blond. “You’re soon to be my husband and the father, erm, mother – or something – of my child! Our child needs you to be healthy!”
"Well yeah, but who's suffering? Me or him?" Harry asked sarcastically before sighing and adjusting his requested order. "Two packs of droobles, a licorice wand and a chocolate assortment."
“Tell me I heard you wrong, Ted.” She demanded. “You’re not really going to attempt this?”
"What opportunity, Ron?" Harry understood making renovations and repairs but had no idea what Ron was talking about. The group got out of the car and began to circle the house.
"I don't know..." Blaise frowned. "I've always had a theory..."
“Please tell me it’ll be like that every time?” The blond asked looking up at him.
The ceiling was apparently charmed to be transparent because they could see the fish and merpeople going about their lives. The bed was luxurious but so was the rest of the matching furniture which included a desk, a large wardrobe, a nightstand, and a bookcase. Torches lit up when they detected movement.
Harry cast Accio and handed his husband the jar. “Here, love…” Since they’d gotten home from the holiday stay at the manor, Draco had insisted on being more involved with the twins’ daily activities and Harry had let him but the pregnancy was beginning to take its toll and he’d soon have to insist that his husband get more rest.
Draco moans became desperate as he voiced his submission. “You, Harry! I need you!”
“Who are you and what are you doing here?” Harry demanded of the small creature.
Harry went home after Hermione convinced him that nothing could be done until tomorrow. He was thoroughly resolved to say something to Draco the very next time he saw him.
They fell silent for a moment as the band began to play. There were a few fast songs in a row and Draco pulled Harry onto the dance floor just in time for the music to slow down.
“He also taught Harry to dance. I’m thankful to him for that.” Draco chuckled and squeezed Harry’s hand before using the other hand to absently stroke his belly.
"I swear, Ron; you have the emotional range of a teaspoon!" Harry sighed with obvious exasperation, knowing that Hermione would've been fascinated by the story that seemed to be confusing Ron. "Nessie was her friend...or maybe like a pet... anyway, Nessie's illusion now only shows itself to people who have magical ability. So, we put the chest back where it was but the spells hiding the cove were incredibly complicated so we copied the book before putting it back and I've asked Remus to help me learn them in case it comes up in the future."
“Magic?”
.          Andromeda didn’t say anything; she just confiscated the now empty bowl of salad from Teddy’s head. It seemed that he decided it, and all of its contents, would make a perfect hat. She picked him up from the high chair and pointed out the window to the owl coming closer. “That’s the post; it’s been coming in late recently. Would you grab it while I bathe Teddy? I’m expecting a coupon for Madam Malkin’s.” She took Teddy to the upstairs bathroom.
“Oh…what are you majoring in?”
“Yes,” Harry replied. It wasn’t as if “Draco” was a common name.
Harry picked up the cigarette butt and handed it to Malfoy. “Don’t litter.”
he would choose the same college that Malfoy had chosen. Of
"Really?" Harry's mood picked up.
“I’m fine,” Harry replied. “What happened to the course?”
"It's for me, too," Harry related.
“Let’s eat at Nando’s.”
[Very good!]” she shrieked. “Ça va? [You're doing well?]” She kissed him on the cheek.
“Woah,” he said. “That’s…a lot of money.”
"C'mon, little man. We can play tomorrow," Ron piped up. Teddy absolutely
“Pourquoi? [Why?]” Teddy asked.
Draco laughed a little. He continued, “My father’s going to Azkaban and Voldemort moving Death Eaters into our home really changed everything. I grew depressed and terrified, but Mother always assured me that everything would benefit me. That all
“To be fair,” Harry countered. “Neither do I.”
“Of course. Thank you so much.”
Harry did as she asked, but he did not quite participate in the conversation. The two women fluttered in and out between French and English, and seemed to talk about everything: ranging from politics to family to food and more.
They finally reached the counter after what felt like forever.
“Soy su vecino. Si le gustaría vivir aquí, NO puede hacer mucho ruido o dejar la basura o—“
Harry checked his items out and left the store. After that, he apparated to Hogsmeade. Before taking off his cloak, Harry prepared himself for the soon-to-come surge of wizarding press. He took off his cloak, folded it and put it into his bag, and stepped into the sunlight. He walked for a total of two minutes, amazingly enough, without anyone noticing him until one man glanced up and spotted Harry’s glasses and scar.
Harry smiled. He corrected, “Nah. I wasn’t in the wreck. This scar is an…er—a birth mark.”
…he still hasn’t been a good person in the past.”
“Kosher, mate,” Harry responded. “The Jewish term is kosher, and making fun of it makes you a bit anti-Semitic. And really, with a Muslim friend, you should really know what ‘halal’ means.”
Harry checked for the owl again. He had been waiting on his official class schedule to come in, but he still wasn’t sure that it would arrive on time. Andromeda had decided to get a post box for any muggle mail that may come in, especially for Harry, and that their owl Mercury would get the mail from the post box every night after the post ran. That meant that Harry wouldn’t get the official schedule until the day
“Harry!”
“Stop fucking throwing the rock, and you won’t have to do this every night.” She smiled and punched his arm in a playful way.
In Psych, he took color-coded notes (something he’d learned from Malfoy) and made footnotes so that he could record what the teacher said. In English, he printed out the PowerPoints, took notes, and actually answered the professor’s questions. He supposed that reading the book actually did pay off.
Draco shrugged. He commented, “Dunno. I know that they liked the American east coast.”
Currently, he has skimming his Advanced Charm Theory notes, simultaneously attempting to decipher his own handwriting. He’d only made it through one chapter when he decided to check the clock.
He worked on the turkey and smoked until 5AM. At that time, he got out his homework. Because the semester was almost over, an air of tension was spread concerning finals week. Normally, Harry would not have cared yet and would have begun studying a few days before exams; however, all of his professors had assigned final projects that were worth about as much as the exams themselves.
“Oh,” Harry said, laughing internally. He asked, “So, what’s the agenda?”
that had come his way.
Harry briefly had the childish thought,
“It’s terrifying how far technology has come.”
“I’m good. You ready for today?”
Harry spent the rest of the day switching among spending time with Teddy and Andromeda, doing homework, reading, and sleeping. He was almost anticipating the day’s end because he had developed a strong nervous energy.
Harry shrugged. "I've got a meeting with the headmistress to discuss my becoming a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor."
Draco grunted in frustration. He lowered his voice, “No one wants me there.”
Harry wanted to go to one so badly. She pointed out that, even if he didn't want to be an auror, he could still have any job in the wizarding community. However, Harry didn't want to stay in the wizarding community. Ever since he left auror training, he hadn't been able to escape the wizarding press whenever he went to
How have you been? I haven’t heard much from you in the past month. The Daily Prophet has reported that you’re going to a muggle university, but I don’t believe much of what they say. How is Teddy? And Andromeda?
“She has helped me a lot, and, recently, she’s been asking me to reflect on my life and myself and my...er...relationships.”
“Sorry,” the blond force a smile. “I always need a smoke after I eat.” Like Harry, he was carrying a mug filled with coffee.
“Mozzarella sticks,” Harry admitted, causing both men to laugh.
He was even more confused. Was he floating? He looked down. He was on his broom!
“Parce que! [Because!]” replied Andromeda, tickling Teddy. She turned her attention to Harry, “So, how was school today? See anyone you know?”
Harry scoffed, “How childish.”
“Where were you born?” a brunette asked.
"I thought that, um," Draco mumbled to Harry. "It resembles both Gryffindor red and your eye color's green. I thought that it would—"
“Do you feel sorry?”
“How many did we serve tonight?” Fab asked.
you. Why are you talking to me?"
"Okay. That doesn't sound like anything we can fix. Magic is known to negatively influence the effects of muggle medicine like Ambien, so I don't think we'll use that. I suggest monitoring your caffeine intake, and maybe you can try drinking some decaffeinated herbal tea. The dry mouth will probably either stay or slowly go away. There's not much we can do about that though," the therapist noted. She glanced up at Harry after every couple of words she wrote down.
“I’m sorry,” Harry quickly proclaimed.
"So, how's life?" Harry asked them.
“I know that you didn’t come out here to compliment me or to talk about your sexual preference.”
Harry knew when he’d had the second nightmare that he’d sleep through his first alarm. He knew when he woke up and paced around his flat for an hour or two that he’d sleep through his second alarm. He did not know, however, that he’d sleep through
“Oh,” Harry sighed and faked disappointment. “I suppose.”
“But the breadsticks are amazing!” Harry exclaimed.
"Dear me, look at the time! Well, I can't be late for Political Science. We can chat later, Potter. Good bye!"
Draco and Harry moved back inside a few minutes later. They sat in the living room and conversed with Andromeda and Narcissa for an hour before Draco excused himself for another smoke. Harry decided that it would be the perfect chance to corner him.
“Haha, yeah,” Draco replied. Harry noticed that the other man was definitely faking a good mood. “It’s a savior when one can’t sleep.”
“Are we here? Oh, thank God,” Draco sighed with relief.
“But you liked him,” Fab added. Draco sneered at her. She giggled and ran away.
"Oh, I dunno. They don't have a 3D printer, but there
In Psychology, he had a fifteen page research paper and thirty slide presentation on one metal illness. In English, he had a twenty page paper comparing and contrasting two works of British contemporary literature from the syllabus. In Criminal Justice, he had to design his own two-hundred question practice exam complete with three (answered) essay questions. In Algebra, he had to list every formula used in the classroom, as well as the meanings of the variables. In Earth Science, he had a ten page (fifteen source minimum) research paper. In World History, he had to write three five-page essays from a given list of options. And in French, he had to research current French culture and present in French. All were due the second week of December and Harry had not even started them.
“Thank you,” the blond said.
“Really?” Ron said, slamming his fork down. “Aronowitz? You know he doesn’t allow any pork around him! It’s not halal or gluten free or whatever. I can’t work with someone who doesn’t like bacon!”
“Andromeda! Non, je mange assez. [No, I eat enough.]”
Ron threw the towel at Harry’s face.
She didn’t look convinced. “Look, I want you to finish that, then get some rest. Okay?”
Draco lifted his arms, palms up, in an unsure manner.
I had a fantastic time last night and I am truly exhausted. Thank you so much for inviting me to dinner.
“Oh,” Draco replied, “He, uh, I went to school with him. We didn’t really get along well, so I was surprised to see him.”
They stood around awkwardly for a few minutes until Malfoy spoke up, “Our...uh...English class is halfway over.”
.          Teddy reached towards Malfoy, attempting to close the gap between the blond and Andromeda. He grabbed a fistful of Malfoy’s hair. Malfoy, who had obviously never been around a child like this before, tensed up. He looked up at the toddler’s fist.
He was about to slip on his coat when he heard Andromeda say, “Harry, black shoes, black tie, and brown belt? Shoes, tie, and belt
was brought up, Harry noticed that Andromeda stuffed her mouth with food, Narcissa blushed profoundly, and Draco winced. It was 6:30 PM when Harry finally excused himself for a cigarette. He grabbed a cup of coffee and relocated to the back porch. He was halfway finished with his cigarette when the door opened again. Draco stepped out.
drugs?”
Harry was shocked. He'd never heard her curse before.
Seamus and Dean burst out in laughter.
Draco handed the presents out, and not one person was left out—not even Narcissa. Harry held his gift that looked to be wrapped in the muggle way. Everyone else's were in bags. They all opened their presents.
Harry was pretty excited. For the past year, he had lived with Andromeda Tonks and her grandchild, Teddy Lupin-- Harry’s godson. Of course, after the constant surge of cameras and wizarding press had died down, he decided to lie low.
“Well, chocolate chip brownies shaped like graves. We can even have little white chocolate ghosts!”
“What?”
“Well, I dunno. I think I was just overwhelmed and..and scared.”
Dinner was starting and Harry was very excited. Ever since seeing his old school friends, he was happy to spend time with people. He saw the joy on their faces when receiving their gifts and realized that giving
Ron and Harry were up next. Ron grabbed Harry’s arm and whispered in his ear, “If we blow the bloody first spell, we’re failing this activity for sure. I can’t believe the last team did that.”
“Don’t play dumb,” Malfoy said through clenched teeth. “My mother sent me a letter— after I tried to ignore her owls for so long, I just had to check this one— that declared that she had spoken to you and that you said that I don’t ‘look too healthy.’”
, [Hello,] Narcissa," he said. "
“Holy shit.”
She asked, “Why do you always do rock even though you know you’re gonna lose? You’re so predictable!”
When did Ginny learn that she was bi? When did Luna learn that she was pan?
“Mr. Potter, I got a question.”
“Like a friend, almost.”
“Stop shrugging! Answer my damn question!” Malfoy demanded.
It wasn’t that he was homophobic. He really, really wasn’t. He was just shocked. Neither Dean nor Seamus struck him as gay. And it wasn’t like he didn’t know it. He did! He was just…surprised. And shocked. And a little confused. Dean
At 2:40, the door started to sing. Harry wasn't sure why Andromeda charmed it to sing only for Halloween and Christmas, but he supposed that it didn't matter that much. He let Narcissa in and the door stopped its "Jingle Bells" solo.
“C’mon, Draco. What are you scared of?” Harry pushed.
“They look like Death Eaters to you, too, huh?” Harry asked, more so attempting to calm Malfoy down with small talk than expecting an answer.
“You multiply two sides,” the same girl declared.
Both men lined up behind their respective entrance points. They dropped their robes and took deep breathes. They ran in when the professor blew her whistle.
Harry smiled again. "I think that this is what I need to be doing."
The Weasleys were the hardest and that was because they were truly his family. After an hour, he bought some baby stuff from Carter’s for Bill and Fleur. They had announced a week before that they were expecting. He got George and Angelina a box of Dove chocolate. For Charlie, Harry purchased some movies about dragons. Finally, he got a small china set for Percy.    Yet, when Harry stepped out of Diagon Alley after buying every one’s wizarding presents, he felt like he’d forgotten something.
Harry shuddered, “Er-okay. I’ll just…be off then..” He turned and strutted away.
“Okay, Xavier, would you like to make the shots or the martinis?” Malfoy asked his companion. The trainee, Xavier, was clearly nervous about this new task.
"Draco."
Why did he always ruin everything?
“’Ladies: Step back. Harry likes men.”
“That’s fine.”
Harry took a deep breath. He could do this.
“Why don’t you want to?”
Ron’s arrival shook Harry out of his thoughts.
“Yeah,” Draco said.
“Longer than it’ll take me to eat it,” Ron replied. Harry rolled his eyes and scooted the bowl over to Ron. He watched as Ron took his first bite. He smirked as Ron immediately spat the bite out. “What the—? Spinach, mate? Who the bloody hell makes something with spinach and broccoli in it? Isn’t that, like, breaking thirty cooking rules?”
The first students started pouring in and Harry remained silent. If they wanted to notice him, they would. Some of the children put their bags away in their cubbies; some ran to greet Ms. Claire. It was a matter of seconds before the first kid saw Harry. Their eyes lit up, and Harry briefly worried that this kid recognized him from the wizarding world.
"Yeah," Harry replied, confused.
," he protested.
.          It was Harry’s turn to nod. He took his fork out of his lap and laid it on his plate. “Just…” he replied, “Don’t expect a reply from him. He can be very mean and cruel. Even if he’s not…
Draco untensed, as if he was afraid he'd made a mistake in his confession. The men locked eyes, and Harry knew that his life might not suck so much in the future as it had in the past.
He felt so silly. He wasn’t worried about impressing Draco before, so why did he have to worry now? The doorbell rang and Harry jumped. He shouted to Andromeda, “I’ll get it!”
"Andromeda," Harry spoke up. "How many batches do we
“Ah, I knew it,” Dean replied. “No, actually. I meant the rumors about you dropping out of auror training and attending a muggle university.”
Draco grabbed some cleaning supplies and made his way out to the main lobby. He smiled to himself. It wasn’t that he didn’t mind playing rock every night, but he just didn’t understand the game. It was Sally who taught it to him (his excuse for not knowing was that he had went to French boarding schools his entire life where the game simply didn’t exist), and it was also Sally who swore that it was a logic game. “Something has to beat something else and in turn be beaten by something else,” She would claim. Yet, that didn’t make sense to him because there is no way that paper could annihilate rock. It just wasn’t possible! He continued to think about the game and Sally while he wiped down tables and swept for the next hour and a half.
“What was your father’s sentence for Azkaban?”
“Same here.”
?” Harry asked.
“Do you have any more classes today?” Harry eventually asked.
Harry closed his eyes and took a break from his mixing. He opened them and sighed. He poured the vanilla and the rest of the ingredients into the bowl, continuing to cook.
, [One,] Ted i-was Italian. I can speak the language. So could Tonks.
“That’s…a broad sentence.”
to match.”
“Help me clean this, Fab!” he yelled after her.
“Of course.” She smiled and started eating her burger. “
Andromeda maintained her frown. She looked like she didn’t believe Harry at all, and that was fair. Harry was a shite liar when it came to her. Nevertheless, she replied, “All right. Well, don’t overwork yourself. You can only do so many all-nighters before your work suffers. I have you some food prepared in the fridge.”
"And one for me," Harry beamed. He turned back to Malfoy and his assistant. He whispered, "I'm trying to slow down." He giggled a bit and then blushed. Malfoy looked like he was trying to choose between barfing and laughing. Harry suddenly felt like an idiot. “Three…three martinis, please,” He repeated.
“I don’t ‘do’ meth! I only do coke and pills, but I got my last hit from a friend of Darren’s because I’m dumb as shit, and I didn’t think it through, and now I’m super high, and I don’t know what to do. What the hell do I do? Do you even do drugs? Do you even know anything
After that, he chugged two cups of black coffee and got out the ingredients for a pork roast. If he were to dress Teddy, dress himself, do last-minute cleaning, and cook dinner, he would have to start early. So, he cut up carrots and potatoes and pork until 9AM. At that time, he woke Teddy up and bathed him. The toddler didn’t make it an easy job and his squeals woke Andromeda at 9:30. She vacuumed and dusted, and Harry dressed Teddy up in his giraffe costume. Teddy seemed to like it because he’d often change his skin color to match the browns and yellows of the outfit.
Harry knew that he couldn’t say “Godric’s Hollow,” so he said, “Privet Drive.”
[Well, and you?]"
“But we’ve always…” Ron admitted.
“This is, like, the third that I’ve ever been in. To be truthful, I’m just winging it.”
She whispered, “What happened to you?” There was no malice in her voice. There was no anger or bitterness. There was only concern and curiosity. Draco didn’t know what to do. He forgot the bloody notes. He had no clue what to do.
The toddler awoke with a loud sound and looked around in confusion.
He just stared at her. How was this helping him not be high as hell? He
Hermione and Ron left an hour later and Harry was pretty relieved. He had needed a cigarette very badly. When he stepped out onto the back porch, he yet again found himself smoking with Draco Malfoy.
He groaned and replied, “Fine. Whatever. I’ll switch next time.” Sally smirked, and Draco stood on top of a bar stool behind the counter. He announced, “Everyone! Attention, everyone! We are officially closing tonight; everyone needs to have their bills paid and be out of here in fifteen minutes!” He got down from the stool and turned to Sally. In a hushed voice, he said, “Great. Now I’m everyone’s least favorite bartender.”
“Jerry
It was 11:50 PM according to the television that Harry, Draco, and Andromeda were watching, a recent addition to Andromeda's house. They were waiting for the ball to drop in NYC—which was silly because they weren’t Americans and it was actually 4:50 AM where they were. But Harry didn’t care.
Sincerely,
"No. I just missed my Algebra class."
They turned their heads to the right a little bit and moved in closer. They paused when they were close enough to breathe the same air. Draco looked up at Harry and they held each others' eyes for a second.
“Have you performed any dark or deadly or otherwise prohibited spells?”
“Draco, what the hell? Where were you? Xavier needs your help!” Fab yelled at him.
Harry shrugged and put his head on Draco’s shoulder.
So, at 4:30 PM, when Harry had arrived home, he ran straight to his room and changed. He put on some kakis, a mint green dress shirt, and a silver-black striped tie. With a sigh, Harry stepped out of his room and into the living room.
“Thank you, Professor. I knew that I couldn’t miss it, in the very least.” He smiled at her.
“Harry, it is crucial to your health and happiness.”
“sister. He is my nephew,” she sighed and became interested in her dinner plate. “Perhaps I should write to her.”
"Good evening, Harry. Please, come in," Headmistress McGonagall greeted him, interrupting his thoughts.
“Teddy,” Andromeda said in an attempt to control the child, “Teddy!
, of course.
.          “Would you like some tea?” Harry whispered to Andromeda, careful not to awaken the toddler.
“Malfoys don’t live that long. We tend to have health problems.”
After he paid for the sweets, Harry went to the Hog’s Head for a firewhiskey. Even though the bar was a refuge for sketchy wixen [AN* wixen is the gender neutral and plural form for wizards/witches], he could not avoid the press there. While he waited for his drink, twelve people came up to him and thanked him for his sacrifice. Harry didn’t quite mind, but it certainly didn’t feel great to have strangers tell him about their loved ones that died in the war.
When Harry apparated to his university’s campus, he arrived right next to a theater group’s small presentation. They were supposed to be the four horsemen: black capes, masks, and scythes. If one didn’t know any better, they might assume that these were Death Eaters. So, Harry just walked on and ignored the pangs of nervous sweat that ran down his neck.
Andromeda had opened her mouth to inform Narcissa of her son’s whereabouts, but Harry beat her, “He goes to the same uni as me,” he burst out. “Er...the University of Manchester.”
"Why has it grown so much?"
“What?” Draco giggled.
Narcissa blinked and asked, “A...muggle university?”
When she was close enough to the counter, she took a quick look back at her friend group, and then she leaned in towards Draco.
“Let’s not fight in the middle of Tiffany’s.”
Harry cursed under his breath. This really was not going how he wanted it to. He asked, “Well, you have problems sleeping, right?”
“Oh, well, they are. All the rumors are true. I am simultaneously shagging Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and apparently Mrs. Weasley,” Harry joked. He turned around to greet Dean but stepped back due to surprise. Dean was holding hands with Seamus, and both men were grinning at Harry.
He really liked Draco, but he wasn’t sure exactly
Harry had written Draco every day for nearly a month. They were definitely together, and Andromeda was definitely happy about it. She constantly asked about Draco and about their dates.
“Wh-what?”
“Because I miss my sister.”
“Then that’s that.”
TW insomnia, drugs, therapy/doctors, food, panic attacks
“Yeah, but Darren’s a little sick today, so he called out.”
They continued their walk to class in silence. It was a five minute wait before the professor walked in and called out, “Okay, who can tell me
“Hmm?” her eyebrows went up and she leaned forward, as if she had suddenly gone deaf.
Draco smiled. He spoke, "Is that scarf warm?"
"You know why."
"Of course," he muttered. "I forgot to set the alarm. Wait, it's
“I don’t…I don’t remember how to make a martini.”
"Andromeda? I thought that she had died in the war."
.          He hadn't thought of Malfoy at all since the incident at the university. No, he hadn't thought of Malfoy one bit. He certainly hadn't thought of Malfoy's surprisingly tight pants: muggle skinny jeans that Harry did not think would suit the man. He hadn't thought of his black band t-shirt either, showing off an apparent liking for Green Day. He hadn't thought of his swollen chipmunk-like cheeks or his calloused knuckles or bloodshot eyes. He hadn't thought of the strands of hair falling out when Teddy finally let go.
“Really?” he all but screamed. “There are five ingredients, and one of them is ice.”
Draco winced and looked down at his dinner. Harry’s face flushed and he felt like disappearing.
alarm except for the one he set up to sound just ten minutes before class began. He had no clue how he’d slept in until nearly 2PM, but here he was, trying to figure out exactly what to do. He decided to skip his usual coffee and cigarette, instead simply dressing, fetching his books, and apparating to the class’s building. He left the dark corridor and jogged to his classroom.
"I can handle
"It's because you fucked up your sleeping schedule. I do it all the time,. Yeah, naps keep the insomniac alive, but at what cost?"
After lunch, Harry chose to sit in his room and think about the night’s events. It was true: he was concerned about the kiss. Harry really liked Draco, and if he didn’t realize it before the kiss, he definitely realized it after the kiss.
Harry was growing impatient. It had been a week since he almost brought up the kisses to Draco and they still hadn’t talked about it. What annoyed Harry the most was his sudden lack of bravery. He’d had three classes with Draco since last Friday and he
The waiter arrived with their drinks and took their orders. When he left, Draco asked, “So, what had the Boy Who Lived been up to before university?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed.
Draco tidied up his room, placing the newly washed duvet on his mattress. He folded his blankets and placed them on top of the bed. He was quite proud of himself: after trying to get clean, he finally calculated all the money that he had spent towards drugs and booze. He wasn’t happy that he was spending over 80% of his paycheck on it, but he was happy that this now meant that he could actually furnish his apartment. The bed platform that he bought was simple, and it came from ASDA, but it still made a huge difference between “cocaine addict’s bedroom” and “finally getting shit together through décor.” He bought himself some new clothes, and he got his cats some toys and expensive food, too. Life seemed different. It almost seemed peaceful.
Harry
“Wh-why is that? Is he eating enough? Sleeping enough? Is he taking care of himself?”
Ginny.”
“Well,” he responded. “I was always very intrigued with wizarding history because of Professor Binns at Hog-“ Harry practically choked on his drink. Draco turned to him in alarm and asked, “Oh my God, are you okay?”
He read it aloud, “Introduction to the Study of Religions and Theology—Monday and Friday from 10AM to 12PM, and Wednesday from 11AM to 12PM. Standing on the Shoulders of Giants—Tuesday from 2PM to 4PM and Thursday from 2PM to 3PM. Introduction to Islam—Monday and Friday from 1PM to 3PM, and Wednesday from 1PM to 2PM. Problems in the Philosophy of Religion 1—Tuesday from 4PM to 5PM and Thursday from 12PM to 2PM.”
Harry smiled. He was certainly tired after all of the cooking and celebrating. He asked, “Who all is coming?”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They stepped into the classroom and got into two lines. The professor read the rules and the partners. There would be 10 challenges, ranging from easy to difficult in ascending order. The first challenge would be warding off an Expelliarmus. There would be a few minor jinxes and curses mixed in with some other obstacles which would change with each set of partners. The course would end in a somewhat lethal challenge. The winner would go onto the next round, and eventually there would be two champions. The professor read the partners out in chronological order. Harry and Ron would compete against each other as the third group.
“Oh, don’t kid yourself. They’re transparent!”
The walk was relatively unlively and boring, yet he still made sure to check out every person he saw. He tried to convince himself that this stuff made a person paranoid and that he should focus on controlling his thoughts rather than his environment. Merlin, he was so worried about work. He started grinding his teeth. He had seen how Darren prepared drinks and spoke to customers; Draco would
After finishing all of his food, he went upstairs to his bedroom.
Draco didn't respond for a few minutes. Then, he shivered and said, "We're going to get hypothermia out here."
“Wait, so you defended yourself before, but now you’re Satan?”
"What position is she" Draco asked.
understand. His therapist's initial diagnosis of PTSD scared him so much that he left the session to go home and cry. Heroes weren't supposed to be crazy, were they?
“Hey, Harry,” Draco said, shivering.
He rubbed his face. It was extremely cold due to his broom ride. He poured himself a glass of water and drank it all down. He poured another glass and another one. His mouth was not any closer to not being dry, and he wasn’t any closer to not being high. How was he supposed to go to training today? He couldn’t show up like this!
Draco rolled his eyes. He continued, “Of course. I was so cut off from information about muggles during the war. I don’t know. I’ve just enjoyed learning about everything.”
Harry blushed and was saved from replying when Andromeda greeted Draco with a bear-hug and cheek-kiss.
“Yep.” Harry flicked his eyebrows up and back down to their resting position. He continued, “What do you think our class is going to be on after this?”
“Um, no,” Draco answered. “But, where’s Darren? Isn’t he supposed to be working the bar with me this evening?”
“Yeah,” he said. They all had yet to talk about their families or childhoods in great detail, so he wasn’t going to mention that he somehow enjoyed a mattress on the floor more than a grand bed with silk sheets and a million pillows. Maybe it was the mentality behind it, he silently argued.
“What?”
Harry softly chuckled. At least he wasn't the only lost one. He glanced at Draco's face and saw that a piece of hair was stuck in front of his eye. Harry fought the urge to move it.
And knowledge in their hearts

Opening the box Harry found a beautiful armband inscribed with runes and gems littering its surface. Harry looked up at Sirius, who nodded, Harry looked at him in confusion.
“We got home from shopping on Monday around 3:30ish. After dining with Sirius most of us from Hogwarts went to bed, but I had a few things to pass on to Sirius from Harry, from earlier last week. I walked into the study as a House elf popped in and said that there was someone in the floo, saying that Sirius was needed at the ministry. He left very quickly.” Artemis said tears in her eyes.

Chapter 8 – September 11, 1995
"I can see in your eyes you wonder how this ties in to what I spoke of before. At the family level, the initial magic is weak, just forming, but easily controlled. By the time a house achieves Noble status, the Family magic has gone through its first maturity and gained limited sentience. It can do a few things on its own enable the Rite, locating heirs, and of course, chooses those that should be gifted with it. But it is still young and has limited control."
"Ah, Mr. Potter it is good to see you this morning, and I see you have read this morning's paper as such I must inform you that the detention assigned last week will take place tonight my office, 7 pm."
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
"No", answered Marvolo smirking a satisfied smile of victory.
"What, now?" Harry whirled his face having gone ashen in fear. "Grindelwald's made his move and will be here within another half an hour with about half a battalion of Russian soldiers and you just pulled down our best defense!" Harry snapped. "Did any of you think for a moment that we needed to be on war footing and that perhaps I needed to be told if you were to pull down the wards so that I might have extra defenses prepared."
"If you ever need anything from my house, I would happily aid," said Draco.
“Let the veritiserum be given,” Spoke Lord Carden “We have tarried here long enough.”
“Firstly, you were already reminded about titles and as the current regent has been disavowed for dishonoring a family ally,” he said nodding towards Harry, “I have every right to speak as heir and as my father is now disposed as head of house.” With his words, a gong sounded throughout the room as the ring on Neville’s finger changed from that of the heir ring to that of the Lords Ring.
"Oh, wow, I did not know that." Harry said considering his words with a slight tilt to his head. Draco couldn't stop thinking about how perfect Harry looked with that expression on his face.
The voices solidified, into one. “We have heard your voice of reason, you answered soundly, this council finds you a true Malfoy you have inherited the house.” With that Draco woke once more in the cylindrical room.
Antonio Aarons		Hogwarts Year 5
Enclosed is two pendants bearing my emblem one for you and another for your brother. They will on the 15th of December transport you from your residence to mine for a time of parties and celebrations.
"Well I do say that this will teach you to sneak up on Lords of the realm in such a manner again Williamson, come Heir Longbottom, Heir Potter let us go to my office. I am head unspeakable Croaker and will be happy to help to noble peers in any way I can. Williamson you can go read the manual on not taking people by their appearances again and come see me when you are done with that, your assumption that these two were mere schoolboys would have gotten you killed if they had had a mind to do so." With that both Neville and Harry put their weapons away and followed Croaker down to his office. "So, what can I do for you boys today?"

“There is nothing I can do, my hands are tied. The ICW cannot interfere in the workings of the Ancestral houses, the other houses have to guard against them themselves. As Lord Le-fay supports this, as the lord of an ancestral house he has the right to stay the kings law, in this instance, he would have to answer to the king or the head of the house they belong to for it, but it is in his rights.” Nikodemus answered.
For what was Bravery without Cunning
As Harry was carried into the hall, the peels of laughter and joy, that had come from students celebrating their victory tapered off. Artemis, and Neville, quickly found their way to Harry's side worry evident in their faces. "Viktor, floo St. Mungo's fetch the Potter family healer, Ted Tonks if you will." Neville asked before Lord Le-Fay pulled Neville from where he had knelt at Harry's side. Shaking Neville by the collar he roared.
April 5, 1989, ~ Obliviate ~ Albus Dumbledore
“And where would you have gotten your hands-on bodyguards like that Mr. Potter? Sneered Fudge.
“I am a high-level Hit wizard who, has connections within all the Magical Kingdoms, carries an ICW license, and have been a witness in criminal trails done by the ICW that have had wizards and witches, land in Nurmengard in cells next to Grindelwald. All of which were cases I was personally called upon to help track down and catch the wizard. As I am sure, Madame Bones can attest to I would be much more highly looked upon than any of you.” Alrick answers.
Croaker picked up the two and his eyes went wide. "Well you both have several prophecies that pertain to you only one given recently in the last twenty years, one other given about 65 years ago during the rise of Grindelwald and the others were given long before that. Which ones would you like to hear?" his voice was wavering at the end.
Alrick answered. “Yes, well we would like to speak with Madame Andromeda Tonks, with a matter of her picking up a case and possibly becoming the head law wizard for a family.”
“to allow the House of Potter to be absorbed into the Pendragon line. A price that few houses would be willing to pay.” Theo answered. “I do understand. But what does this have to do with…”
"The Le-Fay vineyard in France, the remaining shares are now yours, I want that information." Marvolo answered.
"The matter can be spoken of later, the matter at hand however is not. You Lord Le-Fay you would be well to remember the position and titles of house Potter, and of who we command…" He was interrupted before he could finish.
.          “Y-you, too,” Harry offered.
“But we were..?”
Harry noticed that Malfoy was very expressive and that he frequently spoke with his hands and utilized finger quotes.
“George kept the initials intact for his girls – Florestine and Guinevere,” Draco pointed out. “I wonder what the others’ children will be named.”
Harry frowned as he took the package. He carefully unwrapped it and found a large book. Opening the cover, he gasped. “My parents wedding picture!”
“Why don’t we set an appointment for the first week of August?” Goodman suggested. “I can come here to make it easier on your schedule.”
“The family didn’t have anything to say about you kissing Charlie?” Draco asked clearly shocked.
“I am glad it’s nothing serious that caused your outburst, Draco.” Lucius’ eyebrow rose.
Draco placed his free hand on his abdomen lightly and closed his eyes in a moment of relief. Harry’s hand was in the other one and he squeezed it as he opened his eyes again.
Lucius looked at the book. "Fascinating!"
Draco said nothing as he was lifted into his husband’s arms but he held on tightly while Harry carried him across the house and into the dining room. The meal was already served and waiting when they got there so Harry set Draco on his feet and held his chair. The blond passively obeyed, sitting still and silent to avoid Harry’s temper but as the aroma of the food permeated the air, both men heard Draco’s stomach rumble. Draco winced under Harry’s glare which didn’t let up until he picked up his utensils and began to eat.
Draco pulled him back and pointed at a beetle that was perched on a low tree branch. “Isn’t that…?”
Chapter 13
Both boys scrambled to their feet when someone knocked on the door the next morning.
Harry hesitantly nodded.
The third week, Harry gave Draco the contact information to an esteemed Potions Master who’d agreed to help the blond earn his own Mastery in the subject. He also promised – in writing – to buy a small storefront when Draco was ready for that step. The blond had been speechless because he knew Harry hadn’t really approved of that idea but Harry explained that he just wanted to make sure Draco did things in a safe and secure environment with a knowledgeable mentor.
“No, but if you don’t stop calling her that, I will force it upon you,” Harry glared playfully at the blond.
Draco seemed a little flustered, but nodded as he turned to play distractedly with his hair. “I should’ve gotten a haircut yesterday when Mother suggested it.”
Harry smiled at the baby girl, “Not even two months old and you’re already developing your Daddy’s high maintenance behavior. You may be a Malfoy, young miss, but you will learn to share.” He tapped his daughter’s nose which made her begin to coo.
“Draco, we need to shower, love,” Harry led the blond away toward the master suite. They’d bathe in the large tub and Harry would keep his husband so busy he’d never realize they had company until it was time.
Dobby watched over Harry as he performed his self-care routine and only popped away when Harry covered himself with the blanket.
“What is it?” Harry snapped at him.
Interest sparked in Draco’s silver eyes. “We could do anything short of full penetration…”
“You heard them, Dragon,” he explained in a soft voice. “I won’t want to, but I’ll have to leave the room if there are any complications.”
They waited until the workday was over and then walked out to the lifts. Draco gave them a wave from inside the closing lift since they’d just missed it and they waited for the next one. Harry and Ron soon reached the Ministry's apparition point a few alleys away from the visitor’s entrance and instantly disapparated.
Harry grinned and pulled Draco into a tight hug. “I want to kiss you so hard right now.” He murmured into Draco’s ear.
It was Narcissa who answered. "The sword draws blood and the goblet collects the blood, but some societies used locks of hair plaited together and placed into a locket. A tiara can be a symbol of the oath fulfilled, as with a bride-gift.”
Draco gasped. “They caught that as well?!”
“Yeah...” Harry sighed and went quiet as if thinking what to say. “I’ve been thinking about that day and...”
“Well, that just ignited my curiosity so I followed him to the headmistress’ office where he proceeded to convince me that he was the best choice I could make.” Draco held tightly to Harry’s hand. “He convinced me that he could love me and asked only that I try to reciprocate while living as his husband and bearing our shared children.”
"I knew Lucius and I would never suit each other, so I broke the betrothal to marry the man I loved. That they relented and allowed you to marry him was unexpected but I was very happy for you, Sister. You wouldn't know this but…" Andromeda smirked. "I attended your wedding ceremony in disguise to avoid Lord and Lady Black."
“Yes.” Harry affirmed. “With the added incentive of having a true relationship with Draco, I hope for more than a truce... In fact, I propose an alliance.”
Ron stubbornly pursed his lips. "I don't like this at all. Do you think you can buy us? Think we're dolls you can collect and keep around til we're useful? Pawns on a chessboard?"
“Slowly, but surely.” Dumbledore smiled back giving Harry the impression that it was quite fake.
“No.” Harry was saying in a calm but determined tone. “We’re waiting until he wakes up this time and that’s final… besides, the family hasn’t even seen them yet.”
Harry,
"One of us?" Draco huffed, one hand moving to his hip. "I'll have you know, Potter, that if I go along with this, I expect to be swept off my feet when you propose to me! Nothing less than high romance and sweet nothings shouted from the astronomy tower! Do you hear me?"
“You bastard!” Harry started to rush forward but Draco spun to intercept him.
Harry looked down at his newborn daughter. She looked so delicate lying in her bassinet. He was reminded of how he'd felt when Lyra and Caelum had been born – blessed…and the Malfoy-Potters had been blessed once again. He barely recalled his anger at Lucius now because of the newfound amiability the older man had been showing for the last several years. Harry thought back, as he stroked her soft dark hair, to the last few days.
Draco felt himself harden and tried to wake his horny husband up. “Harry!”
Harry and Draco nodded. “See you soon. Thanks for everything, Lucius. Thank you, Cissa. You’ve both been such a help.”
After recovering from his deep belly-laugh, Draco stood to get himself another drink but promptly swayed on his feet.
Harry grimaced as he summoned the vial and handed it to the blond before standing to remove his robe and pyjama pants.
Draco bit his lip and nodded. "Good thing there's options for gay wizards in the magical world."
"What degree?" Sirius asked urgently.
“Most of you have met our children or at least seen the pictures we gave to the Prophet. If you’d like to meet them, Draco’s parents have them at our table. I hope you all enjoy the party…” Harry was just about to cast the Quietus charm when he recalled that someone else might wish to speak. “Oh and feel free to make your own toasts and things.” He cast the charm and went to hug his husband.
“Draco!” She came over and hugged the blond while Harry shook her husband Adrian’s hand.
“You snogged him? Why didn’t you tell us?” Ron demanded.
“I liked it...” Draco bit his lip. “When you made the mark. Why did I like it? I feel like a freak - I liked having you bruise me. So why did I not like Viktor doing it?”
“But did it have to be Potter?” The elder Malfoy grumbled. “Did you know about this... and why are we here if he’s dating Potter? I’d think you would be satisfied if he was only dating Potter.”
“May I cut in?” Lucius asked with a slightly sarcastic tone.
“What? No, that’s not what I said at all, Mione!” Ron protested.
Draco's gaze was drawn to Harry who was quite placid. Every house had a claim on Harry’s actions. He had bravely ventured into the unknown corners of the school to pursue knowledge and now he was going to share the knowledge and resources he'd found without regard for house affiliation. While each of those actions were recognizably from their houses, the credit Harry would get for all of it would add to the reputation he already held of being a chivalrous respectful smart friendly young man ...and that was quite cunning.
Lucius nodded once. "Very well, Draco may visit... if Severus escorts him."
"Not today, Ziva. Thank you." Harry sighed and as she left his thoughts turned back to the family of blondes.
Draco smirked to himself and turned over to face his husband. “I still feel what I felt back then, Harry…but I also feel different. I don’t know how to explain it except to say that I used to compartmentalize what I felt when we got together and now I don’t. You have made me feel safe and loved when we’re alone just as much as when we’re with others. You’ve also made me feel your Dominant side while in a room full of people. The possessive fire that lights your eyes when you Dominate me is the same one that lets me know I’m safe and loved. I still love and want you…I adore our children…”
“Really?” Harry asked as he nipped at Draco’s earlobe. “I never pictured you submitting.”
Harry thanked his little friend and looked at the Slytherins. “This dagger is one of two interesting things I found in Gryffindor's secret quarters. I'll only make a small cut so there's no need to worry.” He’d barely finished speaking when he moved the dagger across his fingertip and allowed a single drop of blood to fall on the tile.
“All I’m saying is that my siblings and I...? We have no inheritance.” Ron pointed out. “We have very few connections and we really only have each other for back up.”
“Good night, everyone; sleep well.” Harry smiled, nodding at each person as he passed them on his way to the corridor. When they were alone, he called Dinki. “Would you please take us back to the suite? We’re awfully tired.”
Thank you all so much for your help hnwhitlock2000, Mrs.Agget, kjwatson and SB.
“I’ve only ever seen reproductions of this style of ship.” Remus stepped closer to get a look at the dragon head at the bow. “It looks like it hasn’t aged a day!”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
There was a rush of air and to his surprise the door swung open allowing a very confused Sirius to poke his head in. "Pup? What are you doing over there? Did you spell the door open?" He walked in and sat at Harry's desk, noticing as he did so that Harry's wand was nowhere in sight.
"Yes, milord Potter, sir!" Sirius joked.
Remus took charge. "Padfoot, check the road in that direction. I'll check the shoreline. Fred, you're with me. George, you go with him."
"That wasn't something I needed to hear, mates." Ron smirked and shook his head.
Teddy and Draco shared a look before turning back to join Harry. The waitress came and took their lunch orders before letting them get back to their conversation.
Harry smirked as he twirled his husband. "It doesn't surprise me that you'd enjoy being taken care of, Draco. It's a form of pampering and I always knew you would be a high maintenance lover...if I caught you."
Draco sighed with a chuckle. “Well then you can teach them their Patronuses.”
“My parents have the kids until we get back home.” Draco told his friend. “I was hoping to check on Pansy.”
"He'll be at the Slytherin dinner table if he loses, you know." Blaise frowned. "You didn't have to pick the same stakes of the bet. What made you do that?"
“So let’s go home and celebrate Starla’s findings.” Harry chuckled before pecking the blond’s cheek. “Our family is safe from further investigation …because of you.”
Narcissa looked at her son with a sigh. "You saw this as going too fast and not giving your relationship the time it needs to grow."
“Hello, Uncle Sev.” Draco whispered running his fingers across the edge of his frame.
As soon as divination class finished, Harry and Ron hurried out the door. "At least the partners will change for divination. It'll get us used to working with different people and personalities. That's a skill for the real world."
“Blood and Gender are the determining factors for the order of inheritance in the Malfoy family and so nothing has changed in that regard.” Lucius spoke with an officious air. “The line begins with my son, Draconis Lucien Malfoy-Potter. It continues with Caelum Orion Malfoy-Potter and will go down through his children after him. Lady Lyra and Lady Silvana are not to be held as less important than any other member of this family. Nor will Teddy Lupin be held as less important.”
“Dobby, no.” Harry cautioned his little friend. “If you want to be allowed full access to Hogwarts, you need to pretend. You can’t help me if you don’t.”
As they walked back down the aisle, they vaguely heard questions being shouted at them but they ignored the whole crowd when Harry heard Lucius take charge.
Draco closed his eyes, just breathing in the other man’s dominance.
“Bones, right? Susan Bones?” Harry grinned. “I’m actually here to register my form. I just completed my transformation yesterday afternoon.”
“We understand that traditions are important, Father.” Draco cut in. “We won’t interfere that much with them. We just don’t see why they have to be taken so seriously. Surely the elves would understand that I’m tired or that the amount of visitors we received took a large slice of time from the day. I’m sure they didn’t care a whit that the other children attended the presentation even though they are underage.”
“That’s not up to you, Draco…” Harry grinned. “But since I agree to Astoria’s request, I’ll allow you to come the next time you ask.” Harry started to fuck Draco with the toy again as Astoria began to ride him harder than before.
“Please Harry?” He whispered as a tear trailed down his pale cheek. “I need it.”
"Would you like the honor?" Tom asked, not looking at anyone in particular.
Lucius sighed. “No.”
Harry chuckled. "Yes, it is…"
Once the others were gone, Harry faced the queen's representative. "How may I help you, Ms. Silverling?"
Draco cringed at the butchery of the word. “That’s very good, Teddy. I’m glad you’ve done so well…but I do believe you meant breakfast.”
“We had no attendants or there would be a similar picture from our wedding. Severus was one of the guests though and I knew Draco would treasure a likeness of his godfather the way you do yours,” Lucius continued.
Harry sighed. "I just don't want to take anything away from someone it belongs to more than me."
Harry placed a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Didn’t he tell you about your family’s tradition of fathers witnessing their sons’ wedding consummation?”
Draco sighed. "If you're living here with us, you should call him by his first name, Pans..."
Harry nodded and backed up as a knock sounded at the door which opened to reveal Molly Weasley who was being given a tour of the house.
Harry smiled kindly at the elf. “Anything new at Hogwarts?”
Harry didn't understand why Draco seemed so down during lunch but the blond had perked up at the idea of pushing his ex’s buttons about the possible pranksters who attacked Neville on the staircase the day before. They parted for the afternoon so he distracted himself by moving forward with his plans. He signaled to Zack who got to his feet and joined him.
“I’ve been teasing him horribly and stopping just before he can reach orgasm. It’s a lot of fun and quite humiliating for him. He may be crying, but he’s really not all that upset,” Harry explained. “If you’d care to have a session…he’s ready…”
“I’ll keep that in mind, sir.” Harry smiled at the rotund man as he left.
"Why?" Harry asked. "Do you play?"
“You said yourself she was only trying to protect herself. Come on, Harry; she’s getting divorced and she’s pregnant…Please?” Draco pleaded. “She’s spoken to me much worse than what you heard that time.”
Draco nodded, eager to see what Harry had in mind.
Draco shook his head. “Thanks, Harry. That’s so very helpful.”
Narcissa looked at him curiously. “Really, Harry?”
“You have both developed a wonderful understanding of each other and your families.” Starla shook her head in amazement. “I hope to Merlin that there are more well-adjusted couples out there. I’m happy to be able to tell you this, Gentlemen: I’ll be reporting to the wizengamot that, in my professional opinion, your marriage is a stable and happy one.”
"You just write your parents; I'll let McGonagall know." Harry grinned.
Hoping you are well,
"I didn't realize there was a procedure at all. I saw him and just thought I'd say hello." Harry said carefully. "If people make appointments to see him, are they trying to do the same to see me? If they are, I haven't received any notifications of it."
“Yes, our little Alison is asleep for the moment.” Seamus sighed happily taking a sip of lemonade. “It’s nice to have a slight reprieve. She’s been colicky lately.”
“Harry, I can’t believe you did this…and without even hinting to me!” Draco beamed at his husband as he went out to see his friends.
“Are you going to tell Mother and Father?” Draco asked blinking his eyes slowly.
Tom froze but nodded and handed over a key. "Tomorrow."
The urge to kiss him was suddenly so strong that Harry couldn't fight it any longer. He leaned in close while encouraging Draco to come closer. Their lips met softly and then Draco's hands came up to Harry's chest but they didn't stop there. The longer the kiss lasted the higher Draco's hands traveled - until they were in Harry's hair.
Harry looked at Luna while Draco frowned at Blaise. “I haven’t spoken to her since I pulled that prank.”
Harry called Kreacher and instructed him to assist Eckles. He then went with Marcus to greet the two little ones and play a short game of Connect Four. Draco had his meal on a tray in Pansy’s room while Harry helped Marcus feed Tanis and Ambrose. After dinner, Harry played Candyland with the kids and Marcus had a restful cup of tea with Draco and his wife.
Draco only nodded until he saw Blaise stop and look up at him.
******** ******** Chapter 46 ******** ********
Reluctantly, Harry nodded lowering his wand to point at the floor. "I suppose it won't hurt to listen."
Harry's green eyes shone in the light of the afternoon sun coming through the window as he nodded eagerly. "Absolutely!"
“Well, I’ve been thinking about that.” Harry told her and turned to the Malfoys. “Take Zack. He rarely exhibits the Hufflepuff house traits but he's ambitious and knowledgeable."
“You look beautiful.” Harry called by way of greeting.
“On the back of that one was a sketch of something else.” Harry grinned as he pulled out the sketch in question. “Here is Myrddin... or Merlin as he was also known... and on the back...” He flipped it over to show a walking stick similar to Lucius’ cane.
“It’s alright, Draco...shhh. Calm down, love.” Harry got on the bed and cradled Draco as close to his side as the small baby bump would allow - skin to overheated skin.
"He's just a kid, Uncle Severus." Draco protested. "Nothing his father or any other family member did should affect how you treat an innocent child who wasn't even born when the offense occurred!"
Draco grinned and opened the doors to reveal a suite of rooms that Harry had only ever dreamed of. He watched the brunette’s gaze wander slowly from the doors, through the sitting area and into the bedroom. It was all one room but they were separated by partitions, columns and small groups of steps.
“It does – mostly. That was near his birthday…is this some kind of inheritance? Are you trying to get me to marry a creature, Lucius?” Astoria glared at Draco’s father.
“Mistress Cissa and Master Lucius are asking for Mr. Harry Potter and Master Draco to join them for dinner.” The small creature said. “What can Dinki be telling them?”
Draco smiled at their newest friend. “The twins were born a month early. They’re fine.”
Dinner was wonderful though Draco’s apple sauce craving returned and Harry was happy to supply relief.
“Mother woke me when she came to help with the children.” Draco told him “She told me Andy’s solicitor is joining us for breakfast and it seems that she’s written letters to each of us.”
“That one is extremely poisonous if ingested or if you become stuck by a thorn.” She said pointing to an innocent looking cactus plant. “It’s called the Desert’s Fang.”
He flopped onto his back and stared at the ceiling as he listed the pros and cons for each option. There was a chance that Harry would be receptive to his kinky desires but there was a very real fear that he'd find it repulsive and never want to see Draco again. If he sent Harry home without their customary snog he might be disappointed but he didn't normally get angry about it. Draco considered, for a moment, fire-calling Pansy but he knew what she'd say.
“Your body is being appreciated and enjoyed…” Harry chuckled as he latched onto his lover’s nipple.
Sadly, Harry knew he was right. He made to hand Mac the sack of life jackets but the older man shook his head.
Draco’s eyes locked with Harry’s. “We spent a little time with the twins and I said that maybe someday we would have a child with your dark hair and my grey eyes…”
“So, in light of outside interference, perhaps we might attempt to find some way to start our acquaintanceship over again?” Harry asked.
She came closer and laid her head on his shoulder.
"Mum's invited some people round for it. After the title thing." Ron mumbled. "I know we're not really getting along right now but..."
“Really, Harry?” Katie asked in surprise. “How?”
"Thank you, Ziva." Harry said softly as he peered into one of the indicated rooms. The desk took up much of the space in the room but there were also a few chairs.
"To start with, I need friends in all houses. I'll need advice occasionally, be it on matters of state or something school related." Harry told him. "I may need your participation if I have to perform a ritual."
"Sometimes the suffering of one is tolerable for benefit the many." Luna commented sadly.
Harry nodded sadly. "How is Dudley? I hope he's doing alright."
Harry gritted his teeth but grabbed a blanket and threw it at his cousin as he ran for the kitchen. Ripping open the refrigerator door he swiped  the cover off the black pudding container and pulled out the chocolate bar. He took a chunk for himself and handed the rest to Dudley who cowered on the couch. "Eat. You'll feel better in a bit. I don't know where your parents are but I'm not cooking until they're back."
“Good...very good, my dragon.” Harry crooned squeezing the nipple another time before bending over his husband and placing his lips around it. Then he began to suckle lightly.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Harry chuckled and cast a Sonorus charm. “Susan is having her baby in our guest room. She’s being seen to by a wonderful Healer as well as her husband and the healer’s assistant. There’s nothing to worry about.”
Draco shook his head with a shocked chuckle as she stood again and walked off while he rejoined the conversation with Ginny, George and their spouses.
Harry hugged her tight. "He probably figured out that we know each other, that's all."
Remembering something he'd said on the train, Draco looked closer at him. "Does it have anything to do with Gringotts?"
"As soon as I have the password." He glanced up at the head table where Mcgonagall had just folded a small piece of parchment and stood up. "Looks like it'll be soon."
The headline screamed: ‘ARRESTED: Worldwide Quidditch Star Turns Abusive on Pregnant Fiancé.’
Harry rolled to hover over his husband. His eyes burned into Draco’s desperate mind as he brought his cock to push against Draco’s slick opening. Slipping in to that tight space, Harry groaned softly, “Finally…”
“Draco told me once that you were able to cast a Patronus at thirteen years of age.” Rax smirked.
“Excellent. That means there’s plenty of time for me to go over a few things with Mr. Malfoy-Potter.” The solicitor was very business-like as he spoke to them. “The letters will be handed out when the others arrive.”
“I know you haven’t seen it yet, Harry, but my parents have that kind of relationship.” Draco laid a hand on Harry’s knee. “We can too.”
“Yes…” Al sighed softly. “I had four. The oldest one is in Australia with her family. Another is in Asia studying their variations of some of our spells. One died in the war before she could really live and the fourth is at Beauxbatons for his last year.”
Harry frowned and looked around. He’d seen Draco call out to him but who else was here? The place was crowded but he hadn’t seen Ron and Hermione arrive just behind him. Then - from the left - Seamus and Dean were waving from the end of a line. He waved their way but stayed beside Ron and Hermione while Draco came forward to meet them.
“She married that boy from Gryffindor…” Blaise answered frowning. “I forget his name but he graduated last year. You had him on the Quidditch team in sixth year and he played Keeper when Ron was injured.”
"And we can revisit this topic in the future if we need to?" Harry asked.
“That was a big story, Pansy,” Marcus told her. “Your divorce, I mean. It was reported in every newspaper for over a month. I was so angry to hear of it happening.”
"Oh, but Severus! You're forgetting one key fact!" Remus aimed a hard stare at the other man. "He isn't just James' son, Severus. He's also Lily's, and damn, if she wasn't sassy herself, sometimes."
Harry chuckled. "So it's just a simple procedure then?"
“I obviously had some help.” Harry grinned.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Because you’re driving me insane with those sex noises over there, and I want you so badly right now.”
"Deer." Draco confided, his cheeks coloring slightly.
"Milly was wondering if the Master would be calling soon." One of them stepped forward and squeaked.
"And I'll help you shop." Remus said, sitting down across from Dudley.
When he reached the nearby park and realized that it was empty, he was happy. Nobody would see him with an owl and wonder. Nobody would ask his relatives questions they didn't want to answer. He walked over to a bench and looked around to be sure he wasn't in sight of any houses. After he'd been sitting for a few minutes, the owl he'd seen in his neighbor's tree landed on his shoulder. As soon as he'd untied the letter the bird flew off giving him the confirmation that there was a ward on either himself or his house to control his mail. This wasn't good.
"Where did they come from?" Harry asked.
Draco’s eyes popped open and he gasped for breath as Harry tried to sooth him.
"He said you tried to owl me." Sirius frowned. "I didn't get any owls last night."
Harry chuckled but Draco looked horrified. “Is it fixed?”
/*/*/*/*/*
“Wonderful. Now, where shall we begin our discussion, Tom?” Harry asked as politely as he could. “We have quite a few topics to cover, after all... and precious little time.”
“He asked to speak with you beforehand,” She nodded and led Harry to the large wooden door of her late father-in-law’s office.
“Susan’s water just broke!” The man told them frantically. “She’s not due for almost two more weeks but her water broke and I don’t think there’s much time!”
Harry stopped what he was doing. "Squibs are descendants of magical people who have no magic. The letter Vernon gave me last night - from the Ministry - was scolding me for using magic in a muggle area but since there were no muggles present at the time it didn't result in any punishment."
Draco hurried to scoop up their daughter and fuss over her. “How is Daddy’s princess?”
“Silver is also bright and shiny and beautiful …and ‘Silvana’ as a name references all of that.” The brunette was watching Lucius hold the newest member of the family as he continued. “But that isn’t all…”
Pansy smirked at them. “What they mean is that Lucius needs time to understand the meaning behind your name change before anyone – not just you – approaches him.”
"The lost son..." Harry confirmed with a nod. "And the goblins restored my health which woke my sleeping powers..."
“This has nothing to do with traditional BDSM, Harry.” Astoria informed the man who might become the savior of her livelihood, while carding her fingers through her husband’s platinum locks. “His very subconscious tells him that he must submit and he does submit… in everything.”
Harry took hold of his cock and brushed the tip against Draco’s opening. He smiled as the usually tight ring of muscle just softly allowed him entrance. It simply knew he belonged there and gave way under the light pressure.
Harry nodded. "And about that announcement…?"
“I’ll get the salve.” Harry pressed a light kiss to the bruise he’d made.
The man looked down at Luna speculatively, not bothering to acknowledge the twins before going over to his desk to meet an owl as it glided in to land on the back of the chair with a box.
When they’d arrived at Nettlestone that afternoon, Harry had been in such a panicked state.
The younger kids looked nervous and confused but the prefects quickly reassured them and got everyone back into their seats until the teachers could tell them what to do.
Harry confessed his sadness and let the blond comfort him.
Draco got there first. “Mother!”
Harry sighed. “Is that why you really left that day we all went flying? You wanted us to have time alone to figure that out for ourselves?”
"It could be, dear boy." The older man nodded sadly.
“Hush, dearest.” Her husband glared at her. “He’s here for a reason – in case you’ve forgotten.”
“Harry!” A multitude of voices shouted at once.
Harry’s eyes burned with unshed tears at the thought that he’d given his husband nightmares. “Can you talk about it, Dragon?” He could feel Draco’s heart beating too rapidly and the blond was still a sobbing mess so he called for Dinki to bring him a calming potion.
Dobby hopped up and down before rushing to hug his friend.
Rax looked happily flabbergasted. “I thought he’d never budge! He wanted it to be a surprise!”
Remus was shocked as Korlag's face took on a menacing appearance. "Dumbledore is clearly unable to keep you safe, Mr. Potter, and he is therefore unfit to be your guardian. Perhaps we can find someone who is fit."
“So do you have a theory on why you do work so well together?” The healer was still reeling from the onslaught of information but she seemed to sense that Harry had more to say.
Draco sighed again. "What? Nothing."
“As am I, my fellow fowl.” Cassius joined in with a chuckle.
“Can’t - we’re out of vodka.” Draco smirked.
/*/*/*/*/*
A strange look of distress took over Draco’s face and Harry could see the other man’s lip begin to tremble. He knew he had to act fast. “Of course I missed you.” Harry didn’t let him get out of arm’s reach before pulling him back in. “I love you. I just wondered why you felt the…” He stopped as he saw his mother-in-law’s head shaking. Something clicked in his mind. “It’s the baby…Isn’t it? I’m sorry I didn’t understand.”
“Technically the largest thing in this room is the windows... which show the lake bed and the possible ruin.” Harry met Draco’s gaze. “This suggests to me that Salazar and Godric valued their elemental powers more than the other two founders did.”
Harry suddenly heard a yell from the wrong direction and turned to look. “Neville?”
He handed her the letter and waited.
“It’s lovely,” Harry smiled as he looked the naked man over before perusing the scenery, “I think we should discuss the rules that will apply within these rooms.”
Harry smiled. "So you told him which number you intended to call?"
Harry didn’t mind being walked through the steps since he’d never had sex with a man before. His breath came in pants as he followed Draco’s instructions and then...it was time. Draco was begging for him to be inside and - Merlin help him - he wanted it too. Draco refused to get on all fours, wanting to see Harry’s face, so there he was on his back with that gorgeous platinum hair a splash of gold on the burgundy comforter as Harry lined himself up. “You’re so beautiful...” He said softly as his cock pressed up against Draco’s sensitive pucker.
“I’m sorry to impose, madam.” Harry bowed slightly as he sat in the chair he’d summoned from the other side of the room. “But it is lovely to meet you.”
His thoughts wandered until the sky began to darken. Arthur lit the candles on the cake as Molly started everyone off on a round of ‘happy birthday’. The birthday boy blew out the candles and left the slicing to Molly as he was badgered into giving a speech.
“If I’m going to stick to the vow I just made not to judge...you can’t lie to me.” Harry said softly. “The Americans have a saying...when they don’t want to incriminate themselves with their own words they say: I plead the fifth. It’s something to do with their constitution and their laws but if you think I’ll get upset by something you say...just say that. Will you?”
“Can you believe that Silverling lady thought Harry kidnapped me?” Dudley chuckled as he and Remus followed Sirius in his dog form out to the yard.
The two boys stared at each other for a moment that felt like eternity.
Pansy walked with them so they told her all about the things they’d seen. She sat reading a book while they showered and dressed. When they were all ready, Harry escorted them both down to the dining room and held both chairs. This dinner was much less eventful, as the elves had fully stocked the coffers.
She sat up and reached out to her husband. "I can see what's implied, Arthur. I see it and it just isn't possible!"
"Potter Grove... I haven't been here since we were children, Moony." Sirius whispered in a reverent tone.
Chapter 14
“I’m going after him.” Harry had clearly gone into hero-mode as he pulled the door open and jogged down the corridor. As he hurried past a member of Viktor’s team, he heard the man say something about Krum’s hot blond ‘piece of ass’ going down to comfort him. He got to the locker room door and pushed it open just in time to hear a resounding slap. Harry’s temper flared and he truly hoped it was Viktor who’d received the abuse this time but he wasn’t counting on it. He took another step into the room only to see Draco leaning against the wall holding his face. Tears ran down his cheeks but still he tried to stand.
Cassius stared down at him. “Talk to us, Harry…it will help.”
******** ******** Chapter 25 ******** ********
Ron and Hermione stood and hurried over as fast as an eight months pregnant woman can hurry. “I thought you were going to bring us in there, not them out to us!” Hermione grinned.
"And now that I'm free, Albus keeps me so busy with order business that I can hardly see Harry much less form a real relationship with him." Sirius commented, standing up to face the group; hoping it looked like he was supporting his godson rather than distracting from the shaking of the table.
Harry twisted his wrist again and finally felt what he was looking for.
"Harry was quite drunk when he arrived home." Draco confided. The worry was evident in his tone.
Beyond the shared hopes of health and happiness, Harry hoped his new daughter would be as smart as her siblings. He also hoped she would learn ‘Dada’ first because Draco deserved to have at least one of his children do that. With Lyra’s demanding attitude and Caelum’s eagerness for life…and mischief…Harry also held hope that this newest member of their family would be an easier going child.
“What I said is that you need to rediscover yourself.” Draco raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. “And I only said it when Harry suggested that he didn’t know who he was without Ginny and the kids, so don’t you look at
As the true meaning of the snake's name hit Harry, he flipped through the pages of the dictionary to find something specific. "She can be named Suki."
Not another word was spoken until they reached an archway that framed a door. The arch was simple stone with a rounded top and no carvings. The door reminded him of the one at Mac's boatyard - solid wood with an old key lock.
"We'll help too, Harry!" Hermione beamed at them.
"Who?" Arthur Weasley was just coming back from his shed when he overheard Harry's question.
“Dinki? Before you go, may I speak with you?” Harry asked.
Teddy delighted in seeing Harry in owl form and liked to pet his soft feathers.
A small table appeared in front of him and after a moment, an elf popped in with a dish of flapjacks and an assortment of fruit. Harry topped his breakfast with berries and took the bull by the horns...or rather, the lion by the mane.
Harry and Viktor took off at the same time. Draco waited for them to settle in on their brooms and asked about their readiness before making a slight show of the release by tossing it straight up in the air. The wings quickly unfurled and it lifted itself the rest of the way to hover between the competitors. It seemed to look at each of them in turn before making a rapid getaway.
“He’s mine, bitch!” Draco glared playfully at his friend as he picked up a juicy pickle. Then he ruined the effect with a laugh. “Well, anyway, I knew he could handle a bit of responsibility and he’d saved me a few times already, so I trusted him with my life. His behavior since the day we got the letters has shown me that I was right to do that. He’s been sweet and kind and, Pans - right from the very beginning he’s been really romantic and caring. He’s always careful with me and makes me feel so important. He protects me from our friends as well as our enemies. He doesn’t make me earn my sweets or his affection. How could I not fall in love with a man like that?”
“I haven’t got a reason, just that I like the look of his ass when it’s just been beaten.” Draco’s wife smiled.
Harry chuckled. "C'mon, on the way to Divination, I'll tell you what Percy's face looked like when I told him I was business partners with the twins."
“Alright.” Blaise grinned. He’d always loved getting one over on a Gryffindor! “Should we get Pansy involved? She will be there tomorrow, won’t she?”
Luna greeted the Grey Lady. "Hello, Aunt Helena."
"Can I have it, Harry?" Draco's lower lip trembled slightly.
“You mean you want to keep it?” Draco asked when the pup looked up at him with sad black eyes. He instantly felt bad and knelt to ruffle its fur. “We should really ask Mum and Dad. I don’t know if either of them are allergic.”
“Just some pleasure for you…nothing too arduous.” Harry chuckled.
"I need more..." Draco whimpered. "Harry, please fuck me again. I want you inside me. I want you so badly, Harry; please!"
Harry lifted his lover into his arms and laid him on the bed. "I want your hands on me tonight, Dragon. I want to feel your touch while I fuck you."
He made his way through the corridors, narrowly missing an argument between Filch and Peeves as he went down a staircase. He smiled at the still life that guarded the kitchen before turning to face the portrait guarding Hufflepuff's common room.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded. He could do this. He had supported Draco through a pregnancy and the first two and a half years of their marriage. Draco had only needed to return the favor on a few individual occasions…this might help him feel more equal.
She nodded as she took the mug and watched Draco pour the steaming water. “So I suppose you’ve heard about Ginny.” She sat and glanced between the men. “I can’t find reason in her actions but at least the proceedings seem to be going quickly.” Her eyes settled on Harry’s hair as she took her first sip.
"Before breakfast I may have made it clear that the common room was to be empty for your visit." Draco shrugged. "I didn't want anyone here that didn't have to be and I didn't want anyone to overhear things meant to be secret. They're outside or in their dorms or the library.”
"Harry!" Fred pulled the door open and stepped back.
They did what Master Loveday told them and had lunch when Dinki brought it. After the mid-day meal, Draco had another lesson so Harry took the children out into the garden for a lesson of their own. Maybe soon, he’d move on to see if they could learn to say ‘papa’ as well as they had the babbling ‘bah-bah-bah’ to ask for their bottles.
"Do you think he'll take your suggestion to heart, Ron?" Hermione asked.
Andromeda came in the room and greeted them. “Hello! How are you guys? Oh my, is that real ruby? Ron, I hope you’re treating her right.”
“No. In the war.”
Harry’s brain finally made the connection, and he looked at her. “Huh?” he said.
“Hey, what’s up?” Harry asked Draco.
[Two,] Olive Garden is American with garlic.”
It was now the twelfth of October and they had arranged weekly dinners. Harry was surprised because Draco and his mother had restored their relationship to such a point as to where he had allocated some time in order to pay Narcissa a visit at her home in France.
“Well, I hear that first dates are always like this,” Draco replied.
“For me, it’s the cloaks. They strangely resemble dementors a bit with those.” Malfoy didn’t reply, so Harry continued, “Try inhaling through your nose, counting to four, and exhaling through your mouth.”
“No, sorry. I was-uh. Thinking of a funny joke. Wanna hear it?”
The rest of Harry’s day seemed to fly by.While his algebra course worried him, he found that he could breeze through Earth Science and still receive high marks. As for World History, how difficult could muggle history be?
, and 2
Harry ended up figuring that Draco was going to a muggle uni because he wanted to mend his family’s name. Harry had attended the trials of all three of the Malfoys. He only testified for Narcissa and Draco. He knew that Lucius Malfoy had been sentenced to thirty years in Azkaban and had the Malfoy Manor seized. Narcissa was fined millions of galleons and was exiled. Draco was placed on probation, but Harry did not know those specifics. Thus, in the end, Draco Malfoy was the only person who could revive his family’s honor.
"People are no longer under the threat of war. Or rather, they weren't between the years 1983 and 1990."
“They just kept raising it until we had nothing,” Draco replied.
on the board and gave Harry a dry-erase marker. It was his turn to teach. He was surprised that his nervousness was pout of excitement and not dread.
“Ron,” Harry interrupted, grabbing the ginger’s arms. “It’s almost four in the evening. I think you should just forget about it.”
“Half-bloods at Hogwarts.”
Harry found it cute—er, funny—how Draco clenched onto his seat for dear life. And also irritating.
“Well, let’s sit down. We don’t want this food getting cold,” said Ron.
“I bet that Arthur Weasley would love this movie.”
makes me paranoid. Damn it!” he screamed. He grabbed his wallet and walked out the door. He didn’t even lock it when he left; he didn’t have any valuable shit, anyways. Draco groaned. He was going to get a hamburger and fries because the fat in them would kill the tweak. He thought through his process,
“Bullocks, you ask a lot of questions. Why do you ask so many questions?” said Malfoy, evading the question.
Harry stood up. He desperately needed a break from this—
for the party?" he asked.
"Really? You were always great at magic in school."
“What?”
Dousselsnorf interrupted the blond, “Really? The villain? Your father got 20 years in Azkaban. Your mother was fined for everything your family owned and exiled. Yaxley received 30 years to life in Azkaban, as did many of the other Death Eaters! Once you accept that you got off easy, you’ll start to accept that life doesn’t just have it in for you. Ever heard of karma? If you stop acting like an arse, life’ll stop treating you like one. Now, can we get back to our meeting?”
Harry thought about his homework: a book to read for English, a paper for World History, a test to study for in Algebra, and several worksheets for therapy. All were due next week.
“Gryffindork!”
TW panic attack mention
Harry beamed. This schedule was exactly what he wanted, and the class times weren’t so bad, either. He couldn’t believe he was thinking it, but, for the first time in three years, he was very excited for school to start.
.          “No!” Malfoy responded quickly. “I mean, um, yes. I’m busy. Sorry. I apologize for that. I can’t join you. Have a nice tour.” His face reddened a bit. Harry suddenly became very conscious of Teddy playing with his hair.
“Why, if it isn’t the Bi Who Lived! How are you; how are you?” the red-head joked, shaking Harry’s hand intensely.
Draco knew that he shouldn’t have done it. He really knew that. But how could he not? After all he’d been through that day, why shouldn’t he write his own mother back?
“What?” Harry asked.
However, his fears washed away when the kid squealed, “We have a visitor!”
o’ me,” Darren yelled, clearly extremely inebriated. “What the fuck you lookin’ at, fag?” Darren turned to Draco and lunged forward a bit, as if he was going to fight him with handcuffs on and police holding onto him.
“What are you thinking of buying for him?” Draco asked.
[Let’s go say ‘hi’ to your aunt.]” He picked Teddy up and walked downstairs to the kitchen where Andromeda was reading the mail.
.          Andromeda gasped. “Teddy, let go. Teddy,
“I’m Cody. I timed three times three.”
Harry cleared his threat and replied, "He seems okay. He pays attention in class. He's kinda quiet. That's it."
“So, what are we going to buy here?” Draco asked.
After walking less than one kilometer, Draco found a place. He bought two six-packs of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of Smirnoff. The cashier didn’t even ask him how his day was going; in fact, the man didn’t say anything except Draco’s total for the transaction. Draco found it glorious.
“Oh, cool.”
With the force at which Draco bit back, one might think that the tabloids had personally offended him.
“My name’s Davie. I wanna now how old you are.”
“Harry…” Andromeda commented, “Would you like to tell me how a two-year-old is going to eat this?”
Draco
“It’s
“The Boy Who Lived: a chain-smoking, tree-hugging, Death Eater comforter?” Malfoy replied in a slightly amused, slightly confused tone.
Ron spoke up, “I just don’t want to wait until those stupid breaks to see Hermione again. That university thing is so bloody dumb. Why go to a muggle university when you have all this experience and ability in the wizarding world?”
This room was empty. The walls were stripped of any paint, yet it still felt like he was in a completely different building. He had goosebumps on his arms. He spotted a black figure near the exit. Harry raised his wand, but he dropped it as soon as he heard a scream.
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he had Intro to Psych from 9AM-10AM, English 101 from 12PM-1:30PM, and Criminal Justice from 3PM-4:20PM. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, he would have Algebra 101 from 10:30AM-12PM, Earth Science 101 from 2PM-3PM, and World History 111 from 3:30PM-5PM. On Saturdays, he had French Aa from 6PM-7PM.
"I'm really happy for her. I reckon her skills have won then most of the matches."
“It is not your fault. It is Voldemort’s fault. He killed all those people. He left so many as orphans or childless or brotherless. I don’t blame you, and neither would Remus nor Nym-Tonks,” She broke off as the fire alarm sounded. “Oh, merde!”
“Yeah,” Harry replied. He faked a huge grin just for Charlie’s sake. “I’m doing great! And yourself?” He hated himself for lying to everyone all the time.
Harry pushed himself on top of the blond and started tickling him. Five minutes later, the tears ran down both of the men’s faces from laughing so hard.
“You said it. You said his name.”
"Why not?" he retaliated.
“Here you go, Polonius,” He said to Andromeda’s owl. “Take this to Draco Malfoy.”
"Yes. And I'm sorry about that."
to wreck us?” Draco asked.
“Harry, is everything okay?” Andromeda asked. Teddy was sitting on her lap, and her sister Narcissa was sitting to her right.
He smiled at her like nothing had happened. God, he was tired of pretending like nothing had happened. Why couldn't—
It wasn’t funny and Draco didn’t laugh.
[Thank you. You are always handsome.]”
“I’ve done white twink hair, don’t worry.” Draco rolled his eyes again, earning another giggle from Fab.
“Well, that’s good. I suppose. How...is he? Do you know? Have you two spoken?”
"Hmm?" Draco asked.
“You were staring at the floor. You’ve barely even touched your food. It’s nearly 9PM, Harry. Are you okay?”
"When do you start?"
“Andromeda, you didn’t have to do that.”
"I want to kiss you, too. So yes," Draco replied.
Lucius had hardly spoken during the Christmas visit, which was strange in comparison to their usual monthly visits. He would normally bicker at Draco, berating him for his hair or clothes or uninterested demeanor. The last time, however, he simply sat there. His hair was falling out, and the guards had told them that that was due to lack of sunlight and food. Many of the prisoners were so depressed or anxious that they were refusing to eat or speak, and it appeared that Draco’s father had followed the same route. The time between early November and Christmas didn’t seem that long, so Draco was at first confused at what seemed to be his father’s abrupt behavior change. Yet Draco had spent the past several months thinking about it, and he
Breakfast went by quickly. Andromeda tried to sound excited about Harry's plans for that day, but she really just sounded a bit confused. After his therapy appointment, Harry was going to go to another university tour. The month of July had been filled with tours, and he had already visited the University of London, the University of Westminster, Middlesex University, and the University of Manchester. Today, at two, Harry was going to visit the University of Manchester again.
“No clue. I think that I know what’s next, though.”
As Harry wandered onto the uni’s campus, he observed his surroundings and thought back on his life. Was this really where he wanted to end up: not as an auror or Quidditch star, but rather a muggle student? Yes, he decided.
“Please, sit and join us, Harry,” Andromeda finally chimed in.
Harry
Nevertheless, in his last letter to Draco, he had agreed to hang out on Saturday, the fourth of March. If their relationship was going to grow, though, their friends would have to find out.
2. You are not bad.
The blonde turned her attention to Teddy, “
“Je crois que j’aie les mozzarella sticks, et toi? [I believe that I will have the mozzarella sticks, and you?]” Malfoy asked.
“All of them!”
He grabbed his coffee and walked outside to smoke a cigarette. It was a nasty habit that he’d picked up from Andromeda. Was it stupid? Yes, but sometimes stress makes a person do stupid things. They smoked outside in order to keep Teddy safe, of course. Stupid does not equate to selfish.

Hermione’s eyes lit up and a small smile played at her lips.
“Three plus three plus three.”
.          Maybe he'd thought of Malfoy a bit, but it was only because Andromeda brought it up at dinner.
“Forgetfulness is going to be the death of me,” he thought aloud. “Gotta lock this damn door.” He put his books down on a table and looked around, assessing the cleanliness of the place. Nothing was truly
Harry walked Ron to the floo chimney and waited a few minutes to travel to his own home.
The rush was just dying down when Draco noticed a large group of people entering. He didn’t think anything of the group until he noticed Neville Longbottom heading towards the bar. Draco began to panic. He checked out the rest of the group and saw Potter, Granger, a few Weasleys, and Luna Lovegood. Draco crouched down behind the bar. He crawled out the door, earning a nervous and confused look from Xavier. Draco didn’t care. He couldn’t let them see him.
“Seriously,” Harry replied, maintaining eye contact.

.          "I do hope he's doing okay," she said somberly. Harry could see her adding to the frown lines that were already etched into her face. "I hope he's eating enough. Does he seem okay when you see him on campus?"
“I do.”
“I don’t know. One hit. I smoked it.”
“So, heard any good jokes lately?” Draco mocked.
of this. He couldn’t just sit around and wait for the information to pop into his head. He decided to go on a broom ride to clear his head. Grabbing a light jacket, he headed outside quickly. He rode around London for an hour or two before he got bored with the familiar sights. Harry made a conscious decision to go to the University of Manchester. It was the first time that he went there without it being sleep-flying or simply passing through. The trip only took him an hour, and it was only that long because he’d chosen to fly so slowly. When he arrived at the campus, he landed just behind the Williamson Building. It looked very different to him now that he wasn’t high. He hid his broom behind a bush and casted a concealment charm for it.
They spent approximately two and a half hours shopping for Teddy, then they decided to go for lunch.
“I think that this is actually a tavern—not a café. Do you still want to eat here?”
“Is that—? It isn’t. It’s-It’s Harry Potter!” he screamed.
Draco waited a few seconds before talking, as if he was turning over the possible answers and outcomes in his head. He seemed to script a sufficient response because he nodded to himself and replied, “I like you in a romantic way, too. I really wanted to kiss you…both times. But…I feel like…getting romantically involved would not be our best…option.”
Harry replied, “Eh. It’s all computer graphics.”
“Jesus Christ, Andromeda! You said ‘small trinkets.’”
Harry didn’t know how to start out, so he decided to let the kids ask questions for ten to fifteen minutes. He picked a small Indian boy first.
“Sounds fun.”
.          “I have to go,” he claimed. “It’s was nice, um….it was nice. Have a nice trip.” He turned to Harry and nodded curtly. “Nice day, Potter.” He turned and walked away from them.
“Narcissa’s son?”
Draco put the toddler on his back and bounced around the room. He asked Harry, “Did you like the internship?”
.          “Hello,” he said. It didn’t seem that he was going to offer more.
Harry smiled and said, “Probably.”
“Where do you want to talk?” Draco asked.
“Oh-oh my God.”
Harry worked on his homework until 8 AM when he heard a tap on the window. A large, light brown owl held a letter and a copy of the
"What?" Harry said.
Harry smiled, and this time it didn’t feel so fake. He nodded, “Yeah, that’d be great.” He threw his coffee cup away and followed Charlie out the door.
[Why do Harry and you speak different, grandma?]”
“Yes, he was quite interesting if you bothered to stay awake,” Draco smirked.
"About?"
“How much were you guys fined?” Harry asked.
“Err…”
Draco swore out loud when he realized that it was Potter. “Really, a whole god damn university, and he
Harry ordered two Sweet Alabama burgers, an Average Joe burger, and three Oreolicious milkshakes. He knew that Andromeda would not be happy with him buying a two-year-old fast food, but he was already prepared to offer to eat Teddy’s portion. Harry smiled as he stepped behind the restaurant and apparated back to his home.
[yes, yes. Let’s go!]”
Harry smiled to confirm her suspicions.
TW bars, alcohol, food, drugs, pills, cigarettes
“Ron. Shut. The. Hic. Up. You can’t boss me around. We’re not kids anymore. So, whoever is going to order drinks for us, I will have a martini,” Ginny barked. Her hiccups continued. She wasn’t even slurring her words, but the blush that crept up on her face and neck was enough to convince everyone of her inebriation.
The sky was dark and the atmosphere was cold. Not a star was in sight and it appeared to be either a New Moon kind of evening or extremely cloudy. When Harry lied down, it was clearly afternoon. Surely he hadn't slept until the late evening? He rolled over on his side and checked his alarm clock.
Longbottom gave Potter a perplexed look. He asked, “One for Ginny and one for Hermione, right?”
. [He’s napping.]”
"So," Draco said with an exhale. "I am sorry."
Draco filed the thought away and observed Potter’s face. He looked much happier than he did that night in the pub, strangely. The bags under his eyes were gone.
“‘Awwy!” Teddy squealed.
"Harry, that's wonderful!" Luna exclaimed.
“Well, maybe that’s just the way the Force works. Luke held Darth Vader off in a lightsaber fight even though he wasn’t as well trained. Besides, sometimes that’s just what happens. Heroes get lucky.”
They were led to a booth. The waiter retreated after two coffees were ordered.
“I dunno. I just don’t want to do Alchemy today.”
“So, are you gonna help out in the reconstruction of Hogwarts, Draco?” Harry asked.
“Gryffindors?”
“Mermaids?”
“I suppose it didn’t help that you told her that,” Andromeda said solemnly.
Malfoy looked up and Harry nodded.
“Hey, Draco. What’s up?” Harry said.
Draco
“Y’know,” Harry said. “I couldn’t access the bank for a few months after the war. Teir policy against thieves apparently included me.”
Harry knew that his boyfriend as still uncomfortable around Luna because she had been a prisoner in the Malfoy Manor, so he tried to manipulate their conversations into small talk. It wasn't the best thing, but Draco would do the same for him.
.          “Yeah…” Harry kept watching. He didn’t look away until the white-blond hair disappeared.
Draco jumped off the couch when his alarm clock went off at noon. He wiped the sleep off his eyes. Before he apparated away, he drank another cup of coffee and poured out food for his two cats, Halloween and Cauliflower. He kissed them goodbye, locked his door, and went to the probation office.
Harry
“Hard day?” Harry asked.
“Nightmares?”
“Thank you…” Draco said after a prolonged silence.
“All right, everyone,” Harry announced. “What we’re going to be working on is ‘squares.’ Who knows what a square is?”
“Er,” Harry said. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to...uh...jeopardize you by interacting with your mother.”
Draco giggled and Harry found himself to be staring at the blond again. He noticed that the cold had caused Draco's lips to swell a little bit. Draco caught his eye and Harry looked away, ashamed to be seen staring.
Harry was at a loss for words. He did not expect Malfoy to be gay. But, after all, he didn’t expect himself to be bi, nor Ginny to be bi, nor Luna to be pan. Well, he wasn’t surprised about Luna.
The day droned on for about seven hours. At 4:30, Harry went to meet up with Draco. Their plan that day was to chill in London. The wanted to see the park and go shopping, but, most important, they wanted to see each other.
Harry waited by the owl window for what seemed like hours. He felt silly. He felt likesome teenage girl waiting for her crush to text her back. He let out another exasperated sigh and moved to get some leftovers out of the fridge.
They sat down and Ginny immediately leaned forward and asked, “So, what do you think about Hermione and Ron?”
Draco nodded, and they started walking back to the apartments again.
“Harry? White chocolate mocha,” the barista called, knocking Harry out of his own head.
Soon enough, the professor dismissed the class, and Draco practically ran out, eager to escape. He felt his heart beat rise and his breaths quicken. He fought off the panic attack as he moved towards the closest men’s bathroom.
“I’m sorry,” he replied. He didn’t say anything else. He just walked past her and back behind the bar counter. Xavier looked positively relieved at the sight of Draco. Draco looked around and spotted Potter and Longbottom’s group in the very back of the bar. He gulped, not quite ready for whatever tonight would entail.
.          Draco offered his hand, and the officer took it. The blond got up and left. He checked his watch: it was 4PM. He was surprised that the appointment took so long. He walked down the hallway, passing the lift, and he made his way towards the designated apparation section of the floor.
“Okay?” Hermione replied in a questioning tone.
Harry turned around and walked toward the blond, but was surprised when he was motioned to come back behind the building. Harry blinked, looked around, and joined Malfoy.
So, three table-enlarging spells, twenty sets of silverware, forty napkins, and twenty chairs later, Harry was tired. It didn't help that he realized that he'd forgotten Teddy.
Harry couldn't stand ignoring the press. He would barely even look at them or reply or even acknowledge them, but they still did not let up. It was exhausting.
“Because the
“I ordered for us already,” she said.
I would love to join you for dinner. It’d be nice to spend time with Andy and Teddy, also. Thank you. Please send me an owl so that I know the time and place.
The dizziness and low blood sugar hit Draco when he stepped out of the shower. He performed a few minor healing charms on his arms and thighs; consequently, he made himself dizzier as a cleaning alcohol-like smell came over him. He faltered towards the kitchen. He grabbed a piece of bread to munch on as he cracked an egg into the skillet on the stove. Draco tried not to keep much food in the house, but he was sure to always have fruit, bread, and eggs in case something like this happened. He didn’t like to eat much, for the uppers he took decreased his appetite most of the time. He ate the egg—sunny side up—slowly and with certainty. If he ate it slowly enough, he wouldn’t be too hungry afterwards. As he swallowed the last bits of the egg, he thought back to his father—sitting in Azkaban, his long, white-blond hair gradually falling out. Draco was going to buy some brown hair dye today.
Draco shrugged, “Why?”
“I’ve been meaning to bring it up to you for a while.”
, he decided,
Draco cleared his throat, “And the press?”
Harry wanted to laugh, but he knew that the boy was sincere. “Well, Davie,” he said. “Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is about one quintillion kilometers. All of London is only one thousand and five hundred kilometers. I think that it would be
“Cool it, you tweaking twink. It’ll be okay. Just, lie low. Try to stay calm. Eat something. I can call a friend if you need help coming down,” She said. She reached out to touch his arm, but she dropped her hand. Was she always this reluctant to touch him? How long had it been since he’d hugged someone? Why the bloody hell did his meth brain
After dinner, Harry retreated to his room. What were his interests? He liked Quidditch, yes. But what else did he like? Teddy. Cooking. Cleaning.
“Anything but bloody Alchemy. I didn’t care for the subject at Hogwarts! Why would I care for it now?” Ron stabbed his fork into his kidney pie.
Harry awoke to Teddy jumping on top of his bed. His tiny feet would occasionally hit Harry in the legs. Harry just lay there—his brain still not working enough to make him get up. It took another minute or two for Teddy’s jumps to travel up his legs, forcing Harry to jump up and cover his groin when the toddler’s left foot almost landed there.
P.S. Don’t spill the fizzing whizbees”
“Well, we’re best friends…”
He spent the next three hours showering and drinking coffee and smoking and cleaning his room and doing his Algebra and French homework. Around seven, he decided to sit outside and watch the sun rise. He loved the peaceful environment of dawn, especially after an all-nighter.
Harry groaned. They had been working on it since 6 PM and had so far finished both chocolate batches.
’ is ‘to awaken.’ Do you want to wake him up?”
“Dementor!” Harry called out. He wasn’t sure why he was announcing it or to whom. He was alone, wasn’t he? He was…. Everything went black.
“Drugs are dangerous.”
“I’ll be in the living room with Teddy,” said Andromeda. “I wouldn’t want to invade on your private conversations.”
“I’m so sorry,” Draco said. He started to harshly rub his knuckles across his left forearm where the Dark Mark was.
“Well, I’m glad the list is so short,” Harry joked.
His insomnia and nightmares had lessened since he started going to the PTSD meetings, but they still sprung up every now and then. He got out of bed. It was 9:34 AM. Harry had gotten almost six hours of sleep; he was up all night completing a sociology project, so he decided to skip Econ that morning.
“That’s right,” Harry said, smirking.
Harry glanced around awkwardly and then finally said, “Er— well, I’m sorry. I’m sure that your parents weren’t deliberately trying to hurt you. I know they’re probably not the most...er...open-minded people, and they just...didn’t know how to react.”
Ron and Hermione showed the pair into the back garden where a stone had been placed in the child’s honor. It was simply engraved with her name: Adrielle Vega Weasley.
The rubble was disturbingly colorful which drew his attention as Harry picked up a large stone fragment that was obviously from an intersection of stones. Red, green, blue and yellow came together in a strange shape and Harry almost dropped the fragment as he noticed something a few feet away.
"Your grandfather recovered but not for long and when he did pass away it was just after James graduated from Hogwarts." She explained. "Your grandmother passed not long after him and James handled it as well as he could. He got a job as an auror and the barony would've conflicted with that so he followed the advice of many people and put it off for a few years. He and Lily married and had you...you know the rest."
Draco recalled instantly that his husband was a Parselmouth and backed up.
The elf popped in to see what Harry was talking about but didn't stay.
~oOo~
Harry said as he helped the snake get back into place on the door knocker.
As the spell ended, Roody’s lips curved into a grin as he bowed to Harry. “Master Harry called?"
"I'd suggest this nearby coffee shop I know but you work there." Harry chuckled softly. "Do you have any ideas?"
Harry nodded. "Yes. Especially since I can shrink them to go in a pocket. Now, Dudley's trunk will only need five compartments. The ones for his wardrobe and a catchall."
“Please sign the papers…Master…” Draco asked in a pained whisper. It wasn’t creative but he supposed it would do.
Harry considered that a moment. "I'll visit the vaults at a later date. Right now, we just need money for two new wardrobes."
Draco moaned and whimpered until Harry allowed him to rinse the suds off.
"I did feel a little weird ordering it but you're the one who has to eat it." Harry smirked. "You know, Dray; that reminds me of something."
"Hey, we're almost to the castle, so you should probably get into school robes." Came a shout from somewhere in the compartment. Harry quickly conjured several blankets and hung them up to form changing room in the back of the car, he saw several others including both Hermione, and the Weasley's use them.
Potions Tutoring Classroom, Dungeons, Hogwarts
Neville sighs "Sirius we need to know what the full plan is to be able to fully combat it."
In the case of any inheriting a seat on the Wizengamot High, middle, or low, they are to be given into the hands and training of a Protectorate house. See Page 5 for the list of requirements to become one. The protectorate house ware then charged with training said heir to fully meet the standards set by Albion law. Or for ten years which ever is the shorter time. In exchange for this training and protection the protectorate houses will hold the proxy for their Wizengamot seat for that time and enable's them to form sign and enforce, betrothal contracts.
Neville once more followed him as they would do one more time. "Lilly Potter nee Evans you were my godmother and you sacrificed yourself for my godbrother and my house will never forget that. In that sacrifice you allowed us to stand together though we are not three you have allowed us to be two and for that I and my house honors you and your sacrifice."
"Not what the law means, no it is the laws literal translation, which is just as valid, and would be used by at least one teacher that I know of at this school. The fact of the matter is that I regularly gather with Pansy and Blaise, Grandfather. I have taken to regularly attending the tutoring session I have with house Potter and its allies. I regularly have a Saturday evening Business meeting with Theodore Nott, Heir Potter, and about a dozen other elder heirs so that we can all learn some better business acumen from each other. I won't support a decree that goes against everything you and father have taught me since birth. You were the one who said I needed to start listening and paying attention to what others are saying about me as the heir of house Malfoy, what does this say about house Malfoy when half the groups he participates in are denied reformation such as the business club for the mere point that Harry Potter heir to the House of Potter's name is also on the roster. It shows that we the elder houses in Britannia have finally allowed and permitted something to come between our ranks to the point that you would allow a bill to pass that endangers our own heirs. Right now, I am ashamed to call myself a Malfoy."
Today however was finally Saturday, a Saturday without meetings or homework to catch up on. It was also a Hogsmeade weekend, and Harry and Viktor were going into town to celebrate later with many other students that needed a break from classes. Being November 25th, many students had begun to review for the winter exams that would take place before they went home on the 15th of December. With it also being the second to last Hogsmeade weekend before break many students were also looking at Christmas presents for loved ones, family, and friends. Harry was rather relieved, in potions the project they were currently working on in groups was there winter final, in defense the final was simply to take the knights test given on several dates over the holidays, his other classes, would be far easier Harry had no doubt but was studying none the less as his comments about his grades a few weeks before had angered several of the teachers who had begun to challenge and belittle him in classes, before being severely reprimanded for it by the ICW board still in the school.
“Did you kill Peter Pettigrew?”
Hogwarts, Scotland, England
“Firstly,” states Harry, “it is Heir Potter, before any contest, I bear the ring of my house,” he holds up his right-hand fingers spread. “Secondly I do indeed have a defense. But first I have a question, for the Ministry. Where was the Patronus cast?”
“Ok, let me start at the beginning then, as you don’t know what happened.” Tonks said. “but before I start that expand your mirror and allow me to link in a few other mirrors. It will be easier if we can all explain at once, rather than you receiving pieces from all of us at different times.” After Artemis, and the rest of Harry’s house had all been linked in and most of the Royals had left, Tonks motioned for Artemis to begin.
Minerva finally speaks, "Hagrid and I can look out for him in Hogsmeade, it shouldn't be too much trouble."

"Don't tell me you bought them." Draco said. At the look on Harry's face he continued. "Harry they've been closed down for years, it would take a couple million Galleons to repair them."
"The next title comes at 50 generations and is Most Ancient and Most Noble, at this point the house is about 1500 years old. This title comes with both a generational requirement, and a monetary requirement. The minimum of 4 votes comes with this title. Traditionally these votes are middle court votes. With the absence of any houses of higher status currently they are currently high court votes. These votes are also of a sliding scale, as the availability of resources of these houses also changes the number of votes these houses carry. Though only 4 votes are of the high court all others are middle court."
"Yes," Marcus answered tears in his eyes.
"Thank you, for illuminating that little bit, Heir Potter. Heir Malfoy, you may continue." The professor said.
They are all in the middle of dining when a series of owl’s swoop in first followed then by two more. The first was a letter stating that he was expelled from Hogwarts for the use of Underage Magic and that the Aurors would be along shortly to snap his wand. The second was from Dumbledore telling him to stay put, and not hand over his wand. The third was a letter stating he was no longer expelled pending trial set for August 10th at 10 am in Madam Bone Office.
Hogwarts, Scotland – Hermione's POV
"Well, is there a way to make a copy of a Legacy test?"
"Well young miss Granger, I'm fairly certain should be a Ravenclaw." Minerva answered.
“He could someday what? Defeat Voldemort? Silence Dumbledore? The man is a chess master, he’s three steps ahead of the boy and has contingencies for his contingency plans. The boy may have slipped his leash today but come September first he will be bound to Dumbledore again. As I said, it changes nothing, we continue as planned.”
AN: Well, I'm back my apologies I seem to have updated my other site and not AO3 my apologies here you are. Still no beta reader, so this chapter is a little rough. It cuts off a little abruptly but its better than some other places I could have ended the chapter. As always Read and Review
"James Potter you are an enigma to me. You are my father, yet I do not know you, as you were taken from me before I could know you. With my name you honored the house I was born into, yet until this year I did not understand the meaning of my name, as I did not understand who the men that embodied the names I carry were. I may miss you greatly, but I also honor that your sacrifice lives on in me." As Harry spoke and made his offering, power could be felt throughout the room, a power that was steadily growing.
"I mean no harm, but there are those that do, and seek to use Britain's bearers' laws to bind both you and the others, I am rather surprised Britains houses have not yet influenced the minister to do exactly that. No, I seek," He hesitates, before turning to Harry pulling a box from underneath his robes. Turning to Harry he hands it to him. "I seek permission to court, last year you showed the bravery of the lions my house seeks in our mates. You showed cunning against the dragon, a willingness to persist in the face of overwhelming adversity. Yet you treat those who have wronged you with a merciful hand. Will you Harry James Potter permit me to give courtship to you and to yours?"
“Which part exactly?” Daphne asked, a calculating look in her eyes.
“Wait, when you created blood rites?” Draco asked not quite understanding what the man was saying.
"That was the big one, I feel like that one was a big one, furthermore I believe it will only be the start of Umbridge and Fudge's work to interfere in Hogwarts, do not push her pup. Secondly you have had a full inheritance test that also spells out blood locked lines," at Harry's nod Sirius continued. "We are going to family blood lock that document, we are going to also seal it and give it to the goblins to hold on to this will inhibit anyone from accessing it or from someone doing a secondary in-depth testing. This course of action will silence the second plan of theirs in full before it can begin."
"The wards of Albion pass in much the same way, however, instead of passing whatever tests the ward stone sends at you to claim them, you have to pass the tests assembled by the very magic of the land. There is a reason Arthurs grandson not his son became the second king of Albion. Ultimately it is the land that chooses its kings, and Arthurs son failed the test of the land, of Arthurs three grandsons only one past the tests of the land." Harry answered.
“I am the current Lord Potter, Haldris James Potter, son of James and Lilly Potter.” Harry answered. “I had hoped to at least be met with common courtesy, perhaps to even gain some words of wisdom from those who have gone before me. It is a pity that as far as I can tell you are a prideful lot and…”
"Among all those responsibilities, I also have to oversee many of the business aspects of the house, and personally write letters of permission to every adult member of a cadet branch of the House for every job change, for all the votes that are cast for the house etcetera, on top of also going through every vote and law proposed by Wizengamot and the ICW as in all but official capacity to those bodies I am the head of House, and must give authorization for every vote. Even then I have also just added a whole new slew of children and families I'm to provide for until another house can stand as protectorate for them, among all my other responsibilities. So, no Miss Ameria, my answer of "I don't have time between my House responsibilities, and all my other classes" was not a joke. At this point I've already quit quidditch and received all of your censure from it as well. Moreover, for your information I never told anyone anything about what we talked about yesterday, but there were enough patrons in the hogshead, that any one of them would have told, now will people allow me to actually sit down and eat breakfast and perhaps read the paper for a moment so that I can actually understand why you all seem so concerned that I told something." Harry finally snapped, ranting and putting all his responsibilities out there for people to see. Come on this was common knowledge to most people.
"How dare you Potter just like your insufferable father…" started Snape.
The four good friends decided
As such the entirety of the upper year Gryffindors heard Harry's tirade at 8:30 when the Daily Prophet was delivered. The paper had an entire 2 page article belittling Sirius's sanity and his "foolish belief in lies sprouted by liars". The paper went as far as to call Sirius insane for calling both Dumbledore and the Ministry out for "mistreatment" of students and not following an "archaic and outdated charter".
“Thank you,” Harry responds, “will you be escorting us, or will someone be sent up?”
“Very well, for all four tests, I need you to once more prick a finger and 3 drops of blood, placed on each parchment.” Harry did so, hissing slightly as he reopened an only just healing cut on his right index finger. “We shall start with the inheritance ritual, I feel I must remind you it will only reveal vaults that personally belong to you, through inheritance or gift.”
“8,” said Harry.
"Grindelwald's greatest desire was to see the throne at Camelot, or the death of every ancestral line in the world if he couldn't, he never achieved either before he was imprisoned by Dumbledore, its why that prophecy is classified as broken. Did it come up in your search Harry?" Sirius asked from the doorway. He looked a bit haggard as he entered and took a seat.
For Harry the experience was far more heartbreaking, he watched as Sirius was arrested and then his treatment in the Aurors cells. He saw the gloating of Malfoy, and Fudge. How Delores Umbridge entered the cell and taunted Sirius about the plans she had for Harry. He felt the moment Sirius despaired. Harry watched through Sirius’s eyes as he was dragged once more to Azkaban and placed in holding cell and be told that he would have visitors shortly. He watched as Sirius walked to the window and spoke.
Harry was then looking down at the paper and was a bit surprised by what he saw. Where it had once said non-heir for the house of Black it now said Heir. "Sirius it changed!" He exclaimed.
"My apologies, Lord Protectorate Potter. It had been so long since the house of Potter had exercised the Power it was thought lost. That your house no longer held the protectorate title." Grovels the Prince's attendant.
“That may true in most cases,” said Harry. “However, House Potter has a house seat on the ICW and need not be presented by the Ministry, as such I promise you that the ICW would indeed be informed that this August body has broken their oaths and railroaded, over the rights of a Most Ancient and Noble House, for not the first time but the second. It seems that Britain will have to put up with ICW sanctions for the foreseeable future. Especially considering my three bodyguards are all ICW licensed Hit-wizards often called upon by the ICW to take care of dark or worrying wizards and or witches.” States Harry calmly.
“Enough, I have heard enough.” Stated Harry as the room lapsed to silence.
“Wormtail, get in here.” He shouted.
Despite all that Harry said that the week had gone well, and that he was glad for his friend's advice to get homework done as soon as possible, as by time the end of September hit, those who had been slacking where overwhelmed by the assignment load for the year. Overall Harry's first week of school went rather well.

"Settle Marvolo he's trying to rile you up." Dumbledore quickly soothed.
"Get up." Harry orders the prince. The prince visibly attempts to but is stuck hard to the floor.
The next morning Harry and Neville both rose and quickly getting dressed in much finer clothes than the day before where quick to join the celebration already going on outside the palace.

But now I'll give a warning
It was after things were wrapped up that Harry asked. “What did you mean by being family?”
“Very well Lord Black please take a seat.” Said Amelia Bones, as she was presiding over the case. Harry walked up into the Wizengamot seating and sat next to Neville carefully ignoring his Gran.
"Does Hogwarts have any wards standing at the moment?" at the answers of "no" his face turned grave. "Sirius do you know what going on?"
Harry takes a step back and learns more about both the laws of Albion, and his families legacy.
“They are goblin property, and as such were returned to the family of the goblins that crafted them.” Answered Sharptooth toothily.
Harry looked at her askance and said “You’re not pulling my bluff with that, are you? Besides who said I wanted boyfriends or husbands for that matter?”
Chlorosis ~ heir ~ Blood locked
“A pleasure to meet you, Prince Alomar, I am Neville Longbottom, Lord of the Most Ancient and Most Noble house of Longbottom.”
"A fortuitous response as no doubt that would have been a way for the Ministry to slander young heir Potter in the prophet otherwise. As for your addressment of him, I believe in the Wizengamot he quite clearly stated that he was to be addressed by his status, I suggest you do so." Abraxas said.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
"I will not however be grading on the content of your class notes, however I do expect for you to have at least six inches by the end of this double period. I will encourage discussion from your peers in this class, as long as it is kept civil. Do not be afraid to ask questions, I am a pureblood lord, just because a term is known to me does not mean it will to our first gens, or our students that were raised in the mundane world. However, be courteous, I do not wish to see that hand waving in the air. Light the tip of your wand and then raise it into the air."
"What?" Hermione asked.
Harry woke up on Monday morning and headed down to breakfast meeting several of his friends in the Great Hall as breakfast began at 6 AM, classes may not start for three hours but Harry had always been an early riser. "Good morning students I hope you have your homework done." Said Professor Sevine walking by. As the students passed Harry watched for Professor McGonagall needing to give her the updated letter from his "head of house". It was the same as the first but instead of merely saying titles now said professors actual name as Professor Umbridge had been given an additional title as well and could theoretically use it to give Harry detention. For some reason Harry's magic recoiled at the very thought.
Suddenly it felt warmth surround it. “I’m here little one, I’m here. What seems to be the matter?” The heat asked.
As Vernon left for work, Harry ran outside to work on his gardening, not wanting to be caught, not looking busy. He carefully watched as first Dudley then Aunt Petunia left Number 4 Privet Drive then carefully snuck back into the house to grab his wand from the loose floorboards and the weightless, limitless moleskin pouch that had been a Christmas present from his godfather, Sirius, the year before. Shoving both into his pockets he ran back outside and summoned the Night Bus. Never seeing his watchers apparate away to inform Dumbledore of this newest development.

“Why are you here heir Calmir?” Asked a voice from the back. “Last I heard you were in the Hittite Empire protecting the Royal Heir Kail Marsuli. What has brought you back to Britain, and what do you find so funny I know you have better control than that?”

"As I said before this one has as of July 31st been marked as deactivated so it's not something you have to worry about." Croaker answered.
Walking into the great hall he was not surprised to see speculative looks being thrown his way as he sat down for breakfast. "So, Neville what did the Prophet say about my date with Viktor yesterday?" Harry asked Neville who was reading the paper.
Ancestral Blood, long bound, shall be released
"None they are all eager to begin the theoretical lessons."
Hestia barely attempts to conceal her irritation.
"Ok, I'm not going to say I understand that but without taking that into consideration which house would ascend next?" Hermione persisted.
The bond of brotherhood
Draco was the insightful one that had put the pieces together. “Oh, that does change things, several things.” He said out loud, as dawning looks of understanding passed between both Hermione and Sirius as well.
"Well, not a whole lot actually, the article didn't get any space until page 4. No, that article was rather tastefully and artfully done, I think the article you are looking for doesn't actually have your name in it at all."
“Draco—“
“Do you like it? I did it,” a sing-song voice behind him asked. He turned around to greet Luna with a hug.
"The University of Manchester," he replied.
“All right, Harry,” he said aloud, “What’re we gonna do now? Well, I think we should wake up and stop dreaming. Good idea. But how?” He stopped talking to himself and got back on his broom.
