The weekend passed and Harry had spent it almost always in his room/bed, only leaving at night after curfew to walk a little, go to the kitchen eat the lunch and dinner he had missed and also think some more than he already was thinking. Harry also used this opportunity to show the school to his little snakes. He didn’t want to talk to his friends, not sure of what to say to them. He was also kind of afraid to face the other Slytherin kids. He knew the Slytherin kids of his year didn´t like him, maybe by Malfoy’s influence, very much and in full honesty he didn´t like them back, again by the way Malfoy behaved around him. The fact that the man that killed his parents used to belong in the Slytherin house was another thing that bothered him. He avoided thinking about that, because it leads him to think that maybe, just maybe, he was sleeping in the bed that Voldemort occupied when he was a student there.
Hermione nodded and returned to her table with a small smile in her face. Harry continued his search for a hidden table and ended up finding one all the way in the back of the Library. He sat down and took out a parchment and a quill and started thinking what he should write.
“The things you said and did, were indeed sometimes cruel and just mean, but we were children and honestly speaking you don’t have the best of fathers, after all he did try to kill me in 2 Year, just because I freed Dobby. And I can see that half the things you said it was just you repeating what your father said, but as I said we were children, we eventually need to grow up and realize the mistakes we made and try and learn from them and that way we get to be better people. It has only been a week since I moved here, but I already realized that you Slytherins are not the monster the other houses paint you to be. And it’s true, it might take a while to trust fully trust you, but you all tried to get to know me and to make me feel welcome, so you already have my forgiveness. We just need to keep going and getting to know each other better. And even though you did not ask, I would like to be your friend. And thank you. Thank you so much for apologizing to Hermione and Ron.” Harry said with a smile in response to Draco’s small speech.
-	Well, good afternoon! – The woman said unusually cheerful and waited for the response that came from every student in a mumbled way - That won’t do, now, will it? I would like you, please, to reply “Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge”. One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!
The Charms class, they shared with the Ravenclaws again, had also occurred without any problems and when it ended Harry was dragged away by Draco to finally talk. They found a classroom that by the quantity of dust in the desks and shelves hadn’t been used in a while.
When Harry woke up Saturday morning it was already close to 11AM, so the boy got up, took a shower and headed to the common room to finish his potions essay, before heading out to the Great Hall to have lunch. All the other kids of his year were already there talking between them. Harry noticed that Malfoy was rather pallid and unusually quiet, since he normally and rather surprisingly was one of the loudest in the group whenever they were in the common room.
-	Well, I don’t! - Said Hermione bluntly. - There’s nothing written up there about using defensive spells.
It took him a while, but he managed to get into the dungeons without being seen or heard by Peeves or the Ravenclaw prefects that were doing the round. He said the password to the wall and was allowed in. Fortunately, the Common Room was empty and he didn’t have to explain to any one why he was arriving so late. He went to his room and when he was looking in his trunk for his toothbrush and toothpaste he saw the small mirror Sirius gave him and even though it was almost 2 in the morning he felt like he needed to speak with him so he took the small shard of mirror with him while he was getting ready for bed and then went again to the Common Room and sat in one of the armchairs next to the fire place.
In the Library, Harry looked around for a hidden table since he didn’t want to be disturbed. Not for his surprise, Hermione was there accompanied Ginny, Luna and a black haired Ravenclaw girl. They seemed to be studying so he simply passed by their table and waved a hello to Luna and the other girls. When Hermione saw him pass she got up and followed him until they were hidden by some shelves.
When Friday came, Harry was dreading the day. He had a felling something was going to go wrong. Seeing as it was a free day and Harry had already done all home work he let himself stay in bed a few more hours, which made him miss breakfast. Draco was nice and brought him a glass with pumpkin juice and a croissant. He spent the rest of the day, until only 15 minutes were left to 5 PM, with his new friends.
-	For your information, I was already here when you got in so if anyone has to move it’s you, not me. Besides I’m not going anywhere until Opal decides to come back to me. – Harry responded rather calm, pointing to his snake.
-	Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it? - said Dean. - If we’re  going to be attacked, it won’t be risk free.
Later, when everyone was already in bed, his curiosity won, and he got up and went to Draco’s bed where the boy was reading a book. “Can I know what did you and Hermione talked about? You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want.” Harry said in a low voice since a few of the other occupants were already asleep. Draco nodded in response, marking the page of the book he was reading and putting it in the night table.
-	Your hand is not up, Miss Granger! - Professor Umbridge said and ignored her when she put her hand in the air. - It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you.
-	Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves? – asked Professor Umbridge in the falsest calm voice
-	Thank you, Harry! And thank you for trying to make Umbridge understand, I’m sorry that you got detention I know it’s partially my fault. If I had just kept my mouth shut you would have to serve detention with that demon. I’m so sorry! – The girl said with a sad tone.
Harry wondered around for quite some time, stopping to look at the shop windows. He ended up buying a few more quills and ink and a broomstick servicing kit. Harry looked at his clock and saw that he steal had a little over an hour left, so he started heading back to the front of the Leaky Cauldron when he remembered that he had promised Hedwig that he would bring her some snacks that she liked and a new stand for her, that way she wouldn’t need to be always in her cage. Harry headed to the Magical Menagerie where they sold pets and supplies for the pets care. He entered the shop and went looking for the shelf with owl’s food. He looked again to his clock and seeing as he still had time he decided to go and have a look at the other pets sold in the shop.
-	Mister Potter, what are you doing in my class? Your year only has a lesson after tomorrow. – Snape was his usual self when he was around Harry.
The aggressive knocking on his door forced the half asleep Harry to leave his thoughts behind and get up to go and make breakfast for his uncle that needed to live for his work. Fifteen minutes later uncle Vernon was leaving the house and Harry was in the middle of cleaning the Kitchen. Aunt Petunia would get up around 9:30 AM and Dudley would only get up way past 11 AM, which would give him enough time to star with the list of chores he had that was left for him in the fridge door.
Unfortunately, Monday arrived which meant that he was forced to get out of bed and go to the Great Hall to get breakfast with the rest of the kids. Harry open the curtains and got up, going to his trunk and taking out his uniform, then headed to the bathroom to take a shower. Besides him, 3 other boys were already using the cabin showers, which meant Harry, had to wait for one of them to leave. The first one of boys to leave the cabin shower was Malfoy, that upon seeing Harry informed him if that they needed to have a talk after he was ready and leaving immediately after not giving him a chance to answer. Harry occupied the cabin. It took 20 minutes for him to shower and get dressed still inside the cabin. The last thing Harry needed was for the other boys to see the multiple scars he had in his body. He didn’t need their pity.
-	Because he’s Dumbledore and he received a letter from you saying that, so he asked us to leave you alone. – Ron said still in his angry voice – He was really worried about you as all of us were, so we did what we thought was best and respected what you asked.
P.S.: Padfoot spent most of the weekend in his animagus form that’s why there is a paw print next to my signature.”
-	It’s okay. Hugs and petting my hair are things that I’m not really used to, but it fell kind of nice for the few seconds they lasted. – Harry said, his face turning deep red. – It’s rare for me to receive hugs, but it was nice. Just warn me first the next time you decide to hug me, please. I don’t like being touched that much.
“I wasn’t felling alright last night and went to the Infirmary to be checked out and Madame Pomfrey decided that it was better if I stayed the night in case the pain got worse, but I’m felling much better now. You don’t have to worry about me.” Draco said in a small voice giving him a smile.
“Hermione, Dumbledore was at my trial for a total of like 5 minutes and It wasn’t even to talk to me. He was there at the end because he had scheduled lunch with one of the members of the Wizengamot. He was like in and out.” Harry said, a bit of annoyance coming out with each word.
When he was already finished in the kitchen he went to his room to change his t-shirt for a tank top, since it was abnormally hot for the weather at 8:30 AM.
-	Are you sure, you don´t look that fine. – She said in a worried tone – Did your vacations go well?
“I wanted to apologize to her. During this summer I had a lot of time to think with all that happened and other stuff and I realized some things. I know what I did to the 3 of you in the last years was not the most exemplar behavior and I know that you may not forgive me or even accept my apologizes, but I realized that I really was a git and what I did was wrong, so I needed to apologize. And between the 3 of you I feel like Hermione, even though she was the one I interacted the least was the one I hurt the most with my comments. And yes, I deserved that punch. So, I wanted to apologize to her first. During this last week, I realized another thing. I think most of my behavior towards you came from anger and jealousy, you know.” Draco said in a soft tone trying to keep quiet.
-	Harry Potter, it seems to me that this is our 3rd meeting. I didn’t think you enjoyed my company that much. I see that you have changed and yet haven’t changed at all. Let me see what I can do for you… You still have plenty of courage, and your mind remains the same. What changed the most since the last time, was your thirst to prove yourself it has grown, with everything that happened lately I can’t really blame you on that. And this time there is nothing you can do except accept that I’m doing what is best for you. This time there is no space for discussion, I will sort you into the house you should have been in from the beginning … Slytherin! -  screamed the hat.
When they entered the Great Hall, Harry looked to the Gryffindor table and Hermione gave him a smile and a small wave, Ron looked back to see to who she was nodding, and his face darkened when he saw who her smile was to. Still Harry smiled back at them and repeated the gesture from Hermione. Lunch went well with everyone devouring the food in their plates and talking at the same time.
5- Both what Luna said and the speech by the Headmaster and Dolores are taken from the book, so I'm doing refernce to that here.
-	They are indeed very pretty! But why did you decide to buy them, aren’t they out of the list of pets allowed in school. – Sirius asked looking at the snakes.
“Most wizard kids grow up listening to the story of the Boy Who Lived, the one that destroyed Voldemort and survived the Killing curse and when I realized that we were the same age and that we were gonna start Hogwarts at the same time all I wanted was to be your friend. You see everything I ever wanted I received, so when you said no to being my friend it was the first time anyone had ever said no tom me, and it hurt so much so, I decided that if you were not gonna be my friend you were the enemy. And during this last week that I got to know you, I realized what an idiot I had been and that the impression I had of you wasn’t completely right. You still have no self-preservation and sometimes act like an idiot, but you are incredibly good. You gave us a chance, gave me a chance when we probably didn’t deserve it. You are trusting us even though you know who our parents are and who they kinda work for. So I wanted to apologize, because I want to really be your friend, not just because you changed houses and we have to get along, but because you are a great guy and I would like to be your friend. I know it might take a long time for you to trust me fully or even partially, but I want to try. And know that whenever you are in speaking terms with Weasley I’ll apologize to him to, I was really cruel to him, even if he sometimes annoyed me I had no reason to be that mean.” Draco ended.
2- I'm not really a talkative person, so I'm not that great writing dialogues, the ones in this chapter is most likely the biggest dialogue that I have ever written, so I'm sorry if it isn't that great.
-	Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the “whole point” of any class is. – The teacher started saying after interrupting Hermione. - Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way –
“Dobby, can you do me a favor?” Dobby nodded. “I was hurt during detention and I need something to stop the bleeding and to help close the wound and maybe some bandages. Could you please go get me something without being noticed or caught, please? I don’t want to explain how I got hurt to the teachers.”
They all knew how his life was living with the Dursley’s, they all knew about him being starved and locked in his room for days on end and being beaten for simple mistakes any one could make, so why would they think that that life was the best life for someone that had seen what he had and had gone through what he had.
He spent a few more minutes talking with the snakes before looking at the clock and seeing he had only 20 minutes before the combined hour to meeting his aunt. Harry was saying his goodbye to the snakes when he looked at the 2 snakes that had caught his attention in the first place, they looked sad that he was already leaving. Harry taught about promising that he would visit, but truly thinking about that he knew that the next time he would visit was the next summer vacations and by then his pretty snakes may already have been sold, so he did what every crazy person would do. He called the shop worker and told him he wanted to buy the 2 snakes. The man looked at him lake he had lost his mind and asked him if he was sure. Harry said yes. 10 minutes later Harry left the shop with the snacks and the stand for Hedwig plus 2 sunbeam snakes, as the shop worker had called them, and a huge terrarium for both his pretty snakes and a load of food for them, plus a book on how to take care of snakes. Everything besides his snakes was shrunken and in the bag he had with him and had a very useful feather light charm was placed on the terrarium otherwise he wouldn’t be able to carry everything with him. One of the snakes was hidden in the front pocket of his hoodie while the other was around the boys neck under the hoodie, otherwise they could be seen by aunt Petunia and she would freak over them, since she didn’t like any kind of animal that was a cat or a dog, because those where the normal pets people should have.
-	As well as they can go when someone doesn’t hear from his friends at all, is expelled from school for saving a life and has to face the Wizengamot and live under the Dursley’s roof for 2 months. – Harry says sarcastically.
Harry returned to the booth he had been earlier and got dressed. He was playing with his snakes, when the last person he needed to see opened the door of his compartment. Draco Malfoy had just opened the door and entered the place like it belonged to him, surprisingly he was alone, no bodyguards to be seen. And above all he didn’t even noticed that Harry was there, so Harry stayed silent, not wanting to pick up a fight. He wasn’t in the mood for that. Fighting with Malfoy always left him angry, but if he was really honest sometimes it was actually fun. It distracted him from all his problems and everything that usually happened around him.
Half an hour later, Harry was inside the Knight Bus headed towards King Cross Station. He was extremely relieved when the bus arrived and he was able to get off. Even though he was early there were already a lot of people in the platform 9¾. Among them were the Weasley’s plus Hermione and Remus. Harry headed their way, being spotted first by Remus that opened his arms for him wanting a hug. He accepted and very carefully as not to harm his snakes returned the hug. After that all the Weasley’s and Hermione turned their attention to Harry asking how his summer had been.
It was around 11 AM when Petunia left Harry in front of the Leaky Cauldron, ordering him to be ready to be picked up at 5 PM sharp or he would be left behind. Harry straightened the green beanie he had on his head so that it would cover his forehead and his scar. He never liked his fame and having his scar showing was like a magnet for others to came and say something to him. With his beanie he felt like he almost invisible and he liked that.
-	Harry, pup. I’m so happy to see you. Please tell me you aren’t mad at me for whatever reason – Sirius said both happily and worried.
Harry raised his arm to at the same time Hermione did it. The teacher ignored him and gave her a turn to ask what she wanted first.
When all of them were standing in front of the three legged stool with a hat on top, the Sorting Hat, just burst it a song and when he finished returned to his normal looking hat appearance. After that Professor McGonagall picked up the list of first year students and started calling them. When that task was out of the way was time for the Headmaster to say some words.
-	Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices. – said Dumbledore – First years ought to know that the Forest in the grounds is out-of-bounds to the students – and a few of our older students ought to know by now, too. Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in the corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch’s office door. We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Breakfast, the first class, that this year was taught by a women named Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank instead of Hagrid and lunch all went perfectly well. Now was time to have a lesson with the pink demon.  At 2 o’clock all students were already inside the classroom. This class was one that they shared with the Gryffindor students. Professor Umbridge was already waiting for them and when the last student sat down she started speaking.
Harry went to his desk, picked his books and left the class room and headed to the Potions classroom, he didn’t know where Professor Snape had his office. He supposed was somewhere in the dungeons close to his classroom, but he didn’t know where it was so his best bet was the Potions classroom. Luckily or not, Snape was indeed in the Potions class room. He could hear the voice of the professor trough the door complaining to someone. Since he didn’t want to embarrass himself in front of a bunch of kids he didn’t know he stayed hidden in one of the alcoves existent in the beginning of the corridor and waited for the class to end. After it ended Harry went to the class room to give the note to the professor. He knocked on the door and the professor let him in.
The summer was almost like second year all over but even worse, that summer the twins and Ron had rescued him, but this time they hadn’t cared enough to try it again. He started crying over this thought. His friends didn’t really care about him if they really believed something like that so easily, just like last year when Ron had been mad at him for so long because he didn´t believed Harry was saying the truth.
Harry abandoned what he was doing and ran to the kitchen to start his aunt breakfast. His aunt was unusually early so he hadn’t had the time to prepare it. Like he predicted 20 minutes later Petunia was entering the kitchen to have her food.
-	Come here, Mr. Potter, dear! – She said in an annoyingly sweet voice, scribbling in a pink parchment. - Take this to Professor Snape, dear.
“He didn’t say anything, I tried talking to him last night, but he wouldn’t respond, so I don’t know how he is doing. But that is really nice. I’ll ask him tonight when I try to talk to him again” Harry said absent minded, looking at his snakes having a play fight in the grass. They were really pretty with their scales shining with small rainbows. “Well, last night was a full moon so he couldn’t really talk to you, but how could you contact him? Owls aren’t that fast?” Hermione asked a little confused.
“I would like very much to be a part of the study group. It is a very good idea, and we all know we need something like it if we are going to pass this year. Umbridge is complete garbage when it comes to teaching. We only had one class and we can see that already.” The blonde said “It’s getting late and it’s almost dinner time, we should head inside. While you were talking, I sent an origami message to Blaise and the rest of the gang and they should be here any minute, Harry do you mind going first. I would like to talk the Granger before I lose courage.” Harry looked at the blondes face and all he saw was determination so, even though he didn’t know what the conversation was about he decided to comply and go on ahead.
I got Harry's time table from the internet and I´m using it even though it´s the Gryffindor timetable. I only changed the Astronomy class from Wednesday to Thursday because, Harry has Friday free of classes and it makes more sense to put a class that ends around 2 in the morning the day before a free day that the day before a class day. I also changed Potions to Fridays and Defense to Tuesdays.
-	I repeat - Said Professor Umbridge starting to get irritated - do you expect to be attacked during my classes?
Something you said to Padfoot worried me a little bit. He told me that you sent letters that were never received and that you didn’t receive letters at all, I find that very strange, but I want you to know that I believe in you. You have no reason to lie about something like that and Padfoot said you looked pretty upset about the matter. What really worried me and Padfoot is the fact that you reacted and stated that being with the Dursley’s was something you would never choose voluntarily. I really want to know if everything is alright with you being in their house. For the little your mother told me your aunt isn’t the best person to be around when you are a magical being, for that reason me and Sirius never really meet her. We are really worried, so please when you have the time answer to this letter. If something really is wrong with you staying in their house then we will try everything in our power to get you out of that house.
About the other question you made about the Dursley’s, your suspicions are correct. I can tell you the truth but is a conversation that I believe should be had face to face. All I can say is that the Dursley’s never saw me as family, but more as a slave. I really hope that both of you are able to do something, because Dumbledore knows and he never did anything to help and I know he has the power to help. He is one of the greatest wizard ever existed and you tell me he doesn’t have the power to help. I don’t buy that. The Weasley’s also know, but I can’t really blame them for not doing something, because they have already too many mouths to feed and not much money. And they help when they have me in their home for half the summer. When you and Padfoot have  the time, please come to Hogsmead so that I can see you and talk to you.
He had made such a huge mistake, he had handed Draco Malfoy something that could endanger the lives of people he cared about. He knew that he was now a Slytherin and that they supposedly protected each other, but that most likely did not apply to revealing very important secrets like the fact that Remus knew were a prison fugitive was or that the Boy Who Lived was in contact with said fugitive. Someone didn’t need to be a genius to understand what was written in that letter and who it was referring to. He needed to talk to Draco and plead for him not to say a word of what he had read.
-	Do you really promise that my friends won’t be bothered at all? Are all the other Slytherins ok with this? – Harry asked and Draco nodded in response – Then ok, I will follow your rules without much noise. And about the tryouts for the team, I won’t be participating. Even if I’m in the Slytherin house, I’m still a Gryffindor at heart and that means I won’t be playing against them in Quidditch, it’s enough that I sometimes gain points for you during classes and at the end of the year.
He left the room and when he had turned left at the end of the corridor and no longer felt like he was being watched, he sprinted the fastest he could, away from that office. If that was the punishment reserved for everyone whose opinions were contrary to hers, he would be the spitting image of an angel in her class, he didn´t need to be physically punished like that at Hogwarts too. The Dursley’s were enough. He finally took a look at his clock and saw that it was almost midnight. He shouldn’t be out and about at this time of the night, but thanks to the toad he had missed dinner and he was a bit hungry, so he decided to go to the kitchen and ask the elves for something to eat. He sneaked around since he had neither the map nor the cape with him and after almost twenty minutes later he arrived at the portrait and tickled the pear that allowed him to enter the kitchen.
-	Do not worry little one, both of you are the prettiest snakes in this shop! You don’t need to argue over such matter. -  said Harry to the little white ringed snake trying to make them fill better.
“Yes Dobby. Can you give me something that was left from dinner? I was in detention with Umbridge and I was kind of forced to skip dinner. How is Winky doing, is she felling better here at Hogwarts?” the boy said while sitting in one of the stools of the big table. A few minutes later a plate with rice, chicken, salad and a cup of pumpkin juice were in front of him. Harry started eating and Dobby sat in front of him telling him about Winky and how his week was going and how happy he was working at Hogwarts.
-	Using defensive spells? - Professor Umbridge asked liked that was the dumbest question anyone could ask. – Why? I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?
Harry left the Great Hall and was meet with Hermione waiting for him down the corridor. He walked up to her. “Hi, how are you?” Harry asked awkwardly. “Fine, and you?” Harry answer with a fine thank you and they proceeded to head out in the direction of the lake. Both teens sat under one of the trees that gave a little shade and stayed there for a little in a slightly awkward silence.
Harry smiled back and Malfoy face got slightly more pinkish. “Can you help me with my essay? I feel like I am forgetting something, but I don’t know what it is.”
-	Second rule you have to have in mind is that in any circumstance you are allowed to walk the corridors alone, now that you are a fifth year and have more knowledge in defending yourself you are allowed in groups of minimum 3 people, and if you see by any chase anyone with a silver and green uniform being attacked you help them if they need even if they don’t ask for help. We have too many students ending up in the infirmary every week, because they were attacked, so this rule was created. And this year is most important that this rule is followed, because we with the rumors about the Dark Lord being back we will be in the spot light more than ever, which means more attacks than ever even if most students don’t actually believe his back. For others we will always be guilty even if it’s by association. Everyone in this house knows the rumors are true, as you must have guessed, and know that we believe in you. Now that you are a snake we here to help you in any way you need. Third rule is an obvious one, anything you want to do that is against the rules you can do as long as you don’t get caught. If you are caught by any teacher that isn’t professor Snape you will lose points and suffer the detention said teacher gives you and you will serve another one given by Snape that will make you regret being caught in the first place. These are the house rules you have to follow, you do it and everything will go smoothly for you. Now some information that you need to know. The password changes every fortnight in Mondays and is always in the announce board for only one day so don’t forget to go see what it is when you leave for class in the morning. The Quidditch tryouts are in two weeks in case you want to join the team and this tear we are going to have to talk with the teachers about our future carriers so that they can help us better determine what subjects we should choose for next year N.E.W.T.S. Now that you are up to date, do you have any question or can we go down to meet the others and have breakfast.
The pink demon pointed for the desk right in front of her and signaled him to sit down. “During this detention you will be doing some lines, Mister Potter.” She said after Harry had sat down and with a wave of her wand one of the quills in the pink pot in her desk floated and landed in his desk. “You will be using this quill, that way I’m sure the message will sink in. You shall write, «I must not tell lies». You will only stop when I tell you to. Understood, Mister Potter?”
-	Basically, in a very short way yes, that’s exactly what you need to do. And knowing that you will be doing this even though I know you don’t what, I have a proposal for you. You follow these rules without fuss and the Slytherin stop messing with all your friends. We will only do something to them if they do anything to us first. If they don’t attack us in any way we will pretend they don’t even exist and won’t bother them for any reason at all, ok? Another thing, now that we are in the same house and are kind of being forced to be friends I’d prefer if you called me Draco instead of Malfoy. It may take some time getting used to, but I think it will help you feel more like your part of the group, sine we call everyone by their names. – Draco proposed.
Blaise started to raise in his seat, but Harry informed him that it was an important conversation and that it was private. Blaise reluctantly sat down again and let him go alone. In the last week, Blaise had been following like a puppy follows its master whenever Harry had to go anywhere outside the common room alone and he suspected that was because the boy was the only one that had never interacted with him before his house change, so all the others agreed that he was the most likely to not bother Harry in terms of being followed by.
“Tiring, mostly. Without you there it feels different. Some of the Gryffindors were not happy with your resorting and during the weekend it was basically the only thing people talked about. Ron was terribly upset and vocal about it, at some point I had to silencio him. I have been talking to him, he is hardheaded, you know that, but he is still your best friend he will come around. I am sure of it. And with what happened in DADA, I think showed him that just because you are in a different house that you will not chance. Just give him a few days and he’ll came talk to you.” Hermione said. “Now though the only thing you hear is death threats to Umbridge and people complaining about her. It looks like no one is happy with her.”
After a weekend hiding in his bed and learning some ground rules for his new house, the first week of classes begins. It could have gone better if the pink demon didn't existe.
In the night of the 31st of August, Harry went to bed happier and more anxious them ever. The next day he would get to finally see his friends that he didn’t know if they were his friends anymore, after all they didn’t write a thing to him the entire summer. Not even Sirius or Remus had sent him a letter. Not even on his birthday had he received a card from anyone. Not even after he had been officially expelled from Hogwarts and it had been in the front page of The Prophet, not even when he had to face the Wizengamot and had been considered innocent and been accepted in Hogwarts again had he received a note asking if he was fine or telling him that everything was alright with them. Nothing at all was what he received even after sending them letters after letters wanting to know if everything was alright.
They talked for a while and when the clock in the station marked 15 minutes to 11 AM, all the kids started saying their goodbyes and entering the train. Harry was ready to follow the when Remus pulled him aside.
-	Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it? - Professor Umbridge said looking at the students. - The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year. You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.
Malfoy stopped for a few seconds to regain his breath, since he had spoken without a pause and it didn’t look like he was nowhere near the end of the speech.
-	Well, we’re reading just now. - said Professor Umbridge. - If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.
-	Without ever practicing them beforehand? - said Parvati incredulously. - Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?
Yet again, Harry was woken up by his uncle’s fist banging in his bedroom door. The boy got up, returning his little babies to the terrarium, since he had taken to sleeping with them beside him in his pillow, before changing his clothes and hurrying down stairs to make breakfast for his uncle. Fortunately, this was the last day, for the next 10 months, that he was going to be treated like a servant.
-	Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard? – The women asked as soon as everybody had stopped copying what was written in the board. - When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply, “Yes, Professor Umbridge”, or “No, Professor Umbridge”. So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?
At this point, Harry was holding his breath, trying not to call attention to himself. It took the snake to slither to his shoulder and try to get in the boys hair for Malfoy to finally notice he wasn’t alone. Surprisingly, he was rather gentle with the snake taking her of her shoulder and placing her in his lap. With that the blond boy finally looked up, to see extremely bright green eyes looking at him.
Harry hugged him one more time and headed to the train to look for his friends. He put the little wrapped box in his jeans pocket. He would read it when he got to the booth. He found them in the 3 compartment in the middle carriage. He entered the compartment and sited in the opposite side from his friends. He carefully took out the things in his bag and put them in the shelf above the sits. He sat down and stared absently out the window while caressing both his snakes heads thinking about what Remus had just told him. It took him a while to notice that Hermione was calling him.
Harry followed the oldest students to the carriages that would take them to school, when he stopped on his track looking at the carts. There were winged horse like creatures where in the years before had been nothing, he considered that he was finally losing it when a small, sweet and dreamy voice spoke behind him.
All the classes in the next 2 days went well. History was the same it had always been and Herbology was interesting. Thursday he had Divination in the morning, where his death was once again predicted. Ron was also taking that class and this time when Harry looked at him there was a significant reduction of anger in his look, he mostly looked sad. And in the evening he had Potions, which went rather well at least for him. Once again, Snape’s favoritism was showed when he gave 15 points to Slytherin just because Pansy had saved him from exploding his cauldron. When Hermione did the same with Neville, the teacher was his usual self and immediately scoffed and called Neville useless. What was really welcoming was the lack of judgmental looks he was used to receive from the teacher. It looked like Snape’s love for his house was bigger than the hatred he had for Harry.
-	This leads to the first and most important rule of the house, if you have any problem with any of us you wait until you are inside the common room to discuss it. You never, under any circumstance, do it outside. The Slytherin house is a house that stands united in front of any adversity even if you hate the person besides you. Unlike the others we stand together until the end, one thing that you must have in mind is that we will never turn on you now that you are a snake. Most of us don’t like you and probably won’t start liking you just because you’re here now, but you can rest assure that you will never be attacked by any of us, if anyone wants to settle some matter and can’t do it with a conversation they will most likely challenge you to a duel.
-	Yes, these are snakes, sunbeam snakes to be exact. I bought them last week when I went to buy my material for Hogwarts. Aren’t they pretty? – Harry said with a giddy voice, petting their heads and happy that the conversation subject had changed. – This is Opal and Onyx.
-	No they haven’t, I deserted them if you really need to know. And you, why aren’t your bodyguards around? Have they finally seen the light and left you behind? -  Harry responded mockingly. – Is that why you were crying, want your friends back?
He scooped his snakes up and started walking to the castle leaving the two teens behind and ended up meeting Blaise and the rest of the group halfway there. With a few words the group turned around and headed to the Great Hall. 15 minutes later both Hermione and Draco entered the Great Hall and went to sit in their respective tables. Harry was really curious to know what they had been talking about but decided to restrain himself from asking and concentrated on enjoying dinner.
I hope you think I did ok in the conversation between Hermione and Harry and also in the conversation between Harry and Draco.
-	Harry! Is everything okay, you look distracted? – Hermione asked when Harry finally looked at her.
-	Don’t worry about that, you gave me the letter but you didn’t say I could read it, so I didn’t. In any other occasion I might have done so, but in the state you where it felt like I wouldn’t gain anything from it and that I was meddling in something that didn’t concerned me. – Draco said in a calm voice, which made Harry’s tears stop.
The food appeared in front of Harry and he served himself of some, remaining quiet during the entire meal. Around him people talked and sometimes would glance at him, but never once a word was spoken in his direction. He would sometimes sneak little bits of the meat he was eating to the snakes that were still in his capes pockets. He definitely needed to get a better way of transporting them around. When the meal was finished it was now time for the actual speech the Headmaster gave every year.
-	Yes, aunt Petunia and thank you for allowing me to go by my school material. I will start immediately on his breakfast – Harry said in a quiet and almost robotic voice trying to hide his happiness from his aunt.
Harry found it rather weird since he did not see the other boy in the common room and the light of the bathroom was out, but he decided not to duel on that and go to bed, after all it was almost 2 in the morning. Harry spent a few minutes telling them how the detention had gone, since both snakes had felt the smell of blood in him, and after a few treats of biting the mean ugly women they finally went to sleep.
When he finished the letter he left the library and went to the Owlery to sent Hedwig with the letter. It took him a few minutes to get there and before he sent the letter the boy had a one sided conversation with his snowy owl. He hadn’t seen her in a while and he missed her. After the owl took flight, the boy left the tower and went to dinner. All the other Slytherins were already at the table and when they saw him, started asking where he had been and telling him to never walk alone again. Harry explained after then they resumed their conversation that mostly consisted of them bad mouthing Professor Umbridge, which was a conversation he joined gladly. After dinner they went to their dorm and while the other kids talked Harry forced himself to do homework.
I realize that the conversation between Harry and Draco may seem rushed, but it all will make sense in the future, when I explain something that has a lot of impact in the story.
“Are you sure? Dumbledore said that you were incredibly happy to have won the trial, that your relatives would be very happy that you had won the trial and that you were in a rush to get home. Ok, why did I believe that? You would never be in a rush to get to your uncle’s house, you hate that place. Ok, something very wrong is going on. Why did he lie?” doubt and a bit of fear could be heard in Hermione’s voice.
“Good night, sleep well.” The blonde responded with a smile cleaning the tears. Harry returned to his own bed and closed the curtains. His sleep didn’t came immediately, he stayed awake for a while thinking about Draco’s words before falling asleep.
Harry hurried to make his cousins breakfast and after it was done he hurried to the bathroom to end cleaning it and to get started in the 2 on the first floor. It took him around an hour to finish his chores and then more 15 minutes to take a bath and change his clothes to others cleaner and less wrinkled.
I think that I will start to upload on Thursdays, since I have my Wednesday evening and afternoon free, but I can't promise anything.
It had been a really hard day.  Harry took his little babies out of the pockets of the cape and placed them on his pillows. He open the curtains slightly for him to get out and go to his trunk get his pajamas. He returned to the safe zone and prepared to sleep. This bed was more comfortable but felt a little different. It took Harry over half an hour to finally manage to sleep.
-	Please don’t tell anyone what you read in that letter! I can’t create more problems for them that the ones they already have. You have to promise me you won’t tell anyone what you read in that letter, please, promise me you won’t do it! – Harry said very quickly in a pleading and anxious tone with tears in his eyes.
“Yes, Last night, Ginny, Neville and I were talking, and we all reached the same conclusion. DADA classes this year are gonna be completely useless so we decided that we should create a study group to try and learn together, since the toad is even worse than Lockhart and that says a lot. We thought about getting a group of students together and studying in the library on the weekends since it’s when all of us have free time.” The girls said, returning the mirror to his hands. “And since you are the student with the best grades in DADA, we were hoping that you could join us and help us. We could even try to learn a few other spells that aren’t in the curriculum.”
Besides the animals allowed in Hogwarts the shop also sold kneazles and crups, puffskeins and even bats, spiders and snakes. Harry was looking at all of the animals when he heard low voices discussing about which one had the prettiest scales. Following the voices Harry found himself in front of a terrarium where 2 snakes where arguing. The boy had never seen such pretty snakes. There scales were such a deep brown they looked black in their backs while their bellies were white and both were about 50 cm long. One of the snakes had the scales in their head dark surrounded by a white ring, while the other had a fully dark head. And while they moved and the light touched their scales, they seemed to change colors from the whole rainbow spectrum. Harry chuckled seeing them argue and his sound made both snakes stop arguing and look at him.
He headed outside with Onyx and Opal wrapped around his arms, if people looked out their windows and saw Harry would think the boy had gotten tattoos in both arms. Once they were outside both snakes slithered down his arms to the grass. It wasn’t their ideal habitat but they sounded very happy to be out of the terrarium.
-	Do you really underssstand usss? We haven’t talked with a Human in ssso long. – said a greenish snake with a triangular head.
After that the girl walked to one of the carts and entered it, followed by Harry since most had already started their way to Hogwarts and there weren’t many left. The girl introduced herself as Luna Lovegood, which he recognized the last name from the magazine The Quibbler. When he asked her if she was related any way to the editor of the magazine she said that she was his daughter.
-	I’ve got a query about your course aims.- said Hermione which made Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.
“Harry, there you are, I’ve been looking all over for you. Your little babies were going crazy. I think they were looking for you, so I have been looking for you all over the place.” Harry turned when he heard his name be called, only to see Draco running in his direction. When the boy arrived, he supported his hands in his knees trying to catch a breath. “Hello, Granger. Here they are.” The boy said while sitting next to him and pushing his sleeves up, letting the little snakes out in the grass. “Hey, Harry did you get hurt, you smell a little like blood?”
-	Mr-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-wor se-for-yourself! - Said Professor Umbridge - As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.
“Hey, Draco, are you ok? You look very pale and I noticed that you didn’t sleep in your bed last night. Opal missed you by the way.” Harry said while sitting in the floor next to Blaise that had his DADA essay in front of him and was most likely trying to finish it.
His uncle’s breakfast was ready in 10 minutes and in 20 Vernon Dursley was living the house headed for work. Harry went to the fridge were his chore list was waiting for him, today the list was short since Harry had to leave early to catch the train. He only needed to clean the kitchen and take care of the bushes in the front and back yard. He started on the kitchen first since he needed to clean the counter, mop and wash the floor and it had to already be dry by the time his aunt woke up.
The rest of the week was spent between cleaning and being locked in his room for two days because he accidentally broke one of his aunt set plates. Even those 2 days passed quickly because now he had the company of his 2 little scaled friends. The times he enjoyed the most were the nights, because it allowed him to speak with his new little friends. The white ringed snake was a female, around 7 months old of age and the dark scaled snake was a male, around 1 year and 3 months old. It took Harry a while to figure what names to give them, which came to him while he was dusting the leaving room and his aunt was watching a documentary about gems and they showed dark gems, showing Black Opals and Onyx as examples of what dark gems were and from there came their names. That night, Harry went to his room feeling a bit anxious. He didn’t know if his little baby’s would like their names. Fortunately, they enjoyed very much being named after precious gems, and so the white ringed snake was named Opal and the dark scaled snake was named Onyx.
“Come here, let me see you arm.” Harry pushed away his sleeve and showed the words to the women. She examined them for a few seconds. “Looks like the message sink in rather well, Mister Potter. Have you learned your lesson, Mister Potter? I really hope you have because I would hate to have to give you detention again!” The woman said. Harry nodded in agreement and looking at the toads face he could see that the last sentence was a lie. She was eager to see him make another mistake so that she could bring him in and torture him again. “You are free to go now.”
Sorry for the delay in the chapter, I had some papers for university and then I started watching a cartoon with 5 seasons and I couldn't put my phone down so I ended up delaying the chapter.
-	But that’s the thing, I never asked for that. No one in their sane minds would ask to be left with the Dursley’s when they could go somewhere else where they were safe. Never crossed your minds to write a letter asking me if that was what I really wanted. – Harry said this time with more sadness in his voice than anger – And why would I even write a letter to Dumbledore of all people, and how would I know that you would see Dumbledore during summer. If you were really were worried with me you would have sent me a letter or at least tried to visit me, you would have responded to one of my letters. All I needed was to know that everything was okay with you all. This summer was hell with everything that happened and if you really believe that I would prefer to be left alone then you don’t know me as well as I thought. – Harry said while getting up and leaving the booth.
-	To our newcomers, welcome! To our old hands – welcome back! There is a time for speech-making, but this is not it. We only have I matter to attend to before you are all allowed to start eating and I deeply apologize for the delay. As most of you know by now, since it was the cover of the newspaper, a student in this school was expelled during the summer vacations. Fortunately for all of us this mistake was quickly resolved and he was able to return to us this year. However, since he was expelled, he was at the moment of the expulsion, erased from the admitted students of Hogwarts, so now we need to do one more sorting to admit this student into the school. Harry Potter, could you please, step into the front to be resorted again? – Dumbledore said in his usual calm voice.
Since the beginning of the sentence “We have a matter to attend”, Harry somehow knew that this was about him and only wanted form the floor to open and swallow him whole, he was sure the Headmaster didn’t need to announce this in front of the whole school. Awkwardly and without looking at anyone, Harry got up and headed to the stool. McGonagall picked the hat up and signaled for him to sit on the stool, placing the hat in his head after he sat down.
How are you doing? We heard about your resorting from Molly. In the beginning Padfoot didn’t take it that well, but in the end he calmed down and decided that even if you had changed houses it doesn’t mean you are going to change your personality too. We want you to know that the fact that you are now a Slytherin doesn’t change how much we love you. We know that we spent little time with you since we meet, but we do really love you. Just know that we are proud of you no matter what house you are in.
-	Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully. - Said Professor Umbridge in a voice of false calm.
-	It was an impulse decision, I just couldn’t let them stay in that store when they could have a happy home with me, besides it’s funny to talk to them. And as long as I don’t get caught there isn’t a problem, I’m sure my roommates won’t be bothered by them and won’t tell anyone. After all if I can speak to them I may at least do it.
The ride was short and after it both of them headed to the Great Hall to have dinner. Only when he saw the tables yet to be filled with food he remembered that he didn’t have lunch and was hungry. He headed for the Gryffindor table and sat down far away from Hermione and Ron. He needed time to think and so did they. He turned to the doors when they open to see the first years entering the Hall, all the same expression of wonder he had when he first entered the Hall.
Gasps were heard all over the class when Harry finished his sentence, the only exception being the teacher that was now smiling at him like she was expecting him to bringing up the matter of Voldemort.
“Nothing, everything ok. It barely hurts, so don’t worry. It’s not the worst injury I’ve had.” Harry said trying to dismiss the subject. “It’s not nothing, Harry! You’re hurt.” This time Draco was the one speaking in a worried tone. “Just leave it. It’s not the first and definitely it won’t be the last time that I’m hurt, so just drop it.” His tone was dripping anger, so both teens even though they were worried stopped pushing the matter.
“It’s okay. I liked it. It felt good.” Said the other boy going even redder. “I’m going back to my bed. Good night and sweet dreams.” Harry said while getting up.
The entire class followed the order and started reading. Harry hoped that this class would end soon, because he felt like he was going to fell asleep any second now of how bored he was. What saved him were the pokes Pansy was giving him whenever she saw his head start falling. What finally woke Harry up was when the teacher finally gave Hermione authorization to speak.
-	Dumbledore said you sent him a letter saying you wanted to stay with the Dursley’s this summer and that you wanted to be left alone so we left you alone, there’s no need for you to be screaming at us for a decision you made. Dumbledore said it would be best to do what you wanted, that way you could heal at your own pace. – Ron responded this time looking angry.
He had been too scared to let them out of their terrarium, but the chance of him running into his aunt today were small so he decided to let them have a little fun while he trimmed the bushes. Both the snakes were beyond happy to have a little freedom. Since he was taking the little snakes outside, the boy decided to let Hedwig out of her cage to fly around for a while.
That sentence made Malfoy look to his lap and actually notice that what he had just moved was a small snake.
I hope everything is alright with you. I’m really sorry if I’m the reason or even part of the reason you didn’t want to spend the summer with me, Remus and all your other friends. In the box it’s a small piece of enchanted glass that allows you to communicate with the person that has the other piece, all you have to do is call mine or Remus names and if we have the mirror with us we will know you are trying to talk to us. Remus also has a piece that is connected to the one both you and I have, so you can talk to him to if you need. I’ll try and have it with me at all times, but if you want you can also send me and Remus some letters. I don’t know if he told you but we are leaving together so address the letters to him, that way it won’t rise suspicion. I want you to know that I love you and that I really hope you are okay. And that I’m really sorry for not going to see you but it could be risky seeing as I’m still not under the Ministry gaze.
-	Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying, you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day –
Harry took a deep breath and then he knocked on the door of Umbridge’s office. After he was told to come in, he opened the door and was almost immediately assaulted with pink. There was pink everywhere. That was the office! A small space decorated entirely with too much pink and lace and frilly cloths. And for his horror, the wall behind Umbridge’s desk was covered with kitten decorated plates. The kittens were moving around and a few of them even switched plates. The vision of so much pink in the office was giving Harry a head ache, which he was sure, would only grow bigger with the passing of time. His dislike for the room must have showed, because the face the teacher directed to him was filled with even more hatred than the other few times he had looked at her.
-	Snuffles, I’m really happy to see you too. I’m a little bit mad that you didn’t answer any of the letters I sent you and for believing that I wanted to be left alone during the summer, but you don’t know me that well so I can’t really condone you for that. I just wish you had answered at least one of the letters I sent you or even sent me a letter at all. -  The boy said.
