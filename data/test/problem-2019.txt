“I’m afraid it is, dear. I heard it from Narcissa herself.” She adds, looking at him shrewdly, as if to gauge his reaction. Harry feels his eyes widen. “You know Narcissa Malfoy?” he asks incredulously.
“I am being kept from my work by the an influx of personal mail, it would seem.” He says, trying to be pleasant. More mail was starting to flutter about his face, and he felt it approaching his perfectly coiffed hair. He pushed down the impulse to set it all on fire.
. It fortifies his angry indignation. Malfoy seems too caught up in the dough-making to notice his reaction, after all, his back is turned.
Hermione smiled at him, tiredly. “I’m happy we put her on it; she’s acclimatizing well to the intersectionality of Wizarding and Muggle research”. Draco smirked back. “Oh, but I remember you couldn’t possibly hire her, such a young, innocent little girl.” He mocked. Hermione groaned.
“Yes, mrs. Picklewilly?”. She seemed more concerned than annoyed at his lack of attention.
“He doesn’t even talk to
“Thank you, Potter. I’ll come get you when I’m done.” Malfoy dismissed him, already perusing the buckets full of carnations, lilies, fanged geraniums, and dancing tulips. A bunch of ever-blooming poppies were shivering excitedly at the attention Malfoy was giving them. He smiled slightly, whispering “Yes, you’re very pretty” before continuing his search. The poppies nearly fainted in admiration. Harry snorted, hoping Malfoy couldn’t hear him or notice him watching.
“You know Teddy’s been ill” he confessed. Sanaz nodded.
“I need to talk to you about Draco”. He said in a low voice. His brown eyes looked angry, his posture screamed ‘hurt’. Oh dear. He dealt enough with Malfoy himself in the shop: he didn’t want some jilted lover (though wasn’t this boy rather young for him?) coming in and harassing Harry about it.
“Eh, yes.” He frowns. “but, how do you know about the drawings?”. Teddy had put them away in his desk, as far as he knew.
“Why yes, dear. We went to Hogwarts together.” She answers matter of factly. “We’ve been in correspondence” she waves her hand, and a new cup of tea is poured for Harry. He’s unsure what to think. Harmless gossip Mrs. Picklewilly, friends with Narcissa Malfoy? His mind leaps at all possible conspiracies, and he forcefully halts himself. Of all the Malfoys, Narcissa seemed the most trustworthy. Then again, she was one of the Black sisters, which wasn’t necessarily a reassurance.
“You’re planning to speak to him, then?” he asks. Hermione sighs.
, it declared boldly, showing a picture of Harry in his auror robes, leaving the ministry, obviously taken a few weeks prior.
want to be dealing with Neville's customers.
“Oh hush! Of course I do!” she exclaimed, looking slightly panicked.
Dinner with the Patils and their little boy was lovely, even if Draco was awfully distracted throughout each course. Their son Jason was a delight, smart and attentive, and very well behaved. Melany’s eyes went a little damp when she read the card on their bouquet, and hugged Draco fiercely. With Jason present, they didn’t discuss the ins and outs of Muggle schools, but it was unnecessary. They had just needed some reassurance.
“Do any of those use computers or cellphones, by any chance?”. Draco cocked his head, thinking it unlikely. Or they might, without knowing how to use them. Draco refused to think of himself of being in the same category. Yes, he might be pureblood, and computers weren’t his forte, but he had taken a class! With elderly Muggles!
new, gleaming pearls –real ones, unlike their Muggle equivalent, new ones simple
out, and not him?!”. Harry rubs his face again. He was way too tired for this. Marcus gets up, moves towards Harry, as if to touch him. Harry knows he can’t handle it, he might break if he does. He’s wanted Marcus to come to him for so long, to come and apologize. This didn’t at all go like he dreamt about.
“It’s the same message. God, I can’t believe he sent you a personal note and not me!” he looks a bit disgruntled. Harry laughs at the jealous tone.
“Harry, this is Lawrence. He’s one of Draco’s friends'' -the youth scoffs at that- ''Lawrence, you know about Harry Potter”. The boy –Lawrence turns just enough to send him a glare. Harry shrugs, not even trying to be nice, and goes to get himself a cup for the tea. He sniffs the air: chamomile and lavender. Not his favourite, but he could understand why Neville had chosen it. Neville continues to converse, unperturbed. He reminds Harry a little of Mr. Weasley, calm in the face of chaos –and upset youths.
were spinning on their old record player, and Teddy was making up his own lyrics while singing along –badly. Harry was in the process of mashing the banana’s for their banana bread, hoping to at least come close to Ron’s version.
“The reason I haven’t married a pureblood Witch, Potter, is because I’m as gay as a maypole”.
Malfoy huffed. “Yes, although I don’t see how it is any of your business.”
A few minutes later, Teddy came running down the stairs noisily, finding Harry had sat down at a set-table, nursing his already half-empty coffee cup. Pumpkin juice was sitting on the table, and the kitchen was slowly filling with a warm, banana-y smell. Teddy had delivered on Harry’s prediction, wearing various shade of –of course- banana yellow and vibrant green, clashing horribly with his still fuchsia hair, to his own obvious delight. His eyes, Harry saw, had switched to Harry’s own green, but his hair was for once neatly brushed to the side. All topped off with his purple boots, still a favourite.
“I can’t
“Does it matter?” he asked.
Was it necessary to repot the mandrakes?
Harry’s mind was reeling. “I can’t believe they asked you. Knowing they’d ask
“I will be, pup, don’t worry. I got you.” He smiled, and ruffled Teddy’s hair. At least he had Teddy.
He straightens his black robes, the row of silver buttons gleaming in a severe line from his waist to his chin. The shoulders are a bit broader, a bit pointier than his own, like wingtips. The lines cut sharply, deadly. The robes made him look every inch his namesake, and he knows it. If they wanted him to be a
Also, I've outlined 8 Chapters by now, but as I'm writing the story sometimes moves into a different direction, which adds to the number of Chapters. I sincerely hope you'll enjoy what's coming in the next few!
Sanaz had already turned away from him, but was smiling as she looked at her two nephews, Ahmad and Mehrdad. They were her sister’s children, but her sister and husband were visiting her husband’s family in Germany and thus were staying with Sanaz for the moment, to her obvious delight. Harry thought it healthy that Teddy should make more non-magical friends, and it was strangely convenient that he couldn’t metamorph currently.
“And, ehm, what do you correspond about, exactly?” he ventures hesitantly. Mrs. Picklewilly gives him a little smile, which looks entirely too sharp in her face.
house, while he was watching, and didn’t
God, what a prick, no matter how well dressed he was.
Harry missed the exasperated look Hermione and Ron shared, in that way they had, but he heard Ron’s sigh.
“Well, are you? –Here to help, I mean?” Potter asked him, sounding flat and tired.
“Amongst other things” he answered cryptically, although not unkind. Potter sighed at that.
The records were nearly all Sirius’s, but some had borne the initials of a certain R.J. Lupin and Harry had taken the lot down from under Sirius’ loose floorboards and kept them in the sitting room, where they could be used. It was something to remember the two old Marauders by, and he wanted Teddy to know this small part of his dad. While the ABBA was Sirius’, there were some excellent Bowie albums of Remus that Harry couldn’t wait to introduce Teddy to when he was a little older. Watching his godson’s elated dancing and utter original ridiculousness, he felt that perhaps he was doing some things right as a godfather.
“Come in!” Comes her voice from inside. She’s bent over, her curly hair already fizzling out of her bun, but still looking sharp in her navy pantsuit, opals glittering in her ears, eyes sparkling with furor as she pours over the documents spread out before her.
“Welcome to Spectral Sprouts!” It comes out rather strangled. He glares murderously at the Fanged Geranium, which was swaying back and forth gently now, not at all looking like it’d almost bitten his finger off. In had walked a familiar looking, lanky teen- young man, maybe. He was looking rather mutinous in Harry’s direction, like something about his person set him off. Most notable were his muggle clothes, a dark green hoodie and a pair of ratty jeans, not unlike the ones Harry was sporting. He was dawdling in the entryway to the shop, his shoulders stiff. What was more, Harry had the distinct impression that this young man wasn’t magical. There was a lack of buzz around him, something Harry noticed around magical beings, even the plants.
“I know all of this. What does that have to do with Teddy?”.
Draco studies the little purple blob on the magical photograph. It was swimming in darker coloured sphere, its heart beating, probably somewhere knowing it was wanted. His eyes started to burn.
. It’s the onions” came the terse response. Harry shrugs, and finishes making another pot of tea. He’s still feeling giddy.
Lawrence was a veritable blackmail-niffler. Born a Squib, he never received magical education at Hogwarts, although Draco was sure he would have been an excellent Slytherin. Clever, with a wicked sense of humour, Lawrence was what the muggles called a “private detective” –while still at uni, studying something called “Database Administration”, whatever that may be. Legal reform had made it easier for Squibs to navigate in the magical world, although they were still a marginalized and often discriminated against minority. Something he hoped to change, in due time. He'd love to see what Lawrence was capable off given proper education in the Wizarding world.
He flicked his eyes over the crisp, Muggle printer-paper again, and sighed. He definitely needed to stop feeling sorry for Potter, for crying out loud. So
Potter looked at him from under lowered brows. He looked rather grumpy, but it was hard to take a man seriously who was wearing something so
“It should be ready –HARRY?” Neville bellowed to the back.
All the awful things Malfoy had done and all the things he should’ve done were in that gaze, and Harry had relented. He had understood something uncomfortable in that moment. Something he didn’t want to remind himself of all that often, and which was before him now, yet again.
, and
“It will be fun right, Ted? It’s going to be sunny tomorrow, so we can have a fly in the backyard!”. Teddy nodded enthusiastically.

Malfoy stiffened a bit “If you
“You need more support for your department. It is no secret that it requires a large budget, most of which comes from old money; old families that feel thwarted because of your recent reforms regarding pureblood education.”
I feel like this is a bit of a boring, transitional chapter. BUT in the next one something is going to happen which I KNOW you will all love. I'm giddy with excitement!
Neville then proceeded towards the door, where the now muted mob was still pressing in on the shop. He switched the sign to ‘open’, and the first reporter reached for the door handle, opening the door about a foot. Harry held his breath.
“I’m sorry, Potter. That was uncalled for” Malfoy says quietly, looking away. His jaw is clenched tightly, and he’s still panting a little. He starts rolling down his sleeves again, but Harry grabs his arm, right above his dark mark.
leaving. That is
The news about his fathers retrial is spreading, and Draco finds that it follows him to work.
Come in, bring your pastries, whatever.” And he widened the door reluctantly, Draco stepping inside with a grateful nod, holding the pastry bag in front of him as a shield.
“Do we need to do anything about it?” Draco questioned. Potter looked up at him, surprised.
“Do I detect some dried sleeping-draught ingredients?”.  Harry was not about to admit to hating them; that would make them agree on something, and that thought was enough to make him shudder.
“Sure, Potter. Just let me finish this first, yes?” and he gestures to the sink awkwardly. Potter sighs, and seems to take him at his word, plopping down on the little sofa and turning up the wireless a little. There’s a Weird Sisters reunion special playing, and Draco hums along with the tunes he knows. He doesn’t see Potters eyes lingering on him.
“Potter?” he exclaims. Pulling apart from her, he steps back.
Harry takes a look at Teddy, who seems already fast asleep, and sighs. “Fine, then. Come along” he moves, waits by the door to let Malfoy through first. No matter how many times Hermione says he’s harmless (she says he’s ‘truly a kind person, Harry’, but that description doesn’t bear thinking of), he doesn’t want Malfoy alone with Teddy, asleep.
affairs
A little at home time for both Harry and Draco. Just fluff!
, Harry thought.
“Yes, but I haven’t- wait, what do you mean,  ‘too’?” Harry frowns, suspicion coiling in his belly.
“And Hermione made someone who hates me come into my house, to report back her” He said, not kindly. Hermione sniffed again. Ron looked like he was trying hard not to laugh. Sanaz raised a dark brow at Hermione. “Really?”
“But I remember little Dora coming home after a boy broke her heart, and it took longer than this, sweetheart.” She sipped at her glass, lips shiny from the liquid. “Oh, how she cried. Inconsolable for many weeks, until she was allowed to join the local muggle Karate class.” He could hear the smile in her voice.
” on stained parchment, which came by delivery owl just yesterday. No mention on that dirty scrap of paper of Harry’s previous owls, asking what had gone wrong, what Harry could do better, or even his desperate attempts to lure him back with his remaining posessions. The house could wait, at least until Harry wasn't so bloody exhausted all the time anymore. When the rooms didn't feel like broken visions of lovely future anymore.
“Ah, yes. I know it was due this afternoon, but I was already on my way and thought I might as well do it myself.” Neville nodded.
We see things from Draco's perspective. He works at W.E.I.R.D. with Hermione, has a penchant for muggle suits, and is still ever so much the Slytherin we know and love/hate. And dear lord, Potter has a beard.
“About your old beau dear, that tall, handsome fellow”. Aha. He pursed his lips. He had to remind himself he
This was it. The axe had fallen. The sword of Damocles that had hung over his head, had finally dropped itself in his stupid, weak little neck. Draco sat defeated at the polished mahogany desk in one of the little privacy rooms in Gringotts, eyes drawn to the distorted reflection of himself he saw in the surface. In the background, Blaise was tiredly arguing with their Gringotts Goblin, Mordok, trying to find a loophole that Draco knew well wasn’t there.
Ah, Potter will have arrived now then. He resists turning around to see if some of the slime –merlin, green, with mushrooms!?- has remained.
“Excuse me?”, he spluttered.
“You want to force him?”
“What are you saying, mother?”.
Malfoy smiled a little deprecatingly.  “Yes. As I mentioned, I am already late to dinner, and she has reason to be cross with me”. Harry glanced at Malfoy’s face, trying to gauge his mood. His curiosity got the better of him, after all.
“Was she not intelligent enough for you, then?”. Yes, the sense not to wear frilly robes before Easter.
He briefly thought back to Malfoy in his suit, beautiful and stylish, but so decidedly un-Harry that he just
have to get dressed?”
It had enraged Harry to the point of wanting to tear everything out, only to have the house figuratively dig its heels in.  Small protests from the house against pulling up carpet, somehow nailing itself to the floorboards beneath. Living room wallpaper rippling and changing patterns frantically when Hermione approached it with a peeler, only to have to pause and ask Harry if he still wanted it ripped off –and he had decided he could live with fleur-de-lis, since it wasn’t the Black family crest. Upon removing the ominous elf-heads, a leaded glass window had appeared, brightening the space with sunlight streaming in, nevermind that there were supposed to be neighbours next to them. Slowly, efforts to make the house livable became a negotiation instead of a battle. There were some rooms however, Harry daren’t set foot in, even after years. The formal dining room, the walls covered with the family tapestry, remained dusty and in disrepair. The attic and most of the second floor too, were still closed off. In the end, he had always thought those rooms would be filled with what was to become his own family. And, it had, for a bit. Teddy had come into his life and Grimmauld place at three. Filling up the hallways with wailing, sleepless nights in the dark. Little giggles of laughter, pattering feet on the stairs giving Harry heart palpitations and frantically finding spells to child-proof everything. Nights full of worry, when Teddy wouldn’t stop crying and refused to eat anything Harry cooked. Those nights, too, he had fallen down face first into Sirius’ old bed imagining he could still smell his godfather. Talk to him, even only in his head, because who could say it wasn’t real?
By the time lunch rolled around, the number of reporters had dwindled to a few desperate and frantic looking witches and wizards, who had gotten themselves cups of hot tea and chairs to sit on. They had clearly decided to wait it out. Slowly, other customers had come trickling in, and while they had all looked curiously at Harry, they had refrained from asking him any questions.
For a while, no one spoke as the pastries were devoured. Then, Draco noticed that the table started wobbling, ever so slightly. He frowned.
“Good, Ted. Look at me, okay?” Teddy grimaced as he swallowed, but the shaking subsided substantially.
“Well, Draco, I’ve already owled your mother. We’re meeting her later today.” Draco’s head snaps up to look at her, his cheeks bulging inelegantly with the waffles. They were truly excellent, after all.
, Granger?” She buttoned up her jacket, adjusting the magical seams ever so slightly.
A brief and very sappy interlude; A conversation between Teddy and Harry.
Malfoy sniffed delicately. “Very well. By all means” he said. Harry felt his annoyance rise  yet again, but willed himself to stay calm. They couldn’t get into a fight anyway, with Teddy upstairs sleeping.
My thesis will rule my life after this, although I still hope to keep to my biweekly upload schedule. As expected, my thesis needs a sound rewrite, and I'll be engrossed in that. I have however, drafted a sort of overarching plot, which is why you can see that there should be 29 Chapters in total, if I can keep to this plot-guide. I hope you're excited about it! I want to add in a little more angst and plot twists, although I must admit I dislike reading/writing angst when I'm experiencing stress in my own personal life. I hope I'm not alone in this!
It made him wistful, to see one of his family members being allowed to be himself, coloured hair and all.  He was secretly impressed by how Potter allowed all of it: the multicoloured walls, the mismatched socks, the jokes. Draco had
“And it is all out of some sort of Black- reconciliation?”
“So you
It had been so odd, Malfoy showing up and inviting himself in, that Harry hadn’t known how to react.
“You don’t work here, do you?” she has a high pitched, obnoxious sort of voice, and he’s already on edge. “No,” he answers curtly, drawing himself up. “I’ve been charged with locking up, however. Family emergency, you
“You didn’t even come here for Teddy, did you?” he asks, as he steps back.
He looked up when he saw Harry enter the shop from the floo, and smiled at him. “Ever the Gryffindor, right?” said Neville, over the racket from the windows. Harry shrugged, and gestured to the mob outside.
Potter lead them into the kitchen, and gestured to the table “Have a seat. Teddy, why don’t you get dressed and you can have a pastry.” Teddy, already poking inside the pastry bag complained loudly. “But!
“Harry”, he interrupted again, and smiled. The healer inclined his head, his hair flopping over his forehead.
Harry cleared his throat “I will help you, you know” he shifted back and forth. It seemed like his magic went a bit jittery, reaching over the counter towards Malfoy, as if fascinated. Harry steeled his resolve, pulled it back, and raised his eyes to Malfoy’s.
“Not Luna, please.” Andromeda smiled widely, knew she had won.
“That’s horrific, Granger.  Promise not to eat it in front of me, I beg of you.” She grins unrepentantly. “It’s Hermione, Draco. Sit down, we need to have a chat.” He raises an eyebrow. “A chat without tea? How crude”. Hermione rolls her eyes, but waves her hand. Draco takes it as his cue, and heads out to make some tea. It gives him some time to gather his thoughts, at least. ‘
“Let’s go downstairs. You can ask whatever Hermione wants to know, and tell her to stop pestering me with owls.” Potter proceeded to exit the room, and Draco followed him. But before he closed the door, he waved his wand quickly a couple of times. Clothes started folding themselves into neat piles, sorting itself in laundry and clean clothes, the former trailing behind Draco to the hallway. Another flick of his wand gathered all the other laundry lying around, and he directed that to the washing room he knew must be next to the bathroom. Quickly following Potter downstairs, he twirled his wand and vanished all the dust in the hallway. It was the least he could do, here. He gave the stairs the same treatment, and waited until Potter had his back turned to the kettle for more tea before doing the same to the kitchen.  Potter blinked a bit at the suddenly gleaming surfaces when he turned around, but sat down with a shrug. Silence fell. Draco cleared his throat softly.
The thesis beast has been slain! Or rather, subdued. I'm waiting for approval to rewrite my draft, and then submit it for my defense.
“I brought pastries!” he blurted out. The door halted.
“It is when Reginald suddenly invents a
“I must’ve misheard.”
“But, I don’t understand how, then? He was put away for murder, pureblood supremacy, crimes against wizardkind, all those things. Where’s the miscarriage of justice there!?”. Mrs. Picklewilly purses her lips, making her skin wrinkle.
“Shh, Ted. You’ll be alright. Come on sweetheart, swallow this, yeah?” Potter pleaded, stroking Teddy’s face with one hand, the spoon in front of his lips with the other. Teddy moaned again, but opened his mouth wide enough.
to meet that bastard’s face. He knew his own face was set in a scowl, and tried to reign it in. He didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. Edgecombe slowly turned towards him, and Harry could see the moment he recognized him. A slow smile, reeking of superiority, was slowly taking over his handsome face.
“What? Be meddled with? Not particularly, no. Being drafted into a war without consent was enough, really.” He answered dispassionately. Malfoy’s face lost some of its levity at that, but he pressed on.
“Let’s get you to bed, sweetheart” and ever so gently, he guides Teddy up the stairs, leaving Draco in the kitchen with the dishes. He looks around debating whether he could get away with more cleaning charms than last time, and decides
“Who’s that?”. Teddy came and peeked from behind Potter’s shoulder, and Draco spotted tawny curls in a pale face, before it disappeared again. Potter moved back a bit more, half closing the door already.
“I’m losing my patience here! I’m counting to three! One… tw- Oh, there you are, Draco ducky”. He yanks open the door to the smiking, red lipped smile of Pansy Parkinson, fresh from Vienna, dressed in a periwrinkle blue dress and heels that would break anyone’s ankles. Pansy Parkinson, bones of steel and friend for the ages.
Spread open is a
They were just about to close, when the doorbell jingled and a hurried voice sounded;
“They can query via the normal channels. I request you redirect mail addressed to me to our query box.” he answers sharply. “Please.” He adds, through his teeth.
Nightshade:      Falsehood (also, sending poisonous flowers is in itself a message, no?)
’. Harry frowned.
“Don’t play stupid, Mr. Malfoy. Your mother assured me you weren’t”.
“I’m so sorry, ‘Dromeda. I’m just really bad at all that stuff, you know”. He rubbed his tired face, and felt his newly acquired beard. At least he didn’t have to shave.
“I’m fine, really, truly.” He therefore started off, as a preemptive measure.
He apparates to the square in front of Grimmauld Place, laden with a large brown bag full of fresh produce and other food assortments. His arms ache: food didn’t adjust to sizing charms well, and he didn’t want to risk spoiling the cheese. His robes were warm, and he wished he had worn a lighter weave. He was sweating, and it wasn't from nerves, definitely not, he tells himself. It was just too warm, early summer and all. He quickly makes for the dark front door, and knocks the door knocker. He again hears the sound reverberate magically inside the house. He steels himself for another wait, but this time he hears the lock click after only a few moments.
“We cooked dinner, Harry” he says, excitedly.
“Ehm,” Harry started, “don’t flowers usually mean positive things?” he asked, “Like love, or an apology, or get well soon?”. He had no clue about ‘disappointment flowers’. Did they actually exist? If Malfoy wanted to buy some sort of rotten black roses or other dramatic shit, he was
“Molly sent a Patronus, she’s calmed down Victoire and Bill has come to get her home. Ron’s at work, he wanted to come, but you know how it is, and-”
“Let’s get him upstairs, then” he says, pleasantly.
“Well, you can fill out this form here with a formal request. Takes up to two weeks to process, standard procedure.” He was handed a multi-page form, full of tiny writing. He took it reluctantly.
They both look up.
Harry ate his cream puff, and the conversation carried on without his input, towards different kinds of Muggle education. Sanaz’s nephews now crowded around them, getting to the food, and Teddy flopped down next to Harry, reaching for a sandwich. Harry put an arm around Teddy’s shoulders, glad for his presence. “You ‘kay there, Ted?” he asked. Teddy nodded, and swallowed a bite. “Yes, dad” he answered, grinning. Harry scrutinized his kid again.
“I’ll find you someone, yes?” Harry stared at her.
. As was
“Don’t be ridiculous Granger. I know our bill still needs some fine-tuning, but it’ll get there.” He jokes, feeling inordinately pleased at her frustrated little slam against his chest, and she moves away a little.
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours” he prompted. Malfoy’s head turned, a slight grin spreading.
“Harry didn’t tell me! Ron and I met him in Mungo’s. It was... awful.” Her voice was heavy with emotion. Draco debated whether to mention he had already visited Grimmauld place, but chose not to. He wasn’t sure Hermione would approve the way he went about it, and he didn’t want to be stopped yet. He still needed Potter. But he could plant the seed for her approval, today. He tapped his finger to his lips, considering.
“How about we cook a proper family dinner, Teddy?”. Teddy shrugs, slurping around the juice of the apple rolling down his chin.
“Do you happen to know Mrs. Picklewilly?” he asks her. Hermione looks confused.
Hello all! Hope you're all well? Crazy times we're living in. If you're bored of quarantine (good for you, you healthy human!) here's something to tie you over.
“Enjoy your delivery.” Harry said, with a beautific smile. It cost him, it sure did. But he could see the polite nod cost Edgecombe more. Putting the flowers down on the closest surface, he hid his shaking hands by fisting them, and quickly made his exit.
Harry nodded, still not having let go of Teddy’s hand. “What happened, though?” he posed. The female Healer, annoyingly, ventured to answer, even though he had clearly addressed Healer Lindsay. “Internalized Raw Magic, mr. Potter”, she stated curtly, as if that was obvious and self-explanatory. “He’s indeed stable, and if he is coherent when he wakes up, you should be able to take him home tonight. Healer Lindsay will fill you in on the potions regimen, nonetheless.” She peered critically over to the still-seated healer, tutted, and left. Maybe there were rules against healers sitting next to their patients? Then again, she seemed to disapprove of mostly everything, so perhaps it was just that. Clearly the other healer had read some of it off his face, since he smiled faintly, and stated, “Healer Weston is a very competent healer, but has very little time for things like a good bedside manner”. Harry snorted.
?” he asked, aghast.
“For the Function! Honestly, ” she added exasperated “Do I need to think of everything myself?”. Harry smiled apologetically at her.
with a superiority complex. And somehow, Hermione had hired him as her
“You” Harry says; it comes out as a squeak.
Just as Malfoy is starting on chopping onions, there’s a tap on the window.
He found Edgecome chatting to another collague. Without announcing himself the department, he walked up to Edgecombe, looking pristine in traditional navy robes, his long brown hair lying smooth and shiny over his back.
“Well, could be false alarm. Hannah might look like she’s overdue, but it could still be a while”.
He continued his round, and chatted to Melany Whitehawk, who was in charge of a smaller subdepartment which monitored the establishing “Wizarding Web”. It functioned much like the muggle internet and was their fastest growing sub-department. They were currently discussing cooperation with MACUSA for it. He inquired after her little son, whom Melany and her partner Parvati had recently discovered was a Squib, rattling their little family. He promised to have dinner with them soon, and discuss the benefits of muggle public schools with them. He made a mental note to contact their own educational subdepartment for the latest information on muggle education. And so, his morning went, chatting to his and Hermione’s employees, learning not just the state of their work but also the state of
Flower meanings:
Harry felt a rush of gratitude for Neville and Hannah.
“Malfoy?” came Potter's voice, oddly calm. Draco stared at Potter, still frowning.
“Oh hush! Don’t apologize. How about I just come by tomorrow again, and do just those little things, yes? And I’m sure Luna would also love to help, whatever that would mean.” She snorted a little. Harry looked her over, her face marked by grief, her kind eyes.
, right?
Draco didn’t imagine the twitch in Potters cheek at this. Potters green eyes squinted at Draco again.
“You’re so bloody weird, you know?” he grunts. Malfoy, much to his surprise, looks rather delighted.
. Things that made Hermione trust him, and Ron grin fondly when he said Malfoy was a git. Things that made Malfoy wear fantastical Muggle suits in strange colours to dinner at his mum’s, buy Hermione carrot cake from the bakery, things that made the flowers in the shop
(See the end of the chapter for
The support group was based in Islington, hosted in a small community center by a witch named Norma Harris. He’d felt comfortably insignificant sitting at the formica tables and drinking machine coffee. He’d been just one of the single parents there, and while some parents had obviously recognized him, the groups confidentiality was warded with a very simple loyalty spell. It was that that had made him stay, actually. That, and Healer Lindsay, or rather, Rowan, who’d smiled had him when he’d spotted Harry. He’d been unintrusive, but obviously comfortable in the group. Harry was surprised by his openness, which was emphasized by his being out of uniform and in soft, casual muggle wear. Harry knew he wouldn’t mind to befriend the man. It was also obvious he was a good father, which made Harry both envious and interested.
He picked up his pace, and made his way to the Wizarding district. The sun was warm, reflecting off his fair hair. He attracted some looks from people on the street, but nothing overly hostile today. He nodded at Mrs. Picklewilly, who was standing behind her shop window, grinning like a Cheshire cat when he stepped inside the shop.
“Is something wrong?” He flicks his gaze to her stomach.
“Draco? Don’t we have an appointment with Hermione?” came a clear, high voice from the door. He looked up. Jasmin stood in his doorway, a bit uncertain, fidgeting with the braid hanging over one shoulder. “Miss Lacewell. Yes, thank you. Go ahead, I’ll be right with you.” He quickly shuffled the papers back into plastic folder he got from Lawrence –Muggle, with a fat yellow teddybear on the front eating honey, and sealed it magically.
“We’ll
“Good to see you both dears, Harry, how about breakfast?” Harry smiled back.
“I wish they would stop, you know. You wouldn’t believe how many reporters there are hounding him since it happened”. Well, he could certainly believe it. He’d seen them standing in the atrium, waiting to meet an auror, or Belby, or Robards, for comments ever since the infamous Auror Partner’s Romantic Breakup was published in The Prophet. He just hadn’t known there was also an article like… this. And now Hermione was worried, just before she had to meet the Conservative Faction that pillock Edgecombe was also part of. Bollocks. This was hardly a coincidence. If he wasn't so angry, he would have admired their tactics. He deliberately unclenched his jaw, which took some effort.
He might fail to make a proper dinner for himself every night, but at least he, and by extension Teddy, were well provided with homemade sweet goods. Of course Molly would hand him homemade pies every day of the week if he let her, but he flat out refused to let her see how much it cost him to keep things going. Especially after the Witch’ Weekly article, which still made him feel like crawling up in a corner forever. But he had Teddy, who relied on him, who would yell at him to pay attention when he made a match-stick bridge and wanted to light it up (he’d put paid to that idea just in time), or when he was nagging at Harry that he didn’t want to have cereal for dinner the third time in a row.
“Indeed”. Nodded Draco.
to do with how he felt about Potter. He didn’t feel anything about Potter! Nor with how he was envious of that shiny sheet of hair Edgecombe was sporting. Who even had hair like that? He was sure it was a hair potion. Maybe he should consider switching brands-
“So I hear.” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him again. Silence fell. Draco hoped, silently.
“Good to see you, Lawrence. You got my text, then?”. He says, a little apprehensive. He starts tugging at his ruined robes. He wants to get out of them, as soon as possible. He feels a little too vulnerable, and he didn’t underestimate Lawrence in a temper, despite his being a Squib.
“No one calls me Edward, mister”. Teddy stated, twisting impatiently in his seat.
His little apartment, which he had moved into as soon as he’d started working for Hermione, had been the first time he’d been able to create his own space. Something comfortable, filled with things important to him. He’d spent the Christmas holidays after starting his job painting this ceiling, dressed in his first gaudy Christmas sweater from a muggle charity shop, accompanied by a grumbling Pansy who didn’t see why they had to do it the muggle way, if he could just spell it to a perfect replica of the night-sky. Draco, dark blue paint in his hair, had grinned like a madman and had the best of time being able to feel on a physical level that he was making it
He didn’t meet Molly’s eyes when he dropped Teddy off, giving her a quick murmer of ‘thanks’ before waving at Teddy, and flooing to Neville’s shop.
Draco quickly rips open the seal, and reads the parchment.
“Yes Teddy, you can be like a big brother to him or her!”. Impatiently, he squirmed away.
“Hello, little one. Let me get you a treat, yes?” He turns, and gets the owl treats first before detaching its letter. His own owl, Brighid, is probably still sleeping in her dark corner of his bedroom. He tries not to wonder if Brighid is also owned by his father now. He’ll sneak her away if he has to, he will. He takes the small envelope, lets the owl out after a small nip on his finger, and sits down to read it.
Harry put it firmly out of his mind as Hermione and Ron bustled around the kitchen, Ron with a loaf of bread and a sealed tupperware box of gloopy batter, and Hermione busying herself with some tea. Teddy was of course supervising the making of French toast, even as the smell of banana bread started to take over the kitchen. Saturday brunch was shaping up to be a delicious one, and a much needed reminder of how lucky has was.
“Wow” said Potter.
Malfoy starts chopping carrots now, perhaps a little more forcefully than the care he had taken with the onions.
“You’re not letting me in?”
Columbine (white): folly
“I wasn’t saying anything!” Potter protested.
“Say, Drake." He started now, obviously having some sort of idea lodged in his head, ''What’s up with that Harry Potter guy? So much rumours everywhere, it’s like he’s a scorned maiden or something.” Draco grimaced.
Mrs. Picklewilly, even if she was nosy. This week had been going so well. “I can’t believe that he dared to take up with that other fellow, that gentleman from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, you know, the one with the long brown hair.
“I heard Hermione and Ron asked you to be godfather, too” Malfoy says in the silence.
We see what happened to Teddy, and Harry meets someone that might complicate Draco's plans for him.
“Magic cannot vanish; it is like water. A substance that has to exist in one form or other. It has to contain space, wherever and however it can.” Harry frowned, opened his mouth to ask a question, but the Healer held up a hand to halt him. “What is means it that, when children have growth-spurts, or their magic for some reason is released, they cannot channel or contain it properly. Usually, the magic goes
I feel like the time-flip here is off, but I don't know how to fix it (yet).
Malfoy turned around from his task, and shrugged.
“I believe it customary to offer tea to guests, you know”. He mocks, although there’s no heat in it.
”. His mouth was set.
“But you never grew one before” Ron added with his mouth-full of eggs.
folders still, I know Sally is having trouble with-”
“You seem to think we’re all saints around here, because we were on the winning side. That couldn’t be further from the truth, you know”. Neville raises his eyebrows at him, unsure of where he is going. He knows Harry doesn’t want to talk about all the things he had to do in the war.
“Harry!” came behind him, and to his immense relief he saw Hermione rushing through the hall towards him.
“No thanks Molly, I need to get going. The shop, you know.” He quickly cleaned to soot off the rug with his wand, and watched Teddy and Victoire disappear through the kitchen door, followed by more squeals of delight. “Ron and Hermione not here?”. He had expected them to help Molly prepare for Teddy's belated birthday party later that day.
“It’s fine, they can hear”.
His mind was suddenly abound with all the things he never dared ask his mother. She had never spoken to him about her time at Hogwarts, apart from relating details about her early courtship with his father, which started when she was in sixth year. But never about the things he wondered about; had she been nervous about exams, had she stayed up at night gossiping with the girls in her dorm? Who was her favourite teacher? Did she ever fret about bad grades as Draco had? But now was clearly not the time to ask this near-stranger about all of that. It would betray much about his relationship to his mother, and he didn’t want to cause his mother discomfort trying to find out about things she didn’t want to share. So, sat here in front of him was a woman who was a veritable well of information, and he couldn’t touch it until he knew her angle. The Malfoy pride was a fragile thing, especially so after the war. This Mrs. Picklewilly seemed to read all that in his face, and smiled at him, blue eyes twinkling.
“It’s not a secret, Hermione. Everyone knows he’s been dumped” he said, carefully neutral.
“he has nightmares! How could they make fun of that!” she exclaims angrily. He ignores it as he reads on, but even he feels wronged –nightmares come with the territory of having been in the war, Draco knows all too well.

“You’re back again, then?”
“Maybe you should find someone to do it
Harry never had had such a spread, and it felt like an utter luxury. The Auror breakroom never got any other tea than breakfast and earl grey, and biscuits were usually gone by Tuesday. Hannah –Neville’s wife, made biscuits every week, two kinds always; Lavender-vanilla, honey-thyme, gingerbread, all sorts. Sometimes decorated with sugary roses, or other flowers. Yes, Neville’s shop was definitely better than the DMLE. Even if he didn’t know what he was doing. Or what he was going to do to “get back on his feet”.  He had Teddy to take care of, and to be honest, money enough to spend in ten lifetimes. But he needed to feel useful. When Neville had offered that he could mind the shop so Hannah could take it easier, now being seven months pregnant, he had accepted immediately. He tried very hard to ignore the pitying look the two of them had exchanged at his enthusiasm. He was
, if he didn’t know Neville was honorouble and honest to his Gryffindor bones, than he would’ve been suspicious he’d been set upon by Mrs. Picklewilly. He had deftly avoided her trying to catch his eye when he left Spectral Sprouts, flipping up his collar against the chilly wind and oncoming rain.
“You know me too well, Draco. It’s weird.” He grinned, winked at her. When a comfortable silence fell, he waited a moment, and then delicately breached the subject.
“To marry a Rosewood, a Greengrass, or even an Oakwald?”. He can hear the smile in her voice.
“What was that?” Malfoy leaned forwards, and Harry was hit with a whiff of his expensive cologne, surprisingly warm and woodsy. It was quite a rush, being the center of Malfoy’s full attention. He felt his magic unfurl inside him, just a little, to reach out.
Ron might have finally succumbed to learning household spells, but he still wasn’t the most attentive to what to him was 'useless fussing'. Their floors were covered in fluffy carpets, the couch muggle Ikea, and it had a distinctly “Gryffindor common room” feel to it. Vastly different to how Harry and Teddy occupied Grimmauld Place.
The young man turns to Neville, recognition in his eyes. His posture was less angry, but still clearly upset.
I didn't know I'd ever write "enthusiastic seasoning". But there was no other way to express what I could see Teddy doing.
. -But for the fact, that small little
“Have courage” he answered simply, shrugging lightly.
“Yes, he did. Even though I had to pretend to force him into it because being read to is apparently shameful for a nine year old. His words were “If you really reall want to read to me, I’ll allow it, grannie” Oh, he’s so precious”. Her smile made her wrinkles stand out, the grey strands in her brown curls shining in the candle light.
After a few minutes, Malfoy nodded to himself and then swiftly gathered a bunch of violet geraniums, meadowsweet, and deep purple carnations. Harry straightened up and tried to look busy again with the still incomplete display of sleep-sachets.
He is Draco
Neville’s mouth turns stern. “I didn’t have parents to protect.  A mother who doted on me, or a father whose approval I’ve always desperately wanted. It’s easy to make the right choice when you have very little to lose”. Lawrence seems a bit cowed, if still mutinous. Harry clears his throat.
“Good night, sweetheart. See you tomorrow”. In a flare of green flames, she had gone.
woman, do you ever rest? I can check in on it, you just go.” Hermione shoots him a grateful smile, as she swings her robe over her chair, and pops loose the bottom button on her jacket.
“I didn’t know”.
Andromeda came home with a hungry Teddy, carrying groceries and looking a little worn, even if she was smiling brightly. Harry had

“Right,” Harry says. “Marcus, if you want your things, I’ll get them. But you need to wait outside.”
The press starts closing in on Harry, and we see a bit more of Draco (though maybe not enough?)
At some point Potter had flicked his wand at the wireless, and they settled down to dinner. The silence was only broken up by the wireless and Teddy’s chattering, but it wasn’t all that awkward. Draco noticed with satisfaction that both Potter and Teddy ate their plates clean.
Stunned silence settled over them.
“Oh” Harry uttered, a bit dejected. He suspected Teddy used his abilities to look like Harry because of his need for a ‘real’ family. He loved being mistaken for Harry’s son. Or, occasionally, to get attention –why else would he want neon green hair?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Remus and Tonks” Harry whispered. Teddy nodded, shifted in his seat. His hands were clenched in his lap, shoulders tight.
I promised this was more action packed and then I started writing and now that action is in the next chapter. But! Hermione/Draco friendship! Draco being cool with a Squib! In another suit! Yes?
“I’m sorry you had to find out like this, Lawrence” he starts, quietly. Lawrence scoffs.
Malfoy’s previous annoyance seemed to return. “Well then, if you must. I need flowers to convey my utter disappointment in someone”, he prompted again, his upper lip curling slightly upwards.
, after all.” He sighs, and swallows another bit of waffle. At least she’ll let him go to work, not that he was looking at all forward to it. But, as he reminded himself, he had grown a spine since the war, and he wasn’t going to let his father ruin it for him again. He glances at the little purple ultrasound picture, already tucked in the corner of the frames of Teddy’s drawings. He can be strong.

“Yes. We halted the progress of corrosive magic via potions. I immunized the magical core against it, and stopped renewed outpour of magic. It will halt his magical growth for a little bit, but that side effect will be gone in a few weeks. He'll also have bouts of fever over the next few days, unfortunately. It's his system getting rid of residual magic.”
He’d have to vacate his apartment by the end of the week.
“Was she not to your liking, then?”. Oh god. He couldn’t say it. Not
They’d met in a muggle bar –the kind his mother wasn’t allowed to know about, and Draco had laughed at his attempts to flirt. He’d then proceeded to show Lawrence just how to go about it, Draco sponsoring his venture with lots of vodka, and they’d been friends ever since. And working together, should the need arise.
, babe!” he had always stated, and insisted on either going out to a posh restaurant –always in the wizarding district, or to bringing him round to one of his friends’
Harry hummed, tapping his fingers on the counter.
All thoughts of asking Healer Lindsay to the Ministry Function lay forgotten, as he continues to wonder what he actually knows about who Draco Malfoy is, these days.
“Also dear, while I have agreed to hold off the good families for now, I was wondering who you were planning to bring to the Function in a couple of weeks?”. Draco had trailed off on relating the details of Shelly’s report, and now pursed his lips.
“What an incredibly asinine observation, Potter. I can see why the Aurors miss you.”
. But also
“To cook, again?” he prodded, squirming a little.
“And, mr. Potter, ” Healer Lindsay started,
At least Lawrence hadn’t cottoned on to the fact that Belby was Potter’s ex, even if he now knew the name, although that couldn’t last long. Then he would be back, with his shit-eating grin, putting his boots on Draco’s couch and asking all about the wizarding hero that everyone knew about and that he found ‘roguishly handsome, if you’re into that sort of thing’. And then he would wink at Draco, meaningfully. Draco groaned. He should have

roll his eyes.
Draco hears Potter take a seat behind them, but decides to ignore him. If he's not being chased from the house, he's staying. Teddy is next to him on a little stool, excitedly looking over all the magical cooking. Usually Draco doesn’t use that much magic in the kitchen; the stirring and chopping reminds him of potions, and calms him down after a day of work. But little Teddy seems completely suprised. Didn’t Potter cook proper meals,
is me telling you off, Teddy”. Teddy laughs, perks up even more, and jumps off of the stool to hug Harry, who slings an arm around Teddy’s shoulder.
“Oh, I’m so excited! Do you mind if I tell Ron after work? And we should tell Harry, too, since he’s going to be godfather as well, and-”
“I suppose so” Harry rubbed his face, looked down at Teddy.
“Sit down before you fall down, ducky” she snaps, but not unkindly. It’s Pansy: she can sound mean and fond at the same time. It's an enviable talent, that.
Now he felt bad for
“But, how can you say that?! He’s as good as a war criminal!” Lawrence exclaims, fists clenching. Neville pets one of his hands.
Harry looked over the latest order. Luscious red rhododendrons, branches of vermilion snapdragons, and, oddly enough, some detoxified Nightshade*. Neville allowed them in bouquets after hitting them with an advance depoisoning charm –one of his own inventions. Neville was currently working on their string-of-pearl plants in the back, which instead of
.” Harry snorted so hard, his throat ached. Hermione pulled a face “That’s rude, Harry”.  Sanaz laughed again.
“What he did was reprehensible. He was a horrible child, and he bullied both of us mercilessly” Neville states. Lawrence sighs and turns to Neville, as Harry takes a few deep breaths. His chest felt rather tight. “He made a lot of bad choices in the war, I know. But I think there weren’t many good ones for him at all, you know.”
“Why would you want to talk about Draco?”.
“At least another six months, Teddy”.
“Malfoy, there’s a bottle upstairs in the bathroom, second door to the right. Bright blue. Get it, now!” With a curt nod, Draco rushed up the stairs, found the bottle, and quickly turned back. He had to jump over dirty towels lying on the floor, unwashed bedding in a corner, and he spotted a few dustbunnies scuttling away.
“Is this again your flower language nonsense, Malfoy? Bribing Ministry members?” he was frowning, but looked bemused all the same. And Draco took it for what it was; a perfect opportunity to introduce Potter to some pressing matters. But he had to goad Potter; he certainly wouldn’t want to give the impression that he was
. Harry took a deep breath through his nose, and tried for a smile. It was rather a grimace.
“He’s friends with your boss though. Are the rumours true?”
“None of your business, is it?”. But Harry had scented blood, his own curiosity piqued.
“I wanted to give you this,” and gave him a lightblue pamphlet, a little card clipped to it. “its, well, a support group for single parents. I, well, that is to say,” he cleared his throat a little nervously. “I had a lot of help, and still go sometimes. Not that you’d have to meet
“No!” came the reply, and Malfoy turned away again. “It’s the onions” he said defensively. “for the curry, you know”. Harry snorted in disbelief.
“I will not interfere with what you do. But my child is frightened. Let me hold his hand, goddammit!” he spat at her. She stared at him, apprehension in her eyes. After one, two seconds, she gave a curt nod. Not thanking her, he stood on the empty side of the cot Teddy was lying on, and took Teddy’s small hand between his. “Hey, Ted. You’ll be alright, yeah?” he started talking, Teddy’s eyes –two different colours now, sliding to his, and clinging to him. He briefly looked up to see Hermione being pushed out in the hallway again, but she smiled at him, satisfied, her eyes a little wet.
he’d look wrong even if he ever dared try one on. Turning to make himself a cup of coffee, he heard some loud bangs coming from Teddy’s room upstairs. His smile turned into a grimace, but he wasn’t about to run upstairs to check on whatever ridiculous situation Teddy had set out to make those noises.
“It’s rude to greet guests in your pyjamas, Ted”. Draco thought it rather ironic, given the fact that Potter was literally wearing a shoulder bearing jumper and see through joggers. Moreover, Teddy’s pajama’s were rather nice and comfortable looking.
Irritated already, he came out from behind the counter, and head to the flowers, again. “Alright, keep your hair on.”
“Do I want to know what that is about?” Draco asks, unable to contain his curiosity.
“If you'd allow me, I could take care of that frankly enormous pile of laundry in Teddy’s room. Bring in some groceries. Even some quick cleaning spells, if you’d let me.” She’d raised an eyebrow at him, but not in critique. He sighed.
The sight, after so many weeks, was like a punch to the gut. He wouldn’t floocall, he wouldn’t even do him the curtesy of owling, but there he was, standing on his doorstep.
Harry smoothes down the quilted blanket over his godson’s bed. Teddy’s fever -which had come as predicted-, had gone down to no-longer dangerous levels, and he had finally fallen into a quiet sleep. It was long after midnight. The only light in the usually so brightly coloured room was a small moon shaped lamp next to the doorknob on the wall, so Teddy could find the door and come get Harry if he needed to. It bathed the room in a silver, colourless sheen. Ron and Hermione had left just before ten o’clock, when Harry had finally convinced them they couldn’t do anything to help, and Ron was getting worried about Hermione having enough sleep in her state. Hermione had glared at Ron for being ‘irrationally worried’, but they had flood home together regardless. Leaving Harry to sit beside Teddy’s bed, stroking his now dull, brown hair and hoping he would sleep through the night. Harry’s knees popped when he raised himself off the chair next to Teddy’s bed. He put up an alarm-charm around him, which would make his wand buzz if Teddy’s temperature rose or when he woke up. He shuffled out of the room, straight into what used to be Sirius’s room, and he crawled into the canopied bed, feeling like a child himself. Unprepared for all that lay on his shoulders, worried to his stomach, and feeling incapable of dealing with it.
Harry felt, not for the first time, guilty. Guilty for the role he was playing in Teddy’s life, that should’ve been Remus’. Guilty for not being better than he had been, stopping Voldemort from taking the lives he had. From robbing Teddy of the parent’s he should have had. And, deeply insecure, feeling hopelessly inadequate; who was he kidding. He wasn’t a
Did you like it?
“Get up”. His own voice is hallow, bouncing flatly against the wallpaper.
“Heya, Harry” said Marcus, standing on his doorsteps, hands in his pockets and looking bashful. His dark brown curly hair was cut neatly, and he was in old fashioned wizarding robes, belted at the waist to show off his trim figure.
“Good morning, Secretary Malfoy” she answered brightly. She was always early, sometimes even earlier than him. He could spot the ink stains on her fingers. Still a quill-user, then -pens had become more
Again Potter bent over –Draco was resolutely not looking at his arse, lest he be caught-, and emerged with a slightly ruffled but perfectly serviceable goose feather-quill and inkpot. He thought briefly, then settled on simplicity;

“Yes, Potter?” he asks innocently. He sticks his hands again in the soapy water, the clean lemon smell rising in the air.

old fashioned.”
“Neville? But what- Hermione?”. Teddy had already attacked his cinnamon roll with gusto and was making loud noises of approval.
The light inside the shop was dimmed, probably to prevent the press from taking any good pictures of him. Behind the till, looking pained but determined, wearing baby blue earmuffs, was Neville.
Hermione laughs again, wryly. “I’ve gone off it, didn’t you know? It’s pickles with mayonnaise now, I have jars in the icebox over there” she rolls her eyes. Draco pulls a disgusted face.
to get to Teddy.
The owl was now scratching the glass of the kitchen window. Harry glared at it, then recognized Neville’s small white-faced owl Mildred, and sighed, heading to the window. Teddy quickly took his chance to push away the bowl of oatmeal and grab the toast that was on Harry’s plate. “I WIN!” He yelled triumphantly, spraying crumbs everywhere. Harry grinned at him and let the owl in, untying Neville’s letter and glancing at the Prophet, against his better judgement.
“Why would you need a babysitter?” Sanaz asked curiously. Harry hesitated, then sighed.
like that.
Looking at Hermione’s anguished expression after the meeting, there certainly was a need to give him a call soon. “Why don’t you go home early today, Hermione. I can clean up and close the department for tonight, if you want”. They walk back to her office, the sky on the magical windows already turning dusky and pink. She bit her lip, looking at the stack of reports on her desk.
“Tell me this, then, Potter: why would

sodding
Tears sprung in her eyes, and he himself felt his throat clench. She came from behind the desk to hug him tighly, and the breath wooshed out of him. He couldn’t help but feel excited. He knew the instant she asked him, weeks ago, that he would say yes. It was an inevitability, he would never refuse Hermione. On the other hand, he had many misgivings about how suitable he was to the task; former Death Eater. Single. Queer. By all accounts, having had a bad parental example in his own father, and a very debatable godfather in Severus. But, yet again, he tamped down on those insecurities and decided to trust Ron and Hermione; it was their decision, after all. And, he was unbearably flattered. He looked again at Hermione in his arms, practically vibrating in merriment.
been allowed. The house had to remain pristine, the walls of his bedroom a sedate cream with gold gilding, a terrifying state of cleanliness that had made him learn to mind every single step, every single fingerprint. The most wondrous thing, and the only concession his mother had made, was the painted, glowing, constellation ceiling. The very same as what he was staring at now, actually.
fact that he had taken Marcus away from him.
“Well, he hasn’t accepted yet, but then, we haven’t wanted to push the issue, ever since Marcus-” she again halted abruptly. The mood shifted, again back to the seriousness it had before.
Harry can practically feel the gleeful look on Malfoy’s face at the words “single dad club”. He groans.
“Harry? I’m going to be late!” he exclaimed impatiently, when Harry was still sitting down at the kitchen table ten minutes later. Tedd was waiting by the floo, practically vibrating with energy.
“Yes, Potter”. It had all the derisiveness with which old Snape could say ‘o b v i o u s l y’.
“What?” he splutters, as best he can, while his lips are crusted with cinnamon sugar. He grabs a napkin, hoping to retain some of his dignity. Always difficult when Pansy’s around, he must say.
“I have home addresses of them”, he offered. He knew most of the conservative members from old, had had to study their family trees since he was little. The Malfoy’s had even intermarried with many of them throughout the centuries, although no one wanted to admit that now, of course.
Draco thought it over. Setting aside his personal feelings for Potter, he was inclined to agree. Hermione had urged Potter at first to participate. But postwar Potter had been tired, grieving. Not in the least inclined to do something with the family titles he was bestowed. Then, a few years after, the Lupin boy had been thrust into his care, and combined with his career as an Auror, Potter had left politics to politicians. Even Hermione couldn’t sway him, though some of their campaigns were funded by the Potter vault, Draco knew. Potter’s most overt political alliance had been with that horrid Belby, who had tried to force Potter into uncomfortable interviews, aiming to get him to agree with his own opions –all the while claiming neutrality as law-enforcers. What a two-faced prick. Belby’s tactics obviously hadn’t made Potter more agreeable to his cause; He had left to find another, more agreeable and influential political player in Edgecombe.
of all people. And so close, all of a sudden. Which, try as he might to deny it, still made his insides squirm, and his palms sweaty.
“Come on, lets help your gran so we can start cooking, right?”.  Teddy complained, but obediently set to shelving the things he could reach first. All in all, it become another lovely evening. The potpies were a success, with Teddy eating seconds, and Andromeda had even brought chocolate pudding for dessert, a treat for Harry and Teddy both.
. To be expected, of course, as it was a cross between an owlery, magical mail center, and publishing house. Other magical mail was already cluttering about his person, hovering around him, waiting for him to open them. It was really getting out of hand, and the preliminary proceedings were still days away!
“Maybe that’s enough salt, there, Ted” Potter tells him, tiredly. Teddy stops, turns around.
“Oh, since seven this morning". Neville answered loudly, clearly not hearing himself over the muffs. "I haven’t switched the sign to open yet, actually. Need to figure out how to stop them from coming in first.” He hummed a bit, considering. “Any suggestions are welcome, really”. Harry groaned and rubbed his eyes under his glasses.
“Thank you, for everything.” He said, with feeling. “It’s my job, you know” the Healer replied, smiling.
“I’ll have them sing “The Astronomer’s Dream”, if you can?”. Harry hummed his assent, and at the till set to instructing the little flowers to sing the right song.
“Don’t be so frightened dear. I want to propose an idea to you, is all.” Draco crossed his legs elegantly, leather shoes shining in the dim shop light.
At breakfast he had grown himself a long white beard, although matching eyebrows had proved too distracting while eating his cereal. Afterwards, they had giggled trying to comb out Colour-Changing Crispy Crups from his beard, Teddy deciding to keep it until just before tea, when he got tired.
He briefly fears it’s more hatemail, but then remembers that his wards are too strong; Ron had made sure of that. It seemed he and Potter had devised pretty extensive warding charms against pranks and hateful messages, for god knows what reason. He dredges up a smile for the little owl, and lets it in.
, no. Draco, get your act together!
“You guys are hilarious”. Ron grinned at her mirthfully.
“Why wouldn’t he be able to do that with me?” Harry answered, still feeling wronged.
Edgecombe tried to draw himself up even taller, and looked down his patrician nose at him. Well, that wouldn’t work on Harry. He’d known many a pureblood prick, thinking of a tall one, very blond, and very unimpressive in spite of all that.
“Yes. As I mentioned, I am already late to dinner, and she has reason to be cross with me”. He feels Harry’s gaze linger a bit, taking in his appearance overtly. He tries not to preen; he loves this suit, the colour making his skin glow and his hair shine.
“-Harry. Eh, Sure?”
“I think I might even involve Ron” she smirks a little. It’s a good look on her, Draco thinks. Very clever and devious. An idea pops into his head.
Malfoy looked at him, stiff and straight-faced. His only tell were his flared nostrils. He seemed to be breathing deeply, appraising Harry anew. Harry felt a bit ashamed at his declaration, but it wasn’t like he thought Malfoy would run to the press. Not with

That afternoon, Molly had gone to lie down for a bit after lunch, as she was want to do. The kids were good about it, being old enough to understand that this ‘freedom’ was built on trust, and didn’t misbehave too much. They were allowed to roam the garden and grounds up to the neighbours’ fence, eat a snack if they wanted to, and use all the art supplies at hand. There had been some terrible messes and spills, but nothing broken, no one hurt. Until today, that was.
It used to be a never-ending joke of theirs, the state of Grimmauld Place. Harry would promise to redecorate, but then they’d get a new case, and there just never was enough time. And after each case, they’d come back to Grimmauld, and it was still the state it was in, not the grand family home it could be, but the dusty thing with the shut-rooms.
“Do you want that?”
“Teddy’s in there?” She asks in a low voice. Harry nods, his magic pulling from his core, compressing into a tight, strong ball.
“And you’re distressed about?”, he prodded lightly. She hadn’t shown this much anxiety since telling Draco the news, from which point he had already started planning for the eventuality; the inevitable questions, announcements, and –at some point far, far in the future, at least to Draco’s hopeful mind, her maternity leave.
“Very well, why would I take Potter to the function?”.
“It’s fine, leave it” he grinds out. Malfoy stares at him, face again blank. Harry looks into his eyes, but can’t read what’s swirling in their depths. Somewhere, Harry remembers another fight they had, in a bathroom. He wonders briefly if Malfoy remembers it, too. The blood on the tiles, mixing itself with water like beautiful blooms. The moment stretches, their breathing evening out, their magic turning into something different, now.
Potter snorted. “Bloody hell Malfoy. It’s just a bunch of flowers. Surely it can’t be all that important?”
“Well, next time I’ll get something more nutritious, then”. He said, before he could stop himself. He found he
“But Reg, what’s the note about?” He heard the collaugue asking curiously.
“You don’t say”. That got a little grin out of the man. “Is Teddy going to be alright?” he blurted out, feeling safer asking this man instead of the brusque witch. The tired healer brushed his dark blonde hair off his forehead. “I feel confident he will. Do you know what Internalized Raw Magic means?” the man asked, finally standing and peering over Teddy again. Harry shook his head.
“Is it true?” he asks. He feels like he should’ve known. He wasn’t an Auror anymore, but wouldn’t he be contacted should the case be brought to trial again, as he had been a key witness the first time? He didn’t think he’d fallen out of grace with the Ministry
Draco sipped his tea slowly, casually looking over Hermione’s schedule for the next two weeks. He was certain he had to drag her to at least two more tailors to find her some new dress robes for the upcoming Ministry Function. While he couldn’t deny he liked her smart muggle-style suits, for the Function she needed to turn the heads of some of the more old-fashioned members of the Wizengamot, and prove she could indeed move amongst the sniffy purebloods. Prove that she knew what things mattered to them as well, and was accommodating.
“So?” he answers, dismissive.
I have plans for at least another three chapters, and I have a feeling it's going to be at least 7 chapters long, just because I keep rambling on and adding things.
“It’s just!” she started, and Draco discreetly muffliato’d their corner of the shop. Better safe than sorry, even if
Harry surveys him again, and suddenly he knows where he’s seen him before; coming down Diagon with Malfoy, just a few weeks ago! Had even bought something from Harry, for his aunt or something. Harry hears Neville’s footsteps approach, and then he speaks into the tense air.
“Well, the git’s a pompous arse, we know that.” Ron interjected, looking almost fond. Sanaz looked bewildered, and Hermione took pity on her.
The floo chimes again, and Potter waves his wand to unblock it. Immediately, the loud voice of Molly Weasley fills the space, panicked and shrill.
“He doesn’t even
“What?!” he splutters out. Mrs. Picklewilly gives him a rueful smile and hands him a frilly lace handkerchief, which he gratefully accepts to mop up the tea.
While  much more persuasive –she had a point, the old hag, in that the function was in less than a month and he had no proper relationship with Potter yet, it still wouldn’t have convinced him to actually be so crass as to barge into Potters house. No, what actually convinced him, was Neville.

“I’m very proud, yes.” he answered, grinning widely at Teddy, who grinned back, his hair now Hermione's bushy brown curls. God, he loved that kid.
It's two days after the Mungo's incident.
The pureblood Wizengamot members all had insufferable smiles on their faces when they entered the room. He felt Hermione square her shoulders, and keep her tone professional. Pleasing, even, if you didn’t really know her. Their eyes note Draco’s muggle suit beneath his open robes, their disapproval clear. He sees them trying to glean whether or not Hermione is upset about her best friend being targeted again, multiple
“I don’t think that would work, Harry. They've already seen you, now. How about we get some tea first?”.
“I cursed a student with a curse so dark, he should have died from it. That was Malfoy”. Lawrence nods, and mutters “I’ve seen the scars”. Harry raises an eyebrow. He hadn’t known there were still scars. His chest feels sore.
“What, then?”. Malfoy took the bouquet, and Harry rung up the number. Malfoy paid, looking Harry straight in the eye. His blush was gone, and he looked rather pleased with himself.
“I’ll send you your things, then” he states again. Marcus sighs, looks pleadingly at him. “I didn’t come here for my stuff, Harry. I don’t even remember what I left here.”
Later that night, after Harry’s tucked Teddy into bed –he hasn’t mentioned the drawings at all- he sits down at the kitchen table, on which are the remains of the last pre-cooked ‘Malfoy-meal’ they had. Excellent, as always. He wondered if it meant that Malfoy would come by to cook tomorrow. He wasn’t sure how to feel about it now, having met Lawrence. Having discussed how he might have been just like Malfoy, had he been raised differently. It made him a little uneasy, and he rubbed his chest again.
“I’ll make some tea. Teddy, sit down.” Teddy grinned widely, and gingerly sat down across from Draco, looking at him with wide curious eyes.
“Wait.
could be that forgettable. It was making him more upset to think about, and he swallowed a couple of times.
He suppressed a shudder thinking he might be related to that arse Edgecombe, or that truly awful Prescott. Maybe he should check up on that, seeing if watery eyes and bald patches were in his future.
“Granger, calm down. We are only here to see about a robe. If you don’t like it, we’ll go somewhere else. We have an appointment this Wednesday at Twillfitt and Tattings.” He used his most soothing voice, the one he reserved for calming horses on the estate, when they were restless.
“My apologies. Have we met before?” Draco ventured cautiously.
“I’m sorry” he said, pleading eyes up at Harry. Harry frowned.
“Good day. I would like a bouquet of
The next one might be late, so this one is longer than usual. Hope you enjoyed!
“But I haven’t even gotten to the laundry yet!” she yawned. Harry smiled, hand still on her shoulder.

wards, even though there is no room in the body to contain it. When the magical core is overloaded or stressed, for example.”
And so, muggle clubnights were out, soirees were in, Teddy was dropped off at Andromeda’s for a sleepover, and Saturday brunches became a regular. Harry always cooked them breakfast, of course, since Marcus couldn’t and Harry didn’t feel right making Ron or, god forbid-, Hermione cooking. She was absolutely brilliant, but still a terrible cook –driving Molly to teach Ron the family recipes “before marriage!” instead of Hermione.
“Good point, Potter”. He admits. He waves his wand, and the kettle stills.

A voice comes from upstairs. “Ted? Who’s there? I’ll be right down, after I get this muck-” his speech was interrupted by some squelching noises and incomprensible curses. Draco turns curiously to Teddy, who is grinning wickedly. “We’ll be in the kitchen, dad!” he yells up. Dad? When did
“Then why-”
A perfectly hot steaming cup of tea was put in front of him, Malfoys long bony fingers lingering a little on the saucer, before he too, sat down at the table. Silence fell, but it wasn’t all that uncomfortable, really. The tea helped. It wasn’t as black as Harry usually took it, but it had a hint of fresh lemon in it, and he could appreciate its zest. Malfoy meanwhile, had closed his eyes, and hummed contentedly.  Malfoy wasn’t forthcoming with conversation, letting the silence stretch.
“You tell me, Malfoy”.
”. Draco scoffed: as if Lawrence hadn't planned this from the start.
“Yes, the whole Wizarding community is all agog with jilted Potter.”
Malfoy laughed again, startling Harry into grinning along.
“Good afternoon, Neville. Rare to see you here, these days”. Neville blushed rather adorably.
“Yes, Potter.” He answered again, and he looked like he was trying hard not to roll his eyes. He sipped his tea, and put down the cup. A little moisture was caught on his bottom lip, and Harry’s eyes were drawn to it involuntarily.
stupidity”. Harry spluttered, torn between indignation and amusement. He was rather glad she had pulled him off the street for this conversation. Mrs. Picklewilly rummaged a bit in the straw basket next to her armchair, and pulled out the day’s Prophet, spreading it out awkwardly over the plate of biscuits, since there was no room left on the tiny, spindly legged table. “
“To get you a husband dear, of course!” she exclaimed, looking imperiously at him from over the rim of her spectacles. Harry opened his mouth to protest, but she cut him off, “or at the very least show that mr. Belby that he’s made the wrong decision!” she sniffed, and added darkly “Taking up with that tart from creatures,
He looked at Malfoy, who was sniffing again.
Malfoy’s shoes clicked behind him on the tiled floor of the shop.
“Perhaps you should bring pastries. No one can refuse pastries” she adds. He laughs. She needn’t know she already had given him such advice, on more than one occasion. And it had gotten him through the door. Pastries were in personal manners what flowers were in professional ones. Only without the subversive texts.
“Just a suggestion, sweetheart”. Draco hums noncommittally, and finishes his tea.

His cheeks were flushed, and he was fussing with his hair, which was obviously windswept. And Merlin, he was wearing a
“Good afternoon. Would you like a coffee?” he asked them, putting the tray down on the table in the corner. Hermione politely declined, but Ron groaned out a
the one that makes those weird drawings of cars with dragontails, and the microwave with whiskers?” he exclaims, looking a bit bewildered.
Really, this is only the first part of this chapter yet again. Since we need to know Draco's side of the story too, right? Coming right up; Draco being a good person and meddling with the best (and worst) intentions.
“Call me Harry, please” the healer looked a bit surprised, but continued
It was getting disorienting, the amount of mail that was fluttering about. He could go to the Aurors, of course. If he weren't Draco
He’s in the shower trying to wake himself when he hears a loud knock on the door. It shocks him out of some of his more depressing considerations, especially when he hears a shrill voice coming through the door. “Draco, I swear if you don’t let me in this instance I will blast through your stupid Muggle door!”. He frowns. It can’t be....? But there’s only one person who’d barge in so rudely. He jumps out of the shower like there’s fire at his heels and quickly wraps himself in a towel.
Having finished inventory and his cup of tea, he set to arrange them in an attractive manner on the counter. Should they be stacked? Or rather set in a neat line? No, a pyramid shape might be better, but… “Shit!”. He managed to knock about half of them off, and a few fell open on the floor, spreading their contents everywhere. The air filled with the air of lavender, rosemary, jasmine and some other herbs he couldn’t identify. Harry sighed and bent over, hoping to gather the herbs and refill the bags. While Neville wasn’t overpaying Harry by any means, and his minding the shop was really just a way to keep busy, he didn’t exactly want to ruin their business by breaking wares or ruining them.
“Well, I didn’t know you were in the shower ducky, you might’ve warned me” she sniffs, and heads straight to the kitchen. “Get dressed, ducky, I’ll see you in the kitchen” She glances over at him, and she no doubt sees more than he likes, as he stands there in his towel, dripping and tired. “Why not go for the jade robes. It might even give you some colour.” She nods decidedly, and clacks away. He sighs, and heads to his bedroom. She might be right. If he wore anything too bright he’d be a washed out corpse, and black would head straight into decaying-inferi territory. A little coo warns him before Brighid finally leaves her perch and burrows into his neck, her warm body close to his damp one. He strokes her and ignores the claws digging into his naked shoulder. The robes he takes out of the closet are of a more traditional, double breasted style, with classic pearl buttons. Suited for spring, and definitely comfortable. Something he’s worn often, inconspicuous but dignified, and not at all like he’s given up. He carefully moves Brighid to his bed, where she settles on his pillow and keeps an eye on him lazily. She coos, and he can almost muster a smile for his silly owl. Finally dressed, he looks at his watch: 8:23. He wonders how Pansy managed to wrangle an international portkey so soon after the news.
to Hermione. In the beginning, Ron and Harry had grumbled about their closeness. Then, Malfoy had started coming ‘round to dinner at their apartment, and Ron had started grumbling less. When Harry had pressed him again on Hermione and Malfoy’s closeness, he had shrugged and said “You don’t have to get it, Harry. It’s Hermione’s call.”
“A little cloud of milk, please.” Potter made him his tea, adding even more milk to Teddy’s, and put it in front of them. Then he took his own pitch-black concoction, and finally sat down. He looked worn and in a bad mood.
Zinnia (scarlet): constancy
“Draco has them framed in his kitchen” Lawrence answers. Apparently not in the drawers, then. When had Teddy managed to give Draco these drawings, exactly?

in class. Hmm.” He put the sachet down, and took in the rest of the store. “Is there anyone else that can help me find a suitable arrangement?”.
, and he wards the door. He’ll owl Neville the unlocking spell, later. Or leave Potter to it. He used to be an Auror, after all. Surely he could deal with a standard warding spell.
. He’d have to heal those later. Finally, he’d managed to set up similar wards on his office as to his apartment. Unfortunately, it would keep out interdepartmental mail as well, redirecting it to Madam Beauregard first. He was sure she wouldn’t mind. After all, she was a formidable Witch in her own right, and clearly supported him. She no doubt knew how to deal with petty mail curses, being an attorney.
“He’s going to be fine. Just hoping he’ll wake up soon, then I can take him back home”.

's peeking out from some of their bags.
Malfoy looks at him derisively. “I’d rather neither of us presume anything, Potter”. But they fall silent as they guide Teddy upstairs, and Harry hates that Malfoy knows where Teddy’s bedroom is, that he has such an intimate knowledge of their home already. They navigate him on his bed, underneath his blankets, after Harry has removed his sneakers. It had been a half-hearted fight to get Teddy not to wear his purple buckled wizarding boots. Harry’d won the argument not by stating that they were too obviously wizarding, but by pointing out that if he planned to play in the park, the stains might never come out. Harry thought it an example of prime parenting, that. Teddy had thus put on the white sneakers, which had a foiled swishy sign on them. They were scuffed, and he’d already repeatedly replaced the laces, which were now red on the left shoe, and blue on the other, respectively. Teddy had used markers to colour on the soles, just like he’d scribble on everything else if he got the chance to. He looked up from a weak attempt at tidying to see Draco fuss with the blanket draped over Teddy, an unreadable expression on his face. His eyes seemed to be softer, fractionally. He looked up at Harry, and the effect was gone in an instant, eyebrow raised again .
Draco looked down at the file of information in front of him, willing himself nog to break something in his anger. It wouldn’t do, to make a fuss in the office, least of all over this. Lawrence had come by his apparment this morning, black circles on his eyes and a shit-eating grin on his face. He’d dropped down on his couch, put his booted feet on his coffee table, and scarfed down the breakfast Draco gave him. He’d tried to look disgruntled, but he was pleased Lawrence had managed to dig up something so quickly. He definitely hadn’t talked to his aunt yet, or she would’ve forced some food down him. Maybe mended the hole in the elbow of his shirt.
Sanaz gave Harry his creampuff, and he bit in it rather aggressively. Now even Sanaz was laughing at him. He couldn’t catch a break! Of course he knew Hermione worked with Malfoy, had done so for years at this point. And sure, he didn’t believe Malfoy was truly
“Well, hello Belby.” He sneers, as best he can with a wand forced under his chin.
Potter looked up again, raised his eyebrows.
space. And so the ceiling had been painted by hand, painstakingly, to resemble the traditional Black night sky ceilings, and charmed to sparkle at night. The walls he’d wallpapered with forest-printed wallpaper, and he loved how free he felt in his little magical wonderland. While meticulously tidy, it was nothing like the rooms in the manor, whimsical instead of stark, colourful and cosy.
“Malfoy’s family was one of Voldemort’s followers”. Lawrence nods; he clearly knows all of this. “His parents, Lucius and Narcissa, had only one child. They, like many other parents, raised that child in their image: they taught him how to ride a broom, to say please and thank you, and equally, that his blood was worth more than that of those around him”. Harry has said this too in his testimonial at the trials. Lawrence bobs his leg up and down impatiently.
“Cinnamon rolls and a sort of strawberry and cream mountain.” He said, raising his voice a little. Potter’s eyes widened a little, and he could see that his jumper was being pulled at from behind.
“No!” yells Harry.
She smiled again “You never call me that”.
Another lull.
“Yes, isn’t it amazing?! They zoom around too, if you touch the buttons, look!” Teddy demonstrated for Draco, and he felt himself smile despite himself.
“Give me a second, Harry”. She answers, already understanding. It was to her credit as a friend that she didn’t try to persuade him differently. A testament too, to her growing sense of parenthood. She took out her wand and waved it in a complicated matter. Little glowing threads of magic became visible around the door. “Right,” she muttered, nodding to herself. Harry could feel the seconds passing, too fast. Hermione hummed decisively, and turned to him. “Can you break these little blue ones? Not the others. Also, I feel like I should say, no need to blow up the door, okay Harry?” Grimly, Harry nodded. He focused his eyes and simply let out a short sharp burst of his magic, not even bothering with any of his auror handbook spells for breaking wards. Distinctly, he heard a click in the air. Not even bothering to thank Hermione, he yanked open the door and rushed inside.
“Aquitted Death Eater!” bites out Malfoy.
"Because, Potter, these geraniums will tell Desiderius he’s been stupid, the meadowsweet will point out his uselessness, and the carnations will convey to him that he has utterly disappointed me.” He explained gleefully. “Purple too, is the colour of hopelessness and disappointment. It will also convey that I expect better of him in the future. He’ll appreciate that’’.
“Perhaps you should leave” Potter says, not unkind. He sounds confused, unsure. Without turning around, Draco gives a dismissive shrug.
Malfoy hums in response, not looking at him.
A small voice calls out “Who’s there?”. Draco is pleased. No Potter to deny him entry, then.
“Although I did promise Granger not to interfere with your schoolwork, and you have that project going on?”. Lawrence waved a hand impatiently.

“What if I do?”
“Because of what’s coming, Potter”
“I’m certain you are aware that young Mr. Lupin is my cousin.” Hermione lifted her gaze to his, shrewd.
No one had greeted him with such enthusiasm in ages, especially not those who only addressed him by his last name. Curious despite his caution, he stepped inside the shop. It smelled like musty flowers and suprisingly, vinegar.
If I can keep this momentum going, updates are going to be weekly. Kudos keep me writing too!
Sub Rosa means discretion, that which is repeated or said under the rose should remain secret.
Teddy was up, feeling better after another round of potions, and had agreed to eat something. Not having much in the house, they had another “breakfast for dinner” situation. Definitely not what either Molly nor Mrs. Granger would have provided, he was sure. But, it was the best he could do.
“And you, Harry, Draco’s been visiting you, hasn’t he?” Harry jerks upright.
?” Hermione had told Harry she wanted to keep it in the family for a little while longer… what business had Malfoy, knowing?!
“That kid really has got his priorities straight, Har”, Ron joked at him, and Harry barked another laugh. Teddy loved his sweets just as much as Harry, and while it couldn’t be genetics, there was a family connection there. Harry remembered Remus always carrying chocolate, and it wasn’t like dementor attacks had always been imminent.
“I guess we’ll hear about it soon, eh? At least Neville’s already got an owl to send us, if it does happen” Harry laughed.

“I kno-how” Teddy emphasized impatiently. “But he isn’t here. You are. You’re my dad, too”. His little pup looked at him defiantly, a stubborn tilt to his jaw.
